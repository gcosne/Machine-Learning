Report: Australian company signs agreement to prospect for gold
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  An Australian company has signed
an agreement for a multi-million dollar joint-venture to prospect
for gold in Malaysia, a news report said Sunday.
<p>
   Sydney-based Austral Malaysia Mining Limited and its local
partner Kelstone Sdn Bhd will work on gold deposits in the
northeastern state of Kelantan, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
<p>
   Prospecting will begin next month on 684,000 hectares (1.6
million acres) of the concession area, Bernama said.
<p>
   The initial prospecting phase will cost 10 million ringgit (U.S.
dlrs 2.5 million) while estimates for the mining expenditure will
be determined later, according to the report.
<p>
   AMML holds 60 per cent equity in the joint-venture with Kelstone
taking the remainder.
<p>
   The Australian company, incorporated in 1996 in Sydney, is a
specialized mineral prospecting and mining concern which also
builds its own factories and markets its products.
<p>
   Kelstone was established two years ago to produce marble,
granite and cement in Kelantan.

Messier records 1,600th point
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP)  &MD;  Mark Messier became the
fourth National Hockey League player to record his 1,600th career
point, scoring in the first period of Saturday night's game between
the Vancouver Canucks and Ottawa Senators.
<p>
   Messier, in his 19th NHL season, reached the milestone with a
power-play goal 13:46 into the game.
<p>
   Todd Bertuzzi avoided a check and sent a pass through the crease
to Messier. With Senators goalie Damian Rhodes out of position,
Messier had an easy time back-handing the puck into the open net,
cutting Ottawa's lead to 2-1.
<p>
   The goal was the 18th of the season for Messier, who entered the
night with 1,599 points.
<p>
   Messier, who joined the Canucks as a free agent last summer,
recorded his 1,000th assist last Jan. 10 and is also seven goals
from reaching the 600-goal plateau.
<p>
   Wayne Gretzky is the league's career points leader, currently
with 2,764. The two other players to reach the 1,600-point
milestone were Gordie Howe, who finished his career with 1,850
points, and Marcel Dionne (1,771).

<p>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP)  &MD;  Alonzo Mourning scored 11 of
his 28 points in the fourth quarter Saturday as the Miami Heat
rallied from a 20-point third-quarter deficit to win their ninth
straight game, 95-93 over the New Jersey Nets.
<p>
   The victory was Miami's ninth in a row on the road. The Heat
have now won 13 of 14 overall.
<p>
   Miami, which entered the fourth quarter trailing 78-63, won it
without Tim Hardaway, who was ejected after receiving two technical
fouls with 4:51 to play in the third period. They also lost Keith
Askins, who was called for a flagrant foul on Keith Van Horn and
ejected with 6:39 remaining in the game.
<p>
   Kendall Gill led the Nets with 22 points, while Sam Cassell
added 19. &QL; 
 &UR; Dallas Mavericks 103, Washington Wizards 77 &QL; 
<p>
   In Washington, Michael Finley scored 27 points and A.C. Green
had a season-high 25 points and 11 rebounds in Dallas' rout of
Washington.
<p>
   The Mavericks, winning for just the 11th time in 57 games this
season, handed Washington its worst defeat of the season. The
Wizards' previous biggest loss was a 22-point defeat to New York in
November.
<p>
   Rod Strickland led the Wizards with 27 points, but Washington
couldn't overcome a season-low 34.6 percent (28-for-81) shooting
from the field.
<p>
   Cedric Ceballos, making his first start since being traded to
the Mavericks from Phoenix on Feb. 18, had 21 points and 10
rebounds.
<p>
   Green, playing all 48 minutes, extended his National Basketball
Association-record consecutive game streak to 953 in the Mavericks'
biggest win of the season.
<p>
   Chris Webber finished with 17 points and 15 rebounds for the
Wizards. &QL; 
 &UR; Charlotte Hornets 90, Orlando Magic 80 &QL; 
<p>
   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Anthony Mason had 24 points and 13
rebounds as Charlotte pulled away from Orlando
<p>
   Leading 73-69 with 7:50 left in the game, the Hornets scored
nine straight points over the next four minutes, led by Mason with
a slam dunk and a three-point play. The burst effectively put the
game out of reach.
<p>
   All five starters scored in double figures for the Hornets, who
won their fourth straight. Glen Rice had 17 points, followed by
David Wesley with 15, Bobby Phills 13 and Matt Geiger 12.
<p>
   Derek Harper paced the Magic with 20 points, Charles Outlaw
added 16 and David Benoit 15.
 &UR; Chicago Bulls 109, Sacramento Kings 94 &QL; 
<p>
   At Chicago, Scottie Pippen scored a season-high 29 points and
Dennis Rodman grabbed 18 rebounds in his return to the starting
lineup as Chicago defeated Sacramento.
<p>
   Mitch Richmond outscored Michael Jordan 34-28 in a battle of
All-Star guards, but couldn't keep the Kings from suffering their
sixth consecutive loss.
<p>
   Pippen missed the first 35 games after undergoing foot surgery,
and didn't return until he rescinded a trade demand. He has helped
the Bulls go 19-5 since coming back Jan. 10.
<p>
   Rodman, going for his seventh straight NBA rebounding title, was
relegated to a reserve role the previous six games because he
missed two practices. He got back into the starting lineup due to
center Luc Longley's knee injury.
<p>
   Corliss Williamson added 29 points for Sacramento, which was
outscored by an average of 109-93 in going 0-5 so far on its
seven-game road trip. &QL; 
 &UR; San Antonio Spurs 100, Philadelphia 76ers 88 &QL; 
<p>
   At San Antonio, Avery Johnson scored 18 of his 20 points in the
second half as San Antonio rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit
to beat Philadelphia.
<p>
   Johnson and Tim Duncan, who had 27 points and 17 rebounds,
helped make up for the limited playing time of David Robinson. The
All-Star center missed the previous six games with a right knee
injury and played just 24 minutes against the Sixers, finishing
with 17 points and eight rebounds.
<p>
   Philadelphia was led by Derrick Coleman with 35 points and Allen
Iverson with 19. The Sixers led 53-43 at the half and were up 61-56
with 6:27 left in the third period, but Johnson led a rally that
pulled the Spurs within one at the end of the quarter.
<p>
   Then San Antonio outscored the 76ers 31-18 in the fourth
quarter.

Report says environment minister ready to quit, Borneo fires burn
Eds: Many Indonesians use one name
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Dozens of fires spread thick smoke
haze across the eastern side of Borneo island Sunday and
Indonesia's outspoken environment minister reportedly said he was
ready to leave office.
<p>
   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted Sarwono Kusumaatmadja as
saying he didn't expect to be reappointed to the Cabinet when
President Suharto selects a new ministerial lineup later this
month.
<p>
   The present Cabinet was officially dissolved Sunday when a
1,000-member assembly convened to elect a president next week.
Suharto, who has governed for 32 years, is standing unopposed for a
seventh five-year term.
<p>
   Sarwono said the responsibility of selecting a new Cabinet would
be Suharto's alone.
<p>
   ``I don't make fuss,'' he said when asked about his future, the
nenwspaper reported. It did not say why Sarwono might not be
reappointed.
<p>
   Last year Sarwono made headlines when he blamed a list of
plantation and forestry companies, some of them linked to
associates or relatives of Suharto, for the fires that raged last
year and covered the region in haze.
<p>
   Since then he has frankly admitted that a deep economic crisis
would hamper Indonesia's ability to control fires, raising fears
that the smoke haze problem will return this year.
<p>
   Last year, hundreds of fires between July and November across
Indonesia produced a haze over much of Southeast Asia, threatening
the health of millions. The new fires in Borneo have raised fears
the haze might return, perhaps even worse than the last time.
<p>
   As in 1997, officials say that many of the fires this year have
been started deliberately to clear land cheaply.
<p>
   The fires have been burning as a drought grips the eastern part
of Borneo, which should be enjoying heavy rains at this time of
year. Meteorologists blame the El Nino weather phenomenon for the
delay of the wet season.
<p>
   On the weekend, doctors warned that upper respiratory tract
infections will increase if thick smoke and haze from the fires
continue to build near the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda,
about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
<p>
   Cases of gastroenteritis also would soar if a renewed drought
forced people to use unsafe water supplies, they said.
<p>
   ``We could face major health problems if it does not rain
soon,'' said Dr. Jusuf, head of a state-run hospital in Samarinda.
<p>
   Many of the wildfires are burning in the Kutia National Park
north of Samarinda.
<p>
   The official Antara news agency said rangers have found the
charred remains of dozens of rare animals, including orangutans,
small deer, snakes and porcupines.
<p>
   Fires have also broken out in the Bukit Suharto conservation
park, south of Samarinda.
<p>
   Earlier this week at least eight orangutans, including four
babies, were saved by wildlife officials after parts of their
natural habitat were burned.
<p>
   Two other orangutans were found dead in traps. Mother apes
sometimes are hunted by villagers who take their young to sell as
pets.
<p>
   A government Hercules C-130 plane dropped a salt mixture into
clouds near Balikpapan on the weekend in an unsuccessful bid to
draw rain and douse the fires.
<p>
   The government estimates at least 14,000 hectares (34,600 acres)
of forest have been burned since January, although others estimate
that fires have swept through as many as 100,000 hectares (247,000
acres).

BC-Indonesia-Suharto Retirement
With Indonesia-President
Report: Suharto's son says president won't run again in 2003
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  A son of Indonesian President Suharto
said the aging leader will not run for an eighth term in 2003, a
news report said Sunday.
<p>
   Suharto, who has ruled for 32 years, opened a special assembly
Sunday that is almost certain to re-elect him to a seventh
five-year term. Suharto is running unopposed.
<p>
   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted the president's son Bambang as
saying Suharto would call it quits in five years  &MD;  or his family
would force him to step down.
<p>
   ``I think father has no intention of fighting the 2003
presidential election,'' Bambang was quoted as saying. ``The
decision is final. If father later accepts his renomination, we
(his children) will prevent him from being elected.''
<p>
   Suharto rose to power in 1966 after putting down an abortive
coup the year before, replacing Indonesia's first president,
Sukarno. Suharto was first elected president by a consultative
assembly in 1968 and is now Asia's longest serving leader.
<p>
   The president has no clear successor, and Indonesia and
financial markets were gripped recently by wild rumors that he was
seriously ill  &MD;  even that he had died  &MD;  after doctors ordered him
to rest following an arduous overseas trip in December.
<p>
   Suharto has apparently recovered, but there still is some
speculation that the aging leader  &MD;  who turns 77 in June  &MD;  is
getting too old to lead his sprawling nation out of its worst
economic crisis in decades.

<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Trent Klatt and Eric Lindros scored two goals in
less than two minutes of the third period, as the Philadelphia
Flyers beat the New York Rangers 3-1 Saturday, spoiling John
Muckler's coaching debut in Madison Square Garden.
<p>
   The Rangers led 1-0 on a second-period goal by Pat LaFontaine,
but the Flyers took command in the third as Klatt and Lindros
scored goals 1:26 apart early in the period.
<p>
   Muckler, who replaced the fired Colin Campbell during the
Olympic break, got his Ranger coaching career off on the right foot
with a 5-2 victory over the Maple Leafs. &QL; 
 &UR; Boston Bruins 6, Pittsburgh Penguins 2 &QL; 
<p>
   At Boston, P.J. Axelsson scored a breakaway goal just 16 seconds
into the game and the Boston Bruins added two more first period
goals from Dmitri Kristich and Ray Bourque to beat Pittsburgh.
<p>
   Boston goaltender Byron Dafoe stopped 21 shots and evened his
record at 19-19-9 with the win. Dafoe has allowed nine goals in the
his last six games.
<p>
   Tom Barrasso started his 15th straight game for the Penguins,
but was replaced by Ken Wregget midway through the third period
after allowing five goals on 17 shots. &QL; 
 &UR; Dallas Stars 4, Phoenix Coyotes 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Dallas, Ed Belfour got his eighth shutout of the season, and
Jamie Langenbrunner and Grant Marshall scored two goals each to
lead Dallas past Phoenix.
<p>
   Belfour had to stop only 13 shots for his 39th career shutout,
and the Stars killed off nine power plays. Belfour already had
broken the previous franchise record of six in a season, set by
Cesare Maniago. &QL; 
 &UR; St. Louis Blues 5, Los Angeles Kings 2 &QL; 
<p>
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, Geoff Courtnall and
Pierre Turgeon scored the tying and go-ahead goals 10 seconds apart
late in the second period and defenseman Steve Duchesne got his
200th National Hockey League goal as St. Louis Blues beat Los
Angeles.
<p>
   The Blues, 0-for-9 on the power play in Thursday night's 3-1
loss at San Jose, scored three times with the man advantage as they
ended Los Angeles' five-game unbeaten streak and six-game home
winning streak. Pavol Demitra and Jim Campbell each had a goal and
two assists for St. Louis and Courtnall also had a pair of assists.
<p>
   Goaltender Jamie McLennan got the victory in place of Grant
Fuhr, who underwent surgery Saturday in St. Louis to repair torn
knee cartilage in his right knee and is expected to miss at least
four weeks. &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago Blackhawks 4, Colorado Avalanche 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Denver, Jeff Hackett stopped 33 shots for his sixth shutout
of the season and 12th of his career as Chicago ended a three-game
losing streak by defeating Colorado.
<p>
   Five of Hackett's six shutouts have been on the road. The
Avalanche, the last NHL team to be blanked this year, hadn't been
shut out since March 23, 1997. Colorado had its five-game winning
streak snapped. &QL; 
 &UR; Tampa Bay Lightning 5, Washington Capitals 2 &QL; 
<p>
   At Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay scored five goals on 22 shots and
Mark Fitzpatrick made 35 saves as the Lightning ended a 10-game
home losing streak with a victory over Washington.
<p>
   Paul Ysebaert had a pair of goals as the Lightning won at home
for the first time in 1998. &QL; 
 &UR; Edmonton Oilers 4, San Jose Sharks 1 &QL; 
<p>
   At Edmonton, Alberta, Curtis Joseph, in his first start since
returning from the Winter Olympics, had 26 saves as Edmonton took
over sole possession of the final playoff spot in the Western
Conference.
<p>
   The win, before a sold-out crowd of 17,099, put the Oilers one
point ahead of the Sharks and three up on the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
in the conference race.
<p>
   Scoring for Edmonton were Dan McGillis, Roman Hamrlik, Doug
Weight and Rem Murray, while Jeff Friesen had the lone goal for the
Sharks, who were 0-for-10 on the power play. &QL; 
 &UR; New Jersey Devils 4, Carolina Hurricanes 3 &QL; 
<p>
   At East Rutherford, New Jersey, Doug Gilmour scored with 7.4
seconds remaining as New Jersey extended its unbeaten streak to
6-0-1, winning six straight all three since the Olympic break.
<p>
   Sheldon Souray, Scott Niedermayer and Bobby Holik also scored
for New Jersey.
<p>
   Keith Primeau scored twice for Carolina, and Gary Roberts added
a goal as the Hurricanes two-game unbeaten streak came to an end. &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Maple Leafs 4, Montreal Canadiens 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Toronto, Fredrik Modin scored one goal and assisted on two
others and Felix Potvin stopped 26 shots for his fourth shutout of
the season in Toronto's victory over Montreal.
<p>
   Sergei Berezin, Todd Warriner and Steve Sullivan also scored for
Toronto, which beat Montreal at home for the first time in more
than five years.
<p>
   The Maple Leafs honored former captains George Armstrong and the
late Charlie Conacher in a pregame ceremony by raising Armstrong's
No. 10 and Conacher's No. 9 to the rafters. Armstrong played 20
seasons for the Leafs and won four Stanley Cups, captaining Toronto
to its last Cup victory in 1967. Conacher played nine seasons for
Toronto and won the Cup in 1932.

<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Sweeping reforms have yet to ease
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years and life for millions
is getting worse, resulting in civil unrest, President Suharto said
Sunday.
<p>
   In a frank address to a 1,000-member People's Consultative
Assembly expected to re-elect him as president next week, Suharto
said that despite no signs of short term improvement, he remained
committed to reforms sponsored by the International Monetary Fund
under a dlrs 43 billion rescue package.
<p>
   But he was clearly frustrated that the value of the rupiah has
not rebounded, saying he was ``carefully and cautiously
contemplating'' a controversial plan to peg the value of the
battered rupiah to the U.S. dollar through a currency board system.
<p>
   Suharto described the proposed combination of the IMF reforms
and a currency board as ``IMF-Plus.''
<p>
   ``I shall not hesitate to do whatever possible to overcome the
situation in order to alleviate the increasingly heavy burden on
the people's life,'' he said. The rupiah has lost 70 percent of its
value since July.
<p>
   The IMF and major industrial countries, including the United
States, have cautioned against a currency board, saying it was
premature and could wreck Indonesia's chances of recovery.
<p>
   Former U.S. vice president Walter Mondale is expected to
reinforce this message when he arrives Monday for talks with
Suharto as a special envoy of President Bill Clinton.
<p>
   In recent days many analysts have speculated that the plan would
be quietly dropped.
<p>
   Nevertheless, Suharto said that with no quick improvement
likely, Indonesia's economy needed ``appropriate alternative''
treatment to the IMF reforms, which demand wide austerity measures
and the dismantling of monopolies and subsidies that have enriched
Suharto's family and friends.
<p>
   While any solution would have to be supported by the IMF,
ultimately ``our fate rests in our own hands,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Despite the fact that we already have started to carry out
clear and fundamental reforms and a restructuring program, there
are no signs yet that the situation has improved,'' the 76-year-old
leader said in the nationally televised speech.
<p>
   ``On the contrary, the people's life is becoming more
difficult.''
<p>
   Suharto, dressed in a dark business suit with his trademark
black fez-like ``peci'' cap, spoke standing at a podium in the
national Parliament building for more than a hour.
<p>
   Suharto's six children and government ministers sat in the first
rows of the vast wood paneled chamber.
<p>
   The 1,000 delegates listened in silence, many of the women
dressed in colorful ``kebaya'' blouses and sarongs. Those from the
armed forces were in full military uniform.
<p>
   Security was tight for the assembly's opening. Armed troops in
black uniforms took over an amusement park next to the Parliament,
and armed troops were seen outside the building. A half dozen
armored personnel carriers were stationed nearby.
<p>
   About 35,000 troops and police have been assigned to safeguard
proceedings and to clamp down on protests. Mass gatherings have
been banned in the capital, where elite troops have staged
impressive security exercises to demonstrate how they would react
against troublemakers.
<p>
   The assembly is virtually certain to elect Suharto to a seventh
five-year term. But The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted his son,
Bambang, as saying Suharto would not seek an eighth term in 2003.
<p>
   ``The decision is final,'' Bambang was quoted as saying. ``If
father later accepts his renomination, we (his children) will
prevent him from being elected.''
<p>
   In Sunday's speech, Suharto complained that the value of
Indonesia's currency remained weak at around rupiah 10,000 this
week compared with about 2,400 when it first collapsed last July.
<p>
   ``The key to the problem is the stabilization of the exchange
rate of our rupiah at a reasonable level. Unless this (is) achieved
I do not see any possible improvement within a short period of
time,'' he said.
<p>
   Suharto said Indonesia's economic crisis, the worst to erupt
since he took office in 1966, had attacked the viability of
corporations, raised unemployment and sent prices of everyday
items, including medicines, higher.
<p>
   ``I share the sadness of housewives and low-income families in
dealing with the skyrocketing prices. The public becomes restless.
Even the slight misunderstanding has sparked a greater unrest.''
<p>
   In recent weeks, riots and protests over the deterioration of
the economy have rocked more than 20 towns. Five people were
killed, and hundreds of houses and shops have been wrecked or
burned by mobs.
<p>
   Many were owned by ethnic Chinese traders, who dominate commerce
in Indonesia and who have been blamed for rising prices of food and
other basic goods.
<p>
   Suharto made no direct reference to the targeting of the Chinese
minority but said it ``is useless to look for scapegoats.''

China to issue bonds worth dlrs 32 billion to shore up banks
Eds: UPDATES with other details
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  China is to inject 270 billion yuan (dlrs 32.7
billion) into its state-owned commercial banks to make them more
competitive internationally and resistant to risk, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
<p>
   The money will come from an issue of special Ministry of Finance
bonds under a plan approved Saturday by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, the Chinese legislature that opens
its annual session next Thursday, Xinhua reported late Saturday.
<p>
   The bond issue is part of government efforts to shore up China's
heavily indebted banking system and avoid the sort of financial
turmoil that has swept other East Asian economies.
<p>
   The banks  &MD;  the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
Agriculture Bank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Bank
of China  &MD;  will have a capital ratio of eight percent after the
bond issue, in line with Chinese law and international agreements,
Xinhua said.
<p>
   Those banks account for more than 90 percent of China's bank
assets, but are burdened by years of lending to loss-making state
companies. In a report late last year, the World Bank estimated
that with 20 percent of the banks' assets considered
non-performing, ``their net worth is actually negative.''
<p>
   The same report also called the financial sector ``the soft
underbelly'' of China's economic reforms and ``the sector most
vulnerable to shocks.''
<p>
   Xinhua said the commercial banks also would be required to
strengthen their management, undertake further reforms, increase
efficiency, maintain legally set capital ratios and ``effectively
guard against financial risks.''
<p>
   Describing the banks as a ``mainstay'' of China's financial
system, Xinhua said the bond issue was ``extremely significant''
because it would ``promote the smooth development of our country's
economy and society.''

Convicted Indonesian union leader says president's assembly is a
sham

<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  The volume was turned down on the
television showing President Suharto as he gave a speech Sunday,
and the sick, convicted labor chief barely glanced at the screen.
<p>
   ``For me, it's better not to see,'' said Muchtar Pakpahan as he
sat in his hospital room in Jakarta, where he has spent one year of
a four-year sentence for subversion. He has a tumor in his right
lung.
<p>
   For the head of Indonesia's largest independent trade union, the
special assembly that applauded Suharto and is expected to
renominate him as president is a sham.
<p>
   ``It's only to formalize what Suharto wants. There's really no
democracy,'' said Pakpahan, 44, whose outspoken criticism of the
government has landed him in jail four times this decade.
<p>
   In a nationally televised address, Suharto opened the People's
Consultative Assembly by telling delegates he will stick to
austerity measures for his economically battered nation.
<p>
   The loyalist assembly is expected to deliver a seventh,
five-year term to Suharto, whose authoritarian government has
banned critical books and magazines and jailed many dissidents.
<p>
   Pakpahan, who was convicted of organizing a workers' riot on the
island of Sumatra in 1994, said only foreign governments can push
Suharto into allowing democratic reform.
<p>
   ``He will never hear his people, he only hears on the
international level,'' he said. ``His subordinates never criticize
him, never speak frankly.''
<p>
   The government has rejected Pakpahan's appeal to let him fly to
Canada for an operation to remove his tumor. Instead, a Canadian
doctor was allowed to treat him in Cikini hospital with a
technology used to diagnose early-stage cancer.
<p>
   Security is lax at the hospital, where Pakpahan holds weekly
meetings in his room with as many as 10 other leaders of the
loosely organized Indonesian Welfare Labor Union.
<p>
   The government does not recognize the union, which has tens of
thousands of members.
<p>
   As a couple of security guards napped and leafed through
newspapers on the porch outside his room, Pakpahan spoke with a
reporter even though he is barred from doing so.
<p>
   He said he was disappointed that a dlrs 43 billion bailout plan
led by the International Monetary Fund did not require Indonesia to
implement labor rights as well as economic reforms.
<p>
   Pakpahan, jailed in July 1996, faces new charges linked to riots
in Jakarta last year that killed at least five people. He is next
due in court March 19.
<p>
   Every morning, Pakpahan walks around the hospital grounds for an
hour. He strums a guitar when he is stressed. Much of the time, he
chats with visiting activists, works the telephone or pores over
the union documents piled on his desk.
<p>
   ``I have no time to read novels,'' Pakpahan said. ``I'm very
busy here coordinating everything.''

<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Sweeping reforms have yet to ease
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years and life for millions
is getting worse, resulting in civil unrest, President Suharto said
Sunday.
<p>
   In a frank address to a 1,000-member People's Consultative
Assembly expected to re-elect him as president next week, Suharto
said that despite no signs of short term improvement, he remained
committed to reforms sponsored by the International Monetary Fund
under a dlrs 43 billion rescue package.
<p>
   But he was clearly frustrated that the value of the rupiah has
not rebounded, saying he was ``carefully and cautiously
contemplating'' a controversial plan to peg the value of the
battered rupiah to the U.S. dollar through a currency board system.
<p>
   With the currency board plan still on the table, Suharto said he
had asked the IMF and other governments to help Indonesia find
alternative strategies, which he described as ``IMF-Plus.''
<p>
   ``I shall not hesitate to do whatever possible to overcome the
situation in order to alleviate the increasingly heavy burden on
the people's life,'' he said. The rupiah has lost 70 percent of its
value since July.
<p>
   The IMF and major industrial countries, including the United
States, have cautioned against a currency board, saying it was
premature and could wreck Indonesia's chances of recovery.
<p>
   Former U.S. vice president Walter Mondale is expected to
reinforce this message when he arrives Monday for talks with
Suharto as a special envoy of President Bill Clinton.
<p>
   In recent days many analysts have speculated that the plan would
be quietly dropped.
<p>
   Nevertheless, Suharto said that with no quick improvement
likely, Indonesia's economy needed ``appropriate alternative''
treatment to the IMF reforms, which demand wide austerity measures
and the dismantling of monopolies and subsidies that have enriched
Suharto's family and friends.
<p>
   While any solution would have to be supported by the IMF,
ultimately ``our fate rests in our own hands,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Despite the fact that we already have started to carry out
clear and fundamental reforms and a restructuring program, there
are no signs yet that the situation has improved,'' the 76-year-old
leader said in the nationally televised speech.
<p>
   ``On the contrary, the people's life is becoming more
difficult.''
<p>
   Suharto, dressed in a dark business suit with his trademark
black fez-like ``peci'' cap, spoke standing at a podium in the
national Parliament building for more than a hour.
<p>
   Suharto's six children and government ministers sat in the first
rows of the vast wood paneled chamber.
<p>
   The 1,000 delegates listened in silence, many of the women
dressed in colorful ``kebaya'' blouses and sarongs. Those from the
armed forces were in full military uniform.
<p>
   Security was tight for the assembly's opening. Armed troops in
black uniforms took over an amusement park next to the Parliament,
and armed troops were seen outside the building. A half dozen
armored personnel carriers were stationed nearby.
<p>
   About 35,000 troops and police have been assigned to safeguard
proceedings and to clamp down on protests. Mass gatherings have
been banned in the capital, where elite troops have staged
impressive security exercises to demonstrate how they would react
against troublemakers.
<p>
   The assembly is virtually certain to elect Suharto to a seventh
five-year term. But The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted his son,
Bambang, as saying Suharto would not seek an eighth term in 2003.
<p>
   ``The decision is final,'' Bambang was quoted as saying. ``If
father later accepts his renomination, we (his children) will
prevent him from being elected.''
<p>
   In Sunday's speech, Suharto complained that the value of
Indonesia's currency remained weak at around rupiah 10,000 this
week compared with about 2,400 when it first collapsed last July.
<p>
   ``The key to the problem is the stabilization of the exchange
rate of our rupiah at a reasonable level. Unless this is achieved I
do not see any possible improvement within a short period of
time,'' he said.
<p>
   Suharto said Indonesia's economic crisis, the worst to erupt
since he took power in 1966, had attacked the viability of
corporations, raised unemployment and sent prices of everyday
items, including medicines, higher.
<p>
   ``I share the sadness of housewives and low-income families in
dealing with the skyrocketing prices. The public becomes restless.
Even the slight misunderstanding has sparked a greater unrest.''
<p>
   In recent weeks, riots and protests over the deterioration of
the economy have rocked more than 20 towns. Five people were
killed, and hundreds of houses and shops have been wrecked or
burned by mobs.
<p>
   Many were owned by ethnic Chinese traders, who dominate commerce
in Indonesia and who have been blamed for rising prices of food and
other basic goods.
<p>
   Suharto made no direct reference to the targeting of the Chinese
minority but said it ``is useless to look for scapegoats.''

Nine compete in presidential vote in restive Caucasus region
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Nine candidates competed for votes Sunday in
presidential elections in Ingushetia, a restive province in the
Caucasus region of southern Russia.
<p>
   Incumbent President Ruslan Aushev and Issa Kostoyev of the
Russian Prosecutor-General's office were considered the strongest
candidates, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Close to
123,000 people were registered to vote, the news agency said.
<p>
   The small, Muslim-majority republic has been plagued by crime.
Kidnappers have operated with virtual impunity in Ingushetia, which
they use as a safe route to neighboring Chechnya.
<p>
   Relations with another neighboring province, North Ossetia, are
strained. Hundreds of people were killed in a 1992 war with the
province, where most inhabitants are Orthodox Christian. Many of
the ethnic Ingush expelled from North Ossetia during the war have
since returned home, but North Ossetians have clashed with
returning refugees.

<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Trent Klatt and Eric Lindros scored two goals in
less than two minutes of the third period, as the Philadelphia
Flyers beat the New York Rangers 3-1 Saturday, spoiling John
Muckler's coaching debut in Madison Square Garden.
<p>
   The Rangers led 1-0 on a second-period goal by Pat LaFontaine,
but the Flyers took command in the third as Klatt and Lindros
scored goals 1:26 apart early in the period.
<p>
   Muckler, who replaced the fired Colin Campbell during the
Olympic break, got his Ranger coaching career off on the right foot
with a 5-2 victory over the Maple Leafs. &QL; 
 &UR; Boston Bruins 6, Pittsburgh Penguins 2 &QL; 
<p>
   At Boston, P.J. Axelsson scored a breakaway goal just 16 seconds
into the game and the Boston Bruins added two more first period
goals from Dmitri Kristich and Ray Bourque to beat Pittsburgh.
<p>
   Boston goaltender Byron Dafoe stopped 21 shots and evened his
record at 19-19-9 with the win. Dafoe has allowed nine goals in the
his last six games.
<p>
   Tom Barrasso started his 15th straight game for the Penguins,
but was replaced by Ken Wregget midway through the third period
after allowing five goals on 17 shots. &QL; 
 &UR; Dallas Stars 4, Phoenix Coyotes 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Dallas, Ed Belfour got his eighth shutout of the season, and
Jamie Langenbrunner and Grant Marshall scored two goals each to
lead Dallas past Phoenix.
<p>
   Belfour had to stop only 13 shots for his 39th career shutout,
and the Stars killed off nine power plays. Belfour already had
broken the previous franchise record of six in a season, set by
Cesare Maniago. &QL; 
 &UR; St. Louis Blues 5, Los Angeles Kings 2 &QL; 
<p>
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood, Geoff Courtnall and
Pierre Turgeon scored the tying and go-ahead goals 10 seconds apart
late in the second period and defenseman Steve Duchesne got his
200th National Hockey League goal as St. Louis Blues beat Los
Angeles.
<p>
   The Blues, 0-for-9 on the power play in Thursday night's 3-1
loss at San Jose, scored three times with the man advantage as they
ended Los Angeles' five-game unbeaten streak and six-game home
winning streak. Pavol Demitra and Jim Campbell each had a goal and
two assists for St. Louis and Courtnall also had a pair of assists.
<p>
   Goaltender Jamie McLennan got the victory in place of Grant
Fuhr, who underwent surgery Saturday in St. Louis to repair torn
knee cartilage in his right knee and is expected to miss at least
four weeks. &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago Blackhawks 4, Colorado Avalanche 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Denver, Jeff Hackett stopped 33 shots for his sixth shutout
of the season and 12th of his career as Chicago ended a three-game
losing streak by defeating Colorado.
<p>
   Five of Hackett's six shutouts have been on the road. The
Avalanche, the last NHL team to be blanked this year, hadn't been
shut out since March 23, 1997. Colorado had its five-game winning
streak snapped. &QL; 
 &UR; Tampa Bay Lightning 5, Washington Capitals 2 &QL; 
<p>
   At Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay scored five goals on 22 shots and
Mark Fitzpatrick made 35 saves as the Lightning ended a 10-game
home losing streak with a victory over Washington.
<p>
   Paul Ysebaert had a pair of goals as the Lightning won at home
for the first time in 1998. &QL; 
 &UR; Edmonton Oilers 4, San Jose Sharks 1 &QL; 
<p>
   At Edmonton, Alberta, Curtis Joseph, in his first start since
returning from the Winter Olympics, had 26 saves as Edmonton took
over sole possession of the final playoff spot in the Western
Conference.
<p>
   The win, before a sold-out crowd of 17,099, put the Oilers one
point ahead of the Sharks and three up on the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
in the conference race.
<p>
   Scoring for Edmonton were Dan McGillis, Roman Hamrlik, Doug
Weight and Rem Murray, while Jeff Friesen had the lone goal for the
Sharks, who were 0-for-10 on the power play. &QL; 
 &UR; New Jersey Devils 4, Carolina Hurricanes 3 &QL; 
<p>
   At East Rutherford, New Jersey, Doug Gilmour scored with 7.4
seconds remaining as New Jersey extended its unbeaten streak to
6-0-1, winning six straight all three since the Olympic break.
<p>
   Sheldon Souray, Scott Niedermayer and Bobby Holik also scored
for New Jersey.
<p>
   Keith Primeau scored twice for Carolina, and Gary Roberts added
a goal as the Hurricanes two-game unbeaten streak came to an end. &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Maple Leafs 4, Montreal Canadiens 0 &QL; 
<p>
   At Toronto, Fredrik Modin scored one goal and assisted on two
others and Felix Potvin stopped 26 shots for his fourth shutout of
the season in Toronto's victory over Montreal.
<p>
   Sergei Berezin, Todd Warriner and Steve Sullivan also scored for
Toronto, which beat Montreal at home for the first time in more
than five years.
<p>
   The Maple Leafs honored former captains George Armstrong and the
late Charlie Conacher in a pregame ceremony by raising Armstrong's
No. 10 and Conacher's No. 9 to the rafters. Armstrong played 20
seasons for the Leafs and won four Stanley Cups, captaining Toronto
to its last Cup victory in 1967. Conacher played nine seasons for
Toronto and won the Cup in 1932.
 &UR; Vancouver Canucks 6, Ottawa Senators 4 &QL; 
<p>
   At Vancouver, British Columbia, Mark Messier scored two goals
and recorded his 1,600th point as Vancouver extended its unbeaten
streak to five games with a victory over Ottawa.
<p>
   Pavel Bure also scored two goals, including one on a penalty
shot, as the Canucks erupted for four goals in the third period and
improved to 4-0-1 in their last five games. They are 6-1-1 in their
last eight.
<p>
   After Messier tied the game 3-3 three minutes into the third
period, Bure gave Vancouver a 4-3 lead 33 seconds later.
<p>
   Bure took the puck away from Andreas Dackell at the Ottawa blue
line, then cut around two defenseman and whipped a backhander that
beat Senators goalie Damian Rhodes.
<p>
   After Dave Scatchard gave Vancouver a 5-3 lead, Bure sealed the
victory by beating Rhodes through the legs on a penalty shot with
6:46 left in the game. Bure is now 3-for-3 in penalty-shot
opportunities this season.

Webb wins first title at home
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) - Karrie Webb overcame her crushing
1997 loss Sunday, with victory in the Australian Ladies Masters
giving her a first professional win at home.
<p>
   Webb, the world N0. 2-ranked player held off No. 1 Annika
Sorenstam to win
<p>
   the U.S. dlrs 700,000 tournament by five shots at the Royal
Pines resort.
<p>
   Webb, who threw away a four-shot lead last year to lose to
Canada's Gail Graham, shot rounds of 69 69 64 and 70 to finish at
16-under 272.
<p>
   Sorenstam fought hard in the final round, twice closing within
two shots of Webb, but also closed with a 70 to make no inroad into
Webb's overnight lead.
<p>
   South Korea's ever-smiling Soon Park-hyun shot a last round 68
to join Sorenstam in a tie for second. Indian rookie Smriti Mehra
was fourth 10-under with a final round 67.
<p>
   Britain's Laura Davies, who finished 6-under and 10 behind Webb
on 282 would have been a chance but for an opening round of 79 on
Thursday.
<p>
   United States' Kim Saiki was fifth, closing with a 71 for
8-under.

Iraqis collect full ration for March
By EILEEN ALT POWELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  Iraqis on Sunday began collecting their
rations for March, which were at the full level called for by the
United Nations for the first time in six months.
<p>
   Delays in the delivery of foodstuffs, especially baby milk, had
forced Iraq to reduce rations in previous months.
<p>
   U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, have seriously damaged Iraq's economy. Depreciation of the
Iraqi currency and rising prices have put food and other
necessities out of the reach of many.
<p>
   The United Nations launched the oil-for-food program in December
1996 to help the country cope. It allows Iraq to sell dlrs 2
billion worth of oil over a six-month period to buy needed medicine
and food, which is distributed in monthly ration to all 22 million
Iraqis.
<p>
   Starting Sunday, Iraqis were receiving 9 kilograms (19.8 pounds)
of flour, 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) of rice, 2 kilograms (4.4
pounds) of sugar, 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pulses, 1 kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of cooking oil, 150 grams of tea (5.25 ounces) , 150
grams (5.25) of salt, 250 grams (8.75 ounces) of soap and 350 grams
(12.25 ounces) of detergent.
<p>
   Families with babies were eligible for 2.7 kilograms (nearly 6
pounds) of powered milk.
<p>
   The last time the full ration was available was in September,
according to the office of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in
Iraq.
<p>
   Last month, tea, salt and baby milk were in short supply.
<p>
   Iraq has repeatedly blamed the United States and Britain for the
shortages, saying that they have held up contracts at the United
Nations. The United States and Britain have denied the allegations.
<p>
   U.N. surveys indicate that the oil-for-food program has helped
ease some of the problems here.
<p>
   But one in three Iraqi children still suffer from malnutrition,
and the ration lacks important animal protein such as cheese which
is needed for proper development.
<p>
   Last month, the U.N. Security Council agreed to more than double
the oil-for-food program to dlrs 5.2 billion for six months.
<p>
   But Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, said
Saturday that the country would only be able to sell about dlrs 4
billion in crude every six months. He said that even this would
require an infusion of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's oil
facilities.
<p>
   Denis Halliday, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, told
reporters Saturday that a special U.N. team would visit Baghdad
soon to assess the oil industry and determine if needed spare parts
and other equipment could be funded with oil-for-food money.
<p>
   He noted that an increase to sales of dlrs 4 billion still
represented a 100 percent rise.
<p>
   ``That is pretty good,'' Halliday said. ``It's a good
beginning.''

As China's congress meets, legal reform moves on, but how fast?
AP Photos NY195
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  When Li Chunxuan retired as a public bus
ticket-taker but didn't get the pension he expected, he did
something almost unthinkable 20 years ago. He went to court.
<p>
   Li's decision to sue  &MD;  instead of resorting to the usual begging
and bribing of officials or often pointless protesting  &MD;  shows how
China's legal system, although still half-formed, is finding favor
in a society grown used to the arbitrary exercise of power.
<p>
   ``If I couldn't go to court, I'd have to find another channel,
may be go through an official,'' said Li, after his latest
inconclusive appeal at Beijing's No. 2 Intermediate People's Court.
<p>
   From drab courtrooms to government ministries, Chinese leaders
have made painstaking progress building laws and institutions out
of the ruins of radical communist policies. Most Chinese have
benefited, despite severe, standing limits on political freedoms.
<p>
   But the achievements are threatened by swelling corruption,
centuries-old traditions favoring personal contacts over impersonal
rules and the Communist Party's insistence on monopolizing power.
<p>
   Concerns about moving ahead with legal change will suffuse the
annual session of the national legislature, which opens Thursday.
The communist-dominated National People's Congress has been in the
vanguard of the legal revolution. It has passed more than 300 laws
since 1979  &MD;  compared to none in the preceding 22 years  &MD;  and
faintly pushed to supervise the party-run government.
<p>
   ``For a long time, there's been a saying that our National
People's Congress is a rubber stamp,'' said Zhou Wangsheng, a law
professor at prestigious Beijing University.
<p>
   ``If we say that the rubber-stamp image has not been completely
changed, then at least we can say that the NPC is not a bad quality
rubber stamp but a good quality rubber stamp.''
<p>
   The legislature's 2,979 deputies are expected to confirm a new
lineup for the State Council, or Cabinet, and approve a
streamlining of the bloated bureaucracy. Legal reform proponents
are most worried about a shakeup of the congress' own leadership.
<p>
   Qiao Shi, who tried to shape the legislature into a political
force over the past five years and lost a party power struggle last
fall, will be removed as congress chairman. His rumored replacement
is conservative Premier Li Peng. Li needs a new job, having served
the legal limit of two five-year terms as premier.
<p>
   ``Li Peng is a party man and he would see the role of the party
as very strong and the NPC as not a separate organ of power. It's
to be controlled by the party,'' said James Lilley, former U.S.
ambassador to Beijing.
<p>
   Underscoring those concerns, Li, party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin and other Central Committee members, after a two-day meeting
to prepare for the congress, vowed Thursday ``to strengthen party
leadership over legislation.''
<p>
   How much Li and any like-minded supporters he brings with him to
the legislature can slow reform is debatable.
<p>
   Most laws passed since 1979 have underpinned the economic
reforms that raised incomes for hundreds of millions of Chinese.
Citizens, from peasants leaving farms for better jobs to urban
workers shopping in well-stocked department stores, have developed
expectations about justice, and litigation has soared.
<p>
   In Sichuan province, 2,164 peasant households took their
township government to court last year over high taxes.
Ticket-taker Li Chunxuan sued the Beijing No. 1 Public Bus Company
when it balked on early retirement payments.
<p>
   Such litigation was rare 20 years ago. In the heyday of Mao
Tse-tung's radical rule, courts largely were done away with. In
their place were revolutionary tribunals that combined law with
political struggle.
<p>
   Li, 48 and diagnosed with high-blood pressure and heart trouble,
claims he deserves three months wages up-front plus monthly pension
and cost-of-living payments. The company gave him the lump-sum
payment, but pays him just dlrs 25 a month  &MD;  half of what he
contends he should get.
<p>
   His legal foray has left him bitter. He has run through two
lawyers in nearly two years and complains that corruption has been
his undoing. He claims the company bribed the lower court judges, a
common practice in China, and his appeal has dragged on for six
months without conclusion.
<p>
   ``The extent of corruption is just unbelievable,'' Li said.
<p>
   Chinese leaders know that for their survival they must end the
corruption that has flourished under the reforms and spotty legal
system. But some fear legal reform may ultimately encourage demands
for democracy and curb their power.
<p>
   ``They've passed a load of laws. The penal code has been greatly
improved. There's better access to lawyers,'' said Shang Dewen, a
party member and Marxist theoretician who shocked the establishment
last summer with an appeal for democracy and elections.
<p>
   ``But enforcement is no good. Enforcement of anything that
touches on people's rights is empty. The constitution says ordinary
people have the freedom to protest and publish. But these freedoms
don't exist,'' Shang said.
<p>
   Chinese leaders have called for better laws and an independent
judiciary. Legal watchers debate whether they mean ``rule of law''
or ``rule by law.'' The Chinese phrase in vogue in government
speeches is unclear.

Military regime arrests 40, breaks up alleged terrorist plot
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  The military regime has arrested 40 people
it accuses of planning to bomb government buildings and embassies
and assassinate the country's leaders.
<p>
   A government spokesman, Col. Kyaw Thein, said the plot was
masterminded by the All Burma Students Democratic Front, made up of
former students who fled the suppression of a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988.
<p>
   He said that among those arrested in January was law graduate Ko
Thein, described as the leader of a plot to ``undermine public
confidence in the government.''
<p>
   Kyaw Thein, a member of the regime's information committee, told
a news conference that the student insurgents were linked to the
party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
<p>
   He said two members of her National League for Democracy, Myo
Thant and Pol Khwa, had established contact with the student group
and gone underground last November.
<p>
   Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has stressed that she
is seeking a non-violent way to bring democracy to Burma.
<p>
   Kyaw Thein said no action has been taken against Suu Kyi's party
but that the regime wanted to ``highlight NLD's obvious link with
the illegal organization.''
<p>
   Fuses concealed in cigarettes and some explosives that the
colonel said were seized from Ko Thein were exhibited at the
special news conference.
<p>
   The military officer said the insurgents were hoping to place
bombs at government buildings and embassies of members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has taken a generally
pro-regime stance and accepted Burma into the economic grouping.
<p>
   Thein Tun, described as the leader of the student front's ``Unit
207,'' entered Burma from the Thai border area last December after
earlier receiving training in explosives from the Karen National
Union, an ethnic minority rebel group also fighting the central
government.
<p>
   The spokesman did not say when the group would be tried.

Bad weather forces back helicopter carrying Philippine president
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Three helicopters carrying President
Fidel Ramos and other senior officials had to land because of thick
clouds and rain, forcing them to continue their trip to a mountain
town by land Sunday, officials said.
<p>
   Pilots failed in several tries to cross a northern mountain
range as Ramos, accompanied by Cabinet officials and journalists,
traveled to Lagawe from a nearby town to open an athletic meet, the
officials said.
<p>
   With a map in hand, Ramos conferred with the pilots of his Bell
412 helicopter and decided to land at a school in Lamut town in
Ifugao province with the other helicopters, surprising residents
there, a government statement said.
<p>
   From there, Ramos and his party continued the trip in a pickup
truck and two jeeps, officials added.
<p>
   Ramos was traveling to several northern towns Sunday, partly to
campaign for candidates of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party in the May
11 presidential, congressional and local elections.
<p>
   On Feb. 2, a DC-9 jet on a domestic flight also encountered
thick clouds before crashing into a mountain ridge in southern
Misamis Oriental province, killing all 104 people aboard.
<p>
   The cause of the crash of the Cebu Pacific Air plane, the
Philippines' worst air disaster, is being investigated.

BC-FEA-Diana-Lingering Questions Six months later, questions on

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Six months later, bouquets of flowers no longer
rest against the 13th pillar of the Alma traffic tunnel.
<p>
   But just outside, the curious can still be found at any hour,
peering down into the subterranean passage. Or they stare at the
Flame of Liberty, a statue originally meant to honor
French-American ties but now a makeshift shrine to Diana, Princess
of Wales.
<p>
   Six months after the car crash that killed the princess, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, this plaza filled with
hand-scrawled tributes and wilting flowers is still called the
Place de l'Alma. But it has also become Diana's place.
<p>
   A bit farther east along the Seine, in the capital's main
courthouse, two judges are trying to answer one simple question:
How did this tragedy happen?
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE INVESTIGATION &QC; 
<p>
   Aided by the prestigious criminal brigade of the Paris police,
Herve Stephan and Marie-Christine Devidal have interviewed dozens
of witnesses. They've compiled a dossier running into the thousands
of pages. And a renowned police lab outside Paris is still testing
the wrecked Mercedes S280 that carried the victims.
<p>
   The probe is expected to last until late this year  &MD;  not unusual
for a case of this magnitude in France, though certainly unusual
for a traffic accident.
<p>
   But when all the painstaking work is done, will there be
answers? Witness accounts have been widely conflicting, and the man
investigators hoped would be the best witness of all  &MD;  bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, sole survivor of the crash  &MD;  remembers little of
the actual accident.
      Rees-Jones said Saturday he recalled more details after a series
of session with a psychiatrist and will meet again with the French
judge heading the investigation.
<p>
   Questions linger: What was the role of the paparazzi chasing the
Mercedes that night? Was driver Henri Paul's condition known to his
employer  &MD;  the Ritz Hotel, owned by Dodi's father, Mohamed Al
Fayed? Did Diana get adequate medical care? And finally, what about
that mysterious Fiat Uno, and will its driver ever be found?
<p>
   Al Fayed asks yet another question: Could this have been a
conspiracy? At least a few notes at the Alma memorial include the
angry charge: ``This was not an accident!''
<p>
   In the end, though, it appears likely the final story will be
mundane: a simple car crash, caused by a drunk driver, some bad
decisions and a brutal dose of bad luck.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE PAPARAZZI &QC; 
<p>
   In the early hours of Aug. 31, six photographers and a press
motorcyclist were arrested, strip-searched and detained for 48
hours. Three more were brought in later. All 10 remain under
official investigation on two charges: manslaughter and failure to
assist people in danger.
<p>
   At the start, the photographers were the focus of enormous rage
from a public eager to affix blame. Diana's brother came right out
and accused them of killing her. But then driver Paul's condition
came to light, and evidence appeared to point away from the men.
<p>
   Sources in the Paris prosecutor's office, speaking on condition
of anonymity, have told The Associated Press that prosecutor Maud
Coujard likely will soon recommend dropping the charge of
manslaughter against all 10 men and the non-assistance charge for
at least eight of them.
<p>
   Photographers Romuald Rat and Christian Martinez have received
the most attention. Rat reached into the car where Diana lay dying;
he says he has medical training and was trying to take her pulse.
And Martinez was said to have pushed police away, saying angrily:
``They let us work in Bosnia.'' But some witnesses, including the
first doctor on the scene, say the paparazzi didn't interfere.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE DRIVER &QC; 
<p>
   This much is certain: driver Paul, 41, a loyal Ritz employee,
was seriously drunk and on two prescription drugs, including
Prozac, when he took the wheel.
<p>
   Less certain is whether Ritz officials knew of Paul's condition
that night, whether they knew he had a chronic problem, and if they
knew he drank at the hotel bar before the fateful ride  &MD;  as some
have told investigators.
<p>
   If so, the Ritz could be liable in the crash, either criminally
or in a civil case filed by victims' families. Many feel some
action against the Ritz is inevitable.
<p>
   Over the months, troubling details have leaked from the
investigation. Among them: a police interview of a Ritz barman, who
allegedly said Ritz managers knew Paul had a drinking problem, but
pressured the barman not to divulge this ``for the good of the
royal family.''
<p>
   A friend of Paul's, Dominique Melo, told police that Paul would
sometimes drink alone at home to get over a failed love affair,
according to lawyers who've seen the case file.
<p>
   Another possibly thorny problem for the Ritz: Paul didn't have
the special chauffeur's license required to drive the Mercedes
S280.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE FIAT &QC; 
<p>
   The most tantalizing element of the investigation  &MD;  the
mysterious Fiat Uno  &MD;  has also been the most frustrating.
<p>
   Though numerous witnesses have described a car coming into
contact with the Mercedes just before it lost control, the accounts
have been conflicting. Moreover, no witness actually saw the
collision. Investigators have pored over the records of thousands
of Fiat Unos and interviewed hundreds of owners  &MD;  with no apparent
luck so far, despite some hopeful moments.
<p>
   Based on witness accounts and physical evidence, including paint
scrapes and shards of glass, investigators believe the speeding
Mercedes did sideswipe a Fiat before crashing. But how did the
small Fiat escape extensive damage from the much heavier Mercedes?
Where did it go? And why hasn't the driver turned up yet?
<p>
   Investigators believe the Fiat didn't belong to any of the
photographers now under investigation. And they have virtually lost
hope of finding it, sources close to the case tell the AP. Still,
the search for the needle in the haystack goes on.
<p>
   A former police commissioner conducting a private probe for Al
Fayed raised a stir recently when he said a damaged Fiat Uno had
been found, belonging to a photographer known to have tracked Diana
in the past. But police said the car had been ruled out.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; DIANA'S CARE &QC; 
<p>
   In a new book, authors Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod quote
U.S. doctors as saying Diana would have had a better chance if
taken to the hospital sooner, rather than given 30-45 minutes of
on-site treatment.
<p>
   The authors also question the wisdom of a slow ride to the
hospital  &MD;  40 minutes instead of the usual 10  &MD;  for fear of bumping
or jerking.
<p>
   France's health minister recently conceded the French method was
a subject of debate. But he said the issue was moot in this case
because Diana's severe injuries doomed her from the start.

Howard: Suharto must implement IMF package, but flexibility needed,
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The International Monetary Fund's
reform package for Indonesia should be flexible to avoid further
food riots there, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said
Sunday.
<p>
   In a television interview, Howard also said Indonesia's
President Suharto must implement the fund's package, arranged to
help the nation cope with the worst economic crisis in decades.
<p>
   Australia has committed U.S. dlrs 1 billion (Australian dollars
1.5 billion) to the fund's tough U.S. dlrs 38 billion (Australian
dollars 56.7 billion) economic rescue package.
<p>
   ``(Australia's) game plan really involves firstly making sure
that the thrust of the IMF package is maintained, but also ensuring
that the IMF adopts sufficient flexibility in relation to such
things as food subsidies to ensure that the social disruption is
not too great,'' Howard said.
<p>
   ``It's also to constantly put the view to President Suharto that
in the long-term interest of Indonesia he must implement the
reforms that have been asked of him by the IMF.''

   The Indonesian currency's value has plunged from 2,450 rupiah to
the U.S. dollar last July to about 9,000 rupiah now.
<p>
   The falling currency has crippled the economy, leading to mass
layoffs, soaring prices and rioting in some areas.

Report: Official wants army reserves to help stop illegal
immigrants
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  A regional official wants 45,000
army reservists to help police keep illegal immigrants from
entering the country, a newspaper said Sunday.
<p>
   Shahidan Kassim, chief minister of the northwestern state of
Perlis, has urged the Defense Ministry to mobilize the Territorial
Army to secure coastal areas and land borders, the New Sunday Times
reported. That army is made up of men and women who have received
military training in off hours from work.
<p>
   In the past two weeks, 3,036 illegal immigrants have been
arrested for entering the country. Nearly 9,000 illegal immigrants
were caught in all of last year.
<p>
   A senior marine police officer was quoted by another newspaper,
the Star, as saying the number of illegal immigrants has jumped
sharply because of the poor economic situation in neighboring
countries.
<p>
   Police have urged villagers along the west coast of peninsular
Malaysia to be vigilant and alert authorities if they sight any
landings of suspected illegal immigrants.
<p>
   About 100 marine police boats are patrolling the 2,000-kilometer
(1,250-mile) coastline around the clock.
<p>
   Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor, Malaysia's top police
officer, said foreign workers were helping recent illegal
immigrants by sheltering them, sometimes in tunnels, the Sunday
Star reported.

Former general travels to Siberian city to kick off campaign
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed
traveled to the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk on Sunday to launch
his candidacy for the office of regional governor.
<p>
   The ex-army general, who served as President Boris Yeltsin's
security chief for just a few months before falling out of favor,
intends to submit 23,000 signatures supporting his candidacy to the
Krasnoyarsk regional election authorities on Monday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
<p>
   Lebed, credited with ending the war in Chechnya, was once
considered among the top potential contenders in Russia's next
presidential election, scheduled for 2000.
<p>
   But his popularity ratings have declined over the past year, and
Russian media have largely ignored him. Many see his attempt to
become governor of the large western Siberian region, an economic
powerhouse, as a bid to regain a prominent place in public life.
<p>
   Arriving in Krasnoyarsk, Lebed told reporters that ``Siberians
will not lose anything'' because ``a bad governor would not be
elected president.
<p>
   ``I have to be a good one,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
<p>
   If Lebed wins the April 26 vote, he will automatically become a
member of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.

Auckland, ACT lose first games
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Two-time defending champion Auckland
and last year's runner-up ACT Brumbies suffered the two worst
defeats of the opening round of the Super 12 rugby union
competition over the weekend.
<p>
   Auckland, missing the twin driving forces of No. 8 Zinzan Brooke
and hooker Sean Fitzpatrick this season, was humbled 24-8 by the
Coastal Sharks  &MD;  one of four new South African regional teams in
the revised competition.
<p>
   Wing star Jonah Lomu, returning after a 1997 plagued by kidney
illness, was unable to make an impact while new captain and All
Blacks flanker Michael Jones was forced off three quarters through
the contest with an injury.
<p>
   ``A lot of possession went their way,'' Jones said. ``Two of
their tries came from our turnovers. We can't afford those kind of
errors.''
<p>
   The Sharks, under Springbok captain Gary Teichmann, prevailed in
an ill-tempered clash at Durban. Many questions have been asked
about the unity of the new South African teams but Teichmann was
impressed.
<p>
   ``Our defence was good and our pack were up to the task,''
Teichmann said.
<p>
   Springbok flyhalf Henry Honiball contributed 14 points to the
win including the game's opening try.
<p>
   The ACT joined Auckland as the only other side not to register a
point in the opening round under a scoring system which rewards
teams who lose by seven or less, or score four or more tries, with
a bonus point.
<p>
   The Brumbies were dominated 32-7 by an inexperienced New South
Wales team at Sydney Football Stadium on Sunday.
<p>
   New South Wales ran in four tries to one and rookie scrum half
Chris Whitaker had strong debut Super 12 match by scoring a try in
each half and outplaying Wallaby incumbent George Gregan.
<p>
   Gregan and No. 8 Troy Coker were sent to the sin-bin for 10
minutes each after throwing punches and the Waratahs ran in two
tries while both were off the field.
<p>
   Two other South African sides made an immediate impact. The
Western Stormers ran up the biggest scoreline of the round with a
45-39 win over Wellington in Cape Town on Friday, while the Golden
Cats downed the fourth South African entry, the Northern Bulls,
39-32 on Saturday in Pretoria.
<p>
   The Stormers and Cats also picked up bonus points to join New
South Wales on five points.
<p>
   The Sharks are on four points, joined there by two other upset
winners, Otago and Waikato Chiefs.
<p>
   Otago kicked off this season's competition Friday with a 26-19
win over Queensland while the Chiefs held their nerve despite
scoring two tries to four in a 25-23 win over last season's New
Zealand provincial champion Canterbury on Saturday.
<p>
   Chiefs flyhalf Leon MacDonald kicked five penalties while All
Blacks goal-kicking ace Andrew Mehrtens had a miserable night with
just one successful kick at goal from six attempts.
<p>
   The Chiefs success was set up by its forward pack which
outplayed Canterbury's scrum.
<p>
   ``We were very nervous going into this game because we didn't
know what to expect,'' said Chiefs captain Errol Brain. ``Our
forwards went very well and our tighthead prop Jason Barrell made a
great debut.''

Military regime arrests 40, breaks up alleged terrorist plot
Eds: ADDS time element, 2nd graf
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  Burma's military regime has arrested 40
people it accuses of planning to bomb government buildings and
embassies and assassinate the country's leaders.
<p>
   A government spokesman, Col. Kyaw Thein, said Sunday the plot
was masterminded by the All Burma Students Democratic Front, made
up of former students who fled the suppression of a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988.
<p>
   He said that among those arrested in January was law graduate Ko
Thein, described as the leader of a plot to ``undermine public
confidence in the government.''
<p>
   Kyaw Thein, a member of the regime's information committee, told
a news conference that the student insurgents were linked to the
party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
<p>
   He said two members of her National League for Democracy, Myo
Thant and Pol Khwa, had established contact with the student group
and gone underground last November.
<p>
   Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has stressed that she
is seeking a non-violent way to bring democracy to Burma.
<p>
   Kyaw Thein said no action has been taken against Suu Kyi's party
but that the regime wanted to ``highlight NLD's obvious link with
the illegal organization.''
<p>
   Fuses concealed in cigarettes and some explosives that the
colonel said were seized from Ko Thein were exhibited at the
special news conference.
<p>
   The military officer said the insurgents were hoping to place
bombs at government buildings and embassies of members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has taken a generally
pro-regime stance and accepted Burma into the economic grouping.
<p>
   Thein Tun, described as the leader of the student front's ``Unit
207,'' entered Burma from the Thai border area last December after
earlier receiving training in explosives from the Karen National
Union, an ethnic minority rebel group also fighting the central
government.
<p>
   The spokesman did not say when the group would be tried.

Italian Foreign Minister arrives in Iran
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  The Italian foreign minister has arrived in
Tehran, the first Western Cabinet minister to come to Iran since
the European Union lifted a ban on high level visits.
<p>
   Lamberto Dini said Saturday his visit ``opens new horizons''
between Iran and the EU.
<p>
   ``I am happy to be in Iran, and hope that soon we will see other
EU ministers in Tehran as well,'' Dini told Iran's deputy foreign
minister, Morteza Sarmadi, who met him at the airport.
<p>
   Earlier this week EU foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels,
said a number of encouraging developments in Iran  &MD;  including May's
election of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric  &MD; 
required a positive response.
<p>
   The EU move differed sharply from the policy of the United
States, which seeks to isolate Iran.
<p>
   A ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed by the EU in April
1997 after a German court implicated Iranian authorities in the
1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin.
<p>
   When Italy announced Dini's visit to Tehran just 48 hours after
the ban on visits was lifted, the Rome newspaper La Stampa
newspaper suggested the government was trying to beat the French to
Tehran. France and Germany are Iran's largest European investors.

Egyptian plane carrying baby food, medicine leaves for Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian plane carrying 30 tons of baby
food and medical supplies left for Iraq Sunday.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq which
has been under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods have to be approved by
the U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The Egyptian plane was carrying baby food and medicine donated
by businessmen and pharmaceutical companies valued at over 1.2
million pounds (dlrs 353,000), said airport officials, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The Egyptian celebrities included actress Raghda as well as
Parliament deputy Ahmed Taha.
<p>
   ``The delegation's trip is a message of Arab solidarity to the
United States and Israel,'' said Taha.
<p>
   The trip, the second for Egyptian celebrities, is part of a
concerted effort by Arab nations to alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people.
<p>
   The Iraqi government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo. A U.N. report says the sanctions have
led to widespread malnutrition.

Seven slain in troubled Serbian province
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  The worst single day of violence
since the emergence of a clandestine ethnic Albanian militant group
in the Serb province of Kosovo has left seven people dead.
<p>
   The victims on Saturday included two Serb policemen and five
Albanians, who were apparently killed in retaliation.
<p>
   Two Serb policemen also were wounded when the four were ambushed
while on patrol in Serbia's mostly ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo, the Tanjug news agency reported. ``Repulsing the terrorist
attack, policemen killed five terrorists,'' Tanjug said.
<p>
   Ethnic Albanian sources said the incidents were related but
separate, with the ambush coming first and a police siege of
several ethnic Albanian villages following. The five civilian
deaths, they said, occurred in villages near Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of the provincial capital, Pristina.
<p>
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity and have been
reliable in the past.
<p>
   It wasn't clear whether the five Albanians killed were members
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a militant group demanding
independence for Kosovo. It has claimed responsibility for more
than 20 deaths since surfacing in 1996.
<p>
   More than 90 percent of Kosovo residents are ethnic Albanians.
Tension has been high since Serbia revoked the province's virtual
autonomy in 1989 and sent police and army reinforcements to Kosovo.

Woman convicted of killing daughter is 600th Filipino sentenced to
die
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  A woman convicted of beating her
6-year-old daughter to death has become the 600th Filipino
sentenced to die since the death penalty was restored in 1994, a
senator said Sunday.
<p>
   The woman, Marlene Castro, was among 32 people sentenced last
month by various Philippine courts to die by lethal injection, said
Sen. Ernesto Herrera, an anti-crime crusader.
<p>
   A metropolitan Manila court convicted Castro, 38, last week of
fatally beating her daughter in their home in 1996, he added.
<p>
   No executions have been carried out under the 1994 law, but the
Philippines is preparing to execute Leo Echegaray some time between
March and September.
<p>
   Echegaray, convicted of twice raping his 10-year-old
stepdaughter, who was the first to be sentenced to death after
capital punishment was reimposed in 1994 for 13 ``heinous crimes,''
including rape, murder and drug trafficking.
<p>
   The death sentences are automatically reviewed by the Supreme
Court, which so far has upheld the sentences of six convicts,
acquitted seven and commuted the death penalties of about 10.
<p>
   It upheld the death penalty for Echegaray last year.
<p>
   Philippine Roman Catholic church leaders and other groups are
appealing to the government to spare Echegaray's life and scrap the
death penalty, arguing it would not deter crime and could send
innocent people to death.
<p>
   Proponents, however, say crimes remain widespread despite the
reimposition of the death penalty because no one has been executed
yet under the 1994 law.
<p>
   More than half of those sentenced to death so far are convicted
rapists, 150 of whom abused their own daughters or children under
12 years old, Herrera said.

<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  If Sunday's gubernatorial vote goes his
way, Gerhard Schroeder could be in a position to challenge
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and return the German left to power after 16
years of conservative rule.
<p>
   Armed with a winning smile and a reputation as a man who gets
things done, the incumbent Lower Saxony governor says a convincing
victory would persuade him to claim the Social Democratic Party's
nomination for the national race.
<p>
   The party plans to announce its candidate on Monday, leading to
speculation that Schroeder is it. Polls indicate Schroeder has the
best chance of beating Kohl on Sept. 27.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   Perhaps more than anything, Germans looking for a change could
propel Schroeder to the top.
<p>
   ``There's just no one else to vote for,'' said restaurant
manager Andrea Mante, 35.
<p>
   Polls opened under sunny skies Sunday morning with 5.9 million
voters eligible to elect a new 155-seat state parliament, which
chooses the state premier, or governor. The Social Democrats hold a
one-seat absolute majority in the outgoing legislature.

<p>
   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) - Karrie Webb cried tears of
happiness before finishing off her five-stroke win at the
Australian Ladies Masters on Sunday  &MD;  her first professional
victory at home.
<p>
   A year after Webb blew a four-shot lead into the final round and
was left in tears of despair, she described the win at Royal Pines
Resort as the ``happiest day of my life.''
<p>
   Webb, the world No. 2, held off a spirited challenge from No. 1
Annika Sorenstam of Sweden to win the U.S. dlrs 700,000 tournament
in front of family friends and wheelchair-bound coach Kelvin
Haller.
<p>
   Webb shot rounds of 69 69 64 and 70 to finish at 16-under 272.
<p>
   Sorenstam fought hard in the final round, twice closing within
two shots of Webb, but also closed with a 70 to make no inroad into
Webb's overnight lead.
<p>
   South Korea's Soon Park-hyun shot a last round 68 to join
Sorenstam in a tie for second. Indian rookie Smriti Mehra was
fourth at 10-under with a final round 67.
<p>
   Britain's Laura Davies, who finished 6-under and 10 behind Webb
on 282, would have been a chance but for an opening round of 79 on
Thursday.
<p>
   Kim Saiki of the United States was fifth, closing with a 71 for
8-under.
<p>
   Haller coaches Webb, 23, with tips and videos via the Internet
from his base in Queensland and has been her golf mentor since she
was eight.
<p>
   ``For him to be here and watch me win today, it was great,''
Webb said. ``To win in front of your family and friends is
something very special.
<p>
   ``I had a tear or two in my eye walking up the 18th.''
<p>
   Sorenstam had been within striking distance after four holes and
was two shots away again after 12.
<p>
   ``I felt if I got a good early start it would make her think
about the shots as they disappeared,'' said Sorenstam. ``I gave it
all I had, but I ran out of steam.''

Hospital threatens to call police if parents don't take setuplets
home

<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  A Saudi hospital has
threatened to call the police if the parents of seven-week old
setuplets don't take their babies home, doctors said Sunday.
<p>
   Four of the seven babies have been issued discharge slips since
last week but their parents say they are not ready to take them
home. Doctors say the hospital nursery is overcrowded and they are
running out of patience.
<p>
   ``I told their parents that if they do not take them home soon,
we will call the police to make sure they do. I have 26 babies in a
nursery that has a capacity for 20,'' said Hind Moussa, a
pediatrician at the Abha Maternity Hospital in the southern Saudi
city of Abha where the babies were born 8 weeks premature.
<p>
   The four boys and three girls  &MD;  only the third set of septuplets
known to have been born alive  &MD;  were delivered by Hasna Mohammed
Humair, a 40-year-old housewife, on Jan. 14.
<p>
   Humair says the unplanned pregnancy occurred while she was
taking a fertility drug to regulate her menstrual cycle, and that
she is still not ready for the responsibility of caring for the
babies.
<p>
   Moussa said the three girls and a boy who are now ready to go
home were in good health and growing well. She expects the
remaining three boys to be ready to leave the hospital by next
week.
<p>
   Moussa said she's managed to get local companies to pledge
supplies of free milk and diapers for the babies. She suggested
that Humair take home at least two of the babies to get used to
caring for them.
<p>
   Humair, who shares her two-bedroom home with her husband and six
other children, says she's been constantly fatigued since the
delivery and would prefer to have some help before bringing the
babies home.
<p>
   The hospital turned down her husband's request to send a
qualified person to take care of the babies, Humair said.
<p>
   The father, Abdullah Mohammed Ali, 55, is a retired civil
defense employee who supplements his dlrs 1,066 monthly pension by
driving a cab. Saudi newspapers have reported he has two other
wives and nine children in addition to the septuplets.
<p>
   Islam allows men up to four wives at a time if they can support
them.
<p>
   Another set of septuplets was born in Saudi Arabia in September,
but only one child lived. In November, American Bobbi McCaughey
also gave birth to seven children, all of whom survived.

Hospital threatens to call police if parents don't take setuplets
home

<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Doctors will call the police
if the parents of seven-week old setuplets don't take their babies
home soon, officials at a Saudi hospital said Sunday.
<p>
   Four of the seven babies have been issued discharge slips since
last week but their parents say they are not ready to take them
home. Doctors say the hospital nursery is overcrowded and they are
running out of patience.
<p>
   ``I told their parents that if they do not take them home soon,
we will call the police to make sure they do. I have 26 babies in a
nursery that has a capacity for 20,'' said Hind Moussa, a

Egyptian plane carrying baby food, medicine leaves for Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian plane carrying 30 tons of baby
food and medical supplies left for Iraq Sunday.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq which
has been under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods have to be approved by
the U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The Egyptian plane was carrying baby food and medicine donated
by businessmen and pharmaceutical companies valued at over 1.2
million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 353,000), said airport officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The trip, the second for Egyptian celebrities, is part of a
concerted effort by Arab nations to alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people.
<p>
   The Iraqi government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo. A U.N. report says the sanctions have
led to widespread malnutrition.

Dissidents demand change as others arrested or disappear
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Two dissidents have petitioned China's
legislature for democratic reforms and the release of political
prisoners, even as police rounded up other activists who issued
similar appeals, a human rights group said Sunday.
<p>
   The petitions from Zeng Ning, a veteran activist from southern
Guizhou province, and Liu Xianbin from neighboring Sichuan province
were the latest in a stream of appeals from pro-democracy activists
ahead of the legislature's annual meeting, which opens Thursday.
<p>
   The petitions came despite the arrests and disappearances of
other dissidents in recent days.
<p>
   On Saturday, authorities told the family of Shanghai dissident
Yang Qinheng, who was detained Thursday after signing a petition to
the legislature with 16 others, that he has been formally arrested
for ``disturbing social order,'' the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
<p>
   Police also told the family of Ma Lianggang, another dissident
detained Saturday after police searched his home in Anhui province,
east China, that he has been arrested on suspicion of ``endangering
state security,'' the Information Center said.
<p>
   Another dissident, Shen Liangqing, disappeared Wednesday and was
believed to be in detention, while a fourth activist, Lin Xinshu,
was taken away by police from his home and his whereabouts were
unknown, the center said.
<p>
   Zeng, freed last year after serving a two-year prison term,
called in his petition for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square democracy protests, which the government crushed, killing
hundreds.
<p>
   He also demanded the release of political prisoners, improved
civil liberties, the abolition of labor camps, legalization of new
political parties, direct, open and fair elections for legislators,
media freedom and other reforms.
<p>
   ``Timely reforms of the political system are the only way out
and the realistic choice for solving China's problems,'' Zeng wrote
in his petition, released by the Information Center.
<p>
   The petition from Liu, a former student at Beijing's prestigious
People's University who was sentenced to two years imprisonment in
1991 for pro-democracy activities, also included an appeal for the
release of political prisoners and an end to police harassment of
dissidents.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Zhang Rujuan, a Shanghai dissident detained Friday,
was released Saturday, as was Cheng Fan, a dissident who had been
in detention since Thursday, the center said.
<p>
   They were among 17 people who signed a petition to the
legislature last week that included a call for a thorough
investigation of the crackdown on the Tiananmen protests.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister opens border station with China
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia opened a new border-crossing with China on
Sunday in hopes of boosting trade between the two giants.
<p>
   First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov took part in the
inauguration of the international automobile checkpoint at
Zabaikalsk, eastern Siberia, about 5,000 kilometers (3,125 miles)
east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   The checkpoint is expected to handle 10,000-12,000 people and
1,500 cars daily, Interfax said.
<p>
   Bilateral trade reached dlrs 6 billion last year. During Chinese
Premier Li Peng's visit to Moscow last month, Russian and Chinese
officials signed a package of agreements intended to further
increase the trade.
<p>
   Nemtsov said Sunday that Russia is aiming for dlrs 20 billion in
bilateral trade, Interfax said.
<p>
   The two nations' ties have flourished in recent years after
decades of friction. Moscow sees the relationship as a ``strategic
partnership'' that counterbalances U.S. influence in the world.

Dini says EU wants open dialogue with Iran

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, the
first Western Cabinet official in Iran since the European Union
lifted a ban on high level visits, said Saturday that the EU wanted
a more open dialogue with Tehran.
<p>
   Dini, speaking to reporters after an hour-long meeting with his
Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi said he was pleased with the
EU's new relationship with Iran.
<p>
   ``It is not a critical dialogue  &MD;  we do know that did not prove
successful. We are looking to an open dialogue on all matters of
common concern,'' said Dini, speaking in English.
<p>
   he said the shape of the new relationship still needed to be
defined.
<p>
   The EU had maintained a policy of trying to bring change in Iran
through ``critical dialogue,'' but earlier this week EU foreign
ministers said a number of encouraging developments  &MD;  including the
election in May of relatively moderate cleric President Mohammad
Khatami  &MD;  required a positive response.
<p>
   The EU move differed sharply from U.S. policy, which says Iran
is a rogue state and must be isolated.
<p>
   A ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed by the EU last April
after a German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin.
<p>
   ``We are very pleased for these recent developments between the
EU and Iran,'' said Dini, who arrived in Tehran late Saturday.
<p>
   He said Italy's relations with Iran were positive. ``I would say
the dialogue we have established between our two countries is all
encompassing.''
<p>
   Dini was also due to meet Khatami, and the powerful parliament
speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who is a leading radical opposed to
Khatami's moderate faction.

Biennial Asian Aerospace show hit by economic slowdown
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  Beset by a regional economic slowdown and
tensions in the Gulf, Asia's premier aerospace trade show ended
Sunday with reduced attendance and indications of fewer deals.
<p>
   Fewer than 25,000 trade visitors attended Asian Aerospace '98,
down several thousand from the last show in 1996, organizers said.
Figures for the number and value of deals made at the show were
unavailable, but exhibitors said they were prepared for a slow
period in the industry over the next few years in Asia.
<p>
   ``We're going to see, clearly, a reduction in the number of
options that are realized,'' Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rose
told a news conference at the start of the six-day show last
Tuesday.
<p>
   As a result of economic turmoil, defense spending through much
of the region has been cut and some Asian airlines have cut fares
in an effort to attract more passengers.
<p>
   On the opening days of the world's third largest air show, small
groups wandered through the displays and major exhibitors had
plenty of salesmen rocking on their heels.
<p>
   A number of U.S. warplanes originally planned for the show,
including F-17s, a B-1 Lancer bomber and an F-117 Stealth fighter,
were withdrawn because of the situation in the Gulf.
<p>
   It was the third time in a row that tension with Iraq has caused
the United States to withdraw sophisticated equipment from a major
air show, American officials said last week.
<p>
   The daily flying display did include some U.S. aircraft, notably
the F-16 fighter and Apache helicopter, which drew crowds despite
the steamy weather.
<p>
   Also making demonstration flights was the N-250 turboprop
commuter plane made by Indonesia's state-owned aircraft
manufacturer IPTN.
<p>
   Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the
Indonesian government has withdrawn subsidies for that company.
IPTN has been operating with considerable losses since its
establishment in 1976, and slow sales of the N-250 and the
company's new N-2130 project have exacerbated that situation.
<p>
   On the plus side, Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC received a dlrs 240
million order for jet engines from Business Express Airlines, New
England's largest regional airline, on the third day of the show.
<p>
   Brazil's Embraer clinched two deals worth a total of dlrs 1.3
billion, more than three times the total of all deals made during
the last Asian Aerospace show. It also profited from the Business
Express purchase with an dlrs 810 million order for 20 of its
RJ-135 regional passenger jets, which will be introduced later this
year.
<p>
   The final two days of the show were open to all visitors, and
organizers estimated there were more than 45,000 visitors from the
general public.
<p>
   They watched acrobatic fighter planes tear by at low altitude,
collected souvenirs, and inspected the modern military aircraft
displayed on Changi Airport's sun-baked tarmac.

Furuseth leads Norwegian sweep

<p>
   YONG PYONG, South Korea (AP)  &MD;  Olympic silver medalist Ole
Kristian Furuseth and teammates Finn Christian Jagge and Tom
Stiansen gave Norway a sweep of the medals in a men's World Cup
slalom on Sunday.
<p>
   Furuseth got his first victory since 1995 and the eighth of his
career with a two-run time of 1 minute, 39.15 seconds. He led by
.54 seconds after the first run and extended the margin to .67
overall.
<p>
   Jagge, second in the morning, was second overall in 1:39.82, .39
better than Stiansen, last year's world championship gold medalist
who was third in the first heat as well.
<p>
   Kiminobu Kimura of Japan missed his second podium of the season
by a mere .16 seconds, settling for fourth in 1:40.37. Fifth after
the morning run, Kimura improved one spot by getting past Austria's
Thomas Stangassinger, the World Cup slalom points leader.
Stangassinger finished in 1:40.59.
<p>
   At that, Stangassinger gained a little breathing room in the
slalom standings, since his closest pursuer, teammate Thomas
Sykora, was only seventh. Stangassinger has 488 points to Sykora's
476 with only one slalom remaining this season.
<p>
   Hans-Petter Buraas of Norway, the Olympic champion, lasted only
three gates in the first run before going off course. He remained
third in the slalom standings with 340, followed by Furuseth (296),
Kimura (292) and Jagge (285).
<p>
   Furuseth, 31 and in his 12th World Cup season, actually won the
race in the morning when, as the first racer down the course, he
completed the 573-meter (627-yard) course in 48.33 seconds, a
healthy .54 seconds better than Jagge, the 1992 Olympic slalom gold
medalist.
<p>
   Stiansen, an unlucky fourth in the Olympics behind Buraas,
Furuseth and Sykora, was third in the morning, but the deficit of
.94 seconds meant that the two Norwegians ahead of him would battle
privately for the victory.
<p>
   The key to both runs was executing at the top of the course. Any
mistake over the first 20 seconds robbed the racer of the speed
necessary to negotiate the lower flat section.
<p>
   Matt Grosjean, the only American in the field, battled through
the pain of a swollen and blistered foot to place 26th in 1:42.00.
His gutty second run of 50.77 seconds was .05 faster than the
winner.
<p>
   The top North American was Canada's Thomas Grandi, who was 13th
in 1:41.21.

Schumacher worried about image says rival Herbert
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  &MD;  British driver Johnny Herbert
expects to see a contrite former champion Michael Schumacher when
the Formula One season starts with the Australian Grand Prix on
Sunday.
<p>
   Herbert, one of the first drivers to arrive for the opening
round, said the end of season debacle involving Schumacher and
current world champion Jacques Villeneuve had tarnished
Schumacher's image in the eyes of the German's fans.
<p>
   The Sauber driver said Schumacher faced a crucial year and
needed to atone for the incident; and was aware of his image
problem.
<p>
   The Ferrari star rammed Villenueve during the season-ending race
in Jerez and was found to have done so deliberately, by the sport's
governing body.
<p>
   Schumacher avoided a fine or a ban for the new season, merely
losing his placing in last year's standings, and will race in
Melbourne.
<p>
   ``Everything that happened at the end of last year, I think it
was something that was very, very bad for Michael,'' Herbert said
Sunday.
<p>
   ``I think it hit him very bad as far as all his fans in Italy
and Germany, and probably across the world.
<p>
   ``So he's got a lot of things to do. It will be an interesting
year for him, and really at Ferrari as well, because I know there
was a lot of pressure from there as well.''
<p>
   Herbert said Schumacher would be concerned about his image.
<p>
   ``I think deep down there is that side of it, but I would think
he probably wants to make amends for what happened at the end of
last year. I think it will be something this year he won't want to
repeat.''
<p>
   Meanwhile Herbert tipped the McLarens of Australian Grand Prix
defending champion David Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen as the
pre-season favorites.
<p>
   ``In all the testing that's been done they've been quite a bit
considerably quicker than anybody else,'' Herbert said.

Report: Netanyahu to appoint northern commander head of Mossad
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly
plans to appoint Israel's northern army commander as head of the
Mossad spy agency, which has had its vaunted image tainted by
repeated botched operations.
<p>
   Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine is Netanyahu's top choice to replace
outgoing Mossad chief Danny Yatom, who resigned over the failed
attempt to assassinate an Islamic militant in Jordan last
September, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Sunday.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation came the day before the news broke that
Mossad agents had been caught trying to install a wiretap in
Switzerland. Reports said the target of the wiretap was the
Hezbollah guerrilla group.
<p>
   The incident followed the botched assassination attempt in
Jordan on Hamas political leader Khalid Mashaal, and the indictment
of a retired Mossad agent, Yehuda Gil, for fabricating reports that
Syria was preparing for war.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation paved the way for Netanyahu to try and patch
up relations with Jordan's King Hussein, who was deeply embarrassed
by the Mossad attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Hussein has said he would only resume security cooperation with
Israel once Yatom stepped down.
<p>
   Levine, 52, would reportedly take the Mossad post if it was
offered, news reports said.

Philippine president orders preparations against La Nina's floods
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  President Fidel Ramos said Sunday he
has ordered precautions against the floods and heavy rains that the
La Nina weather phenomenon is expected to bring to Philippines this
year.
<p>
   La Nina, expected in June, has the opposite effects of El Nino,
the worldwide weather phenomenon that has caused prolonged drought
in the country since last year.
<p>
   Ramos ordered government agencies to clean and repair all
waterways and flood control projects before La Nina's onset.
<p>
   A government statement said floods brought by La Nina could
affect about 380,000 hectares (938,600 acres) of rice lands and
wipe out a substantial part of the country's rice output this year.
<p>
   Agriculture Secretary Salvador Enriquez said the government is
considering steps such as delaying rice planting in some provinces
until the rainy season has passed.
<p>
   Last year, at least 7,718 tons of rice worth 65.34 million pesos
(dlrs 1.63 million) and 13,175 tons of corn worth 75.9 million
pesos (dlrs 1.9 million) were lost because of drought caused by El
Nino, officials said.
<p>
   The Philippines produced an average of 10.79 million tons of
rice and 4.25 million tons of corn annually from 1994 to 1996.
<p>
   The government has decided to import 650,000 tons of rice to
replenish the country's buffer stocks. The National Food Authority
also is awaiting permission for the duty-free importation of
300,000 tons of corn, which is used mainly for hog and poultry
feed.
<p>
   Weather bureau chief Leoncio Amadore, a member of a government
task force dealing with El Nino's effects, has said about 90
percent of the country received less than 50 percent of normal
rainfall from October 1997 to January 1998.

South African pitch is worrying Sri Lankan team
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Sri Lankan cricket pundits are not
worried about South African fast bowlers or spinners, but the
pitch, which they say will be the deciding factor in the upcoming
series.
<p>
   ``Playing on bouncy South African tracks could be a tough
exercise,'' Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga was quoted as
saying in the state-run Sunday Observer.
<p>
   Sri Lanka leaves for South Africa Tuesday to play two Tests and
take part in the triangular limited over series that will also
involve Pakistan.
<p>
   ``It is important that the batsmen should be accustomed to the
surface as quick as possible,'' said Ranatunga, who led his country
to the limited-over World Cup.
<p>
   Ranatunga said there are no bouncy pitches at home.
<p>
   ``We do not get pitches to our liking when we play in other
parts of the world. When we go to Australia, New Zealand or South
Africa and lose badly, they (local cricket officials) will
criticize the players, but none will talk about the pitches that we
had to play (at home),'' he said.
<p>
   Team Manager Duleep Mendis said that playing in South Africa had
a special aspect.
<p>
   ``In fact every tour is important, but there is something
special playing in South Africa because of different type of
wickets,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Experience counts a lot, especially in South Africa (where)
you cannot take chance. We had to think a lot and have lengthy
discussions over the subject and finally came to a conclusion that
seasoned campaigners should go,'' Mendis said.
<p>
   The team has retained all the old guards, including Aravinda de
Silva, vice captain and Sanath Jayarusira, the master blaster.

Queensland wins limited overs series
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Queensland bowler Scott Prestwidge
guided his team to victory over New South Wales with a fighting
innings in the final of Australia's limited overs competition
Sunday.
<p>
   Prestwidge scored an unbeaten 42 and shared a 55-run stand with
Andy Bichel for the eighth wicket after Queensland slumped to 104
for seven chasing New South Wales' 166 from 49.3 overs.
<p>
   Earlier Prestwidge and Bichel both took 3-25 but their team
looked down for the count at 40 for five and 72 for six.
<p>
   After Bichel went with eight still needed, Prestwidge edged
Scott Thompson through a vacant first slip then drove forcefully to
the cover boundary to finish the match with two boundaries.
<p>
   ``I've got no feeling, I was dehydrated and cramping up,''
Prestwidge said.
<p>
   It was Queensland's sixth Australian limited overs title and
second in three years.

BC-Somali-Khat Fighting
Five killed, six wounded in Somalia fighting over khat
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)  &MD;  Five people were shot dead and six
wounded in the southern Somalia port of Kismayu during a gun battle
over khat, a stimulant chewed by Somali males, according to reports
Sunday.
<p>
   The fighting Saturday began when members of the Dhulbahante
subclan opened fired on a light airplane bringing khat from
neighboring Kenya. One person was killed and three wounded.
<p>
   The plane had been chartered by a member of the Ogaden sub-clan,
who retaliated, killing four Dhulbahantes and wounding three
others, said a source reached by high frequency radio.
<p>
   It was impossible to immediately ascertain what sparked the
fighting, but khat business if very lucrative. It is common for
militiamen to try and seize khat consignments from Kenya, where the
leafy plant is commercially grown.
<p>
   The two Darod subclans support faction leader Mohamed Saed
Hirsi, son-in-law of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Hirsi,
also known by nickname Morgan, controls Kismayu, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) south of Mogadishu.
<p>
   Hirsi is visiting neighboring Ethiopia.
<p>
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said elders met
Sunday to mediate among the clansmen and tension remained high.
<p>
   Somalia has had no central government since Siad Barre's ouster
by a rebel force in 1991 and the country's disintegration into
fiefdoms guarded by armed clan militias.
<p>
   Faction leaders have scheduled a meeting March 13 in the
southwestern town of Baidoa to try and form a national government.
<p>
   The effort was agreed upon at the end of a conference by faction
leaders in Cairo, Egypt, in December. In the past, faction leaders
have failed to honor agreements on a new government.

Vik wins World Cup nordic combined Sapporo event
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAPPORO, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Olympic gold medalist Bjarte Engen Vik,
who took the lead on ski jumping points, barely held off Austria's
Mario Stecher in cross-country skiing Sunday for a 0.8-second
victory in a World Cup nordic combined race.
<p>
   It was the 26-year-old Norwegian's third victory in 10 events so
far this season in the 15-event World Cup series.
<p>
   Vik, a gold medalist in both the individual and team events at
the Nagano Games earlier this month, started the cross-country
portion here with a four-second lead thanks to jumps of 133 and 127
meters Saturday on the Okurayama large hill on Japan's northern
main island of Hokkaido.
<p>
   Stecher, who was eighth at the Olympics, started Sunday's
cross-country race in second place after jumps of 126.5 and 132.5
meters Saturday.
<p>
   He made up 3.2 seconds of the gap by finishing the 15 kilometers
in 37 minutes, 5.4 seconds, ninth fastest overall. Vik's 37:08.6,
11th fastest overall, was just enough to finish in front.
<p>
   Fred Boerre Lundberg of Norway, who was third in jumping, also
finished third overall, 1:52.3 behind Vik.
<p>
   Japan's Tsugiharu Ogiwara was fourth, followed by Sylvain
Guillaume of France and Todd Lodwick of the United States.
<p>
   Samppa Lajunen of Finland, who won the silver medal at the
Nagano Olympics, placed 14th, 5:39.8 behind Vik. He was ninth in
jumping and 37th fastest in the cross-country race.
<p>
   Russia's Valerij Stoljarov, the Olympic bronze medalist, placed
18th, 6:34.1 behind.
<p>
   After 10 events, Vik leads the World Cup standings with 1,030
points, followed by Stecher with 911, Lodwick with 629 and Hannu
Manninen of Finland with 622.
<p>
   The next event starts Saturday at Lahti, Finland.

Commander in Gulf says U.S. forces to stay as long as it takes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  U.S. forces will remain in Kuwait as long as it
takes to ensure Iraq complies with a deal over weapons inspection,
the U.S. commander in the Gulf was quoted as saying Sunday.
<p>
   ``The use of military force is an option we will use if we don't
get compliance and cooperation, but only in those circumstances,''
Gen. Anthony Zinni told the official Kuwait News Agency during a
brief unannounced visit Saturday.
<p>
   ``We are just staying ready and paying attention to what is
going on,'' Zinni added.
<p>
   Some 30,000 U.S. troops are deployed in the Gulf region plus
7,000 more in Kuwait. Kuwait opened its air bases to 12 U.S. F-117s
stealth fighters and eight British Tornado bombers that could be
used in a military strike against Iraq.
<p>
   The threat of a strike was averted after Baghdad signed a deal
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday to give weapons
inspectors unfettered access to all suspected sites.
<p>
   The United States led an international coalition against Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Two dissidents have petitioned China's
legislature for improved human rights and the release of political
prisoners, even as police rounded up other activists who issued
similar appeals, a human rights group said Sunday.
<p>
   The petitions from Zeng Ning, a veteran activist from southern
Guizhou province, and Liu Xianbin from neighboring Sichuan province
were the latest in a stream of appeals from pro-democracy activists
ahead of the legislature's annual meeting, which opens Thursday.

   A third activist, Xu Wenli, also issued an appeal Sunday urging
authorities to stop harassing dissidents.

Greene wins pro handicap race
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  World 100-meter champion Maurice Greene
was not given the chance to continue his recent dominance over
world record holder Donovan Bailey on the track  &MD;  but he kept
chipping away at the Canadian anyway Sunday.
<p>
   Greene, who set a world indoor 60-meter record earlier this
year, continued a successful start to his outdoor campaign with
victory in the Botany Bay Gift on Sunday.
<p>
   Greene easily won the Melbourne and Sydney Grand Prix meets in
the past week but Bailey, third in Melbourne, withdrew from
Saturday's Sydney meet citing a bruised heel.
<p>
   Greene questioned Bailey's motives Saturday, saying, ``He just
didn't feel up to running tonight. If I didn't think I was going to
win I wouldn't have run either.''
<p>
   The American, who says he is aiming to beat Bailey's world
record 9.84 seconds with a 9.76 run sometime this year, was not
about to turn down the heat on Bailey.
<p>
   ``It's sad that Donovan has taken my running so personal, but if
that's how he's going to take it, that's it,'' said Greene.
<p>
   ``I like running against him because he always brings out the
best in me and I'm going to continue to run fast and keep making
him mad at me.''
<p>
   Greene won Sunday's 120-meter handicap race off scratch with

Ukrainian President oversees regional trade agreement
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Winding up a four-day state visit to Russia on
Sunday, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma proclaimed an end to what
he called the trade war between the two countries.
<p>
   Kuchma attended the signing of a protocol on trade between
Ukraine and the Kemerovo region of western Siberia. According to
the agreement, signed by Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Golubchenko and Kemerovo Governor Aman Tuleyev, the region
will provide coal, rails, drilling equipment, chemical and
electrical engineering goods to Ukraine, Russian news agencies
reported.
<p>
   In return, Ukraine will supply the region with cars and buses,
food, light-industry goods and feed grains.
<p>
   Ukraine and the Kuzbass region of Kemerovo are intending to
jointly produce electricity, using Kuzbass coal to fire Ukrainian
electric plants, the Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   Kuchma told business leaders in the city of Kemerovo that
Ukraine had lost dlrs 3 billion in trade with Russia last year due
to restrictions that made Ukrainian goods uncompetitive, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
<p>
   He said that the 10-year trade development agreement he signed
Friday with President Boris Yeltsin had stopped the ```trade war,'
in which there was more politics in the past than economy,''
according to ITAR-Tass. Kuchma said the agreement should help
stabilize Ukraine's economy.

India plan targets 7 percent GDP growth until 2002
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  India will target a seven percent
average annual growth rate until the year 2002, the nation's
Planning Commission said Sunday.
<p>
   The country expects private capital to play a major role in
ensuring the growth of its Gross Domestic Product, Planning
Commission Chairman Madhu Dandavate told reporters after releasing
the draft of a five-year planning blueprint.
<p>
   ``Because of inadequate capital, large unemployment and wide
technological gaps in some sectors, India's economy should
harmonize the roles of the state, the market and the
co-operatives'' to achieve this growth, he said.
<p>
   ``Foreign investment will be welcome, particularly in sectors
with large technological gaps,'' said Dandavate.
<p>
   India's GDP grew by 7.5 percent during the 1996-97 fiscal year
that ended March 31, led by a 7.9 percent growth of the farm
sector.
<p>
   But the government's own estimates indicate that GDP growth
during 1997-98, may be much lower at around five percent.
Independent analysts say that assessment is optimistic.
<p>
   ``But this shouldn't be seen in isolation, as the potential for
an average seven percent growth over five years still exists,''
Dandavate said, releasing a draft of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The
Commission draws up long-term and short-term plans to be
implemented by federal and state governments and allocates finances
to states for projects.
<p>
   Growth projections were lowered after more than two years of
political instability that has almost halted an ambitious free
market program. Most balloting has just ended for a general
election that is likely to produce yet another coalition
government.
<p>
   In the last two years, foreign direct investment has dried up,
stalling plans to modernize India's outdated telecommunications
systems, ports and roads.
<p>
   On Sunday, Dandavate said a growth rate of seven percent would
require an investment over five years of 22.05 trillion rupees
(dlrs 550 billion), of which one-third is expected to come from the
state and the rest from private sources.
<p>
   The draft plan said the government would promote a commercial
outlook among state-run companies, attract private capital in
infrastructure, encourage competition and set up regulatory
agencies to fix tariffs, conserve resources, safeguard consumer
interests and protect the environment.

Commander in Gulf says U.S. forces to stay as long as it takes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  U.S. forces will remain in Kuwait as long as it
takes to ensure Iraq complies with a deal over weapons inspection,
the U.S. commander in the Gulf was quoted as saying Sunday.
<p>
   ``The use of military force is an option we will use if we don't
get compliance and cooperation, but only in those circumstances,''
Gen. Anthony Zinni told the official Kuwait News Agency during a
brief unannounced visit Saturday.
<p>
   ``We are just staying ready and paying attention to what is
going on,'' Zinni added.
<p>
   Some 30,000 U.S. troops are deployed in the Gulf region in
addition to another 7,000 posted in Kuwait, where 12 U.S. F-117s
stealth fighters and eight British Tornado bombers that could be
used in a military strike against Iraq are based.
<p>
   The threat of a strike was averted after Baghdad signed a deal
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday to give weapons
inspectors unfettered access to all suspected sites.
<p>
   The United States led an international coalition against Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)  &MD;  Five people were shot dead and six
wounded in the southern Somalia port of Kismayu during a gun battle
over khat, a stimulant chewed by Somali males, according to reports
Sunday.
<p>
   The fighting Saturday began when members of the Dhulbahante
subclan opened fired on a light airplane bringing khat from
neighboring Kenya. One person was killed and three wounded.
<p>
   The plane had been chartered by a member of the Ogaden sub-clan,
who retaliated, killing four Dhulbahantes and wounding three
others, said a source reached by high frequency radio.
<p>
   It was impossible to immediately ascertain what sparked the
fighting, but the khat business if very lucrative. It is common for
militiamen to try and seize khat consignments from Kenya, where the
leafy plant is commercially grown.
<p>
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said elders met
Sunday to mediate among the clansmen and tension remained high.
<p>
   Somalia has had no central government since the late dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by a rebel force in 1991. The country
has disintegrated into fiefdoms guarded by armed clan militias.

Flash floods in southern Afghanistan kill 30, injure 300
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP)  &MD;  Flash floods roared through southern
Afghanistan killing at least 30 people and leaving another 300
people injured, officials of the ruling Taliban militia and aid
workers said Sunday.
<p>
   Relentless rains over the past week caused severe flooding in
several poor farming villages in the provinces of Kandahar,
Helmand, Zabul and Nimroz, officials said.
<p>
   ``Three districts in Kandahar were completely inundated this
week, killing 20 people and destroying dozens of homes,'' said
Ahmed, a Taliban spokesman in Kandahar contacted by telephone. Like
many Afghans, Ahmed uses only one name.
<p>
   He said at least 10 more people died in neighboring provinces
when floods washed away roads and destroyed the area's few
communications systems.
<p>
   ``The people there are experiencing great hardships,'' he said.
<p>
   The skies cleared on Saturday and Ahmed said, ``we are not
expecting any further casualties.''
<p>
   United Nations officials in neighboring Pakistan say they have
received reports that about 300 people have been hospitalized with
injuries suffered in the flash floods.
<p>
   Scores more people are suffering from respiratory and stomach
ailments, the result of inadequate shelter and clean drinking
water, the officials said.
<p>
   The United Nations, the Red Cross and other foreign aid agencies
working in southwest Afghanistan are pooling supplies to provide
temporary shelter, food, water purification kits and rehydration
salts, they said.
<p>
   War-ravaged Afghanistan has been battered by natural disasters
this winter. Last month's magnitude-6.1 earthquake in northeast
Takhar province killed at least 5,000 people and left as many as
30,000 homeless.
<p>
   Bad weather, poor roads and civil war conspired to delay
emergency aid supplies from reaching quake victims in the isolated
mountain area for almost a week.
<p>
   Another tragedy is the severe food shortages in central Bamyan
province, creating another logistical nightmare for aid agencies.
<p>
   The Taliban, which controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan, is
battling a northern-based alliance of opposition forces that
control the remaining 15 percent of the country.

Senior U.S. official to visit Seoul to discuss Korean peace talks
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  &MD;  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Charles Kartman will visit Seoul this week for consultations
on joint U.S.-South Korea policy toward North Korea, the Foreign
Ministry said Sunday.
<p>
   During a four-day stay starting Monday, Kartman will meet with
presidential national security adviser Lim Dong-won and Deputy
Foreign Minister Song Young-shik, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee
Kyu-hyung said.
<p>
   The meetings are aimed at coordinating strategy between Seoul
and Washington for a second round of Korean peace talks in Geneva
involving the two Koreas, the United States and China, he said.
<p>
   The Geneva talks are to start March 16.
<p>
   After more than a year of hard negotiations, the four countries
opened full-dress talks in Geneva in early December but failed to
make progress on the agenda and other issues.
<p>
   North Korea insisted that withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea be high on the agenda. The United States
and South Korea said the issue can be discussed only as part of a
broad agenda.
<p>
   The Geneva talks are aimed at ensuring a permanent peace on the
divided Korean Peninsula, whose two sides technically are still at
war. The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not in a peace
treaty.
<p>
   The United States fought on South Korea's side and China on
North Korea's side in the Korean War.

Japan's Ojima beats defending champion Fiz of Spain
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OHTSU, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Japan's Muneyuki Ojima spurted ahead in the
last seven kilometers (4.2 miles) Sunday and won the Biwako
Mainichi Marathon, 50 seconds ahead of defending champion Martin
Fiz of Spain.
<p>
   The 22-year-old Ojima covered the 42.195 kilometers (26 miles,
385 yards) in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 43 seconds.
<p>
   Fiz, who set the meet record of 2:08:05 last year, was second in
2:09:33.
<p>
   The next six finishers were Japanese. Koji Shimizu was third in
2:09:57, Hiroshi Miki fourth in 2:10:01 and Takayuki Ojima, the
winner's younger brother, fifth in 2:12:43.
<p>
   After 29 kilometers (17 miles), the leading group had been
narrowed down to seven, including the Ojima brothers, Fiz and Fred
Kiprop of Kenya. After another six kilometers (3.6 miles), Muneyuki
Ojima made his move.
<p>
   ``I feared Fiz's finishing kick. If possible, I hoped to make a
1-2 finish with my brother,'' said Ojima.
<p>
   Fiz, who finished fourth in the 1996 Olympics, said, ``I
couldn't catch the top runner because of winds'' in the later
stages.
<p>
   Kiprop faded and finished 42nd in 2:19:28.
<p>
   Andre Ramos of Brazil, Silvio Guerra of Ecuador, Steven Brooks
of Britain and Joaquim Pinheiro of Portugal dropped out during the
race, but the reasons were not immediatley known.
<p>
   A field of 160 runners, including 10 non-Japanese, competed in
rain and 8.5-degree Celsius (47 F) temperatures.

Cathay Pacific flies through North Korean airspace
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Cathay Pacific on Sunday became the first
airline from a non-communist territory in more than 50 years to fly
through North Korean airspace.
<p>
   The flight came one month after North Korea and the
International Air Transport Association agreed to open North Korean
airspace for commercial overflights.
<p>
   Such flights could give the cash-strapped country another source
of hard currency, while saving outside airlines time and fuel
costs.
<p>
   A Boeing 747-400 cargo plane of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific
left Anchorage, Alaska, on Saturday and flew in a North Korean air
corridor for 20 minutes before arriving in Hong Kong Sunday, the
airline said in a statement.
<p>
   The flight was ``a big step closer to establishing regular
operations along this route,'' said the jet's captain, Paul
Horsting.
<p>
   U.S. carriers Delta and United Airlines, South Korea's Korean
Air and Singapore Airlines also were to try out the route later
this week.
<p>
   The flights will not go over North Korean land, but off the east
coast of the reclusive communist state.

South Africa 37-1 chasing 255 to win
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  South Africa was 37 for one at lunch
on the fourth day as its chased 255 runs to win the second cricket
against Pakistan at Kingsmead on Sunday.
<p>
   Despite losing Adam Bacher in the second over, fellow opener
Gary Kirsten found touch with a solid but lucky 21 not out and put
on 35 with Jacques Kallis, unbeaten on 14, after Pakistan was
bowled out for 226.
<p>
   The Pakistan innings lasted just eight deliveries as medium
paceman Shaun Pollock finished with 6-50, his fourth five-wicket
haul in a 18-match career. Pollock finished with a match haul of
8-105.
<p>
   Resuming on 222 for eight, Mushtaq Ahmed hit a boundary and then
ran himself out for 20 runs. Pollock then claimed Fazal-e-Akbar as
the No. 11 holed out to Lance Klusener at mid on.
<p>
   With the pitch playing the odd trick at times and the threat of
a wily Ahmed looming, South Africa will forced dig deep to take a
one nil lead in this three-match series.
<p>
   Kirsten, survived a catch on 21 when acting captain Aamir Sohail
failed to latch onto a drive at extra cover in medium paceman Azhar
Mahmood's second over.

Khmer Rouge blasts Cambodian leader's cease-fire proposal
Eds: UPDATES with anti-war rally, ADDS byline
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Khmer Rouge guerrillas denounced
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's cease-fire proposal Sunday as an
``obvious trick'' aimed at wiping out resistance forces battling
his troops in northern Cambodia.
<p>
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Khmer Rouge said that
resistance forces loyal to deposed co-prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh would have their ``throats slit'' if they agreed to Hun
Sen's cease-fire terms.
<p>
   ``He ordered them to hand their armed forces over to him, to
stop the resistance, to give him their weapons and to get down on
their knees to confess in surrender to the Yuon communists and Hun
Sen the puppet,'' the broadcast said.
<p>
   ``The trick is so obvious,'' it added.
<p>
   Yuon is a derogatory term for the Vietnamese, who overthrew the
Khmer Rouge in 1979, ending the Maoist-inspired group's nearly four
years of genocidal rule in Cambodia. As many as 2 million
Cambodians died of overwork, starvation, illness or execution under
the Khmer Rouge reign.
<p>
   Ranariddh, who is in exile after his ouster by Hun Sen in a July
coup, formed an armed resistance in northern Cambodia to battle the
Phnom Penh government. His forces have been loosely aligned with
Khmer Rouge guerrillas who detest Hun Sen.
<p>
   For seven months, Hun Sen's army has been trying without success
to dislodge the small resistance force from its stronghold at
O'Smach in northern Cambodia, on the Thai border. Other small
pockets of resistance still exist in other outlying areas.
<p>
   Ranariddh announced Friday that his resistance troops would
adopt a unilateral cease-fire in hopes of forging a peace deal with
Hun Sen.
<p>
   If accepted, it could pave the way for the prince's return to
Cambodia to participate in elections scheduled for July 26.
<p>
   The government immediately came up with its own cease-fire
declaration, though several conditions put forward in the plan are
expected to draw protest from Ranariddh's camp.
<p>
   Under the government's plan, ``extremist'' forces must report
their names, troop numbers, weapons and ammunition, equipment and
positions to newly created regional committees or to the government
army commanders.
<p>
   Resistance commanders also must assure that there are no Khmer
Rouge members in their units and must expel Khmer Rouge forces from
their positions, the government's cease-fire proposal states. In
exchange, they can rejoin the Phnom Penh army.
<p>
   ``They play the cease-fire trick at this time to legitimize
their coup and to crush the resistance forces they have failed to
destroy for 19 years,'' the Khmer Rouge said.
<p>
   The cease-fire was a key element of a peace plan for Cambodia
devised by Japanese diplomats who are attempting to mediate between
the country's warring factions.
<p>
   Meanwhile, some 700 disabled civilians, soldiers and veterans
joined in a ceremony led by prominent dissident leader Sam Rainsy
at his Khmer Nation Party headquarters Sunday.
<p>
   Rainsy, who played an active role in trying to secure the
cease-fire, said the ceremony was to pay tribute to all those who
have been mutilated by land mines or by fighting that has ravaged
the country for nearly three decades.
<p>
   The opposition leader, who received loud cheers of support, said
that war-handicapped citizens in Cambodia numbered about 75,000,
and that they have no specific rights to compensation.

Military regime arrests 40, breaks up alleged terrorist plot
Eds: ADDS reaction from student group
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  Burma's military regime has arrested 40
people it accuses of planning to bomb government buildings and
embassies and assassinate the country's leaders.
<p>
   A government spokesman, Col. Kyaw Thein, said Sunday the plot
was masterminded by the All Burma Students Democratic Front, made
up of former students who fled the suppression of a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988.
<p>
   He said that among those arrested in January was law graduate Ko
Thein, described as the leader of a plot to ``undermine public
confidence in the government.''
<p>
   Kyaw Thein, a member of the regime's information committee, told
a news conference that the student insurgents were linked to the
party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
<p>
   He said two members of her National League for Democracy, Myo
Thant and Pol Khwa, had established contact with the student group
and gone underground last November.
<p>
   Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has stressed that she
is seeking a non-violent way to bring democracy to Burma.
<p>
   A spokesman for the students' front, Aung Naing Oo, said the
group had given up armed struggle last year and was now seeking
change in Burma through ``non-violent, political defiance.''
<p>
   ``We didn't have anything to do with this. It's the usual
military propaganda,'' he said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press in Bangkok.
<p>
   Kyaw Thein said no action has been taken against Suu Kyi's party
but that the regime wanted to ``highlight NLD's obvious link with
the illegal organization.''
<p>
   Fuses concealed in cigarettes and some explosives that the
colonel said were seized from Ko Thein were exhibited at the
special news conference.
<p>
   The military officer said the insurgents were hoping to place
bombs at government buildings and embassies of members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has taken a generally
pro-regime stance and accepted Burma into the economic grouping.
<p>
   Thein Tun, described as the leader of the student front's ``Unit
207,'' entered Burma from the Thai border area last December after
earlier receiving training in explosives from the Karen National
Union, an ethnic minority rebel group also fighting the central
government.
<p>
   The spokesman did not say when the group would be tried.

Two Russian border guards wounded in Tajikistan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Two Russian border guards were wounded in
Tajikistan on Sunday by gunfire from Afghanistan, according to a
Russian news agency report.
<p>
   Russian border guard officials said the shooting was in response
to the seizure early Saturday of 54 kilograms (119 pounds) of
heroin along the Tajik-Afghan border, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. Russian border guards shot two suspected drug traffickers,
killing one.
<p>
   The surviving members of the armed group retreated into
Afghanistan, leaving behind 80 kilograms (176 pounds) of drugs,
including the heroin, border guards spokesman Col. Nikolai
Kondratiev said Saturday. He put the value of the heroin alone at
dlrs 30 million.
<p>
   Tajikistan has become a key conduit for drugs pouring into
Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. Many of the
shipments originate in Afghanistan.
<p>
   Russia has deployed around 25,000 troops to back Tajikistan's
hard-line government and try to prevent incursions by guerrillas
and drug smugglers.

<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Election officials Sunday carried sealed
ballot boxes to heavily guarded locations across the nation to
prepare for the counting of votes, the last phase of a staggered
election for India's next government.
<p>
   Counting begins at 8.00 a.m. (0230 GMT) Monday in the presence
of representatives of candidates.
<p>
   More than 300 million of India's 600 million voters have cast
ballots in the election, which was staggered to give security
forces time to move across a country where religious, ethnic and
caste difference often erupt into violence.
<p>
   But there was violence on each of the five voting days since
Feb. 16. On Saturday, eight people were killed in election-related
violence, bringing the death toll to at least 76.
<p>
   Saturday's voting completed the election for all but six of the
543 contested seats in Parliament. Vote counting begins before the
final districts go to the polls on March 7.
<p>
   Of all the 26 states, elections in the state of Bihar in eastern
India have been most violent. The Election Commission had to
conduct fresh balloting in nearly 5,000 of the 82,000 voting
stations in ths state known for its lawlessness.
<p>
   Counting in the state will take place in centers guarded by
armed federal policemen and under the scrutiny of video cameras,
the Commission ordered, fearing attempts at tampering from
candidates or their supporters.
<p>
   Several thousand extra armed guards were also deployed in areas
of the northeastern states where separatist rebels had tried to
enforce a poll boycott.
<p>
   Although the first results are not expected until late Monday,
trends from the counting will start trickling in from most of the
543 contested seats by late afternoon.
<p>
   No single party is expected to win an outright majority in Lok
Sabha, the powerful lower house of Parliament.
<p>
   Two exit polls released on Saturday indicated strong support for
Hindu nationalists.
<p>
   A state-by-state exit poll broadcast on the government-run
television showed the Bharatiya Janata Party and allies getting 244
seats, making gains in almost every corner of the country, but
falling short of the majority needed for a government.
<p>
   The second poll, shown on a private TV channel, said the BJP
would get 208 seats and the Congress Party, that led India for 45
of its 50 years since independence, 167 seats.
<p>
   After the results are declared the president selects a party,
usually the one with the largest number of seats, to form the new
government. That party has to prove that it enjoys support of most
federal lawmakers within a few days of the installation of the
government.

Hamas militants go on trial in Israel
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was brought before judges.
<p>
   Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
<p>
   Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court was to extend the detention of Mohammed
Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem
accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
<p>
   Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
<p>
   According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court was to extend the detention of Mohammed
Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem
accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
<p>
   Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
<p>
   According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

Alleged Mossad target hasn't lived at home for four years
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  The apparent target of a Mossad operation in
Switzerland hasn't lived in the apartment Israeli agents tried to
bug for four years, his estranged wife said in an interview with an
Israeli newspaper published Sunday.
<p>
   Five Mossad agents were caught trying to bug a small apartment
block in the Bern suburb of Liebefeld. The disclosure of the
operation embarrassed the Mossad, which has had a string of public
foul-ups recently, and strained relations between Israel and
Switzerland.
<p>
   The target was reportedly Abdallah El-Zein, a Lebanese immigrant
whose wife, Patrizia Vanini, lives in the building.
<p>
   ``We've lived apart for four years and for four years he hasn't
lived here,'' Vanini told the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. ``I don't
know where the (Mossad) got their information. It was incorrect.''
<p>
   Vanini said she was still in touch with El-Zein and had seen him
a week before the break-in when he came to visit her brother.
Vanini said she had been unable to reach El-Zein, a used car
salesman, then.
<p>
   Vanini described El-Zein as an observant Muslim who attended
mosque and Friday prayers. She said the two had split up over a
decision to have children. ``He wanted a child to receive a strict
Muslim education and I refused,'' she said.
<p>
   There has been no official confirmation of the target of the
operation. Swiss and Israeli media have speculated that the target
was an Islamic militant  &MD;  either a member of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah group or the radical Palestinian Hamas movement.
<p>
   Asked if her husband had connections to either group, Vanini
said, ``I don't know anything about that.''

BC-Hong Kong-Colonial Residence
Former colonial residence loses glamour with British governor gone

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Keeping a colonial tradition, the government
opened the sprawling residence of former governors to the public
this weekend. But the low turnout brought new calls for finding a
better use for the landmark building.
<p>
   Only about 30,000 people visited Government House to admire its
garden's blooming azaleas during the two-day annual public opening,
the first since China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong from
Britain last July.
<p>
   The number pales against the 100,000 who queued for hours to
enter the building when the last colonial governor, Chris Patten,
threw open the doors of the two-story residence and office compound
near downtown Hong Kong last year.
<p>
   ``This place just isn't the same without the British,'' Xan
Chow, a government worker, said Sunmday. ``It's just like any other
house.''
<p>
   ``It doesn't look British at all,'' said a child at the entrance
foyer, which was decorated with a Chinese flag, a Hong Kong city
flag and two Chinese paintings.
<p>
   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa decided to abandon the tradition
of living and working in Government House when he took power and
chose instead to stay in his apartment in a high-rise building.
<p>
   The government now uses the former colonial residence only
occasionally for official functions and some charitable events.
Critics say it is a waste of public funds to maintain the building
and its employees.
<p>
   ``This is such a waste of money and space,'' said Pat Lai,
touring the gardens with her two children.
<p>
   In a recent poll by the mass-circulation newspaper Apple Daily,
more than half of the 439 respondents wanted the building turned
into a museum of Hong Kong's colonial history.
<p>
   Brianne Tse, on her first visit to the house, said it should be
open to public as a museum because ``the property belongs to the
taxpayers,'' and ``there's so much history and great sentimental
value for all Hong Kong people.''
<p>
   She said Hong Kong's flagging tourism industry could also
benefit from a new attraction.
<p>
   Government House was built in 1885. It was remodeled in later
years by, among others, the Japanese, who occupied Hong Kong during
World War II.

Paper: U.N. human rights chief prevented from meeting Khatami
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  A meeting between the U.N. human rights
chief and President Mohammad Khatami was canceled after officials
learned she planned to discuss Iran's poor human rights record, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
<p>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, was
scheduled to meet Khatami, but the meeting was canceled after her
spokesman spelled out in a BBC radio interview Saturday what she
wanted to discuss, the Farda daily said.
<p>
   It did not say when Robinson had been scheduled to meet with
Khatami.
<p>
   The paper quoted Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Javad
Zarif, as saying that Robinson was in Tehran for the sole purpose
of attending a U.N. seminar on human rights, and not to discuss
allegations against Iran.
<p>
   ``The purpose of Ms. Robinson's visit was not about discussing
human rights accusations against Iran, and no such discussions have
taken place,'' the paper quoted Zarif as saying.
<p>
   He said there would be no meeting with Khatami.
<p>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday quoted
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a meeting with
Robinson that Western charges of human rights violations in Iran
were politically motivated.
<p>
   ``What the opposition groups abroad and hostile mass media
disseminate about Iran on human rights contradict realities inside
the country,'' IRNA quoted Kharrazi as saying.
<p>
   International human rights organizations accuse Iran of
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture, harsh prison
conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and
restrictions on basic freedoms.
<p>
   Iran denies the accusations, saying its Islamic laws and
punishments should not be judged by Western standards.
<p>
   Robinson arrived in Tehran Saturday.

Burmese military leader promises new government, democracy
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  A top Burmese leader has promised a group
of American executives that a multiparty democracy will emerge in
the military-controlled country and said he hoped relations with
the United States would improve, official newspapers reported
Sunday.
<p>
   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, a senior member of the ruling military
council, was speaking to members of the Young Presidents
Organization visiting Burma. The date of the meeting was not given.
<p>
   The general said a national convention drawing up guidelines for
a new constitution had completed 50 percent of its work.
<p>
   ``The new government that will emerge according to the new
constitution will lead the country to multiparty democracy and a
market economy,'' he said.
<p>
   The convention, which began its work in 1993, has been in recess
since March 1996. Draft provisions already completed would leave
decisive power with the military, which has ruled Burma since 1962.
<p>
   Khin Nyunt told the group, made up of presidents and senior
executives of American companies, that Burma and the United States
traditionally enjoyed friendly ties.
<p>
   He said the present strain in relations was temporary, but
expressed regret that the United States had imposed some economic
sanctions on his country. He said they had minimal impact.
<p>
   The United States has strongly denounced Burma for human rights
abuses and the repression of a pro-democracy movement led by Nobel
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
<p>
   The military violently put down a pro-democracy uprising in
1988, later annulled the results of a general election and set up a
convention to draft a constitution under military guidance.

Belarusian teens sentenced for vandalism in politicized case
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP)  &MD;  A high-school student convicted last week
in a case assailed by human rights advocates and foreign
governments alike vowed Sunday to continue his involvement in
politics.
<p>
   Vadim Labkovich, 16, and Alexei Shidlovsky, 19, were sentenced
Tuesday to 1 1/2 years in prison for hooliganism and desecrating
the national flag. Shidlovsky is in detention pending appeal, but
Labkovich got a suspended sentence. Officials said he won't go to
prison if he stays within the law for the next two years.
<p>
   The two were accused of being among a group of young people who
took down a current, Soviet-style red Belarusian flag and replaced
it with a previous version favored by nationalists.
<p>
   They were also charged with throwing paint on monuments to
Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Felix Dzherzhinsky and writing
slogans on public buildings that were ``insulting to public
morality.''
<p>
   Both belong to the youth wing of the Belarusian Popular Front,
the leading opposition group.
<p>
   ``You can't help but be involved in politics in this country,''
Labkovich said Sunday, at home in Minsk with his mother Yadviga and
9-year-old brother Valery.
<p>
   ``Otherwise, people would be thrown into prison one after the
other.''
<p>
   Labkovich was in detention for seven months awaiting trial. He
said he had shared cells with teen-age criminals, mostly thieves.
<p>
   Unlike Shidlovsky, who lawyers say was badly beaten in jail,
Labkovich encountered no violence.
<p>
   But he said he feared a bit for his sanity, ``because what is
going on there has no association with the outside world.
<p>
   ``Each day resembles the next, and it could drive you mad,'' he
said.
<p>
   In jail, Labkovich learned to walk like the other prisoners,
with his hands clasped behind his back and his head down.
<p>
   His mother said that while he hadn't yet recovered from his time
in jail, ``psychologically he is not broken.''
<p>
   ``My son is not guilty, and I'm very proud of him,'' she said.
<p>
   Labkovich's ambition is to become a historian, though his family
wonders whether authorities would allow him to enter Belarus State
University.
<p>
   He returned to school on Saturday, where he was warmly welcomed
by his teachers and schoolmates, his mother said.
<p>
   Many had attended the trial, where Labkovich had been handcuffed
and put in a cage along with Shidlovsky, surrounded by guards.
<p>
   In a statement released after Tuesday's verdict, Holly Cartner
of Human Rights Watch called the trial a ``grotesque show trial
aimed at intimidating young people from expressing opposition to
the current regime in Belarus.''
<p>
   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a devoted admirer of
the Soviet system, has kept a firm grip on the former Soviet
republic of 10 million. Using sweeping powers he gained in a
referendum, he has replaced the previous parliament with a new,
handpicked one, and passed laws restricting freedoms of assembly
and the press.
<p>
   Despite criticism from the Belarusian opposition and abroad,
Lukashenko has enjoyed broad popular support as many Belarusians
share his nostalgia for Soviet-era stability.

Taiwan's Nationalists maintain dominance in council speaker polls
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  The governing Nationalist Party maintained
its usual dominance in elections for local assembly leaders Sunday,
amid allegations of vote buying and gang intimidation.
<p>
   The Nationalists won 21 of 23 speaker posts and 19 vice speaker
positions, maintaining their grip on the assemblies that are
responsible for reviewing budgets and overseeing government at the
city and county level.
<p>
   The Nationalists hold 598 of the 890 assembly deputy seats.
<p>
   The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which holds
113 assembly seats, captured two vice speaker positions. Other
races were won by independents.
<p>
   Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said his office has received
reports of vote buying and intimidation of deputies in almost all
races, and promised investigations would continue after the
elections.
<p>
   Liao has said he estimates up to two-thirds of the 890 deputies
are gangsters or have close gangland connections.
<p>
   Taiwan has sought to clean up its political culture, and the
enforcement of tougher laws has forced vote buying underground.
<p>
   But city and county assemblies are dominated by local business
alliances and political machines allied with the Nationalists, and
laws are considered to have had little effect in reducing vote
buying's effectiveness when assembly members elect their officers.
<p>
   Mass vote buying was alleged in elections for speakers and vice
speakers four years ago, leading to scores of deputies being
indicted on fraud charges.

   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  U.S. forces will remain in Kuwait as long as it
takes to ensure Iraq complies with a deal over weapons inspection,
the U.S. commander in the Gulf was quoted as saying Sunday.
<p>
   ``The use of military force is an option we will use if we don't
get compliance and cooperation, but only in those circumstances,''
Gen. Anthony Zinni told the official Kuwait News Agency during a
brief unannounced visit Saturday.
<p>
   ``We are just staying ready and paying attention to what is
going on,'' Zinni added.
<p>
   More than 30,000 U.S. troops are deployed in the Gulf region,
including 7,000 in Kuwait. Kuwait opened its air bases to 12 U.S.
F-117s stealth fighters and eight British Tornado bombers that
could be used in a military strike against Iraq.
<p>
   The threat of a strike was averted after Baghdad signed a deal
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday to give weapons
inspectors unfettered access to all suspected sites.
<p>
   The United States led an international coalition against Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Iraqis collect full ration for March
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3 and 4 with comments by U.N. official.
By EILEEN ALT POWELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  Iraqis on Sunday began collecting their
rations for March, which were at the full level called for by the
United Nations for the first time in six months.
<p>
   Delays in the delivery of foodstuffs, especially baby milk, had
forced Iraq to reduce rations in previous months.
<p>
   Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian operation in
Iraq, said a full ration was available in March because ``there has
been more regularity in arrivals (of goods) thanks to changes in
the process.''
<p>
   He said it ``is the expectation'' that Iraqis also will get full
rations in the next few months. But he added there could be
unanticipated disruptions if there are delays in collecting oil
revenue or in U.N. approval of food contracts.
<p>
   U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, have seriously damaged Iraq's economy. Depreciation of the
Iraqi currency and rising prices have put food and other
necessities out of the reach of many.
<p>
   The United Nations launched the oil-for-food program in December
1996 to help the country cope. It allows Iraq to sell dlrs 2
billion worth of oil over a six-month period to buy needed medicine
and food, which is distributed in monthly ration to all 22 million
Iraqis.
<p>
   Starting Sunday, Iraqis were receiving 9 kilograms (19.8 pounds)
of flour, 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) of rice, 2 kilograms (4.4
pounds) of sugar, 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pulses, 1 kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of cooking oil, 150 grams of tea (5.25 ounces) , 150
grams (5.25) of salt, 250 grams (8.75 ounces) of soap and 350 grams
(12.25 ounces) of detergent.
<p>
   Families with babies were eligible for 2.7 kilograms (nearly 6
pounds) of powered milk.
<p>
   The last time the full ration was available was in September,
according to the office of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in
Iraq.
<p>
   Last month, tea, salt and baby milk were in short supply.
<p>
   Iraq has repeatedly blamed the United States and Britain for the
shortages, saying that they have held up contracts at the United
Nations. The United States and Britain have denied the allegations.
<p>
   U.N. surveys indicate that the oil-for-food program has helped
ease some of the problems here.
<p>
   But one in three Iraqi children still suffer from malnutrition,
and the ration lacks important animal protein such as cheese which
is needed for proper development.
<p>
   Last month, the U.N. Security Council agreed to more than double
the oil-for-food program to dlrs 5.2 billion for six months.
<p>
   But Iraq's oil minister, Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid, said
Saturday that the country would only be able to sell about dlrs 4
billion in crude every six months. He said that even this would
require an infusion of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's oil
facilities.
<p>
   Denis Halliday, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, told
reporters Saturday that a special U.N. team would visit Baghdad
soon to assess the oil industry and determine if needed spare parts
and other equipment could be funded with oil-for-food money.
<p>
   He noted that an increase to sales of dlrs 4 billion still
represented a 100 percent rise.
<p>
   ``That is pretty good,'' Halliday said. ``It's a good
beginning.''

Turkey gathers Caspian Sea oil producers for pipeline talks
By YALMAN ONARAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  A meeting of oil-producing countries of
the Caspian Sea started Sunday with cautious support for a pipeline
through Turkey.
<p>
   However, participants appeared divided on other issues related
to the exploitation and transportation of the oil, especially
regarding the role of their Russia and the sharing of the Caspian
basin.
<p>
   Hoping to cash in on the oil and natural gas reserves of the
Caspian, estimated to be second only to the Middle East, Turkey
managed to bring together Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan
to see whether it could win political commitment to its pipeline
proposal. Georgia joined the meeting as another transit route
candidate.
<p>
   In their opening remarks, foreign ministers talked of varying
levels of support for the Turkish proposal  &MD;  bringing oil and gas
from Azerbaijan's capital on the Caspian, Baku, to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
<p>
   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem would not say whether
Russia, absent at the meeting, had been invited.
<p>
   Russia has Caspian shoreline and is involved in several pipeline
projects to carry the region's oil to western markets.
<p>
   Russia and Turkey have been vying for influence on Central Asia
since the breakup of the Soviet Union, but recently Turkey has
shifted to a more conciliatory approach, arguing the two could both
have economic gains from the region.
<p>
   ``I believe we need to have close cooperation with two countries
not here today, Russia and the United States,'' Cem said,
suggesting that they are invited join future meetings.
<p>
   American oil companies are active in exploration and early
production in the region. Washington has leaned heavily toward
favoring Turkey in the transportation of the oil and as recently as
last week voiced strong support for Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
<p>
   Azerbaijan's acting Foreign Minister Araz Azimov was not so keen
on Russia's possible participation.
<p>
   ``We should not be taken hostage by certain powers as in the
past,'' he said. ``To add Russia to the group is premature.''
<p>
   Kazakh Foreign Minister Kassymzhomart Tokayev emphasized the
importance of ``overcoming the dependency on Russia'' but also said
his country was determined to carry at least some of its oil
through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
<p>
   Azimov, Tokayev and their Turkmen counterpart, Boris Sihmuradov,
discussed possible sharing of the Caspian area as well.
<p>
   Turkey hopes to conclude the meeting Monday with a joint
declaration of political commitment to the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline,
but it ws unclear it that will happen.
<p>
   ``Baku-Ceyhan is a good possibility, but preference will be
given to the project with best economic chances,'' said Tokayev.

Report: Syria wants to resume peace talks with Israel
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Syria is sending signals that it wants to renew
long-stalled peace talks with Israel, the Maariv newspaper said
Sunday.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
signalled its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comment last week that
Israel was willing to withdraw its troops from Lebanon ``with the
necessary security safeguards'' was a response to the Syrian
signals, Maariv said.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years.

Murder investigation underway in killings of two Swedish tourists
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Police said Sunday they had no leads
in the killings of two Swedish tourists who were shot in their room
at a coastal resort.
<p>
   The bodies of Anders Fransson, 47, and Jan Anderson, 34, both of
Kalmar, were found by a housekeeper on Saturday in their room at
the Bronze Bay resort on the Indian Ocean coast north of Durban.
<p>
   Their wallets had been emptied and their rental car was missing,
said police Director Bala Naidoo.
<p>
   There was no sign of forced entry. It appeared their killer, or
killers, entered their third-floor room either through their
balcony door  &MD;  there is an outdoor staircase nearby  &MD;  or had been
allowd inside through the front door, Naidoo told The Associated
Press.
<p>
   The two men had apparently arrived in Cape Town on Feb. 15 from
Sweden and had run in the Cape Town Marathon on Feb. 22. The bronze
medals they had won in the race were found in their room, Naidoo
said.
<p>
   Fransson's body was found in bed with a bullet wound in the
head. Anderson's body, with a bullet wound in the chest, was found
on the floor.
<p>
   Last December, a German tourist was stabbed to death in front of
his two children on New Year's Eve on Durban's beachfront.
<p>
   The killing was one of several highly publicized murders over
the holiday season, including the shooting deaths of an American
tourist and his South African companion in Cape Town.
<p>
   However, Naidoo said foreign tourists should not be overly
concerned about their own safety following the double murder.
<p>
   ``We're looking at this as an isolated incident,'' Naidoo said.

Japan beats South Korea 2-1, China downs Hong Kong 1-0
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Japan beat South Korea 2-1 on Shoji Jo's
last-minute goal, and China downed Hong Kong 1-0 in rain and snow
Sunday in the opening matches of the four-nation Dynasty Cup soccer
tournament.
<p>
   Before about 60,000 spectators in the International Stadium
Yokohama, newly built for the 2002 World Cup, Japan went ahead 1-0
on Masashi Nakayama's header in the 18th minute. But South Korea
tied 1-1 three minutes later when Lee Sang-yoon scored after a pass
from Park Nam-yul.
<p>
   Japan outshot South Korea 17-13.
<p>
   In the second match, Zhang Enhua scored the only goal in the
14th minute of the second half. China outshot Hong Kong 18-4.
<p>
   On Wednesday, Japan meets Hong Kong and South Korea plays China.
<p>
   For the final match on Saturday, the tournament will move to the
60,000-seat National Stadium in Tokyo.
<p>
   The 70,000-seat International Stadium Yokohama was built by the
government of this port city, 29 kilometers (18 miles) south of
Tokyo, at a cost of 60.3 billion yen (dlrs 479 million) for the
2002 World Cup final round.
<p>
   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts for the final round, and
Yokohama is among 10 Japanese cities where games will be played.
<p>
   The stadium, which now is also Japan's largest track and field
stadium in terms of seats, has a roof that protects about
three-fourths of the spectators from rain.
<p>
   The Dynasty Cup champion will receive dlrs 300,000 and the
runner-up dlrs 200,000.

   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  U.S. forces will remain in Kuwait as long as it
takes to ensure Iraq complies with a deal over weapons inspection,
the U.S. commander in the Gulf was quoted as saying Sunday.
<p>
   ``The use of military force is an option we will use if we don't
get compliance and cooperation, but only in those circumstances,''
Gen. Anthony Zinni told the official Kuwait News Agency during a
brief unannounced visit Saturday.
<p>
   ``We are just staying ready and paying attention to what is
going on,'' Zinni added.
<p>
   More than 30,000 U.S. troops are deployed in the Gulf region,
including 7,000 in Kuwait. Kuwait opened its air bases to 12 U.S.
F-117s stealth fighters and eight British Tornado bombers that
could be used in a military strike against Iraq.

Series of quakes jolt northwestern Iran
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Eight moderate earthquakes and dozens of
tremors have rocked northwestern Iran during the past four days,
causing panic among residents but no damage.
<p>
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday that
four quakes had hit the cities of Ardabil, Rudbar and Neer since
Saturday afternoon. Earlier Saturday, the agency reported two
quakes had struck the same region that day.
<p>
   The tremblors, measuring between 3.2 and 4.8, panicked the
inhabitants of some towns and villages, but appeared to cause no
damage.
<p>
   On Thursday night, an earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Ardabil
and was followed an hour late by another measuring 3.8 in the same
area, the agency reported.
<p>
   Iran is prone to earthquakes and experiences scores of small
tremors every year.
<p>
   In February 1997, a tremblor of 6.1-magnitude killed more than
3,000 people in Ardabil.
<p>
   In 1990 Rudbar was destroyed when two quakes hit the city,
killing 50,000 people and leaving half a million homeless.

Burma refuses to pull back troops, second round of talks fails
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A second round of talks between Thai
officers and Burmese forces refusing to leave Thai soil failed
Sunday and the intruders were seen laying mines in the border area.
<p>
   A Thai border official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
as many as 1,000 Burmese soldiers were scattered along the five
kilometers (three miles) between Tong Na village in Thailand's Mae
Hong Son province and the frontier town of Mong Mai in Burma's Shan
state.
<p>
   The Burmese troops are refusing to pull back into Burma,
claiming the area has yet to be demarcated, the official said.
<p>
   The troops crossed into Thailand last Tuesday while pursuing
about 400 Shan rebel soldiers who were escorting villagers seeking
refuge in Thailand from fighting in their homeland.
<p>
   Talks between the Thai army and Burmese officers took place
inside Thailand. But at about the same time, some 30 Burmese
soldiers were spotted by Thai rangers planting land mines on Thai
soil.
<p>
   Fighting between government troops and the Shan State Army broke
out about a week ago inside Burma near the town of Homong, the
former headquarters of opium warlord Khun Sa. Khun Sa, also known
as Chang Qifu, surrendered to the Burmese government in 1996 and is
now thought to be living in Rangoon.
<p>
   The border official said the Burmese troops were planning to
attack guerrillas of the Shan State Army from Thai territory and
forced the civilian refugees, who are about two kilometers (one
mile) from the border, to return to Burma.
<p>
   Disputes over the demarcation of the border, as well as the
presence of Burmese ethnic minority guerrillas, have led to a
number of confrontations, although Thai-Burmese relations are
generally good.

Report: Taiwan vice president visiting UAE
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan flew to
the United Arab Emirates on Sunday on the final leg of a Middle
East tour that has provoked protests from China, media reports
said.
<p>
   Lien, accompanied by his wife, Lien Fang Yu, and a small
entourage, will visit Taiwanese agricultural technicians during his
three-day stay, Taiwan Television reported.
<p>
   Lien's latest stop followed a three-day visit to Bahrain that
included brief meetings with government leaders, the television
network said.
<p>
   The reports said Lien will visit Malaysia before returning to
Taiwan on Saturday.
<p>
   He earlier visited Jordan, where he received an honorary
doctorate in social sciences from a university and reportedly dined
with the country's leader, King Hussein.
<p>
   Lien's visits are being termed unofficial and kept low-key to
avoid provoking China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province
with no right to its own foreign affairs.
<p>
   China is believed to have pressured Lebanon last week into
canceling a visit by Lien.
<p>
   Beijing had also expressed ``strong resentment and regret'' over
Lien's presence in Jordan, saying his visit had harmed
Chinese-Jordanian relations.
<p>
   It accused Jordan of ``openly conniving'' with what it calls
Taiwanese efforts to make the island independent from China. All of
the countries Lien is visiting have diplomatic ties with Beijing.
Taiwan is recognized by just 28 countries.
<p>
   Jordan, keen to maintain strong trade ties with Taiwan, has
previously accepted visits by Taiwanese officials, including
President Lee Teng-Hui in 1995.
<p>
   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven out of
China's mainland by Communist forces in 1949.

Pope thanks Annan for mission in Baghdad
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VATICAN CITY (AP)  &MD;  Pope John Paul II on Sunday praised U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his mission in Baghdad and said he
hoped the risk of an armed conflict over Iraq had been definitely
avoided.
<p>
   Last month, the pope urged the U.N. leader to go to Baghdad to
try to avert an attack on Iraq over the issue of arms inspections.
<p>
   Speaking to pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Square from his
studio window, John Paul said he was offering thanks ``for the
happy conclusion of the Baghdad agreement, in the hope that with it
the danger of recourse to arms has been definitely averted.''
<p>
   ``A particular word of appreciation goes also to the
secretary-general of the U.N. and to all those who, in this
difficult crisis, wanted to believe in the goodwill of men. Their
diplomatic success is certainly a victory of the international
community,'' the pope said.
<p>
   ``The situation remains delicate and complex, but hope is strong
-- may God continue to enlighten all those who have at heart the
fate of the Iraqi people and peace in the Middle East,'' the pope
added.
<p>
   John Paul had made numerous appeals for diplomacy to be employed
to defuse the crisis and has spoken out strongly against the U.N.
embargo against Iraq, denouncing the sanctions as a burden on
innocent civilians.
<p>
   While talking to the public, John Paul took the occasion to
renew his call for either total forgiveness or at least, as he put
it, ``a substantial'' reduction of international debt owed by
developing nations.

Kohl visits France to honor priest who sought reconciliation
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl traveled to France
Sunday to pay homage to a priest who worked for Franco-German
reconciliation after World War I.
<p>
   Fifty years after the death of the German-born Abbey Franz
Stock, Kohl joined Rene Monory, president of the French senate, to
honor the memory of the priest, who died at the age of 43 on Feb.
24, 1948.
<p>
   During the German occupation of France in World War II, Stock
comforted hundreds of French Resistance members who were sentenced
to death by the Germans. After the Liberation, he gave spiritual
aid to German prisoners of war.
<p>
   French President Jacques Chirac, in a letter thanking Kohl for
the visit, called Stock ``an ardent partisan of rapprochement
between our two peoples.''
<p>
   ``More than ever, our two countries need one another,'' Chirac
wrote.

BC-Britain-Countryside Protest
Country people join forces in London protest for rural life

<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Country people poured into London by the tens of
thousand on Sunday to voice their fears for the future of the
countryside and to protest legislation they believe is a threat to
their rural way of life.
<p>
   From the grouse moors of Scotland and the green valleys of Wales
and England, landowners and laborers, fox hunters and their
opponents brought their diverse grievances to the capital.
<p>
   In a show of strength that filled main roads through the city
center, they marched in complaint about a government many see as
unsympathetic and urban dwellers who don't understand their ways.
<p>
   Hunters in red coats, fishermen carrying their rods and reels,
men, women and children carrying banners and accompanied by a brass
band, they marched two miles (3.2 km) from the Thames-side Victoria
Embankment through Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. Organizers
expected as many as 200,000, but police had no immediate estimates
of the crowd
<p>
   ``Tony Blair Doesn't Care About Country Life'' proclaimed a
placard attacking the prime minister. ``This earth is for people,
not just New Labour'' said another in the forest of flags and
banners waved by marchers streaming toward Hyde Park.
<p>
   Fox hunting was at the heart of the matter.
<p>
   A Labor legislator has initiated a bill to ban hunting with
hounds, provoking outrage among thousands of horsemen and women who
gallop across frozen farmland on winter days in pursuit of the fox.
<p>
   Opponents of hunting say it is barbaric to allow dogs to tear a
fox to death and that no civilized society can tolerate it.
<p>
   Hunters say they provide a vital control of foxes, which are a
farmyard pest, and that people who have no knowledge or
understanding of the hunt have no right to deny them their sport.
<p>
   The march was organized by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance
to protest the legislation, but a huge array of other interests
have joined in.
<p>
   Among them are anti-hunting campaigners who have other
conservation issues at heart  &MD;  from saving hedgerows to halting
contruction on green fields.
<p>
   Some landowners are unhappy with prospective legislation that
would allow walkers to roam over their acres. Organizations for
``ramblers,'' as the walkers are called, marched in support of such
a law.
<p>
   Through all these issues runs the thread of deep concern about
preservation of the countryside and a sense that the government
represents an urban viewpoint.
<p>
   ``This is about a show of hands,'' said marcher Peter Haydon.
<p>
   ``Of course there has to be moderate change, but the government
is attacking people like farmers,'' said Haydon, who lives in
Hertfordshire, 20 miles north of London and works in the capital as
a telecommuncations engineer.
<p>
   Not all the marchers were country folk.
<p>
   Peter Pender, a retired electrician, said the only countryside
he knew about was the window box at his seventh floor apartment in
Hounslow, west London.
<p>
   But he said he resented being the government's decision to ban
the sale of beef on the bone because of concerns that it could
transmit mad cow disease  &MD;  bovine spongiform encephalopathy  &MD;  to
those who eat it.
<p>
   ``I think it's an attack on my freedom,''Pender said.
``Politicians are arrogant.''

Report: Germany, France close to compromise on Central Bank chief
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany and France are near compromise on
the politically touchy question of who will head the European
Central Bank when the planned EU single currency goes into effect
next year, according to a newsmagazine report.
<p>
   An expected agreement between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French
President Jacques Chirac would allow France to name the bank's
first vice-president, said the Focus report released Saturday.
France would name the president when the job becomes open again in
eight years.
<p>
   The report said a main candidate for the presidency's first term
was Wim Duisenberg, of the Netherlands, who now heads the central
bank's forerunner, the European Monetary Institute, in Frankfurt.
<p>
   Supported by most EU members, Duisenberg, 63, had been expected
to take over the central bank's top job when the single currency,
the euro, is introduced Jan. 1, 1999.
<p>
   But France last November nominated French Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet for the job in what was seen as a bid to assert
itself in the march toward monetary union, which has generally been
dominated by Germany.
<p>
   According to Focus, a plan the shorten Duisenberg's term to make
way for a French candidate was no longer under discussion. Also
under the reported compromise, Germany would appoint one of the
four members of the Central Bank's board of directors.

Turkey gathers Caspian Sea oil producers for pipeline talks
EDS: CORRECTS style to Kazakstan throughout
By YALMAN ONARAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  A meeting of oil-producing countries of
the Caspian Sea started Sunday with cautious support for a pipeline
through Turkey.
<p>
   However, participants appeared divided on other issues related
to the exploitation and transportation of the oil, especially
regarding the role of their Russia and the sharing of the Caspian
basin.
<p>
   Hoping to cash in on the oil and natural gas reserves of the
Caspian, estimated to be second only to the Middle East, Turkey
managed to bring together Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan to
see whether it could win political commitment to its pipeline
proposal. Georgia joined the meeting as another transit route
candidate.
<p>
   In their opening remarks, foreign ministers talked of varying
levels of support for the Turkish proposal  &MD;  bringing oil and gas
from Azerbaijan's capital on the Caspian, Baku, to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
<p>
   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem would not say whether
Russia, absent at the meeting, had been invited.
<p>
   Russia has Caspian shoreline and is involved in several pipeline
projects to carry the region's oil to western markets.
<p>
   Russia and Turkey have been vying for influence on Central Asia
since the breakup of the Soviet Union, but recently Turkey has
shifted to a more conciliatory approach, arguing the two could both
have economic gains from the region.
<p>
   ``I believe we need to have close cooperation with two countries
not here today, Russia and the United States,'' Cem said,
suggesting that they are invited join future meetings.
<p>
   American oil companies are active in exploration and early
production in the region. Washington has leaned heavily toward
favoring Turkey in the transportation of the oil and as recently as
last week voiced strong support for Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
<p>
   Azerbaijan's acting Foreign Minister Araz Azimov was not so keen
on Russia's possible participation.
<p>
   ``We should not be taken hostage by certain powers as in the
past,'' he said. ``To add Russia to the group is premature.''
<p>
   Kazak Foreign Minister Kassymzhomart Tokayev emphasized the
importance of ``overcoming the dependency on Russia'' but also said
his country was determined to carry at least some of its oil
through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
<p>
   Azimov, Tokayev and their Turkmen counterpart, Boris Sihmuradov,
discussed possible sharing of the Caspian area as well.
<p>
   Turkey hopes to conclude the meeting Monday with a joint
declaration of political commitment to the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline,
but it was unclear it that will happen.
<p>
   ``Baku-Ceyhan is a good possibility, but preference will be
given to the project with best economic chances,'' said Tokayev.

<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian plane carrying 30 tons of baby
food and medical supplies arrived in Iraq Sunday.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried 11 Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq which
has been under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods have to be approved by
the U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The Egyptian plane, which landed at Baghdad's Saddam
International Airport, was carrying baby food and medicine donated
by Egyptian businessmen and pharmaceutical companies valued at over
1.2 million pounds (dlrs 353,000), said Cairo airport officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The Egyptian celebrities included actress Raghda and Parliament
deputy Ahmed Taha.
<p>
   ``The delegation's trip is a message of Arab solidarity to the
United States and Israel,'' said Taha.
<p>
   The trip, the second for Egyptian celebrities, is part of a
concerted effort by Arab nations to alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people.
<p>
   The Iraqi government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo. A U.N. report says the sanctions have
led to widespread malnutrition.
<p>
   Also Sunday, several trucks carrying 180 tons of medicine,
clothing, blankets and powdered milk arrived in Iraq from the
United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   Saeed Mohammed al-Mansoori, head of the delegation from the
Emirates, said the aid should be seen as gifts and not handouts.
<p>
   Al-Mansoori, who heads a charitable organization in the
Emirates, said two planeloads of medicine were due in Iraq on
Monday.
<p>
   ``We will continue our supplies because Iraqis are Muslims and
brothers, and we must help each other in bad times,'' said
al-Mansoori.
<p>
   Egypt and the United Arab Emanates were active members of the
U.S.-led military coalition that ended Iraq's seven-month
occupation of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War.

Palestinian official denies involvement in Dead Sea smuggling
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Palestinian officials on Sunday denied any
involvement or knowledge of an attempt to smuggle two boatloads of
weapons from Jordan across the Dead Sea.
<p>
   ``It seems to be a criminal act,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the
Palestinian Cabinet secretary. ``Such a large-scale smuggling
operation is not the work of one individual, but organized gangs
that are usually bi-national, Arab and Israeli.''
<p>
   The Israeli military intercepted two boatloads of weapons and
arms being smuggled from Jordan across the Dead Sea over the
weekend. Authorities were reportedly investigating the possibility
that the contraband was intended for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
<p>
   Another Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Israeli government of blaming the
Palestinian Authority as an excuse to not implement the peace
accords.

ASEAN asking U.N. for help to fight forest fires
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  Southeast Asia is seeking
international help to fight its forest fires since the problem will
affect the global climate, a senior Malaysian official said Sunday.
<p>
   Law Hieng Ding, the minister of science, technology and
environment, said the nine-country Association of Southeast Asian
Nations has asked the United Nations Environment Program to help it
obtain monetary and technical aid from the World Bank and developed
nations.
<p>
   He said that based on a study by an ASEAN scientist, the amount
of carbon dioxide released during the forest fires in Indonesia
last year was equivalent to the amount generated in all of Europe
in one year.
<p>
   The increased amount could aggravate global warming, since
carbon dioxide is one of the ``greenhouse gases'' that can trap
heat in the Earth's atmosphere, news agency Bernama quoted him as
saying.
<p>
   ``Forest fires and haze should be an international issue and not
only regional,'' Law said after opening a seminar on environmental
awareness.
<p>
   Last week, ASEAN ministers held their second meeting on the haze
problem resulting from forest fires in the region.
<p>
   At the meeting in Kuching, in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on
Borneo Island, Law said six ASEAN members had submitted their
national action plans on haze to the ASEAN Secretariat. The other
three were expected to submit theirs by the end of the month, he
added, but declined to name the three countries.
<p>
   The action plans outline each nation's measures to counter
forest fires and reduce their effects, both individually and with
assistance from other countries.

Condition of ailing Greek Orthodox leader deteriorates
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  The condition of the ailing head of the
Greek Orthodox church, Archbishop Seraphim, deteriorated Sunday as
he struggled to fight off a viral infection, doctors said.
<p>
   Physicians treating Seraphim, 84, at Athens' Popular Hospital
declined to comment on whether there was a possibility of him
recovering, saying that ``miracles can happen,'' local media
reported.
<p>
   Numerous politicians and clerics have visited Seraphim over the
past two days and he reportedly received his last rites on
Saturday.
<p>
   The archbishop, who was hospitalized Wednesday, also spent two
days in a hospital in early February after suffering complications
during kidney dialysis, a procedure he has undergone three times a
week since 1996.
<p>
   Seraphim, known for his mercurial temper and clashes with
politicians and clerics alike, has led the country's Orthodox
Christians since his appointment as archbishop in 1974.
<p>
   Nearly 99 percent of Greece's 10.2 million residents are
baptized into the church, while at least 5 million Greek Orthodox
are thought to live abroad.
<p>
   Despite his declining health, Seraphim has flatly refused calls
from his clerics to resign.

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Jean Balland, the Roman Catholic arch-bishop of
Lyon died Sunday, just two months after he was named a cardinal by
Pope Jean Paul II, the Lyonnais archdiocese said. He was 63.
<p>
   Balland had been suffering from lung cancer and was hospitalized
in November, the archdiocese said in a statement.
<p>
   Balland was named a cardinal Jan. 18, and had been the
archbishop of Lyon  &MD;  France's second largest city  &MD;  since 1995.
<p>
   He was ordained a priest in 1961, worked as a seminary professor
and served as bishop of Dijon from 1982 to 1988, and then as
archbishop of Reims before coming to Lyon.
<p>
   Born July 26, 1934, Balland was the fifth child in a family of
wine makers.
<p>
   France, with a mostly Roman Catholic population, now has only
four cardinals. Balland's death reduced to 120 the number of
cardinals under age 80 and thus eligible to vote for the next pope.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in the troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Kosovo Albanians' leader appealed to the West to stop police
violence, a day after clashes left at least seven people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Albanians, who are
demanding secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States and
the European Union to pressure Belgrade to stop police violence. In
a statement he said that ``urgent measures'' are needed to prevent
the Serb attacks which are aimed at ``intimidating and causing
panic'' among the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.
<p>
   Two Serb policemen were killed and two wounded on Saturday, when
their patrol was ambushed near the village of Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of province's capital, Pristina.
<p>
   In a subsequent action, the Serb police said they killed five
Albanian ``terrorists.''
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army surfaced in 1996. The clandestine,
ethnic Albanian militant group has claimed responsibility for
several terrorist attacks that have left more than 30 people dead.
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of all-out war in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
population are ethnic Albanians.
<p>
   Both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources claim the death toll from
Saturday's clashes may be much higher, after Serb police
retaliated, using helicopters and armored vehicles to sweep through
ethnic Albanian villages in the areas surrounding Glogovac.
<p>
   Sources close to Rugova claim that at least seven more ethnic
Albanians were killed in the police operation. Belgrade state-run
Politika daily said that altogether four Serb policemen were killed
and three were wounded in clashes Saturday. The reports could not
be independently confirmed.
<p>
   Ethnic Albanian sources said gunfire and explosions could still
be heard Sunday morning around Glogovac and in nearby Srbica, the
center of ethnic Albanian rebellion in Kosovo. The region is
reportedly sealed off and surrounded by heavy Serb police forces
who are conducting house-to-house searches.
<p>
   Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.

Saudi minister gives terms for restoring relations with Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Saudi Arabia will restore relations with
Iraq if Baghdad implements all U.N. Security Council resolutions,
the kingdom's foreign minister said Sunday.
<p>
   Speaking to reporters in Cairo after talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Prince Saud al-Faisal said Saudi Arabia
wanted what the world required of Iraq: ``the full implementation
of the (U.N.) Security Council resolutions.''
<p>
   ``If these (resolutions) are implemented, then Iraq's problems
will be solved, including normalization'' of relations, he said.
<p>
   The Saudis broke relations with Baghdad after Iraqi forces
overran Kuwait in 1990. During the subsequent Gulf War, a column of
Iraqi troops crossed into the kingdom but were quickly repulsed by
the U.S.-led coalition in which Saudi forces figured prominently.
<p>
   However, during the recent Iraqi standoff with the United
Nations over weapons inspections, the Riyadh government said it
would not allow U.S. forces to use Saudi soil to launch strikes on
Iraq.
<p>
   Prince Saud, who arrived in Cairo Sunday for a one day visit,
said his talks with Mubarak focused on the latest developments in
the region, including the Iraqi crisis and the Middle East peace
process.

<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Country people poured into London by the tens of
thousand on Sunday to voice their fears for the future of the
countryside and to protest legislation they see as a threat to
their rural way of life.
<p>
   From the grouse moors of Scotland and the green valleys of Wales
and England, landowners and laborers, fox hunters and their
opponents brought their diverse grievances to the capital.
<p>
   In a show of strength that filled main roads through the city
center, they marched in complaint about a government many see as
unsympathetic and urban dwellers who don't understand their ways.
<p>
   Hunters in red coats, fishermen carrying their rods and reels,
men, women and children carrying banners and accompanied by a brass
band, they marched two miles (3.2 km) from the Thames-side Victoria
Embankment through Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. Organizers
expected as many as 200,000, but police had no immediate estimates
of the crowd
<p>
   ``Tony Blair Doesn't Care About Country Life'' proclaimed a
placard attacking the prime minister. ``This earth is for people,
not just New Labour'' said another in the forest of flags and
banners waved by marchers streaming toward Hyde Park.
<p>
   Fox hunting was at the heart of the matter.
<p>
   A Labor legislator has initiated a bill to ban hunting with
hounds, provoking outrage among thousands of horsemen and women who
gallop across frozen farmland on winter days in pursuit of the fox.
<p>
   Opponents of hunting say it is barbaric to allow dogs to tear a
fox to death and that no civilized society can tolerate it.
<p>
   Hunters say they provide a vital control of foxes, which are a
farmyard pest, and that people who have no knowledge or
understanding of the hunt have no right to deny them their sport.
<p>
   The march was organized by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance
to protest the legislation, but a huge array of other interests
have joined in.
<p>
   Among them are anti-hunting campaigners who have other
conservation issues at heart  &MD;  from saving hedgerows to halting
construction on green fields.
<p>
   Some landowners are unhappy with prospective legislation that
would allow walkers to roam over their acres. Organizations for
``ramblers,'' as the walkers are called, marched in support of such
a law.
<p>
   Through all these issues runs the thread of deep concern about
preservation of the countryside and a sense that the government
represents an urban viewpoint.
<p>
   ``This is about a show of hands,'' said marcher Peter Haydon.
<p>
   ``Of course there has to be moderate change, but the government
is attacking people like farmers,'' said Haydon, who lives in
Hertfordshire, 20 miles (32 km) north of London and works in the
capital as a telecommuncations engineer.
<p>
   Farm worker William Campbell, 28, from Desmartin in northwest
Northern Ireland, said he came with 26 others from the town.
<p>
   ``I want politicians to change their mind about banning fox
hunting and building on green belt areas,'' he said. ``And if the
ramblers get their way, farmers will not even have a right of
access to their own land.''
<p>
   Not all the marchers were country folk.
<p>
   Peter Pender, a retired electrician, said the only countryside
he knew about was the window box at his seventh floor apartment in
Hounslow, west London.
<p>
   But he said he resented the government's decision to ban the
sale of beef on the bone because of concerns that it could transmit
mad cow disease  &MD;  bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
<p>
   ``I think it's an attack on my freedom,'' Pender said.
<p>
   At the Hyde Park end of the march, most demonstrators drifted
away, but some lingered for a picnic lunch in the cold sunshine.
<p>
   ``I hope we've shown at today's march that we can behave
responsibility and good-humoredly, but also that we have shown
people quietly that we have deeply-held beliefs,'' said Ian Davis,
a hunter and horseman from the New Forest area of southwest
England.

Report: Syria wants to resume peace talks with Israel
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu comments
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday
that Israel will not withdraw unilaterally from southern Lebanon.
<p>
   Netanyahu said Friday he had ``no qualms'' about U.N. Resolution
425, which calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the
zone it occupies in south Lebanon.
<p>
   ``We're interested in leaving Lebanon with the necessary
security safeguards,'' he added.
<p>
   On Sunday, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Israel has no plans
to make a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, because that would
increase attacks on northern Israel by the Hezbollah guerrilla
group.
<p>
   ``If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making
appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be
happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of
U.N. Resolution 425,'' he said.
<p>
   The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu made his
comments about Resolution 425 in response to signals from Syria
that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two
countries.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
signalled its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years.

   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  Burma's military regime has arrested 40
people it accuses of planning to bomb government buildings and
embassies and assassinate the country's leaders. The plot was
masterminded by the All Burma Students Democratic Front, made up of
former students who fled the suppression of a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, government spokesman Col. Kyaw Thein said. Kyaw
Thein said the student insurgents were linked to the party of
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. A spokesman for the
students' front, Aung Naing Oo, said the group had given up armed
struggle last year and was now seeking change in Burma through
``non-violent, political defiance.'' Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel
Peace Prize, has stressed that she is seeking a non-violent way to
bring democracy to Burma. (BURMA-ARRESTS)
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Sweeping reforms have yet to ease
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years and life for millions
is getting worse, resulting in civil unrest, President Suharto said
Sunday. In a frank address to a People's Consultative Assembly
expected to re-elect him as president next week, Suharto said he
remained committed to reforms sponsored by the International
Monetary Fund under a dlrs 43 billion rescue package. But he said
that with no quick improvement likely, Indonesia's economy needed
``appropriate alternative'' treatment to the IMF reforms, which
demand wide austerity measures and the dismantling of monopolies
and subsidies that have enriched Suharto's family and friends.
(INDONESIA-PRESIDENT)
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Country people poured into London by the tens of
thousand on Sunday to voice their fears for the future of the
countryside and to protest legislation they believe is a threat to
their rural way of life. Discontent has grown in rural areas
markedly in the past few years. Farmers have been hit by a European
Union ban on British beef exports, due to fears of mad cow disease.
Legislators have been trying to ban fox-hunting, and landowners are
upset at Labor Party plans to force them to grant more public
access to their estates. In many villages popular with wealthy
commuters, houses are now too expensive for local young people, and
they move out. (BRITAIN-COUNTRYSIDE PROTEST)
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Italy's foreign minister, the first Western
Cabinet official in Iran since the European Union lifted a ban on
high level visits, said Sunday that the EU's ``critical'' dialogue
was over  &MD;  it now wants a more open exchange. Lamberto Dini said he
was pleased with the EU's new relationship with Iran and that the
union is looking to an open dialogue on all matters of common
concern. The EU had maintained a policy of trying to bring change
in Iran through ``critical dialogue,'' but earlier this week EU
foreign ministers said a number of encouraging developments  &MD; 
including the election in May of relatively moderate cleric
President Mohammad Khatami  &MD;  required a positive response. The EU
move differed sharply from U.S. policy, which says Iran is a rogue
state and must be isolated. (IRAN-ITALY)
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Khmer Rouge guerrillas denounced
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's cease-fire proposal Sunday as an
``obvious trick'' aimed at wiping out resistance forces battling
his troops in northern Cambodia. In a clandestine radio broadcast,
the Khmer Rouge said that resistance forces loyal to deposed
co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh would have their
``throats slit'' if they agreed to Hun Sen's cease-fire terms.
Ranariddh, who is in exile after his ouster by Hun Sen in a July
coup, formed an armed resistance in northern Cambodia to battle the
Phnom Penh government. His forces have been loosely aligned with
Khmer Rouge guerrillas. Ranariddh announced Friday that his
resistance troops would adopt a unilateral cease-fire in hopes of
paving the way for the prince's return to Cambodia to participate
in elections scheduled for July 26. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)

India's Board President's Eleven at 223 for four
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VISHAKAPATNAM, India (AP)  &MD;  Powered by a 65-run knock by V.V.S.
Laxman, India's Board President's Eleven scored 223 for four
wickets at close on the first day of the three-day match against
Australia in this eastern coastal city.
<p>
   Skipper Rahul Dravid elected to bat first, but his team was soon
faced with a disciplined bowling attack from the visiting
Australian squad that is playing warm up matches before its Test
series against India's national team.
<p>
   Barring Laxman's flamboyant play, the only other batsman who
fared well was S. Ramesh who scored 58 before falling to a Michael
Kasprowicz delivery.
<p>
   Star leg-spinner Shane Warne took two wickets for 58 runs,
including Laxman's. The other wickets were shared by Paul Reiffel
(1/28) and Kasprowicz (1/32).
<p>
   H. Kanitkar and Vanka Pratap were at the crease when stumps were
drawn.
<p>
   Australia is playing three Tests against India and later
participating in a three-country one-day series that also involves
Zimbabwe.

<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Assured of another five-year term but
under pressure from riots and protests over rising prices and
unemployment, President Suharto called Sunday for changes to an
International Monetary Fund plan to save his battered economy.
<p>
   In a frank address to a 1,000-member People's Consultative
Assembly that is certain to re-elect him unopposed next week,
Suharto said the IMF's prescription of sweeping reform and
austerity measures shows no sign of curing the worst economic
crisis in his 32 years in power.
<p>
   Suharto said he remained committed to terms of the IMF's dlrs 43
billion rescue package, agreed last year and revised in January
after the crisis worsened.
<p>
   However, he said, additional strategies were needed as life gets
tougher in the world's fourth-most populous nation.
<p>
   ``Despite the fact that we already have started to carry out
clear and fundamental reforms and a restructuring program, there
are no signs yet that the situation has improved,'' the 76-year-old
leader said in the nationally televised speech.
<p>
   ``On the contrary, the people's life is becoming more
difficult.''
<p>
   In recent weeks, five people were killed when mobs in more than
20 towns wrecked and burned hundreds of shops and houses, owned by
ethnic Chinese traders whom they blamed for rising prices of food
and other basic goods.
<p>
   Suharto made no direct reference to the targeting of the Chinese
minority but said it ``is useless to look for scapegoats.''
<p>
   ``I share the sadness of housewives and low-income families in
dealing with the skyrocketing prices. The public becomes restless.
Even the slightest misunderstanding has sparked greater unrest,''
he said.
<p>
   Suharto did not specify what changes he wanted, but said new
measures could be introduced as an ``IMF-Plus'' formula.
<p>
   He identified currency stabilization as the key to recovery and
voiced frustration that the rupiah's value had not rebounded after
plummeting more than 70 percent since July.
<p>
   He was still ``carefully and cautiously contemplating'' a plan
to peg the rupiah to the U.S. dollar through a currency board
system.
<p>
   The IMF and major industrial countries, including the United
States, have cautioned against a currency board, saying it was
premature and could wreck Indonesia's chances of recovery.
<p>
   Former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale, a special envoy of
President Clinton, was expected to reinforce this message when he
arrived Monday for talks with Suharto.
<p>
   In recent days, many analysts have speculated that the currency
board plan would be quietly dropped.
<p>
   But Suharto said that while any new solutions would need IMF
support, ultimately ``our fate rests in our own hands.''
<p>
   ``I shall not hesitate to do whatever possible to overcome the
situation in order to alleviate the increasingly heavy burden on
the people's life,'' said Asia's longest serving leader.
<p>
   Suharto, dressed in a dark business suit with his trademark
black fez-like ``peci'' cap, spoke standing at a podium in the
national Parliament building for more than a hour.
<p>
   There has been some concern in financial markets that Indonesia
has been too slow to follow through with IMF reforms abolishing
monopolies and other privileges that have made Suharto's family and
associates wealthy over many years.
<p>
   The president's six children sat alongside government ministers
in the first rows of the vast wood-paneled chamber during the
speech.
<p>
   The Parliament building was heavily guarded from the outside,
and armed troops in black uniforms patrolled a nearby amusement
park. A half-dozen armored personnel carriers were stationed
nearby.
<p>
   About 35,000 troops and police have been assigned to safeguard
the proceedings and to crack down on protests.
<p>
   Mass gatherings have been banned in the capital, where elite
troops have staged impressive security exercises to demonstrate how
they would react against troublemakers.

Light snow falls on Tokyo, disrupting transportation
Eds: UPDATES with injuries, passenger numbers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Thick, wet snow fell on Tokyo and surrounding areas
Sunday, stopping hundreds of trains and planes and causing
accidents that injured at least 30 people.
<p>
   About five centimeters (2 inches) fell before the snow stopped
Sunday afternoon, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
<p>
   Slippery streets and sidewalks led to falls that injured 15
people, said Keita Kaneko, a spokesman for Tokyo's Fire Department.
Suffering from bruises or broken limbs, they were taken to
hospitals by ambulance, but eight were released after treatment, he
added.
<p>
   In Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, 15 people were injured,
none of them seriously, in 12 traffic accidents apparently caused
by slippery roads, said police official Yoshiyuki Tanaka.
<p>
   A spokesman of JR East Japan, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said snow forced the cancellation of 470 trains in
Tokyo, affecting about 263,000 people. Train services returned to
normal at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT).
<p>
   Tokyo's Haneda airport, which handles mainly domestic flights,
was closed Sunday morning because of the snow, and 280 of about 600
scheduled flights were canceled, said a Transportation Ministry
official, who also requested anonymity.
<p>
   Kyodo News agency reported that about 45,000 people were
affected by the flight cancellations.
<p>
   In January, 15 centimeters (6 inches) of snow on a weekday
wreaked havoc with Tokyo's transportation system, stopping more
than 1,500 train runs and hundreds of airline flights, and
stranding more than 2 million commuters.

Palestinian official denies involvement in Dead Sea smuggling

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Palestinian officials on Sunday denied any
involvement or knowledge of an attempt to smuggle two boatloads of
weapons from Jordan across the Dead Sea.
<p>
   ``It seems to be a criminal act,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the
Palestinian Cabinet secretary. ``Such a large-scale smuggling
operation is not the work of one individual, but organized gangs
that are usually bi-national, Arab and Israeli.''
<p>
   The Israeli military intercepted two boatloads of weapons and
arms being smuggled from Jordan across the Dead Sea over the
weekend. Authorities were reportedly investigating the possibility
that the contraband was intended for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
<p>
   Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, told the
Cabinet on Sunday that the weapons were intended for ``elements''
in the Palestinian Authority, Israeli radio stations said.
<p>
   Another Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Israeli government of blaming the
Palestinian Authority as an excuse to not implement the peace
accords.

Social democratic party to unite and reform left groups
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP)  &MD;  Defectors from the former communist party
decided on Sunday to form a single party aimed at uniting
Bulgaria's fractious left around modern, European social democracy.
<p>
   Members of the Euroleft coalition, which was formed last
February and holds 14 seats in parliament, gathered for their first
congress and decided to form a single party. Former coalition
leader, Alexander Tomov was elected to lead the new party, which
hopes to push through economic and social reforms.
<p>
   Tomov said ``renewal of the entire Bulgarian left on the basis
of the European left values'' is the main goal of his party, which
plans to form a coalition with other social democratic and agrarian
parties.
<p>
   Tomov, a 44-year-old economist, served as a deputy prime
minister in the short-lived multiparty government in 1991, and as a
lawmaker in three parliaments. He defected from the Socialist Party
of former communists in 1994, as the head of a splinter group that
came at odds with the prevailing conservative wing of the party.
<p>
   Last February, Tomov founded the Euroleft together with a new
batch of high-ranking Socialist defectors. The party won 14 of 240
seats in parliament in April 1997 elections and now has about
24,000 members, Tomov said.
<p>
   The Euroleft has attracted many former Socialists, whose party
suffered a bad defeat in the 1997 elections after large street
protests had forced it out of power in the wake of an unprecedented
economic crisis.
<p>
   Euroleftists are mainly well educated and young people, who have
been disillusioned by Socialist reluctance to reforms.
<p>
   The Socialists' prevailing electorate is mainly rural, lowly
educated, elderly and nostalgic of the communist era. The
leadership is controlled by former aparatchiks and aspired by
former secret service officers.

Iraqis collect full ration for March
By EILEEN ALT POWELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  Iraqis on Sunday began collecting their
food and household goods rations for March, which were at the full
level called for by the United Nations for the first time in six
months.
<p>
   Delays in the delivery of foodstuffs, especially milk for
babies, had forced Iraq to reduce rations in previous months.
<p>
   Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian operation in
Iraq, said a full ration was available in March because ``there has
been more regularity in arrivals (of goods) thanks to changes in
the process.''
<p>
   He said it ``is the expectation'' that Iraqis also will get full
rations in the next few months. But he added there could be
unanticipated disruptions if there are delays in collecting oil
revenue or in U.N. approval of food contracts.
<p>
   U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, have seriously damaged Iraq's economy. Depreciation of the
Iraqi currency and rising prices have put food and other
necessities out of the reach of many.
<p>
   The United Nations launched an oil-for-food program in December
1996 to help the country cope. It allows Iraq to sell dlrs 2
billion worth of oil over a six-month period to buy needed medicine
and food, which is distributed in monthly ration to all 22 million
Iraqis.
<p>
   Starting Sunday, Iraqis were receiving 9 kilograms (19.8 pounds)
of flour, 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) of rice, 2 kilograms (4.4
pounds) of sugar, 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of legumes, 1 kilogram
(2.2 pounds) of cooking oil, 150 grams of tea (5.25 ounces) , 150
grams (5.25) of salt, 250 grams (8.75 ounces) of soap and 350 grams
(12.25 ounces) of detergent.
<p>
   Families with babies were eligible for 2.7 kilograms (nearly 6
pounds) of powered milk.
<p>
   The last time the full ration was available was in September,
according to the office of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in
Iraq.
<p>
   Last month, tea, salt and baby milk were in short supply.
<p>
   Iraq has repeatedly blamed the United States and Britain for the
shortages, saying they have delayed contracts at the United
Nations. The United States and Britain have denied the allegations.
<p>
   U.N. surveys indicate that the oil-for-food program has helped
ease some of the problems here.
<p>
   But one in three Iraqi children still suffers from malnutrition,
and the ration lacks important animal protein such as cheese which
is needed for proper development.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in the troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Kosovo Albanians' leader appealed to the West to stop police
violence a day after clashes left at least seven people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Albanians who are demanding
secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States and the
European Union to pressure Belgrade to stop violent police actions.
``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent the Serb attacks, which
are aimed at ``intimidating and causing panic'' among the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, he said in a statement.
<p>
   Two Serb policemen were killed and two wounded on Saturday when
their patrol was ambushed near the village of Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of province's capital, Pristina.
<p>
   In a subsequent action, Serb police said they killed five
Albanian ``terrorists.''
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army began operating in 1996. The clandestine
ethnic Albanian militant group has claimed responsibility for
several terrorist attacks that have left more than 30 people dead.
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of all-out war in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
residents are ethnic Albanians.
<p>
   Both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources claim the death toll from
Saturday's clashes may be much higher, after Serb police used
helicopters and armored vehicles to sweep through ethnic Albanian
villages in the areas surrounding Glogovac.
<p>
   Sources close to Rugova claim that at least seven additional
ethnic Albanians were killed in the police operation. Belgrade
state-run Politika daily said that altogether four Serb policemen
were killed and three were wounded in Saturday's clashes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
<p>
   Gunfire and explosions could still be heard Sunday morning
around Glogovac and in nearby Srbica, the center of ethnic Albanian
rebellion in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian sources said. The region is
reportedly sealed off and surrounded by heavy Serb police forces
conducting house-to-house searches.
<p>
   Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.

Jordan, Shell company sign oil agreement
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  Jordan has signed an agreement with the
Dutch-based Shell Co. that allows the firm to extract crude from
oil shales which is abundant in the desert kingdom, the minister of
energy said Sunday.
<p>
   Mohammed Saleh Hourani said Shell is expected to extract oil at
a cost ranging between dlrs 9 to dlrs 11 per barrel if the oil is
found in commercial quantities.
<p>
   He said the agreement with Shell was concluded earlier in the
week, but declined to reveal the specific date.
<p>
   A recent study by the state-run Natural Resources Authority
suggested that Jordan's reserve of oil shale is 40 billion tons in
desert areas in the southwestern regions of the kingdom.
<p>
   Hourani also said Jordan received several offers from
international consortium to build a refinery in the Red Sea port
city of Aqaba, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the Jordanian
capital Amman.
<p>
   He said the refinery will cost dlrs 2 billion and will have a
capacity of 250,000 barrels per day.
<p>
   He declined to name the companies, but said: ``We shall sign an
agreement with the winner in May.'' He noted that one consortium
includes three U.S. companies and another includes seven Arab,
Japanese, European and U.S. firms.
<p>
   The government announced plans to build the Aqaba refinery in
early 1995, months after Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel.
<p>
   Officials said the refinery's output will target markets in
Asia, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Jordan has no oil of
its own, but the government has said the refinery would depend on
crude from Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab Gulf states.
<p>
   The Aqaba refinery will be the second in Jordan. The kingdom now
has a refinery in the southeastern city of Zarqa which processes
90,000 barrels of crude a day and fuel oil trucked across the
eastern desert border from Iraq.
<p>
   In a related development, Hourani said the government has signed
an agreement with a Russian firm to explore oil and natural gas in
various areas of the country. He declined to name the firm.

Report: Syria wants to resume peace talks with Israel
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Syria is sending signals that it wants to renew
long-stalled peace talks with Israel, the Maariv newspaper said
Sunday.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
signalled its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comment last week that
Israel was willing to withdraw its troops from Lebanon ``with the
necessary security safeguards'' was a response to the Syrian
signals, Maariv said.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel and Syria cut off peace talks nearly two years ago.

Khatami says Iranians should tone down their rallies in Mecca
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  President Mohammad Khatami called Sunday for
Iranians to tone down the demonstrations they hold during the
annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
<p>
   The call made in a speech broadcast on state-run television
appears to be aimed at improving relations with Saudi Arabia, which
has long opposed the political rallies staged by Iranian pilgrims
during the hajj, or annual pilgrimage.
<p>
   The hajj should be free of ``fanaticism, backwardness and the
propensity to impose one's views.''
<p>
   ``The followers of unnecessary rigidity in the observance of
(religious) injunctions are not the representatives of the Muslim
community,'' Khatami said. ``They should not be allowed to breed
hatred, dissension, and ignite the flames of conflict in the holy
precincts, where unity, solidarity and fraternity should be
preached.''
<p>
   Ever since some 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, died in clashes
with Saudi police during a rally at the 1987 hajj, the
demonstrations have been something of a test of honor for the
Iranians.
<p>
   Every year, urged on by their leaders, Iranian pilgrims have
defied a Saudi ban on demonstrations to hold a small rally in their
living quarters in Mecca. Such rallies tend to condemn the United
States and other perceived enemies of Islam.
<p>
   Khatami is the first Iranian president to speak out against the
rallies and the move reflects his desire to forge a new
relationship with Saudi Arabia.
<p>
   Riyadh and Tehran have been edging closer since May's election
of Khatami, a moderate cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's
militant foreign policy.
<p>
   During the Organisation of Islamic Conference summit in Tehran
in December, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held two meetings with
Khatami. It is likely that the Iranian rallies at the hajj were
discussed.
<p>
   Khatami's call Sunday could well draw fire from hard-liners in
the government who fear he is betraying the Islamic revolution of
1979. Conservatives have already criticized his call in January for
cultural exchanges with the United States, seeing it as a first
step toward normalizing relations with the country known as ``the
Great Satan.''

Justice catches up with two of Spain's richest, most powerful men
By JOHANNA TUCKMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Spaniards are reveling in the spectacle of
a former national police chief and a debonair banker whisked off to
serve hefty jail terms last week for embezzling millions of
dollars.
<p>
   ``When I was studying business I wanted to be just like you, and
look! now we've made it together,'' says the police chief to the
banker as they shake hands behind bars in one cartoon from the
Barcelona daily La Vanguardia.
<p>
   The police chief is Luis Roldan, who headed Spain's paramilitary
Civil Guard between 1986 and 1993. The banker is Mario Conde, who
personified financial and social success during the same era.
<p>
   After their respective scandals broke several years ago, Roldan
and Conde came to symbolize cynical arrogance within the political
and financial elite that emerged during Spain's transition to
democracy, after the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in
1975.
<p>
   But on Thursday, Spanish courts brought them down.
<p>
   Roldan received a 28-year jail sentence from a Madrid court for
abusing his position as head of the Civil Guard to amass a dlrs 14
million personal fortune.
<p>
   Just hours later, the Supreme Court of Justice ordered Mario
Conde to jail for four and a half years for defrauding the Banco
Espanol de Credito, known as Banesto, of over dlrs 4 million.
<p>
   Spaniards who resented the traditional impunity of the rich and
powerful were delighted, and Friday's editorials applauded
``justice being done'' and ``democracy being reaffirmed.''
<p>
   The Roldan affair was one of the scandals that propelled former
Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to electoral defeat in
1996 after a 13 years in office.
<p>
   Close to the Socialists, Roldan was tapped as a future interior
minister at the time he resigned from the Civil Guard in 1993, just
before the first newspaper exposes of his hidden Swiss bank
accounts.
<p>
   ``Just remember the still powerful Luis Roldan dressed in a
camel hair coat denying everything that had been published'' an
editorial in Spain's biggest selling daily El Pais mused Friday.
<p>
   Spaniards also recall how Roldan's personal fraud was uncovered
 &MD;  he forged academic titles on his way to the top  &MD;  as well as his
flight from Spain in 1994 only to be nabbed in Laos 10 months
later.
<p>
   As a fugitive, Roldan further damaged Gonzalez by saying the
then prime minister was fully aware of the dirty war waged from
within his government against the armed Basque separatist group
ETA. The counterinsurgency campaign left 27 people dead.
<p>
   Friday's El Pais editorial also evoked the memory of Mario Conde
with his trademark slicked-back hair ``surrounded by acolytes
challenging the world to prove his guilt.''
<p>
   Conde, and 10 other former directors and associates of Banesto,
are currently being tried for another misappropriation of dlrs 48
million. They face maximum jail sentences of 44 years if convicted.
<p>
   The financier who once hobnobbed with King Juan Carlos came to
represent dirt on the other side of the political coin from Roldan.
<p>
   He has been repeatedly linked to anti-Gonzalez conspiracies and
claims to be the victim of a Socialist-led smear campaign.
<p>
   Earlier in February, Conde was again rumored to be the architect
of a recently revealed conspiracy to bring down Gonzalez, a
stepping stone to the realization of his own presidential
ambitions.
<p>
   These allegations were immediately tagged onto the surprise
confessions of Luis Maria Anson, former editor of the conservative
daily ABC, in an interview published by the weekly magazine Tiempo
on Feb. 23.
<p>
   Anson said that he had belonged to a group of media figures who
set out to bring down Gonzalez by creating a climate of extreme
political tension in the run-up to the 1996 elections.
<p>
   Somehow, Conde's plunge from power left a sense of ambiguity.
Sweeping down the steps of the Supreme Court on his way to jail
Thursday with his coat draped over his shoulders like a cape, he
did not look like a man who is out as well as down.
<p>
   Another cartoon published in the daily El Correo showed Conde
and Roldan playing cards in their cell.
<p>
   ``That's my last card'' says Conde. ``Go on, I thought you still
had a King up your sleeve'' retorts Roldan.

Hamas militants go on trial in Israel

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was brought before judges.
<p>
   Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
<p>
   Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Three other members of the cell were indicted on charges which
included planting three home-made bombs in a Tel Aviv street in
January 1997, injuring 13 people.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court sentenced a member of another Hamas cell
to 20 months in jail plus 6 months probation. Khaled Muhammed
Bakirat, a resident of east Jerusalem, belonged to a cell accused
of conspiring to plant a bomb in the city's busiest shopping mall
and to kidnap Israeli soldiers and public figures such as Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.
<p>
   Bakirat was a minor figure in the cell, the military prosecutor
said, and pleaded guilty to less serious charges, including
membership in an illegal organization.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court was to extend the detention of Mohammed
Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem
accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
<p>
   Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
<p>
   According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

Social democratic party to unite and reform left groups
Eds: CLARIFIES year party was formed throughout.

<TEXT>
<p>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP)  &MD;  Defectors from the former communist party
decided on Sunday to form a single party aimed at uniting
Bulgaria's fractious left around modern, European social democracy.
<p>
   Members of the Euroleft coalition, which was formed last year
and holds 14 seats in parliament, gathered for their first congress
and decided to form a single party. Former coalition leader,
Alexander Tomov was elected to lead the new party, which hopes to
push through economic and social reforms.
<p>
   Tomov said ``renewal of the entire Bulgarian left on the basis
of the European left values'' is the main goal of his party, which
plans to form a coalition with other social democratic and agrarian
parties.
<p>
   Tomov, a 44-year-old economist, served as a deputy prime
minister in the short-lived multiparty government in 1991, and as a
lawmaker in three parliaments. He defected from the Socialist Party
of former communists in 1994, as the head of a splinter group that
came at odds with the prevailing conservative wing of the party.
<p>
   In February 1997, Tomov founded the Euroleft together with a new
batch of high-ranking Socialist defectors. The party won 14 of 240
seats in parliament in April 1997 elections and now has about
24,000 members, Tomov said.
<p>
   The Euroleft has attracted many former Socialists, whose party
suffered a bad defeat in the 1997 elections after large street
protests had forced it out of power in the wake of an unprecedented
economic crisis.
<p>
   Euroleftists are mainly well educated and young people, who have
been disillusioned by Socialist reluctance to reforms.
<p>
   The Socialists' prevailing electorate is mainly rural, lowly
educated, elderly and nostalgic of the communist era. The
leadership is controlled by former aparatchiks and aspired by
former secret service officers.

Paper: Iranian journalist sentenced to death may get retrial
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  The death sentence against an Iranian
journalist accused of espionage and sexual offenses has been
quashed following intervention by President Mohammad Khatami, which
has paved the way for a retrial, a newspaper reported.
<p>
   Morteza Firoozi, former editor of the English-language Iran
News, has been in jail since May 1997. His death sentence by an
Islamic court was upheld by Iran's Supreme Court, but under Iranian
law he could challenge the courts' capacity to try him.
<p>
   ``Firoozi's case has gone back for review. It is now possible
that the charges against him will be reviewed by an ordinary
court,'' the daily Jameah reported Saturday.
<p>
   ``It is said that intervention by the president and the head of
the judiciary has been influential in this regard,'' the
Farsi-language newspaper said. It gave no other details.
<p>
   Last month, the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi,
said that Firoozi, 40, was sentenced for spying and several sexual
offenses.
<p>
   ``The accusations against him are spying, adultery and repeated
sexual offenses, some of which are extremely serious,'' Yazdi told
reporters. ``He has confessed to the crimes,'' Yazdi said.
<p>
   Few details of the case have emerged in the Iranian press, and
officials have declined to talk about it.
<p>
   Newspapers have only reported that Firoozi had confessed to
spying for France, Japan, South Korea and the United States.
<p>
   Adultery and espionage are punishable by death under Iranian
law.

Opposing group criticizes Suharto's nomination for new term
With BC-Indonesia-President
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Opponents of the ruling party's
candidate for vice president questioned Sunday whether it had done
enough to learn whether Indonesia's people supported him and
President Suharto.
<p>
   Suharto, Indonesia's president for 32 years, is expected to be
elected unopposed by a 1,000-member assembly next week to another
five-year term. The ruling Golkar party plans to nominate Research
and Technology Minister Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie for vice
president.
<p>
   An 11-member delegation presented the party Sunday with
documents to nominate Emil Salim, an economist and former Cabinet
minister, for vice president. It said more than 10,000 supporters
had signed the papers.
<p>
   Delegation member Clementino Dos Reis Amaral called the
nomination process for Suharto and Habibie ``illogical,'' and
questioned how Golkar had decided that the nomination was based on
the people's aspirations.
<p>
   ``It should be decided after hearing what the people want, not
by deciding the names first and asking the people to agree or
not,'' said Amaral, a former three-term legislator from East Timor
and now a member of the National Human Rights Commission. ``Or have
you asked us or some of us?''
<p>
   Amaral also criticized the government for spending 44.7 billion
rupiahs (dlrs 4.9 million) for the 11-day assembly meeting amid an
economic crisis.
<p>
   ``All Cabinet ministers have their own mansions, provincial
governors have guest houses and many other assembly members have
their own houses. Why do we have to pay for luxury hotels for
them?'' he asked.
<p>
   Agung Laksono, vice chairman of Golkar's faction in the People's
Consultative Assembly, which elects the president, said the
nomination of Suharto was based on a two-year process in line with
people's aspirations.
<p>
   ``It has been arranged since the last two annual leadership
meetings of Golkar,'' Laksono said. ``It is constitutional, and
therefore we will fight for Suharto's re-election at the general
assembly.''
<p>
   Fahmi Idris, another Golkar lawmaker, said Salim was one of
Golkar's best leaders, but the door now has been closed for other
nominations.
<p>
   ``The existing mechanism has been closed for all names other
that what we have decided,'' Idris said. ``Golkar factions are
widely open to receive your aspirations but that will no longer
change our stand and view.''

Survivors gather in memory of Holocaust victims
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP)  &MD;  Survivors of Nazi persecution gathered
Sunday at the Yama memorial to honor the memory of Jews killed
during World War II in the ghetto in Minsk.
<p>
   About 200 survivors and members of Jewish organizations gathered
at the monument, built near a pit where some 5,000 Jews were killed
by the Nazis on March 2, 1942.
<p>
   Felix Lipskiy, a former ghetto resident and concentration camp
prisoner, said for himself and other survivors, the war will never
be forgotten.
<p>
   ``The account of the war is not closed,'' he told the mourners.
``We have not found and marked all mass graves. We haven't yet
built a proper monument for those who died in the Minsk ghetto.''
<p>
   The Yama monument was built in 1947 on the site of a mass grave
where the 5,000 victims are believed to be buried. More than
100,000 Jews in the Minsk ghetto died during the 1941-1944

Military regime arrests 40, breaks up alleged terrorist plot
Eds: RECASTS to move student denial higher
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RANGOON, Burma (AP)  &MD;  Burma's military regime has arrested 40
people it accuses of planning to bomb government buildings and
embassies and assassinate the country's leaders.
<p>
   A government spokesman, Col. Kyaw Thein, said Sunday the plot
was masterminded by the All Burma Students Democratic Front, made
up of former students who fled the suppression of a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988.
<p>
   A spokesman for the students' front, Aung Naing Oo, said the
group had given up armed struggle last year and was now seeking
change in Burma through ``non-violent, political defiance.''
<p>
   ``We didn't have anything to do with this. It's the usual
military propaganda,'' he said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press in Bangkok.
<p>
   Kyaw Thein said that among those arrested in January was law
graduate Ko Thein, described as the leader of a plot to ``undermine
public confidence in the government.''
<p>
   Kyaw Thein, a member of the regime's information committee, told
a news conference that the student insurgents were linked to the
party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
<p>
   He said two members of her National League for Democracy, Myo
Thant and Pol Khwa, had established contact with the student group
and gone underground last November.
<p>
   Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has stressed that she
is seeking a non-violent way to bring democracy to Burma.
<p>
   Kyaw Thein said no action has been taken against Suu Kyi's party
but that the regime wanted to ``highlight NLD's obvious link with
the illegal organization.''
<p>
   Fuses concealed in cigarettes and some explosives that the
colonel said were seized from Ko Thein were exhibited at the
special news conference.
<p>
   The military officer said the insurgents were hoping to place
bombs at government buildings and embassies of members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has taken a generally
pro-regime stance and accepted Burma into the economic grouping.
<p>
   Thein Tun, described as the leader of the student front's ``Unit
207,'' entered Burma from the Thai border area last December after
earlier receiving training in explosives from the Karen National
Union, an ethnic minority rebel group also fighting the central
government.
<p>
   The spokesman did not say when the group would be tried.

John Major deplores tasteless treatment of Diana's memory
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Princess Diana's memory should not be distorted by
wild rumors and lurid headlines, says former Prime Minister John
Major, who acts as a guardian to Diana's sons.
<p>
   ``We, the British public, would like to respect her memory by
not having the distortion of it thrust at us day after day and by
providing for Prince William and Prince Harry privacy that she,
above all,'' would have wanted, Major said in a BBC-TV interview
broadcast Sunday.
<p>
   After Diana's death Aug. 31, the former prime minister was
appointed to look after the legal interests of 13-year-old Harry
and 15-year-old William in matters concerning their mother's
estate.
<p>
   Conspiracy theories about Diana's death with her boyfriend Dodi
Fayed, and rumors of pregnancy and impending marriage, have
circulated around the globe in the months since the Paris car crash
that killed them both. The rumors have been denied by the
princess's family and closest friends, but continue to provide
headlines.
<p>
   Major said he found the headines ``very tasteless indeed.''
<p>
   Anyone who knew the princess, knows her ``one abiding wish ...
would have been that her sons did not suffer the media harassment,
the speculation that she had to suffer for so long,'' he said.
<p>
   ``I can tell you the one thing that the royal princes would like
would be that their mother's memory was respected and not distorted
with wild rumor and tasteless and tacky media activities,'' Major
said.
<p>
   He said he hoped the British public would ``say to these people
who run these wild stories and behave in a tasteless way, `We're
not interested in your product.' ''
<p>
   There had been some progress in press handling of the royal
family, Major said, but ``there are still projects, books and
things planned which I think are unlikely to be helpful.'' He did
not elaborate.
<p>
   What progress there was, he believed, was due to the pressure of
public opinion.
<p>
   ``So I think public opinion marches very strongly behind the
belief that the princes are entitled to some protection and some
privacy and the hope and expectation that they will get it,'' he
said.

Hansen's world record confirms Britain's strength in triple jump
EDS: to be updated following finals

<TEXT>
<p>
   VALENCIA, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Britain's triple jumpers confirmed their
ranking among the world's best this weekend with Ashia Hansen's new
indoor world record at the European Championships providing a
perfect complement to Jonathan Edward's men's world outdoor best.
<p>
   Edwards, himself, was tipped to take the European gold later
Sunday in Valencia and possibly set a new indoor world record.
<p>
   But for the moment the spotlight rested on 26-year-old U.S.-born
Hansen whose 15.16 meter jump in the women's final Saturday erased
the previous 1995 record of 15.03 set by Russian Yolanda Chen.
<p>
   ``It was very important for me,''a modest, but obviously happy,
Hansen said Sunday. ``I've never won a gold and although it's only
indoors, now I'll be looking to do better outdoors.''
<p>
   Saturday's jump itself, she thought ``was a bit untidy. I could
pick faults with it. It looked like I dived into the pit.''
<p>
   On her chances of breaking the outdoor record of 15.50 meters,
set by Ukrainian Inessa Kravets in 1995, she said: ``It's a very
good record, but it's breakable...it's not impossible.''
<p>
   Hansen, of Ghanian background and born in Evansille, Indiana,
has been living in England since she was eight years old.
<p>
   Spotted as a potential athlete during her childhood, it was not
until Hansen was 18 that she started to concentrate on the triple
jump.
<p>
   With the record in the bag, she now feels there's lots of room
for improvement and is confident that some day she will break the
16-meter barrier.
<p>
   Hansen said she had talked briefly with Edwards after breaking
the record and was optimistic that he too would do well later
Sunday.
<p>
   ``The pressure is probably now on him,'' she said, laughingly.
<p>
   Edwards, who set a world outdoor record of 18.29 in 1995, faces
tough competition from Russian Denis Kapustin who is second to him
in the European top 10 for 1998. Edwards led the qualifiyers with a
single jump of 17.15 meters on Friday.
<p>
   In other final events to wrap up the three-day championships
Sunday, Greece's Nikita Xanthou faces former British athlete Fiona
May, now of Italy, in the long jump while 1996 Olympic 10,000 gold
medalist, Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal, lines out for the 3,000
event and Manuel Pancorbo, European 3,000 outdoor record holder, is
tipped for the gold in the men's category.
<p>
   Germany leads the championship medal list with seven in all,
including three golds from Melanie Paschke, in the women's 60, Sven
Buder in the shot put and Tim Lobinger in pole vault, an event in
which his compatriots took all three medals.
<p>
   Greek sprinter Agelos Pavlakakis finished first in the 60 meters
with 6.55 seconds while while Austria's Theresia Kiesl, Olympic
bronze medalist, took the gold in the women's 1,500, posting a
fastest time of 4.13.62.

   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  &MD;  The United Saudi Bank said Sunday
its net profits increased by 19 percent last year, reaching 406.1
million riyals (dlrs 108.3 million).
<p>
   The banks assets soared to 26.6 billion riyals (dlrs 7 billion)
in 1997  &MD;  an increase of no less than 123 percent.
<p>
   The bank said its customer deposits totaled 12.2 billion riyals
(dlrs 3.25 billion), compared with 7.6 billion riyals (dlrs 2
billion) in 1996.
<p>
   Earnings per share in 1997 amounted to 25.25 riyals (dlrs 6.73),
compared with 27.23 riyals (dlrs 7.26) the previous year.
<p>
   This is the first balance sheet put out by the bank since its
merger with Saudi Cairo Bank last year. The bank said it combined
figures from the two banks.
<p>
   Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, one of the bank's
major shareholders, masterminded the merger.

   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  The incidence of bouncing cheques has risen
to such an extent that it is now harming Jordan's economic growth,
a government official said Sunday.
<p>
   The Central Bank reports that cheques totaling 434.6 million
dinars (dlrs 612.1 million) bounced in 1997, a high figure for a
country with a population of 3.8 million, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The cheques hinder growth by disrupting the payment cycle, the
official added.
<p>
   Commercial banks are now taking steps to deter the writing of
bad cheques, such as closing such clients' accounts and
blacklisting them.

Protesters denounce government, construction project
With BC-Indonesia-President
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Hundreds of people have staged
separate protests in an Indonesian provincial capital against
President Suharto's government and against a local construction
project, police said Sunday.
<p>
   At the campus of the state-run Airlangga University in Surabaya,
East Java, about 150 students and lecturers from various colleges
accused the government Saturday of being undemocratic and corrupt.
<p>
   Protesters at the peaceful rally also contended that the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, which is expected to
re-elect Suharto next week to another five-year term as president,
lacks concern for the fate of the common people.
<p>
   ``Therefore, we demand comprehensive political and economic
reform,'' said a student activist who identified himself only as
Herman.
<p>
   He said the protest was inspired by fellow students at Jakarta's
Indonesia University.
<p>
   Hundreds of soldiers blocked the students from marching out of
the campus.
<p>
   Saturday night, more than 500 residents took to the streets in
Rungkut, a business district, protesting construction of a shopping
center, a project they said had caused flooding in the area.
<p>
   They smashed windows of one of the shops being built, a police
officer said. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least 15 people were interrogated but all were released.
<p>
   The protest ended in about eight hours, after hundreds of
soldiers and marines were sent in to disperse the angry mob, he
said.
<p>
   The protests followed a series of riots and demonstrations in
more than 20 other towns over the deterioration of Indonesia's
economy.
<p>
   Five people have been killed, and hundreds of houses and shops
owned by ethnic Chinese traders, who dominate commerce in
Indonesia, have been wrecked or burned by mobs.

Austria's Davis Cup doctor says Muster should stop playing
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  The doctor assigned to Austria's Davis
Cup team apologized for warning Thomas Muster to quit tennis,
praising him as a ``physical and psychological phenomena,'' media
reported Sunday.
<p>
   Dr. Rudolf Schabus, an emergency surgeon who has served the
country's Davis Cup team for years, told the daily Kurier he that
he retracted his earlier statement that Muster should quit the
sport for health reasons, admitting that he hadn't seen Muster in
years.
<p>
   ``Thomas is a physical and psychological phenomena and I hope he
will continue to be a top sportsman for a long while,'' Schabus
told Kurier.
<p>
   On Friday, Schabus had said it was ``no longer recommended that
Muster continue playing tennis'' due to severe arthritis in his
left knee and a shortening of his left leg because of an operation
on the knee.
<p>
   Muster's coach, Ronald Leitgeb, indignantly rejected the
comments.
<p>
   Muster's next tournament begins March 9 in Indian Wells,
California, where he reached the semi-finals last year before
losing Michael Chang, who went on to win the event.
<p>
   Muster who has slid in recent years and is now ranked 20th by
the ATP, failed to defend his Dubai Open title earlier this month,
losing to Nicolas Kiefer.

Hamas militants go on trial in Israel
Eds: UPDATES with sentence and indictments in second trial
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was also brought before judges.
<p>
   Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
<p>
   Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Three other members of the cell were indicted on charges that
included planting three homemade bombs in a Tel Aviv street in
January 1997 that injured 13 people.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court sentenced a member of another Hamas cell
to 20 months in jail plus 6 months probation. Khaled Muhammed
Bakirat, a resident of east Jerusalem, belonged to a cell accused
of conspiring to plant a bomb in the city's busiest shopping mall
and to kidnap Israeli soldiers and public figures such as Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.
<p>
   Bakirat was a minor figure in the cell, the military prosecutor
said, and he pleaded guilty to less serious charges, including
membership in an illegal organization.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court was to extend the detention of Mohammed
Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem
accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
<p>
   Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
<p>
   According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

BC-Italy-San Remo Songfest
Winner of Italian songfest rejects suggestions she won because of
blindness
With AP Photos
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  A blind woman who nearly won the Miss Italy pageant
and captured this year's San Remo song festival has brushed off
suggestions that sympathy, not talent, was behind her good showings
in a country that does relatively little for the handicapped.
<p>
   Annalisa Minetti, 21, was the favorite going into the
five-night-long annual competition of popular song, which ended
Saturday night. TV viewers, voting by telephone, determine the
winner.
<p>
   Several commentators during the week had raised the possibility
that public sympathy for Minetti's blindness and not necessarily
the love song, ``Senza te o con te'' (Without you or with you'')
she performed was propelling her to victory.
<p>
   One post-show commentator, Aldo Busi, grabbed headlines when he
grumbled, ``So next year, a deaf person will be able to win'' and
added that he admired Minetti because ``she knew how to transform a
handicap into a gold mine.''
<p>
   Minetti, a leggy, streaked blonde with doe-like, big-lashed
green eyes, who made it to the final-three contestant cutoff of
last year's Miss Italy competition, insisted that her singing
talent made her win.
<p>
   ``By now, it seems, we've gone beyond the argument'' that a
sympathy vote pushed her to win the annual San Remo festival, she
told TV interviewers.
<p>
   Similar debate about whether her blindness helped her popularity
dogged the Miss Italy contest.
<p>
   Compared to other modern countries, Italy does relatively little
for people with disabilities to be independent. Not many buildings
are navigable for those in wheelchairs, and public signs in braille
are rare.
<p>
   A certain number of public sector jobs are set aside for the
handicapped, but that system is exploited by many with political
connections. Occasional probes turn up frauds, like the chauffeur
whose application got extra points by claiming blindness.
<p>
   Italy, long a fairly homogenous society, has in general been
recently forced to deal with difference, in part because of
immigration.
<p>
   A couple years ago, when a black Italian won Miss Italy, the
country was split over whether she could really represent the
overwhelmingly white nation.
<p>
   As for the song competition which sparked the latest debate, it,
too, was criticized.
<p>
   Italian critics widely panned the songfest, broadcast live each
night from San Remo, a Mediterranean coastal resort, as being bland
and doing little to improve the quality of Italian popular song.
<p>
   But for Italians, the festival is a must-see appointment.
<p>
   Saturday night's finale drew nearly 15.7 million viewers in a
country of 57 million, with some 18.2 million people tuning in to
RAI state TV to see it at one point.
<p>
   ``Let's face it,'' wrote commentator Roberto D'Agostino in Rome
daily ``Il Messaggero'' Sunday. ``Inveighing against San Remo-cracy
is like writing a book that argues against the force of gravity.''
<p>
   Past winners have won lucrative recording contracts and wide
radio play.

Germany's labor federation: Qualifying for euro has worsened
unemployment
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's labor federation, DGB,
reproached the government over the weekend for cutting the budget
to qualify for Europe's common currency instead of spending to ease
record-high unemployment.
<p>
   DGB representative Ursula Engelen-Kefer on Saturday blamed
Germany's joblessness, in part, on budget cuts made last year to
meet the 3-percent deficit criteria for joining the euro. In
reducing spending, the government cut funds for job-creation
programs.
<p>
   Her comments followed the Federal Statistics Bureau announcement
Friday that Germany had lowered its deficit to 2.7 percent of gross
national product in 1997  &MD;  exceeding the limit set by the European
Union.
<p>
   Government officials defended their achievement. ``The euro will
strengthen the economy, create new jobs and secure the social
welfare net,'' said Peter Hintze, the secretary-general of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   In January, Germany's unemployment reached a new postwar record
of 12.6 percent, or 4.8 million people, and joblessness has become
the key campaign issue ahead of national elections in September.
<p>
   After January's figures were announced, Kohl's coalition
presented a job- creation plan, targeting young people and the
longterm unemployed, and assigning federal funds for local
governments to hire 100,000 welfare recipients each year. The
opposition Social Democrats and Greens rejected the plan.

Japanese triple victory at Vikersund
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIKERSUND, Norway (AP)  &MD;  Even without ace jumpers like Kazuyoshi
Funaki and Masahiko Harada, Japan made a rare podium sweep in a
World Cup ski flying competition Sunday.
<p>
   Takanobu Okabe prevailed after two jumps of 171.5 and 182.5
meters and 359.3 points. Teammate Hiroya Saitoh had a better jump
in the first than the second leg jumping 185.5 and 168.5 meters and
355.8 points, but still managed to take second place. Noriaki Kasai
was third with jumps on 180 and 168 meters and 352.1 points.
<p>
   Primoz Peterka from Slovenia placed fourth with 344.5 points and
Jakub Jiroutek from the Czech Republic fifth with 344.2 points.
<p>
   Strong winds made varying conditions for the jumpers. Four
jumpers who qualified for the second leg, Harada, Dieter Thoma of
Germany, Andreas Goldberger of Austria and Jani Soininen, did not
take the chance because of the wind. Harada even had a fourth place
after the first leg.
<p>
   After Saturday's ski flying competition was canceled because of
strong winds, Austria's Andreas Widhoelzl came back and won the
one-leg competition Sunday morning with a jump of 185 meters.
<p>
   Widhoelzl was one tenth of a point ahead of Germany's Sven
Hannawald who got 188.9 points, and the longest jump in the
competition with 189 meters. Akira Higashi and Takanobu Okabe from
Japan were fourth and fifth with 186.9 and 186.0 points.
<p>
   Funaki leads Thoma 926 points to 853 in the overall World Cup
standings after 20 of 27 events. In the ski flying standings,
Hannawald leads Funaki 258-217.

<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian airplane carrying 30 tons of
baby food and medical supplies arrived in Iraq Sunday.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried 11 Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq, which
has been under economic sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods must be approved by the
U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The plane, which landed at Baghdad's Saddam International
Airport, carried baby food and medicine donated by Egyptian
businessmen and pharmaceutical companies. The cargo was valued at
over 1.2 million pounds (dlrs 353,000), said Cairo airport
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The Egyptian celebrities included actress Raghda and Parliament
deputy Ahmed Taha.
<p>
   ``The delegation's trip is a message of Arab solidarity to the
United States and Israel,'' Taha said.
<p>
   The trip, the second for Egyptian celebrities, is part of an
effort by Arab nations to alleviate the suffering of Iraqis.
<p>
   Iraq's government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo, and a U.N. report says the sanctions
have led to widespread malnutrition.
<p>
   Also Sunday, several trucks carrying 180 tons of medicine,
clothing, blankets and powdered milk arrived in Iraq from the
United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   Saeed Mohammed al-Mansoori, head of the delegation from the
Emirates, said the aid should be seen as gifts and not handouts.
<p>
   Al-Mansoori, who heads a charitable organization in the
Emirates, said two planeloads of medicine were due in Iraq on
Monday.
<p>
   ``We will continue our supplies because Iraqis are Muslims and
brothers, and we must help each other in bad times,'' said
al-Mansoori.
<p>
   Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were active members of the
U.S.-led military coalition that ended Iraq's seven-month
occupation of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War.

Palestinian official denies involvement in Dead Sea smuggling

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Palestinian officials on Sunday denied any
involvement or knowledge of an attempt to smuggle two boatloads of
weapons from Jordan across the Dead Sea.
<p>
   ``It seems to be a criminal act,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the
Palestinian Cabinet secretary. ``Such a large-scale smuggling
operation is not the work of one individual, but organized gangs
that are usually bi-national, Arab and Israeli.''
<p>
   The Israeli military intercepted two boatloads of weapons and
arms being smuggled from Jordan across the Dead Sea over the
weekend. Authorities were reportedly investigating the possibility
that the contraband was intended for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
<p>
   Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, told the
Cabinet on Sunday that the weapons were intended for ``elements''
in the Palestinian Authority, Israeli radio stations said.
<p>
   Another Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Israeli government of blaming the
Palestinian Authority as an excuse to not implement the peace
accords.
<p>
   Nine Jordanians were convicted in a military court in Jordan
last Tuesday for smuggling arms by boat through the Dead Sea to the
West Bank. No information was immediately available on who was
receiving the weapons, or whether there was any connection to this
weekend's interception.

Netanyahu to discuss peace process during trip to Europe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel
to Europe at the end of the week for discussions on the peace
process and Israel's relationship to the European Community, his

<p>
   Netanyahu will start his four-day trip in Madrid, where he is
scheduled to meet Thursday with the King of Spain and Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, as well as Jewish European leaders.
<p>
   On Friday Netanyahu will travel to Bonn for a meeting on the

Olazabal comes from behind to win Dubai Desert Classic
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Braving the flu, coughing
fits and a swirling sandstorm, Spain's flamboyant Jose Maria
Olazabal came from behind to capture the Dubai Desert Classic title
Sunday.
<p>
   Winning by three shots with a brilliant four under par 68 on the
final round, Olazabal walked away with 130,000 pounds (dlrs
221,000) first prize.
<p>
   Australian Stephen Allan also made a late charge Sunday to move
from six shots off the lead to take second place and 85,000 pounds
(dlrs 145,000), with a four under par 68 for an overall 16 under
par 272.
<p>
   Olazabal, who made a comeback here last year after a crippling
leg injury, began the day with three shots behind leader Robert
Karlsson of Sweden. He faded on the back nine after staying in
front for the early part of the final round on the par 72 Emirates
Golf Club course.
<p>
   The Spaniard clinched victory in style with birdies on the 17th
and 18th holes. He carded an eagle on the 13th, gaining the lead to
end with a 19 under par overall 269.
<p>
   ``It's absolutely fantastic,'' said Olazabal. ``I'm shocked
because of what I have done. I felt bad, really bad and the first
two days were obviously the worst. Every single muscle ached.
<p>
   ``I haven't been able to eat any solids since Wednesday and
survived on yogurts, fruit juices and tea,'' said the 32-year-old
Spaniard, who rates this as his best win since 1994.
<p>
   Olazabal had considered pulling out of the 700,000 pounds (dlrs
1.2 million) tournament Friday due to his illness.
<p>
   Karlsson, who led from the start, found it vastly different
Sunday, scoring a three-over par 75 to finish joint third on an
overall 15-under par 273 with South African Ernie Els, who hit a
par 72 Sunday.
<p>
   ``I simply didn't play well enough and I didn't give myself any
chances. The slightest chances I did have, I didn't take. I'm
disappointed I didn't keep it up all the way,'' said the
28-year-old Karlsson.
<p>
   Desert winds whipping up a sandstorm made putting very difficult
in the morning and early afternoon, causing champs like world No. 2
Greg Norman of Australia, Ignacio Garrido of Spain, and Welshman
Ian Woosnam to fall behind the pace after a string of bogeys.
<p>
   Garrido, who was in second place since the first round, had an
atrocious final round with six bogeys, including successive ones on
the 3rd, 4th and 5th. He dropped out of contention early in the
afternoon.
<p>
   Norman and Woosman, who played together, often matched each
other for bogeys.
<p>
   Woosnam, who celebrates his 40th birthday Monday, was fifth on
13 under 275 after Sunday's round of 73.
<p>
   Norman shared sixth position with Garrido and Lee Westwood of
England.

<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Officials on Sunday carried sealed
ballot boxes to heavily guarded locations across the country to
prepare for the counting of votes for India's next government.
<p>
   Counting begins at 8.00 a.m. Monday for most constituencies. Two
exit polls released on Saturday indicated strong support for Hindu
nationalists.
<p>
   More than 300 million of India's 600 million voters have cast
ballots in the election, which has been staggered over six
nonconsecutive days to give security forces time to move across a
country where religious, ethnic and caste difference often erupt
into violence.
<p>
   Despite the precautions, blood was spilled on each of the four
voting days since Feb. 16. Eight people were killed in
election-related violence on Saturday, bringing the death toll to
at least 76.
<p>
   Voting ended Saturday for all but six of the 543 contested seats
in parliament.
<p>
   Elections in eastern Bihar state have been the most violent. The
Election Commission had to conduct fresh balloting in nearly 5,000
of the 82,000 voting stations in the state, which is known for its
lawlessness.
<p>
   The commission ordered that armed policemen and video cameras be
used to try to ensure against ballot tampering in Bihar.
<p>
   Fresh voting was also scheduled in some areas of Gujarat and
Orissa states where vote fraud was suspected.
<p>
   And armed guards were deployed in northeastern states where
separatist rebels had tried to enforce a poll boycott.
<p>
   First results are not expected until late Monday.
<p>
   No single party is expected to win an outright majority in the
powerful lower house of parliament. But a poll broadcast on the
government-run television showed the Bharatiya Janata Party and its
allies winning 244 seats, making gains in almost every corner of
the country but still falling short of the majority needed for a
government.
<p>
   A second poll, aired on a private TV channel, said the BJP would
get 208 seats. The same broadcast forecast that the Congress Party,
which led India for 45 of its 50 years since independence, would
win 167 seats.
<p>
   Buoyed by the exit poll results, the BJP held a meeting in New
Delhi on Sunday and said they would begin talks with electoral
allies on March 4 about the possible formation of a government.

Two killed in fireworks explosion at student center
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Two college students died when
fireworks exploded at a party in the college's student center. Six
other students and two firemen suffered smoke-inhalation.
<p>
   The Saturday evening explosion took place at the student center
for the Boraas technical institute, about 350 kilometers (210
miles) southwest of Stockholm.
<p>
   Officials said about 80 students had gathered for a dinner at
close of an annual darts tournament and that the fireworks were to
be set off in the three-story brick building's cellar at the
conclusion of the dinner.
<p>
   It was not immediately known what caused the explosion.
<p>
   ``The fire developed quickly into an utter inferno,'' local
emergency services chief Kjell Wahlbeck told a news conference
Sunday.
<p>
   Identities for the two dead students were not immediately given,
but the Swedish news agency TT said both were 25-year-old males.

ASEAN asking U.N. for help to fight forest fires
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  Southeast Asian countries are
seeking international help to fight forest fires because the
problem will affect the global climate, a senior Malaysian official
said Sunday.
<p>
   Law Hieng Ding, the minister of science, technology and
environment, said the nine-country Association of Southeast Asian
Nations has asked the United Nations Environment Program to help it
obtain money and technical aid from the World Bank and wealthy
nations.
<p>
   A study by an ASEAN scientist indicated that the amount of
carbon dioxide released during the forest fires in Indonesia last
year equalled the amount generated in all of Europe in one year,
the news agency Bernama quoted him as saying.
<p>
   Carbon dioxide is one of the ``greenhouse gases'' that can trap
heat in the Earth's atmosphere.

Condition of ailing Greek Orthodox leader deteriorates
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  The condition of the ailing head of the
Greek Orthodox church, Archbishop Seraphim, deteriorated Sunday as
he struggled to fight off a viral infection, doctors said.
<p>
   Physicians treating Seraphim, 84, at Athens' Popular Hospital
declined to comment on whether there was a possibility of his
recovering, saying that ``miracles can happen,'' local media
reported.
<p>
   Many politicians and priests have visited Seraphim over the past
two days, and he reportedly received his last rites on Saturday.
<p>
   The archbishop, who was hospitalized Wednesday, also spent two
days in a hospital in early February after suffering complications
during kidney dialysis, a procedure he has undergone three times a
week since 1996.
<p>
   Seraphim, known for his mercurial temper and clashes with
politicians and clerics alike, has led the country's Orthodox
Christians since his appointment as archbishop in 1974.
<p>
   Nearly 99 percent of Greece's 10.2 million residents are
baptized into the church, while at least 5 million Greek Orthodox
are thought to live abroad.
<p>
   Despite his declining health, Seraphim has flatly refused calls
from his clerics to resign.

Olazabal comes from behind to win Dubai Desert Classic
Eds: ADDS details, quotes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Fighting a serious bout of
flu, coughing fits and a swirling sandstorm, Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal came from behind to capture the Dubai Desert Classic title
Sunday.
<p>
   Winning by three shots with a brilliant 4-under-par 68 in the
final round, Olazabal walked away with the 130,000-pound (dlrs
221,000) first prize after he almost withdrew on Friday.
<p>
   ``It's absolutely fantastic,'' said an overwhelmed Olazabal.
``I'm shocked because of what I have done. I felt bad, really bad
and the first two days were obviously the worst. Every single
muscle ached.
<p>
   ``I haven't been able to eat any solids since Wednesday and
survived on yogurts, fruit juices and tea,'' said the 32-year-old
Spaniard, who said it was his best win since the 1994 U.S. Masters.
<p>
   The Spaniard, who made a comeback here last year after a
career-threatening foot injury sidelined him for 18 months, began
the day three shots behind leader Robert Karlsson of Sweden.
Karlsson faded on the back nine after staying in front for the
early part of the final round on the par-72 Emirates Golf Club
course.
<p>
   Olazabal clinched victory with birdies on the 17th and 18th. He
carded an eagle on the 13th, giving him the lead to end with a
19-under-par 269 for four rounds.
<p>
   Australian Stephen Allan also made a late charge Sunday to move
from six shots off the lead to take second place and 85,000 pounds
(dlrs 145,000) with a 4-under-par 68.
<p>
   Karlsson, who led after three rounds, found it vastly different
Sunday, shooting a 3-over 75 to finish tied for third with South
African Ernie Els. Els closed Sunday with a par 72.
<p>
   ``I simply didn't play well enough and I didn't give myself any
chances,'' said the 28-year-old Karlsson. ``The slightest chances I
did have, I didn't take. I'm disappointed I didn't keep it up all
the way.
<p>
   The desert winds that whipped up a sandstorm made putting
difficult in the morning and early afternoon and troubled the likes
of Greg Norman of Australia, Ignacio Garrido of Spain, and Welshman
Ian Woosnam.
<p>
   Garrido, in contention early, had an atrocious final round with
six bogeys, including successive ones on the 3rd, 4th and 5th.
<p>
   Woosnam, who celebrates his 40th birthday Monday, was fifth on
13-under 275 after Sunday's round of 73. Norman shared sixth with
Garrido and Lee Westwood of England.

Saudi minister gives terms for restoring relations with Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Saudi Arabia will restore relations with
Iraq if Baghdad puts all U.N. Security Council resolutions into
effect, the kingdom's foreign minister said Sunday.
<p>
   Speaking to reporters in Cairo after talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Prince Saud al-Faisal said Saudi Arabia
wanted what the world required of Iraq: ``the full implementation
of the (U.N.) Security Council resolutions.''
<p>
   ``If these are implemented, then Iraq's problems will be solved,
including normalization'' of relations, he said.
<p>
   The Saudis broke off relations with Baghdad after Iraqi forces
overran Kuwait in 1990. During the subsequent Gulf War, a column of
Iraqi troops crossed into the kingdom but were quickly repulsed by
the U.S.-led coalition in which Saudi forces figured prominently.
<p>
   However, during the recent Iraqi standoff with the United
Nations over weapons inspections, the Riyadh government said it
would not allow U.S. forces to launch strikes on Iraq from Saudi
soil.
<p>
   Prince Saud, who arrived in Cairo Sunday for a one day visit,
said his talks with Mubarak focused on the latest developments in
the region, including the Iraqi crisis and efforts at establishing
peace in the Middle East.

Report: Syria wants to resume peace talks with Israel
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu comments
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday
that Israel will not withdraw unilaterally from southern Lebanon.
<p>
   Netanyahu had said Friday he had ``no qualms'' about U.N.
Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal
from territory it occupies in south Lebanon.
<p>
   ``We're interested in leaving Lebanon with the necessary
security safeguards,'' he added.
<p>
   Netanyahu clarified his position on Sunday, telling his Cabinet
that Israel has no plans to make a unilateral withdrawal because,
he argued, that would lead to more attacks on northern Israel by
the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah.
<p>
   ``If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making
appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be
happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of
U.N. Resolution 425,'' he said.
<p>
   The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu made his
comments about Resolution 425 in response to signals from Syria
that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two
countries.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
signalled its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel and Syria cut off talks nearly two years ago.

Report: Army kills 17 Hutu rebels in central Rwanda
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP)  &MD;  Soldiers killed at least 17 Hutu
extremists rebels who attempted to storm a prison in the country's
central Gitarama prefecture, the private Rwandan News Agency
reported on Sunday.
<p>
   It said the killings occurred Saturday when the rebels launched
attacks on the communes of Nyakabanda and Bulinga in Gitarama
prefecture, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Rwanda's
capital, Kigali.
<p>
   The rebels also abducted an undetermined number of people, the
agency said.
<p>
   ``The insurgents attempted to storm Nyakabanda prison, but were
repulsed by security forces,'' an officials in Gitarama was quoted
as saying.
<p>
   The official said the Hutus also tried to burn down a local
secondary school and to loot a private water company.
<p>
   ``Seventeen insurgents died on the spot and many more are
suspected to have perished,'' the unidentified official was quoted
as saying by the agency.
<p>
   The agency, which made no mention of army casualties, said the
rebels fled in the direction of Gisenyi prefecture, which borders
the Democratic Republic of Congo, former Zaire.
<p>
   The Rwandan Patriotic Army has been fighting a heightened
insurgency for more than a year, since the mass return of Hutu
refugees from exile in Congo in November 1996, among them armed
rebels.
<p>
   The rebels are believed to have participated in the 1994 Hutu
genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
<p>
   The Tutsis regained control of the government in July 1994.

Iran, Ital call for new relations with EU
Eds: UPDATES with quotes by Kharrazi and Nateq-Nouri; ADDS byline

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Encouraged by improving relations between
Iran and Europe, the foreign ministers of Italy and Iran Sunday
called for a new era of cooperation between the two sides.
<p>
   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, the first Western
Cabinet official in Iran since the EU lifted a ban on high level
visits, said the EU's past policy of trying to bring change in Iran
through ``critical dialogue'' is over.
<p>
   ``It is not a critical dialogue  &MD;  we do know that did not prove
successful,'' Dini said after an hour-long meeting with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi.
<p>
   ``We are looking to an open dialogue on all matters of common
concern,'' Dini, speaking in English, told a joint news conference
with Kharrazi.
<p>
   Earlier this week, EU foreign ministers said a number of
encouraging developments  &MD;  including the election in May of
relatively moderate cleric President Mohammad Khatami  &MD;  required a
positive response toward the country.
<p>
   Kharrazi also welcomed the new EU initiative toward his country,
and called for broader exchanges.
<p>
   ``The era of criticizing one another is over. Now is the time to
cooperate. We should look to the future and increase the fields of
cooperation and promote mutual understanding between Iran and
Europe,'' Kharrazi said.
<p>
   The new EU position differs sharply from U.S. policy, which sees
Iran as a rogue state that must be isolated. U.S. sanctions bans
large investments in Iran by any country.
<p>
   But the United States will also have to change its stance soon,
Dini was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
<p>
   It said Dini, during a meeting with the powerful parliament
speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, said that ``following the
improvement of relations between Europe and Iran, the U.S. will
become familiar with the important position and role of Iran (and)
would finally be forced to change its behavior toward Iran.''
<p>
   A ban on Cabinet-level visits was imposed by the EU last April
after a German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Relations had
earlier soured because of Iran's death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie.
<p>
   Dini, who arrived in Tehran late Saturday for a three-day visit,
said Italy's relations with Iran are ``all encompassing.''
<p>
   State-run Tehran radio noted that unlike Iran's ties with other
European countries, it had never had any problems with Rome.
<p>
   ``Italy has generally played the role of neutral and
constructive mediator,'' the radio said in a commentary. It said
bilateral trade last year totaled more than dlrs 2.5 billion last
year.
<p>
   Boosting trade ties may be one reason why the Italians rushed in
while others hesitated: Italy announced Dini's visit to Tehran just
48 hours after the ban on visits was lifted. Italy's La Stampa
newspaper suggested Rome was trying to beat the French to Tehran.
Germany and France are Iran's largest European investors.

Report: 700 mobile homes empty in Jewish settlements
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A confidential housing ministry report says
there are over 700 empty mobile homes in Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, yet the government has allocated 300 more, Israel radio
reported Sunday.
<p>
   According to the report, the 300 new mobile homes are to be sent
precisely to those settlements which already have empty trailers,
the radio said.
<p>
   Mobile homes are used by the settlers to establish new
settlements or expand existing ones, sometimes in defiance of the
government.
<p>
   The Housing Ministry did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press on Sunday. But Shlomo Filber, an official of the
settlers council, said the figure of 700 empty caravans was grossly
exaggerated.
<p>
   ``In most of the settlements there is not even one vacant
home,'' he told the AP.
<p>
   Opposition legislator Eitan Kabel, a senior adviser to the
minister of housing in the previous Labor government, said the
government's allocation of more mobile homes to the settlements was
a waste of money and should be stopped.
<p>
   The Palestinians regard Jewish settlement activity in the West
Bank as a threat to their prospects of establishing a Palestinian
state and a violation of the Oslo agreements.
<p>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has called for a
``timeout'' in settlement activity, in a move to break the deadlock
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
<p>
   The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
settlement activity is not prohibited in the Oslo agreements.
Netanyahu has said no new settlements will be built for the
present, but existing settlements will be expanded to accommodate
``natural growth.''

Austria's Davis Cup doctor apologizes to Muster
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  The doctor assigned to Austria's Davis
Cup team apologized for warning Thomas Muster to quit tennis,
praising him as a ``physical and psychological phenomena,'' media
reported Sunday.
<p>
   Dr. Rudolf Schabus, an emergency surgeon who has served the
country's Davis Cup team for years, told the daily Kurier that he
retracted his earlier statement that Muster should quit the sport
for health reasons, admitting that he hadn't seen Muster in years.
<p>
   ``Thomas is a physical and psychological phenomena and I hope he
will continue to be a top sportsman for a long while,'' Schabus
told Kurier.
<p>
   On Friday, Schabus had said it was ``no longer recommended that
Muster continue playing tennis'' due to severe arthritis in his
left knee and a shortening of his left leg because of an operation
on the knee.
<p>
   Muster's coach, Ronald Leitgeb, angrily rejected the comments.
<p>
   Muster's next tournament begins March 9 in Indian Wells,
Califirnia, where he reached the semifinals last year before losing
to Michael Chang, who went on to win the event.
<p>
   Muster who has slid in recent years and is now ranked 20th by
the ATP, failed to defend his Dubai Open title in February, losing
to Nicolas Kiefer.

Prodi denies that he wants early Italian elections
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Saying that Italy needs continued political
stability, Premier Romano Prodi, in comments published Sunday,
denied that he wants early elections.
<p>
   Turin daily La Stampa on Saturday wrote that Prodi, encouraged
by recent good economic data preparing the way for Italy's
participation in European monetary union, was considering an early
date at the polls.
<p>
   Also reportedly figuring in consideration of elections is the
state of the center-right opposition, beaten badly in local
elections around Italy last year and currently searching for a
strong leader as ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi battles legal woes
linked to his media empire.
<p>
   Prodi's center-left Olive Tree coalition came to power after the
last parliamentary elections two years ago.
<p>
   In a letter published Sunday by La Stampa, Prodi said of the
report he was favoring elections soon: ``I never thought, not even
for a single instant, that the problems that are still ahead of
us...could be in the least way facilitated by new elections.''
<p>
   Italy, while making great strides in reducing its budget
deficit, is battling unemployment, running 12 percent nationally
and has a long way to go in its ambitious privatization of
sprawling state industry.
<p>
   Prodi wrote that early elections would be ``a dangerous
interruption of a period of fruitful stability, finally normal and
fully European.''
<p>
   Referring to decades of ``revolving-door'' governments which
made Italy an object of ridicule, Prodi said European partners,
``after a brief period of surprise and even incredulity, are
learing to associate with Italy, an Italy, meeting after meeting,
represented by the same ministers, by the same premier.''

Jordan and Shell sign oil agreement
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  Jordan has signed an agreement with the
Dutch-based Shell Co., allowing the oil company to pump crude from
underground shale in the desert kingdom, the minister of energy
said Sunday.
<p>
   Mohammed Saleh Hourani said Shell's cost for extracting the oil
will range from dlrs 9 to dlrs 11 per barrel, if commercially
viable quantities of oil are found.
<p>
   The deal was reached earlier in the week, he said.
<p>
   A recent study by the state-run Natural Resources Authority
suggested that Jordan's reserve of oil shale is 40 billion tons in
its southwestern desert areas.
<p>
   Hourani added that Jordan has received several offers from
international consortia seeking to build a refinery in the Red Sea
port city of Aqaba, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the
Jordanian capital Amman.
<p>
   He refused to name the companies, but said Jordan would sign an
agreement with the winner in May. One consortium includes three
U.S. companies and another has seven Arab, Japanese, European and
U.S. members.
<p>
   The refinery would cost dlrs 2 billion and have a capacity of
250,000 barrels per day, he said. The government announced plans to
build it in early 1995, after Jordan signed a peace treaty with
Israel.
<p>
   Officials said the refinery would sell to markets in Asia,
Israel and the Palestinian territories. Jordan has no oil of its
own, but the government has said the refinery would depend on crude
from Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab Gulf states.
<p>
   The Aqaba refinery would be the second in Jordan. The kingdom
now has a refinery in the southeastern city of Zarqa that processes
90,000 barrels of crude a day.
<p>
   In a related development, Hourani said the government has signed
an agreement with a Russian firm to explore for oil and natural gas
inside Jordan. He declined to name the firm.

Ahmed bowls Pakistan to a strong position
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Leg spinner Mushtaq Ahmed bowled
Pakistan to a strong position in the second cricket test against
South Africa on Sunday.
<p>
   The Multan born Ahmed took 6-66 in 35 unchanged overs to leave
South Africa struggling on 186 for eight after being set 255 runs
to win.
<p>
   Earlier Pakistan resuming the second innings on 222 for eight
was bowled out for 226, the innings lasting just eight balls in
nine minutes.
<p>
   The South African second innings crumbled as fast as the
Kingsmead pitch and only a stubborn ninth wicket stand has stopped
Pakistan of wrapping up the test inside four days.
<p>
   Mark Boucher and No.10 Fanie de Villiers have stage a minor
recovery rescuing the side from a precariously placed 133 for
eight.
<p>
   The two have put on 53 runs in 59 minutes and have benefited
from two dropped catches and a half chance.
<p>
   Both batsmen were dropped in successive overs as Pakistan let
the home side off the hook.
<p>
   Bad light stopped play seven overs short when the two umpires
Mervyn Kitchen and Dave Orchard offered the light to the two
batsmen as Pakistan took the second new ball.
<p>
   Boucher has so far scored with 36 while de Villiers was on 26
and South Africa need another 68 runs to go one up in the
three-match series.
<p>
   Ahmed was outstanding in his post lunch session spell as he
broke the backbone of South Africa's victory hopes.
<p>
   Operating on a wicket that was getting increasingly spin
friendly, 27-year-old Ahmed claimed 4-19 in 15 overs to turn the
home side's victory chase into a battle for survival.
<p>
   Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis put on 40 for the second wicket
but as soon Ahmed was introduced neither looked comfortable.
<p>
   Kirsten was eventually put out of his misery when he was caught
by substitute Rashid Latif at silly-point for 25. First of Ahmed's
six victims, and the 150th of his test career, Kirsten had
struggled for 104 minutes.
<p>
   Kallis edged a leg side catch to way, he got a faint touch and
'keeper Moin Khan held the catch. Kallis's 22 has taken 113
minutes.
<p>
   Hylton Ackerman was trapped leg before by top spinner for 11.
<p>
   Hudson fell in trying to hit his way out of trouble and only
succeeded in hitting a catch to Fazal-e-Akbar at deep mid-off and
South Africa was struggling on 79 for five.
<p>
   Shaun Pollock, South Africa's bowling hero with 6-50 in
Pakistan's second innings took the attack to the Pakistanis with a
38-ball 30 runs.
<p>
   Pollock threatened briefly with Hansie Cronje in a 35-run sixth
wicket stand but once skipper fell to a rare rash shot, Ahmed
removed Pollock.
<p>
   Pollock, who took hit an unbeaten in South Africa's first
innings 231, charged Ahmed and was smartly stumped by Moin Khan.

Udinese falls further from leaders; Roma routs Fiorentina
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Juventus of Turin and Inter Milan got the victories
they needed to stay in the thick of the Serie A title race. Lazio
of Rome and Udinese did not.
<p>
   Italy's top four clubs all had trouble against relegation
battlers this weekend, and Udinese made the biggest mis-step,
losing 1-0 at Empoli Sunday. Lazio managed only a 0-0 draw against
Atalanta of Bergamo Saturday.
<p>
   Also Saturday, Juventus edged Bari 1-0 thanks to an own-goal and
expulsion, while Inter Milan handled last-place Napoli 2-0 after a
scoreless first half.
<p>
   ``These games are very risky: you have no choice but to win, and
therefore you've got everything to lose,'' Inter coach Luigi Simoni
said.
<p>
   With 11 games to go, defending champion Juventus tops the table
with 51 points. Inter has 47, Lazio 45 and Udinese 42.
<p>
   Streaking AS Roma is another point back after striker Marco
Delvecchio, making a rare start, scored twice to lead a 4-1 rout of
Fiorentina Sunday. Roma has won four straight games and next
squares off with Lazio in the capital's derby.
<p>
   Fiorentina came back to earth after last week's surprising 3-0
win over Juventus, a result that helped open up the challenge for
the title.
<p>
   Elsewhere Sunday, AC Parma rallied for a 2-1 victory against
Roberto Baggio's Bologna to match Roma with 41 points. Roma leads
on goal differential.
<p>
   In other games: AC Milan drew 0-0 at next-to-last Lecce; Cup
Winners Cup quarterfinalist Vicenza edged Brescia 2-1 to move away
from the relegation zone, and Piacenza handed Sampdoria of Genoa
its third consecutive defeat 1-0. &QL; 
 &UR; Roma 4, Fiorentina 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Rome, Delvecchio helped start the scoring by heading on a
free kick to Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio, who tallied his sixth
goal of the season in the 12th minute. Delvecchio then hit his
goals, both from close range, in the 30th and 41st. Francesco Totti
made it 4-0 for the hosts (11-8-4) in the 55th, curling in a free
kick from the edge of the penalty area for his career-high seventh
goal.
<p>
   Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta saved some face for Fiorentina
(10-8-5) by scoring his 16th goal in the 66th minute, but not
before he had seen his earlier penalty kick saved by Roma's
Austrian 'keeper Michael Konsel. &QL; 
 &UR; Parma 2, Bologna 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Bologna, where Parma (11-8-4) last lost in the 1987-88
season, all the goals came on headers before halftime.
<p>
   Defender Michele Paramatti put Bologna (6-8-9) ahead 12 minutes
into the match, but Parma struck right back. Croat midfielder Mario
Stanic scored from 11 meters (yards) out to level the score in the
16th minute, and veteran midfielder Massimo Crippa tallied the
winner from 5 meters (yards) in the 28th.
<p>
   Bologna could not rally, particularly after midfielder Giancarlo
Marocchi was sent off in the 71st. Baggio, Italy's 1994 World Cup
star, twice missed golden chances to score for Bologna, which also
saw forward Carlo Nervo hit the crossbar in the final minute. &QL;

Netanyahu to discuss peace efforts during trip to Europe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel
to Europe at the end of the week for discussions about Middle East
peace efforts and Israel's relationship with the European
Community, his office said Sunday.
<p>
   Netanyahu will start his four-day trip in Madrid, where he is
scheduled to meet Thursday with the King of Spain and Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, as well as with Jewish European leaders.
<p>
   On Friday Netanyahu will travel to Bonn to meet with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl about Israel's stalled effort to settle its
decades-old dispute with the Palestinians.
<p>
   Netanyahu's last scheduled stop is Oslo, where he will spend the
weekend holding discussions with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik and Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek on peace
efforts.
<p>
   Norway helped guide the 1993 peace agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians  &MD;  an agreement that has ground almost to a halt.
<p>
   Netanyahu has held the foreign minister's portfolio since David
Levy resigned in January.

Newborn babies of priestly caste sought
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  It's a difficult sell: Place your baby son in
an isolated compound for the first 13 years of his life so he can
be raised in conditions of ritual purity.
<p>
   Then, if the Jewish Temple is rebuilt for the first time in
almost 2,000 years, he'll be ready to serve as a high priest.
<p>
   That's the offer the Movement for Establishing the Temple, a
Jerusalem-based religious group, is offering ultra-Orthodox parents
in an intensive campaign to recruit boys of the Jewish priestly
caste known as Cohenim.
<p>
   ``We need families to donate their children for the cause  &MD;  it
will be hard at first, but once we start more will follow,'' said
Rabbi Yosef Elboim, who is in charge of finding parents-to-be who
are willing to allow their boy children to be raised as potential
priests.
<p>
   High priests would be needed to ritually purify the Jewish
people if the ancient Jewish Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70
A.D., is rebuilt.
<p>
   So far, several families have expressed interest and at least
one woman who is due to give birth in two months has agreed to have
her son raised for the priesthood.
<p>
   ``We hope he will be our pioneer  &MD;  we will start with him,''
said Elboim. Altogether, the group hopes to bring together a group
of about 20 babies to raise.
<p>
   The boys would be brought up in a special compound, which has
already been donated by a yeshiva. Frequent visits would be allowed
by parents, relatives and friends, who would have to observe strict
rules governing defilement.
<p>
   The boys would remain until at least their 13th birthdays on an
elevated floor of the compound, because touching the ground could
result in ritual defilement due to contact with unknown graves.
<p>
   Among the families who have expressed interest in raising their
sons through the Movement for Establishing the Temple are former
members of the outlawed right-wing Kach movement.
<p>
   ``The Temple is one of the central parts of our ideology  &MD;  we
view its rebuilding as part of Jewish experience,'' said former
Kach activist Noam Federman.
<p>
   Fears has been expressed in Israel that some extremist groups
might seek to rebuild the Temple on a site where some of Islam's
holiest shrines are located  &MD;  a move that would likely lead to an
explosion of violence.
<p>
   By tradition, a portent that the Temple is to be rebuilt would
be the appearance of a pure red heifer. Last year, there was a
flurry of excitement over the discovery of a red heifer named
Melody, originally believed to be the first of its kind born in the
Holy Land in two millennia.
<p>
   But later, white hairs were spotted on the young cow's tail and
she was deemed impure.
<p>
   According to ancient Jewish writings, the ashes of a red heifer
were mixed with spring water for high priests to purify themselves
before they entered the Temple.

<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Governor Gerhard Schroeder ran for
reelection Sunday in Lower Saxony state, and if things go his way,
he'll face another election in September  &MD;  this one, for the top
job in the land.
<p>
   Schroeder's Social Democratic party is using Sunday's vote as a
benchmark for choosing its candidate against long-serving
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The party hopes to bring the left back to
power after 16 years, appealing to voters ready for change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote. ``It's always that way
when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   The Social Democrats moved up the announcement of their
candidate to Monday, tying it directly to the Lower Saxony election
and sparking speculation that Schroeder is the man.
<p>
   Polls indicate that Schroeder has a far stronger chance to beat
Kohl on Sept. 27 that the Social Democratic Party leader Oskar
Lafontaine  &MD;  who suffered a bruising defeat to Kohl in the
chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, the 53-year-old Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge
to years of conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and
Blair last year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to
avenge four straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   Unemployment is this year's main election issue. And the Lower
Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid while
promoting flexible working hours, deregulation and innovation has
served him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy
industry and at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   ``He stands for economic competence,'' said student Jakob
Krovoza, 22.
<p>
   In the first major test of Social Democrat's strength in the
election year, 5.9 million voters in Lower Saxony will elect a
155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state premier, or
governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute majority in
the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   A majority of Lower Saxons seem to realize that a vote for
Schroeder on Sunday is really a vote to send him into the
chancellor's race  &MD;  and away from the direct interests of the
state.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the chancellor's
race, Kohl has been campaigning heavily for Schroeder's rival,
Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian Wulff.
<p>
   But Wulff doesn't have to win to block Schroeder's push to the
national stage.
<p>
   The incumbent has said he won't seek his party's nomination if
the Social Democrats loose support in his home state. For
Schroeder, that means voting results cannot drop two percentage
points below the 44.3 percent support it got in the last state
election in 1994.
<p>
   His assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   Critics such as Wulff note, however, that Schroeder has offered
few detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.

RETRANSMITTING to fix garble in header
Six months later, questions on Diana, perhaps never to be answered

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Six months later, bouquets of flowers no longer
rest against the 13th pillar of the Alma traffic tunnel.
<p>
   But just outside, the curious can still be found at any hour,
peering down into the subterranean passage. Or they stare at the
Flame of Liberty, a statue originally meant to honor
French-American ties but now a makeshift shrine to Diana, Princess
of Wales.
<p>
   Six months after the car crash that killed the princess, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, this plaza filled with
hand-scrawled tributes and wilting flowers is still called the
Place de l'Alma. But it has also become Diana's place.
<p>
   A bit farther east along the Seine, in the capital's main
courthouse, two judges are trying to answer one simple question:
How did this tragedy happen?
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE INVESTIGATION &QC; 
<p>
   Aided by the prestigious criminal brigade of the Paris police,
Herve Stephan and Marie-Christine Devidal have interviewed dozens
of witnesses. They've compiled a dossier running into the thousands
of pages. And a renowned police lab outside Paris is still testing
the wrecked Mercedes S280 that carried the victims.
<p>
   The probe is expected to last until late this year  &MD;  not unusual
for a case of this magnitude in France, though certainly unusual
for a traffic accident.
<p>
   But when all the painstaking work is done, will there be
answers? Witness accounts have been widely conflicting, and the man
investigators hoped would be the best witness of all  &MD;  bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, sole survivor of the crash  &MD;  remembers little of
the actual accident.
<p>
   Rees-Jones said Saturday he recalled more details after a series
of session with a psychiatrist and will meet again with the French
judge heading the investigation.
<p>
   Questions linger: What was the role of the paparazzi chasing the
Mercedes that night? Was driver Henri Paul's condition known to his
employer  &MD;  the Ritz Hotel, owned by Dodi's father, Mohamed Al
Fayed? Did Diana get adequate medical care? And finally, what about
that mysterious Fiat Uno, and will its driver ever be found?
<p>
   Al Fayed asks yet another question: Could this have been a
conspiracy? At least a few notes at the Alma memorial include the
angry charge: ``This was not an accident!''
<p>
   In the end, though, it appears likely the final story will be
mundane: a simple car crash, caused by a drunk driver, some bad
decisions and a brutal dose of bad luck.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE PAPARAZZI &QC; 
<p>
   In the early hours of Aug. 31, six photographers and a press
motorcyclist were arrested, strip-searched and detained for 48
hours. Three more were brought in later. All 10 remain under
official investigation on two charges: manslaughter and failure to
assist people in danger.
<p>
   At the start, the photographers were the focus of enormous rage
from a public eager to affix blame. Diana's brother came right out
and accused them of killing her. But then driver Paul's condition
came to light, and evidence appeared to point away from the men.
<p>
   Sources in the Paris prosecutor's office, speaking on condition
of anonymity, have told The Associated Press that prosecutor Maud
Coujard likely will soon recommend dropping the charge of
manslaughter against all 10 men and the non-assistance charge for
at least eight of them.
<p>
   Photographers Romuald Rat and Christian Martinez have received
the most attention. Rat reached into the car where Diana lay dying;
he says he has medical training and was trying to take her pulse.
And Martinez was said to have pushed police away, saying angrily:
``They let us work in Bosnia.'' But some witnesses, including the
first doctor on the scene, say the paparazzi didn't interfere.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE DRIVER &QC; 
<p>
   This much is certain: driver Paul, 41, a loyal Ritz employee,
was seriously drunk and on two prescription drugs, including
Prozac, when he took the wheel.
<p>
   Less certain is whether Ritz officials knew of Paul's condition
that night, whether they knew he had a chronic problem, and if they
knew he drank at the hotel bar before the fateful ride  &MD;  as some
have told investigators.
<p>
   If so, the Ritz could be liable in the crash, either criminally
or in a civil case filed by victims' families. Many feel some
action against the Ritz is inevitable.
<p>
   Over the months, troubling details have leaked from the
investigation. Among them: a police interview of a Ritz barman, who
allegedly said Ritz managers knew Paul had a drinking problem, but
pressured the barman not to divulge this ``for the good of the
royal family.''
<p>
   A friend of Paul's, Dominique Melo, told police that Paul would
sometimes drink alone at home to get over a failed love affair,
according to lawyers who've seen the case file.
<p>
   Another possibly thorny problem for the Ritz: Paul didn't have
the special chauffeur's license required to drive the Mercedes
S280.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE FIAT &QC; 
<p>
   The most tantalizing element of the investigation  &MD;  the
mysterious Fiat Uno  &MD;  has also been the most frustrating.
<p>
   Though numerous witnesses have described a car coming into
contact with the Mercedes just before it lost control, the accounts
have been conflicting. Moreover, no witness actually saw the
collision. Investigators have pored over the records of thousands
of Fiat Unos and interviewed hundreds of owners  &MD;  with no apparent
luck so far, despite some hopeful moments.
<p>
   Based on witness accounts and physical evidence, including paint
scrapes and shards of glass, investigators believe the speeding
Mercedes did sideswipe a Fiat before crashing. But how did the
small Fiat escape extensive damage from the much heavier Mercedes?
Where did it go? And why hasn't the driver turned up yet?
<p>
   Investigators believe the Fiat didn't belong to any of the
photographers now under investigation. And they have virtually lost
hope of finding it, sources close to the case tell the AP. Still,
the search for the needle in the haystack goes on.
<p>
   A former police commissioner conducting a private probe for Al
Fayed raised a stir recently when he said a damaged Fiat Uno had
been found, belonging to a photographer known to have tracked Diana
in the past. But police said the car had been ruled out.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
 &UR; DIANA'S CARE &QC; 
<p>
   In a new book, authors Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod quote
U.S. doctors as saying Diana would have had a better chance if
taken to the hospital sooner, rather than given 30-45 minutes of
on-site treatment.
<p>
   The authors also question the wisdom of a slow ride to the
hospital  &MD;  40 minutes instead of the usual 10  &MD;  for fear of bumping
or jerking.
<p>
   France's health minister recently conceded the French method was
a subject of debate. But he said the issue was moot in this case
because Diana's severe injuries doomed her from the start.

World Bank wants to assist in clearing land mines in El-Alamein
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  The World Bank wants to assist Egypt in
clearing land mines left over from World War II in the Western
Desert to increase investments in that region, an Egyptian news
agency reported Sunday.
<p>
   The World Bank initiative  &MD;  similar to programs in Bosnia and
Herzegovina  &MD;  will focus on El-Alamein, a World Bank vice
president, Kamal Darwish, was quoted as saying by the Middle East
New Agency.
<p>
   The clearing up of El-Alamein for business purposes would be in
line with Egypt's IMF-inspired economic reform program aimed at
attracting foreign investments.
<p>
   Egypt's accomplishments in reducing its national debt,
increasing the gross domestic product and boosting private sector
development have been lauded by the World Bank, Darwish said. He
was speaking during the closing session of a seminar on Egypt and
the world economy, MENA said.
<p>
   While it was not clear how much assistance the Bank is willing
to provide, Egypt says it needs dlrs 200 million to clean up the
225-mile (365-kilometer) wide stretch of land between Libya's
border and El Alamein, where Britain's 8th Army halted Nazi
Germany's thrust toward the Suez Canal in a crucial World War II
battle.
<p>
   Egyptian officials estimate 17 million land mines still remain
in the region. There are no exact independent figures.
<p>
   Egypt argues that since it did not plant the mines, it should
not be expected to foot the bill for removing them. Britain and the
European Union have already offered over dlrs 2.5 million.

BC-Sports-Soccer-Italian Roundup, 1st Add
ROME: final minute.
Empoli 1, Udinese 0
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   At Empoli, midfielder Raffaele Ametrano, who used to play for
Udinese, earned a penalty kick that Carmine Esposito converted in
the 35th minute for the winner. German striker Oliver Bierhoff, the
league's leading scorer with 17 goals, was not a factor as Udinese
(12-6-5) lost for just the second time in its last 16 games. Empoli
improved to 6-5-12 and is in a group of four clubs that have 23
points and are tied for the final demotion spot. &QL; 
 &UR; Lecce 0, Milan 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Lecce, Milan's highly-paid roster of international stars
failed to find the target against a team that was in Serie B last
season. Milan (9-8-6) saw its two-game winning streak snapped,
while Lecce (3-4-16) is now winless in 14. &QL; 
 &UR; Vicenza 2, Brescia 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Vicenza, defender Giacomo Dicara scored both goals for the
hosts (7-5-11), in the 12th and 85th minutes. Midfielder Antonio
Filippini temporarily equalized for Brescia (6-5-12) in the 71st. &QL; 
 &UR; Piacenza 1, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Piacenza, Roberto Murgita scored the game's lone goal in the
47th minute, heading in a free kick, as Piacenza improved to
4-11-8. Striker Vicenzo Montella had a chance to level for
Sampdoria (9-7-7) from the penalty spot in the 72nd, but sent his
shot wide. He has missed three penalties this season. &QL; 
 &UR; Juventus 1, Bari 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Turin, Juventus (15-6-2) may have been looking ahead to
Wednesday's Champions Cup game against Dynamo Kiev. The hosts took
the lead after 19 minutes, when Fillipo Inzaghi split two defenders
and struck a shot that deflected off Moroccan defender Rachid
Neqrouz and found the net. Bari is 6-5-12. &QL; 
 &UR; Inter 2, Napoli 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Milan, Chile's Ivan Zamorano scored off a nifty shot in the
63rd minute, flicking the ball home with his right heel on an
assist from winger Francesco Moriero. Napoli (2-4-17) then had
captain Roberto Ayala, the Argentine defender, sent off for arguing
with the referee. And Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA world player of
the year, made the visitors pay for the expulsion, breaking towards
the goal before being fouled by Francesco Baldini. The Brazilian
netted the ensuing penalty kick in the 73rd for his 15th goal with
Inter (14-5-4). &QL; 
 &UR; Atalanta 0, Lazio 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Bergamo, Lazio (13-6-4) suffered a letdown following its
rousing, back-to-back wins over Juventus in the Italian Cup and
Inter Milan in the league. Atalanta is 4-9-10. &QL;

Report: Netanyahu to appoint northern commander head of Mossad
Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with former Mossad agent arguing statements
obtained illegally
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly
plans to appoint Israel's northern army commander as head of the
Mossad spy agency, which has had its vaunted image tainted by
repeated botched operations.
<p>
   Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine is Netanyahu's top choice to replace
outgoing Mossad chief Danny Yatom, who resigned over the failed
attempt to assassinate an Islamic militant in Jordan last
September, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Sunday.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation came the day before the news broke that
Mossad agents had been caught trying to install a wiretap in
Switzerland. Reports said the target of the wiretap was the
Hezbollah guerrilla group.
<p>
   The incident followed the botched assassination attempt in
Jordan on Hamas political leader Khalid Mashaal, and the indictment
of a retired Mossad agent, Yehuda Gil, for fabricating reports that
Syria was preparing for war.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation paved the way for Netanyahu to try and patch
up relations with Jordan's King Hussein, who was deeply embarrassed
by the Mossad attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Hussein has said he would only resume security cooperation with
Israel once Yatom stepped down.
<p>
   Levine, 52, would reportedly take the Mossad post if it was
offered, news reports said.
<p>
   Also Sunday, Gil argued in a Tel Aviv court hearing that the
statements he made to police were obtained illegally and should be
inadmissable at his trial.
<p>
   Gill said he was tricked into making statements by interrogators
who told him it was an internal Mossad investigation, and later by
interrogators who threatened to handcuff him and drive him around
his hometown if he did not cooperate, Israel's Army Radio said.
<p>
   The court rejected his argument.

Austria's Davis Cup doctor apologizes to Muster
Eds: CLARIFIES date of Dubai Open, FIXES slug
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  The doctor assigned to Austria's Davis
Cup team apologized for warning Thomas Muster to quit tennis,
praising him as a ``physical and psychological phenomena,'' media
reported Sunday.
<p>
   Dr. Rudolf Schabus, an emergency surgeon who has served the
country's Davis Cup team for years, told the daily Kurier that he
retracted his earlier statement that Muster should quit the sport
for health reasons, admitting that he hadn't seen Muster in years.
<p>
   ``Thomas is a physical and psychological phenomena and I hope he
will continue to be a top sportsman for a long while,'' Schabus
told Kurier.
<p>
   On Friday, Schabus had said it was ``no longer recommended that
Muster continue playing tennis'' due to severe arthritis in his
left knee and a shortening of his left leg because of an operation
on the knee.
<p>
   Muster's coach, Ronald Leitgeb, angrily rejected the comments.
<p>
   Muster's next tournament begins March 9 in Indian Wells,
Califirnia, where he reached the semifinals last year before losing
to Michael Chang, who went on to win the event.
<p>
   Muster who has slid in recent years and is now ranked 20th by
the ATP, failed to defend his Dubai Open title in February, losing
to Nicolas Kiefer.

Report: Army kills 17 Hutu rebels in central Rwanda
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP)  &MD;  Soldiers killed at least 17 ethnic Hutu
fighters who tried to storm a prison, the private Rwandan News
Agency reported Sunday.
<p>
   It said the killings occurred Saturday in central Gitarama
prefecture, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) southwest of Rwanda's
capital, Kigali.
<p>
   The rebels abducted an undetermined number of people and tried
to burn down a local secondary school and loot a privately owned
water company, the agency quoted an unnamed official as saying.
<p>
   The rebels fled toward Congo, formerly Zaire, the agency said.
<p>
   Fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-controlled Rwandan
army has intensified during the past year, since Hutu refugees
returned en masse from exile in Congo in November 1996.
<p>
   The rebels are believed to have participated in the 1994 Hutu
slaughter of more than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
The Tutsis regained control of the government in July 1994.

   LINZ, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Jana Novotna easily defeated Dominique van
Roost to win the dlrs 450,000 Austrian open on Sunday.
<p>
   The 29-year-old Czech dominated the match, beating her Belgian

break and held her serve to 2-0, with another break to 3-0.
<p>
   Neither player lost her serve in the second set, but at the
beginning of the tie break, van Roost developed a slight shoulder
injury and was treated on the court. Play resumed with Novotna
leading 6-love. Van Roost fought off pain to save two match points,
but was no match for Novotna.
<p>
   After the match, van Roost said her shoulder bothered her for
the remainder of the game.

Austria's Davis Cup doctor apologizes to Muster
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  The doctor assigned to Austria's Davis
Cup team apologized for warning Thomas Muster to quit tennis,
praising him as a ``physical and psychological phenomena,'' media
reported Sunday.
<p>
   Dr. Rudolf Schabus, an emergency surgeon who has served the
country's Davis Cup team for years, told the daily Kurier that he
retracted his earlier statement that Muster should quit the sport
for health reasons, admitting that he hadn't seen Muster in years.
<p>
   ``Thomas is a physical and psychological phenomena and I hope he
will continue to be a top sportsman for a long while,'' Schabus
told Kurier.
<p>
   On Friday, Schabus had said it was ``no longer recommended that
Muster continue playing tennis'' due to severe arthritis in his
left knee and a shortening of his left leg because of an operation
on the knee.
<p>
   Muster's coach, Ronald Leitgeb, angrily rejected the comments.
<p>
   Muster's next tournament begins March 9 in Indian Wells,
Califirnia, where he reached the semifinals last year before losing
to Michael Chang, who went on to win the event.
<p>
   Muster who has slid in recent years and is now ranked 20th by
the ATP, failed to defend his Dubai Open title in February, losing
to Nicolas Kiefer.

<p>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  &MD;  The United Saudi Bank said Sunday
its net profits increased by 19 percent last year, reaching 406.1
million riyals (dlrs 108.3 million).
<p>
   The banks assets soared to 26.6 billion riyals (dlrs 7 billion)
in 1997  &MD;  an increase of no less than 123 percent.
<p>
   The bank said its customer deposits totaled 12.2 billion riyals
(dlrs 3.25 billion), compared with 7.6 billion riyals (dlrs 2
billion) in 1996.
<p>
   Earnings per share in 1997 amounted to 25.25 riyals (dlrs 6.73),
compared with 27.23 riyals (dlrs 7.26) the previous year.
<p>
   This is the first balance sheet put out by the bank since its
merger with Saudi Cairo Bank last year. The bank said it combined
figures from the two banks.
<p>
   Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, one of the bank's
major shareholders, masterminded the merger.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  The incidence of bouncing checks has risen
to such an extent that it is now harming Jordan's economic growth,
a government official said Sunday.
<p>
   The Central Bank reports that checks totaling 434.6 million
dinars (dlrs 612.1 million) bounced in 1997, a high figure for a
country with a population of 3.8 million, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The checks hinder growth by disrupting the payment cycle, the
official added.
<p>
   Commercial banks are now taking steps to deter the writing of
bad checks, such as closing such clients' accounts and blacklisting
them.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Revenues in the six Gulf
Cooperation Council countries are projected to fall an average 8
percent in 1998 to dlrs 74.3 billion, compared with dlrs 80.7
billion in 1997, because of declining oil prices, a report said
Sunday.
<p>
   Oil and gas revenues account for 90 percent of total revenues in
the GCC states, according to an Emirates Industrial Bank study. The
GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   The fall in crude prices has hindered the countries' attempts to
eliminate their budget deficits, the report said.
<p>
   The combined budget deficits of the GCC countries are projected
to increase 59 percent to dlrs 12.4 billion from dlrs 7.8 billion
in 1990, the report said, adding that the deficits will continue to
grow if the deterioration in prices of crude  &MD;  the region's
economic mainstay  &MD;  continues.
<p>
   ``The 1998 budget(s) of the GCC states were based on the
assumption that oil prices will revolve around dlrs 15 a barrel,
while actual prices fell to below dlrs 12 a barrel,'' the study
said.
<p>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' basket of
seven crude oils, which it uses to gauge the market, was priced at
dlrs 12.76 a barrel Thursday, up from dlrs 12.58 on Wednesday. When
OPEC met at the end of November, the basket averaged dlrs 18.81.
<p>
   The report said that government expenditure is the main factor
influencing regional economies and noted that government
expenditures are projected to fall to dlrs 86.7 billion in 1998
from dlrs 88.5 billion in 1997.
<p>
   The study ruled out a possible improvement in oil prices in 1998
because of increased Iraqi crude production under a new deal with
the U.N. and overproduction by OPEC members.
 &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  Jordanian and foreign investment groups
have agreed to invest dlrs 780 million in projects that could help
solve Jordan's water problems, a minister said Sunday.
<p>
   The Minister of Water and Irrigation, Munther Haddadin, said
that the projects include extracting ground water in the south of
Jordan as well as pumping stations and pipelines to lift surface
water from various areas in the kingdom and renewing water
networks.
<p>
   Haddadin told reporters that the projects will be financed by
the United States Agency for International Development, the World
Bank, German Construction Bank, the European Union, and the
governments of Japan, France and Italy as loans and grants.
<p>
   The investment plans are to cover Jordan until the year 2011.
<p>
   Haddadin said the interests on the loans will vary from 0.75
percent to 7 percent, repayable in 20 years with a seven to 10 year
grace period.
<p>
   ``This coincides with an urgent need to increase the volume of
water made available to the population,'' he said.
<p>
   Jordan, which has among the lowest per capita water availability
in the world, faces a future of very limited water resources. The
availability is expected to fall from the current rate of less than
7,063 cubic feet (211 cubic meters) per head per year to 3,178
cubic feet (95 cubic meters) per capita per year by the year 2025,
Haddadin said.

Udinese falls further from leaders; Roma routs Fiorentina
Eds: COMBINES pvs. RAISES Empoli-Udinese capsule.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Juventus of Turin and Inter Milan got the victories
they needed to stay in the thick of the Serie A title race. Lazio
of Rome and Udinese did not.
<p>
   Italy's top four clubs all had trouble against relegation
battlers this weekend, and Udinese made the biggest mis-step,
losing 1-0 at Empoli Sunday. Lazio managed only a 0-0 draw against
Atalanta of Bergamo Saturday.
<p>
   Also Saturday, Juventus edged Bari 1-0 thanks to an own-goal and
expulsion, while Inter Milan handled last-place Napoli 2-0 after a
scoreless first half.
<p>
   ``These games are very risky: you have no choice but to win, and
therefore you've got everything to lose,'' Inter coach Luigi Simoni
said.
<p>
   With 11 games to go, defending champion Juventus tops the table
with 51 points. Inter has 47, Lazio 45 and Udinese 42.
<p>
   Udinese lost for just the second time in 16 games, as its potent
attack failed to break through against Empoli. The winning goal
came on Carmine Esposito's penalty kick.
<p>
   Streaking AS Roma is one point behind Udinese after striker
Marco Delvecchio, making a rare start, scored twice to lead a 4-1
rout of Fiorentina Sunday. Roma has won four straight games and
next squares off with Lazio in the capital's derby.
<p>
   Fiorentina came back to earth after last week's surprising 3-0
win over Juventus, a result that helped open up the challenge for
the title.
<p>
   Elsewhere Sunday, AC Parma rallied for a 2-1 victory against
Roberto Baggio's Bologna to match Roma with 41 points. Roma leads
on goal differential.
<p>
   In other games: AC Milan drew 0-0 at next-to-last Lecce; Cup
Winners Cup quarterfinalist Vicenza edged Brescia 2-1 to move away
from the relegation zone, and Piacenza handed Sampdoria of Genoa
its third consecutive defeat 1-0. &QL; 
 &UR; Empoli 1, Udinese 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Empoli, midfielder Raffaele Ametrano, who used to play for
Udinese, earned the penalty that Esposito converted in the 35th
minute for his ninth goal. German striker Oliver Bierhoff, the
league's leading scorer with 17 goals, was not a factor for Udinese
(12-6-5). His best scoring chance came in the 53rd, but Empoli
'keeper Marco Roccati saved Bierhoff's header.
<p>
   Empoli improved to 6-5-12 and is in a group of four clubs that
have 23 points and are tied for the final demotion spot. &QL; 
 &UR; Roma 4, Fiorentina 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Rome, Delvecchio helped start the scoring by heading on a
free kick to Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio, who tallied his sixth
goal of the season in the 12th minute. Delvecchio then hit his
goals, both from close range, in the 30th and 41st. Francesco Totti
made it 4-0 for the hosts (11-8-4) in the 55th, curling in a free
kick from the edge of the penalty area for his career-high seventh
goal.
<p>
   Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta saved some face for Fiorentina
(10-8-5) by scoring his 16th goal in the 66th minute, but not
before he had seen his earlier penalty kick saved by Roma's
Austrian 'keeper Michael Konsel. &QL; 
 &UR; Parma 2, Bologna 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Bologna, where Parma (11-8-4) last lost in the 1987-88
season, all the goals came on headers before halftime.
<p>
   Defender Michele Paramatti put Bologna (6-8-9) ahead 12 minutes
into the match, but Parma struck right back. Croat midfielder Mario
Stanic scored from 11 meters (yards) out to level the score in the
16th minute, and veteran midfielder Massimo Crippa tallied the
winner from 5 meters (yards) in the 28th.
<p>
   Bologna could not rally, particularly after midfielder Giancarlo
Marocchi was sent off in the 71st. Baggio, Italy's 1994 World Cup
star, twice missed golden chances to score for Bologna, which also
saw forward Carlo Nervo hit the crossbar in the final minute. &QL; 
 &UR; Lecce 0, Milan 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Lecce, Milan's highly-paid roster of international stars
failed to find the target against a team that was in Serie B last
season. Milan (9-8-6) saw its two-game winning streak snapped,
while Lecce (3-4-16) is now winless in 14. &QL; 
 &UR; Vicenza 2, Brescia 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Vicenza, defender Giacomo Dicara scored both goals for the
hosts (7-5-11), in the 12th and 85th minutes. Midfielder Antonio
Filippini temporarily equalized for Brescia (6-5-12) in the 71st. &QL; 
 &UR; Piacenza 1, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Piacenza, Roberto Murgita scored the game's lone goal in the
47th minute, heading in a free kick, as Piacenza improved to
4-11-8. Striker Vicenzo Montella had a chance to level for
Sampdoria (9-7-7) from the penalty spot in the 72nd, but sent his
shot wide. He has missed three penalties this season. &QL; 
 &UR; Juventus 1, Bari 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Turin, Juventus (15-6-2) may have been looking ahead to
Wednesday's Champions Cup game against Dynamo Kiev. The hosts took
the lead after 19 minutes, when Fillipo Inzaghi split two defenders
and struck a shot that deflected off Moroccan defender Rachid
Neqrouz and found the net. Bari is 6-5-12. &QL; 
 &UR; Inter 2, Napoli 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Milan, Chile's Ivan Zamorano scored off a nifty shot in the
63rd minute, flicking the ball home with his right heel on an
assist from winger Francesco Moriero. Napoli (2-4-17) then had
captain Roberto Ayala, the Argentine defender, sent off for arguing
with the referee. And Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA world player of
the year, made the visitors pay for the expulsion, breaking towards
the goal before being fouled by Francesco Baldini. The Brazilian
netted the ensuing penalty kick in the 73rd for his 15th goal with
Inter (14-5-4). &QL; 
 &UR; Atalanta 0, Lazio 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Bergamo, Lazio (13-6-4) suffered a letdown following its
rousing, back-to-back wins over Juventus in the Italian Cup and
Inter Milan in the league. Atalanta is 4-9-10. &QL;

Sailors sunbathe, relax as Iraq tensions subside

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ABOARD THE HMS INVINCIBLE (AP)  &MD;  Bare-chested servicemen in
bathing suits and servicewomen in tank tops sunbathed on the flight
deck of the HMS Invincible as sailors enjoyed a quiet Sunday amid
falling tensions with Iraq.
<p>
   Below the deck of the British aircraft carrier, bicycles,
electronic games and other toys were tucked in different corners of
the ship:` Christmas presents that sailors are still waiting to
deliver to friends and families after some six months at sea.
<p>
   The ship is due back in its home port of Portsmouth later this
month.
<p>
   The aircraft carrier had been scheduled to return to Portsmouth
on Dec. 19, but was instead kept on duty because of mounting
tensions with Iraq. Britain and the United States had threatened
Iraq with air strikes if Baghdad refused to open suspected weapons
sites to U.N. arms inspectors.
<p>
   An agreement between Iraq and the United Nations in late
February seems to have forestalled a use of force.
<p>
   ``There was a definite lightening of the atmosphere aboard,''
said Capt. James Burnell-Nugent, the ship's captain.
<p>
   But he added that the carrier will launch its Harrier jets on
Monday to patrol the no-fly zone in southern Iraq as it has been
doing for weeks. Aircraft from the U.S. carriers George Washington
and Independence also have been patrolling the zone.
<p>
   The U.S. ships carry 50 strike aircraft each, while the far
smaller British warship carries only 16 fighters and bombers.
<p>
   ``There is no change,'' Burnell-Nugent said. ``We are still
flying.''
<p>
   Flights from the Invincible will end later this month when a
second British aircraft carrier, the Illustrious, takes over the
patrol duties.
<p>
   With the ship at anchor a few miles (kilometers) off the coast
of Bahrain, many soldiers took advantage of the lull in tensions to
relax aboard the ship.
<p>
   On the flight deck, about a dozen sailors, some bare chested and
wearing bathing suits, sunbathed and listened to music while lying
on mats and towels. A few women sailors in shorts, tanktops and
t-shirts lounged on the deck listening to music.
<p>
   The ship has a crew of about 1,200, including more than 100
women.
<p>
   Chief Petty Officer David Richards said he is looking forward to
getting back home to Andover to give his 2-year-old son, Samuel,
the model trucks and cars that he bought him for Christmas.
<p>
   ``He'll probably wreck my furniture,'' Richards said with a
grin.
<p>
   Richards, who coordinates training for engineers, said he was
able to take the day off after working six consecutive days.
<p>
   James Barry, an engineer aboard the ship, said he is skeptical
that the crisis is over, but added that ``obviously everybody is in
high spirits over the prospects of going home.''
<p>
   He said that when he gets home he plans to pull the top off of
his Triumph Spitfire convertible and go for a drive ``whether it's
raining or not.''
<p>
   But he said that after missing Christmas at home, he is trying
not to get too excited to avoid any possible disappointments.
<p>
   ``Christmas was the big blow,'' Barry said. ``People don't like
to let themselves feel relieved.''

Iran, Italy call for new relations with EU

<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Encouraged by improving relations between
Iran and Europe, the foreign ministers of Italy and Iran called
Sunday for a new era of cooperation between the two sides.
<p>
   The European Union's past policy of trying to bring change in
Iran through ``critical dialogue'' is over, said Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, the first Western Cabinet official to visit
Iran since the EU lifted a ban on high level visits..
<p>
   ``We do know that did not prove successful,'' Dini said after an
hour-long meeting with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi. ``We
are looking to an open dialogue on all matters of common concern.''
<p>
   Earlier this week, EU foreign ministers said several encouraging
developments  &MD;  including the election in May of relatively moderate
cleric President Mohammad Khatami  &MD;  required a positive response.
<p>
   Kharrazi welcomed the new EU initiative and called for broader
exchanges.
<p>
   ``The era of criticizing one another is over. Now is the time to
cooperate. We should look to the future and increase the fields of
cooperation and promote mutual understanding between Iran and
Europe,'' Kharrazi said.
<p>
   The new EU position differs sharply from U.S. policy, which sees
Iran as a rogue state that must be isolated. U.S. sanctions ban
large investments in Iran by any country.
<p>
   But the United States will also have to change its stance soon,
Dini was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
<p>
   ``Following the improvement of relations between Europe and
Iran, the U.S. will become familiar with the important position and
role of Iran (and) would finally be forced to change its behavior
toward Iran,'' it quoted Dini as telling parliament speaker, Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
<p>
   The EU imposed a ban on Cabinet-level visits last April after a
German court implicated Iranian authorities in the 1992
assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Relations had
earlier soured because of Iran's death sentence on British author
Salman Rushdie.

Egypt's soccer stars get rapturous welcome after Africa Cup
victory
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  About 25,000 Egyptians flocked to the Cairo
airport, some having walked for miles (kilometers), to meet the
national football team that returned home Sunday after winning the
African Nations Cup.
<p>
   President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury
also drove to the airport to welcome the team, which came from
behind to beat South Africa 2-0 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in
the final on Saturday.
<p>
   Such was the crowd that no vehicle could move. The visiting
Saudi Foreign Minister found his convoy blocked against a wall of
fans. He and Egypt's Foreign Minister, who met him at the airport,
were delayed for more than an hour.
<p>
   So too were hundreds of passengers scheduled to fly out of
Cairo. Several departing flights were delayed because not enough
travelers managed to penetrate the multitude to check-in on time.
<p>
   Throughout the day, Egypt's state-run television repeatedly
showed footage of goal-scoring shots in Saturday's match. It also
broadcast well-known patriotic songs.
<p>
   ``It is a tremendous success for the country  &MD;  one that
rekindles hope for future'' success, said Ahmed Moustafa, a
25-year-old engineer, who said he expected South Africa to win.
<p>
   Egypt's victory made the Pharaohs, as the team is known, the
continental champions for the fourth time  &MD;  a feat equaled only by
Ghana  &MD;  and provided a much needed boost for national morale after
the failure to make the World Cup in last year's qualifiers.
<p>
   The sea of fans began cheering as the team's EgyptAir plane
taxied into the terminal. Some supporters pounded small drums.
<p>
   About 1,000 airport employees rushed to the plane as its doors
opened, but were held back by phalanxes of soldiers and police.
<p>
   The first to disembark were team captain Hossam Hassan,
clutching the cup to his chest, and technical manager Mahmoud
el-Gohary who, with another player, held up the red, white and
black national flag.
<p>
   Mubarak shook the players' hands and kissed them on the cheek in
the traditional Arab greeting as they walked into the terminal on a
red carpet.
<p>
   ``If we had known that President Mubarak would receive us at the
airport, we would have won the championship a long time ago,''
Hassan quipped.
<p>
   ``What brings us happiness is that we found the entire Egyptian
people celebrating.'' Prime Minister el-Ganzoury said.
<p>
   As the players emerged from the terminal to take the coach to
Cairo, the fans broke into chants of ``Hossam, Hossam'' and
``Gohary, Gohary.''

BC-Israel-Priesthood Babies,0419
Wanted: newborn babies of priestly caste
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  It's a difficult sell: Place your baby son in
an isolated compound for the first 13 years of his life so he can
be raised in conditions of ritual purity.
<p>
   Then, if the Jewish Temple is rebuilt for the first time in
almost 2,000 years, he'll be ready to serve as a high priest.
<p>
   That's the offer the Movement for Establishing the Temple, a
Jerusalem-based religious group, is offering ultra-Orthodox parents
in an intensive campaign to recruit boys of the Jewish priestly
caste known as Cohenim.
<p>
   ``We need families to donate their children for the cause  &MD;  it
will be hard at first, but once we start more will follow,'' said
Rabbi Yosef Elboim, who is in charge of finding parents-to-be who
are willing to allow their boy children to be raised as potential
priests.
<p>
   High priests would be needed to ritually purify the Jewish
people if the ancient Jewish Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70
A.D., is rebuilt.
<p>
   So far, several families have expressed interest and at least
one woman who is due to give birth in two months has agreed to have
her son raised for the priesthood.
<p>
   ``We hope he will be our pioneer  &MD;  we will start with him,''
said Elboim. Altogether, the group hopes to bring together a group
of about 20 babies to raise.
<p>
   The boys would remain until at least their 13th birthdays on an
elevated floor of the compound because touching the ground could
result in ritual defilement due to contact with unknown graves.
<p>
   Among the families who have expressed interest in raising their
sons through the Movement for Establishing the Temple are former
members of the outlawed right-wing Kach movement.
<p>
   ``The Temple is one of the central parts of our ideology  &MD;  we
view its rebuilding as part of Jewish experience,'' said former
Kach activist Noam Federman.
<p>
   Fears has been expressed in Israel that some extremist groups
might seek to rebuild the Temple on a site where some of Islam's
holiest shrines are located  &MD;  a move that would likely lead to an
explosion of violence.
<p>
   By tradition, a portent that the Temple is to be rebuilt would
be the appearance of a pure red heifer. Last year, there was a
flurry of excitement over the discovery of a red heifer believed to
be the first of its kind born in the Holy Land in two millennia.
<p>
   But later, white hairs were spotted on the young cow's tail, and
she was deemed impure.

   MILAN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Hundreds of people, most of them Japanese
tourists, lined up outside a Milan church for hours Sunday to see
Leonardo da Vinci's ``The Last Supper'' after completion of a
20-year-long painting's latest restoration.
<p>
   Trying to prevent more deterioration by pollution of the late
15th-century painting, officials limited viewing to groups of 20
people for 15 minutes at a time, Italian TV reports said.
<p>
   By next year a reservation system should be in place to shorten
wait time, the TV reports said.
<p>
   The painting, on the wall of a dining hall in a monastery
adjacent to Santa Maria della Grazie church, has undergone 19 known
restorations in four centuries.
<p>
   The latest one, begun in 1978, aimed to restore badly faded
colors and undo some damage from previous restorations.
<p>
   In 1995, visitors began passing through two separate glass
cabins. Between the cabins, filters imperceptibly remove impurities
brought in from the outside, such as dust, and pump in clean air.
<p>
   Leonardo's use of tempera  &MD;  a technique less durable than true
fresco painting, which is done on wet plaster  &MD;  factored strongly
in the work's severe deterioration.

Paper: U.N. human rights chief prevented from meeting Khatami
Eds: UPDATES with comments by Robinson, newspaper editorial
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  A meeting between the U.N. human rights
chief and President Mohammad Khatami was canceled after officials
learned she planned to discuss Iran's poor human rights record, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
<p>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, was
scheduled to meet Khatami, but the meeting was canceled after her
spokesman spelled out in a BBC radio interview Saturday what she
wanted to discuss, the Farda daily said.
<p>
   It did not say when Robinson, who arrived in Tehran Saturday,
was scheduled to meet with Khatami.
<p>
   Asked about the newspaper report later Sunday, Robinson skirted
the question.
<p>
   ``I have an interest in having a direct opportunity to meet with
him and discuss various issues,'' she told reporters
<p>
   ``I am very hopeful that I can meet the president because I have
heard from very many sources of the important role he has played,''
she said.
<p>
   Farda quoted Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Javad
Zarif, as saying there would be no meeting with Khatami, a moderate
cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's foreign and domestic
policies since he took over in August after an overwhelming May
victory.
<p>
   Zarif said Robinson was in Tehran for the sole purpose of
attending a U.N. seminar on human rights, and not to discuss
allegations against Iran.
<p>
   ``The purpose of Ms. Robinson's visit was not about discussing
human rights accusations against Iran,'' the paper quoted Zarif as
saying.
<p>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday quoted
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a meeting with
Robinson that Western charges of human rights violations in Iran
were politically motivated and untrue.
<p>
   International human rights organizations accuse Iran of
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture, harsh prison
conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and
restrictions on basic freedoms.
<p>
   Iran denies the accusations, saying its Islamic laws and
punishments should not be judged by Western standards.
<p>
   ``Islam as a religion and a way of life, should never be
outrightightly condemened as attaching little importance to human
rights,'' the Tehran Times said in an editorial Sunday.
<p>
   ``One will commit a great blunder if he ignores these laws and
tries to judge certain acts of people without having a thorough
knowledge of these laws,'' the conservative English-language paper
said.

Turkey's president reaffirms boycott of March EU conference on eve
of visit to Spain
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Turkey will not be persuaded to attend the
upcoming meeting of European Union members and candidates for
membership in London on Mar.12, President Suleyman Demirel said in
interviews published Sunday in Spanish newspapers.
<p>
   ``Our European friends want us to go to London, but the
government does not have the necessary popular support to go'' he
said in the daily El Pais on the eve of a three-day visit to Spain
to start Tuesday.
<p>
   The Turkish boycott of the London conference was announced in
December after the 15 EU members offered membership talks to Cyprus
and five Eastern European nations, but rejected Turkey, citing its
unsatisfactory human rights record, its 30,000 troops in Cyprus and
its disputes with Greece.
<p>
   ``Turkey is now asking friendly countries like Spain to rectify
this error'' Demirel said in another daily La Vanguardia.
<p>
   ``We trust discrimination against Turkey will be overcome by
June's European summit in Cardiff'' he added.
<p>
   In the long term Demirel said he was confident that the EU will
allow Turkey to join up.
<p>
   ``Turkey will become part of the European Union. We must have
patience'' he said in La Vanguardia.
<p>
   According to the Turkish president the EU needs Turkey.
<p>
   ``A great Europe is impossible without Turkey which is the
bridge with Euroasia from the Adriatic to the Great Wall of China''
the La Vanguardia interview continued.
<p>
   In Sunday's interviews, Demirel also blamed Turkey's dubious
reputation in human rights on Kurdish separatists.
<p>
   ``The state is fighting (Kurdish) terrorists and sometimes
things can happen that I don't like'' he said.

Egypt's soccer stars get rapturous welcome after Africa Cup
victory
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  About 25,000 Egyptians flocked to the Cairo
airport to greet the national soccer team when it returned home
Sunday after winning the African Nations Cup.
<p>
   President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury
also were on hand to welcome the team, which beat South Africa 2-0
in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in the final on Saturday.
<p>
   The crowd was so large and traffic so bad that several departing
flights were delayed because not enough travelers managed to
penetrate the multitude to check in on time.
<p>
   Throughout the day, Egypt's state-run television repeatedly
showed footage of goal-scoring shots in Saturday's match. It also
broadcast well-known patriotic songs.
<p>
   ``It is a tremendous success for the country  &MD;  one that
rekindles hope for future'' success, said Ahmed Moustafa, a
25-year-old engineer who had expected South Africa to win.
<p>
   Egypt's victory made the Pharaohs, as the team is known, the
continental champions for the fourth time  &MD;  a feat equaled only by
Ghana  &MD;  and provided a much-needed boost for national morale after
the failure to make the World Cup in last year's qualifiers.
<p>
   The sea of fans began cheering as the team's EgyptAir plane
taxied into the terminal. Some supporters pounded small drums.
<p>
   About 1,000 airport employees rushed to the plane as its doors
opened, but were held back by soldiers and police.
<p>
   The first to disembark were team captain Hossam Hassan,
clutching the cup to his chest, and technical manager Mahmoud
el-Gohary who, with another player, held up the red, white and
black national flag.
<p>
   Mubarak shook the players' hands and kissed them on the cheek in
the traditional Arab greeting as they walked into the terminal on a
red carpet.
<p>
   ``If we had known that President Mubarak would receive us at the
airport, we would have won the championship a long time ago,''
Hassan quipped.
<p>
   ``What brings us happiness is that we found the entire Egyptian
people celebrating.'' Prime Minister el-Ganzoury said.

<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  In one of the biggest public demonstrations this
century, a quarter million country people poured into London on
Sunday to voice their fears for the future of the countryside and
protest legislation they say threatens the rural way of life.
<p>
   From the grouse moors of Scotland and the green valleys of Wales
and England, landowners and laborers, fox hunters and their
opponents brought their diverse grievances to the capital.
<p>
   In a show of strength that filled main roads through the city
center, they marched in complaint about a government many see as
unsympathetic and urban dwellers who don't understand their ways.
<p>
   Hunters in red coats, fishermen carrying their rods and reels,
men, women and children carrying banners and accompanied by a brass
band, marched two miles (3.2 km) from the Thames-side Victoria
Embankment through Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. Marchers cheered
and applauded when some hunters blew their horns.
<p>
   Scotland Yard said some 250,000 people participated  &MD;  the
biggest single demonstration in Britain since anti-nuclear marches
in the early 1980s.
<p>
   Michael Meacher, a government spokesman on the environment,
joined the marchers.
<p>
   ``I ... understand that one of the issues that people on this
march today are concerned about is that there should be a center
within government which addresses their interests,'' he told
British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
<p>
   But some marchers didn't believe the government is listening.
``Tony Blair Doesn't Care About Country Life'' proclaimed a placard
attacking the prime minister. ``This earth is for people, not just
New Labour'' said another in the forest of flags and banners waved
by marchers streaming toward Hyde Park.
<p>
   Fox hunting was at the heart of the matter, and a handful of
anti-hunting activists chanted ``fascists!'' at the marchers.

Report: 700 mobile homes empty in Jewish settlements
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A confidential Housing Ministry report says
there are more than 700 empty mobile homes in Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, yet the government has allocated 300 more, Israel
radio reported Sunday.
<p>
   According to the report, the 300 new mobile homes are to be sent
to the same settlements that already have empty trailers, the radio
said.
<p>
   Settlers use mobile homes to establish new settlements or expand
existing ones, sometimes in defiance of the government.
<p>
   The Housing Ministry did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press on Sunday. But Shlomo Filber, an official of the
settlers council, said the figure of 700 empty caravans was grossly
exaggerated.
<p>
   ``In most of the settlements there is not even one vacant
home,'' he told the AP.
<p>
   Opposition legislator Eitan Kabel, a senior adviser to the
minister of housing in the previous Labor government, said the
government's allocation of more mobile homes to the settlements was
a waste of money and should be stopped.
<p>
   The Palestinians regard Jewish settlement activity in the West
Bank as a threat to their prospects of establishing a Palestinian
state and a violation of the Oslo agreements.
<p>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has called for a
``timeout'' in settlement activity, in a move to break the deadlock
in the peace efforts between the Israelis and Palestinians.
<p>
   The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
settlement activity is not prohibited in the Oslo agreements.
Netanyahu has said no new settlements will be built for the
present, but existing settlements will be expanded to accommodate
``natural growth.''

Warships boost security at Freetown's port
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP)  &MD;  Warships from Britain and Nigerian
docked Sunday at Sierra Leone's main port in the capital to beef up
security in coastal waters and help with humanitarian programs.
<p>
   The Nigerian gunboat arrived Sunday at Freetown's Port Queen
Elizabeth and will escort incoming commercial ships, Capt. Ayodele
Adebayo said.
<p>
   Nigerian soldiers, as part of a West African coalition force,
played a lead role in ousting Sierra Leone's military junta last
month to clear the way for the country's elected president, Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
<p>
   The West African army is in full control of Freetown, but
fighting continues in other parts of the country, where troops
loyal to junta leader Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma are holding out.
<p>
   Koroma drove Kabbah into exile in May after a bloody coup.
<p>
   The arrival of the gunboat is an additional security measure for
Freetown, Adebayo said.
<p>
   ``Our presence here is to tell shipping companies that Sierra
Leone's territorial waters are free of mines and explosives. In
short, the port is free and open,'' Adebayo said.
<p>
   Freetown's port was effectively shut for about 10 months, as an
arms and ammunition embargo on Sierra Leone blocked other incoming
commercial shipping.
<p>
   Britain's HMS Cornwall also arrived Sunday from neighboring
Guinea.
<p>
   The ship's crew will assist British diplomats returning to
Sierra Leone and will provide support for humanitarian programs in
the battered capital, said Lt. Steve Lawrence, the ship's public
affairs officer.
<p>
   The ship's infirmary will be made available to people in urgent
need of medical treatment, Lawrence said.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sunday developments.
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in the troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Kosovo Albanians' leader appealed to the West to stop police
violence a day after clashes left at least seven people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Albanians who are demanding
secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States and the
European Union to pressure Belgrade to stop violent police actions.
``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent the Serb attacks, which
are aimed at ``intimidating and causing panic'' among the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, he said in a statement.
<p>
   Two Serb policemen were killed and two wounded on Saturday when
their patrol was ambushed near the village of Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of province's capital, Pristina.
<p>
   In a subsequent action, Serb police said they killed five
Albanian ``terrorists.''
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army began operating in 1996. The clandestine
ethnic Albanian militant group has claimed responsibility for
several terrorist attacks that have left more than 30 people dead.
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of all-out war in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
residents are ethnic Albanians.
<p>
   Both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources claim the death toll from
Saturday's clashes may be much higher, after Serb police used
helicopters and armored vehicles to sweep through ethnic Albanian
villages in the areas surrounding Glogovac.
<p>
   Sources close to Rugova claim that at least seven additional
ethnic Albanians were killed in the police operation. Belgrade
state-run Politika daily said that altogether four Serb policemen
were killed and three were wounded in Saturday's clashes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
<p>
   Gunfire and explosions could still be heard Sunday morning
around Glogovac and in nearby Srbica, the center of ethnic Albanian
rebellion in Kosovo, ethnic Albanian sources said. The region is
reportedly sealed off and surrounded by heavy Serb police forces
conducting house-to-house searches.
<p>
   Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.

Kafelnikov beats Pioline for Guardian Cup title
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Yevgeny Kafelnikov took a two-set victory Sunday
over France's Cedric Pioline, controlling a baseline match for the
Guardian Direct Cup indoor title in west London.
<p>
   The 24-year-old Russian had beaten Pioline in eight of nine
previous matches, and he stayed true to form winning 7-5, 6-4.
<p>
   Pioline, the surprise finalist last summer at Wimbledon, was
unseeded here and again unexpected in the final. But he couldn't
pull of the ultimate surprise.
<p>
   ``I have played him (Pioline) many, many times and I have only
lost once so I had the psychological edge,'' said the No. 3 seed,
who missed the Australian Open after suffering a ski accident over
Christmas.
<p>
   ``The surface here is good for big servers like (Goran)
Ivanisevic and (Greg) Rusedski. I do not have a booming serve but I
return very well and that is just as important,'' added Kafelnikov,
the only seeded player to make the semifinals.
<p>
   Pioline, like Kafelnikov, is a good-all-court player rather than
a power server. He broke the Russian in the eighth game to go into
a 5-3 lead and served for the set.
<p>
   But Kafelnikov won the next four games  &MD;  losing only three
points in the process  &MD;  to take the first set after 38 minutes.
<p>
   In the second set, Kafelnikov took a 5-4 lead after breaking
Pioline and then served out for the victory.
<p>
   ``His record against me had nothing to do with today's result.
He just played too well,'' Pioline said.

jetliner in 1988 that crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. More than 200
people were killed on board and on ground.
<p>
   MENA quoted Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser as saying
that he and Arab League Secretary General Esmet Abdel-Meguid were
coordinating positions for future moves in the Security Council to
seek an end to the diplomatic sanctions and an air embargo.
<p>
   Al-Muntasser did not elaborate, but said he would also meet
officials from the Organization of African Unity, and the Islamic
Organization Conference in attempt to win their support in the
Security Council. MENA gave no other details.
<p>
   On Friday, the World Court ruled that it had jurisdiction to
settle Libya's dispute with the United States and Britain on where
the trial of the two suspects should be held.
<p>
   The two countries want the trial in either the United States or
Britain. Libya says the suspects will not receive a fair trial
there and has offered to hand the suspects over to a neutral
country or to the World court.

Report: Netanyahu to appoint northern commander head of Mossad
Eds: ADDS that former Mossad agent argues statements obtained
illegally
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly
plans to appoint Israel's northern army commander as head of the
Mossad spy agency, which has had its vaunted image tainted by
several botched operations.
<p>
   Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine is Netanyahu's top choice to replace
outgoing Mossad chief Danny Yatom, who resigned over the failed
attempt to assassinate an Islamic militant in Jordan last
September, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Sunday.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation came the day before news broke that Mossad
agents had been caught trying to install a wiretap in Switzerland.
Reports said the target of the wiretap was a member of the Lebanese
guerrilla group Hezbollah.
<p>
   The incident followed the botched assassination attempt in
Jordan on Hamas political leader Khalid Mashaal, and the indictment
of a retired Mossad agent, Yehuda Gil, for fabricating reports that
Syria was preparing for war.
<p>
   Yatom's resignation paved the way for Netanyahu to try and patch
up relations with Jordan's King Hussein, who was deeply embarrassed
by the Mossad attack on Mashaal, a Jordanian passport-holder.
<p>
   Hussein has said he would only resume security cooperation with
Israel if Yatom stepped down.
<p>
   Levine, 52, would reportedly take the Mossad post if it was
offered, news reports said.
<p>
   Also Sunday, Gil argued in a Tel Aviv court hearing that the
statements he made to police were obtained illegally and should be
inadmissable at his trial.
<p>
   Gill said he was tricked into making statements by interrogators
who told him it was an internal Mossad investigation, and later by
interrogators who threatened to handcuff him and drive him around
his hometown if he did not cooperate, Israel's Army Radio said.
<p>
   The court rejected his argument.

<p>
   LYON, France (AP)  &MD;  Jean Balland, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of Lyon, died Sunday, just two months after he was named a cardinal
by Pope John Paul II, the Lyonnais archdiocese said. He was 63.
<p>
   Balland had been suffering from lung cancer and was briefly
hospitalized last November, the archdiocese said in a statement.
<p>
   Balland was named a cardinal Jan. 18, and had just returned from
the ceremony in Rome last Tuesday night when he complained of
feeling sick and was hospitalized and placed on a respirator.
<p>
   He died at 4 a.m. Sunday.
<p>
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, archbishop of Paris, called
Balland ``a man of great heart and great intelligence.''
<p>
   ``He was certainly one of the most remarkable bishops, one of
the most eminent of our time,'' Lustiger told radio France Info.
<p>
   Born July 26, 1934, Balland was the fifth child in a family of
wine makers.
<p>
   He was ordained a priest in 1961, worked as a seminary professor
and served as bishop of Dijon from 1982 to 1988, and then as
archbishop of Reims before coming to Lyon.
<p>
   Balland had been the archbishop of Lyon  &MD;  France's second
largest city  &MD;  since 1995.
<p>
   France, with a mostly Roman Catholic population, now has only
four cardinals. Balland's death reduced to 120 the number of
cardinals under age 80 and thus eligible to vote for the next pope.
<p>
   The archdiocese said Balland's funeral would take place Thursday
afternoon at the Saint-Jean Cathedral in Lyon.

<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  Back when Communists condemned their
music, Led Zeppelin received lots of letters from Romania, begging
for a sign they weren't forgotten. Nine years later, they've come
to answer their fans.
<p>
   ``The letters were asking us for a contribution,'' said ex-Led
Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant on Sunday. Fans were desperate for
them to do anything  &MD;  bring records or play concerts &MD;  to show they
hadn't been forgotten behind the Iron Curtain.
<p>
   ``This is the opportunity to use what little power we've still
got and we wanted to bring it to this area,'' said Plant.
<p>
   Adored by rock fans for a quarter-century, the band will play
hits such as ``Stairway to Heaven'' and ``Whole Lotta Love,'' when
they hit the stage in Romania in front of 6,000 fans Sunday night.
Led Zeppelin has started its world tour &MD;  the second since Jimmy
Page and Plant reunited in 1995 &MD;  in eastern Europe.
<p>
   Tickets sold for 100,000 lei to 150,000 (dlrs 12.5 to 19),
expensive in a country where the average monthly salary barely
equals dlrs 100. But for Romanians who had waited years to hear the
band play live, cost was hardly a question.
<p>
   ``It is a unique occasion that every true rock fan longs for,
the opportunity of seeing one of the old time rock giants,'' said
Lucian Beca, 27, an advertising executive on his way to the
concert.
<p>
   Although Romanians now can freely buy and play what was
considered decadent Western rock music by late communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, poverty means the vast majority of tapes and CDs
are pirated.
<p>
   The band, which with 68.8 million records sold is one of the
best-selling groups of all time, broke up in 1980 with the death of
drummer John Bonham. They will continue their tour in Sofia,
Bulgaria.

HANOVER, Germany: Christian Democratic Union.

<TEXT>
<p>
   The results, a stinging defeat for Kohl, looked strong enough to
propel the telegenic governor into September's race against the
long-serving conservative chancellor.
<p>
   The Social Democrats have tied the announcement of their
candidate Monday directly to the Lower Saxony election, sparking
speculation that Schroeder is the man. He scored his party's best
result in his home state, though it was not immediately clear
whether the Social Democrats would retain their absolute majority
in the parliament.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   His biggest appeal, however, may be that he presents a new face
to voters ready for change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote in Hanover. ``It's always
that way when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   At the polls, Lower Saxons seemed to realize that a vote for
Schroeder on Sunday is really a vote to send him into the
chancellor's race  &MD;  and away from the direct interests of the
state.
<p>
   ``I voted for the SPD so he'll become a chancellor candidate,''
said student Jakob Krovoza, 22.

Hamas militants go on trial in Israel
Eds: UPDATES with extention of detention in graf 8
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was brought before judges.
<p>
   Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
<p>
   Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Three other members of the cell were indicted on charges which
included planting three home-made bombs in a Tel Aviv street in
January 1997, injuring 13 people.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court sentenced a member of another Hamas cell
to 20 months in jail plus 6 months probation. Khaled Muhammed
Bakirat, a resident of east Jerusalem, belonged to a cell accused
of conspiring to plant a bomb in the city's busiest shopping mall
and to kidnap Israeli soldiers and public figures such as Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.
<p>
   Bakirat was a minor figure in the cell, the military prosecutor
said, and pleaded guilty to less serious charges, including
membership in an illegal organization.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court extended by ten days the detention of
Mohammed Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in
Jerusalem accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
<p>
   Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
<p>
   According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

Buraas leads by reputation this time
With Sports-Skiing-World Cup
By MIKE CLARK
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   YONG PYONG, South Korea (AP)  &MD;  For a guy cited by his teammates
as their driving force, Hans-Petter Buraas sure didn't look like a
champion in South Korea.
<p>
   The guy with the red hair who shocked the world with a decisive
victory in the Olympic slalom last month lasted only three gates  &MD; 
that's about three seconds  &MD;  in Sunday's slalom.
<p>
   Yet his absence was hardly noted by a Norwegian team that still
managed to sweep the top three places in the second of two World
Cup races that marked South Korea's debut on the international ski
circuit.
<p>
   Ole Kristian Furuseth, second behind Buraas in the Olympic
slalom, won the race by .54 seconds over Finn Christian Jagge, with
Tom Stiansen taking third.
<p>
   ``You know, you win some and some you lose,'' Buraas said a bit
sheepishly after his brief slalom outing. ``I won the best one of
the season.
<p>
   ``I thought it was very icy and my edges were very sharp. My
skis didn't react the way I wanted and then it was over so fast.''
<p>
   Even with a less than memorable outing, Buraas said he was glad
to have come to South Korea after the Olympics in Japan.
<p>
   ``It gave me time to take control of what happened in Nagano, my
gold medal, before returning to Norway,'' Buraas said. ``I love it
when people come and say hello and good luck for the race. I just
want to stay a nice guy with my feet firmly on the ground.''
<p>
   Sunday's race was one of the few bobbles this season for Buraas,
22, who finished sixth or better in six of the previous seven
races. It was that Buraas who charged up his veteran teammates.
<p>
   ``We have a very good environment in our team,'' Stiansen said.
``We are all good friends. We are lifting each other on the way up,
but maybe we lifted Buraas a bit too far!''
<p>
   ``We all help each other in the team. I help Buraas and he helps
me,'' said Furuseth, who won with a combined time of 1 minute,
39.15 seconds.
<p>
   Jagge, the 1992 Olympic slalom champion, reasoned that if Buraas
could win, so could he because ``I've been here longer than
Hans-Petter.'' Jagge came close, finishing in 1:39.82 to snap a
string of indifferent performances since starting the season with a
second and a first.
<p>
   ``I lost my form a little this winter but it feels good to be on
the top again,'' Jagge said. ``I got my confidence back in Asia. It
was an easy hill but the conditions were difficult. We all
underestimated the conditions and so many made mistakes. We
Norwegians did a good job.
<p>
   ``It is so important to me to have a good result. You know, to
sit on the plane for 12 hours with two good results (seventh in the
Olympics, second in South Korea) is better than with two bad
results.''
<p>
   The way he skis in Asia, Furuseth may be tempted to wave goodbye
to his teammates and remain in the Far East. Three of his eight
victories in a 12-year career have come in Asia and he also has
four other top-three finishes in Japan.
<p>
   ``I'm happy to be going in the history books'' as Korea's first
World Cup slalom winner, Furuseth said. ``I feel so great, relaxed,
but very happy to go home after the Olympics. It's been a long
time.''

<p>
   If Schroeder moves to the national arena, polls indicate he has
a far stronger chance to beat Kohl on Sept. 27 that the Social
Democratic Party leader Oskar Lafontaine  &MD;  who suffered a bruising
defeat to Kohl in the chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the chancellor's
race, Kohl had been campaigning heavily for Schroeder's rival,
Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian Wulff.
<p>
   Unemployment is this year's main election issue. And the Lower
Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid while
promoting flexible working hours, deregulation and innovation has
served him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy
industry and at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   Sunday's vote was the first major test of Social Democrat's
strength in the election year. Lower Saxony's 5.9 million voters
will elect a 155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state
premier, or governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute
majority in the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   Schroeder had declared he would not accept his party's
nomination for the chancellor's race unless Sunday's voting results
gave his party at least 42.3 percent  &MD;  just two percentage points
less than it won in the last election in 1994. Early returns put
the Social Democrats safely above that target.
<p>
   The governor's assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   But critics, such as Wulff, note that Schroeder has offered few
detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.

Palestinians deny involvement in Dead Sea arms smuggling
Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian police uncovering Gaza weapons cache
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Countering Israeli accusations, Palestinian
officials on Sunday denied any involvement in an attempt to smuggle
two boatloads of weapons from Jordan across the Dead Sea.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Palestinian police in Gaza uncovered a cache of
weapons, but said they did not know if they were being stockpiled
for terrorist purposes.
<p>
   A Palestinian police spokesman, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said Sunday that four people who were working in a
small factory producing pistols had been arrested. Police seized
about 45 pistols and submachine guns, the spokesman said, and were
still investigating.
<p>
   In the Dead Sea smuggling incident, the Israeli military late
Friday intercepted two boatloads of weapons and arms being smuggled
from Jordan. Authorities were reportedly investigating the
possibility that the contraband was intended for Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
<p>
   Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, told the
Cabinet on Sunday that the weapons were intended for ``elements''
in the Palestinian Authority, Israeli radio reports said.
<p>
   However, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian Cabinet secretary,
called the smuggling bid ``a criminal act'' and suggested that
whoever was responsible probably had Israeli accomplices.
<p>
   ``Such a large-scale smuggling operation is not the work of one
individual, but organized gangs that are usually bi-national, Arab
and Israeli,'' he said.
<p>
   Another Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Israeli government of blaming the
Palestinian Authority as an excuse to not implement the peace
accords.
<p>
   Nine Jordanians were convicted in a military court in Jordan
last Tuesday in an earlier case of smuggling arms by boat through
the Dead Sea to the West Bank.
<p>
   No information was immediately available on who was receiving
the weapons, or whether there was any connection to this weekend's
interception.

England last pair three runs away from avoiding follow on
By CRAIG COZIER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GEORGETOWN, GUYANA (AP)  &MD;  England was three runs away from
avoiding the follow on with their last pair at the wicket at lunch
on the third day of the fourth Cable &AMP; Wireless cricket Test
against the West Indies at Bourda here Sunday.
<p>
   The tourists, resuming at 87 for six in reply to the West
Indies' 352, reached 150 for nine at the break.
<p>
   Their resistance was led by Mark Ramprakash, whose confident,
unbeaten 48 was his highest score in 12 Tests against these
opponents.
<p>
   Ramprakash and overnight partner Robert Croft batted with little
alarms for the first hour and a half in the morning session. The
pair extended their innings-high partnership to 64 before
off-spinner Carl Hooper ignited a swift collapse with the wicket of
Croft.
<p>
   Croft, who had been badly misstumped by David Williams when 11
with the score 108 for six, eventually edged a cut to first slip.
The Glamorgan batsman made 26 off 91 balls with three fours and
batted just short of two hours.
<p>
   Four balls later, Dean Headley also got an outside edge to
Hooper, this time wicket-keeper David Williams sezing the
opportunity.
<p>
   Leg-spinner Dinanath Ramnarine, in his debut match, made the
score 140 for nine when Angus Fraser top-edged a sweep, Lara
running to the leg-side from slip to pouch the catch. Fraser's was
the fourth ``duck'' of the innings and provided Ramnarine with his
third wicket.
<p>
   But the West Indies could not put the finishing touches on the
innings before the break.
<p>
   Ramprakash, whose father is from Guyana, farmed the strike from
last man Phil Tufnell and the pair added 10 runs before the break.
<p>
   The 28-year-old Ramprakash batted just short of three hours,
facing 135 balls and stroking five boudaries. Middlesex teammate
Tufnell is unbeaten on one.
<p>
   West Indies captain Lara surprisingly chose not to bowl his fast
bowling ace Curtly Ambrose in the entire morning session.
<p>
   Ramnarine's three for 25 off 16 overs is the best West Indian
effort. Hooper has two for 19 off 11 overs and Courtney Walsh two
for 40 off 23 overs.

<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a state vote with nationwide
consequences, Lower Saxony governor Gerhard Schroeder looked headed
for a sweeping reelection Sunday  &MD;  and, in the process, for a shot
at ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years in power.
<p>
   Estimates based on partial returns gave Schroeder's Social
Democratic party more than 47 percent of the vote, compared to
about 37 percent for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   The results, a stinging defeat for Kohl, looked strong enough to
propel the telegenic governor into September's race against the
conservative chancellor, Europe's longest-serving leader. The
governor had declared Sunday's race as a referendum on his chances
on the national stage.
<p>
   The Social Democrats have tied the announcement of their
candidate on Monday directly to the Lower Saxony election, sparking
speculation that Schroeder is the man. The party won its best
returns ever, according to the estimates, though it was not
immediately clear whether the Social Democrats would retain their
absolute majority in the state parliament.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   His biggest appeal, however, may be that he presents a new face
to voters ready for change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote in Hanover. ``It's always
that way when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   At the polls, Lower Saxons seemed to realize that a vote for
Schroeder on Sunday is really a vote to send him into the
chancellor's race  &MD;  and away from the direct interests of the
state.
<p>
   ``I voted for the SPD so he'll become a chancellor candidate,''
said student Jakob Krovoza, 22. ``He stands for economic
competence.''
<p>
   Unemployment is this year's main election issue. And the Lower
Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid while
promoting flexible working hours, deregulation and innovation has
served him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy
industry and at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   In the national arena, polls indicate Schroeder has a far
stronger chance to beat Kohl on Sept. 27 that the Social Democratic

German tourist, 3 policemen wounded in Yemen bus attack
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN`A, Yemen (AP)  &MD;  A gang of armed tribesmen fired machine guns
at a tourist bus Sunday, wounding at least one German tourist and
three policemen escorting the bus, the interior ministry said.
<p>
   The attackers tried to hold up the bus on the country's main
highway, apparently in an attempt to take the tourists hostages,
but an escorting police force returned fire and foiled their
attempt, the ministry said in a statement.
<p>
   The exchange of gunfire injured the German, who was not
identified, and three policemen, said the statement. It said six
attackers were captured. It gave no other details.
<p>
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, however,
said that a large number of tribesmen and policemen were seriously
wounded. This could not be officially confirmed.
<p>
   The bus was carrying about 30 tourists, mostly Germans, to the
ancient town of Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of
Yemen's capital's San`a.
<p>
   Large swaths of Yemen are virtually lawless and ruled by armed
tribesmen who frequently kidnap foreigners as a way of expressing
their grievances against lack of government services in their
provinces.
<p>
   But the hostages are rarely harmed and often treated as guests.
<p>
   The government announced late last year that it was stepping up
security for tourists, but the kidnappings have continued.

Kohl in the chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   Kohl, in a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the
chancellor's race, had been campaigning heavily in Lower Saxony for
Schroeder's rival, Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian
Wulff.
<p>
   Sunday's vote was the first major test of Social Democrat's
strength in the election year. Lower Saxony's 5.9 million voters
elected a 155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state
premier, or governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute
majority in the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   Schroeder had declared he would not accept his party's
nomination for the chancellor's race unless Sunday's voting results
gave his party at least 42.3 percent  &MD;  just two percentage points
less than it won in the last election in 1994.
<p>
   Early returns put the Social Democrats safely above that target.
The party won its best returns ever, according to early returns,
though it was not immediately clear whether the Social Democrats
would retain their absolute majority in the state parliament.
<p>
   The governor's assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   But critics, such as Wulff, note that Schroeder has offered few
detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.

Report: U.N. human rights chief prevented from meeting Khatami
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  A meeting between the U.N. human rights
chief and President Mohammad Khatami was canceled after officials
learned she planned to discuss Iran's poor human rights record, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
<p>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, was
scheduled to meet Khatami, but the meeting was canceled after her
spokesman spelled out in a BBC radio interview Saturday what she
wanted to discuss, the Farda daily said.
<p>
   It did not say when Robinson, who arrived in Tehran Saturday,
was scheduled to meet with Khatami.
<p>
   Asked about the newspaper report later Sunday, Robinson skirted
the question.
<p>
   ``I have an interest in having a direct opportunity to meet with
him and discuss various issues,'' she told reporters
<p>
   ``I am very hopeful that I can meet the president because I have
heard from very many sources of the important role he has played,''
she said.
<p>
   Farda quoted Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Javad
Zarif, as saying there would be no meeting with Khatami, a moderate
cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's foreign and domestic
policies since he took over in August after an overwhelming May
victory.
<p>
   Zarif said Robinson was in Tehran for the sole purpose of
attending a U.N. seminar on human rights, and not to discuss
allegations against Iran.
<p>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday quoted
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a meeting with
Robinson that Western charges of human rights violations in Iran
were politically motivated and untrue.
<p>
   International human rights organizations accuse Iran of
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture, harsh prison
conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and
restrictions on basic freedoms.
<p>
   Iran denies the accusations, saying its Islamic laws and
punishments should not be judged by Western standards.

Tottenham wins 1-0 in relegation battle with Bolton
By STEPHEN WADE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Tottenham stopped its slide to relegation, but at
the top of the league nobody can stop Manchester United.
<p>
   Tottenham, on a goal at home by Allan Nielsen in first-half
injury time Sunday, defeated fellow struggler Bolton 1-0 to move
five points clear of the final three clubs in danger of being
dropped to the first division.
<p>
   Spurs joined Everton with 30 points, leaving three clubs in
danger in the Premier League: Barnsley (25), Bolton (24) and
Crystal Palace (23).
<p>
   Two first-division clubs almost certain to be promoted  &MD; 
Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest  &MD;  met Sunday and Forest won 4-0
on two goals by Pierre Van Hooydonk. He has 28 this season.
<p>
   Both clubs have 68 points although Middlesbrough leads on goal
difference.
<p>
   At the top of the Premier League, Phil Neville scored for
Manchester United in the 31st minute to give league-leaders a 1-0
win Saturday at Chelsea and a nearly insurmountable lead.
<p>
   The game  &MD;  a tuneup for both sides for European play next week  &MD; 
was the third at the Chelsea helm for new player-manager Gianluca
Vialli. It was the Italian's second straight loss after beating
Arsenal in his debut to reach the League Cup final.
<p>
   Blackburn moved into second place with 48 points  &MD;  11 behind
Manchester United  &MD;  with a 5-3 win over Leicester as Chris Sutton
scored a hat trick.
<p>
   Liverpool again stumbled with a 2-1 away loss at Aston Villa as
John Gregory won in his first game as Villa's new manager and Stan
Collymore scored twice  &MD;  his first goal since Dec. 26.
<p>
   The match was the first for Liverpool's American goalkeeper Brad
Friedel, who has been on the bench since joining the club in
December.
<p>
   Manchester United's victory gave it 59 points with 10 games to
play. Blackburn has 48 followed Liverpool and Arsenal with 47 and
Chelsea and Derby with 45. Arsenal was to play Monday against West
Ham.
<p>
   Derby used the 14th and 15th goals of the season by Costa Rican
Paulo Wanchope to beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-0.
<p>
   At the bottom, Barnsley moved out of last place in the 20-team
league for the first time since Dec. 8 with a 2-1 home win over
Wimbledon.
<p>
   In other Premier games Saturday: Crystal Palace 0, Coventry 3;
Everton 0, Newcastle 0; Leeds 0, Southampton 1.
<p>
   In Scotland, Celtic took a big step toward ending Rangers'
nine-season hold on the Premier Division title with a 1-0 win at
Hibernian. Rangers drew 2-2 with Hearts. Celtic moved alone atop
the division with 58 points to 56 for Hearts and 54 for Rangers.

   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Tottenham stopped its slide to relegation, but at
the top of the league nobody can stop Manchester United.
<p>
   Tottenham, on a goal at home by Allan Nielsen in first-half
injury time Sunday, defeated fellow struggler Bolton 1-0 to move
five points clear of the final three clubs in danger of being
dropped to the first division.
<p>
   Spurs joined Everton with 30 points, leaving three clubs in
danger in the Premier League: Barnsley (25), Bolton (24) and
Crystal Palace (23).
<p>
   Two first-division clubs almost certain to be promoted  &MD; 
Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest  &MD;  met Sunday and Forest won 4-0
on two goals by Pierre Van Hooydonk. He has 28 this season.
<p>
   Both clubs have 68 points although Forest leads on goal
difference.

   At the top of the Premier League, Phil Neville scored for
Manchester United in the 31st minute to give league-leaders a 1-0

   Manchester United's victory gave it 59 points with 10 games to

Chelsea and Derby with 45. Arsenal was to play Monday against West
Ham.
<p>
   Derby used the 14th and 15th goals of the season by Costa Rican
Paulo Wanchope to beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-0.

Minister refers banned books controversy to prosecutor
By DIANA ELIAS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  Kuwait's information minister on Sunday asked
prosecutors to investigate whether any laws were broken when he
allowed publications insulting God and Islam to be sold at a book
fair.
<p>
   The decision appears aimed at diminishing the support for three
Muslim fundamentalist lawmakers who are scheduled to question the
minister in parliament on March 10 on the issue.
<p>
   The Kuwait News Agency said the minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah,
wants to give ``the judicial branch its right to investigate'' the
issue and decide whether any laws have been broken.
<p>
   The minister referred the ``issue ... in its entirety'' to the
prosecutor without asking that any specific officials be
investigated, according to KUNA.
<p>
   Deputies at the 50-seat National Assembly said grilling of the
minister would go ahead as planned despite the latest development.
However, some believe that sending the issue to the prosecutor
could sway a number of undecided deputies to the minister's side.
<p>
   If the three fundamentalist deputies are not satisfied with
Sheik Saud's answers during the questioning, they could call for
his impeachment. It is unlikely, however, that they could muster
enough votes to impeach him from office because a pro-government
bloc controls the majority in the house.
<p>
   Deputies Mohammad al-Aleim, Walid Tabtabai and Fahd al-Khanna,
accuse the minister  &MD;  a former ambassador to Washington and a
member of the ruling family  &MD;  of permitting books that insult God
and Islam to be sold at an Arab book fair late last year.
<p>
   A house committee that investigated the incident found Sheik
Saud ``politically responsible.''
<p>
   The minister apologized and promised not to make the same
mistake again, but the lawmakers said the apology still does not
``absolve him of responsibility.''
<p>
   Independent deputy Mishari al-Usaimi told The Associated Press
the minister was trying ``to absorb the anger (among deputies) and
stop the matter from escalating.''
<p>
   Sixteen fundamentalists have seats in Parliament, which is the
only elected legislature in Arab Gulf countries. Influence of
extremists has grown considerably since the 1991 Gulf War that
liberated Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.
<p>
   Ahmed al-Baghdadi, who heads the political science department at
Kuwait University, believes Sheik Saud might be trying to ``break
up the ranks'' of the deputies who may not support him.
<p>
   ``On the day of the grilling some will say let us wait (for the
prosecutor's investigation) and some will say let us go ahead,'' he
told the AP.

Eight killed after Algerian president's anti-insurgency speech
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP)  &MD;  Eight people were killed overnight
outside an Algerian town where the president, only hours before,
vowed to ``eradicate'' the country's bloody insurgency, security
forces said Sunday.
<p>
   In a rare government admission of violence, security forces said
in a statement that the victims were ``killed in a cowardly way''
in Ouled Salem, near the town of Medea, where President Liamine
Zeroual spoke on Saturday.
<p>
   ``Killed in a cowardly way'' is usually how the government
describes massacres in which the victims' throats are slit. The
statement provided no other details.
<p>
   In his first trip as president to Medea  &MD;  one of the regions
most afflicted by insurgent violence  &MD;  Zeroual said ``the
destruction and loss of human life cannot undermine our
determination to eradicate this blight that is foreign to our
society and our religion.''
<p>
   The Medea area, about 100 kms (60 miles) south of Algiers, is
one corner of the so-called ``Triangle of Death,'' where thousands
have been killed by attackers wielding knives, swords, axes and
guns. No Algerian president has visited Medea since the insurgency
began six years ago.
<p>
   The violence is usually attributed to Islamic militants, whose
attacks on civilians and government targets are aimed at
destabilizing the military-backed regime and in turn creating a
state based on Muslim law. Some observers, though, say the
government could be at least passively to blame for the bloodshed.
<p>
   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the insurgency
began in 1992 after the army canceled legislative elections that
Islamic fundamentalist parties were poised to win.

<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a state vote with nationwide
consequences, Lower Saxony governor Gerhard Schroeder won a
sweeping reelection Sunday  &MD;  and, in the process, a shot at ousting
Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years in power.
<p>
   Estimates based on partial returns gave Schroeder's Social
Democratic party more than 48 percent of the vote, compared to
about 37 percent for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   The results, a stinging defeat for Kohl, mean the telegenic
governor will be the party's nominee in September's race against
the conservative chancellor, Europe's longest-serving leader.
<p>
   ``Tomorrow, Gehrard Schroeder will become the Social Democrat's
chancellor candidate,'' said party manager Franz Muntefering. ``The
Kohl era is over.''
<p>
   Counting on Schroeder's success, the Social Democrats have tied
the announcement Monday of their candidate directly to the Lower
Saxony election.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: UPDATES with U.S. Embassy expressing concern, stopping short
of strong criticism of Serbian authorities.
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in the troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Albanians' leader appealed to the West to stop police violence a
day after clashes left at least seven people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority,
which seeks secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States
and European Union to get Belgrade to halt police violence.
''Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent Serb attacks aimed at
``intimidating and causing panic'' among Albanians, he said.
<p>
   The United States later expressed deep concern and appealed for
general restraint, but stopped short of strongly criticizing the
Serbian authorities, according to a statement faxed to The
Associated Press from the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
<p>
   Leading ethnic Albanian politician Fehmi Agani visited the site
of Saturday's clashes and reported large numbers of Serbian police
gathering for what he termed a ``big operation,'' creating an
``atmosphere of war.''
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of worse violence in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
population are ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is prized by every Serb as
the heartland of Serbia's medieval empire and home of treasured
cultural monuments.
<p>
   Two Serb policemen were killed and two wounded on Saturday when
ambushed on patrol near Glogovac, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of
Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
<p>
   In a subsequent action, Serbian police said they killed five
Albanian ``terrorists.''
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army surfaced in 1996. The clandestine,
ethnic Albanian militant group has claimed several terrorist
attacks that have killed more than 30 people.
<p>
   The troubled region west of Pristina is reportedly under KLA
control.
<p>
   Serbian police used armored vehicles and helicopters to sweep
through the area Sunday. Gunfire and explosions could still be
heard there Sunday morning, ethnic Albanian sources said. Some
sources said police were going house-to-house after sealing the
area.
<p>
   Both the Serbs and Albanians claimed a higher death toll from
Saturday's clashes.
<p>
   Sources close to Rugova said police killed at least seven more
ethnic Albanians. Belgrade's state-run Politika daily said a total
of four Serb policemen were killed and three wounded. The reports
could not be independently confirmed.
<p>
   State-run radio said Sunday the two wounded policemen were
recovering after operations for multiple bullet wounds.
<p>
   Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.
<p>
   The Belgrade branch of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
appealed Sunday for international action to halt violence.

AEK beats Panathinaikos, gets back in the race for title
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  A first half goal by Christos Maladenis
was all AEK Athens needed Sunday to beat crosstown Panathinaikos
1-0.
<p>
   The win, put AEK back in the race for the title.
<p>
   After 24 rounds, Panathinaikos has 58 points. Olympiakos Piraeus
also has 58 points but from 23 games.
<p>
   The Piraeus club plays against Proodeftiki away Monday. A win
over Proodeftiki will put Olympiakos in sole possession of first
place.
<p>
   AEK, which last week was five points behind the league-leaders,
narrowed the difference to only two. It has 56 points from 24
games.
<p>
   Playing before 35,000 spectators at the Athens Olympic stadium,
the two teams measured each other at midfield for the first 10
minutes.
<p>
   Four minutes later, AEK's Brazilian striker Marcelo gave a
precise pass to Maladenis who dribbled past goalie Andonis
Nikopolidis to mark the game's only goal.
<p>
   Panathinaikos went on the attack after the goal, but three
spectacular saves by goaltender Ilias Atmatzidis stopped the hosts
from equalizing.
<p>
   Maladenis came close to another goal in the 50th minute, but
Nikopolidis stopped his low shot with an outstretched leg.
<p>
   AEK's star striker Demis Nikolaidis missed another scoring
opportunity when his shot from close range went just wide in the
54th.
<p>
   In the last 10 minutes Panathinaikos sieged AEK's area, but the
visitors' defense resisted well.

BC-Italy-Base Protest
After cable car tragedy, Communists rally against U.S. bases Italy
With AP Photos
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AVIANO, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Demanding the closure of U.S. bases in
Italy, a Communist leader led a protest Sunday outside the American
base which is home to the Marine jet that caused a ski gondola to
crash last month, killing 20 people.
<p>
   ``We're here to demand the closure of all American bases in
Italy, starting with Aviano,'' said Fausto Bertinotti, head of
Communist Refoundation, a small party which is an ally of Premier
Romano Prodi's center-left government.
<p>
   He denounced the U.S. bases as a risk for Italy ``because they
expose it to possible involvement in the military adventures of
another country.''
<p>
   During the crisis over Iraq, Bertinotti had threatened to
withhold support for Prodi if any U.S. bases in Italy were used for
an attack. The Communists are outside the coalition but give Prodi
the majority he needs in lower Chamber of Deputies.
<p>
   The protesters -- about 2,000 according to Aviano police --
marched for about five kilometers (3 miles) along a route that took
them past the base and ended in Aviano town square where Bertinotti
spoke. Many in the crowd were members of leftist youth groups from
northeast Italy, where Aviano is located.
<p>
   No arrests were made in the mainly peaceful protest, police
said. At one point, demonstrators grabbed a NATO flag from a gas
station along the route, ripped it up and set the pieces afire,
said a Carabinieri police commander who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
<p>
   Bertinotti alluded to the Feb. 3 accident in which the American
jet, on a training mission from Aviano, flew low over an Italian
Alpine resort, severing a cable car line and sending the gondola
smashing into the slopes.
<p>
   American military authorities and Italian civilian and military
officials are investigating the accident.
<p>
   ``We are in a condition of limited sovereignty, and from here,
every day, aircraft that bring death can take off,'' Bertinotti
said to a crowd which began dwindling when rain began.
<p>
   Italian media have reported that an Italian air force
investigation blamed pilot error.
<p>
   Earlier in the day, at the U.S. air base at Sigonella, Sicily,
near Catania, about 200 people, organized by Communist
Refoundation, turned out to demand the end of the base, the Italian
news agency ANSA reported.

<p>
   The burned bodies of another woman and a five-year-old child

was extinguished.
<p>
   The cause of their deaths was not yet determined and police have
opened an investigation, ITAR-Tass said.

<p>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Police said Sunday they had no leads
in the killings of two Swedish tourists who were shot in their room
at a coastal resort.
<p>
   The bodies of Anders Fransson, 47, and Jan Anderson, 34, both of
Kalmar, Sweden, were found by a housekeeper on Saturday in their
room at the Bronze Bay resort on the Indian Ocean coast north of
Durban.
<p>
   Their wallets had been emptied and their rental car was missing,
said police Director Bala Naidoo.
<p>
   There was no sign of forced entry. It appeared their killer, or
killers, entered their third-floor room either through their
balcony door or had been allowed inside through the front door,
Naidoo told The Associated Press.
<p>
   The two men apparently had arrived in Cape Town on Feb. 15 from
Sweden and had run in the Cape Town Marathon on Feb. 22. The bronze
medals they had won in the race were found in their room, Naidoo
said.
<p>
   Fransson's body was found in bed with a bullet wound in the
head. Anderson's body, with a bullet wound in the chest, was found
on the floor.
<p>
   Last December, a German tourist was stabbed to death in front of
his two children on New Year's Eve on Durban's beachfront.
<p>
   The killing was one of several highly publicized slayings over
the holiday season, including the shooting deaths of an American
tourist and his South African companion in Cape Town.
<p>
   However, Naidoo said that police believed it was an isolated
incident, and that foreign tourists should not be overly concerned
about their own safety because of the killings.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: UPDATES with US reaction, second Albanian leader's comments,
wounded policemen recovering
By IBRAHIM OSMANI

<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Kosovo Albanians' leader urged the West to stop police violence a
day after clashes that left at least seven people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Albanians who are demanding
secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States and the
European Union to pressure Belgrade to stop violent police actions.
``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent the Serb attacks, which
are aimed at ``intimidating and causing panic'' among the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, he said in a statement.
<p>
   The United States later expressed concern and appealed for
restraint but stopped short of strongly criticizing the Serbian
authorities, according to a statement faxed to The Associated Press
from the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
<p>
   Another prominent Albanian politician, Fehmi Agani, visited the
site of Saturday's clashes and said large numbers of Serbian police
forces appeared to be preparing a ``big operation'' and creating an
``atmosphere of war.''
<p>
   Two Serb policemen were killed and two wounded on Saturday when
their patrol was ambushed near the village of Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of the province's capital, Pristina.
<p>
   In a subsequent action, Serb police said they killed five
Albanian ``terrorists.''
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army began operating in 1996. The clandestine
ethnic Albanian group has claimed responsibility for several
terrorist attacks that have left more than 30 people dead.
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of all-out war in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
residents are ethnic Albanians. Tension has been high in Kosovo
since Serbia revoked the province's autonomy and introduced virtual
martial law in 1989, deploying heavy police and army
reinforcements.
<p>
   Both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources claim the death toll from
Saturday's clashes may be much higher, after Serb police used
helicopters and armored vehicles to sweep through ethnic Albanian
villages in the areas surrounding Glogovac.
<p>
   Sources close to Rugova claim that at least seven additional
ethnic Albanians were killed in the police operation. Belgrade
state-run Politika daily said that altogether four Serb policemen
were killed and three were wounded in Saturday's clashes. The
reports could not be independently confirmed, but state-run radio
said Sunday that two policemen were recovering after undergoing
operations.

<p>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Novelist Elena Garro, former wife of
Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, was doing well at her home Sunday after
being released from hospital for heart and lung failure, her
daughter said.
<p>
   Elena Paz told reporters her mother still has to use bottled
oxygen to breathe but was otherwise suffering no complications.
Garro returned Saturday evening to her home in this capital of
Morelos state, 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
<p>
   Garro, 81, a novelist in her own right, spent almost two weeks
in intensive care at a hospital here when her chronic asthma took a
turn for the worse and she started experiencing heart failure.
<p>
   Garro was awarded Mexico's prestigious Xavier Viallaurrutia
prize for literature. Her most acclaimed novels to date were
``Recuerdos del Porvenir'' (Remembrances of the Future) and
``Andamos huyendo a Lola'' (We're fleeing Lola).

Justice catches up with two of Spain's richest, most powerful men
By JOHANNA TUCKMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Spaniards are reveling in the spectacle of
a former national police chief and a debonair banker whisked off to
serve hefty jail terms for embezzling millions of dollars.
<p>
   ``When I was studying business I wanted to be just like you, and
look! now we've made it together,'' says the police chief to the
banker as they shake hands behind bars in one cartoon from the
Barcelona daily La Vanguardia.
<p>
   The police chief, Luis Roldan, headed Spain's paramilitary Civil
Guard between 1986 and 1993. The banker is Mario Conde, who
personified financial and social success during the same era.
<p>
   After their respective scandals broke several years ago, Roldan
and Conde came to symbolize cynical arrogance within the political
and financial elite that emerged during Spain's transition to
democracy after the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in
1975.
<p>
   But on Thursday, Spanish courts brought them down.
<p>
   Roldan received a 28-year jail sentence from a Madrid court for
abusing his position as head of the Civil Guard to amass a dlrs 14
million personal fortune.
<p>
   Just hours later, the Supreme Court of Justice ordered Mario
Conde to jail for four and a half years for defrauding the Banco
Espanol de Credito, known as Banesto, of over dlrs 4 million.
<p>
   Spaniards who resented the traditional impunity of the rich and
powerful were delighted, and Friday's editorials applauded
``justice being done'' and ``democracy being reaffirmed.''
<p>
   The Roldan affair was one of the scandals that propelled former
Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to electoral defeat in
1996 after a 13 years in office.
<p>
   Roldan, who was close to the Socialists, was tapped as a future
interior minister at the time he resigned from the Civil Guard in
1993, just before newspaper exposes of his hidden Swiss bank
accounts.
<p>
   Roldan further damaged Gonzalez by saying the then prime
minister was fully aware of the dirty war waged from within his
government against the armed Basque separatist group ETA. The
counterinsurgency campaign left 27 people dead.
<p>
   Friday's El Pais editorial also evoked the memory of Mario
Conde, who once hobnobbed with King Juan Carlos and came to
represent dirt on the other side of the political coin from Roldan.
<p>
   Conde, and 10 other former directors and associates of Banesto,
are currently being tried for another misappropriation of dlrs 48
million.

Governor Schroeder wins reelection  &MD;  and chance to challenge Kohl

<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a state vote with nationwide
consequences, Lower Saxony governor Gerhard Schroeder won a
sweeping reelection Sunday  &MD;  and, in the process, a shot at ousting
Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years in power.
<p>
   Estimates based on partial returns gave Schroeder's Social
Democratic party 48.6 percent of the vote, compared to 35.6 percent
for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   The results, a stinging defeat for Kohl, mean the telegenic
governor will be the party's nominee in September's race against
the conservative chancellor, Europe's longest-serving leader. The
Social Democrats have tied the announcement Monday of their
candidate directly to the Lower Saxony election.
<p>
   ``Tomorrow, Gehrard Schroeder will become the Social Democrat's
chancellor candidate,'' said party manager Franz Muntefering. ``The
Kohl era is over.''
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   For Europe, a victory by Schroeder in the chancellor's race
would extend the continent's shift to the left, following Blair's
Labor Party win and the election of socialist French President
Jacques Chirac.
<p>
   Christian Democrats were quick to dismiss the election's
importance on the national stage. ``A huge victory in one state has
no meaning in the federal elections,'' Peter Hintze, the party
leader, said in Bonn.
<p>
   Still, many Lower Saxons saw larger consequences in Sunday's
vote, casting their ballot for Schroeder to send him into the
chancellor's race  &MD;  even though that could take him away from
state.
<p>
   ``I voted for the SPD so he'll become a chancellor candidate,''
said student Jakob Krovoza, 22. ``He stands for economic
competence.''
<p>
   Unemployment is this year's main election issue. And the Lower
Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid while
promoting flexible working hours, deregulation and innovation has
served him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy
industry and at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   But Schoeder's biggest appeal may be that he presents a new face
to Germans ready for a change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote in Hanover. ``It's always
that way when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   Polls indicate Schroeder has a far stronger chance to beat Kohl
on Sept. 27 that the Social Democratic Party leader Oskar
Lafontaine  &MD;  who suffered a bruising defeat to Kohl in the
chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   Lafontaine, setting aside his own ambitions, will personally
recommend Schroeder's nomination tomorrow.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the chancellor's
race, Kohl had been campaigning heavily in Lower Saxony for
Schroeder's rival, Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian
Wulff.
<p>
   The governor's assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   But critics, such as Wulff, note that Schroeder has offered few
detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.
<p>
   Sunday's vote was the first major test of Social Democrat's
strength in the election year. Lower Saxony's 5.9 million voters
elected a 155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state
premier, or governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute
majority in the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   Schroeder had declared he would not accept his party's
nomination for the chancellor's race unless Sunday's voting results
gave his party at least 42.3 percent  &MD;  just two percentage points
less than it won in the last election in 1994.
<p>
   Early returns put the Social Democrats safely above that target.
The party won its best returns ever, according to early returns,
though it was not immediately clear whether the Social Democrats
would retain their absolute majority in the state parliament.
<p>
   Schroeder's likely successor as governor is state Interior
Minister Gerhard Glogowski.

AEK beats Panathinaikos, gets back in the race for title
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  A first half goal by Christos Maladenis
was all AEK Athens needed Sunday to beat crosstown Panathinaikos
1-0.
<p>
   The win put AEK back in the race for the title.
<p>
   After 24 rounds, Panathinaikos is tied for the league lead with
58 points. Olympiakos Piraeus also has 58 points and plays away at
Proodeftiki Monday.
<p>
   AEK is in third with 56 points.
<p>
   AEK and Panathinaikos played mostly at midfield for the first
ten minutes of the game, played before 35,000 spectators at the
Athens Olympic stadium.
<p>
   But four minutes later, AEK's Brazilian striker Marcelo fed a
precise pass to Maladenis, who dribbled past goalie Andonis
Nikopolidis to score the game's only goal.
<p>
   Panathinaikos went on the attack after the goal, but three
spectacular saves by goaltender Ilias Atmatzidis stopped the hosts
from tying the game.
<p>
   Maladenis came close to another goal in the 50th minute, but
Nikopolidis stopped his low shot with an outstretched leg.
<p>
   AEK's star striker Demis Nikolaidis missed another scoring
opportunity when his shot from close range went just wide in the
54th.

Hamas militants go on trial in Israel
Eds: UPDATES with extention of detention for Othman
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was also brought before judges.
<p>
   Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
<p>
   Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
<p>
   Three other members of the cell were indicted on charges that
included planting three homemade bombs in a Tel Aviv street in
January 1997 that injured 13 people.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court sentenced a member of another Hamas cell
to 20 months in jail plus 6 months probation. Khaled Muhammed
Bakirat, a resident of east Jerusalem, belonged to a cell accused
of conspiring to plant a bomb in the city's busiest shopping mall
and to kidnap Israeli soldiers and public figures such as Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.
<p>
   Bakirat was a minor figure in the cell, the military prosecutor
said, and he pleaded guilty to less serious charges, including
membership in an illegal organization.
<p>
   Also Sunday, the court extended by ten days the detention of
Mohammed Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in
Jerusalem accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.

Two Britons said they were beaten while reported missing in Bosnia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Two British journalists who
disappeared while researching a story on misuesed charity funds in
the Croat part of Bosnia said Sunday they were beaten and
threatened at gunpoint before escaping.
<p>
   Mike Grimes, 22, and Jeffrey Pickett, 27, both of Liverpool,
went missing late Saturday in the southern part of Bosnia
predominantly inhabited by Croats. They later showed up south of
Mostar, after walking some 10 kilometers (6 miles) through the
mountains. Doctors reported the two had severely beaten, but both
were released after an examinaton.
<p>
   On Sunday, Pickett told the Associated Press by telephone that
he Grimes were stopped while driving thorugh a village near
Medjugorje 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) southwest of Mostar, where
they were headed to film a hand grenade factory that was
operational during the war. A blue and white car with two men
inside pulled in front of the Brits' vehicle, forcing them to stop.
<p>
   The unknown attackers then pulled both Grimes and Pickett from
their car and confiscated their camera equipment and material. One
man knocked Grimes to the ground and began kicking him, while the
other beat Pickett at gunpoint. The Brits eventually broke free and
ran away.
<p>
   Grimes and Pickett were part of a four-man team working for a
television company called Network 5 International Liverpool
,collecting material for a story investigating the work of a
charity that raised funds in the United States and in Britain for
Bosnian children, but used the money to fund the hand grenade
operation in Medjugorije. The two other team members, an American
and a Brit, stayed behind in eastern Mostar.
<p>
   All four were saftely in eastern Mostar late Sunday.
<p>
   Speaking to the AP, Pickett said the incident proved their hunch
about the misuse of the aid was right.
<p>
   ``It is a fraud and a lot of people profited from a lot of the
aid and we believe that it (the aid) was actually used to fuel the
war,'' he said.

Hospital: Take septuplets home or we will call police

<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  A Saudi hospital has
threatened to call the police if the parents of seven-week old
septuplets don't take their babies home, doctors said Sunday.
<p>
   Four of the seven babies have been issued discharge slips since
last week but their parents say they are not ready to take them
home. Doctors say the hospital nursery is overcrowded and they are
running out of patience.
<p>
   ``I told their parents that if they do not take them home soon,
we will call the police to make sure they do. I have 26 babies in a
nursery that has a capacity for 20,'' said Hind Moussa, a
pediatrician at the Abha Maternity Hospital in the southern Saudi
city of Abha where the babies were born eight weeks premature.
<p>
   The four boys and three girls  &MD;  only the third set of septuplets
known to have been born alive  &MD;  were delivered by Hasna Mohammed
Humair, a 40-year-old housewife, on Jan. 14.
<p>
   Humair says the unplanned pregnancy occurred while she was
taking a fertility drug to regulate her menstrual cycle, and that
she is still not ready for the responsibility of caring for the
babies.
<p>
   Moussa said the three girls and a boy who are now ready to go
home were in good health and growing well. She expects the
remaining three boys to be ready to leave the hospital by next
week.
<p>
   Moussa said she's managed to get local companies to pledge
supplies of free milk and diapers for the babies. She suggested
that Humair take home at least two of the babies to get used to
caring for them.
<p>
   Humair, who shares her two-bedroom home with her husband and six
other children, says she's been constantly fatigued since the
delivery and would prefer to have some help before bringing the
babies home.
<p>
   The hospital turned down her husband's request to send a
qualified person to take care of the babies, Humair said.
<p>
   The father, Abdullah Mohammed Ali, 55, is a retired civil
defense employee who supplements his dlrs 1,066 monthly pension by
driving a cab. Saudi newspapers have reported he has two other
wives and nine children in addition to the septuplets.
<p>
   Islam allows men up to four wives at a time if they can support
them.
<p>
   Another set of septuplets was born in Saudi Arabia in September,
but only one child lived. In November, American Bobbi McCaughey
also gave birth to seven children, all of whom survived.

Palestinians deny involvement in Dead Sea arms smuggling
Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian police uncovering Gaza weapons cache
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Countering Israeli accusations, Palestinian
officials on Sunday denied any involvement in an attempt to smuggle
two boatloads of weapons from Jordan across the Dead Sea.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Palestinian police in Gaza uncovered a cache of
weapons but said they did not know if they were being stockpiled
for terrorist purposes.
<p>
   A Palestinian police spokesman, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said Sunday that four people who were working in a
small factory producing pistols had been arrested. Police seized
about 45 pistols and submachine guns, the spokesman said.
<p>
   In the Dead Sea smuggling incident, the Israeli military on
Friday intercepted two boatloads of weapons and arms being smuggled
from Jordan. Authorities were reportedly investigating the
possibility that the contraband was intended for Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
<p>
   Israel's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, told the
Cabinet on Sunday that the weapons were intended for ``elements''
in the Palestinian Authority, Israeli radio reports said.
<p>
   However, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian Cabinet secretary,
called the smuggling attempt ``a criminal act'' and suggested that
whoever was responsible probably had Israeli accomplices.
<p>
   ``Such a large-scale smuggling operation is not the work of one
individual, but organized gangs that are usually bi-national, Arab
and Israeli,'' he said.
<p>
   Another Palestinian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Israeli government of blaming the
Palestinian Authority as an excuse not to put the Oslo peace
accords into effect.
<p>
   Nine Jordanians were convicted in a military court in Jordan
last Tuesday in an earlier case of arms smuggling across the Dead
Sea to the West Bank.
<p>
   No information was immediately available on who was receiving
the weapons, or whether there was any connection to this weekend's
interception.

Libyan and Arab League officials meet to coordinate on Lockerbie
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Libyan and Arab League officials met here
Sunday to forge a strategy on securing an end to U.N. sanctions on
Libya, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
<p>
   The sanction were imposed in 1992 in a bid to force Libya to
hand over for trial two Libyans suspected of bombing a U.S.
jetliner in 1988 that crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. More than 200
people were killed on board and on ground.
<p>
   MENA quoted Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser as saying
that he and Arab League Secretary General Esmet Abdel-Meguid were
coordinating positions for future moves in the Security Council to
seek an end to the diplomatic sanctions and an air embargo.
<p>
   Al-Muntasser did not elaborate, but said he would also meet
officials from the Organization of African Unity, and the Islamic
Organization Conference in attempt to win their support in the
Security Council. MENA gave no other details.
<p>
   On Friday, the World Court ruled that it had jurisdiction to
settle Libya's dispute with the United States and Britain on where
the trial of the two suspects should be held.
<p>
   The two countries want the trial in either the United States or
Britain. Libya says the suspects will not receive a fair trial
there and has offered to hand the suspects over to a neutral
country or to the World court.

<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  A quarter million rural residents poured into
London on Sunday to voice their fears for the future of the
countryside and protest legislation they say threatens the rural
way of life.
<p>
   From the grouse moors of Scotland and the green valleys of Wales
and England, landowners and laborers, fox hunters and their
opponents brought their diverse grievances to the capital.
<p>
   In a show of strength that filled main roads through the city
center, they marched to complain about a government many see as
unsympathetic and urban dwellers who don't understand their ways.
<p>
   Hunters in red coats, fishermen carrying their rods and reels,
men, women and children carrying banners and accompanied by a brass
band, marched two miles (3.2 km) from the Thames-side Victoria
Embankment through Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. Marchers cheered
and applauded when some hunters blew their horns.
<p>
   Scotland Yard said some 250,000 people participated  &MD;  the
biggest single demonstration in Britain since anti-nuclear marches
in the early 1980s.
<p>
   Michael Meacher, a government spokesman on the environment,
joined the marchers.
<p>
   ``I ... understand that one of the issues that people on this
march today are concerned about is that there should be a center
within government which addresses their interests,'' he told
British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
<p>
   But some marchers didn't believe the government is listening.
``Tony Blair Doesn't Care About Country Life'' proclaimed a placard
attacking the prime minister. ``This earth is for people, not just
New Labour'' said another in the forest of flags and banners waved
by marchers streaming toward Hyde Park.
<p>
   Fox hunting was at the heart of the matter, and a handful of
anti-hunting activists chanted ``fascists!'' at the marchers.
<p>
   A Labor legislator has initiated a bill to ban hunting with
hounds, provoking outrage among thousands of equestrians who gallop
across frozen farmland on winter days in pursuit of the fox.
<p>
   Opponents of hunting say it is barbaric to allow dogs to tear a
fox to death and that no civilized society can tolerate it.
<p>
   Hunters say they provide a vital control of foxes, which are a
farmyard pest, and that people who have no knowledge or
understanding of the hunt have no right to deny them their sport.
<p>
   The march was organized by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance
to protest the legislation, but a huge array of other interests
joined in.
<p>
   Among them were anti-hunting campaigners who have other
conservation issues at heart  &MD;  from saving hedgerows to halting
construction on green fields.
<p>
   Some landowners are unhappy with prospective legislation that
would allow walkers to roam over their acres. Organizations for
``ramblers,'' as the walkers are called, marched in support of such
a law.
<p>
   Through all these issues ran the thread of deep concern about
preservation of the countryside and a sense that the government
represents an urban viewpoint.
<p>
   ``This is about a show of hands,'' said marcher Peter Haydon.
<p>
   ``Of course there has to be moderate change, but the government
is attacking people like farmers,'' said Haydon, who lives in
Hertfordshire, 20 miles (32 km) north of London and works in the
capital as a telecommuncations engineer.
<p>
   Farm worker William Campbell, 28, from Desmartin in northwest
Northern Ireland, said he came with 26 others from the town.
<p>
   ``I want politicians to change their mind about banning fox
hunting and building on green belt areas,'' he said. ``And if the
ramblers get their way, farmers will not even have a right of
access to their own land.''
<p>
   Not all the marchers were country folk.
<p>
   Peter Pender, a retired electrician, said the only countryside
he knew about was the window box at his seventh floor apartment in
Hounslow, west London.
<p>
   But he said he resented the government's decision to ban the
sale of beef on the bone because of concerns that it could transmit
mad cow disease  &MD;  bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
<p>
   ``I think it's an attack on my freedom,'' Pender said.
<p>
   At the Hyde Park end of the march, most demonstrators drifted
away, but some lingered for a picnic lunch in the cold sunshine.
<p>
   ``I hope we've shown at today's march that we can behave
responsibility and good-humoredly, but also that we have shown

a hunter and horseman from the New Forest area of southwest
England.

Political momentum gathers for Israeli pullout from Lebanon

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals
Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a
costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives.
<p>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday
that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided
Israel's northern frontier could be secured.
<p>
   ``If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making
appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be
happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of
U.N. Resolution 425,'' Netanyahu told his ministers.
<p>
   That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal
from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon,
and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to
ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
<p>
   On Friday, Netanyahu said he had ``no qualms'' about
implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had ``the
necessary security safeguards.''
<p>
   Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's
remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position.
<p>
   ``We will defend our north from the international border,'' said
Eitan, the science minister. ``No one wants to stay in Lebanon;
thus we think it better to withdraw.''
<p>
   Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also
suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in
Lebanon.
<p>
   ``This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk
today  &MD;  full stop  &MD;  about security,'' Lubrani told Israel's Channel
One. ``We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of
normalization.''
<p>
   As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government
has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon.
<p>
   Since 1985  &MD;  when the Israelis created a security buffer zone
southern Lebanon  &MD;  nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed
fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah
fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six
others.
<p>
   The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon
last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon
when two military helicopters crashed last February.
<p>
   The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last
week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew
the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years.
<p>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli
official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago,
saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange
for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked.

Governor Schroeder wins reelection  &MD;  and chance to challenge Kohl

<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a state vote with nationwide
consequences, Lower Saxony governor Gerhard Schroeder won a
sweeping reelection Sunday  &MD;  and, in the process, a shot at ousting
Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years in power.
<p>
   Confident in the governor's popularity, the Social Democratic
party said it will nominate the telegenic Schroeder on Monday as
its candidate in September's race against the conservative
chancellor, Europe's longest-serving leader.
<p>
   ``The Kohl era is over,'' Schroeder declared, after partial
returns gave his party more than 48 percent of the vote, compared
to about 36 percent for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   The 53-year-old Schroeder, who said he would accept the
nomination, said Sunday's election ``signals a deep-seeded wish for
change in politics.'' Already campaigning, the governor said he
would fight to end unemployment, a key election issue in a country
where joblessness is at a postwar high of more than 12 percent.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   For Europe, a victory by Schroeder in the chancellor's race
would extend the continent's shift to the left, following Blair's
Labor Party win and the election of socialist French President
Jacques Chirac.
<p>
   Christian Democrats were quick to dismiss the election's
importance. ``A huge victory in one state has no meaning in the
federal elections,'' Peter Hintze, the party leader, said in Bonn.
<p>
   Still, many Lower Saxons saw larger consequences in Sunday's
vote, casting their ballot for Schroeder to send him into the
chancellor's race even though that would take him away from the
state.
<p>
   ``I voted for the SPD so he'll become a chancellor candidate,''
said student Jakob Krovoza, 22. ``He stands for economic
competence.''
<p>
   The Lower Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid
while promoting flexible working hours and deregulation has served
him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy industry and
at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   But Schoeder's biggest appeal may be that he presents a new face
to Germans ready for a change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote in Hanover. ``It's always
that way when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   Polls indicate Schroeder has a far stronger chance to beat Kohl
on Sept. 27 that the Social Democratic Party leader Oskar
Lafontaine  &MD;  who suffered a bruising defeat to Kohl in the
chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   ``Tomorrow, Gehrard Schroeder will become the Social Democrat's
chancellor candidate,'' said party manager Franz Muntefering.
Lafontaine, setting aside his own ambitions, is to recommend
Schroeder personally.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the chancellor's
race, Kohl had campaigned heavily in Lower Saxony for Schroeder's
rival, Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian Wulff.
<p>
   Becoming chancellor has long been Schroeder's dream. In the
early 1990s, he was quoted as saying he wanted to open an annual
trade expo in Hanover as chancellor in the year 2000.
<p>
   Lore has it that as a young parliament member in the '80s,
Schroeder stood outside the chancellory in Bonn after a late night
of drinking and called out, ``I want to be there!''
<p>
   The governor's assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   But critics, such as Wulff, note that Schroeder has offered few
detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.
<p>
   Sunday's vote was the first major test of Social Democrat's
strength in the election year. Lower Saxony's 5.9 million voters
elected a 155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state
premier, or governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute
majority in the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   Schroeder had declared he would not accept his party's
nomination for the chancellor's race unless Sunday's voting results
gave his party at least 42.3 percent  &MD;  just two percentage points
less than it won in the last election in 1994.
<p>
   Early returns put the Social Democrats safely above that target.
The party won its strongest showing ever, though it was not
immediately clear whether the Social Democrats would retain their
absolute majority in the state parliament.
<p>
   Schroeder's likely successor as governor is state Interior
Minister Gerhard Glogowski.

Libyan and Arab League officials meet to coordinate on Lockerbie
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Libyan and Arab League officials met here
Sunday to forge a strategy on persuading the United Nations to lift
sanctions on Libya, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
<p>
   The sanction were imposed in 1992 in a bid to force Libya to
hand over for trial two Libyans suspected of bombing a U.S.
jetliner in 1988 that crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland. More than 200
people were killed on board and on the ground.
<p>
   MENA quoted Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser as saying
that he and Arab League Secretary General Esmet Abdel-Meguid were
coordinating positions for future moves in the Security Council to
seek an end to the diplomatic sanctions and an air embargo.
<p>
   Al-Muntasser did not elaborate but said he would also meet
officials from the Organization of African Unity and the Islamic
Organization Conference to try to win their support. MENA gave no
other details.
<p>
   The World Court ruled Friday that it had jurisdiction to settle
Libya's dispute with the United States and Britain over where the
two suspects' trial should be held.
<p>
   Britain and the United States want the trial to be held in
either of those two countries. Libya argues that the suspects will
not receive a fair trial there and has offered to hand the suspects
over to a neutral country or to the World Court, which is based in
The Hague, Netherlands.

<TEXT>
<p>
   AGNO, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  Vico Torriani, a Swiss singer and
entertainer who enjoyed huge success in 1950s Germany, has died, it
was reported Sunday.
<p>
   Municipal authorities in Agno confirmed a report in the Zurich
weekly SonntagsBlick that Torriani died last week, after a long
illness. The cause of death was unavailable.
<p>
   The newspaper report said Torriani died at home last Wednesday
and was cremated at a private family ceremony in nearby Lugano
Friday.
<p>
   Torriani was born in Switzerland's mountainous Engadine region
in 1920. After becoming a professional singer in 1946 he made radio
appearances all over Europe, especially Germany, and sold over 25
million records.
<p>
   After turning to musicals, Torriani in his later years gained a
reputation for writing cookery books.
<p>
   Torriani is survived by his wife, Evelyne, and their children
Nicole and Reto.

Feyenoord shows fight to down Heerenveen
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) Feyenoord Rotterdam took a step
closer to European soccer next season with an emphatic 2-0 win
Sunday over in-form SC Heerenveen.
<p>
   Feyenoord is now level in fourth with Vitesse Arnhem on 42
points, only two behind Heerenveen but 20 adrift of leader Ajax.
<p>
   Henk Vos leapt to powerfully head home the first goal then
Giovanni van Bronckhorst curled in a free kick via the underside of
the bar and Heerenveen keeper Hans Vonk's shoulder.
<p>
   The 2-0 lead at the half reflected Feyenoord's tactical edge.
<p>
   Heerenveen's best chance to come back came five minutes after
the break when Rene Bot conceded a yellow card and a penalty for
tripping Boudewijn Pahlplatz.
<p>
   But Jan de Visser drove his spot kick too close to Jurek Dudek
and Feyenoord's Polish keeper parried the ball.
<p>
   New Feyenoord signing Bonaventura Kaloo from the Ivory Coast
came on as a substitute to impress on the right wing.
<p>
   Earlier in the afternoon, Archil Arveladze, twin brother of Ajax
striker Shota, netted a brilliant hat trick in NAC Breda's 3-1 win
at FC Utrecht.
<p>
   But then the Georgian spoilt a perfect afternoon. He earned his
second yellow card, for kicking the ball away, and was sent from
the field.
<p>
   Relegation racing certainty FC Volendam ripped up the form book
with a shock 4-1 win over Willem II Tilburg, only the bottom club's
third victory of the season.
<p>
   And two of the three penalties awarded by referee Dick Jol
produced the goals in Sparta Rotterdam's 1-1 draw at FC Groningen.

Supreme court puts temporary halt on eviction of Bedouin clan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday gave a Bedouin
tribe temporary permission to stay on land where it has lived for
40 years  &MD;  but left open the prospect of eviction to make room for
an expanding Jewish settlement.
<p>
   The high court said that pending a ruling by a military
committee, police could not evict the Jahalin tribe from land
outside Maale Adumim, the largest Jewish settlement in the West
Bank, Israeli media reports said.
<p>
   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that the tribe had
settled illegally on the state property and could be evicted to
make way for settlement construction. Since the court ruling,
Israeli police have raided the camp several times, forcing out
several families at a time.
<p>
   The biggest raid came last month, when bulldozers were brought
in to knock down 30 shacks and goat-hair tents while riot police
scuffled with tribal elders and weeping Bedouin women. The clan
stayed on the site after that raid, sleeping in the open air
without shelter.
<p>
   The Jahalin, who number about 2,000 in all, rejected another
site offered by the Israeli government in Abu Dis, a West Bank
village on the outskirts of Jerusalem, because it is near a garbage
dump and its rocky slopes are unsuitable for grazing by the tribe's
livestock.

contemplating,'' Taylor said in a speech broadcast to the country.
``Because we are aware, we are better prepared.''
<p>
   Taylor said his security advisors had informed him that Liberian
dissident groups across the border in Sierra Leone had been
planning to link up with ethnic Kamajor rebels.
<p>
   Taylor, although elected president last year, honed his skills
as a guerrilla fighter during seven years of ruthless civil war in
Liberia.
<p>
   The president gave no specifics about the predicted attack, but
said the rebel groups hoped to take advantage of fighting and
unrest in Sierra Leone and expand the conflict to Liberia.
<p>
   Sierra Leone's military junta, which seized power in May, was
driven from power last month by a West African coalition force.
<p>
   The West Africans control the capital, Freetown, but fighting
continues in the countryside.
<p>
   Nigerian commanders operating under the West African banner last
week said ousted junta soldiers and allied rebel groups were
regrouping near Sierra Leone's border with Liberia.

Sailors sunbathe, relax as Iraq tensions subside
AP Photo BHN102
By LOUIS MEIXLER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ABOARD THE HMS INVINCIBLE (AP)  &MD;  Servicemen in bathing trunks
and servicewomen in tank tops sunbathed on the flight deck of the
HMS Invincible as sailors enjoyed a quiet Sunday amid falling
tensions with Iraq.
<p>
   Below the deck of the British aircraft carrier, bicycles,
electronic games and other toys were tucked in different corners of
the ship: Christmas presents that sailors are still waiting to
deliver to friends and families after some six months at sea.
<p>
   The ship is due back in its home port of Portsmouth later this
month.
<p>
   The aircraft carrier had been scheduled to return to Portsmouth
on Dec. 19, but was instead kept on duty because of mounting
tensions with Iraq. Britain and the United States had threatened
Iraq with air strikes if Baghdad refused to open suspected weapons
sites to U.N. arms inspectors.
<p>
   An agreement between Iraq and the United Nations in late
February seems to have forestalled a use of force.
<p>
   ``There was a definite lightening of the atmosphere aboard,''
said Capt. James Burnell-Nugent, the ship's captain.
<p>
   But he added that the carrier will launch its Harrier jets on
Monday to patrol the no-fly zone in southern Iraq as it has been
doing for weeks. Aircraft from the U.S. carriers George Washington
and Independence also have been patrolling the zone.
<p>
   The U.S. ships carry 50 strike aircraft each, while the smaller
British warship carries only 16 fighters and bombers.
<p>
   ``There is no change,'' Burnell-Nugent said. ``We are still
flying.''
<p>
   Flights from the Invincible will end later this month when a
second British aircraft carrier, the Illustrious, takes over the
patrol duties.
<p>
   With the ship at anchor a few miles (kilometers) off the coast
of Bahrain, many soldiers took advantage of the lull in tensions to
relax aboard the ship.
<p>
   On the flight deck, about a dozen sailors sunbathed and listened
to music.
<p>
   The ship has a crew of about 1,200, including more than 100
women.
<p>
   James Barry, an engineer aboard the ship, said he is skeptical
that the crisis is over, but added that ``obviously everybody is in
high spirits over the prospects of going home.''
<p>
   He said that when he gets home he plans to pull the top off of
his Triumph Spitfire convertible and go for a drive ``whether it's
raining or not.''

Motorists trapped by northern snowstorm
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  About 200 cars have been trapped by a snowstorm in
the Murmansk region of northern Russia, a news agency reported
Sunday.
<p>
   All the reserve snow plows in the region, 1,300 kilometers (810
miles) north of Moscow, were dispatched to the highway leading to
the Russian border with Finland to help the trapped motorists, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
<p>
   The motorists are unable to move because there was no traction
on the highway, which was covered in a deep layer of snow,
ITAR-Tass said.
<p>
   It said weathermen do not expect the heavy snow, which has swept
northern Russia for several days, to let up before Monday. No
casualties were reported, but the situation remains tense, the
local civil defense headquarters told ITAR-Tass.

Supreme court puts temporary halt on eviction of Bedouin clan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday gave a Bedouin
tribe temporary permission to stay on land where it has lived for
40 years  &MD;  but left open the prospect of eviction to make room for
an expanding Jewish settlement.
<p>
   The high court said that pending a ruling by a military
committee, police could not evict the Jahalin tribe from land
outside Maale Adumim, the largest Jewish settlement in the West
Bank, Israeli media reports said.
<p>
   Last year, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that the tribe had
settled illegally on the state property and could be evicted to
make way for settlement construction. Since the court ruling,
Israeli police have frequently raided the camp, forcing out several
families at a time.
<p>
   The biggest raid came last month, when bulldozers were brought
in to knock down 30 shacks and goat-hair tents while riot police
scuffled with tribal elders and weeping Bedouin women. The clan
stayed on the site after that raid, sleeping in the open air
without shelter.
<p>
   The Jahalin, who number about 2,000 in all, rejected another
site offered by the Israeli government in Abu Dis, a West Bank
village on the outskirts of Jerusalem, because it is near a garbage
dump and its rocky slopes are unsuitable for grazing by the tribe's
livestock.

Feyenoord shows fight to down Heerenveen
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Feyenoord Rotterdam took a step
closer to European soccer next season with an emphatic 2-0 win
Sunday over SC Heerenveen.
<p>
   Feyenoord is now tied for fourth with Vitesse Arnhem with 42
points, only two behind Heerenveen.
<p>
   Henk Vos scored on a header and Giovanni van Bronckhorst curled
in a free kick to take a 2-0 lead in the first half.
<p>
   Heerenveen's best chance to come back came five minutes after
the break when Rene Bot received a yellow card and a penalty for
tripping Boudewijn Pahlplatz.
<p>
   But Jan de Visser drove his spot kick too close to Jurek Dudek
and Feyenoord's Polish goalkeeper parried the ball.
<p>
   The Ivory Coast's Bonaventura Kaloo, who recently signed with
Feyenoord, came on as a substitute and was impressive on the right
wing.
<p>
   Earlier in the afternoon, Archil Arveladze, twin brother of Ajax
striker Shota, scored a brilliant hat trick in NAC Breda's 3-1 win
at FC Utrecht.
<p>
   But then he earned his second yellow card, for kicking the ball
away, and was sent from the field.
<p>
   FC Volendam defeated Willem II Tilburg 4-1, only the bottom
club's third victory of the season.
<p>
   And two of the three penalties awarded by referee Dick Jol
produced the goals in Sparta Rotterdam's 1-1 draw at FC Groningen.

Gunmen kill five bodyguards, wound provincial legislator
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP)  &MD;  A provincial lawmaker was seriously
wounded Sunday in a shootout that left his five bodyguards dead,
police said.
<p>
   Chawdhry Ghulam Sarwar, a member of the Punjab provincial
Assembly was driving near Jhelum, about 160 kilometers (96 miles)
west of Lahore when his vehicle was attacked.
<p>
   More than 12 gunmen in two cars sped past Sarwar's car and
opened fire with automatic rifles. Five bodyguards died immediately
and Sarwar was taken to a nearby hospital with bullet wounds,
police said.
<p>
   His condition was listed as critical, but stable.
<p>
   Police officials launched an investigation. While no one has
claimed responsibility, police believed the shooting was linked to
a political rivalry between Sarwar, a member of Pakistan's ruling
Pakistan Muslim League and his opponents.

Nepal permits 29 teams to climb various Himalayan peaks
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  The Nepalese Government has permitted 29
expedition teams from 18 countries to climb various Himalayan peaks
during the spring climbing season, the Nepalese tourism ministry
announced Sunday.
<p>
   The spring climbing season started Sunday and will last for
three months until May 31. Rains begin to interfere with climbing
from June in this Himalayan nation.
<p>
   Seven teams including four American teams have been permitted to
scale the 8,848-meter (29,028-foot) Mt. Everest  &MD;  the world's
highest peak  &MD;  during the season.
<p>
   A seven-member team from India will also try to climb Everest to
celebrate the country's golden jubilee of independence.
<p>
   A team from Singapore will make its first bid on Everest.
<p>
   Altogether 217 people have been included in the list published
by the ministry. Officials say more teams are expected to register
in the coming days. Last year, the preliminary list had 23 teams,
but by the end of the season 49 teams had tried their luck at
climbing various Himalayan peaks.
<p>
   The list so far includes six teams from the United States, four
from Japan, two each from Austria, Slovenia and United Kingdom and
one each from Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece,
India, Italy, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: UPDATES with at least 20 killed; reaction from ethinic
Albanian government; official police statement from Serbian police
regarding retaliation; trims.
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police swept through ethnic
Albanian villages in the troubled Kosovo province Sunday, while the
Albanians' leader appealed to the West to stop police violence a
day after clashes left at least 20 people dead.
<p>
   Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority,
which seeks secession from Serbia, appealed to the United States
and European Union to get Belgrade to halt police violence.
``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent Serb attacks aimed at
``intimidating and causing panic'' among Albanians, he said.
<p>
   The United States later expressed deep concern and appealed for
general restraint, but stopped short of strongly criticizing the
Serbian authorities, according to a statement faxed to The
Associated Press from the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
<p>
   According to an official police statment carried by Tanjug news
agency Sunday, police on regular duty were ``ambushed viciously''
and attacked with hand grenades, automatic weapons and mortars near
Glogovac, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina on Saturday. Four policemen were killed and two seriously
wounded.
<p>
   ``Reacting to terrorist attacks,'' the statement said, police
then killed 16 terrorists and captured nine people, five of whom
were arrested.
<p>
   A statement issued by Rugova's self-styled government and faxed
to the AP said Serbian police and paramilitary forces on Saturday
attacked the ``civilian population,'' including women and children,
in several villages in Drenica.
<p>
   ``Huge Serbian forces supported by armored and other military
vehicles,'' continued the operation on Sunday, the statement said.
<p>
   Ethnic Albanians, ``although unarmed'' were trying to defend
themselves from Serbian attacks, it said. ``Dead bodies could be
seen lying everywhere, along the streets, on gardens, yards and
fields,'' the statement said, calling the situation ``extremely
grave and tense.''
<p>
   The latest incidents are bound to increase tensions and chances
of worse violence in the province where 90 percent of the 2 million
population are ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is prized by Serbs as the
heartland of Serbia's medieval empire and home of treasured
cultural monuments.
<p>
   The incidents represented the worst single day of violence since
the Kosovo Liberation Army surfaced in 1996. The clandestine,
ethnic Albanian militant group has claimed several terrorist
attacks that have killed more than 30 people.
<p>
   The troubled region west of Pristina is reportedly under KLA
control.
<p>
   Serbian police used armored vehicles and helicopters to sweep
through the area Sunday. Gunfire and explosions could still be
heard there Sunday morning, ethnic Albanian sources said. Some
sources said police were going house-to-house after sealing the
area.
<p>
   Police said they found large quantities of various weapeons,
including hand grenades, mortar shells and explosives.
<p>
   Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.
<p>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic expressed condolences to
the families of the killed policemen praising their ``courage,
patriotism and sacrifice,'' Tanjug news agency reported.

Fedorov talks of what it's like to be the dlrs 38 million man
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DETROIT (AP)  &MD;  Sergei Fedorov has played hockey for 100 rubles.
And now, he's playing for dlrs 38 million. But Fedorov says the pay
doesn't make any difference when he's on the ice: The game is the
thing.
<p>
   Fedorov, from Pskov, Russia, missed most of the National Hockey
League season in a contract dispute with the Red Wings that came to
a quick end Thursday when Detroit matched the Carolina Hurricanes'
six-year, dlrs 38 million contract offer to the holdout forward.
<p>
   The 28-year-old practiced with the team Friday and drew more
boos than cheers when he took the ice against the Florida Panthers
that night. He was not a significant factor in Detroit's 3-1 win.
<p>
   Fedorov said he realizes the money is a problem for many fans.
And he said even he has some difficulty comprehending the big
numbers involved.
<p>
   ``How much is enough? That's the question,'' Fedorov said.
``Money and dollar signs don't make sense to me. Believe me, in
this world, in North America, money means something after you get
off the ice, and you go do your things.
<p>
   ``When you're on the ice, it's never really the thing. I've
played for 100 rubles. But it's a big sum, no question. I
understand that.''
<p>
   The contract includes a dlrs 14 million signing bonus. Fedorov
said he has no special plans for the pile of cash.
<p>
   ``I'll probably just put it away, invest it somewhere. Make it
work for me when I am done,'' he said. ``Plus, I have my parents
and my brother. I like to support them as much as I can.''
<p>
   Fedorov said he is eager to win fans back to his side.
<p>
   ``I want to get all of them back. It's so important because they
are the people who watch. The communication goes both ways. They
support the team so much. Fans all over the world are nice, but
these are the fans you want, the ones in Detroit.
<p>
   ``They brought us up to the next level. Like I said, they're
entitled to their own opinion because they pay big bucks to see
this show.''
<p>
   He said the fans are not the only ones with whom there are
strained relations.
<p>
   Fellow Russians Igor Larionov, Vyacheslav Fetisov and Vyacheslav
Kozlov criticized him publicly during the holdout.
<p>
   ``We're all grownups I guess,'' he said. ``I just wish for one
minute they could not have made those comments public. Then
everything now would be normal. I guess it will take some time. But
it will eventually come back to normal.''

Lowly Merida beats Real Sociedad 3-1, Athletic on the verge of a
Sporting disaster
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Goals from Brazilian Cleber in the first
half and Uruguayan Gonzalo de los Santos and Spaniard Juan Sabas
after the break gave lowly Merida a convincing 3-1 victory Sunday
over fading Real Sociedad in the 27th-round of the Spanish league.
<p>
   Javier De Pedro scored Real Sociedad's only goal in the 80th
minute, an impressive strike from his own half passed Merida's
dreaming Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Navarro Montoya.
<p>
   Just weeks ago Real Sociedad looked ready to snatch the league
leadership with unassuming efficiency from Spain's superteam duo of
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.
<p>
   Now it is stuck at No. 4 with a total of 44 points, trailing
league leader Real Madrid by six points and five behind No. 2
Barcelona that has two games in hand.
<p>
   Also Sunday Sporting de Gijon put in a surprisingly good
performance away to Athletic de Bilbao for a 2-2 draw.
<p>
   Sporting, with just one win to its name this season, was 2-0 up
at the break thanks to goals from Tomas Hervas in the 12th minute
and Russian Dimitri Cheryshev in the 21st.
<p>
   But Bilbao's Ismael Urzaiz saved the home team from the jaws of
the greatest shame of in Spanish league football this season with a
goal in the 62nd and another seconds before the final whistle.
<p>
   Bilbao stays at No. 8 with 41 points and Sporting stays bottom
with seven.
<p>
   In Saturday's games Real Madrid beat Mallorca 2-0 to hop over
Barcelona, although the Catalan powerhouse could claim it back if
beats Racing de Santander in its 27th-round match Monday.
<p>
   Also Saturday Atletico de Madrid drew 2-2 away to Espanyol, and
Betis imposed a 3-2 away victory against Compostela.
<p>
   In other Sunday matchups: Celta beat Deportivo de La Coruna 2-1;
Valladolid grabbed a 2-1 victory over Tenerife, Zaragoza drew 1-1
against Salamanca; and Oviedo 0, Valencia 0.
 &UR; Celta 2, Deportivo de La Coruna 1  &QC; 
<p>
   Luis Miguel Ramis gave the visiting team the lead in the 7th
minute until Russian Alezandre Mostovoi equalized for Deportivo de
La Coruna in the 70th.
<p>
   Celta managed several near misses, but only scrapped victory
thanks to an own goal from Ramis in the 72nd minute, leapfrogging
from No. 7 to No. 5 as a result.
 &UR; Valladolid 2, Tenerife 1 &QC; 
<p>
   Another own goal, this time from Tenerife's Brazilian Andre Luiz
in the 79th minute, handed the home team victory.
<p>
   Jose Santamaria had headed Valladolid into the lead in the 23rd
and Alvaro Benito equalized for Tenerife in the 52nd.
 &UR; Zaragoza 1, Salamanca 1  &QC; 
<p>
   Argentine Walter Silvani's 42nd minute goal gave Salamanca the
lead until Yordi Gonzalez equalized for Zaragoza in the 58th to set
the final score line.
 &UR; Oviedo 0, Valencia 0 &QC; 
<p>
   Oviedo and Valencia played out an at times frenetic but 0-0
draw.

Security Council vote on warning to Iraq expected Monday
Eds: Council meeting set for 1530 GMT
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The Security Council is expected to warn
Iraq on Monday of ``very serious'' consequences unless it opens
presidential palaces to U.N. inspectors but will stop short of
issuing a clear threat of military action if Baghdad fails to do
so.
<p>
   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, meanwhile, said his government will
honor the agreement signed last Monday with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to visit eight
presidential compounds which the Iraqis had placed off-limits.
<p>
   But Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Iraq believes the inspections
should not be open-ended, even though no time limit is contained in
its agreement to allow U.N. arms experts to enter presidential
palaces.
<p>
   The 15-member council meets at 1530 GMT Monday to consider a
U.S.-backed resolution, submitted by Britain and Japan, endorsing
the Annan agreement, which reduced the possibility of a military
strike by the United States and Britain.
<p>
   The final draft of the resolution warned of ``very severe
consequences'' if Baghdad breaks the accord. Earlier drafts had
used the phrase ``severest consequences.''
<p>
   Earlier drafts also referred specifically to a 1991 council
resolution which branded Iraq's failure to abide by U.N. orders as
a ``material breach'' of the ceasefire which ended the Persian Gulf
War.
<p>
   But Russia, France, China and others objected to any language
which might open the door to an automatic U.S. military response if
Iraq violates the Annan deal.
<p>
   In an effort to win unanimous support, the sponsors removed a
direct resolution to the ``material breach'' resolution. Instead,
the latest draft refers simply to ``all relevant resolutions'' on
the issue.
<p>
   Were the council to declare Iraq in ``material breach'' of the
1991 ceasefire, that would strengthen the U.S. case for launching
military action under international law.
<p>
   Although a vote was tentatively set for Monday, council
diplomats said it was possible it could be pushed back later in the
week. The final draft was circulated late Friday so council
ambassadors could refer the text to their home governments for
approval.
<p>
   In an interview Sunday with ``CNN Late Edition,'' Iraq's
Hamdoon, who participated in the negotiations with Annan in
Baghdad, acknowledged that the agreement contains no time limit for
the palace inspections.
<p>
   ``But I think that all the understanding was it should be within
a reasonable time,'' Hamdoon said. ``I mean, this process cannot
continue forever. There are certain sites that Iraq has opened up,
which are mainly the presidential sites, and there should be a
limit to that. But nothing was put in the document.''
<p>
   Before Annan left for Baghdad last week, the United States
insisted that any agreement should not limit the duration of the
inspections nor rule out the possibility of repeat visits as long
as the U.N. inspectors felt they were necessary.
<p>
   The inspectors are trying to determine if Iraq has complied with
orders, issued at the end of the Gulf War, to destroy all
long-range missiles and mass destruction weapons.
<p>
   That is the main condition for the council to lift crippling
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after Saddam sent his
forces into Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
<p>
   Hamdoon said Iraq wants to see the inspectors complete their
work and sanctions be lifted as soon as possible.
<p>
   Hamdoon said the secretary-general had assured the Iraqis that
he would ``try his best to work together with the council in order
to shorten that period'' until the sanctions are removed.
<p>
   ``But no definitive time limits were discussed,'' Hamdoon said.
<p>
   Any decision to lift sanctions must be taken by the Security
Council, where the United States and Britain have veto power as
permanent members, along with Russia, France and China.

Egyptian plane carrying baby food, medicine leaves for Iraq

<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian plane Sunday delivered 30 tons
of baby food and medical supplies, the latest in humanitarian aid
that sanctions-hit Iraq has been receiving from various nations.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried 11 Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq which
has been under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods have to be approved by
the U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The Egyptian plane, which landed at Baghdad's Saddam
International Airport, was carrying baby food and medicine donated
by Egyptian businessmen and pharmaceutical companies valued at over
1.2 million pounds (dlrs 353,000), said Cairo airport officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The Egyptian celebrities included actress Raghda and Parliament
deputy Ahmed Taha. The plane returned to Cairo with some of the
celebrities later Sunday.
<p>
   ``The delegation's trip is a message of Arab solidarity to the
United States and Israel,'' said Taha.
<p>
   A Moroccan plane carrying 10 tons of humanitarian supplies
collected by that country's trade unions is scheduled to arrive in
Baghdad on Monday, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
<p>
   The Iraqi government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo. A U.N. report says the sanctions have
led to widespread malnutrition.
<p>
   Also Sunday, several trucks carrying 180 tons of medicine,
clothing, blankets and powdered milk arrived in Iraq from the
United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   Saeed Mohammed al-Mansoori, head of the delegation from the
Emirates, said the aid should be seen as gifts and not handouts.
<p>
   Al-Mansoori, who heads a charitable organization in the
Emirates, said two plane loads of medicine were due in Iraq on
Monday.
<p>
   ``We will continue our supplies because Iraqis are Muslims and
brothers, and we must help each other in bad times,'' said
al-Mansoori.
<p>
   Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were active members of the
U.S.-led military coalition that ended Iraq's seven-month
occupation of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War.

Political momentum gathers for Israeli pullout from Lebanon
Eds: UPDATES with newspaper arranging telephone call between
families of slain soldiers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals
Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a
costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives.
<p>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday
that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided
Israel's northern frontier could be secured.
<p>
   ``If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making
appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be
happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of
U.N. Resolution 425,'' Netanyahu told his ministers.
<p>
   That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal
from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon,
and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to
ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
<p>
   On Friday, Netanyahu said he had ``no qualms'' about
implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had ``the
necessary security safeguards.''
<p>
   Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's
remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position.
<p>
   ``We will defend our north from the international border,'' said
Eitan, the science minister. ``No one wants to stay in Lebanon;
thus we think it better to withdraw.''
<p>
   Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also
suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in
Lebanon.
<p>
   ``This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk
today  &MD;  full stop  &MD;  about security,'' Lubrani told Israel's Channel
One. ``We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of
normalization.''
<p>
   As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government
has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon.
<p>
   Since 1985  &MD;  when the Israelis created the security zone in
southern Lebanon  &MD;  nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed
fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah
fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six
others.
<p>
   The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon
last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon
when two military helicopters crashed last February.
<p>
   In a country as small as Israel, the impact of the deaths of so
many young soldiers is deeply and widely felt.
<p>
   On Sunday, the Yediot newspaper reported a poignant telephone
conversation between the parents of two soldiers from the same unit
of the elite Givati brigade, who were killed three weeks apart in
south Lebanon last month.
<p>
   The newspaper arranged a call from the parents of 21-year-old
Lt. Assaf Rosenfeld, who live outside Haifa, to the father of
23-year-old Sgt. Nikolai Rapaport, who returned to his hometown of
Krasnodar in southern Russia after his son's death.
<p>
   ``We share your sorrow,'' the newspaper quoted Rapaport's
father, Ilya, as telling Rosenfeld's mother, Ida. ``I know you had
a wonderful son  &MD;  stay strong,'' she told him.
<p>
   Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from
Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between
the two countries, the Maariv newspaper said Sunday.
<p>
   The newspaper, quoting ``secret reports,'' said Syria had
indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week
by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture
to a closed forum in Baltimore.
<p>
   Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday,
apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said.
<p>
   Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years.
<p>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli
official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago,
saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange
for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked.

U.S. Olympian Perry wins famous long distance event
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MORA, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Kerrin Petty of the United States skied the
fastest women's Vasaloppet ever on Sunday, completing the
90-kilometer cross country race in 4 hours, 17 minutes and 2
seconds.
<p>
   Petty, who also prevailed in 1996 when the women only raced 30
kilometers, bettered the record set by Russian-born Antonina Ordina
of Sweden by a whopping 22 minutes.
<p>
   ``I have struggled this season, so I really needed this,'' said
Petty, who was a member of the U.S. Olympic team in Nagano last
month.
<p>
   Petty, from Townshend, Vt., competes for the biggest ski club at
Mora, a small town in central Sweden where Vasaloppet's finishing
area is located on main street.
<p>
   Renate Roider of Austria finished second in 4:19.33, Astrid Ruud
of Norway third 4:25.44 and Gudrun Pfluger of Austria fourth in
4:28.31.
<p>
   More than 1,000 women entered the women's race, held in the
classical style.
<p>
   Peter Goransson won the 74th edition of the men's race, edging
fellow Swede Staffan Larsson after an exciting duel on the final
stretch. Both men clocked 3:38.57, the fastest times ever.
<p>
   Some 14,000 skiers entered the men's race. Ingemar Stenmark, the
greatest slalom and giant slalom racer in history, completed the
race for the first time.
<p>
   The granddaddy of all long-distance races, the Vasaloppet has a
colorful historical background. In 1522, Gustav Vasa attempted to
gather peasants for a revolt against the occupying Danes. Vasa fled
when he got no support.
<p>
   The people of Mora then changed their minds and sent their two
best skiers to bring Vasa back. They found him near the Norwegian
border in Salen, and he returned to lead the Swedes to independece,
later being proclaimed King Gustav Vasa. The Vasaloppet follows the
same course from Salen to Mora.

Brazil's defender of indigenous peoples dies of heart attack
By JACK EPSTEIN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  Claudio Villas Boas, an
anthropologist who fought for the right of Brazil's indigenous
people to live in their jungle habitat, died Sunday. He was 82.
<p>
   Villas Boas died of a heart attack at his home in Sao Paulo.
<p>
   Claudio and his older brother Orlando gained fame for searching
out isolated Amazon Indian tribes and trying to save indigenous
cultures from destruction by advancing development.
<p>
   ``We were always together,'' Orlando told TV Globo News on
Sunday, ``from the time we went to bed to the time we got up, we
were always together.''
<p>
   They often were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and Marlon
Brando once was asked to play the more flamboyant Orlando in a
British Broadcasting Corp. mini-series.
<p>
   Claudio Villas Boas was born in 1916 in the small town of
Botucatu in Sao Paulo state. As a young child, he and his 10
siblings were taught to love the land and were given books about
pioneers.
<p>
   Their father was a lawyer who often traveled to the Brazilian
outback, returning with tales of primitive tribesmen that he had
encountered.
<p>
   In 1943, Claudio and Orlando joined a government expedition to
open up Brazil's vast unexplored interior. They quickly saw the
havoc that roads and landing strips were causing to native peoples.
<p>
   For the next 20 years, the Villas Boas brothers spoke out
against the integration of Indians into Brazilian society and spent
many hours in government offices encouraging officials to protect
them from ranchers, small farmers and industrialists who coveted
their lands.
<p>
   But Brazilian leaders were determined to open up one of the
world's last unconquered frontiers for colonization and spent
millions to build the Trans-Amazon highway.
<p>
   The Villas Boas brothers sought to cushion the shock by
persuading the government to create Brazil's only Indian
reservation.
<p>
   As a result, 18 Indian nations were removed from their ancestral
lands in 1961 to the new Xingu National Park, a 10,000-square-mile
(26,000 sq kms) area in the state of Mato Grosso.
<p>
   Six years later, the brothers helped create the National Indian
Foundation to protect Indian rights.
<p>
   By 1973, the brothers had tired of living in the jungle and gave
up their frontiersmen lifestyle to write books. At a news
conference, they even questioned their life's work.
<p>
   ``We never truly reached our objectives. All the pacified
Indians slowly lose their characteristics and authenticity and
their culture is corrupted through contact with civilized
outsiders,'' Claudio said at the time. ``Once pacified, they stop
being free.''
<p>
   Funeral details and further information on survivors were not
immediately available.

Ukrainian pole vaulter sets new world record to finish European
Indoors
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with details of finals

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VALENCIA, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Ukraine's Anzhela Balakhonova broke the
women's pole vault world indoor record Sunday jumping 4.45 meters
(14 feet, 7 1/4 inches) in the European Indoors Championships to
surpass the 4.44 (14 feet, 6 3/4 inches) mark set by Iceland's Vala
Flosadottir earlier this month.
<p>
   The record was the second new world best set at the three-day
championships following Britain's Ashia Hansen new women's triple
jump world indoor record of 15.16 meters (49 feet, 9 inches) on
Saturday.
<p>
   Balakhnova cleared the 4.45 height in her first attempt. Her
previous best was 4.33.
<p>
   The enthusiastic applause from an estimated 4,000 spectators at
the Luis Puig sports center in praise of the Ukrainian contrasted
greatly with the booing and whistling handed out to British runner
John Mayock after he elbowed his way past three Spanish athletes in
the final stretch of the men's 3,000 meters to take the gold.
<p>
   Mayock posted a time of 7:55.09 while Manuel Pancorbo ran it in
7:55.23, Alberto Garcia in 7:55.24 and Isaac Viciosa in 7:55.45.
<p>
   The Briton had got into pushing bouts with Pancorbo from the
opening lap. Then on the final one, just as it looked like the
Spaniards could take all three medals, Mayock muscled his way out
ahead and went on to win the race.
<p>
   As he ran a lap of honor, surrounded by press photographers, the
crowd shouted, whistled and booed in protest. Almost a half hour
later, he got a similar reception on receiving the gold medal.
<p>
   Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the triple jump world outdoor record
holder, won the gold medal with a leap of 17.43 meters, but failed
to snap the indoor record of 17.83 set by Cuba's Alliecer Urrutia
in 1997.
<p>
   In the women's 3,000, Romanian Gabriela Szabo, the world 5,000
champion, shot out ahead of Portugal's Fernanda Ribeiro, the
Olympic 10,000 gold medalist, in a dramatic final lap to take first
place, clocking 8:49.96. Ribeiro finished in 8:51.42.
<p>
   The two runners pushed and scrambled with several other
competitors at the start of the race and then launched out in front
together to keep the lead throughout.
<p>
   Italy's Fiona May, formerly a British athlete, set an Italian
national record to win the women's long jump with a leap of 6.91
meters. Russia's Tatiana Ter-Mesropyan took the silver with 6.72
and France's Linda Ferga finished third with 6.67.
<p>
   Germany came away with most medals, 12 in all, including five
golds. Russia came second with a total of 11, including three
golds.
<p>
   Germany's Nils Schumann set a personal best of 1:47.02 to take
the gold in the men's 800, with Marko Koers of the Netherlands
taking second place and Olympic gold medalist Vebjorn Rodal of
Norway finishing third.
<p>
   Ukrainian Sergey Osovich ran the 200 men's in 20.40 seconds, the
fastest time this year, to take the gold. Cyprus' Anninos
Marcoullides clocked 20.65 to take the silver and Britain's Allyn
Condon won the bronze with 20.68.
<p>
   Latvian Igor Kazanov garnered his fourth European Champion title
out of the past five by racing the men's 60-meters hurdle in 7.54.
Poland's Tomasz Scigaczewski was second with 7.56 while Mike Fenner
of Germany with 7.58 came third.
<p>
   Grit Breuer, Europe's fastest woman at 400 meters so far this
year, clocked 50.45 for a gold while France's Patricia Girard timed
an impressive 7.85 to win the women's 60 meters hurdles.

Egyptian plane carrying baby food, medicine leaves for Iraq

<p>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  &MD;  An Egyptian plane delivered 30 tons of baby
food and medical supplies on Sunday, the latest in humanitarian aid
that sanctions-hit Iraq has been receiving from various nations.
<p>
   The plane, which also carried 11 Egyptian actors, doctors and
parliament members, obtained U.N. clearance to fly to Iraq. The
country has been under sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
<p>
   Although the sanctions do not bar Iraq from importing food and
medicine, all imports of humanitarian goods must be approved by the
U.N. sanctions committee.
<p>
   The Egyptian plane, which landed at Baghdad's Saddam
International Airport, was carrying baby food and medicine donated
by Egyptian businessmen and pharmaceutical companies valued at over
1.2 million pounds (dlrs 353,000), said Cairo airport officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The Egyptian celebrities included actress Raghda and Parliament
deputy Ahmed Taha. The plane returned to Cairo with some of the
celebrities later Sunday.
<p>
   ``The delegation's trip is a message of Arab solidarity to the
United States and Israel,'' said Taha.
<p>
   A Moroccan plane carrying 10 tons of humanitarian supplies
collected by that country's trade unions is scheduled to arrive in
Baghdad on Monday, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
<p>
   The Iraqi government says hundreds of thousands of children have
died because of the embargo. A U.N. report says the sanctions have
led to widespread malnutrition.
<p>
   Also Sunday, several trucks carrying 180 tons of medicine,
clothing, blankets and powdered milk arrived in Iraq from the
United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   Saeed Mohammed al-Mansoori, head of the delegation from the
Emirates, said two plane loads of medicine were due in Iraq on
Monday.
<p>
   ``We will continue our supplies because Iraqis are Muslims and
brothers, and we must help each other in bad times,'' he said.
<p>
   Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were active members of the
U.S.-led military coalition, which ended Iraq's seven-month
occupation of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War.

U.S. Olympian Perry wins famous long distance event
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MORA, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Kerrin Petty of the United States skied the
fastest women's Vasaloppet ever on Sunday, completing the
90-kilometer (56-mile) cross country race in 4 hours, 17 minutes
and 2 seconds.
<p>
   Petty, who also prevailed in 1996 when the women only raced 30
kilometers (18.5 miles), bettered the record set by Russian-born
Antonina Ordina of Sweden by a whopping 22 minutes.
<p>
   ``I have struggled this season, so I really needed this,'' said
Petty, who was a member of the U.S. Olympic team in Nagano last
month.
<p>
   Petty, from Townshend, Vermont, competes for the biggest ski
club at Mora, a small town in central Sweden where Vasaloppet's
finishing area is located on the main street.
<p>
   Renate Roider of Austria finished second in 4:19.33, Astrid Ruud
of Norway third 4:25.44 and Gudrun Pfluger of Austria fourth in
4:28.31.
<p>
   More than 1,000 women entered the women's race, held in the
classical style.
<p>
   Peter Goransson won the 74th edition of the men's race, edging
fellow Swede Staffan Larsson after an exciting duel on the final
stretch. Both men clocked 3:38.57, the fastest times ever.
<p>
   Some 14,000 skiers entered the men's race. Legendary slalom and
giant slalom star Ingemar Stenmark completed the race for the first
time.
<p>
   The Vasaloppet's course is based on a historical incident more
than 400 years ago. In 1522, Gustav Vasa attempted to gather
peasants for a revolt against the occupying Danes. Vasa fled when
he got no support.
<p>
   The people of Mora changed their minds and sent their two best
skiers to bring Vasa back. They found him near the Norwegian border
in Salen. He returned to lead the Swedes to independence, later
being proclaimed King Gustav Vasa. The Vasaloppet follows the same
course from Salen to Mora.

Ukrainian pole vaulter sets world record at European Indoors
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with details of finals.

<p>
   VALENCIA, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Ukraine's Anzhela Balakhonova broke the
women's pole vault world indoor record Sunday jumping 4.45 meters
(14 feet, 7 1/4 inches) in the European Indoors Championships to
surpass the mark of 4.44 (14-6 3/4) set by Iceland's Vala
Flosadottir last month.
<p>
   It was the second world record set at the three-day
championships following Britain's Ashia Hansen women's triple jump
world indoor record of 15.16 meters (49 feet, 9 inches) on
Saturday.
<p>
   Balakhnova cleared the record height in her first attempt. Her
previous best was 4.33. (14-2 1/2).
<p>
   The estimated 4,000 spectators at the Luis Puig sports center
cheered the Ukrainian but booed and whistled when British runner
John Mayock elbowed his way past three Spanish runners in the final
stretch of the men's 3,000 meters to take the gold.
<p>
   Mayock posted a time of 7:55.09 while Manuel Pancorbo was timed
in 7:55.23, Alberto Garcia in 7:55.24 and Isaac Viciosa in 7:55.45.
<p>
   The Briton had got into a pushing match with Pancorbo from the
opening lap. Then on the final one, just as it looked like the
Spaniards could take all three medals, Mayock muscled his way in
front for the victory.
<p>
   As he ran a lap of honor, surrounded by press photographers, the
crowd shouted, whistled and booed in protest. Almost a half hour
later, he got a similar reception as he accepted the gold medal.
<p>
   Britain's Jonathan Edwards, the triple jump world outdoor record
holder, won the gold medal with a leap of 17.43 meters (57-2 1/4),
but failed to snap the indoor record of 17.83 (58-6) set by Cuba's
Alliecer Urrutia in 1997.
<p>
   In the women's 3,000, Romanian Gabriela Szabo, the world 5,000
champion, shot out ahead of Olympic 10,000 gold medalist Fernanda
Ribeiro of Portugal in a dramatic final lap to take first place,
clocking 8:49.96. Ribeiro finished in 8:51.42.
<p>
   The two runners pushed and scrambled with several other
competitors at the start of the race and then moved in front
together to keep the lead throughout.
<p>
   Italy's Fiona May, formerly a British athlete, set an Italian
national record to win the women's long jump with a leap of 6.91
meters (22 feet, 8 inches). Russia's Tatiana Ter-Mesropyan took the
silver with 6.72 (22-3/4) and France's Linda Ferga finished third
with 6.67 (21-10 3/4).
<p>
   Germany came away with most medals, 12, including five golds.
Russia was second with 11, including three golds.
<p>
   Germany's Nils Schumann set a personal best of 1:47.02 to take
the gold in the men's 800, with Marko Koers of the Netherlands
taking second place and Olympic gold medalist Vebjorn Rodal of
Norway finishing third.
<p>
   Ukrainian Sergey Osovich ran the 200 men's in 20.40 seconds, the
fastest time this year, to take the gold. Cyprus' Anninos
Marcoullides clocked 20.65 to take the silver and Britain's Allyn
Condon won the bronze with 20.68.
<p>
   Latvian Igor Kazanov garnered his fourth European Champion title
out of the past five, winning the men's 60-meters hurdles in 7.54.
Poland's Tomasz Scigaczewski was second with 7.56 while Mike Fenner
of Germany with 7.58 came third.
<p>
   Grit Breuer, Europe's fastest woman at 400 meters so far this
year, clocked 50.45 for a gold while France's Patricia Girard timed
an impressive 7.85 to win the women's 60 meters hurdles.

BC-Sports-Tennis-Advanta Championships, 2nd Ld-Writethru,0379
Sampras wins fourth Philadelphia title
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of final.

<TEXT>
<p>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP)  &MD;  Pete Sampras dominated with his serve at the
start and finish Sunday and beat Thomas Enqvist 7-5, 7-6 (7-3)
Sunday to win his fourth title at the Advanta Championships and
first this year.
<p>
   Sampras won his second straight title in Philadelphia, where he
played in his first ATP event in 1988 and won his first title in
1990.
<p>
   Enqvist, who won this event in 1995, has now lost seven of his
eight matches against Sampras, the world's No. 1 player. The one
win came the previous time they played  &MD;  in 1996.
<p>
   On Sunday, the final matched two players who had served the best
this week: Enqvist had 48 aces to Sampras' 39, while the top seed
won 85 percent of his serves to Enqvist's 80 percent.
<p>
   Although they made only half their first serves, Enqvist had 14
aces and Sampras eight plus a host of service winners.
<p>
   Sampras won 12 of the first 13 points and appeared in control in
the first five games.
<p>
   Then he began struggling on his first serve and Enqvist, who is
ranked No. 29, fired off a few big returns. He got his break back
in the ninth game when Sampras double-faulted.
<p>
   But Sampras won the first set with two cross-court forehands. He
slapped the first one past a diving Enqvist to end a rare extended
rally, leaving the Swede sprawled, banging his head on the court
and slamming his racket down.
<p>
   Enqvist broke early in the second set, but Sampras again found
his overpowering serve, hitting ace after service winner after ace.
He won match point the same way he won the first set, with a hard
cross-court winner.
<p>
   Sampras struggled early in the tournament, nearly losing in the
first round to 17-year-old Xavier Malisse, who made his first ATP
Tour main draw. But he still reached his sixth final in
Philadelphia.
<p>
   Sampras reached the final in San Jose, California, two weeks
ago, but lost to Andre Agassi.
<p>
   Enqvist is 3-2 against top 10 players this year, including
consecutive wins over Richard Krajicek and Yevgeny Kafelnikov as he
won the Marseille Indoor last month. He is 12-3 in finals.

Four prisoners die in prison rebellion
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  Nearly 300 inmates at a crowded
Amazon jail ended a 28-hour uprising Sunday, surrendering to
authorities Sunday after killing three leaders of the rebellion and
a fourth prisoner, a television station reported. Two of the
victims were thrown to their deaths off a prison wall.
<p>
   Some 280 inmates at the Sao Jose prison in Belem, about 2,000
miles (3,200 kms) north of Rio de Janeiro, surrendered after
officials allowed relatives in for brief visits, TV Globo News
said.
<p>
   The rebellion began as a jailbreak on Saturday, apparently
because of poor conditions.
<p>
   The prisoners seized nine hostages, including a priest and two
nuns, and threatened to kill them unless authorities provided cars,
guns, bullets and bullet proof vests for 50 prisoners, the station
said. To show their determination, they hung one hostage by his
feet along a prison wall for some 30 minutes.
<p>
   After prison authorities refused to negotiate, inmates who
wanted to end the outburst killed three of the leaders. It was not
clear why the fourth prisoner was killed.
<p>
   Two of the victims died after being hurled off a 50-foot
(15-meter) wall.
<p>
   In one dramatic scene shown on national television, police
rescued a severely injured inmate who was still alive after being
thrown off the wall. The police needed shields to protect
themselves from flying bricks, sticks and roof tiles.
<p>
   In most cases, prison rebellions in Brazil are caused by
overcrowding. The Sao Jose jail, for example, houses 280 inmates
with a capacity for only 150.

Germany's Martina Ertl clinches a win in Sunday's Women's World
Cup
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAALBACH, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Germany's Martina Ertl skied for broke
on a hard, fast course Sunday, edging Norway's Trine Bakke by .07
of a second, to win the women's World Cup night slalom.
<p>
   The 24-year old German let out a whoop and kissed her skis when
she stole the lead with her winning time of 1 minute, 36 seconds,
her first slalom win in two years.
<p>
   ``I'm more than happy,'' Ertl told Austrian state TV with a
smile. ``Today I was lucky.''
<p>
   Ertl won a combined silver medal in the Olympics last month, but
finished a tearful fourth in the giant slalom she was a co-favorite
to win.
<p>
   On Sunday, Ertl threw herself into the course, skiing with a
tight determination under the floodlights.
<p>
   Bakke skied clean and fast on the upper half of the course, but
lost time near the bottom, coming in second with 1:36.07. Kristina
Koznick of the United States came in third in 1:36.26.
<p>
   The heartbreak of the evening came when Australian Zali Steggall
hit her inner ski with the outer one, skidding off the course into
the fence. Steggall won Australia's first medal in skiing, when she
took the bronze in the slalom.
<p>
   Despite their home advantage, Austria's women failed to make an
impressive showing. Ingrid Salvenmoser's 11th place in 1:37.90 was
the team's best.
<p>
   Sweden's Ylva Nowen, who came in ninth in 1:37.63 failed to win
an overall title in Saalbach.
<p>
   The women's World Cup final will be run in Crans, Montanta in
mid-March.

Gunfight at carnival injures seven people
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VEGA ALTA, Puerto Rico (AP)  &MD;  A gunfight erupted at a local
Carnival celebration early Sunday, injuring seven people.
<p>
   Police said the violence began with an argument at about 12:50
a.m. in the Recreational Plaza of this town about 20 miles (30 kms)
west of San Juan.
<p>
   The dispute quickly turned into a shootout, as armed youths
opened fire in the crowded plaza. Carnival, which celebrates the
arrival of Lent, attracts thousands of revelers annually to Vega
Alta.
<p>
   One victim was hospitalized with a bullet lodged in his lung.
The others were shot in the legs and knees. The victims ranged from
ages 14 to 31.
<p>
   Police had made no arrests as of Sunday afternoon.
<p>
   In the last two years, violence has forced dozens of towns in
Puerto Rico to cancel local festivals, including patron saint
celebrations that date back centuries. The island's legislature,
fearing extinction of the festivals, has launched an investigation
into the trend.

U.N. official: Iran will not carry out death sentence on Rushdie
Eds: UPDATES with Robinson saying Iran will not carry out death
sentence on Salman Rushdie
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  The chief of U.N. human rights group said
Sunday that Iran has told her it has no intention of carrying out
the death sentence against British author Salman Rushdie.
<p>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said
she was given the assurance by Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif.
<p>
   ``He told me that that although Iran cannot revoke the death
sentence it has no intention of actively carrying it out,''
Robinson, who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, told reporters.
<p>
   But she said this ``has been said before.'' She did not
elaborate.
<p>
   Iranian officials have been quoted before as saying that they
cannot reverse the Islamic decree issued on Feb. 14, 1989 by Iran's
then supreme leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, calling
for Rushdie's head for allegedly insulting the Prophet Mohammed in
his book, ``The Satanic Verses.'' However, the officials have also
said they will not issue orders for the killing.
<p>
   Still, the reported assurance by Zarif would amount to an
official softening of the Iranian stand on Rushdie, who has been
living under hiding and under the protection of the British
government since the decree was issued.
<p>
   Only two weeks ago, on the eve of the anniversary of Khomeini's
decree, Iran's chief prosecutor, Morteza Moqtadaie, said that
sheding Rushdie's blood ``is obligatory.''
<p>
   Then, a state-run 15th Khordad Foundation said it might increase
the dlrs 2.5 million bounty on the Indian-born author's head.
<p>
   Meanwhile, an Iranian newspaper reported Sunday that a meeting
between Robinson and President Mohammad Khatami was canceled after
officials learned she planned to discuss Iran's human rights
record.
<p>
   The Farda daily said alarm bells began ringing in the Iranian
government after Robinson's spokesman spelled out in a BBC radio
interview Saturday what she wanted to discuss.
<p>
   It did not say when Robinson was scheduled to meet with Khatami,
a moderate cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's foreign and
domestic policies since he took over in August after an
overwhelming election victory in May.
<p>
   Asked about the Farda report, Robinson skirted the question. ``I
have an interest in having a direct opportunity to meet with him
and discuss various issues,'' she told reporters
<p>
   Farda quoted Zarif, the deputy foreign minister, as saying that
Robinson was in Tehran for the sole purpose of attending a U.N.
seminar on human rights, and not to discuss allegations against
Iran.
<p>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday quoted
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a meeting with
Robinson that Western charges of human rights violations in Iran
were politically motivated and untrue.
<p>
   International human rights organizations accuse Iran of
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture, harsh prison
conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and
restrictions on basic freedoms.
<p>
   Iran denies the accusations, saying its Islamic laws and
punishments should not be judged by Western standards.

Actor who played lovable Father Ted in comedy show dies at 45
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Dermot Morgan, the Irish actor who played the
title role in ``Father Ted,'' the hit TV comedy that pokes gentle
fun at the Roman Catholic Church, died early Sunday, aged 45.
<p>
   The silver-haired actor collapsed at his London home on Saturday
night and died later in the West Middlesex Hospital, family friends
said. Cause of death was not given but news reports said he
suffered a heart attack.
<p>
   Morgan, who just finished filming the third and last series of
the British-made program, told a recent news conference that he
wanted to spend more time with his family  &MD;  and avoid being
typecast.
<p>
   ``After three series playing this priest, I want to get out of
the dog collar,'' said Morgan, who would have turned 46 on Tuesday.
<p>
   Tributes flowed in from Morgan's compatriots. Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern said he ``was one of the greatest
entertainers ever produced by this country'' who ``won millions of
friends with his comic genius and sense of fun.''
<p>
   Former Irish premier Charles Haughey  &MD;  one of the main targets
of ``Scrap Saturday,'' the actor's barbed former radio show on
Irish state broadcaster RTE  &MD;  said the world will miss ``a
talented, innovative professional, who brought great pleasure and
enjoyment to hundreds of thousands of people.''
<p>
   Morgan and fellow Irish thespians Ardal O'Hanlon and Frank Kelly
played a trio of bumbling priests living on the fictional Craggy
Island off Ireland's west coast.
<p>
   The sometimes outrageous series collected the award for best
sitcom at the British Comedy Awards for two years running and won a
best comedy award from the British Academy of Film and Television
Arts.
<p>
   Some Catholic bishops complained that it made the clergy look
stupid, but it was a hit in Ireland as well as in Britain, where it
drew over 5 million viewers for Channel 4.
<p>
   Dublin-born Morgan studied at the city's University College
before going into teaching. But he left four years later for a
career writing scripts for television and radio, then became a
political satirist, touring the pubs and clubs.
<p>
   Performing stand-up comedy as the satirical priestly character
``Father Trendy,'' he built a cult following, but as his act became
increasingly controversial he found himself banned from radio and
TV in his strongly Catholic homeland.
<p>
   His comic song, ``Thank you very much, Mr. Eastwood,'' based on
the relationship between former Irish boxing champion Barry
McGuigan and his Belfast businessman manager Barney Eastwood, made
it to No. 1 in the Irish charts.
<p>
   In a recent interview, Morgan admitted that he was ``a lapsed
Catholic. I just don't think it's right for priests to hop around
the altar telling you what to do,'' he said.
<p>
   Morgan is survived by his ex-wife, Suzanne, and their two sons,
and by his current partner, Fiona, and their son.
<p>
   Funeral details were not immediately available.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: UPDATES with at least 20 killed; reaction from ethinic
Albanian government; official police statement from Serbian police
regarding retaliation; trims.
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police searched houses and
seized weapons in Albanian villages in the province of Kosovo on
Sunday, ethnic Albanian officials said, a day after clashes killed
at least 20 people.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians appealed to the
United States and the European Union to pressure the government to
stop what he called police violence.
<p>
   ``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent the Serb attacks
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, Ibrahim Rugova said.
<p>
   The latest fighting has heightened fear of all-out war in the
province, which borders on Albania and is seeking autonomy from
Serbia.
<p>
   Saturday's clashes represented the worst single day of violence
since the Kosovo Liberation Army began operating in 1996. The
clandestine ethnic Albanian group has since claimed responsibility
for several terrorist attacks.
<p>
   The U.S. Embassy in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade issued a
statement Sunday expressing concern and appealing for restraint,
but it did not strongly criticize the Serbian authorities.
<p>
   Gunfire and explosions could still be heard Sunday while police
combed the area of the clashes in armored vehicles and helicopters,
ethnic Albanian sources said.
<p>
   Police said they found large quantities of weapons, including
hand grenades, mortar shells and explosives.
<p>
   Another prominent Kosovo Albanian politician, Fehmi Agani,
visited the site and said large numbers of Serbian police forces
appeared to be creating an ``atmosphere of war.''
<p>
   A Serbian police statement carried by Tanjug news agency Sunday
said police on regular duty were ambushed Saturday with hand
grenades, automatic weapons and mortars near Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Four
policemen were killed and two seriously wounded.
<p>
   Police then killed 16 ``terrorists'' and arrested five in
response to the attacks, the statement said.
<p>
   But the ethnic Albanians's self-declared government said Serbian
police and paramilitary forces had attacked unarmed Albanian
civilians, including women and children, in several villages.
<p>
   ``Dead bodies could be seen lying everywhere, along the streets,
on gardens, yards and fields,'' it said.
<p>
   ``Huge Serbian forces supported by armored and other military
vehicles'' continued the operation on Sunday, the statement said.
<p>
   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanians. Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.
<p>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic expressed condolences to
the families of policemen killed Saturday, praising their
``courage, patriotism and sacrifice,'' Tanjug reported.

England last pair three runs away from avoiding follow on
By CRAIG COZIER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GEORGETOWN, GUYANA (AP)  &MD;  England was three runs away from
avoiding the follow on with their last pair at the wicket at lunch
on the third day of the fourth Cable and Wireless cricket Test
against the West Indies at Bourda here Sunday.
<p>
   The visitors, resuming at 87 for six in reply to the West
Indies' 352, reached 150 for nine at the break.
<p>
   Their resistance was led by Mark Ramprakash, whose confident,
unbeaten 48 was his highest score in 12 Tests against these
opponents.
<p>
   Ramprakash and overnight partner Robert Croft batted with little
alarms for the first hour and a half in the morning session. The
pair extended their innings-high partnership to 64 before
off-spinner Carl Hooper ignited a swift collapse with the wicket of
Croft.
<p>
   Croft, who had been badly misstumped by David Williams when 11
with the score 108 for six, eventually edged a cut to first slip.
The Glamorgan batsman made 26 off 91 balls with three fours and
batted just short of two hours.
<p>
   Four balls later, Dean Headley also got an outside edge to
Hooper, this time wicket-keeper David Williams sezing the
opportunity.
<p>
   Leg-spinner Dinanath Ramnarine, in his debut match, made the
score 140 for nine when Angus Fraser top-edged a sweep, Lara
running to the leg-side from slip to pouch the catch. Fraser's was
the fourth ``duck'' of the innings and provided Ramnarine with his
third wicket.
<p>
   But the West Indies could not put the finishing touches on the
innings before the break.
<p>
   Ramprakash, whose father is from Guyana, farmed the strike from
last man Phil Tufnell and the pair added 10 runs before the break.
<p>
   The 28-year-old Ramprakash batted just short of three hours,
facing 135 balls and stroking five boudaries. Middlesex teammate
Tufnell is unbeaten on one.
<p>
   West Indies captain Lara surprisingly chose not to bowl his fast
bowling ace Curtly Ambrose in the entire morning session.
<p>
   Ramnarine's three for 25 off 16 overs is the best West Indian
effort. Hooper has two for 19 off 11 overs and Courtney Walsh two
for 40 off 23 overs.

U.N. official: Iran will not carry out death sentence on Rushdie
Eds: UPDATES with Robinson saying Iran will not carry out death
sentence on Salman Rushdie
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Iran has said it has no intention of
carrying out the death sentence against British author Salman
Rushdie, the United Nations' top human rights official said Sunday.
<p>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said
she was given the assurance by Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif during her visit to Iran.
<p>
   ``He told me that that although Iran cannot revoke the death
sentence, it has no intention of actively carrying it out,''
Robinson told reporters.
<p>
   But she said this ``has been said before.'' She did not
elaborate.
<p>
   Iranian officials have said before that they cannot reverse the
Feb. 14, 1989, Islamic decree by Iran's then supreme leader, the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who said Rushdie should be killed
for insulting the Prophet Mohammed in his book, ``The Satanic
Verses.'' However, Iranian officials have also said they will not
issue orders for the killing.
<p>
   Still, the reported assurance by Zarif would amount to an
official softening of the Iranian stand on Rushdie, who has been
living in hiding and under the protection of the British government
since the decree was issued.
<p>
   Only two weeks ago, on the eve of the anniversary of Khomeini's
decree, Iran's chief prosecutor said that shedding Rushdie's blood
``is obligatory.''
<p>
   Then, a state-run religious foundation said it might increase
the dlrs 2.5 million bounty on the Indian-born author's head.
<p>
   Meanwhile, an Iranian newspaper reported Sunday that a meeting
between Robinson and President Mohammad Khatami was canceled after
officials learned she planned to discuss Iran's human rights
record.
<p>
   The Farda daily said alarm bells began ringing in the Iranian
government after Robinson's spokesman spelled out in a BBC radio
interview Saturday what she wanted to discuss.
<p>
   It did not say when Robinson was scheduled to meet with Khatami,
a moderate cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's foreign and
domestic policies since he took over in August after an
overwhelming election victory in May.
<p>
   Asked about the Farda report, Robinson skirted the question. ``I
have an interest in having a direct opportunity to meet with him
and discuss various issues,'' she said.
<p>
   Farda quoted Zarif, the deputy foreign minister, as saying that
Robinson was in Tehran for the sole purpose of attending a U.N.
seminar on human rights, and not to discuss allegations against
Iran.
<p>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday quoted
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying in a meeting with
Robinson that Western charges of human rights violations in Iran
were politically motivated and untrue.
<p>
   International human rights organizations accuse Iran of
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture, harsh prison
conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and
restrictions on basic freedoms.
<p>
   Iran denies the accusations, saying its Islamic laws and
punishments should not be judged by Western standards.

   LINZ, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Jana Novotna won a tournament for the first
time since November, defeating Dominique van Roost of Belgium 6-1,
7-6 (7-2) Sunday to capture the dlrs 450,000 Austrian Open.
<p>
   After sailing through the first set in 24 minutes, Novotna was
pushed to a tiebreaker and won the match in 65 minutes.
<p>
   ``I'm very happy on this day,'' she said. ``I've had a wonderful
week in Linz,'' she said.
<p>
   On Saturday the top-seeded Czech became the 14th player on the
WTA Tour with 500 victories.
<p>
   Neither player lost serve in the second set. At the start of the
tiebreaker, van Roost was treated on court for a shoulder injury.
Play resumed with Novotna leading 6-0. Van Roost fought off pain to
save two match points before losing.
<p>
   Novotna's previous title came at the Chase Championships in New
York, where she beat Mary Pierce in the final.

England fights back on third day

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP)  &MD;  England surged back into the crucial
fourth Cable &AMP; Wireless cricket Test against the West Indis on the
third day here Sunday.
<p>
   England reduced the home team to 127 for nine in its second
innings by close, a lead of 309.
<p>
   England started the day in dire straits at 87 for six replying
to the West Indies' first innings 352.
<p>
   Mark Ramprakash, who finished unbeaten 64, confidently guided
the lower order past the follow-on target of 153 and England
eventually fell for 170. It was Ramprakash's highest score in 12
Tests against the West Indies.
<p>
   Then England's bowlers exploited a West Indian batting fragility
to set up the possibility of a stunning come-from-behind victory.
<p>
   Pacers Dean Headley and Angus Fraser made the early
breakthroughs as West Indies openers Stuart Williams and Sherwin
Campbell again failed. Later, after a sharp, direct-hit run out of
first innings century-maker Shivnarine Chanderpaul, the spin of
Robert Croft and Phil Tufnell, with help from the little-used
Ramprakash, strangled the West Indies batting.
<p>
   Croft, the Welsh off-spinner, took the last three wickets in 15
balls for overall figures of three for 30 off 11.2 overs. Tufnell,
the Middlesex left-arm spinner, had the key wicket of West Indies
captain Brian Lara and Ramprakah broke a developing stand of 30 by
removing David Williams.
<p>
   Headley took the first wicket with a second ball that Williams
edged to second slip without scoring.
<p>
   Campbell hit an enterprising 17 off 22 balls before he was
caught at short-leg off Fraser trying to whip a delivery to leg.
<p>
   Next ball, the left-handed Chanderpaul gambled against the arm
of Nasser Hussain and lost. Pushing into the off-side, Chanderpaul
was centimetres out when Hussain's swift pickup and throw from
cover hit the stumps at the bowler's end. The TV replay umpire
confirmed the decision.
<p>
   The West Indies' most experienced pair, Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper, rebuilt the innings from a precarious 32 for three in
a composed stand of 43. But just as the balance was beginning to
shift Lara was caught at silly point off bat and pad off Tufnell
for 30.
<p>
   Hooper took his score to 34 when he was LBW to Headley's first
ball of a second spell. Australian umpire Darrell Hair sent him on
his way as he padded up to an inswinger.
<p>
   Ramprakash, who played an important role early in the day,
returned to capture his first Test wicket and trigger a slide in
which four wickets fell for four runs. The part-time off-spinner
dismissed wicket-keeper Williams with a long hop that he pulled
hard but straight to Tufnell at square-leg.
<p>
   Croft removed left-handers Jimmy Adams and Curtly Ambrose LBW.
Hiding their bats behind their front pad to balls that drifted in
with the arm, delivered from round the wicket, they were given out
by umpire Hair.
<p>
   In the day's final over, Croft completed a satisfying day with
the wicket of Courtney Walsh.
<p>
   England gained a huge psychological advantage early in the day
when their batsmen added 84 for the last four wickets.
<p>
   Lara ignored his ace fast bowler Ambrose for the entire morning
session. When he eventually came on after lunch, with the follow-on
saved, he wrapped up the innings by dismissing last man Tufnell who
added 30 for the last wicket with Ramprakash to make the West
Indies bat again.
<p>
   The match heads into the fourth of five days on Monday.

Business leaders propose Brady-type bonds for Asian crisis
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEXICO CITY (AP)  &MD;  Asia-Pacific business leaders proposed Sunday
that governments of the region's most troubled economies issue
bonds guaranteed by governments of their more stable neighbors.
<p>
   The executives said they would promote the plan during the next
few weeks to governments, ratings agencies and the Asian
Development Bank, which is widely considered the leading candidate
to market the new securities.
<p>
   The governments of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines have shown ``extremely strong support'' for the plan,
said Jeffrey Len-Song Koo, chairman and chief executive officer of
Taiwan's Chinatrust Commercial Bank. He recently toured the region
to discuss the idea with finance ministers and heads of state.
<p>
   Taiwan is the only government that has firmly agreed to
guarantee the bonds, but Japan, Singapore and Brunei are also
likely candidates, Koo said in an interview. The ADB or another
bank would also back the bonds.
<p>
   ``The beauty of this is that the supporting government probably
won't need to spend a penny, just lend their credit-standing until
the crisis is over,'' Koo said.
<p>
   Business leaders of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum adopted the plan at the end of a three-day
conference largely devoted to finding ways to defuse Asia's crisis.
<p>
   ``If we don't do anything now, just wait another year and we
will go into a tailspin worldwide,'' said Tajudin Ramli, executive
chairman of Malaysian Airline Systems and head of the business
group, called the Asia Business Advisory Council, or ABAC.
<p>
   Koo, who heads ABAC's financial crisis task force, said he hoped
pull together a more complete package by the middle of the month.
<p>
   Participants likened the securities to Brady bonds, issued in
1990 to help lift Latin American governments from debt crises.
Bradys are backed by U.S. government securities.
<p>
   But business leaders said they were going a step beyond Bradys
by promoting a ``new type of convertible government bonds'' that
would be similar to an asset-backed security, designed to help
companies that need foreign exchange.
<p>
   The business leaders meet several times a year to advise APEC
governments ahead of their annual heads-of-state meeting. The heads
of state meet in November in Malaysia.

Governor Schroeder wins reelection  &MD;  and chance to challenge Kohl
Eds: UPDATES with final results, moves up reference to record
Social Democratic win.

<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a state vote with nationwide
consequences, Lower Saxony governor Gerhard Schroeder won a
sweeping re-election Sunday  &MD;  and, in the process, a shot at
ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years in power.
<p>
   Confident in the governor's popularity, the Social Democratic
party said it will nominate the telegenic Schroeder on Monday as
its candidate in September's race against the conservative
chancellor, Europe's longest-serving leader.
<p>
   ``The Kohl era is over,'' Schroeder declared after partial
returns gave his party more than 48 percent of the vote  &MD;  a record
win for his party in the state  &MD;  compared to about 36 percent for
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
<p>
   The 53-year-old Schroeder, who said he would accept the
nomination, said Sunday's eleection ``signals a deep-seated wish
for change in politics.'' Already campaigning, the governor said he
would fight to end unemployment, a key election issue with German
joblessness at a postwar high of more than 12 percent.
<p>
   A fan of U.S. President Bill Clinton and British leader Tony
Blair, Schroeder presents a moderate-left challenge to years of
conservative rule  &MD;  much as with Clinton in 1992 and Blair last
year. He wants to reach out to middle-class voters to avenge four
straight Social Democratic defeats by Kohl.
<p>
   For Europe, a victory by Schroeder in the chancellor's race
would extend the continent's shift to the left, following Blair's
Labor Party win and the election of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
<p>
   Christian Democrats were quick to dismiss the election's
importance. ``A huge victory in one state has no meaning in the
federal elections,'' Peter Hintze, the party leader, said in Bonn.
<p>
   Still, many Lower Saxons saw larger consequences in Sunday's
vote, casting their ballot for Schroeder to send him into the
chancellor's race even though that would take him away from the
state.
<p>
   ``I voted for the SPD so he'll become a chancellor candidate,''
said student Jakob Krovoza, 22. ``He stands for economic
competence.''
<p>
   The Lower Saxony governor's recipe of saving jobs with state aid
while promoting flexible working hours and deregulation has served
him well. His northern state relies on jobs in heavy industry and
at Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
<p>
   But Schoeder's biggest appeal may be that he presents a new face
to Germans ready for a change.
<p>
   ``We need some movement in German politics,'' said Rosemarie
Bewersdorff, 68, after casting her vote in Hanover. ``It's always
that way when parties have been in power too long.''
<p>
   Polls indicate Schroeder has a far stronger chance to beat Kohl
on Sept. 27 that the Social Democratic Party leader Oskar
Lafontaine  &MD;  who suffered a bruising defeat to Kohl in the
chancellor's race in 1990.
<p>
   ``Tomorrow, Gehrard Schroeder will become the Social Democrat's
chancellor candidate,'' said party manager Franz Muntefering.
Lafontaine, setting aside his own ambitions, is to recommend
Schroeder personally.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to keep Schroeder out of the chancellor's
race, Kohl had campaigned heavily in Lower Saxony for Schroeder's
rival, Christian Democratic Union candidate Christian Wulff.
<p>
   Becoming chancellor has long been Schroeder's dream. In the
early 1990s, he was quoted as saying he wanted to open an annual
trade expo in Hanover as chancellor in the year 2000.
<p>
   Lore has it that as a young parliament member in the '80s,
Schroeder stood outside the chancellory in Bonn after a late night
of drinking and called out, ``I want to be there!''
<p>
   The governor's assets with voters include his rise from humble
working-class origins, though nowadays he sports Cuban cigars and
designer suits.
<p>
   But critics, such as Wulff, note that Schroeder has offered few
detailed ideas on fighting unemployment and that his state's
economy lags behind more prosperous conservative-ruled southern
German states.
<p>
   Sunday's vote was the first major test of Social Democrat's
strength in the election year. Lower Saxony's 5.9 million voters
elected a 155-seat state parliament, which chooses the state
premier, or governor. The Social Democrats held a one-seat absolute
majority in the outgoing legislature.
<p>
   Schroeder had declared he would not accept his party's
nomination for the chancellor's race unless Sunday's voting results
gave his party at least 42.3 percent  &MD;  just two percentage points
less than it won in the last election in 1994.
<p>
   Final returns put the Social Democrats safely above that target
with 47.9 percent of the vote, up from 44.3 percent in 1994. The
CDU fell to 35.9 percent from 36.4 percent, and the third-strongest
party, the Greens, dipped to 7 percent from 7.4 percent.

   Moderate northern swells continued to move through the local
Atlantic waters and the passages into the Caribbean. They will
continue to decrease today, producing improved marine conditions. A

<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  Madonna doesn't want her baby daughter to be
an only child.
<p>
   ``I would love to have a brother or sister for Lola,'' Madonna
said. ``I don't know when, but it'll happen.''
<p>
   Lola is Madonna's nickname for her 16-month-old daughter,
Lourdes Maria, who the 39-year-old superstar says has made her life
``infinitely richer.''
<p>
   ``I feel like I'm starting my life all over in some ways,''
Madonna said. ``My daughter's birth was like a rebirth for me.''
<p>
   The Material Girl has a new album out, ``Ray of Light,'' but
wants to limit touring so she can spend as much time with Lourdes
as possible, saying motherhood brought emotional growth for the
entertainer often criticized as childish.
<p>
   ``I got to a point where I went, `OK, I've been incredibly
petulant, incredibly self-indulgent, incredibly naive,''' she said.
``But I needed to do all of those things to get where I am now, and
where I am now I'm very happy with.
<p>
   ``I don't have any regrets.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  &MD;  Courtney Love quashed it at Sundance. Now
Kurt Cobain's widow is warning a movie theater against screening a
documentary suggesting that Cobain's death was no suicide.
<p>
   ``Kurt and Courtney,'' by British filmmaker Nick Broomfield,
opened Friday at the Roxie Cinema, the same day the theater got a
letter from Love's lawyer warning that the theater would share any
liability with the filmmaker and those in it who raise questions
about Love's role in Cobain's death.
<p>
   ``We are told that Mr. Broomfield's movie conveys the message
that Ms. Love killed her husband Kurt Cobain or somehow
participated in his murder. Such accusations are false and
defamatory, nothing more,'' the letter from lawyer Michael Chodos
said.
<p>
   Cobain, lead singer of the band Nirvana, was found dead in his
Seattle home in 1994 of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the
head. He was on heroin at the time and although his death was ruled
a suicide, questions and conspiracy theories continued to swirl on
the Internet.
<p>
   Love's estranged father, along with many of the couple's former
friends, say in the film that they believe Ms. Love may have been
involved in Cobain's death.
<p>
   Love succeeded in getting the film withdrawn from the Sundance
Film Festival in January, claiming it featured unauthorized music.
Broomfield, who said all licensing was in order, accused festival
organizers of cowardice.
<p>
   Roxie Cinema owner Bill Banning laughed off the legal threat.
<p>
   ``So far, so good. We haven't had any bailiffs show up or
anything like that,'' he said Friday after the first few
screenings. ``It's really a First Amendment issue.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP)  &MD;  Cosmologist Stephen Hawking will give
a lecture at the White House on March 6 on ``science in the next
millennium,'' Cambridge University says.
<p>
   Hawking, author of the best-selling ``A Brief History of Time''
and Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge, will address
160 guests at the second of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
``millennium evenings,'' the university said Friday.
<p>
   Hawking, 56, is paralyzed by motor neuron disease and has been
unable to speak since 1985. He communicates through an electronic
synthesizer.
<p>
   He said he believes the next century will bring big changes.
<p>
   ``Most visions of the future show a society with very advanced
science and technology, but in an unchanging state. I question this
picture,'' Hawking said. ``I think it is more likely that
biological and electronic complexity will increase at an ever more
rapid rate.''

   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Vote counting that begins Monday wraps
up India's protracted parliamentary elections, but that is unlikely
to end political uncertainty in the world's largest democracy. With
opinion surveys showing no party would win a clear majority, the
major blocs were already holding strategy sessions. The Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Partyis expected to win the most
seats, but not enough to form a government without partners. The
party said it would begin talks with potential allies on Wednesday.
For their part, leaders of parties opposed to the BJP met
informally to discuss the likelihood of cobbling together an
alliance like the 14-party one ousted in December.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  With the Security Council expected to
threaten ``very severe consequences,'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador said
Sunday his government will honor an agreement to open suspected
weapons sites to U.N. inspectors. But Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said
the inspections should not be open-ended, even though no time limit
is mentioned in the agreement signed last week with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan The 15-member council was scheduled to
meet Monday to consider a U.S.-backed resolution, submitted by
Britain and Japan, endorsing the Annan agreement, which reduced the
possibility of a military strike by the United States and Britain.
The final draft of the resolution warned of ``very severe''
consequences if Baghdad breaks the accord. Earlier drafts used the
phrase ``severest consequences.'' (UN-IRAQ)
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Serbian police searched houses and
seized weapons in Albanian villages in the province of Kosovo on
Sunday, ethnic Albanian officials said, a day after clashes killed
at least 20 people. Meanwhile, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians
appealed to the United States and the European Union to pressure
the government to stop what he called police violence. The latest
fighting has heightened fear of all-out war in the province, which
borders on Albania and is seeking autonomy from Serbia. Saturday's
clashes represented the worst single day of violence since the
clandestine ethnic Albanian group, the Kosovo Liberation Army,
began operating in 1996. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Iran has said it has no intention of
carrying out the death sentence of British author Salman Rushdie,
the United Nations' top human rights official said Sunday. Mary
Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she was
given the assurance by Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif
during her visit to Iran. ``He told me that that although Iran
cannot revoke the death sentence, it has no intention of actively
carrying it out,'' Robinson said. Without elaborating, she said
this ``has been said before.'' Despite previous indications that
Iran no longer intends to kill Rushdie, several officials have
called for the author's death in recent weeks. Rushdie has been
living in hiding since 1989, when Iran's then-spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said Rushdie should be killed for
insulting the Prophet Mohammed in his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
(IRAN-HUMAN RIGHTS)
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals
Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a
costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet that Israel was
willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon, provided Israel's
northern frontier could be secured. As the death toll in Lebanon
mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing
grassroots movement calling for unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon.
The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last
year. Israel has occupied a piece of southern Lebanon since 1985 to
prevent border infiltrations. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)

Severe thunderstorms return to Florida
By The Associated Press
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Severe thunderstorms rippled across Florida on Sunday with
damaging wind, and snow showers were scattered across the northern
Plains in the aftermath of a blizzard that left drifts up to 10
feet high.
<p>
   A line of strong thunderstorms rolled southward across Florida
from early in the morning into the afternoon.
<p>
   Strong wind during the night damaged the roof of an elementary
school in Sarasota, Fla., on the Gulf Coast south of Tampa, and
blew out windows in all 12 classrooms. Local officials said it
might have been a tornado but there was no immediate confirmation.
<p>
   Stiff wind accompanied snow showers across the northern Plains,
cutting visibility across parts of the Dakotas.
<p>
   The region was struck by a blizzard late in the week that dumped
5 to 6 feet of snow on the Black Hills of western South Dakota and
piled drifts 10 feet high in eastern Montana.
<p>
   Most roads in the Dakotas and eastern Montana were reopened
Sunday, although a 100-mile stretch of Interstate 94 remained shut
down for a third day from Glendive, Mont., to Dickinson, N.D.
<p>
   Light snow showers also were scattered across parts of
Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and northern Illinois on Sunday.
<p>
   A weakening cold front pushing across the Northwest produced
light afternoon showers over western sections of Washington and
Oregon and parts of northern California.
<p>
   At higher elevations, the rain turned to snow across the
Cascades, Olympics and Blue mountains.
<p>
   Elsewhere, a few light showers were scattered over the upper
Ohio Valley and along the East Coast from Virginia into New
England.
<p>
   February ended with records across the Great Lakes into the
Northeast.
<p>
   It was the first February on record that no snow fell at
Springfield, Ill., and in New York City.
<p>
   Several cities had the warmest average February temperatures on
record, including 34.1 at Buffalo, N.Y.; 38.6 at Allentown, Pa.;
28.4 at Marquette, Mich.; 37.6 at Cleveland; 43 at Atlantic City,
N.J., and 37 at Akron, Ohio.
<p>
   Sunday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a
morning low of 9 below zero at Gunnison, Colo., and Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo., to an afternoon high of 86 at Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. The lowest wind chill was 31 below zero at Jackson, Wyo.

World Court hears territorial dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon
Eds: Hearing set for 0900 GMT.

<TEXT>
<p>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  At its darkest hour, it brought
two West African neighbors to the brink of war. Now the World Court
is trying to mediate a quarrel between Nigeria and Cameroon over a
piece of oil-rich land.
<p>
   The court, the U.N.'s highest judicial body, opens hearings
Monday on a protracted territorial showdown over the Bakassi
peninsula  &MD;  a dispute that has bruised the two countries' relations
for decades.
<p>
   Both countries claim sovereignty over the territory and have
deployed troops to their respective sides of the peninsula, which
juts into the Gulf of Guinea where the two countries' borders meet.
<p>
   Cameroon accuses Nigeria, a West African political and petroleum
giant, of illegally occupying its territory. It has asked the World
Court to order an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of
Nigerian troops and has demanded reparations.
<p>
   Nigeria, which maintains that the states should settle all
boundary disputes themselves, plans to challenge the U.N. court's
jurisdiction.
<p>
   Its delegation, led by Nigerian attorney general Alhaji
Abdullahi Ibrahim, was expected to dismiss Cameroon's claims as
inadmissible, according to a statement by the court.
<p>
   Nigeria was slated to present its arguments on Monday, the first
day of a hearing expected to last six days. Cameroon was to outline
its case beginning Thursday.
<p>
   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
only hears disputes between nations. Because it has no enforcement
powers, it relies on nations to voluntarily comply with its
rulings.
<p>
   The latest round of hearings deals only with preliminary
objections and not on the actual merits of the case. A definitive
ruling is not expected for several years.
<p>
   Cameroon and Nigeria almost went to war over the Bakassi
peninsula in 1981. Nigeria, at the last moment, refrained from
avenging the slaying of five Nigerian soldiers by Cameroon troops
on Bakassi.
<p>
   There since have been repeated skirmishes, notably in early
1996, when a series of bloody clashes prompted Cameroon to ask the
World Court to issue emergency measures to halt the fighting.
<p>
   The court immediately called on both parties to refrain from
further military action.
<p>
   Though there has been a hiatus in hostilities, both sides
continue to maintain a heavy military presence in the area.

   QUITO, Ecuador (AP)  &MD;  The death toll from an explosion and
intense fire at Ecuador's largest pipeline rose to 11 on Sunday
after four people died of burns suffered during the blaze, the Red
Cross said.
<p>
   The fireball from the explosion razed a residential neighborhood
near the pipeline Thursday night, killing seven people instantly,
injuring 80 and causing residents to throw themselves into a river
to escape the flames.
<p>
   More than 600 people were left homeless by the blaze, which
occurred near the port of Esmeraldas, 110 miles (180 kms) northwest
of Quito.
<p>
   Three children were flown on Sunday to the Galvestone Burn
Institute in Houston, Texas for treatment, the state oil company
Petroecuador said.
<p>
   A fourth child died as the plane prepared to take off.
<p>
   The fire started when a landslide caused by El Nino-driven rains
cracked the Trans Ecuador pipeline. Some 8,000 barrels of crude oil
and 3,500 barrels of diesel spewed into the Tiaone and Esmeraldas
rivers, Petroecuador officials said.
<p>
   Local newspapers reported witnesses saying that flames from the
oil spill reached a store selling propane gas tanks, sparking a
fireball that accelerated the fire.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  &MD;  Argentine President Carlos
Menem's scheduled November visit to London will deepen relations
but won't ignore the countries' differences over control of the
Falkland Islands, he said Sunday.
<p>
   In a speech to open congressional sessions, Menem said his
government will continue to demand sovereignty in the South
Atlantic islands, which both countries claim.
<p>
   A war broke out in 1982 after Argentina tried to seize them by
force, but Britain retook the islands and still rules them.
<p>
   Menem will be the first Argentine chief of state to visit
Britain since relations were restored in 1990 by his government.
<p>
   In his one-hour speech Sunday, Menem also said Argentina will
seek a seat on the U.N. Security Council in 1999-2000.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Prizewinning novelist Elena Garro is
home from the hospital after nearly two weeks in intensive care for
heart and lung failure, her daughter said Sunday.
<p>
   Elena Paz told reporters her 81-year-old mother, the former wife
of Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, still has to use bottled oxygen but
was otherwise suffering no complications. Elena Paz is the couple's
daughter.
<p>
   Garro returned Saturday to her home in Cuernavaca, the capital
of Morelos state, 35 miles (55 kms) south of Mexico City.
<p>
   Garro went into intensive care at a Cuernavaca hospital when her
chronic asthma worsened and she started experiencing heart failure.
<p>
   Garro was awarded Mexico's prestigious Xavier Viallaurrutia
prize for literature. Her most acclaimed novels are ``Remembrances
of the Future'' and ``We're Fleeing Lola.''
<p>
   Poet Octavio Paz won the 1990 Nobel Prize in literature. He and
Garro were married for some 20 years before divorcing in the late
1950s.

Security Council to consider Iraq resolution
Eds: Council meeting set for 1530 GMT.
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  With the Security Council expected to
threaten ``very severe consequences,'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador said
Sunday that his government will honor an agreement to open
suspected weapons sites to U.N. inspectors.
<p>
   But Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the inspections should not be
open ended, even though no time limit is mentioned in the agreement
signed last week with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
<p>
   The 15-member council was to meet Monday to consider a
U.S.-backed resolution, submitted by Britain and Japan, endorsing
the Annan agreement, which reduced the possibility of a military
strike by the United States and Britain.
<p>
   The inspectors are trying to determine whether Iraq has complied
with orders issued at the end of the Gulf War, to destroy all
long-range missiles and mass destruction weapons. That is the main
condition for the council to lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990 after Saddam sent his forces into Kuwait,
leading to the Gulf War.
<p>
   The final draft of the resolution warned of ``very severe''
consequences if Baghdad breaks the accord. Earlier drafts used the
phrase ``severest consequences.''
<p>
   Earlier drafts also referred specifically to a 1991 Council
resolution that branded Iraq's failure to abide by U.N. orders as a
``material breach'' of the truce ending the Gulf War.
<p>
   But Russia, France, China and others objected to any language
that might open the door to an automatic U.S. military response if
Iraq violates the Annan deal.
<p>
   In an effort to win unanimous support, the sponsors removed a
direct reference to the ``material breach'' resolution. Instead,
the latest draft refers simply to ``all relevant resolutions'' on
the issue.
<p>
   Were the council to declare Iraq in ``material breach'' of the
1991 cease-fire, that would strengthen the U.S. case for launching
military action under international law.
<p>
   Although a vote was tentatively set for Monday, council
diplomats said it was possible it could be pushed back until later
in the week. The final draft was circulated late Friday so council
ambassadors could refer the text to their home governments for
approval.
<p>
   In an interview Sunday on CNN, Iraq's Hamdoon, who participated
in the negotiations with Annan in Baghdad, acknowledged that the
agreement contains no time limit for inspections of eight
presidential compounds which the Iraqis had placed off-limits.
<p>
   ``But I think that all the understanding was it should be within
a reasonable time,'' Hamdoon said. ``I mean, this process cannot
continue forever.''
<p>
   Before Annan left for Baghdad last week, the United States
insisted that any agreement should neither limit the duration of
the inspections nor rule out the possibility of repeat visits as
long as the U.N. inspectors felt they were necessary.
<p>
   Hamdoon said Iraq wants to see the inspectors complete their
work and sanctions lifted as soon as possible.
<p>
   Hamdoon said the secretary-general had assured the Iraqis that
he would ``try his best to work together with the Council in order
to shorten that period'' until the sanctions are removed. ``But no
definitive time limits were discussed.''
<p>
   Any decision to lift sanctions must be taken by the Security
Council, where the permanent members  &MD;  the United States, Britain,
Russia, France and China  &MD;  have veto power.

   NETIVOT, Israel (AP)  &MD;  About 100,000 devout Jews descended on
the dusty provincial town of Netivot recently to remember a North
African holy man through public prayer, euphoric dance and the
ritual slaughter of sheep.
<p>
   In the years since Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira  &MD;  a mystic known
affectionately as ``Baba Sali,'' or ``The Father of Prayer'' in
Arabic  &MD;  died in 1984, the annual event marking his death has grown
into a major festival for Jews of North African descent.

   According to Jewish tradition, the death of a ``tsadik''  &MD; 
Hebrew for ``righteous one''  &MD;  should be celebrated in the same
manner as one's wedding day. Abuhatzeira was one of the most
beloved leaders of the Moroccan Jewish community that immigrated to
Israel by the hundreds of thousands in the 1950s and 1960s.
<p>
   Celebrants come in droves to Netivot, where the mystic spent his
last two decades after immigrating from Morocco. At his gravesite
they light candles, murmur prayers and leave notes asking for
divine assistance in arranging marriage, jobs and good health.
<p>
   Straining to touch the gravestone, men and women of all ages  &MD; 
most of them Israelis, but some from as far afield as France  &MD; 
throw their notes onto the grave. Others throw candles into a large
fire nearby.
<p>
   ``Coming here, I am strengthened in my faith,'' said Keti Biton,
a woman in her 20s who made the trip with her family from the
coastal town of Acre, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the
north. ``I feel spiritually uplifted.''
<p>
   Vendors hawk photos of the late rabbi and other revered sages as
well as ``holy water'' and plastic cupfuls of arak, an aromatic
Middle Eastern liquor. Outside the perimeter, religious activists
solicit donations, Moroccan music blaring from their stands.
<p>
   The large turnout at this year's festival reflected the growing
attraction of mysticism and devout religious beliefs at a time of
rising unemployment and uncertainty in Israel's relations with the
Arabs, as well as a growing identity crisis within Israeli society.
<p>
   Especially affected are the masses of Israelis of Middle Eastern
descent who are dominant among the lower income brackets.
<p>
   ``God willing, may all your prayers and requests be answered ...
and the righteous one will help protect you,'' said a pamphlet
distributed to believers.

Researchers use serums, estrogen to test elephant birth control

<TEXT>
<p>
   KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Times have changed for
park ranger Douw Grobler.
<p>
   Once he fired tranquilizer darts to sedate elephants selected
for killing in a culling program that reduced South Africa's
burgeoning herds. These days he shoots elephants to help save them.
<p>
   From the back of a helicopter, he aims a modified 20-gauge
shotgun loaded with darts at a small herd of elephants 20 meters
(65 feet) below. With the dull thump of each shot, a behemoth
slumps to the ground.
<p>
   A ground crew of American and German scientists rushes in to
examine the three sedated animals. Their mission: to check if a
contraception experiment started about a year ago can limit
population growth enough to prevent the resumption of culling.
<p>
   Before opposition to culling halted the practice in 1994,
Grobler spent eight years firing a stronger tranquilizer that
knocked out elephants so they could be shot to death more easily
and safely. Up to 600 a year were killed that way in Kruger
National Park, which has an elephant population of more than 8,300.
<p>
   Since the end of culling, herds have again outgrown their
environment, destroying vegetation and threatening communities.
<p>
   ``At Kruger we try to limit the elephant population by
non-lethal means as much as possible,'' said the park's resident
elephant expert, Dr. Ian Whyte.
<p>
   The main way has been to move elephants to less-populated game
parks. But relocation is expensive, and on average only a few dozen
elephants can be moved a year because of a lack of places to send
them. In the three decades through 1997, just 1,339 elephants were
moved.
<p>
   ``They are reproducing at such a rate that we may be forced to
look at culling again,'' Whyte said.
<p>
   But researchers hope to show birth control can limit elephant
herds without the bloodshed.
<p>
   The helicopter carrying Grobler swooped after a herd of
elephants charging through the bush. The ranger picked out three of
the elephant cows in the experiment, each identified by a mud-caked
collar, and fired his dart gun.
<p>
   The research team moved in on the three cows lying within 20
meters (yards) of each other, snoring gently from the tranquilizer.
Within minutes the scientists had set up equipment and started
their tests.
<p>
   Along with blood and fecal exams, a specialized team from the
German Institute of Biology and Wildlife Research in Berlin
performed a trans-rectal ultrasound pregnancy test on the
slumbering creatures.
<p>
   ``Definitely not pregnant'' concluded Thomas Hilderbrandt while
watching the progress of the ultrasound probe through a specially
designed helmet. His colleagues, looking at a similar display set
up on the elephant's stomach, nodded in agreement.
<p>
   The researchers tested 48 elephants over a 10-day period  &MD;  18 in
the core group that had been treated with an anti-pregnancy serum,
10 that were given estrogen implants at the start of the test and
20 in a control group that received no contraceptives.
<p>
   Using vaccine derived from pig ovaries, the researchers
periodically shot the 18 cows in the core group with darts that
injected booster doses of purified protein. The protein provokes
the buildup of antibodies that prevent sperm from binding to eggs.
The method is widely used in zoos.
<p>
   Ten cows in the group treated with the vaccine were found to be
not pregnant, while eight conceived. In the control group, 18 of
the 20 cows were pregnant.
<p>
   While the results are statistically significant, serious
problems remain for developing an effective birth control program
for elephants in the wild, the scientists said.
<p>
   For the Kruger park, which is about the size of Israel, they
estimate that more than 3,000 elephant cows would have to be on the
program at any one time.
<p>
   ``Each elephant would have to be periodically located to receive
its booster shots. The logistical and cost constraints are
prohibitive,'' said Dr. Richard Fayrer-Hosken, a veterinarian from
the University of Georgia.
<p>
   The experiment highlighted such problems. One of the original 20
core group elephants couldn't be located during the testing period
and another was found to have been pregnant before the test
started.
<p>
   The parallel experiment using estrogen implants had to be
abandoned because it caused the 10 elephant cows to remain in heat
for extended periods.
<p>
   ``The bulls were following them around all the time, hassling
them,'' Grobler said.
<p>
   While none of the 10 became pregnant, the experiment was dropped
because ``this was not the kind of behavior we were looking for,''
he said.
<p>
   Despite the problems, Grobler said all involved hope for a
practical solution to one of Africa's most persistent environmental
debates.
<p>
   ``Nobody wants a return to culling,'' he said. ``We just have to
find an alternative.''

Dollar falls, stocks rise in early trading
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Monday,
while Japanese stocks rose amid expectations the government planned
a strong stimulus package to boost the economy.
<p>
   The dollar bought 126.08 yen in early trading, down 0.64 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
126.10 yen on Friday.
<p>
   The dollar came under selling pressure Friday on news reports
the Japanese government will unveil a stimulus package to revive
Japan's stagnant economy.
<p>
   On Monday, the nationally circulated Mainichi newspaper said the
government will map out a comprehensive economic package prior to a
summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations in May.
<p>
   The newspaper said the upcoming package will center on increased
spending on public works to buoy the economy.
<p>
   A resurgent economy in Japan would likely mean more demand for
yen as investors bought into stronger Tokyo markets.
<p>
   The yen has come under selling pressure in recent weeks over
worries Japan would not do enough to end seven years of economic
sluggishness.
<p>
   On the stock market, share prices started higher following
stronger futures prices. The government's reported plans for fresh
stimulus also boosted investor confidence, dealers said.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 303.10
points, or 1.80 percent, to 17,134.77 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average rose 329.97 points, or
2.00 percent.
<p>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 16.54 points, or 1.30 percent, to 1,288.99
points. The TOPIX had closed up 18.52 points, or 1.48 percent, on
Friday.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.670 percent from Friday's finish of 1.660 percent,
driving its price down to 108.91 yen from 108.98 yen.

Timberwolves 115, Pistons 113
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  &MD;  Kevin Garnett's corner jumper with 1.2
seconds left in the second overtime gave the Minnesota Timberwolves
a 115-113 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday.
<p>
   Garnett had 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for the
Wolves, who snapped a three-game losing streak.
<p>
   Joe Dumars led the Pistons with a season-high 28 points, but
Detroit lost for the eighth time in its last nine road games.
 &UR; Knicks 101, Lakers 89 &QL; 
<p>
   In New York, the Knicks got 32 points from Allan Houston and
overcame injuries and a height disadvantage to defeat Los Angeles.
<p>
   John Starks added 16 points and Charlie Ward 15 for New York,
which held the Lakers to just one field goal over the final 6 1/2
minutes and kept Los Angeles 17 points below its league-leading
average.
<p>
   It was the eighth victory in 10 games since the All-Star break
for New York. The Knicks outscored the Lakers 33-18 over the final
12 minutes and kept Los Angeles from grabbing a single offensive
rebound in the final quarter. &QL; 
 &UR; Pacers 90, Nuggets 63 &QL; 
<p>
   In Indianapolis, Rik Smits scored 23 points and Mark Jackson had
12 assists as Indiana held Denver to nine points in the third
quarter and sent Denver to its 11th straight loss.
<p>
   The Pacers, who beat Portland 124-59 on Friday to become the
first team in NBA history to score more than twice as many points
as its opponent, weathered some sloppy play but used a flurry late
in the second quarter and early in the third to take control.
<p>
   Denver was led by rookie Danny Fortson with 15 points, Tony
Battie with 12 and Anthony Goldwire with 11. &QL; 
 &UR; Hawks 101, Grizzlies 76 &QL; 
<p>
   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Mookie Blaylock scored 20 points
as Atlanta, despite playing without leading scorer Steve Smith,
rolled over Vancouver.
<p>
   Blaylock went 4-for-5 from the 3-point line and chipped in nine
assists and five rebounds as the Hawks won for the fourth time in
five games.
<p>
   Alan Henderson scored 20 points and Christian Laettner came off
the bench to chip in 18 points and 11 rebounds in just 21 minutes.
<p>
   Bryant Reeves and Pete Chilcutt each had 16 points for the
Grizzlies, who scored only seven points in the first quarter.
 &UR; SuperSonics 89, Suns 87 &QL; 
<p>
   In Seattle, the SuperSonics went more than five minutes at the
end of the game without a basket but used two free throws by Gary
Payton and one by Detlef Schrempf in the final minute to beat
Phoenix.
<p>
   The win gave Seattle (44-13), which has the best record in the
NBA, a 4{-game lead over the Lakers in the Pacific Division.
<p>
   Seattle improved to 5-2 in games decided by two points or less
and 9-2 in games decided by five or less.
<p>
   Dennis Scott finished with 19 points and Jason Kidd had 13
assists for Phoenix. &QL; 
 &UR; Jazz 106, Rockets 100 &QL; 
<p>
   In Houston, Karl Malone scored 21 points and gave Utah the lead
for good on a basket with 1:38 left as the Jazz overcame a slow
start to notch its third straight road victory.
<p>
   Malone's 16-footer put Utah ahead 98-97 and ignited a 9-0 run
after Hakeem Olajuwon had given the Rockets the lead with a
5-footer off the glass with 2:36 left.
<p>
   Utah, which also got 17 points and 14 assists from John
Stockton, won for the fifth straight time against Houston. The Jazz
have won nine of their last 10 overall. &QL;

Closing of mine leaves Chilean city with tough times

Graphic LOTA CHILE CITY
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOTA, Chile (AP)  &MD;  Lota is a grim city  &MD;  somber, windswept, its
main street lined by gray tin and wood houses.
<p>
   The few parks aren't kept up. Garbage clutters dusty streets.
Lines of drying laundry hang in front of the tiny houses with no
backyards.
<p>
   Roads that bustled for decades with trucks hauling coal from
Lota's huge state-owned mine are mostly empty now. The mine closed
in June, putting an end to the thousands of jobs that were the
city's economic backbone.
<p>
   Lucia Guerra, who at 19 just finished high school, says the
constant subject of conversation among her friends is about leaving
the city of 50,000 people, 540 kilometers (340 miles) south of
Santiago.
<p>
   Others don't want to give up on their city.
<p>
   The new Mining Renaissance labor union is campaigning to bring
new businesses to Lota and is pushing the government to do more to
help. Leaders criticize government efforts so far as too limited
and as poorly thought out.
<p>
   Members say they have heard about towns in other countries that
died after similar mine shutdowns.
<p>
   ``But we will not sit, arms crossed, (waiting) to see the
funeral carriage take away Lota,'' said Ricardo Rivera, who was
among the last 1,600 workers to lose their mine jobs.
<p>
   Rivera said severance money received by miners is still
circulating, so the worst effects are still to come.
<p>
   ``Shopkeepers are getting worried, as no jobs means no money to
spend in the city,'' he said at the union's improvised headquarters
 &MD;  a small office borrowed from a medical center across the street
from Enacar, the company that owned the mine.
<p>
   The miners' severance payments averaged 3.8 million pesos (dlrs
9,100). Many put the money in the bank and are living off the
interest. ``But others are simply eating it,'' one union member
said.
<p>
   The mine employed more than 20,000 people at its peak in the
early 1970s, but Chile's free-market reforms forced belt-tightening
at the overstaffed mine and the work force gradually decreased
until the final shutdown.
<p>
   At least 3,500 mine-related jobs in transportation and at
suppliers also have been lost or are threatened. Various officials
say the closing has cost the city's economy 1.58 billion pesos
(dlrs 3.5 million) a month.
<p>
   Victor Mendoza, president of Mining Renaissance, said the union
formed to fight for the former miners, but it also is working with
businesses and shopkeepers on ways to save the city.
<p>
   Yolanda Wilson, a city councilwoman and president of the Chamber
of Commerce, admitted that retail sales have dropped and that a
couple of shops have closed, including a furniture store.
<p>
   ``But Lota is not going to die,'' she said, describing her
``Lota buys in Lota'' campaign.
<p>
   ``The idea is that residents buy here, instead of going to other
cities attracted by larger stores that offer easier credit terms,''
she said at her beauty parlor.
<p>
   As the mine prepared to close, Chile's government promised to
ease the impact with programs to bring in new jobs, train laid-off
miners for new careers and provide pension money for early
retirement.
<p>
   ``It is not working,'' said Jose Saez, the union's treasurer,
who worked 16 years in the mine, 500 meters (1,600 feet)
underground in tunnels that stretch 13 kilometers (8 miles) out
under the Pacific.
<p>
   ``One program trained 100 barbers in a neighborhood of 200
people,'' Saez said. ``Are they supposed to give haircuts among
themselves?''
<p>
   An alternative-job program so far has hired only about 200
workers, who are paid 85,000 pesos (dlrs 200) a month to build a
road.
<p>
   ``That is only one-third of what they made at the mine,'' said a
union member, Arriagada Lepe. ``And you see people who are expert
electricians or mechanics just shoveling dust.''
<p>
   Another government program has created 80 jobs, and 200 former
miners were temporarily rehired by Enacar to dismantle the mine
machinery.
<p>
   ``But most of us are still unemployed,'' said Mendoza, the union
president who worries about the psychological toll on former
miners.
<p>
   ``They keep getting up at dawn, but then they have nothing to do
except stay home all day, which creates domestic tensions,'' he
said. ``It is very bad when there is no salary at the end of the
month.''
<p>
   The government insists it cares about the miners and the city
and says it has plans to develop an industrial park and build a
major port. It also points to its proposal for developing tourism.
<p>
   ``Look at this city. You see any tourist potential?'' Lepe asked
with a smile. ``Promises, promises  &MD;  those we have plenty.''

Europe must deal with developing nations together, Caribbean says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP)  &MD;  Unimpressed by European efforts to
divide trade deals with developing countries by regions, Caribbean
leaders said this weekend they will bargain alongside African and
Pacific nations.
<p>
   The negotiating body of the 15-member Caribbean Community
economic partnership said during a meeting in Barbados it is
unsatisfied with a 36-page proposal from the European Union to
bargain separately with the three regions.
<p>
   The European Union wants to rewrite a 23-year-old agreement that
guarantees 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries some dlrs 15
billion annually in aid and trade benefits. Prices on rubber,
minerals, farm products and other key exports from those countries
have enjoyed guaranteed prices in Europe.
<p>
   The perks are incompatible with new World Trade Organization
guidelines, the European Union claims. It has set a 2000 deadline
for a new accord.
<p>
   The European Union wants to deal with each of the three regions
separately. But that would undermine the developing countries'
bargaining power, said Jamaica Prime Minister P.J. Patterson,
chairman of the Prime Ministerial Subcommittee on External
Negotiations.
<p>
   The European proposal ``seeks to introduce a relationship on
less than equal terms,'' Patterson said. ``Equality must be
maintained between sovereign states.''
<p>
   The Community's chief negotiator, Sir Shridath Ramphal, said the
disagreement might derail talks. ``The positions are so extreme
they put us all on notice,'' he said.

World Bank president tours Central America to size up aid needs
</PREAMBLE>

<p>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP)  &MD;  World Bank president James Wolfensohn has
arrived in Guatemala on the first stop of a week-long visit to
Central America and Panama to size up the region's needs for
economic development.
<p>
   Wolfensohn made no comment to reporters upon arrival Sunday, and
drove straight to Antigua Guatemala, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east
of Guatemala City, where he met with leaders of a number of
non-governmental organizations.
<p>
   The group discussed with Wolfensohn the situation of human
rights in Guatemala and the implementation of the 1996 peace
accords that ended more than three decades of leftist guerrilla
warfare against a succession of rightist governments.
<p>
   The prolonged war, and similar wars in El Salvador and
Nicaragua, devastated the economies of the three countries and had
strong repercussions in the region.
<p>
   During his two-day visit to Guatemala, Wolfensohn will meet
Monday with President Alvaro Arzu and other top Guatemalan
officials. He will also stop in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica and Panama.

Mayfair beats Woods in playoff
By KEN PETERS
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VALENCIA, California (AP)  &MD;  Tiger Woods had his game going, a
hometown crowd cheering for him, and a perfect day for golf. Then
Billy Mayfair spoiled Woods' anticipated victory celebration.
<p>
   Mayfair, in a slump since having a banner year in 1995, calmly
rolled in a 4-foot (1.3-meter) birdie putt to catch Woods on the
final hole of regulation, then won the Nissan Open shortly
thereafter by sinking an 5-foot (1.6 meter) birdie putt on the same
hole.
<p>
   Playing in the group behind Woods, Mayfair shot a 4-under-par 67
Sunday to finish at 12-under. Woods, who has finished second twice
and third once in PGA Tour events this year and won a tournament in
Thailand, shot a 65.
<p>
   Mayfair, 31, got dlrs 378,000 for winning, more than his
earnings for an entire year in 1996 and 1997. Woods, returning to
the site of his first PGA Tour event, as an amateur in 1992, got
dlrs 226,000 for finishing second.
<p>
   Woods birdied three of his final four holes in regulation, and
Mayfair birdied No. 15 and No. 18.
<p>
   Mayfair won it when he hit his wedge from 90 yards (80 meters)
close to the pin after the pair returned to No. 18 for what turned
out to be a one-hole playoff.
<p>
   Woods pushed his tee shot into the gallery on the right for the
second time in a row, and hit his second shot 40 yards (36 meters)
short of the green. His next shot rolled 18 feet (5.5 meters)
beyond the hole, and his putt stayed left coming back.

   Mayfair, who had a career year in 1995, when he won twice and
finished second on the money list with dlrs 1.4 million, since had
lost his touch  &MD;  and his confidence.
<p>
   But, in winning the fourth title of his career, Mayfair led the
first two days, lost the lead the third, then came back on Sunday
to beat Woods, whom he called, ``The best player on the tour.''
<p>
   After Woods birdied No. 18 to go one shot up, Mayfair, playing
in the group behind him, hit his second shot into the sand to the
left of the green, some 25 feet (7.6 meters) from the pin, with a
hump between him and the hole. Needing to get down in two to force
a playoff, Mayfair, one of the tour's best bunker players, lofted
his wedge shot within 4 1/2 feet (1.5 meters) of the cup, then
knocked in the putt.
<p>
   Woods put the pressure on Mayfair with an adventurous finish to
regulation. He pushed his tee shot to the right, over the gallery
and into the trees. He got a free drop because he would have had to
stand on the paved cart path to hit.
<p>
   Woods hit his second shot into the trap on the left of the
green. His shot out of the sand skipped 12 feet (3.5 meters) past
the hole and nestled up against the fringe. After all the trouble,
he then curled in his 12-foot (3.5-meter) birdie putt to go to
12-under, pumped his arms in celebration, signed his card and
waited for Mayfair to play 18.
<p>
   Stephen Ames, the first and only native of Trinidad on the tour,
finished third with a 68 that left him at 9-under. The finish was
the highest for Ames, who tied for fifth at the British Open last
year.
<p>
   John Daly, showing signs that he's back from an ongoing battle
with alcohol abuse, shot his second consecutive 66 at Valencia
Country Club to move into a tie with Payne Stewart for fourth
place, at 8-under. Stewart closed with a 70.
<p>
   Third-round leader Tommy Armour III shot a 73 to fall into a tie
for sixth.
<p>
   The tournament normally is at Riviera Country Club, but was
shifted to Valencia, 40 miles (65 kms) north of downtown Los
Angeles, because Riviera is being readied for the U.S. Senior Open
in July. It was the first time a PGA event was held at Valencia. &QL;

Conservatives enter third year ready for fight over land bill
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government began its third year in power Monday by
returning to Parliament to push a bill limiting Aboriginal land
rights, which could trigger an election.
<p>
   Howard's conservatives ended 12 years of Labor government two
years ago in a landslide national election victory.
<p>
   Parliament's next sessions will include the reintroduction of
the Wik Aboriginal land rights bill which, if blocked by the Senate
a second time, could lead to an early election.
<p>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said he hopes the Senate will
pass the bill, which would end Aboriginal land claims on lands that
the government leases long-term to farmers, ranchers and miners.
<p>
   ``It deserves passage by the Senate,'' Fischer told reporters.
``It provides for farmers to get on with farming and it does not
wipe out native title.''
<p>
   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley said the government is
determined to force an early election before the Asian financial
crisis hits Australia's economy later this year.
<p>
   ``We've got a cynical exercise being undertaken by the
government here which will impose upon Australia an enormously
damaging election,'' Beazley said.
<p>
   Senior government ministers played down the anniversary's
importance.
<p>
   ``We think we've done an enormous amount in two years, but we're
more interested in what we can do in the third year,'' Environment
Minister Robert Hill said.
<p>
   The deputy leader of the Australian Democrats, a smaller
opposition party, said there was little to celebrate.
<p>
   ``I think it's one of the meanest and most destructive
governments in this country's history,'' Natasha Stott Despoja
said.
<p>
   The Community and Public Sector Union also said it had little to
celebrate after the loss of 62,500 federal public sector jobs and
billions of dollars in funding for child care, aged care and the
unemployed since the government came to power.
<p>
   ``In its stampede to better the bottom line, this government has
shown contempt for the Australian community's right to fair,
accessible and efficient public services,'' union national
secretary Wendy Caird said.

Khatami says Iranians should tone down their rallies in Mecca
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  President Mohammad Khatami called for
Iranians to tone down the demonstrations they hold during the
annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
<p>
   The call made in a speech broadcast on state-run television
Sunday appears to be aimed at improving relations with Saudi
Arabia, which has long opposed the political rallies staged by
Iranian pilgrims during the hajj, or annual pilgrimage.
<p>
   The hajj should be free of ``fanaticism, backwardness and the
propensity to impose one's views.''
<p>
   ``The followers of unnecessary rigidity in the observance of
(religious) injunctions are not the representatives of the Muslim
community,'' Khatami said. ``They should not be allowed to breed
hatred, dissension, and ignite the flames of conflict in the holy
precincts where unity, solidarity and fraternity should be
preached.''
<p>
   Ever since some 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, died in clashes
with Saudi police during a rally at the 1987 hajj, the
demonstrations have been something of a test of honor for the
Iranians.
<p>
   Every year, urged on by their leaders, Iranian pilgrims have
defied a Saudi ban on demonstrations to hold a small rally in their
living quarters in Mecca. Such rallies tend to condemn the United
States and other perceived enemies of Islam.
<p>
   Khatami is the first Iranian president to speak out against the
rallies and the move reflects his desire to forge a new
relationship with Saudi Arabia.
<p>
   Riyadh and Tehran have been edging closer since May's election
of Khatami, a moderate cleric who has been trying to temper Iran's
militant foreign policy.
<p>
   During the Organization of Islamic Conference summit in Tehran
in December, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held two meetings with
Khatami. It is likely that the Iranian rallies at the hajj were
discussed.
<p>
   Khatami's call Sunday could well draw fire from hard-liners in
the government who fear he is betraying the Islamic revolution of
1979. Conservatives have already criticized his call in January for
cultural exchanges with the United States, seeing it as a first
step toward normalizing relations with the country known as ``the
Great Satan.''

Europe must deal with developing nations together, Caribbean says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP)  &MD;  Unimpressed by European efforts to
divide trade deals with developing countries by regions, Caribbean
leaders want to bargain alongside African and Pacific nations.
<p>
   The negotiating body of the 15-member Caribbean Community
economic partnership said Sunday during a meeting in Barbados that
it is unsatisfied with a 36-page proposal from the European Union
to bargain separately with the three regions.
<p>
   The European Union wants to rewrite a 23-year-old agreement that
guarantees 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries some dlrs 15
billion annually in aid and trade benefits. Prices on rubber,
minerals, farm products and other key exports from those countries
have enjoyed guaranteed prices in Europe.
<p>
   The perks are incompatible with new World Trade Organization
guidelines, the European Union claims. It has set a 2000 deadline
for a new accord.
<p>
   The European Union wants to deal with each of the three regions
separately. But that would undermine the developing countries'
bargaining power, said Jamaica Prime Minister P.J. Patterson,
chairman of the Prime Ministerial Subcommittee on External
Negotiations.
<p>
   The European proposal ``seeks to introduce a relationship on
less than equal terms,'' Patterson said. ``Equality must be
maintained between sovereign states.''
<p>
   The Community's chief negotiator, Sir Shridath Ramphal, said the
disagreement might derail talks. ``The positions are so extreme
they put us all on notice,'' he said.
<p>
   There was no immediate response from Pacific or African
countries.

Ella and Campese team up for Commonwealth Games
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Two of Australia's greatest attacking
rugby players, Mark Ella and David Campese, will lead its sevens
challenge at the Commonwealth Games in September.
<p>
   Ella was appointed coach and his former teammate Campese was
named captain.
<p>
   Their first assignment is the Fiji Sevens in Suva on March 13
and they will then take a team to the Hong Kong Sevens later in
March.
<p>
   Rugby will make its Commonwealth Games debut this year.
<p>
   Ella replaces Tim Lane, whose duties with the Wallabies as
assistant coach have ruled him out of the Commonwealth Games
because of a conflict of dates with the Rugby World Cup qualifying
tournament also being held in September.
<p>
   Australian Rugby's managing director John O'Neill said that
having Ella at the helm was a wonderful boost for Australian rugby.
<p>
   ``Mark set the standard in sevens rugby as a player,'' said
O'Neill.
<p>
   ``He takes over a squad that has come along in leaps and bounds
under Tim Lane this year, but there's still a gap to bridge before
we can really challenge New Zealand.''

   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  With balloting in India's protracted
parliamentary elections nearly complete, the vote count now begins.
But when the tally is completed later this week, it is unlikely to
end political uncertainty in the world's largest democracy.
<p>
   With opinion surveys showing no party would win a clear
majority, the major blocs were already holding strategy sessions
before the count began Monday.
<p>
   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is expected to win
the most seats, but not enough to form a government without
partners. The party announced Sunday that it would begin talks with
potential allies on Wednesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, leaders of parties opposed to the BJP met informally
to discuss the likelihood of cobbling together an alliance like the
14-party one that was ousted in December.
<p>
   The last elections in 1996 resulted in a deadlocked parliament.
New voting had to be called three years ahead of schedule after
politicians spent the last two years trying and failing to cobble
together an enduring minority or coalition government.
<p>
   All the contenders promised voters the stability Indian so
desperately needs to attract foreign investment, revive its economy
and tackle poverty and illiteracy in this nation of 960 million.
<p>
   The BJP led the government for just 13 days after the 1996 vote.
At least one opinion poll said it had made strong gains this time,
giving it a better shot at forming a strong coalition. But some of
its potential partners differ with the its pro-Hindu rhetoric,
fearing it could create tensions between the Hindu majority and
Muslims, the largest minority at an estimated 120 million.
<p>
   Also, the BJP's India-first policy of favoring domestic industry
over foreigners worries overseas investors and some domestic
reformers.
<p>
   The centrist Congress party, which has ruled India for most of
its 50 years of independence, was plagued by defections and
corruption scandals when elections were announced in December. But
its popularity was bolstered by the entry of Sonia Gandhi, the
widow of slain former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, as the party's
star campaigner.
<p>
   A state-by-state exit poll broadcast on government-run
television showed BJP and its allies getting 244 seats, making
gains in almost every corner of the country, but falling short of
the 273-seat majority needed for a government in the 545-seat lower
house of parliament.
<p>
   But a second poll, by a private TV station, said the BJP would
get 208 seats and Congress 167. Congress held 140 seats in the last
parliament, while the BJP held 161.
<p>
   The first results were expected late Monday, but trends would
likely emerge earlier in the day. In all, 543 seats are at stake;
the two remaining are filled by appointment.
<p>
   Once most results are in, focus will shift to the red sandstone
presidential palace. Under the constitution, the president who
decides which party  &MD;  usually the one with the most seats  &MD;  should
be given a chance to govern. Once the party's leader is sworn in as
prime minister, its claim will be tested in a vote of confidence.
<p>
   With the current budget expiring March 31, the seating of a new
parliament can't wait for voters to choose the last six
representatives on March 7 and June 21.
<p>
   Four voting days have been held, with the first on Feb. 16 and
the last Saturday. Voting was staggered by region to allow security
troops time to move to different trouble spots.
<p>
   Only about 300 million of India's 600 million voters have cast
ballots in the election.
<p>
   Violence erupted on each of the four voting days. On Saturday,
eight people were killed in election-related violence, bringing the
death toll to at least 76.
<p>
   Fear of violence or pure cynicism kept many voters indoors.
<p>
   ``There is an element of frustration in our country,'' said
Purno Sangma, a Congress Party politician who was the speaker in
the last parliament.

Amnesty: political killings continue in Cambodia

<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Political killings by security forces in Cambodia,
and the government's failure to investigate them, could jeopardize
the country's chances of holding a free-and-fair election, an
international human rights group said Monday.
<p>
   The report, by Amnesty International, also criticized the
forthcoming trial in absentia of Cambodia's exiled former first
prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
<p>
   ``Unless action is taken to protect human rights, elections
scheduled for July will be jeopardized and the investment the
international community has made in Cambodia's reconstruction will
be put at risk,'' said Rory Mungoven, director of the London-based
organization's Asia-Pacific Program.
<p>
   ``Whatever the case against Ranariddh, it is clear that in the
present environment he cannot receive a fair trial,'' he said in a
statement. The trial is scheduled to begin this week in Cambodia.
<p>
   Officials in Cambodia's government were not immediately
available to respond to the Amnesty report.
<p>
   In a violent coup d'etat last July, Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
ousted Ranariddh, who had won the U.N.-supervised 1993 election.
<p>
   Ranariddh, now in exile, has been charged by a Hun
Sen-controlled court with smuggling weapons into Cambodia and
conspiring with the outlawed Khmer Rouge guerrilla group to launch
his own takeover. The charges are widely seen as politically
motivated  &MD;  an effort by Hun Sen to rid himself of opposition in
the election, now set for July 26 in Cambodia.
<p>
   Cambodia's foreign aid donors, including Japan and the United
States, have urged Hun Sen to hold a free-and-fair election, with a
credible opposition led by Ranariddh.
<p>
   Last week, Hun Sen said Ranariddh still has to surmount several
obstacles before he will be allowed to compete in the election. But
the government also dropped a residency requirement for candidates,
making it in theory possible for Ranariddh to be a candidate
without actually returning to Cambodia.
<p>
   In another development last week, a cease-fire halted the
fighting between troops loyal to Hun Sen and to Ranariddh.
<p>
   Prior to the agreement, Hun Sen's army had been trying for seven
months to dislodge Ranariddh's small resistance force from its
northern base near the Thai border.
<p>
   The cease-fire is a key element of a peace plan for Cambodia,
devised by Japanese diplomats attempting to mediate between the
country's warring factions. The plan also urges Ranariddh to cut
ties with the outlawed Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, and Hun Sen to
allow the prince to safely participate in the election.
<p>
   Amnesty said on Monday that Cambodian security forces have
continued the spate of political killings that began in the country
after last July's coup. It said no action has been taken to
investigate or act upon other extrajudicial executions, despite
repeated promises to United Nations officials and other visitors.
<p>
   In its report, Amnesty said that on Jan. 27, unidentified men
shot and killed On Phuong, 58, a member of the Khmer Nation Party
and his 5-year-old daughter, and on Feb. 19, soldiers shot and
killed three members of the Bun family, apparently because a close
relative of theirs was in forces fighting the government.
<p>
   Opponents also have been harassed and ill-treated by the
government and security forces, the report said, including an
opposition newspaper editor, Nou Kim Ei, who was shot on Jan. 11
while driving in Cambodia with his family.

BC-Japan-Loan Scandal
Former restaurateur sentenced to 12 years in loan scandal

<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  An Osaka court Monday sentenced a former
high-rolling stock investor to 12 years in prison for fraud in a
case that illustrated the speculative excesses of Japan's once
flourishing ``bubble'' economy.
<p>
   The prison term for former restaurateur Nui Onoue, 68, was
announced at the Osaka District Court, a court official said, on
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Onoue, once reputed to be the largest individual stock investor
in Japan, had been indicted on fraud and breach of trust charges
involving 270 billion yen (dlrs 2.14 billion).
<p>
   She was arrested in September 1991 on charges of colluding with
a former manager of a local credit union to use more than a dozen
fake deposit certificates as collateral for stock deals.
<p>
   In an effort to cover major stock losses, Onoue used the
certificates to obtain dlrs 2.8 billion in loans, of which dlrs 1.8
billion came from the Industrial Bank of Japan, a pillar of the
country's financial establishment.
<p>
   While operating a high-class Japanese style restaurant in
Osaka's Sennichimae entertainment district, Onoue spent huge
amounts on stock investments from the late 1980s through the early
1990s.
<p>
   Osaka, a major commercial and industrial center, is about 400
kilometers (248 miles) west of Tokyo.
<p>
   Onoue's saga had captivated the nation because it provided a
personal account of how the Japanese economy ran amok in the 1980s,
when wild speculative buying sent real estate and stock prices
surging.
<p>
   Four other finance company officials have been convicted of
illegally extending loans to Onoue.

Diana was conscious after crash, says bodyguard
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Princess Diana was conscious immediately after the
Paris car crash that killed her and Dodi Fayed, the bodyguard who
survived the accident has said.
<p>
   ``I have had flashes of a female voice calling out in the back
of the car. First it's a groan. Then Dodi's name is called. It
could only have been Princess Diana. I was conscious, and so was
she,'' Trevor Rees-Jones told the tabloid Mirror newspaper in an
interview.
<p>
   French doctors have said that Diana, 36, did not regain
consciousness between the Aug. 31 accident in Paris' Pont de l'Alma
tunnel and her death at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital.
<p>
   Rees-Jones said that Henri Paul, the chauffeur who was also
killed in the crash, did not appear to have been drinking. Tests
later showed Paul was legally drunk.
<p>
   ``If he had shown any signs of being drunk I would never have
let him near our car,'' Rees-Jones said.
<p>
   Rees-Jones, who worked for Mohamed al Fayed and was Dodi Fayed's
bodyguard, said he remembered two cars and a motorbike chasing
Diana's Mercedes after it left the Paris Ritz before crashing. One
of the cars was a white hatchback similar to a mystery Fiat Uno
thought to have been involved in the death crash.
<p>
   Although the bodyguard survived the crash, he was seriously
injured. For several months after the accident, Rees-Jones
remembered nothing about the night of the crash.
<p>
   Rees-Jones said he had experienced flashbacks in the past week
to incidents before and after the accident.
<p>
   ``My psychiatrist calls them windows of memory, they are small
and don't last very long,'' he told The Mirror. ``To start with I
couldn't remember a thing, and doctors weren't sure if I would ever
remember. I had amnesia, everything was just a blank.''
<p>
   The Sunday Telegraph reported that the interview had been
arranged by Mohamed al Fayed, who gave an interview to the same
newspaper on Feb. 12 saying that he was ``99.9 percent certain''
the crash was part of a conspiracy.
<p>
   Al Fayed, who owns the Harrods department store in London and
the Ritz Hotel in Paris, has been criticized in Britain for his
claims. He has so far offered no independent evidence to support
them. After Diana's death, al Fayed said he had passed on Diana's
last words to her close relatives, something her family have
denied.

Serb police retaliate after clash with Albanian militants
Eds: Recaps previous
By IBRAHIM OSMANI
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Following an unprecedented day of
ethnic violence, the leader of the Albanian majority in the Kosovo
province has appealed to the United States and the European Union
to pressure Serbia to stop what he called police brutality.
<p>
   ``Urgent measures'' are needed to prevent the Serb attacks
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova said Sunday.
<p>
   Serbian police searched houses and seized weapons in Albanian
villages on Sunday, ethnic Albanian officials said, a day after
clashes killed at least 20 people.
<p>
   The latest fighting has heightened fear of all-out war in the
province, which borders on Albania and is seeking autonomy from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
<p>
   Saturday's clashes represented the worst single day of violence
since the Kosovo Liberation Army began operating in 1996. The
clandestine ethnic Albanian group has since claimed responsibility
for several terrorist attacks.
<p>
   The United States expressed concern and appealed for restraint
but did not strongly criticize the Serbian authorities, according
to a statement faxed Sunday to The Associated Press from the U.S.
Embassy in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
<p>
   Gunfire and explosions could still be heard Sunday while police
combed the area of the clashes in armored vehicles and helicopters,
ethnic Albanian sources said.
<p>
   Police said they found large quantities of weapons, including
hand grenades, mortar shells and explosives.
<p>
   Another prominent Kosovo Albanian politician, Fehmi Agani,
visited the site and said large numbers of Serbian police forces
appeared to be creating an ``atmosphere of war.''
<p>
   A Serbian police statement carried by Tanjug news agency Sunday
said police on regular duty were ambushed Saturday with hand
grenades, automatic weapons and mortars near Glogovac, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Four
policemen were killed and two seriously wounded.
<p>
   Police then killed 16 ``terrorists'' and arrested five in
response to the attacks, the statement said.
<p>
   But a statement from the ethnic Albanians's self-styled
government said Serbian police and paramilitary forces had attacked
unarmed Albanian civilians, including women and children, in
several villages.
<p>
   ``Dead bodies could be seen lying everywhere, along the streets,
on gardens, yards and fields,'' it said. ``Huge Serbian forces
supported by armored and other military vehicles'' continued the
operation on Sunday.
<p>
   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanians. Tension has been high in Kosovo since Serbia revoked the
province's autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989,
deploying heavy police and army reinforcements.
<p>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic expressed condolences to
the families of policemen killed Saturday, praising their
``courage, patriotism and sacrifice,'' Tanjug reported.

Dollar falls, stocks rise in morning trading
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in Monday
morning trading while Japanese stocks rose amid renewed signs the
government may take long-awaited steps to boost the economy.
<p>
   The dollar bought 125.93 yen in late morning trading, down 0.79
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 126.10 yen on Friday.
<p>
   Investors sold their dollars for yen following a series of news
reports suggesting lawmakers are putting together additional fiscal
stimulus measures.
<p>
   On Monday, the Mainichi newspaper said the government will
release a new stimulus package prior to a summit meeting of the
Group of Seven industrial nations in May.
<p>
   The newspaper said the upcoming package will center on increased
spending on public works to buoy the economy.
<p>
   Also Monday, the Nihon Keizai business daily quoted a top
lawmaker as calling for spending public works money earmarked for
next year's budget  &MD;  which begins April 1  &MD;  ahead of time in order
to kick-start growth.
<p>
   Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
Policy Affairs Research Council, was also quoted as supporting
using the nation's enormous postal savings system to prop up the
stock market.
<p>
   A rebound by the Japanese stock market and economy would
increase demand for yen as investors switch into the currency in
pursuit of increased profit opportunities.
<p>
   The yen has come under selling pressure in recent weeks over
worries Japan would not do enough to end seven years of economic
sluggishness.
<p>
   The reports of impending economic stimulus also cheered stock
investors, who bid up equity prices for a fourth straight day.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 294.40
points, or 1.75 percent, to close the morning session at 17,126.07.
On Friday, the average rose 329.97 points, or 2.00 percent.
<p>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section surged 15.23 points, or 1.20 percent, to 1,287.68
points. The TOPIX had closed up 18.52 points, or 1.48 percent, on
Friday.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond traded at 1.660 percent, unchanged from Friday's finish. Its
price was 108.98 yen.

Amnesty: political killings continue in Cambodia

<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Political killings by security forces in Cambodia,
and the government's failure to investigate them, could jeopardize
the country's chances of holding a free-and-fair election, an
international human rights group said Monday.
<p>
   The report, by Amnesty International, also criticized the
forthcoming trial in absentia of Cambodia's exiled former first
prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
<p>
   ``Unless action is taken to protect human rights, elections
scheduled for July will be jeopardized and the investment the
international community has made in Cambodia's reconstruction will
be put at risk,'' said Rory Mungoven, director of the London-based
organization's Asia-Pacific Program.
<p>
   ``Whatever the case against Ranariddh, it is clear that in the
present environment he cannot receive a fair trial,'' he said in a
statement. The trial is scheduled to begin this week in Cambodia.
<p>
   Reacting to the report in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, a
government official said such crimes are always investigated.
<p>
   ``The government has never said that the investigations into
extrajudical killings or other acts of political violence are
closed. The issue continues. But at this critical moment the most
important thing is to concentrate on the future, the coming
election. Now the government is doing everything possible to make
the coming election free and fair,'' Khieu Kanharith, the
Information Ministry's secretary of state, said in an interview.
<p>
   ``After the election, the investigations will continue. Nobody
said these cases were closed, no one,'' said Khieu Kanharith, also
a member of the Cambodian People's Party steering committee.
<p>
   In a violent coup d'etat last July, Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
ousted Ranariddh, who had won the U.N.-supervised 1993 election.
<p>
   Ranariddh, now in exile, has been charged by a Hun

Nearly 50 killed in road accident in central Vietnam
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  Nearly 50 people were killed and 20
injured when an overcrowded bus plunged into a swamp in one of
Vietnam's worst road accidents, local officials said Monday.
<p>
   The bus was trying to pass a cement truck when it crashed
through the concrete sides of a bridge and fell into the 6-meter-
(20-foot-) deep swamp around noon Sunday, said Nguyen Vi Thanh,
deputy director of An Nhon district hospital in the central coastal
province of Binh Dinh.
<p>
   Survivors smashed windows to swim to safety, while the rest of
the passengers drowned, he said.
<p>
   Fifteen passengers were being treated at the district hospital,
while five others with more serious injuries were taken to the
provincial hospital, Thanh said. The other survivors were given
shelter at the village and district Red Cross offices.
<p>
   No bodies have been recovered yet. A crane that was sent to
pluck the bus from the swamp tried for 6 1/2 hours before it also
fell in. More cranes were being called in Monday morning.
<p>
   Thanh said the 86-seat bus, from the northern province of Thanh
Hoa, was carrying some 100 migrant workers and their relatives to
the southern provinces.
<p>
   Thanh said the 40-year-old driver, who broke his leg, will be
detained for questioning.

   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Vote counting began Monday for
protracted Indian parliamentary elections with a right-wing Hindu
nationalist party expected to lead the race but failing to win a
clear majority.
<p>
   With opinion surveys showing a hung Parliament emerging from the
second elections in less than two years, the major blocs began
holding strategy sessions to work out alliances.
<p>
   Counting was underway in 1,400 centers in 870 towns across
India. The Election Commission was still making arrangements for
counting in six voting districts in Bihar state, the worst hit by
election-related violence.
<p>
   In all, 543 seats are at stake; the two remaining are filled by
appointment.
<p>
   Top leaders of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party,
which is expected to win the most seats, met over the weekend and
announced that the party would begin talks with potential allies on
Wednesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, leaders of parties opposed to the BJP met informally
on Sunday to discuss the likelihood of cobbling together an
alliance like the 14-party coalition ousted in December.

Three Shiite Muslims ambushed in eastern Punjab
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  &MD;  Three Shiite Muslims were gunned down
in Pakistan's Punjab province in the latest round of religiously
motivated violence sweeping the country, according to news reports
Monday.
<p>
   Two leaders of a militant Shiite group and their bodyguard were
ambushed on Sunday night near Jhang, about 200 kilometers (120
miles) southwest of the federal capital of Islamabad, the
English-language newspaper, The News, said.
<p>
   Safdar Ali Sial and Amjad Ali Sial were ambushed while driving
on a narrow country road on the outskirts of Jhang.
<p>
   Gunmen drove up beside them and opened fire, killing all three.
The lone survivor, their driver, was taken to hospital where he was
reportedly in serious condition.
<p>
   The victims all belonged to the Tehrik-e-Jafria, or Movement for
Shiite Law. The group often clashes with militant Sunni groups,
particularly the Sipah-e-Sahabah, or Guardians of the Friends of
the Prophet, which is headquartered in Jhang.
<p>
   Although no one has taken responsibility for the killings,
police officials say they believe it was religiously motivated.
<p>
   Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab, home to 60 percent
of the country's 140 million people, has been the scene of much of
the religious violence that has wracked this country in recent
years.
<p>
   In the last year more than 300 people have been killed in
sectarian killings with militant Sunni Muslims pitted against their
Shiite Muslim brethren.
<p>
   Religious and political leaders in Pakistan have condemned the
killings and while most Pakistanis are Sunni Muslims, they bear no
grudge against the Shiite Muslim minority.
<p>
   However, several militant groups belonging to both sects have
sprung up in Pakistan. Police say they are well armed and well
organized.

Study: No link between cancer and electric power lines
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  A study released Monday which was
commissioned by Australia's electric power industry found no
scientific evidence that overhead power lines cause cancer.
<p>
   The 18-month study, funded by the Electricity Supply Association
of Australia and undertaken by scientists around Australia, showed
no evidence linking lymphoma -- cancer of the white blood cells --
with overhead power lines.
<p>
   Professor Tony Basten, executive director of Sydney's Centenary
Institute of Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology at the Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital, said the study exposed hundreds of mice carrying a
gene which caused lymphoma to electromagnetic fields for 20 hours a
day for 18 months.
<p>
   ``The highest dose exceeded exposure levels below high voltage
power lines by a factor of 100,'' Basten said.
<p>
   ``There was no difference in the lymphoma rate between the
exposed mice and non-exposed mice,'' he said.
<p>
   ``The negative finding supports other carefully conducted
studies and really should give greater peace of mind to the many
thousands of people who live near or under power lines,'' Basten
said.
<p>
   Basten insisted the study was independent despite being funded
by the electric power industry association.
<p>
   A study undertaken last year by the same group which looked into
the connection between lymphoma and radio frequency fields emitted
by digital mobile phones found there was a doubling in the
incidence of cancer, he said.
<p>
   Basten said now that the latest study has been completed it is
time to find the ``real killer'' causing greater incidence of
cancer.
<p>
   ``The real killer is still out there. We know that forms of
cancer are due to genetic abnormality, so our next priority is to
find the real killer,'' he said.

Satan scores three goals for Sabres, as Hasek shuts out Capitals
By The Associated Press
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Miroslav Satan broke a scoring drought with
three goals and Dominik Hasek made 36 saves for his eighth shutout
this season, helping the Buffalo Sabres extend their unbeaten
streak to 12 games with a 3-0 triumph Sunday over the slumping
Washington Capitals.
<p>
   Hasek is tied with Dallas goalie Ed Belfour for the league lead
in shutouts. Buffalo, 6-0-6 in its last 12 games, has the longest
unbeaten streak in the NHL this season.
<p>
   Satan, who hadn't had a goal since Dec. 30, provided all the
offense for the Sabres, who have not lost since dropping a 3-0
decision in Philadelphia on Jan. 20. Since that loss, Buffalo has
outscored its opponents 38-21.
<p>
   The three-goal performance gave Satan a team-high 20 goals for
the season, one more than defenseman Alexei Zhitnik.
<p>
   Washington is winless in six games, going 0-5-1 in that span,
and has lost four straight. The Capitals, who absorbed their fifth
shutout of the season, have dropped four consecutive games at MCI
Center.
<p>
   For the fourth straight game, Washington fell behind by two
goals. This time, they couldn't recover against Hasek, who led the
Czech Republic to the gold meal in the Nagano Olympics. &QL; 
 &UR; Blackhawks 2, Stars 2 &QC; 
<p>
   In Chicago, Eric Daze and Greg Johnson of the Blackhawks took
advantage of Dallas' overly aggressive play to score on 5-on-3
power plays.
<p>
   Pat Verbeek and Benoit Hogue scored for Dallas, which had its
five-game winning streak snapped but still pushed its NHL-leading
point total to 85.
<p>
   The tie completed a successful weekend against the Western
Conference's best teams for the Blackhawks, who won 4-0 at Colorado
on Saturday. Chicago had lost its first three games against Dallas
this season by a combined 12-1.
<p>
   Chicago's Jeff Hackett stopped 24 shots, but needed help from
defenseman Eric Weinrich, who made a stick save on Jamie
Langenbrunner's shot from the slot with 14 1/2 minutes left in
regulation.
<p>
   Roman Turek made 18 saves for the Stars, keeping the game tied
by robbing Daze at the end of a 2-on-1 break in the third period.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Islanders 4 &QC; 
<p>
   In Uniondale, New York, Steve Heinze and Tim Taylor scored goals
38 seconds apart early in the third period to snap a tie and give
Boston the victory.
<p>
   Taylor had two goals for Boston, which stretched its unbeaten
streak to three games (2-0-1). Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov
also tallied for the Bruins, who won only their second game on Long
Island in their last eight tries (2-4-2). Byron Dafoe stopped 24
shots for his career-high 20th victory.
<p>
   Three of New York's scores were power play goals, as Zigmund
Palffy scored twice, and Kenny Jonsson once. Trevor Linden scored
his first goal for the Islanders as well.
<p>
   Tommy Salo started in goal for New York and stopped just 14
shots before being replaced by Wade Flaherty, who added six saves.

   In Anaheim, California, Brett Hull, facing Anaheim for the first
time since Tomas Sandstrom broke his left hand in a slashing
incident, had two goals and two assists to power the St. Louis
Blues over the Mighty Ducks.
<p>
   Pierre Turgeon also had two goals and two assists en route to
the Blues' sixth victory in eight games and first in their last
five meetings with the Ducks.
<p>
   Matt Cullen and Scott Young scored for the Ducks, who played
their third consecutive game without NHL goal-scoring leader Teemu
Selanne and will continue to miss Paul Kariya for an indefinite
period because of post-concussion syndrome.
<p>
   Sandstrom's slash of Hull's hand cost him 13 games  &MD;  in addition
to the All-Star Game.

Australian troops to stay in Gulf until U.N. satisfied on

With BC-UN-Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Australian troops will stay in Kuwait
until United Nations inspectors visit alleged Iraqi weapons sites,
Prime Minister John Howard said Monday.
<p>
   Howard told Parliament he was pleased U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was able to resolve the impasse peacefully but warned
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could still go back on his word.
<p>
   ``It remains to be seen whether he will be as good as his
word,'' Howard said.
<p>
   ``As far as the Australian government is concerned, it is
appropriate that not only United States, but also Australian forces
remain in the Gulf, while the commitments of the Iraqis are fully
tested.''
<p>
   Australia has committed a contingent of some 250 military
personnel, including elite commandos, to the U.S.-led strike force
that has been positioned in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Dozens of riot police were deployed
when about 600 college students staged a noisy but peaceful protest
against the government Monday.
<p>
   The students held a rally on the campus of the University of
Indonesia just as former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale was
scheduled to arrive in Jakarta for talks with President Suharto
over Indonesia's deepening economic crisis.
<p>
   Police, carrying sticks and shields, stood at the gates of the
campus as heavy rain fell and the demonstration broke up.
<p>
   No arrests were made despite an official ban on mass gatherings
in the capital this month to safeguard a special sitting of an
assembly expected to elect Suharto next week to a seventh five-year
term.
<p>
   Mondale, who will be acting as a special envoy of President Bill
Clinton, is expected to urge Suharto to stick with sweeping reforms
made under a dlrs 43 billion International Monetary Fund package.
<p>
   In a speech to the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly
on Sunday, Suharto complained that austerity measures and sweeping
economic reforms prescribed by the IMF have not produced any
improvement in the battered economy. Suharto said more measures had
to be devised.
<p>
   In recent weeks more than 20 towns in Indonesia have been rocked
by rioting and violent protest over rising inflation and mass
unemployment.
<p>
   Tuesday's peaceful demonstration was the third to be staged by
students in six days.
<p>
   ``The students demand that the government be more serious in its
handling of the economic crisis,'' said a protest organizer, who
identified himself by the single name of Banani.
