 &UR; High-Speed Data Network Fails &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp.'s nationwide high-speed data network crashed Monday
afternoon, sending banks and stores and other users scrambling to
switch on backup systems. Most managed the changeover with minor
disruption; others said the failure of the ``frame relay'' network,
which continued Monday night, was causing major hardships.
<p>
   The American Red Cross, which uses the network to track more than
half of the nation's blood supply, experienced significant slowdowns.
A backup data system was designed only for regional outages, according
to Greg Hamil, senior director of wide-area networking and computer
operations.
<p>
   ``We did not anticipate our entire frame network being down. We are
operating at a significantly degraded mode,'' Hamil said. ``It's
making me very nervous. We're going to have a serious talk with
AT&AMP;T.''
<p>
   The failure underlined a risk of the emerging information age: that
as society becomes ever more linked by low-cost communications
systems, it also grows more vulnerable when they fail.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T officials could not explain the shutdown, which occurred
around 3 p.m. and had not been fixed as of Monday evening. AT&AMP;T data
networks other than frame relay were not affected. ``We are working
aggressively to identify, isolate and fix the problem,'' said AT&AMP;T
spokeswoman Ruth Lynn Newell. ``And we are currently contacting all of
our frame-relay customers to advise them of the difficulty.''
<p>
   Kim Kellogg, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco,
said half of the company's 1,070 bank branches in California were left
without working cash machines, phones or computer terminals. However,
the bank continued to do business. ``We're servicing customers
inside,'' Kellogg said. `` ... It just slows things down.''
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's frame-relay service customers include Fortune 500 companies,
many government agencies and large institutions, and Internet service
providers. Frame relay is a fairly new technology that has quickly
grown into a $2 billion-a-year market, according to the Boston-based
Yankee Group consulting firm.
<p>
   Newell denied the problem was comparable to a nine-hour outage that
AT&AMP;T's long-distance network suffered in 1990, disrupting voice
service coast-to-coast for millions of callers.
<p>
   The company's current problem ``is not nearly on that scale,'' she
said. ``This is not the AT&AMP;T network. The AT&AMP;T network is operating
normally. It's a subset of our data networking capabilities.''

 &UR; A Clinton Promise on Debt &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
<p>
   President Clinton went to Africa expecting to talk about the
benefits of increased trade. He found leaders who wanted to talk about
the urgent need for debt relief. And no wonder: For many of the
poorest nations of Africa (and Latin America), nothing matters more.
Many of them are struggling under a burden of debt so crushing that
the aid and trade income they receive simply gets recycled back north
in the form of interest payments. Meanwhile, little is left to pay for
health, education and other programs that could begin to relieve
poverty.
<p>
   Two years ago the major creditor nations, including the United
States, acknowledged the foolishness of this debt-service carousel.
Together with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they
shaped the first comprehensive program of debt relief for countries
that were pursuing reasonable policies likely to produce economic
growth. Their plan was hailed as a major breakthrough for developing
nations.
<p>
   In practice, results have been modest. Only six countries have been
approved for debt relief (four in Africa and two in South America),
and only three will actually receive any assistance by the end of this
year. Many more countries that badly need help won't be eligible,
under the plan's stringent criteria, for years to come.
<p>
   These criteria include a record of six unbroken years of good
economic performance. The impulse behind this condition is right;
there's no point extending aid to regimes that will squander it. But
inflexibly making every country wait so long risks missing an
opportunity to help countries that really want to help themselves;
many governments dedicated to poverty reduction and economic growth
simply won't survive six years without debt relief.
<p>
   Oxfam International, one of the advocacy groups that has led the
fight for debt relief, notes that the international community quickly
mobilized more than $100 billion in credit to ease Asia's financial
crisis, but in Africa  &MD;  where the per-country needs often run in the
hundreds of millions  &MD;  the political will is missing. Mr. Clinton said
he had promised South African President Nelson Mandela and other
African leaders to ``see what I could do to make sure that we give as
much aid as we possibly can'' and ``to stay on top of this'' once he
returned to Washington. This week, with the world's finance ministers
in town for the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF, would be a
good time to begin redeeming that promise.

 &UR; Discovery's Adventure Race &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   It's not just a game, it's an adventure  &MD;  one where only the
world's most elite endurance athletes dare to compete.
<p>
   An international race that pushes teams of three men and one woman
to the physical and mental breaking point, the Discovery Channel
Eco-Challenge, returning to television Sunday, tires you out just
watching.
<p>
   This year's Eco-Challenge, completed in October in North
Queensland, Australia, airs over three nights (Sunday and Monday at 9,
Tuesday at 10) on the cable channel, and is rife with blood, sweat and
tears. The race takes place in a different country annually, but this
one is filled with biting spiders, hungry crocodiles, stinging plants
and, for 10 days, moving, sleep-deprived humans.
<p>
   All can be obstacles to the finish line of the Eco-Challenge, which
is gaining in popularity, said race director Mark Burnett, a Londoner
who immigrated to the United States in 1982. ``It's one of the few
major sporting events where the winner isn't the focus. It's not all
about winning,'' he said. ``It's about the experience. And so few
sports do that.''
<p>
   Burnett started the Eco-Challenge in 1992. In that one, in
Madagascar, he finished in the fastest American team.
<p>
   ``I also have failed to finish,'' he said. ``I know a lot from
being the most successful  &MD;  and not successful.''
<p>
   Burnett chooses the country for each year's race and maps a course,
then times it. He also charts rescue routes from all points.
<p>
   ``There's nothing on the course that's not done by us,'' said
Burnett.
<p>
   This year's event is 335 miles. Forty-eight teams begin with a
59-mile bushwalk. Then there's a 26-mile river canoe, a 30-mile
canyon-rim trek (with rappel), a 112-mile mountain bike, a 12-mile
whitewater raft, a 26-mile rain-forest trek, a 21-mile horseback ride
and a 49-mile sea kayak.
<p>
   There are 31 mandatory check-in points where passports must be
stamped. All food (except one hot meal) must be carried, and mandatory
safety gear, such as helmets and first-aid kits, must accompany the
teams over the finish line, which will take the winners fewer than six
days to reach. Teams are disqualified if they don't finish within 10
days.
<p>
   Sleep is sacrificed  &MD;  ``You can't have a reserve of it,'' said
Burnett  &MD;  and some people handle fatigue better than others.
<p>
   Discovery's five-hour miniseries is edited from 500 hours of film,
he said. ``We chose many more teams to focus on than you see on
television. Then when we come back we look at what happens. Some have
more interest than others.''
<p>
   This year's notables include the Japanese, an unfortunate team from
Northern Ireland and U.S. Navy SEALs.
<p>
   Despite the fact that the majority of entrants are American, a
number that Burnett now limits, he believes their emphasis on winning
``is why we don't see American teams do that well.''
<p>
   The key to enduring this race, Burnett insisted, is that 85 percent
depends on the team dynamic. The rest is physical.
<p>
   ``Helping each other is the attitude that helps win,'' he said.
``I'm hoping that Eco-Challenge-type behavior will spill over into
realms outside of sports.''
<p>
   Win or lose, it's when things go wrong that the Eco-Challenge gets
interesting. For example, despite Burnett's scrutinized screening of
applicants, a yearlong newsletter filled with warnings, plus the
teams' own rigorous training, he finds that teams will still ``hear
what they want to.'' And that means that some show up unprepared.
<p>
   Take this year's contestants from Northern Ireland, who quickly
discover that their backpacks are too heavy, with a cheeseboard, a
Walkman and sleeping bags. (Most teams wouldn't dream of lugging
sleeping bags, let alone housewares.)
<p>
   ``The Northern Ireland team was a mountain rescue team. These are
great athletes and good back-country people,'' said Burnett. Still, he
added, ``No matter how much we tell people, they have to experience
the first year to get it.''
<p>
   Indeed, despite the bruising course, every competitor has applied
to return.
<p>
   ``This is such an attractive thing for people,'' he said. ``There's
a shift towards nature-based things: (the Eco-Challenge) is totally
out of your control. So people are looking for something totally
uncontrollable.''
<p>
   Burnett foresees a time when each country stages its own race, then
enters one team. That way the race would become a kind of olympics for
the millennium, he said.
<p>
   In the next event, in Morocco, there will be 30 countries
represented, including India, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   ``We're so happy about the way this thing has grown,'' he said.
<p>
   It's not just physical prowess that will get a team accepted. ``It
really is trying to find a diversely experienced team that's going to
get along,'' Burnett emphasized.
<p>
   For example, late into this year's race, the Navy SEAL team faces a
crisis. But Burnett praised the team leader for being so calm. ``He's
a professional. That's the kind of people we're looking for. ... But
still, we can't protect people from themselves.''
<p>
   And without rest, humans become unpredictable.
<p>
   Also unpredictable is Mother Nature.
<p>
   ``In British Columbia there was an enormous storm,'' he recalled.
``In Australia, an ocean storm. In Morocco, I guess we'll have a
sandstorm.''
<p>
   Web-watchers can follow the race in Morocco from Oct. 6 to 16 on
www.discovery.com.

 &UR; The Heartfelt Soul of `Ally McBeal' &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; I've been down this road walkin' the line
<p>
    &UR; That's painted by pride
<p>
    &UR; And I have made mistakes in my life
<p>
    &UR; That I just can't hide.
<p>
    &UR; Oh I believe I am ready for what love has to bring
<p>
    &UR; Got myself together, now I'm ready to sing.
<p>
    &MD;  Vonda Shepard, ``Searchin' My Soul''
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   She's the striking blond piano player in the trendy yuppie bar
frequented on-camera by ``Ally McBeal's'' off-the-wall cast. She's the
soulful vocalist whose words parallel the thoughts of the title
character  &MD;  who in turn represents the working woman of the '90s.
<p>
   She's also the non-television watcher whose video will be played
for about 10 million Fox viewers before ``Ally McBeal's'' closing
credits on May 4. The following day, the show soundtrack  &MD;  for which
Sony paid a reported $3 million rights fee  &MD;  hits stores.
<p>
   Not bad for a 34-year-old musician who a year ago lugged her
keyboard through a New York City rain to play before a crowd of 35
people.
<p>
   Bygones.
<p>
   Although it took 20 years for her to achieve this ``sudden''
acclaim, Vonda Shepard's soul contains no animosity or bitterness.
<p>
   Hey, she's been here before. Shepard traveled the world as a band
member for Rickie Lee Jones, Al Jarreau and Jackson Browne. She hit
No. 6 on the pop charts with ``Can't We Try, '' a duet with Dan Hill
in 1987. She borrowed nearly $100,000 from friends, family and former
boyfriends to produce her third album, ``It's Good, Eve,'' in 1996.
<p>
   ``It's been a long road,'' said Shepard, 34. ``I've only wanted to
reach the public. I've just been given this opportunity of exposure.''
<p>
   She has no complaints about the 12- to 14-hour days on the set of
the Monday night Fox series, nor of the all-night recording sessions
to finish the soundtrack. And certainly no qualms about a two-month
summer tour that includes a New York City show at the 1,000-seat
Irving Plaza. (``Hopefully people will show this time,'' she joked.)
<p>
   She also has a fourth solo album in the works for next year.
<p>
   ``Everything is better,'' she said. ``I'm working every single day
and not sitting at home with all this energy, saying, `What happened?'
My father told me when I was younger that a spiritual leader said work
is good for the soul, and I totally believe that.''
<p>
    &UR; I've been searching my soul tonight
<p>
    &UR; I know there's so much more to life
<p>
    &UR; Now I know I can shine a light
<p>
    &UR; To find my way back home
<p>
   The light at the end of the tunnel for Vonda Shepard came courtesy
of David E. Kelley, who attended her show about the time he was
creating ``Ally McBeal.''
<p>
   In Shepard  &MD;  a longtime friend of Kelley's wife Michelle Pfeiffer,
who had the same voice coach  &MD;  the television producer found an
on-camera lounge singer whose original and cover songs give voice to
the conscious and subconscious thoughts of insecure young lawyer Ally
McBeal.
<p>
   Kelley also found the show's theme song, ``Searchin' My Soul,'' on
the lead track of Shepard's 1992 album ``The Radical Light,'' which
sold fewer than 6,000 copies.
<p>
   ``It's just a timing issue,'' Shepard said. ``Right now, obviously,
my music fits perfectly with what's happening. It just shows that if
you stay true to what you do, it's going to come around eventually.''
<p>
   Though she has written a few songs since the show started taping,
only the instrumental interludes are written expressly for the show.
``I just write what I write for my own personal albums, and David
picks what he wants,'' she said.
<p>
   So far, Kelley has used about a dozen Shepard songs from the 64 she
has submitted.
<p>
   The irony of the success is not lost on her. She has escaped bar
gigs through this very public bar gig. She has gained attention for
her original songs by doing other composers' songs for the first time.
And she has done it all on television, which she doesn't watch.
<p>
   ``I don't watch it at all,'' she admitted. ``I'm probably missing
some good stuff. I've seen only four `Seinfeld' episodes, and I'm
going to watch all the re-runs for the next nine years. I'm just not a
sitcom person, and dramas are too heavy for me.''
<p>
   Instead, she spends her time writing in a journal for an hour a
day, and up to five hours composing.
<p>
   ``It really starts with a feeling inside; it's almost visceral,''
she said of her songwriting, which tends toward introspective folk
rock. ``I can tell when I'm inspired, and even before I touch the
piano I turn on the tape recorder because I know something good is on
the horizon. Usually, in those moments of great inspiration, it comes
out as a melody and then sometimes gibberish or actual words. ...
<p>
   ``I think of it as letting go of the controlling part of the brain
and letting the subconscious take over.''

 &UR; There's a Theme Here &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   David E. Kelley's initial choice for the ``Ally McBeal'' theme song
was ``Tell Him,'' a '60s pop tune by the Exciters. He settled on Vonda
Shepard's ``Searchin' My Soul.''
<p>
   Conversely, on a recent episode, neurotic lawyer Ally McBeal,
played by Calista Flockhart, first chose ``Searchin' My Soul'' as her
personal theme. She ended up with ``Tell Him'' after her therapist,
guest star Tracey Ullman, vetoed ``Searchin' '' with a succinct
review: ``Bad song. Stinks!''
<p>
   ``I just cracked up,'' recalled Shepard of the Monday lunch-time
screening with Kelley and the actors. ``David's not afraid to make fun
of everybody, including his cast.''
<p>
   Such internal plot twists are enjoyable for Shepard, who needn't
worry about what Kelley really thinks of her songs. He reportedly
blares her CDs while writing the offbeat scripts.
<p>
   And the personal theme for the woman who supplies the beat for Ally
McBeal?
<p>
   ``I'm always writing in my head,'' she said after a moment. ``My
theme song is whatever is inspiring me at the time with whatever I'm
writing. Isn't that narcissistic? Only my own songs!''
<p>
   After more thought, and no doubt energized by a morning cup of
coffee after an all-night recording session, she finally belted out a
refrain: ``Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy. ... ''
<p>
   ``That's a nice corny one,'' she said with a hearty laugh.
``They'll probably use that one on `Ally McBeal' soon.''

 &UR; Ask the Fearless Traveler &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Q: We are planning a trip to Senegal for our honeymoon. Can you
suggest places for us to stay and visit? We want to spend some time in
Cap Skirring and the Casamance area.
<p>
    &MD;  Fatimah Mateen, Alexandria, Va.
<p>
   A. Senegal is the travel destination du jour. President Clinton's
recent visit there has helped spotlight this West African country, one
of the region's most economically developed and politically tolerant
nations. Plus it's an easy seven-hour nonstop flight from New York, it
has beautiful beaches and its history as a key debarkation point in
the slave trade has made it a popular destination for
African-Americans researching their heritage.
<p>
   But Senegal is not without problems. An episodic, 15-year-old
rebellion in the Casamance region flares up occasionally, and since
August, several hundred have been reported killed and Amnesty
International has criticized the government, citing human rights
violations. Senegal remains generally safe for tourists, however,
except for certain areas within the Casamance region. The State
Department has issued no travel warnings for Senegal, but it does urge
U.S. citizens traveling to the Casamance region to contact the U.S.
Embassy in Dakar for the latest travel and security information. Cap
Skirring, a tourist village in the Casamance region, has remained
largely insulated from the internal strife.
<p>
   If you're interested in a resort vacation, Cap Skirring is home to
a Club Med and the beachfront Savanna Hotel. If you'd rather avoid
Casamance altogether, an alternative is Mbour, about a 90-minute drive
south of Dakar. Beachfront resorts there include the Novotel Saly and
the Hotel Royam. To book hotels in Senegal, go through a travel agent.
Agents that specialize in West Africa include Haggins International
Tours, 212-563-2570, and Boston-based Spector Travel at
1-800-879-2374.
<p>
   These agents can also book a heritage tour or an outside adventure
tour. A week-long group trip generally runs about $1,300 per person,
including air fare from New York, some meals, accommodations,
transportation and guide.
<p>
   Q. My husband and I are planning a trip to celebrate our fifth
anniversary. He likes cool climates and skiing; I prefer warm climates
and the beach. We would have about a week and could travel anywhere.
Any suggestions?
<p>
    &MD;  Marianne La Rocco, Harrisonburg, Va.
<p>
   A. When we lived in San Diego, we used to take delight in calling
relatives back east to tell them we had hit the beach in the morning
and the ski slopes that afternoon. Because California is such a
vertical state, it's possible to sit on the beach and throw snowballs
on the same day. But to enjoy optimal conditions, you'll have to
travel from one end of the state to the other to do both.
<p>
   Depending on how ambitious you are, you can either hit Lake Tahoe
for skiing and then go down to Palm Springs, or you can go to several
ski resorts in the Sierras, stop in Palm Springs and then head to the
San Diego beaches. With only a week, I'd keep it simple.
<p>
   Reno is the best airport to fly into. From there, it's an easy
drive to Lake Tahoe, where the ski season often goes until mid-April.
There are lots of hotels in South Lake Tahoe, most of which offer ski
packages. I liked the Best Western Station House Inn (1-800-822-5953),
a reasonably priced, centrally located hotel. While your husband skis
Heavenly, you can hit the casinos or take a lake cruise. Information:
1-800-288-2463 (1-800-AT-TAHOE), http://www.virtualtahoe.com.
<p>
   From there, head to Palm Springs. It's a 500-mile drive from Tahoe
to Palm Springs, so flying is a better option. Because flying directly
into Palm Springs is expensive (about $230 round trip), you can take
Southwest Airlines' shuttle from Reno to Ontario, about 60 miles west
of Palm Springs; round-trip fare is about $120. Palm Springs is a land
of championship golf courses, swimming pools and shopping.
Information: Palm Spring Desert Resorts Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau,
1-800-417-3529 (1-800-41-RELAX), http://www.desert-resorts.com.
<p>
   If you just have to see the Pacific, you can take a side trip to
San Diego, about 150 miles west of Palm Springs. With ocean
temperatures not much above 60, swimming may not be comfortable, but
the air will be a delightful 70 degrees or so. Stay at the La Jolla
Beach and Tennis Club (619-454-7126) and eat at least one meal at its
oceanfront restaurant. Shop on La Jolla's Prospect Street, watch the
Padres play ball at Qualcomm Stadium, and take boardwalk hikes at
Mission Beach.

   AmeriSpan, a Philadelphia-based operator of Spanish-immersion
programs around the world, is doing its best to deal with U.S.
travelers' fears about Guatemala, newly ripe since five U.S. college
students were raped at gunpoint in January. But since the ``good''
news is that police now escort tourists to popular destinations  &MD;  and
that among AmeriSpan's tips you'll find the alarming tidbit ``Make
sure you trust your tour guide or shuttle bus driver''  &MD;  it's clear
that Guatemala, while awakened to its security problems, remains a
destination for the braver travelers among us.

 &UR; 10 N.Y. Hotels That Won't Bust a Budget &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The most interesting new trend in New York hotels is the
mainstreaming of low-budget establishments. No longer is the penurious
traveler relegated to roach hotels in dodgy neighborhoods; ``cheap''
lodgings  &MD;  costing no more than $125 per night, slightly more than
half of the city's $200 per-day average (before the 13.25 percent
occupancy tax and $2 occupancy fee are tacked on)  &MD;  can be clean,
comfortable, secure and, occasionally, stylish.
<p>
   All of our favorites offer rooms with private baths and (in almost
all cases) color televisions and telephones. They're located in great
neighborhoods.
<p>
   But be warned: Our picks offer terrific value in one of the
nation's most expensive cities, but they are still tourist-class
establishments. A few toss in an upmarket amenity  &MD;  a VCR perhaps, or
an in-room CD player. But for the most part, you should count on
bringing your own hair dryer, alarm clock, bathrobe and shampoo.
<p>
   Pack lightly, as you may have to schlep your bags up stairs. If you
drive, staying at these places means no on-site parking. For air
conditioning, expect window units. Your room will be small. The view
likely will be uninspiring. You can usually forget about attentive,
personal service. Harried desk clerks are juggling too many other
tasks to check you in or out smoothly.
<p>
   And perhaps most important: Plan ahead. These places book up fast.
<p>
   All that said, you get a bed for a night in New York for a fee that
won't tap out your credit card. And this is one case where you do get
more than you pay for.
<p>
   Amsterdam Court Hotel (Midtown/Theater District)
<p>
   This elegant 110-room hotel is slightly at odds with its setting
next to the Peepland/Bare Elegance Topless Bar &AMP; Lounge. Rooms are
spare, stark and minimalist, all beige and black with tubular
furniture (open shelves serve as a bureau). Bathrooms are sleek, white
and functional. Perks: in-room CD players and hair dryers. Continental
breakfast included, but it's much more fun to walk a block over to
51st Street to Ellen's Stardust Diner and tuck into a real repast.
<p>
   226 W. 50th St. between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, (212) 459-1000.
Rates normally are $135 to $145, but Quikbook (1-800-789-9887) often
has doubles for $125. Overnight parking: $12 to $17 in numerous lots
between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.
<p>
   Beacon Hotel (Upper West Side)
<p>
   With such gourmet markets as Zabar's and Fairway as neighbors, the
best thing about this 200-room, 35-floor hotel is that all rooms come
with fully equipped kitchenettes. Otherwise, it's your basic corporate
hotel  &MD;  pleasant, characterless  &MD;  only with tinier rooms. The onetime
apartment hotel (there are still some permanent dwellers) offers
amenities like voice mail, clock radios, coffeemakers and hair dryers.
And elevators. Great neighborhood.
<p>
   2130 Broadway (at 75th Street), (212) 787-1100,
http://www.slsbeaconhotel.com. Weekend rates are $125 (weekdays run
$30 to $40 more). Overnight parking: $20 at 76th Street between
Broadway and Amsterdam.
<p>
   Broadway Inn (Midtown/Theater District)
<p>
   The second-floor lobby is magnificent  &MD;  exposed brick walls,
fireplace (decorative for now), cozy couches, bistro tables. The rest
of the place, though pleasant, doesn't rise to these lofty heights.
The rooms are minuscule but tastefully decorated, and you get warm and
attentive service. The 41-room inn, in a three-story Victorian
brownstone (no elevators), is across from the trendy Paramount Hotel
and the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, currently showing ``Titanic.''
Amenities include clock radios, hair dryers and a continental
breakfast, and JR's Irish Pub next door gives guests a 20 percent
discount.
<p>
   264 W. 46th St. between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, (212) 997-9200,
http://www.broadwayinn.com. Rates are $85 to $135. Overnight parking:
$30 at numerous 46th Street lots.
<p>
   The Carlton Arms (Gramercy Park)
<p>
   In this wacky 54-room hotel, every guest room is an original work
of art. The clientele is as young, hip and adventurous as the
interiors. Among the favorites is the submarine room, with its
``view'' of the Lost City of Atlantis, and the stuffed-animal room,
with plush mammals even clinging to the ceiling. No TVs; there's a
public telephone in the second-floor lobby. No breakfast is included
(though Cafe Loon Loon is next door). Stay more than one night and you
make your own bed.
<p>
   160 E. 25th St. between Third and Lexington avenues, (212)
679-0680, http://www.hotwired.com/gallery/96/04/carlton.html. Prices
range from $62 to $76; some shared baths. Overnight parking: $18 on
Third Street between 24th and 25th streets.
<p>
   The Cosmopolitan (TriBeCa)
<p>
   The entrance  &MD;  a narrow glass door next to a deli  &MD;  is so tacky
you'll mistake the Cosmopolitan for a welfare hotel. But once you're
inside, the sleek blond wood lobby is reassuring. Rooms are cozy, with
white Formica furnishings, armoire, ceiling fan and a desk with
modem-ready phone. The bathroom, with three-foot tub, is tiny.
Fabulous location  &MD;  six steps from IRT express and close to SoHo and
Chinatown  &MD;  as well as all the hot TriBeCa restaurants.
<p>
   95 W. Broadway at Chambers, (212) 566-1900,
http://www.cosmohotel.com. Rates are $89 for a single, $119 for a
double. Overnight parking: $18 weekends on Reade, off of Hudson.
<p>
   The Gershwin (Chelsea)
<p>
   The Gershwin, with its lobby art by such pop icons as Lichtenstein
and Warhol, is so arty, funky and hip that people stay here as much
for the atmosphere as the bargains. Rooms in the 106-room, 13-story
hotel are stylish enough  &MD;  walls painted in pastel green or yellow
with hand-painted murals adding color. The minimalist furnishings are
either Philippe Starck-influenced or the real thing. But the real
scene is in the lobby, which doubles as an art gallery, and leads to
such hotel hideaways as the Red Room, an intimate bar, and the Back
Room, a comedy and music venue. A cafe serves light fare.
<p>
   7 E. 27th St. between Madison and Fifth avenues, (212) 545-8000,
http://www.gershwinhotel.com. Room rates range from $100 to $140.
Overnight parking: 30th between Fifth and Madison.
<p>
   The Malibu (Upper West Side)
<p>
   The Malibu is in the scruffy part of the Upper West Side, but its
proximity to Columbia University is a plus, and midtown, via the IRT,
is only eight minutes away. Ignore first impressions of the cavelike
second-floor lobby because the rooms are actually quite cheery, if
sparsely decorated, with sleek black tubular furniture, high ceilings,
white walls and tropical-themed bedspreads. Perks include a CD player,
clock radio and iron in each room. No elevators.
<p>
   2688 Broadway at 103rd Street, (212) 663-0275 or 1-800-647-2227,
http://www.malibuhotelnyc.com. Rates range from $79 to $129. Overnight
parking: $19 on 102nd Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam.
<p>
   The Park Savoy (Midtown)
<p>
   The nine-story, 75-room Park Savoy is unabashedly budget-minded.
Its own staffers will tell you it's nothing special, except for the
lofty address  &MD;  a block from Central Park South, and an easy walk to
Carnegie Hall and Bergdorf Goodman. You enter through a narrow,
wood-paneled hallway, where a tiny reservations desk is tucked under a
stairwell. Furnishings are in varnished wood. Rooms are often in some
state of disrepair; the cable to the television is unhooked, the
handle to the blinds is missing, you find a hair on your sheets. Hey,
you're in Midtown dirt-cheap. Waddaya expect?
<p>
   158 W. 58th St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues, (212) 245-5755.
Rates are $82.12 to $126.27. Overnight parking: $30, next door.
<p>
   Best Western Seaport Inn (Wall Street)
<p>
   Our only chain pick, this characterless 72-room hotel is a great
value. Located in a renovated 19th-century commercial loft, rooms are
outfitted with mahogany reproductions, TV/VCRs and fridges. Bathrooms
are spacious, complete with fancy soaps and hair dryers. Check out the
lobby's bizarre video fireplace, flanked by built-in bookshelves with
the very latest from Reader's Digest. Attractions: South Street
Seaport, the Fulton Fish Market and Wall Street. Better yet, don your
sneakers and hike across the Brooklyn Bridge.
<p>
   33 Peck Slip (one block south of the Brooklyn Bridge), (212)
766-6600, http://www.bestwestern.com. Weekend rates are $114 to $149.
Overnight parking: $20 at any one of three nearby lots.
<p>
   Washington Square Hotel(Greenwich Village)
<p>
   The Washington Square gets the basics right with precious little
flair. The 170-room hotel is steps away from Washington Square Park,
one of the best in the city for people watching. Rooms are merely
functional, but the rate includes a continental breakfast and use of a
small health club. Its restaurant, C3, is adjacent. The plexiglass
surrounding the front desk is jarring, but the action in the
neighborhood compensates.
<p>
   103 Waverly Pl., between Fifth and Sixth avenues at Washington
Square, 1-800-222-0418, http://www.wshotel.com. Rates are $110 to
$160. Overnight parking: $20 on Waverly Place between MacDougal and
Fifth Avenue.
<p>
   If you like pricier  &MD;  but still reasonable  &MD;  digs, you can find
bargains by using discount reservations services. Quikbook
(1-800-789-9887, http://www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations
Network (1-800-964-6835, http://www.180096hotel.com) both offer a
decent selection of New York hotels with rates under $150.

 &UR; Going Around in Circles &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   You simply must go on the Circle Line, our friends told us. It's
the way to see the city. And now that we've made the three-hour
circuit on the waterways bounding Manhattan, we're wondering how we
missed it for so long.
<p>
   From its 42nd Street pier, the Circle Line heads south down the
Hudson past the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park, then north up the
East River under the Brooklyn Bridge (go ahead, look up!), past Yankee
Stadium, up the Harlem River and then back down the Hudson. Tour
guides  &MD;  ours was the poetic John Keatts  &MD;  spotlight landmarks and
detritus alike.
<p>
   Our favorite part? Had to be when the craft cruised near Lady
Liberty, wind whipping and the air nippy despite the sun. About 50
shivering passengers stood on the bow  &MD;  a huddled mass if there ever
was one.
<p>
   But now we want more. We want to hit the sunset cruise, the jazz
cruise, the brunch cruise. And the Beast, a new Circle Line offering
described over the PA by its overexcited captain, got our blood
moving. Zipping around New York Harbor at 45 mph, the Beast blows by
most of the touristy sites.
<p>
   Bring it on.
<p>
   The three-hour CIRCLE LINE cruises ($22) depart from Pier 83, 12th
Avenue and West 42nd Street. Shorter cruises are offered at both Pier
83 and its location at South Street Seaport. Info: (212) 563-3200,

 &UR; The Cloisters: Good &AMP; Medieval &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Of all the special retreats recommended by friends of ours in New
York City, we were most intrigued by the Cloisters. This medieval art
museum perched on a hillside in upper Manhattan seems as far as one
can get from the bustle of Broadway and Times Square.
<p>
   ``I don't recommend it to just anybody,'' one friend confided,
``because it takes some energy to get there.''
<p>
   The Cloisters is, indeed, far afield, in the middle of Fort Tryon
Park on the banks of the Hudson River. But we found the trek to be
worth it. The building, composed of stones and walls brought from
medieval structures in France and other parts of Europe, has an
unusual mix of calm and grandeur.
<p>
   As if the architecture  &MD;  adorned with angels and priests carved
from stone  &MD;  were not stunning enough, the walls are decorated with
wonderful medieval artifacts and tapestries.
<p>
   Among the most remarkable art works displayed there are the Nine
Heroes Tapestries. Painted about 1385, the oversized wall hangings
memorialize both pagan and Christian heroes. Another favorite of ours
was the Gothic chapel, decorated with spectacular stained glass and
several stone tombs dating from the Middle Ages.
<p>
   Take some time to walk through Fort Tryon Park. Piped-in medieval
music enhances the peaceful ambiance. Occasional lectures and concerts
are held there, particularly on spring and summer weekends.
<p>
   THE CLOISTERS (212-923-3700) is about $15 by cab from Midtown. By
car, take the Henry Hudson Parkway north to the Fort Tryon/Cloisters
exit, one mile north of the George Washington Bridge. By bus, take the
Madison Avenue M4 bus north to the last stop. By subway, take the A
train to 190th Street and walk 10 minutes north, or board the M4 bus
at 190th Street and ride one stop north. Suggested donation: $8.

   The weekend may seem like the quintessential American invention
(being, as it is, the perfect union of leisure, commerce and the
unabashed consumption of fossil fuels), but it's celebrated, in some
form or another, all over the globe.

 &UR; Russians, Returning to the Land (Moscow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  One of the great Moscow vistas is the approach to the city
on broad Kutuzovsky Prospekt, an impossibly wide artery that comes
roaring into the city, flanked on either side by stately old apartment
buildings. There are few sights more breathtaking than the one past
Poklonnaya Gora, the ``Bowing Hills,'' a great strolling park, with
the looming tower of Moscow State University in the background.
<p>
   But on a Friday afternoon in summer, when the air pollution hangs
like a cloud over the avenue, when all of Moscow seems to be gasping
for breath, Kutuzovsky Prospekt becomes the scene of a mammoth exodus.
No matter how wide, it seems incapable of containing the thousands and
thousands of cars  &MD;  laden down with chairs, picnic baskets,
televisions, blankets, children and pets  &MD;  that rush to escape the
metropolis.
<p>
   It is a weekend ritual: heading for the dacha. The word dacha
describes a house in the country, and there is no more typical way for
a Muscovite to spend the weekend than to flee the sweaty apartment
blocks and the headaches of work for the pleasant breezes and
camaraderie of the dacha.
<p>
   You don't have to be rich. A dacha is Everyman's escape. It can be
a small, one-room, wooden shack, sandwiched with a dozen others into a
clearing in the woods. Or maybe several rooms nestled near your own
apple orchard. And if you do have a few million dollars to spare,
there are always the unsightly, brick ``cottegi,'' the elaborate
walled three- and four-story country houses that New Russians are
building with abandon.
<p>
   No matter whether shack or mansion, the dacha routine is the same.
Here's how some of my Russian friends describe it:
<p>
   First, on Friday, there is shopping. Many dachas have primitive gas
stoves, so you want to keep cooking to a minimum. The dacha enthusiast
 &MD;  ``dachnik''  &MD;  looks for picnic food: sausage, vegetables, potatoes.
A big favorite is shashlik  &MD;  grilled marinated meat cooked over a
charcoal fire  &MD;  and many people begin the marinade on Friday morning.
<p>
   Then you have to pack the car. You really can't leave anything
valuable in the dacha during the week, so you have to bring it all: a
television, food, books, perhaps folding chairs, the dog, the kids
(and don't forget the seed packets). The most common Russian car is
the boxy, balky Zhiguli, which was modeled on a Fiat of 30 years ago.
There's not much space.
<p>
   Then you hit the road. What a zoo! The avenues and highways out of
Moscow are bumper-to-bumper for hours on Friday evening.
<p>
   It will probably be dusk when you finally arrive at the dacha, and
everyone is starving. The charcoal fires are lit up quickly and the
smell of shashlik wafts through the birches. There is a tasty late
dinner of seared shashlik, and maybe champagne or vodka. The weekend
has begun.
<p>
   In the thick of summer, the dacha is like a huge gulp of oxygen.
With trees and lush grasses, the climate is crystalline pure, compared
with the poisonous gases of the city. In visiting friends' dachas, I
often feel like it is time for a nap, so intoxicating is the fresh
air.
<p>
   But first there is work. Everyone has a garden plot to care for,
and they do so with gusto. The growing season is short and needs
enormous attention  &MD;  the land has to be tilled by hand, sown and
weeded. Working the land is deep in the Russian soul, even among the
newly rich. One of my friends says, ``Even if you look over the fence
at the fancy new cottegi,' you see they have three stories, bay
windows, Victorian roofs, and  &MD;  just like us  &MD;  they are out tilling
the soil. Potatoes and cabbages.''
<p>
   The garden is a good Saturday morning's work, at least for the
adults, while children dip in the Moscow River or race through the
woods. Then, as the sun gets hot, it's time for that nap, a long one,
and more work in the garden in the late afternoon. And evenings on
Saturday are for strolling, as the entire community roams around,
visiting friends and sharing old times. The adults have been digging
in the soil until their backs ache. And soon it will be Sunday, time
to load up the car and head back into the city on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.

 &UR; Canada on Ice (Toronto) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TORONTO  &MD;  There are two ways to deal with winter in Canada:
<p>
   Stay indoors and complain, in which case you're in for a six-month
deluge of American television, carryout pizza and hockey broadcasts.
<p>
   Or insulate your body as much as possible and do your complaining
outside. Recognizing that frozen toes and fingers are as much a part
of Canada's weekends as cream sauce in Paris or the talk-show circuit
in Washington, my family and I were determined not to be confined by
winter, a season that can last into April.
<p>
   What we learned is what most Canadians understand from the first
time they put on double-bladed skates and stumble around a rink: Cold
is a state of mind, and ice is one of the world's more-versatile
surfaces.
<p>
   You don't even have to go outside to enjoy it. People like ice here
so much they keep lots of it inside.
<p>
   Like at the Royal Canadian Curling Club. Hockey may be Canada's
passion, but in some ways curling is the national sport. Families  &MD; 
whole neighborhoods, even  &MD;  can do it together, and you don't need to
be well-coordinated or fit. As one Canadian commentator said: The
great thing about curling as a sport is that you can smoke while
you're doing it.
<p>
   Not that anyone in my family smokes. But we did kick off a recent
weekend by renting a ``sheet'' at the Royal's downtown Toronto
clubhouse and tossing rocks with our neighbors and their kids.
<p>
   For the uninitiated, curling is like shuffleboard on ice, with
large, rounded granite stones replacing the little ceramic disks.
There are bull's-eyes at either end of a rectangular patch of ice; the
aim is to slide your stone into the target, while dislodging any of
your opponent's.
<p>
   It's not as easy as it sounds. Most of our shots either stopped
pathetically short or went speeding off the far edge, forcing our
neighbors to jump aside or have their toes squished. And that's, of
course, when we weren't picking ourselves up from the ice and
inspecting for broken wrists or worse.
<p>
   Hey. It's slippery out there. And they give you slippery shoes to
make it even worse.
<p>
   That raises another important Canadian weekend topic: footwear.
This is a footwear nation. To take full advantage of winter, it
wouldn't be unusual to own a half-dozen or more sets of specialized
shoes, boots or other foot gear.
<p>
   Slippery curling shoes are only the beginning. On Saturday my son
and daughter and I laced up our skates twice, once for tag and racing
at the rink of a nearby park, the second time to join the
neighborhood's early evening game of ``shinny'' hockey.
<p>
   Shinny on a Saturday night is Canada's version of pick-up baseball
in the vacant lot on a summer evening. The equipment is minimal  &MD;  most
people play without gloves or helmets  &MD;  the conduct polite, and the
teams picked informally by throwing all the hockey sticks into a pile
at center ice, then randomly sorting them into two groups.
<p>
   At least in our neighborhood, there seemed to be room for all ages
and all skill levels  &MD;  from 7 year olds like my son, who are just
learning to skate, to 38 year olds, like myself, who are also just
well, you get the picture.
<p>
   Sunday is ski day; and while Toronto isn't exactly Aspen, it is
surprising how many places there are to pursue the sport nearby. Some
are little more than glorified sledding hills. For real snow, and a
reasonable facsimile of a downhill experience, we travel two hours
north to Collingwood and a cluster of resorts built around the hills
of the Niagara escarpment, near Georgian Bay. Feet jammed into ski
boots (of course), we ski from late morning until late afternoon, my
wife and I tending toward the more-modest slopes, while the kids dart
through the woods and push on to more-challenging terrain.
<p>
   The trips to the lodge are frequent. This is Canada, after all, and
the wind off the bay can be bitter. But they never last long.
<p>
   Who'd want to stay shut inside in such beautiful weather?

 &UR; What Asian Monetary Crisis? (Hong Kong) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG  &MD;  During any given week, this former British possession
might best be described as high-rise hell, a concrete conundrum of
glass and steel and brick, with the territory's 7 million inhabitants
toiling away in tiny cubicles mostly figuring out new ways to make
money. And that, after all, is what drives workaholic Hong Kong  &MD; 
money, or the pursuit of it  &MD;  here in the region's premier financial
center.
<p>
   But come the weekend  &MD;  ah, the glorious weekend  &MD;  and for two days,
Hong Kongers descend from the office towers and hillside apartment
blocks to enjoy the sparse few square feet set aside for leisure and
to think of new ways to spend all that money. Hong Kong becomes a city
transformed, a city in retreat from itself.
<p>
   For much of Hong Kong's expatriate community, the weekend begins
promptly at the close of business Friday. The youngish crowd of
bankers and brokers and those ubiquitous ``financial analysts''
converge on a tiny L-shaped corner called Lan Kwai Fong. The street,
and a few parallel side roads and alleyways, is dotted with such bars
as 1997, Oscar's and Yelt's Inn. The specialty at the Bit Point is
thick German beer on tap; at Al's Diner, a replica of an old
'50s-style American eatery, the drink specialty is the ``jello shot''
 &MD;  vodka mixed in a small container of hardened gelatin, swallowed in
one gulp.
<p>
   On Fridays, Lan Kwai Fong street  &MD;  blocked off to traffic for the
weekly tradition  &MD;  becomes a large street party, a place to loosen the
Hermes necktie, rendezvous with colleagues or simply observe the local
trendy set, the young Hong Kongers dressed head-to-toe in black or
young women with platform-soled boots high enough to qualify as
stilts.
<p>
   For the truly dedicated night-crawlers, the party of Lan Kwai Fong
inevitably deteriorates to a stopover at the more-downscale bar
district of Wanchai, perhaps best known as the setting for the novel
``The World of Suzie Wong.'' Suzie is now gone  &MD;  she went off to marry
William Holden in the movie version  &MD;  but some of her contemporaries
are still around, beckoning bleary-eyed expats inside. Some of the
more-notorious Wanchai discos, like Pussycat, Neptune and Strawberry,
barely get going before midnight, and imported Filipino house bands
turn out the same cover tunes week after week.
<p>
   Hong Kong is home to about 140,000 Filipinos, almost all women,
almost all employed as domestic housekeepers, or ``amahs.'' For most,
Sunday is their only day off  &MD;  meaning Saturday is the night for
bar-crawling. On Sundays, they pack the local churches, then turn
several blocks of downtown into a public plaza to sell cooked Filipino
delicacies, trade the latest gossip and meet with friends.
<p>
   Wanchai bars don't seem to close until dawn, just when the
more-hearty set is awakening for a day packed with sports activities,
a rarity in Hong Kong during the working week. Public tennis courts
here  &MD;  what few there are  &MD;  are jammed on weekends, and reservations
at least 10 days in advance are a must. In fact, with all of Hong Kong
reveling in the precious two days of weekend, advance reservations are
necessary for almost anything, including movies (reserved by phone,
including your assigned seat number) or a table for brunch at that
perennial outdoor favorite, the Peak Cafe, with a view overlooking the
picturesque southern side of Hong Kong island.
<p>
   One of the most popular retreats for a Saturday or Sunday is lunch
on one of what are known as the ``outer islands.'' Lamma, the largest
and best-known of the outer islands, has a string of open-air seafood
restaurants along the waterfront street known as, of course, Main
Street. There are no cars on Lamma, and the island's resident
population is just a few thousand or so, giving it a laid-back,
tropical feel even when the island becomes overrun by weekend
visitors.
<p>
   Lamma is accessible by a ferry boat, which leaves every two hours
or so from a downtown pier. The other route is by private junk, the
traditional name for a Chinese fishing boat, but that now means
virtually every type of pleasure craft. Most major companies here have
their own junks, and there are junks for hire on a daily basis. One
need be in Hong Kong only a matter of hours before the invitations for
a weekend junk trip start flowing. And most junk trips invariably go
to Lamma for the seafood.
<p>
   Another favorite weekend escape  &MD;  and that's what weekends are
really about in Hong Kong, escape  &MD;  is to venture further away, to the
neighboring territory of Macao. Macao is still run by Portugal, but is
scheduled to return to mainland China next year. But unlike
super-modern Hong Kong, Macao has managed to retain a sleepy,
almost-Mediterranean ambience, with its pastel buildings, Portuguese
forts, old cathedrals and the cobblestone square in the center of
town.
<p>
   Macao is also the place for legalized casino gambling, where Hong
Kong weekenders will throw down several thousand dollars a pop  &MD;  and
try to avoid getting hassled by the notorious loan sharks who hover
outside.
<p>
   Then it's back to Hong Kong, back to another Monday morning, and
another mad dash to make money.

 &UR; Late Nights at the Tip of the Continent (Buenos Aires) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  &MD;  The phone rang at 2:30 a.m., an hour at
which mny people would expect news of dead relatives. But here, in
what may well be the world's foremost city of late night, it was
merely the sound of another weekend about to begin. ``I hope you're
not in bed!'' chirped Cristian Cravello, an extroverted Argentine pal
of mine. Like most people in this country at the bottom of the world,
he believes no weekend should begin before the rest of the hemisphere
is soundly asleep. ``I'm picking you up in 30 minutes. Be ready to
party!''
<p>
   ``You realize, of course, that we'll be beginning our evening at 3
a.m.,'' I said, deadpan, lying in bed, eyes closed. ``This is
insane.''
<p>
   ``Get over it,'' he said ``You're in Buenos Aires now.''
<p>
   Indeed, while it's true that many Argentines can be seen during an
average weekend afternoon enjoying their lush parks and strolling
along European-style boulevards reminiscent of Madrid and Milan,
sensuous Buenos Aires, the mysterious and melancholy city of tango,
is, at its essence, all about the night.
<p>
   It is an evolution, say Argentines, of the cultural roots of
late-night dining passed on by immigrants from Spain and Italy, who
make up 80 percent of the country's population. But here in Argentina,
the tradition has somehow run dreadfully amok. Argentines are now so
nocturnal they make New Yorkers seem like lightweights.
<p>
   On an average weekend, Argentine restaurants open at, say, 9 p.m.
for dinner. But except for stray foreigners prowling the hemisphere's
southernmost metropolis, they are mostly empty until 10 or 10:30 p.m.
Peak dinner time starts around 11, with locals gorging on bloody
steaks and French fries until at least 1 in the morning, when the
younger crowd retreats for a quick ``disco nap'' to prepare them for
the evening of debauchery that awaits.
<p>
   The only thing early about the Argentine weekend is that it
generally starts on Thursday night. And like many major U.S. cities,
Buenos Aires has hip spots for each particular night. On Thursday
night, you're considered lower than dirt if you're not behind the
velvet rope at fashionable Buenos Aires News, where South American
paparazzi swarm, every woman looks like she graduated cum laude from
Pouty Model 101, and every man looks like Marky Mark in ``Boogie
Nights.''
<p>
   Owned by French actor Christopher Lambert, this restaurant/mega
disco is sizzling hot and the prime example of the new voracious
Argentine lust for VIP status in the land that Juan and Evita Peron
once tried to turn into a blue-collar, semi-socialist state.
<p>
   ``After the dictatorships ended (in the 1980s), we sort of
uncorked, like Spain after Franco,'' said Carolina Bilbao, an
Argentine programming producer lounging in the VIP section at Buenos
Aires News. ``We went totally frivolous and began worshiping star
culture because we really had never been allowed to do so before. Now,
the only thing that's important in Buenos Aires is to have a good car
and be invited to the VIP section of the hottest club.''
<p>
   Buenos Aires News, like most of the hot spots in this city of 14
million, is an androgynous mix of rich businessmen, Argentine polo,
soccer and tennis players, flamboyant fashion designers, leaders of
the art world and, of course, models, models, models. In a place that
used to frown upon public displays of flesh during the dictatorships,
Buenos Aires News paraded both men and women down a catwalk on a
recent Thursday clad in tight undergarments that made Victoria's
Secret look like an Amish clothing catalog.
<p>
   On Fridays, no self-respecting person in ``La Movida,'' or the B.A.
night scene, would be caught dead anywhere but La Morocha, or ``The
Dark Woman,'' an old train-station-turned-disco that opens around 1:30
a.m. and doesn't really roar until 4 a.m., when the line outside the
door can be blocks long. ``Everybody wants to be the last to arrive,''
said Claudio Lanzetta, PR czar of the local night scene. ``It's the
idea of being `fashionably late' to the extreme. Every year, the
people are pushing the peak hour later and later.''
<p>
   And of course, you cannot stay in one place too long. Maximum time
is two hours, slightly more if you've struck up a promising
conversation. Otherwise, it's time to hail the taxi and aim for the
next club  &MD;  a cycle that generally ends at 7 in the morning.
<p>
   But by then, good old American adrenaline has kicked in.
<p>
   At 5 a.m. on a recent Saturday, Cravello, my Argentine buddy, was
caught yawning. ``Come on, wake up,'' I said. ``We've got hours yet to
go.''

Xochimilco, just outside Mexico City, and the tequila is flowing, the
mariachi bands are blasting and the movable feasts are being devoured.
<p>
   Families arrive by the dozens, pile into brilliantly painted wooden
craft and drift through narrow canals amid a floating fiesta of
dueling boat bands, tables heaped with picnic fare and aquatic lanes
so jam-packed that any change in course becomes a game of bumper
boats. Quick! Grab that tequila bottle before it goes overboard.
<p>
   Mexico City is one of the world's largest megalopolises  &MD;  home to
22 million people  &MD;  and every Sunday is cause for celebration. On the
one day of the week that virtually everyone has off from work, it
seems as though the entire citizenry deserts its crowded barrios and
teeming suburbs in search of a patch of grass, a sliver of water or a
breath of clean air.
<p>
   No speck of green space goes unused. The parks are packed, the
median strips between boulevard lanes are transformed into picnic
grounds and the colonial squares are alive with clowns, musicians and
vendors of every type.
<p>
   But no escape is more popular than Xochimilco (pronounced
so-chee-MIL-ko), just 30 minutes south of town, where you can find
remnants of canals that 500 years ago served as the primary
thoroughfares for a Venetian-like Aztec city. Elsewhere, the canals
have long since been filled in and covered over by concrete, but in
Xochimilco they survive, meandering through suburban neighborhoods and
bleeding into marshes populated by elegant herons and chattering
blackbirds.
<p>
   For $10 an hour, anyone can rent a boat propelled by a pole (and a
hard-working gondolier-type driver) and join the party. The regulars
come laden with ice coolers and picnic baskets, for these are no
ordinary boats: Their central feature is a long plank table that can
accommodate a sit-down picnic of up to 18 people beneath wooden crowns
of vibrantly colored flowers and birds. But even those who don't bring
their own smorgasbord don't go hungry. The canals are a virtual market
of waterborne vendors. There are beer boats, candy-apple boats and
floating kitchens that will cook up a custom-ordered lunch of tortas,
tacos and tamales. Need a rose to woo your sweetie or a flower basket
to dress up your picnic table? A flower boat is never far away.
<p>
   In fact, Xochimilco was created by the Aztecs as a series of
floating gardens for supplying fruits and vegetables to the city. The
floating gardens continue to produce many of the flowers and plants
sold to Mexican families for their courtyards and gardens.
<p>
   Photo boats will record your outing, gaudy sombreros and serapes
supplied at no extra charge. But this is no foreign tourist trap. In
fact, few gringos tread these waters and those who do usually consider
it far too raucous for their delicate sensibilities. But they miss the
point, they lack the spirit.
<p>
   Where else can you watch dad dance on the bow of a boat balancing a
tequila bottle on his head? Or hire a floating mariachi band to
serenade your party with songs of battles won and loves lost? What
better place to dress up the kids in their Sunday best and celebrate a
First Communion? Or take a bottle of wine and invite your girlfriend
on an affordable cruise, just you and her on a boat built for 18? Or
gather three generations to celebrate Grandma's birthday? What better
vantage for just leaning back and watching the passing parade?

   LAGOS, Nigeria  &MD;  Weekends? In Africa, there are those who care and
those who don't.
<p>
   That image of Disastrous Africa we've gotten to know so well  &MD;  a
continent where dirt-poor people swelter in city slums or flee
incomprehensible civil wars  &MD;  doesn't mention days off. And there are
places in Africa where the stereotype fits, life is a struggle to
survive and weekends don't seem much on the agenda.
<p>
   But the disaster archipelago  &MD;  whose major islands these days might
be counted as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Somalia and the two Congos
 &MD;  is not all, or even most, of Africa. And in Ordinary Africa  &MD;  poor,
troubled, vibrant and not on our TV screens very much  &MD;  weekends
happen. They seem to use less gas and money, and more aunts and
uncles, than the American rite.
<p>
   In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, home of what appears to be West Africa's
biggest middle class, some weekend venues are much like what you'd
find in the United States: downtown jazz clubs on Saturday night,
churches on Sunday; and for the past year or so, West Africa's first
suburban shopping mall, complete with a fast-food joint, video games
and the kids with time, and maybe money, to spend.
<p>
   For even more people, though, weekends are simpler  &MD;  a bus ride
across town or out to a village to visit extensive, extended family.
There's a lot of soccer  &MD;  either dusty and sweaty on often grass-free
fields, or televised.
<p>
   Lagos, Nigeria, like most big cities, is part Disastrous Africa and
part Ordinary. It's a sprawling, brawling conurbation of  &MD;  well,
nobody really knows how many people it has, but 8 million is a common
guess.
<p>
   For those with a little money, and that's a lot of people, weekends
seem to happen on the beach. No African city appears to have managed
much in the way of municipal parks. And with a few exceptions, zoos,
museums and the like are woefully underfunded and attract thin crowds.
<p>
   But in the coastal cities, beaches are beautiful, free and jammed.
On Lagos' Victoria Island, Nigerians jam onto the beach in what looks
like a carnival.
<p>
   A couple of dollars will rent you a shady cabana of woven palm
leaves, open to the breeze front and back. Sweating vendors in tiny
stalls sell yams, grilled bananas, grilled ``bush meat'' and soft
drinks. Or ice water  &MD;  a few for a glassful, except there are no
glasses. You get it in a small, hand-knotted, plastic bag, bite a hole
in a corner and squeeze it down.
<p>
   But James Anya, a semi-employed driver who shuttled me around the
city in recent days, says he dare not even come to look at Lagos'
weekend on the beach. Like a lot of folks here, he is just trying to
survive Nigeria's collapsed, corrupt economy.
<p>
   Whether you care about weekends depends on whether you're feeding
your family, said Anya. If you have a good job, then ``on Sunday you
can stay home with your family,'' he said. But only if you're managing
to make enough money to feed them.
<p>
   Anya's salary is $24 a month. ``If you have no money and the
children ask you for something, you cannot feel comfortable at home.
So on Sunday, you will go to church and pray to God for a job on
Monday,'' Anya said. ``Or you will go out and walk and think how you
can get money.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   The last week of the Northern Ireland peace talks was anything but
a stately journey toward historic destiny. There were accusations,
histrionics, last-minute hitches. At an alarmingly late stage, it
seemed that basic questions had not been answered, that some key
concepts had not been worked through. And when, after a sleepless
night, a complex deal was reached by exhausted negotiators, suspicions
lingered. Is this real change or just a mutual respite for worn-out
enemies? Was the desire for peace driven by something more than the
momentum generated by deadlines, expectations and the massed ranks of
television news crews?
<p>
   The questions are not abstract. The deal announced Friday will have
to withstand terrible pressures. Fringe terror groups on both sides
will test it with atrocities. Two of the most important parties in the
process  &MD;  Gerry Adams' Sinn Fein and David Trimble's Ulster unionists
 &MD;  will face considerable internal dissent. The political mechanics of
establishing both a workable administration in Northern Ireland and
cross-border bodies with the Republic of Ireland will be extremely
complex. If the deal does not have deep roots, it will be blown away.
<p>
   There are, though, good reasons to believe that the peace package
arises not from a passing moment but from some fundamental shifts. For
one of the more paradoxical effects of 30 years of conflict has been
to give an illusion of continuity to a period of profound change. The
epic language of immemorial and irreconcilable divisions that tends to
be used about Northern Ireland has hidden the fact that many of the
assumptions that held good in 1968 when the killing began simply no
longer apply.
<p>
   In 1922, when the last attempt at a comprehensive settlement
between Ireland and Britain was being debated in the British House of
Commons, Winston Churchill famously contrasted the vast changes in
Europe after World War I with the obstinate constancy of religious
divisions in Northern Ireland. Everything else had undergone ``violent
and tremendous changes in Dublin in the deluge of the world,'' he
said. ``But as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short, we see
the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again. The
integrity of their quarrel is one of the few institutions that has
been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept the world.''
<p>
   Now, as the flood of violence that has washed over Northern Ireland
begins to recede, the dreary steeples of sectarian division between
British Protestants and Irish Catholics are still the most prominent
features on the landscape. But beneath them, at ground level, almost
everything has changed. Only because the quarrel was conducted with
such ferocity was it so hard to notice how obsolete it was becoming.
<p>
   When the Northern Ireland conflict began in 1968, it was possible
to see the war between Irish Catholic nationalism and Protestant
British unionism as a clash of civilizations. The categories were, of
course, crude. Ordinary lives and attitudes were much more complex
than political or religious labels would allow. There was,
nevertheless, a real sense in which Catholics and Protestants belonged
to sharply opposed cultures. It was not simply that they worshiped in
different churches, or marched behind different flags. They also, on
the whole, lived different lives.
<p>
   The Republic of Ireland, with which Catholics identified, was still
a predominantly rural and agricultural society beyond Dublin. Northern
Irish Protestants, on the other hand, belonged to a strongly urban and
industrial world. In everyday life, the terms ``Irish'' and
``British'' were shorthand for a great deal more than national
identity. You could use them to guess with reasonable accuracy what
kind of work someone did, whether they used contraceptives (and
therefore how many children they had), what sort of sports they
played. Yet, precisely in the years of the conflict, this gradually
became impossible.
<p>
   When the Troubles started, it made some sense for Northern
Protestants to see themselves as part of a modern, prosperous economy
and the Republic of Ireland, by contrast, as an underdeveloped
backwater. Even in the early 1970s, gross domestic product per head in
the largely Catholic Republic was just half what it was in the largely
Protestant United Kingdom. And implicit in the contrast was a belief
that this was not coincidental. As the Protestants saw it, the Irish
were poor because they were Catholic. They were, in the Protestant
imagination, priest-ridden peasants.
<p>
   Now, in the late 1990s, the Republic has a higher GDP per capita
than the United Kingdom. It is a predominantly urban society. The
political power of the Catholic church has been broken  &MD;  a process
completed in 1996 when the Irish voted to permit divorce. Irish
Catholics, on the whole, take neither their morality nor their
politics from their clergy. They use contraceptives and have the same
number of children that Protestants do. They are more likely to be
found making Pentium microchips than growing potatoes.
<p>
   While all of this was going on, the world that Irish Protestants
knew 30 years ago was disappearing. The once-mighty industries of
Northern Ireland were becoming obsolete. The shipyards and engineering
works that were still the pride of Protestant Belfast in 1968 have
long since dwindled.
<p>
   British identity has been no more stable than Irish identity. In
1968, it was still possible to imagine Britain as an imperial power.
The symbols that Northern Irish Protestants valued  &MD;  the monarchy, the
empire, the United Kingdom  &MD;  have lost their glamour. After the royal
scandals and Princess Diana's death, the monarchy seems more a source
of confusion than a guarantor of eternal stability. After the handoff
of Hong Kong last year, Britain's overseas empire now contains just
168,000 people. And after Tony Blair's concession of devolved
parliaments for Scotland and Wales, the United Kingdom is being
transformed into a decentralized federation of nations.
<p>
   Yet both sides in the conflict tended to collude in a pretense that
all of this change was not happening. Protestants and Catholics had a
mutual interest in the image of the Republic of Ireland as a poor
backwater. For Protestants, it served both as a warning of what would
happen if they moved away from the British fold and as an excuse for
prejudice and discrimination against Catholics. For Catholics, it
served as evidence of British perfidy and proof that Ireland could
never prosper so long as any part of it remained ``unfree.''
<p>
   Likewise, the image of Britain as a mighty imperial power suited
each of the warring tribes. For Protestants, it was a source of pride
and comfort. For Catholics, it suggested that they were part of the
great decolonizing movement of the post-war world. For those in both
communities who sympathized with the proponents of armed terror, it
lent an aura of epic grandeur to squalid and intimate cruelties.
<p>
   The Protestant policeman murdered in front of his children wasn't
just a target for sectarian hatred. He was the representative of a
mighty empire. The Catholic shopkeeper murdered behind his counter
wasn't just a victim of venomous bigotry. He was an enemy of Her
Britannic Majesty the Queen. Somehow, the illusion seemed to make the
killing easier.
<p>
   Violent division has the strange effect of making people
overestimate their enemies. Catholics and Protestants could see that
their own communities were in flux. Neither could see that what was
happening to it also was happening to the other side. One of the wry
ironies of Northern Ireland, indeed, is that social surveys
consistently show that both Protestants and Catholics believe a) that
their own side is divided and incoherent, and b) that the other side
is an impressively unified monolith. Both, of course, were right about
themselves and wrong about the others.
<p>
   In a sense, the real question about the peace deal is not why it
has come now, but why it did not come a long time ago. The elements of
the package agreed upon Friday have been available for at least a
decade.
<p>
   Understanding came slowly because violence numbs the mind and
because a cycle of atrocity and repression continually renewed the
violence. Only when the cycle was broken by the paramilitary
cease-fires of 1994 did it become possible to see how much has
changed. Only then did it become obvious that British Protestants and
Irish Catholics are no longer different kinds of people. The peace
deal, at least, gives political and institutional recognition to the
fact that the integrity of their quarrel had not, after all, survived
the cataclysms that have swept the world.

   Almost half of all Americans turning 65 this year will be admitted
into a nursing home at least once during their lives, according to the
U.S. Health Care Financing Administration.
<p>
   To educate Americans about long-term care options, HFCA has
produced a booklet, ``Medicare and Medicaid: Guide to Choosing a
Nursing Home.'' The booklet provides information on community
resources, payment, special care needs and quality of care, as well as
a checklist on how to select a home.

 &UR; Need for Vitamin B12 After 50 Is Emphasized &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The National Academy of Sciences targeted seniors last week as one
of the groups of Americans that need to take some vitamin supplements.
<p>
   Heading the list of recommendations from the academy is a call for
those 50 and older to take supplements of vitamin B12, an essential
nutrient that is found in animal products, including fish, meat and
dairy foods. Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, helps maintain red
blood cells and protect the integrity of nerve cells, from the hands
and feet to the brain.
<p>
   Special recommendations for older adults are something new in the
well-known ``recommended dietary allowances,'' which have been renamed
the ``dietary reference intakes.'' The latest guidelines have been
expanded to include two new age categories: 51 to 70 years old and 70
years and older.
<p>
   Past recommendations had nutritional requirements for older
Americans that were lower than those for younger people. ``The
thinking was that because older people were taking in fewer calories,
they would need fewer nutrients,'' said Robert M. Russell, professor
of medicine at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston.
<p>
   New research in older people shows just the opposite. ``Old people
need just as much as the young people and in some cases may need
more,'' Russell said.
<p>
   For this reason, the latest recommendations advise those 51 and
older to increase their consumption of vitamin B12 and other B
vitamins, including folic acid, thiamine and niacin. Additional
recommendations published last fall by the academy raised recommended
intakes of calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bones.
<p>
   In the case of vitamin B12, up to a third of those aged 50 and
older lose the ability to produce enough stomach acid to extract the
vitamin from food. Without it, ``vitamin B12 remains attached to
protein in food'' and is never absorbed into the body, said Bonnie
Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group. ``That's why older
people need to get vitamin B12 in vitamin supplements or in fortified
food.''
<p>
   Why this change occurs is unclear, but failure to get enough
vitamin B12 can lead to anemia, a common blood disorder characterized
by feeling tired, and to nerve damage.
<p>
   ``We are worried more about the nerve damage than we are about the
anemia,'' said Russell, who served on the academy committee that
drafted the new guidelines. ``Because it's not just nerve damage in
the hands and feet, which is bad enough, but it is also dementia,
confusion and memory problems.''
<p>
   To help prevent such deficiencies from occurring, the academy
recommended last week that ``adults over age 50 meet most of their
recommended intake with synthetic B12,'' said Roy M. Pitkin, professor
emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California
in Los Angeles and chairman of the academy's panel that drafted the
new guidelines. The latest guidelines recommend 2.4 micrograms per day
of vitamin B12 for those aged 51 and older. Most daily multiple
vitamins supply this amount.
<p>
   But a few recent studies have suggested that older people who have
less stomach acid may also have more digestive bacteria that use the
vitamin B12  &MD;  and thereby deprive the body of what it requires. For
this reason, some experts, including Russell, recommend as much as 25
micrograms per day of vitamin B12. Many of the vitamins designed for
older Americans contain this amount.
<p>
   The new recommendations on vitamin B12 are closely linked with
concern that women of childbearing age get enough folic acid, a B
vitamin that helps prevent serious birth defects, such as spina
bifida, and appears to help reduce the risk of heart disease.
<p>
   Since Jan. 1, the Food and Drug Administration has required food
manufacturers to fortify bread, cereal, pasta, rice and flour with
folic acid to make sure that Americans consume adequate amounts of
this important vitamin.
<p>
   One problem, however, is that too much folic acid can mask a
deficiency of vitamin B12 in the elderly and some studies suggest it
may even worsen nerve damage. For this reason, the academy recommended
not exceeding 1,000 micrograms per day of folic acid.
<p>
   ``The chance of a young person having a vitamin B12 deficiency in
our society is very, very small,'' Russell said. But for an older
person, the odds are much greater, he said.
<p>
   ``We are learning,'' he said, ``that elderly people have some
requirements that are different because of specific metabolic or
absorptive differences, but that it is just as important for an older
person to keep good nutrition as it is for a younger person.''

    &UR; National:
<p>
   PACKWOOD  &MD;  PORTLAND, Ore.  &MD;  Former Sen. Bob Packwood, who has
largely stayed away from Oregon since resigning in disgrace in 1995,
has hinted he might run for office, but observers say his higher
public profile may be aimed only at rehabilitating his image. 840
words, by Terry McDermott (Times) (a). Upcoming.
<p>
   CLINTON-PANETTA  &MD;  WASHINGTON  &MD;  Through nearly three months of
controversy about the nature of President Clinton's involvement with
onetime intern Monica S. Lewinsky, his former White House chief of
staff has been traveling the public airwaves, delivering the same
off-message message: Come forward, Mr. President, Leon Panetta keeps
saying almost plaintively; talk to us; tell us what happened. 1,200
words, by Peter Baker (Post) (w).
<p>
   DRUNK  &MD;  WASHINGTON  &MD;  A proposal to create a national
drunken-driving standard was quietly strangled in a House committee
the night of March 31, and despite what opponents and advocates say,
the standard may have a tough time surviving a fight on Capitol Hill.
1,700 words, by Eric Pianin (Post) (w). With DRUNK-ALCOHOL.
<p>
   KILLERS  &MD;  Sociologists, psychiatrists, criminologists and others

tendency, and a new study suggests some are. 1,150 words, by Rob Stein
(Post) (a).
<p>
   FEDERAL-DIARY  &MD;  Reports on the federal workforce. By Mike Causey
(Post) (w).
<p>
    &UR; International
<p>
   MEXICO-PROTEST  &MD;  CUERNAVACA, Mexico  &MD;  In a microcosm of the crisis
in the nation's criminal justice system, Morelos state officials are
under arrest, accused of helping drug and kidnapping gangs or covering
up police abuse; citizens have launched protests that threaten to
bring down the powerful governor. 1,300 words, by Mary Beth Sheridan
(Times) (i). Upcoming.
<p>
   RUSSIA-CARS  &MD;  For years, Russian drivers were so grateful to be
able to buy a car that they never dared hope it would actually run
well, but now car buyers are finding themselves in an unfamiliar
position: masters of the market instead of slaves to it. 1,130 words,
by Kathy Lally (Sun). With RUSSIA-CARS-MAGAZINE (both i). Upcoming.
<p>
   TIBET  &MD;  KATMANDU, Nepal  &MD;  Thousands of Tibetans fleeing repression

Filkins (Times) (i). With TIBET-REFUGEES. Upcoming.
<p>
   CHINA-BUSINESS  &MD;  GUIYANG, China  &MD;  The once-suppressed private
sector is growing fast  &MD;  and shaking the foundations of China; from
big foreign firms to entrepreneurs to street vendors, China's private
businesses are outpacing China's lumbering state-owned enterprises
with harder work, newer technology and better management; overview.
1,250 words, by Steven Mufson (Post) (i).
<p>
   JAPAN-CONSUMERS  &MD;  CHIBA, Japan  &MD;  The proof is not in the pudding  &MD; 
it's in the soy sauce; the family patriarch of the famous Kikkoman
brand can tell by people's soy-sauce-buying habits that Japan's
economy is in deep trouble  &MD;  it's expected to shrink for the first
time in a quarter-century. 1,200 words, by Mary Jordan and Kevin
Sullivan (Post) (i).
<p>
   ICEMAN  &MD;  BOLZANO, Italy  &MD;  ``Otzi'' the Bronze Age iceman has cometh
to the modern age; after lying undisturbed for 5,300 years under an
Alpine glacier near the Italian border with Austria, Otzi's perfectly
mummified remains have been installed in Bolzano's archaeology museum
and put on public view for the first time since German hikers
discovered them seven years ago. 875 words, by Vera Haller (Post
special) (i).
<p>
    &UR; Financial:
<p>
   MANAGERS  &MD;  Half a dozen years after the popular press and academia
wrote off the Organization Man and his descendants as an endangered
species being replaced by a brave new world of technology and lean
organizations, managers are now hot properties in the help-wanted ads.
1,410 words, by Tim Smart (Post) (f). MANAGERS-REENGINEER.
<p>
   HELPWANTED  &MD;  Weight-y issue aired in public by ex-boss. By Carrie
Mason-Draffen (Newsday) (f). Upcoming.
<p>
   There is no MUTUALFUNDS (Morgan, Newsday) feature this week.
<p>
    &UR; Opinion:
<p>
   CLINTON-COMMENT  &MD;  The Clintons have used private investigators,
secretly, for purposes well beyond the previously acknowledged
suppression of ``bimbo eruptions.'' 750 words, by William Bradley
(Times special) (k). Upcoming.
<p>
   FUHRMAN-COMMENT  &MD;  While the Justice Department says Mark Fuhrman
cannot be prosecuted in the courts because of the statute of
limitations, he ought to be prosecuted in the court of public opinion;
his police records should be made public. 335 words, by O.J. Simpson
(Times special) (k). Upcoming.
<p>
   MEDICINE-COMMENT  &MD;  We would be much more fully served by a practice
of medicine that knew its own limits in triumphing over suffering  &MD; 
limits to the benefits of research, limits to the struggle against
death, limits to relieving our pain and misery. 875 words, by Daniel
Callahan (Times special) (k). Upcoming.
<p>
   MIDEAST-COMMENT  &MD;  Ever since the Oslo accords between Israel and
the Palestinians, pro-peace Americans and American Jews have deceived
themselves into thinking that they no longer had to push much for the
peace process. 800 words, by Michael Lerner (Times special) (k).
Upcoming.
<p>
   ALGERIA-COMMENT  &MD;  The world organizations entrusted with protecting
human rights and lives must intervene in Algeria; just as in Bosnia
the world cannot remain a spectator; the raping of Muslim women must
be entered as a crime tried in international tribunals. 850 words, by
Fadwa El Guindi (Newsday special) (k). Upcoming.
<p>
   TURKEY-COMMENT  &MD;  In all likelihood, the 1981 plot to kill the pope
was not hatched by a foreign government; rather, it appears to have
been the work of renegade Turkish extremists who operated under the
protective umbrella of Turkey's secret service but did not always take
their orders from Ankara. 1,300 words, by Martin A. Lee (Times
special) (k). Upcoming.
<p>
   FASHION-COMMENT  &MD;  The danger in investing styles of dress with so
much emotional power is that a more-important reality is obscured:
Clothes cannot define us or empower us. 600 words, by Robin Givhan
(Post) (k).
<p>
   ULSTER-COMMENT  &MD;  There are good reasons to believe that the
Northern Ireland peace package arises not from a passing moment but
from some fundamental shifts; one of the more-paradoxical effects of
30 years of conflict has been to give an illusion of continuity to a
period of profound change. 1,500 words, by Fintan O'Toole (Post
special) (k).
<p>
   STARR-SUBPOENA-COMMENT  &MD;  Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Starr
has several times subpoenaed information from news organizations and
publishers; in some cases, he has not followed longstanding Justice
Department guidelines; moreover, he has said he is not bound by the
guidelines, a stance that appears to put him squarely at odds with
what Congress intended in enacting the independent-counsel law. 1,760
words, by Florence George Graves (Post special) (k).
<p>
   GLASSMAN  &MD;  Bigger, better banks. By James K. Glassman (Post
special) (k).
<p>
   POST EDITORIAL, moved; TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming (both k).
<p>
   There is no Barabara T. ROESSNER (Courant) column this week.

 &UR; OFF-KILTER: Notes From the World of Weird &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; Cowboys and Aliens: &LR;  Sure, other journalists might risk their
lives reporting from war zones, police shootouts or deadly hurricanes,
but only Off-Kilter has the courage to enter a grocery store and
actually buy the supermarket tabloids that most humans are too
embarrassed to be seen with.
<p>
   That's why, when we spotted the ``new and improved'' National
Enquirer, we took a deep breath, said a silent prayer and then begged
our girlfriend to please go back into the store and purchase it while
we stayed by the car as a lookout.
<p>
   One super-expensive dinner later, she handed over the copy and we
read it. Unfortunately, we couldn't tell the difference between the
``new'' Enquirer and the old one. But we did find a story inside about
Willie Nelson telling Texas Monthly magazine that he believes his
brain is able to pick up radio waves from ``somewhere in the
universe,'' which is how he gets his songs. Needless to say, we're
terrified. For starters, what if the extraterrestrials find out Nelson
is plagiarizing their music and decide to destroy the entire planet in
retaliation? Even scarier is the idea that space aliens, the most
sophisticated creatures in the galaxy, actually enjoy country music.
<p>
    &UR; Bumper Sticker of the Day: &LR;  ``Dyslexics Have More Fnu.''
<p>
    &UR; Titaniholics Anonymous: &LR;  It's time to create an international
12-step program for Titanic addiction. The latest victim of the
scourge is Halifax, Nova Scotia, which is swarming with
Titanic-obsessed tourists.
<p>
   The central attraction is a Titanic cemetery. In 1912, Halifax sent
a ship loaded with embalming fluid and coffins to recover bodies from
the sunken luxury liner. A Halifax minister went along and conducted
burial-at-sea rites for 119 victims, but 209 bodies were returned to
Halifax, according to the Montreal Gazette.
<p>
   In what now seems like an unwitting stroke of marketing genius, the
grave marker for engine-room worker James Dawson was inscribed simply
``J. Dawson.'' Although there's no connection to the fictional Jack
Dawson character played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie, J. Dawson
is now king of the nether world. Teen-age girls are flocking to his
tomb and leaving flowers, movie ticket stubs and love letters,
according to the London Daily Mail.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Halifax officials have opened a Titanic Web site
(http://titanic.gov.ns.ca) and expanded the city's Titanic museum
exhibit. Also, tour companies are offering Titanic-themed trips and
meals aimed at U.S. visitors.
<p>
    &UR; Odd Inventions Inc.: &LR;  Smokers who want to quit have the nicotine
patch. Overeaters who want to diet now have the ``anti-pastry patch.''
It's an almond-and-vanilla-scented strip that supposedly reduces the
craving for sweets  &MD;  but not by transmitting cholesterol into your
bloodstream a la its nicotine cousin. Instead, the ``aromacology
patch,'' which was invented by a British chef and recently featured on
``Extra,'' fills the air with almond and vanilla scents. Personally,
we think dessert odors would make people more hungry, but you can give
the $1.30 pastry patch a try by calling (888) 780-6824.

 &UR; TRAVEL DEALS: Plan to Protect Small Airlines Finds a Surprising Foe &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In the name of fair competition, Transportation Secretary Rodney E.
Slater has announced that his department wants to start aggressively
protecting those feisty little budget airlines that leisure travelers
love.
<p>
   Who could object to that  &MD;  other than the major carriers? You'd be
surprised. You also might want to tell Slater your thoughts on the
plan, because future fares likely will hinge on the outcome.
<p>
   Slater's statement last week said there have been instances in
which a new, small airline offered a low-price service from a major
carrier's hub only to find the major carrier cutting fares, increasing
the number of seats on that route and ``sacrificing short-term profits
with only one goal in mind: to drive the new entrant out of the market
and then raise its own fares to their original level or higher and cut
back its level of service.''
<p>
   So, after a 60-day period of public comment, the Department of
Transportation will begin fining future violators if necessary, though
it hopes the threat of action will be enough. The department says the
policy isn't an attempt to put any controls on the market after 20
years of deregulation in the airline industry.
<p>
   Many small airlines naturally like the new idea. ``We think it's
wonderful because it'll help consumers by helping to keep us around,''
said Rob Kulat, spokesman for Kiwi International Air Lines, which came
out of bankruptcy last July and serves four U.S. cities and San Juan,
Puerto Rico, from Newark, N.J. ``Airlines like us serve as a level
against big airlines to keep fares reasonable over the long term,''
Kulat said. ``Business fares were up 14 percent at the beginning of
this year, while leisure fares were down 14 percent. Leisure travelers
use small airlines. Without the Kiwis of the world, there wouldn't be
a 14 percent decrease in fares.''
<p>
   Big airlines, however, express concern about unfair restrictions on
their ability to compete, and say small carriers made larger gains
than the big ones last year. And skeptical observers ask how the
Transportation Department could ever prove a case of unfair
competition against a major airline when some of the newest low-cost
carriers are the majors' own offshoots.
<p>
   ``We're probably going to end up siding with the major carriers on
this one,'' said Paul Hudson, executive director of Ralph Nader's
Aviation Consumer Action Project. ``We're very much concerned and
against anticompetitive practices, but this proposal is not the
answer. In effect, it's the government saying they're going to
eliminate fare wars  &MD;  and that's not appropriate in dereglated price
competition.''
<p>
   Hudson said that rather than protecting consumers, the plan would
protect small airlines and could have the perverse effect of raising
fares, because startup airlines won't set low prices if they know the
majors' fare reductions will be restricted. His group's
recommendation: Require airlines to lock in any new low fare for a
year and provide an adequate number of seats at that rate.
<p>
   Public comment will be accepted until early June on the plan. You
can find details at http://www.dot.gov/briefing.htm. Address letters
to: Room PL-401, Docket OST-98-3713, U.S. Department of
Transportation, 400 Seventh St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.

 &UR; TRAVEL NOTES: Finding Frequent-Flier Seats to Europe Getting Tougher &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Having trouble finding frequent-flier seats to Europe for the
summer? No wonder. Americans made nearly a million more trips abroad
last year than in 1996, and the European Travel Commission has no
reason to doubt that 1998 will be the sixth record year in a row. So
you should have tried booking sooner.
<p>
   ``Sure it's true there aren't free seats left, because who plans a
vacation to Europe now?'' said Randy Petersen, editor/publisher of
Inside Flyer magazine. ``The rule of thumb is to plan six to nine
months in advance. It's rather late now.''
<p>
   Still, he holds out some hope for stragglers. First, he suggests,
look for airlines that are starting new routes. For example,
Continental Airlines plans to start daily service to Ireland's Shannon
Airport from Newark on June 15. The allotment of frequent-flier seats
on those flights probably isn't filled yet, Petersen said, because the
route hadn't been announced six months ago when savvy travelers were
booking their overseas trips.
<p>
   Also, Petersen said, there are always plenty of freebie seats for
passengers willing to fork over more miles to get one. ``The airlines
are really saying there are no free seats available at 35,000 miles or
whatever,'' he said. ``But you can call up and ask what's their
standard `Anytime Award' requirement  &MD;  which usually is twice as many
miles as the limited awards.''

   (ADVANCE WEEKEND FEATURES)
<p>
   (TRAIN)
<p>
   By Todd Richissin
<p>
   (c) 1998, The Baltimore Sun
<p>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. - In Johanssons, one of the most flavorful, quaint
- and usually peaceful - restaurants in downtown Westminster, there is
a standard lunchtime conversation that goes something like this:
<p>
   First Person: `` ... ''
<p>
   Second Person: ``Huh?''
<p>
   Then there is a pause. And the conversation does not pick up again
until the Maryland Midland train finishes its jolting, jarring,
clanking, blaring, altogether-way-too-LOUD jaunt through town.
<p>
   Baltimore may have its honking highways and construction
screeching, but even Maryland's largest city has no noise like quiet
little Westminster's noise.
<p>
   Twice a day, sometimes three, a train of 50 cars brings downtown to
a halt. That is because the train, part of Maryland Midland Railway,
does not pass by downtown but through it.
<p>
   ``When that train comes by,'' says Jamie Wehler, who works
downtown, ``I swear to you, it physically hurts.''
<p>
   Blue and orange engines tug the cargo down a set of tracks parallel
to Railroad Avenue and into a lane of automobile traffic at
Westminster's main intersection. The train then moves onto the road
and into a turning lane, takes a brief curve on Main Street and then
harmlessly snakes away.
<p>
   Along its route through downtown, though, it brushes within a coal
spark of businesses, most of them brick, which amplifies the train's
whistle so it is only slightly less loud than a sonic boom. It does
not ``choo-choo'' so much as blast into submission anything that comes
near its path.
<p>
   ``There's no sense fighting it,'' says Suzanne Ricciardelli, a
manager of Johanssons Dining House on Main Street and Railroad Avenue,
whose back steps reach within three feet of the passing trains.
<p>
   ``The experienced people just give up talking till it passes,'' she
says. ``Some new people to the restaurant might try to talk over it,
but you can't.''
<p>
   In more excitable places, the train and its whistle might be cause
for some kind of protest. Not in Westminster. Residents here see it as
much a part of the character of Westminster and the horse-dotted hills
that surround downtown.
<p>
   ``A lot of the people who come in here want to sit by the window
where they can see the train,'' Ricciardelli says. ``They think it's
exciting.''
<p>
   The track that passes through Westminster was built in 1862, in
time to serve as a main artery to supply the Union Army at Gettysburg
and to haul away the battle's casualties.
<p>
   It was taken over by Maryland Midland in the 1970s and runs 50
miles, from Highfield in the west to Glyndon.
<p>
   A separate line of 17 miles passes through Union Bridge, running
from Taneytown to Walkersville.
<p>
   Railroad traffic through cities is nothing new and has become more
common with the deregulation of the railroad lines in 1980. There are
more than 540 freight railroads chugging along, carrying more than 1.8
billion tons of cargo a year over more than 146,000 miles of track,
according to the Association of American Railroads.
<p>
   But it is a rarity for trains to pass so close through a downtown
business district. When passing through Westminster, Maryland Midland
trains go no faster than 10 mph, according to the company's president,
Paul Denton.
<p>
   ``We've voluntarily put that speed limit on ourselves,'' he says.
``We're doing everything we can to have no accidents.''
<p>
   As far as anyone can remember, there have been no accidents in
Westminster involving Maryland Midland, and rail safety has improved
over the past several years.
<p>
   Typically, the Maryland Midland cars carry cement, stone, coal and
lumber. Maryland Midland's largest customer is Lehigh Cement, in Union
Bridge. The engineer pulls the trains into Lehigh, workers fill them
with cement or mortar, and then the cars roll away.
<p>
   If a load is destined for, say, Richmond, Va., Maryland Midland
will drop the cargo cars off in Glyndon, and another railroad will
haul them the rest of the way.
<p>
   ``It's a good operation that usually doesn't get too much
attention,'' says Denton.
<p>
   ``It may be an inconvenience to some people at times, but most
people tend to forget we're even around.''
<p>
   Take, for example, last year's Halloween parade.
<p>
   A good-sized crowd had lined Main Street to watch an assortment of
Bill Clintons and Batmans and Crayola crayons and other costumed
paraders march from one end of town to the other.
<p>
   ``Well, here comes the train,'' recalls Jean Geroft, 56, one of the
spectators. ``The train, it wasn't going to stop. So the police and
the firemen stopped the parade, told all the people to move and the
train just kept on going. It was more fun than an inconvenience.''
<p>
   And there is another upside to the trains, even when they $INS4;

that her apartment is drowned in sound.
<p>
   ``My boyfriend really loves it,'' she says. ``For a couple minutes
he doesn't have to listen to me talk.''

   initial,4 M EYNES, France &MD; Can five couples find happiness sharing a
villa for a week in a small village in Provence? Mais oui!
<p>
   When friends and acquaintances were told of our plan to do just
that, the universal reaction was, ``Are you crazy?'' They then
reminded us that you never really know people until you travel with
them &MD; and then it's too late.
<p>
   Undeterred, we plunged ahead. Did our grand adventure turn out to
be all we'd hoped? Absolutely. Were we all still speaking by week's
end? We were, in fact, a well functioning family. There were no cross
words, no quibbling (publicly, at least) about who had the better
accommodations, no hurt feelings when one or more couples opted out of
some planned excursion to spend time alone or go elsewhere.
<p>
   We had started our odyssey as six couples, but an accident in
Barcelona en route forced one couple to return home to get medical
attention. Old friends all &MD; save for two spouses who have been embraced
by the group &MD; we include journalists, a historian, an FBI agent and an
attorney. Recently, we had started a tradition, gathering each year in
Seattle for a long Fourth of July break. And some of us had traveled
abroad in pairs. But we were well aware that is quite different from
being under the same roof 24 hours a day.
<p>
   Finding the villa of our dreams wasn't easy. For weeks, we pored
over catalogs solicited from agencies from Massachusetts to Oregon,
answered ads in newspapers and magazines including the New Yorker and
San Francisco magazine, scoured the Internet and compared notes by
telephone. After all this searching,  &QL;

two of us, working with different agents, zeroed in on the same
property about the same time. Our fellow travelers decided to rely
largely on faith and friendship. &HT;    To make it work, we wanted each couple to have as much privacy as
possible. Our ideal villa would have six bedrooms and six baths. (OK,
ugly Americans). This quickly eliminated 90% of available properties.
There were dozens of lovely looking places with pools, stately salons,
baronial dining rooms and accommodations for 12, but with only half
enough baths.
<p>
   Having heard horror stories about villa rentals &MD; swimming pools
blanketed in algae, chicken feathers coming out of a water tap and
places perched only feet above the roar of the Autoroute du Soleil &MD; we
were wary. Ultimately, our quest led us to Ashland, Ore., to At Home
in France. A name plucked from a magazine ad, it's an agency that
handles only French properties and, we were assured, scouts their
villas before recommending them. The amiable agent, Allyn Kaufmann,
seemed to be on our wavelength. Where other agents had tried to reel
us in by assuring us that we had no chance of finding 6BR/6BA,
Kaufmann said it would be difficult but not impossible.
<p>
   Then one day she called with good news. Though she hadn't seen the
property, she had learned of a listing for Domaine Amen, an ancient
former convent in the village of Meynes. A colleague had told her it
was COLUMN 1 ENDS HERE. FILM DEPTH AT THIS POINT IS 9.714 inches &QL;

A-1 &MD; and previous renters had made a glowing report. It sounded almost
perfect: five bedrooms and a convertible den, four baths and a powder
room in the main house, with another bath just outside by the pool;
two bedrooms and bath in a guest house only steps away. &HT;    The owner, she told us, was a renowned French artist who, with his
companion, lives on site. Ordinarily, we would have asked for
references from previous tenants, but it was getting to be crunch
time. The large properties tend to be booked months ahead. So, we
scrutinized the photographs and the drawing of the floor plan and
agreed: This was it.
<p>
   Booking through At Home in France, the rental was $4,200 a week,
plus a refundable $1,000 security deposit &MD; to be paid on our return &MD; and
utilities and telephone, which came to about $150. The couple who
couldn't come paid their share out of pocket as, unlike some of us,
they hadn't opted for trip cancellation insurance. Most agents
recommend it and will refer you to the Automobile Club, American
Express or a travel agent handling such insurance. Because rental
agencies have contracts with the property owners, monies are generally
nonrefundable in case of a last-minute problem &MD; unless the property can
be re-rented.
<p>
   Split six ways, Domaine Amen came out to about $700 a couple for
the week. Where in France can you rent a luxury hotel room for that?
And hotel rooms don't come with garden, cherry orchard, vast public
rooms and Charles-Louis La Salle, our genial host, descended, he told
us, from a Gen. La Salle who fought with Napoleon.

   (Currently, the guest house is not available; the villa, now
expanded to sleep 14, rents from $3,580 to $7,585 a week, depending
upon the season.)

   O ur adventure began on a Saturday in mid-May last year as we
rendezvoused in the village of Meynes, which we reached by a minor
road off Route D986, midway between Ni &UR; mes and Avignon and about 15
miles from each. We came from as far north as Seattle, as far south as
San Diego. Three couples flew into Milan, one into Cannes; another
drove down from Paris. With directions provided by Kaufmann, all found
their way easily to Domaine Amen, filled with guarded anticipation.
<p>
   Anticipation changed quickly to delight. La Salle, the villa owner,
who speaks some English, was there to welcome us. He and his
companion, Joel Schneider, occupy one wing of the villa, which has a
separate entrance. They were always available when needed (as they
were the day we very briefly had neither heat nor electricity nor
water), but they never intruded.
<p>
   By evening, there were five rental cars lined up in the villa's
gated courtyard. Each arriving couple was directed by the already
entrenched guests around the side COLUMN 2 ENDS HERE. FILM DEPTH AT

of the villa to the proper entrance, with its spacious foyer
overlooking a terrace and garden. Thereafter, we dispensed with
formality and took the shortcut, up a flight of stairs from the
courtyard entrance. &HT;    The property had been billed by another agent as a ``superb village
house in the heart of the quaint village of Meynes,'' only a short
drive from the Roman bridge Pont du Gard and other major destinations.
<p>
   That description was almost accurate. The only disappointment was
the village itself, which was not the colorful town of our
imaginations, with a beautiful square and little sidewalk cafes.
Rather, Meynes is an unremarkable village of 3,000, many of them
blue-collar workers at airports in Ni &UR; mes and Marseilles. . A number
appeared to be unemployed, as there was always a cluster of men, some
young, sitting in the rather dreary town square.
<p>
   Wandering into Meynes' only ``restaurant'' on the first evening,
two of our group (one a female) were greeted with steely stares. No,
they didn't serve dinner &MD; and this was a guy place, basically just a
bar. We would not spend much of our time exploring Meynes.
<p>
   But Meynes did have a little newsstand, several bakeries where we
would buy breakfast croissants to enjoy at the villa and a tiny store
just outside our gate that Please see VILLAS, L7 &QL;

offered some fresh produce and a few basic essentials (sort of a
7-Eleven, Meynes style). No shopping was necessary on check-in day, as
our host had thoughtfully put in bread, wine, cheese and pa &UR; te and a
big basket of Provencal vegetables. &HT;    The first order of business was settling in. So how do you allot
bedrooms of varying sizes and amenities and keep everyone happy? Our
FBI agent solved the dilemma with two packs of playing cards. Placing
a card in each room, he then asked the ``ladies'' to draw from
identical cards. Though most of us secretly hoped for the master
bedroom, which was roughly the size of a soccer field, everyone
professed to be happy with the luck of the draw. sg &QL;

   O ur first evening set the pattern for the week. At cocktail hour,
we gathered in one of several living rooms &MD; the one overlooking the
cherry orchard and the walled pool &MD; and brought out our duty-free
bottles. After a time someone suggested half-heartedly that we seek
out a restaurant nearby, but there was little enthusiasm for that
idea. When the kitchen cupboard yielded a package of pasta and some
olive oil, we were able to create pasta a la eggplant, onion and
tomatoes.
<p>
   After long days of touring, we more often than not opted to eat
``at home,'' sometimes feasting on roast chickens or lasagna, white
asparagus, sausages and cheese and crusty breads bought that afternoon
at market day in one of the nearby towns. Sitting around a big square
table in the dining room, we'd share the day's adventures and plan the
next day's.

   When Charles-Louis and Joel came for drinks on our last evening, we
learned the history of the villa. The oldest part, the pigeon
tower &MD; now an enclosed stairwell leading from the dining room to an
upstairs bedroom &MD; dates from the 16th century. The property was
originally a farm, and the main part of the house is 17th century.
Much later, it was an orphanage run by Catholic nuns (thus, Domaine
Amen). When the state took over care of its orphans after World War
II, the orphanage closed. The property sat vacant for 15 years;
squatters moved in and stole the fixtures.

<p>
   Twelve years ago, living in Toulon and looking for a peaceful place
for a home-atelier, Charles-Louis found the Domaine. Together, he and
Joel restored it. They added the pool &MD; in an area where the nuns once
laundered their habits and winged headdresses. They created a grand
dining room where once there were four small sleeping rooms for the
sisters. kern,2
<p>
   On reflection, our only regret is that we didn't spend more time
just hanging out at the villa. But there was so much to fit in &MD; market

by luck, the Provencal national choir also was lunching and treated us

   We walked the Van Gogh walk, visited the asylum where he was a

   We took beautiful drives through vineyards and valleys, to fabled
hilltop towns such as Les Baux and Fontvielle, to the picturesque
village of Seguret in the Vaucluse, a postcard of cobbled streets and
fountains.
<p>
   One night we were the only (very pampered) guests dining at Auberge
Escavarats, a charming restaurant in a centuries-old building in
Remoulins, the nearest town of any size to Meynes. Remoulins, it
should be noted, is also home to a Supermarche that, I confess, we
frequented for household basics. kern,2

   Our big splurge was a birthday celebration for one of our group.
Everyone got gussied up for once, and we made the 30-minute drive to

and creme bru &UR; lee, served by white-gloved waiters at the very
beautiful La Magnaneraie in a 15th century country house.

 &UR; Trans-Atlantic Cruise Market is Hardly Titanic &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``Titanic,'' the biggest-grossing movie in history, has countless
Americans day-dreaming about the romance of an old-fashioned cruise.
The cruise industry, riding a global boom, is building new ships as
fast as it can. And the Atlantic, the planet's second-largest ocean,
certainly has plenty of room. So the trans-Atlantic cruise business is
booming, right?
<p>
   Wrong. That great ocean remains, in a sense, the world's smallest
cruise market.
<p>
   It sustains only a single ship with regularly scheduled
trans-Atlantic crossings: Cunard's famed Queen Elizabeth 2, age 31,
capacity 1,715 passengers  &MD;  and the QE2 spends less than one-third of
its time on that itinerary.
<p>
   Every year, many ships carry passengers across the ocean as they
reposition themselves between winters in the Caribbean and summers in
the Mediterranean, but on the day  &MD;  whenever it comes  &MD;  when QE2 stops
regular trans-Atlantic service, experts say, a chapter in travel
history will close. With its broad decks and clubby interiors, the QE2
is one of the cruise industry's last links with the old-fashioned
luxury, the romanticism and the class system symbolized by the
Titanic. But icebergs are not a factor here. Technology, demographics
and corporate consolidations are.
<p>
   First, in the late 1950s, came the advent of daily passenger jet
service between the United States and Europe, which quickly stole away
most cruise ship customers. In the early 1970s came the rise of
Carnival Cruise Lines, which reinvented the industry by selling
cruises to the masses and, once you were outside of your cabin, making
virtually no class distinctions.
<p>
   Then on April 3 the old and new worlds of cruising met. The
relative upstart Carnival Corp. announced that it, with some Norwegian
minority partners, was buying venerated Cunard from its Norwegian
parent company for $500 million. Carnival officials said they would
merge Cunard with Seabourn Cruise Line (half owned by Carnival) to
form the world's largest luxury line.
<p>
   A Carnival spokesman said he expected no immediate changes in the
QE2's schedule, which calls for crossing the Atlantic 17 times this
year on six-day routes between New York and Southhampton, England, but
the owners aren't saying much more.
<p>
   Cunard officials aren't saying much, either, except to note that
thanks to the ship's thick hull, it has ``many, many good years of
sailing left.''
<p>
   But the Carnival purchase, along with the brisk sales for the QE2
around-the-world cruise that concludes next month, leads Cruise Week
newsletter editor Mike Driscoll to ponder ``a question mark in the
QE2's future. You have to wonder if they might be thinking of
(forsaking trans-Atlantic passages for) longer itineraries.'' And with
Carnival's wealth and willingness to build new ships, Driscoll points
out, there is now ``the possibility that there might be a QE3
somewhere down the line.''
<p>
   For now, however, the QE2 endures in a sort of twilight zone,
clinging to its traditional route for about 100 days a year while
newer ships jostle each other in the Caribbean, the Pacific coast of
Mexico, Alaska and the Mediterranean.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Aside from its point-to-point service, the QE2 is set apart by its
``cabin grades'' system, which directs passengers to specific dining
rooms based on what they've paid for their cabins. Only passengers in
the priciest cabins can dine in the Queens Grill and drink in the
Queens Grill Lounge. At the next level are those in the Princess and
Britannia grill restaurants, then those in the Caronia restaurant, and
finally those in the Mauretania restaurant, who, unlike their fellow
passengers, are assigned to either early or late seatings.
<p>
   Ties and jackets are expected on men in all dining rooms each
night, and on the three formal nights of a standard crossing, black
tie or dark business suits are requested. For those who rebel, the
ship does offer a casual cafe open to all.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   This year's first trans-Atlantic cruise leaves Southhampton this
week. The last arrives in New York Dec. 20. Twelve have themes  &MD; 
British theater; food and wine; and Atlantic cruise liner history, for
instance. Fares begin at about $400 per person per day, including
one-way coach air fare across the Atlantic.
<p>
   ``One of the things on everybody's list (of dream trips) is
crossing the Atlantic on the QE2. It just isn't the same crossing on
anything else. ... And I hope that that doesn't go away,'' says
Matthew Upchurch, a veteran of ``nine or 10'' QE2 crossings.
<p>
   Upchurch is managing principal of Fort Worth, Texas-based API
Travel Consultants, a consortium of about 200 luxury travel agencies
nationwide, and a major deliverer of customers to Cunard. Upchurch
speculates that the QE2 could easily sail for another two decades.
<p>
   ``She is the only North Atlantic express liner left  &MD;  what Cunard
started, Cunard will finish,'' wrote author John Maxtone-Graham of the
QE2 in a 1989 volume on Cunard's history.
<p>
   The QE2, christened by Queen Elizabeth II herself in 1967, carried
British troops to the Falklands War in 1982, and in 1987 switched from
a steam turbine engine to diesel-electric power. In 1994, a $45
million upgrade went awry when post-renovation passengers boarded to
find faulty plumbing and tradesmen still at work. But in the fall of
1996, after Cunard's parent company was bought out by the Norwegian
conglomerate Kvaerner ASA, the ship got a crucial vote of confidence:
an $18 million upgrade that brought it into compliance with recently
stiffened maritime Safety of Life at Sea codes.

 &UR; Eco-Friendly Scooters Let Tourists Get Around on Bermuda &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   It's no accident that people on motor scooters are heavily featured
in advertisements for Bermuda.
<p>
   That's because on this 22-mile-long island in the Atlantic, motor
scooters are a travel necessity  &MD;  there are no cars for rent.
<p>
   The ban on rental cars is part of the island's
environmental-preservation efforts, many developed before such
movements gained popularity in the United States. Other
environmentally friendly practices include limiting residents to one
car per household, as well as bans on outdoor advertising and neon
signs.
<p>
   So the scooters  &MD;  like motorcycles but smaller and easier to use  &MD; 
are the best way to see the pink-sand beaches, shopping districts and
major tourists attractions on the island.
<p>
   No driver's license is required to rent a scooter, which costs
about $30 to $45 a day depending on the size. But children under 16
cannot drive one of the motor-assisted cycles, and everyone is
required to wear safety helmets. Children may ride as passengers,
sitting behind the driver.
<p>
   Learning to ride a moped is not difficult. Brief instructions are
given by rental agents located throughout the island, and most hotels
and resorts can help you with reservations.
<p>
   A warning for American drivers: Bermuda is a British colony and
driving is done on the left side of the road. It takes some
concentration to stay in the proper lane, and right turns are
especially tricky.
<p>
   A key is used to start the motor. The motorbikes are propelled
forward with a hand throttle and stopped by using two hand brakes. The
scooters don't need to be locked like a bicycle; a kickstand sets the
moped in place, and a turn of the front wheel locks the scooter so it
can't be moved without the key.
<p>
   The seat on most bikes lifts for storage of valuables while driving
and is a handy place to store helmets when not in use.
<p>
   Still, if you don't like the thought of moped transportation, more
than 600 taxis, as well as buses, are available to cover the island's
approximately 150 miles of roads. So too are a few horse-drawn
carriages, as well as island ferries.
<p>
   Here are a few more tips when traveling to Bermuda:
<p>
    &MD; Passports are the preferred document for entry to the country.
Without a passport, proof of citizenship and identification are
required of all travelers, including children, and may be demonstrated
with a birth certificate  &MD;  with a raised seal or certified copy  &MD;  and
a driver's license.
<p>
    &MD; Legal tender is the Bermuda dollar, which is equal in value to the
U.S. dollar. This means that U.S. currency is accepted at shops,
restaurants and hotels at face value. Other foreign currency is not
accepted but may be exchanged at local banks. U.S. traveler's checks
are accepted almost everywhere, as are credit cards.
<p>
    &MD; The dress code on the island is conservative. Bathing suits,
cutoff tops and short shorts are not acceptable except at beaches and
pools. There are no nude or semi-nude beaches, and in public  &MD; 
including general-use areas of hotels  &MD;  beach wear must be covered.
Always wear shoes. The islanders consider it an offense to ride mopeds
or appear in public shirtless or without a shirt over one's bathing
suit top.

 &UR; TRAVEL TIPS: An April Shower of New Exhibits &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   April usually brings a shower of exhibit openings in the United
States and abroad, and this year is no exception. Some notable shows:
<p>
    &UR;  &MD; Memphis, Tenn.: &LR;  ``Ancestors of the Incas: The Lost Civilizations
of Peru,'' at the Memphis Pyramid, is billed as the largest exhibit of
Peruvian artifacts ever to travel to the United States. It includes
three mummies never seen outside Peru, and more than 300 artifacts
spanning 3,000 years. Thursday to Sept. 16. Information: (800)
263-6744.
<p>
    &UR;  &MD; Washington, D.C.: &LR;  ``Degas at the Races,'' at the National
Gallery of Art, is devoted to the French Impressionist's fascination
with horses. It includes more than 120 paintings, pastels, drawings
and sculpted figures. Through July 12. Information: (202) 737-4215.
<p>
    &UR;  &MD; London: &LR;  ``The Power of the Poster,'' at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, covers 120 years of posters by Toulouse-Lautrec, Aubrey
Beardsley, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and others drawn from the museum's
10,000-piece collection  &MD;  its largest such exhibit in six decades.
Through July 26. Information: 011-44-171-938-8349.
<p>
    &UR;  &MD; New York: &LR;  Three galleries devoted to Edward Hopper, Georgia
O'Keeffe and Alexander Caldwell are among eight newly opened in a
major expansion of the Whitney Museum of American Art. More than 100
works from the museum's permanent collection are displayed.
Information: (212) 570-3676.
<p>
   ``Paul Robeson: Bearer of a Culture,'' at the New-York Historical
Society, explores the life of the African American artist and activist
100 years after his birth. Through July 12. Information: (212)
873-3400. &QL;

<p>
   ROYAL APARTMENTS TO REOPEN IN LONDON: The Kensington Palace State
Apartments in London, which include paintings and furniture from the
royal collection, are scheduled to reopen May 1 after being closed
since September 1997 for renovation. Also starting May 1, the royal
ceremonial dress collection, which includes the 1893 wedding dress of
Queen Mary and several dresses of Queen Elizabeth II, will be
displayed in the palace. Palace admission is about $13 for adults;
lower rates for children and seniors. Information: (800) 806-7187. &QL;

   YOSEMITE LODGING TIGHT FOR SUMMER: Getting a place to stay
overnight at Yosemite National Park this summer is expected to be
especially tough. While heavier-than-usual precipitation continues to
feed the famous falls, offering hope for an exceptionally scenic
season, there are 44 percent fewer campsites and 15 percent fewer
hotel rooms than there were two years ago. The reason: The park still
hasn't rebuilt lodging damaged by January 1997 floods.
<p>
   Yosemite spokesman Kendell Thompson said last week that
construction can't begin until the park's long-term development plan,
which is still being revised, is approved. Best bets for now: Reserve
early, go off-season or consider lodging outside the park. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   ONE-STOP SHOPPING FOR MAYAN TOURS: An unusual alliance of eight
private travel agencies in five countries, aided by Continental
Airlines, is creating ``one-stop shopping'' for travelers interested
in exploring Mayan ruins throughout Central America.
<p>
   Working through Gurnee, Ill.-based MILA, a 17-year-old cultural
tour agency, tourists and travel agents can call a toll-free number,
(800) 367-7378,
<p>
   to design individual or group itineraries involving any or all of
five countries: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Belize.
MILA President C. Luis Vasquez said daily land costs for the ``Maya
Path Adventures'' program are about $120 to $140 per person, double
occupancy. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   TRAVELER'S NOTE ...: Starting April 29, twice-weekly flights to
remote Midway Atoll, the former military site that opened to tourists
in 1996, begin leaving from Honolulu rather than Kauai, and round-trip
air fare drops to $750 from $1,049. Reservations: (888) 574-9000.  &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   DEAL OF THE WEEK: The Breakers, a AAA Five-Diamond and Mobil
Five-Star resort in Palm Beach, Fla., is offering credit vouchers for
$200 worth of golf or other sports from May 26 through Sept. 30. The
``Oceanfront Getaway'' deal costs $163.90 per night Sunday through
Wednesday and $176 Thursday through Saturday, single or double
occupancy, including tax; there is a two-night minimum.
<p>
   The deal includes a room, normally priced at $176, plus the $200
credit  &MD;  more than enough for two rounds of golf ($85 per round, with
cart). The credit also can be applied to tennis, fitness center
admission and cabana or bicycle rentals. Up to two children 16 and
under can stay free in the room. The average summer high at the
oceanfront resort is 91 degrees. The resort includes 572 rooms, two
golf courses and 14 tennis courts. Reservations: (888) 273-2537. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   FREE FOR THE ASKING: Highlights of 360 miles of U.S. Highway 101 in
Oregon, from Astoria south to Brookings, are profiled in a new
brochure, ``Pacific Coast Scenic Byway.'' Sights include sand dunes,
redwoods, cranberry bogs, a shipwreck and the West's largest cheese
factory. To order, contact the nonprofit Oregon Coast Visitors
Association, P.O. Box 74, Newport, OR 97365; tel. (888) 628-2101.  &QL;

 &UR; Young Mongolian Riders Kick Up Dust of Ancient Times (Ulan Bator) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia  &MD;  You have to rise early to beat the horses.
<p>
   Very early.
<p>
   We're already up and out by 5:30 a.m., walking in the predawn haze
through a tent city at the base of a sweeping mountainside. The camp
is stirring, and soft voices and the gentle whinny of horses float
among the tents. In the distance, beyond the low smoke of cook-fires
and the tethered horses, we can see a small grandstand, and, facing
the grandstand from 50 feet away, a short wooden observation tower.
<p>
   This is where the day will really begin when, in about an hour,
about 400 horses and their young riders move from the camp to the
tower, then on to a nearby ridge. Then, when all the horses have
gathered, they will trot en masse 15 miles out from the city, turn
around and, at the sound of a gunshot, sprint back to this little
wooden tower.
<p>
   That cold recitation does little to brace us for how all this
actually transpires.
<p>
   This is Naadam, the ancient Mongolian festival codified into a
national holiday after Mongolia's successful fight in 1921, with the
help of the Russian Red Army, for independence from China. Held every
July 9-11, the festival centers on the traditional Mongolian sports of
wrestling, archery and horse riding.
<p>
   But it is the spectacle of children racing horses that has brought
us to this camp at the crack of dawn, for the first of three days of
such races.
<p>
   A Los Angeles Times photographer and I were in Mongolia to cover a
group of Los Angeles-based physicians who traveled here to help
Mongolian doctors improve medical care. The doctors' visit coincided
with Naadam, so the photographer, Gail Fisher, and I decided to take
in the festivities with them.
<p>
   We began with a few days in a tourist camp of ``gers''  &MD;  portable
felt-and-canvas huts known to most of us by the Russian name,
``yurts''  &MD;  before moving on to Ulan Bator and the Naadam festival,
with other side trips planned during the two-week visit. Most
travelers come to Mongolia with tour groups, and ours was arranged by
the Ulan Bator Foundation of the Venice district of Los Angeles, which
also put together the medical mission. But it's also possible to make
independent travel plans.
<p>
   Given the decades of Soviet domination of Mongolia, English is not
widely spoken, so hiring a driver and interpreter makes a huge
difference in both freedom and comprehension. We lucked out by getting
a fellow named Sodh, a hydrologist with passable English skills and a
pleasing sense of humor who seemed to know everyone in the country .
<p>
   As significant as Naadam is for Mongolians, its informality is
refreshing. Tickets ($25 a day for foreigners) are required for the
opening and closing ceremonies, and to watch the wrestling. Those
events take place in the National Stadium, which is surrounded for the
three days by vendors hawking everything from soft drinks to maps. No
tickets are required for the archery competition  &MD;  with both men's and
women's divisions  &MD;  which is held just outside the stadium.
<p>
   The horse races take place at the city's edge and involve both
girls and boys. You can buy grandstand tickets, but you really don't
need to because the best views are from ground level.
<p>
   We cross the dusty grasslands from the camp and step beneath the
wooden observation tower, which will later serve as the finish line.
<p>
   Then the swirl begins.
<p>
   For more than an hour the horses enter the grounds, singly and in
groups, circling the observation stand as the riders  &MD;  children
between 4 and 11 years old  &MD;  chant the traditional song ``Guiin Goo''
for luck and inspiration before riding off to a staging area atop a
nearby ridge. It is pure bedlam, a carnival of billowing dust and
snorting horses and the light, excited voices of youth.
<p>
   The children must be strong enough to race 15 miles, and light
enough to ride quickly. Most of the riders are in saddles  &MD;  a
Mongolian type that keeps the rider leaning forward  &MD;  but many ride
bareback. All are dressed in traditional robes of deep red or vibrant
yellow or mixtures somewhere in between. Few ride alone. Fathers and
brothers and uncles trot alongside, slowly swelling the group at the
staging area to more than 2,000 horses.
<p>
   From a distance, it looks like the return of Genghis Khan's
thundering hordes.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Tourism exists as a nascent capitalist dream here, with rudimentary
accommodations and the occasional upscale hotel in the capital, Ulan
Bator, and little available elsewhere. A former Soviet satellite
(Mongolia was the second nation, in 1921, to undergo a Communist
revolution, opening the door to Soviet domination just after
Mongolians won independence from China), Mongolia has only welcomed
tourists for about the last five years, and the nation's lack of
creature comforts only adds to the mystique.
<p>
   Our group's visit was limited to the regions just outside Ulan
Bator, though smaller Naadam festivals are held outside the capital in
the ``aymags,'' or regional centers. Ulan Bator is the easiest way
into the country, but easy is a relative term. International flights
connect from Beijing, Moscow or Osaka, Japan. We flew from Beijing .
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   For our first few nights of our visit we stayed at the Undur Dov
ger camp 40 miles from Ulan Bator. Out here, the city gives way
quickly to vast sweeps of emptiness, wide valleys defined by sloping
brown hills covered with a light green fuzz of grass and occasional
stands of larch and birch trees.
<p>
   Such views suck you into the middle of them. Or to the top. Gail
and I and four others from the doctors group climbed the deceivingly
low hill behind the camp and were rewarded with stunning views of
steppes and sloping hills stretching as far as the eye can see, dotted
with gers (real ones, not tourist huts) and crisscrossed with dirt
pathways traversed by horses and Russian four-wheel-drive vehicles,
the country's two main modes of transportation.
<p>
   After two days in the countryside, we shifted our base to Ulan
Bator's twin-towered Bayangol Hotel, easing life a bit. The hotel has
three restaurants, one on the main floor that was marked by slow
service and uninspired food. But the two small restaurants in the
towers were much better: quicker service, more reliable quality and an
intimate European atmosphere.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   There are other equally satisfying spots around town. The White
House Hotel has a restaurant on the first floor and an English
pub-style jazz club and bar upstairs. The Capital, owned by a woman
from Cameroon, serves a mix of African and Continental dishes.
<p>
   We spent one day sightseeing in the capital. The national Museum of
Fine Arts was limited but pleasant, with some nice examples of
Mongolian paintings and sculpture going back several centuries. The
Gandan Buddhist monastery and the Bogd Khan Palace, home of the last
khan, were subtly intriguing, enhanced, oddly enough, by their
down-at-the-heels condition.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   It was horses that formed the trip's most memorable moments. In
many cultures, traditions are sustained as relics, marketed examples
of the way things once were. There's a touch of that in the horse
races of Naadam too. But in a land where half the country still leads
semi-nomadic lives  &MD;  following herds of sheep, goats, cattle and yaks
 &MD;  a cross-country race represents skills still nurtured for use, not
for nostalgia.
<p>
   It is a harsh race. From the start there is jostling and flailing
of whips, stumbling and occasional falls. During the weekend, about 20
horses died from the heat  &MD;  over 100 degrees in midafternoon  &MD;  and
scores of young riders suffered injuries, though it was not clear that
any were serious.
<p>
   The view from the finish line is intense. In the distance a thin
cloud of dust appears on the horizon, then grows as the pack moves
closer, hooves pounding the turf with a distant rumble. The pace car  &MD; 
a Russian vehicle  &MD;  bounces over the ridge first, careening wildly,
quickly followed by the horses, spread out at intervals of several
yards.
<p>
   As the lead horses near the finish line, the growing thunder of
hooves merges with the cheers of the crowd, several thousand strong
now. The winning rider, who looks to be about 8 years old, flashes
across the line standing high in his stirrups, right hand triumphantly
pumping above his head before he is swallowed by the crowd arrayed in
a semicircle beyond the finish line.
<p>
   It is a magical, and timeless, moment.

 &UR; Live and Learn: Travel Horror Stories Are Precautionary Tales &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A vacation means different things to different people. Warm, sandy
beaches. Snow-covered ski slopes. Museums, bike-riding, amusement
parks or a cruise.
<p>
   But no matter your choice of escape, nothing is more frustrating
than when something goes wrong. Your luggage is lost, your flight
canceled, your ``luxury hotel with a beach view'' proves to be nothing
more than a fleabag motel. Or worse.
<p>
   Here, some Connecticut residents share their travel horror stories,
with advice on how you might avoid their mishaps.

   JAMMED IN JAMAICA: Marie Hamilton was searching for a warm vacation
destination for herself and her husband last summer when she came
across pictures of a villa for rent in Jamaica. The description  &MD;  four
bedrooms, a private swimming pool, tennis courts, a housekeeper and
cook  &MD;  was too much to resist, Hamilton said, and they were soon on
their way.
<p>
   Their odyssey began after they refused the first rental car offered
by the agency because the tires were bald. They accepted the second
car even though it came with no gas. The couple left the airport and
headed straight to a gas station, which is where, she said, a man
reached into the car window and took more than $200 from her purse.
<p>
   Shaken but undaunted, the Hamiltons continued to their rented
house.
<p>
   ``But an hour later,'' Hamilton said, ``we hit a pothole.''
<p>
   The couple called the villa asking for assistance, but before help
arrived, two men approached the car and demanded money. They turned
over $100 and were about to give more when an employee from the resort
finally arrived, swinging a metal bat, Hamilton said.
<p>
   Nine hours after landing, the Hamiltons finally arrived at their
resort.
<p>
   ``At first glance the villa, bathed in candlelight and looking very
lovely and comforting, took our breath away,'' Marie said.
<p>
   But then the electricity went out. A 4-inch-thick foam mattress on
a wooden box served as the bed. At the resort's main dinning area,
``all the furniture was rotted, and there were chairs without backs.
When you pay resort prices, you do not expect to see wrought-iron
furniture without bottoms, shredded shower mats or patches on the
sheets.
<p>
   ``But we thought, `Oh well. At least the sun is shining.' ''
<p>
   It rained for the next seven days.
<p>
   When they finally decided to abandon their vacation, the Hamiltons
found more problems with the car rental agency, which claimed they had
damaged the car when they hit the pothole. They were forced to pay
$580 (a fee they are still disputing).
<p>
   Solution: Before putting money down on any vacation, do more than
just glance at a brochure. Talk to a friend for recommendations, or
book through a travel agent who is not only familiar with a resort
company, but who also has actually visited the location. Travel books
offering critiques also may help.
<p>
   Pay with a credit card, not a debit card, check or cash, so you can
appeal to the credit company if you are unsatisfied with the
accommodations.
<p>
   Travel agents also recommend learning about the area you are
visiting, especially when it is a foreign country. The car rental
company that the Hamiltons used is well respected in the United
States, ``but all rules are different once you are out of this
country,'' Hamilton said.

   I NEED AN ID: Ginny Cormier knew she had made a mistake as soon as
she arrived at the airport.
<p>
   ``The clerk said, `May I see your photo ID?' and my face fell,''
said Cormier, 71, who was heading to Utah last year for a ski
vacation. ``I knew immediately that I didn't have it.''
<p>
   Not only did Cormier arrive without her driver's license, but she
also had absolutely no form of identification. Cormier said it wasn't
until the next day that she was able to get a seat on another flight.
<p>
   Because of the delay, she also had to make calls to Utah to change
reservations at her hotel, car rental agency and a restaurant.
<p>
   Solution: Cormier broke a cardinal rule of travel in a world where
airports are increasing security. Always carry a photo ID  &MD;  airlines
prefer a driver's license, state photo identification card or a
passport. Other restrictions apply to luggage and airline tickets.

   MONEY TAKES A HIKE: Teresa and Ray Dorsey were traveling in Ireland
about five years ago when they decided to take a walk on a beach near
their hotel in Bundoran.
<p>
   ``You don't want to be laden down with a pocketbook and all that,
so I left everything in the hotel room,'' said Teresa Dorsey, a
teacher.
<p>
   It wasn't until the next morning when they were gathering their
belongings for the day that the couple noticed Teresa's purse had been
disturbed.
<p>
   ``She didn't touch my credit cards,'' Dorsey said of the maid
suspected of the theft. ``Just the money. All of it.''
<p>
   The couple filed a police report for the missing funds, about $300,
but no one was arrested and they never recovered the money. Dorsey
said she feels fortunate that the theft occurred toward the end of the
trip so their loss was limited.
<p>
   Solution: Never leave anything of value unattended, whether in a
hotel, restaurant, airplane, taxi, or even while taking a swim at the
beach.
<p>
   Use hotel-room safes, or safety-deposit boxes, to secure your most
valuable items.

   LONG DAY'S JOURNEY: Nicholas Reut was returning with his wife and
two children from a vacation in the Bahamas last year when their
travel plans hit a snag.
<p>
   When their flight to Miami was delayed  &MD;  Reut says from overbooking
 &MD;  the family missed their connecting flight, to Hartford, resulting in
an unexpected overnight stay in the city when no other flights were
available.
<p>
   The next day, Easter Sunday, they returned to the airport after
less than six hours of sleep and learned that their flight  &MD;  this time
with an added stop in New York  &MD;  was again delayed, and by the time
they arrived at Kennedy Airport, they had missed another plane.
<p>
   Three hours later, they finally boarded a flight for Hartford.
<p>
   In all, it took the family more than 24 hours to arrive home in
what should have been a four-hour trip.
<p>
   Reut, unhappy with the response from the airline, took his case to
an attorney, who demanded compensation from the airline.
<p>
   The airline sent the Reuts a $400 travel voucher for use on future
flights, and a letter of apology.
<p>
   Most major airlines do not offer compensation to customers if the
delay is caused by the weather. If the delay is caused by overbooking
or a mechanical problem, the companies will provide meal vouchers for
the airport, as well as compensation for overnight hotel
accommodations when necessary.
<p>
   Airlines also offer travel vouchers good for use on future flights
for those ``bumped'' off overbooked flights.
<p>
   Solution: Demand these services at the airport; don't expect to be
reimbursed later for out-of-pocket expenses. If the first employee you
talk to denies your request, ask to speak to a supervisor until you
are satisfied.

   SAUSALITO, Calif.  &MD;  The weather was awful, but I went anyway  &MD;  to
spend one of El Nino's most ferocious weekends here on the theory that
not every getaway may be sunlight and rosebuds, but can still be an
adventure.
<p>
   Sausalito is fabled as a cultural never-never land, both light
years ahead and decades behind. Where else can an hourlong flight from
Burbank take you back 30 years? I walked in on a conversation in a
jewelry shop just in time to hear a retro-haired clerk telling a
friend, ``Well, he used to play drums in Jimi Hendrix's band.''
<p>
   My weekend home base, the Hotel Sausalito, is a great place to
cuddle up, whether for reasons of rain or romance. The 1915 building
that was once reputedly a bordello was extensively remodeled last year
in a ``French Riviera'' style, in keeping with this city on what some
call the Northern California Riviera.
<p>
   Now run by a Scottish couple who enlivened my stay with their
off-kilter Glasgow wit, the hotel and its 16 rooms and suites ($125 to
$250) are themselves enlivened by the work of San Rafael designer
Linda Applewhite. She cozied up the place with warmly patinated terra
cotta apricots and pinks and ochres  &MD;  but not a speck of blue,
because, as Applewhite notes, blue is the color of the hotel's
star-turn, the ocean waters of Richardson Bay.
<p>
   I had brought some work with me, but even though the good-size
desktop had a phone and computer port, I hunkered down in the cloud of
a bed for a while, writing as the rain soughed outside my windows.
Having splurged on an outside corner room, I could look across to the
small park and the ferryboat landing where legend holds that bootleg
liquor was smuggled in the 1920s. I could look down and see the dark
roots of rain-drenched blond joggers.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   On the theory that a piece of the pleasure of a weekend getaway is
a gorgeous bathroom you don't have to clean, the Hotel Sausalito did
it right  &MD;  an un-European bath with a glassed-in shower so large it
would rent for $900 a month in Manhattan, and a pottery-framed mirror
studded with iridescent chunks of glass.
<p>
   In short, these are rooms that beg for a 48-hour ``Do Not Disturb''
sign. But then, I was traveling solo  &MD;  and Sausalito awaited.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Like Marin County itself, Sausalito labors under an easy-to-lampoon
reputation for the touchy-feely and self-absorbed. The Whole Earth
Catalog has been published here for 30 years. It was in a Sausalito
eatery that, in 1982, a writer scribbled on a place mat what would
become a bumper-sticker mantra: ``Practice random kindness and
senseless acts of beauty.''
<p>
   Millions of people see this town in fine-weather events such as its
Labor Day arts festival. But I stamped through rain puddles like a
5-year-old to explore. I splashed along the water's edge, past bobbing
houseboats, home to writers and funky folks. Est founder Werner Erhard
lived aboard a yacht here. In a quirky way, I was relieved that the
rain prompted many merchants to close early on Saturday, because my
absolute belief is that when you're out of town, you cannot spend real
money or gain real weight.
<p>
   In fairer weather, I would have spent a lot more unreal money, for
besides its art-haven reputation, Sausalito is GHQ for charming and
marginally useful bibelots.
<p>
   As for gaining real weight  &MD;  on a Saturday afternoon, you can lurch
from coffeehouse to pastry shop to sandwich bistro. I slid into the
waterfront Sausalito Bakery &AMP; Cafe for spanakopita and Greek salad,
sharing the premises with an old man who looked like Greta Garbo's
father in ``Anna Christie'' and an old woman who looked like the
tweedy ornithologist in ``The Birds.''
<p>
   The San Francisco Bay area twilight was brilliant in the reflected
rain, but it deprived me of an hour's reading on the hotel's now rainy
terrace. So, what the heck, I dined: at Angelino's, another restaurant
on waterfront Bridgeway street, where the bread is homemade and every
dish carried past my table  &MD;  the petrale sole, the steamed mussels  &MD; 
was fragrant and lovely. But so too was my gnocchi.
<p>
   If gawking expended calories, a visitor could come home a few
pounds lighter. The vistas, even between storm clouds, are superb, and
the higher up you climb, the better they get.
<p>
   I passed on the hotel's complimentary pastry-and-coffee breakfast
next door at Caffe Tutti and ascended the hill to the Alta Mira hotel
and restaurant, where the brunch  &MD;  mark the cinnamon eggnog French
toast, and the crab and shrimp omelet with champagne caviar sauce  &MD; 
makes you wish every weekend had two Sundays. Afterward, I went
strolling in the rain, along streets twining among lichen-dappled
trees, admiring gardens of calla lilies and hyacinths, walking for
hours, until I ran out of hillside and then doubling back to the
hotel.
<p>
   What Southern California forfeits by its fine weather is the luxury
of getting out of wet clothes and into a dry martini, as Robert
Benchley said, or a heap of warm bedding with a good book and nothing
to do until ... dinner. A friend wanted to go to a Mexican restaurant
in Tiburon. It had better be good, I warned her; this was like taking
Newcastle to the coals. (Guaymas lived up to its billing. The menu  &MD; 
poached octopus cocktail instead of shrimp, marinated cactus strip and
onion salad  &MD;  was a great Marin spin on Mexican.)
<p>
   So I defied El Nino, and won. The only regret about the weekend was
that the flight home was right on time.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Ever since the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians,
pro-peace Americans and American Jews have deceived themselves into
thinking that they no longer had to push much for the peace process.
Even after right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began to
unravel the process by expanding West Bank settlements and refusing to
implement Oslo, many of us imagined that President Clinton would
eventually push the process back on course.
<p>
   Last week that fantasy was dispelled when the American-Israel
Public Affairs Committee, the powerful legislative arm of the Israel
lobby, managed to get 80 U.S. senators to sign a letter to Clinton
urging him to not go public with his proposals.
<p>
   AIPAC has long had the reputation of being one of the most powerful
lobbies in the United States because it is able to persuade many
elected officials that the American Jewish community will only support
the electoral efforts by those deemed ``pro-Israel''  &MD;  operationally
defined by them as meaning you do not oppose the policies of the
current Israeli government. By that definition, you can't be
pro-Israel if you are publicly pressuring Israel to move toward peace.
<p>
   Not that what Clinton proposes would have constituted a serious
move toward peace. With AIPAC allies like Al Gore already shaping the
Middle East agenda from within, the administration was not likely to
put forward any plan that would give the Palestinians the one thing
that could actually end the struggle: a state that is economically and
politically viable. Yet even the watered-down proposals of the Clinton
administration proved too incendiary for the Israel lobby.
<p>
   Inside the White House a powerful battle has ensued. On the one
hand, those who are really friends of Israel (and who understand that
Israel's long-term interests are better served by the withdrawal from
the West Bank outlined in the Oslo treaty than by the rejectionism of
Netanyahu) point out that most polls indicate that a majority of
American Jews strongly support the peace process.
<p>
   AIPAC supporters, however, have a powerful response: ``The majority
who support peace don't care enough about this issue to mobilize
politically, whereas the minority who support Netanyahu care so
fanatically that they are willing to use all their political and
economic resources against anyone who bucks them.'' They have a point.
The fact is that the major institutions of Jewish life in America are
controlled either by people who are opposed to putting pressure on
Netanyahu, or people who believe that their organizations should stay
neutral and just celebrate Israel's many accomplishments as the Jewish
world moves into the season of Israel's 50th anniversary.
<p>
   Of course, in the real world of politics, this neutrality, not
wanting to ``politicize'' the 50th anniversary celebration, is
actually a vote for the status quo. The AIPAC crowd can point to the
outpouring of support for ``Israel at 50'' and warn elected officials
that these sentiments can easily be mobilized into political trouble
should they be labeled ``unfriendly to Israel'' by the Israel lobby.
<p>
   Most American Jews are not affiliated with these organizations, but
they have failed to create alternative institutions. Many have been so
alienated by the Jewish world, and so angry at being labeled
``self-hating'' when they dared to raise questions about Israeli
policy, that they've voted with their feet, simply walking away from
Jewish affiliation.
<p>
   The pro-peace forces inside the administration and Congress need to
see something more than polls  &MD;  they need to feel the active support
of a pro-peace movement in the Jewish world. One first step is this:
Instead of passively participating in ``Israel at 50'' celebrations
that are interpreted as blanket support for current Israeli policies,
pro-peace forces could be creating alternative celebrations whose main
focus is ``honor the peacemakers, the forces of reconciliation and
religious pluralism in Israel.''
<p>
   In every community there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people
who, by speaking out against the Israeli lobby, have potentially
endangered their jobs, their relationships with customers or clients
or friends and family members. It is these ``little heroes'' that
should be the focus of our celebration in the coming months.
<p>
   Until these kinds of activities take place and are given media
visibility, AIPAC and the Jewish right will continue to intimidate the
White House and mobilize mass support in Congress for actions whose
ultimate impact is to prolong the occupation, make terrorism more
likely and ultimately undermine Israel and the Jewish people.

<TEXT>
<p>
   We're now told that the Justice Department won't prosecute Mark
Fuhrman for any of the crimes he may have committed with the Los
Angeles Police Department. Allegations that he assaulted minorities
while employed by the Police Department are blocked, not by a lack of
evidence, but by the statute of limitations. While Fuhrman cannot be
prosecuted in the courts, he ought to be prosecuted in the court of
public opinion. Therefore, I believe the LAPD and the Department of
Justice should disclose Fuhrman's police records. The public needs a
better understanding of police misconduct against minorities. The
documents in his file may spur a debate relating to how an officer can
have a file containing numerous complaints of misconduct against
minorities and still be promoted through the ranks.
<p>
   It is clear the LAPD has a dual standard. In my case, the police
were quick to leak false information, lies and rumors to sway public
opinion against me. However, when the LAPD had to deal with a
situation against one of their own, such as two lawsuits against
Fuhrman, they were quick to settle the cases to keep the files closed.
Taxpayers were forced to pay for these settlements, though they were
not even aware of the wrongs that were being redressed. This is not
right. Recently, the outrage of women's groups forced the LAPD to
identify police officers guilty of domestic violence. Historically,
these files had been closed to the public.
<p>
   Minorities have been the victims of excessive force and unlawful
arrest. They have the right to expect that police officers guilty of
such misconduct under color of authority will not be permitted to
continue patrolling the streets of Los Angeles.
<p>
   Disclose the files. Failure to do so obstructs the truth,
interferes with justice and encourages deception.

<p>
   ``Primary Colors'' is upon us, a $100 million cinematic wet blanket
with as obvious a political agenda as any film Hollywood has ever
produced. Joe Klein, author of the bitingly sardonic novel on which
the movie is based, acknowledges the film is clearly softer on the
Clintons  &MD;  excuse me, the Stantons  &MD;  than his original conception.
<p>
   It's no surprise that the president's press boosters have seized on
``Primary Colors'' as the pop culture rationale and apologia for Bill
Clinton, all making the point that Clintonism, warts and all, is as
good as it gets. Forget the road not taken. But what director Mike
Nichols, a Clinton friend, calls the movie's defining moral dilemma is
an utterly fraudulent conceit.
<p>
   The setup is in keeping with the movie's message that Clinton's
corruptions are more casual than profound. The candidate's old friend
and chief covert operative, played as a lovable lunatic by Kathy
Bates, focuses only on controlling information about his womanizing.
She practically stumbles onto evidence of his chief opponent's past
cocaine addiction and dalliance with homosexuality. Frightfully
depressed by the Bill and Hillary characters' amusingly immediate
decision to use the material to smear the other candidate  &MD;  their only
question is which newspaper to use  &MD;  she kills herself. This shocks
them into doing the right thing, which is to tell the opponent of the
damaging information available on him, allowing him to gracefully
withdraw.
<p>
   Unfortunately for the moviemakers, not to mention America, this is
not at all how the Clintons operate. For the Clintons have used
private investigators, secretly, for purposes well beyond the
previously acknowledged suppression of ``bimbo eruptions.'' Indeed,
the chief strategist of Clinton's 1996 campaign, Dick Morris,
declares: ``There's a kind of secret police going on here that goes
back to the 1992 Democratic primary campaign that's simply revolting.
It is absolutely chilling.''
<p>
   No other Democrat in my memory has made such extensive use of
investigative firms, in part because of the expense, in part because
so many Democrats disdain the cult of intelligence. And yet the
Clinton team has been at it throughout this decade and possibly
longer, easily predating today's arguably self-defensive efforts
against the ``vast right-wing conspiracy.''
<p>
   A principal figure in this secret operation is Terry Lenzner, one
of the most powerful and dreaded private investigators in the world.
His distortions, detailed by Vanity Fair in 1996, were used to smear
tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand. Contrary to White House claims,
Lenzner's work for Clinton  &MD;  which includes the at-first-denied
investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  &MD;  did not begin in
1994 with the Whitewater case.
<p>
   In reality, Lenzner's work for Clinton goes back at least to 1991.
During then-Gov. Clinton's campaign for the 1992 Democratic
presidential nomination, Lenzner investigated then-New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo (Clinton's most feared potential rival), former California Gov.
Jerry Brown (his most troublesome actual rival) and others, according
to sources in the Clinton campaign and others involved with Lenzner
investigative activities.
<p>
   Chief 1992 Clinton campaign strategist James Carville disclaims
knowledge of Lenzner's work. But national campaign chairman Mickey
Kantor, then a Los Angeles lawyer and now coordinator of Clinton's
scandal suppression team, says he is a Lenzner friend of 30 years
standing.
<p>
   According to a Clinton source, all of Kantor's communications with
Clinton during the 1992 campaign were covered by attorney-client
privilege, an unusual arrangement for a top campaign official. This
privilege, of course, provides a useful shield for today's
``plumbing'' work, preventing Starr from calling Kantor before a
Washington grand jury.
<p>
   Who has paid for the operation remains unclear. But what is clear
is that now it extends into the government. Raymond Kelly, a former
partner of Lenzner, is undersecretary of the treasury for enforcement.
In that capacity, Kelly oversees a raft of federal security
operations, including the Secret Service. He has opposed allowing
agents to testify before the grand jury in the current investigation
and pushed for the White House plan to give the Secret Service a major
role in counterterrorism, moving beyond its executive protection
function to partly supplant the FBI.
<p>
   These are the makings of a good movie; just not the one that's in
theaters now. Too bad it's not fiction.

 &UR; Not All Suffering Can Be Erased &QL; 
 &UR; Callahan, of the Hastings Center, is author of ``False Hopes: Why &QL; 
 &UR; America's Quest for Perfect Health is a Recipe for Failure.'' &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Few causes or crusades have such universal support as medicine's
war against suffering. None of us wants to be sick or to be in pain.
Most people do not want to die. Yet we rarely ask when enough is
enough in waging that war.
<p>
   At the extreme, almost everyone deplores the end-of-life killings
allegedly confessed to, though later denied, by a respiratory
therapist at Glendale Adventist Medical Center in Glendale, Calif. Let
us assume, kindly, that such killings occur when the killer cannot
bear watching people die, some of them perhaps miserably. The legal
requirement of informed consent to terminate life-sustaining care for
the terminally ill may seem at times a lesser moral demand than the
need to stop the suffering. Such reasoning would still be condemned
because it violates the rights of the patient to decide when life
support should end.
<p>
   But we can't be terribly surprised. There is a connection between
modern medicine's impossible quest for perfect health for all and the
way suffering is demonized as the worst of human evils. We should
hardly be surprised that moral boundaries will be breached on occasion
and, with increasing frequency, overcome.
<p>
   Perhaps the most subtle damage done by medicine's crusade for
perfection, egged on by an eager public, is that it has made it almost
impossible for people to find any meaning in suffering. Medicine
treats death and suffering as accidents, one day to be overcome by
research and the momentum of progress. The palliative care and hospice
movements offer an effective antidote to that attitude  &MD;  and indeed
help many people find some meaning in their suffering  &MD;  but they are
hardly sufficient.
<p>
   Modern medicine has set no limits to the battle against suffering
(which is a different issue than pain relief alone) constantly
escalating the war against it in the name of medical progress. This is
evident in the recent history of biomedical research and health care
spending.
<p>
   Biomedical research  &MD;  nicely symbolized by the research agenda of
the National Institutes of Health  &MD;  has set its face against every
medical evil: disease, disability, death. While many compassionate
doctors are working hard to help people to accept death as an
inevitable part of life, the research juggernaut resists. It has
targeted death and illness as horrors to be implacably fought. The
proposal in an otherwise tightfisted Congress to double the NIH budget
over the next five years  &MD;  from $13 billion to $26 billion  &MD;  is ample
testimony to the political popularity of the war against medical
suffering.
<p>
   Health care spending in the United States  &MD;  14 percent of our GNP
and $1 trillion a year  &MD;  far more per capita than any other country,
displays a comparable syndrome. No matter how much health status
improves in this country  &MD;  it is now at an all-time high  &MD;  it is never
good enough. There is no such thing in medicine as ``good enough.''
Progress begets progress, ever raising the standards for what counts
as good health. When the 19th century union leader Samuel Gompers was
asked what labor wanted, he had a simple answer: ``More.'' That seems
to be the medical motto also.
<p>
   Am I saying that we should just accept the suffering of cancer or
arthritis or Alzheimer's or infertility? Not at all. They mar the
human condition and they bring human misery. I recently had a cancer
scare and it wasn't nice, nor am I much enthused by my mild, but
inexorably progressing, emphysema. But I am saying that the crusade
against any and all suffering can itself turn sour.
<p>
   While few will want to go as far as furtive injections of lethal
drugs or pinching the air hoses of the helpless, it can and has led us
to spend too much money, too inefficiently and too ineffectively, on
the always escalating cost of technological innovation. The crusade
has made it harder for Americans to come to grips with death and the
suffering that can sometimes accompany it. For if suffering cannot be
relieved by medicine and if suffering is taken to be utterly evil,
then why not turn to physician-assisted suicide? Through religious and
philosophical traditions, many of which are being drawn upon in
hospice settings, meaning can be found in suffering, even if the
suffering cannot be fully relieved.
<p>
   We would be much more fully served by a practice of medicine that
knew its own limits in triumphing over suffering  &MD;  limits to the
benefits of research, limits to the struggle against death, limits to
relieving our pain and misery. Medicine has offered us many benefits
but also many false hopes. If we could learn to say that enough is
enough, we might open the way to a fresh exploration of human
suffering. We might bring medicine back to a better balance between
the desperate search for cures and the enduring human need for care
and comfort.

<p>
   By 1993, the Islamic Salvation Front had galvanized a wide and
popular Algerian base of support and was expected to win elections.
The Arab street, a popular and growing force of public opinion and
nonmilitant resistance, had expressed desire for political change. Had
the will of the people been allowed to take its course democratically,
the world would have seen a different political landscape in Algeria.
<p>
   Instead, more than 60,000 people have reportedly died in the civil
war between the government and the Islamic opposition since the voided
1993 election. In more recent developments, many innocent Algerian
civilians in villages  &MD;  mostly women and children  &MD;  have been killed
in brutal attacks blamed on Islamic groups. There is a clear need for
human rights groups and the United Nations to take active roles in
seeking to halt such atrocities. The United States has a
responsibility to ease regional tensions that contribute strongly to
the local instabilities by, for example, putting pressure on Israel to
comply with peace agreements and U.N. resolutions. It must also end
sanctions against Iraq, which have caused human suffering and
bitterness in the region.
<p>
   For members of Islamic groups to engage in senseless brutalities
contradicts patterns of resistance consistent throughout the Arab
world among similar organizations. It is also contrary to common
sense. After all, the victims in Algeria's case are the attackers' own
mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. Why should Islamic groups
challenging local undemocratic regimes and simultaneously
destabilizing postcolonial forces unleash their anger on their own
families? In the past six years, more than 3,700 women were killed in
Algerian attacks, including massacres of villagers. Many women,
kidnapped and raped, have subsequently been found dead with their
throats cut. These brutalities confused observers and analysts of Arab
politics.
<p>
   Rape is an ultimate violation designed to break Muslims by
dishonoring their families and humiliating Muslim men. This was the
case in the Serbian attacks on Bosnians. But these rapists were
considered ``enemies from outside the Islamic fold.'' It makes no
sense for groups whose identity  &UR; de guerre &LR;  is Islamic to rape their
own Muslim women, whatever the nature of the conflict. And, in the
case of Algeria, Muslims around the world dissociated themselves from
these un-Islamic brutalities and violations of sanctity. The questions
remain, however: Who is doing this? And why? Recent reports by the
U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
implicated Algerian security forces in systematic torture, arbitrary
arrests and summary executions.
<p>
   The Algerian government has consistently refused to allow an
international committee of inquiry access to the country to
investigate human rights abuses by both sides in the civil war. The
reason is likely that such an investigation will prove embarrassing to
the Algerian government.
<p>
   The gravity of the violations can be explained in cultural terms.
In traditional Arab culture, the family is the center around which the
sociomoral universe exists. Women are the center of the family's
sacred identity and the guardians of the Arab family's honor and
reputation. Motherhood is considered sacred. Nationhood is expressed
in ``motherland'' terms. The Arabic words for women, household and
sacred sanctity are close derivatives of the same root.
<p>
   To undermine or attack the Muslim woman destabilizes the core of
the sociomoral system. The Arab-Islamic judicial system long
recognized rape as a serious crime that received capital punishment  &MD; 
at a time when rape in America was considered sex, not crime. That is
precisely why those at war with Muslims and trying to break them
choose the path of raping and killing Muslim women. A cultural
strength, Islam's placing women at the heart of sacredness, is turned
into a grave human rights violation in times of conflict and crisis.
These are not random acts. They are systematic, racist, sexist and
they violate international human rights.
<p>
   Whether these brutalities are by insiders or outsiders, the world
organizations entrusted with protecting human rights and lives must
intervene. Just as in Bosnia the world cannot remain a spectator. The
raping of Muslim women must be entered as a crime tried in
international tribunals. Western feminist groups that on short notice,
become activated over issues of whether Muslim women have the right to
drive cars, to unveil or join the work force must now demonstrate
compassion for the more serious issue of brutal raping and butchering
of Muslim women.
<p>
   This is particularly significant since the strong destabilizing
factor underlying such crises comes from a poorly conceived U.S.
foreign policy that consistently underestimates the role of the Arab
street and is too static to adjust flexibly to the emergent political
(Islamic) landscape in the region.

 &UR; Turkish Dirty War Revealed, but Papal Shooting Still Obscured &QL; 
 &UR; Lee is the author of ``The Beast Reawakens,'' about neo-fascism. &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   For 20 years, Turkish security agencies sponsored ultra-right-wing
death squads and narco-criminal gangs that were involved in bombings,
kidnappings and other terrorist attacks. Described in a leaked,
120-page parliamentary report, this sordid sub rosa alliance waged a
dirty war against Kurds and Turkish dissidents.
<p>
   Confirming what human rights activists long suspected, the report
concluded that security forces were responsible for many of Turkey's
14,000 unsolved murders and disappearances in recent years.
<p>
   Much of the parliamentary inquiry focused on Abdullah Catli, a
convicted fugitive who was wanted for murder and heroin trafficking.
His role as state-sponsored hit man was exposed in November 1996, when
Catli, his gangster girlfriend and a top police official were killed
in a car accident on a remote highway near Susurluk, 100 miles
southwest of Istanbul. A Kurdish warlord in cahoots with Turkish
security forces survived the crash.
<p>
   Strewn amid the roadside wreckage was evidence of Catli's collusion
with the Turkish secret service. Along with several handguns,
silencers, a cache of narcotics and a government-approved weapons
permit, Catli was carrying six photo ID cards, each with a different
name, and special diplomatic credentials issued by Turkish
authorities.
<p>
   Catli's secret police ties are all the more scandalous given his
well-known role as a leader of the Gray Wolves, a neo-Nazi terrorist
organization that had stalked Turkish society since the late 1960s. A
young thug who looked somewhat like Elvis Presley, Catli graduated
from street gang violence to become a brutal enforcer for the Gray
Wolves. Rising quickly in the ranks, he emerged as second-in-command
of the group in 1978. That year, Catli ostensibly went underground
after police linked him to the murder of seven Turkish trade union
activists.
<p>
   The Gray Wolves gained international notoriety when one of Catli's
close collaborators, Mehmet Ali Agca, shot and nearly killed Pope John
Paul II on May 13, 1981. Catli previously had helped Agca escape from
a Turkish jail, where he was serving time for killing a newspaper
editor. Catli supplied him with a fake ID and directed his movements
for several months leading up to the papal attack. During this period,
according to the parliamentary report, Catli was secretly on the
Turkish government's payroll.
<p>
   In a glaring omission, the report makes no mention of Catli's
sensational confession in September 1985, when he testified as a
witness at the trial in Rome of three Bulgarians and four Turks
charged with complicity in the papal death plot. Under oath, Catli
(who was not a defendant) admitted he gave Ali Agca the pistol that
wounded the pontiff. Catli also testified he had been approached by
the West German BND spy organization, which allegedly offered him a
large sum of money if he implicated the Bulgarian secret service and
Soviet KGB in the attempt on the pope's life.
<p>
   Additional evidence that the Bulgarian connection was a Cold War
deception came from ex-CIA analyst Melvin A. Goodman, who told the
Senate Intelligence Committee that his CIA colleagues, under pressure
from agency higher-ups, skewed reports to try to lend credence to the
notion that the Soviet KGB and its Bulgarian proxy were behind the
papal shooting. ``The CIA had no evidence linking the KGB to the
plot,'' Goodman asserted in 1990. Former CIA Director Robert M. Gates
has denied that the agency slanted intelligence information, including
reports on the assassination attempt.
<p>
   In the late 1970s, armed bands of Gray Wolves launched a wave of
bomb attacks and shootings that killed hundreds of people, including
public officials, journalists, students, lawyers, labor organizers,
left-wing activists and ethnic Kurds. During this period, the Gray
Wolves operated with encouragement and protection of the
Counter-Guerrilla Organization, a section of the Turkish Army's
Special Warfare Department. Working out of the U.S. Military Aid
Mission building in Ankara, the Special Warfare Department received
funds and training from U.S. advisers to establish ``stay behind''
squads of civilian irregulars who were set up to engage in acts of
sabotage and resistance in the event of a Soviet invasion. Similar
Cold War counter-guerrilla units were created in every member state of
NATO. But instead of preparing for foreign enemies, these operatives
often set their sights on domestic targets.
<p>
   Such was the case in Turkey, where shadowy paramilitary units were
involved in the surveillance, persecution and torture of Turkish
leftists, according to retired army commander Talet Turhan, author of
three books on Turkish counter-guerrilla activities. The
Counter-Guerrilla Organization supplied weapons to the Gray Wolves,
who were responsible for much of the political violence that
culminated in a 1980 coup by the Turkish military.
<p>
   Despite his status as a wanted fugitive, Catli was employed by the
Turkish secret police before and after the military coup. As payment
for services, the Gray Wolf commander and several of his colleagues
were allowed to smuggle heroin and commit other lucrative crimes.
Catli's drug trafficking landed him in jail in France and Switzerland
during the mid-1980s. After escaping in 1990, he became a key
operative in the Turkish government's brutal anti-Kurdish campaign.
Turkish Army spokesmen have admitted the Counter-Guerrilla
Organization (renamed the Special Forces Command in 1992) played a
pivotal role in anti-Kurdish operations.
<p>
   For more than four decades, Turkey's strategic importance to the
United States and NATO derived from its status as the easternmost
bulwark against Soviet communism. Cold War Realpolitik compelled the
Gray Wolves and its Turkish parent organization, the National Action
Party, to cultivate a discreet alliance with NATO and U.S.
intelligence. Led by Catli's mentor, Col. Alpaslan Turkes, the
National Action Party espoused a militant pan-Turkish ideology that
called for repatriating whole sections of the Soviet Union under the
flag of a reborn Turkish empire. ``The Turkish race above all others''
was the Nazi-like credo of Turkes and his revanchist colleagues, who
had been enthusiastic wartime supporters of Adolf Hitler. Although the
National Action Party has been outlawed, its hard-right ideology
continues to influence Turkish politics.
<p>
   During the Cold War, the CIA supported these would-be Turkish
roll-backers in an effort to incite anti-Soviet passions among Muslim
Turkic minorities in the Soviet Union. Although this strategy became
anachronistic when the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, U.S. policy
unintentionally had set the stage for aggressive Gray Wolf
encroachments in Central Asia after the Cold War ended. In 1995, Catli
was among a group of Turkish extremists who traveled to the former
Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, where they tried unsuccessfully to
topple the government and install a leader who would permit them to
use a new drug-smuggling route to the West.
<p>
   Thus far, however, Turkish officials aren't talking about the most
controversial aspect of Catli's nefarious career  &MD;  his ties to Ali
Agca and the papal shooting.
<p>
   In all likelihood, the plot to kill the pope was not hatched by a
foreign government. Rather, it appears to have been the work of
renegade Turkish extremists who operated under the protective umbrella
of Turkey's secret service but did not always take their orders from
Ankara.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. government, which played a major role in
promoting the spurious Bulgarian link, won't discuss Catli's ties to
the papal plot or his long relationship with Turkey's corrupt security
forces. Nor has Washington acknowledged any responsibility for the
Turkish Frankenstein it helped create. A State Department spokesperson
described Catli's activities as ``an internal Turkish matter'' and
declined further comment.

 &UR; What Burt Needs Now (Santa Monica) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif.  &MD;  Raindrops are indeed falling gently on Burt
Bacharach's head as he steps toward a beachfront restaurant in Santa
Monica, wearing one of his trademark sweaters under a jacket.
<p>
   It's a perfect opportunity for a quip from the composer who
co-wrote the Oscar-winning ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head''
almost three decades ago, during his phenomenally successful
partnership with lyricist Hal David.
<p>
   But Bacharach lets the moment pass. It's not his style to draw
attention to himself. For someone blessed with an actor's good looks
and who has been in the public eye for so long from concert tours and
TV specials, he is surprisingly shy and understated.
<p>
   In fact, Bacharach seems a bit uncomfortable looking back at it
all. At 69, he prefers to focus on the work ahead, including an album
of songs he is writing with Elvis Costello.
<p>
   It sounds like one of pop's all-time odd couples: the king of '60s
pop teaming with a singer-songwriter who was once called the angry
young man of rock.
<p>
   But Costello is just one of many contemporary rock artists who have
expressed their love of the hits that Bacharach and David wrote and
produced, chiefly for Dionne Warwick. Among them: ``Alfie,'' ``Do You
Know the Way to San Jose,'' ``Walk on By'' and ``I'll Never Fall in
Love Again.''
<p>
   In an article in the British rock magazine Mojo, Bacharach's music
was described as a marriage of ``unexpected rhythms with daring
melodies.''
<p>
   Several rock acts  &MD;  including Costello, Chrissie Hynde, Sheryl Crow
and Ben Folds Five  &MD;  joined Bacharach onstage to perform his songs
last week in New York. The program, ``Bacharach: One Amazing Night,''
which also features such artists as Warwick, Luther Vandross and
Wynonna, will be aired Wednesday on TNT.
<p>
   In addition, several of Bacharach's songs with David are featured
in ``What the World Needs Now ... A Musical Fable,'' a new
Broadway-bound musical revue that opened April 3 at the Old Globe
Theatre in San Diego. But reviewers didn't like much about it except
the music.
<p>
   Bacharach, who also has written such hits as ``That's What Friends
Are For'' and the Oscar-winning ``Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can
Do)'' with other lyricists, lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Jane,
a former ski instructor. They have a 5-year-old son and a 2-year-old
daughter. Bacharach also has a son, 12, from his marriage to
songwriter Carole Bayer Sager and an adult daughter from his marriage
to actress Angie Dickinson.
<p>
   Bacharach spoke about the hit years with an attention to detail
that underscores the drive that still pushes him as a songwriter.
<p>
   Question: When you were turning out the hits in the '60s and '70s,
what was the biggest thrill? Was it finishing the song, or getting it
down on record, or seeing it go up the charts?
<p>
   Answer: They were all thrills  &MD;  particularly once the labels
started letting us make the records. You didn't have some A&AMP;R man
who'd go, ``Burt, I like that song, but it's in 3/4 time. If you put
it in 4/4 time, we'll record it.''
<p>
   The trouble is if you made it in 4/4 time, you ruin the song, which
I did a few times in the early days. I wanted him to use the song and
I also thought that maybe he's right  &MD;  he's been in the business a
long time and so forth. But once they let us produce the records and
we were turning out hits, we didn't have to deal with that anymore.
<p>
   Q: When you had that string with Dionne Warwick, was there a point
where you felt invincible?
<p>
   A: Heavens no, not at all. Each record was a new challenge. Even if
you start off with what you think is a good song, there's the question
of whether you are going to capture it on record. Can you get all the
musicians to play it just right and then get the right vocal?
Remember, these records were cut live. We'd normally do three songs in
a three-hour session. ...
<p>
   Q: Did you ever have second thoughts about a song once you got into
the studio?
<p>
   A: We were always wrestling with the music. I can't tell you how
many nights I'd make a record, then we'd maybe go out for a couple of
drinks and get home exhausted about 2 or 3 in the morning. I was
living alone in an apartment in New York. Everything was done on the
record and you felt good. But then I'd wake up at 4 or 5 in the
morning and go, ``I should have put strings in this part'' or ``I
should have done the voice different.'' But it was too late and it was
torture every time, the second-guessing.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Q: You started playing the piano at an early age. Do you always
remember being in love with music?
<p>
   A: No. My folks bought me lessons and I was being a good boy. I
tried to play, but I didn't really enjoy it. I was just kind of
treading water for a while. What really hooked me on music was the
first time I heard Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk  &MD; 
all these wonderful artists who were like 30 years in front of
everything else around. At the same time, I was listening to classical
music and that was also thrilling.
<p>
   Q: When did songwriting become important?
<p>
   A: I didn't plan to write songs. I was studying with Henry Cowell,
Boguslav Martinu and Darius Milhaud, really heavy-duty composers. I
thought I wanted to write serious contemporary classical music, but I
guess I didn't want to enough and life took me in a different
direction. When I got out of the Army, I had an opportunity to go on
the road conducting for Vic Damone ... and later the Ames Brothers,
Marlene Dietrich.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Q: What about the pop scene today? Do you hear many good writers
out there?
<p>
   A: There are excellent pop writers out there. Babyface would have
been a great writer in any decade. There's also Diane Warren, who is
terrific, and I like that Tony Rich record, ``Nobody Knows.''
<p>
   Toni Braxton's ``Un-Break My Heart'' is one of the best records
you'll ever hear. It's so economical, so sparse. I can't say enough
about David Foster (who produced that single). He's a great musician,
great talent.
<p>
   Q: How flattering was it when so many rock artists started talking
about you as an influence?
<p>
   A: It felt great. It started in England with Oasis and a couple of
other groups, which is interesting because England was always good to
me. ``Hitmaker,'' the first album I did on Kapp, sold maybe 5,000
copies in the States (in 1965), but it was Top 10 in England.
<p>
   Q: How did you start working with Elvis Costello?
<p>
   A: Allison Anders, the director, wanted us to write something for
the film ``Grace of My Heart.''
<p>
   Q: What was your reaction?
<p>
   A: I loved the idea. I think he is one of the great lyric writers.
I love that he is an adventurer, that he takes chances as an artist.
... Now we've written 11 songs for his new album, which will be
recorded in June.
<p>
   Q: Are you nervous about how it'll turn out, or are you so secure
with your body of work that you can just relax and enjoy it all now?
<p>
   A: I've never been good at looking back. This is another time in my
life. I'm still excited about what there is to come. Is this reality?
Is what I write now as good as I used to write? Maybe. Maybe not. Do I
have the tools I used to have? Maybe. Maybe not.
<p>
   But that's not the point. I look forward to this project with
Elvis. It's a very collaborative effort.

 &UR; In HBO Special, a Little of David Spade Goes a Long Way &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   So kill me if I can't take too much David Spade. Or ``Just Shoot
Me,'' as the title of the increasingly popular NBC sitcom in which he
co-stars, might suggest.
<p>
   I don't know whether it's the voice, the edgy whine, the acerbic
approach, the frat house false bravado or whether he reminds me of
someone I knew and didn't like in college.
<p>
   I just know he's not someone I want to see all that much of.
<p>
   He's a hot enough comedy star right now, however, to rate his first
HBO special  &MD;  Friday night's ``The 'Round Midnight Special: David
Spade: Take the Hit.''
<p>
   But, as I said, a little Spade goes a long way.
<p>
   In NBC's ``Just Shoot Me,'' Spade is part of an ensemble cast
headed by Laura San Giacomo and George Segal.
<p>
   As boy Friday Dennis Finch on the half-hour  &MD;  currently among the
most frequently suggested replacement shows for the soon-to-be-vacated
``Seinfeld'' slot  &MD;  Spade is called on most often to puncture other
characters' bubbles. You know: that slightly world-weary, mocking, the
emperor's-not-wearing-any-clothes way.
<p>
   Same thing on ``Saturday Night Live,'' where Spade took his shots
at whomever in ``The Hollywood Minute'' on ``Weekend Update'' and in
his movies ``Tommy Boy'' and ``Black Sheep'' with Chris Farley.
<p>
   Again, it was Spade in small doses.
<p>
   The perfect amount.
<p>
   HBO's ``Take the Hit,'' on the other hand, pushes my personal
tolerance for Spade to the limit and then some.
<p>
   Because this is cable, Spade, whose adolescent bad-boy humor is
used with some subtlety on ``Just Shoot Me,'' is given freer reign.
And you know what that means: dirtier words, dirtier thoughts, taboo
topics and an occasional utter lack of taste or sensitivity.
<p>
   Completely legitimate considering the time slot and the venue.
<p>
   The overall effect, unfortunately, and the state of mind it takes
to get through an hour like this one, is something analogous to what
happens when you stay at the party too long. Somebody has had a little
bit too much to drink, starts to ramble and you're just too weak or
bored to get up and leave.
<p>
   Perhaps the producers are counting on a little of that from
viewers.
<p>
   Filmed in Spade's hometown of Phoenix at The Improv in February  &MD; 
where he launched his career in the '80s  &MD;  his stand-up act plays
first to the local audience.
<p>
   ``I was out here for the melanoma festival,'' Spade jokes, a
reference to the area's intense sun. ``Lots of lesions. Good times.''
<p>
   And that's, excuse the pun, just the warm-up stuff.
<p>
   On an almost minute-by-minute basis through the hour, Spade gets
crasser, leaving us irritated, offended, bemused, embarrassed and
amused  &MD;  though not necessarily in equal proportions.
<p>
   Spade is comfortable. He's been doing this a while. But his
material is surprisingly uninspired.
<p>
   It takes no time at all to get to porn films he's supposedly
watching in his supposedly low-rent hotel room like ``Schindler's
Fist.''
<p>
   We get to hear the usual banter about high school and college
pranks and clueless ways of life. It's all about drinking, scoring. He
reveals  &MD;  no shock to us  &MD;  that he was a crummy date whose basic line
was ``C'mon. Chug it!''
<p>
   One of his friends (and a lot of this could be made up, he reminds
us at one point with a wink) was a drug dealer. And in between there
are bits about the difference between first class and coach on
airlines and knowing the pilot's name.
<p>
   Where things really get trying, though, is when it becomes hard to
tell how much Spade is joking and how much he really might be a
bitter, little man.
<p>
   There's a disturbing detour into talk about his divorced parents,
particularly his father who reminds him: ``You want a girl like your
mama'' (and he means that in a sexual way) adding, ``You know the
drill: 18 is legal, 17 with consent, 16 with a note, 15 if her dad's
in the room.''
<p>
   And we won't even get into his grandmother's reaction to Brad Pitt.
<p>
   When Spade digs into episiotomy and Jon Benet Ramsey exhumation
jokes, it's time to call it a night.
<p>
   Unless, like I said, you like a lot of Spade.
<p>
   Speaking for myself, I find life too short to take that kind of
hit.

 &UR; Bergen Looks Back at 10 Years With `Murphy Brown' (Hollywood) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; By Judith Michaelson &QC; 
 &UR; (c) 1998, Los Angeles Times &QC; 
<p>
   HOLLYWOOD  &MD;  ``It really doesn't get better than `Murphy Brown,' ''
Candice Bergen allows softly. ``I always thought it was like going on
a blind date and opening the door and having Robert Redford standing
there.''
<p>
   It's the Monday after the Friday night wrap of her title role in
``Murphy Brown's'' 245th and final episode. In her cozy dressing-room
cottage at Warner Bros., the lanky 51-year-old actress, elegant in
jeans and a plain white shirt, is reflecting on the 10-season series
that distinguished her career and encompassed one-third of her adult
life. When the pilot aired Nov. 14, 1988, her daughter Chloe Malle,
now 12, had just turned 3.
<p>
   The hourlong finale will air on CBS on May 18  &MD;  but the work is
done. On Stage 4, the sets were being dismantled; her dressing room
would follow. Leaving its mark on the wall was a blowup of a 1991 U.S.
postage stamp honoring her father, Edgar Bergen, with puppet Charlie
McCarthy. She had taken it home  &MD;  along with the batch of framed
magazine covers that decorated the ``FYI'' office of Washington TV
newsmagazine anchor Murphy Brown.
<p>
   Such was the series' impact that ``the magazine covers originally
started out as magazine covers we just rigged. And then over the 10
years,'' Bergen notes, most were replaced with actual covers of
herself as Murphy.
<p>
   (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   With pride, she points out that ``there's maybe five or six scenes
I wasn't in over 10 years. I was driving every scene with page-long
monologues.'' At the end, the monologue was three pages.
<p>
   (End optional trim)
<p>
   ``We were fine up until Friday morning,'' she says, ``and then it
hit. I burst into tears in front of George Clooney. He was gracious
enough to do a little appearance. Afterwards, I went to thank him, and
he said, `Are you OK?' and ... I couldn't stop crying. I just had to
walk away. But we're fine now. We had a great time, a great ride.''
<p>
   From Bergen's perspective, ``Murphy Brown'' is hard to match
``especially in the quality of the production, the quality of the
writing, the quality of the cast, the crew. ... Diane (English,
creator and executive producer the first four seasons) created a
character we really hadn't seen before. There never was a woman
written like that on television.''
<p>
   Playing the smart, driven, never reticent journalist, whose
workplace was home, had an impact. ``It's brought out aspects of my
character  &MD;  my humor and my practical joking, and my orneriness. It's
made me braver. Her strength has been great company for me.
<p>
   ``I was raised with probably an inordinate degree of manners,''
Bergen explains. ``I don't always exercise them, but (the role) was a
great liberation for me  &MD;  in the way it liberated people watching it.
I loved playing a woman who didn't take (crap) from anybody. All of us
hate the part of ourselves that forces us to do that. And even when we
don't take it, our retorts are never the quality of Murphy's. We don't
have an A-level team of writer-producers writing our rejoinders, so
that often our retorts are kind of lame in flipping someone off.
<p>
   ``But, you know, Murphy always nailed people,'' Bergen says with a
trace of a smile. ``It was just so exhilarating to have the upper
hand. Because women so often don't.''
<p>
   She says she almost didn't get the role: CBS wanted Heather
Locklear. ``I had to fight for the role  &MD;  I mean Diane had to fight
for me. And they wanted to make Murphy younger. They didn't want her
to come off the elevator from Betty Ford'' as a recovering alcoholic.
``They wanted her to come off the elevator 10 years younger  &MD;  from a
spa.''
<p>
   At first, Bergen put off reading the script. ``Chloe was 2, and I
wasn't interested in working, but my husband''  &MD;  director Louis Malle,
who died of cancer in 1995  &MD;  ``thought I was getting a little crazy
not working ... and then I panicked because the script was so good.''
<p>
   She had a ``dismal'' reading in a darkened room at CBS that had
``the physical setting of a police interrogation,'' then English and
executive producer husband Joel Shukovsky went back to plead her case.
Ten minutes later, Bergen had the part.
<p>
   Although Bergen had gotten an Oscar nomination as best supporting
actress for ``Starting Over'' (1979) in a poignantly comic role as
Burt Reynolds' ex-wife, the actress took to heart CBS' judgment that
there was ``scant evidence'' she could play Murphy and that she was
``against type. The word `patrician' was often used. `Icy.' ''
<p>
   That was quickly forgotten. Bergen won her first Emmy as
outstanding actress in a comedy that first season  &MD;  and four more
until 1996, when she took herself out of the running.
<p>
   Among her favorites, she cites the pilot as well as ``the parody of
the Anita Hill Senate hearings. ... The show was always very prescient
 &MD;  politically and socially too.
<p>
   ``And this season,'' with Murphy getting breast cancer, ``there
were several episodes that were truly outstanding. The pot episode ...
the group therapy episode with (actual breast cancer) survivors. It
was painful for the women involved and for all of us because there's
pretty much no one who hasn't been touched by cancer. That show cut
very close to the bone.''
<p>
   Asked about that flash point in May 1992, when then-Vice President
Dan Quayle attacked her TV character for having a baby out of wedlock,
Bergen says: ``We were all kind of bushwhacked by it.'' Yet she says
it was ``the right theme to hammer home ... family values ... and I
agreed with all of it except his reference to the show which he had
not seen. ... It was an arrogant, uninformed posture, but the body of
the speech was completely sound.''
<p>
   Indeed for Bergen, family is key, and she says she's ``very
different'' from Murphy in that regard. ``My family has always come
first  &MD;  by a mile,'' she insists, debunking the notion of ``quality
time'' as substitute for quantity. ``I had a very difficult time
playing Murphy the first year after the baby, as a distant second
priority. It was very distressing to me, and I couldn't get them to
change it. Just hated it, and even Chloe hated it when she would watch
certain episodes. I didn't think it was a good message to be sending
out. Everybody saw the charming and likable side of Murphy, but I
always try to remind people that she paid a very high price.''
<p>
   (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   As for the future, Bergen has no long-range plans. The following
week, she traveled with Chloe to Paris, as she does every spring, to
visit her husband's family. And from there, to Russia. She has never
been there, and Chloe has finished ``Anna Karenina.''
<p>
   ``She's ready. ... She wants to be a writer, and that's what I've
encouraged since she was 7. She's very gifted.''
<p>
   (End optional trim)
<p>
   Does Bergen want to do another sitcom? ``No,'' she says firmly.
``Not for a long, long time. I'm looking at film scripts. Actually I'm
not. I have them piled up.''

   Mr. Raynaud, a recent immigrant from France, finds employment as a
high school literature teacher in the United States. One day, a female
student bursts into tears in the middle of class. Raynaud walks over
to her to investigate the cause of her unhappiness. After she
explains, he attempts to comfort her by saying, ``I understand how you
feel because I have been in your pants.'' Once his class gains control
over their laughter, they teach him about the preferred use of the
word ``shoes'' rather than ``pants'' in his expression of sympathy.

   After a brief shocked silence, the students burst into laughter.

 &UR; ``The Half-Life of Happiness,'' by John Casey (Knopf, $25, 513 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Malcolm L. Johnson &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   From the spare, muscular account of the life passage of a Rhode
Island working-class able seaman/boatbuilder, the National Book
Award-winning ``Spartina,'' John Casey has turned to a plumper,
softer, apparently much more autobiographical account of a middle-age,
upper-middle-class lawyer/congressional candidate from
Charlottesville, Va.
<p>
   ``The Half-Life of Happiness'' is a big family novel, told mostly
from the viewpoint of Mike Reardon, but with other voices too, those
of Mike's daughter, Edith, and his wife, Joss. Yet this time, Casey
seems too close to, and too distant from, his people.
<p>
   This is a skillful, often funny, but also rueful book, set in two
time frames. Most of ``Half-Life'' takes place in the 1970s when Mike
and Joss are still comparatively young. These sections of the book
depict a happiness that comes to a sudden end, with a suicide,
departures of close friends, the breakup of a marriage. But the
present of the '70s, when Edith and her younger sister, Nora, are
children, is periodically interrupted by the older sister as an adult,
reflecting on the past. The final section of the book ``Twenty Years
After,'' occurs in Edith's grown-up present, when Mike has entered his
declining years.
<p>
   Like Mike, Casey is an Irish-American who lives in Charlottesville,
where he teaches at the University of Virginia. Casey has a law
background, and also served in the Navy and as a congressional staff
member in Washington. Both naval and political service figure in
Mike's background, too. But if elements of the book are clearly drawn
from the author's life, some things in the novel feel false, or at
least terribly sketchy. While the characters in the foreground  &MD;  Mike,
Joss and her aristocratic mother Mrs. Rogers, the two girls, then and
now  &MD;  are fully fleshed out, the supporting cast is less well
realized.
<p>
   At the start of the book, before the Reardons split up, Mike is
depicted as the jovial master of the manor. He, Joss, Edith and Nora
inhabit a converted factory above the Rivanna River; their married but
childless friends, Edmond (a naturalist) and Evelyn (a veterinarian),
live in a cottage on the property; and Tyler (an English teacher at
the University of Virginia) holes up in a bungalow, also part of the
lordly Reardon domain.
<p>
   Friends in the Reardon inner circle, taking supper at the communal
table, are Ganny, a black woman lawyer colleague of Mike's, and Bundy,
a sometimes pugilistic artist. In time, Tyler introduces a slender,
flirtatious beauty named Bonnie into the club, but by then Paradise is
lost. Bundy, whom we have hardly known, has killed himself with a
shotgun, Hemingway-style. Then Bonnie  &MD;  or Bonnie One, as she comes to
be known  &MD;  splits Mike and Joss apart. Though she has played with
Mike, it is Joss who becomes the object of her desires.
<p>
   None of the secondary characters, who also include the black boxer
Ezra Pritchett and his crafty wheeling-dealing uncle, Emmanuel
Pritchett, both clients of Mike, is drawn with as much
multi-dimensionality as the people encountered by the protagonist of
``Spartina.'' But the most intriguing folks in Mike's life are the
women.
<p>
   Joss, a maker of humorous, sometimes parodistic short films, stands
out as far and away the most engaging character. Her trademark use of
famous movie cliches in appropriate situations, shows that Casey knows
his pictures. Joss is thorny and sardonic, yet also so in love with
Bonnie One that she hyperventilates when she watches the light of her
life climbing a university tower with a sturdy adventurer named Fiona,
who later becomes involved with Mike.
<p>
   The second intriguingly drawn woman is the so-called Bonnie Two, a
flaky psychologist-singer Mike takes on as a client, a confessor and
ultimately as a lover. Bonnie Two becomes a key cog in Mike's election
machine after he is drafted for a virtually unwinnable run against an
entrenched Republican incumbent.
<p>
   The scenes from political life drive the book's second half, after
its sometimes comic but often overstuffed one-man's family opening,
which includes a long lecture by Edmond on male orangutans. The
sharpest moments in the domestic passages come with Casey's depiction
of Mike as an authority on everything, much to the amusement of the
glaze-eyed recipients of his wisdom. Many daughters will recognize
themselves in Edith as she looks back at the old man's polymathic
pedantry.
<p>
   Casey has written an honest, good-hearted book  &MD;  though he seems a
bit too mean about the absurd Bonnie Two and too vague about the
chunky Fiona. When the book ends it almost seems that the title refers
not only to the time required to absorb memories and to a life split
in twain by divorce, but also to Casey's inability to tell the whole,
unvarnished story of his alter ego, Mike Reardon. Something is
missing.

 &UR; ``The Page Turner,'' by David Leavitt (Houghton Mifflin, $24, &QL; 
 &UR; 192 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Greg Morago &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Literary scandal appears to have had a numbing effect on David
Leavitt.
<p>
   ``The Page Turner''  &MD;  his first novel since the shocking charge of
plagiarism with 1993's ``While England Sleeps'' and the brouhaha
surrounding the aborted excerpting of the too-hot-to-handle
``Arkansas'' in Esquire last year  &MD;  suffers from a bad case of
melancholy verging on boredom.
<p>
   Leavitt plays it safe with this slim story of Paul Porterfield, an
18-year-old pianist who meets and falls in love with his idol,
classical pianist Richard Kennington, an international superstar twice
Paul's age. The occasion of their meeting is a concert for which music
student Paul has been recruited to act as Richard's ``page turner''
for the sheet music. Richard makes a lame attempt at seducing the
preppy Paul, who appears game but not out. The two go their separate
ways.
<p>
   What follows are coincidences that are not only unbelievable,
they're almost irritating to read. First, Paul and his mother, Pamela,
go on vacation to Rome where Paul discovers, quite accidentally, that
Richard is in town for a concert. The two enjoy a torrid love affair
but the guilt-ridden Richard abruptly flees Rome, without so much as a
goodbye kiss to Paul, to return to the waiting bed of his lover/agent
Joseph Mansourian. In the meantime, Pamela, who has no idea her son is
gay, let alone sleeping with the maestro, falls in love with Richard.
<p>
   Flash-forwarding a couple of months, we find Paul living in New
York attending Juilliard and acting as the kept boy of a well-to-do
theater big shot named Alden Hayes. Alden lives in high-style comfort
on Central Park West in the same building where  &MD;  ta-da!  &MD;  Joseph
Mansourian lives. Paul, who hasn't seen Richard or talked to him since
their Roman holiday, accidentally meets the much older Joseph on the
elevator. Soon Paul and Joseph become lovers while Richard is on a
world tour.
<p>
   It gets worse. At home during Christmas vacation, Pamela discovers
her son is gay in the most cliche way: gay porno magazine under his
bed! She rifles through his luggage only to find a picture of (gasp!)
Richard.
<p>
   Leavitt wraps up this simplistic, clumsy story in the most awkward
manner. But before we get there we must endure a scene in which Pamela
attends a support group meeting for mothers of gay children. Here
Leavitt's bag of circumstances is truly fantastic: At the meeting
Pamela meets the very woman her husband left her for.
<p>
   They say it's a small world. But could it really be this alarmingly
tiny?
<p>
   Worse yet, Leavitt's characters are astonishingly self-absorbed and
humorless. It's hard to imagine a protagonist less likable than the
shallow Paul or a couple more irresponsible than Richard and Joseph.
Their dialogue  &MD;  rigid and distancing  &MD;  bears no semblance to the way
real people talk.
<p>
   Leavitt is a gifted writer whose talents are not on display here.
The author of ``Family Dancing,'' ``Arkansas'' and ``The Lost Language
of Cranes'' is capable of deep, telling truths and painful,
unforgettable images. Honesty and reason are hard to come by in the
wearying ``The Page Turner,'' a title that is sadly ironic.

 &UR; McCLURG ON BOOKS: Why Johnny Reb Spends the Weekend at War &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Imagine a Civil War re-enactor so obsessed with authenticity that
he soaks his jacket buttons in urine to obtain just the right
19th-century patina. Or one who wears wool socks that smell as though
they haven't been washed since Bull Run. Or one who eagerly chows down
on hardtack and sowbelly and then compulsively diets so he'll have the
gaunt look of a starving Confederate soldier.
<p>
   If you can't imagine it, you've ``farbed out.''
<p>
   But if it sounds like your idea of a rollicking good time, you're
``super hardcore!''
<p>
   Tony Horwitz, in his amusing, enlightening and sometimes disturbing
journey through the neo-Confederate South, keeps stumbling upon
curious little subcultures of Civil War obsession, like the
``hardcores'' from the ``Southern Guard.''
<p>
   ``Hardcores,'' who look down on mere weekend re-enactors
(``farbs'') with their fake blood and reproduction muskets, seek
``absolute fidelity to the 1860s,'' which gives them a ``time-travel
high'' or ``period rush,'' Horwitz writes in ``Confederates in the
Attic: Dispatches From the Unfinished Civil War.''
<p>
   Horwitz, who has a Pulitzer Prize winning-reporter's knack for
turning up real-life characters who belong in novels, discovers a
goldmine in Robert Lee Hodge, the ultimate hardcore.
<p>
   Rob, a 28-year-old waiter, has elevated his Civil War hobby into a
way of life and a bizarre performance art. He's a genius at
``bloating''  &MD;  Horwitz calls him the ``Marlon Brando of battlefield
bloating''  &MD;  or swelling his belly like a casualty photographed at
Gettysburg. (``Hands are a problem,'' the eccentric Rob admits. ``It's
hard to make them look bloated unless you've really been dead for a
while.'')
<p>
   Later, Horwitz, done up like a Yankee, joins Confederate-clad Rob
in a weeklong ``Civil Wargasm''  &MD;  a madcap car-and-camping pilgrimage
to Virginia's Civil War sites  &MD;  and the highlight of the book.
<p>
   Horwitz, a senior writer for the Wall Street Journal, returned from
nine years abroad writing about Bosnian battlefields and the Middle
East to discover a United States enthralled with the Civil War, thanks
to Ken Burns.
<p>
   A Civil War buff himself as a child, Horwitz decided to ``spend a
year at war, searching out the places and people who kept memory of
the conflict alive in the present day.'' That meant a journey into
present-day Dixie, where the ``War Between the States'' still rages in
certain quarters.
<p>
   As he did in ``Baghdad Without a Map,'' his book about the Middle
East, Horwitz approaches the South almost as a stranger in a strange
land. He obviously has the gift of empathy, because people open up to
him and give him great quotes. And while he has a journalist's
necessary detachment, Horwitz's full-immersion technique and
first-person voice make ``Confederates in the Attic'' at once
humorous, involving and sympathetic, even when his subjects are
appalling. (``There was a feisty iconoclasm about Walt that I couldn't
help admiring, even if he was on the mailing list of every hate group
in America,'' Horwitz says of one South Carolina white supremacist he
meets.)
<p>
   If ``Confederates in the Attic'' has a failing, it's in its
(high-quality) magazine-style journalism. (In fact, part of the book
was excerpted in The New Yorker recently.) While Horwitz is a
compelling, witty writer and a diligent researcher, he sometimes can
only scratch the surface of complex, troubling issues  &MD;  racism, in
particular.
<p>
   It's tough to show up in a town for a week or so and get to the
heart of centuries-old hatreds. But Horwitz still manages to unearth
skeletons that are rattling around in too many Southern closets. He
wades right into the fray in Guthrie, Ky., and tackles the case of
Michael Westerman, shot and killed by a black youth for brandishing
the Rebel flag.
<p>
   But for most of ``Confederates in the Attic,'' Horwitz has a
lighter touch. It's like having your brightest, most observant friend
around, the one whose descriptive powers always crack you up.
<p>
   Horwitz's wide-ranging amble through the tacky New South brings him
across people you won't easily forget:
<p>
    &MD; A modern Southern belle who impersonates Scarlett O'Hara for
Japanese tourists.
<p>
    &MD; An ill-informed high school kid who cites ``The Autobiography of
Scottie Pippen'' as a Civil War text.
<p>
    &MD; The real ``only living Confederate widow.''
<p>
    &MD; Shelby Foote, reluctant Civil War celebrity.
<p>
    &MD; The woman who started the first chapter of the Cats of the
Confederacy.
<p>
   And then there's Horwitz himself, intrepid traveler, clever writer,
a guy so dedicated to getting the story he shows up in uniform at a
Gettysburg re-enactment with a live chicken slung over his shoulder.
<p>
   Super hardcore!

 &UR; ``Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity and American Politics,'' &QL; 
 &UR; by Gail Collins (William Morrow, $25, 322 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Carole Goldberg &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   When Gail Collins ran the Connecticut State News Bureau in the
1970s and wrote columns for many newspapers, she was admired for her
political savvy and sense of what makes a timely story.
<p>
   She's even sharper now.
<p>
   Now a member of The New York Times editorial board after stints as
a columnist for New York Newsday and The New York Daily News, Collins
has written the couldn't-be-timelier ``Scorpion Tongues: Gossip,
Celebrity and American Politics.''
<p>
   This well-researched book gives a valuable historical context to
the hoohah over President Clinton's personal peccadilloes.
<p>
   Delicious dish  &MD;  or, as Collins puts it, ``unverified information
about a person's private life that he or she might prefer to keep
hidden''  &MD;  has been savored ``since privacy was invented.''
<p>
   The American public has always passed these tales around. But the
process reaches dizzying speed today through such unbridled media as
talk radio and the Internet.
<p>
   While much of it is pure rumor, the dirt that won't wash away tells
us something about its target and illuminates our national anxieties,
Collins says. For example, gossip about politicians with black
mistresses abounded during the pre-Civil War era and rumors of
wife-beating presidents arose during the women's suffrage movement.
<p>
   She sees three great arcs of national gossip. The first began in
the 1820s and ran roughly  &MD;  and it was pretty rough, she makes clear  &MD; 
until the end of that century.
<p>
   The second, a quieter time, focused on entertainment and sports
celebs and gave rise to such sleazy publications as ``Confidential.''
Those old enough may remember such gems as ``The Dollies That John
Foster Dulles Couldn't Handle.''
<p>
   The third, which still goes on, began with Vietnam and Watergate.
As respect for politicians plummeted, the level of nasty public
commentary skyrocketed.
<p>
   Some things have changed. The sleaziest tales now wag the formerly
cautious media dog: Outrageous and unverified rumors are reported
simply because they exist, not because they've been proved accurate.
Worse, the Internet  &MD;  ``a vanity press for the demented,'' as her
friend Lars-Erik Nelson of The Daily News calls it  &MD;  transmits the
most rank slanders to the gullible.
<p>
   Ironically entertainers, who once were the targets of the juiciest
gossip, are now so carefully managed they have become less vulnerable.
Politicians, however, ``lack the critical armor of popularity that
would allow their handlers to bargain for the best possible
treatment.''
<p>
   Where do we go from here? Collins suggests we may be so nauseated
or numbed by ugly political gossip  &MD;  and polls seem to bear her out  &MD; 
that we may be ready for another quiescent period in which we will
choose more civilized political discourse.

 &UR; Editors: Language may be offensive to some readers. &QL; 
 &UR; ``Bitch,'' by Elizabeth Wurtzel (Doubleday, $23.95, 400 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Strauss is the author of six books, among them ``Virgins and Other &QL; 
 &UR; Species,'' and ``Under the Canopy.'' She was publisher of Harper's &QL; 
 &UR; Bazaar and the Partisan Review. &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Dorothea Strauss &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   I take ``Bitch'' by Elizabeth Wurtzel to be a rebuttal of ``The
Rules'': a shriek, protesting the hypocritical, no-saying, ladylike
directives for snaring a man found in that bestseller by two
triumphant housewives.
<p>
   Wurtzel's treatise presents an exhaustive and exhausting cast of
``bitches'' (in heat, of course), whose quests for power depend,
largely, on beauty and sexual dynamism. The list is headed by the
biblical seductress Delilah and proceeds as far as Princess Diana. It
includes such famous/infamous names as Amy Fisher, Margaux Hemingway,
Ann Sexton, Zelda Fitzgerald, Edie Sedgwick, Nicole Brown Simpson,
Sylvia Plath, Marilyn Monroe and many others. Though very different,
each, these victim-sisters-in-passion, branded ``bad'' by society,
share violent ends via suicide, murder and drug abuse.
<p>
   We are all familiar with the stories of Nicole Brown Simpson,
doll-beauty, besotted by O.J. Simpson, whose courting of him, even
after their divorce, assured her own death possibly at his hands, and
poet Sylvia Plath, her nature and art, dark and intense,
irreconcilable with her persona of pretty, flirtatious Smith College
belle, led to her suicide as young wife and mother some 30 years ago  &MD; 
her tragedy endures to this very moment.
<p>
   The pages of ``Bitch'' surpass the tabloids in scandalous gossip
and vulgarity of language. And Monica Lewinsky is missing only because
she arrived on the scene too late for inclusion.
<p>
   Like Virginia Woolf, who speaks for the impecunious unmarried woman
in ``A Room of One's Own,'' from the padded comfort of connubial
domesticity, Wurtzel identifies with ``bitches'' across the authorial
divide of publication. ``I root for the bitch,'' she writes, ``who
derails the applecart, who throws the system off guard, and makes a
mockery of some poor fellow's life. I cheer for her because she has
broken the chain, she has taken a taste of what he has completely
consumed.''
<p>
   It appears that, after all, careers for women have not produced a
peace treaty in the gender war. Is the outpouring in ``Bitch'' mere
sensationalism, or is it another bid for legitimate, equal
empowerment? I incline toward the latter, despite the sales figures of
``The Rules,'' and the young women I queried, who claim to have
benefited from its pseudo-Victorian guidelines. The human equation
does not alter, only mores do. Wurtzel implies that Nora, who leaves
home in Ibsen's 19th-century play ``The Doll's House,'' deserting her
husband and children to try her wings outside, is only the reverse
side of Hillary Clinton, who entered captivity through the White House
door, renouncing a successful law practice to be wife to a president.
<p>
   Despite an extended bibliography, the author of ``Bitch'' rarely
quotes anyone: neither sociologist, fellow feminist, rabbi, guru, nor
psychologist. Films seem to provide both springboard and confirmation
for her ideas. This particular trendiness should be congenial to a
youthful audience.

 &UR; ``Beating the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African &QL;

 &UR; Kane is a Sun news columnist who writes frequently about race &QL; 
 &UR; relations. &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   ``The significance of this book,'' the authors write in the first
chapter, ``is its assertion, to the surprise of many, that thousands
of young black males are succeeding.'' Indeed they are, in spite of
those dreadful statistics about young black men that so often inundate
us.
<p>
   One out of every three young black males is either in jail, on
parole or on probation. The homicide rate among young black males is
the highest of any racial or ethnic group in the country. More young
black men are in prison than in college.
<p>
   On the educational side, the outlook is just as bleak, as the
authors point out early in their book. Black boys in elementary and
high school are more likely to be suspended than whites. They lag in
reading and math skills and routinely are tracked into the lowest
ability group.
<p>
   Not so with the young men who are the subject of this book. The
authors interviewed the young men and their parents in the University
of Maryland Baltimore County's Meyerhoff Program. The Meyerhoff
Program gives scholarships in engineering to young black men who show
promise in math and science. These young men were able to beat those
odds.
<p>
   They did it, the authors show, mainly through the efforts of their
parents. Consider this a ``how-to'' book  &MD;  as the title indicates  &MD;  on
how black parents can help their sons achieve in school. The formula
is a tried and effective one: high expectations, devotion to religion,
a passion for the work ethic. Add to that the parents' devotion to
their sons' education at every grade level, even when it meant
confronting educators when the parents felt their children's education
was being shortchanged.
<p>
   Two parents insisted that their son be placed in a gifted and
talented class  &MD;  that area of the educational cosmos renowned for
being bereft of black boys.
<p>
   ``I was the one who would question why there weren't more black
students in the gifted and talented program,'' one father said. ``...
I got the usual: `We couldn't find enough who were qualified.' I knew
my son could do to the work. ... We always insisted on advanced
placement and told the teachers to get back to us if there was a
problem, and we'd make sure he gets the help he needs.''
<p>
   The authors  &MD;  educators all  &MD;  to their credit eschew didactic
jargon and fill their book with anecdotes. A book about motivated
parents  &MD;  and their sons  &MD;  is long overdue. Black America needs more
of them and less of the professional mis-educators  &MD;  such as those in
the Oakland, Calif., schools  &MD;  who continue to make excuses for why
black students don't achieve.
<p>
   The only weakness in ``Beating the Odds'' is the authors' refusal
to identify the interviewees. Names, ages, body language and
idiosyncrasies bring subjects to life for readers.
<p>
   Despite that flaw, ``Beating the Odds'' is a crucial book. For
black parents concerned about their sons' academic achievement it is
crucial reading, as it is for everyone concerned about the general
decline in American education. But the most vexing question is this:
How do we get ``Beating the Odds'' into the hands of those black
parents who care little about their sons' education?

   Contrary to Hollywood and popular fiction, hoodlums with names that
ended in vowels didn't begin to dominate the newspapers until the late
1920s. Before then, from about World War I almost until the end of
Prohibition, many if not most of the most capable and creative
gangsters in America  &MD;  Monk Eastman, Arnod Rothstein, Moe Dalitz,
Waxey Gordon, King Solomon, Meyer Lansky, Doc Stacher, Lepke
Buchhalter, Jacob Shapiro, Bo Weinberg, Arthur Flegenheimer (a.k.a.
Dutch Schultz), Ben ``Bugsy'' Siegel, Mickey Cohen  &MD;  were Jewish.
<p>
   Rich Cohen's ``Tough Jews'' is about the suppressed if not entirely
forgotten lore of the Jewish gangster in America, ``Less'' writes
Cohen, ``a straight history than the story of a Brooklyn gang as seen
through the eyes of my father and his friends.''
<p>
   The book's subtitle is ``Fathers, Sons and Gangster Dreams in
Jewish America''; it might also have been called ``A Secret History of
the Jewish Gangster.'' Jews of Cohen's father's generation have a
favorite gangster the way Roman Catholics ``have a patron saint.''
Cohen is quite good at evoking the vanished world of all-Jewish
neighborhoods that spawned Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel and Dutch
Schultz, the delis and barber shops where the facts metamorphosed into
legend.
<p>
   He's also good at pinning down the nature of the Jewish-Italian
alliance that grew into what would be known popularly as the
Syndicate. ``It was a marriage of convenience,'' one underworld
observer tells Cohen. ``It was a marriage of the three M's: moxie,
muscle, money.
<p>
   ``The Jews put up the moxie, the Italians supplied the muscle and
together they split the money.'' Cohen can't help but share his
father's sneaking admiration for these thugs: ``Here were men who had
no idea Jews were supposed to be weak, so they weren't.''
<p>
   The problem with ``Tough Jews'' is that Cohen is lost when he
wanders from the old neighborhoods. Despite Cohen's fascination with
the now-vanished Jewish underworld, he really hasn't done much
research on it.
<p>
   ``Tough Jews'' is an intriguing idea that starts out well and then
comes apart when the author stretches his material too thin. Short on
facts, Cohen revives a bad idea that should have died with the pulp
nonfiction of the 1940s and '50s, namely inventing dialogue for his
figures.
<p>
   What Cohen doesn't invent he often guesses at: ``As Lepke listened
to the killers, he probably asked questions. Maybe he asked them to
repeat things. ... Maybe he spoke softly. ... Probably he took his
time. ... Hearing him talk on such occasions was probably like hearing
someone read a key to a crossword puzzle out loud.'' Cohen  &UR; probably &LR; 
shouldn't have written a novel.
<p>
   ``Tough Jews'' isn't shoddy, but it often seems as though Cohen
hasn't thought through his fascinating subject and it's
disappointingly immature in its near-approval of its characters.

 &UR; ``Girlfriend in a Coma,'' by Douglas Coupland (Regan Books, &QL; 
 &UR; $24, 284 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Vowell is the author of ``Radio On: A Listener's Diary'' and a &QL; 
 &UR; contributing editor to ``This American Life'' on Public Radio &QL; 
 &UR; International. &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Sarah Vowell &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   It's worth remembering that the works of novelist Douglas Coupland,
like ``The X-Files,'' are produced in Canada. British Columbia, to be
exact. And even though the supernatural conspiracy theory television
show and Coupland's fictional expositions of the banalities of life in
the 1990s are tied in various ways to the promise and products of
Hollywood and Washington, there's still an evergreen scent floating
around both bodies of work. Because the thing Canada has that the
United States often lacks is the sense that nature  &MD;  not man  &MD;  is in
charge, this reminder that we live on a planet.
<p>
   Coupland became famous earlier in the decade for his debut
``Generation X,'' the paperback that launched a million dreadful,
Whither youth? articles about ``McJobs.'' Its inner Americanness
captured the United States' freaked-out, baby-boomer heart.
``Girlfriend in a Coma,'' Coupland's new novel, is perhaps his most
Canadian book yet. For one thing, it situates the center of the
apocalypse in British Columbia! (Everyone knows America's got a
copyright on the end of the world.) This story might be his most
universal, offering an exploration of life's deepest questions as seen
through the lives of five and a half Vancouver losers.
<p>
   Karen Ann McNeil, the girlfriend in the title, spends much of the
narrative half there. As a barely veiled version of the 1970s' most
famous vegetable  &MD;  Karen Ann Quinlan  &MD;  her living death acts as
Coupland's vortex. She is the book's still center, a blank screen onto
which both plot development and questions into the meaning of life can
be projected. She can be an indictment of the lunacy of contemporary
medicine: ``Comas are as modern as polyester, jet travel, and
microchips,'' says her friend Linus.
<p>
   But not only that. Karen's coma is the reason her boyfriend,
Richard, can put his entire life on hold. Waiting around for her to
wake up gives him an excuse not to grow up.
<p>
   This is at odds with the coma patient's proper role as a cautionary
tale. Like overdose victims and car crash fatalities, their presence
is meant to remind us all that life sure is short, that there are
places to go and things to do, etc. One minute Karen's a teen-ager
partying with her friends and the next thing they know, she won't wake
up. And since her friends aren't the most passionate people north of
the border, they don't really learn anything from her illness.
<p>
   At first. For years. Throughout their 20s and most of their 30s,
actually. It literally takes the end of the world to wake these
characters up out of their walking near-comas, though they do perk up
a little when they all get jobs working on the crew of a television
program suspiciously resembling ``The X-Files.''
<p>
   Richard, contemplating the group's lack of luster, remarks that
``losers are the dark side of society and they frighten people into
submission.'' But isn't the submission of which he speaks a kind of
inspiration? The inspiration to think and act, the inspiration to move
forward, to make a mark? That is ``Girlfriend in a Coma's'' function:
It's a self-help book masquerading as a novel. But in a good way. Just
don't read it in bed, because all you'll want to do is crawl right out
and do something.

 &UR; Queen of Romance Novels Says Writing Isn't Work (Keedysville, Md.) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KEEDYSVILLE, Md.  &MD;  It's a pleasant enough home, a sort of
naturalist retreat tucked into a corner of rural western Maryland. A
place where the cows may very well outnumber the residents, and folks
like it that way.
<p>
   The bright, blue deck is the first thing that catches the eye. Then
the country silence is broken by four dogs whose feisty barks announce
the presence of unfamiliar arrivals.
<p>
   Inside, the home is filled with books, and the occasional pet
meanders in and out. There's an indoor swimming pool and a bright,
cozy second-floor office with a window that looks out at woods filled
with poplar, dogwood and oak.
<p>
   Even with the pool and the shiny BMW parked outside, it isn't a
particularly imposing house. Nothing remotely on the mansion level, no
grand foyer that would befit a queen.
<p>
   It is not what one might expect from one of the most prolific and
successful writers in America. Yet Nora Roberts, a reigning queen of
the romance novel and author of more than 100 books, is quite content
in this place she has called home for more than 20 years.
<p>
   ``As soon as I saw this area, I knew it was home,'' Roberts says,
taking a drag on a cigarette.
<p>
   Roberts will not be at her home in Keedysville for some weeks now.
She is on yet another book tour. This one is for her latest novel,
``Homeport,'' which is hardcover mainstream fiction. Her publishers
forked over $250,000 for promotion and did an initial printing of
250,000, according to Publisher's Weekly.
<p>
   Although she is probably best known for her romance novels  &MD;  the
genre she began with  &MD;  Roberts also writes mainstream novels, in
addition to a series of futuristic suspense books under the pseudonym
J.D. Robb.
<p>
   ``She creates characters that readers love,'' says Isabell Swift,
editorial vice president at Harlequin Enterprises and one of Roberts'
editors. She creates characters from witches of the past to detectives
of the future.
<p>
   A new Robb novel, ``Holiday in Death,'' is due out in June. In the
romance genre, there will be a book titled ``The MacGregor Groom'' in
November.
<p>
   ``I am very disciplined,'' says Roberts, who can whip out a book in
roughly two months.
<p>
   That may be an understatement.
<p>
   By the end of 1998, Roberts will have 126 published novels under
her belt.
<p>
   Note to all the aspiring novelists who have suffered the agony of
rejection slips: Roberts, who had six books on The New York Times
best-seller list in 1997 alone, couldn't get her first manuscript
published.
<p>
   Roberts was raised in Silver Spring, Md., the youngest of five
children and the only girl. Her father, Bernard Robertson, was a
television lighting technician who, upon retirement, opened a
theatrical lighting equipment company with his wife, Eleanor.
<p>
   After high school, Roberts married and moved to Keedysville with
her first husband and their two children. While her husband commuted
to his job in Washington, she did ``the earth mother thing.'' And she
was a huge fan of romance novels, reading them in her spare time.
<p>
   She first took pen to paper while keeping an eye on her two young
sons during one of western Maryland's legendary long, cold, snowy
winters.
<p>
   That first story, she says now, was quite forgettable. But the
first rejection only spurred her to keep at it.
<p>
   ``One of the things about writing is, if you want it, you will keep
at it. You can't buckle at that first slap back. I was writing for my
own pleasure,'' she says.
<p>
   Her first published novel, the romance ``Irish Thoroughbred,'' came
out in 1981, and by then, she already had started on the next one.
<p>
   ``I was awe-struck,'' she says at receiving that first acceptance
letter. ``It was the best feeling in the world. But even better was
seeing the first book in print. I was completely dazzled. It was
better than sex.''
<p>
   Now, Roberts writes on a computer in her home office and has her
own home page on the Internet (http://www.lightst.com/nora).
<p>
   She generally receives good reviews from Publishers Weekly and
Kirkus Reviews, which use words such as ``lively'' and ``sexy'' to
describe her books.
<p>
   There have been a few bumps along the way.
<p>
   Most notable is the well-publicized plagiarism suit that Roberts
filed against fellow romance author Janet Dailey. Last year, Dailey
admitted that at least three of her books contained work cribbed from
Roberts. And the lawsuit estimates there may be at least 13.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   In a previous statement released to the press, Dailey has said she
was under psychological stress due partly to the deaths from cancer of
her two brothers and her husband's lung-cancer surgery.
<p>
   ``We are still in settlement talks,'' Roberts says about the
lawsuit. Roberts is trying to read as many of Dailey's books as
possible but says the task is wearing her out.
<p>
   ``I just can't read any more,'' she says. ``Your eyes start to
bleed.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Roberts is not requesting any monetary damages from the lawsuit but
is asking for a contribution to the Literacy Volunteers of America.
<p>
   Plagiarism aside, the other thorn in Roberts' side is the lack of
respect romance novels receive from some who criticize the genre as
fluff that gives women unrealistic expectations.
<p>
   ``I have to roll my eyes at that because it is an insult to
women,'' Roberts says. ``I don't think guys who read Ian Fleming want
to go out and be James Bond. Women can tell the difference between
what is real and what isn't.''
<p>
   The critics don't bother her enough to give up what she loves:
writing, writing and more writing.
<p>
   She credits her discipline to an early Catholic school experience.
<p>
   ``I was educated by nuns. I have to have structure. I write from 9
to 5, five days a week. On weekends, I might work a couple of hours.
If it's really going good, I write a lot on weekends,'' she says.
<p>
   Her system works because it doesn't feel like work.
<p>
   ``I also love this. It would be harder being disciplined if I
didn't love what I was doing,'' she says.
<p>
   Now, her sons are adults, ages 22 and 25. Roberts was divorced in
1983 and married her current husband, Bruce Wilder, in 1985.
<p>
   It was a courtship that could have come straight from a romance
novel.
<p>
   ``I hired him!'' she says. ``And then I kept him.''
<p>
   What she means is that Roberts decided to remodel her home, and
Wilder was a carpenter who was hired to build a bookcase. Wilder now
runs a bookstore in Boonsboro, a small town about 10 miles from their
home.
<p>
   The bookstore, called Turn the Page, was Roberts' first stop on her
book tour, which will take her to 20 cities in less than a month.
<p>
   Then she will be back home in Keedysville, in the cozy office, and
writing yet another manuscript. It is all very gratifying to her.
<p>
   ``It is just sort of a miracle to me,'' Roberts says.

 &UR; As Mergers Shake Industry, Smart Banks Will Find Advantage &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times:
<p>
   A dramatic wave of proposed financial company mergers is sweeping
the country  &MD;  last week's between Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.
would be the largest ever and this week's between BankAmerica Corp.
and NationsBank Corp. the second-largest. The consolidations should
increase efficiencies in the U.S. financial services industry; a dozen
banks in all of Europe far more economically produce the kinds of
services that hundreds of major banks provide in America. From that
perspective, the mergers are a sensible attempt to boost the bottom
line by wringing out overlapping operations and gaining economies of
scale.
<p>
   However, consumers are right to question what the superbanks will
mean for mundane services like personal checking accounts and home
mortgage loans. And some employees of the merged entities are also
right to fear for their jobs, because ``efficiencies'' almost always
mean smaller work forces.
<p>
   Consolidation in the industry began more than a decade ago, and its
clip has picked up recently because banks are eager to broaden their
bases so they can better weather losses in one region or industry.
<p>
   Mergers are also seen as a way to meet the escalating costs of
technology. Banks have spent fortunes reprogramming their computers to
avoid the year-2000 conversion problem. They also need size and
diversity to create sophisticated computer networks that combine
lucrative data from other industries like insurance and brokerage
companies.
<p>
   By serving as one-stop shopping centers for checking, investment
and insurance services, the new financial companies will be able to
offer consumers services in a new way. But ordinary Americans could
also get shortchanged.
<p>
   It remains to be seen whether the new financial companies will pass
their cost savings to consumers or use their industry dominance to
hike fees. For instance, after their merger, NationsBank and
BankAmerica would control roughly 15,000 automated teller machines
nationwide; with a network that big, some financial analysts argue,
they could raise ATM fees with impunity.
<p>
   The remaining regional banks view the mergers with concern, and
many will rush toward mergers themselves. But they could also see
opportunity and reach out to the alienated customers the big banks
leave behind. There will no doubt be plenty of them. Credit unions
should be given bigger opportunities as well to fill in the gap.
<p>
   Finally, the financial titans should create a new variation of the
historical role that banks have played in giving something back to
communities through donations to civic causes. As banks become
super-regional and national, donations and volunteer hours should be
allocated to all areas where the institution does business, halting
the donation decline that has accompanied the merger wave. Community
investment is a low-priced way for these huge institutions to keep a
human face.

 &UR; Packwood May Be Campaigning Only to Rehabilitate Image (Portland) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PORTLAND, Ore.  &MD;  Whatever else he had hoped to accomplish with his
little toe-dipping tour around Oregon this spring, former Sen. Bob
Packwood returns to Washington with at least one modest achievement  &MD; 
the ability to appear in public in his home state without a lynch mob
in hot pursuit.
<p>
   That might seem like being damned with very faint praise, but there
was a time not long ago when Packwood could not have hoped for even
that much.
<p>
   He resigned from the Senate in disgrace in 1995 after the Ethics
Committee found he had made a series of unwanted sexual advances over
a period of decades. His resignation brought to an abrupt and
ignominious end a 32-year career in Oregon politics.
<p>
   At least that is what most people assumed. After Packwood left the
Senate, he opened a Washington lobbying office, made lots of money and
largely stayed away from Oregon. That changed this spring, when he
began accepting speaking engagements. At several of them, he joked
about plans for a new campaign and he told a reporter he would ``never
rule out'' running for office again.
<p>
   Few people even bothered to ask what office before speculation and
response followed one another in a familiar cycle of escalation.
Packwood abetted the speculation by saying he was ``dipping his toe''
in the political waters to gauge reaction to a possible future
campaign.
<p>
   ``That was an inadvertent expression,'' Packwood said in an
interview Monday.
<p>
   While he is adamant about preserving his options  &MD;  ``I would never,
never, never ever say I would not run again,'' is the way he put it
most recently  &MD;  he says he is a long way from making any plans for a
renewed political career.
<p>
   He intends to continue his lobbying business until he retires. At
least a couple years, he estimates.
<p>
   On this trip, Packwood, 65, has spoken to civic groups, party
activists, and Monday to a closed luncheon at one of Portland's most
exclusive private clubs.
<p>
   An accomplished storyteller, Packwood has been regaling the largely
friendly audiences with little backstage dramas from his long career  &MD; 
an anecdote about confronting Ronald Reagan here, one about kibitzing
with Cary Grant there. He has mixed such tale-telling with his own
diagnosis of policy issues.
<p>
   He appears to be operating completely on his own. He has no staff,
no circle of advisers. He arrived by himself for Monday's luncheon,
just another man in a gray suit walking down the sidewalk.
<p>
   He was in a bantering, coy mood, pretending not to understand what
all the fuss is about. He clearly enjoys being back in the public eye.
He has been received respectfully and at times with some genuine,
back-slapping enthusiasm. It is a sharp contrast to his last tour of
the state four years ago, when hecklers and pickets greeted him almost
everywhere he went.
<p>
   Much has changed since then, most particularly the unstinting
barrage of allegations about President Clinton's own sexual travails
and the apparent public indifference to them.
<p>
   Long regarded as one of the Senate's most adept strategists,
Packwood declined to speculate on changes  &MD;  if any  &MD;  in the political
climate or what effect such change would portend for his own tattered
reputation.
<p>
   ``I haven't even thought about it,'' he said.
<p>
   Others have.
<p>
   Deanna Smith, chairwoman of the Oregon Republican Party, said she
welcomed Packwood back to the fray.
<p>
   ``It's so ridiculous now that Clinton has been exonerated and
Packwood did nothing near what Clinton did,'' she said. ``I don't know
why Packwood can't run. He was one of the best senators we ever had.''
<p>
   Others foresee a bit steeper climb toward respectability with
voters. One local pollster called him delusional to even consider
running again.
<p>
   A number of political professionals speculated that Packwood was
fully aware of what he was doing and, while he might not have a future
office in mind, was definitely in the midst of a campaign. The goal of
the campaign is rehabilitation of his reputation, they say, and he
appears to have made a good beginning toward achieving it.
<p>
   The problem with playing a game like that, one Republican
politician said, is you can dupe yourself.
<p>
   ``Pretty soon you're thinking, `Hey, they really like me. Maybe I
should run.' ''
<p>
   If he does, he might run and suffer an embarrassing loss  &MD;  even for
a lesser office such as the state legislature.
<p>
   There is also the possibility of winning. Then he would have to go
to Salem, the state capital, where he started his political career.
<p>
   Nobody here thinks Packwood would regard a return to the decidedly
smaller stage of statehouse politics as a triumph. Cary Grant didn't
play state capitals.

 &UR; Tibetans Take the High Road in Fleeing Repression (Katmandu) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal  &MD;  Thousands of Tibetans fleeing repression in their
own land take one of the world's most harrowing paths to freedom.
<p>
   They climb across the Himalayas.
<p>
   Each year, hundreds of Tibetans trying to escape the alien vise of
Chinese rule set out across the world's highest mountains  &MD;  and into
blizzards, crevasses and ice  &MD;  hoping to reach Nepal.
<p>
   The unlucky are captured or turned back by Chinese authorities. Or
they die in the snow.
<p>
   The rest wander into this city frostbitten and starved, often
missing fingers and toes.
<p>
   ``Everyone was fainting, falling. The snow was at my chest and I
could not see,'' recalled Taga, a 22-year-old man who left his Tibetan
village in December with a dream of studying English in India.
<p>
   Weeks after he left home, Taga staggered down from the peaks and
into a Nepalese settlement. His feet, blackened with frostbite, were
removed.
<p>
   ``It would have been better to die,'' Taga said, staring down at
the stumps of his legs.
<p>
   While exact numbers are impossible to verify, officials with
Tibet's India-based government-in-exile say the number of refugees
going over the Himalayas into Nepal doubled last year to 2,639  &MD;  about
seven people per day.
<p>
   The drama in the mountains is unfolding against a backdrop of
Chinese-Tibetan enmity. The Chinese army rolled into Tibet in 1950,
following the Communist Revolution, and crushed an uprising in 1959.
<p>
   In a recent statement announced over Chinese state-run radio,
President Jiang Zemin said Tibetans are now living a ``happy life''
thanks to Chinese economic policies. Chinese rule, Jiang said, is
``bright, progressive and democratic.''
<p>
   But many Tibetans resist, inspired by their spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, who heads the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharmshala,
120 miles from the Chinese border. The Dalai Lama, regarded by many
Tibetans as the living Buddha, urges his people to resist Chinese rule
without violence, and even to return to Tibet to keep the culture
alive.
<p>
   In its 1997 report, Amnesty International accused the Chinese
government of ``continuing massive human rights violations'' in Tibet,
including torture, forced labor and religious persecution. The United
States recently asserted that the Beijing government was waging an
intensifying campaign of religious and political suppression that
threatens Tibet's unique culture.
<p>
   The human rights reports say little about the journeys undertaken
by the Tibetans to escape Chinese rule  &MD;  or what happens to them along
the way. The stories are recounted by the refugees themselves as they
wander into the Tibetan Reception Center in Katmandu.
<p>
   The tales begin in the villages of far western China, on a remote
plateau that fascinated Westerners long before Hollywood's current
taste for all things Tibetan. The stories recall the epic flights of
those who risked their lives to scale the Berlin Wall or float across
the Straits of Florida on an inner tube or homemade raft.
<p>
   Nyima Dickyi, 23, was a Buddhist nun living in the Tibetan village
of Nyiriku when her nunnery, Phenop Potay, was taken over by Chinese
government agents. Day after day, Dickyi recalled, she and the other
nuns sat listening to lectures on the rightness of Chinese rule and
the follies of Tibetan pride.
<p>
   Reject the Dalai Lama, the teachers said.
<p>
   ``It was a re-education program,'' Dickyi said.
<p>
   On a sunny afternoon in a Katmandu clinic where she was recovering
from her ordeal, Dickyi recalled the day when her tutors passed out
note pads and pens and asked the nuns to record everything they had
learned.
<p>
   Dickyi remembers exactly what she wrote.
<p>
   ``We want to save our country.''
<p>
   She was promptly expelled from the nunnery.
<p>
   Within days, Dickyi was on a bus to the Tibetan border town of
Lhatse, having paid 1,000 Chinese yuan  &MD;  about $120  &MD;  to a guide,
Kalsang Gurmey, who said he could spirit her safely into Nepal.
<p>
   Once in Lhatse, Dickyi met 20 other would-be refugees, and in early
December they began their journey on foot. Of the 21 in her group, six
were monks and seven were children. She was the only nun.
<p>
   Dickyi carried a blanket, about $200 in Chinese currency and a
small sack of ``sampa,'' a Tibetan staple made of toasted wheat. She
wore a traditional Tibetan dress, a nylon jacket and a pair of rubber
shoes.
<p>
   By day, Dickyi recalls, the group hid in rocks and caves. By night,
they traveled in silence.
<p>
   ``We did not want to alert the Chinese,'' Dickyi said.
<p>
   Eight days later, the group was in the Himalayas, at the Nagpa La
pass on the Nepalese border  &MD;  18,000 feet up and 30 miles from Mount
Everest.
<p>
   That's when everything went wrong.
<p>
   First, Dickyi said, the group ran out of food. Then a blizzard
swept in.
<p>
   David R. Shlim, an American doctor living in Nepal who has treated
refugees, recalled how the same storm had dumped rain on Katmandu for
three days.
<p>
   ``We knew that it was probably bad up in the mountains,'' Shlim
said. ``I remember thinking, `Anyone up there is going to be in
trouble.' ''
<p>
   One of the group's members was Taga, the young man whose feet later
had to be amputated. When the children began to collapse, Taga picked
one up, an 11-year-old girl named Shilok Dolma, and threw her on his
back. He carried Shilok for a day but finally set her down.
<p>
   ``She was dead on my back,'' Taga said.
<p>
   Then Taga, his feet going cold, collapsed himself. His sweetheart,
Chemi, picked him up and carried him. She went like that for two days.
Taga remembered that his dangling feet hurt so much that he bit into
his Chemi's back.
<p>
   ``I held Taga's feet close to my chest to keep them warm,'' Chemi
said.
<p>
   When the storm let up, five members of the group were dead  &MD;  four
of them children. Three had collapsed in the storm, and two had frozen
to death in their sleep.
<p>
   ``We put blankets over the dead,'' said Dickyi, the nun.
<p>
   Like many of the Tibetans interviewed for this article, Dickyi
harbored an almost ethereal desire to see the Dalai Lama. She said a
vision of the Dalai Lama helped keep her alive.
<p>
   ``I was senseless,'' Dickyi said. ``I kept thinking, `I am going to
die, and I will not live to see His Holiness.'''
<p>
   Eight days after the blizzard had begun, and more than two weeks
after the group had begun its hike, the 16 survivors limped into
Namche Bazar, a Nepalese town at 11,000 feet. Dickyi, who had by this
time wandered off alone, was discovered by a pair of Scottish hikers.
<p>
   In addition to the five dead, six of the survivors suffered such
severe frostbite that doctors had to amputate their toes or feet.
Dickyi lost seven toes.
<p>
   One of the surviving children was Dadon, 10, who had been sent by
her parents to study in India. She lost all her toes.
<p>
   ``I have seen my friends die in the snow,'' said Dadon, who now
walks on her heels. ``Compared to that, my toes are nothing.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   The toll this winter: 15 Tibetans requiring amputations and six
dead. (In December, a 3-year-old died with a group of Tibetans just
after they had crossed into Nepal.)
<p>
   Workers at the Tibetan Reception Center worry there may have been
disasters they've heard nothing about.
<p>
   ``So many die in the snow. We just don't know,'' said Tsering
Lhamo, a nurse.
<p>
   Recently, there have been other complications. Since 1989, Tibetans
entering Nepal have been allowed to stay only as long as it takes to
recover and move on to India. Many go to Dharmshala, the home of the
Dalai Lama and the seat of the Tibetan exile government.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Last fall, refugees coming from Nepal say, it began to become
increasingly difficult to gain entrance into India. Late last year,
Tibetan officials say, a bus carrying Tibetan refugees from Nepal was
turned back by Indian border guards. By December, so few Tibetans were
getting into India that the population at the Katmandu reception
center, designed to hold 100, had swollen to 600.
<p>
   ``It was difficult to get anyone through,'' said Samdup Lhatse,
secretary of the Dalai Lama's office in Katmandu.
<p>
   A few weeks ago, the Tibetans started moving again. Tibetan
officials say India began easing up on its border restrictions once
national elections ended.

 &UR; Tibetans Flee Chinese Cultural Crackdown (Katmandu) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal  &MD;  Tibetan refugees say they are fleeing Chinese
repression that has worsened since 1996, when Beijing stepped up its
efforts to re-educate Buddhist religious leaders and launched a
``Strike Hard'' campaign against dissent.
<p>
   Many of the latest refugees are Buddhist monks and nuns expelled
from their monasteries and nunneries by agents of the Chinese
government. Others are children, sent by their parents to schools in
India where they can learn their language and history, which is often
suppressed in Chinese-run schools.
<p>
   The surge threatens to upset the delicate and largely unspoken
arrangement among China, India and Nepal to tolerate a trickle of
refugees out of Tibet since the Chinese invaded in 1950. And it adds a
new poignancy to the Tibetans' struggle to secure self-rule and
preserve their culture in the face of a sustained Chinese onslaught.
<p>
   ``What the Tibetans endure is almost unbelievable,'' said David R.
Shlim, an American doctor living in Nepal who has treated dozens of
refugees. ``They cross the highest mountains in the world, they have
no tents, no sleeping bags, and they are often wearing only
Windbreakers and cheap Chinese sneakers.''

 &UR; HELP WANTED: Weight-y Issue Aired in Public by Ex-Boss &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Dear Help Wanted: Can a supervisor legally humiliate you in front
of your co-workers about your weight? My supervisor told me in front
of everybody that I had gained so much weight that she would have to
buy me another chair. She said on another occasion in front of
everyone that my clothes were so wrinkled I looked like I slept in my
car. I became so stressed that I quit. Is there any action I can take
against the company or the supervisor?  &MD; On-the-Job-Torment
<p>
   Dear On-the-Job: You probably have no legal recourse here. But boy,
does your ex-boss need to be forced to sit with Miss Manners.
<p>
   An employer has the right to regulate what workers wear and how
they act, especially in an office setting, said New York labor lawyer
Jonathan Sack.
<p>
   Employers have a reasonable expectation that their employees will
look a certain way and act a certain way, he said.
<p>
   So, your former boss's approach, though barbarous, is legal. And
she proves once more that not everyone who is a manager knows how to
treat people.
<p>
   The outcome might have been different if she simply had conveyed
her concerns in private. She could still have gotten her point across,
but without humiliating you.
<p>
   Now, if she had chastised you publicly for things unrelated to the
office, that could have constituted defamation, Sack said. But that
violation is tough to prove, he added.
<p>
   If you should confront a similarly cretinous boss  &MD;  one should have
that misfortune only once in a lifetime  &MD;  tell him or her that you
prefer to discuss problems in a private meeting.
<p>
   If that doesn't work, make a note of the insults and write a letter
to management asking them to put a stop to the behavior.
<p>
   That kind of conduct should not be tolerated in the workplace, Sack
said.
 &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Readers: My sources at the U.S. Labor Department's Long
Island, N.Y., office, which enforces the federal Fair Labor Standards
Act in the area, called to point out an error in last week's answer
about comp time vs. overtime. In that column I quoted someone who said
that when hourly employees are paid every two weeks, and they work 50
hours in one week, their employer can legally give them comp time the
next week to avoid paying overtime.
<p>
   The comp time is illegal in that instance, said Irv Miljoner, who
heads the Long Island office, because whether hourly employees get
overtime depends on how many hours they work in a single week. If the
hourly employees work more than 40 hours in a single week, they must
be paid overtime for every hour over 40.
<p>
   Each workweek stands alone to determie compliance, he said. One
cannot be credited against the other.
<p>
   Send questions to Help Wanted, Business Desk, Newsday, 235 Pinelawn
Rd., Melville, N.Y. 11747-4250. Please give your name, address and
phone number; they won't be published.

 &UR; Scandal Fuels Protest Movement in Mexican State (Cuernavaca) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico  &MD;  To U.S. tourists and well-heeled Mexicans,
this resort city is a haven of sunny weather, elegant restaurants and
riotous gardens of purple and magenta bougainvillea.
<p>
   But in recent years, Cuernavaca has become a haven of a more
sinister sort. Kidnappers have sown terror in the city and region,
abducting hundreds of people. Drug lords have moved into the walled
mansions of the ``city of eternal spring.'' Authorities seemed
helpless in the face of chaos.
<p>
   Now Mexicans are learning why. In a microcosm of the crisis in the
nation's criminal justice system, top state officials are under
arrest, accused of helping drug and kidnapping gangs or covering up
police abuse.
<p>
   Rarely in Mexico have the authorities been tied so openly to
criminals. Even more startling has been the response: In a glimpse of
the new Mexico, citizens in Cuernavaca and the surrounding state,
Morelos, have launched protests that now threaten to bring down the
powerful governor.
<p>
   ``People have had it,'' said Patricia Edelen, 46, a Cuernavaca
interior decorator who joined the demonstrations after several friends
were abducted. ``People have been kidnapped and robbed, and they're
not going to be quiet about it.''
<p>
   Just 90 minutes from Mexico City, Cuernavaca has long been a
weekend refuge for residents fleeing the giant capital's smog. It also
has been a magnet for foreigners, ranging from Spanish-language
students to U.S. retirees to socialites such as the late Barbara
Hutton. But a four-year wave of crime in the state  &MD;  including an
estimated 350 kidnappings  &MD;  has led to an exodus.
<p>
   As in other parts of Mexico, where officials have lost control over
police as the authoritarian political system crumbles, residents here
had suspected that the cops were involved in crime. What set Morelos
apart was the startling event that confirmed those suspicions.
<p>
   On Jan. 28, a highway patrol cruiser spotted a black Ram pickup
that had pulled off a deserted freeway in Guerrero, the state next to
Morelos. Stopping to investigate, the officers found a body stuffed
behind the driver's seat  &MD;  and three Morelos state police officers at
the wheel, including the commander of the anti-kidnap unit, Armando
Martinez Salgado.
<p>
   Martinez Salgado and four other officers have been charged with
belonging to a kidnapping gang. Forty other anti-kidnap police
officers have disappeared, apparently fleeing. Authorities in the
nearby state of Guanajuato announced recently that Martinez Salgado
was also under investigation there for allegedly collecting a ransom
for a man who had been abducted. Martinez Salgado's family and lawyer
declined comment, but he has reportedly testified that his superiors
knew of his actions.
<p>
   The scandal has spread to the Morelos state police chief and
attorney general, who have been charged with involvement in the death
of the man in the pickup. According to media reports, the victim
allegedly was a criminal tortured and slain during a dispute with
police over ransom.
<p>
   Then, in one of the most stunning turns in the case, officials
announced that Martinez Salgado had admitted protecting drug lords. He
reportedly said he met with Amado Carrillo Fuentes, one of Mexico's
top traffickers before his death last July, and his lieutenant, Juan
Jose Esparragoza.
<p>
   The confession outraged residents, who have discovered in recent
years that the traffickers owned mansions in Morelos and appeared to
operate freely.
<p>
   ``The same people who should be guaranteeing justice are the
delinquents,'' protested Ricardo Alvarez, a 73-year-old photographer
who snaps tourists in Cuernavaca's colonial plaza. ``Everyone is very
upset.''
<p>
   Morelos' governor, Jorge Carrillo Olea, a prominent figure in the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, insists that he
knew nothing of his subordinates' alleged wrongdoing. Federal
authorities say they have no evidence that the governor was involved.
<p>
   But the revelations have fueled a movement to remove him from
office. For two years, human rights and citizens groups have been
calling for action against the police for failing to stop the
kidnappings, which had affected a growing number of people  &MD;  wealthy,
working class and even some foreigners.
<p>
   Now the movement has swelled. Nearly 10,000 residents marched
through Cuernavaca in February demanding the governor's resignation.
More than 100,000 residents  &MD;  one-quarter of those who voted in the
last gubernatorial election  &MD;  turned out last month for a nonbinding
unofficial referendum on whether the governor should stay. More than
94 percent said no.
<p>
   The protesters have ranged from left- to right-wing politicians,
from Chamber of Commerce leaders to supporters of the Zapatista
rebels. The denunciations have spread from plaza to pulpit: The local
Roman Catholic bishop publicly excommunicated Martinez Salgado, the
anti-kidnap chief.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   ``The people of Morelos are the face of the new Mexico, where
participation is key,'' said Santiago Creel, a member of Congress from
the conservative National Action Party, or PAN.
<p>
   In the past, he noted, the decision to fire an unpopular governor
came from the president himself. But in this case, ``the decision is
being built from below.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   But the scandal is not only a test of citizens' power as Mexico
moves from a one-party system to full democracy. It also represents
new muscle-flexing by opposition parties, which took control of the
Morelos state legislature for the first time in midterm elections a
year ago.
<p>
   The state Congress has announced it will begin proceedings shortly
to impeach Carrillo Olea. The opposition says it has the votes to
force him out and name a successor. But the possibility that the
governor could be replaced without a popular vote has left some
uneasy. PRI leaders and others charge that the opposition is using the
protest movement to install one of its own in the governor's mansion.
<p>
   ``This uproar has been created by a small group that is using the
(demonstrators) as a political trampoline,'' Carrillo Olea told the
daily Reforma last month. The governor declined to be interviewed for
this article.
<p>
   The impeachment process is expected to revolve around accusations
that the governor did not react to the crime crisis and allegations of
police involvement. Many critics, however, believe that the governor's
responsibility goes deeper. They say that Carrillo Olea, a retired
general who had directed Mexico's anti-drug force and its intelligence
agency, must have realized what his officials were up to.
<p>
   The governor has said he believed the police were combating crime,
noting they had jailed more than 400 alleged kidnappers. But human
rights groups and opposition politicians charge that many of those
were either small-time hoods or innocent people.
<p>
   Critics also are asking how Carrillo Olea could have missed the
fact that drug lords were moving into the state  &MD;  one reportedly
occupying a house just three blocks from the governor's mansion.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Carrillo Olea has responded that it wasn't his job as governor to
investigate drug trafficking, which is a federal crime.
<p>
   Manuel Diego Castillo, head of a business executives' group that
has joined the protests against the governor, said it had been public
knowledge that traffickers were living in the area. But they were
never detained.
<p>
   ``This bothers us,'' he said. ``The evidence indicates that
Cuernavaca came to be a vacation center not just for tourists from
Mexico City, but also for drug traffickers.''

 &UR; Russian Car-Buyers Dazzled by Newfound Choices (Moscow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Oleg Kulikov moonlighted for months, saving every ruble he
could to buy a brand-new car. Finally, he amassed the small fortune of
$7,000 and triumphantly brought home a shiny red Niva. Within two
weeks, the carburetor went out.
<p>
   ``I'm happy as an elephant,'' Kulikov, a 40-year-old army colonel,
proclaimed a few days later. So far only a bad carburetor!
<p>
   For years, almost all Russian drivers were like Kulikov,
supplicants so abjectly grateful when manufacturers deigned to sell
them a car that they never dared hope it would actually run well.
Those days are fast disappearing, and car buyers are finding
themselves in an unfamiliar position: masters of the market instead of
slaves to it.
<p>
   Foreign-car makers are driving into Russia at full speed, in
pursuit of what is expected to become the world's largest car market
over the next few years. And consumers are encountering something they
never expected: a choice.
<p>
   Russian drivers once counted themselves lucky if they could lay
their hands on a Zhiguli (exported as the Lada), the ubiquitous, boxy
little car based on a now-30-year-old Fiat design. In Soviet times,
consumers didn't actually use the verb ``to buy'' when discussing car
purchases; they used a verb that means ``get hold of.'' That's because
money was not enough  &MD;  you had to wait in line, usually for seven or
eight years, sometimes 20, before you got the privilege of buying a
car.
<p>
   Everyone knew what they were getting  &MD;  a noisy car, cramped and
hard to steer, but very easy to fix. The easy repairs always have been
cherished, because the cars break down constantly. Informed consumers
think of their new Russian car as a kit, which they must take apart
and reassemble before driving.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Masha Gessen, a Moscow writer, says new car owners typically know
to take the car apart, oil all the nuts and bolts, then put it back
together again.
<p>
   ``If you don't do it from the start,'' she writes, ``after a few
months the nuts and bolts meld into one another, becoming inseparable.
So if you are not careful, next time you have to change the air
filter, you'll have to cut the carburetor cover off with a torch.''
<p>
   She drives a Volvo.
<p>
   For additional insurance, new owners have their cars blessed by
priests, who traditionally performed similar blessings on carriages
and animals.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Russia has tried to protect its market by imposing import taxes of
up to 80 percent. But with car sales expected to reach 15 million a
year within six or seven years (car ownership currently is 15 percent
of what it is in the United States) foreign manufacturers have not
been deterred.
<p>
   They have been setting up assembly plants within Russia and other
former Soviet republics to avoid import taxes. The locally assembled
foreign cars are astounding shoppers, says Aleksandr S. Arakelyan, who
opened a Kia showroom last month in a space that had housed a small
supermarket.
<p>
   ``Their first question,'' he says, ``is this: `Have we reached the
level that in this country we can make such good cars?' ''
<p>
   The smallest Kia sells for under $12,000, with air conditioning and
other luxuries that dazzle Russian buyers. The bare-bones Zhiguli
starts at $6,000, but the more attractive one goes for $11,000. Many
customers would rather wait until they can save a little more and buy
a car like the Ford Escort, assembled in Belarus and costing about
$13,000.
<p>
   The competition from foreign brands is forcing Russian
manufacturers to begin modernizing. The latest Volga  &MD;  the traditional
car of officialdom  &MD;  has rounded edges that faintly resemble a
Mercedes. Even the Zhiguli has begun to look less like a can of Spam
and more like a real car.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Car dealerships are opening everywhere. One big one, called Alan,
operates from a fifth-floor walk-up. (There's a winding ramp inside
the building for the cars.)
<p>
   Arakelyan hopes to turn his dank former supermarket, which now has
about half-a-dozen cars, into a plush Kia showroom where buyers can
select a car and then sit in a lounge watching television and drinking
coffee while the car is registered or an alarm is installed.
<p>
   Perhaps, someday, prospective buyers will even be able to
test-drive a car. ``It might get dirty!'' one Kia salesman said in
shocked tones when the idea was suggested.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   The big automakers like Ford and General Motors are counting on an
emerging middle class for future car sales and have tried to tap that
new market by arranging for customers to buy cars on credit. Most
buyers now arrive with stacks of hundred-dollar bills; there are no
checks here.
<p>
   Banks have been offering car loans since last year, but the word
has been slow getting out despite banners strung across major streets
to advertise them.
<p>
   Sergei Andreichenkov, director of a General Motors dealership in
Moscow, hopes that credit will allow ordinary people to buy his big
seller  &MD;  the Chevrolet Blazer. The four-wheel-drive Blazer costs about
$40,000 here, and he says 90 percent of his customers have been
gangsters.
<p>
   But when buyers discover that the banks offering loans want 30
percent down and charge interest of 22 percent or more for dollar
loans and 45 percent for ruble loans, their eagerness to buy on credit
abates somewhat.
<p>
   ``You have to pay interest!'' said one shopper, Sergei Ivanov, as
if discovering the trick in the fine print.
<p>
   One bank requires a certificate of mental health of anyone
requesting a loan of more than $5,000  &MD;  perhaps assuming you'd have to
be crazy to do that. Still, Andreichenkov said, two people took out
loans last month to buy Blazers from him.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Not everyone is enamored by the foreign cars. Dmitri Turkin always
has bought a Moskvich  &MD;  the notoriously unreliable car made in Moscow
 &MD; 
<p>
   and he always will. Turkin loves to spend his time outside his
Moscow apartment, repairing his car.
<p>
   ``With a Moskvich,'' he says, ``I know I'll always have plenty of
work.''

 &UR; Car Magazine Reflects Changes in Russian Market (Moscow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Perhaps nothing reflects the changing Russian market as
much as the car magazine Behind the Wheel, published since April 1928.
<p>
   Once a combination instruction manual and Communist propaganda
pamphlet, it has become a glossy, full-color consumer guide printed in
Italy.
<p>
   Russian and foreign cars are evaluated on the basis of test drives.
``We are independent,'' says Vladimir Arusha, the deputy editor.
<p>
   ``I am very proud we don't belong to any bank or any enterprise
producing cars. We live on what we earn and can say what we want.''
<p>
   A new feature, called Women's Club, tries to entice woman drivers,
who were nearly nonexistent until a few years ago.
<p>
   ``The attitude is conservative,'' Arusha says.
<p>
   ``Older people don't approve of woman drivers. What makes me happy
is people don't care about this conservatism. People are not waiting
for attitudes to change. They sit behind the wheel and drive.''
<p>
   Arusha says that not one of the approximately 200 women who live in
his Moscow apartment building drove until two years ago. Now, there
are about 10 female drivers.
<p>
   In the latest Behind the Wheel, Women's Club columnist Natalya
Yefimova offered some personal driving tips.
<p>
   ``One of my attractive, black-eyed girlfriends drives with a sign
on her car that says `Invalid,' '' Yefimova wrote.
<p>
   She hoped the sign would make male drivers take pity on her. Many
men sneer at the idea of women driving and enjoy tailgating them,
cutting them off at high speed, then slamming on the brakes.
<p>
   Yefimova advises against perfume because it can mix with the smell
of gasoline and give you a headache or make you sick.
<p>
   She offered some stern advice about fur coats: Don't wear one when
behind the wheel. She was wearing her mink when she leaned over to
look at a tire. A shoulder seam split.
<p>
   Also, mink tends to produce static electricity in a car, sending
off sparks if your boyfriend is a passenger.

   Have you heard of And 1? Well, we think it is the most popular
clothing around for kids. And 1 is a basketball term, and it means
that if you get fouled while taking a shot and the basket goes in, you
then get a foul shot and a chance to make a three-point play.
<p>
   And 1 sells T-shirts, pants, tank tops, shoes, shorts, sweatshirts
and sports equipment. It has a wide selection of items for kids and
adults. Basketball star Stephon Marbury of the Minnesota Timberwolves
promotes And 1 products. You can find And 1 at many stores.
<p>
   We think kids like And 1 because of the clever quotes on the back
of the T-shirts. For example, on the back of one of them it says
``Forget the circus, I'm the greatest show on Earth.'' Other quotes we
liked were ``Take some aspirin, this is gonna hurt'' and ``Home is
where the hoop is.'' The average price for a kid's short-sleeve
T-shirt is $15, and $20 for a long-sleeve shirt. A hooded sweatshirt
is $30, without a hood is $25, and shorts are about $20.

<p>
   The video game ``Micro Machines V3'' ($49.95, PlayStation) is
really fun. You are a race car driver, and you have to try to get
through many different, cool levels. Before you begin, there are these
neat drivers such as Spider, Dwayne, Cherry, Jade, Walter, Chen,
Bonnie and Jethro that you get to choose as your racer. There are sly
turns, tough curves and little ``gifts'' that give you bonus help so
you can have an advantage while playing. These gifts are torpedoes and
hammers, and they can be used to hit or slam other cars. There are
lots of traps and force fields to make your racing more adventurous.
The 3D graphics make everything look real, and up to eight kids can
play at once. I was definitely pleased with this game.

    &UR; `ALLSTAR SPORTSTORY' SERIES &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; By Nicole Lord and Leeza Menon &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; Kidsday Staff Reporters &QC; 
<p>
   If you are a sports fan or just love sports books, you should check
out the new ``AllStar SportStory'' series by Fred Bowen (Peachtree
Publishers, $4.95). We read ``The Golden Glove'' and ``Full Court
Fever,'' and they are books you cannot put down.
<p>
   The reason they are so appealing is you can identify with many of
the characters, and what they go through to achieve their dreams. The
author also combines fiction with real sports history. For example, in
``Full Court Press'' a basketball team goes up against a difficult
team, and they end up using a defensive strategy  &MD;  the full-court
press  &MD;  that was first used by the UCLA basketball team during the
1964 NCAA tournament.
<p>
   In ``The Golden Glove,'' you'll read history on the origin of
baseball gloves  &MD;  the different phases, shapes and looks the gloves
went through in order to reach its present-day perfection. This
magical book is also about a 12-year-old boy, Jamie, whose most prized
possession is his baseball glove with Cal Ripken's signature on it.
Jamie believes his glove is the lucky charm that helps him win games  &MD; 
until he loses his glove. Then he finds out that he, not his glove, is
responsible for his success.
<p>
   Bowen is a natural when it comes to writing sports stories, and
informing his readers about the past. These books are perfect for kids
ages 8 to 12. Other books in the series are ``T.J.'s Secret Pitch,''
``The Kid Coach'' and ``Playoff Dreams.''

 &UR; KIDSDAY TALKS WITH: Movie Star Joseph Mazzello &QL; 
 &UR; Kidsday Staff Reporters &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   We recently interviewed 14-year-old movie star Joseph Mazzello, who
has been in 14 movies, including ``Jurassic Park'' and ``The River
Wild.'' Most recently he starred in ``Star Kid.''
<p>
   Q: Did your parents support you when you decided to pursue a movie
career?
<p>
   A: I was only 5, so they had to help. What happened was my sister
had been doing a lot of commercials. She would study her lines and go
over them so many times that I would end up memorizing them. My
parents thought that I was pretty good at it so they asked me if I
wanted to try it. I was really just following my big sister.
<p>
   Q: When you are not acting, do you consider yourself just a normal
kid?
<p>
   A: At school, and with my friends, I try to put acting aside. I try
to be a normal person and not even think about it.
<p>
   Q: Does anyone else in your family besides your sister act?
<p>
   A: My sister stopped when she was in sixth grade and she is 16 now.
My brother acts off and on; he is in my new movie, ``A Small
Miracle.'' My parents own a dance studio and they have been dancing a
long time. My father was on Broadway.
<p>
   Q: Have you ever had a stunt double?
<p>
   A: All the time. They really don't let kids do many of their own
stunts in case they get hurt. A broken arm is not going to look too
good when I'm wearing a cast for half the movie.
<p>
   Q: Do you have any advice for kids who want to become actors?
<p>
   A: You have to get an agent. It is not so much fun at first. You
have to go to all auditions and then go to all the callbacks. You
might be disappointed at first. If you go into acting, make sure it is
not your whole life. In acting you have your highs and lows, and it is
not something you can always rely on.
<p>
   Q: What are some of your hobbies?
<p>
   A: Acting is my hobby. I am just lucky that I get paid for it. I
think baseball is my favorite sport, but I don't play organized sports
because the school is too small.
<p>
   Q: Does acting interfere with your schoolwork?
<p>
   A: It didn't used to, but now that I am in high school, it is
getting a little harder.
<p>
   Q: How do your friends treat you?
<p>
   A: I had been going to the same school for nine years. In seventh
and eighth grade I only had eight kids in my class. Everyone got to
know one another well. Now that I am in high school some kids are
still getting used to me being an actor.
<p>
   Q: Do you want to keep this career?
<p>
   A: Yes. I am going to go to film school and maybe try to be a
director.
<p>
   Q: What movies do you have coming up?
<p>
   A: I just finished the movie ``A Small Miracle.'' Jim Carrey
narrates it.

 &UR; KIDSDAY TALKS WITH: Singer Celine Dion &QL; 
 &UR; Kidsday Staff Reporters &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   We recently interviewed singer Celine Dion. Her latest album is
``Let's Talk About Love,'' which contains the hits ``My Heart Will Go
On,'' from the movie ``Titanic,'' and ``Tell Him,'' a duet with Barbra
Streisand.
<p>
   Q: Were you named after anyone?
<p>
   A: My mom decided to name me Celine because there was a song in
France called ``Celine.'' While my mom was pregnant with me she kept
listening to it on the radio. So she decided to name me after that
song.
<p>
   Q: Where did you grow up?
<p>
   A: I grew up in the Province of Quebec. It is a beautiful place. It
has 6 million people and four seasons with beautiful summers and cold,
cold winters. Fifty percent of the people speak French and English,
and the other 50 percent speak only French. I am from the a little
town that is like the town on the TV show ``Little House on the
Prairie.'' Everybody knows everyone. I went to school in Charlemagne.
It is a little town about 15 minutes from Montreal. We had 16 people
living in the house and we slept three kids in a bed.
<p>
   Q: Do your songs tell true stories?
<p>
   A: They tell true stories, but not necessarily my stories. All the
songs I sing are not my dreams or my life, but I might sing something
that is someone else's dream. When I sing the song, I become the
character in my song.
<p>
   Q: Do you dedicate your songs to anyone?
<p>
   A: To anyone who is willing to open their hearts. I dedicate them
to my husband (Rene), because we are very much in love. When I sing my
songs I think of him, and I sing with more feeling.
<p>
   Q: Have you been blessed with other gifts besides singing?
<p>
   A. I'm not too bad a cook, and my husband loves my cooking. There
are so many things I feel lucky about. For one person to have so many
things is just too much. I feel that someone is looking over me. I can
do what I love. I travel the world, I've met some wonderful people. I
have wonderful parents and brothers and sisters. I have my health and
I have good friends. I have realized so many dreams.
<p>
   Q: What do you like, and not like, about being famous?
<p>
   A: I love to sing. My songs can touch people. People come up to me
and tell me that they got married to a song of mine. Touching people
with music is very rewarding. I've been able to travel the world, and
being able to talk with people, I learn from everyone. That is
important to me because I stopped going to school very early. The
not-so-good is I miss my family very much. I want to be with them
more.
<p>
   Q: What else do you want in your life?
<p>
   A: I would like to have children. It is wonderful to have a career
and have lots of stuff, but show business is not a real life. I would
love to have a family of my own  &MD;  not 14 children like my parents. I
would like to have children and share my happiness with my newborn.

 &UR; KIDSDAY TALKS WITH: Musical Group Sugar Ray &QL; 
 &UR; Kidsday Staff Reporters &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   We recently interviewed Stan, 28, and Craig, 26, (also known as
D.J. Homicide), two members of the group Sugar Ray, at their Atlantic
Records offices in New York City. Their second CD, ``Floored,'' went
multiplatinum, and it contains the song ``Fly.''
<p>
   Q: Why did you name the band Sugar Ray?
<p>
   Stan: We like boxing. There were two boxers: One was Sugar Ray
Robinson and the other Sugar Ray Leonard. When we were deciding what
to call the band, we were working at a place where we practiced every
day. The guy who owned our practice space used to work with one of the
Sugar Rays and he would tell us stories about him, so we named the
band after them.
<p>
   Q: Why did you write ``Fly'' and what does it mean?
<p>
   Craig: It just kind of came out. We were in a fight one night and
actually wrote it in the studio. Me, Stan and Rodney (the guitar
player) and Murphy (bass player) were saying let's not fight. We
stayed at the practice hall and it came out in like five minutes. My
job is to make beats and stuff. So, I had a beat and Murphy had a bass
line for background music. Stan came out with ``I just want to fly.''
He didn't write it, he just sang it. It just went from there.
<p>
   Q: Do your parents like your music?
<p>
   Stan: My mom likes the song ``Fly'' very much. She doesn't like a
lot of the other songs on our record.
<p>
   Craig: My mom likes ``Fly'' and ``RPM,'' too. She doesn't like
anything else.
<p>
   Q: How did you feel about ``Fly'' being the most played video on
MTV?
<p>
   Craig: When we sold our first 500,000 records, that justified us as
a band. It made me cry. It meant out of every video on MTV, we were
No. 1.
<p>
   Q: Which CD of yours do you like better, ``Lemonade and Brownies''
or ``Floored''?
<p>
   Stan: I like our CD ``Lemonade and Brownies'' better because it was
at a time when we were very excited about being signed to Atlantic
Records. It was just a very innoncent period for the band. I think
``Floored'' will have the same feeling in about six months.
<p>
   Q: What does your family think of your success?
<p>
   Craig: I have a younger sister. She is the most popular kid in
school right now. Her name is on the record. She says, ``You have to
come to my school and pick me up.'' I don't have a cool car, so I
don't want to do it. She is having as much fun as I am.

 &UR; Vision Test May Help Screen Unsafe Drivers &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A new vision test may help predict which drivers can still sit
safely behind the wheel and which ones should stop driving.
<p>
   A study of nearly 300 people, aged 55 to 87 years, found that an
experimental computer vision exam seems to be helpful in identifying
drivers who are more likely to have traffic accidents.
<p>
   The findings suggest ``that there may be a way to protect older
drivers and the community in a very reasonable way,'' said Jared B.
Jobe, chief of the National Institute on Aging's adult psychological
development branch, which sponsored the study.
<p>
   Researchers at the University of Alabama in Birmingham used
computer screens filled with visual distractions to gauge how well
drivers could pick out cars, trucks and other objects scattered on the
screen. Unlike standard vision tests, this test was designed to
measure how well people were able to process what they saw  &MD;  something
that is key to safe driving.
<p>
   People in the study were tracked from 1990 to 1993. The team of
researchers, which was led by Cynthia Owsley with the clinical
research unit at the Eye Foundation Hospital in Birmingham, also
collected traffic-accident reports to identify crashes involving the
drivers.
<p>
   During the three-year follow-up period, 56 people in the study were
involved in at least one traffic accident. The study found that people
who showed a 40 percent or greater impairment in their ``useful field
of view'' were twice as likely as others in the study to be involved
in a traffic accident. The study also found that for every 10-point
reduction in a driver's useful field of view, the risk of being in an
accident rose 16 percent, regardless of the driver's age.
<p>
   The study was in last week's Journal of the American Medical
Association.

 &UR; Weight Loss After 50 Linked to Shorter Life &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Significant weight loss after age 50 is correlated with higher
death rates after age 65 in both men and women, a new study has found.
On the other hand, being overweight did not lead to increased
mortality.
<p>
   Researchers from the University of Washington and several other
institutions studied 4,317 nonsmoking adults who were between 65 and
100 years old. All participants were nonsmokers and none were
wheelchair-bound or undergoing cancer treatment.
<p>
   The researchers noted the participants' weight at entry into the
study as well as their weight (based on their recollection) at age 50.
They also collected information on recent weight loss, smoking
history, history of disorders such as diabetes, heart disease and
cancer, and other data. Then they recorded all deaths in the study
group over a five-year period, and analyzed the relationship between
mortality and body mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height.
<p>
   The thinnest women had a significantly higher death rate than women
in all other categories, even after results were adjusted for age and
the presence of various diseases. For men, there was no significant
relationship between BMI and mortality. Thus, among elderly people of
both sexes, the study found no evidence that being overweight
increased the risk of death.
<p>
   However, recent, unintended weight loss was a definite risk factor.
People who had lost 10 or more pounds without trying in the year
before entering the study had high death rates during the ensuing five
years: 33 percent for men, 16 percent for women. This may reflect the
fact that spontaneous weight loss often signals the presence of cancer
or chronic illness. (Death rates were not elevated among people who
had intentionally lost weight in the previous year, or among those who
had gained weight or stayed the same.)
<p>
   But the most striking finding was the correlation of significant
weight loss after age 50 (whether intentional or not) with higher
death rates after age 65. Of men who reported having lost 10 percent
or more of their body weight since age 50, 30 percent died during the
study period. Among women with this degree of weight loss, 16 percent
died. Those death rates were about twice as high as the rates seen
among people whose weight had remained stable.
<p>
   For many older people, the protective effects of obesity may
outweigh the negative aspects, write University of Washington
biostatics professor Paula Diehr and coauthors. Fat ``provides a
nutritional reserve to the individual in times of stress, such as
illness or trauma'' as well as a cushion protecting against injuries
during falls. Long-term weight loss after age 50, on the other hand,
appears to increase mortality for reasons that are not well
understood.
<p>
   Losing weight makes sense for people with certain conditions  &MD; 
diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis  &MD;  but it may not be advisable
for all overweight seniors, the authors conclude. ``What we really
should be thinking about is fitness and function, rather than
obsessing about weight,'' Diehr said in an interview.
<p>
   The study appears in the April issue of the American Journal of
Public Health.

 &UR; Preoperative Drugs Lessen Post-Op Pain, Doctors Report &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The pain that patients experience after prostate cancer operations
can be greatly diminished by the administration of anesthetic drugs
before surgery, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania Medical
Center reported last week.
<p>
   In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, a team of anesthesiologists and urologists found that the
use of preoperative anesthesia, administered through an epidural
catheter, stops pain by blocking the natural response of the central
nervous system. The effect was evident as long as nine weeks after
surgery.
<p>
   Anesthesiologist Allan Gottschalk and his colleagues studied 90 men
in otherwise good health who underwent removal of the prostate for
cancer that had not spread beyond the organ.
<p>
   Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first
received no preoperative painkiller, while patients in the second and
third groups received either fentanyl or bupivacaine before surgery.
All three groups were given a standard general anesthetic and received
similar postoperative drugs for pain.
<p>
   Gottschalk and his colleagues found significant differences between
the groups that received preoperative anesthesia and the group that
did not. The two preoperative groups reported 33 percent less pain
during their hospitalization than the group that received pain
medication only after surgery.
<p>
   A telephone survey conducted nine weeks after discharge found that
86 percent of those who received preoperative painkillers had no pain
compared with only 47 percent who received no such medications.

<p>
   Dear Kidsday: My younger brother really gets me upset. He always
seems to get his way with our parents. What can I do?  &MD; Angry
<p>
   Dear Angry: Talk to your parents and explain to them how you feel.
There might be a reason why they give him special attention and not
you. When you talk to them make sure you can back up the things you
say. Tell them specific times when you are not favored.
<p>

<p>
   Dear Kidsday: My younger brother is always fighting with my younger
sister. When my parents come in to break it up, all of us get
punished. I don't think it is very fair, because I don't fight with
either of them.  &MD; Surrounded
<p>
   Dear Surrounded: It seems like your parents don't care who's
fighting, they just want the fighting to stop. They should already
know you don't do any of the fighting. When it is calm in your house,
have a private talk with your mom and dad. Maybe they want you to try
and take charge, and help stop the trouble.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Kidsday: We just got a new cat. Can you think of a good name
for him?  &MD; Nameless
<p>
   Dear Nameless: For a unique name, look in the back of Webster's
Dictionary. It has sections with biographical, Biblical, mythological
and geographical names. Or look at your cat's coloring and give him a
name that is appropriate. For example, if his fur is a golden color,
you could name him Sunshine. Or name him after one of your favorite
characters on a TV show or in a movie.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Kidsday: I am so bored! My mom tells me to get a hobby. I'm an
11-year-old boy. Do you have any ideas?  &MD; Bored
<p>
   Dear Bored: Save up your money and start to collect something, such
as trading cards  &MD;  it's a fun hobby and a good investment. You can get
ideas for other collections by going to your local bookstore and
buying a hobby magazine. Or visit your local library and take out a
book about making arts and crafts. Or join a local sports team or
after-school club.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Kidsday: I have a problem with one of my friends. She is kind
of sensitive. If I so much as look annoyed, she blows it out of
proportion. She then has her mom call up and complain about how I
alienate myself from the group. All the kids in our group follow her.
They all even act like her. What I want to know is how can I be myself
in a group that is all alike?  &MD; Confused and Different
<p>
   Dear Confused and Different: You are right. You can't be an
individual in a group like that. You might have to form your own group
that enjoys doing things that you like to do. A few kids on this panel
think it is a good idea to break away from that girl. If she is really
annoying, you can have your mom call her mom but that may not get
anywhere. One other thing you could try is just to pull her aside and
tell her how you feel. That will give you an idea of how you should
act when you are with her.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Kidsday: I feel like I am betraying my friend. She is going
out with this really hot kid. Two days after their relationship
started, he asked me out. I like him, but if my friend found out, our
friendship would be ruined. My two other friends know about him asking
me out, and they say they wouldn't tell a soul because I said yes.
After a day of thinking about it, I can't choose between my friend and
this boy.  &MD; Stuck In Between
<p>
   Dear Stuck In Between: You are betraying your friend. You should
tell your friend what you did, but you should also tell your friend
what this boy did. We're not sure if he is the right person for either
of you. These 22 panelists all agree you should not go out with him.
He is too sneaky. We also think you should choose the friend over the
boyfriend.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Dear Kidsday: I have a problem. These two girls make fun of me
because I wear thick glasses. They call me cross-eyed and threaten my
dog. It really hurts my feelings. What should I do?  &MD; M.T.
<p>
   Dear M.T.: They threatened your dog? What is going on here? They
seem silly to us. As hard as it might be, you have to ignore them. If
they see you are bothered by their teasing they are going to keep
doing it. Make sure you play with friends who like you for who you
are. If the glasses look bad to you, then ask your mom if you can get
new frames.

 &UR; KIDSDAY TALKS WITH: The Spice Girls &QL; 
 &UR; Kidsday Staff Reporters &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   We recently interviewed the Spice Girls  &MD;  Emma Bunton (Baby Spice),
Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Melanie
Chisholm (Sporty Spice) and Victoria Adams (Posh Spice)  &MD;  along with
many other journalists from around the country at a press conference
in New York City for the opening of their movie, ``Spice World.''.
From England, they formed their pop group in 1993, and their first
single, ``Wannabe,'' went to the top of the charts. To date they have
sold more than 10 million singles worldwide.
<p>
   Q: How did you get your group's name?
<p>
   Melanie B.: We actually wrote a song ``Sugar and Spice.'' I think
that subconsciously planted the seed. And then one day we were in
aerobics class bouncing around and we came up with the name.
<p>
   Q: All of you say Girl Power a lot, but what do you believe that
actually is?
<p>
   Emma: All of us have been brought up with very strong mothers. They
taught us to create our own destiny. We call it People Power as well.
Girls can wear their skirts short, but it doesn't mean they don't have
a brain.
<p>
   Melanie B.: For us it confirms that no matter who you are if you
have a dream and you really want to get there, you can. We all come
from normal backgrounds. We were struggling in the industry from the
ages of about 13, so it just goes to show for any girl out there, that
if you want to do something you can. I think the '90s is more about
the equalization between female and male people. A lot of industries
are run by males, and I think that should change.
<p>
   Q: How did Princess Diana's death affect you?
<p>
   Victoria: I think people didn't realize how much good she was able
to do until it was too late. Everybody was more interested in writing
about her personal life.
<p>
   Melanie B.: She was the one person everyone would have loved to
have met. Life is a learning process, and we learned a lot through our
success, fame and money. We should treat people nicer and with a lot
more respect.
<p>
   Q: Your clothing is very unique; are you trying to make a
statement?
<p>
   Victoria: If you go to London you will see a lot of people dressed
like this. We are not trying to make a statement.
<p>
   Emma: People do dress quite funky in England.
<p>
   Melanie B.: We wear what we like, but sometimes we coordinate the
color.
<p>
   Geri: If you think about the '90s, whether it be music, fashion or
film  &MD;  anything goes. There is no set code anymore. ... You don't have
to conform to any particular genre, you can just be yourself and still
stand together.
<p>
   Emma: One of the reasons I wear the shoes I wear is because I am
not tall.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The last week of the Northern Ireland peace talks was anything but
a stately journey toward historic destiny. There were accusations,
histrionics, last-minute hitches. At an alarmingly late stage, it
seemed that basic questions had not been answered, that some key
concepts had not been worked through. And when, after a sleepless
night, a complex deal was reached by exhausted negotiators, suspicions
lingered. Is this real change or just a mutual respite for worn-out
enemies? Was the desire for peace driven by something more than the
momentum generated by deadlines, expectations and the massed ranks of
television news crews?
<p>
   The questions are not abstract. The deal announced Friday will have
to withstand terrible pressures. Fringe terror groups on both sides
will test it with atrocities. Two of the most important parties in the
process  &MD;  Gerry Adams' Sinn Fein and David Trimble's Ulster unionists
 &MD;  will face considerable internal dissent. The political mechanics of
establishing both a workable administration in Northern Ireland and
cross-border bodies with the Republic of Ireland will be extremely
complex. If the deal does not have deep roots, it will be blown away.
<p>
   There are, though, good reasons to believe that the peace package
arises not from a passing moment but from some fundamental shifts. For
one of the more paradoxical effects of 30 years of conflict has been
to give an illusion of continuity to a period of profound change. The
epic language of immemorial and irreconcilable divisions that tends to
be used about Northern Ireland has hidden the fact that many of the
assumptions that held good in 1968 when the killing began simply no
longer apply.
<p>
   In 1922, when the last attempt at a comprehensive settlement
between Ireland and Britain was being debated in the British House of
Commons, Winston Churchill famously contrasted the vast changes in
Europe after World War I with the obstinate constancy of religious
divisions in Northern Ireland. Everything else had undergone ``violent
and tremendous changes in the deluge of the world,'' he said. ``But as
the deluge subsides and the waters fall short, we see the dreary
steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again. The integrity of
their quarrel is one of the few institutions that has been unaltered
in the cataclysm which has swept the world.''

 &UR; PERSPECTIVE ON TAXES: Don't Toss Out the Baby With Reform &QL; 
 &UR; Gale is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Every politician favors marriage, family and improvements in the
tax code. Many routinely criticize the income tax as biased against
marriage and families. Some go much further and claim that we could
eliminate these biases by throwing out the current system and starting
over with a flat tax or a national retail sales tax.
<p>
   While some of the charges against the income tax are valid, they
are exaggerated. But fundamental tax reform will not eliminate the
biases and could even make them worse.
<p>
   The income tax creates penalties for 42 percent of married couples,
because as income rises, tax rates rise and items like the earned
income, child and education credits are phased out. But the tax also
subsidizes 51 percent of couples, through tax brackets that differ
based on marital status and other features. Marriage bonuses actually
exceed penalties by $4 billion.
<p>
   Under the flat tax proposed by Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., households would pay taxes on their wages
and pension income above exemption levels of $11,600 for single
people, $14,850 for heads of household and $23,200 for couples. Armey
says that the flat tax eliminates the marriage penalty, but this is
incorrect. Two people with children could obtain $26,450 in exemptions
if they were not married  &MD;  one filing singly, one as household head  &MD; 
but only $23,200 if they were married. At a flat tax rate of 20
percent, this would impose an annual marriage tax of $650 per year on
couples with children in which each spouse earns at least $14,850.
<p>
   The proposed national retail sales tax also contains marriage
penalties. To partially offset the regressivity of the sales tax,
households would receive ``demogrants'' or rebates equal to the tax
rate times the poverty line. This year's poverty line set by the
federal government  &MD;  the income families need to stay out of poverty  &MD; 
is $7,890 for one person, plus $2,720 for each additional person. At a
sales tax rate of 30 percent, a conservative estimate, two single
people would be entitled to rebates of $2,367 each for a total of
$4,734. If they married, they would receive $3,183, so their marriage
penalty would be $1,551.
<p>
   Advocates like to assert that tax reform is ``pro-family'' and
point to the demogrants in the sales tax and large exemptions for
children in the flat tax. Children and families benefit
disproportionately from numerous features of the current system,
however, including dependent exemptions, child care credits, earned
income credits and education credits. And the preferential treatment
of housing, health insurance and state and local tax payments also
helps families, since they consume relatively more housing, medical
services and government-provided services such as education. All of
these preferences would be eliminated under fundamental tax reform.
<p>
   Moreover, compared with childless couples, families with kids
generally have high consumption relative to income, so switching from
an income tax to a consumption tax would further raise tax burdens
during years when family needs were highest. A study based on 1996
data found that a broad-based, flat-rate consumption tax like a sales
tax or flat tax would hurt families with incomes less than $200,000,
because of the loss of tax preferences, but would help families with
income above $200,000 due to the dramatic reduction in the top tax
rate.
<p>
   Advocates might claim that families would benefit from reduced
hassles of tax filing and increased economic growth. While tax
complexity is a real problem, many families actually have quite simple
tax returns: 22 percent file simplified 1040A or 1040EZ forms, and 56
percent do not itemize their deductions. Economic growth effects also
can be overstated. Reasonable estimates suggest that a well-designed
consumption tax would raise income per person by at most 2 percent
over the first 10 years, and a poorly designed reform could reduce
growth.
<p>
   Thus there are some cautionary lessons here. First, the existing
system may have some redeeming features to go along with its obvious
headaches. Second, special attention needs to be given to unintended
effects of tax reform. Third, finding fair ways to tax married versus
single taxpayers and those with children versus those without is not
easily addressed by dogmatic approaches.
<p>
   Fortunately, many reforms that are sensible and achievable  &MD; 
including closing loopholes, reducing rates and simplifying taxes  &MD; 
also would reduce tax penalties on marriage and help families.
Politicians would do well to improve the existing system rather than
radically change it.

 &UR; At Minnesota School, the Aged Still Seek Wisdom (Northfield, Minn.) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn.  &MD;  Spring quarter at the Cannon Valley Elder
Collegium began last week. Students made their way to classes rather
slowly, but hardly anyone was late. Some came in wheelchairs, others
used walkers. Some steadied themselves by leaning on friends, arriving
arm-in-arm with a classmate.
<p>
   Blind in one eye, Julia Savina sat pitched forward in her seat,
using a magnifying glass to read the course syllabus she had just been
handed. The instructor prints everything in extra large type for the
students in his technology class, but Savina still needs a little help
seeing.
<p>
   She is 81.
<p>
   Last semester, she enrolled in a course on Amish history but had to
drop out when she fell and hurt her hip. The retired schoolteacher
returned to her studies after four weeks of physical therapy.
<p>
   ``My husband died in 1995, and I really need this mental
stimulation,'' Savina said, easing into a chair to talk after class.
``I had so much fun last term learning to write poetry, which I never
thought I could do.''
<p>
   Gray-haired and frail, she smiles as she leans back into her chair.
``You can only play so much bingo, you know.''
<p>
   And so it goes here at perhaps the nation's only institution of
higher education designed specifically for the aged. The students'
bodies may be weakened, but their spirits are willing. If some are
hard of hearing, their minds are hungry still.
<p>
   The Cannon Valley Elder Collegium opened last fall in this cozy
little two-college town 40 miles south of Minneapolis. A group of
retired professors and academics rounded up roughly $8,000 in
government grants and recruited nearly 30 of the former faculty
members who live in town to teach college-level courses with titles
such as ``The Drama of Henrik Ibsen,'' ``Goethe's Faust'' and ``The
Fur Trade in North America.'' No arts and crafts here.
<p>
   Enrollment this quarter has jumped to about 50 students, most over
65 and many in their eighties, although no one knows for sure because
``at our age we don't go around asking people how old they are,'' said
Ron Ronning, 68, a retired high school humanities teacher and CVEC's
program director.
<p>
   Collegium students can receive continuing education credits, but no
grades are given, no degrees conferred. No one here is looking for any
of that.
<p>
   ``Everyone here really wants to be here,'' said George Soule, a
retired literature professor who is teaching ``Hamlet'' to about eight
seniors this quarter. ``They're not looking for a better job or to
further their career by being here. They're not here to impress their
parents. All they want to do is learn.''
<p>
   At the Elder Collegium, there are no fraternities, no backpacks, no
baseball caps worn backward, no hungover students nodding off in the
back of the classroom. Students here are more likely to wear
orthopedic shoes than Nikes, hearing aids than earrings. Each class
lasts for eight weeks and costs $50, and the source of students'
financial aid is more likely to be a pension than a parent or Pell
grant. Most of the students enrolled in a course on the Great
Depression last quarter had actually lived through it.
<p>
   ``We initially wanted to call it Last Chance College,'' Ronning
jokes. ``Or Old Geezers University.''
<p>
   As the elderly live longer, the number of people 65 or older
enrolled in college courses has risen steadily over the last decade.
Hazel H. Reinhardt, director of marketing research at the Newspaper
Management Center of Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism, said the trend is likely to accelerate in years to come as
the baby boomer generation, with its higher rate of education, moves
into retirement.
<p>
   ``I think this whole area is one that is going to develop,'' she
said in a telephone interview.
<p>
   With two highly regarded liberal arts colleges  &MD;  Carleton and St.
Olaf  &MD;  the quaint, bucolic town of Northfield is home to an uncommon
brain trust: Of nearly 15,000 residents, roughly 150 are retired
professors. A road sign on the periphery of this learned but
fun-loving town bills Northfield as a place for ``cows, colleges and
contentment.''
<p>
   ``Everybody here is in a book club or two,'' Ronning said. He said
he and his wife, Bettye, had attended some casual group discussions
held at senior citizen centers that ``frankly, we found ... a little
patronizing. It's as if people think that seniors are either unwilling
or unable to engage in serious study. The collegium provides just
that. There are assignments, and people come prepared.''

   NORTHFIELD, Minn.  &MD;  The Cannon Valley Elder Collegium's ``Hamlet''
course
<p>
   is held at Northfield's Retirement Center. Eight seniors at a
conference table pay rapt attention to George Soule, a white-haired,
animated man who lectures at a rapid-fire pace on Shakespeare.
<p>
   ``His characters tend to be very complex,'' says Soule, a retired
literature professor who is teaching the play to about eight seniors
this quarter. ``They're far deeper than many people I've known in real
life.''
<p>
   Soule engages his students in a discussion of the play's opening
verse. Virtually all of the students in the classroom contribute
something to the dialogue. One of Soule's students is Marilyn Will,
59, a retired schoolteacher whose former students include Soule's
daughter, now 31. Widowed two years ago, Will enrolled in two courses
last quarter. She came back for more this quarter and brought along a
friend, 81-year-old Jane Eckardt.
<p>
   ``I have always loved education from both sides of the desk,'' says
Will, a small woman who first attended college 40 years ago. ``I just
came to class expecting to be filled up back then,'' she says. ``Now I
feel as though I have something to contribute to the class and to the
discussion.''
<p>
   As she says this, an exaggerated grimace spreads across Eckardt's
face. ``It won't be any different for me,'' says Eckardt, who first
enrolled in college in 1934. ``I still expect to just be filled up.
I'm dead between the ears.''
<p>
   Will smiles at her friend's familiar, self-deprecating brand of
humor. The two women taught school together and have been friends for
a quarter century.
<p>
   ``Our husbands were friends,'' Eckardt says. ``We gave each other
advice on our kids.'' She leans forward and lowers her voice. ``We
tried to figure out what was wrong with them.''
<p>
   During a break, Will asks Eckardt if she could pick up a copy of
``Hamlet'' for her. ``I'll just shop for both of us, and you can lay
the money on me later,'' she says to her older friend.
<p>
   Eckardt pauses. ``Did I remember to lay money on you for my
registration?'' she asks. ``Yes, you did,'' Will reassures her.
<p>
   ``That gets to be a problem when you're 81,'' Eckardt says. ``But
really I'm just here because I love Marilyn. I just love to be around
her.''
<p>
   At his wife's urging, 66-year-old Donald Krause enrolled in
``Cultural Conversations.'' On Tuesday evenings, he'll debate topics
such as the role of an activist federal judiciary with his peers and a
group of local high school students.
<p>
   ``This is fun,'' said Krause, a retired schoolteacher. ``You know,
most senior citizens aren't just waiting to die. We can actually
discover a thing or two.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  A couple of guys named McColl and McCoy have been
shaking up the banking business for the past 10 years. Now, in
separate deals revealed this week, they are creating the second- and
fifth-largest banks in the country.
<p>
   And just last week Citicorp, which was bumped from the number one
spot when Chemical Bank merged with Chase Manhattan in 1996, announced
its own mega-merger with Travelers Group Inc., forming the world's
largest financial services company.
<p>
   ``It's elephant mating season,'' says a banker friend. The best
thing to do is stand at a safe distance and watch.
<p>
   What you'll see is something clumsy but healthy. Thanks to
regulations enacted more than 70 years ago and to the incredible
political clout of small-town bankers, this country's banking system
has been a balkanized mess. The mergers are making banking more
efficient  &MD;  costs squeezed out, better services offered  &MD;  and that's a
good thing.
<p>
   In fact, what would be really good to see is more and bigger
mergers  &MD;  especially across international, not just state, borders.
Global banking would not only be less costly and more convenient but
also less risky and more transparent.
<p>
   Alan Meltzer, economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon University,
uses Korea as an example. Its economy is the 11th largest in the
world, which puts it on a par with the economy of Los Angeles County.
But banks serving L.A. alone would find themselves in deep trouble if
the local economy went sour-just the situation with Korean banks
today. If Korea were the site of global banks, however, profits from
loans in the United States, Latin America and Europe would offset the
Korean losses. There would be no need to call in the IMF for a
bailout.
<p>
   The mergers also point out that it's time, at last, to eliminate
that hoary anachronism the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which was intended
to divide commercial from investment banking. Banks have circumvented
the law, but investment firms such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. cannot. Not
only is this distinction unfair but ultimately it hurts consumers, who
would benefit from hotter competition.
<p>
   Even with the changes over the past 15 years, there are still far
too many separate banking companies in the United States: 11,000,
including credit unions and savings and loans. Most of these banks, of
course, are very small. The typical one has just seven branches and
total assets of less than $100 million. For decades, most of them,
while poorly run, had profitable franchises because they lacked
competition. As consolidations unfold, the better ones will survive as
boutiques for clients willing to pay a little more for custom services
and extra attention. But most Americans, whose needs for loans,
insurance, brokerage, retirement accounts, savings and checking are
straightforward, will bank at a financial supermarket.
<p>
   Could a few of these elephants (to switch metaphors) muscle all
their competitors out of the way and stomp on consumers with large
costs and lousy services? That's possible, but doubtful. Citibank,
Chase and BankAmerica account for just 19 percent of the loans
outstanding at U.S. commercial banks. If the latest deals are approved
by regulators (as they should be), then the three biggest banks will
have $1.2 trillion in assets, and the 10 biggest will have $2.2
trillion. Sounds like a lot, but it's only one-third of all the
banking assets in the country.
<p>
   The merger between Hugh McColl's NationsBank, based in Charlotte,
N.C., and BankAmerica of San Francisco will produce an institution
with $532 billion in assets-still smaller than banks in Germany and
Japan.
<p>
   But what really makes U.S. banks different from their counterparts
around the world is their robust pursuit of profits  &MD;  and that's the
objective of the mergers. Through competition, this single aim
produces remarkable variety, and it ultimately gives individuals and
businesses better services at lower prices. For instance, NationsBank
and BankAmerica are fashioning a truly national bank, with branches
from Washington state to Florida, and they figure they can slash their
back-office expenses by more than $1 billion.
<p>
   By contrast, Banc One's merger with First Chicago creates a
fortress franchise in the Midwest  &MD;  plus a behemoth (ranking number
two) in the credit-card business. John B. McCoy, CEO of Banc One,
based in Columbus, Ohio, has further national ambitions as well.
Travelers, meanwhile, merged with Citicorp largely to access the
world's best distribution network for financial products.
<p>
   There are dangers. The mergers make more institutions ``too big to
fail.'' Knowing that regulators won't close them down in a crisis,
bank managers may get reckless in their lending. A second danger is
simply that it will take years for managements to get their arms
around these giants they've created. If a recession occurs before new
controls are in place, the consequences to these banks, and to the
U.S. economy, could be severe.
<p>
   Elephants mating can certainly trample the underbrush, but in
general we we have little to fear when they merge, and a great deal to
gain.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In the old days, when the circus was the circus and
children dreamed of running away with it, the clowns got rained on. It
was their fate.
<p>
   David Larible remembers the day he told his father he wanted to be
a clown.
<p>
   ``He was not happy,'' Larible remembers. Not that his father didn't
like the circus  &MD;  the family had been in the circus for generations.
But a clown? The son of an equestrian-acrobat mother and a
trapeze-artist father becoming a clown? ``He said, `Why do you want to
be a clown?' ''
<p>
   It is between shows at Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus,
and Larible is in makeup and costume. His dimples are black, his
eyelids powder blue, his nose bulbous, his shoes huge. He is a clown,
a famous one now. How could his father know a clown could be a star?
<p>
   Back then, in the ``cook tent'' where the circus ate, the social
diagram was clear. The owners and star performers  &MD;  the bareback
riders, the trapeze artists, the headliners  &MD;  sat in the center of the
tent, separated by a curtain from the tumblers and jugglers, the
troupe's middle class. Beyond them were the daredevils  &MD;  the human
cannonballs and such  &MD;  and finally the clowns, considered mere filler
between acts, relegated to the outermost circle, where the wind blew
tent flaps and the rain splattered them while they ate.
<p>
   Near the bottom of the social ladder was the working class  &MD;  the
roustabouts and others who raised the tents, set up the chairs and
swept the rings, so low that they were supposed to speak to performers
only when spoken to.
<p>
   Most of the tents are long gone; Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey
moved into arenas more than 40 years ago, and the hierarchy that
Larible grew up in has loosened. His beaming face is even an
advertising staple for Ringling Bros. (at the D.C. Armory until April
19), though most clowns still rank near the bottom. The circus has
changed, but it remains a closed, old-fashioned world, a nomadic
society and an inbred one. Still defined by the ties of blood and
sawdust, it has its mores and aristocracy.
<p>
   Anyone seeking a map to the social hierarchy of the circus need
only ask who gets a whole car on the Ringling Bros. train and who has
to wedge an entire life into a ``roomette.''
<p>
   ``It all depends,'' says Anthony Johnson, who handles public
relations for Ringling Bros., ``where you fall on the food chain.''
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Families of performers, often Eastern European families, have
traditionally been the glue holding the circus together. They possess
a mystique that is easy to market: ``The Flying Wallendas! Dad, Mom
and the kids defying death together!'' They have a loyalty, savvy and
potential for breeding more performers, and this makes them attractive
to circus owners.
<p>
   In this show, there are the Flying Caballeros on the trapeze, the
Guerreros and their seven-person pyramid on the high wire, and the two
families at the pinnacle  &MD;  the Laribles and the Gebels.
<p>
   Four of the Laribles perform: David's wife is an aerialist and both
his mother and his 8-year-old daughter appear in his act.
<p>
   And at the head of the Gebel family reigns Gunther Gebel-Williams,
the legendary animal trainer and longtime star of Ringling Bros. He
recently ceded the ring to his son, the not-yet-as-legendary Mark
Oliver Gebel, whose wife, Christina, performs with baby elephants.
Although Gunther is officially retired, he still lives with the
circus, trains all the animals and is known around the place as The
Boss.
<p>
   The Laribles and the Gebels are whole-car families. Families are
still families, even when walking on a tightrope. They have their
internal fissures. At least one circus family is currently split and
performing with three different companies, with some of the members
not even speaking to others. And between the clans tensions can
develop as well.
<p>
   Author Bruce Feiler, who wrote ``Under the Big Top: A Season With
the Circus,'' about his tour as a clown with the Clyde Beatty-Cole
Bros. Circus, remembers hearing about two competing tumbling families
who traveled with the circus the year before he did. ``They used to go
into the ring and try to outdo each other and taunt each other,'' he
says. ``That's the kind of thing that just doesn't happen on Ringling.
Someone would just say, `Put an end to this right now!' ''
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   People like to say that the circus is a small town, or a village on
wheels, or one big family  &MD;  no description quite works because it's
all so familiar and so strange at the same time. People who spend
their work-lives bouncing off seesaws and onto the shoulders of
colleagues go home to family cookouts and Tupperware parties. They all
travel 48 weeks a year, visiting 95 cities and performing 975 times in
the course of a two-year tour.
<p>
   ``Some people think it's a real unstable life, but it's stable
within its environment,'' says paymaster Linda Cimini.
<p>
   Feiler says: ``As paradoxical as it seems, the overwhelming feeling
I had while I was in the circus and the recollection I have of it now
was how safe it was. Because of the fact that it exists on the fringes
of America, because the people are often maligned by mainstream
Americans, circus people are so protective of their own. To this day,
I could walk onto any circus lot anywhere in the world  &MD;  and I've done
this in about half a dozen different countries  &MD;  and say I spent a
year as a circus clown in America, and within 10 minutes I'm eating
dinner in someone's trailer. This not just my natural charm. It's `You
are part of us.' ''
<p>
   There's a school, taught by a teacher and by a clown with an
advanced degree in education. There is a priest: Assigned by the
Catholic Church to tend the roving flock, he has an e-mail address of
circusrev. There's a newspaper, the Red Review, named for the Red Unit
(Ringling has two different circuses traveling at all times, the Red
and Blue units).
<p>
   Those seeking parties on the Red Unit gravitate toward what is
known as Clown Alley. Many of the 18 clowns on this show (15 men,
three women) are exceptionally young, some just out of high school.
Anthony Johnson laughs and says, ``It's like a fraternity. They're
doing the dumb things young guys do.''
<p>
   For years, the Ladies' Wardrobe was another neighborhood, one Chris
Cross aspired to when she joined the circus as a young newlywed in
1981. She started out selling programs and dreamed of the wardrobe.
<p>
   ``Ladies' Wardrobe was the ``wives' ' job  &MD;  it was the place to
congregate. You did needlepoint, you knitted, they had birthday
parties,'' she says fondly, remembering the cozy female niche with its
sequins and companionship.
<p>
   Her husband, Matt, was in the band, and they had joined the circus
for a little adventure after childhoods in small-town Ohio. Their
adventure turned into 15 years. The traveling life, the constant
change, the camaraderie, keep them on the train.
<p>
   By now, Cross is long past Ladies' Wardrobe, where she worked in
the late '80s. She is a unit controller for the Red Unit, overseeing
payroll and tallying up profits from each show. Matt plays the
keyboard and is in charge of the sound effects, such as the fabricated
hippo roar he created by fooling around with the vocalizations of a
senior vice president of Feld Entertainment, a Vienna, Va., company
which owns Ringling Bros.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Some stay. Some leave.
<p>
   And some come back.
<p>
   Linda Cimini has been on the road off and on since 1977. She lived
in Florida, started working for a theme park Ringling ran down there,
then went on the road. She sold souvenirs, worked in the wardrobe, did
makeup for the clowns, went to clown college herself. She married a
Ringling clown, toured with the Clyde Beatty circus for a while, and
after 15 years of marriage got divorced and thought she might be done
with it.
<p>
   She left for two years. Got a good job, working for Marriott in
Florida. Went back to school. Lived in an actual house. And then
Ringling called.
<p>
   ``I had some unfinished business,'' she says now. Had she traveled
for her husband, she wondered, had the circus been all about him? ``Or
was I on the road for me? I had to decide that.''
<p>
   She returned as paymaster, and within six weeks was asked out by
the stablemaster and vet technician who for years was known as Camel
Pete. By the time they dated, Pete Cimini had added postmaster to his
workload, along with editor of the troupe newsletter  &MD;  few people in
the circus do only one thing  &MD;  and been renamed Postal Pete.
<p>
   They've been married two years and are still on the road, but Linda
now knows why she's doing it. They have plans to leave, to buy a
campground somewhere, but the time is not yet right. Pete keeps
getting new opportunities and she doesn't want to rush him. If they'd
already left he might never have learned that when animal trainer Emil
Popescu gets a sore throat, his sea lions will soon stop eating  &MD; 
whether because their throats hurt too or out of neurotic attachment,
Pete can't say, but he puts human and beasts on antibiotics just to be
safe.
<p>
   When he heard there would be a trained hippo in this year's show
(``ZUSHA, QUEEN OF THE NILE!''), he thought, ``A hippopotamus! That
will look great on my resume!''
<p>
   But Linda's sister sends her ads of campgrounds for sale, and Linda
fantasizes about planting a flower and not having to take it in at
night for the move to the next town. And as she changes, the circus is
changing, too.
<p>
   Almost every day, the real world seems to seep deeper into the
circus. Animal rights activists picket and protest. In some towns,
it's now illegal to present live animal acts. Insurance payments are
so high Ringling Bros. long ago stopped letting local celebrities ride
the elephants from the train to the arena. Just the other day Mark
Oliver Gebel noticed the guys hanging the wires and rigging were
wearing hard hats. ``I've never seen it before,'' he says, shaking his
head. ``I grew up in the circus  &MD;  hard hats!''
<p>
   Ladies' Wardrobe is no longer a place for the wives  &MD;  the costumes
are cared for by professionals. The performers are younger, and fewer
come from circus dynasties. ``People once said there was a certain
magic about circus families,'' Cimini says. ``It's not so much the
families now. It's people who want to be performers, people who have
watched families and said, `I could do that.' ''
<p>
   The success of New Age troupes like Cirque du Soleil, with their
theatrical lighting and direction, have prompted Old Age circuses  &MD; 
and Ringling Bros. in particular  &MD;  to adopt sophisticated lighting
systems, smoke that billows out of machines to create ``atmosphere''
and a pacing to match TV. What happens in the three rings is now
closer to a theatrical performance, further from a venture into what
David Larible calls ``a court of wonders.'' It is more like Las Vegas,
more like Hollywood, more like everything else.
<p>
   There are those who say the circus risks losing its identity, and
its appeal. In fact, the Blue Unit, which played New York while the
Red Unit was in Washington, has a more traditional circus feel, with a
giant and a dwarf and a touch of the sideshow. Rumor has it the Red
Unit will emerge from its winter redesign a little closer to the old
circus as well.
<p>
   But the 127th show still has months to go on this tour. Come Sunday
night, the wires will come down, the citizenry will pack up, and the
small world of the circus will move on.

 &UR; A Gymnast Joins the Circus Family (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Here is how blood and sawdust create circus rank, and
here is how one woman, teamed with an old circus family, works to rise
in this world.
<p>
   The woman with the body of a lithe preteen introduces herself this
way: ``I am Lucy Petrov. That's not actually my name. It's Kirlova.''
<p>
   But Lucy Kirlova joined up with the performing Petrov Family, so
she is Lucy Petrov. Trained as a gymnast, the Bulgarian signed on with
Todor Petrov and his wife, son and daughter-in-law nine years ago.
They can walk wires, work with animals, juggle, balance and
reconstitute themselves over and over into new acts: Whatever the
circus needs, they will become. In a world in which adaptability is
perhaps the highest virtue, such families are invaluable. Lucy has
been riding elephants, but she is moving up.
<p>
   The Petrov family rates nothing near the entire train car bestowed
upon the Gebel and Larible families. They live in a trailer and are
far from headliners, but they are true circus. The Petrovs performed
around Europe, traveled with Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. (that
old-fashioned tented circus will settle at the Montgomery County Fair
Grounds in Maryland May 4 and 5), and last year won a contract with
Ringling Bros.
<p>
   Some circus people claim Ringling, which is owned by the Feld
Entertainment empire of Vienna, Va., does not pay as well as some of
the lesser-known circuses. It is also more tightly controlled, more
carefully managed. Because of all that, as well as the limits on
autonomy that go with living on a company train (rather than the
trailers most tent-circus people drive), some performers prefer the
smaller circuses. But Ringling is a resume item that can only help a
career. As Lucy Petrov says: ``It is the Greatest Show on Earth.''
<p>
   Hours before show time, she's working on her ambitions. There are
no elephants in sight. She hangs by her knees 20 feet above a juggling
clown and a band rehearsing fanfares. Her trapeze soars, her hair
ripples like a curtain in the wind. Todor Petrov stands below,
coaching. She swings forward, then back, and in an instant has bent at
the waist, straightened her legs, flipped and twisted around so
quickly that she is a blur of hair and limbs. But then, instead of
catching the trapeze again with her knees as she is supposed to, she
falls.
<p>
   The wire attached to her harness catches her before she can drop
more than a few inches. She spins on the wire and lurches for a
moment, then grabs at the swing and remounts it. She starts the trick
again. When she finally gets it right, when she can assemble the flips
and slides into a routine that looks fluid and assured before an
audience, Lucy Petrov will be ready to rise above the elephants. She
will become a Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Woman of the Rainbow,
part of the act that opens the 127th edition of the Greatest Show on
Earth.

 &UR; A Campaign That Never Ended &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Thirty years ago, my father, Robert F. Kennedy, launched his
campaign for the presidency. The spring of 1968 was a dark time for
our country, and was to become darker still. But the memory of my
father's campaign, and the principles and values at its heart still
resonate because of his hopefulness and because he appealed to
Americans' moral courage and faith in one another to overcome whatever
lay ahead.
<p>
   For many, the core mission of that campaign never ended. Scarcely a
day goes by when I am not approached by people who tell me that their
lives were changed by my father because they worked on his campaign or
were inspired by his words and actions.
<p>
   On March 18, 1968, speaking before 18,000 students at Kansas
University, he gave his first major campaign speech. He noted the
great strength of the economy but cautioned us against measuring
ourselves by wealth alone. The GNP, he said, ``counts air pollution
and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of
carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those
who break them. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the
health of our children or the joy of their play, the intelligence of
our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It
measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our compassion nor
our devotion to our country. It can tell us everything about America
except why we are proud that we are Americans.''
<p>
   It is uncanny how contemporary his words sound. Our country has
never been more prosperous than it is today. My father would certainly
welcome our economic vitality and the good it has brought to the lives
of Americans. But at the same time, I can hear his voice warning us
that the true measure of a person, and of a nation, is found in
something more profound than economic well-being. Precisely at this
moment, he would be impatient for us to turn our minds and our hearts
to the deeper needs of our country.
<p>
   Without question, Robert F. Kennedy would be heartened by the
progress our country has made in specific areas he focused on: the
reduced threat of nuclear war; the collapse of communism; our steps
toward peace with former enemies; the resurgence in community service
and volunteerism; the realization that cigarette companies must be
held accountable for the damage they have done; and the expansion of
health insurance to millions more children.
<p>
   But my father saw progress as an opportunity to rise to tougher
challenges, and he would find no shortage of challenges today. Drug
cartels and organized crime syndicates are quickly becoming the de
facto powers in many countries around the world. Rogue regimes raise
the specter of chemical or biological terrorism. Some of the world's
largest economies are undergoing wrenching change and dislocation that
could open the door for totalitarian regimes.
<p>
   Our education system fails to prepare many children for the future.
One out of two children can expect to spend some time growing up in a
single-parent home. Crime rates have indeed fallen sharply, but a
young African-American man now has nearly a 1 in 3 chance of spending
time in prison.
<p>
   We have a moral obligation to tackle these problems, and to a large
extent, we know what works. At every level  &MD;  national, state or local
 &MD;  and on every issue  &MD;  crime, health, education  &MD;  public successes
have come when citizens are fully engaged in the problems of their
community and work with government, nonprofits and business to solve
them.
<p>
   Sadly, too many of our citizens and especially our children seem to
lack the will to devote themselves to meeting these challenges. A
recent poll showed that just 27 percent of our young people said it is
important to them to be aware of what is going on in the political
system. Only 17 percent said they were interested in influencing that
system.
<p>
   The fault is not theirs. All too rarely do we speak to our youth
about their ability and their duty. If we did so on a national scale,
we would see a quick turnaround. For instance, 95 percent of high
school students who fulfilled Maryland's community service requirement
 &MD;  the first of its kind in the nation  &MD;  said they believed they would
get involved in volunteerism after graduation. It gives me great
personal satisfaction, as a public official and as Robert F. Kennedy's
daughter, to have worked on an initiative that builds upon his vision.
<p>
   My father was never afraid of the truth, and he had an unflinching
optimism and faith in the power of democracy. He believed no
challenge, however complex, was beyond the ability of the American
people if we confronted it honestly, debated it frankly and worked
together to find and apply a solution.
<p>
   That conviction led him to go to Mississippi to witness the depths
of want and poverty suffered by blacks in the South. He returned to
our home in the suburbs of Washington as the entire family was sitting
down to dinner. He entered our dining room ashen-faced and said, ``A
whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are
covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no
food. Do you know how lucky you are? Do you  &UR; know &LR;  how  &UR; lucky &LR;  you
are? Do something for your country.''
<p>
   If my father were alive today, I know he would say those same words
to us all.
<p>
    &MD;   &MD;   &MD; 
<p>
   Townsend, eldest child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, is lieutenant
governor of Maryland.

 &UR; Volcano Ravages Life, Economy of Montserrat &QL; 
 &UR; (Little Bay, Montserrat) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LITTLE BAY, Montserrat  &MD;  It is little more than a shrubby swath of
undulating mountainside perched above the sea in the northern part of
this tiny Caribbean island.
<p>
   But government officials envision that Little Bay will eventually
be transformed into the seat of government, commerce and culture in
Montserrat, a 39-square-mile British colony that over the last three
years has seen virtually every aspect of its society ravaged by the
Soufriere Hills volcano.
<p>
   Since the volcano roared back to life in July 1995 after centuries
of dormancy, flows of ash, rock and gas have buried the colony's
capital, Plymouth, and forced the evacuation of the southern
two-thirds of the island, including the town of Salem, the island's
nerve center for much of the crisis.
<p>
   The population has withered from an estimated 11,000 people before
the eruptions began to just over 3,200. The economy has been
obliterated: Only about 30 businesses are left, among them just two
banks and a pair of restaurants. The three remaining insurance firms
offer no new property coverage, threatening future construction and
the ability of residents to secure mortgages.
<p>
   Against this backdrop, Montserrat is embarking on a formidable
task: in effect, re-creating itself on the island's northern side, an
area shielded from the volcano by large hills and considered
relatively safe, barring what scientists say would be the unlikely
event of a massive eruption.
<p>
   The ultimate challenge, officials say, is to lure back the
Montserratians who have emigrated, many of whom were the colony's
wealthiest, brightest and youngest.
<p>
   ``It is not often that a society has a chance to start over and
look at it in the end and say, `This is our creation.' Many times,
societies begin sporadically and just grow,'' said David S. Brandt,
Montserrat's chief minister. ``The most important thing is to convince
all Montserratians wherever they are that this is a worthwhile
exercise we are doing and we need everybody to participate.''
<p>
   Brandt said he hopes that Montserrat's economy can reemerge as one
driven largely by light industry and information services, using its
telephone ties to the world via a microwave link to Antigua, 30 miles
northeast. Observers say diversifying the economy is crucial to the
island's future; now about 33 percent of the jobs are in government
and more than 20 percent are in construction.
<p>
   While so much for this eastern Caribbean island hinges on the
behavior of Soufriere Hills, there has been cause for encouragement
the last six weeks, during which the volcano logged its longest and
most quiet period since 1995.
<p>
   ``There is still a low probability of a catastrophic event, but it
is more likely that it is gearing down,'' said a scientist at the
Montserrat Volcano Observatory. He stressed, however: ``This does not
mean it is over. These things operate on long time scales, versus
human time scales. ... We are waiting to see whether the eruption is
over or whether its behavior is changing.''
<p>
   In the meantime, 100 new homes financed by the British government
have been completed in the northern section of the island. As part of
the $92 million that Britain has either committed or spent in aid to
Montserrat over the last three years, another 150 houses are to be
built later this year.
<p>
   The Caribbean Community and Common Market, a regional economic
organization, is also helping to fund 30 other prefabricated dwellings
from Cuba.
<p>
    &UR; -(optional add end)- &QC; 
<p>
   Nearly three years after the volcano began erupting again, 517
displaced Montserratians remain in shelters. Many people here question
London's commitment to Montserrat's future, saying that perhaps the
British are concocting excuses when they say red tape has hampered
delivery of more aid.
<p>
   Montserrat Gov. Tony Abbott, a British official, defended his
country's handling of the crisis, saying that Britain has been as
forthcoming as possible with assistance.
<p>
   ``I can fully understand the feelings of the Montserratians who
remain on the island. On the other hand, I can understand the caution
that the British government is exercising here because of the volcano,
as well as the difficulties in getting aid money released when there
are so many global demands on it,'' Abbott said. ``I believe the
British government has been very generous.''
<p>
   Many Montserratians are eager to return, and several hundred have
done so this year, marking the first population increase since the
Soufriere Hills calamity began. More are expected to try to come back,
as their relocation benefits run out soon. But a lack of housing will
invariably limit that number.
<p>
   Those who have stayed in Montserrat have done so out of either love
for the island or apprehension about starting a new life elsewhere.
<p>
   ``If this place goes up, it goes up with me. If it goes down, it
goes down with me,'' said Joe Phillip, 48, a taxi driver for 22 years.
``Why leave here to go someplace else to struggle? I am too old to go
and start from scratch.'' &QL;

 &UR; The Truth About Deception &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Never mind who's telling the lies. The real question is, why are we
so easily deceived?
<p>
   From the half-truths that proliferate in the marketplace to the
intimate deceits of a lover, from the little white lies of everyday
life to the denials of the nation's leaders, deception is pervasive in
our daily interactions  &MD;  and for the most part it succeeds.
<p>
   ``We are sort of like Diogenes looking for that one honest person
out there, and in looking for that one honest person we are more
likely to be duped,'' says Chris Wetzel, professor of psychology at
Rhodes College in Memphis.
<p>
   Teaching a research seminar titled ``Detecting Con Artists and
Impostors,'' Wetzel has been analyzing a fundamental paradox of these
dishonest times: How come we so often see deception coming and still
get blindsided by it? The answer, he and other psychologists who study
deceit say, is that suckers are indeed born every minute. In fact, our
mental health and the social fabric of society practically depend on
it.
<p>
   ``We are predisposed to believe,'' says Wetzel, adding that, except
for the most cynical or paranoid people, we live by what is called
``the truth bias.'' People generally want to believe something is
true. And, while that proves day after day to be a shaky assumption,
it is nonetheless a prerequisite to comprehending what someone is
saying. ``Only after you comprehend what is said,'' he explains, ``can
you make adjustments and consider its validity.''
<p>
   But to scrutinize the veracity of everything would take an
extraordinary cognitive effort that's beyond most people  &MD;  in effect,
substantiating the aphorism ``ask no questions, hear no lies.'' Most
people ``don't have the energy or time to go to the next level of
comprehension and question something's validity,'' says Wetzel. ``The
busier we are, the less likely we'll do it. So we just continue on the
assumption that it's true.''
<p>
   To assume what people tell us is true also goes a long way toward
not upsetting the apple cart of social interaction. To assume the
opposite creates chaos, says Wetzel. In a course last semester, he
announced that he would mix one lie into each lecture. And he would
count it against students who failed to detect the lies and included
them in exam answers, he warned. After several weeks, he had to stop
the experiment. His students had begun to question everything he
mentioned.
<p>
   ``It became disruptive to the class,'' he says. ``You almost have
to become a paranoid to question everything and see what's going on,
and most of us are not willing to pay that price. It would almost
drive you nuts to be that vigilant for the truth.''
<p>
   Brad Blandford believes people are incapable of knowing when others
are lying unless they themselves are totally honest. ``We'll buy
anything,'' says the Stanley, Va., psychologist, author of ``Radical
Honesty: How To Transform Your Life By Telling The Truth'' and leader
of Radical Honesty workshops that teach people to live honestly.
<p>
   Mentioning a survey of 40,000 Americans in the book ``The Day
America Told the Truth,'' Blandford says 93 percent admitted they lied
regularly and habitually at work. Of the married people surveyed, 35
percent admitted they either had had or were currently having an
extramarital affair. ``Lying is of epidemic proportions,'' he says,
blaming it for much of the anxiety, depression and psychosomatic
illnesses so prevalent in society today. ``So it turns out that
everyone is just guessing about everyone else.''
<p>
   In many ways, the entire dynamic of telling and believing lies is
what makes truth more of a stranger than fiction, as Mark Twain put
it. Accepting even suspect lies turns out to be the path of least
resistance many people choose to follow. Whether it's the auto
mechanic calling to say the clutch also needs to be replaced, or it's
an employee calling in sick on a sunny spring day, confronting a
suspected lie ``can make for a very ugly scene and a lot of people
aren't willing to go through that trouble,'' says Wetzel. ``Once we
believe we're being fed a line, it is more difficult and socially
awkward to call someone on a lie than to let it go'' or give them the
benefit of the doubt. Allegations surrounding the Clinton sex scandal,
with its his-word-against-her-word dynamics, says Wetzel, ``has been
an ugly scene for about three months now  &MD;  and that's one reason
people just want it to go away.''
<p>
   Further complicating matters is the element of unconscious
collusion  &MD;  when the deceived prefers the lie to the truth. In
January, University of Virginia psychologist Bella DePaulo released
the latest findings from her continuing research on everyday lies in
close and casual relationships. She found that about a quarter of lies
told to people close to us are ``altruistic lies''  &MD;  the
no-you-don't-look-fat kind of fibs supposedly contrived for the
person's own good.
<p>
   ``They'd tell people they looked good, or made a great dinner, or
that they understood just how they felt,'' reports DePaulo. ``They are
lying to spare someone else's feelings, to make them feel better, or
spare them embarrassment.
<p>
   ``In the abstract, I think we understand that when people are
saying these things they don't always mean them. And yet you want to
believe it. It's hard to step back and say `Oh, but did they really
like my dinner?' Because you do really want to believe these
altruistic lies.''
<p>
   And even the more serious lies, says DePaulo. ``Take, for example,
an affair. You don't know for sure if it is happening and you wish it
is not happening. And if you see through the lie to the truth that is
being hidden, it can be a disaster. If you put everything out on the
table, nothing that seemed in place is secure. It's all potentially
over.''
<p>
   Besides, through no fault of our own we simply are not good at
detecting lies. Despite hundreds of studies trying to identify the
telltale behaviors or linguistic signals that accompany a lie, ``there
is no perfectly reliable sign of lying, no Pinocchio's nose,'' says
DePaulo.
<p>
   Part of that is because different people tell lies differently. And
the very behaviors and attributes that make someone seem to be
believable are also what she has found common among those who tell the
most lies. ``If you feel really sure someone is lying,'' warns
DePaulo, ``it is just as likely they are telling the truth.''

 &UR; Mexican Government Deports Foreign Observers in Chiapas &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico  &MD;  Tom Hansen, a human rights
activist and social worker from Chicago, was buying supplies in a
small town near here two months ago when he was detained by Mexican
immigration officials and handed over to four heavily armed men in
street clothes.
<p>
   They ushered Hansen, who had been in the conflict-ridden state of
Chiapas for two days working with indigenous people, into an old
yellow sedan. ``When I asked them for identification, they laughed and
told me they could beat me up and put me in a crate,'' Hansen
recounted in a recent interview. ``I was pretty well convinced I was
going to be killed.''
<p>
   Instead, he spent the next 24 hours being ferried from Chiapas to
Mexico City to what he described as an immigration prison and being
interrogated by various Mexican officials who refused to allow him to
see an attorney, make a telephone call or contact the U.S. Embassy.
They finally put him on a plane and expelled him from the country for
committing a cardinal offense  &MD;  meddling in Mexico's internal affairs.
<p>
   Hansen was one of the first in a wave of foreigners  &MD;  including a
French priest who served here for 32 years and an American student on
spring break  &MD;  who recently have been thrown out of Mexico for
allegedly participating in the long-simmering conflict in the southern
state of Chiapas, where masked rebels launched an armed rebellion four
years ago demanding greater rights for Indians.
<p>
   Mexico escalated the crackdown on foreigners on Sunday, deporting
12  &MD;  including three Americans  &MD;  who were arrested when about 500
state and federal policemen stormed a small community that had
recently declared itself autonomous from the local elected government
and sympathetic to the rebels, known as the Zapatista National
Liberation Army. News services identified the Americans as Jeffrey
Conant, Michael Zap and Travis Loller, all of San Francisco.
<p>
   Police also beat two news photographers who were taking pictures of
the foreigners at the airport in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of
Chiapas, continuing a recent government campaign to hinder press
coverage  &MD;  particularly by foreign reporters  &MD;  in the state.
<p>
   Mexican officials said the roughly two dozen foreign visitors
deported so far this year were expelled for violating their tourist
visas by working, which requires a special visa. But the officials
acknowledged that the underlying reason for the expulsions was the
belief that the foreigners were intervening in Mexican politics, which
is a violation of the country's constitution.
<p>
   Many analysts said they believe the true motive was to intimidate
human rights workers and stymie international criticism of Mexico's
human rights record following the December massacre of 45 unarmed
Chiapas peasants by a group aligned with the ruling political party.
The matter is particularly sensitive now because Mexico is negotiating
a new trade agreement with the European Union, which weighs a
country's human rights record when considering trade accords.
<p>
   ``This xenophobia campaign is an attempt to discredit international
observation and to lump us with the enemy  &MD;  to make it appear that we
are engaged in political activity,'' said a European human rights
worker based in San Cristobal de Las Casas, who asked not to be
identified because he is in Mexico on a tourist visa. He added that
many human rights workers were coming to Mexico on tourist visas
because the government refused to give them working visas.
<p>
   ``We don't want our people demonstrating in the (town square) or
marching or making statements to the Mexican press. Our role is to
distribute information outside of Mexico, to put international
pressure on the government.''
<p>
   Fernando Solis Camara, a top immigration official in Mexico City,
said the government welcomed humanitarian workers and human rights
observers with the proper visas, which he said were easy to get. But
foreigners engaging in political activities ``are simply a factor that
complicates (finding) a solution to the Chiapas problem,'' he said,
because they help polarize the politics, spread propaganda and
discourage communities from accepting government aid.
<p>
   The issue has been complicated by Mexico's long-standing tradition
of allowing visitors to participate in a variety of activities on a
tourist visa; by the isolated communities in rural Chiapas, which have
always viewed foreigners with suspicion; by the role of the Roman
Catholic Church, which has encouraged international observation and
which the government accuses of siding with the rebels; by Mexico's
equating any foreign meddling with a threat to its sovereignty; by the
outpouring of international support enjoyed by the Zapatistas; and by
the influx of foreigners wanting to visit Chiapas following the
December massacre. Many of the visitors are trained observers,
academics and relief workers, but others are more akin to adventure
tourists who want to be more deeply involved.
<p>
   ``Some are earnest and good-willed people who do not know what they
are getting into and want to be in solidarity with poor people,'' said
Eric Olsen of the Washington Office on Latin America, a private think
tank. ``Sometimes they don't have the political savvy to know when
they've crossed the line.''
<p>
   That was apparently the case during a reporter's recent visit to
Oventik, the small community sympathetic to the Zapatistas that has
roped itself off and declared itself autonomous from the elected local
government. When a military troop transport drove by, a half-dozen
Italians raced to the main gate and took pictures as community
officials implored them not to bother the army.
<p>
   A foreign anthropologist who has worked in Chiapas for more than 10
years said that at some point the conflict here became a sort of
``phenomenon'' that attracted all types, in addition to the academics
and social workers who have been visiting for decades. ``Those kids
coming down to make revolution on spring break are probably
particularly irksome'' to the government, he said.
<p>
   Sometimes, it is a fine line that separates tourism from
observation from activism, as illustrated by Global Exchange, a San
Francisco human rights and education group that since 1994 has sent
more than 500 Americans on ``reality tours'' to observe the situation
here. Participants meet with community leaders and are encouraged to
write up and share their impressions of Chiapas  &MD;  with friends, with
family, with congressmen  &MD;  when they return home.
<p>
   ``The fact that they are observing reality in Chiapas is our
intention, but they are not working in any sense,'' said Ted Lewis,
head of the organization's Mexico project.
<p>
   Others, like Hansen, 44, acknowledge that they were working while
on a tourist visa, but say it was with the obvious knowledge of the
government. In fact, he said, his project  &MD;  a $35,000 program to
provide video cameras to Indian communities ``so they can tell their
own story in their own words''  &MD;  was partially funded by the Mexican
government.
<p>
   ``I think they're trying to scare the foreigners out of Chiapas,''
he said, ``and the people who suffer the most are the indigenous
communities, because they are left with less access to technical and
humanitarian aid, and they're more vulnerable to human rights
abuses.''

 &UR; Novelist Charles Johnson's Doctrine of Nonviolence (Seattle) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  It was a warm spring day, the first of the season, so
Charles Johnson had opened the window in his college dorm room.
Through it, he heard a voice shouting: Martin Luther King Jr. had been
shot. There was no context, no further information. Across the country
the riots were beginning. Johnson was in black studies at Southern
Illinois University, a Marxist, a respectful if distant admirer of
King. But he didn't riot, didn't even leave his room.
<p>
   Instead, he drew an editorial cartoon for the campus newspaper, a
variation of a drawing that became popular after the assassination of
JFK: the Statue of Liberty on one knee, weeping, covering her face
with her hands. Johnson doesn't remember anything else about that
fateful 1968 day. All he has left is the tangible product, the
drawing.
<p>
   Typical, he says. ``Even as a kid, my way to respond to things was
through drawings or writing. Through art. That's how I expressed
myself. That's my whole life. That's all I've ever done. I get
passionate and experimental in the work, but I live a quiet, simple,
boring life.''
<p>
   Oh, sure. That's why the novelist is pummeling George, an
amiable-looking dummy suspended from the ceiling of Johnson's workout
room. Thwack. He hits George again. Does anyone in this pleasant
neighborhood know what goes on in here, the savage beatings that are
administered on a regular basis?
<p>
   ``George's purpose in life is to be used for the purpose of being
beaten on. The thing that's good about him is that he looks like a
person.'' He takes down a lance from the wall and stabs George with
it. George looks like he's been through a lot.
<p>
   On the wall, there's a machete that looks like it's also gotten
some use recently. (For cutting the grass, Johnson insists.) There's a
bow for shooting arrows. Plus a poster of the ``Basic Striking
Points''  &MD;  those sensitive areas where a blow can disable or, better,
kill. Johnson plans to highlight them on George.
<p>
   The writer is just fooling around tonight, but he's taken his
martial arts seriously for 30 years  &MD;  ever since he was working in
Chicago as what was then called a garbage man. One of his co-workers
told him about a guy he knew who had used martial arts training to
defend himself against a rampaging drunk. Killed him, too. Johnson
attended the school, learned how to throw 45 punches in 10 seconds and
made it through the critical first cut.
<p>
   ``Me and one of the other guys got double promotions. I was
sailing. I missed my train back to school. I just walked around
Chicago all night waiting for someone to jump me.''
<p>
   No one did, then or later. Johnson is probably the only winner of
the National Book Award who could kill you with his hands, but martial
arts also taught him how to avoid dangerous situations. One of the
best things he says he learned in the school was what to do if someone
wants to fight you: You run. If the guy chases you? You keep running.
If you run into a wall? Tear the wall down.
<p>
   After he explains this, it all makes sense. Johnson, a professor at
the University of Washington, kung-fu instructor and practicing
Buddhist, has learned the tools of violence to keep violence at bay.
It's a lifelong project that, for the last eight years, has been
coupled with a more intellectual undertaking: understanding the life
and legacy of the Rev. Dr. King, America's greatest apostle of
nonviolence.
<p>
   Out of these two strands has arisen ``Dreamer,'' a tightly furled
account of King's last years, partly a respectful close-up of the
civil rights leader himself, partly the tale of a man who looks so
much like King that many people assume he is.
<p>
   ``I can't walk down the street or go to the store without somebody
stoppin' me. Some of 'em spit in my face. That's colored as well as
white. That's why I come here. I figure if I'm catchin' hell 'cause of
you, I might's well catch it for you instead,'' Chaym Smith tells
King, offering to become his double.
<p>
   Sardonic, brutal, an ex-mental patient and possible murderer, Smith
is not only King's look-alike but his opposite. ``There's two kinds of
people in this world,'' Smith says. ``Predators and prey. Lions and
lunch. You see it any other way, buddy, and people will chump you
off.'' Not exactly the reverend's way of looking at things, which is
the point.
<p>
   A double  &MD;  someone who matches another in appearance but not
necessarily in essence  &MD;  is a useful device for exploring the black
and white conflict in America. ``Blacks and whites are mirrors,''
Johnson believes. ``They can only fully see themselves in relationship
to the other.''
<p>
   The Founding Fathers, he adds, cherished freedom enough to break
away from England, but at the same time were slaveholders. ``As
Frederick Douglass pointed out, if you value freedom that much, you've
got to value it for everyone. And King made white Christians more
acutely conscious of the necessity of justice for black people, if
they really believed in those Christian ideals.''
<p>
   All this was a long time ago. ``Dreamer'' had its roots in
Johnson's realization that, for all of the public veneration of King  &MD; 
the national holiday, the schools and boulevards named in his memory  &MD; 
his message had been largely lost. ``The tragedy of his absence is
acutely felt in every fiber of our public and personal lives,''
Johnson recently wrote in CommonQuest: The Magazine of Black/Jewish
Relations.
<p>
   No one quotes the right things from King, he says now. ``You have
guys here in Washington state who are pro-gun who quote King to say he
would be in their favor, that owning guns is a civil rights issue. You
have Louis Farrakhan quoting King. It's like Malcolm X's daughter
said, people take pieces, they don't take the whole thing. That's what
they do with King, too.''
<p>
   Johnson reflects for a second, then speeds on. ``They don't take
the right things. King has this quote that is so important, in which
he says we have to fight on two fronts. The first one is the external
war, the battle against segregation, and the other one is internal. He
said the two have to go together. I don't think they did. One became
predominant, and the other''  &MD;  the battle for self-improvement  &MD;  ``got
swept under the rug.''
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Johnson writes heavily philosophic novels that are very popular  &MD; 
the announced first printing for ``Dreamer,'' which has been getting
generally enthusiastic and some rave reviews, was 75,000.
<p>
   For that, he can thank ``Middle Passage,'' his third novel, which
appeared in 1990. Like ``Dreamer,'' it was the product of considerable
research, in this case on the slave trade. Reviews were good but sales
were modest; the novel might have disappeared if it hadn't been
nominated for and then, in an upset, won the National Book Award. That
made it a best-seller. As a bonus, sales of Johnson's two earlier
novels picked up, he got screenwriting jobs and speaking engagements.
<p>
   Being mildly well-known  &MD;  he gets recognized sometimes in stores in
this city  &MD;  and having all these offers to do all these other things
didn't slow down the fiction. He's always taken his time.
<p>
   ``I never had any desire to be a writer, to have the writer's
life,'' he says. ``All that stuff never appealed to me. It still
doesn't. This isn't a career. I'm not interested in careerism. Screw
that.''
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   In the CommonQuest essay, the writer cites the ``egregious news
stories about black crime, drugs and illegitimacy'' before asking,
``How did we allow this to happen? Between my generation and that of
so many of the children I've seen there has been no transmission of
the triumphs, personal and political, that strengthened black
Americans for centuries, allowing our predecessors to overcome
staggering obstacles in the pre-civil rights era.''
<p>
   Still, redemption, even at this late date, remains a possibility.
While Chaym Smith is an ambiguous figure and his fate in the book's
final pages uncertain, the novel concludes on an optimistic note. Says
the narrator, a young disciple of King's: ``If the prophet King had
shown up the depths of living possible for those who loved
unconditionally in a less than just universe engraved with inequality,
and that only the servants should lead, then Chaym had in his covert
passage through our lives let us know that, if one missed the Galilean
mark, even the pariahs, the fatherless exiles, might sometimes  &MD;  and
occasionally  &MD;  doeth well.''
<p>
   This is a stern admonition and maybe even a call to action,
something novels used to do routinely back in the '60s but only rarely
since. But neither philosophy professors nor Buddhists qualify as
rabble-rousers.
<p>
   ``Christians proselytize,'' says Johnson. ``They say, `If you don't
do this, you're going to Hell.' But I never do. You have to make your
own karma.''
<p>
   Spoken like a true Buddhist.

 &UR; Iraq Executed More Than 1,500 Last Year, U.N. Told (Geneva) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA  &MD;  The Iraqi government summarily executed more than 1,500
people for political offenses last year as the human rights situation
in that country deteriorated to a new low, according to a U.N. special
investigator who Tuesday urged the Security Council to devote as much
attention to that issue as it does to dismantling Baghdad's illegal
weapons programs.
<p>
   Max van der Stoel, a former foreign minister in the Netherlands,
has since 1991 periodically documented the excesses of what he called
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ``regime of terror.''
<p>
   But van der Stoel's latest findings come amid increased
international debate over whether to consider lifting economic
sanctions against Baghdad. The United States and Britain are likely to
cite his report in opposing efforts by Russia, France, China and
others to ease the restrictions.
<p>
   A regular review of the sanctions by the Security Council is
expected soon.
<p>
   Van der Stoel told a news conference Tuesday in Geneva that,
despite Baghdad's claim that the sanctions are the underlying cause of
human rights problems in Iraq, there is no evidence that their
elimination would improve conditions. ``Any Iraqi who is even the
slightest bit critical of the government is in danger, even of their
life,'' he said. ``I don't think if the sanctions would end tomorrow
that the regime would change its ways. It only feels secure by
maintaining its present policy of oppression.''
<p>
   He added that the situation is likely to remain unchanged while
Hussein retains power.
<p>
   Van der Stoel acknowledged some frustration that the human rights
situation in Iraq has failed to draw the kind of international
attention devoted in recent months to the U.N. program for inspecting
Iraq's weapons programs. ``It has not come to the top of the
international agenda,'' he said. He suggested that the Security
Council, which has jurisdiction over the sanctions, should apply more
scrutiny to Iraq's human rights records.
<p>
   Van der Stole presented his report to the annual meeting here of
the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission, the world organization's
main deliberative assembly on human rights. Because Iraq refuses to
let him into the country, he relies on reports from human rights
watchdogs and other observers in bordering countries and on interviews
with refugees and exiles.
<p>
   In its reply to the commission, the Iraqi government rejected the
report, blamed its internal problems on the U.N. embargo and accused
van der Stoel of being a tool of Washington.
<p>
   Van der Stoel cited as the most egregious new violation the
estimated 1,500 executions last year, most in a November and December
``prison cleansing campaign'' that began after one of Hussein's sons,
Qusai, the head of Iraq's special security organization, visited one
of the prisons.
<p>
   Prisoners were shot, hanged or electrocuted on charges ranging from
the attempted assassination of Hussein to belonging to an outlawed
political group, he said. Four Jordanians, however, were executed for
smuggling $850 of auto parts, a matter that severely strained
relations between Jordan and Iraq.
<p>
   Family members who collected the bodies were charged the price of
the bullet in those cases where the inmate had been shot. The
condition of some bodies suggested they were tortured before being
killed.
<p>
   Van der Stoel reported that ethnic and religious minorities,
especially Kurds and Turkomens, continue to be targeted in forcible
relocation campaigns intended to create ethnic Arab majorities in all
regions of the country. Van der Stoel told reporters an estimated
500,000 people had been arbitrarily displaced in the last 10 years.
<p>
   He also cited Iraq's nearly 20,000 officially recorded cases of
forced or involuntary disappearances, the most of any country in the
world; criticized the dismembering, disfigurement and other torture of
prisoners; condemned laws that prescribe the death penalty for those
who insult Hussein; and said delays by the Iraqi government in
cooperating with the United Nations' ``oil-for-food'' program had
contributed to the suffering caused by the sanctions. The oil-for-food
project permits Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil in exchange for
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods that are distributed under
U.N. supervision.

 &UR; Italian Police Arrest Mafia Figure (Rome) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME  &MD;  Police said Thursday they have arrested Italy's second most
wanted Mafia fugitive, a reputed up-and-coming candidate to lead
Sicily's organized crime network.
<p>
   Vito Vitale, 39, was a hitman who had consolidated power over clans
in and around the Sicilian capital of Palermo, police said. ``Vitale
was a rising boss who in only a few years had been able to reach the
highest levels of the Sicilian Mafia,'' Palermo's police chief,
Antonio Manganelli, said.
<p>
   He said Vitale was the most-wanted Mafia suspect behind Bernardo
Provenzano, the highest ranking boss to have evaded arrest.
Provenzano, a fugitive for more than three decades, is elderly and
believed to be in poor health.
<p>
   Manganelli said that after two failed attempts to arrest Vitale in
the past eight months, the suspect was apprehended around noon
Thursday in a farmhouse under construction in the countryside south of
Palermo just yards away from a Benedictine monastery. The owner of the
property and another man in the farmhouse at the time of the raid also
were arrested. Police said Vitale tried to run away, then surrendered
on charges of Mafia association and other counts dating back to 1995.
<p>
   According to investigators, Vitale had risen quickly in the Mafia
power structure in large part because he was the protege of Leoluca
Bagarella, a Mafia boss arrested in 1995. They said Mafia members who
had turned state's evidence told police that Bagarella was impressed
with Vitale's abilities as a hitman and with his willingess to host
Mafia summits on his property.
<p>
   Vitale also was said to have had the support of the so-called boss
of bosses, Salvatore ``Toto'' Riina, who was arrested in 1993 after 23
years on the run. Investigators said Riina, boss of the Corleonese
clan immortalized in the ``Godfather'' movies, had offered Vitale
protection in disputes with other Mafia members seeking to increase
their power bases.
<p>
   ``He is the only true heir of Bagarella and Riina,'' said Palermo
prosecutor Alfonso Sabella who led the investigation that resulted in
Vitale's arrest.
<p>
   Ottaviano Del Turco, president of parliament's anti-Mafia
commission, praised police and said Vitale's arrest showed that law
enforcement was continuing to successfully fight organized crime. The
government began an intense crackdown on the Mafia after the 1992 car
bombings that killed anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo
Borsellino.

 &UR; Key Figure Eases Up on Opposition to Yeltsin Nominee (Moscow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  The first crack appeared Tuesday in the wall of
parliamentary opposition to President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime
minister.
<p>
   The speaker of the lower house, the State Duma, declared that it
would be better to approve the nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko than to
force Yeltsin to order new parliamentary elections in the event of a
stalemate. ``It's a hundred times more important for me to preserve
(the legislature) and let it work to the end of its term,'' said
Gennady Seleznev, a Communist Party member.
<p>
   His statement suggests that a split has developed among the
Communists  &MD;  who comprise the biggest faction in the Duma  &MD;  since
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov has insisted his party will oppose
Kiriyenko at all costs.
<p>
   Kiriyenko received 143 votes in the first ballot on his nomination
Friday but needs 226 to be confirmed. It is unclear if Seleznev's
assertion will generate enough new support to give Kiriyenko the post,
since the ballot was secret, and it is not certain which lawmakers
voted for or against him.
<p>
   In any event, Yeltsin renominated him immediately after the vote,
and a second ballot is scheduled for Friday. If the Duma resists
again, Yeltsin can nominate Kiriyenko a third time; if he is rebuffed
yet again, Yeltsin can call early parliamentary elections. Otherwise,
the Duma's term is scheduled to end next year.
<p>
   The speaker, who predicted Kiriyenko will get 236 votes in this
week's vote, made his remarks after Yeltsin rejected an offer to
present three alternative candidates to the Duma for a straw poll.
Yeltsin refused to consider any other nominees, Seleznev said.
<p>
   Otherwise, Yeltsin has been conciliatory to the Duma all week in an
effort to gather support for his nominee. He invited members with
personal housing needs or other bureaucratic problems to take the
matters up with a presidential assistant, and he pledged that
Kiriyenko would consult closely with the Duma on all legislation.
<p>
   Kiriyenko's opponents have complained that, at 35, the former
energy minister is too young and inexperienced to head the government.
However, a deeper resistance stems from Yeltsin's unwillingness to
reveal who will serve in Kiriyenko's cabinet other than the current
defense, finance and foreign ministers. Before the first vote on his
nomination, Kiriyenko promised to make the choices public this week
but has since backed off.
<p>
   Since neither the prime minister nor his cabinet need belong to the
Duma or be elected to any post to serve in the cabinet, the Duma is
essentially being asked to act on faith.
<p>
   Yeltsin frequently ignores parliamentary opinion and rules by
decree. Tuesday, however, he signed a Duma measure forbidding the
return to Germany of art looted by Soviet troops during World War
II-but only because the Constitutional Court insisted he had to sign
it after both houses of parliament overrode a presidential veto.
<p>
   Presidential aides said, however, that his signature was only a
prelude to another court challenge; he signed it, they say, but still
does not accept the legislation. Yeltsin has been under pressure from
Germany, a major investor and creditor, to return the art, which is
currently in the custody of Russian museums. &QL;

 &UR; ANALYSIS: Unlike Titanic, Tax Code Won't Sink Easily (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In a time-tested show of political theater, Republican
leaders Wednesday will dump the entire U.S. tax code into Boston
Harbor, as though confident that tax reform will soon make the
loathsome load a thing of the past.
<p>
   But unlike the crates of tea jettisoned by colonial patriots, the
tax books will be attached to a strong tether. And once the cameras
switch off and the crowds dissipate, workmen will haul all 101,295
pages back from the deep, proving symbolically what Washington knows
full well: Neither the politicians nor the public is ready to bury the
tax system just yet.
<p>
   ``It is as certain as the Easter Bunny that Republicans are going
to talk about tax reform at this time of year,'' said William
Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
``But this year, with inflation gone and the economy doing so well, it
just doesn't have as much resonance as usual.''
<p>
   Late last year, Republican leaders promised that 1998 would be the
year for tax reform, pledging to pass legislation that would abolish
the current tax code by 2001. Last fall offered an ideal political
moment  &MD;  a brief firestorm created by Senate hearings that exposed
alleged abuses of taxpayers by overzealous Internal Revenue Service
agents.
<p>
   Republicans used that moment to highlight what most Americans
recognize: The tax code is freighted with special-interest loopholes
and mind-numbing complexity.
<p>
   But as Washington turned its attention to presidential sex
scandals, a Social Security overhaul and Republican leadership turf
wars, the tax reform issue has faded. Even as they talk up a new
system that is ``fairer, flatter and simpler,'' Republicans and
Democrats alike are pushing new tax credits and shelters that will
make the system only more cumbersome.
<p>
   ``There is an inability for Republicans to stay on one issue over a
long period of time,'' fumed Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and
tactician. ``Democrats are great at repeating themselves again and
again and again. Republicans say it once, and it's over.''
<p>
   But tactics may not be the only problem. The fervor for tax reform
that Republicans had hoped to tap may never have been real, said
Karlyn Bowman, a public policy analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute. About 58 percent of Americans say their taxes are too high,
down from last year and 1994, according to a recent Gallup poll.
<p>
   Two competing GOP plans are vying for attention. One would replace
the income tax with a 15 percent national sales tax on all goods and
services. The other would scrap the graduated income tax and all its
loopholes, deductions and shelters and replace it with one flat rate
of 20 percent.
<p>
   Republican leaders hope to force the issue by passing a law this
summer that would automatically scrap the current code on Jan. 1,
2001. President Clinton has denounced the idea, saying that abolishing
the code without presenting a credible alternative would rattle
financial markets and unhinge the booming economy.
<p>
   But by setting a deadline for action, proponents insist that the
public and the politicians will unite around a single new system.
<p>
   ``We have to prove to skeptical Americans we're serious about
getting rid of (the current system),'' said Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y,
one of the sunset bill's authors.
<p>
   ``I can't even imagine what would be more responsible than what
we're trying to do: to lay out a thoughtful process and timetable to
draw up and implement a new tax code,'' insisted Rep. Steve Largent,
R-Okla., who is the legislation's other chief sponsor.
<p>
   Three years may well not be enough time, tax experts warn. The
political courage would have to be summoned to overcome the special
interests that helped create so many popular write-offs and loopholes
in the first place.
<p>
   ``Quite frankly, the current code creates enormous amounts of
(campaign) contributions'' from interest groups seeking to keep their
tax breaks or open new ones, said Jim Miller, a budget director in the
Reagan administration who now leads tax reform efforts for Citizens
for a Sound Economy, a free-market interest group.
<p>
   Consider what happened early this month when the Senate tried to
pass a non-binding resolution calling on Washington to scrap the
current tax code. By the time the resolution passed, senators had
inserted clauses to preserve the mortgage interest deduction, the
deduction for charitable donations, and protections for Medicare and
Social Security.
<p>
   They even inserted a clause that defeated the purpose of the
resolution. It read: ``Sunsetting the entire income tax code without
describing a replacement threatens our nation's economic growth and
unwisely eliminates existing tax incentives that are crucial for
taxpayers.''
<p>
   ``It's indicative of how difficult this is,'' said William Gale, a
Brookings Institution economist. ``This (resolution) is barely
sticking a toe in the water, and you've already preserved two of the
most major deductions.''
<p>
   A flat tax that still allows deductions for mortgage interest and
charitable giving would have to be set at 25 percent, Gale said, if,
as proponents say, some reforms would be phased in over several years
to help ease taxpayers' transition to the new system.
<p>
   In addition, political pressure would almost certainly save the
earned income tax credit for the working poor. Businesses would insist
that erasing the deduction for worker health plans would throw more
people into the ranks of the uninsured. According to Gale, that would
push the rate to 27.5 percent or higher, enough to give any politician
sticker shock.
<p>
   The national sales tax might have even more flaws. It could create
incentives for businesses to take transactions underground, offering
customers illegally tax-free purchases if they pay a little higher
price.
<p>
   Worse still politically, both the flat tax and the sales tax would
sharply lower taxes on the rich, mainly by exempting investment and
savings income from taxes.
<p>
   That is not to say the current system can remain indefinitely, said
Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor. Graetz called the
system's demise inevitable, but said it will not happen until
politicians stop fixating on politically unfeasible options.
<p>
   ``You need a solution without the major tax cut for the wealthy
that the flat tax or sales tax would mean,'' Graetz said. ``The right
question is not, `What happened to tax reform?' but `When will we get
to a more realistic agenda?' ''

 &UR; No Rise in Consumer Prices (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  For the second time in three months, consumer prices
didn't rise at all in March, with food prices stable and falling
energy, apparel and tobacco costs offsetting increases in other
prices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.
<p>
   The consumer price index was flat in January and up only 0.1
percent in February. The CPI was up at an annual rate of only 0.2
percent in the first quarter.
<p>
   ``Inflation remains utterly absent,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief
economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York, who predicted that
consumer prices will ``rise less than 1.5 percent in 1998. . . .
Inflation has never been so low so far into an (economic) expansion.''
<p>
   In a separate report, the Census Bureau said retail sales declined
0.1 percent last month to $218.4 billion, after two strong months of
growth. The Bureau also revised February's results upward to a 0.7
percent gain from the 0.5 percent rise reported earlier.
<p>
   Sales fell at auto dealers by 0.7 percent and purchases at both
building materials and furniture stores also fell 0.6 percent.
<p>
   Analysts weren't sure whether the small drop in sales was a sign
that consumer demand may be growing less rapidly than at the beginning
of the year  &MD;  which could signal a slowing in U.S. economic growth  &MD; 
whether it was a one-month blip. Some analysts said the very late date
for Easter, which was last Sunday, may have caused consumers to delay
some of their spring spending until this month.
<p>
   ``We will need to average the March and April data to get a more
accurate view,'' said Dana Saporta of Stone &AMP; McCarthy, a New York
financial markets research firm. ``To the extent the later Easter
lowered March sales, they may get a boost this month.''
<p>
   However, even with the March decline, consumer spending in the
first three months of the year likely rose at a 5 percent annual rate
or more after adjustment for inflation, the analysts said.
<p>
   With prices for many goods either flat or falling, retail sales
naturally rise less rapidly than when inflation is higher. For
instance, sales at gasoline stations dropped 1.4 percent last month to
a level 8.1 percent below the level of March 1997, primarily as a
result of falling gasoline prices. Those prices fell 3.5 percent last
month and are down 14 percent over the past six months, according to
the BLS report.
 &UR; (Optional Add End) &QL; 
<p>
   Excluding often volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core
CPI rose 0.1 percent last month. Over the last 12 months, the core CPI
increased 2.1 percent, the smallest rise for a 12-month period since
April 1966.
<p>
   Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
said his firm's ``leading indicator of inflation'  &MD;  a composite index
of seven statistics that give early warning signals of future
inflation  &MD;  have fallen for five consecutive months. That suggests
``that inflation should remain in the ``no problem' category this
year,'' Harris said.

 &UR; Families Separated by Korean War See Glimmer &QL; 
 &UR; Of Hope for Reunions (Seoul) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea  &MD;  For the last 50 years, Cho Dong-young would
close his eyes and see his little sister, Chae, dancing around their
childhood home, singing a song called ``Spring Lady,'' when springtime
was brighter in the northern part of Korea.
<p>
   For Cho, 74, the fate of his five brothers and sisters and his
parents has been a haunting mystery locked inside the sealed borders
of North Korea. He last saw them when he left home to attend college
in Japan in 1947, shortly before the North's new Communist government
closed off access to the world.
<p>
   As the decades passed, Cho had no word about his family until 10
days ago, when he received a one-paragraph letter from Chae. It had
been routed through Los Angeles and a series of mutual friends, and it
hit Cho like an aching from deep inside. ``She said everybody was dead
but her. I cried all night long.''
<p>
   Cho apologized for smoking and shook with emotion as he showed a
visitor the simple note that began, ``To my dearest brother whom I
miss so much.''
<p>
   For the past four days, North Korean and South Korean government
officials meeting in a Beijing hotel have been discussing uniting
hundreds of thousands of families like Cho's. The talks, widely
described as historic in front-page news accounts here, stalled
Tuesday, with impoverished North Korea's negotiators asking for
shiploads of fertilizer before they would discuss a timetable for
reunions. But there still is guarded optimism about eventual reunions
because both sides are saying they want aging citizens to see their
relatives before they die.
<p>
   North Korea recently has indicated it will help collect addresses
and set up the first direct-mail exchange between families in a
half-century. By June, South Korea is to set up a government
information center to help families locate their relatives in the
North.
<p>
   Since the 1950-53 Korean War, no letters, phone calls or any other
contacts have been permitted between civilians on opposite sides of
the border. While Cold War frontiers have toppled elsewhere in the
world, this holdout is still guarded by a fierce collection of
artillery and soldiers.
<p>
   Kang In-duck, Seoul's national unification minister, announced
Tuesday a new step South Korea will take to help separated families  &MD; 
amending national security laws so people in the South can send small
amounts of money directly to relatives in the North.
<p>
   The sudden flurry of government concern is helping to melt the ice
between the Cold War enemies. In 1970, private groups estimated that 5
million South Koreans had a parent, sibling or child in the North, but
so much time has passed since the isolated state shut its doors to the
world that estimates of how many have immediate family members in the
North now range from 400,000 to 1 million.
<p>
   Millions more have some more distant kin in the North. Cho helped
found a private group that sifts through North Korean newspapers and
other available sources to try to track family members for relatives
here.
<p>
   For decades, Cho tried to find out about his own family. He assumed
when communism took hold that they had moved from the grand home he
grew up in because his father was a well-off landowner. He had no idea
whether they were struggling or happy or dead.
<p>
   ``Being able to see family is a right that everyone in the world
has except here in Korea,'' Cho said. ``It's indescribable the pain,
the tragedy of waiting for so long in the hopes of seeing your own
family.''
<p>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung agrees. His willingness to
engage the North since his election in December is a large part of the
reason there is new optimism that families will be able to communicate
with relatives soon, and perhaps even see them.
<p>
   As always, there is skepticism about North Korean intentions.
Several times North Korea said it would allow family visits and then
at the last moment it demanded something that killed the deal. In
1985, 50 relatives from each side visited and held emotional reunions
in both countries. But then, without explanation, the visits were
stopped.
<p>
   Time is running out for old men like Cho, and as they age their
voices are rising.
<p>
   ``What I want to tell the world is that people like me are getting
old and they deserve to see their loved ones before they die,'' Cho
said. ``This is the best opportunity in years. I am too old for many
more disappointments.''
<p>
   As Cho spoke, an 82-year-old man walked in to his group's office in
Seoul, asked for help in finding his family and poured out another
story of a family divided.
<p>
   When the Korean War started in 1950, the man said, he fled to the
South, along with millions of other men who feared being shot,
imprisoned or forced into military service. He left behind his
pregnant wife and 6-year-old son. ``I hoped I would be able to go back
and see them in a week,'' said the man, who asked not to be
identified.
<p>
   But his wife died during the war, apparently from lack of food,
before she delivered their second child. He has received letters from
his son via China and once waited along the Chinese-North Korean
border for 15 days, trying to arrange for his son to swim across the
river from the North to freedom. But at the last moment, the plan
seemed too dangerous.
<p>
   The father, a retired electronics salesman, said he saw a photo of
his son as a grown man  &MD;  he was tall and appeared to weigh only about
100 pounds. He said all he can imagine is that the happy boy of his
memories is now sick, hungry and needing him.
<p>
   ``It is tearing my heart apart,'' he said, as Cho tried to comfort
him. ``I need to see him before I die.''

 &UR; Uncle Sam Wants Computer Experts! (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Not-so-over-the-hill computer experts, rejoice! Uncle
Sam wants  &MD;  and will pay  &MD;  you.
<p>
   To prevent U.S. government computers from suffering the world's
greatest memory loss at the turn of the century, Uncle Sam will take
extraordinary steps to reclaim retired brainpower. The folks are
needed, quick, to help solve the so-called year 2000 problem.
<p>
   Many computers read only the last two digits of a year. Many
experts predict a global computer crash on the last day of this
century, when computers may confuse the year 2000 with the year 1900.
If that happens, some predict it could wipe out, scramble or misplace
trillions of items of data, key records and the like. Many private
firms and banks have already scooped up some of the best retired
programmers and computer scientists, either as regular employees or
consultants. They can draw their retirement pay plus full salary or
consultant fees.
<p>
   But government rules about reemploying federal civilian or military
workers make it financially unattractive for most people to come back
to work for the government. Salaries are generally reduced by the
amount of the retirees' pensions.
<p>
   Many of the nation's top computer experts are former feds or
military personnel. Many of the civilians left in the past couple of
years  &MD;  while the government was downsizing 300,000 jobs  &MD;  in order to
get special $25,000 buyout payments. Now, some of them are needed back
on the job. Immediately.
<p>
   To lure the retirees  &MD;  both military and civilian  &MD;  back into
federal service, the government plans to waive so-called dual
compensation rules that cut into the paychecks of rehired civilian or
military retirees. It also will relax premium pay rules, on a
case-by-case basis, to make working holidays and overtime, on
emergency projects, more worthwhile. The cost to the government would
be minimal, but the financial incentives for the individual retirees
would be tremendous.
<p>
   Under current rules, retired civilian workers who return to work as
``reemployed annuitants'' have their salaries offset by the amount of
their pensions. Many retired military personnel-mostly ex-officers-who
are hired by federal agencies also are subject to the dual
compensation rules, which reduce their civilian salaries. Both
safeguards were put into law to prevent civilian and military agencies
from allowing workers or officers to retire, on fully indexed
pensions, then be rehired at full federal salaries.
<p>
   But the Office of Personnel Management, in response to pleas from
federal agencies trying to avoid any kind of year 2000 crash, has
decided to waive reemployment pay rules in this instance.
<p>
   A special memo to agency heads from OPM Director Janice R. Lachance
says:
<p>
   ``We want to make every effort to give you the human resources
management tools you need to resolve the year 2000 computer conversion
problem.'' To allow agencies to recruit top experts  &MD;  now retired from
government or the military  &MD;  OPM will ``waive dual compensation
reductions, making it easier to reemploy annuitants who have the
programming skills and system knowledge that you may need.'' The order
will allow agencies to pay high-ranking employees, who can't get full
overtime or premium pay, their full hourly rate for work on emergency
projects.

 &UR; N. Ireland Protestant Politicians to Clinton: Stay Home(Londonderry) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland  &MD;  Some Protestant politicians Tuesday
sent a message  &MD;  loud and clear  &MD;  to President Clinton, who has said
he might visit here to campaign for a ``yes'' vote in this
British-ruled province's May referendum, part of the recently approved
peace process.
<p>
   The message: Stay home.
<p>
   ``I don't think it will be helpful, at this stage, for the
president of the U.S. to become directly involved in a democratic vote
here in Northern Ireland,'' said Reg Empey, chief negotiator for the
largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, at talks that led to a
proposed peace settlement last Friday. ``The people of Northern
Ireland will want to make up their own mind on a very important
question without people from outside the U.K. becoming involved.''
<p>
   A member of Parliament from Free Presbyterian firebrand Rev. Ian
Paisley's smaller hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, which is
scheduled to launch a campaign Wednesday for a ``no'' vote May 22, was
far less diplomatic, accusing Clinton of meddling. ``Northern Ireland
always welcomes world leaders who are coming in friendship, but those
who are coming to interfere in the internal electoral process are
clearly not welcome,'' Peter Robinson said.
<p>
   On Monday, Clinton said he hadn't yet decided whether he will visit
Northern Ireland during next month's referendum campaign and said he
was awaiting advice from the British and Irish governments and
political parties here. ``If it would help, of course I would be
willing to go,'' Clinton said. ``If they said I should go I'd be happy
to go. ... But it would be up to them.''
<p>
   His telephone calls to participants in the 22-month-long
negotiations, including David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionists,
played a crucial role in clinching last Friday's agreement. It
provides for power-sharing between Protestants, who generally want
Northern Ireland to remain under British rule, and Catholics, most of
whom would like unification with the Irish republic.
<p>
   Trimble, whose party netted 33 percent of the vote last year, more
than any other, has not spoken out against Clinton's proposed visit;
like other politicians, he may be in favor of it. For now, though,
Trimble is trying to quell a mutiny in Ulster Unionist ranks, with at
least half the party's 10 members of Parliament believed to oppose the
peace deal. Last Saturday, the party's executive committee backed
Trimble and the proposed settlement by a 2-1 margin. But both face
another hurdle at a meeting of the party's 700-member council this
weekend.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Grand Council of the Orange Order  &MD;  a powerful group
with more than 30,000 members that for two centuries has seen itself
as standard-bearer for Protestants in Ireland  &MD;  is to discuss the
proposed settlement Wednesday at a meeting in Belfast, the provincial
capital. Rejection could doom the peace package's chances among
Protestants, 54 percent of Northern Ireland's 1.6 million people.
<p>
   At the other end of the political spectrum, the policy-making
executive of Sinn Fein met in secret Tuesday to consider the
agreement. Starting this Saturday in Dublin, Ireland, Gerry Adams and
other leaders of the party, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, will seek backing from the party's council.
<p>
   If support isn't overwhelming, the IRA's 9-month-old cease-fire
could be undermined.
<p>
   From May 15-17, Clinton will be in Birmingham, England, for a
summit of leading industrialized nations. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Monday that adding a stop in Northern Ireland was under
consideration.
<p>
   In other developments, officials in Ireland announced Tuesday that
they had released nine IRA members from a high-security prison, the
first such gesture since the agreement reached last Friday.

 &UR; Minnesota Jurors View Contested RJR Memo &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Jurors in Minnesota's landmark suit against the tobacco industry
Tuesday got their first glimpse of one of the 39,000 hotly contested
company documents unsealed by the U.S. Supreme Court on April 6. The
1969 R.J. Reynolds memorandum discusses removing or declaring
``invalidated'' scientific research findings about tobacco that could
prove damaging to the company in court.
<p>
   The brief document, written by RJR scientist Murray Senkus to Max
Crohn of the company's legal department, states, ``We do not foresee
any difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove certain
reports from research files. Once it becomes clear that such action is
necessary for the successful defense of our present and future suits,
we will promptly remove all such reports from our files.''
<p>
   The memo does not detail exactly what kinds of reports were being
considered for removal.
<p>
   The memo goes on to describe seven main reasons that ``about 15
reports each year'' are ``invalidated,'' including confidentiality,
discoveries of inaccuracies or ``erroneous interpretation of data.''
As for the reports ``which you are recommending to be invalidated,''
Senkus suggested that ``we can cite misinterpretation of data as
reason for invalidation. A further reason is that many of these are
needless repetitions and are being removed to alleviate overcrowding
of our files. As an alternative to invalidation, we can have the
authors rewrite those sections of the reports which appear
objectionable.''
<p>
   ``It shows very, very clearly and dramatically how these lawyers
and scientists were conspiring together, joining together to destroy
documents and alter research,'' said Minnesota Attorney General Hubert
H. Humphrey III in an interview.
<p>
   R.J. Reynolds attorney Daniel Donahue accused Minnesota's lead
attorney, Michael Ciresi, of ``grandstanding'' with the document
despite the fact that Ciresi should have known from the company's
filings that no documents were actually destroyed, and that the
reports discussed in the memo have been produced in a number of cases,
including Minnesota's. ``To characterize this as a sudden discovery is
not only disingenuous,'' Donahue said in an interview, ``but is, to
put it generously, wrong.''
<p>
   Since the industry delivered the more than 100 boxes of disputed
documents to the offices of the law firm representing the plaintiffs  &MD; 
the state and insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota  &MD; 
lawyers have been combing through the 200,000 pages for anything that
could strengthen the case against the tobacco industry. The state and
insurer contend the tobacco industry lied to consumers about the
health risks and addictiveness of smoking, and are seeking $1.77
billion in reimbursement for tobacco-related health care costs as well
as changes in the ways the industry markets its products.
<p>
   Humphrey has long called the disputed documents the ``smoking
Howitzers'' in his case. They were drawn from an initial collection of
more than 240,000 internal documents over which the industry had
claimed the legal protections that generally cover communications
between attorneys and their clients and work performed by attorneys
for litigation purposes. Minnesota tried to break the protection by
claiming that the papers are part of a crime or fraud. In March,
Ramsey County District Judge Kenneth Fitzpatrick ordered 39,000 of the
documents at issue released, following the recommendation of the
special master in the case, and the industry exhausted its appeals at
the Supreme Court two weeks ago.
<p>
   Minnesota and Blue Cross filed their suit in 1994, the second of 41
states suing the industry. Tobacco companies settled the first three
cases to come to court, brought by Mississippi, Florida and Texas, for
some $30 billion in anticipation of legislative action on the national
settlement proposal negotiated last year with states and private
attorneys suing the industry. Last week, however, the tobacco
companies announced they were abandoning efforts to mold legislation
based on the settlement and would instead focus their energies on
fighting the leading bill, by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
<p>
   That decision makes the case in Minnesota even more important as a
measure of the value of the legal protections sought by the industry.
<p>
   Humphrey said he hoped the newly released documents would ``have a
dramatic impact in Washington.''

its community together'' amid floods and fires that devastated much of
the city, including the newspaper's own printing plant. The New York
Times won three prizes-for criticism, international reporting and beat
reporting-and the Los Angeles Times won two, for breaking news and
feature photography.
<p>
   The public service award, newspaper journalism's most prestigious
recognition, was the first Pulitzer won by the North Dakota daily,
whose circulation averages 37,000. The paper came out during the flood
with help from other Knight-Ridder Inc. newspapers. Mike Jacobs, the
editor, described himself Tuesday as ``sticky and stinky'' from
champagne being poured on his head in the newsroom.
<p>
   ``I think that the Herald in the days immediately after the flood
was the identity of this town,'' he said. ``It was something that came
from Grand Forks and it went to residents of the community who were
widely dispersed. It was a touchstone for them.
<p>
   ``We have a very fine newspaper staff. It was ready in case a big
story ever came along. And, boy, did a big story come along,'' said
Jacobs of the epochal floods and fires, from which Grand Forks is
still recovering and which destroyed the homes of most of the paper's
57 newsroom employees.
<p>
   Bernard L. Stein, editor of the Riverdale Press in the Bronx, a
weekly with a circulation of 14,000, won the editorial writing award
for pieces on New York City politics. Twice before a Pulitzer
finalist, Stein said Tuesday that his honor ``affirms that there are
wonderful writers and reporters working on community newspapers all
over the country. This award recognizes that fact for all of them, not
just for me.''
<p>
   The annual prizes are administered by Columbia University.
<p>
   Among the New York Times awards, Michiko Kakutani won for criticism
for her book reviews and writing on contemporary literature, and the
Times staff won for international reporting for a series about the
effects of drug corruption in Mexico. The four reporters who worked
the series were Sam Dillon and Julia Preston, a husband-and-wife team
in the paper's Mexico City bureau, as well as investigative reporters
Tim Golden and Craig Pyes. While working on the series for more than a
year, the reporters received death threats and were sued by
politicians they had linked to drug trafficking.
<p>
   Linda Greenhouse of the Times won for beat reporting on the Supreme
Court, in a decision that generated frustration and some discontent
among the five nominating judges for beat reporting. The Pulitzer
Prize Board, which usually picks from among three finalists chosen by
a group of judges in each reporting category, moved Greenhouse from
being a finalist in explanatory reporting and awarded her the Pulitzer
in beat reporting.
<p>
   Kay Tucker Addis, editor of the Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk and
chairman of the beat reporting panel, said that ``there was
disappointment (among the judges in her group) that after 2 days of
looking at 160 entries that the board made another choice, but again
that is their prerogative.''
<p>
   The Pulitzer for reporting of breaking news went to the staff of
the Los Angeles Times for its coverage of a botched bank robbery and
police shootout in North Hollywood. Clarence Williams, a photographer
for the newspaper, won the feature photography prize for portraits of
children whose parents are addicted to drugs and alcohol.
<p>
   Gary Cohn and Will Englund of the Baltimore Sun won for
investigative reporting for a series about the dangers to workers and
the environment when discarded ships are dismantled.
<p>
   The award for explanatory reporting went to Paul Salopek of the
Chicago Tribune for his story about the human genome diversity
project, which attempts to chart the genetic relationships among all
human beings.
<p>
   Russell Carollo and Jeff Nesmith of the Dayton Daily News won for
national reporting for stories about flaws and mismanagement in the
military health care system.
<p>
   Mike McAlary of the Daily News won the Pulitzer for commentary for
columns that scooped the New York City press corps and helped trigger
a citywide examination of police brutality. With a hospital room
interview, McAlary broke the story of Abner Louima, a Haitian
immigrant who was badly injured when police allegedly rammed a stick
up his rectum while beating him in the bathroom of a Brooklyn police
station.
<p>
   Thomas French of the St. Petersburg Times won the feature writing
award for his story about a mother and two daughters murdered on a
Florida vacation.
<p>
   Stephen P. Breen of the Asbury Park Press won the award for
editorial cartooning.
<p>
   The spot news photography award went to Martha Rial of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for her portraits of the survivors of ethnic
massacres in the central African countries of Rwanda and Burundi.

 &UR; Reactions to Drugs Make More than 2M Ill Annually &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   More than two million Americans become seriously ill every year
because of toxic reactions to correctly prescribed medicines taken
properly, and 106,000 die from those reactions, a new study concludes.
That surprisingly high number makes drug side effects at least the
sixth, and perhaps even the fourth, most common cause of death in this
country.
<p>
   The analysis, the largest and most complete of its kind, suggests
that one in fifteen hospital patients in the United States can expect
to suffer from a serious reaction to prescription or over-the-counter
medicine, and about five percent of these will die from it.
<p>
   If the findings are accurate, then the number of people dying each
year from drug side effects may be exceeded only by the numbers of
people dying from heart disease, cancer and stroke, and may be greater
than the number dying from lung disease, pneumonia or diabetes.
<p>
   Experts said the study, which appears in Wednesday's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, is stronger than previous
ones because it looks only at cases in which drugs were taken
correctly. Previous hints of similarly high side-effect rates had been
attributed in large part to people getting the wrong medicines or
taking them in the wrong doses.
<p>
   Only one-quarter of the reactions were due to patients being
allergic to the drug in question. In theory, those reactions could be
avoided by more carefully asking people about known allergies. The
rest of the side effects were classified as essentially inevitable,
bound to affect a certain percentage of the population for unknown
reasons.
<p>
   Pharmaceutical manufacturers, drug regulators and the researchers
themselves warned against overreacting to the numbers, noting that the
study made no effort to measure the benefits of the same medicines  &MD; 
an equally important part of the cost-benefit calculation that
determines the overall usefulness of a drug.
<p>
   ``We're not saying, 'Stop taking drugs,''' said Bruce H. Pomeranz,
the University of Toronto neurophysiologist who initiated the study.
For example, he said, blood thinners may cause fatal bleeding in some
but also save countless lives by preventing heart attacks.
<p>
   Pomeranz called for additional research to determine which drugs
are most problematic and which patients are most at risk  &MD;  information
that the current analysis did not try to gather. Meanwhile, he said,
hospitals should set up improved systems for tracking adverse
reactions as they occur, and for reporting them to federal regulators
so medicine labels can be updated and physicians and consumers can be
better informed about the relative risks and benefits of their
medicines.
<p>
   Michael Friedman, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, said the agency in recent years has implemented new
systems for preventing, identifying and keeping track of adverse drug
reactions. A nationwide electronic network now allows doctors to
report adverse reactions easily over computer lines. And a growing
number of pharmacies are using an FDA-supported system that
automatically prints out side-effect warnings and other information
for consumers when they pick up their medications.
<p>
   ``The important message is not to be afraid of your medication but
to be respectful of the possibility of side effects,'' Friedman said.
``More people are using medications today than ever before, and for
more serious and extreme conditions than ever before. There are real
benefits these patients achieve with these medications, but every one
has a side effect.''
<p>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a
Washington-based trade association, yesterday released a brief
statement urging consumers not to take the findings ``out of
context.''
<p>
   ``The public should be confident that the benefits of medicines far
outweigh the risks and should contact their doctor or pharmacist with
any questions,'' the statement said.
<p>
   Alan Holmer, the group's president, said in an interview that side
effects were inevitable given the increased potency and effectiveness
of modern drugs. ``Drugs are powerful substances and affect different
people differently,'' he said. ``They cannot be made completely safe
for all patients in all circumstances.''
<p>
   According to Pomeranz, however, who conducted the study with
Toronto colleagues Jason Lazarou and Paul N. Corey, the problem is
bigger than had been recognized before and is deserving of more
serious attention than has been accorded. ``Nobody really knew what
was going on with this problem, how serious it is, until now,'' he
said.

 &UR; Summit in Chile Is Next Stop in Clinton's World Tour &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   President Clinton, racking up air miles in a busy schedule of
international travel, departs Wednesday night for a four-day visit to
Chile, where he will be the guest of President Eduardo Frei and
participate in the second Summit of the Americas with leaders from all
Western Hemisphere nations except Cuba.
<p>
   Senior advisers said his objectives include expanding trade,
marshaling international resources to support education, and cementing
friendly relations with countries such as Chile and Brazil that once
were at odds with Washington over government and economic systems but
that in recent years have joined the Latin American parade toward
democracy and free-market reforms.
<p>
   Like many presidents before him, Clinton is spending more time
abroad in his second term than in his first. Last month he visited six
countries in Africa. After Chile, he is scheduled to go to Germany,
England and probably Northern Ireland in May and to China in June.
<p>
   His international ventures provide some respite from the relentless
media and prosecutorial scrutiny of his private life and past
associations. But his senior advisers said the swing through Africa
and the upcoming Americas summit were scheduled long before anyone in
Washington had heard of Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern
whose relationship with the president is under investigation by
special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr.
<p>
   ``The state visit to Chile and the Santiago summit are the
culmination of years-long engagement with the Americas,'' White House
national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said at a
pre-summit briefing.
<p>
   Clinton convened the first hemispheric summit in Miami in December
1994, and Berger said the president is committed to forging a new
relationship with Latin American and Caribbean countries based on
their ``quiet revolution,'' the transition to democratic governments
and free-market economies.
<p>
   If investment of presidential time is an accurate gauge of
presidential interest, Clinton can fairly claim to be more involved
with Latin America and the Caribbean than any of his recent
predecessors. As Berger noted, Clinton ``last year went to Mexico,
Central America and the Caribbean in May, and in October went to
Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.''
<p>
   At the time of the 1994 gathering in Miami, Washington was just
beginning to celebrate a new era in the Americas in which
authoritarian rule, military dictatorship, arms races and controlled
economies were giving way to democracy and economic reform. Large
countries such as Brazil and Argentina were leaving behind the era of
hyperinflation and systematic human rights abuses; Central America was
emerging from the civil conflicts of the Cold War era.
<p>
   As Clinton heads for Chile on Wednesday, his agenda contains few
reminders of those painful years. As Berger and other senior officials
never tire of pointing out, only Cuba has resisted the hemisphere's
democratic wave  &MD;  although democracy appears shaky in Paraguay and
Colombia  &MD;  and only Cuba remains committed to a centrally planned
economy.
<p>
   According to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, the
result has been a burst of economic opportunity for U.S. business.
Last year, she said, ``our exports to Latin America and the Caribbean
grew more than three times as fast as our exports to the rest of the
world. During the second half of 1997, we exported more to our
hemisphere than to the entirety of the European Union.''
<p>
   Clinton had hoped to go to Santiago armed with ``fast track''
authority from Congress to negotiate the creation of a hemisphere-wide
Free Trade Area of the Americas, as was agreed at the 1994 Miami
summit. Congress balked at giving the president that authority, which
would have enabled him to negotiate an agreement subject to
congressional approval but not amendment, but Barshefsky and other
officials said negotiations will begin in Santiago anyway.
<p>
   ``As important as that political declaration was in 1994,''
Barshefsky said, ``the formal launch of these negotiations following
3 years of preparatory work ensures the realization of the Miami
vision. There will be a free-trade area of the Americas; a
comprehensive launch will be initiated in Santiago along with all that
that implies.''
<p>
   Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty, Clinton's chief adviser on the
Americas, said last week that the administration is confident it
eventually will gain fast-track authority but does not need it right
away to begin negotiations.

 &UR; Report Hints of Renewed Tension Over Inspections of Iraqi Sites &QL; 
 &UR; (United Nations) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS  &MD;  A report by U.N. experts says the first inspection
of formerly off-limits Iraqi presidential buildings revealed no sign
of prohibited weapon systems but warns that attempts at further
inspections could encounter Iraqi resistance, U.N. sources said
Tuesday night.
<p>
   An annex to the report, also described by the sources, cites
statements by Iraqi officials that they do not regard the United
Nations' right to search the buildings as open-ended and hints that
Iraq might now take the position that it has discharged its
obligations toward U.N. inspections. If so, that could lead to a
renewal of the recent tensions that led to a crisis in which
Washington threatened to bomb suspect sites in Iraq.
<p>
   These are the main points of the report detailing the findings of
inspections that were carried out at eight presidential sites in
various parts of Iraq between March 26 and April 3, the sources said.
The inspections followed a four-month confrontation over President
Saddam Hussein's refusal to give the United Nations access to the
palaces and subsequent U.S. threats of air and missile strikes against
Iraq.
<p>
   The crisis was defused, at least temporarily, when Secretary
General Kofi Annan went to Baghdad and negotiated with Saddam Hussein
an agreement for U.N. inspectors to search the palaces and other sites
accompanied by diplomats under the direction of Jayantha Dhanapala,
undersecretary general for disarmament affairs. Dhanapala's secret
report was sent to Annan Tuesday. The sources said they tentatively
expect it to be forwarded to the Security Council on Wednesday.
<p>
   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, already
has said that the searches by teams of UNSCOM inspectors and diplomats
turned up no evidence of secret Iraqi nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons programs. That point is spelled out in greater detail in the
report, the sources said.
<p>
   However, the sources added, the report notes that UNSCOM expected
that result since Iraq had several weeks during the standoff with the
United Nations to remove any incriminating material or documents from
the palaces and their subsidiary buildings.
<p>
   Butler and other officials had said their main aim in the first
round of inspections was twofold: to establish the principle that
UNSCOM has the right under its mandate from the Security Council to
search the presidential sites, and to get a baseline idea of the size
and nature of these buildings to aid future inspections. In that
respect, the report says, the initial inspections were regarded as
successful.
<p>
   More ominous, the sources said, is an annex to the report written
by Charles Duelfer, the deputy head of UNSCOM, which describes hints
of a possible future return to obstruction tactics by the Iraqis.
<p>
   Although UNSCOM officials have said the Iraqis generally were
cooperative during the searches, the annex, as described by the
sources, cites several instances when Iraqi officials objected
strongly to the inspectors taking photographs inside the palaces and
surveying them with overhead helicopter flights. The report says the
Iraqis relented in their objections only after the inspectors made
clear they would not budge on these points.
<p>
   In addition, the sources said, the Iraqis indicated at various
times to the inspectors that they understand the agreement with the
United Nations to be of limited duration. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz has said that his government was permitting the now
completed round of inspections to prove its contention that Iraq no
longer has any prohibited weapons and should be freed of the burden of
U.N. economic sanctions.
<p>
   However, UNSCOM says that it has considerable more work to do
before it is able to piece together the whole story of Iraqi weapons
programs. Accordingly, UNSCOM contends that the agreement between
Saddam Hussein and Anan gives the United Nations the power to keep
conducting inspections for as long as it believes necessary. Annan
also has said that is his interpretation of the agreement.

 &UR; Series on Ship Scrapping Hazards Wins Journalism Prize (Baltimore) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BALTIMORE  &MD;  Gary Cohn and Will Englund, reporters for The Baltimore
Sun, won a Pulitzer Prize in investigative reporting Tuesday for a
series of stories exposing the extraordinary hazards to workers and
the environment caused by the little-known industry that scraps old
ships.
<p>
   Their account of migrant workers maimed and killed in sloppy and
unregulated shipbreaking operations from Baltimore to India prompted
the U.S. Navy to drop a plan to send retired warships overseas for
scrapping. The stories also sparked congressional hearings and
prompted the Defense Department to order a study on how naval vessels
can be scrapped safely.
<p>
   ``We were very impressed with how the Sun reporters had taken a
good local story and pursued it to national and even international
scope,'' said Paul C. Tash, executive editor of the St. Petersburg
Times, chairman of the five-member Pulitzer jury on investigative
reporting. ``Some of the scenes were horrifically gripping. That
speaks to the quality of the storytelling.''
<p>
   The Pulitzer for public service went to The Grand Forks Herald of
North Dakota for its coverage of a flood and fire that devastated the
city  &MD;  and the 37,000-circulation newspaper's own newsroom  &MD;  a year
ago.
<p>
   The flood had already put the Herald's presses underwater when the
fire gutted the newsroom. The paper was put together in a makeshift
facility and run off on borrowed presses in St. Paul, Minn., more than
300 miles away.
<p>
   The New York Times won three Pulitzers, for beat reporting,
international reporting and criticism. The Los Angeles Times won for
breaking news coverage and feature photography.
<p>
   The Pulitzer Prizes, considered journalism's highest honor, are
awarded each year by Columbia University on the recommendation of a
board of veteran editors. The 14 journalism prizes come with $5,000
each, except for the prize for public service, for which a gold medal
is given.
<p>
   Englund, 45, now serving a second tour in The Sun's Moscow bureau,
returned to Baltimore Tuesday to join Cohn, 46, a Baltimore-based
investigative reporter, for a champagne celebration in the newsroom.
They gave much credit to photographer Perry Thorsvik, whose haunting
portraits of workers illustrated the series, and Assistant Managing
Editor Rebecca Corbett, who supervised more than a year of reporting
and edited the series.
<p>
   The series was distributed to newspapers worldwide by the Los
Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   The Sun's 14th Pulitzer can be traced to a brief announcement in
September 1995 of a tour of shipwrecks of Baltimore harbor. Englund
went on the tour and wrote about the wrecks but also made note of a
hulking Navy ship, the Coral Sea, in Baltimore for scrapping.
<p>
   Englund looked into the scrapping of the Coral Sea , where
environmental and safety problems lead to the criminal conviction in
May of the salvager , and discovered that the pattern of oil spills,
asbestos exposure and lax safety standards extended far beyond
Baltimore's harbor.
<p>
   He found that with the Cold War over, the Navy had begun selling
off surplus warships for scrap in an attempt to turn a profit from the
obsolete vessels. But in port after port, the scrapping program was
leaving a trail of injured workers, polluted harbors and complex
lawsuits.
<p>
   In May 1995, Englund was joined by Cohn for an odyssey tracking
shipbreaking operations from Wilmington, N.C. to Brownsville, Texas,
where they coaxed wary Mexican migrant workers into describing
hazardous working conditions.
<p>
   Englund and Cohn interviewed ship brokers in New York and London
and eventually followed the story to Alang, India, where more than
30,000 laborers cut ships apart with torches in hellish conditions and
lived in squalid shacks. They described  &MD;  and Thorsvik photographed  &MD; 
barefoot workers toting tons of steel and makeshift funerals for
workers who did not survive.
<p>
   ``I read the stories weeks ago, but I still remember vividly the
scenes in India,'' said Tash, the Pulitzer juror.

 &UR; OMB Choice Lauded for Budgetary, Political Savvy (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In selecting Jack Lew as his new budget director,
President Clinton has turned to a consummate budget professional and
master of legislative detail who once served as chief policy adviser
to the late House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr, D-Mass.
<p>
   Although he has operated largely behind the scenes as a special
assistant to the president and more recently as deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget, Lew was credited with helping launch
Clinton's national service program and providing critical technical
and political advice during the talks that led to last spring's
balanced-budget deal.
<p>
   In the final frenetic negotiations before the White House and
Republican leaders announced their historic agreement May 2, Lew was
the one who scoured the language for political minefields and
unwelcome last-minute changes by the Republicans.
<p>
   ``Jack has tremendous detailed knowledge of the budget process and
individual programs and an excellent knowledge of politics,'' said
Franklin Raines, who resigned Tuesday as OMB director. ``His job was
to make sure that in all of these negotiations everything fit so that
at the end of the day there wasn't any buyer's regret on our part.''
<p>
   Lew, 42, a Harvard graduate who holds a law degree from Georgetown
University, will be the fourth budget director to serve in the Clinton
administration, after Leon E. Panetta, Alice Rivlin and Raines, who
announced yesterday that he is stepping down to become chairman and
chief executive of home mortgage lender Fannie Mae. Lew was acting
director for five months before Raines took over.
<p>
   Although some Republicans believe Lew has a harder political edge
than Raines, he is described as well-regarded on Capitol Hill and
likely to be easily confirmed by the Senate. ``Jack can be a little
more partisan from time to time, but he will do fine,'' said a senior
Senate GOP aide.
<p>
   Lew's appointment is similar to that of CIA Director George Tenet,
another relatively young former Hill staff member and skilled
bureaucratic operator who moved up to head the agency last summer.
<p>
   ``The president didn't blink one second in choosing Jack,'' said
Gene Sperling, chairman of the president's National Economic Council.
``Through both budget wars and bipartisan budget negotiations, he's
earned the trust of the top budget experts throughout Washington on
both sides of the aisle.''
<p>
   Lew has been described by colleagues and associates as a smart,
somewhat nerdy technocrat and legislative craftsman with a passion for
the federal food stamp program and other social welfare policies that
can better the lives of the poor. A Jew whose father immigrated from
Poland, Lew considers community cohesion to be a central part of
religious faith, according to author Steven Waldman, who wrote about
Lew's role in the passage of Clinton's national service legislation in
1993. Lew would regularly take his two children to nursing homes to
visit seniors who had been congregants in his synagogue.
<p>
   Robert Greenstein, head of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, said that while Lew has ``long cared deeply about
the incidence of poverty in the country,'' he has also been ``quite
tough-minded at OMB in working at various poverty programs and trying
to distinguish those that are more effective from those that are less
effective.''
<p>
   ``He's not one of those who would say everything done in the name
of poverty is untouchable,'' Greenstein added.
<p>
   ``He was a total true believer in social policy as (providing)
real-life answers to people's problems,'' recalled Christopher
Matthews, a newspaper columnist and television commentator who served
as O'Neill's press secretary. ``He's a very humble, honest guy.''
<p>
   As O'Neill's domestic policy adviser starting in 1979, Lew was
involved throughout the speaker's often stormy relations with the
Reagan administration. He emerged as an honest broker during the
intense talks that led to passage of reforms of the Social Security
program in 1983. As the talks reached a critical point, Lew was asked
by congressional leaders to call Reagan and then-Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., at a golf tournament to
simultaneously brief them on the emerging deal.

 &UR; Making Up Lost Time Lands Va. Driver in Court &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Valerie Nordstrom was late to work and decided to apply her mascara
as she was driving on Interstate 95 during rush hour.
<p>
   Although she wasn't speeding or weaving in and out of lanes, a
Virginia State Police trooper thought she was endangering the lives of
other motorists and gave her a ticket for reckless driving, a
misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to a year in jail and a
$2,500 fine.
<p>
   Tuesday, a Fairfax County, Va., judge found Nordstrom guilty of the
lesser offense of improper driving and fined her $25.
<p>
   ``Put your makeup on at home,'' General District Court Judge
Jonathan C. Thacher told the 40-year-old Prince William County, Va.,
woman.
<p>
   But Nordstrom was upset by the judge's decision, which would put
three points on her driving record, and said she will appeal.
<p>
   ``Putting on makeup is not any different from dialing a number on
your cell phone, lighting a cigarette, changing radio stations or
drinking a cup of coffee,'' Nordstrom said. ``I don't understand why
it is construed as reckless.''
<p>
   Her attorney, Mark Yeager, asked Thacher to dismiss the case
because there was no evidence that Nordstrom was engaging in any type
of driving behavior that could be called reckless. Virginia law
defines reckless driving as a wanton or willful disregard for the
safety of others.
<p>
   Trooper Robert Thomas testified that Nordstrom was headed north on
I-95, just north of Route 1, shortly before 9 a.m. on Feb. 23 when he
noticed her holding the steering wheel in her left hand and putting on
mascara with her right hand while looking in the rearview mirror.
<p>
   Thomas said that it had been raining and that there was heavy
traffic on the road that morning. He said he watched her put on
mascara for 1 miles before he pulled her over. He said Nordstrom was
``stretched forward'' as she looked in the mirror.
<p>
   ``I asked her why she was putting on mascara in this nasty weather
with heavy traffic, and she said she was running late for work,''
Thomas said.
<p>
   Nordstrom said she will be in Fairfax Circuit Court on June 11 to
argue her case.

 &UR; Administration Proposes Modest IMF Reforms (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Clinton administration Tuesday proposed modest
changes in the international financial system designed to help prevent
the kind of major economic turmoil that has enveloped several Asian
countries over the past several months.
<p>
   The package, outlined in a speech by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
E. Rubin, includes a few measures aimed at forcing big international
banks and other investors to take more of a loss in cases where they
have made shaky loans  &MD;  a politically charged issue in Congress.
<p>
   The proposals, all incremental and some rather technical in nature,
are expected to be discussed by the world's finance ministers in
connection with this week's annual spring meeting of the 182-country
International Monetary Fund here.
<p>
   On Wednesday, Rubin and his counterparts from the United States'
six major trading partners will discuss the issue, and Thursday the
plan will go to a special group of 22 finance ministers charged with
hammering out a consensus on key elements.
<p>
   The U.S. treasury secretary also called on Congress to approve an
administration proposal to expand the United States' line of credit to
the IMF by $18 billion to help replenish some of the organization's
lending resources in case there is another major financial crisis.
<p>
   Although the probability of such a crisis is low, Rubin said, every
day the IMF continues to be underfinanced ``is another day of
vulnerability for American workers, farmers and businesses.'' He said
Congress ``should act, and ... act now.''
<p>
   In general, the package Rubin outlined centers on taking steps to
bolster the existing financial system by encouraging countries  &MD; 
particularly so-called emerging-market nations such as those in Asia  &MD; 
to strengthen their own regulation of domestic banks and finance.
<p>
   It includes these major elements:
<p>
    &MD; Providing more economic and financial data to the public about
what is going on in developing countries' economies so investors would
have ample warning about potential risks.
<p>
    &MD; Strengthening the ability of these countries to regulate their
financial systems by adopting global standards for banking supervision
and having the IMF monitor each country's effort to carry them out.
<p>
    &MD; Changing present procedures to eliminate the built-in protection
now given to banks that make bad loans. The IMF no longer would be
asked to help ensure that borrowers repay banks on time. Instead,
banks would be prodded to negotiate their own debt-rescheduling deals.
<p>
   Rubin also suggested that the major industrial nations help enforce
the proposed changes by refusing to allow in banks from
emerging-market countries unless their home countries comply with
accepted international regulatory practices.
<p>
   The U.S. plan conspicuously avoided any proposals that would seek
to control or rein in unstable markets  &MD;  reflecting Washington's
belief that the Asian crisis was caused more by the region's financial
practices than by any flaws in international markets themselves.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Rubin and other officials have suggested that the Asian crisis was
caused by a combination of secretiveness in Asian financial dealings,
poor regulation and so-called ``crony capitalism,'' which eschews
Western-style arm's-length transactions.
<p>
   International officials said it was not clear yet whether the other
finance ministers would accept Rubin's proposals as is or make major
substantive changes. Some finance ministers from other countries are
expected to propose additional measures.
<p>
   On another issue, Rubin again warned Japan that it must do more to
stimulate its domestic economy, but cautioned that it may be
``premature'' to criticize Tokyo's latest economic package as
inadequate  &MD;  at least until officials see the details of the Japanese
plan.

 &UR; Consumer Price Index Shows Inflation Continues Under Control (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Americans received a double dose of good news on the
inflation front Tuesday: The government reported that consumer prices
remained unchanged in March, and there were signs that the economy may
no longer be in danger of overheating.
<p>
   The Labor Department's monthly consumer price index was flat last
month after edging up 0.1 percent in February and holding steady in
January. Over the first three months of the year, the combined rise in
consumer prices has held to an annual rate of 0.2 percent.
<p>
   At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that retail
sales levels across the United States edged down by 0.1 percent in
March, reflecting dampened demand for a wide range of products, from
autos and building materials to furniture.
<p>
   The new figures came as a relief to the financial markets, which
have been fearful that the Federal Reserve Board, worried that
inflation could rebound, would raise interest rates to help slow down
the economy. Stock prices rose after the price index was reported.
<p>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said the
reports showed ``an utter absence of inflation,'' and predicted a
significant slowdown  &MD;  both in consumer spending and in overall
economic growth  &MD;  in the April-June quarter.
<p>
   The halt in consumer prices came partly as a result of another
sharp drop in energy prices, which have been plummeting as a result of
falling worldwide demand. Energy prices plunged 1.3 percent in March,
with gasoline prices falling by 3.5 percent. Grocery prices dipped by
0.1 percent in March.
<p>
   At the same time, the department said its so-called core rate of
inflation  &MD;  excluding food and energy prices, which often are volatile
 &MD;  edged up by only 0.1 percent in March, following increases of 0.3
percent in February and 0.2 percent in January.
<p>
   Analysts have offered a variety of theories to explain the current
good fortune on the inflation front, from recent increases in
productivity  &MD;  output per hour of work  &MD;  to advances in technology and
competition from foreign imports.
<p>
   Nevertheless, forecasters say the economy still is a long way from
a period of widespread ``deflation,'' which some doomsayers fear might
push the world into a major recession. For that to happen would take a
generalized decline in wages and prices.
<p>
   The slight falloff in retail sales levels for March is the latest
of several recent signs that the economy might be slowing. The
government reported earlier this month that factory orders fell 0.9
percent in February. And job growth actually declined slightly in
March.
<p>
   Economists have been predicting that the U.S. economy would slow
somewhat as a result of the Asian financial crisis, but so far the
impact has been more modest than expected.
<p>
   The hold down over the past three months has stemmed largely from
energy prices, which have plunged during the period at an annual rate
of 21.1 percent. Transportation prices also dropped sharply, falling
at a 5.2 percent pace, while apparel prices declined at a 2.1 percent
annual rate.

 &UR; AT&AMP;T Data Network Up and Running Again &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Tuesday fixed its broken data-transmission network, after 24
hours of failure that crippled much of the nation's credit card
authorization system and thousands of bank machines and computer
terminals.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. Chairman C. Michael Armstrong issued an apology to
thousands of customers who suffered business losses, and said the
company was working hard to ``identify, isolate and fix'' what
analysts are calling the largest data-networking failure in history.
<p>
   The outage began Monday afternoon on AT&AMP;T's ``frame relay'' system,
which businesses and governments use to send computerized information
to far-flung offices, suppliers, banks and customers.
<p>
   Engineers working through the night narrowed the cause of the
system's crash to two of the 145 electronic switching stations in the
network. They managed to get the system working again, but remained
uncertain on what caused the crash.
<p>
   ``The nature of frame-relay is such that an outage at a couple of
switches can spread like a contagion everywhere else,'' said Melanie
Posey, a senior analyst with International Data Corp. in New York.
``It just shows you that no matter how great and wonderful a certain
technology is, you have to have a backup plan.''
<p>
   The shutdown affected daily data transactions that most people take
for granted. Retailers including Home Depot and Radio Shack lost the
ability to approve credit card sales, and many could not transmit bulk
sales and payroll information or perform inventory control.
<p>
   In most cases, backup systems kicked in, but at greatly reduced
efficiency. ``We were affected by it, but it was a minor
distraction,'' said Carolyn Brookter, spokeswoman for the Target
retail chain.
<p>
   For others, however, the trouble was more serious: One Northern
Virginia defense contractor was out of touch with 700 employees in
four cities across the nation, according to Timothy Jasionowski, a
Rockville consultant to the company. ``They were completely isolated
from each other for 20 hours, unable to use the Internet, send e-mail,
or communicate back to the corporation,'' he said.
<p>
   Hardest hit among credit card companies was MasterCard
International Inc., which recently gave up private data lines in favor
of AT&AMP;T's less-expensive frame relay service.
<p>
   ``It did cause some problems for us to get authorizations,'' said
spokesman Edward Dixon. But he said that ``obviously MasterCard has
lots of redundancies built into its network, and all of that kicked
in.''
<p>
   Visa USA Inc. still uses its own private lines for its main
network, though Visa spokesman David Sandor said merchants and banks
that connect to the Visa network using AT&AMP;T's service could not get
through.
<p>
   The shutdown was good news, of sorts, for John J. McDonnell Jr.,
president and chairman of Transaction Network Services Inc. in Reston,
Va., which transmits roughly half of the nation's dial-up retail
credit card authorizations. He said business shot up 25 percent
Tuesday, because merchants were making repeated attempts to complete
credit card approvals. The shutdown shifted much of the credit risk
onto retailers and their banks, McDonald said. Faced with losing a
big-ticket sale, he said, many merchants will approve a charge without
an authorization.
<p>
   Most federal government agencies also were affected. AT&AMP;T and
Sprint Corp. evenly divide the government's telecommunications
contract, called FTS 2000. Medicaid claims, defense contracting, State
Department communications and the Federal Communications Commission
all experienced data slowdowns or shutdowns.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said it would not charge customers until it has clearly
identified the problem and fixed it.

 &UR; Paid Informants Are Controversial Part of IRS Arsenal (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Americans voluntarily hand over most of the $1.3
trillion owed to the Internal Revenue Service each year, but a tiny
fraction of tax collections depends on an obscure and increasingly
controversial IRS program of using paid informants.
<p>
   Motivated by a combination of greed and revenge, informants are
typically business associates, employees, acquaintances, neighbors or
former spouses of tax cheats. Many experts say the program is one of
the most unseemly parts of the U.S. tax system.
<p>
   However, IRS officials say they exercise great care in handling the
informants, weeding spurious allegations, and that the rewards play an
important role in the nation's tax enforcement system.
<p>
   The IRS pays the informants up to 15 percent of the taxes it
recovers from their tips  &MD;  up to a maximum of $2 million  &MD;  though the
vast majority of informants end up empty handed.
<p>
   After a series of recent congressional disclosures about widespread
taxpayer abuses, watchdog groups are growing concerned about the
ethics of the agency's informant reward program.
<p>
   ``We should refocus our efforts on good citizenry, not bribing
people to answer questions,'' said John Berthoud, president of the
nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union, who called on the IRS to end the
program in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
<p>
   The program, authorized by Congress, has been sharply criticized by
individuals who say they were victimized by bogus allegations, and
even by informants, who say the IRS has stiffed them on their rewards.
<p>
   The Senate Finance Committee, which has been broadly investigating
IRS abuses over the past year, is expected to unveil new evidence
later this month that taxpayers have been devastated by aggressive IRS
investigations based on phony information from snitches.
<p>
   Tax attorneys and accountants generally decry the informant reward
system, asserting that the government is on thin ice in offering money
to taxpayers to turn each other in. They argue that a cornerstone of
the U.S. tax system is the protection of taxpayer privacy, and that
the IRS is wrong to encourage people to breach confidential business
or family relationships. In one case, a St. Louis tax accountant
informed on his own client.
<p>
   ``It smacks of communism, turn in your parents if you catch them
cheating,'' said San Francisco tax attorney Frederick Daily, author of
the book ``Stand Up to the IRS.''
<p>
   Bruce Hockman, a top Los Angeles tax attorney whose clientele
includes the rich and famous, refuses to help clients snitch to the
IRS. ``I have had people come in and ask me to take them downtown to
IRS district headquarters,'' Hockman said. ``I say no way. The Nazis
did it, turn people in. It is unseemly.''
<p>
   Tipsters are one of the important parts of the IRS tool box for
enforcing tax compliance, says Thomas J. Smith, assistant IRS
commissioner for examination and chief of the agency's informant
reward program.
<p>
   IRS figures for 1996, the last year for which data is available,
show that 9,430 Americans sought rewards. Of those, the IRS acted on
just 650  &MD;  meaning that 93 percent of the tips ended up in the IRS
garbage can. The IRS paid out $3.5 million in rewards and recovered
$103 million in taxes.
<p>
   ``If you look at the last three years, we have had 2,000 cases
closed, resulting in taxes of $797 million,'' Smith said. ``So, in
terms of dollars, most people would judge that as reasonably
significant. It does supply a very useful source of information for
us.''
<p>
   The IRS has a national informant hot line, (800) 829-0433, though
many informants walk in or call in to the IRS's 33 district offices or
10 regional service centers, Smith said.
<p>
   With little fanfare and with no explanation, the IRS last year
decided to boost the maximum allowable award to $2 million from
$100,000. It also set a minimum reward of $100, eliminating a lot of
penny ante payments.
<p>
   In 1996, the agency's largest award was a jackpot-size $1.06
million. (The agency does not disclose who gets the awards or what
cases they involve.) The agency's smallest was just $18  &MD;  less than
the typical reward advertised in newspapers for lost dogs.
<p>
   Under the new guidelines, rewards range from 1 percent to 15
percent of the tax recovered, depending on the assistance provided by
the informer. But all awards are at the ``discretion'' of IRS
officials, who make their decisions behind closed doors. Of course,
the rewards are taxable income.
<p>
   The IRS takes a low-key approach, not seeking to send the message
that the federal government is actively recruiting paid stool pigeons.
The agency does not make Form 211, which informants must fill out to
claim a reward, widely available. It isn't even kept in the IRS
national headquarters lobby, where the agency has almost every form on
display.
<p>
   Asked if the IRS encourages Americans to inform on others, Smith
said he could offer no advice and suggested that individuals do what
they feel is right. But former IRS officials are more blunt.
<p>
   ``Informants rewards are pretty distasteful to everybody except the
person who gets one,'' said Phillip Brand, a tax expert at KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP and former IRS chief of compliance. ``People have a
different feeling about informing when they do it as good citizens.''
<p>
   Another problem with paying for information is that the IRS gets a
lot of garbage information. Brand recalled a tipster once sought a
reward for the disclosure that the secretary of state was dealing
drugs to Queen Elizabeth and not reporting the sales on his taxes.
<p>
   But weak allegations are less humorous when the IRS pursues them
against innocent taxpayers. That apparently happened to John
Colaprette of Virginia Beach, Va., whose home and two restaurants were
raided in 1994 by armed IRS agents after his bookkeeper, Deborah A.
Shofner, made phony allegations.
<p>
   The bookkeeper was later arrested and charged with stealing from
Colaprette's restaurant, The Jewish Mother. She was sentenced to six
years and 11 months in Virginia.
<p>
   ``This case was investigated for just 1 days before they obtained
a search warrant, which was then executed 12 hours later,'' said
Colaprette, who is expected to testify later this month before the
Senate Finance Committee's hearings on IRS abuses.
<p>
   Although the committee is saying little about its planned hearings,
it is expected they will focus on the IRS's criminal investigation
division, which handles most of the paid informants and conducts a
wide range of undercover operations.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   While it isn't surprising that the targets of allegations feel
abused, informants also are often frustrated over how the agency
treats their claims.
<p>
   Mary Case, of Los Angeles, tipped the IRS in 1985 to Stanley D.
Hexom, a San Jose, Calif., real estate broker later accused of
swindling millions of dollars from elderly California investors in
fraudulent real estate deals. She has never received a reward from the
IRS, but neither has the agency closed her case.
<p>
   Each time she checks, the agency tells her it is still working on
the matter.
<p>
   As Hexom's bookkeeper, Case provided IRS agents boxes of evidence,
including copies of doctored tax returns and locations of bank
accounts, as well as testifying to a federal grand jury.
<p>
   Under IRS guidelines, an informant that provides such specific
information is supposed to get 15 percent of the back taxes. But a big
caveat is that the IRS has to actually collect the back taxes. So, if
the agency comes up empty handed, so does the informant.
<p>
   There is no doubt that the IRS went after Hexom, who was convicted
on two counts of bank fraud and one count of preparing a false tax
return. IRS agents tried to collect from Hexom's wife, though she may
have escaped assessment by claiming she was an innocent spouse, said
Richard Blos, Hexom's attorney in San Jose.
<p>
   Hexom was released from prison in 1993 and is currently living in
the Phoenix area. He could not be reached for comment.

 &UR; Japanese Companies Suffer Worst Bankruptcy Year Since WWII (Tokyo) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO  &MD;  The latest fiscal year stacked up as the worst for
corporate bankruptcies in Japan since World War II, with the slump in
the world's second-largest economy claiming bigger companies with
bigger debt loads, a leading credit agency said Tuesday.
<p>
   The report could generate fresh concerns that Japan's economic
crisis is worse than projected, especially since the report's figures
exclude two of the largest failures, Yamaichi Securities Co. and
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which collapsed under an avalanche of bad
loans.
<p>
   It also could exacerbate concerns among the industrialized nations
gathering at an economic summit Wednesday in Washington that Japan
needs to do more to stimulate its limping economy beyond the $124
billion stimulus package unveiled last week by Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
<p>
   Because of a withering credit crunch and shrinking domestic
spending, the number of Japanese businesses that declared bankruptcy
in the year ending March 31 surged 17 percent, to 17,439, according to
Teikoku Data Bank, which compiled the data. That was the highest
figure in 12 years and represents about 1.6 percent of Japan's
registered businesses.
<p>
   The amount of debt the new bankruptcy-filers had amassed surged an
eye-popping 65 percent to a postwar record 15.12 trillion yen, the
agency said, or roughly $116 billion at today's exchange rates.
<p>
   ``It's dire,'' said Gary Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities
Ltd. in Tokyo. ``The banks have stopped lending and supporting small
companies, and the economy's in terrible shape.'' Nevertheless, he
noted that some of those companies should have been closed long ago
and had been propped up by banks trying to beef up loan portfolios.
<p>
   But now banks are tightening the loan spigot amid growing
competition, tighter regulatory requirements and a mountain of
nonperforming loans.
<p>
   About 380 companies blamed their bankruptcies on inability to
obtain capital, including the unidentified president of a medical
information-processing business interviewed by public television
station NHK on Tuesday. The bank demanded he repay a 55 million yen
loan before being furnished with fresh credit to produce new products,
he said. He paid back the money, but the bank still refused to honor
its end of the bargain and furnish new loans, he said.
<p>
   In the television report, International Trade and Industry Minister
Mitsuo Horiuchi promised that the government will appropriate more
loans for small businesses as part of the new stimulus package.
Details of the package are to be unveiled at the end of the month.
<p>
   As for the two companies excluded from the bankruptcy list,
Yamaichi ``went out of business voluntarily,'' explained Hiroyuki
Shimizu, a data analyst at Teikoku. Although he acknowledged that
Hokkaido Takushoku is bankrupt for all practical purposes, it isn't
technically ``liquidated'' because it is still paying back money to
its depositors, Shimizu said.
<p>
   Nevertheless, the fallout from Hokkaido Takushoku is contributing
to the mounting failures of other companies that were either owned or
dependent on the bank for business, the analyst said.
<p>
   Bankruptcies have been escalating rapidly since last fall, Shimizu
said, with no relief in sight. Among the most vulnerable companies are
construction firms, which are expected to lay off about 690,000
workers, or about 10 percent of their work force, by 2000.

 &UR; Poll: Californians Up About Economy, State, Clinton (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Californians are feeling better about the state's
economy and overall direction than they have in years, and their high
spirits are benefiting lawmakers from President Clinton to state
legislators, according to a new Los Angeles Times poll.
<p>
   Despite worries about education and crime  &MD;  which top the list of
Californians' concerns  &MD;  the overall mood is upbeat, with residents of
every age and political stripe sharing the positive outlook.
<p>
   For the first time in the 1990s  &MD;  a decade wracked by rioting,
recession and a series of epic natural disasters  &MD;  a majority of
Californians, 52 percent, believe the state is moving in the right
direction. The percentage is up from 47 percent in a Times poll at the
end of last year  &MD;  and from 12 percent in September 1992 in the throes
of the recession.
<p>
   On the economic front, two-thirds of Californians describe the
state's economy as ``robust''  &MD;  up from 55 percent six months ago.
<p>
   ``While people worry about the state of public education and the
crime rate, a powerful economy trumps those concerns,'' said Sharon
Pinkerton, associate director of the Times poll.
<p>
   The poll surveyed 1,409 adults statewide from April 4-9. The margin
of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
<p>
   Political incumbents both far and near are reaping the benefits of
the state's economic whirlwind.
<p>
   Californians give Clinton a 72 percent job approval rating, up 11
percent from a Times poll last October, despite a steady stream of
sexual misconduct allegations. The president's ratings are high among
Californians of all ages, incomes and educational levels.
<p>
   Even about half the registered Republicans, 49 percent, give the
president high job approval ratings, along with 67 percent of
registered independents and 90 percent of his fellow registered
Democrats.
<p>
   Misconduct allegations aside, ``As the Dow Jones rises, so do
Clinton's approval ratings,'' Pinkerton quipped.
<p>
   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson does not fare nearly as well as the
president. Even so, his approval rating has climbed from his nadir of
28 percent in October 1992. Currently, Californians approve of the
governor's job performance 47 percent to 43 percent, virtually
unchanged from last October.

 &UR; Postal Service's Future Looks Good, Runyon Says (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Retiring Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon painted a
rosy future for his federal agency Tuesday, predicting that the U.S.
Postal Service would survive the onslaughts of e-mail and faxes to
become ``the shipper of choice to America's homes'' by 2020.
<p>
   ``And until there is a way to beam things from Point A to Point B,
like they do in `Star Trek,' the nation will continue to need someone
to do the legwork,'' Runyon told the National Press Club in a farewell
address. ``More and more, we will be the one doing the job.''
<p>
   Runyon offered his optimistic view of what has become the
government's largest civilian employer three hours after he was
sharply criticized by one of his biggest competitors. James P. Kelly,
chairman and chief executive of United Parcel Service, accused Runyon
of running ``an anti-competitive, anti-free enterprise, government
bureaucracy that wouldn't last one day in the free and open market of
real competition.''
<p>
   Also speaking at the Press Club, Kelly accused the agency of using
its first-class mail monopoly to subsidize an international package
service that directly competes with UPS and other private shippers.
Kelly also blasted the agency's request for a 33-cent stamp  &MD;  a
one-cent increase  &MD;  as ``totally unnecessary'' and appealed to
Congress to enact legislation to curb the agency's powers.
<p>
   The UPS chief executive's harsh words reflected the increasingly
competitive stance Runyon has brought to the Postal Service in his 5
years as head of what was once an annual money-losing operation. With
the agency aiming at a record fourth year of billion dollar-plus
profits, postal officials are attacking UPS and other competitors by
name in ads. And they lambasted UPS when it was struck by its drivers
last summer.
<p>
   ``We must be doing something right,'' Runyon joked when he arrived
at the Press Club. Once at the lectern, the 73-year-old postal
executive who will retire next month rejected Kelly's criticism.
<p>
   ``That's not true,'' he said of UPS's charges that the agency uses
profits from first-class mail to subsidize less-profitable forms of
mail. The postmaster general said Kelly had mixed ``apples and
oranges'' to complain that the agency had an unfair price advantage
for its international mail products.
<p>
   Runyon also took a few subtle shots at UPS, saying the shipper had
``a monopoly on the parcel business'' and adding that the ``power of
PAC dollars'' would not determine his agency's future. UPS is a major
political donor to members of Congress, and postal officials have
complained that gives the company an unfair lobbying advantage.
<p>
   The postmaster general said that by 2020  &MD;  50 years after Congress
enacted legislation that created the Postal Service as an independent
agency  &MD;  technology would make the current monopoly on first-class
letters out of date. ``By the year 2020, there will be so many ways to
communicate, advertise and ship merchandise, the monopoly will simply
be irrelevant,'' Runyon said.
<p>
   Even so, he maintained that for now, the agency needs to maintain
its monopoly to support universal mail service. And he denounced
legislation that Kelly praised, a measure being pushed by Rep. John M.
McHugh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Postal Service subcommittee.
``It falls short,'' Runyon said. ``It doesn't reinvent government, as
much as it regulates it.''
<p>
   Shippers such as UPS and Federal Express have expressed support for
the legislation because it would have the Postal Service place its
nonmonopoly products, such as its two-day Priority Mail, under control
of a separate profit-making organization. The shippers say this would
create a level playing field, but postal officials said it would
create an administrative and accounting nightmare.

 &UR; Recording Executive James B. Conkling, 83, Dies &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   James B. Conkling, former director of the Voice of America and
recording executive who helped create the Grammy awards in music, has
died. He was 83.
<p>
   Conkling, who was former president of Columbia Records and founding
president of Warner Bros. Records, died Sunday at Sutter Oaks
Alzheimer's Hospital in Sacramento, Calif. His family said he had
suffered from the disease for several years.
<p>
   President Reagan appointed Conkling to head the Voice of America in
June 1981. But he resigned only nine months later in frustration with
``the way government activities work.'' He had been under pressure
from the right to make the federal agency a more active propaganda
machine and was also buffeted by criticism from liberal elements.
<p>
   Conkling had long before established himself in recording history.
A jazz trumpeter, he started working for then-new Capitol Records in
1944 fresh out of Navy service in World War II. His first job was to
produce a Stan Kenton album, and he went on to work with such artists
as Nat King Cole, Jackie Gleason, Mel Torme, Bozo the Clown, Bob Hope
and Mel Blanc. He was Capitol's first vice president.
<p>
   In 1951, Conkling became president of Columbia Records, where he
initiated the Columbia Record Club (now Columbia House) and helped
introduce long-playing, or LP records. He also helped organize and
served as president of the Record Industry Association of America.
<p>
   In 1957, he joined four other record executives to found the
National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, which sponsors the
Grammy awards. Conkling served as the group's founding chairman and
produced the first Grammy television programs. In 1995, the Grammy's
MusiCares Division honored him with a lifetime achievement award and
staged a fund-raising dinner for Alzheimer's research.
<p>
   Asked by Jack Warner to create Warner Bros. Records in 1958,
Conkling served as the company's first president and signed such
recording artists as Bob Newhart, the Everly Brothers, Peter, Paul and
Mary, John Raitt and Connie Stevens.
<p>
   Always considered a recording industry ``wunderkind,'' Conkling
retired at age 46 to devote his time to charity and public causes. He
headed the Nat King Cole Cancer Foundation, helped set up a recording
industry in China, was active in the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and joined the Church of Latter-day
Saints, where he served on the board of directors for its broadcast
arm, Bonneville International Corp.
<p>
   Conkling is survived by his wife of 55 years, Donna King Conkling;
one son; four daughters ; a brother; three sisters; 23 grandchildren;
and two great grandchildren.

 &UR; Failure to Arrest War Crimes Suspect Raises Concern (Buenos Aires) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  &MD;  While Argentine and Croatian authorities
pledged Tuesday to arrest and extradite to Croatia the commander of a
World War II concentration camp living in Argentina, a high-ranking
Argentine official expressed frustration that the suspected war
criminal has not been arrested more than a week after his presence
became public.
<p>
   As Croatian officials declared they would file formal extradition
papers shortly and two Argentine judges continued investigating, the
whereabouts and legal status of Dinko Sakic were uncertain.
<p>
   The 76-year-old Sakic admits to having commanded a concentration
camp in Jasenovac, the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' where tens of
thousands of prisoners were killed in death and labor camps between
1941 and 1945. But he claimed in a television interview aired last
week that no one was killed in the camp during his two years as
commander.
<p>
   ``I am very concerned  &MD;  it would be a disaster if he escapes,''
Victor Ramos, head of the Interior Ministry's Institute Against
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism, said in an interview. ``I
believe the justice system is moving too slowly. I asked the courts to
have him arrested immediately. We are not talking about a highway
robber, we are talking about the chief of a concentration camp. A real
butcher.''
<p>
   Acting under orders of President Carlos Menem, Ramos said he filed
charges requesting Sakic's arrest April 6, the day after Argentine
television broadcast an interview in which Sakic proclaimed his
innocence.
<p>
   Ramos said it was the first time Sakic's presence came to the
attention of his institute, formed six months ago to fight hate crimes
and hunt war criminals.
<p>
   Sakic's capture apparently has been slowed by the Easter holiday
and legal bureaucracy; the case has been assigned to federal and
provincial courts. Lacking an arrest warrant, Argentina's intelligence
service is conducting surveillance on Sakic to prevent him from
fleeing, Ramos said.
<p>
   Sakic, the retired former owner of a textile factory, has left his
home in the beach resort of Santa Teresita and apparently traveled to
Buenos Aires but technically he is not a fugitive, Ramos said. Still,
``even if I had doubts about this man's identity, it is better to act
quickly in a case like this,'' Ramos said.
<p>
   Croatia shares blame, another Argentine official said, because it
has yet to file a formal extradition request. That request is
imminent, said a spokeswoman at the Croatian Embassy.
<p>
   Jewish groups and the U.S. State Department, which this week urged
speedy action, say Sakic is responsible for the deaths of thousands of
prisoners, mostly Serbs and Jews but Gypsies, too. The toll in
Jasenovac is estimated as high as 600,000, said Tommy Baer,
international director of B'nai B'rith.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   There are doubts about Croatia's capacity to judge war criminals
because of the country's pro-Nazi past and its modern-day human rights
abuses of minorities, particularly Serbs.
<p>
   Some officials in the right-wing government of President Franjo
Tudjman remain sympathetic to Croatia's fascist Ustasha regime, the
World War II Nazi puppet state. As Croatia seceded from Communist
Yugoslavia in 1991, it revived many Ustasha symbols, including
elements of its flag and the name of its currency. Tudjman has made
public statements that appeared to minimize the guilt of Ustasha
commanders. He invited world scorn when he suggested burying Ustasha
soldiers alongside their Serb and Jewish victims in a new memorial at
Jasenovac.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Argentina has a history of providing shelter to Nazi
fugitives after the war and has endured anti-Jewish violence by
security forces in its recent past. Rather than keeping a low profile
after he came to Argentina 50 years ago, the reportedly outspoken
Sakic has been active in the sizable Argentine-Croatian community. He
traveled to Europe to espouse Croatian nationalist causes and boasted
about having clout with Argentine politicians, Argentine officials and
Jewish activists say.
<p>
   Croatia's Justice and Foreign ministers say Sakic will be brought
to Croatia for trial and promise to satisfy international demands for
fair, complete proceedings.

 &UR; Two Arrested for Allegedly Selling Cannons to Feds (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  An Idaho peddler of used airplanes and a Southern
California intermediary have been arrested in a sting operation for
allegedly trying to sell to undercover federal agents five 30-mm
cannons capable of firing 1,200 explosive projectiles a minute.
<p>
   Steven L. Picatti, 53, of Boise, Idaho, and Kasi Gabbita, 55, of
Hacienda Heights, Calif., were taken into custody by U.S. Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and U.S. Customs agents on Monday and Tuesday,
federal officials said Tuesday.
<p>
   The arrest of a third man is anticipated, agents said.
<p>
   Agents said at a news conference that Picatti, the principal in the
alleged deal, apparently believed he was dealing with suppliers of a
drug cartel when he transferred the deadly weapons to Los Angeles.
<p>
   Instead he was arrested near the Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles'
San Fernando Valley Monday as he awaited a $24,000 payment for four of
the cannon he had allegedly driven to Los Angeles from Boise in a
pickup truck.
<p>
   Gabbita was picked up at his home Tuesday morning. Both arrests
were peaceful, agents said.
<p>
   Picatti is accused of selling and delivering a fifth cannon to
federal undercover agents in February for $12,000.
<p>
   The British and French-manufactured Aden cannon, developed in the
late 1940s, was once used as armament in Hawker Hunter fighter
aircraft and also once employed in U.S. Marine Harrier fighters. It is
classed as an ``implement of war'' and is prohibited to civilians
under a 1968 U.S. law.
<p>
   ``I think we're fortunate to intercept these weapons before they
hit the streets of Los Angeles,'' said Barry M. Caires, agent in
charge of the ATF's Van Nuys Field Office.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Caires and other ATF and Customs officials described the Aden
cannon as primarily useful in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, but
they said it also could be fired from ground to ground if properly
anchored against a powerful recoil.
<p>
   Each armor-piercing projectile, 1 inch in diameter, carries an
explosive and incendiary charge that would set afire anything it hit,
they said.
<p>
   ``The Aden cannon has no legitimate civilian use,'' said ATF agent
Richard A. Curd. ``One of them in the wrong hands has the potential to
cause catastrophic destruction.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Agents said Picatti, a U.S. citizen who they said has no criminal
record, has sold airplanes throughout the world. He works at the Boise
Airport for a business called Jet Aviation Services and also operates
Picatti Aero Service.
<p>
   ``Let's say you wanted to buy a MiG fighter,'' an ATF agent said.
``Picatti would locate it for you, fly it to Boise, recondition it and
deliver it to you.''
<p>
   But under U.S. law, such a fighter sold to a civilian could carry
no arms.
<p>
   The agents said they did not know if Gabbita, who is from India, is
a U.S. citizen, and they did not immediately describe his precise
occupation.

 &UR; Justice Department to Fight Starr on Forcing Secret &QL; 
 &UR; Service to Talk (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Justice Department has decided to fight efforts by
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr to compel testimony from Secret
Service officers who protect President Clinton, setting the stage for
another long court battle in the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation.
<p>
   Breaking off weeks of negotiations over whether he could gain
access to Secret Service personnel, Starr filed a sealed motion Friday
seeking a court order to require their grand jury testimony. Now, top
Justice Department officials  &MD;  at the behest of the Treasury
Department, which oversees the Secret Service  &MD;  are drawing up papers
countering Starr's motion on the grounds that a unique legal privilege
should shield the relationship between Secret Service officers and
those they protect, administration officials said.
<p>
   Since early in his investigation of whether Clinton had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and tried to cover it up, Starr has wanted
to determine whether Secret Service officers saw Clinton with the
former White House intern or heard about their encounters from others
at the White House.
<p>
   But as a result of the Justice Department's decision to fight the
independent counsel, Starr is unlikely to know whether any Secret
Service officers have direct knowledge of the Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship by the time he makes his report to the House of
Representatives on the Lewinsky matter. Starr's goal is to complete
that report by the end of next month.
<p>
   In addition, Starr, who already is fighting the president over
claims of executive privilege for White House aides, will have to
devote resources to a second major procedural battle. Meanwhile, the
Justice Department finds itself in a position it has sought to avoid
since Attorney General Janet Reno approved Starr's Lewinsky
investigation in January: appearing to shield Clinton from the
independent counsel's probe.
<p>
   Clinton could face another drawn-out legal battle in the Paula
Jones civil lawsuit. Jones has scheduled a news conference for
Thursday in Dallas, where advisers expect her to announce that she
will appeal the dismissal of her sexual harassment lawsuit to the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A decision to pursue her claim after
the suit was thrown out by a federal judge would ensure that Clinton
will continue to be confronted by the matter, possibly through the end
of his presidency.
<p>
   Her lawyers have told Jones that an appeal could take a year or
two, particularly if the case ends up at the Supreme Court, which has
already heard the matter once. Even if they win a reversal, a trial
may not occur until after Clinton leaves office in January 2001.
<p>
   In Starr's investigation, the independent counsel and the Justice
Department, which acts as a lawyer for the Treasury, have been engaged
in talks over potential testimony by Secret Service officers since
late January. But while both sides characterized the negotiations as
friendly throughout, the discussions came to an abrupt end last week.
<p>
   Persuaded by the Treasury Department's position, Justice Department
officials have argued that the special relationship between presidents
and the Secret Service would be forever harmed if members of the
protective detail were obliged to testify about what they observed
while on duty.
<p>
   The national interest in preserving a relationship of total trust
is so great, the Justice Department claimed, that a special privilege
should shield the Secret Service from the intrusion of a criminal
investigation.
<p>
   The Justice Department claimed that the privilege would cover any
information gained while on protective duty and that it would apply to
both the Secret Service's plainclothes agents and uniformed officers.
No such privilege has ever been asserted before, and officials at the
Justice Department said that the concept faces uncertain prospects if
it is tested in court.
<p>
   Starr has argued that as sworn law enforcement officers, Secret
Service personnel have an obligation to assist a criminal
investigation  &MD;  even if the president is a potential target of the
probe.
<p>
   Already, several Secret Service agents and officers have made
claims of privilege in refusing to answer some questions raised during
depositions or interviews with Starr's prosecutors, Justice Department
officials said.
<p>
   The most sensitive questions involve inquiries about what officers
observed while on protective duty and queries related the means and
methods used by Secret Service protective units.
<p>
   In recent weeks, Justice officials and Starr's office were seeking
to find a compromise in which questions could be tailored narrowly
enough to avoid violating the privilege that Treasury wanted to
assert.
<p>
   Starr effectively ended the negotiations Friday by filing a sealed
motion with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson asking to force
the Secret Service personnel to answer the questions they had claimed
were covered by privilege. The Wall Street Journal first reported the
Starr motion Tuesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Starr is considering whether to ask the Justice
Department's former top internal watchdog to investigate whether one
of his chief Whitewater witnesses, David Hale, received money from
conservative activists working to uncover scandalous material on
Clinton, officials said.
<p>
   Starr has had talks with Michael E. Shaheen Jr., former counsel at
Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility, about conducting the
Hale investigation. The Justice Department referred the matter to
Starr last week but advised him that he had a possible conflict of
interest because of his own ties to conservative philanthropist
Richard Mellon Scaife, the source of the alleged payments to Hale.

 &UR; Many Puzzled by Gore's Charitable Contributions (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  A single line in Vice President Al Gore's highly
detailed, 34-page federal tax return, which was released publicly
Monday, is transforming a yawner of a story into something awkward for
a political leader who wants to be the next president.
<p>
   It is the $353 Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported as gifts to
charity last year on a return that shows adjusted gross income of
$197,729. The donations reported by Gore, who has often lauded the
value of social responsibility, add up to less than one-tenth the
typical contribution amount for his income level, according to
Internal Revenue Service records.
<p>
   The $353 is also causing some bewilderment in philanthropic
circles, where Gore has a ``good guy'' image as an advocate for public
services and social causes.
<p>
   ``I would assume that he would want to do something to demonstrate
that he was being socially responsible through his giving,'' said
Stacy Palmer, managing editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. ``It's
not adding up for me in a way that makes a whole lot of sense.''
<p>
   The taxing flap sparked an unusual statement Tuesday from the vice
president's office. Aides urged that the Gores be judged by their
record over many years, not just the dollar figures on their 1997 tax
return. In addition, the aides said, the tax return did not encompass
all the Gores' donations, because the couple did not claim deductions
for donations to their church or for Tipper Gore's contributions of
food and clothing to the homeless.
<p>
   ``Contributing financially to charitable organizations is certainly
noble and should be encouraged and is something that the Gores have
done when the resources were there,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman
for the vice president. ``However, to truly judge a person's
commitment to helping others, you need to consider what they have done
with their lives and how they have spent their time  &MD;  and by that
standard the Gores are extraordinarily committed.''
<p>
   Their financial commitment, however, appeared to slip last year. In
1996, for example, the Gores gave $35,530 to charity, most of it with
proceeds from Tipper Gore's book, ``Picture This,'' which went to a
program for the homeless.
<p>
   In 1992, aided by royalties from the vice president's own book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' they gave $50,000 to the University of
Tennessee to endow a chair in memory of Gore's late sister. In the
interim years, the Gores did not itemize their deductions.
<p>
   The Gores are indeed active in volunteer activities. Tipper Gore
continues to participate in efforts to fight hunger and help the
homeless. The two have worked together in projects for Habitat for
Humanity, which builds housing for the working poor, and in efforts to
raise money to combat breast cancer.
<p>
   ``When you look at the core of charity, it is not just about giving
money. It is not a contest to see who contributes more,'' Lehane said.
``It is about what you have done to improve people's lives.''
<p>
   But in the political shark tank that Gore has chosen for his
professional career, the reported $353 can hardly prove a convenient
disclosure. According to a survey by the pro-philanthropy Independent
Sector, the average American household gave $696 to charity in 1996.
<p>
   ``When you're in public life and you come from a well-to-do family
and your charitable giving seems to be minuscule ... I would think it
would be the butt of jokes on late-night TV,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,
an independent political analyst in Washington.
<p>
   ``This is the vice president of an administration that has
constantly reminded the public of the personal responsibilities we
have. It raises questions,'' he added.
<p>
   In fact, a household's annual contributions can vary markedly from
year to year, charity experts said. And even with a vice presidential
salary of $171,500, it is possible that the Gores, who pay Harvard
University tuition for two of their children and private high school
tuition for another, sometimes feel pinched.
<p>
   ``If you were just looking at that year (1996), you'd say this is
an amazingly generous household,'' said Ann Kaplan, research director
of the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy in New York, referring to the
Gores' contributions of $35,530 that year. ``If you were looking at
the next year you'd say the opposite. ... It sounds like a very
complex and unusual tax situation.''

 &UR; Prescription Drugs May Be Killing 100,000 People a Year, Study
Says &QL;  &UR; By Terence Monmaney &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Properly prescribed medications may kill more than 100,000 people a
year, taking more lives than diabetes or pneumonia, according to a new
analysis that suggests prescription medications cause more harm than
previously believed.
<p>
   The new study, which will appear Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, estimates that 76,000 to 137,000 people
died in 1994 from such treatments. That would make so-called adverse
drug reactions between the sixth and fourth leading cause of death in
the United States.
<p>
   Moreover, of the 33 million hospitalized patients in 1994, some 2.2
million had a nonfatal reaction serious enough to require medical
attention, the researchers say.
<p>
   Although some experts questioned the study methods, the new
estimates put the problem in the most dramatic light yet, suggesting
that despite saving perhaps millions of lives, medications bring on
more misery than previously acknowledged.
<p>
   The study ``puts into clear perspective that adverse drug reactions
are a major form of death and injury that can be prevented,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group and
author of the book ``Worst Pills, Best Pills.'' He said the injuries
and deaths detailed in the study are nearly twice as high as estimates
recently done by his consumer group.
<p>
   The findings should not encourage people to abandon vital
medications, said the study's leader, Dr. Bruce Pomeranz of the
University of Toronto, who added he was surprised by the death toll.
``What's needed is more awareness of the potential problems with
taking some drugs. Before you take a medication you should know about
its risk-benefit ratio,'' he said.
<p>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a
<p>
   drug industry group, cautioned patients not to panic.
``Prescription medicines are safe and effective when used properly,''
Alan Holmer, the group's president, said in a statement.
<p>
   The analysis did not specify which drugs were most risky or which
diseases patients had when the adverse reactions occurred. But other
studies have found that the drug types causing the most serious
medical problems in hospitalized patients are painkillers: from
narcotics that halt breathing to aspirin pills that induce stomach
bleeding; antibiotics and anti-viral drugs, which can cause severe
diarrhea; and cardiovascular and anticoagulant drugs, which can cause
a range of problems including internal bleeding.
<p>
   In addition, some people are allergic or sensitive to particular
drugs, while other bad reactions happen when two or more drugs are
combined. For instance, the widely prescribed allergy drug
terfenidine, or Seldane, was withdrawn from the market after reports
that it triggered heart-rhythm problems in people also taking the
commonly administered antibiotic erythromycin.
<p>
   Adverse drug reactions especially trouble the elderly, experts say,
because they are more likely to have multiple underlying health
problems and also tend to have a weakened liver and kidneys, which
break down and eliminate medications.
<p>
   Medical researchers believe that adverse drug reactions have been
underestimated for years. That is chiefly because hospitals and
physicians seldom report such reactions, dismiss them as unavoidable
or mistake them for disease symptoms.
<p>
   The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration last fall proposed
new federal reguations requiring hospitals to step up drug-reaction
monitoring. But some physicians have criticized the proposed
monitoring system, which would involve periodic reviews of patient
charts, as intrusive and costly.
<p>
   In their study, the Toronto researchers pooled and analyzed data
from 39 U.S. studies on adverse drug reactions published between 1964
and 1996. They looked at two groups: patients who underwent an adverse
drug reaction while in the hospital that was at least as serious
enough to prolong their stay, and also outpatients who had a drug
reaction bad enough to hospitalize them.
<p>
   While other studies have looked at those two groups separately,
this was the first to combine them, leading to the ``extremely high''
prevalence of drug reactions, as the researchers called it.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Between the upper and lower fatality estimates is the midpoint of
106,000 drug-induced deaths. That means that in 1994  &MD;  which the
researchers chose as a representative year  &MD;  0.32 percent of patients
on a prescription drug in or three out of every 1,000, had a fatal
reaction to it.
<p>
   Their approach was ``conservative,'' the researchers said, in that
they focused only on correctly prescribed drugs. Their analysis did
not even consider other sources of prescription drug problems, such as
patient compliance errors, intentional overdoses, narcotic abuse and
accidental poisonings.
<p>
   ``The truth is we missed a lot of people,'' Pomeranz says,
including those who ``died at home.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Other researchers questioned aspects of the study because it is a
``meta-analysis,'' which involves statistically analyzing data pooled
from other studies, rather than studying real people. It is often
difficult to establish that a very sick person died from a drug
reaction rather than an underlying illness, said Dr. John Burke, a
medical epidemiologist at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, who has
studied adverse drug reactions.
<p>
   He urged caution in accepting the study as fact, but also praised
it as a ``spur to action'' in attacking the problem of adverse drug
reactions.

 &UR; Singleton Is Sentenced to Die in Florida Electric Chair (Miami) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI  &MD;  Twenty years after he raped a California teen-ager, chopped
off her forearms and left her naked in a ditch, Lawrence Singleton
Tuesday was sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair for the fatal
stabbing of a Tampa prostitute in his own living room.
<p>
   Singleton, 70, showed no emotion as he listened to Judge Bob
Anderson Mitcham seal his fate in words laden with undisguised
disgust.
<p>
   ``This was an unprovoked, senseless killing of a human being,'' the
judge said of the bloody February 1997 slaying of Roxanne Hayes, 31.
``We are living in times worse than Sodom and Gomorrah.''
<p>
   In Los Angeles, some 3,000 miles away from the Tampa courtroom
where Singleton was sentenced, Mary Bell Vincent, now 35, appeared at
a news conference to say that she was ``relieved that justice has been
served.
<p>
   ``I didn't want to play God and don't want anyone's death on my
hands,'' said Vincent, who is fitted with two prosthetic hooks. ``But
I think there's a little bit of relief. I think I can start all over
and put everything behind me and hopefully be safe and happy.''
<p>
   Six weeks ago Vincent flew to Tampa from her home in the Pacific
Northwest to testify in the penalty phase of Singleton's murder trial.
From the witness stand she pointed a gleaming metal hook at Singleton
and then offered a brief, haunting account of what happened in 1978,
when she was 15, after she got into his van while hitchhiking in
Berkeley.
<p>
   ``I was attacked,'' she said. ``I was raped and my hands were cut
off.''
<p>
   How? she was asked.
<p>
   ``He used a hatchet.''
<p>
   Singleton, a onetime merchant seaman, was convicted of seven
felonies in connection with his assault on Vincent, including
attempted murder, rape and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 11 years in
prison, the maximum then possible under California law, and served a
little more than eight years before he was freed.
<p>
   Singleton's release from prison was met with such an outcry that he
was forced to move from community to community before finally serving
out his parole in a rented trailer on the grounds of San Quentin
Prison. Public outrage over his release prompted California
legislators to pass tougher sentencing laws.
<p>
   Singleton had lived quietly in his native Tampa for several years
before police were called to his house on Feb. 19, 1997. A house
painter testified at the trial that he peered in the front window of
Singleton's home and saw a naked man repeatedly plunging a boning
knife into a woman as she lay sprawled on the couch.
<p>
   Singleton testified that he had picked up Hayes, the mother of
three children, on a Tampa street after agreeing to pay her $20 for
sex. When she tried to take more from his wallet, he said, he
accidentally stabbed her  &MD;  seven times  &MD;  as he tried to stop her.
<p>
   A jury took four hours to find him guilty last February and just
one hour to recommend that he be sentenced to death.
<p>
   Judge Mitcham was not bound by the jury's recommendation. And
Hayes' longtime boyfriend, Clifford Tyson, the father of two of her
children, said that he did not favor Singleton's execution.
<p>
   ``She was a human being,'' Tyson said Tuesday. ``But as long as he
was in prison for life, that would have been enough for me.''
<p>
   But Mitcham said that, although Singleton was depressed and
alcoholic, his deed warranted a seat in ``Old Sparky,'' Florida's
three-legged wooden electric chair. Four persons have been
electrocuted in it this year.

 &UR; Clinton Headlines Discussion of Race Amid Criticism (Houston) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  President Clinton tried Tuesday to invigorate his
national race initiative by headlining a televised discussion of race
and athletics, but critics said the event epitomized one of the
fundamental problems afflicting the yearlong effort.
<p>
   The discussion panel initially assembled by cable network ESPN to
discuss the impact of racial stereotyping and discrimination on
professional sports consisted of six blacks and four whites, including
Clinton.
<p>
   It was expanded at the last minute to include a Latino, St. John's
University basketball player Felipe Lopez, but the damage was done.
Latino advocacy groups continued to complain that the panel  &MD;  and
Clinton's race initiative in general  &MD;  focuses too much on black-white
conflicts and not enough on the complicated multiracial issues that
reflect America today.
<p>
   ``Race is a hard issue,'' acknowledged Judith Winston, executive
director of the president's advisory commission on race, before the
90-minute televised discussion began Tuesday evening. ``We knew that
starting out. There's always something.''
<p>
   Other participants in the 90-minute session were former Cleveland
Browns running back Jim Brown, New York Jets wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson, Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Minnesota Vikings
Coach Dennis Green, Georgetown University basketball Coach John
Thompson, and ESPN analyst and baseball Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, all
of whom are black.
<p>
   The panel's four white participants were Clinton, San Diego Padres
Owner John Moores, and San Francisco 49ers President Carmen Policy and
University of Georgia Athletic Director Vince Dooley.
<p>
   Sunday, after a Latino advocacy group wrote to Clinton objecting to
the composition of the panel, ESPN announced that it was adding Lopez,
a Dominican. The network said it had tried unsuccessfully to include
more Latinos and noted that the audience would reflect their views.
<p>
   Nonetheless, some Latino groups remained upset, and said the entire
incident underscored a a broader problem with the race initiative that
Clinton launched with high hopes and great fanfare last year.
<p>
   ``They always talk about how important it is to be inclusive and to
get away from the black-white paradigm,'' said Raul Yzaguirre,
president of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group. ``But it's difficult to
see a lot of concrete evidence that they've gotten away from that
paradigm. In this event, as with the others, you see the obsession
with the past. The black-white issue is a framework of the past, and
it is totally ignorant of the new framework of the country.''
<p>
   In Texas and California, Latinos already have become the largest
single ethnic minority, Yzaguirre noted, and New York is expected to
soon join the list.
<p>
   Latino groups have not been alone in expressing their
disappointment with the president's initiative.
<p>
   Although the ESPN event is only the second ``town meeting'' on race
personally attended by Clinton, his advisory commission has convened a
number of similar sessions across the United States to talk about
racial issues.
<p>
   At a commission event in Denver last month, American Indian
activists held a raucous protest that prevented the session from
proceeding as planned. They complained that the president's advisory
board includes no American Indians and is not adequatedly addressing
issues important to the hundreds of tribes in this country.
<p>
   ``The insult added to the injury that has occurred over numerous
years is to be excluded from an initiative that is set up to bridge
the race gap,'' said Joann Chase, executive director of the National
Congress of American Indians, and a citizen of the Mandan, Hidatsa and
Arikara tribes of North Dakota. ``As the people who were here first,
we gave up so much so that America could flourish. We should at least
have a seat at the table when we're discussing issues of race in
America.''
<p>
   Clinton advisers say they have faced many obstacles in trying to
expand the dialogue to include ethnic groups other than blacks and
whites.
<p>
   ``It just seems that folks ... are looking for their own faces, and
if they don't see them or they see them added in a way that appears to
be an afterthought, people get frustrated,'' said Maria Echaveste, who
heads the White House public liaison office.
<p>
   ``We consistently go beyond black and white, but it doesn't seem to
get any traction,'' Echaveste said.

 &UR; Katharine Graham, Philip Roth Win Literary Pulitzers (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  She spent nearly a decade writing her first book. It
appeared when she was 79. It became a No. 1 bestseller. Tuesday,
Katharine Graham's ``Personal History'' won a Pulitzer Prize.
<p>
   ``This was not even on my wish list,'' said Graham, who chronicles
in the book her transformation from an awkward child and insecure
widow to pioneering head of The Washington Post Co. Speaking very
softly before the assembled newsroom, she said winning the Pulitzer
was ``sort of like a fairy tale.''
<p>
   Among the Pulitzers for journalism, the New York Times got three
awards, the Los Angeles Times received two, and the Grand Forks, N.D.,
Herald, which published through a devastating flood and fire, won for
public service.
<p>
   In the other arts and literary awards, novelist Philip Roth, who
has chronicled the American scene and his own internal landscape for
four decades, got his first Pulitzer for ``American Pastoral.'' Paula
Vogel took the drama prize for ``How I Learned to Drive,'' and Charles
Wright won the poetry prize for ``Black Zodiac.''
<p>
   ``I'm going to go take a walk to celebrate,'' said Wright, who
teaches at the University of Virginia. He put the Pulitzer in
perspective: ``Poetry is the great ocean of language we put our boats
on. A prize every now and then is a desert island. How nice to find
one. But you're not sailing for desert islands. You're trying to get
across the water.''
<p>
   Vogel, 46, grew up in Washington's Maryland suburbs, the setting of
her winning play, and graduated from Catholic University. The story of
a woman looking back at her childhood and coming to terms with the
uncle who molested her, ``How I Learned to Drive'' was written and
developed at Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska. Perseverance is
run by Molly D. Smith, who will succeed Douglas C. Wager next season
as artistic director of Washington's Arena Stage.
<p>
   ``Molly Smith had a huge impact on the writing of this play,''
Vogel said Tuesday. ``I really want to thank her. She thought the play
was extraordinary and I didn't.''
<p>
   ``How I Learned to Drive,'' directed by Smith, will be the final
offering next season at Arena's Kreeger Theater, and the playwright
seems likely to have a still greater Washington profile.
<p>
   ``I'd very much like to write larger pieces for Arena, for the
Washington area,'' said Vogel, who's on a leave of absence from Brown
University, where she runs the playwriting program. ``Work that really
comes from the history of Washington, D.C., and Maryland. ... If
there's any way to contribute to the new play-writing scene there, I'd
like to do it.''
<p>
   The award for history was won by University of Georgia Law School
Prof. Edward J. Larson, 44, for ``Summer for the Gods: The Scopes
Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion.'' The
Scopes ``monkey'' trial is largely known because of the play and movie
``Inherit the Wind,'' which presents an idealized view of the
Tennessee biology teacher who was arrested and tried in 1925 for
teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. Larson puts the trial in the
cultural context of the time  &MD;  detailing, for instance, how towns in
Tennessee sought to get one of their teachers arrested to put their
community on the map.
<p>
   Aaron Jay Kernis, 38, won the Pulitzer Prize for Composition for
his 39-minute String Quartet No. 2, ``Musica Instrumentalis,'' which
received its world premiere at Merkin Concert Hall in New York this
January. It was played by the Lark Quartet.
<p>
   ``I haven't had a martini in years, but that's sort of what this
feels like,'' said Kernis, reached at New York's Kennedy Airport as he
was about to take a flight to Spain. ``I'm just floating on air. There
is a special intensity to a string quartet that is very different from
an orchestral piece, and I'm truly honored that the Pulitzer judges
chose to reward it.''
<p>
   Kernis' compositions tend to be very brash and colorful; he works
on a big palette. His winning piece, despite being a string quartet,
is long enough to retain his customary epic quality  &MD;  although not
much of the color or splashy orchestration.
<p>
   Winning a special Pulitzer citation was composer George Gershwin,
honored for his contribution to American music on the centennial of
his birth. Gershwin died in 1937.
<p>
   In general nonfiction, the Pulitzer went to ``Guns, Germs, and
Steel: The Fates of Human Societies'' by Jared Diamond, a professor of
physiology at UCLA.
<p>
   Diamond's book, which has been a word-of-mouth bestseller, attempts
to explain how the past 13,000 years of human history has proceeded
differently for people in different parts of the globe. ``Why weren't
Native Americans, Africans and Aboriginal Australians the ones who
decimated, subjugated or exterminated Europeans or Asians?'' he asks.
The book argues against racially based theories of human history,
making the case that such environmental factors as climate and
geography instead played the pivotal role.
<p>
   Pulitzers have been awarded in the category of
biography/autobiography since 1917. Almost always, the winner is a
biography. Among the very few of those who have won for telling their
own story were Henry Adams in 1917 for ``The Education of Henry
Adams,'' William Allen White in 1947 for ``The Autobiography of
William Allen White,'' Russell Baker in 1983 for ``Growing Up,'' Lewis
B. Puller Jr. in 1992 for ``Fortunate Son: The Healing of a Vietnam
Vet'' and, last year, Frank McCourt for ``Angela's Ashes.''
<p>
   ``I feel this is not only my story but our story,'' Graham told the
newsroom Tuesday. But what really seemed to captivate reviewers and
readers was not the inside story of the newspaper that she raised from
second-rate status, but the candor with which she discussed how her
own life had changed.
<p>
   When she took over the paper in 1963 after the suicide of her
husband, Philip, she was untrained and very insecure. The first
editorial lunch at which she asked a question was for Madame Nhu, the
fearsome sister-in-law of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem.
``I have a very vivid recollection of nearly dying afterwards from
embarrassment and fear that I had looked stupid or ignorant,'' Graham
wrote in ``Personal History.''
<p>
   It was on-the-job training, and she rose to the occasion. ``She
turns out to have had not two lives but four, and the story of her
journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a
surprising degree the history of women in this century,'' wrote Nora
Ephron in the New York Times Book Review.
<p>
   Philip Roth has been a well-regarded writer since his first book,
``Goodbye, Columbus,'' in 1959, and a famous one since ``Portnoy's
Complaint'' a decade later. He's very prolific  &MD;  ``American Pastoral''
was his 22nd book, and he is publishing the 23rd this fall  &MD;  and the
recipient of many honors. Recent books have picked up nearly every
major award except the Pulitzer.
<p>
   ``American Pastoral'' is about Seymour ``Swede'' Levov, a good man
whose daughter grows up to become a terrorist. ``What the hell is
wrong with doing things right?'' asks the anguished Levov, who sees in
his family's tragedy the descent of American civilization.
<p>
   In recent years, Roth has become increasingly inclined to let his
work speak for itself, doing almost no interviews or author
appearances. His publisher said Tuesday that reporters who wanted to
get a comment from him about the Pulitzer should fax questions to his
agent.
<p>
   When Charles Wright told his wife, Holly, that he had won the
poetry Pulitzer, ``she was excited,'' he said. ``But she was more
excited when I told her Philip Roth had won for fiction. `Now I'll
finally get to meet him,' she said. She just loved that book.''
<p>
   Wright, 62, isn't quite as laureled as Roth, but is getting close.
``Black Zodiac'' also won awards from the National Book Critics Circle
and the Los Angeles Times. He described his work as ``a linguistic
investigation of the idea of landscape, the idea of language and the
idea of God. Probably in that order.''
<p>
   The Pulitzers, which are presented by Columbia University, include
an award of $5,000.

 &UR; Midwestern Lawmakers Fight Napalm Shipments (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Two containers filled with 12,000 gallons of
Vietnam-era napalm wound their way across the country by rail Tuesday,
destination unknown. The Chicago-area waste facility that was to
recycle the notorious weapon and defoliant quit the project because of
what it described as political pressure and unfounded hysteria.
<p>
   The wandering napalm that nobody wanted led to a rapid-fire
exchange of charges and counter-charges on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.
There were accusations of know-nothing congressional demagoguery,
White House meddling and public relations bungling by the Navy. And at
the end of the day, there was no indication where the dreaded stuff
will end up.
<p>
   ``Good question,'' Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told
reporters when asked what the military will do now that its recycling
project has been derailed.
<p>
   All the heat was misdirected, according to Navy officials. They
maintained the canisters of napalm  &MD;  composed of gasoline, benzene and
polystyrene  &MD;  are not armed to detonate, not explosive and no more
dangerous or flammable than the fuels, chemicals and plastics that
routinely travel the nation's rails and roads.
<p>
   Millions of gallons of napalm were used during the Vietnam War; it
was an indiscriminate but deadly weapon and defoliant, capable of
carpeting the jungle with a flowing river of raging, clinging flame.
Its use, however, was condemned by the United Nations and the U.S.
military discontinued the practice a quarter century ago.
<p>
   Since the early 1970s, the Navy has stored about 23 million pounds
of napalm in 34,000 canisters at a weapons site north of San Diego.
The canisters sit exposed to the elements, but they are not armed with
detonators.
<p>
   ``Napalm is gasoline and benzene. You drive around with gas and
benzene in your car every day,'' said Lee Saunders of the Navy's
Weapons Support Facility in Fallbrook, Calif., where the napalm is
stored. ``These kinds of materials are shipped routinely all over the
country.''
<p>
   Saunders said the Navy was planning to literally turn swords into
plowshares. The wood crates holding the napalm canisters were to be
shredded, shipped and burned as fuel at a power plant in Tulsa, Okla.
The canisters were to be melted and turned into things such as
airplane landing gear. Finally, the napalm was to be mixed with other
fuels and used to fire kilns to make cement.
<p>
   The first shipments of napalm, which left Saturday and made it as
far as New Mexico, were to arrive this week at Pollution Control
Industries (PCI) in East Chicago, Ind., a waste recycling facility
that won the multiyear, $24 million contract.
<p>
   But as the first trainload of napalm was headed its way, PCI
decided to back out of the contract. In a news conference Tuesday, PCI
President Robert Campbell said his company became ``caught in a
tug-of-war'' among various branches and departments of the federal
government, that opponents ``toyed with the facts'' and that ``the
possibility for political gain by some overruled what is an excellent
environmental solution to deal with this material.''
<p>
   A number of members of the Illinois and Indiana congressional
delegations have denounced the napalm recycling project in their area,
raising questions about PCI's track record and complaining of the
Navy's failure to calm fears  &MD;  even while some of the politicians
suggested that napalm recycling was a potentially dangerous
undertaking.
<p>
   Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich, D-Ill., who gave an emotional news
conference attacking the project in January, said in an interview
Tuesday that napalm was a weapon of war, designed to stick to things
and was much more potentially hazardous than gasoline. He suggested
shipping the material to a weapons disposal site in Utah or to the
Johnson atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
<p>
   Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, D-Ind., said that he initially, albeit
cautiously, supported the project, but has been dismayed in recent
weeks by what he alleged was the Navy's failure to assure the public
that the napalm recycling program would be safe.
<p>
   ``Any problems the Navy is having are largely their own fault,''
Visclosky said.
<p>
   He added that it was naive to think that people  &MD;  or their leaders
 &MD;  would not be disturbed by shipments of napalm through their
neighborhoods. The gelatinous substance has been a particularly
evocative symbol of the horrors of war for many Americans because of a
widely published photograph showing a 9-year-old Vietnamese girl
suffering from napalm burns and running naked down a road with anguish
on her face.
<p>
   All this seems like a lot of political meddling, said Rep. Ron
Packard, R-Calif., in whose district the napalm is now baking in the
California sun.
<p>
   ``We've said this has been political all along and this is as much
proof as one would need to believe it,'' Packard said. ``The only
reasonable conclusion that I can make is that the Clinton
administration, at the urging of members of the Illinois and Indiana
congressional delegation, threatened PCI and forced them off the
contract.''
<p>
   Administration officials, however, denied any interference, and
instead said that the White House Council on Environmental Quality
tried to mediate a dispute between the Navy and the Environmental
Protection Agency. In addition, a number of Republicans opposed to the
napalm recycling.

 &UR; Raines to Leave Budget Director Post for Fannie Mae (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Franklin D. Raines, whose low-key pragmatism helped
President Clinton bridge partisan differences to close the 1997
balanced-budget deal with congressional Republicans, announced Tuesday
he will step down after less than two years as White House budget
director to become chairman and chief executive of home mortgage
lender Fannie Mae.
<p>
   Raines has long been a quiet but effective player on both the local
and national political scenes, gliding smoothly between high-paying
private sector jobs and public service. At various points in his
career he has advised mayors, corporate chieftains and the president,
using a combination of financial savvy and personal charm.
<p>
   At Fannie Mae, Raines will replace James A. Johnson, the
high-profile and well-connected chairman, who wooed Raines for the
job.
<p>
   As head of Clinton's Office of Management and Budget, Raines was
part of a new White House team that helped set a tone of cooperation
that proved critical in ending the administration's long-running
budget battle with Republicans in Congress last year. ``I have the
luxury of not having been there for the old fight,'' Raines said in an
interview soon after joining the administration. ``If people want to
have the old fight, they don't really need me.''
<p>
   Raines was also the point man on administration efforts to promote
political and financial revival in Washington. And the 49-year-old
Seattle native was one of the most powerful African-American civilians
ever to serve in the executive branch.
<p>
   Raines' announcement surprised many of his White House colleagues,
and his departure comes at a delicate time for Clinton politically.
Following the announced resignation of Energy Secretary Federico Pena,
White House aides are sensitive to the appearance that senior
officials are heading for the exits at a time when Clinton is still
enmeshed in an obstruction of justice investigation.
<p>
   Clinton  &MD;  who aides said was informed by Raines of his decision
Friday  &MD;  said in a statement he regretted Raines' departure and hailed
him has a ``brilliant OMB director.''
<p>
   The White House said Clinton plans to nominate OMB's deputy
director, Jacob J. Lew, as Raines' successor. Lew, 42, is a career
bureaucrat who, for a brief stint, served as acting OMB director in
1996, prior to Raines' confirmation.
<p>
   Raines said he had hoped to remain at OMB for at least another year
until Clinton and Congress reached agreement on a plan for shoring up
the Social Security system. But Raines has made no secret of his
desire to return to the private sector and run a major firm after
leaving the administration. The chance to take over at Fannie Mae, he
said, was an offer too good to refuse.
<p>
   ``There is never a good time to stop being budget director,''
Raines said. ``If I'd had my preference, this would have happened a
year from now after the Social Security debate.'' But an invitation to
head Fannie Mae ``is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
<p>
   Raines' annual salary at OMB is just under $150,000. In 1996, the
most recent year for which information is available, Johnson earned an
estimated $7.2 million in cash, stock options and other compensation
as Fannie Mae's chief.

 &UR; Grand Forks Paper Wins Journalism Award for Public Service &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Los Angeles Times won two Pulitzer Prizes and The New York
Times won three Tuesday, but the most coveted Pulitzer of all  &MD;  the
gold medal for meritorious public service  &MD;  was awarded to the small
Grand Forks, N.D., Herald (circulation 37,000) for its coverage of the
March 1997 floods and fire that destroyed more than 10 percent of the
city's homes and ravaged the newspaper's own offices.
<p>
   The Pulitzer Prize Board praised the Grand Forks paper for its
``sustained and informative coverage, vividly illustrated with
photographs, that helped hold its community together in the wake'' of
disaster.
<p>
   The Los Angeles Times won its Pulitzers in the spot news categery
for ``comprehensive coverage of a botched bank robbery and subsequent
police shootout'' in North Hollywood last spring and in the feature
photography category, for Clarence Williams' ``powerful images
documenting the plight of young chidren with parents addicted to
alcohol and drugs.'' The photographs illustrated the paper's series of
stories on ``Orphans of Addiction'' written by Sonia Nazario.
<p>
   Most Pulitzers are given to individuals, but the prize for the
shootout coverage was given to The Times' staff, 30 of whom worked on
various aspects of the story on the first day alone.
<p>
   This was the third Pulitzer in six years awarded to The Times for
coverage of a Southern California tragedy. The staff also won
Pulitzers for coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and for the 1994
Northridge earthquake.
<p>
   The New York Times' citations Tuesday went to Linda Greenhouse, in
beat reporting, for her ``consistently illuminating coverage of the
United States Surpeme Court''; to Michiko Kakutani, in criticism, for
her ``passionate, intelligent writing on books and contemporary
literature''; and to The New York Times staff for international
reporting, for its ``revealing series that profiled the corrosive
effects of drug corruption in Mexico.''
<p>
   The Pulitzers, the most prestigious prizes in journalism, have been
awarded annually since 1917 by Columbia University, and the
announcement Tuesday that the Grand Forks Herald had won the public
service award is in keeping with the Pulitzer Prize Board's long
tradition of honoring smaller newspapers for overcoming tremendous
obstacles.
<p>
   The Herald's presses were already under water from floods triggered
by melting snow and ice left by winter blizzards when electrical fires
broke out last April 19, gutting the newsroom and circulation
department of the paper and forcing the staff to relocate. The next
day's paper was written and edited in makeshift offices at the
University of North Dakota, and when floods hit the university the
next day, the staff relocated again, to an elementary school 12 miles
away, in Manvel, N.D.
<p>
   The paper's newsroom staff of 57  &MD;  most of whom were flood victims
themselves  &MD;  worked out of the school library, and the paper was
actually printed at the plant of the Herald's fellow Knight-Ridder
newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, 300 miles away.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   The Grand Forks Herald was not the only small newspaper honored in
Tuesday's Pulitzer announcement.
<p>
   Bernard L. Stein, editor and publisher of the Riverdale Press, a
New York City weekly newspaper with a circulation of 11,800, was
honored for ``gracefully written editorials on politics'' and other
local issues. Stein, a Pulitzer finalist on two previous occasions,
said his prize honored excellent journalists working for small
community newspapers throughout the country.
<p>
   As usual, however, most of the Pulitzers went to big-city dailies  &MD; 
The Baltimore Sun (Gary Cohn and Will Englund, in investigative
reporting, for their ``compelling series on the international
shipbreaking industry that revealed the dangers posed to workers and
the environment when discarded (Navy) ships are dismantled''); to the
Chicago Tribune (Paul Salopek, in explanatory reporting, for his
``enlightening profile of the Human Genome Diveristy Project, which
seeks to chart the genetic relationship among all people,''); to the
New York Daily News (columnist Mike McAlary, in commentary, for his
``coverage of the brutalization of a Haitian immigrant'' allegedly at
the hands of police officers); and to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
(Martha Rial, in spot news photography, for her ``life-affirming
portraits of survivors of the conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi'').
<p>
   The remaining Pulitzers in journalism were awarded to Russell
Carollo and Jeff Nesmith of the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News, in national
reporting, for disclosing ``dangerous flaws and mismanagment in the
military health care system,'' stories that prompted reforms in the
system; to Thomas French of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, in
feature writing, for his ``detailed and compassionate narrative
portrait of a mother and two daughters slain on a Florida vacation,
and the three-year investigatiion into their murders''; and to Stephen
P. Breen of the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press, in cartooning.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Each Pulitzer Prize carries with it a $5,000 award, except for the
prize in public service, which carries a gold medal. All the prizes
will be presented May 28 during a luncheon at Columbia University.

 &UR; Train Shipment of Napalm Generates Political Firestorm &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A decade ago, it was a barge loaded with garbage that generated an
international stink, floating homeless down the East Coast because no
one would take its contents.
<p>
   Now it is a rail car filled with napalm, bound for the Chicago area
from Southern California this week amid a runaway debate about how
best to dispose of the deadly chemical remnants of the Vietnam War.
<p>
   The train left Fallbrook in northern San Diego County Saturday
carrying two 6,000-gallon drums of napalm in one of its cars. It
rumbled through Texas Tuesday, headed for an Indiana treatment plant
as the first step in a two-year plan to dispose of 3 million gallons
of the jellied gasoline and turn it into industrial fuel.
<p>
   But there is a hitch: The treatment plant no longer wants the
stuff, and an array of powerful people in the Midwest wants the train
to turn around.
<p>
   The political maelstrom that the disposal has generated in Chicago
in recent weeks ``has made it impossible to continue with this napalm
recycling project,'' Pollution Control Industries President Robert L.
Campbell said Tuesday. The ``tug of war'' over the issue has given the
company no choice but to pull out of the $1.7 million contract, he
said.
<p>
   Navy officials, hoping to finally overcome numerous false starts in
their 16-year-old effort to get rid of the napalm, were blindsided by
the company's withdrawal. And while officials scrambled to find a
solution Tuesday, no one seemed certain what would happen to the train
bound for nowhere.
<p>
   ``We really don't know what's going to happen at this point. We're
reviewing all our options,'' said Lee Saunders, spokesman for the
Navy's environmental division in San Diego.
<p>
   Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., knows what he wants to happen.
<p>
   ``I'm hopeful the train will simply turn around and go back to (the
Naval Weapons Station) at Fallbrook and return the napalm there. Then
we can roll up our sleeves and work with the Navy to address an urgent
need to get rid of it in a safe and sensible way,'' he said.
<p>
   Since 1973, the Navy facility in Fallbrook has housed the
military's entire arsenal of napalm in 33,000 unfused bombs. But
Southern California politicians have been pushing with increasing
stridence for its disposal, noting that some of the bombs were leaking
toxins.
<p>
   As part of the plan approved by the Navy at a total cost of $25
million, hundreds of shipments of the napalm were to be sent by train
over the next two years to the PCI plant in East Chicago, Ind.,
outside Chicago. There it was to be treated and turned into fuel for
cement kilns. Trains would head out almost daily from Fallbrook,
officials said.
<p>
   But Blagojevich and other politicians have skewered the plan in
recent weeks, saying the Navy thrust it on them with no real warning
or explanation. The congressman said he is worried about potential
leaks and explosions from the shipments as they pass through numerous
residential areas.
<p>
   ``This was a serious weapon of war that was dropped from the U.S.
arsenal because it was considered inhumane, and I just don't think it
makes sense to send it two-thirds of the way across the country like
this,'' he said in an interview. ``The risk is overwhelming.''
Blagojevich wants the napalm taken to disposal sites in Utah or
elsewhere.
<p>
   But Navy officials and others involved in the disposal insisted
Tuesday that the napalm is safe for transport, despite the firestorm
that has erupted over it.
<p>
   ``Unfortunately, people are reacting to the emotional nature of
this issue,'' said Greg Koller, spokesman for the Ohio-based Battelle
company, a nonprofit scientific firm that was awarded the job of
overseeing the disposal project and hired PCI to convert it to fuel.
<p>
   ``Just the word `napalm' conjures up a lot of images,'' he said.
``People remember the famous picture of the little girl with her back
burned, running, and they don't understand from a technical aspect
that this stuff is safer than the gas at their local gas station.''
<p>
   Indeed, federal railway standards rate napalm as a low to moderate
risk, safer than propane and other gases, said Jerry Jenkins,
spokesman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, the line that is
carrying the napalm.
<p>
   Burlington would not pinpoint the train's location Tuesday, saying
only that it is expected to be somewhere between Amarillo, Texas, and
Kansas City, Mo., by Wednesday.
<p>
   As of late Tuesday, neither the Navy nor Battelle officials had
asked the rail line to alter its course, and the train  &MD;  carrying the
napalm along with dozens of cars of other commercial cargo  &MD;  was
continuing on as planned, Jenkins said. The napalm was scheduled to
reach East Chicago sometime next week.
<p>
   At Battelle, Koller said he is not sure whether the company could
ask the train to turn around or even stop its route, because of
environmental laws governing the transport of contaminants.

 &UR; D.C. to Investigate How Killer Was Freed (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  After a murderer on parole in Washington stabbed their
daughter to death, it wasn't money Gertrude and Gerfried Pruckmayr
wanted. They sued instead for answers, demanding that the government
tell them how a killer could be freed to kill again.
<p>
   District of Columbia attorneys promised the Pruckmayrs Tuesday that
the city's new inspector general will investigate the 1993 parole of
Leo Gonzales Wright and the apparent government lapses that preceded
the murder of Bettina Pruckmayr on Dec. 16, 1995.
<p>
   Inspector General E. Barrett Prettyman Jr. will report his findings
no later than January 1999, describing how Wright was freed and
allowed to remain free despite parole violations. The report will
document the errors, if any, of individual government workers.
<p>
   ``It will be fair and complete,'' Prettyman pledged. ``We're going
to attempt to improve the system.''
<p>
   For the Pruckmayrs, who drove from Media, Pa., to sign the
eight-page agreement, the announcement marks a bittersweet turning in
their lawsuit and their lives. Dropping their complaint, they are
investing in the hope that a shocking death might be better explained
and never repeated.
<p>
   ``I feel this is some progress. We don't want people to just shrug
it off and say, `Oops,' '' said Gerfried Pruckmayr, 65, a chemist.
``We have some pieces of the puzzle, but we don't know how they fit
together.''
<p>
   Bettina Pruckmayr, a 26-year-old human rights lawyer and graduate
of Georgetown University Law Center, was parking her car near Logan
Circle after Christmas shopping when Wright spotted her. He told
police he wanted drugs and was looking for something to steal.
<p>
   Holding a 5-inch knife at Pruckmayr's neck, Wright drove his
victim 18 blocks to an automated teller machine. After he robbed her,
she wrote down her ATM code, admitted she had only about $20 left in
her account, then tried to escape. Wright grabbed her and stabbed her
38 times.
<p>
   ``You are the most violent, dangerous person I've ever
encountered,'' U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan told Wright when
he sentenced him to life without parole in September 1996. ``You will
die in jail. This court will do everything in its power to ensure that
you ... will never walk the streets of this country or any place
again.''
<p>
   Gertrude Pruckmayr, 62, biting her lip, her eyes glistening with
tears, said Tuesday that the signs of Wright's awfulness were there to
see: ``Anybody could've predicted it.''
<p>
   Wright shot and killed Washington taxi driver Joseph N. Woodbury in
1976 when Woodbury refused to turn over $19. Sent to prison for a term
of 20 to 60 years, Wright was freed after 17 years. The Pruckmayrs
contend that his prison records failed to show his full disciplinary
record.
<p>
   After his release, Wright's parole was not revoked, even though he
repeatedly missed drug tests and tested positive at other times for
cocaine and heroin use. Nor was he returned to prison after a 1995
arrest on a charge of cocaine possession.
<p>
   The initial 1995 drug charge was dropped when a D.C. narcotics
detective failed to show up for a preliminary hearing, but a grand
jury soon indicted Wright in the case. No one notified the D.C. Parole
Board, however, which decided nine days later that there was not
enough evidence to keep Wright behind bars.
<p>
   The Pruckmayrs believe their daughter died because of a ``breakdown
in the prison and parole system,'' one of their attorneys, Paul M.
Flicker, said Tuesday. The city government, in the settlement
agreement, explicitly denied allegations of wrongdoing.

 &UR; For Katharine Graham, Proof in the Pulitzer (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In her autobiography, ``Personal History,'' Katharine
Graham writes in sometimes heart-rending detail about overcoming
shyness and a sense of never being quite good enough  &MD;  which she
continued to feel even as her book became a bestseller. That
diffidence was still palpable Tuesday as she stood before a newsroom
full of Washington Post employees and heard the announcement: She had
won a Pulitzer Prize.
<p>
   `` &UR; Now &LR;  do you believe you wrote a good book?'' asked editorial
page editor Meg Greenfield, one of the author's closest friends. Mrs.
Graham  &MD;  and to most of the several hundred people gathered in the
newsroom to congratulate her she will always be  &UR; Mrs. Graham &LR;   &MD;  is
notorious for being quick to minimize her own abilities and
accomplishments.
<p>
   ``She is a wonderful combination of insecurity and total
authority,'' said Robert Gottlieb, the book's editor, Tuesday. ``I
said to her this morning, `Kay, stop trying to deflect the glory.'
It's not that she doesn't love it. ... Maybe now she can accept her
achievement. If she doesn't, she needs to be spanked!''
<p>
    &UR; Mrs. Graham? Spanked? &LR;  Not likely.
<p>
   One of the story lines that carry through the 625-page book tells
how she worried all her life about pleasing others and how she
struggled to overcome that, which seems to have resonated particularly
with women readers. Memoirist and former college president Jill Ker
Conway, reviewing the book for The Post, wrote that ``what Graham
describes rings true for those of us old enough to remember the
culture that told women that their relationship with a man was their
life.''
<p>
   But reviewers and readers also found intriguing the story of her
upbringing as a child of privilege whose bright and accomplished
parents left their offspring to be raised by nannies in New York for
four years while they moved to Washington. Her father, financier
Eugene Meyer, worked for the War Industries Board. In 1933, he bought
The Post at a bankruptcy auction and spent the rest of his life trying
to make it both profitable and respectable.
<p>
   Many memoirs are vanity productions, based on personal
recollections, letters, old diaries and maybe a news clip or two. But
Graham, who is now chairman of the executive committee of The
Washington Post Co., undertook her project like an investigative
reporter, conducting more than 250 interviews and digging through
boxes of old letters, company memos and official documents.
<p>
   Researcher Evelyn Small sorted through the material and later
transcribed the author's handwritten narrative, through which a
phenomenal array of people walk, from Graham's mother's friend
Constantin Brancusi, the legendary sculptor, to, of course, Richard M.
Nixon. Her wedding pictures were snapped by Edward Steichen. She tells
how she danced the twist with President Kennedy (her daughter Lally
told her to pretend she was drying her rear end with a bath towel) and
(discreetly) reveals a ``romance'' with a waterfront union organizer
while she was a young reporter covering a strike in San Francisco.
<p>
   And always in the background of her story Washington is visible,
growing from the slow muddy city of the 1920s into the center of world
power  &MD;  from the panicky preparations for World War II to the sinking
confusion of Vietnam, from her decisions to publish the Pentagon
Papers and pursue Watergate to her friendship with Ronald and Nancy
Reagan.
<p>
   Some readers found it hard to believe that a woman who has had such
an extraordinary life could see herself as a kind of accidental
tourist at the helm of a high-speed yacht. But reviewers liked her
frankness and her lack of whining or scandal-mongering. ``Personal
History'' became a bestseller, with more than 231,000 copies sold in
hardcover. A paperback edition was recently released, with 80,000
copies in the first printing. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in the
New York Times: ``It is frank, self-critical, modest when necessary,
proud when justified and, above all, one that can tell a good story,
whether detailing an embarrassing anecdote (from which its owner was
far from immune) or outlining contemporary American history (to which
she was a frequent eyewitness).''
<p>
   The hardest part of the book for her to write, she said, was the
section about her husband. For a while she thought that describing in
detail the story of his mental illness and suicide would be
distressing for her four children, and suggested to Gottlieb that this
section be trimmed down. But the editor convinced her that unless she
told the whole story her husband would come across as ``an unpleasant
man who drank too much.'' The author decided that candor about mental
illness would help shed light on that problem for others.
<p>
   Her eldest son, Washington Post Publisher Donald Graham, has teased
her publicly about her tireless promotion of the book, which involved
numerous interviews, signings and appearances. That too was a new
frontier for her, and she did it with zest. ``A friend called while I
was in Boston and said, `Are you all right? I haven't seen you on
television for a couple of days,' '' she recalled.
<p>
   Graham, 80, once remarked that her goal was to win ``a Pulitzer
Prize for management,'' and she says she still wishes she had gone to
Harvard Business School. In her book she takes at least as much
pleasure in her company's rising profits as she does from her paper's
journalism.
<p>
   But she will gladly take the prize she got Tuesday. ``Let's be
frank, at my age to have this happen to you  &MD;  it's pinch yourself to
make sure it's really happening,'' she said.
<p>
   Perhaps only one person could outrank her in the newsroom Tuesday.
That was Herblock, The Post's legendary cartoonist, a multiple
Pulitzer winner himself and still drawing in his 89th year. He called
her ``Sweetie'' as he gave her a congratulatory kiss on the cheek, and
said, ``I told you if you hung around this newsroom long enough you'd
get the hang of it.''

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Dapper Mississippi liability lawyer Dick Scruggs had
spent the day on Capitol Hill a few weeks back tending to details of
the national tobacco settlement he helped broker. But he still had an
intriguing evening appointment to keep.
<p>
   Inside an elegant Willard Hotel suite, holding a script he'd never
seen, Scruggs read lines with Al Pacino for Michael Mann, who's
directing a still-untitled Touchstone Pictures production.
<p>
   For nearly a half-hour, Scruggs said, he auditioned to play himself
in a movie about Jeffrey Wigand, the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.
whistle-blower, and Lowell Bergman, a ``60 Minutes'' producer. Bergman
wanted to air Wigand's allegations of tobacco industry chicanery, but
CBS brass killed the interview. Then Wigand retained Scruggs after the
tobacco giant sued him for breaking a lifetime secrecy pact.
<p>
   And how did Scruggs' audition go? ``After dinner, the director
patted me on the head and said, `Dick, we may be getting a
professional actor. You're fired.' ''
<p>
   There are, however, no hard feelings, Scruggs said. The film crew
has already been scoping out his Pascagoula home, and Mann starts
shooting next month in Louisville, home of Brown &AMP; Williamson's
headquarters.
<p>
   But that movie won't be the only screen version of the tobacco
wars.
<p>
   Washington producer Gerald Rafshoon has just bought the film rights
to author Peter Pringle's new book, ``Cornered: Big Tobacco at the Bar
of Justice,'' about the lawyers who took on the cigarette makers.
<p>
   Rafshoon wants to turn it into a TV mini-series because the subject
``needs to be longer than two hours. There are some very interesting
characters here, not just the lawyers, but those wonderful folks who
brought you nonaddictive nicotine.''

   A tour of Houston's Johnson Space Center had President Clinton
orbiting with enthusiasm Tuesday.
<p>
   Clinton dropped in to observe the training regimen of Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, 76, the once and future astronaut set to reprise his
1962 Earth orbit in October aboard a space shuttle.
<p>
   Clinton acknowledged that Glenn's mission had set him to thinking
about his own post-presidential career. ``Yeah, I like it,'' he said.
``I'm going to apply.''
<p>
   But could he pass the physical? In a video call with astronauts in
Cape Canaveral who will go up on a shuttle mission later this week,
Clinton said he looked forward to their research on the human
neurological system ``because I'm moving to those years where I'm
getting dizzy and having all these problems.''
<p>
   During Tuesday's tour, Clinton expressed special interest in NASA's
space suits, reports The Post's John Harris. Suit technician Amy Ross
sported one when Clinton greeted her. ``Does she look great or what?''
Clinton enthused, adding, ``Nice muscles.''
<p>
   Glenn, for his part, said NASA personnel seem like a brainier lot
than he remembers. ``These people are dealing with science at a level
we weren't even thinking about getting into back then,'' he said.
``These people are just half again smarter than we even thought we
were back then.''

day.

   ``We're here for a vacation, that's all it is,'' Woodward told The

enough, is John Podesta, Clinton's deputy chief of staff.
<p>
   ``It wasn't business and it wasn't romance. We've been buddies for
years and get together every five or six weeks,'' said Tony Podesta.

 &UR; Hinckley Loses Appeal on Leave (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr., who wants
to leave St. Elizabeths Hospital for monthly visits with his parents,
was turned down Tuesday by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of
Appeals.
<p>
   The judges upheld a decision issued last June by U.S. District
Judge June L. Green, who said she believed that Hinckley remains a
danger to himself and others. Green denied Hinckley's request to spend
12 hours a month away from the Southeast Washington hospital with his
parents, John and Jo Ann.
<p>
   Hinckley, 42, has been confined at the hospital since June 1982,
after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March 30,
1981, shooting of President Reagan. He also wounded three others in
the attack.
<p>
   Although Hinckley's treatment team was in favor of the monthly
visits, the hospital's review board denied his request last year. The
review board found that Hinckley deceived hospital staff about what
some viewed as an obsessive interest in the hospital's chief
pharmacist  &MD;  a woman who resembles actress Jodie Foster, whom Hinckley
imagined he would impress by shooting Reagan.
<p>
   Green cited the board's decision and Hinckley's behavior in her
opinion.
<p>
   Hinckley's attorney, Barry Wm. Levine, appealed Green's ruling,
saying Green should have permitted him to examine records concerning
the review board's deliberations.
<p>
   Levine said the board could have been influenced by improper
motivations, adding that its decision could have swayed Green
unfairly. He said Green should not have given the board's decision any
consideration.
<p>
   But the appellate judges noted that Green cited numerous other
reasons for denying Hinckley's bid, including testimony from a
psychiatrist called by the government who warned that Hinckley has a
history of masking symptoms.
<p>
   The judges also found that the board's internal deliberations were
privileged, or secret, discussions. They said that hospital review
board members could face safety concerns if deliberations were made
public in cases involving people acquitted of criminal charges by
reason of insanity. In addition, the judges stated, review board
members might be reluctant to criticize the findings of treatment
teams if their discussions could become public.

 &UR; Despite Pleas, Va. Executes Paraguayan &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Despite requests from the U.S. State Department and an
international court for a delay, a Paraguayan citizen convicted of
murdering an Arlington woman, Va., was put to death Tuesday night
after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case and Virginia's
governor refused to intervene.
<p>
   Angel Francisco Breard, 32, was pronounced dead at 10:39 p.m. after
being injected with lethal chemicals at the Greensville Correctional
Center in Jarratt, Va. The execution was delayed for an hour and a
half while corrections officials waited for the court's ruling and
Gilmore's subsequent decision.
<p>
   At 8:22 p.m., with the execution then scheduled for 9 p.m., the
high court rejected, 6 to 3, Breard's claim that he deserved a new
trial because he was not told at the time of his arrest that he had
the right under an international treaty to consult with a Paraguayan
consular official.
<p>
   That left Breard's fate in the hands of Gov. James S. Gilmore III
(R), who had made it clear during the afternoon that he was leaning
toward allowing Breard to be executed for the 1992 murder of Ruth
Dickie in her Arlington apartment.
<p>
   About a half-hour before the execution, Gilmore issued a statement
saying: ``As governor of Virginia, my first duty is to ensure that
those who reside within our borders  &MD;  both American citizens and
foreign nationals  &MD;  may conduct their lives free from the fear of
crime.''
<p>
   Delaying the execution, he said, ``would have the practical effect
of transferring responsibility from the courts of the Commonwealth and
the United States to the International Court.''
<p>
   Lawyers for Breard had argued that a consular official might have
been able to persuade the defendant to plead guilty and seek a life
sentence. But a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in an unsigned
opinion, said there was no legal basis for Breard's claims. They also
said that Virginia's violation of the international treaty probably
did not affect the outcome of Breard's trial.
<p>
   The court's majority was unmoved by last week's decision by the
International Court of Justice ordering the United States to halt the
execution to give them time to review Paraguay's claim on Breard's
behalf. The 15-member international body, also known as the World
Court, has no enforcement mechanism, and the U.S. Supreme Court
rejected the Paraguayan government's argument that the World Court
order was binding on the United States.
<p>
   Gilmore also had to weigh a highly unusual plea from Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright, who asked him to put off the execution
because it could harm Americans accused of crimes in foreign
countries. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which Breard
alleges was violated in his case, also guarantees Americans arrested
abroad the right to consult with consular officers.
<p>
   Albright wrote Gilmore on Monday that she was acting ``with great
reluctance'' but she was ``concerned about the possible negative
consequences for the many U.S. citizens who live and travel abroad.''
She reiterated her request Tuesday during a speech at Howard
University. Describing Breard's crime as ``heinous,'' she said she was
seeking to protect ``reciprocity'' to make sure that ``if any of our
citizens find themselves in trouble, they will be accorded their
rights.''
<p>
   An Arlington jury convicted Breard, now 32, of capital murder for
stabbing Dickie, 39, five times in the neck during a sexual assault.
Breard said on the stand that he had killed her because he was under
the influence of a satanic curse. During the penalty phase of the
trial, prosecutors said he had tried to sexually assault two other
women.

 &UR; Paraguayan Is Executed in Virginia (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Virginia put to death a 32-year-old Paraguayan for
murder Tuesday night, after the governor brushed aside international
appeals to spare him and a highly unusual warning from Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright that his execution could serve to endanger
Americans abroad.
<p>
   Less than an hour before a scheduled lethal injection, the Supreme
Court set Virginia free to execute the condemned man, Angel Francisco
Breard, by lethal injection for a 1992 murder. The Supreme Court ruled
6-3 that Breard had raised his legal challenge too late.
<p>
   Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III, after taking more than 90
minutes after the court decision to consider Breard's last-minute
appeal, refused to delay the execution at a prison facility in
Jarrett, Va.
<p>
   ``Mr. Breard having committed a heinous and depraved murder, and
his guilt being unquestioned, and the legal issues being resolved
against him, and the U.S. Supreme Court having denied the petitions of
Breard and Paraguay, I find no reason to interfere with his
sentence,'' the governor said.
<p>
   In its ruling earlier in the evening, the Supreme Court said the
government of Paraguay had no legal right to ask U.S. courts to spare
Breard's life and had no right to expect U.S. courts to bow to the
wishes of the International Court of Justice that the execution be
postponed.
<p>
   The case reached into the sphere of international law because
Virginia had failed to inform Breard  &MD;  as he had a right to be told
under a treaty signed by 130 nations  &MD;  that he could seek help from
the Paraguayan consulor officer after his arrest for murdering a
neighbor in their apartment building.
<p>
   The International Court of Justice, known informally as the World
Court, has agreed to consider the dispute, which pits Paraguay
directly against the U.S. government and indirectly against the
Virginia state government.
<p>
   The Supreme Court said it was giving ``respectful consideration''
to the World Court's role in the treaty dispute. But the majority
justices said the World Court proceedings could have no effect on the
criminal justice system in the United States.
<p>
   Under U.S. law, the Supreme Court said, Breard's failure to raise
his treaty violation claim while his case was in Virginia's state
courts meant that he could not raise it now in the federal courts.
<p>
   ``It is unfortunate that this matter comes before us while
proceedings are pending before the (World Court) that might have been
brought to that court earlier,'' the court majority said in its
unsigned, eight-page decision.
<p>
   The majority noted that the U.S. government's executive branch was
free to use diplomacy and, in fact, had done so to try to satisfy
Paraguay earlier. It also noted that Albright had asked Virginia's
governor to postpone the execution because of the dispute pending at
the World Court.
<p>
   ``If the governor wishes to wait for the decision of the (World
Court), that is his prerogative,'' the court said. ``But nothing in
our existing case law allows us to make that choice for him.''
<p>
   The court majority included Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
five justices, Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, David Souter and Clarence Thomas. The dissenting justices were
Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens.
<p>
   The secretary of state, in her direct plea to the governor, said,
``The execution of Mr. Breard in the present circumstances could lead
some countries to contend incorrectly that the U.S. does not take
seriously its obligations under the Convention.''
<p>
   Yesterday, Albright said the execution could not only undercut
accepted international rules but also pose dangers to Americans
abroad.
<p>
   ``We are part of an international system in which it is important
to respect the various rules and conventions and laws that have been
created to make that system work,'' Albright told students at Howard
University.
<p>
   ``There are a lot of Americans that travel abroad who sometimes get
into trouble and who need to have the availability of our consular
officers' being able to visit them if they have been jailed unjustly
or even if they've been jailed justly or if they find themselves in
some kind of a difficult situation.''
<p>
   She said her department now has orders ``to make very clear to
state and local officials that they have a responsibility to let a
foreign national know that he or she can, in fact, have consular
advice.''
<p>
   A senior White House official said Albright's intervention may have
blunted some of the negative reaction from Paraguay and neighboring
countries. President Clinton will leave Wednesday night for a state
visit to Chile followed by a summit with the leaders of all the
hemisphere's democracies, including Paraguay.

   At his trial for the stabbing murder of Ruth Dickie, Breard
confessed to the killing but said he had done so only because his
father-in-law had placed on him a Satanic curse. He has been on
Virginia's death row since he was sentenced in 1993 to die.
