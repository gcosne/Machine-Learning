<p>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spin  &MD;  Dawn will break this morning on the 32nd
Ryder Cup, which means that Tom Kite is now in harm's way.
<p>
   Until this point, everything has gone smoothly for the little
U.S. captain from Austin, Texas.
<p>
   That's more than can be said of his European counterpart,
Spain's Seve Ballesteros, whose bombastic personality flared two
weeks ago when he kicked one of his fellow Spaniards, Miguel Angel
Martin, off the team in order to clear the deck for his close
friend, Jose Maria Olazabal.
<p>
   On the other hand, Kite has said all of the right things while
being a fountain of positive reinforcement for his players. Like a
good parent, he has pampered them when necessary, yet has prodded
them to bring back the coveted Cup that disappeared from American
soil two years ago.
<p>
   Kite's level-headed approach has reflected well on his 12-man
team. They mimic his ways, joking occasionally but mostly being
careful what they say.
<p>
   ``Tom told us to have fun, play great golf and not give them any
bulletin-board stuff,'' said Davis Love III, who, along with Tiger
Woods, Tom Lehman and Phil Mickelson, will be counted on heavily
over the next three days at Valderrama Golf Club.
<p>
   ``His strategy is to make sure everybody gets in and has fun,
and that we get the guys who are putting well out there the most.''
<p>
   Love said Kite has employed a ``simple approach'' to handling
egos that are, in some cases, as big as the nearby Mediterranean
Sea.
<p>
   ``Tom makes it easy, and I think that's why this team has come
together so well,'' Love added.
<p>
   The Americans are a distinct contrast to the Europeans, who also
seem to reflect their captain's personality. Even though they are
the defenders, the Europeans have been popping off like
professional boxers. Perhaps they truly believe this will be a
``War By the Shore,'' as the Spanish media have dubbed the matches.
<p>
   First, Lee Westwood, a 24-year-old English rookie, charged that
Woods was ``not a phenomenal player.'' Then the little Welshman,
Ian Woosnam, claimed he would ``kick Tiger Woods' butt.''
<p>
   Colin Montgomerie must have felt left out, because on the eve of
the battle, ``Monty'' took this last pre-game shot at Woods, whom
he will face this morning in best ball.
<p>
   ``Tiger Woods can win all five matches, but if the Americans
lose (the Cup), it doesn't mean diddly,'' said Montgomerie, who
will team with Bernhard Langer in the match against Woods and his
partner, Mark O'Meara.
<p>
   ``One man can't win the Ryder Cup. Tiger Woods is not
Superman.''
<p>
   Some of America's past captains would rail about such comments,
especially when it is aimed at the Yanks' star, who just happens to
be playing in his first Ryder Cup at the tender age of 21.
<p>
   Not Kite. He just smiles and shakes his head when told of the
Europeans' remarks.
<p>
   ``I think that everyone is excited that Tiger is on this team,''
Kite said.
<p>
   ``Not only the players on my team, but the players on the
European team. Certainly, I think it's to be expected that everyone
would like to have a chance to get a shot at him.''
<p>
   But Kite quickly adds that he hopes his players don't stoop to
similar tactics.
<p>
   ``I really don't see any reason to try to offend anybody, in any
situation,'' he said. ``It's never been my intent. I don't know if
that's diplomatic or just being nice to people. I just know that
it's worked well for me over the years.''
<p>
   In many ways, Kite's captaincy has mirrored the leadership of
Tom Watson, who led the Americans to their last Ryder Cup victory
in 1993. Unlike Lanny Wadkins (1995) and even Raymond Floyd (1989),
Kite seems to be taking a stealth-like approach to this weekend's
matches.
<p>
   ``There are some similarities, definitely,'' said Love, who
played a big role in the '93 victory. ``Both were great players,
and both are pretty cool characters.''
<p>
   Kite certainly held his own as a player, piling up a 15-9-4
record. Never an imposing opponent, perhaps because of his 5-foot-8
frame and thick glasses, Kite was unbeaten in seven singles matches
(5-0-2).
<p>
   ``I think that my experience (in the Ryder Cup) will help the
team, although it certainly shouldn't be overrated,'' Kite said.
``I can make all the right moves in the world, but I can't get the
ball in the hole for them.
<p>
   ``I guess it really comes down to my hunches. I've spent a lot
of time watching these guys this week, and they all  &MD;  every one of
them  &MD;  are playing well. Now if I can just get the pairings
right.''
<p>
   To that end, Kite has spent countless hours in meetings with
players, asking them whom they would like to be paired with.
<p>
   ``We can't play all 12 guys in the first four (sets of) matches,
so I've got to figure out what eight might work best,'' he said.
``It's a very complicated puzzle.''
<p>
   No kidding. If these 28 matches over the next three days are as
close as the past five Ryder Cups  &MD;  two were decided by 2 points,
two by 1 point and the other ended in a tie  &MD;  Kite's decisions will
make or break what many are calling the biggest golf event of all
time.
<p>
   No one understands this better than Kite, who devoted a entire
chapter in his recently released book,`` A Fairway to Heaven,'' to
his experience in the Ryder Cup and his role as the current leader.
<p>
   ``Among the first advice I received was to not make the mistakes
others have made,'' Kite wrote. ``But if the history of the Ryder
Cup has taught me anything, it is this: Decisions are only mistakes
if they turn out badly.''
<p>
   In other words, Thomas Oliver Kite can only hope his captaincy
will be smiled upon.

 &UR; COURT SAYS FAMILIES CAN COLLECT FOR DECEASED ELDERS' SUFFERING &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDY NICHOLS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The Arizona Republic &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   In a landmark decision on the issue of elder abuse, the state
Supreme Court has ruled that family members and others can collect
for the victim's pain and suffering even after their death.
<p>
   The decision sets elder abuse apart from other situations, in
which damages for pain and suffering can be collected only by the
victim and become moot upon their death.
<p>
   The decision came in the case of Fred and Frances Denton,
featured in The Arizona Republic's five-part series Homes Without
Hope, which ran in June. It uncovered abuse, neglect and financial
exploitation in adult care homes in Arizona.
<p>
    &UR; ``As a result of this decision, those who commit elder abuse
and their insurance carriers will no longer profit by delaying the
case until the victim dies,'' said A. Paul Blunt, attorney for Fred
Denton.
<p>
   ``Until now, that's just what they've done.''
<p>
   The unanimous ruling, issued Thursday, reversed a lower court's
decision.
<p>
   Fred Denton sued Paradise Homes in Phoenix for abuse and neglect
and breach of contract over the care that his wife, Frances,
received in one of its adult care homes.
<p>
   Frances developed a life-threatening bedsore while living at the
home in 1993. The suit also names the home-health organization and
nurse involved in Frances' care. She died in 1995.
<p>
   The ruling did not address the issues of neglect and abuse
involved in the case, which will continue in Maricopa County
Superior Court.
<p>
   Fred Denton, fighting at times to control his emotions, said he
was pleased with the ruling.
<p>
   ``It's good to hear, but then it's not over until it's over,''
Denton said.
<p>
   Denton said his motivation is not money, but a desire to make
care homes more careful.
<p>
   ``What I'm looking forward to whenever it comes to trial is,
more than anything, that justice is done,'' Denton said. ``Whether
I get $10 or a million, I hope it will wake up these people.''
<p>
   Greg Michael, president of American Family Care Corp., which
owns Paradise Homes, called the ruling ``monumental'' and said it
will cause insurance companies to raise liability rates.
<p>
   ``All it does is raise the cost of doing business to everyone in
the industry,'' Michael said. ``It's a trend where plaintiffs'
lawyers lobby the legislature to create new ways to recover
damages. That's America.''
<p>
   Michael said his company did everything possible for Frances
Denton and followed a doctor's orders. He said the Supreme Court
ruling will not improve care for the elderly.
<p>
   ``Will it really protect anyone?'' Michael asked. ``We took, and
still take, tremendous precautions to make sure everyone is as
healthy as possible.''
<p>
   Michael's attorney, Jim Broening, was out of town and unable to
comment on the ruling.
<p>
   The ruling is precedent-setting because it is the first time the
Supreme Court has interpreted the elder abuse statute.
<p>
   The court's opinion, written by Justice James Moeller, states
that eliminating the damages after death would give defendants ``a
great incentive to delay litigation until the victim dies.''
<p>
   ``In many elder abuse actions, the claim for pain and suffering
will often be the most significant element of damages,'' the ruling
states.
<p>
   ``Persons bringing such cases usually will not have claims for
lost earnings or diminution of earning capacity. Their medical and
other special damages will usually be covered by Medicare or other
insurance.
<p>
   ``As a result, an elder abuse case that proceeds to trial
without damages available for pain and suffering will often be
senseless and futile.''
<p>
   Frances Denton was 74 years old and had Alzheimer's disease and
other health problems when Fred put her in an adult care home run
by Paradise Homes.
<p>
   The home advertised that it specialized in Alzheimer's care.
<p>
   But within six weeks, Frances fell and hurt herself four times,
became emaciated after losing nearly an eighth of her body weight,
suffered a drug overdose and dehydration and developed a huge,
life-threatening pressure sore that rotted her flesh down to the
bone.
<p>
   Fred later learned that Frances slipped because her roommate had
defecated on the floors.
<p>
   Fred said she was never the same after her brief stay at the
home.
<p>
   The sore required a 20- by 30-centimeter skin graft to repair.
After surgery, Frances moved to a nursing home, where she died.
<p>
   While Frances was still alive, Fred sued the home and its owner,
American Family Care Corp., asserting negligence, breach of
contract and elder abuse.
<p>
   When Frances died, the defendants asked the court to eliminate
claims for pain and suffering.
<p>
   The court granted the motion, and Fred appealed to the state
Supreme Court.
<p>
   In interpreting the elder abuse statute, the court said the
legislature's intent was clear.
<p>
   ``Arizona has a substantial population of elderly people, and
the legislature was concerned about elder abuse.
<p>
   ``In civil actions for elder abuse, pain and suffering may be
the only compensable damages the victim may recover.''
<p>
   The court also pointed out that California has similar
legislation.
<p>
   The Republic's series generated more than 2,000 responses from
readers and spurred a legislative task force and governor's
commission. The task force will meet from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday
at the state Capitol, 1700 W. Washington. The Commission on Elder
Care and End of Life Issues meets on Oct. 7.

 &UR; ARIZONA'S NEW GOVERNOR TO FACE CONSERVATIVE CHALLENGER &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Just three weeks after taking office, Gov. Jane Hull is facing a
political threat from the conservative wing of the Republican
Party.
<p>
   State Sen. Tom Patterson said Thursday that he will file papers
next week announcing a gubernatorial exploratory campaign
committee, the first formal step in his bid for the Governor's
Office in 1998.
<p>
   ``I'm going to run,'' the Phoenix Republican told The Arizona
Republic.''
<p>
   Patterson's entry into the GOP primary will likely trigger a
shooting match between the conservative and moderate wings of the
state GOP going into the 1998 primary elections in September.
<p>
   Patterson plans to travel the state casting himself as a
conservative alternative to Hull, who took office Sept. 8 after the
resignation of former Gov. Fife Symington, who was convicted on
seven felony counts.
<p>
   ``I'm not trying to embarrass her or make her governorship into
a failure,'' Patterson said. ``My strategy is to be there when
people start thinking (about the '98 election) . . . that I am the
conservative in the race, that I'm politically credible, that I'm
not dead meat hanging.''
<p>
   Arizona's ``resign to run'' law prevents Patterson from making
an official declaration of his candidacy. He said he plans to
establish a formal campaign committee and make an official
announcement early next year.
<p>
   The 52-year-old emergency room physician has been under pressure
to make a decision about the race because his sources of campaign
funds began to dry up after Hull took office.
<p>
   By forming an exploratory committee, Patterson can begin raising
a limited amount of money.
<p>
   It also puts top Republican officeholders in the precarious
position of having to support Hull without appearing to endorse
her.
<p>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has said he would gladly campaign
with Hull in the general election, but is likely to stay neutral in
a GOP primary.
<p>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., seemed to show support for Patterson at a
recent Arizona Christian Coalition dinner, reportedly telling the
crowd, ``He's one of us.'' But Kyl also is not making any
endorsements.
<p>
   Patterson's challenge is to paint Hull, who has high public
approval ratings and strong editorial support from the state's
leading newspapers, as out of touch with many Arizona Republicans
on key GOP issues.
<p>
   ``I think most of us don't know where she is on the issues of
the day. I'm going to be looking into that myself,'' he said. ``I
think her record is more what we call as a moderate Republican.''
<p>
   Former Maricopa County Supervisor Tom Rawles is also expected to
oppose Hull, as is former TV weatherman Jim Howl.
<p>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., on Saturday is expected to announce
that he will seek re-election, rather than enter the governor's
race.
<p>
   Salmon had been considering a gubernatorial bid, but plans to
seek a third term instead.

   Is it all going wrong? The question is usually asked
tentatively, because no one likes to criticize, even indirectly,
the man in charge: Nelson Mandela, the very embodiment of courage,
honesty, charm and magnanimity, and accordingly one of the few
political heroes of the age.
<p>
   Moreover, the answer is no, it is not all going wrong; in most
respects, South Africa is set on a steady course that gives no
immediate cause for concern.
<p>
   But there is a reason for the question. The commonest anecdote
from South Africa these days is no longer about the good humor and
harmony that have characterized the transition from white to
majority rule, but about robbery, carjacking and violent crime.
<p>
   Whites with skills, and therefore with the ability to make a
living elsewhere, are once more packing their bags, it is said; and
foreign investors are shying away rather than risk their employees'
lives in the country's leafy but violent suburbs.
<p>
   For those inclined to pessimism, conscious that Mandela is
withdrawing from the scene, the fear is that all this presages
South Africa's descent into chaos.
<p>
   The evidence does not entirely bear out the anecdote. Net
foreign direct investment flowed into South Africa pretty evenly in
the three years 1994-96, at a rate of around $330 million annually,
having flowed out in the previous two years.
<p>
   Capital inflows have been higher this year, though much of the
money may be short-term. Emigration statistics are dubious, since
most departures probably go unrecorded.
<p>
   Only the crime figures are unambiguous: South Africa may well
have the highest murder rate in the world  &MD;  61 per 100,000 last
year  &MD;  and in Gauteng, the province encompassing the commercial
capital, Johannesburg, the rate is nearly a third higher than for
the country as a whole.
<p>
   The violence of the townships has now engulfed what used to be
safe white suburbs.
<p>
   The government has been slow to react, but in May it appointed
Meyer Kahn, the no-nonsense head of South African Breweries, who is
popular with blacks and whites alike, to take over the demoralized
and incompetent police force.
<p>
   Hopes are high that he can cut the crime rate, but he will be a
miracle-worker indeed if he can make an impact quickly, and he will
not do it alone.
<p>
   Criminals are organized in South Africa, guns are plentiful and,
among the country's army of unemployed and dispossessed, despair is
often overwhelming.
<p>
   That is why so much rests on the government's economic strategy
of ``growth, employment and redistribution.'' Of these, the most
important is undoubtedly growth. Without growth there will be no
new employment, and little redistribution.
<p>
   And without new employment, and maybe some redistribution, there
will be no fall in crime, for however efficient or ruthless Kahn
may be, crime will remain a problem as long as 20-30 percent of the
labor force is out of work.
<p>
   So how can South Africa get faster growth than the 2 percent or
so likely this year? It cannot afford to risk higher inflation, now
contained below 10 percent. And it does not want another run on the
rand, which fell by over 20 percent last year.
<p>
   Rather it needs higher productivity, freer markets and more
foreign investment, none of which will be easy to achieve in an
economy that is still emerging from years of protection and
sanctions-bound isolation. A few measures, however, would help.
<p>
   One would be to remove the country's remaining exchange
controls. An easing in July produced no wild rush for the exit, as
had been feared, suggesting that the Reserve Bank could now afford
to get rid of virtually all controls and thus lift an incubus from
the capital markets.
<p>
   A second measure would be a speedier and more convincing
privatization program, one, in particular, that placed more
emphasis on a genuine change of ownership than on mere
restructuring.
<p>
   A third step would be to relax labor-market regulations.
Unfortunately, the government has drafted a labor-protection bill
that panders to the trade unions  &MD;  though they do not see it this
way  &MD;  whose struggle against apartheid and influence in the ruling
African National Congress have given them a powerful hand in making
legislation.
<p>
   What is good for those who have jobs, however, may well be bad
for those who do not  &MD;  and it is they, above all others, who should
be uppermost in the government's mind if it is to put to flight the
nagging questions about the way South Africa is going.

economy that is still emerging from years of protection and
sanctions-bound isolation. A few measures, however, would help.
<p>
   One would be to remove the country's remaining exchange
controls. An easing in July produced no wild rush for the exit, as
had been feared, suggesting that the Reserve Bank could now afford
to get rid of virtually all controls and thus lift an incubus from
the capital markets.
<p>
   A second measure would be a speedier and more convincing
privatization program, one, in particular, that placed more
emphasis on a genuine change of ownership than on mere
restructuring.
<p>
   A third step would be to relax labor-market regulations.
Unfortunately, the government has drafted a labor-protection bill
that panders to the trade unions  &MD;  though they do not see it this
way  &MD;  whose struggle against apartheid and influence in the ruling
African National Congress have given them a powerful hand in making
legislation.
<p>
   What is good for those who have jobs, however, may well be bad
for those who do not  &MD;  and it is they, above all others, who should
be uppermost in the government's mind if it is to put to flight the
nagging questions about the way South Africa is going.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Three Manhattan teen-agers seized in the murder of
Nelson Gross acknowledged in videotaped confessions that they
abducted him in a robbery plot and promised to release him once
they had their money, investigators said Thursday. The decision to
kill him was made when it occurred to them that he might identify
one conspirator who had worked in his New Jersey restaurant this
summer, the investigators added.
<p>
   A day after the suspects' arrest and the recovery of the
victim's body in woods beside the Hudson River near the Manhattan
side of the George Washington Bridge, investigators recovered a
bloody rock apparently used to bludgeon Gross, a knife that may
have been used to stab him and, at the home of one suspect, a gun
believed used in the abduction and bloody clothing believed worn by
two of the assailants.
<p>
   The investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
disclosed a wealth of new details in a case that had been shrouded
in mystery for a week after Gross, a 65-year-old millionaire
businessman and former chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party,
vanished from a parking lot at his Edgewater, N.J., restaurant on
Sept. 17.
<p>
   And from relatives, neighbors and acquaintances of the suspects
in Washington Heights, and from law-enforcement and school
authorities, there came portraits of three youths whose lives
appeared to revolve around girls and used cars, days spent mostly
in the streets of a largely Dominican neighborhood, poverty and
frustration at home, poor performances in school and occasional
trouble with the law.
<p>
   As their lawyers declined to comment on investigators'
disclosures, all three suspects were being held without bail for
federal prosecutors in New Jersey, and the case began to emerge as
one of tragic elements: an amateurish robbery suddenly turned
murderous, a man killed for the sake of a couple of used cars, a
motorcycle and gold chains glittering in the eyes of teen-agers.
<p>
   While the case is to be prosecuted by federal officials in New
Jersey, it was local law-enforcement officials in New York who
broke it, arrested the youths and obtained the videotaped
confessions. Federal officials gave way to local authorities, one
investigator said, because the rules for interrogating juveniles
are stricter under federal law, requiring the presence of parents
or guardians.
<p>
   Within hours of Gross' abduction  &MD;  after he drove his silver BMW
at gunpoint to the suspects' upper Manhattan neighborhood, made
calls to see where he might get money fast, then withdrew $20,000
from a bank with a concealed gun at his back  &MD;  he was taken to the
river's edge, bludgeoned with a rock and stabbed repeatedly in the
front and back of his torso, investigators said. His throat was
cut, too, they said, and his hands were slashed as he tried to fend
off blows.
<p>
   Among other things, the investigators quoted the suspects as
saying that only two of them  &MD;  Christian Velez, 17, and Miguel
Grullon, 17  &MD;  participated in the decision to slay Gross and in the
killing itself, while the third, Anthony Estevez, 18, had no direct
role in either.
<p>
   The suspects also were quoted as saying that the conspiracy
began in July, after Velez began working as a busboy at Gross'
restaurant and began talking of robbing ``this rich guy'' in
conversations with Grullon and Estevez, close friends with whom he
had grown up in Washington Heights.
<p>
   But investigators said the assailants did not resolve to carry
out the plot until a day or two before the abduction and did not
carefully plan the crime, which went awry almost immediately. Soon
after, the suspects began wearing expensive jewelry, one bought a
motorcycle and at least one was overheard by a police informer
bragging about killing Gross.

<p>
   Estevez appeared at a hearing before federal magistrate Judge
Ronald Ellis in Manhattan Thursday and, at the request of Assistant
U.S.Attorney John Hillebrecht, was ordered held without bail and
transferred to New Jersey. Estevez, who could face the death
penalty if convicted, hung his head as his family and friends
looked on in tears.
<p>
   Grullon and Velez, because of their status as juveniles,
appeared at a closed hearing before Ellis late Wednesday, and were
held for another hearing on Tuesday on charges that were not
disclosed because of their ages.
<p>
   A complaint filed in U.S. Court in Newark, N.J. Thursday charged
Estevez with kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap, and said that he
and ``others'' who were not identified, in a plot that began in
July, had abducted Gross across a state line ``for the purpose of
obtaining money.'' It added: ``It was further part of this offense
that Nelson Gross' death resulted.''
<p>
   An affidavit by a federal agent said that Gross was seen driving
away from his restaurant with two men of dark complexion about 9:30
a.m. on Sept. 17. After crossing the George Washington Bridge into
Manhattan, it said, Gross called the Bank of New York in Edgewater
to learn his balance, then went to the bank with another man and
tried to withdraw $20,000 in $100 bills.
<p>
   ``After a bank official advised Mr. Gross that the bank could
not provide all $100 bills for the withdrawal, Mr. Gross asked the
male accompanying him whether other denominations were
acceptable,'' the affidavit said. ``Mr. Gross left the bank with
$20,000 in cash.''
<p>
   Investigators said the man with him was Velez, and that he had
kept a hidden gun at Gross' back throughout the transaction. The
gun, which also had been used in the abduction, was not loaded
because the conspirators had no bullets, the suspects told
investigators.
<p>
   Leaving the bank, they headed back to Manhattan, with Gross at
the wheel of his car and Velez and Grullon riding with him, while
Estevez drove a second car that had been used that morning to go to
New Jersey.
<p>
   Investigators quoted the suspects as saying they had promised to
release Gross after getting the money. But as they crossed the
bridge, it occurred to Velez that Gross might be able to identify
him as a former busboy at his restaurant. There were conflicting
reports on whether Velez had been dismissed, had quit or had simply
not gone to work recently.
<p>
   Estevez, in a statement corroborated by another suspect, said he
did not know of the decision to kill Gross and did not participate
in the killing, the investigators said. They said Velez and Grullon
took Gross down into a heavily wooded area by the river just north
of the bridge. There, he was bludgeoned and stabbed to death, they
said, and a medical examiner's report said the decomposed condition
of the body made it likely that he had been killed within hours.
<p>
   Acting on a tip from a drug informer, who said he heard a youth
bragging about killing Gross, the police first arrested Velez, of
371 Wadsworth Ave., and then Grullon and Estevez, both of 600 W.
192nd St., around the corner. Besides giving videotaped statements,
the suspects led the police to Gross' body. A bloody rock was found
nearby.
<p>
   A search of the suspects' homes uncovered none of the stolen
money, which was believed to have been spent on a motorcycle for
Velez, two used cars for the others and various chains and other
jewelry that they began to wear in recent days. But in the basement
of Grullon's building, where his father is the superintendent, the
police found a gun, a knife and two sets of bloody clothes.
<p>
   In interviews Thursday with relatives and acquaintances, as well
as school and law-enforcement officials, the three suspects were
portrayed as troubled youths who fared poorly in school and led
relatively aimless lives, hanging out in the streets, fixing up
cars and getting into trouble from time to time.
<p>
   Several of Velez's neighbors expressed surprise at his arrest,
calling him a quiet youth who lived with an older sister and their
mother. But Juana Deschamps, 50, said that Christian ``made her
life impossible.'' He would stop her in the hallway and make
threatening sounds ``like a tiger,'' she said, adding that two
weeks ago, when she was about to enter her apartment, he blocked
her door and would not let her in.
<p>
   Velez is registered as a ninth grader at George Washington High
School, and while he had an 83 percent attendance record last year,
he has been absent all this year. He was arrested last year for
fare beating and last spring on a charge of selling drugs. He
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was freed on bail.
<p>
   Grullon, an uncle said, was born in the Dominican Republic, came
here with his family when he was 6 or 7 and lived with his parents
and two sisters. He sometimes helped his father with repair work.
``He worked when his father forced him to,'' the uncle said. ``He
wanted things his father could not give him. It was not enough to
have shoes that were $100. He needed to have those that were
$300.''
<p>
   Estevez, called Alex, lives with his mother and several
siblings. His father is dead, a relative said. He was arrested last
year for driving a car with a forged inspection sticker and a
forged insurance card, and in August he was arrested for driving
without a license. After refusing to talk to a reporter, a man who
identified himself as a brother handed a note through a crack in
the door.
<p>
   ``My brother was a good kid,'' it said. ``He never had serious
problems and this is a total mistake.''

   FAIRFIELD, Conn.  &MD;  The principal of an award-winning elementary
school, who was forced to resign in a test-tampering scandal,
acknowledged to investigators that he took standardized tests home
overnight, newly released documents show.
<p>
   But he did not admit that he erased some of the wrong answers
and replaced them with the correct ones, according to a report
compiled for the Fairfield Board of Education by state
investigators.
<p>
   The investigators' report to the board last spring resulted in
the early retirement of the principal, Roger Previs. But the board
had refused to release the report until it was ordered to do so
this week by the state's Freedom of Information Commission.
<p>
   Previs was principal of the Stratfield School for 17 years, and
was popular with parents and students. The school was cited twice
by the federal Department of Education for excellence.
<p>
   But, according to the investigators, Previs said he took copies
of the 1996 Iowa Test of Basic Skills home on the night of Feb. 14,
1996, to ``alphabetize'' them, even though there was no requirement
to do so. According to the report, Previs was the only person at
the school who had full access to all the tests.
<p>
   The report said that even before there was a public
announcement, Previs told other town principals at an
administrators' meeting that he feared investigators were going to
find a lot of erasures on the Connecticut Mastery test as well.
<p>
   After conducting a yearlong investigation, headed by retired
Judge Nicholas Cioffi of Superior Court, that included a former
agent with the FBI and the forensics scientist Henry Lee, the
school board determined that Previs was ``the party responsible''
for tampering with the Iowa skills tests.
<p>
   A separate state investigation, released last year, concluded
that tampering had occurred on the 1993, 1994 and 1995 Connecticut
Mastery Tests, and that Previs was the person most likely
responsible.
<p>
   ``Reasonable and fair people will find the board had adequate
information to support its actions concerning Mr. Previs,'' the
chairman of the school board, John Madeo, said on Thursday.
<p>
   ``The facts speak for themselves,'' Madeo added, ``but this
whole incident is so sad I don't think anybody can feel
vindication.''
<p>
   Howard Klebanoff, a Hartford lawyer who represented Previs,
said: ``We never denied that he took the tests home, but he had a
perfectly valid reason for it, and even though the circumstantial
evidence may be strong, there is still no smoking gun that links
him or anybody else to tampering of those tests.''

   There are two Americas. The one that most Americans care about
is a land of varied beauty and vast distance. Between skyscraping
New York and the surf of the Pacific coast are 3,000 miles of
awesome contrast: prairie, desert, mountains, small towns in the
middle of what seems nowhere.
<p>
   True, few Americans actually have time or inclination to cross
their continent but, through the movie screen and the song lyric (a
generation of baby-boomers can sing along with Mick Jagger and
``Route 66''), all know and love every mile of the almost mythical
journey.
<p>
   It is a self-sufficient America, indifferent to an outside world
that rarely intrudes into the local paper or the television news.
<p>
   Then there is a second America, concentrated in concrete-clad
Washington, D.C. This is the domain of the policy wonks.
<p>
   These people share the concerns of the first America:
restructuring Medicare, improving education, reducing crime, and so
on. But their America is not remote from the outside world; it is
that world's only superpower, and the center of the global economy.
<p>
   For the wonks, foreign policy matters. If only the vote-hungry
politicians on Capitol Hill, ever ready on their electoral
treadmill to appease the first America, would agree.
<p>
   At least Richard Lugar, Indiana's senior Republican senator,
does agree.
<p>
   By birth, he should be as isolationist-inclined as Jesse Helms,
the North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. After all, Indianans  &MD;  ``Hoosiers,'' as they
are peculiarly known  &MD;  are at the heart of the first America, and
Lugar is a fifth-generation Hoosier.
<p>
   In practice, this particular Hoosier was a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford and has been a fervent (some would say relentless)
internationalist ever since. He is the antidote to Helms. No
foreigner can sneer at Lugar as an American parochialist.
<p>
   Yet few of his constituents deride Lugar's internationalism. He
has paid his domestic dues, first as mayor of Indianapolis in the
1960s (his eccentric call for less federal spending got him tagged
as Richard Nixon's favorite mayor) and then as a senator first
elected in 1976.
<p>
   Add a background as a practicing farmer and Lugar has populist
credibility: he can preach the virtues of NATO enlargement, the
dangers of nuclear terrorism and the need to help Africa's economy
and still be handsomely re-elected by Hoosiers who care not a fig
about such matters.
<p>
   The question is whether this is an adequate launching-pad for a
Lugarite foreign policy to take America well into the next century.
<p>
   His word of the moment is ``opportunity,'' by which he means
those lost by his fellow politicians: a president who has allegedly
failed to grasp the challenge of the Cold War's aftermath; a
Congress dominated by an inward-looking radicalism (the Gingrichian
``Contract with America'' barely strays abroad except to propose
that American troops should never be under United Nations command);
and a Senate whose foreign-relations agenda is set by Helms. What
is a Hoosier to do?
<p>
   Keep trying, is the answer. Half of last month's congressional
recess was spent pressing political and policy-wonk flesh in
Germany, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Slovenia, Romania and Bosnia.
<p>
   Back in America it is the familiar recipe of the talk show and
the newspaper column  &MD;  with the added relish of opposing Jesse
Helms's refusal to give the ``liberal'' William Weld a committee
hearing on his now-aborted appointment as ambassador to Mexico.
<p>
   Soon it will be the battle to get ratification of NATO
enlargement by Senate colleagues prone to Helms-ish skepticism, and
then the probable need to keep American troops in Bosnia beyond
next June's deadline.
<p>
   The Lugarite arguments are consistent and long-established.
America, as two world wars should have taught it, has no choice but
to engage with the outside world, and it should do so on terms that
protect its interests.
<p>
   So ``doubly enlarge'' NATO, not just by expanding its membership
but also by adopting new Bosnia-like functions of peacemaking
beyond NATO's borders.
<p>
   Liberalize agriculture (Lugar's 1996 farm bill is phasing out
America's own subsidies). Develop multilateral security structures
for Asia. Accelerate free-trade pacts with Latin America (Lugar was
an early supporter of this, even though many Hoosiers feared their
jobs would be lost to Mexico).
<p>
   Devise a sensibly graduated policy on trade sanctions; not for
Lugar the Helms-Burton measures against allies who invest in Cuba.
The list goes on, and could never have come from Helms.
<p>
   So why is it Helms, not Lugar, who is chairman of the
foreign-policy committee? Because the Senate works by seniority and
Helms joined the Senate four years before Lugar.
<p>
   Although Lugar was foreign-relations chairman in the mid-1980s,
when he was instrumental in getting Ferdinand Marcos to hand the
Philippines over to Corazon Aquino's democrats, now Helms makes him
play second fiddle; he chairs the agriculture committee instead.
<p>
   But Lugar is a distance runner (last week he ran in two
five-kilometer races) and at 65 is still fit enough to let others
dream on his behalf.
<p>
   Of course there have been disappointments: George Bush did not
choose him as vice-president, and his campaign for the 1996
presidential nomination was a damp squib. But perhaps history will
move his way.
<p>
   It is true that the first America knows little of the outside
world, but the opinion polls that reveal American ignorance also
underline a consistent support for an ``active'' American role in
world affairs. And in any case, as the second America knows full
well, an inactive role is economically and politically impossible.
<p>
   In the meantime, look forward to 2000. Lugar will be re-elected
to the Senate; there will be a new president, in command of the
middle ground; radicalism and reaction may both be out of fashion;
and Helms will be almost 80.
<p>
   Perhaps Lugar will step forward as the new secretary of state
(for a Democratic president as eagerly as for a Republican);
perhaps he will again be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Certainly he will be Washington's elder statesman on
foreign policy. And America's allies will be the happier for it.

   The question is whether this is an adequate launching-pad for a
Lugarite foreign policy to take America well into the next century.
<p>
   His word of the moment is ``opportunity,'' by which he means
those lost by his fellow politicians: a president who has allegedly
failed to grasp the challenge of the Cold War's aftermath; a
Congress dominated by an inward-looking radicalism (the Gingrichian
``Contract with America'' barely strays abroad except to propose
that American troops should never be under United Nations command);
and a Senate whose foreign-relations agenda is set by Helms. What
is a Hoosier to do?
<p>
   Keep trying, is the answer. Half of last month's congressional
recess was spent pressing political and policy-wonk flesh in
Germany, Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Slovenia, Romania and Bosnia.
<p>
   Back in America it is the familiar recipe of the talk show and
the newspaper column  &MD;  with the added relish of opposing Jesse
Helms's refusal to give the ``liberal'' William Weld a committee
hearing on his now-aborted appointment as ambassador to Mexico.
<p>
   Soon it will be the battle to get ratification of NATO
enlargement by Senate colleagues prone to Helms-ish skepticism, and
then the probable need to keep American troops in Bosnia beyond
next June's deadline.
<p>
   The Lugarite arguments are consistent and long-established.
America, as two world wars should have taught it, has no choice but
to engage with the outside world, and it should do so on terms that
protect its interests.
<p>
   So ``doubly enlarge'' NATO, not just by expanding its membership
but also by adopting new Bosnia-like functions of peacemaking
beyond NATO's borders.
<p>
   Liberalize agriculture (Lugar's 1996 farm bill is phasing out
America's own subsidies). Develop multilateral security structures
for Asia. Accelerate free-trade pacts with Latin America (Lugar was
an early supporter of this, even though many Hoosiers feared their
jobs would be lost to Mexico).
<p>
   Devise a sensibly graduated policy on trade sanctions; not for
Lugar the Helms-Burton measures against allies who invest in Cuba.
The list goes on, and could never have come from Helms.
<p>
   So why is it Helms, not Lugar, who is chairman of the
foreign-policy committee? Because the Senate works by seniority and
Helms joined the Senate four years before Lugar.
<p>
   Although Lugar was foreign-relations chairman in the mid-1980s,
when he was instrumental in getting Ferdinand Marcos to hand the
Philippines over to Corazon Aquino's democrats, now Helms makes him
play second fiddle; he chairs the agriculture committee instead.
<p>
   But Lugar is a distance runner (last week he ran in two
five-kilometer races) and at 65 is still fit enough to let others
dream on his behalf.
<p>
   Of course there have been disappointments: George Bush did not
choose him as vice-president, and his campaign for the 1996
presidential nomination was a damp squib. But perhaps history will
move his way.
<p>
   It is true that the first America knows little of the outside
world, but the opinion polls that reveal American ignorance also
underline a consistent support for an ``active'' American role in
world affairs. And in any case, as the second America knows full
well, an inactive role is economically and politically impossible.
<p>
   In the meantime, look forward to 2000. Lugar will be re-elected
to the Senate; there will be a new president, in command of the
middle ground; radicalism and reaction may both be out of fashion;
and Helms will be almost 80.
<p>
   Perhaps Lugar will step forward as the new secretary of state
(for a Democratic president as eagerly as for a Republican);
perhaps he will again be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Certainly he will be Washington's elder statesman on
foreign policy. And America's allies will be the happier for it.

   ASHLAND, OREGON  &MD;  Plenty of people try to change the world by
force. John Francis, son of an electric-lineman from Philadelphia,
hopes to change it by force of example.
<p>
   With his undersized banjo and a big smile, Francis's only
ambition is to walk the planet to preach peace, concern for the
environment and respect for the rights of man.
<p>
   Should Al Gore win the presidency in 2000, Francis  &MD;  already a
promoter of some of the vice-president's favorite schemes  &MD;  might
even be in line for something more official.
<p>
   His rovings have required some extraordinary sacrifices. In
order to make himself listen to people, he stopped talking for 18
years; in order to make himself walk, he stopped riding in cars or
buses for 17 years.
<p>
   During that time he walked across America, earned three degrees,
and worked for the United States Coast Guard, rewriting America's
oil-spill regulations after the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1990.
<p>
   Why? Because he had witnessed an oil spill under the Golden Gate
in the early 1970s, and had decided he was going to do something
about such things.
<p>
   Support for Francis's nonprofit organization, Planetwalk, has
come from several American and European companies. Timberland gave
him shoes and clothes; Apple Computer, a Powerbook; Agfa, film for
his camera.
<p>
   One of his most important gadgets is a small satellite
transmitter provided by Service Argos, a French-American company,
from which he can send out emergency messages when he gets trapped
in the wild.
<p>
   He is now preaching Al Gore's environmental ideas through
schools involved in the GLOBE program. (GLOBE  &MD;  Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment  &MD;  is one of those schemes
the vice-president used to be famous for, before he became better
known for telephone solicitations for campaign money.)
<p>
   Students at 4,000 GLOBE-affiliated schools, in 58 places ranging
from the Marshall Islands to Uruguay, take measurements of changes
in the water, soil and atmosphere for use in scientific research.
<p>
   Francis says his main job, however, is just walking and talking
for the environment. When he arrives in a village or town, he tells
the locals what he's doing.
<p>
   ``I tell them I've walked from the United States just to talk to
them. Then I play this song about the Walker.''
<p>
   In larger communities, he talks to officials and teachers and
others who might be interested in joining the GLOBE program.
<p>
   He also works as a goodwill ambassador for the environmental
programs of the United Nations; and, in an unofficial way, but one
that seems to be appreciated in Washington, as a goodwill
ambassador for the United States.
<p>
   In the past year Francis has been walking (sailing, when he can)
through the Caribbean and South America, from community to
community, school to school, promoting GLOBE and his brand of
environmental consciousness.
<p>
   As he has travelled around the world, his own definition of the
environment has changed.
<p>
   ``It ceased being just trees and clean air and water,'' he says.
``Now, environment includes economic equity and economic justice
and human-rights issues. We need to consider how we treat each
other.'' He will stay a busy man.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  For visitors accustomed to the old New York  &MD;  that
grey, hostile, no-can-do city of sweltering summers and wild
winters  &MD;  the Big Apple must now seem a strange place.
<p>
   The city is awash with new superstores, some of them (such as
NikeTown) temples to a single brand, others (such as Crate &AMP;
Barrel) selling ready-made lifestyles.
<p>
   Parts of Manhattan's shabby-chic Upper West Side are starting to
look like a remake of Fifth Avenue. Old buildings are being
refurbished; even the streets seem to have fewer potholes.
<p>
   And New Yorkers, heaven forbid, seem happier. As rude and rushed
as ever, but definitely more cheerful.
<p>
   If this new mood has an epicenter, it is to be found at City
Hall: more precisely, at the desk of Rudolph Giuliani, the
semi-detached Republican who is the city's 107th mayor.
<p>
   Up for re-election this November, Giuliani is all but certain of
victory. Ruth Messinger, his Democratic opponent, is proving a
remarkably inept rival; few New Yorkers know or care what she
stands for.
<p>
   And Giuliani, for his part, appears to have convinced voters
that he is singlehandedly responsible for New York's apparent
renaissance.
<p>
   Unless he starts assaulting voters outside City Hall, New
Yorkers seem set for four more years of their first Republican
mayor since John Lindsay held office in the 1960s.
<p>
   There is no question that Giuliani has raised the quality of
life in New York. He has cleaned up Times Square, shut down sex
shops, and instigated a host of other little improvements.
<p>
   But quiz city-dwellers on the most significant changes wrought
by Giuliani, and they will home in on two: falling crime and the
booming economy.
<p>
   Yet the extent to which these are the result of Giuliani's
mayoral skills is debatable.
<p>
   Take crime. Since he took office in January 1994, crime in New
York has fallen by more than 40 percent; last year the murder rate
was at its lowest since the 1960s.
<p>
   And Giuliani, clearly, should get some of the praise: it was he
who in 1994 appointed William Bratton as the city's police
commissioner  &MD;  and it was Bratton who pioneered the innovative
crime-fighting system that helped to turn the tide.
<p>
   But Giuliani's wisdom in picking Bratton was compounded by lucky
timing. The mayor's predecessor, David Dinkins, had increased the
size of New York's police force; the city's crack wars were dying
out as Giuliani took office; and changing demographics have reduced
crime, too.
<p>
   Moreover, once it became clear that Bratton  &MD;  rightly  &MD;  was
getting most of the credit for the city's falling crime rate, the
mayor ousted him.
<p>
   Although Howard Safir, who replaced Bratton, has cut crime
further by sticking to his predecessor's rule-book, he has failed
to arrest a rise in allegations of police brutality, which have
soared by more than 50 percent since Giuliani took office.
<p>
   The mayor's role in New York's apparent economic revival is not
all it seems, either.
<p>
   Since taking office, Giuliani has done little to change the ways
of an economy that has long been overtaxed (the city's income taxes
are America's steepest) and underachieving.
<p>
   Indeed, the mayor has done nothing more than trim the city's
absurdly high hotel taxes; abolish or reduce some commercial rent
taxes; cut a few property taxes; and tinker with a sales tax on
clothes.
<p>
   In every other respect  &MD;  from capital-gains tax to corporate
taxation  &MD;  New York is still one of the highest-taxed cities in
America.
<p>
   So far, Wall Street has more than made up for the mayor's fiscal
timidity. Since his term began, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index has
doubled; this year Wall Street's profits are expected to hit $8
billion.
<p>
   Such wealth is producing a huge tax windfall for the Big Apple,
just when big investment-bank bonuses are helping to pay for a
retailing revival.
<p>
   Thanks to Wall Street, New York celebrated the June 30 end of
fiscal 1997 with a $1.3 billion budget surplus  &MD;  a stark contrast
to the vast deficits Giuliani had struggled with during his first
three years in office. The city confidently forecasts another
surplus for the current fiscal year.
<p>
   But New York's bigger dependence on Wall Street has its
drawbacks  &MD;  not least Giuliani's fear that the markets may
celebrate the tenth anniversary of 1987's crash in October with a
repeat performance.
<p>
   Awash with stock market dollars, the mayor has failed to address
the city's underlying ``structural deficits,'' a result of decades
of overspending.
<p>
   Wall Street windfall notwithstanding, these may yet open up
multi-billion-dollar budget gaps well into the next century.
<p>
   And because the city channelled part of its current surplus into
its ambitious capital-spending program, New York will continue to
spend a fifth of its tax revenues on debt service. This cuts its
ability to pay for essential services.
<p>
   Nor has Wall Street's prolonged good fortune helped New York's
overall job market. The city's unemployment rate is a troubling 9.5
percent, almost twice the national figure.
<p>
   Carl McCall, New York's (Democratic) state comptroller,
estimates that the city's labor force is growing at three times the
national rate; employment, however, is increasing at half the
national rate. This imbalance is likely to put extra pressure on
New York's welfare rolls.
<p>
   Giuliani brags that the number of New Yorkers on public
assistance has fallen sharply during his tenure. But this is only
part of the story.
<p>
   Although 24 percent fewer city dwellers than in 1994 now receive
public assistance, their number is still higher than in the first
year of Dinkins's term. And the ranks of New Yorkers on Social
Security have continued to swell.
<p>
   It is the poor, inevitably, who have fared worst under Giuliani.
Since he took office, calculates New York's Coalition for the
Homeless, the number of single people taking refuge in city
shelters has climbed sharply.
<p>
   The number of families in shelters, by contrast, has fallen,
largely because new rules make it far harder for them to prove
their plight.
<p>
   Estimating the true extent of homelessness in New York is
difficult, but on one measure  &MD;  the number of people receiving
meals from soup kitchens or food pantries  &MD;  the situation has
deteriorated markedly.
<p>
   Three years ago such charities fed some 360,000 people a month;
this year they will cater for a projected 650,000.
<p>
   Such negative statistics  &MD;  along with those showing that child
abuse is increasing, that waiting lists for day-care are
lengthening, and that city educational standards remain stubbornly
below the national average  &MD;  are angrily dismissed by Giuliani.
<p>
   Indeed, when the mayor presented his twice-yearly Management
Report this month, only one of the 60 or so charts he flourished
hinted at the numerous failings the report uncovered.
<p>
   His tone was set by the claim, worthy of any decent Stalinist
statistician, that all 59 of New York's sanitation districts have
now achieved the highest cleanliness rating, up from only 27 the
previous year.
<p>
   The mayor's re-election plan is simple: if it is good news,
embrace it and claim the credit; if it is bad news, ignore it and
ridicule anybody who dares mention it.
<p>
   To the chagrin of Giuliani's many detractors, that will
undoubtedly get him re-elected.

   And Giuliani, for his part, appears to have convinced voters
that he is singlehandedly responsible for New York's apparent
renaissance.
<p>
   Unless he starts assaulting voters outside City Hall, New
Yorkers seem set for four more years of their first Republican
mayor since John Lindsay held office in the 1960s.
<p>
   There is no question that Giuliani has raised the quality of
life in New York. He has cleaned up Times Square, shut down sex
shops, and instigated a host of other little improvements.
<p>
   But quiz city-dwellers on the most significant changes wrought
by Giuliani, and they will home in on two: falling crime and the
booming economy.
<p>
   Yet the extent to which these are the result of Giuliani's
mayoral skills is debatable.
<p>
   Take crime. Since he took office in January 1994, crime in New
York has fallen by more than 40 percent; last year the murder rate
was at its lowest since the 1960s.
<p>
   And Giuliani, clearly, should get some of the praise: it was he
who in 1994 appointed William Bratton as the city's police
commissioner  &MD;  and it was Bratton who pioneered the innovative
crime-fighting system that helped to turn the tide.
<p>
   But Giuliani's wisdom in picking Bratton was compounded by lucky
timing. The mayor's predecessor, David Dinkins, had increased the
size of New York's police force; the city's crack wars were dying
out as Giuliani took office; and changing demographics have reduced
crime, too.
<p>
   Moreover, once it became clear that Bratton  &MD;  rightly  &MD;  was
getting most of the credit for the city's falling crime rate, the
mayor ousted him.
<p>
   Although Howard Safir, who replaced Bratton, has cut crime
further by sticking to his predecessor's rule-book, he has failed
to arrest a rise in allegations of police brutality, which have
soared by more than 50 percent since Giuliani took office.
<p>
   The mayor's role in New York's apparent economic revival is not
all it seems, either.
<p>
   Since taking office, Giuliani has done little to change the ways
of an economy that has long been overtaxed (the city's income taxes
are America's steepest) and underachieving.
<p>
   Indeed, the mayor has done nothing more than trim the city's
absurdly high hotel taxes; abolish or reduce some commercial rent
taxes; cut a few property taxes; and tinker with a sales tax on
clothes.
<p>
   In every other respect  &MD;  from capital-gains tax to corporate
taxation  &MD;  New York is still one of the highest-taxed cities in
America.
<p>
   So far, Wall Street has more than made up for the mayor's fiscal
timidity. Since his term began, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index has
doubled; this year Wall Street's profits are expected to hit $8
billion.
<p>
   Such wealth is producing a huge tax windfall for the Big Apple,
just when big investment-bank bonuses are helping to pay for a
retailing revival.
<p>
   Thanks to Wall Street, New York celebrated the June 30 end of
fiscal 1997 with a $1.3 billion budget surplus  &MD;  a stark contrast
to the vast deficits Giuliani had struggled with during his first
three years in office. The city confidently forecasts another
surplus for the current fiscal year.
<p>
   But New York's bigger dependence on Wall Street has its
drawbacks  &MD;  not least Giuliani's fear that the markets may
celebrate the tenth anniversary of 1987's crash in October with a
repeat performance.
<p>
   Awash with stock market dollars, the mayor has failed to address
the city's underlying ``structural deficits,'' a result of decades
of overspending.
<p>
   Wall Street windfall notwithstanding, these may yet open up
multi-billion-dollar budget gaps well into the next century.
<p>
   And because the city channelled part of its current surplus into
its ambitious capital-spending program, New York will continue to
spend a fifth of its tax revenues on debt service. This cuts its
ability to pay for essential services.
<p>
   Nor has Wall Street's prolonged good fortune helped New York's
overall job market. The city's unemployment rate is a troubling 9.5
percent, almost twice the national figure.
<p>
   Carl McCall, New York's (Democratic) state comptroller,
estimates that the city's labor force is growing at three times the
national rate; employment, however, is increasing at half the
national rate. This imbalance is likely to put extra pressure on
New York's welfare rolls.
<p>
   Giuliani brags that the number of New Yorkers on public
assistance has fallen sharply during his tenure. But this is only
part of the story.
<p>
   Although 24 percent fewer city dwellers than in 1994 now receive
public assistance, their number is still higher than in the first
year of Dinkins's term. And the ranks of New Yorkers on Social
Security have continued to swell.
<p>
   It is the poor, inevitably, who have fared worst under Giuliani.
Since he took office, calculates New York's Coalition for the
Homeless, the number of single people taking refuge in city
shelters has climbed sharply.
<p>
   The number of families in shelters, by contrast, has fallen,
largely because new rules make it far harder for them to prove
their plight.
<p>
   Estimating the true extent of homelessness in New York is
difficult, but on one measure  &MD;  the number of people receiving
meals from soup kitchens or food pantries  &MD;  the situation has
deteriorated markedly.
<p>
   Three years ago such charities fed some 360,000 people a month;
this year they will cater for a projected 650,000.
<p>
   Such negative statistics  &MD;  along with those showing that child
abuse is increasing, that waiting lists for day-care are
lengthening, and that city educational standards remain stubbornly
below the national average  &MD;  are angrily dismissed by Giuliani.
<p>
   Indeed, when the mayor presented his twice-yearly Management
Report this month, only one of the 60 or so charts he flourished
hinted at the numerous failings the report uncovered.
<p>
   His tone was set by the claim, worthy of any decent Stalinist
statistician, that all 59 of New York's sanitation districts have
now achieved the highest cleanliness rating, up from only 27 the
previous year.
<p>
   The mayor's re-election plan is simple: if it is good news,
embrace it and claim the credit; if it is bad news, ignore it and
ridicule anybody who dares mention it.
<p>
   To the chagrin of Giuliani's many detractors, that will
undoubtedly get him re-elected.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Superman, who doubled as a journalist, regularly
saved the world. Ted Turner, founder of Cable News Network (CNN),
futuristic mediaman and seeker after a place in history, has now
tried to match him, offering the humbly grateful and impecunious
United Nations a gift of $1 billion.
<p>
   He has also declared his faith in its future. The world's
diplomats are giddy with disbelief.
<p>
   Yet in an age when altruism gets a thorough body search,
Turner's announcement in New York on Sept. 18 has sparked a search
for a secret motive.
<p>
   How long before U.N. treaties are signed on CNN-headed paper, or
U.N. peacekeepers wear ``Sponsored by CNN'' T-shirts, ask the
cynical?
<p>
   The gift might well give CNN an extra edge over its rivals when
covering U.N. stories. It already finds it easier to gain access to
countries like Iraq, North Korea and Cuba than other television
companies and most diplomats.
<p>
   Turner has made clear that the money is not for propping up the
bureaucracy at the U.N. in New York, nor is it a comment on the
unpaid dues of the United States. That is a matter between Kofi
Annan, the secretary-general, and the American government, says
Turner.
<p>
   His chosen causes are children, land mines and refugees. Put in
that context, $100 million a year is less than world-saving.
<p>
   This year the U.N. wants $160 million for land-mine research and
clearance. Childrens' programs cost UNICEF some $900 million a year
and refugees cost about $1.2 billion a year.
<p>
   Nor is it yet clear how the money will be given. Turner is
currently worth about $3.2 billion, derived from an 11 percent
holding in Time Warner, the company that bought his business,
Turner Broadcasting Systems, in 1996. This earns him about $20
million a year.
<p>
   If Time Warner's value stays unchanged, he will have to give the
U.N. about 2.7 percent of his stake every year to meet his pledge
to spread the gift over ten years.
<p>
   But Turner wants to retain his influence in Time Warner, so he
is now talking of putting the shares into a foundation and
borrowing against them for the donation.
<p>
   If the share price keeps rising  &MD;  it leapt 37 percent in late
August  &MD;  he will be able to honor his pledge while giving away less
and less of his holding. But if he borrowed and then sold shares to
repay the loan, he would be liable for tax.
<p>
   If Turner puts the shares into a foundation, he can retain the
voting rights, but would have to let the U.N. get the benefit of
any rise in share value.
<p>
   And if he tries to hand over $100 million out of income, he
could also be liable for tax, though one report suggests he might
even gain from tax write-offs.
<p>
   Saving the world can be fiddly and tedious. Tax lawyers are
having a field day.

<p>
   Sir Isaiah Berlin once made a famous distinction between two
types of mind: the hedgehog, which knows one big thing, and the
fox, which knows lots of little ones.
<p>
   Although he was referring to the difference between thinkers who
get fixated on one big idea (Marx or Hegel) and those who have lots
of little ideas (Aristotle or Goethe), he could have been writing
about the business world.
<p>
   Richard Branson has hopped from records to airlines to soft
drinks to insurance. Wayne Huizenga made fortunes in waste
management and video-rentals before moving on to the used-car
market.
<p>
   Others, such as Wal-Mart's Sam Walton or Oracle's Larry Ellison,
resolutely follow a single path.
<p>
   Eli Broad has all the appearances of a fox. His vulpine cunning
is evident in everything he does, from becoming one of the
luminaries of Los Angeles' high society to accumulating one of the
world's best collections of modern art.
<p>
   Broad's slyness was on display in 1994 when he bought a painting
by Roy Lichtenstein for $2.5 million with his American Express
card, earning 2.5 million frequent-flier miles.
<p>
   Appearances notwithstanding, Broad has made his career,
hedgehog-like, out of one big insight: that the huge postwar
baby-boom generation would create a surge in demand for the
essentials of middle-class life.
<p>
   As a young accountant in Detroit in the early 1950s, he noticed
the rising tide of people moving to the suburbs to raise their
young families.
<p>
   In 1954, aged 20, he sold his wedding presents to buy a parcel
of land in the Detroit suburbs; three years later he teamed up with
Donald Kaufman to found a company specializing in cheap housing for
first-time buyers.
<p>
   Kaufman and Broad's first batch of houses was snapped up in a
weekend. The firm rapidly grew into one of the biggest
house-builders in the country.
<p>
   At the end of the 1980s, after Broad had spent a while in the
savings and loan business, he took his insight a stage further.
<p>
   He notes that the average American household now saves a mere 5
percent of its disposable income, compared with over 13 percent in
France or Italy.
<p>
   There is a growing army of 45-64 year-olds who wake up every
morning to headlines about the near-bankruptcy of the Social
Security fund and dubious company pension schemes, and then look at
their paltry savings accounts with a shudder.
<p>
   This group already contains a fifth of the American population,
and is expected to grow to over a quarter of the population by
2010, preparing for a surge in the number of retired Americans.
<p>
   The chosen vehicle for Broad's new venture was Sun Life
Insurance, a venerable insurance company he had brought in 1971 as
a cushion against a downturn in housing.
<p>
   Broad sold Kaufman and Broad in 1989, leaving Sun Life Insurance
a pure financial-services company. He also dedicated the renamed
SunAmerica to the retirement market, selling its other insurance
businesses.
<p>
   Insurance used to be built on people's fear of dying young and
unfulfilled: Broad wanted to build it on their fear of dying old
and poor.
<p>
   Broad's relentless pursuit of the baby-boom market has turned
SunAmerica into one of the best performers on the stock market.
<p>
   During the 1990s the company's market value has grown from $184
million to $8 billion. Its earnings per share have grown by an
average of 34 percent a year  &MD;  a rate that would impress that other
hedgehog, Bill Gates.
<p>
   And yet demography is hardly a trade secret. Other insurance
companies and discounters were attracted to the retirement market,
and made plenty of money there.
<p>
   At this point, foxy-ideas men usually move on to their next
project. But if you are a hedgehog-idea man how can you protect
yourself against mimicry?
<p>
   What makes Broad exceptional is his ability to pursue his idea
further than any imitator.
<p>
   Almost everything about SunAmerica is geared to the pensions
market. Much of Broad's attention has been lavished on SunAmerica's
distribution.
<p>
   The traditional salaried sales force has gone. It has been
replaced partly by alliances with prestigious banks and insurance
agents and partly by a team of financial planners.
<p>
   Unusually in insurance, these planners are free to sell
financial products from other firms, even though they are
indirectly employed by SunAmerica  &MD;  vital, in Broad's opinion, to
establishing trust with suspicious baby-boomers.
<p>
   Broad is also striving to lodge his brand in baby-boomers'
minds. The company put its name and catchphrase (``the retirement
specialist'') on television 700 times in the year to this July,
more than doubling its television exposure compared with 1996.
<p>
   And he tries to flatter baby-boomers  &MD;  always a cocksure lot  &MD; 
by giving them more control over their investments.
<p>
   SunAmerica's ``Polaris'' has jumped in the past two years from
being the 25th to the fifth most popular American variable annuity.
<p>
   It gives investors a choice of 22 investment funds and allows
them to switch money between funds up to 12 times a year without
being taxed or penalized.
<p>
   In that sense, Broad serves a warning to those who think that
one idea is enough. SunAmerica would soon have dimmed if Broad had
lacked ideas about the nitty gritty of the business built on his
insight.
<p>
   Good distribution and a strong brand both make it harder for
would-be competitors of SunAmerica. So does his hedgehog-like
obsession with his firm's share price.
<p>
   In a world once dominated by salary men, this entrepreneur sees
the stock market as guarantee of focus and flexibility.
<p>
   So far 50 employees own stock and options worth $1 million or
more. Here, at least, is one group of Americans who need not worry
about retirement.

drinks to insurance. Wayne Huizenga made fortunes in waste
management and video-rentals before moving on to the used-car
market.
<p>
   Others, such as Wal-Mart's Sam Walton or Oracle's Larry Ellison,
resolutely follow a single path.
<p>
   Eli Broad has all the appearances of a fox. His vulpine cunning
is evident in everything he does, from becoming one of the
luminaries of Los Angeles' high society to accumulating one of the
world's best collections of modern art.
<p>
   Broad's slyness was on display in 1994 when he bought a painting
by Roy Lichtenstein for $2.5 million with his American Express
card, earning 2.5 million frequent-flier miles.
<p>
   Appearances notwithstanding, Broad has made his career,
hedgehog-like, out of one big insight: that the huge postwar
baby-boom generation would create a surge in demand for the
essentials of middle-class life.
<p>
   As a young accountant in Detroit in the early 1950s, he noticed
the rising tide of people moving to the suburbs to raise their
young families.
<p>
   In 1954, aged 20, he sold his wedding presents to buy a parcel
of land in the Detroit suburbs; three years later he teamed up with
Donald Kaufman to found a company specializing in cheap housing for
first-time buyers.
<p>
   Kaufman and Broad's first batch of houses was snapped up in a
weekend. The firm rapidly grew into one of the biggest
house-builders in the country.
<p>
   At the end of the 1980s, after Broad had spent a while in the
savings and loan business, he took his insight a stage further.
<p>
   He notes that the average American household now saves a mere 5
percent of its disposable income, compared with over 13 percent in
France or Italy.
<p>
   There is a growing army of 45-64 year-olds who wake up every
morning to headlines about the near-bankruptcy of the Social
Security fund and dubious company pension schemes, and then look at
their paltry savings accounts with a shudder.
<p>
   This group already contains a fifth of the American population,
and is expected to grow to over a quarter of the population by
2010, preparing for a surge in the number of retired Americans.
<p>
   The chosen vehicle for Broad's new venture was Sun Life
Insurance, a venerable insurance company he had brought in 1971 as
a cushion against a downturn in housing.
<p>
   Broad sold Kaufman and Broad in 1989, leaving Sun Life Insurance
a pure financial-services company. He also dedicated the renamed
SunAmerica to the retirement market, selling its other insurance
businesses.
<p>
   Insurance used to be built on people's fear of dying young and
unfulfilled: Broad wanted to build it on their fear of dying old
and poor.
<p>
   Broad's relentless pursuit of the baby-boom market has turned
SunAmerica into one of the best performers on the stock market.
<p>
   During the 1990s the company's market value has grown from $184
million to $8 billion. Its earnings per share have grown by an
average of 34 percent a year  &MD;  a rate that would impress that other
hedgehog, Bill Gates.
<p>
   And yet demography is hardly a trade secret. Other insurance
companies and discounters were attracted to the retirement market,
and made plenty of money there.
<p>
   At this point, foxy-ideas men usually move on to their next
project. But if you are a hedgehog-idea man how can you protect
yourself against mimicry?
<p>
   What makes Broad exceptional is his ability to pursue his idea
further than any imitator.
<p>
   Almost everything about SunAmerica is geared to the pensions
market. Much of Broad's attention has been lavished on SunAmerica's
distribution.
<p>
   The traditional salaried sales force has gone. It has been
replaced partly by alliances with prestigious banks and insurance
agents and partly by a team of financial planners.
<p>
   Unusually in insurance, these planners are free to sell
financial products from other firms, even though they are
indirectly employed by SunAmerica  &MD;  vital, in Broad's opinion, to
establishing trust with suspicious baby-boomers.
<p>
   Broad is also striving to lodge his brand in baby-boomers'
minds. The company put its name and catchphrase (``the retirement
specialist'') on television 700 times in the year to this July,
more than doubling its television exposure compared with 1996.
<p>
   And he tries to flatter baby-boomers  &MD;  always a cocksure lot  &MD; 
by giving them more control over their investments.
<p>
   SunAmerica's ``Polaris'' has jumped in the past two years from
being the 25th to the fifth most popular American variable annuity.
<p>
   It gives investors a choice of 22 investment funds and allows
them to switch money between funds up to 12 times a year without
being taxed or penalized.
<p>
   In that sense, Broad serves a warning to those who think that
one idea is enough. SunAmerica would soon have dimmed if Broad had
lacked ideas about the nitty gritty of the business built on his
insight.
<p>
   Good distribution and a strong brand both make it harder for
would-be competitors of SunAmerica. So does his hedgehog-like
obsession with his firm's share price.
<p>
   In a world once dominated by salary men, this entrepreneur sees
the stock market as guarantee of focus and flexibility.
<p>
   So far 50 employees own stock and options worth $1 million or
more. Here, at least, is one group of Americans who need not worry
about retirement.

   Sir Isaiah Berlin once made a famous distinction between two
types of mind: the hedgehog, which knows one big thing, and the
fox, which knows lots of little ones.

<p>
   PHOENIX - The mystery of Keith Tkachuk's status with the Phoenix
Coyotes seems about to unfold.
<p>
   With the season opener just five days away, the Coyotes must
choose between two alternatives:
<p>
    &MD; Either back away from statements made last week that Tkachuk is
not playing in any preseason games at the team's suggestion while a
contract extension is worked out for the team captain and star left
wing.
<p>
    &MD; Or be prepared to suspend the NHL's reigning goal-scoring
leader if he is not in uniform Wednesday night against the Chicago
Blackhawks.
<p>
   Tkachuk, 25, who has been practicing with the club daily but
hasn't appeared in any of the Coyotes' first eight preseason games,
still won't say if he plans to be in the lineup.
<p>
   ``Like I said before, we'll cross that bridge when we come to
it,'' he said before workouts Thursday morning at America West
Arena. ``We'll see what happens Wednesday.''
<p>
   General Manager Bobby Smith has said he expects Tkachuk to honor
his contract, with or without an extension. But he will have no
other alternative but to fine or possibly suspend Tkachuk should he
refuse to play once the season starts.
<p>
   ``We'd just like to get this thing settled,'' Smith said
Wednesday, reporting no new progress in the contract talks.
<p>
   Tkachuk, who scored 52 goals last season, reported to training
camp Sept. 10 amid speculation he was unhappy with his contract,
which has three years remaining.
<p>
   He is scheduled to earn about $2.6 million per season over the
final three years, well under the skyrocketing salaries of several
other top NHL players.
<p>
   Last week, Smith met privately with Tkachuk. A day later, Smith
said it was the club's decision that ``for Keith's best
interests,'' he would not play in the preseason during contract
negotiations.
<p>
   ``I don't want this to be a distraction,'' Tkachuk said
Thursday. ``I want to get something done, I want to play, and I
want to help this team. But a guy's got to do what's best for
himself.''
<p>
   Asked if he feels the team is doing everything in its power to
get a contract extension in place, Tkachuk replied, ``I don't know.
I hope so. If it isn't, I know where I stand in this organization.
I hope they want me here.''

<p>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 26:
<p>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's re-election campaign kicked into a
higher gear this week, then swiftly started skidding downhill.
Giuliani unveiled his first negative television ad, which turned
out to be inaccurate. Facts also emerged about his recent appointee
to New York City's Campaign Finance Board that made the mayor's
choice seem more and more unsuitable.
<p>
   Both issues are questions of tone. Giuliani's aggressive
temperament has often served the city well, but not when it is
directed against inappropriate targets, like the Campaign Finance
Board, or served up in such an overdose that it appears unfair. The
mayor's support on Thursday of a Board of Education decision to bar
media coverage of Ruth Messinger teaching in a Queens public
school, even though Giuliani has often been filmed on such
assignments himself, reflected this mean-spiritedness.
<p>
   The new Giuliani commercial attacks Messinger, his Democratic
opponent, for her failure to support the mayor's popular initiative
to curtail sex shops. It gives prominent position to what appears
to be a direct quote from Messinger: ``Sex businesses give New York
character.'' The quote actually came from a television news anchor,
who was characterizing Messinger's position in an informal
conversation. Giuliani, who has very strong feelings about being
quoted accurately himself, contends that any criticism is the work
of ``people who like to create phony issues.''
<p>
   Messinger did oppose Giuliani's drive to limit sex
establishments, pushing for a plan of her own that was more
complicated and had no real chance of becoming law. One of her
positions was that sex shops were ``an integral part'' of the
fabric of Greenwich Village's gay community. But by pushing his
criticism into inaccuracy, and then refusing to acknowledge the
error, Giuliani diverted attention from the ad's legitimate points.
This was exactly the same mistake Messinger made earlier in her ad
criticizing the mayor's record on education. She, at least, could
have claimed to be at the beginning of the learning curve.
<p>
   Giuliani's relations with the Campaign Finance Board are a more
serious long-term concern. The board is a small, quasi-independent
agency that administers the city's laws limiting campaign
contributions and providing matching funds to candidates who play
by the rules. During his days as a candidate, Giuliani was one of
its staunchest champions. Now that he is an incumbent and privy to
large donations from businesses who have financial connections to
the city, his attitude seems to be changing.
<p>
   The board recently cracked down on the Giuliani campaign's
attempt to find a loophole in the law's $7,700-per-donation limit.
Just as the board was about to assess penalties, Joseph Erazo, the
mayor's new nominee to the board, arrived unannounced and attempted
to join in the vote. Since the other members were not aware that
Erazo's appointment was final, and since he had not participated in
any discussions, he was rightfully barred from voting.
<p>
   Erazo's sudden appearance created the impression of an attempt
by the Giuliani administration to influence the board's decision,
even if that was not the intention. This week, critics of the
appointment got more ammunition. Published reports, which Erazo has
not contradicted, said he appeared at a pro-Giuliani press
conference early this month, at a time when the administration
contended he was already an official member of the board. His name
also appeared on Giuliani campaign literature as a Democrat who was
backing the mayor. Board members are not permitted to participate
in the campaigns they regulate, for obvious reasons. Giuliani's
campaign says Erazo's name was included by mistake.
<p>
   Still, Erazo has demonstrated a stupendous lack of sensitivity
about the need for board members to be objective and avoid the
appearance of partiality. The board contains only five members at
present, and it cannot afford for one of them to be as malleable as
this one appears to be. Giuliani cannot force his nominee to
resign, but he should publicly urge Erazo to do so, and try to
steer his campaign into a more moderate course in the weeks ahead.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 26:
<p>
   American foreign policy has long been stained by the use of
Washington's military aid abroad against innocent civilians.
American weapons have supplied death squads. Aid designed to fight
drugs has instead often gone to fight guerrillas whose activities
concern foreign militaries more. Human rights groups even charge
that American-supplied helicopters have been used to strafe
villages.
<p>
   Now Congress could help eliminate these blots through an
amendment to this year's foreign aid bill. The legislation, offered
by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would block American assistance
from going to any unit of a foreign security force where there is
credible evidence that the unit has committed gross violations of
human rights. An exception can be made if the government is
bringing those responsible to justice.
<p>
   A similar amendment was blocked earlier this year, mainly by
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations
Committee. The continued opposition of Gilman, who has supported
human rights in other contexts, is puzzling, as the amendment would
not cut off aid to any police or military branch willing to assure
that it will be used properly.
<p>
   Such guarantees are not easy to monitor. In Colombia, which
boasts the most brutal military in the hemisphere, American embassy
officials have said they cannot always tell where all their
military aid goes. Embassy officials need to be dogged in their
pursuit of information on the recipients' human rights records.
They should not accept the assurances of their client militaries,
but work with respected groups that track human rights.
<p>
   The amendment would be worth passing if it did nothing more than
encourage the establishment of a tracking system. But it could also
put pressure on foreign soldiers to respect human rights and could
help crack the wall of impunity that shields abusive officers in
many countries.

   A review for the Diesel jeans worldwide account, which began
with Diesel prepared to change agencies, has ended with the account
being divided between the incumbent, Paradiset DDB in Stockholm,
and a finalist in the review, Lowe Howard-Spink in London. Billings
were estimated at $30 million.
<p>
   Paradiset DDB, part of the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom
Group, has handled the Diesel account since 1991.
<p>
   Its attention-getting campaigns that mock traditional
advertising have won awards like a Grand Prix at the 44th
International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France. Paradiset DDB
will retain the television, or brand image, portion of the account.
<p>
   Lowe Howard-Spink, part of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies, will handle print work, on which
Diesel plans to focus in moving toward more product-oriented
campaigns.
<p>
   The review, which started in the spring, had been narrowed to
Lowe Howard-Spink and GGT Advertising in London, part of GGT Group.

STORM TURNS WORK COMMUTE INTO RAIN-WRACKED ODYSSEY &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) &QL; 
BY ERIC WAHLGREN &LR;  &QC;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  At water coolers and on cigarette breaks from
Northridge to City Hall, the talk was the same all over town: Was
that the worst commute ever or what?
<p>
   Offering the first taste of just how rough the Winter of El Nino
could be, the season's first rainfall Thursday triggered everything
from fender benders to a fatal accident, turning Los Angeles
roadways into parking lots. When commuters finally landed at work
after drives that took three to four times normal, they one-upped
one another with stories about their trips through hell.
<p>
   On the bright side, the rain lifted in the afternoon and
motorists reported normal commutes during their rides home. Also,
the rainfall brought an end to the official 219-day drought that
Los Angeles has endured, as measured at the Civic Center downtown.
The previous record for longest dry spell was 197 days in 1927.
<p>
   Forecasters predicted sunshine would return today as the
remnants of Hurricane Nora, downgraded to a tropical storm, driven
through California and Arizona by El Nino, headed toward Utah.
<p>
   It took DreamWorks employee Julie Alfenito an hour to travel two
miles  &MD;  usually a five-minute trip  &MD;  from her home in Studio City
to work in Universal City.
<p>
   Co-worker Sivhan Gray's typical 40-minute commute from Woodland
Hills along Ventura Boulevard stretched into 3 1/2 hours of agony.
<p>
   ``It was awful,'' Gray said. ``I had to listen to the same news
over and over again, and the top 40 songs over and over again, and
I couldn't even pull over to pee.''
<p>
   Between 4 and 11 a.m., the California Highway Patrol reported
228 collisions, including one fatal accident on the westbound
Hollywood Freeway at Highland Avenue that backed up cars 10 miles
into the San Fernando Valley.
<p>
   ``This is along the lines of what we would have on the first
rainy day of the season,'' said Evan Robinson, a CHP spokesman in
Glendale.
<p>
   The primary culprit, Robinson said, was the oil that builds up
on the roadways over the summer, transforming freeways into
slippery slides when it mixes with water during the first rain.
<p>
   ``People don't adjust their speeds,'' Robinson said. ``They are
rushing to make up for lost time and are driving too fast for the
prevailing weather conditions.''
<p>
   El Nino, the global weather phenomenon that has caused droughts
in some parts of the world and massive flooding in others  &MD; 
including Southern California  &MD;  pushed this tropical hurricane
north.
<p>
   Without the warming of the Pacific Ocean that El Nino causes, it
is unlikely that Hurricane Nora would have ventured as far north as
Los Angeles, weather experts said.
<p>
   ``Hurricanes thrive on warm water,'' said Tim Barnett, a
climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla. ``What the El Nino has done by making the water warm is give
the hurricane more to feed on and allow it to penetrate further
north than normal.''
<p>
   The wayward hurricane also caused temporary power outages in
more than 40,000 homes across the city, including pockets in Sun
Valley, North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Mission Hills and West Hills.
<p>
   According to a Department of Water and Power spokesman, the long
dry spell allowed dust to build up on electric lines and equipment,
creating the right conditions for flashovers or shorts once the
rain hit.
<p>
   By 3 p.m., more than 80 crews had restored service to all but
about 11,300 homes, he said.
<p>
   In Malibu, considered by weather watchers to be ground zero when
El Nino hits because of the oceanfront community's vulnerability to
mudslides and killer waves, Huricane Nora caused nothing more than
a few minor mudslides.
<p>
   But the threat of El Nino, which some climatologists predict
could bring the wettest winter of this century, was on people's
minds as rain pelted the city's 27 miles of coastline.
<p>
   ``We are hoping the scientists are wrong about El Nino,'' said
Rick Morgan, Malibu's city engineer. ``But we are trying to get as
prepared as we can.''
<p>
   There was little motorists could do to prepare for this storm.
<p>
   No doubt about it, Hurricane Nora was a major pain. Officials
declared six SigAlerts  &MD;  that dreaded Southern California traffic
warning when at least one lane of traffic is blocked for more than
30 minutes.
<p>
   Perhaps the accident that caused the biggest headache for
drivers occurred when a pedestrian was hit and killed by a truck
near the Highland Avenue off-ramp of the Hollywood Freeway shortly
before 6:30 a.m.
<p>
   The wreck, which involved at least five other cars, backed up
traffic more than 10 miles into the San Fernando Valley, pushing
downtown-bound commuters onto surface streets and canyon passes.
<p>
   It could turn out that the region's worst accident may not have
been weather-related, as the death of the male pedestrian is being
investigated as a possible suicide, said Sgt. Warren Stanley of the
CHP.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Warnaco Group Inc. reached a
definitive agreement with Designer Holdings Inc. to purchase the
maker of Calvin Klein jeans for about $353.7 million in stock, the
companies said.
<p>
   The terms are unchanged from the initial agreement, which was
announced Sept. 17.
<p>
   Designer Holdings shareholders will receive 0.324 share of
Warnaco for each share held, valuing Designer Holdings shares at
about $11 each, based on the average closing price for Warnaco
stock over the past eight trading days, the companies said.
<p>
   Designer Holdings shares closed unchanged yesterday at 9 11/16.
Warnaco shares fell 13/16 to 33 7/16. Based on yesterday's closing
price for Warnaco, the terms value Designer Holdings shares at
$10.83 each.
<p>
   The acquisition gives Warnaco more control over the Calvin Klein
clothing and accessories business. Warnaco already makes Calvin
Klein underwear and accessories. Designer Holdings has a 40-year
license to make Calvin Klein jeans.
<p>
   Calvin Klein-brand goods generated $472.9 million, or about 98
percent, of Designer Holdings' 1996 sales, while Warnaco sold about
$330 million of Calvin Klein goods last year.
<p>
   Calvin Klein executives reportedly opposed Warnaco's purchase of
Designer Holdings, not wanting to put a large chunk of the firm's
revenue flow with one manufacturer, according to the Wall Street
Journal. Calvin Klein executives last week encouraged other
clothing makers to bid for Designer Holdings, including VF Corp.
and Fratini Group, the paper reported.
<p>
   Following the completion of the acquisition, expected by the end
of the year, Designer Holdings shareholders will own about 16
percent of Warnaco on a fully diluted basis, the companies said.
The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  If you thought that the love affair between Americans
and their gas-guzzling road-cruisers was over long ago, think
again.
<p>
   Tail fins may not yet be back in fashion, but cars with monster
dimensions are once more the national rage.
<p>
   In fact, these garage-busters are not cars at all. What is
drawing buyers to the showrooms in droves are so-called sport
utility vehicles that ride high above the road.
<p>
   They have beefy engines, intimidating front-grill fenders and
that other feature that is so vital in suburbia, four-wheel drive.
<p>
   Their conquest of the American roadway  &MD;  the big American
manufacturers like Ford and General Motors simply cannot keep up
with demand  &MD;  is sounding alarm bells among safety groups. In
accidents between these goliaths and flimsy sedans, guess which of
the two gets crushed?
<p>
   Ford, apparently seeing no limits to the trend, is developing
what should be the biggest utility yet  &MD;  an eight-passenger titan
to be called a crew wagon.
<p>
   It will be 19 feet long  &MD;  as compared with slightly under 15
feet for the Jeep Cherokee  &MD;  and boast a V-10 engine under the
hood.
<p>
   The crew wagon will be bigger even than the current bully among
bullies, the Chevrolet Suburban.
<p>
   In this correspondent's neighborhood the Suburbans rule
everywhere except in one street. Here there is a resident with the
biggest status-symbol-on-wheels available anywhere  &MD;  the Hummer, a
derivative of military vehicle that might have been designed to
cross the Himalayas.
<p>
   At Universal Ford, a sprawling dealership just across the East
River from Manhattan in Queens, Frank Thomas confirms the passion
for size.
<p>
   ``The bigger they are and the larger the engine size, the more I
sell of them,'' he said. ``I love it.''
<p>
   For every five large-sedan Taurus models that he sells, he will
shift thirty of the four-wheel-drive Ford Explorers.
<p>
   ``It's totally about ego,'' Thomas says of his customers. ``I
look at their backgrounds and their credit histories and there is
absolutely no practical point in them buying these vehicles.
<p>
   ``They think they are going out on safari or something when in
fact the largest obstacle they are likely to meet around here is a
runaway shopping (cart).''
<p>
   An additional, somewhat ironic, attraction of these brutes is
that their size means that they can no longer be described as small
cars by the government. They thus escape both luxury taxes and
federal regulations on fuel consumption.
<p>
   There will be no limits on how much these vehicles can drink  &MD; 
which is a good thing. Most manage only 14 miles a gallon.
<p>
   The safety disadvantage that the rest of us find ourselves in on
the road was highlighted by a National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration study.
<p>
   It noted that in fatal accidents involving a car and a light
truck, which includes pickups and sport utilities, eighty percent
of those who died were riding in the cars.
<p>
   That is a statistic, however, that may only quicken the stampede
for the utilities. Have one of these parked outside your house and
not only are you the meanest SOB on the block, your kids are likely
to be safest also.
<p>
   And who worries about the fuel efficiency when you are living in
a country where a gallon of gasoline sells for less money than a
gallon of designer water?

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks slipped, led by
retailers and electronics makers, amid concern about weak consumer
demand after the government said September prices were flat.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 stock average fell 198.20 points, or 1.08
percent, to 18,143.76. The Topix index of all shares on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 10.25 points, or 0.72
percent, to 1407.80.
<p>
   Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent on the month, showing no sign
of inflation, the Management and Coordination Agency said. Prices
rose after salaried workers and civil servants had to double their
contributions towards medical costs on Sept. 1, leaving less in
consumers' slender purses for personal spending.
<p>
   ``Consumers got hit on the head three times -- with the increase
in consumption tax, the cancellation of tax rebates and higher
medical costs,'' said Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis
Investment Research Corporation. ``The government basically gives
no consideration to the impact of what they're doing will have on
the people.''

   Daiei Inc. fell 59 yen to 691. FamilyMart Co. declined 290 yen
to 5,180. Uny Co. fell 140 yen to 1,760. Takashimaya Co. fell 50
yen to 1,260. Ito-Yokado Co. lost 35 yen to 6,430.

   An estimated 330 million shares traded as of early afternoon, up
from 310 million the same time yesterday.

   ``We've got a war at 18,000. As you go below 18,000 you get
trust funds buying, and above 18,000 you get foreigners selling,''
said Pelham Smithers, strategist at ING Baring Securities (Japan)
Ltd. ``We're seeing ludicrous amounts of trust bank buying to
support the market.''
<p>
   Domestic pension funds are supporting the market above the
18,003 level -- at which the benchmark index began the fiscal year
in March -- to avoid posting latent losses on equity holdings. The
first half of the Japanese financial year ends next Tuesday.
<p>
   ``Foreigners are selling the blue chips on because they're
worried about the state of the Japanese economy,'' said Smithers.
<p>
   Sony Corp. fell 200 yen to 11,400. Fujitsu Ltd. slid 40 yen to
1,550. Hitachi Ltd. fell 20 yen to 1,060. Toyota Motor Corp.
retreated 30 yen to 3,670. Denso Corp. fell 60 yen to 2,920.
<p>
   Banks gained on optimism the fragile economy would keep interest
rates at record lows enabling banks to accelerate write-offs of
non-performing loans.
<p>
   Japan's 20 main banks will dispose of 7 trillion yen to 8
trillion yen in non-performing loans in the year through March
1998, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported earlier this week.
<p>
   Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. rose 60 points to 2,360.
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. gained 80 yen to 1,550. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. rose 40 yen to 1,550. Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking
Co. advanced 15 to 613.
<p>
   In preparation for the half-year book closing, companies had
engaged in cross trades -- selling and rebuying large blocks of
shares to book latent profits -- as well as selling off
cross-holdings outright.
<p>
   Cross share holding is when banks and companies mutually own
large blocks of each other's shares to promote stability.
<p>
   Now that all trades are booked for October rather than for
September's close, there is less pressure to continue selling off
cross-holdings, said Jason James, strategist at HSBC James Capel
Japan Ltd.
<p>
   ``There was very heavy cross trading in the market in September
-- the heaviest since the bubble burst,'' said James. ``They were
selling off or booking profit on cross-held stock in order to boost
results -- in particular among the banks -- to make aggressive
write offs.''
<p>
   NEC Corp. was the day's volume leader, with 5.7 million shares
changing hands. The computer maker rose 30 yen to 1,490 after
Merrill Lynch analyst Kiyohisa Ota raised his rating from
``accumulate'' to ``buy.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Even in the city vaunted as the art world's capital,
it's not often that in one year there are two shows of religious
art so dazzling that attendance is compulsory.
<p>
   ``Mandala: The Architecture of Enlightenment,'' the Asia
Society's new exhibition devoted to the ancient Hindu and Buddhist
icon called the mandala, can be compared to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art's recent ``Glory of Byzantium''  &MD;  not in terms of size or
comprehensiveness, but in its brilliant presentation of a complex
religious art not too readily accessible.
<p>
   Billed as the first exhibition of the cosmic diagrams that
depict the multiple universes of Buddhism, the Asia Society show,
organized with Tibet House, presents more than 50 mandalas and
related objects, including sculptures and models of sacred spaces
from Tibet, Nepal, China, Japan, Bhutan, India and Indonesia.
<p>
   The Sanskrit word mandala has come to mean a magical sanctum,
the blissful environment of a particular buddha built on the
foundation of his perfect wisdom. Mandalas are created as aids to
meditation, to encourage change from an ordinary perception of the
world into that of the buddha's enlightenment. They can occur in
many forms, and in materials ranging from paint to bronze to
butter.
<p>
   But those most commonly seen are the so-called
palace-architecture mandalas of Tibet and Nepal: flat, colorfully
painted cosmograms that depict the otherworldly spheres of powerful
deities in contrast to the all-too-earthly realm of the
unenlightened.
<p>
   One of the earliest such mandalas in the show is a beautifully
rendered Paramasukha Chakrasamvara (Supreme Bliss Wheel) from
Nepal, dated about A.D. 1100, made when the flat, stylized art of
Byzantium was flourishing in the West. In the center stand
Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi, two buddhas who form a father-mother
couple. Their sexual embrace symbolizes the union of wisdom and
compassion, enabling them to give every being a new life of
happiness in their buddhaverse.
<p>
   Surrounded by six guardian deities, they are enclosed in the
square of a palace. Outside the circle surrounding the square are
eight graveyards, traditional in Chakrasamvara mandalas,
representing the human life cycle of ignorance, passing pleasures
and inevitable death. It contrasts with the buddha world of the
painting's center, where omniscient awareness brings bliss. In
colors as nuanced as those in a Persian carpet, the details of the
painting  &MD;  the jewels that decorate the palace, the symbols, the
lively human and animal figures that disport in the graveyards  &MD; 
are done with a finesse that gives even more pleasure the closer
you study it.
<p>
   Mandalas of this symmetrical type are experienced by initiates
as three-dimensional, like pop-up paintings. Theoretically, if you
could place your thumb and forefinger on the central image and pull
it upward, the entire mandala would rise, with all its elements
falling into place as a three-dimensional palace. Several miniature
palaces in the show are actually mandalas realized in 3-D,
incredibly elaborate fairy tale structures painted as brightly as
children's toys and garnished with the jewels, tiny people and
animals that appear in the paintings.
<p>
   Not all mandalas are as temperate as the Chakrasamvara, however.
The rare ``Chamunda Fierce Fire Offering Symbol Mandala'' from
17th- or 18th-century Tibet, is a gruesome affair meant to help
cure the disease of insatiable ego. It depicts an ocean of blood
against a background of flames. On the ocean sits a continent made
of a flayed human skin, supporting a mansion fashioned of
skeletons, its gates festooned with guts and impaled bodies. A calm
inner triangle shows the goddess Chamunda, consort of Yama, the
Lord of Death, poised in symbol form on her sun disk.
<p>
   Somewhat more peaceful is an 18th-century ``Offering Cosmos
Mandala'' from Tibet, an exquisitely embroidered and appliqued
textile hanging that conveys a different vision of the universe. A
circle in a soft blue landscape depicts the mythical Mount Meru,
the planetary axis, emerging from rings of lesser mountains, with
mansions representing the continents around them. Jewels, bells and
yak tails drip from goblins' mouths at the top of the hanging,
while in the landscape below animals and birds cavort amid
offerings of skulls and bones.
<p>
   The show's curators, Robert A.F. Thurman, professor of religions
at Columbia University, and Denise Patry Leidy, associate curator
in the Department of Asian Art at the Metropolitan Museum, have
invitingly orchestrated this dizzying parade of otherworldly
visions. Part of the exhibition is designed as a 3-D mandala
structure with four gateways through which visitors enter.
<p>
   In its center is an eye-boggling bronze sculpture from Tibet,
dating from the 16th or 17th century, that shows a Kalachakra
father-mother couple locked in a dynamic union. Each of their heads
has four faces; each body projects a slew of arms that fan out in a
powerful field of force. Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) is a deity who
represents the eternal omnipresence of the buddha mind throughout
the past, present and future.
<p>
   Not incidentally, monks from the Namgyal Monastery branch in
Ithaca, N.Y., will be at the exhibition through Oct. 8 constructing
a Kalachakra sand mandala, an elaborate flat representation in
colored sand of the mythical five-story palace of the deity. It
will remain throughout the exhibition. Even if you miss the
demonstration, don't let this show get away from you. But be
warned. While the marvelous objects here give immediate esthetic
pleasure, their layers of meaning are more elusive. As with
Buddhism itself, enlightenment does not come easily.
<p>
   ``Mandala: The Architecture of Enlightenment'' remains at the
Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, through Jan. 4.

<p>
   DALLAS  &MD;  Paul Keegan waited until the second-to-last minute of
the last game to score his first goal of the regular season. And
that goal Thursday night gave the Revolution a 2-1 victory over the
Dallas Burn, enabling New England to clinch a berth in the Major
Soccer League playoffs as the fourth-place Eastern Conference team.
<p>
   Keegan's goal, a left-footer from inside the goal area off a
throw-in, provided a dramatic finish for the Revolution, who had
been on the verge of becoming the only team to fail to qualify for
the playoffs in each of MLS's first two seasons.
<p>
   This was another ragged game for the Revolution, but they
displayed resourcefulness after falling behind, then gambling with
an all-out attacking scheme in the second half. Joe-Max Moore's
penalty kick tied the score early in the second half. And though
fifth-place New York/New Jersey lost, 1-0, to Columbus, the
Revolution played for a regulation victory since any other result
would have given the MetroStars a chance to overtake New England
with a victory in their final game Sunday.
<p>
   ``This team deserves to be in the playoffs,'' said goalkeeper
Walter Zenga, who made several spectacular kick saves in the first
half. ``With the spirit, the soul, and the character we showed in
the second half, we can try to win in the playoffs. When you are
out, when you are about to lose everything, you try your hardest,
and that is what we did in the second half.''
<p>
   The Revolution will visit D.C. United Oct. 5, then play host to
the second game Oct. 8 in the best-of-three series.
<p>
   Keegan entered the match in the 10th minute after Imad Baba
departed with a back injury suffered when he was tackled from
behind. But Dallas scored first as Swiss midfielder Alain Sutter
took command of the contest. A sharp back heel by Sutter set up a
goal by Gerell Elliott, who scored after Zenga had made two
point-blank saves off Elliott and Damian in the 33d minute.
<p>
   Keegan, who scored four goals last season but had only an own
goal this season, hit the post in the final minute of the half.
<p>
   Alberto Naveda stole a poor clearance early in the second half
and chipped a cross to Alexi Lalas, who chested down to Giuseppe
Galderisi, who drew a penalty in the 12th minute. Moore converted
his fourth goal of the season. Then, with the Revolution playing a
direct, risky style, Keegan shot wide off a Galderisi-Alejandro
Farias combination and Moore hit the bar with a 25-yard drive.
<p>
   Finally, Mike Burns's throw-in was headed on by Dallas defender
Wade Webber, then headed toward the goal by Moore. Keegan
controlled the ball and slotted it past a defender and goalkeeper
Mark Dodd.
<p>
   ``There was no reason to play for a tie,'' Revolution coach
Thomas Rongen said. ``We went to a direct, long-ball style and kept
a lot of chances alive with our height.
<p>
   ``I felt every time we played direct that they were less able to
attack the first and second ball strongly. It was survival of the
fittest at the end. We threw caution to the wind, so to speak. If
you play direct, sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't.''
<p>
   The Revolution won three of their final four games after setting
an MLS record with nine consecutive losses.
<p>
   They had few answers for Sutter's creativity in the first half,
but they increased their aggressiveness in the second, and Dallas
failed to find as much space for Sutter.
<p>
   And with sweeper Francis Okaroh out with a groin injury midway
through the first half, the Revolution often seemed vulnerable,
especially when pushing forward after halftime. They were fortunate
that Elliott and Dante Washington, who replaced Damian, made poor
first touches after being left free on counterattacks.
<p>
   ``We didn't play tactically smart, as far as tackling and
closing down, in the first half,'' Rongen said. ``In the second
half, we were more determined in tackling and winning first and
second balls. We had the desire. We had more to play for than they
did.''

   NEW YORK  &MD;  We tend to think of African sculpture as more or less
anonymous, the creations of a tribe rather than a person. But that
doesn't fit the work of the Yoruba, the Nigerian culture that is
one of the most prolific  &MD;  if not the most accomplished  &MD; 
art-producing groups on the continent.
<p>
   Olowe, Adigbologe, Areogun, Bamgbose, Osamuko and Bamgboye may
not exactly be household names to us, but they are masters, some of
whom  &MD;  Olowe, for instance  &MD;  are celebrated outside of Africa.
<p>
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition ``Master Hand:
Individuality and Creativity Among Yoruba Sculptors'' presents the
work of some 30 male and female artists of Nigeria and the Republic
of Benin  &MD;  from the mid-19th through the mid-20th centuries  &MD;  with
the aim of showing how they were perceived and honored throughout
the culture.
<p>
   Although the masks, figures, vessels and architectural elements
were not signed, and have entered many Western collections without
attribution, each artist is nevertheless known throughout
Yorubaland for a signature style, just as artists are in Western
countries.
<p>
   Yoruba artists by no means worked in solitude. Very much a part
of the social order, they were trained in collaborative workshops
by masters before achieving that rank themselves, and their art was
commissioned by individuals, families, priests and tribal leaders.
Take Olowe (1873-1938) of Ise in the Ekiti region, who was said to
be the most illustrious Yoruba sculptor of the past century.
Admired for his dynamic architectural creations, he is praised in
Yoruba poetry as a great hand with the wood of the iroko tree,
carving ``as though it were soft as a calabash.''
<p>
   After successfully completing commissions for a local king,
Olowe did work for other regional leaders, and in 1924 a pair of
doors he made for the palace at Ikere were acquired by the British
Museum. In this show, he is represented by two wonderfully carved
objects done before 1950: a veranda post showing a kingly personage
on muleback atop a platform supported by a female figure, and a
very lively ``Olumeye Vessel,'' a pot in the shape of a stylized
rooster held in the lap of a stalwart woman. Leaning against it on
either side are twin figures, each bearing a barrel on its head.
<p>
   Although both of these pieces are well within time-honored
Yoruba tradition, they are extraordinary for the incisive
brilliance of Olowe's carving technique, which created not only
crisply articulated figures but also deeply patterned and textured
surfaces.
<p>
   The ``Olumeye Vessel'' shows, too, his skill at rhythmically
playing off shapes against each other, with the outward turning of
the leaning figures balanced by the strong central figure of the
woman and the jauntily reclining body of the rooster.
<p>
   Another star Yoruba carver was Bamgboye (1893-1978), from
Odo-Owa, also in the Ekiti region. Known for his complex
compositions, he was the prime designer of Epa helmet masks,
elaborate headgear worn during masquerades that celebrate important
contributors to the public good. On view is his brightly painted
``Warrior'' mask from 1920, honoring the military strategy that
helped build the community. An abstract face at the base of the
structure, worn over the dancer's head, supports a rider on a
caparisoned horse, with tiers of soldiers on either side massed one
above the other. The whole thing is topped by an elaborate
umbrellalike structure.
<p>
   Bamgboye also contributes a stunning smaller figure, an ``Esu
Dance Staff.'' The carving is devoted to the cult of Esu, god of
chance and irrational mischief, a highly important figure in the
Yoruba world. It depicts a small figure wearing a huge, bridgelike
headdress that cantilevers out behind him, carved in a geometric
design. From its tubular bottom piece hang strings of cowrie
shells. The figure itself, standing on a pedestal, blows a hunting
whistle, one of Esu's emblems.
<p>
   Such were Bamgboye's skills that in the 1930's British officials
gave him a teaching post at a Government school. But according to
William Fagg (1914-1992), the renowned English Africanist who
specialized in Nigeria, from that point on his work became
self-conscious. Happily, both these objects date from before that
period.
<p>
   The two female artists in the exhibition worked in terra cotta,
a traditional material for Yoruba women. Abatan (1885-1967), from
Oke-Odan in the Egbado region, acclaimed for her mud sculpture, is
represented by  &MD;  what else?  &MD;  a pot, its lid adorned by a
melon-breasted woman in turn holding a bowl. Nearby is a work by an
anonymous woman known only as ``the rival of Abatan,'' whose piece,
made in the 19th century, takes the form of a heavily stylized
female figure with a row of wartlike bumps down each arm, and
sporting an open pot attached to her belly. But both these works
are modest contributions compared with the flamboyant creations of
the male artists.
<p>
   One of the exhibition's main attractions is a showcase of
arresting masks, primarily of the Gelede and Egungun cults. The
Gelede rite celebrates the spiritual power of women, perceived as
both beneficial and destructive, and it is observed once a year in
masquerades whose performers wear headdresses in the form of
bizarre faces.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A powerful Gelede prop is the wooden mask started in 1930 by the
master Fagbite Asamu (late 19th to mid-20th century) and completed
in 1971 by his son, Falola Edun (born 1900), both from the Ketu
region of western Nigeria. From a small round face with an
enigmatic smile, and crowned with a cap of snake scales, sprout
what look like two large elbow-joint pipes. Into each is fitted the
stretched-out body of a big snake in the act of ingesting an
antelope. The snake bodies, hanging down from the head, are
manipulated during performances. Film shown nearby depicts the act
of carving the mask and its use in a 1971 masquerade.
<p>
   The Egungun cult, devoted to ancestor worship, is far more
widespread than the Gelede, covering all of Yorubaland and some
neighboring communities. And its art is more grotesque, even
surrealistic. Egungun masquerades were performed especially at
members' funerals, with some dancers supposedly in a state of
trance for the conveyance of messages to and from the Beyond. A
brilliant Egungun headdress here, done before 1920 in the manner of
the Adigbologe family, specialists in such masks, shows a
wide-eyed, scarified African face topped by a staggering
arrangement of stylized hair. The hair is decked with an array of
power emblems, like calabash vials bearing magic potions.
<p>
   Not to be overlooked is a poignant display of ``Twin Memorial
Figures,'' small commemorative carvings of twins (the Yoruba give
birth to more twins than almost any other population in the world)
who have died. Other standouts include a quirky ``House of the Head
Shrine,'' an undated sculpture by the Adesina workshop in Ekiti,
whose cowrie-shell base, topped by figures of splendid beadwork,
symbolize wealth and well-being, and an ambitious ``Magbo
Headdress,'' attributed to Onabanjo in the 20th century, of painted
wood and cloth. It presents a 13-figure assemblage of Yoruba types,
including a prisoner, a preacher and a nursing mother all backed by
an equestrian king topped by a large bird.
<p>
   This enjoyable and educational show, organized by Alisa LaGamma,
assistant curator for the Met's department of the arts of Africa,
Oceania and the Americas, includes photographs taken by Fagg on
site in the 1950s, among the earliest images to catch Yoruba
artists at their work. Yet charming as it is, Yoruba art  &MD;  which is
not, by the way, the work that influenced the French modernists
early in this century  &MD;  seems to me more provincial, with less
esthetic claim, than the highly sophisticated creations of some
other African cultures.
<p>
   ``Master Hand: Individuality and Creativity Among Yoruba
Sculptors'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue
and 82d Street, through March 1.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  In the wave of German artists that washed over
Manhattan in the 1980s, Rosemarie Trockel, whose fifth solo
exhibition in New York is at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in
Chelsea, was exceptional for being neither Neo-Expressionist nor
male. The works for which she became known here seemed to celebrate
this fact: they were Minimalist paintings made on knitting machines
that insinuated notions of domesticity, everyday life and women's
work into the sacred realm of high art.
<p>
   Ms. Trockel's knit surfaces sometimes suggested expanded ski
sweaters, but their patterns included everything from snowflakes to
Playboy bunnies to swastikas. Others, more resolutely esthetic in
their stripes and dots, amounted to fuzzy versions of Op Art. A few
simply presented the wool industry's Woolmark logo showing coiled
yarn.
<p>
   The knitted paintings were only the tip of the iceberg of Ms.
Trockel's whimsical, elegant, politically astute art. Although the
extent of her activities is still not well known in the United
States, she turned out to be nearly as polymorphous as some of her
male colleagues, although usually with a feminist twist.
<p>
   A beautiful Projects exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in
1988 proved her skill at deft improvisational drawings. She also
made sculptures, some a little too Beuys-like for their own good,
others sharply original, for example, a series of abbreviated white
enamel stoves with blank burners that like the knit paintings did
not fulfill their traditional function but instead implied the
feminine while hovering provocatively at Minimalism's borders.
Still other sculptures consisted of casts of seashells or sleeping
(or drunken) animals.
<p>
   The interest in the natural world began during Ms. Trockel's
art- school days in the late 1970s when she made Super 8 films of
animals. Last summer, she and another German artist, Carsten
Holler, collaborated on an installation in one of the outbuildings
at the Documenta X exhibition in Kassel, Germany: it was a pigpen
complete with sow and offspring and a bleacher-type ramp on which
visitors could sit or recline while watching them. The work seemed
to measure our distance from nature by presenting it as
entertainment, spectacle and performance, but it was also
endearingly immediate.
<p>
   Since the late 1980s, Ms. Trockel has returned increasingly to
the moving image, devoting nearly all her energy to video. The show
at Gladstone amounts to a lively partial retrospective in this
medium, with 12 videotapes from 1989-97 displayed on monitors
suspended in rows overhead, forming a single installation piece.
<p>
   ``Yvonne,'' an ambitious autobiographical collage of still and
moving video images projected on a wall in an adjacent gallery, is
new this year. In it, the artist's friends  &MD;  infants, children and
adults alike  &MD;  are shown in various modes of relaxation or play.
Their clothes, which are usually knit and somewhat eccentric, have
been made by the artist.
<p>
   At the other extreme, also new and also projected large, is a
nearly abstract film called ``Tweedle'' in which strands of yarn
jump and twist to bouncy musical accompaniment, like an early
experiment in avant-garde animation.
<p>
   And a kind of afterthought that affirms the artist's penchant
for open-ended works whose meaning she refuses to pin down is a
nearly life-size cement sculpture of a sleeping elf with a large
nose. A well-known character from German folk tales, he has magic
powers when he touches that nose. The work is rife with
metaphorical possibilities, especially for a female artist known
for tweaking artistic (male) pretension, but Ms. Trockel lets
sleeping dogs lie.
<p>
   The show makes you think that the knitted works and all their
formal and social implications remain at the core of Ms. Trockel's
art, running through it, sometimes literally, like a connecting
thread. Clothing as both a universal human condition and personal
expression becomes increasingly prominent as a theme in ``Yvonne,''
especially in the finale, where many of the outfits worn in the
video flash past, disembodied and isolated on a white ground.
<p>
   But thread is a line that can take Ms. Trockel back to nature,
as in ``Parade,'' where the marching tendencies of a certain breed
of silk worm (they travel in nose-to-tail rows) generate animated
abstract patterns. Also included is a short sped-up tape of a moth
eating its way through a sweater; running forward and then in
reverse, it makes the insect appear to repeatedly make and then
repair gaping holes, like an artist drawing and then erasing or a
sinner indulging and then repenting.
<p>
   The penchant for tiny increments that add up to large forms, so
evident in the works involving knitting, is also manifest in
``nature'' films like ``Naples,'' in which huge flocks of birds
drift rhythmically across the screen like so many magically
controlled flecks, and in ``Ants,'' which focuses on a single
insect whose movements are doubled by the use of a split screen.
<p>
   It must be said that the group presentation of the dozen videos
is sometimes confusing. Longer narrative videos, like ``To
Balthasar, Age 6,'' a dramatic work in which a girl and boy
encounter death in the form of a rabbit-snatching hawk on the way
home from school, get lost in the shuffle. But overall the
interplay between themes and images is illuminating. It suggests
that it is in video that the disparate threads of Ms. Trockel's
work are not only being brought together but expanded and enriched
as well.
<p>
   Rosemarie Trockel's work remains at the Barbara Gladstone
Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, through Oct. 15.

DODGERS KEEP SLIM HOPES ALIVE &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By KEVIN ACEE &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   DENVER  &MD;  Here more than anywhere, over does not mean over.
<p>
   That is the Dodgers' thinking as they hope against everything
logical that if they are really, really good they can win the
National League West.
<p>
   A 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Thursday at Coors
Field kept hope on a respirator.
<p>
   In the major leagues' only race left to be officially decided,
the San Francisco Giants lead the Dodgers by two games with three
to play. The Dodgers must sweep the Rockies and the Giants must
lose two against the visiting Padres for there to be a one-game
playoff Monday afternoon in San Francisco.
<p>
   ``We're just going to go out and play,'' Eric Karros said. ``We
lose one more game, that's it. We're on a life-support system right
now anyways.''
<p>
   The Dodgers, led by Todd Zeile's second two-homer game in three
nights, hit four home runs against Rockies starter Pedro Astacio.
Hideo Nomo allowed the Rockies three runs on five hits in seven
innings, and Antonio Osuna and Todd Worrell held the Rockies off
the final two innings. Nomo joined Chan Ho Park as the Dodgers'
second 14-game winner.
<p>
   ``It seemed like we had a little more life, a little more
energy,'' Zeile said. ``Maybe it's coming to Colorado, where it's
an uplifting place to play. ... Two weeks ago we were a team
playing with a fear of failing, a fear of losing. We've got nothing
to lose now. We're in the underdogs' seat.
<p>
   ``I think everyone has in the back of their mind, whether they
admit it or not, that the last breath isn't out of us yet.''
<p>
   The Dodgers spoke solemnly after losing to the San Diego Padres
on Wednesday. No one came out and said the race was over. But since
they had roundly declared a few days earlier that they needed to
finish the season without losing again, they knew what the
lackadaisical effort against the Padres meant.
<p>
   They spoke after that game and before Thursday's of wanting to
finish the season on a positive note. If that meant they made the
playoffs, so be it.
<p>
   Zeile was chief among the realists, saying dejectedly in the
aftermath of Wednesday's loss, ``I'm not going to say it's over,
but. ... We'll play hard and see what happens. But the way I saw it
two days ago was we had to win (the remaining) six games. We
haven't done that.''
<p>
   That was no reason to give up.
<p>
   Zeile got the Dodgers started with a solo home run out of
left-center field in the second inning. It was his 30th homer of
the season and seventh in the past 31 games.
<p>
   Darren Lewis' first home run since Aug. 8, 1996 scored three
runs and extended the Dodgers lead to 4-0 in the fourth. Karros'
30th homer of the season, well into the left-field bleachers, drove
home Mike Piazza in the fifth. Two batters later, Zeile added two
runs by driving in Raul Mondesi with his second homer of the night.
The shot to left center gave Zeile his fifth two-homer game of the
season.
<p>
   All this was enough to make Astacio, a Dodger until last month,
lose his composure. It was a side of Astacio the Rockies had not
seen in his previous six starts with them.
<p>
   Astacio promptly threw his first pitch to Lewis up near the
eyes. After home-plate umpire Larry Vanover spoke with Astacio and
both managers, Astacio's next pitch sailed high over Lewis' head
and all the way to the backstop. Rockies manager Don Baylor
replaced Astacio, who suffered his first loss as a Rockie.
<p>
   The Rockies would never get closer than four runs, though they
scored two runs in the seventh against Nomo and two more in the
eighth against Osuna.
<p>
   Zeile finished with three runs scored. Mondesi singled twice and
scored both times. Eric Young was 2 for 4 in his first game in
Colorado since the Dodgers acquired him in a trade for Astacio on
Aug. 18.
<p>
   ``The way we hit the ball tonight, the way we pitched,'' Zeile
said, ``it showed we've got some spark left in us. We can say, if
we win the next three games, who knows?''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  On a recent weekend afternoon, four little girls
hunkered down on scratchy museum carpeting and listened hard to a
story about a famous 6-year-old named Eloise who lived at the Plaza
hotel.
<p>
   The storyteller, Susan Raggio, a longtime volunteer at the
Museum of the City of New York in Manhattan, gave voice to the
tale, more than 40 years old, of a mischievous, lonely child who
thrives on room service and the attention of hotel staff members.
<p>
   The occasion was the beginning of a family story hour, to be
held every Saturday at 1 p.m., celebrating all things New York.
<p>
   No matter that one of the two books read had nothing to do with
any of the five boroughs. Rebecca Powell, 6, of Norwich, Conn., was
entranced by the first selection, ``The Cottage at the End of the
Lane,'' a foldout hardback by Elaine Mills.
<p>
   A cautionary tale about homelessness, greed and generosity,
cloaked in a woodsy setting, it is about an abandoned heroine,
Peggy Doll, who becomes a squatter after being rebuffed by
neighbors. She, of generous spirit and heart, gladly welcomes an
orphaned wet rabbit into her adopted home.
<p>
   ``The doll story was O.K., but the one with the girl who lived
in the hotel was best,'' Rebecca said. ``Eloise did some funny
things, like combing her hair with a fork and ordering a raisin
from room service.'' Rebecca giggled.
<p>
   ``But, my gosh, someone was smoking a cigarette in a picture,
and her room was so messy,'' she said. ``And why did they have
witch hazel and cotton for their toes?''
<p>
   Ms. Raggio was at a loss to explain that pedicure beauty tip, as
well as other perplexities that bothered Rebecca and her story
mates: Allison Samuel, 8, from Westchester County, and Madeline and
Kerry Bornstein, 7-year-old twins, of Forest Hills, Queens. Midway
through Kay Thompson's valentine to the Plaza, all four listeners
were belly down on the floor, legs crisscrossing in the air.
<p>
   ``What's a Corvette? What's a mole? Why does Eloise eat so
much?'' the youngsters asked. ``And why are you skipping words?''
Rebecca demanded, when a page thick with verbiage was quickly
turned.
<p>
   The storyteller answered: ``A Corvette is a kind of car. A mole
is a growth Nanny has on her face. Eloise didn't eat so much; she
just liked ordering room service. I skipped some words because
there's so many on the page.''
<p>
   The girls clustered around Ms. Raggio, who sat cross-legged in
front of glass display cases filled with Victorian toys and dolls.
<p>
   The museum's third-floor Toy Room is a treasure chest of doll
houses, toy boats with clockwork mechanisms, ``steadfast toy
soldiers'' frozen in battle scenes, mechanical toys from the 1920's
and fancy French lady dolls from the 1860s, made with real hair and
articulated wooden bodies.
<p>
   It is a perfect setting for turn-of-the-century stories as well
as contemporary tales of immigrants anxious for their first
sighting of Lady Liberty. Or for a story about a poorly supervised
tyke with a penchant for pique.
<p>
   The museum is a private, nonprofit educational agency
established in 1923 to collect, preserve and display original
materials related to the history of New York. Among its treasures
is a permanent, continuously updated collection tracing 125 years
of Broadway's evolution.
<p>
   The rationale behind selecting stories relating to New York and
environs was simple, a museum spokeswoman, Billie Heller Monness,
said.
<p>
   ``We started this program because we felt it would be an
appropriate and fun way to introduce children to the variety of
books with a New York theme,'' she said.
<p>
   ``There are literally hundreds of stories written with a New
York flavor or sensibility, reflective of various cultural and
ethnic groups and encompassing all the boroughs,'' she said. ``And
our story-hour program is a unique, low-key way for families to
come together and share something special.''
<p>
   The museum's yearlong program coincides with the celebration of
the centennial of Greater New York, officially beginning at
midnight on Dec. 31. It is intended to draw greater interest in the
city's history and cultural legacy.
<p>
   In keeping with that purpose, ``New York Stories'' will focus on
tales set in one of the five boroughs or written by someone with
New York roots.
<p>
   ``All the books from here on will be about New York, including
all of the surrounding boroughs,'' Ms. Heller Monness said.
Starting in January, each month's reading will highlight one
borough.
<p>
   ``All children should have the opportunity to hear about how
different people live, work and go to school,'' Ms. Heller Monness
said. ``It's fun for children to explore the diversity and ethnic
richness that makes New York so unique. And a wonderful way to do
that is through the spoken word.''
<p>
   Museum Hours
<p>
   ``New York Stories'' takes place every Saturday at 1 p.m. at the
Museum of the City of New York, on Fifth Avenue at 103d Street.
Hours are Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; Tuesdays,
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for pre-registered groups only, and Sundays, 1 to
5 p.m. Closed on Mondays and holidays. The event is free with
admission to the museum, which suggests donations of $5 for adults;
$4 for the elderly, students and children, and $10 for families.
Information: (212) 534-1672, extension 206.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japan and the U.S. will extend
talks aimed at reaching an aviation agreement to next month,
scrapping a self-imposed Sept. 30 deadline, a U.S. State Department
spokesman said.
<p>
   The two countries resumed talks in Tokyo on Monday and U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Alan Larson said today that
``significant progress'' had been made toward achieving a deal.
<p>
   The U.S. isn't ready, though, to accept restrictions on the
rights of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, Northwest Airlines Corp. and
Federal Express Corp. to fly to third countries from Japan.
<p>
   ``We want to achieve a clear, clean and permanent resolution of
disputes that have prevented our carriers from exercising their
rights to serve the important and fast growing aviation markets
beyond Japan,'' he said.
<p>
   Washington also wants assurance that new passenger and cargo
carriers can provide services to Japan if they want to.
<p>
   ``We want to ensure greatly increased opportunities for those
U.S. carriers that today are virtually shut out of the market,''
Larson said at a press briefing in Tokyo.
<p>
   Officials are still wrangling over how many more flights Japan
will allow three U.S. airlines -- Delta Air Lines Inc., AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines, and Continental Airlines Inc. -- to operate
between the two countries.
<p>
   They're also discussing the number of chartered flights each
side should be allowed to operate between Japan and the U.S., a
Japanese Transport Ministry official said.
<p>
   Negotiators will meet for two separate rounds of discussions
next month in Washington.
<p>
   Informal working group meetings will be held on ``beyond
rights'' and ``code-sharing'' on Oct. 2 and 3, and formal
negotiations will resume on the week of Oct. 20, Larson said.
<p>
   ``I would say that we are still encouraged by the progress made
during this round,'' said Richard Martin, a spokesman for United
Airlines. ``We're hopeful that the gains made by the U.S can be
extended into the forthcoming round of negotiations.''
<p>
   Yesterday, a senior Japanese Transport Ministry official said
the two countries still have many issues to resolve before they can
sign an accord.
<p>
   On Thursday, Japan refused a U.S. request to allow United Parcel
Service of America Inc. and Polar Express Corp. to operate more
flights between the two countries, said a spokesman for Japan's
Transport Ministry.
<p>
   Japan also turned down a request to increase the number of
airports the two U.S. cargo carriers can use in Japan.
<p>
   The U.S. asked Japan to allow one more U.S. cargo carrier to
operate between the two countries, which Japan also refused. The
ministry spokesman didn't name the carrier.
<p>
   Ministry of Transport Vice Minister Hiromichi Toya will meet the
press today at 2 p.m. Tokyo time.
<p>
   Under the existing 1952 aviation agreement with Japan, three
U.S. carriers -- Northwest, United Airlines and Federal Express --
have broad access to Japanese markets as well as ``beyond rights,''
the authority to pick up passengers and cargo in Japan and carry
them on to third-countries in Asia.
<p>
   The U.S. wants an agreement that would give all U.S. carriers
greater opportunities to fly U.S.-Japan routes. In exchange, the
U.S. would allow All Nippon Airways greater access to U.S. markets.
<p>
   `` I think during formal negotiations there is some posturing,''
said Martin of United. ``So I think, regardless of what we may hear
in the press, progress has been made. We realize there are still
obstacles, but we're confident they'll be overcome.''
<p>
   Even last week, U.S. administration officials were signaling
they might have to abandon the Sept. 30 deadline for a new pact.
``Time is not really the issue,'' the State Department's Larson
told reporters in Paris last week. ``It's whether there is a
political commitment on both sides to reach a deal.''
<p>
   Some analysts predicted last week that given the issues still
unresolved -- including whether Japan will limit carriers' beyond
rights and the provision of adequate access to Japanese airports --
it was doubtful a new pact would be signed this week.
<p>
   One industry official said it was in the best interest of the
U.S. to extend the deadline.
<p>
   ``I think they ought to think this through and not rush'' to get
a deal, said Dennis Mollura, a spokesman for Northwest. ``The U.S.
has a lot to lose.''
<p>
   While all the other U.S. airlines urged the U.S. government to
cut a deal that would allow regulated expansion of the air travel
market between the two countries, Northwest urged the U.S. to hold
out for a fully open agreement, with no limits on beyond flights.
<p>
   Northwest has hub operations in Tokyo and Osaka and is concerned
that caps on flights to destinations in Asia beyond Japan would
hamper its competitiveness.

 &UR; SURVEY NOTES RISING RATES OF HIV, GONORRHEA AMONG URBAN GAY
AND &LR;  &UR; BISEXUAL MEN &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By DAVID PERLMAN &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  In a new and ominous signal linking sexually
transmitted diseases to AIDS, a national survey of major American
cities shows rising rates of gonorrhea and HIV infection among gay
and bisexual men. &HT;    The news came as a sobering counterpoint to recent optimism that
powerful new drugs have begun eliminating disease symptoms and
lowering the death rate among AIDS patients.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In addition, authorities reported just last week the first drop
in the number of new HIV infections since the AIDS epidemic began.
<p>
   But gonorrhea is staging a comeback around the nation, and that
includes San Francisco, according to a report released yesterday by
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
<p>
   The lesson is clear, say AIDS specialists: Risky sexual behavior
is increasing again among some groups of men, and the increase in
sexually transmitted diseases  &MD;  known as STDs  &MD;  is serving as a
``sentinel'' to warn that new infections by the AIDS virus are sure
to increase, too.
<p>
   The disease control agency, which has been surveying gonorrhea
and its link to AIDS in 26 American cities, found that in San
Francisco, the number of gonorrhea cases among men having sex with
men increased by 24 percent from 1994 to 1995, and by 34 percent
more last year. The evidence is particularly striking among
patients reporting to the city clinic from the Castro District,
according to the report.
<p>
   Even greater increases in sexually transmitted disease rates
have hit Seattle and Portland, and increases have also been
detected in San Diego, Long Beach, Honolulu, Denver and Orange
County, the new study shows. Details of the federal survey are
being officially announced today in the CDC's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report.
<p>
   The same report showed that in the clinics where numbers of
gonorrhea infections are high, at least one quarter of the men with
the disease also tested positive for HIV infection.
<p>
   In San Francisco, Robert Kohn, the city's epidemiologist for
sexually transmitted diseases, said that although gonorrhea rates
appear to have reached a plateau so far this year, the increase in
the previous two years is striking.
<p>
   He attributed the trend to several causes. Improvements in the
condition of many men with AIDS taking combination drug therapies
may have convinced some men that the worst of the AIDS epidemic is
over, Kohn said.
<p>
   And in other cases, he added, younger men may simply be failing
to heed warnings about the need to avoid risky sexual behavior.
<p>
   It is unclear whether men newly diagnosed with gonorrhea were
already infected with the AIDS virus, or whether their gonorrhea
made them fall prey to HIV infection more easily, Kohn said.
<p>
   ``Whatever the reasons, the lessons of safe sex need to be
brought home again and again,'' Kohn said. ``This is not the time
to quit.''
<p>
   Health workers battling the AIDS epidemic have become optimistic
lately as nationwide reports have shown that the number of deaths
associated with AIDS dropped 23 percent in 1996 and that the number
of newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in teenagers and adults declined
by 6 percent.
<p>
   But infection with gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted
diseases can increase the risk of new HIV infections ``at least
two- to five-fold,'' according to Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
CDC's center for prevention of STDs, AIDS and tuberculosis.
<p>
   The microbe that causes gonorrhea increases the concentration of
HIV in semen, she explained, and thereby increases the likelihood
of transmitting the AIDS virus during any type of intercourse. The
risk is particularly strong during oral-anal contact, Gayle said.
<p>
   ``It's very disturbing to see cities where a resurgence of STDs
is occurring and where so many people seem to be going back to
high-risk sexual behaviors'' Gayle said in an interview. ``AIDS
prevention obviously can't be a one-shot business, and this is a
real scary trend.''
<p>
   What's particularly alarming, she said, is that the recent
decrease in new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths has been most striking
among gay and bisexual men, among whom the lessons of safe sex have
been most effective.
<p>
   But now the newly found association between new gonorrhea
infections and new HIV infections is a ``harbinger of things to
come,'' Gayle said. ``We need better screening for all the STDs,''
Gayle said, ``and we need to redouble our efforts at controlling
the spread of sexually transmitted disease. We've got to remember
that STDs pose a major threat to everyone  &MD;  both by themselves and
because of their connection to AIDS.'' &LR;

   JERUSALEM  &MD;  His aides say robustly that ``he is as strong as a
horse,'' but since Yasser Arafat injured his head when his plane
crashed in a sandstorm in Libya in 1992 he has suffered from
blackouts.
<p>
   In recent weeks, as the stalemate in negotiations with Israel
continues, he has looked increasingly haggard and depressed.
<p>
   If Arafat does die, he has no obvious successor as either
Palestinian leader or national symbol. Even at the nadir of his
fortunes, after his expulsion from Beirut by Israel in 1982,

ANDERSON MOVING UP &QL;

<p>
   It began as an experiment, one mandated by yet another Angels
injury in this season of failed hopes.
<p>
   When Darin Erstad wrenched his shoulder diving for a ball
earlier this month, manager Terry Collins surveyed his shrinking
list of healthy bodies and, on a whim, decided to move left fielder
Garret Anderson well up in the lineup  &MD;  from his customary sixth
spot to third.
<p>
   The returns have since been so favorable that this decision just
might take hold for next year, especially if the Angels are forced
to lead Erstad off.
<p>
   ``He gets the bat on the ball. I think that's the key,'' hitting
instructor Rod Carew said of Anderson, the former star athlete at
Kennedy High School. ``You can hit-and-run with him. If you get a
runner on second base he can pull the ball. If people are in
scoring position, he's shown that he can drive them in.
<p>
   ``He keeps himself under control for a young hitter. That's very
important. He's decided that he'll hit the ball hard, and whatever
happens, happens.''
<p>
   What has happened lately is a great deal of production, such
that Anderson has moved into an exclusive Angels club.
<p>
   With a 3-for-5 effort in Thursday night's 8-5 loss to the Texas
Rangers at Anaheim Stadium, Anderson's hit total for the season
climbed to 186, moving him into a tie for third place on the club's
all-time list. With three games remaining, he has no hope of
overtaking the franchise leader  &MD;  Alex Johnson, who had 202 hits in
1970  &MD;  but Anderson, at age 25, has certainly caught the attention
of Angels management.
<p>
   In nine games as the No. 3 hitter, he has batted .465 (20 for
43), with 10 RBI, four doubles, one home run and six runs scored.
<p>
   ``When you bat sixth or seventh in the lineup, like I have been
all year, you don't have the luxury of someone batting behind you
like Tim Salmon or Jim Edmonds,'' said Anderson. ``When you have
somebody (behind you) that the pitchers worry about giving up a
home run to, they have to pitch to you a little more. I wouldn't
say you get more fastballs, but you get more pitches in the strike
zone.''
<p>
   After hitting 16 home runs in 106 games as a rookie in 1995, the
natural assumption was that he would bump that up to the mid-20s
with a full season. But Anderson may have tried to rush the
process, such that he turned on the ball even when pitchers began
working him away, and let an uppercut creep into that naturally
sweet swing of his.
<p>
   Last year, his average dropped, his strikeouts mounted, and his
home-run total dipped to 12. He currently has eight homers, but no
one is complaining. ``I believe as he learns to do this, he's going
to hit with power in the future,'' said manager Terry Collins. ``He
made adjustments because pitchers changed the way they were
pitching him. He decided he's willing to take base hits.''
<p>
   Stinging and productive base hits, though. Anderson has driven
in a career-high 90 runs and pounded out 33 doubles. He's also
closing in on a .300 season in only his second full year in the
major leagues  &MD;  .304 entering the final weekend.
<p>
   ``I've been geared more to being a hitter,'' Anderson said.
``Once you prove you can hit up here, they let you stay up here.
I'm not really worried about the power side of it.''
<p>
   Carew is starting to give it thought, though. Maybe it has
something to do with that prodigious output Anderson has delivered
while positioned high in the batting order.
<p>
   ``The whole year he has really kept his head on the ball,''
Carew said. ``I think now he's ready to move on to the next stage  &MD; 
swinging with more power, getting more lift on the ball.''
<p>
   And perhaps giving the Angels an important offensive boost in
the bargain.

 &UR; INDONESIA MAY REVOKE LICENSES OF 14 COMPANIES ON FIRES ISSUE &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Jakarta, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Indonesia threatened to revoke
licenses of 14 agricultural companies in relation to forest fires
on the islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra that have covered most of
neighboring Malaysia and Singapore in a smoggy haze.
<p>
   The companies -- whose names were not reveled -- would lose
their licenses if they're found guilty of torching their land, the
Minister of Agriculture Syarifudin Baharsjah said after meeting
with President Suharto.
<p>
   Fires are set deliberately each year by plantation owners to
clear the land of tree stumps, brush and shrubbery in an
inexpensive way. The practice -- long a contentious issue with
Indonesia's neighbors -- has blown into a full-fledged disaster
this year as the El Nino weather pattern-created drought has spread
the fire, leaving it raging for days and sending up clouds of gray
smoke. The drought is one of the worst Indonesia has faced in about
50 years.
<p>
   The smoke has sent thousands of people in the region to
hospitals with respiratory problems. It has begun to hurt business.
<p>
   With alerts going out to travelers in the U.S., Europe,
Australia and Hong Kong, the region's well over $15 billion tourism
industry could be hurt, analysts said.
<p>
   ``It's not just bad for the environment, it's bad for economic
growth,'' as flights are canceled, working-hours lost and business
activity slows, said Bruce Gale, regional manager at Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy in Singapore, which assesses political
and economic risk. ``Tourism is a vital part of the economy.''
<p>
   Indonesia has mobilized its military to fight the fires.
Malaysia has sent 1,400 firefighter to assist Indonesia in ending
the fires.
<p>
   Still, the extra fighters, weeks of debate on how to handle the
problem have yielded few concrete results Indonesia said today of
the 173 companies thought to be involved in setting the fires, only
76 have reported back to the government. Of those, 23 said they had
burnt land, 14 were strongly suspected of it, seven said they
hadn't, three companies said fires spread from outside, one said it
had no fires, and 23 didn't provide enough information.

<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  A floating nuclear power station  &MD;  the world's first  &MD; 
is to be built by Russia in the Arctic, despite concern about the
damage to the region inflicted by years of atomic-weapons testing,
the reckless dumping and storage of radioactive materials, and
fallout from the Chernobyl disaster.
<p>
   The Russian government has confirmed it plans to locate the
plant on a vessel in Pevek, a remote and sparsely populated port
town in Russia's Far East, 215 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
<p>
   The $254 million station will be powered by two
pressurized-water reactors adapted from Russian nuclear-powered
icebreakers, a fleet which has long been cited by Western safety
experts as a source of severe environmental threat.
<p>
   Every 13 years the plant will be towed by barge to Murmansk,
near the Finnish border  &MD;  a journey of 2,500 miles, which will take
it from one end of Russia to the other  &MD;  for a refit and to reload
with fuel.
<p>
   The project drew immediate condemnation from Greenpeace in
Moscow. ``This is very threatening to the environment,'' said
Andrei Simyonov, a spokesman. ``Any nuclear waste that ends up in
the sea will be distributed more quickly than on the earth
itself.''
<p>
   The plan is certain to arouse fears about what would happen if
the power plant sank. It would not be the first vessel laden with
radioactive material to do so; in 1989 the Soviet nuclear submarine
Komsomolets went down in the sea 300 miles off Norway after a fire
on board.
<p>
   It had nuclear fuel in its reactor and nuclear warheads on
board, but both Russian and international surveys found no evidence
of substantial contamination.
<p>
   The Pevet project comes amid international anxiety about
Russia's nuclear-power program, which has been reactivated after
coming to a standstill following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster.
<p>
   Western and Russian scientists are alarmed about the lack of
safety standards in Russia's nuclear fleet (it has more than 200
nuclear-powered submarines) and within its 99 nuclear facilities,
including 29 nuclear power stations.
<p>
   Aging and inadequate equipment, dangerous storage, a lack of
safety consciousness and an absence of effective independent
regulatory bodies top the list of concerns.
<p>
   So does the lack of funds; in July, nuclear workers from four
power stations grew so desperate about pay arrears that they
marched to Moscow from the Smolensk nuclear power plant, a 400-mile
journey that took two weeks.
<p>
   Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) says the floating
station has been approved by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
<p>
   It argues the plant is needed to replace a far more costly,
40-year-old coal-powered station, for which 100,000 tons of coal
have to be shipped in every year.
<p>
   The fact that the region it will mostly supply, Chukotka, is
rapidly depopulating has not derailed the plan; in the past four
years half the 12,300 population of Pevek have left.
<p>
   The Russians  &MD;  who have been fiercely criticized for dumping
nuclear reactors and other radioactive waste in the Kara and
Barents Seas and the Sea of Japan  &MD;  say spent nuclear fuel will be
kept on board the floating station, and not dumped.
<p>
   Such assurances may not convince environmentalists worried by
the level of pollution in the Arctic, which has been contaminated
by nuclear weapons tests, releases from nuclear fuel reprocessing
plants and Chernobyl fallout.
<p>
   This year, a report commissioned by eight Arctic nations,
including Russia, warned that the region's ecological system was
far more vulnerable to radioactive contamination than elsewhere.
<p>
   It identified a ``large number'' of radioactive sources in the
region, including storage of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioned
nuclear submarines and nuclear reactors.
<p>
   The Russians say the Pevet station  &MD;  which is to stand in the
east Siberian Sea  &MD;  is the first of its kind. It may not be the
last; if they can raise the money they want to build two more.
<p>
   Claims by Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, that
Russia has lost track of scores of tactical nuclear weapons were
partly supported earlier this month by his former deputy.
<p>
   Vladimir Denisov, an ex-deputy head of the Security Council,
said an investigation last year had been unable to rule out that
small nuclear bombs were left behind in former Soviet republics.

   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  There were days when Cal running back Tarik Smith
crawled out of the weight room on his hands and knees, his legs too
numb to support himself and his arms shaking with fatigue.
<p>
   But he wasn't too tired to throw a few choice words in the
direction of Bears trainer Mike Chaplin, cursing at him with
language only a sailor could appreciate and swearing over and over
he was through with rehabilitation and finished with football.
<p>
   ``Called me every name in the book and then some,'' Chaplin
recalled. ``But the next morning he'd come back and we'd do it all
over again.''
<p>
   And again. And again. And again.
<p>
   Eight months. Seven days a week. Three hours a day. Nothing but
sweat, pain and misery. All because Smith, who played at Oak Park
High School, refused to allow a devastating knee injury in 1996 be
the final memory of his college football career.
<p>
   One year later, Smith has returned. He played in Cal's first
game against Houston, but truly came back last week against
Oklahoma when he rushed for 90 yards on 20 carries. The bulk of
that production came in the second half after Smith told himself it
was time to put the injury behind him and stop playing tentatively.
<p>
   ``I made some hard cuts,'' said Smith, who will lead the Bears
against USC on Saturday at 4 p.m. ``I got through it and my knee
isn't an issue anymore. All I want to do now is play football. The
mission now is to win the Rose Bowl.''
!zapf!q &UR; !off! &LR;  &HT;    A million thoughts ran through Smith's mind as he lay on the
turf at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley last Sept. 21. Moments before,
he heard a grotesque popping sound in his right knee and felt a
sharp, piercing pain shoot through his leg after getting sandwiched
between a Cal offensive lineman and a University of Nevada tackler.
<p>
   Smith, blessed with speed (4.35 in the 40), athletic ability (a
school-record 41-inch vertical leap) and strength (335-pound bench
press), enjoyed a Heisman-type season up until his injury. He had
rushed for 400 yards and four touchdowns on 50 carries in victories
over San Jose State and San Diego State. In the Bay Area, people
were talking about a Pacific-10 championship and spending New
Year's day in Pasadena.
<p>
   But then Smith got hurt. A season that began with such promise
unraveled in an instant.
<p>
   ``I remember looking up in the sky. I remember seeing the
clouds,'' said Smith, who knew immediately that the injury was
serious, perhaps career-threatening.
<p>
   A few days later he was diagnosed with complete tears of the
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments.
<p>
   ``I was in shock, disbelief,'' Smith said. ``I had never been
injured below my waist before. For a running back, it's the worst
kind of injury.''
<p>
   Rehabilitation began one day after reconstructive surgery, when
Smith attached a machine to his leg to stretch the knee back and
forth. A few weeks later, under the close scrutiny of Chaplin,
Smith started leg bends and squatting exercises. The next step was
working on a slide board and on his upper body, so his chest and
arms would not atrophy.
<p>
   The workouts were the toughest, most excruciating of Smith's
life and took a tremendous toll mentally. Every step forward was
followed by another in the opposite direction. Some days playing
football again seemed within reach. On others, Smith felt he had a
better chance of being elected president. More than once, he
thought of giving up.
<p>
   Chaplin was there to offer support.
<p>
   ``He would reach peaks, but then experience valleys, which is
normal in a situation like this,'' Chaplin said. ``So it was
important that he set goals and meet them in terms of having
success and building confidence. You meet your goals for today,
which helps you meet your weekly goals and then your monthly goals
and then everything else begins to fall into place.''
<p>
   As difficult as rehabilitation was, nothing could prepare Smith
for the despair he experienced when he watched Cal suffer without
him.
<p>
   The lowest point was a 21-18 loss to Washington State in which
the Bears managed only 44 yards rushing. Any thoughts of playing in
the Rose Bowl ended that day. Smith felt helpless.
<p>
   ``The hardest thing in life is watching your teammates
practice,'' Smith said. ``I thought about quitting football. I
thought I was a failure.''
<p>
   Instead of quitting, Smith decided to use the negative energy to
fuel his intensity during rehabilitation. He attacked every new
goal as if it were an opposing linebacker. When Chaplin demanded
200 squats, Smith would deliver 400. When somebody told him he was
foolish to believe he could return in time for spring practice,
Smith worked even harder to prove them wrong.
<p>
   In April, Smith was on the field with the rest of the team in
non-contact drills. He even shocked himself by jumping a
school-record 43.5 inches during the vertical leap test. Even
though the jump was disallowed because part of Smith's foot landed
off the mat, Smith had made his point.
<p>
   ``Right then, I knew I was back,'' he said.
!zapf!q &UR; !off! &LR;  &HT;    The first test in pads took place at training camp in August.
During one scrimmage, Smith ran for 83 yards and a touchdown and
caught a 42-yard pass. He was darting, making people miss and
exploding past defenders as if his knee had never been a twisted
mess.
<p>
   Chaplin, who Smith credits for his return, watched with pride
but refused to accept praise.
<p>
   ``All I did was come up with a master plan,'' he said. ``Tarik
had to want to do it and that's what he did. In my mind, he's the
best athlete I've ever been associated with. Hopefully that will be
proven over the long term when he goes on to play professionally,
if that's what he chooses to do.''
<p>
   Smith was tentative in the Bears' season-opener against Houston.
With a bulky brace strapped to his leg, he ran for only 29 yards.
<p>
   He abandoned the brace against Houston and rushed for 75 yards
in the second half after a slow start.
<p>
   During halftime, Smith vowed he would finally put the injury
behind him and play with authority.
<p>
   ``I felt normal, and that's a great feeling,'' Smith said. ``No
more thinking about the injury, or worrying about it or playing
soft. I just played football and contributed and that's all I'm
going to concentrate on the rest of the season. Playing ball and
winning the Rose Bowl.'' &UR; !end! &LR;

<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  A floating nuclear power station  &MD;  the world's first  &MD; 
is to be built by Russia in the Arctic, despite concern about the
damage to the region inflicted by years of atomic-weapons testing,
the reckless dumping and storage of radioactive materials, and
fallout from the Chernobyl disaster.
<p>
   The Russian government has confirmed it plans to locate the
plant on a vessel in Pevek, a remote and sparsely populated port
town in Russia's Far East, 215 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
<p>
   The $254 million station will be powered by two
pressurized-water reactors adapted from Russian nuclear-powered
icebreakers, a fleet which has long been cited by Western safety
experts as a source of severe environmental threat.
<p>
   Every 13 years the plant will be towed by barge to Murmansk,
near the Finnish border  &MD;  a journey of 2,500 miles, which will take
it from one end of Russia to the other  &MD;  for a refit and to reload
with fuel.
<p>
   The project drew immediate condemnation from Greenpeace in
Moscow. ``This is very threatening to the environment,'' said
Andrei Simyonov, a spokesman. ``Any nuclear waste that ends up in
the sea will be distributed more quickly than on the earth
itself.''
<p>
   The plan is certain to arouse fears about what would happen if
the power plant sank. It would not be the first vessel laden with
radioactive material to do so; in 1989 the Soviet nuclear submarine
Komsomolets went down in the sea 300 miles off Norway after a fire
on board.
<p>
   It had nuclear fuel in its reactor and nuclear warheads on
board, but both Russian and international surveys found no evidence
of substantial contamination.
<p>
   The Pevet project comes amid international anxiety about
Russia's nuclear-power program, which has been reactivated after
coming to a standstill following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster.
<p>
   Western and Russian scientists are alarmed about the lack of
safety standards in Russia's nuclear fleet (it has more than 200
nuclear-powered submarines) and within its 99 nuclear facilities,
including 29 nuclear power stations.
<p>
   Aging and inadequate equipment, dangerous storage, a lack of
safety consciousness and an absence of effective independent
regulatory bodies top the list of concerns.
<p>
   So does the lack of funds; in July, nuclear workers from four
power stations grew so desperate about pay arrears that they
marched to Moscow from the Smolensk nuclear power plant, a 400-mile
journey that took two weeks.
<p>
   Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) says the floating
station has been approved by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
<p>
   It argues the plant is needed to replace a far more costly,
40-year-old coal-powered station, for which 100,000 tons of coal
have to be shipped in every year.
<p>
   The fact that the region it will mostly supply, Chukotka, is
rapidly depopulating has not derailed the plan; in the past four
years half the 12,300 population of Pevek have left.
<p>
   The Russians  &MD;  who have been fiercely criticized for dumping
nuclear reactors and other radioactive waste in the Kara and
Barents Seas and the Sea of Japan  &MD;  say spent nuclear fuel will be
kept on board the floating station, and not dumped.
<p>
   Such assurances may not convince environmentalists worried by
the level of pollution in the Arctic, which has been contaminated
by nuclear weapons tests, releases from nuclear fuel reprocessing
plants and Chernobyl fallout.
<p>
   This year, a report commissioned by eight Arctic nations,
including Russia, warned that the region's ecological system was
far more vulnerable to radioactive contamination than elsewhere.
<p>
   It identified a ``large number'' of radioactive sources in the
region, including storage of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioned
nuclear submarines and nuclear reactors.
<p>
   The Russians say the Pevet station  &MD;  which is to stand in the
east Siberian Sea  &MD;  is the first of its kind. It may not be the
last; if they can raise the money they want to build two more.
<p>
   Claims by Russia's former security chief, Alexander Lebed, that
Russia has lost track of scores of tactical nuclear weapons were
partly supported earlier this month by his former deputy.
<p>
   Vladimir Denisov, an ex-deputy head of the Security Council,
said an investigation last year had been unable to rule out that
small nuclear bombs were left behind in former Soviet republics.

   SMILING GIANTS NEAR FINISH LINE
BY NANCY GAY &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  One by one, they have exhaled. Throughout the
team, the tension has lifted and even the most stern, businesslike
Giants  &MD;  the gritty Jeff Kent, the intense Roberto Hernandez  &MD;  have
dropped their guards and allowed themselves to enjoy where they
are, how close they've come.
<p>
   ``We stay close, we're gonna win,'' said Hernandez, his
confidence bolstered by his team's uncanny ability to prevail in 61
of their 103 games decided by three runs or less. ``We believe it.
You go into the playoffs, you have to believe it.''
<p>
   ``We're in this for the ring,'' Kent said, breaking into a huge
smile. ``And you sacrifice everything you can for that.''
<p>
   The National League West title is well within their reach, and
the magic combination is two.
<p>
   A Giants' win. A Dodgers' loss.
<p>
   ``It gives (the Dodgers) more to think about, or I sure hope
so,'' said catcher Brian Johnson, who has done more to knock out
Los Angeles the past week than even he could have envisioned. His
12th-inning shot that defeated the Dodgers 6-4 on September 18 and
his ninth-inning homer that silenced the Rockies 4-3 on Wednesday
were fantasies come true.
<p>
   Who doesn't wish he could deliver the game-winning homer, to the
hugs of teammates and the admiration of the masses?
<p>
   ``I imagine this in my dreams every night when I go to bed, but
that's the easy part,'' Johnson said. ``The hard part is turning it
into reality.''
<p>
   That, in a nutshell, could explain it all.
<p>
   These are grown men living out their dreams, which have been
transformed into reality by the depth of their commitment and their
distaste for failure. Given up for dead even before they finished
their work in spring training, the Giants are on the brink of
validating what they've sincerely believed since the group came
together in February.
<p>
   ``That early in the year, nobody can predict how a team can
play, but people like to predict  &MD;  `Oh, they're going to be in last
place, they're going to be in first place.' The only people who can
believe in you is yourself, and this team had a lot of that,'' said
Kent, his eyes fighting the glare from a mass of TV lights.
<p>
   It's only fitting, after a brutal month that saw the Giants lose
and regain the NL West lead, that the finish line has been drawn at
3Com Park. Tonight, before an expected sellout crowd, they can lay
their hands on the title and spread the wealth and their joy to
their fans.
<p>
   ``I think everybody was hoping it would be decided at home,''
said closer Rod Beck, whose 37 saves account for more than a third
of the Giants' wins this season. ``That's how it should be,
really.''
<p>
   Yet despite all the excitement, the work isn't done. The Padres
aren't in town to cooperate with the Giants' party plans.
<p>
   ``First of all, we've got to get there,'' said manager Dusty
Baker, whose focus has been sidetracked by something he hates to do
 &MD;  look ahead. The past week, the Giants' brain trust has decided on
the major players to be included on the 25-man playoff roster. The
position players are all but finalized, but there are pitching jobs
are still to be won over the weekend.
<p>
   ``I've got some things in my mind, but that ain't primary. The
primary thing on my mind is to get there  &MD;  to cross that finish
line first,'' Baker said. ``When we cross the finish line, then
we'll start the next race.''
<p>
   Sometime Friday, a missing but central figure in the Giants'
success will return to his team after a two-week absence,
shouldering burdens the others cannot really understand. Pitcher
Mark Gardner, the veteran 12-game winner, has learned his wife,
Lori, has liver cancer.
<p>
   When the champagne corks take flight, Gardner deserves to be
there.
<p>
   When the celebrations begin, the Giants deserve every accolade
they can get.
<p>
   Is it destiny, or ``Dustiny,'' as Beck dubbed it?
<p>
   ``People talk about teams of destiny,'' said J.T. Snow, who hit
his 28th home run Wednesday. ``Well, I don't know if we're a team
of destiny, but I do know we're a team of guys who have fought all
year no matter the circumstances.
<p>
   ``Just look at what (Brian Johnson) did, and you'll understand
us.''

   Sanford Wallace is a hunted man. He's only being hunted through
the Internet, which might seem like some respite. But as that's the
medium through which he makes his money, he is in a rather
difficult position. Every time he tries to do his work, he gets
shut down.
<p>
   Last Friday, one of the biggest groups running the ``backbone''
of the Internet, Apex Global Internet Services (Agis), cut off
Wallace's Internet connection, citing ``outstanding security
issues.''
<p>
   It was the culmination of months of pressure from other Internet
users, who complained that by giving Wallace's company Cyberpromo
an Internet connection, Agis was complicit in ``spamming''  &MD;  also
known as ``junk e-mailing.''
<p>
   (The term ``spam'' comes from the Monty Python restaurant sketch
in which spam features in everything on a menu; to net users, it
became synonymous with something unavoidable and excessive.)
<p>
   Wallace, a beefy white East Coast would-be entrepreneur in his
mid-20s, is the self-anointed, self-appointed ``Spam King'' of the
Internet: a man who has so annoyed many companies which offer
connection to the Internet that they have taken his company
Cyberpromo to court.
<p>
   He claims he has the future of commerce. Sending millions of
e-mails costs almost nothing, especially compared to sending
physical junk mail. (However, the receiver has to pay for the
telephone connection charges.)
<p>
   Opponents, including those who run Internet systems, and
thousands of users, think his methods could bring the net to its
knees.
<p>
   One issue that has never been clear is whether anyone ever makes
money through spammed e-mail schemes  &MD;  apart from companies like
Cyberpromo which hire their e-mailing lists and facilities.
<p>
   Both AOL and CompuServe took the legal route because Cyberpromo
was sending their members about two million e-mails every day,
advertising all sorts of mostly useless and sometimes illegal
services (including pyramid schemes).
<p>
   On an average day, Cyberpromo would send out 15 to 20 million
e-mails. Some systems collapsed under that weight of work  &MD;  hence
AOL's and Compuserve's lawsuits, which they won.
<p>
   Many other people who received Cyberpromo e-mails took matter
into their own hands. Their complaints included e-mail firestorms
known as ``denial of service'' attacks, which could also make a
system impossible to use.
<p>
   AGIS suffered from those after Wallace joined them last October,
having been kicked off the Net by Sprint Corporation; he had joined
Sprint in June 1996 from WorldCom of Jackson, Miss.
<p>
   Despite last week's setbacks, Wallace hasn't given up. In the
past few days he has reactivated machines which in the past few
months he had quietly hired with other service providers.
<p>
   He has used those over the weekend to spam again  &MD;  and almost
instantly they've been shut down as the spam is tracked back to its
source.
<p>
   Part of the resentment is because Cyberpromo does not target
willing or even interested addressees, but gathers names by using
``extractor'' software to grab e-mail addresses from the Internet's
thousands of news discussion groups and millions of Web pages.
<p>
   Internet users started using ``spam'' as a verb in 1994, and
though Wallace didn't appear until late 1995, he liked the title
enough to registering the domain of ``spamford.com.''
<p>
   Unfortunately, even that has backfired. Hormel, the makers of
the physical version of spam  &MD;  a meat product  &MD;  are also suing
Wallace for denigrating their trademark.

BAKER'S BEEN A BELIEVER ALL ALONG &QL; 
BY TIM KEOWN &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Dusty Baker doesn't see the miracle. He doesn't see a shred of
incongruity in anything that has happened over the past six months.
Improbable? Unbelievable? Unthinkable? That line of reasoning only
shows you haven't been paying attention.
<p>
   The Giants are standing on the thin edge of a division
championship  &MD;  they can clinch it tonight, against the Padres  &MD;  and
Baker has believed it all along. He has believed it publicly and he
has believed it privately. He has believed it with 8,000 people in
the stands, and he has believed it in front of a full house.
<p>
   In fact, it's Baker's job to believe.
<p>
   So much of managing a baseball team is confidence. It isn't
personal confidence, because a manager can believe in himself to
the point of stubbornness and it isn't going to be worth a single
out in the grand scheme.
<p>
   The key is possessing transferable confidence, confidence that
runs in tributaries throughout the clubhouse, out of the dugout and
onto the field. To make the great player great is not the trick;
the trick is to make the average player believe he is great, so
that maybe, just maybe, his performance will exceed his talents.
<p>
   Look around  &MD;  Stan Javier, Bill Mueller, Jose Vizcaino, Jeff
Kent. See any cases where faith has superseded logic? Through 50
games, J.T. Snow was a singles hitter with a good glove. Now he has
100 RBIs and maybe a few second-tier MVP votes. And how about Brian
Johnson  &MD;  from Triple-A Toledo to center stage, where's the
precedent for heroics in his career?
<p>
   Baker's entire game is confidence. He plays hunches. He takes
chances. He believes Marvin Benard is going to get that clutch
pinch hit, so Marvin has no choice but to believe the same thing.
<p>
   Sometimes you look at the way Baker works his bullpen and you
can't help but think there's an orthopedic surgeon in the
background, rubbing his hands and sharpening his scalpel. But look
now, with three games left in the season, and the Giants' bullpen
is somehow in pretty good shape for next week.
<p>
   Baker doesn't always follow custom and norm, and neither does
his team. Does anyone really think the Giants would be preparing
for the playoffs if Baker had done everything all year  &MD;  from the
bullpen to the batting order  &MD;  according to the standards
established by the Bill Russells and Bruce Bochys of the world?
<p>
   Answer this one honestly: Pretend Baker was the manager of the
Dodgers; do you think the Giants would be doing much more than
playing out the string right now?
<p>
   You can apply the standards of by-the-book baseball to the
Atlanta Braves and win 95 games. But if you apply those same
standards to a team like the Giants, a team that needs a little
extra, and the only thing you're doing is wishing you had better
players.
<p>
   It helps to be cool, of course, and no manager going has brought
the same kind of cool to the job. Do you think anyone was ever
tempted to give Bobby Cox a nickname like ``Dr. Scald''?
<p>
   (One distant memory of cool: Before a game two years ago, when
the Giants were not a team that merited unswerving belief, Baker
listened to the music coming from the clubhouse stereo and decided
he had had enough.
<p>
   Something was ratcheting through the speakers, something hideous
and inexcusable. Baker walked through the clubhouse and cut the
music. Conversation stopped. Dressing stopped. Socks were left
dangling in mid-pull.
<p>
   ``That ain't hittin' music,'' Baker said.
<p>
   He pulled out a Bob Marley's ``Legends'' and hit play. He turned
and walked back toward his office, his gait keeping time with the
reggae beat, and about halfway back to the office, just as Bob
started crooning, Baker lifted his head and said, ``Now (begin
ital) that  &MD;  that's (end ital) hittin' music.'')
<p>
   Two weeks ago Barry Bonds made some statements critical of
Baker. He said the manager never says nice things about him, even
though Bonds has carried the team around like an overloaded
backpack.
<p>
   What did Baker say? Nothing. He shrugged it off. He didn't lash
back at Bonds, because he knew that would have alienated the one
guy he needed most, at the time he most needed him. And he didn't
prepare an essay of public praise for Bonds, because the other
players would have interpreted that as weakness.
<p>
   No, he let Bonds go. Since then . . . well, coincidence or not,
since then has been one continuous line drive.
<p>
   Roberto Hernandez is looking at untold millions as a free agent,
and he isn't used to pitching two innings here and 12/3 there. He
was a one-inning guy, who got up a half-inning before he was to
pitch and walked right to the mound. Now he has to warm up and
wait, warm up and wait, then go in.
<p>
   He doesn't care. He's selling out for his new team. He's bought
the whole aura.
<p>
   And Rod Beck, after a few tense moments early in the Hernandez
saga, is now sliding into a perfect angle of repose for the
dual-closer playoffs. He's even leading the charge for Baker,
dubbing the team's fate ``Dustiny'' after Sunday's win in San
Diego.
<p>
   And as for the personal stuff? Hey, Beck will get his, Hernandez
will get his and the beer will always be cold.
<p>
   Magic? Not according to Baker, who will tell you that true
believers believe in everything but miracles.

   Sanford Wallace is a hunted man. He's only being hunted through
the Internet, which might seem like some respite. But as that's the
medium through which he makes his money, he is in a rather
difficult position. Every time he tries to do his work, he gets
shut down.
<p>
   Last Friday, one of the biggest groups running the ``backbone''
of the Internet, Apex Global Internet Services (Agis), cut off
Wallace's Internet connection, citing ``outstanding security
issues.''
<p>
   It was the culmination of months of pressure from other Internet
users, who complained that by giving Wallace's company Cyberpromo
an Internet connection, Agis was complicit in ``spamming''  &MD;  also
known as ``junk e-mailing.''
<p>
   (The term ``spam'' comes from the Monty Python restaurant sketch
in which spam features in everything on a menu; to net users, it
became synonymous with something unavoidable and excessive.)
<p>
   Wallace, a beefy white East Coast would-be entrepreneur in his
mid-20s, is the self-anointed, self-appointed ``Spam King'' of the
Internet: a man who has so annoyed many companies which offer
connection to the Internet that they have taken his company
Cyberpromo to court.
<p>
   He claims he has the future of commerce. Sending millions of
e-mails costs almost nothing, especially compared to sending
physical junk mail. (However, the receiver has to pay for the
telephone connection charges.)
<p>
   Opponents, including those who run Internet systems, and
thousands of users, think his methods could bring the net to its
knees.
<p>
   One issue that has never been clear is whether anyone ever makes
money through spammed e-mail schemes  &MD;  apart from companies like
Cyberpromo which hire their e-mailing lists and facilities.
<p>
   Both AOL and CompuServe took the legal route because Cyberpromo
was sending their members about two million e-mails every day,
advertising all sorts of mostly useless and sometimes illegal
services (including pyramid schemes).
<p>
   On an average day, Cyberpromo would send out 15 to 20 million
e-mails. Some systems collapsed under that weight of work  &MD;  hence
AOL's and Compuserve's lawsuits, which they won.
<p>
   Many other people who received Cyberpromo e-mails took matter
into their own hands. Their complaints included e-mail firestorms
known as ``denial of service'' attacks, which could also make a
system impossible to use.
<p>
   AGIS suffered from those after Wallace joined them last October,
having been kicked off the Net by Sprint Corporation; he had joined
Sprint in June 1996 from WorldCom of Jackson, Miss.
<p>
   Despite last week's setbacks, Wallace hasn't given up. In the
past few days he has reactivated machines which in the past few
months he had quietly hired with other service providers.
<p>
   He has used those over the weekend to spam again  &MD;  and almost
instantly they've been shut down as the spam is tracked back to its
source.
<p>
   Part of the resentment is because Cyberpromo does not target
willing or even interested addressees, but gathers names by using
``extractor'' software to grab e-mail addresses from the Internet's
thousands of news discussion groups and millions of Web pages.
<p>
   Internet users started using ``spam'' as a verb in 1994, and
though Wallace didn't appear until late 1995, he liked the title
enough to registering the domain of ``spamford.com.''
<p>
   Unfortunately, even that has backfired. Hormel, the makers of
the physical version of spam  &MD;  a meat product  &MD;  are also suing
Wallace for denigrating their trademark.

KINGS HOPE FOR STRONG FINNISH &QL;

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  The prime-time lineups being unveiled by the
networks this week are like a fast-food menu; full of combos.
There's ``Hiller &AMP; Diller,'' ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``George &AMP; Leo.''
<p>
   The Kings are a hockey team, not a sitcom, though the
franchise's messy housekeeping in recent years has muddied the
distinction. To be sure, NBC's ``Men Behaving Badly'' has undergone
fewer cast changes than have the Kings.
<p>
   No matter. Next week the revamped Kings will unveil a fall
lineup that includes ``Aki &AMP; Olli.'' Trust us, it's a hit waiting
to happen.
<p>
   Two fresh-faced kids from Finland come to the U.S. to find fame,
fortune and the latest computer video games. One drives a bright
yellow Volvo. The other has a colorful personality. They both are
boarding with a family in El Segundo.
<p>
   If you were to pitch the story to the networks, you'd call it
``Perfect Strangers'' Meets ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
<p>
   Central casting couldn't have done any better than the Kings in
drafting defenseman Aki-Petteri Berg and forward Olli Jokinen at
No. 3 overall in 1995 and 1997, respectively.
<p>
   They are the perfectly matched odd couple. As Berg, 20,
explained over lunch with Jokinen, 18, at a Los Angeles airport
hotel Thursday, ``When we get to our rooms on the road, I like to
open the curtains, turn on the TV, sit back and relax. Olli has too
much energy. He wants to go out. He wants to go everywhere.''
<p>
   Already objects of teen idolatry in their homeland, they're
charming and disarming unless you're wearing an opponent's jersey,
in which case they're just plain alarming.
<p>
   Aki &AMP; Olli premieres Wednesday in Pittsburgh. But you can get a
sneak preview tonight at Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim and Saturday at
the Forum when the Kings wrap up their exhibition schedule with two
games against the Mighty Ducks.
<p>
   The Ducks might want to duck when they see Jokinen coming. In a
game last week against Colorado, Jokinen exchanged unpleasantries
with Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg.
<p>
   Forsberg, a soft-handed, hard-nosed player from Sweden, isn't
used to being pushed around. Obviously, nobody bothered to tell
that to the 6-2, 200-pound Jokinen. Or perhaps he simply was
retaliating for all those years Finland languished under Swedish
rule.
<p>
   Come to think of it, Jokinen did report to training camp fresh
from serving one month of his mandatory 11-month tour of duty in
the Finnish army. (``One month,'' he groaned between bites of
salad, ``that's enough.'')
<p>
   It's a toss-up as to which sight is more terrifying; Jokinen in
combat boots toting a gun or on skates wielding a stick.
<p>
   ``Olli likes to hit people,'' Berg said. ``I don't think he has
a problem with (being intimidated).''
<p>
   Neither does Berg (6-3, 200). He got into a fight with Mario
Lemieux during a game in Pittsburgh in March; this, even as teams
were starting to pay their final tributes to the Penguins superstar
who retired in April.
<p>
   What is it with this younger generation of Europeans, anyway?
Don't they know they're supposed to be finesse players?
<p>
   Berg, who was wearing a ``No Fear'' baseball cap with the bill
pointing backward, chortled.
<p>
   ``The young people are into hitting more,'' he said.
<p>
   As a group, Finns have good reason to be wired; they average
nine cups of coffee a day. And that's not all they drink. A
government study a few years back found that 10 percent of Finnish
14-year-olds get drunk at least once a month, never mind that the
legal drinking age is 18.
<p>
   Seeing (ital)markkas(end ital) in suds, one of Jokinen's friends
opened a bar recently. It ended up spelling trouble for Jokinen,
who agreed to sign autographs at the grand opening. On the
appointed day he arrived late and was whisked in past a long line
that already had formed outside the establishment.
<p>
   Jokinen would later read in a local tabloid that he had arrived
drunk and had belligerently pushed his way to the front of the
line, demanding to be let in immediately or he would buy the place.
<p>
   No wonder Jokinen relishes the relative anonymity he figures to
enjoy in L.A., where he, Berg and Ducks winger Teemu Selanne aren't
even the most famous Finnish transplants. Not with director Renny
Harlin and L.A. symphony conductor Esa Pekka-Salonen also gracing
the scene.
<p>
   ``I won't miss the attention,'' said Jokinen, who is big enough
in his homeland to have signed a multi-year deal with Adidas before
he penned a three-year contract with the Kings.
<p>
   Now all he needs is wheels. Berg, owner of the hardly mellow
yellow car, has been chauffeuring him around L.A. It's a full-time
job, given Jokinen's zest for exploring.
<p>
   Last week, Jokinen coaxed Berg into taking him to Universal
Studios. They've also been to the beach. When they tell you they
can't wait for the season to start, they're not all wet.

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  A young American woman has a small video camera
trained on her bedroom 24 hours a day. The camera, connected to a
computer, relays continually updated color photographs from her
Washington apartment into her internet website, where 100 million
visitors around the world look in every week.
<p>
   It is Candid Camera but with an important difference.
<p>
   Jennifer Ringley, 21, knows strangers are watching her. She
welcomes  &MD;  encourages  &MD;  the peeping toms. Yet she continues to
behave as if they were not there.
<p>
   Click onto the JenniCAM website, at http://www.jennicam.org, and
what you will see is a ``gallery,'' featuring a dozen still images
of Jenni engaged in a variety of mundane domestic activities.
<p>
   She might be on the telephone, sitting down watching television,
brushing her hair, chewing her thumb, doing stomach exercises, or
just fast asleep in bed  &MD;  for she kindly leaves a light on in her
room at night for her fans' uninterrupted viewing pleasure.
<p>
   And, yes, she does dress and undress. The way people do in their
bedrooms. Not with any visible intention of prurient display. No
saucy winks to the camera. But you will inevitably catch the
occasional glimpse of breast.
<p>
   She may sometimes bend over with her back to the camera to pick
up a sock and, because all she happens to be wearing is a T-shirt,
show the camera her white behind.
<p>
   The sexless solitude of the compulsive websurfer must account in
part for the 100 million ``hits'' her website attracts each week.
But there has to be more to the phenomenon than that.
<p>
   If sex is all you crave, there is much richer fare out there  &MD; 
live, if you wish, and heavily interactive.
<p>
   Jenni receives mountains of lewd e-mail, but she only replies to
the nice ones. Like those from Josh Willner, from Florida, who has
created a temple to his heroine at an internet site he calls Planet
Jennifer.
<p>
   Under the title ``A Tribute to a Web Goddess,'' he gathers his
own ``personal favorite pictures of Jenni,'' but warns that ``if
you are looking for an archive of nudes, please go elsewhere.''
<p>
   Jenni herself, a professional web-page designer who keeps her
address secret and her telephone number unlisted, does communicate
with all her visitors, but in a deliberately static, sterile
format.
<p>
   She has a section on her website of Frequently Asked Questions,
each of which she answers as if she were responding to a television
interviewer.
<p>
   ``Do you ever stage what we see? No. The concept of the cam is
to show whatever is going on naturally... So whatever you're seeing
isn't staged or faked... there's something compelling about real
life that staging it wouldn't bring to the medium.
<p>
   ``You're naked sometimes, is this pornography? This site is not
pornographic. Yes, it contains nudity from time to time. Real life
contains nudity.''
<p>
   Joey Anuff, an expert on internet culture, observed that ``the
exercises in first-person deviancy found on so many homepages
converge almost perfectly with the trend towards reality-based
programming on television.''
<p>
   One major influence has been MTV's 'Real World' series,
fly-on-the-wall documentaries chronicling the banal everyday
intimacies of not particularly interesting young men and women.
<p>
   Jenni, Arnuff said, is not the only one out there who has acted
on the discovery that all the cyberworld's a stage. Plenty of
college students are doing the same thing, some selling videotapes
of themselves on America Online.
<p>
   ``The core motive is extremely simple: attention. Broadcasting
your most candid moments is the fastest way to get an e-mail inbox
full of curiosity.''
<p>
   Jenni seeks, in the broadest sense of the word, love. A love
beyond narcissism, for how sweet  &MD;  if ultimately ethereal  &MD;  must be
the satisfaction of knowing that millions of people find you
interesting just the way you are.
<p>
   As for those who watch, Josh Willner's sense of intimate
knowledge with a goddess he has seen in photographs but never met
might seem eerie; it might seem fanatical. But everybody carries
within something of the fantasist and the voyeur, and it is to such
impulses that Jenni caters.

MEMORIES OF LAST YEAR'S CAL GAME HAUNT USC &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By ERIC NOLAND &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  New year, same opponent ... vastly different
ramifications for USC.
<p>
   One year ago at roughly this same point in the season, the
Trojans were in full strut as they prepared for a game with
California at the Coliseum. They were 3-1, ranked 17th nationally,
and mindful that their school hadn't lost at home to these Cal
chumps since before the entire USC roster was born  &MD;  1970, to be
exact.
<p>
   The Bears' most recent visit to Los Angeles had resulted in a
61-0 picnic for the Trojans in 1994, and since the '96 Cal team had
just required three overtimes to beat Oregon State, there was
little to suggest this meeting would be any different.
<p>
   But it was. Thoroughly. Incredibly. Cal, a 16-point underdog
entering the game, pulled off a 22-15 shocker at the Coliseum. The
unraveling of USC's season followed closely behind, as a team that
had entered the season ranked No.7 lost five games in a seven-game
stretch en route to a 6-6 finish.
<p>
   As USC readies for a rematch Saturday at Cal, ``it definitely is
a reverse role,'' says linebacker Chris Claiborne. ``Definitely a
turnaround.''
<p>
   Unranked USC is 0-2 and nursing a headache, and this time needs
a rebound against the very team that sent its season for a tumble
12 months ago.
<p>
   ``We're definitely coming into this game with a totally
different mindset,'' said cornerback Brian Kelly. ``Last year, we
were riding high, sort of peaking a little bit....
<p>
   ``It (the loss to Cal) took a lot of wind out of the balloon.
The balloon was moving pretty high there, and it was a nice little
pin.''
<p>
   Ominous warnings had developed early in the week. Three of USC's
defensive stars (Kelly, defensive tackle Darrell Russell,
linebacker Sammy Knight) and a reserve receiver (Larry Parker)
received one-game suspensions for swapping school-issued football
cleats for merchandise at a Nike store.
<p>
   Also, the Trojans were coming off a bye in the schedule  &MD; 
potentially fatal when facing an opponent perceived as weak. The
Bears were 4-0, but their wins had come against the dubious
competition of San Jose State, San Diego State, Nevada and Oregon
State.
<p>
   ``I just know we didn't play our best,'' said USC running back
LaVale Woods. ``I don't know what the reason was  &MD;  because the
(suspended) guys were out or we were just flat or whatever. I saw
guys playing hard, but I know we made a lot of mistakes.''
<p>
   This one got away from the Trojans gradually, but convincingly,
such that the shock was prolonged.
<p>
   California crossed up USC's speed and aggressiveness on defense
by throwing countless screen passes, and its patient offensive
drives resulted in a maddening game of keep-away  &MD;  for the game,
Cal's possession time of 38{ minutes was nearly double USC's 21{.
<p>
   The Trojans, meanwhile, setting the tone for the remainder of
their season, repeatedly self-destructed. Woods was stuffed on a
fourth-and-1 play at the Cal 5-yard line in the first quarter.
Later, in the third, Delon Washington lost a fumble at the Cal 1.
<p>
   Woods recalls a stunt from the Bears line on his play, such that
``I got the ball and got smacked really quick.'' Washington's
fumble stemmed from his attempt to reach the ball across the goal
line as he went to the ground; USC felt he was down when the ball
came out.
<p>
   As for Cal's relentless marches down the field, Kelly, then a
safety, says he was feeling pangs of guilt while watching
helplessly.
<p>
   ``It was real tough. I was sitting on the sideline almost
praying for a win more than any other time,'' he said. ``It would
have taken a lot of pressure off myself, and then we come out and
lose.
<p>
   ``And the way they attacked us was, like, right in my area.
Screens. Me playing safety, I really felt I could have helped the
team and made an impact.''
<p>
   Kelly is clearly uncomfortable revisiting the indiscretion that
led to his suspension. ``We've been through that before,'' he said.
``To go back over it and say, `Would I do it again?' I wouldn't,
because it's just not something you're supposed to do. You made a
mistake and you definitely paid for it.''
<p>
   So did USC, but today's team leaders stop short of saying there
was a sense of betrayal among the players.
<p>
   ``They didn't know that this was a violation,'' Claiborne said
of the Shoe Store Four. ``That was really surprising to
everybody.''
<p>
   ``I really don't know what was going on; I wasn't involved,''
said Woods. ``I guess since they were punished, what they did was
wrong. But everyone makes mistakes. Hopefully, it will never happen
again.''
<p>
   USC has been working double time to ensure that an upset loss
doesn't recur Saturday.
<p>
   ``A lot of times when you're undefeated, if you lose a game it
can make you or break you,'' said Claiborne. ``You find out the
character of your team a lot of times when things like that
happen.''
<p>
   Conversely, a victory at a bleak moment can create...``a
turnaround,'' Claiborne said. ``I really think it will be.''
<p>
   And California could be the pivot point in each case.

live, if you wish, and heavily interactive.
<p>
   Jenni receives mountains of lewd e-mail, but she only replies to
the nice ones. Like those from Josh Willner, from Florida, who has
created a temple to his heroine at an internet site he calls Planet
Jennifer.
<p>
   Under the title ``A Tribute to a Web Goddess,'' he gathers his
own ``personal favorite pictures of Jenni,'' but warns that ``if
you are looking for an archive of nudes, please go elsewhere.''
<p>
   Jenni herself, a professional web-page designer who keeps her
address secret and her telephone number unlisted, does communicate
with all her visitors, but in a deliberately static, sterile
format.
<p>
   She has a section on her website of Frequently Asked Questions,
each of which she answers as if she were responding to a television
interviewer.
<p>
   ``Do you ever stage what we see? No. The concept of the cam is
to show whatever is going on naturally... So whatever you're seeing
isn't staged or faked... there's something compelling about real
life that staging it wouldn't bring to the medium.
<p>
   ``You're naked sometimes, is this pornography? This site is not
pornographic. Yes, it contains nudity from time to time. Real life
contains nudity.''
<p>
   Joey Anuff, an expert on internet culture, observed that ``the
exercises in first-person deviancy found on so many homepages
converge almost perfectly with the trend towards reality-based
programming on television.''
<p>
   One major influence has been MTV's 'Real World' series,
fly-on-the-wall documentaries chronicling the banal everyday
intimacies of not particularly interesting young men and women.
<p>
   Jenni, Arnuff said, is not the only one out there who has acted
on the discovery that all the cyberworld's a stage. Plenty of
college students are doing the same thing, some selling videotapes
of themselves on America Online.
<p>
   ``The core motive is extremely simple: attention. Broadcasting
your most candid moments is the fastest way to get an e-mail inbox
full of curiosity.''
<p>
   Jenni seeks, in the broadest sense of the word, love. A love
beyond narcissism, for how sweet  &MD;  if ultimately ethereal  &MD;  must be
the satisfaction of knowing that millions of people find you
interesting just the way you are.
<p>
   As for those who watch, Josh Willner's sense of intimate
knowledge with a goddess he has seen in photographs but never met
might seem eerie; it might seem fanatical. But everybody carries
within something of the fantasist and the voyeur, and it is to such
impulses that Jenni caters.

RAIDERS' WEAPON: BROWNIAN MOTION &QL; 
BY RON KROICHICK &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ALAMEDA, Calif.  &MD;  Television often tells only part of the story.
The camera catches Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown wrapping his
hands around the football, then swerving downfield to drop more
yardage in his hip pocket.
<p>
   But the key to Brown's fast start this season  &MD;  his 33
receptions lead the NFL  &MD;  occurs before he slips into the picture.
By then, he has already left at least one defensive back tangled in
confusion.
<p>
   The process is akin to a basketball player moving without the
ball. Chris Mullin does not magically appear on the baseline, ready
to launch his jump shot. It requires skill and creativity to get
open.
<p>
   Brown leans on his quickness and knowledge to spin loose on the
football field. The vanquished defensive backs are suitably
impressed.
<p>
   ``He's one of the only receivers I know who can get open against
double coverage,'' Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn said. ``He can make
moves and get open. I don't know how he does it, but he does it.''
<p>
   Brown illustrated this ability last Sunday against Glenn's
teammate, Otis Smith. Brown faked an out pattern so convincingly,
he practically twisted Smith into the artificial turf.
<p>
   Presto. Brown cruised into the open and caught a 29-yard
touchdown pass.
<p>
   Or flash back to the season opener, August 31 against Tennessee.
Brown used his signature ``double move''  &MD;  fake inside, fake
outside, cut upfield  &MD;  to leave two Oilers' defensive backs
staggering. Touchdown.
<p>
   Raiders safety Eddie Anderson has watched Brown operate for 10
seasons now, in practice and in games. Anderson pointed to an
element usually associated with James Jett, the team's other
starting wide receiver.
<p>
   ``Tim's definitely quicker than people realize,'' Anderson said.
``He doesn't get a lot of publicity for being a burner, like Jett.
But when the ball's in the air, Tim's running at that speed.''
<p>
   Opposing defenses are starting to dip into their bags of tricks.
Safeties wander over to help cover Brown. Or linebackers greet him
at the line of scrimmage, trying to bump him off stride.
<p>
   The Raiders, for all their missteps in this sloppy 1-3 start,
know how to spring Brown. They frequently send him in motion,
making it difficult for defenses to smother him at the line. Brown
surfaces in various spots.
<p>
   Then, when he begins his foray downfield, he recalls his
research.
<p>
   ``It's all about knowing the guy you're playing against,'' Brown
said. ``If I know Dale Carter (of Kansas City) is very aggressive,
but he runs well, I have to give him a little stutter step on get
deep on him.
<p>
   ``Aaron Glenn is quick but not physical. So I can push him
around a little bit. . . . The main ingredient is quickness. If I'm
not quick in my routes, I'm not going to get open.''
<p>
   Raiders cornerback Albert Lewis said accomplished route runners,
such as Brown and the 49ers' Jerry Rice, make all patterns look the
same. They specialize in deception, never tipping their hand.
<p>
   Brown literally walks off the line of scrimmage on one route,
waiting for the action to pass. Then he shifts into gear and takes
off.
<p>
   ``Tim has an unusual knack for changing speeds,'' Raiders
linebacker Rob Fredrickson said. ``He'll freeze a guy, like he's in
slow motion. Then he has a sudden burst of speed. He's great at
changing speeds and changing direction.''
<p>
   As Brown acknowledged, quarterback Jeff George's strong right
arm helps. The moment Brown bursts free, with even the slimmest
opening between him and the defender, the ball arrives.
<p>
   Then he makes the catch and runs. That is the simple part of the
job.
<p>
   GAME BLACKED OUT: As expected, the Raiders did not sell out
Sunday's game against St. Louis by Thursday's 1 p.m. deadline. So
the game will be blacked out on local television.
<p>
   KTVU-Channel 2 will show the Chicago-Dallas game instead, at 1
p.m.
<p>
   The Raiders had sold slightly more than 40,000 tickets as of
yesterday afternoon. Capacity at the Coliseum is 63,026.
<p>
   NOTES: Offensive tackle Lincoln Kennedy (sprained ankle) and
cornerback Terry McDaniel (sprained knee) returned to practice
yesterday. The Raiders upgraded Kennedy's status to probable;
McDaniel will not start, but he may play in passing situations. . .
. Coach Joe Bugel said Desmond Howard will see some action at wide
receiver Sunday. Howard has not played one offensive down during
the regular season.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Kokusai Securities Co. and Sanyo
Securities Co. denied a report that Kokusai will buy the smaller
Japanese brokerage with help from Sanwa Bank Ltd.
<p>
   Kokusai Securities Vice President Hideyu Igarashi dismissed the
report, published in the Sankei newspaper, during a press briefing
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
<p>
   Kokusai Securities ``hasn't considered the possibility of
acquiring Sanyo Securities,'' he said.
<p>
   Sanyo Securities President Takashi Ikeuchi, at a separate press
briefing, also said the report wasn't true.
<p>
   Sanwa Bank will supply Kokusai with the funds to buy
debt-plagued Sanyo Securities on the condition that Kokusai becomes
a subsidiary of the bank in the future, the report said.
<p>
   Igarashi said his company had no special relationship with
Osaka-based Sanwa Bank, which also denied the Sankei report.
Kokusai primarily deals with Sakura Bank Ltd., Sanwa and Daiwa Bank
Ltd., and borrows about the same amount from each, he said.
<p>
   Daisuke Kotegawa, director of the securities business division
of the Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, questioned the
report's validity. ``If (Kokusai and Sanyo Securities) are talking
about such a plan, they would have had to contact me,'' he said.
<p>
   Junichi Naito, an official within the ministry's Banking Bureau,
said he had not heard about any purchase of Sanyo Securities by
Kokusai.
<p>
   Igarashi said Kokusai would concentrate on increasing the
competitiveness of its products before the Japanese government's
plan to deregulate the financial industry, coined the ``Big Bang,''
takes effect.
<p>
   ``Our first concern is preparing for the Big Bang,'' he said.
<p>
   Shares of Sanyo Securities and Kokusai Securities were suspended
from trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities
Exchange. Daiwa Bank shares fell as much as 32 yen to 543.
<p>
   In a statement, Kokusai apologized to shareholders, investors
and customers for the ``inconvenience and worries'' caused by the
suspension of the company's shares.
<p>
   Nomura Securities Co., the largest Japanese securities company,
is a major shareholder in both Sanyo Securities and Kokusai. Its
shares rose as much as 50 yen to 1,640.
<p>
   Sanyo Securities, one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages, took
a beating by investors last week even before it reversed its
half-year earnings forecast to a loss from a profit. The company's
shares ended yesterday at 80 yen, compared with its year's high of
324 on Feb. 24.
<p>
   After the market closed last Friday, Sanyo reversed its earnings
outlook for the half-year ending Sept. 30 to a net loss of 3.9
billion yen from a net profit of 2.5 billion yen. It's reported
losses for six straight years.
<p>
   The collapse of the speculative investment boom of the late
1980s left Sanyo's four financial affiliates with a combined 80
billion yen ($658 million) in irrecoverable loans.
<p>
   Now, though, Sanyo's struggling because of falling revenue from
trading commissions, it said.
<p>
   Sanyo isn't alone. Seven other second-tier brokerages have
already revised their half-year earnings forecast this week. All of
them now expect to report net losses for the period, citing similar
reasons.
<p>
   Commissions on stock trading have declined as foreign brokerages
step up their efforts to capture a bigger share of the market ahead
of the coming wave of financial market liberalization. Under the
Big Bang plans, trading commissions are to be fully liberalized by
2000.
<p>
   For many brokerages including Sanyo, plans to diversify and
reduce their dependency on trading commissions backfired when a
sudden rise in the yen in May forced them to abandon selling dual
currency bonds to customers.
<p>
   Sanyo Securities said last week it will report a 4.235 billion
yen loss it had to shoulder from canceling plans to sell
dual-currency bonds to investors.
<p>
   The brokerage expects to report a net profit of 300 million yen
for the full year ending March through further cost-cutting
measures and by intensifying its sales of investment trust funds.
Sanyo had a net loss of 2.22 billion yen in the year ended March
31.
<p>
   Meanwhile, it's uncertain whether Sanyo will be able to gain
support from nine life insurers on extending a deadline on 20
billion yen in subordinated bonds they took on as part of the
brokerage's restructuring plan.
<p>
   Yuzuru Fujita, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of
Japan, told reporters last week that life insurers will wait to see
Sanyo come up with further restructuring plans before deciding to
extend the deadline from Oct. 31 next year.
<p>
   Sanyo Securities President Ikeuchi said at today's press
conference that the company is not currently in talks with the
insurers on moving the deadline back.
<p>
   The issue is crucial because Sanyo's capital adequacy ratio may
fall to levels requiring Ministry of Finance guidance if it can't
incorporate the bonds as assets. Sanyo won't be able to do so with
bonds less than one year from maturity.
<p>
   Sanyo's Takanami said the company hasn't begun discussing the
issue with the nine insurers yet, though it is holding regular
talks with Nomura Securities.

PANTHERS' SUCCESS TURNS UP MISSING &QL; 
BY IRA MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif.  &MD;  Maybe the sophomore jinx came a year late
for the Carolina Panthers. Maybe they got a little carried away
with success. Maybe they just played over their heads last year.
Whatever the reason, the honeymoon is over in Charlotte.
<p>
   The Panthers, who shocked the 49ers twice and won the NFC West
in their second season in the league, suddenly look like a very
ordinary team. There were 5,000 no-shows for their second home
game, more than double the normal figure, and the fans who did come
started booing them early.
<p>
   ``The missing ingredient from last season? The missing
ingredient is lack of efficiency. Last year, we didn't turn the
ball over and miss assignments like we do this year,'' said guard
Greg Skrepenak.
<p>
   That isn't all that is missing.
<p>
    &MD; Kevin Greene, who led the NFL in sacks a year ago, was the
emotional leader of the Panthers' defense, and now he plays for the
49ers. His absence has disrupted the Panthers because they kept
expecting him to return and, when he didn't, they had to shuffle
their defense.
<p>
   ``We've had to go through a little transition, because we've had
to move some people around later than we wanted to,'' Panthers
coach Dom Capers said.
<p>
   The Panthers, one of the few teams still playing a 3-4 defense,
signed free agent Micheal Barrow from Houston, planning to line him
up inside next to Sam Mills. But after trying two rookies in
Greene's spot in exhibition games, Carolina moved Barrow outside
and promoted Andre Royal from special teams to a starting job on
the inside.
<p>
   Greene hasn't done anything for the 49ers yet, but his absence
hurts the Panthers. Last year, Carolina led the NFL with 60 sacks.
This year, it has 10 in four games, but seven of them came in one
game against San Diego. The Panthers also have just one
interception after making 22 last year.
<p>
    &MD; Wide receiver Willie Green, who killed the 49ers last December
with seven catches for 157 yards, also is missing. The Panthers
allowed veterans Green and Mark Carrier (combined: 104 catches,
1,422 yards and nine touchdowns) to leave during the offseason,
figuring they could replace them with second-year man Muhsin
Muhammed and rookie Rae Carruth or veterans Ernie Mills and Raghib
Ismail.
<p>
   Problem is, the youngsters haven't learned to run patterns
properly, and Muhammed is out with a broken wrist. Mills can't get
open and Ismail simply can't play, period. None of the receivers
has shown any ability to create separation from coverage. That
leaves only tight end Wesley Walls as a reliable go-to guy, but
when Kansas City smothered him last Sunday, there went the offense.
<p>
   Further, quarterback Kerry Collins missed a chunk of preseason
after his jaw was broken in an exhibition game, and the Panthers
haven't developed any timing in their passing game. Carrier was
re-signed last week and could play a key role against the 49ers on
Monday night.
<p>
   The Panthers have scored five touchdowns in four games; they are
26th in the league in scoring.
<p>
    &MD; Howard Griffith, the fullback, also is missing. Griffith was a
key blocker, strong and powerful. His replacement, Bob Christian,
is one of those players who does all the right things but simply
doesn't do them very well.
<p>
   Carolina's team was built to win with defense and kicking and by
avoiding mistakes. Last season, the Panthers had the third best
turnover margin in the league (plus-13). This season, they are tied
for the fourth worst (minus-5).
<p>
   And that is just what is happening on the field.
<p>
   Off the field, there have been a series of unflattering
incidents revolving around Collins, the quarterback.
<p>
   First came the revelation that, at a midseason team meeting last
year, linebacker Lamar Lathon called out Collins for drinking and
partying too much and not concentrating on his job.
<p>
   Then, on the final night of training camp, Collins apparently
got into a fight with a teammate, starting offensive tackle
Norberto Davidds-Garrido, which resulted in a black eye for the
quarterback. Davidds-Garrido explained  &MD;  he really said this  &MD;  ``We
were just horsing around . . . my fist just popped up and hit him
in the eye.''
<p>
   Later the same evening, Collins used a racial slur while talking
with a group of black players. He apologized, called it ``a serious
mistake,'' and said he was just joking and being sarcastic.
<p>
   Only time will tell how the Panthers react to their string of
on- and off-field problems, the first real crisis in their
three-year history. But it is clear their first-ever Monday night
game will be critical because, among other things, Carolina's
remaining schedule is harder than the 49ers' schedule, with a home
game against Green Bay and road games against Denver, Dallas,
Minnesota and the 49ers.

ARIZONA'S SMITH LOOKS FORWARD TO GAME &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By JON WILNER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &LR; LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Keith Smith, Arizona's sophomore quarterback, has
attended close to 50 UCLA games in the Rose Bowl, including the
famous John Barnes conquest of USC in 1992.
<p>
   To his chagrin, Smith has never played in the storied stadium.
On Saturday, he will fill that void.
<p>
   ``It definitely has a special place in my heart,'' said Smith, a
Newbury Park native who grew up a UCLA fan but didn't feel the
Bruins were a good fit for his skills.
<p>
   ``It's an historic place. My redshirt year (1995), I was on the
traveling squad when we played there, and it was just an honor to
warm up there. I'm sure I'll be really excited to play in front of
my family and friends.''
<p>
   How he plays is another matter. Smith dazzled opponents last
season with his speed and arm strength, running for 546 yards and
passing for 1,450. But he has struggled this season with the
pressure of being the most talented quarterback in Arizona history.
(The Wildcats have not produced an NFL quarterback since the
Eisenhower administration.)
<p>
   ``For whatever reason, Keith has pressed,'' Arizona coach Dick
Tomey said. ``The expectations on him as a sophomore maybe were
burdensome. People here expect a lot, and maybe way too much.''
<p>
   Same old Homer: Homer Smith was known for his quirkiness during
two tours as UCLA's offensive coordinator. Apparently, that
characteristic hasn't changed since he took the same post in Tucson
last year.
<p>
   ``He hates when people yawn in meetings,'' Keith Smith said.
``So one day a guy yawned, and coach Smith pulled out a water gun
and shot the guy in the mouth.''
<p>
   Just for kicks: If Saturday's game becomes a field goal contest,
past performance favors UCLA. Chris Sailer has made 4 of 5 field
goals this season, while his Arizona counterpart, T.J. Rodriguez,
has struggled.
<p>
   A walk-on from Tucson, Rodriguez has not made a field goal
longer than 33 yards and has missed four kicks from 35 yards and
in.
<p>
   ``Our special teams have been dreadfully inconsistent,'' Tomey
said.
<p>
   Give it a go: Sophomore receiver Brad Melsby (mental and
physical exhaustion) was expected to attend fall quarter classes,
which began Thursday. But he has no immediate plans to play
football.
<p>
   ``He's going to go to classes and see how he feels,'' Toledo
said. ``If it doesn't work out, he'll probably withdraw.''
<p>
   Not dead yet: UCLA is back in the hunt for Notre Dame High
School tailback Justin Fargas, according to the latest word within
Pacific-10 recruiting circles. The Bruins were spirited by Fargas'
decision to delay his announcement until after the season.
<p>
   ``When I talked to him (in August) he wasn't sure where he'd
go,'' said Sailer, who played with Fargas at Notre Dame. ``Your
mind changes so many times during the different stages of
recruiting that it's tough to decide. Things always sound good.''
<p>
   Hit 'em early, hit 'em hard: Skip Hicks had 21 carries for 48
yards last year against the Wildcats. The key to their success was
hitting Hicks before he gained momentum.
<p>
   ``We were able to stop him before he got going,'' Arizona
linebacker Jimmy Sprotte said. ``He needs a hole to run through,
but he can be (hard) to tackle when he gets 5 yards of steam.''
<p>
   Backfield in motion: Free safety Shaun Williams is expected to
start and should play at least 30-35 snaps. His backup, Glenn
Thompkins, is doubtful because of a sprained foot.
<p>
   That leaves the Bruins with two options when Williams is on the
sidelines: Play true freshman Jason Stephens, or move Larry Atkins
over from strong safety. In that scenario, reserve rover Eric
Whitfield moves to strong safety.
<p>
   Injury update: Cornerback Aaron Roques (shoulder) had his left
arm in a sling Thursday and is not expected to play. True freshman
Marques Anderson will start on the right side for the second
consecutive game.
<p>
   Cornerback Javelin Guidry (knee) practiced on a limited basis
this week. If he needs a break, watch for redshirt freshman Damian
Allen.
<p>
   Defensive end Darren Cline (ankle) is healthy and will join the
rotation. Defensive end Kenyon Coleman is questionable with a
slightly sprained ankle.

<p>
   DENVER  &MD;  It's more than simply not making the playoffs. It's
that it never occurred to the Dodgers they wouldn't make the
playoffs.
<p>
   Especially after their July surge from eight games back and
their late-August push to 2{ games up, the Dodgers were quietly
confident they were destined for a third straight postseason
appearance.
<p>
   Now they are two games behind the San Francisco Giants with
three to play. They are in this predicament because of an 8-13
September.
<p>
   ``You don't want to feel like you didn't get the job done when
it was crunch time,'' Todd Zeile said Thursday, admitting a failure
to make the playoffs would have an added sting because the Dodgers
know they should have won the National League West.
<p>
   ``When you battle and battle and battle and take the lead down
the stretch and you have a chance to put away the team that's
chasing you, you want to do that,'' Zeile said. ``You should do
it.''
<p>
   Meanwhile: Eric Karros denied telling a reporter from an on-line
news service that the Dodgers had choked and would be labeled
underachievers for their collapse down the stretch.
<p>
   Karros told reporters Thursday that he never said ``choked'' or
``underachievers'' in the interview conducted a day earlier. Said
Karros, referring to the on-line reporter: ``He's a ... liar.''
<p>
   The quotes from the on-line story were eerily similar to
comments made by Karros in spring training, when he said, ``Either
we're going down as a group that accomplished something or we'll be
labeled underachievers. We've got a group of guys who have been
around, and now it's time to make it work. Another two years, are
we going to be able to keep all these guys?''
<p>
   Predicted landslide: In a poll of 14 MVP voters, one in each
National League city, the Denver Post found that 12 had voted or
planned to vote for Rockies right fielder Larry Walker. Dodgers
catcher Mike Piazza received no first-place votes and 13
second-place votes.
<p>
   In an article that appears in today's Post, numerous voters said
they had changed their vote from Piazza to Walker in the past week
as the Dodgers faded. They also said the Rockies recent success
helped Walker. One voter said he would not make his decision until
the last day of the season.
<p>
   Second place: The Dodgers will, barring a miracle, board their
chartered plane Sunday and make their final flight of the season  &MD; 
home. It will be a quiet trip.
<p>
   With Thursday's victory, the Dodgers assured themselves at least
a second-place finish in the National League West. That means
nothing to them, except that they had a disappointing year.
<p>
   Second place sounded great to the Rockies. So does third, all
things considered.
<p>
   ``It's understandable because of the position both teams were in
leading up to this point,'' said Rockies shortstop Walt Weiss.
``The Dodgers were right there to take the division, where we had
to play like hell just to get back in the race.''
<p>
   The Rockies, last in the National League West and 11 games
behind the Dodgers on Aug. 25, won 20 of their next 25 games to
make it all the way up to 5{ games back. They were only eliminated
Wednesday when they lost 4-3 to the Giants.
<p>
   Also: With singles in his first two at-bats, Mike Piazza set a
major-league record for hits in a season by a catcher with 194.
Piazza got No. 195 before the night was through. ... On the
Rockies' first day out of playoff contention, Walker did not play
Thursday. A team spokesman said Walker was tired and sore.

HERTA FRUSTRATED BY DISMAL SEASON &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By BILL SCHLOTTER &QC; 
c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  This was to be Bryan Herta's breakthrough year.
<p>
   The year the Hart High School (Valencia, Calif.) graduate would
earn his first PPG CART victory.
<p>
   The year he would challenge for the CART World Series title.
<p>
   The year he would establish himself as one of the rising stars
of auto racing.
<p>
   ``Yeah,'' said Herta, looking back on a disappointing 1997
campaign as he prepared himself for Sunday's season-ending Marlboro
500 at Fontana's California Speedway. ``So we thought.''
<p>
   But instead of basking in expected success, Herta has been
dogged by frustration in 1997.
<p>
   The often uncompetitive Goodyear tires on his No.8 racer deserve
part of the blame. And two collisions with 1997 points champion
Alex Zanardi cost him, too, knocking him out of the lead at road
races at Vancouver and Laguna Seca.
<p>
   As a result, Herta comes to Fontana in 11th place in season
points after finishing eighth in 1996. Despite two record-setting
pole starts and leading four different races he has finished in the
top five just twice.
<p>
   And he is still waiting for that first win.
<p>
   ``I think overall, he's run pretty good,'' said team owner and
teammate Bobby Rahal. ``He's been in position to win, but he's been
a little unlucky.''
<p>
   After a slow first half of the season, Herta put himself in
position to win the Miller 200 in Lexington, Ohio, on Aug. 10,
setting a track record in earning the pole position.
<p>
   But after leading 18 laps, his left rear tire blew, damaging his
car's suspension and putting him out of the race.
<p>
   His tires also cost him at the Aug. 17 race at Elkhart Lake,
Wis., where he spun off course on the final lap and finished 11th.
<p>
   ``His car has let him down a little bit,'' Rahal said.
``Particularly those little round black things.''
<p>
   Herta was in position to win the series' last two races as well,
stops in Vancouver, where he qualified sixth, and Laguna Seca,
where he set a track record in winning his second pole of the
season.
<p>
   But each time, contact with the highly aggressive Zanardi took
the 27-year-old out of the lead.
<p>
   Herta was leading with 14 laps to go at Vancouver when Zanardi
hit him hard trying to pass in a turn, knocking Herta's car hard
into a tire barrier.
<p>
   CART officials later assessed the Italian driver a $25,000
penalty for rough driving, but that didn't help Herta, who ended up
10th.
<p>
   Herta had been a victim of Zanardi's sometimes wild driving
before.
<p>
   At Laguna Seca in 1996, Herta was leading the race with a lap
left when Zanardi went off the track to get around him and steal
the win.
<p>
   With that bitter loss and the bump at Vancouver in mind, Herta
was determined to hold his ground at this year's Laguna Seca race.
So when Zanardi tried to make an aggressive pass, Herta got tough,
the cars collided and Herta lost another lead.
<p>
   And while he wound up sixth, he feels the point made was worth
it.
<p>
   ``There are times when you have to defend yourself out there or
some guys will continue to take advantage of you,'' Herta said.
<p>
   Was the Laguna Seca incident one of those times?
<p>
   ``Maybe,'' he said, a small competitive smile forming on his
face.
<p>
   Herta said he doesn't approve of some of Zanardi's tactics.
<p>
   He felt Zanardi's off-track pass last year was clearly illegal.
CART adopted rules this year prohibiting such a maneuver.
<p>
   And he and Rahal weren't happy about the crash in Vancouver,
either.
<p>
   ``I don't believe in punting somebody off the race course,''
Rahal said.
<p>
   ``All you ask for in this business is a chance to win,'' Herta
said. ``He cost me a chance to win.''
<p>
   Nonetheless, Herta said he and Zanardi remain cordial if not the
best of friends. And Herta said he carries no grudge.
<p>
   ``I believe in being professional,'' Herta said.
<p>
   Herta means that, his boss says.
<p>
   ``He's pretty good about it,'' Rahal said. ``At some point you
have to let it go or it will eat you up. You have to forget about
it and get on with things.''
<p>
   Herta would like to get on with things by claiming that first
victory Sunday.
<p>
   In light of the strong performances in his last four races, he
feels the time is right.
<p>
   Rahal said Goodyear has promised competitive tires for the super
speeds at California Speedway's 2-mile oval.
<p>
   ``If they do their part, we should be right up there,'' Rahal
said.

DRIVING OFF TOBACCO ROAD &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By BILL SCHLOTTER &QC; 
c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &QC; 
 &LR;  &HT;    LOS ANGELES  &MD;  At a race sponsored by and named after a tobacco
company, Payton Coyne Racing's entry is something akin to a fly in
the punch bowl.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The No. 34 Ford Cosworth, to be driven by Dennis Vitolo in
Sunday's Marlboro 500, is sponsored by SmithKline Beecham, makers
of stop-smoking aids NicoDerm CQ patches and Nicorette gum.
<p>
   And in addition to running the race, the team is challenging
other teams and their fans to quit smoking.
<p>
   ``When questioned, 75 percent of smokers say they would like to
quit,'' said Vitolo, himself a former smoker. ``The tie is that you
must be very committed to succeed in racing and the same thing
applies to quitting smoking.''
<p>
   Kicking the smoking habit might be nice for some, but Vitolo has
other reasons to be happy.
<p>
   After spending the bulk of the season in an uncompetitive Lola
run by poorly financed Project Indy Racing, he has been offered a
seat with Payton Coyne.
<p>
   ``I'm really looking forward to this,'' said the 40-year-old
veteran. ``I'm looking to establish myself and build a relationship
with this team.''
<p>
   Vitolo said tentative plans call for Payton Coyne, SmithKline
and he to stay together for a full 19-race season next year.
<p>
   1998 schedule: The PPG CART World Series will end its season in
Fontana again in 1998, but a bit later in the year.
<p>
   The 19-race schedule  &MD;  up by two races over 1997  &MD;  will conclude
with the Marlboro 500 at the California Speedway on Nov. 1.
<p>
   The season begins March 1 with the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami.
<p>
   The Long Beach Grand Prix, the series' third stop, is set for
April 5.
<p>
   Next year's schedule features new series stops in Houston (Oct.
4) and Motegi, Japan (March 28).
<p>
   Soggy speedway: Practice rounds for Indy Lights drivers were
rained out at the California Speedway on Thursday as the PPG CART
Tour moved onto the Fontana track in preparation for Sunday's
Marlboro 500.
<p>
   Warm, dry weather is expected for today's CART practice and Indy
Lights qualifying.
<p>
   Tickets remain available for today ($10) and Saturday ($20
infield, $30 grandstand).
<p>
   Fast sell: Las Vegas assured NASCAR officials they had a ripe
racing market during lobbying for a Winston Cup date.
<p>
   The NASCAR moguls believed them  &MD;  and this week both parties
were proved correct.
<p>
   Las Vegas Motor Speedway opened ticket sales for their March 1
Las Vegas 400 on Monday. And 30 hours later, all 100,000 grandstand
seats were sold out.
<p>
   !arrow!Off-road run:!off! Almost 200 entries are expected in the
Laughlin Desert Challenge off-road races Saturday and Sunday in the
desert near Laughlin, Nev.
<p>
   The race is the sixth of the seven-race SCORE Desert
Championship Series that concludes with the Tecate Baja 1000 Nov.
13-15.
<p>
   Among the class leaders expected to compete is Acton's Brian
Jeffrey.
<p>
   IROC expands field: The International Race of Champions will
extend an invitation to two Indy Racing League drivers to join the
four-race circuit in 1998, expanding the field to 14 cars and

   The series features top drivers from various racing circuits
driving identical Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams on oval tracks.
<p>
   Other series represented are CART, NASCAR Winston Cup and Busch

NOW, IT'S A CLASSIC GUESSING GAME &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  The first round of major prep races for the
Breeders' Cup Classic produced two big upsets and one sure thing.
<p>
   The sure thing is that it's going to be an interesting month and
a half for anyone trying to pick the winner of the $4 million
Classic, the richest of the seven Breeders' Cup races Nov. 8 at
Hollywood Park.
<p>
   Last week, the Daily Racing Form rankings of the nation's
Classic contenders had Gentlemen No. 1, Touch Gold No. 2 and Will's
Way No. 3. At least for the first two, Saturday's races were
supposed to be easy steppingstones.
<p>
   But Gentlemen finished fifth (behind Geri) as a 2-5 favorite in
the Woodbine Mile in Toronto; Touch Gold was fourth and last
(behind Behrens) as a 2-5 favorite in the Pegasus Handicap at the
Meadowlands in New Jersey; and Will's Way was third (behind Formal
Gold) in the Woodward Handicap at Belmont Park.
<p>
   Will's Way fractured his left front cannon bone, and although
surgery Monday in New York was pronounced a success, the Travers
and Whitney winner certainly is out of the Breeders' Cup and
probably will have to be retired.
<p>
   The post-race news was more ambiguous for 5-year-old Gentlemen,
the dominant handicap horse from here to Maryland, and 3-year-old
Touch Gold, the Belmont Stakes winner.
<p>
   Touch Gold may have felt the sting of the hard-packed
Meadowlands track in his left forefoot, which has been patched
since he stepped on himself at the start of the Preakness in May.
Gentlemen was found to have an ulcerated epiglottis (in the
throat), which had to have affected his performance.
<p>
   ``I just wish he'd left a note under my door that he had a sore
throat that day,'' said trainer Richard Mandella, who sent
Gentlemen to the mile turf race in Toronto because it looked like a
safe, easy prep for a horse who can't take a lot of hard racing.
<p>
   Mandella said Thursday from Hollywood Park that he thinks
Gentlemen's illness was brought on by the stress of travel.
<p>
   To make the Argentina-bred Gentlemen eligible for the Classic,
majority owner R.D. Hubbard must decide to put up an $800,000
supplemental nominating fee. Because Hubbard is chairman of
Hollywood Park, he has extra incentive to get the popular horse in
the race.
<p>
   Fortunately for him, he has a few weeks to figure out if the
fifth-place finish and the ulcer mean Gentlemen is off form. One
bad omen: No horse has won the Classic after finishing worse than
fourth in his previous start.
<p>
   Gentlemen is being treated with antibiotics and his throat is
being flushed with a solution of hydrogen peroxide and water.
Mandella said a second endoscopy Wednesday showed the horse is
recovering surprisingly swiftly.
<p>
   ``It's still our plan to go to the Breeders' Cup, but, as you
know, that doesn't mean it'll all work out,'' Mandella said. ``In a
week, I'll probably have a good idea if it's going to be a quick
fix, as it looks.''
<p>
   Touch Gold, unlike Gentlemen, is scheduled tentatively to race
again before the Breeders' Cup, so handicappers will have a better
chance to gauge his fitness.
<p>
   His handlers can only guess the trouble in the Pegasus was his
foot  &MD;  or feet  &MD;  because they've ruled out other physical problems.
<p>
   ``The foot was a little tender, and he was leaning out (to the
right) during the race,'' said Grant Hofmans, who assists his
father, trainer David Hofmans. ``There doesn't seem to be anything
wrong with him.''
<p>
   Depending on ``how he's doing,'' Hofmans said, Touch Gold could
tune up in the Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap Oct. 11 at Santa
Anita or go straight to the Classic.
<p>
   ``That's horse racing,'' Hofmans said of the defeat. ``That's
the way this game is played. You've just got to learn to take the
bad with the good.''
<p>
   Enjoying the good these days are the handlers of Formal Gold and
Behrens.
<p>
   Four-year-old Formal Gold, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, won by 5{
lengths over Skip Away in the Woodward  &MD;  four weeks after winning
by 5\ over the same rival in the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park.
If the Breeders' Cup Classic were held today, Formal Gold would be
favored.
<p>
   Three-year-old Behrens, with Classic master Jerry Bailey aboard,
won by 5} over Anet in the Pegasus. Behrens should be no match if
Touch Gold is on his game  &MD;  but now that's a big ``if.''

DODGERS KEEP SLIM HOPES ALIVE &QL;

<p>
   DENVER  &MD;  At Coors Field more than anywhere, finished does not
mean finished.
<p>
   That is the Dodgers' thinking as they hope against everything
they held to be true two days ago that if they are really, really
good they can win the National League West.
<p>
   A 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Thursday kept hope on
a respirator.
<p>
   In the major leagues' only race left to be officially decided,
the San Francisco Giants lead the Dodgers by two games with three
to play. The Dodgers must sweep the Rockies and the Giants must
lose two against the visiting Padres for there to be a one-game
playoff Monday afternoon in San Francisco.
<p>
   ``I think everyone in here has in the back of their mind,
whether they admit it or not, that the last breath isn't out of us
yet,'' said Todd Zeile, who sensed his teammates were more relaxed
Thursday after Wednesday's listless loss to San Diego all but
buried them.
<p>
   The Dodgers, led by Zeile's second two-homer game in three
nights, hit four home runs against Rockies starter Pedro Astacio,
who a little more than a month ago was their teammate and a little
less than a week ago beat them in Los Angeles.
<p>
   Hideo Nomo allowed the Rockies three runs on five hits in seven
innings, and Antonio Osuna and Todd Worrell held off the Rockies
the final two innings. Nomo joined Chan Ho Park as the Dodgers'
second 14-game winner.
<p>
   Zeile acknowledged tension has at times filled the Dodgers
clubhouse and dugout and spilled into the batter's box. Thursday,
he said, the Dodgers stopped playing not to lose.
<p>
   ``It seemed like we had a little more life, a little more
energy,'' he said. ``Maybe it's coming to Colorado, where it's an
uplifting place to play. ... We've got nothing to lose now. We're
in the underdogs' seat.
<p>
   ``The way we hit the ball tonight, the way we pitched, it showed
we've got some spark left in us. We can say, if we win the next
three games, who knows?''
<p>
   That Zeile is keeping hope alive is interesting. He was chief
among the realists Wednesday night. ``I'm not going to say it's
over,'' he said then. ``But. ...''
<p>
   That, evidently, was just the reason the Dodgers needed to play
like the team they were in July and August.
<p>
   Zeile got the Dodgers started with a solo home run out of
left-center field in the second inning. It was his 30th homer of
the season and seventh in the past 31 games.
<p>
   Darren Lewis' first home run since Aug. 8, 1996 scored three
runs and extended the Dodgers lead to 4-0 in the fourth. Eric
Karros' 30th homer of the season, well into the left-field
bleachers, drove home Mike Piazza in the fifth. Two batters later,
Zeile added two runs by driving in Raul Mondesi with his second
homer of the night. The shot to left center gave Zeile his fifth
two-homer game of the season. He is batting .386 with seven home
runs and 18 RBI in the past 18 games.
<p>
   All this was enough to make Astacio, a Dodger until last month,
lose his composure. It was a side of Astacio the Rockies had not
seen in his previous six starts with them.
<p>
   After Zeile's homer, Astacio's next pitch was near Lewis' eyes.
After home-plate umpire Larry Vanover spoke with Astacio and both
managers, Astacio's next pitch sailed high over Lewis' head and all
the way to the backstop. Dodgers players crowded the railing.
Karros stood on the top step. Rockies manager Don Baylor replaced
Astacio, who suffered his first loss as a Rockie.
<p>
   The Rockies would never get closer than four runs, though they
scored two runs in the seventh against Nomo and two more in the
eighth against Osuna.
<p>
   Zeile finished with three runs scored. Mondesi singled twice and
scored both times. Eric Young was 2 for 4 in his first game in
Colorado since the Dodgers acquired him in a trade for Astacio on
Aug. 18.
<p>
   ``We're just going to go out and play,'' Karros said. ``We lose
one more game, that's it. We're on a life-support system right now
anyways.''

   Mumbai, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Indian stocks traded little
changed as investors waited to see earnings results for the
half-year through September, traders said
<p>
   Most investors expect earnings growth to be disappointing. Some,
though, are hoping for signs that growth will improve later this
year as the central bank keeps interest rates low.
<p>
   Investors are also expecting this year's monsoon, which had
medium rainfall, to be good for crops.
<p>
   ``There are no signs of recovery yet,'' said Hina Shah, chief
investment officer at J.M. Capital Management Ltd. However, ``if
interest is brought down, then credit will pick up'' and earnings
may recover later this year, she said.

<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  Considering that a swap of Shawn Kemp for a Whopper
and a small drink would have passed the test as a fair deal,
Thursday's acquisition of All-Star forward Vin Baker could be
considered a monumental moment for the Seattle SuperSonics.
<p>
   But given the fact that this particular Sonic hole was largely
self-dug, it is a little hard to offer unqualified congratulations
for climbing back to the surface.
<p>
   By overpaying in 1996 for a player of Jim McIlvaine's limited
talents, the Sonics failed Business Management 101. The decision to
take on a salary that was preposterous even in the NBA's
unfathomable world was fated to cause in-house dissension.
<p>
   Unfortunately for them, the Sonics had on their roster a
champion dissenter. Kemp was so mortified about his deal relative
to McIlvaine's that he threatened to hit the self-destruct button
on his career, and take the Sonics with him.
<p>
   But as is often the case in these matters, the desperate seek
out the vulnerable. Sonic president Wally Walker, whose career as
hoops majordomo was in some jeopardy over the Kemp-induced fall
from the elite, found a guppy.
<p>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers had lost key players Chris Mills and
Bobby Phills, as well as center Mark West, over the summer, not to
mention many season ticket holders dismayed with coach Mike
Fratello, who produced the most entertainment-free style of
basketball since the bottoms were cut out of Naismith's peach
baskets.
<p>
   So with Milwaukee as the catalyst, Walker pulled off a
three-cornered bank shot of sufficient complexity that he announced
last night at the press conference the Sonics had acquired ``Vin
Webber.''
<p>
   Before reporters could scatter to research this mystery figure,
coach George Karl offered Walker the correct name. It could have
been worse  &MD;  he could have said Vin Askew.
<p>
   The man Walker and the Sonics are fated to know better is a
genuine stud-hoss, a 20-point, 10-rebound forward two years younger
and several hundred SAT points brighter than Kemp. He will never
have Kemp's explosive skills and thrills. But the man can read a
travel itinerary.
<p>
   Ultimately that will prove more useful to the Sonics than a
two-hand tomahawk jam, baby.
<p>
   Baker has a lot of Kemp's upsides with few of his downsides.
Thus the Sonics are made almost whole, and Walker slides off the
hook.
<p>
   ``In a lot of ways our mental health got better,'' said Karl,
who figured the club's second-round playoff elimination last spring
was due to ``our failure in the mental part.''
<p>
   Karl was more specific: Too many ``conflicts, confrontations and
confusion.''
<p>
   That addresses the most aggravating aspect of the deal: Kemp,
who signed his nine-year deal voluntarily, could have taken a high
road. Instead, he chose a selfish belligerence that nearly took
down the team and earned the enmity of the teammates who stood for
him last spring.
<p>
   In the narrow view, Kemp's tactic worked. He forced club
management to do his bidding by trading him to a team under the
salary cap, one that can give him a deal reflecting his talent in a
hyper-inflated market. If he had been less bellicose, the Sonics
might have believed they could talk him out of his pout.
<p>
   That's why Kemp steadfastly refused to talk to any Sonic
official and why he kept his teammates at arm's length. He knew he
would be vulnerable to their persuasion.
<p>
   In the broader view, Kemp's calculated obnoxiousness did severe
damage to an image and a career that had taken off. His fabricated
notion that matters were ``all negative'' for him in Seattle was a
slap to teammates, fans and franchise workers and cast a big shadow
over him throughout the league. The Bucks did not want a straight
swap of Baker for Kemp specifically because of all the baggage he
had heaped upon himself.
<p>
   While Kemp was crucial in making the Sonics a marquee entry in
the NBA of the 1990s, while he may have been the single most
spectacular performer in Seattle's pro sports history, his legacy
is scarred and his future around the NBA has been compromised.
<p>
   Three years ago he made an error in judgment when he signed a
long-term contract that was silly then and, by market standards
now, even more illogical. But he accepted no responsibility for his
misjudgment, instead making everyone else pay for his mistake.
<p>
   It would appear his subsequent tactics will get him what he
wanted. But the fact is, any future coach, teammate or owner who
spends any time listening to his contradictory doublespeak and
studies his history of betrayal and irresponsibility simply will
never trust the man to do what he says.
<p>
   That is a loss far larger than he will ever experience on a
basketball floor.

<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  The divorce is final.
<p>
   That annulment All-Star forward Shawn Kemp petitioned for so
vehemently all summer materialized Thursday. In a blockbuster deal
that involved three teams and five players, the Sonics traded Kemp
to Cleveland and wound up with another All-Star in return.
<p>
   The eight-year relationship between Kemp and the Sonics came to
its expected conclusion when Cleveland agreed to send All-Star
guard Terrell Brandon and forward Tyrone Hill to the Milwaukee
Bucks.
<p>
   The Bucks then sent All-Star forward Vin Baker to the Sonics.
Milwaukee also sent guard Sherman Douglas to Cleveland and received
a conditional first-round draft pick from Cleveland.
<p>
   Sonic president Wally Walker called the transaction one that is
best for everyone involved.
<p>
   Kemp got his wish. The Sonics apparently got their man.
<p>
   ``We talked all summer about the type of player we wanted and
the name we kept going back to was Vin Baker,'' Walker said. ``We
wanted a proven player, and we're thrilled to have him.''
<p>
   Baker, 25, is two years younger than Kemp. The 6-foot-10 power
forward also has two years left before he can opt out of his
contract. Kemp's six-year, below-market deal was partly the source
of his discontent.
<p>
   Kemp's unhappiness with his contract situation led to erratic
behavior that kept turmoil alive most of last season. The swap gave
the Sonics the ability to move on without strife being a major
concern.
<p>
   ``In a lot of ways our mental health got better,'' Sonic coach
George Karl said. ``Our focus got better. ... Our failures last
year were in the mental health department. We weren't strong enough
to overcome the basketball challenges.''
<p>
   With Kemp's missed planes, buses and tardiness to practices the
Sonics were plagued by distraction. They ended the season with a
second-round playoff loss to the Houston Rockets.
<p>
   ``The way the situation was going, something had to be done. I
hope this will satisfy Shawn,'' said Sonic forward Detlef Schrempf.
<p>
   ``We got a great player in Vin Baker. He's athletic, a good
overall basketball player. He passes and rebounds well, and he's a
good defender. He's quick enough to fit in with the defense we
play. Offensively, he'll have no problems.''
<p>
   The Sonics enter this season with a starting lineup that
features Baker, Schrempf, Jim McIlvaine, Gary Payton and Hersey
Hawkins. With Sam Perkins, Jerome Kersey and Nate McMillan in
reserve, the Sonics believe they can make a run for a third
consecutive Pacific Division title.
<p>
   Baker is a three-time All-Star and one of the league's best low
post players, averaging more than 20 points and 10 rebounds a game
last season.
<p>
   Without Kemp or an equivalent, Karl was preparing to employ more
of a guard-oriented, outside attack. With Baker, the Sonics can
sustain some dominance in the paint.
<p>
   ``Vin seems very encouraged and enthusiastic. We're going to
give him a lot of touches,'' said Karl, who when asked to compare
Baker to Kemp, called Baker ``longer'' and a better shooter and
passer.
<p>
   ``Not to say that Shawn didn't, but Vin will bring some things
that will help my game,'' McIlvaine said. ``Vin has a lot of
variety in his game. He can face up and shoot, and he's very mobile
for his size.''
<p>
   The Sonics are also very aware of Baker's easygoing image. Aside
being the son of a Baptist minister, Baker was endorsed by Payton.
The pair spent 10 days together in Europe while participating in a
Nike basketball tour.
<p>
   ``Gary is very sorry to see Shawn go,'' said Aaron Goodwin,
Payton's agent. ``He saw them as a dynasty and didn't want to break
that up. But Shawn gets his wish, and Gary gets his. He said if he
was going to lose Shawn, he wanted a guy like Vin Baker.''
<p>
   The Sonics tried to do a Kemp-for-Baker deal straight up. But
that hit a snag when Milwaukee worried that Kemp would not report
there. Cleveland expressed interest in Kemp all summer, but didn't
have the caliber player the Sonics commanded.
<p>
   The deal was finalized when Cleveland general manager Wayne
Embry reluctantly threw Brandon in the mix. Walker said he
contacted both clubs Tuesday to push along the process because the
Sonics were strongly considering another offer for Kemp.
<p>
   Sources within the organization said a deal for Denver's Antonio
McDyess was still a good possibility. Walker perhaps tipped his
hand to another potential trade for Washington's Chris Webber when
he mistakenly referred to Baker as ``Vin Webber'' several times
Thursday.
<p>
   ``I felt no pressure,'' Walker said. ``I was happy to wait it
out.''
<p>
   The Sonics didn't have any contact with Kemp all summer. They
were preparing to open camp and the season without him. Kemp,
bothered by negative publicity and accusations of alcoholism, vowed
he would ``never, ever, ever wear a Sonic uniform again.''
<p>
   Embry said he wasn't concerned about Kemp's past.
<p>
   ``We heard of the problems he had in Seattle,'' Embry said.
``But I don't think it's a problem as far as we're concerned.''
<p>
   Kemp's main desire was to be traded to a team with enough
salary-cap room to improve his contract. He has six years left and
is scheduled to make $3.6 million this season.
<p>
   The Sonics could offer Kemp only a one-year extension worth
about $17 million. Cleveland has between $6 and $9.5 million under
the cap to bolster Kemp's base salary. The Cavs can't renegotiate
with Kemp until Oct. 8, but seem willing.
<p>
   ``I do expect that his agent will be calling and I expect we
will respond to his call,'' Embry said.
<p>
   Walker said he didn't make the trade to accommodate Kemp,
although he wished the 1989 Sonic first-round draft pick well.
<p>
   ``Shawn was a great All-Star and really the cornerstone of this
franchise for a long time,'' Walker said. `` ... Despite what's
gone on recently, we all have a soft spot for Shawn.''
<p>
   Those feelings might change Jan. 8 and Jan. 17  &MD;  the two times
the Sonics and Kemp are reunited this season.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's benchmark stock index
fell below 18,000, led by blue-chip exporters and retailers, on
concern about the gloomy economy.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 stock average fell 347.25 points, or 1.89
percent, to 17,994.71 -- its biggest one-day drop since Sept. 11.
The Topix index of all shares on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell 24.57 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1393.48.
<p>
   ``Foreigners are selling off blue chips because they are worried
about the state of the Japanese economy -- worldwide, everyone is
writing down their GDP forecasts for Japan,'' said Pelham Smithers,
strategist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
<p>
   Pension funds have been pouring money into the market throughout
September to prop the benchmark above the 18,003.4 level where it
ended the fiscal year on March 31. That's to avoid posting latent
losses on equity holdings at half-year book closing next Tuesday.
<p>
   ``We've got a war at 18,000. As you go below 18,000 you get
trust funds buying, and above 18,000 you get foreigners selling,''
said Smithers.
<p>
   Hitachi Ltd. fell 50 yen to 1,030. Sony Corp. lost 300 yen to
11,300. Fujitsu Ltd. shed 60 yen to 1,530. Toyota Motor Corp. fell
60 yen to 3,640. Denso Corp. slipped 110 yen to 2,870. Honda Motor
Co. fell 40 yen to 4,280. Suzuki Motor Corp. fell 50 yen to 1,180.
<p>
   An estimated 460 million shares traded as of late afternoon, up
from 380 million the same time yesterday.
<p>
   Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent on the month, showing no sign
of inflation, the Management and Coordination Agency said. Prices
rose after salaried workers and civil servants had to double their
contributions towards medical costs on Sept. 1, leaving less in
consumers' slender purses for personal spending.
<p>
   ``Consumers got hit on the head three times -- with the increase
in consumption tax, the cancellation of tax rebates and higher
medical costs,'' said Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis
Investment Research Corporation. ``The government basically gives
no consideration to the impact what they're doing will have on the
people.''
<p>
   Ito-Yokado Co. lost 210 yen to 6,240. Seven-Eleven Japan Co.
fell 110 yen to 9,110. Daiei Inc. shed 60 yen to 690. Uny Co. fell
190 yen to 1,710. Takashimaya Co. fell 70 yen to 1,240. Jujiya Co.
declined 34 yen to 111.
<p>
   NEC Corp. was the day's volume leader, with 7.5 million shares
changing hands. The computer maker rose 10 yen to 1,470 after
Merrill Lynch analyst Kiyohisa Ota raised his rating from
``accumulate'' to ``buy.''

   Melbourne, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Australian stocks were mixed.
Banks fell after bond yields rose, while resource companies such as
Broken Hill Proprietary Co. gained after gold and crude oil rose.
<p>
   The benchmark All Ordinaries index fell 3.6 points to 2775.6.
The All Ordinaries index has risen 1.66 percent since the start of
the week.
<p>
   ``It's getting to the stage where I would be a bit cautious
about banks,'' said Rob Currie, investment director at Jardine
Fleming Australia Investment Management. ``They are getting to the
stage where they could be at the peak of their earnings.''
<p>
   Banks have ``been a pretty hot sector . . and this is a reversal
driven by bonds,'' said Tony Davidson, director at SBC Warburg
Australia.
<p>
   Bonds fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark October 2007 bond
9 basis points higher to 6.15 percent, following a fall in U.S.
dons overnight.
<p>
   The central bank's Deputy Gov. Graeme Thompson also warned
yesterday that banks' lending practices may cause credit quality
problems in the future. He added that the reform of banking
regulations earlier this month is likely to increase competition.
``This will be another force bearing down on margins and
profitability,'' Thompson said.
<p>
   National Australia Bank Ltd. fell 4 cents to A$22.36,
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. dropped 14.7 cents to A$17.073
and Westpac Banking Corp. fell 9 cents to A$8.74.
<p>
   Banks are often held for their relatively high dividend yields,
so rising bond yields make them less appealing. The average
dividend yield on bank stocks is 7.13 percent, compared with an
average of 5.0 percent for all companies within the 337-stock All
Ordinaries index. Banks also have substantial bond portfolios.
<p>
   Insurers, which also hold bonds, declined. National Mutual
Holdings Ltd. fell 9 cents to A$2.33, HIH Winterthur International
Holdings Ltd., declined 8 cents to A$3.52 and QBE Insurance Group
Ltd. fell 8 cents to A$8.62.
<p>
   Losses, though, were limited amid optimism a low inflation and
interest rate environment will drive earnings growth. ``There is
underlying strength (in stocks) still,'' said David Spry, head of
research at F.W. Holst &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate five times
since July last year to 5 percent. Core inflation was 1.7 percent
in the year to June.
<p>
   Resource stocks gained after gold, oil, and nickel prices
gained. Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest resources
company, rose 24 cents to A$16.05.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery rose US$3.60 to US$329.50 an ounce on
the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. That
extended the previous day's gain of US$1.70.
<p>
   Normandy Mining, Australia's largest gold producer, rose 6 cents
to A$1.72 and Newcrest Mining Ltd. climbed 3 cents to A$2.47 and
Lihir Gold Ltd. gained 8 cents to A$2.10.
<p>
   Nickel producer WMC Ltd. rose 17.5 cents to A$6.42 after nickel
for three-month delivery rose US$155 to US$6,595 a metric ton on
the London Metal Exchange.
<p>
   Woodside Petroleum Ltd. rose 23 cents to A$12.65 and Novus
Petroleum Ltd. gained 18 cents to A$5.00. Crude oil for December
delivery rose 45 cents, or 2.3 percent, to US$20.39 a barrel and
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Shares in G.E. Crane Holdings Ltd. rose 90 cents to A$16.20
after the non-ferrous metals products maker and plumbing supplier
said it entered into a joint venture with Netherlands-based Wavin
BV to acquire James Hardie's Australian plastic pipelines and
fittings business for A$121 million. G.E. Crane will pay A$89
million.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark for world stocks,
fell 58.7 points to 7848.01, as economic reports ignited concern
inflation may accelerate.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  California has gone loco for El Nino.
<p>
   Every hot spell, odd breeze, wayward hurricane, tepid sea
current, goofy-looking fish at the Farallones Islands or other
hiccup of nature seems to get anointed as another manifestation of
this all-around whipping boy for West Coast weather weirdness.
<p>
   Too hot for comfort? Gotta be El Nino. Super hurricane off
Mexico? El Nino. Fog gone? Ditto. Foggy? Ditto too. How about
marlin near Seattle? Strange clouds? Nearly naked surfers? Early
snow at Boreal Ridge in the Sierra Nevada? Out of beer? Shanked a
golf shot? Lost your keys?
<p>
   Right. Chalk 'em all up to El Nino.
<p>
    Experts are more careful. The remnants of Hurricane Nora now
drenching the southwest might have come farther north than usual
because of El Nino's influence, but overall California has
experienced the impact of El Nino only indirectly, if at all.
<p>
   ``As a scientist, I find some of the El Nino misinformation out
there exasperating,'' said Jan Null, lead National Weather Service
forecaster for the San Francisco Bay region. ``It has almost taken
on a life of its own at this point.''
<p>
   ``First of all, the warm water off the West Coast is not El
Nino,'' said John Monteverdi, chairman of the Department of
Geosciences at San Francisco State University.
<p>
   The warm water has lured tropical fish such as mahi mahi,
marlin, barracuda, and yellowtail tuna from their more usual haunts
well to the south of San Francisco. They are interesting and may
hint of vast climatic forces at work. But that doesn't mean they
are El Nino; in fact, temperatures off California have dropped a
few degrees in the past week.
<p>
   As for forecasts, reports in the media that rain this season
could be three to four times the average ``are the most egregious
exaggerations I can imagine,'' Monteverdi said. ``We've been trying
to find out where the number came from. Not from any meteorologist
I know.''
<p>
   The source for the 300 percent figure, it turns out, is
Reinhard Flick, an oceanographer for the California Department of
Boating and Waterways. But he has an explanation.
<p>
   He was talking mainly about what computer models project as
possible for San Diego and nearby areas, where he works at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography. Down there it only rains an average of
10 inches per year, so it's easy to triple the rain without needing
constant gully washers. ``It has happened down here,'' he said. ``I
don't know about San Francisco.''
<p>
   For most of California, during the biggest previous El Nino, in
1982-83, ``rainfall amounts were typically twice normal, not the
outrageous and irresponsible three or four times normal that have
been mentioned,'' Null said.
<p>
   It's not that scientists like Null and Monteverdi want to play
down El Nino. There's a whopper out there, all right, maybe the
biggest in 150 years. It already is disrupting weather in
Indonesia, Australia and South America. Locally, it does tilt the
odds toward a wetter winter in Central and Southern California, and
toward drought in Oregon and Washington. And it does mean that
water along the coast late this fall and winter will probably be
warmer than usual.
<p>
   They just think the buzz on the streets has lost track of the
facts.
<p>
   The water off California's coast is five to 10 degrees warmer
than usual. But it started warming up here last spring, when the
present El Nino was barely detectable, growing along the equator.
<p>
   ``It's connected to El Nino only because everything in the
atmosphere is connected at some level,'' Null said. ``But the main
reason it is warm is that we have had very light northwesterly
winds this year.''
<p>
   Without those winds, the upwelling of cold, deep water along the
coast has been weak, allowing warmer waters from farther at sea to
work their way to the coast.
<p>
   ``It takes three months just for the tropical west coast (Peru
and environs) to see the sea warming, and another three months for
it to spread up here,'' said Kevin Trenberth, head of the climate
analysis center at the National Center for Atmospheric Research
Boulder, Colo.
<p>
   But there is no escaping the size of this year's El Nino, even
if it's not here yet.
<p>
   NASA satellites show that a bulge of warm water half again as
big as the United States has migrated from the international date
line to the coast of South America, raising sea levels there by 10
inches.
<p>
   The water reaches temperatures as high as 85 degrees Fahrenheit,
10 degrees above normal. It could, indeed, soon add to our region's
unusually warm coastal waters. And humid rivers of air are starting
to make their way toward the Pacific Southwest, while jet streams
and storm tracks out of the Aleutians are kinking in odd ways.
<p>
   Researchers who have charted California weather going back
generations say El Nino, at the most, changes the odds of some
kinds of weather compared to others.
<p>
   But whether Central and Northern California will get flood,
drought, or neither is far from certain.
<p>
   Of eight ``type I,'' or major, El Ninos since 1950, six brought
higher than average rain to San Francisco, while two were drier.
The average was a rainy season one-third wetter than usual, or an
extra seven inches in San Francisco. The rainiest year in recorded
history here, in 1861-62, brought 55 inches of rain to San
Francisco, or about 2.6 times the average. Scientists are unsure if
that was an El Nino year.
<p>
   ``In some ways, all the talk is good,'' Null said. ``Every year
we try to tell residents to get ready for possible floods, and this
year they're listening.'' But, he added, ``you have to remember it
is not the amount of rain you get, but the distribution.''
<p>
   Last year was not an El Nino year, but the Central Valley had
some of the biggest floods in history because so much of the rain
fell in the first week of January. ``Overall, we had a absolutely
average rainfall total for the year,'' Null said. To be sure, some
really weird things really can be attributed to El Ninos, as seen
in 1982-83, said Michael Glantz of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research's Environmental and Societal Impacts Group in
Boulder.
<p>
   That season, an increase in broken backs in California,
snakebites in Montana, and bubonic plague in New Mexico all
plausibly could be blamed on El Nino.
<p>
   The reasons? Along the California coast, more body surfers were
injured because El Nino's storms changed the shape of the ocean
bottom in the surf line, sending the wave riders onto new and
unexpected sand bars. In Montana, dry weather forced rodents to
forage for food around houses and in towns; snakes followed the
rodents. In New Mexico, mild weather sent more people out hiking in
back country, exposing them to bubonic-infected fleas on wild
animals.
<p>
   Still, ``We are moving into a stage right now where everything
is going to be blamed on El Nino,'' said Glantz, a political
scientist. ``It is time to roll up our sleeves and sort out what we
can really blame on El Nino, and what we can't.''
<p>
   And if nothing much happens, forecasters hope they don't take it
on the chin from the public.
<p>
   ``We can talk about odds and what we think might happen, but
what gets lost is the uncertainty,'' said climatologist Lisa
Goddard at the atmospheric research center in Boulder. ``People
want us to say Southern California is going to get washed away, or
it's the hugest El Nino everywhere. If it doesn't happen, people
will say we don't know what we're talking about.''

   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bond futures rose as
investors looked ahead to a quarterly report next week which will
likely confirm the weak state of the economy.
<p>
   The Bank of Japan will release its ``tankan'' survey of business
sentiment Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast
that the headline index for major manufacturers would decline.
<p>
   ``The market is sticking to a pessimistic view of the economy,
'' said Akitsugu Bando, a portfolio manager at Okasan Capital
Management Co. There is no reason to sell until the release of the
quarterly tankan survey of business confidence, he said.
<p>
   Bond futures for December delivery rose 0.15 from yesterday's
Tokyo close to 128.48. Earlier it touched 128.54, a record high for
the most active futures contract.
<p>
   Cash bonds fell. The benchmark No. 182 bond, maturing in
September 2005, fell 39 yen per 50,000 yen in face value. The yield
rose 1 basis point to 1.90 percent. Yesterday it fell as low as
1.880 percent, a record low.
<p>
   Falling stocks also contributed to today's rise in futures, said
Takeshi Natio, assistant general manager in the bond department at
Daiwa Securities Co.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 Benchmark Stock Index fell 347.25, or 1.89
percent, to 17,994.71.
<p>
   Adding to optimism for bonds was strong demand at a bond auction
yesterday.
<p>
   Yesterday the Ministry of Finance sold 1 trillion yen ($8.3
billion) in 10-year bonds with a record low 2.2 percent coupon for
an average price over par. Although the bid-to-cover ratio on the
issue, a measure of demand, was lower than on last month's auction,
analysts said that isn't an indication of waning demand.
<p>
   ``There's no sense of overheating, and that's the most pertinent
remark you can make about the Japanese bond market right now,''
said Martin Foster, senior analyst at MMS International.
``Investors are clearly not waiting for next week's tankan to get
involved and many are running scared of missing the boat,'' said
Stuart Trow, an analyst at Norinchukin International Plc. Many
investors have decided that they cannot afford to delay buying
bonds any longer in the hope of a price dip, he said.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar rose against the pound
on a report Britain may advance its date for joining the European
monetary union.
<p>
   The pound plummeted against many currencies, and slowed the
dollar's decline against the mark.
<p>
   Members of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet are pondering the
prospect of joining the currency union by the year 2000, only a
year after the single currency goes into circulation in 1999, the
Financial Times reported.
<p>
   ``It is now clear that we must indicate our willingness to be in
there,'' the Financial Times quoted an unnamed minister as saying
concerning Britain's intent to be part of the single currency.
<p>
   ``The pound got pummeled on the report,'' said Takeo Suzuki, a
foreign exchange trader at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. ``The pound
was attractive because.Britain had been evading the issue of
monetary union.''
<p>
   The pound was last trading for 1.6195 dollars, down from 1.6298
dollars late yesterday in New York.
<p>
   The dollar was last trading for 1.7576 marks, down from 1.7609
marks in New York. The dollar had risen as high as 1.7628 in
response to the pound's decline.
<p>
   Yields as high as 6.61 percent on 10-year U.K. bonds imply
potential for inflation remains high in England.
<p>
   By comparison, the yield on a 10-year German bond is 5.53
percent, while a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 6.12 percent.
<p>
   That means the pound could depreciate in value when exchanged
for the single currency, Suzuki said. It also means the pound's
inclusion in the unit could reduce the allure of the mark, the
backbone of monetary union, he said.
<p>
   Against the yen, the dollar was last trading for 120.95, little
changed from 121.12 yen yesterday in New York.
<p>
   Prior to the report on Britain and monetary union, the dollar
had been falling against the mark on revived speculation of a
German interest rate increase.
<p>
   The dollar fell yesterday after Bundesbank director Helmut
Schieber said central bankers may have to ``move from an
accommodating policy to a neutral one'' on inflation, according to
Bridge News. Traders took the remark as a suggestion the central
bank may be preparing to raise rates.
<p>
   A chief way a central bank can bolster a currency is through a
rate rise; that increases the allure of bank deposits and bonds
denominated in that currency.
<p>
   The mark is poised to rise as the Bundesbank will probably raise
interest rates ahead of monetary union, set to begin Jan. 1, 1999,
said Richard Medley, head of Medley Investment Group, and a former
partner of international investor George Soros.
<p>
   For similar reasons, the mark may rise against the yen.
<p>
   ``Betting the mark will rise against the yen is an easy bet to
make right now,'' said Masahiro Yamaguchi, a manager of foreign
exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd.
<p>
   The mark was last trading for 68.865 yen, up from 68.795 yen
late in New York, after rising 0.87 yen yesterday.
<p>
   Germany said yesterday that import prices rose a
higher-than-expected 0.9 percent in August from July and by 5.4
percent from a year ago. The annual increase was the biggest since
1989. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a monthly gain
of 0.3 percent and an annual increase of 4.7 percent.
<p>
   Bearishness on the Japanese economy is helping offset a comment
Wednesday by Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, who suggested that officials from
leading industrial nations don't want the dollar to rise.
<p>
   The dollar has risen 8 percent against the yen since reaching a
seven-month low June 11 of 110.65 yen. After Sakakibara's remarks
Wednesday, the dollar tumbled 1.4 percent against the Japanese
currency. But after falling as low as 119.20 yen, the dollar
recovered half that lost ground.
<p>
   ``The Japanese economy is just too weak to heed Mr. Sakakibara's
warning,'' said Tokai Bank's Yamaguchi.
<p>
   Since Japan reported its gross domestic product fell 2.9 percent
in the April-June quarter -- the worst decline in 23 years --
government bond yields have fallen to new lows. The yield on the
benchmark No. 182 bond, due Sept. 20, 2005, has fallen to as low as
1.885 percent, the lowest anywhere in the world since World War II.
<p>
   When the dollar dipped on Sakakibara's remarks, fund managers at
Japanese life insurers and trust banks bought dollars to buy U.S.
Treasuries, which yield higher rates of return, Yamaguchi said.
<p>
   The ``Tankan,'' the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business
sentiment due out next Wednesday, will be ``a critical turning
point'' to gauge the Japanese economy, said Medley, who expects the
dollar to rise to 125 yen in coming weeks.
<p>
   The survey of 10,000 businesses will show that executives expect
profit growth to slow as tax increases in April continue to hurt
sales, economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said.
<p>
   The index for major manufacturers, the closest watched figure in
the survey, will be 5 compared to the 8 forecast in June's survey,
according to averaging of forecasts by 19 economists. The index is
calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say
business conditions are ``poor'' from those who say they are
``good.''
<p>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, though, may be more
concerned with rising U.S. trade friction than with low returns on
the voting public's retirement nest egg.
<p>
   The dollar's rise, which makes Japanese products cheaper in
overseas market, has triggered a surge in Japan's trade surplus.
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which ballooned to over $10
billion in July, is running at twice the level of two years ago.
<p>
   ``Sakakibara is hinting a further surge in exports will be big
trouble for the Japanese government,'' Yamaguchi said. ``I think he
spoke because he didn't want investors and traders comfortable with
the dollar's recent rise.''
<p>
   Once complacent, Yamaguchi said, curiosity may nudge traders to
push for even higher exchange rates, he said.
<p>
   The risk of angering U.S. trade representatives outweigh
benefits because ``exports aren't a big enough part of the Japanese
economy to drive it into recovery,'' Medley said. Exports only
account for 10 percent of gross domestic product in Japan, compared
to 30 percent in Germany, he said.
<p>
   There's a chance Japan will sell dollars for yen to back-up the
vice minister's admonishments once the dollar rises above 125 yen,
Medley said.

   Singapore, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Singapore electronics stocks
soared after a surge in U.S. orders for components and strong
earnings from Elec &AMP; Eltek International Co. confirmed that the
long-awaited rebound in the industry's well on its way.
<p>
   ``People are feeling the recovering coming in, kicking in,''
said Eddie Tan, an analyst at Vickers Ballas Investment Research
Pte.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Singapore Electronics Index, which tracks 28
stocks, jumped to its highest since July 28, rising as high as 3.57
points, or 2.15 percent, to 169.88.
<p>
   Creative Technology Ltd., which accounts for about 46 percent of
the index, and Advanced Systems Automation Ltd. touched record
highs.
<p>
   The U.S. Commerce Department yesterday reported a record 28.4
percent jump in August's orders for electronic components from
July, its first month-on-month increase since May. U.S. companies
are the biggest buyers of electronics components from Singapore
manufacturers.
<p>
   The rebound in orders was also confirmed by Elec &AMP; Eltek, which
attributed its better-than-expected 21 percent gain in earnings in
fiscal year ended June 30 to surging global demand for its printed
circuit boards earlier this year.
<p>
   The company's shares were 30 cents, or 3.75 percent, higher at
S$8.30 in recent trading.
<p>
   ``The theme is on the recovery of the electronics sector,'' Tan
said. ``The company has high operating margins, respectable
earnings per share, stable and visible earnings.''
<p>
   Creative Technology, the world's biggest sound card maker which
trades in Singapore and on Nasdaq, got a boost in U.S. trading
after research firm Robertson Stephens &AMP; Co. rated the stock a
``buy.''
<p>
   In Singapore the stock rose as much as S$1.50, or 4.05 percent,
to S$39.10, a record. On Nasdaq, the stock rose 13/16 cents, or
3.51 percent, to US$23 15/16 at Thursday's close.
<p>
   ``People are looking for stable earnings, stable growth, things
that are characteristics of blue chips,'' Tan said of electronic
stocks.
<p>
   IPC Corp., a maker of personal computers and has an interest in
telecommunications, recently said its first-half profit before a
gain more than tripled to S$18.8 million. The stock rose as much 3
cents, or 8.8 percent, to 37 cents. It was recently 1 cent higher
at 35 cents.
<p>
   There's also renewed interest in chip companies, as the island
state begins looks to high-skilled manufacturing rather than
labor-intensive, low-value-added products amid competition from its
neighbors.
<p>
   ``The play now is to look at companies buying into the
semiconductor business,'' Tan said.
<p>
   Advanced Systems Automation Ltd., a maker of semiconductor
equipment, rose as much as 22 cents, or 5.6 percent, to S$4.16, its
record. The stock was recently 20 cents higher at S$4.14. Advanced
Systems said it set up a unit in the U.K
<p>
   Sunright Ltd., a manufacturer of semiconductor testing
equipment, said it's set up a representative office in the
Philippines. Its stock rose 21 cents, or 9.3 percent, to S$2.46.

 &UR; GLOBAL ECONOMY: JAPAN'S CRUDE OIL IMPORTS FALL ON SLOW DEMAND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Compiled by Yoshikazu Komatsu &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a summary of
major economic indicators released worldwide today.
<p>
   JAPAN's imports of crude oil fell for the second time in the
last three months as demand from the nation's manufacturers
dropped.
<p>
   Crude oil imports in August totaled 22.088 million kiloliters,
down 12.2 percent from August 1996, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry said.
<p>
   Since demand for crude imports is linked to industrial
production, the decline could signal that manufacturers are cutting
output, analysts said.
<p>
   August's drop follows seven increases in the last nine months as
companies boosted output for export.
<p>
   Crude imports have risen this year as manufacturers boosted
production before an April tax increase. Since then, manufacturers
have shifted to exporting to offset a slowdown in sales at home.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To graph Japan's oil imports, see JNCO
Index &QR;  GP and JNCOYOY Index &QR;  GP for year-on-year changes.)
<p>
   TOKYO consumer prices in September rose 0.7 percent from August
and rose 2.1 percent from September last year, the Management and
Coordination Agency said.
<p>
   The month-on-month increase is largely the result of higher
medical costs which came into effect Sept. 1, the government said.
Inflation remains tame, it said.
<p>
   Excluding the volatile perishable foods category, prices
increased 0.8 percent in September from August and rose 2.3 percent
from a year earlier.
<p>
   Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said prices would rise 0.2
percent in September on month, and gain 1.7 percent from a year
earlier.
<p>
   Since the Tokyo data analyzes prices for the current month,
economists consider it a more significant indicator of Japanese
inflation than the nationwide numbers.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To graph nationwide CPI, see JNCPIYOY
Index &QR;  GP. For Tokyo CPI, see JNCPT Index &QR;  GP. Tokyo CPI
excluding fresh food, type JNCPTXFF Index &QR;  GP.)
<p>
   The NEW ZEALAND economy expanded a more-than-expected 1.2
percent in the second quarter, suggesting the economy might not
have as much slack as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand expected.
<p>
   That may mean the central bank won't sanction the credit easings
in the first-half of next year that it foreshadowed last week.
<p>
   The economy shrank 0.5 percent in the January-March quarter,
unchanged from the previously published figure.
<p>
   Today's quarterly figure left the annual growth rate unchanged
at 2.4 percent. Growth in the year ended March 31 was revised to
2.4 percent, the slowest pace since the year ended June 30, 1993.
The previously published March year growth rate was 2.3 percent.
<p>
   (Story illustration: for a graph of New Zealand's quarterly
economic growth rate compared with the same quarter a year earlier,
see NZNTGDPY Index &QR;  GP)
<p>
   AUSTRALIAN registrations of new motor vehicles rose as expected
in August, highlighting strong demand for vehicles due to price
discounting.
<p>
   Total registrations in the month rose 2.5 percent to 59,078
vehicles. The registrations in August were 9.2 percent higher than
the same month a year ago.
<p>
   Forecasts on average were for a rise of 2.3 percent, according
to a survey of 15 economists by Bloomberg News. New motor vehicle
registrations slumped 8.4 percent in July.
<p>
   Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd., one of the four companies
assembling vehicles in Australia, said sales have been strong this
year because new makes from Korea have ensured price discounting
and robust consumer interest.
<p>
   (Story illustration: to graph monthly movements in vehicle
registrations see AUVH Index &QR;  GP M)
<p>
   SOUTH KOREAN car exports fell in August for the first time in
six months, as financial trouble at the Kia Group cast a cloud over
the auto industry.
<p>
   Kia, which owns the country's third-largest automaker, has until
Monday to avoid defaulting on debts and being declared bankrupt by
creditors. Banks meet today to discuss who should shoulder the
group's $10 billion of debt.
<p>
   In August, car exports fell 2.2 percent from the previous year
to $700 million, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.
<p>
   Between March and July, exports rose about 20 percent. They
tumbled about 51 percent in January and almost 11 percent in
February because of nationwide strikes.
<p>
   In the first eight months of the year, car exports rose 7.9
percent from the same period last year to $6.768 billion, the
ministry said.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To compare Kia's stock with the benchmark

<p>
   The PHILIPPINES unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in July,
from 7.5 percent in the same month a year ago as the number of
agricultural jobs shrank, the government said.
<p>
   The National Statistics Office said the number of jobless
Filipinos rose 17 percent to 2.6 million. The highest increase in
those seeking jobs was in Metro Manila, the capital, where the
jobless rate was 14.1 percent.
<p>
   The government estimated the labor force at 30.2 million, a 1.7
percent increase from July 1996.
<p>
   Agricultural employment, accounting for two-fifths of all jobs,
fell to 11 million, down from 11.7 million a year before. Service
jobs rose 6.6 percent to 11.89 million.
<p>
   (Story illustration: PHUERATE Index &QR;  to graph the
Philippines' unemployment rate) &HT;    Record demand for electronics triggered the third consecutive
monthly increase in UNITED STATES factory orders for big-ticket
products in August, suggesting the economy continues expanding at a
healthy pace.
<p>
   Orders for durable goods rose a larger-than-expected 2.7 percent
to a record $186.598 billion, Commerce Department figures showed
today. That followed a revised 0.1 percent increase in July orders
to $181.677 billion, previously reported as a 0.3 percent drop.
<p>
   When often volatile category of transportation equipment is
excluded, durable goods orders rose 2.0 percent during August.
Excluding military hardware, orders increased 2.8 percent.

<p>
   UNITED STATES home resales unexpectedly rose in August as
mortgage rates continued to decline, an industry report
inadvertently released today showed.
<p>
   Resales rose by 3.3 percent last month to an annual rate of
4.320 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.
The report, originally set for release tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Washington time, was released by mistake by the industry group's
research department and disclosed by a bank's economics department.
<p>
   The figures represent actual closings, which lag contract
signings by a few months.
<p>
   August's increase was paced by gains in the South, Midwest and
West. In July, sales rose a revised 0.7 percent, less than the 2.2
percent increase the NAR originally reported.
<p>
   Home resales make up about 85 percent of all U.S. single-family
home sales.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To chart home resales: EHSLSL Index &QR; 
GP, type Page Fwd &QR;  for underlying data; Prices: EHSLAP)
<p>
   UNITED STATES 30-year fixed home mortgage rates fell to this
year's lowest level this week as the federal government's latest
statistics continued to show the economy vibrant with
low-inflation.
<p>
   The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reached 7.28
percent in the week ended Sept. 26, Freddie Mac said today. That's
below the previous week's 7.38 percent and the lowest level since
the week ended Feb. 16, 1996, when rates stood at 6.94 percent,
according to the mortgage underwriter, formally known as the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
<p>
   Freddie Mac also reported that the average adjustable mortgage
rate fell to 5.51 percent from the previous week's 5.53 percent.
Fifteen-year mortgage rates averaged 6.86 percent, down from 6.94
percent in the previous week.
<p>

<p>
   UNITED STATES businesses slowed their efforts to recruit new
employees in August, pulling the Conference Board's index of
help-wanted advertising down from recent highs.
<p>
   The business research group said its index of help-wanted ads in
51 newspapers across the country dropped 3 points to 84 last month
from 87 in July. Still, it remains above the level of a year ago,
when the index was 81.
<p>
   The business group said help-wanted advertising fell in two of
nine regions surveyed during the past three months. The biggest
loss occurred in Middle Atlantic cities -- which includes New York,
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh -- where the index fell 4.6 percent.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To chart unemployment rate: USURTOT Index &QR; 
GP, type Page Fwd &QR;  for underlying data.)
Fewer UNITED STATES workers applied for state unemployment benefits
last week, government figures showed.
<p>
   First-time jobless claims fell by 2,000 in the week ended Sept.
20 to a seasonally adjusted 306,000 -- the lowest level in seven
weeks, the Labor Department said. In the previous week, jobless
claims fell a revised 4,000 to 308,000, initially reported as a
5,000 drop to 306,000. Through the week ended Sept. 13, initial
claims averaged 324,838 per week for 1997 -- lower than last year's
weekly average of 350,519, and consistent with the strength in job
growth this year, economists said.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To chart weekly jobless claims, type:

<p>
   MEXICO's department store sales rose for a eighth consecutive
month in August, while sales at retail stores, which sell less
expensive merchandise,staged their second straight monthly rise, a
trade group said.
<p>
   Department store sales rose 16.3 percent in August from a year
earlier, their highest monthly increase since the December 1994
peso devaluation sent Mexico into its deepest recession since 1932.
<p>
   Sales at the nation's retail stores climbed 5.3 percent, their
first monthly increase since before the recession, said the
National Supermarket and Department Store Association, or Antad.
<p>
   (Story illustration: MEXBOL Index &QR;  GP for a graph of the
performance of the Mexican stock market index.) &HT;    BRAZIL's public deficit, the amount above revenue spent by
federal, state, and city governments, rose in July to 3.29 percent
of gross domestic product because of higher spending on public
workers salaries and payment of interest rates, the central bank
said.
<p>
   Brazil's public deficit rose to 3.28 percent in the month from
3.08 percent in June.
<p>
   Interest payments on the deficit rose to 3.72 percent of GDP in
July from 3.65 percent in June.
<p>
   Brazil's government is trying to close its public deficit to
consolidate an inflation-fighting program implemented in 1994.
<p>
   The federal government's deficit, including the central bank's
operations, rose to 1.84 percent of GDP in July from 1.65 percent
in June.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To chart Brazil's monthly M1 money supply,

<p>
   BRAZIL's sales of home appliances and consumer electronics in
Brazil fell for a fourth month in August, another sign that a
two-year buying binge is over.
<p>
   Industry sales of home appliances and electronics goods fell 17
percent in August compared with the year-earlier period, according
to the National Association of Electronics Makers.
<p>
   Unlike July, August sales also fell in relation to the previous
month's sales in yet another sign of a slowdown. August sales fell
0.3 percent compared with July sales, Eletros said.
<p>
   The sale of white goods declined 22.9 percent from a year-ago,
the biggest decline among categories. Unlike previous months, the
decline wasn't offset by sales of consumer electronics and small
kitchen appliances. The sale of consumer electronics fell 13.7
percent and small appliances 13.1 percent.
<p>
   Sales in the three areas also showed a decline in relation to
July. Sales over the first eight months of the year fell 2.4
percent compared with the year earlier period.
<p>
   (Story illustration: to graph gains in Brazilian home appliances

<p>
   GERMAN import price inflation accelerated faster than expected
in August to an eight-year high, as the deutsche mark fell to an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar.
<p>
   Import prices increased at a 5.4 percent annual rate, the
Federal Statistics Office said, the highest level since May 1989.
The increase from July was 0.9 percent, led by precious metals and
oil products. A rise of 0.3 percent was forecast by analysts
Bloomberg surveyed. They predicted a 4.7 percent annual increase.
<p>
   Today's report may dampen optimism inflation is calming after
news consumer prices in Western Germany fell a preliminary 0.3
percent in the month through mid-September, while the annual
inflation rate tamed to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent.

   GERMANY reported net capital outflows of 20.0 billion deutsche
marks ($11.3 billion) in July after inflows of 1.9 billion marks in
June, the Bundesbank said.
<p>
   Net outflows from German securities were 4.4 billion marks in
August, compared with outflows of 800 million marks in July.
<p>
   Yesterday, the Federal Statistics office said yesterday
Germany's trade surplus narrowed to 11.1 billion marks in July,
from 13.1 billion marks in June.
<p>
   The Bundesbank said in June and July exports rose almost 6
percent from April and May, seasonally adjusted, while imports
increased 5 percent.

   BRITAIN'S merchandise trade deficit with countries outside the
European Union rose to 359 million pounds ($578 million) in August
from 62 million pounds in July, as exports fell 7.7 percent and
imports fell 3.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
<p>
   The trade figures exclude so called ``invisible earnings'' such
as services, interest earnings and dividends.
<p>
   The shortfall between non-E.U. exports and imports last month
was smaller than expected.
<p>
   Separately, the ONS said that Britain's global trade deficit was
450 million pounds in July, more than the 400 million pounds
expected. Exports rose 4.2 percent and imports rose 0.7 percent.

<p>
   FRENCH final consumer prices for August were unchanged from
provisional figures, rising 0.3 percent in August and 1.5 percent
from a year ago, the government statistics agency said.
<p>
   France's annual inflation rate remains close to a 30-year low
and among the lowest in the European Union. It is well below the
Bank of France's target of a 2 percent annual rate. As a result,
the central bank is under little pressure to raise interest rates.
<p>
   The price gains in August stemmed from higher prices for
imported raw materials, particularly petroleum products, according
to Insee, the state statistics office. Oil is priced in dollars,
and a stronger dollar has pushed up its price in francs. Petroleum
products rose 2.0 percent for the month and 5.6 percent in the
year.

   ITALY'S unemployment rate fell to a lower-than-expected 11.7
percent in July, said state statistical unit Istat, thanks mostly
to an increase in agricultural and other part-time jobs.
<p>
   The improvement was mostly in the north and the center, with no
increase in employment in the poorer south. Analysts had forecast
the unemployment rate to drop to about 12.3 percent.
<p>
   While July's unemployment rate fell from 12.5 percent in April,
the highest since Istat introduced a new definition of unemployment
three years ago, it was unchanged from July a year ago. Istat
reports unemployment every three months.

<p>
   SPAIN'S unemployment rate, the highest in the European Union,
fell to 20.83 percent in June, from 21.17 percent in April, the
National Statistics Institute said.
<p>
   The June figure, which is based on surveys with Spanish
households in May, June and July, confirm the drop in unemployment
reported in the second quarter initially reported by INE. On July
30, the Statistics Institute reported the unemployment rate in the
second quarter fell to 20.94 percent from 21.49 percent in the
first quarter.
<p>
   The number of working Spaniards rose by 59,200 in June to 12.765
million people, while the number of unemployed dropped 5,800 to
3.359 million. The active population, or the total number of people
working or seeking jobs, rose by 53,400 to 16.124 million.

   SWEDISH industrial production rose 2.1 percent in July from June
and surged 11.7 percent from a year earlier, the Central
Statistical Bureau reported.
<p>
   Industrial orders, an indication of future industrial output,
increased 14.3 percent in June from May and increased 35.9 percent
from a year earlier, Sweden's Central Statistical Bureau said last
month.
<p>
   June export orders rose 2.6 percent, while domestic orders rose
29.8 percent from the previous month, boosted by a large order by
the Swedish Ministry of Defense.

   SWEDEN'S trade surplus rose to 7.9 billion kronor ($1.04
billion) in August from 7.8 billion a year earlier, Sweden's
Central Statistical Bureau said.
<p>
   The surplus was below analysts' average expectations of 8.6
billion kronor, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg News.
<p>
   Sweden exported goods worth 47.0 billion kronor in August, while
imports totaled 39.1 billion kronor.
<p>
   After adjusting for seasonal variation, the August surplus was
11.6 billion kronor, down from 12.2 billion in July.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- KDD Co., Japan's largest
international long distance phone service carrier, said it will
appeal a U.S. Federal Communications Commission decision to cut
rates for connecting overseas calls.
<p>
   KDD will submit its petition later today to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Tadashi Nishimoto,
KDD's president, said earlier this month that his company would
file an appeal opposing the FCC ruling.
<p>
   The move comes after the FCC decided last month to set up a
system of ``benchmark'' prices as of Jan. 1, 1998 to cut the amount
of money U.S. companies pay foreign phone service providers to
complete overseas calls.
<p>
   KDD said in a press statement that its petition criticizes the
formula used by the FCC to calculate its benchmark prices.
<p>
   It also charges that ``the FCC has no jurisdiction under
international law and U.S. telecommunications laws to tell foreign
carriers what ratio they may charge to terminate international
calls over their own networks in their own countries.''
<p>
   The FCC ruling could save companies such as New York City-based
AT&AMP;T Corp., Washington, D.C.-based MCI Communications Corp. and
Westwood, Kansas-based Sprint Corp. as much as $5 billion a year.
<p>
   Yet it threatens to cut KDD's revenue from the U.S. by up to
two-thirds, something which may have prompted a price-cutting
accord earlier this month between KDD and AT&AMP;T.
<p>
   The two companies agreed to slash connection charges from the
U.S. to Japan by 40 percent and by 70 percent on calls from Japan
to the U.S. The reduction brings down charges to about 25 cents per
minute from 42 cents for calls from the U.S. to Japan and to 13
cents per minute from 42 cents for calls from Japan to the U.S.
<p>
   KDD shares fell 70 yen to 6,920 yen ($57.19).

 &UR; JAPAN'S DIET TO LIFT HOLDING COMPANY BAN, SET DEFICIT LIMIT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Phred Dvorak and Mayumi Otsuma &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese banks would be allowed
to set up holding companies for the first time since World War II
and the government would be required to meet a deficit-reduction
target, under legislation being submitted to the parliament.
<p>
   The extraordinary session of the Diet that begins Monday will
consider a wide range of legislation, much of it dealing with the
government's ``Big Bang'' financial market reforms. These include a
proposal to provide funding for mergers between financially
troubled banks. The session will last through the end of the year.
<p>
   Analysts say the holding company bill and other legislation will
help nudge along the mergers and consolidation expected in the
industry.
<p>
   ``I say let's get on with the inevitable,'' said James McGinnis,
senior bank analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd. ``The
industry's going to consolidate.''
<p>
   The holding company proposal would partially eliminate a ban
imposed by the U.S. military during its postwar occupation of
Japan. The ban was put in place because the U.S. blamed the banks
for bankrolling Japan's war effort and wanted to limit their size
and scope.
<p>
   In June, the Diet lifted the ban on non-financial companies
establishing holding companies, which are firms that own enough
shares in other companies to have voting control.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry's latest proposal would limit banks'
holding companies to trust banks, brokerages, investment trust
companies and asset management companies. The umbrella companies
couldn't include real estate companies and other businesses.
<p>
   One still-unresolved issue, though, is tax consolidation, which
would allow holding companies to reduce their tax burden by
shifting the losses of some units to the books of profitable ones.
<p>
   Many companies say there's little point in setting up a holding
company if they can't derive that tax benefit. Still, others are in
favor of lifting the ban, saying that holding companies will give
them more flexibility to reorganize units and reduce work forces.
<p>
   The government says it won't decide on tax consolidation until
at least the end of the year.
<p>
   Another issue is how many shares companies within the bank
holding company group can own in other companies within the group.
The government plans to limit the group's combined shares in each
of the group's companies to 10 to 20 percent.
<p>
   The government will also submit legislation under which it would
be forced to reduce the fiscal deficit from this year's 5.4 percent
of gross domestic product to 3.0 percent or less by March 2004. It
would have to stop selling deficit-financing bonds by that time.
<p>
   To achieve that goal, the government plans to cut next year's
public works spending by 7 percent from this year and not increase
that spending in 1999 and 2000.
<p>
   The government also plans to reduce next year's assistance to
developing countries by 10 percent and not increase the aid budget
through 2000.
<p>
   It will keep social welfare spending next year at 300 billion
yen or less and keep growth at less than 2 percent in 1999 and
2000.
<p>
   The Ministry of Finance is also proposing that the Deposit
Insurance Corp., a semi-public institution set up to guarantee
deposits and pool funds for banking failures, be allowed to support
cash-strapped banks that merge.
<p>
   Currently, the corporation can only lend money to healthy
financial institutions that bail out failing banks or help write
off bad loans from bankrupt banks.
<p>
   Japanese banks were carrying an estimated 27.9 trillion yen in
bad loans as of March, much of it from speculative lending during
the boom years of the late 1980s.
<p>
   Analysts expect a wave of mergers and failures as weaker banks
topple under their bad debt and stronger banks resist government
pressure to support them.
<p>
   If the ministry's proposals pass, some of those banks may be
encouraged to merge, said Akira Mizobuchi, an analyst at Nomura
Securities Financial Research Center.
<p>
   ``In that sense, it could be extremely useful.'' he said.
<p>
   Yet the corporation has already drained its reserves by bailing
out failed institutions like Kizu Credit Cooperative and Hanwa
Bank. So even if the bill goes through, analysts say that the
corporation will need either increased premiums paid by banks or
public money.
<p>
   As Japan's biggest corporate racketeering scandal engulfs all
four of the country's biggest brokerages, the Finance Ministry is
pushing legislation that would raise fines for crimes like
hindering investigations, insider trading and reimbursing clients
for losses.
<p>
   Now, the maximum a bank can be fined for hindering an
investigation is 500,000 yen, the amount Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
had to pay in July for hiding loans it made to a gangster.

<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- China hasn't committed to
opening its markets sufficiently for the U.S. to back its entry to
the World Trade Organization, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said today.
<p>
   ``On WTO, our position remains unchanged,'' Rubin said at press
conference after he met with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.
``We are a very, very strong advocate of China becoming a member of
the WTO, but we believe it must be on commercially viable terms,
which means real opening of China's markets. In our judgment,
that's what the WTO is all about.''
<p>
   Liu said China still wants to become a member of the world trade
body, which mediates disputes between nation. Still, ``If the
requirement is too demanding, we will not join the WTO,'' he said.
<p>
   Asked about when China may be ready to join the WTO, Rubin said,
``I can't predict that. We welcome the tariff reduction (announced
by China yesterday on products like automobiles and appliances). It
is moving in the direction of opening markets in China. In terms of
WTO membership there are obviously a lot of other issues that
remain and non-tariff barriers.''
<p>
   Negotiators from the U.S. Trade Representative office in Beijing
this week were disappointed by the offers made by the Chinese side,
according to officials familiar with the talks. These include a
Chinese proposal to cut tariffs by a percentage point or less for
only about 290 items of the 6,000 products covered, while tariffs
for some 163 items would rise.
<p>
   China has been trying to enter the world trade body for more
than a decade. China's trading partners have insisted that Beijing
make a ``commercially viable'' that opens China's markets wider to
foreign goods in exchange.
<p>
   The U.S., the lead negotiator on China's entry, is particularly
anxious to get greater market access for its products and services
-- especially since China's trade surplus with the U.S. is surging.
The U.S. trade gap with China rose to $4.707 billion in July, the
highest level since October 1996, and it was 32.5 percent higher in
the first seven months of the year than in the same period of 1996.
<p>
   Separately, Rubin and Liu said nothing at the press conference
about the reaching of an agreement on the regulation of foreign
financial news and information companies in China. U.S. officials
had indicated yesterday that an agreement would be announced.
<p>
   Copies of the agreement, which seeks to hold China to
commitments made in May not to charge users of financial news an
administration fee of as much as 7 percent, were exchanged and are
now being studied to ensure the Chinese and English versions match,
a U.S. Embassy official said yesterday.
<p>
   The agreement makes no major changes to what Chinese authorities
had promised in May, but seeks to lock Beijing into those
commitments, the official said.
<p>
   In January last year, Beijing said it would tighten controls on
foreign financial news agencies selling services in China. The
rules are yet to be enforced.
<p>
   These companies include Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg
News, Reuters Holdings Plc and Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
<p>
   China said in May that it would not levy the 7 percent fee, but
intends to enforce other regulations, such the requirement of
foreign news organize to submit their list of clients and prices to
Xinhua.

<p>
   Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- As he makes his way
through thick, gray smoke, a Malaysian motorist in a newspaper
cartoon points to a truck belching black fumes and exclaims:
``Visibility is better today! I can see smoke up there.''
<p>
   Malaysians are trying to see the lighter side of the smoggy haze
that's enveloping most of the country from fires at plantations in
Indonesia.
<p>
   Some even see humor in what emerged this week as the problem of
two indexes, both hovering around 800.
<p>
   One is Malaysia's main stock index, which is languishing below
800, having lost about 38 percent of its value this year. The other
is a pollution index, which gained 34 percent crossing 800 this
week in the eastern state of Sarawak, sending it into a state of
emergency.
<p>
   ``Looks like the Composite Index is trying to chase the Air
Pollutant Index, which sure has risen very fast,'' said Irene Tan,
head of research at Vickers Ballas Investment Research.
<p>
   The pollution index has crawled back down, falling today to a
more manageable 350. Still, the haze is adding to the pall of gloom
hanging over the Southeast Asian country that's preparing for
tougher times, with a weaker currency and slowing economic growth.
<p>
   ``The haze is compounding the whole situation,'' said Tan Yan
Heong, assistant manager of investment at Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund,
which manages 2.4 billion ringgit ($784 million).``It will affect
the country's plantations, factory output and'' ultimately economic
growth.
<p>
   From glitzy hotels to coffee shops and offices, conference calls
between brokerages and their clients, to newspaper cartoons, the
haze is on everyone's mind. It even made its way to the
International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting in Hong Kong this
week. Amidst the fracas over the region's currency turmoil -- with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and international investor George
Soros trading verbal blows --Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim spent
almost as much time talking about the haze as he did about Malaysia
plans to restore investor confidence.
<p>
   Anwar was asked by reporters what he thought was the bigger
crisis for him - the haze or financial markets. He said, ``In Hong
Kong, financial crisis. In Sarawak, haze.''
<p>
   ``It's not only affecting the welfare and lives of our citizens,
but also economic life,'' he said.
<p>
   Economic life had begun hurting before the haze descended upon
Malaysia.
<p>
   Interest rates rose to as high as 14 percent in mid-July on a
costly attempt to defend the ringgit against speculators after the
Thai baht was devalued. This hurt companies, whose borrowing costs
rose and also people who wanted to buy houses.
<p>
   Moreover, Malaysia posted its biggest monthly trade deficit in
17 years, racking up a 2.8 billion ringgit shortfall for June.
<p>
   This added more pressure on the ringgit as a widening current
account deficit indicates there's increased demand for foreign
currencies. That hurts the ringgit and erodes the value of foreign
investors' ringgit-denominated holdings.
<p>
   The ringgit has tumbled 26 percent against the U.S. dollar since
July 1 while the Composite Index has fallen 26 percent.
<p>
   With the currency roiled and no sign of a slowdown in loans
growth, Standard &AMP; Poor's yesterday cut its long-term ratings
outlook on Malaysia for the second time in six weeks, calling the
country's credit growth ``unsustainable.'' The rating company
slashed Malaysia's long-term ratings outlook to ``negative'' from
``stable'' and warned of a growing possibility of a downgrade in
the country's long-term and short term ratings
<p>
   And that makes the country's outlook hazier.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Daiei Inc. shares slipped 8
percent after the government said consumer prices rose in September
because of a change to the way medical expenses are paid for.
<p>
   Tokyo consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September from August.
One reason is that Japanese workers have had to pay 20 percent,
instead of 10 percent, of their medical bills since Sept. 1, the
government said.
<p>
   The report, which otherwise showed stable prices, fueled
pessimism that sluggish domestic demand will cut into retail
revenues. Daiei, Japan's largest retail chain operator, led
Japanese retail shares down 3 percent.
<p>
   ``Everyone is concerned about retailers these days,'' said
Daniel Marull, a trader at Hoenig Securities Co. This is ``just one
more piece of bad news and the bigger retailers will get hit the
hardest because they stand to lose the most.''
<p>
   Japanese department store and supermarket sales fell for a fifth
straight month in August, another sign weak domestic demand is
failing to lift the nation's troubled economy.
<p>
   Demand for big-ticket consumer goods such as electronics and
furniture has waned since the government increased the national
sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in April.
<p>
   Under the revised national health care payment system which came
into effect Sept. 1, Japanese workers also have to pay higher
health insurance premiums.
<p>
   Daiei shares may have also been hit by the fall of subsidiary
Jujiya Co., a medium-sized chain store operator.
<p>
   Jujiya plunged 33 yen, or 22.8 percent, to 112, after falling as
low as 109.
<p>
   ``Daiei was probably pulled down by Jujiya's fall because
they're related companies with cross-shareholding,'' said Robert
Sasaki, a trader at Jardine Fleming Securities (Asia).
<p>
   Cross-shareholding means each of the two companies own shares in
the other, so Daiei's assets are reduced by a fall in Jujiya's
share price.
<p>
   Jujiya fell ``simply because everyone is worried about retailers
in general,'' Sasaki said.
<p>
   Daiei shares fell 50 yen to 690. Mitsukoshi Ltd. dropped 32 yen,
or 4.9 percent, to 621. Takashimaya Co. shed 70 yen, or 5.3
percent, to 1,240.
<p>
   Tokyu Department Store Co. retreated 21 yen, or 7 percent, to
279. Uny Co., a midsize supermarket chain operator, fell 190 yen,
or 10 percent, to 1,710. Seiyu Ltd., a midsize general merchandise
retailer, dropped 87 yen, or 13.4 percent, to 560.

<p>
   Hong Kong, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Billionaire property
developer Li Ka-shing raised his stake in Jardine Matheson Holdings
Ltd. to 4 percent, increasing his leverage over the company that
symbolized British colonial rule in Hong Kong.
<p>
   Li, an adviser to Beijing and a folk hero among Hong Kong
Chinese, spent more than $50 million to raise his stake from 3
percent. When Li first disclosed his investment last month, he said
his intentions were ``purely friendly.''
<p>
   Friendly or not, the latest move will give Li more sway over
Jardine, whose origins -- and acrimony with China -- date back to
Britain's arrival in Hong Kong in the 1840s. A decade ago, Li
failed twice to take over Jardines' property arm.
<p>
   ``K.S. Li may have something up his sleeve,'' said Nam Park, an
analyst at ING Baring Securities (H.K.) Ltd.
<p>
   As it did in August, the disclosure of Li's interest sent
Jardine Matheson stock soaring. The shares, traded in Singapore,
rose as much as 7 percent.
<p>
   Li's public backing may accelerate Jardine's expansion on the
mainland and pique other investors' interest. The 69-year-old
executive made the investments though his main companies, Cheung
Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Cheung Kong said the group has no plans to
increase its stake in Jardine Matheson. Jardine officials declined
to comment on this.
<p>
   Granted, Li is known as one of Hong Kong's most savvy traders.
His stake in Jardine may be nothing more than an investment.
<p>
   ``He's an investor, just like me,'' said J. Mark Mobius, the
president of the Templeton Emerging Market Fund, which owns stakes
in Jardine companies. Yet over the years, the British-controlled
Jardines' support for democratic reform in Hong Kong -- not to
mention its early days running opium -- drew fire from Beijing and
impeded its business in China. Some analysts say Li's stake in the
group may help soothe those old wounds. In August, Cheung Kong and
Hutchison Whampoa disclosed that they bought a little more than 3
percent of Jardine Matheson, the Jardine Group flagship, and
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., Jardine's property arm.
<p>
   Hutchison's interests include property, retailing, ports and
telecommunications. Cheung Kong is the territory's second-biggest
developer. Jardine Matheson, which predates colonial rule, is the
biggest trading company in Hong Kong.
<p>
   Hongkong Land is one of the biggest landlords and owner of 40
percent of the central business district.
<p>
   Those office towers -- whose tenants include the territory's
stock exchange and stock exchange regulators and investment banks
such as Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley --may be the prizes Li
wants.
<p>
   The Keswick family that controls Jardine may be willing to sell
them to finance a push into China, said Nikko Research Center
senior analyst Steven Thompson.
<p>
   ``For the Keswick family, they probably think it's now time to
sell Hongkong Land's assets,'' Thompson said. ``The only question
is what price are they willing to do this?''
<p>
   Another nod from Li, whose investment prowess has won him the
nickname ``Superman'' in the Hong Kong press, was enough to send
Jardine stock soaring.
<p>
   Jardine Matheson rose as much as 7 percent to $8.25. Hongkong
Land was unchanged at $3.30. The companies moved their listings to
Singapore from Hong Kong in 1995, citing a disagreement over
takeover regulations.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's benchmark stock index
fell below 18,000, led by blue-chip exporters and retailers, amid
pessimism the economy shows no sign of emerging from its slump.
<p>
   ``Foreigners are selling off blue chips because they are worried
about the state of the Japanese economy -- worldwide, everyone is
writing down their GDP forecasts for Japan,'' said Pelham Smithers,
strategist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
<p>
   The International Monetary Fund last week cut its growth
estimate for Japan this year in half to 1.1 percent.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 stock average fell 347.25 points, or 1.89
percent, to 17,994.71 -- its biggest one-day drop since Sept. 11.
The Topix index of all shares on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell 24.57 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1393.48.
<p>
   Hitachi Ltd. fell 50 yen to 1,030. Sony Corp. lost 300 yen to
11,300. Fujitsu Ltd. shed 60 yen to 1,530. Toyota Motor Corp. fell
60 yen to 3,640. Denso Corp. slipped 110 yen to 2,870. Honda Motor
Co. fell 40 yen to 4,280. Suzuki Motor Corp. fell 50 yen to 1,180.
<p>
   Pension funds have been shoveling money into the market
throughout September to prop the benchmark above the 18,003.40
level where it ended the fiscal year on March 31. That's to avoid
posting latent losses on equity holdings at half-year book closing
next Tuesday.
<p>
   ``We've really been struggling with the 18,000 level and finally
we capitulated -- the big problem is really we've just got so many
worries on the economy,'' said Celia Farnon, a director at Nomura
International Plc.
<p>
   An estimated 477 million shares traded, up from 412 million
yesterday, and above the six-month daily average of 403 million
shares.
<p>
   Decliners outpaced gainers 5-to-1 on the first section. The
Jasdaq index of over-the counter shares fell 0.34 point or 0.99
points to 34.17, a record low.
<p>
   Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent on the month, showing no sign
of inflation, the Management and Coordination Agency said. Prices
rose after salaried workers and civil servants had to double their
contributions towards medical costs as of Sept. 1, leaving less in
consumers' slender purses for personal spending.
<p>
   ``Consumers got hit on the head three times -- with the increase
in consumption tax, the cancellation of tax rebates and higher
medical costs,'' said Edwin Merner, president of Atlantis
Investment Research Corporation. ``The government basically gives
no consideration to the impact what they're doing will have on the
people.''
<p>
   On Wednesday, Japan said sales at department stores and
supermarkets fell in August, the fifth consecutive decline.
<p>
   Ito-Yokado Co., a major supermarket operator, lost 210 yen to
6,240. Seven-Eleven Japan Co., an Ito-Yokado subsidiary, fell 110
yen to 9,110. Daiei Inc., Japan's largest supermarket chain, shed
60 yen to 690. Jujiya Co., a member of the Daiei group, declined 34
yen to 111. Uny Co., another supermarket, fell 190 yen to 1,710.
Takashimaya Co., a department store operator, fell 70 yen to 1,240.
<p>
   Small and midsize construction companies plunged amid concern
about their fiscal health.
<p>
   Midsize Japanese construction companies are fighting for
survival amid a squeeze in public spending on construction
projects. Many are saddled with land bought during the 1980's
asset-inflated bubble. Land prices have plunged about 25 percent in
Japan since their 1990 peak. Since July, three construction
companies have gone bankrupt.
<p>
   ``The construction industry is beleaguered from all sides,''
said Toshihiko Okino, construction analyst at Schroders Securities
Japan. Fujita Corp. fell 9 yen to 71. Tobishia Corp. declined 15
yen to 91. Haseko Corp. trimmed 8 yen to 69. Sumitomo Construction
Co. fell 23 yen to 155. Aoki Corp. fell 6 yen to 45.
<p>
   Mitsui Wood Systems Inc. fell 170 yen to 555.
<p>
   In the April-to-July period, the wooden-house builder's revenue
was squeezed 10 percent, its operating profit shrank 15 percent,
and its orders fell 20 percent below the company's own forecasts,
said Koyoru Asamoto, West LB Securities Pacific Ltd.
<p>
   NEC Corp. was the day's volume leader, with 7.5 million shares
changing hands. The computer maker rose 10 yen to 1,470 after
Merrill Lynch analyst Kiyohisa Ota raised his rating from
``accumulate'' to ``buy.''

<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- China hasn't committed to
opening its markets sufficiently for the U.S. to back its entry to
the World Trade Organization, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said today.
<p>
   ``On WTO, our position remains unchanged,'' Rubin said at press
conference after he met with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.
``We are a very, very strong advocate of China becoming a member of
the WTO, but we believe it must be on commercially viable terms,
which means real opening of China's markets. In our judgment,
that's what the WTO is all about.''
<p>
   Liu said China still wants to become a member of the world trade
body, which mediates disputes between nation. Still, ``If the
requirement is too demanding, we will not join the WTO,'' he said.
<p>
   China has been trying to enter the world trade body for more
than a decade, while the U.S., the lead negotiator on China's
entry, is pressing for greater market access for its products and
services -- especially since China's trade surplus with the U.S. is
surging. The U.S. trade gap with China rose to $4.707 billion in
July, the highest level since October 1996, and it was 32.5 percent
higher in the first seven months of the year than in the same
period of 1996.
<p>
   Asked about when China may be ready to join the WTO, Rubin said,
``I can't predict that. We welcome the tariff reduction (announced
by China yesterday on products like automobiles and appliances). It
is moving in the direction of opening markets in China. In terms of
WTO membership there are obviously a lot of other issues that
remain and non-tariff barriers.''
<p>
   Negotiators from the U.S. Trade Representative office in Beijing
this week were disappointed by the offers made by the Chinese side,
according to officials familiar with the talks. These include a
Chinese proposal to cut tariffs by a percentage point or less for
only about 290 items of the 6,000 products covered, while tariffs
for some 163 items would rise.
<p>
   The lack of progress in the talks suggests Chinese President
Jiang Zemin hasn't been successful in getting warring factions
among Chinese bureaucrats, intent on protecting their fiefdoms, to
agree to sweetened WTO terms. Analysts said it will be up to
Clinton to press Jiang at their summit to force such discipline on
his government's agencies.
<p>
   ``The Chinese have always seen membership in the World Trade
Organization as a political exercise. They don't recognize there is
a substantive dimension,'' said Greg Mastel, senior policy analyst
at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank.
<p>
   ``Jiang has been swayed by concerns driven by Chinese
bureaucrats who would lose their jobs'' if China's import regime
were rationalized and state-owned companies turned into private
enterprises. ``That represents a significant section of China's
leadership, and is slowing down the process,'' Mastel said.
<p>
   Rubin's message to China on WTO comes at a sensitive time for
Boeing Co., which is waiting on word from China about an order for
up to $2 billion in jetliners.
<p>
   Rubin yesterday suggested to China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
that China announce its expected Boeing order during U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley's visit to China from October 6-10 -- and
not when Jiang visits Washington next month, U.S. officials said.
<p>
   Announcements of such big-ticket contracts are often a staple of
state visits. In this case, though, while the Clinton
administration has been pressing hard for the Boeing order, Rubin
told the Chinese the administration is sensitive about President
Bill Clinton being linked to business deals involving China, a U.S.
official said.
<p>
   The U.S. Democratic Party has been criticized for receiving
foreign campaign funding during the 1996 election, and Republicans
in Congress charged that Chinese donations may have illegally been
routed to the Clinton re-election campaign. Chinese officials have
denied those charges.
<p>
   The separation of the summit and a big aircraft deal is also in
the interest of Seattle, Washington-based Boeing, the world's
biggest aircraft producer. The company has seen its sales in China
regularly snagged in recent years by the often-turbulent U.S.-China
relations.
<p>
   Boeing Chairman and CEO Philip M. Condit urged yesterday in a
speech in Washington that the U.S. continue to engage China to
insure that promises to open markets and sell off state-owned
companies are realized. ``As China moves in that direction, it is
embracing economic reforms,'' Condit said. ``We have a chance to
begin to lock in those reforms, to insure that China moves down the
road to a market economy and open trade.''
<p>
   Condit said it's unrealistic for the U.S. to expect China to
address all of its concerns before backing its entry into the WTO.
``It would be foolish to say you've got to get everything done
before we start, because that's a formula for not getting anything
done,'' he said.
<p>
   On a separate issue, Rubin said there has only been ``sporadic
implementation'' of a 1994 agreement to restrict exports of goods
made by Chinese prison labor. He said it is an issue both sides
will revisit. ``It's certainly a difficult problem,'' he said.
<p>
   Rubin and Liu did not announce at the press conference that an
agreement had been reached on the regulation of foreign financial
news and information companies in China. U.S. officials had
indicated yesterday that an agreement would be announced.
<p>
   Copies of the agreement, which seeks to hold China to
commitments made in May not to charge users of financial news an
administration fee of as much as 7 percent, were exchanged and are
now being studied to ensure the Chinese and English versions match,
a U.S. Embassy official said yesterday.
<p>
   The agreement makes no major changes to what Chinese authorities
had promised in May, but seeks to lock Beijing into those
commitments, the official said.
<p>
   In January last year, Beijing said it would tighten controls on
foreign financial news agencies selling services in China. The
rules are yet to be enforced.
<p>
   These companies include Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg
News, Reuters Holdings Plc and Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
<p>
   China said in May that it would not levy the 7 percent fee, but
intends to enforce other regulations, such the requirement of
foreign news organize to submit their list of clients and prices to
Xinhua.

<p>
   Melbourne, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Australian stocks were mixed.
Banks fell amid concern their price may be exceeding their earnings
growth potential, while resource companies such as Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. gained after gold and crude oil rose.
<p>
   The benchmark All Ordinaries index fell 3.6 points to 2775.6.
Within the 337-stock index 132 stocks fell and 104 stocks rose. The
All Ordinaries index has risen 1.66 percent since the start of the
week.
<p>
   ``It's getting to the stage where I would be a bit cautious
about banks,'' said Rob Currie, investment director at Jardine
Fleming Australia Investment Management. ``They are getting to the
stage where they could be at the peak of their earnings.'' The
central bank's Deputy Gov. Graeme Thompson also warned yesterday
that banks' lending practices may cause credit quality problems in
the future. He added that the reform of banking regulations earlier
this month is likely to increase competition. ``This will be
another force bearing down on margins and profitability,'' Thompson
said. Bank shares also dropped as bonds fell, pushing the yield on
the benchmark October 2007 bond 12 basis points higher to 6.18
percent, following a fall in U.S. bonds. Banks have ``been a pretty
hot sector . . and this is a reversal driven by bonds,'' said Tony
Davidson, director at SBC Warburg Australia. National Australia
Bank Ltd. fell 4 cents to A$22.36, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
Ltd. dropped 14.7 cents to A$17.073 and Westpac Banking Corp. fell
9 cents to A$8.74.
<p>
   Banks are often held for their relatively high dividend yields,
so rising bond yields make them less appealing. The average
dividend yield on bank stocks is 7.13 percent, compared with an
average of 5.0 percent for all companies within the 337-stock All
Ordinaries index. Banks also have substantial bond portfolios.
<p>
   Insurers, which also hold bonds, declined. National Mutual
Holdings Ltd. fell 9 cents to A$2.33, HIH Winterthur International
Holdings Ltd., declined 8 cents to A$3.52 and QBE Insurance Group
Ltd. fell 8 cents to A$8.62.
<p>
   Losses, though, were limited amid optimism a low inflation and
interest rate environment will drive earnings growth. ``There is
underlying strength (in stocks) still,'' said David Spry, head of
research at F.W. Holst &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate five times
since July last year to 5 percent. Core inflation was 1.7 percent
in the year to June.
<p>
   Resource stocks gained after gold, oil, and nickel prices
gained. Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest resources
company, rose 24 cents to A$16.05.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery rose US$3.60 to US$329.50 an ounce on
the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. That
extended the previous day's gain of US$1.70.
<p>
   Normandy Mining, Australia's largest gold producer, rose 6 cents
to A$1.72 and Newcrest Mining Ltd. climbed 3 cents to A$2.47 and
Lihir Gold Ltd. gained 8 cents to A$2.10.
<p>
   Nickel producer WMC Ltd. rose 17.5 cents to A$6.42 after nickel
for three-month delivery rose US$155 to US$6,595 a metric ton on
the London Metal Exchange.
<p>
   Woodside Petroleum Ltd. rose 23 cents to A$12.65 and Novus
Petroleum Ltd. gained 18 cents to A$5.00. Crude oil for December
delivery rose 45 cents, or 2.3 percent, to US$20.39 a barrel and
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Shares in G.E. Crane Holdings Ltd. rose 90 cents to A$16.20
after the non-ferrous metals products maker and plumbing supplier
said it entered into a joint venture with Netherlands-based Wavin
BV to acquire James Hardie's Australian plastic pipelines and
fittings business for A$121 million. G.E. Crane will pay A$89
million.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark for world stocks,
fell 58.7 points to 7848.01, as economic reports ignited concern
inflation may accelerate.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Nagasakiya Co. shares sank,
bringing two-day losses to 28 percent, after the Japanese general
merchandise retailer said it would post a first-half pretax profit
loss.
<p>
   Nagasakiya, which supplies apparel and other goods to its
nationwide chain of franchise stores, fell 40 yen, or 17.7 percent,
to 186 yen today after falling 10.3 percent yesterday.
<p>
   The Tokyo-based retailer said on Wednesday that it would
probably report a current, or pretax, loss of 300 million yen ($2.5
million) and a net loss of 600 million yen in the six months to
August because of weak sales following a sales tax increase.
<p>
   The company said it initially expected a current profit of 300
million yen and to break even at the net level.
<p>
   Japanese retailers as a group fell 3 percent today after the
government said Tokyo consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September
from August because of higher medical costs.
<p>
   ``Everyone is concerned about retailers these days,'' said
Daniel Marull, a trader at Hoenig Securities Co. ``The government's
announcement is just one more piece of bad news.''
<p>
   Japan's retail stores have suffered since the national sales tax
was boosted to 5 percent from 3 percent on April 1.
<p>
   Department store and supermarket sales fell for a fifth straight
month in August in another reflection that weak domestic demand is
failing to lift the nation's troubled economy.
<p>
   Sales of big-ticket consumer goods such as electronics and
furniture have been sliding since the government in April increased
the national sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent.
<p>
   Concerns about the strength of Japan's retailers was fanned last
week when Yaohan Japan Corp. obtained protection from its creditors
after failing to attract customers to its growing number of stores
overseas.

   Singapore, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Indonesian and Thai stocks
fell as weakening currencies fueled concern the two countries will
be forced to keep interest rates high, slowing economic growth.
<p>
   ``Every time you think it's settled down, you have moves like
this that really undermines your confidence,'' said Guha Roy, who
helps manage $250 million in Asian stocks for Koeneman Capital
Management Ltd. in Singapore.
<p>
   Higher rates attract investors to a country's currency. They
also, however, raise the cost of borrowing, eating into profits and
slowing economic growth.
<p>
   Banks led the decline in both markets.
<p>
   In other Asian markets, Japan's benchmark stock index fell below
18,000, led by blue-chip exporters and retailers, on concern about
the economy's stumbling recovery. Hong Kong stocks also fell, led
by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and China shares.
<p>
   The Indonesian rupiah plunged to a record low on concern
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. may slash its ratings outlook on the
country, following cuts in outlooks for neighboring Malaysia and
the Philippines. The Thai baht also weakened after Thomson
BankWatch downgraded its sovereign risk rating for Thailand.
<p>
   The credit rating unit of Thomson Corp. cut Thailand's credit
rating to ``BBB'' from ``A-'' citing the country's currency
instability.
<p>
   The benchmark Thai index snapped a three-day rally, falling as
much as 8.6 points, or 1.52 percent, to 558.76. The main index in
Indonesia slipped 10.22 points, or 1.83 percent, to 549.
<p>
   ``There's speculation that Indonesia will be the next one to
have its ratings'' cut, said Sani Hamid, an analyst at MMS
International.
<p>
   Investors were seeing ``the rupiah stabilizing again, and
gaining a bit of confidence -- but now it's gone,'' said Willianto
Ie, an analyst at Nava SC Securities.
<p>
   Bank Internasional Indonesia dropped 25 rupiah to 1,000, and
Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia dropped 25 rupiah to 675.
<p>
   Malaysian stocks were mixed amid concern borrowing costs will
rise after Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. cut Malaysia's long-term ratings
outlook for a second time in six weeks.
<p>
   ``The market is still affected by the currency's volatility, and
the S&AMP;P cut doesn't help,'' said Chong Sui San, who helps to manage
420 million ringgit ($135.5 million) at Pacific Mutual Funds Sdn.
<p>
   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index gained 1.11 points,
or 0.14 percent, to 790.44. The broader KL Emas Index fell 0.03
point, or 0.01 percent, to 224.53. Falling stocks outnumbered
rising stocks by 307 to 201.
<p>
   Malayan Banking lost 20 sen to 15.80 ringgit, its third decline
this week. Hong Leong Bank Bhd. fell 6 sen to 4.92 ringgit, its
biggest one-day decline in four days. MBf Capital Bhd., which owns
Malaysia's largest finance company, slid 4 sen to 2.68 ringgit.
Japan, Hong Kong
<p>
   In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average fell 347.25 points, or
1.89 percent, to 17,994.71 -- its biggest one-day drop since Sept.
11. The Topix index of all shares on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell 24.57 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1393.48.
<p>
   ``Foreigners are selling off blue chips because they are worried
about the state of the Japanese economy -- worldwide, everyone is
writing down their GDP forecasts for Japan,'' said Pelham Smithers,
strategist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
<p>
   Hong Kong stocks also fell, led by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.
and China shares.
<p>
   Cathay Pacific slid 3.3 percent amid concern slumping earnings
won't turn around any time soon.
<p>
   Chinese state-owned companies such as Shanghai Petrochemical Co.
dropped after rising more than 11 percent yesterday as a group.
<p>
   ``They got way ahead of themselves,'' said Richard Verin, head
of Asian sales at Credit Suisse First Boston (HK) Ltd. ``There are
a lot of short-term players in the market.''
<p>

   Manila Electric Co., a power distributor known as Meralco, rose.

15.22 to 2080.78, ending the week with a 0.1 percent gain.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg)-- The following is a summary of
global currency activity:
<p>
   The DOLLAR rose against the British POUND on a report Britain
may advance its date for joining the European monetary union.
<p>
   The pound plummeted against many currencies, and slowed the
dollar's decline against the mark.
<p>
   Members of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet are pondering the
prospect of joining the currency union by the year 2000, only a
year after the single currency goes into circulation in 1999, the
Financial Times reported.
<p>
   ``It is now clear that we must indicate our willingness to be in
there,'' the Financial Times said, citing an unnamed minister.
<p>
   ``The pound got pummeled on the report,'' said Takeo Suzuki, a
foreign exchange trader at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. ``The pound
was attractive because Britain had been evading the issue of
monetary union.''
<p>
   The pound last traded for 1.6195 dollars, down from 1.6298
dollars late yesterday in New York.
<p>
   The dollar was last trading for 1.7576 marks, down from 1.7609
marks in New York. The dollar had risen as high as 1.7628 in
response to the pound's decline.

<p>
   The AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR fell, paring earlier gains, after Prime
Minister John Howard announced the resignation of a third senior
minister.
<p>
   Science Minister Peter McGauran resigned after admitting he made
false travel expense claims.
<p>
   ``The dollar dropped about 20 points because of this,'' said
Steve Chater, senior foreign exchange dealer at IBJ Australia.
Political instability ``is a real downer for the dollar.''
<p>
   The dollar fell a fifth of a cent, to as low as 72.39 U.S. cents
from 72.65 cents before the Prime Minister's announcement.
Yesterday, the dollar was 72.54 cents.
<p>
   Transport Minister John Sharp and Minister for Administrative
Services David Jull resigned on Wednesday after it was revealed
Jull failed to disclose Sharp's repayment of A$9,000 (US$6,500) in
expenses to which he was not entitled.
<p>
   (Story illustration: to graph the Australian dollar's
performance against the U.S. dollar type AUD Crncy &QR;  GP)
<p>
   The RUPIAH plunged to a record low, on concern Standard &AMP; Poor's
Corp. may slash its ratings outlook on Indonesia following cuts in
outlooks for neighboring Malaysia and the Philippines.
<p>
   The rupiah weakened as much as 3.0 percent to 3,095 to the
dollar. It's the rupiah's third day of decline.
<p>
   ``There's a lot of speculation going around that Indonesia will
be the next one which will have its ratings'' cut, said Sani Hamid,
an analyst at MMS International.
<p>
   S&AMP;P today cut the Philippines' rating outlook to ``stable'' from
``positive,'' reflecting the fading prospect of an upgrade in the
next one to three years.
<p>
   Yesterday, Standard &AMP; Poor's slashed Malaysia's long-term
ratings outlook to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' The ratings
company warned of a growing possibility of a downgrade in
Malaysia's long-term and short-term ratings. The cut would raise
borrowing costs for banks and companies.
<p>

Indonesian rupiah performance.)
<p>
   The NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR rose to a four-week high after recent
eurokiwi bond sales showed investors have confidence in New Zealand
assets.
<p>
   Demand also has been buoyed by the central bank's credit policy
statement last week, which showed there's scope for more growth
with little inflation.
<p>
   ``Much of the interest in the kiwi is centered around our
attractive yields and a better insight as to what the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand wants,'' Bancorp Treasury Services said in its
morning report.
<p>
   The New Zealand dollar, known informally as the kiwi, traded
recently at 64.37 U.S. cents, up from 64.23 cents in late domestic
trading yesterday. It traded as high as 64.41 cents, its highest
since Aug. 29 when it reached 64.57 cents.
<p>
   Eurokiwi bonds are denominated in New Zealand dollars and sold
to offshore investors wanting to receive the nation's yields, which
are among the highest of any developed country.
<p>
   (Story illustration: for a graph of the New Zealand dollar
against the U.S. dollar, see NDS Crncy &QR;  GPO)
<p>
   THE DOLLAR fell against the mark on revived speculation of a
German interest rate rise, while it rose against the yen as falling
Japanese bond yields drove investors to seek higher returns
elsewhere. The dollar fell to 1.7590 marks from 1.7717 marks
yesterday and rose to 120.90 yen from 120.35 yen.
<p>
   The dollar slumped against the mark after Bundesbank council
member Helmut Schieber said central bankers may have to ``move from
an accommodating policy to a neutral one'' on inflation, according
to Bridge News. Traders took the remark as a suggestion the central
bank may be preparing to raise rates.
<p>
   The mark got another boost against the dollar after Germany
reported August import prices rose a faster-than-expected 0.9
percent from July and 5.4 percent from a year ago. The annual
increase was the biggest since 1989. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News expected a monthly gain of 0.3 percent and an annual
increase of 4.7 percent.
<p>
   The dollar rose versus the yen in Asian trading after the yield
on Japan's benchmark bond sank to a record low on expectations that
continued poor economic performance will keep the Bank of Japan
from raising interest rates any time soon.
<p>
   (Story illustration: To graph the dollar's performance against
the Japanese yen, type JYS Crncy &QR;  GP, GIP, GIP5 or GPO.

<p>
   The CANADIAN DOLLAR rose more than a quarter of a cent against
its U.S. counterpart after reports showing strong U.S. growth
raised expectations of higher interest rates soon.
<p>
   U.S. durable goods orders jumped 2.7 percent last month, while
existing home sales, which were released earlier than anticipated,
climbed 3.3 percent. Both reports were above economists' forecasts.
<p>
   That raised anticipation that the Federal Reserve policy makers
may raise U.S. lending rates sooner than expected, prompting the
Bank of Canada to raise its own benchmark rate to keep the Canadian
dollar and securities denominated in it competitive. Fed policy
makers meet next week and again in November.
<p>
   The dollar rose to 72.31 U.S. cents, its highest since Sept. 8,
up more than a quarter of a cent from yesterday's close of 72.04
U.S. cents.
<p>
   (Story illustration: For a chart mapping the value of the
Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency during the past three

<p>
   The DOLLAR slipped against the deutsche mark, extending
yesterday's losses after comments by Bundesbank officials and a
rise in August import prices revived talk of higher German interest
rates.
<p>
   Bundesbank council member Helmut Schieber said ``perhaps the
time is coming where one may have to move from an accommodating
policy to a neutral one,'' Bridge News reported. Schieber was
speaking at a World Bank conference in Hong Kong.
<p>
   The dollar slipped as low as 1.7645 marks from 1.7740 late
yesterday. It was last at 1.7685 marks.
<p>
   (Story illustration: DEM or JPY Crncy &QR;  GIP, GIP5, GPO or

<p>
   The BRITISH POUND rose almost 1 percent against the deutsche
mark and the dollar after a smaller-than-expected U.K. trade
deficit left intact expectations of higher rates, traders said.
<p>
   The August trade deficit with countries outside the European
Union widened to 359 million pounds ($578 million) from 62 million
pounds in July. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a
deficit of 500 million pounds. The prospect of higher rates -- and
a higher return on sterling-denominated deposits -- drove the pound
to 2.8794 against the mark, from 2.8505 earlier.
<p>
   (Story illustration: GBP or DMBP Crncy &QR;  GIP, GIP5, GPO,

<p>
   The CZECH KORUNA rose to 33.123 korunas per dollar at today's
official currency fix, said the Czech central bank in a statement.
The rate is set at 11.00 a.m. Prague time and is valid for the next
day. The koruna was up from 33.289 korunas per dollar at
yesterday's fix and up from 33.302 korunas a week ago. The koruna
was fixed at 18.67 korunas per deutsche mark, unchanged from 18.67
at yesterday's fix.

today's official currency fix, said the Hungarian central bank in a
statement.
<p>
   The rate is set at 12:00 noon Budapest time.
<p>
   The forint was up from 196.07 forints per dollar at Yesterday's

from 109.92 at yesterday's fix.

   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The European Union asked the
World Trade Organization to look into South Korea's tax on imported
alcoholic beverages on the eve of an international conference aimed
at expanding Asia-Europe trade.
<p>
   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Japanese Trade
Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi, European Union Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan will join their counterparts from most Asian and
European countries in Tokyo this weekend to discuss ways to boost
trade between the two regions.
<p>
   The dispute over South Korean liquor taxes and China's bid to be
admitted to the WTO will likely be high on the agenda.
<p>
   Korea's liquor tax is a ``long-standing trade irritant'' in an
industry where the EU has ``a major economic interest,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's ambassador in Geneva, said in a statement
yesterday to the global trade watchdog's Dispute Settlement Body,
which rules on trade spats.
<p>
   Companies such as Guinness, Plc, Grand Metropolitan Plc and
Allied Domecq Plc stand to gain if South Korean's 100 percent tax
on imported whiskey is cut. The tax on Soju, a Korean spirit, is
32.5 percent, favoring Korean companies such as Jinro Ltd.

   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- In the days before the operator
of Starbucks Japan went public on Sept. 1, investors bid for three
times as many shares as were available, hoping to snatch up what
was expected to be one of the year's top issues.
<p>
   Since the offering, Sazaby Inc., which operates Starbucks in
Japan through a joint venture with Seattle-based Starbucks Corp.,
has fallen 45 percent as investors reconsidered the track record of
small, consumer-related stocks.
<p>
   Starbucks Japan's disappointing performance is symptomatic of
the malaise that's gripping Japan's over-the-counter stock market.
<p>
   While the U.S.'s Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks has
risen 32.5 percent this year, Japan's OTC index, the Jasdaq, has
fallen 27.6 percent to a record low. By comparison, Japan's
benchmark Nikkei 225 index is down 7.5 percent.
<p>
   ``The OTC market is terrible, and there is no particular reason
for it to get better,'' said Edwin Merner, president of the
Atlantis Investment Research Corp. ``There have been some very big
disappointments.'' Analysts and traders said the collapse of the
804-issue Jasdaq index stems from three major problems: the
companies' dependence on a tepid economy, a flood of new issues and
illiquidity.
<p>
   The capitalization-weighted Jasdaq and its sister, the
average-weighted Nikkei OTC index, are almost devoid of exporter
and high-tech stocks, issues driving Japan's economy.
<p>
   Almost 60 percent of OTC stocks are wholesale, retail, service
and financial companies -- mostly linked to an economy at its
weakest in almost a quarter century.
<p>
   ``The OTC market is heavily geared toward domestic consumption;
a lot of small retailers out there depend on spending by the
average salaried Japanese person, and that's not happening,'' said
Mahendra Negi, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
<p>
   In the April-June quarter, Japan's GDP contracted 2.9 percent,
or an annualized 11.2 percent, its worst performance since 1974.
<p>
   That contraction can only spell trouble for the OTC index, whose
performance is more closely correlated to the GDP than to the
overall stock market, said Christophe Aurand, senior portfolio
manager of Taiyo Life Gamma Asset Management, Ltd. which handles
$4.2 billion in securities.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bond futures rose as
investors looked ahead to a quarterly report next week which will
likely confirm the weak state of the economy.
<p>
   The Bank of Japan will release its ``tankan'' survey of business
sentiment Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast
that the headline index for major manufacturers would decline.
<p>
   While futures rose, benchmark cash bonds were pushed down by
investors such as commercial banks selling bonds to book profits
for the second half of the fiscal year, traders said.
<p>
   ``The market is sticking to a pessimistic view of the economy,
'' said Akitsugu Bando, a portfolio manager at Okasan Capital
Management Co. There is no reason to sell until the release of the
quarterly tankan survey of business confidence, he said.
<p>
   Bond futures for December delivery rose 0.15 from yesterday's
Tokyo close to 128.48. Earlier it touched 128.54, a record high for
the most active futures contract.
<p>
   The benchmark No. 182 bond, maturing in September 2005, fell 57
yen per 50,000 yen in face value. The yield rose 1.5 basis points
to 1.905 percent. Yesterday it fell as low as 1.880 percent, a
record low.
<p>
   Falling stocks also contributed to today's rise in futures, said
Takeshi Naito, assistant general manager in the bond department at
Daiwa Securities Co.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 Benchmark Stock Index fell 347.25, or 1.89
percent, to 17,994.71.
<p>
   Another reason behind the rise of the futures contract in the
afternoon could be a shortage of the cheapest to deliver bond for
settling the contract. As demand drives the price of the bond
higher it also drives up the price of the futures contract for
which it can be delivered.
<p>
   The cheapest bond, the No. 176 is being bought by traders hoping
to profit from a rise in its value, said Akio Makabe, assistant
general manager at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
<p>
   Adding to optimism for bonds was strong demand at a bond auction
yesterday.
<p>
   Yesterday the Ministry of Finance sold 1 trillion yen ($8.3
billion) in 10-year bonds with a record low 2.2 percent coupon for
an average price over par. Although the bid-to-cover ratio on the
issue, a measure of demand, was lower than on last month's auction,
analysts said that isn't an indication of waning demand.
<p>
   ``Investors are clearly not waiting for next week's tankan to
get involved and many are running scared of missing the boat,''
said Stuart Trow, an analyst at Norinchukin International Plc. Many
investors have decided that they cannot afford to delay buying
bonds any longer in the hope of a price dip, he said.
<p>
   Underwriters don't expect any new corporate bond issues next
week, as Sept. 30 is the end of the fiscal half-year and financial
managers will be busy closing their books.
<p>
   The No. 197 bond, which is comparable to benchmark 10-year bonds
in other countries, fell 86 yen per 50,000 in face value. Its yield
rose 2 basis points to 2.140 percent.
<p>
   Japanese bond yields don't reflect compound interest, which is
included in calculating the yields on other countries' bonds.
<p>
   At today's compound yield of 2.176 percent, the No. 197 bond
yields 394 basis points less than the 6.12 percent yield on the
benchmark U.S. 10-year note. That's 7 basis points more than a week
ago.
<p>
   The Japanese bond also yields 328 basis points less than the
5.46 percent yield on 10-year German bonds, assuming the latter
paid interest twice a year. That's 4 basis points more than a week
ago.
<p>
   The spread between the notional yield on the most active 10-year
Japanese government bond futures contract and the seven-year swap
rate narrowed one basis point from yesterday to 45 basis points.
<p>
   Corporations use interest rate and currency swaps, involving
payment in different currencies, to guard against changes in the
value of outstanding debt and to cut borrowing costs.
<p>
   The banks and securities firms that provide these swaps can buy
or sell government bonds to minimize the risk of sudden swings in
interest rates.

Bloomberg News at this hour.

   Singapore, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Singapore stocks rose, led by
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., amid expectations the
government-controlled telephone company may raise dividends and
buy-back its shares.
<p>
   Investors are ``reacting to the mere mention of the possibility
of a buy back'' plan for SingTel shares, said Chong Yoon Chou, a
fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd. which manages
$1 billion.
<p>
   Shares of SingTel, as the former phone monopoly is known, rose
14 cents to S$2.67, its highest in seven weeks. The rise in
SingTel, which accounts for 29 percent of the DBS50 Index, pushed
the index 8.22 points, or 1.70 percent higher to 492.01. The
Straits Times Industrials Index rose 1.76 points, or 0.09 percent,
to 1922.85.
<p>
   The Straits Times newspaper reported yesterday that SingTel is
considering raising its dividend or buying back shares on the
market, to use some of the S$4 billion ($2.6 billion) it holds in
cash.
<p>
   Companies in Singapore are prohibited by law from buying back
their shares, meaning SingTel would need the law to be changed if
it wants to go ahead with the plan. The Singapore government is a
majority shareholder in SingTel. If Singapore Telecommunications
``starts buying back shares, it could improve the stock
performance,'' said Gabriel Yap, an institutional broker at Tsang &AMP;
Ong.
<p>
   Electronics stocks rose, led by Creative Technology Ltd., a
maker of sound cards, which rose 90 cents to S$38.50 and Elec &AMP;
Eltek International Co., a maker of printed circuit boards, which
rose 60 U.S. cents to $8.60 after a surge in U.S. electronics
orders. The Bloomberg Singapore Electronics Index surged 4.08
points, or 2.45 percent, to 170.39.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- China hasn't committed to
opening its markets sufficiently for the U.S. to back its entry to
the World Trade Organization, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said today.
<p>
   ``On WTO, our position remains unchanged,'' Rubin said at press
conference after he met with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.
``We are a very, very strong advocate of China becoming a member of
the WTO, but we believe it must be on commercially viable terms,
which means real opening of China's markets. In our judgment,
that's what the WTO is all about.''
<p>
   Liu said China still wants to become a member of the world trade
body, which mediates disputes between nation. Still, ``If the
requirement is too demanding, we will not join the WTO,'' he said.
<p>
   China has been trying to enter the world trade body for more
than a decade. Doing so would allow it to pay reduced tariffs for a
range of products of which it is a major exporter, including
textiles and machinery. It also would have access to the WTO's
trade dispute settlement mechanism.
<p>
   The U.S., the lead negotiator on China's entry, said those
benefits can only be extended if China provides its trading
partners with greater market access for their products and
services. The issue is pressing for the U.S. since China's trade
surplus with the U.S. is surging. The U.S. trade gap with China
rose to $4.707 billion in July, the highest level since October
1996, and it was 32.5 percent higher in the first seven months of
the year than in the same period of 1996.
<p>
   Asked about when China may be ready to join the WTO, Rubin said,
``I can't predict that. We welcome the tariff reduction (announced
by China yesterday on products like automobiles and appliances). It
is moving in the direction of opening markets in China. In terms of
WTO membership there are obviously a lot of other issues that
remain and non-tariff barriers.''
<p>
   Negotiators from the U.S. Trade Representative office in Beijing
this week were disappointed by the offers made by the Chinese side,
according to officials familiar with the talks. These include a
Chinese proposal to cut tariffs by a percentage point or less for
only about 290 items of the 6,000 products covered, while tariffs
for some 163 items would rise.
<p>
   The lack of progress in the talks suggests Chinese President
Jiang Zemin hasn't been successful in getting warring factions
among Chinese bureaucrats, intent on protecting their fiefdoms, to
agree to sweetened WTO terms. Analysts said it will be up to
Clinton to press Jiang at their summit to force such discipline on
his government's agencies.
<p>
   ``The Chinese have always seen membership in the World Trade
Organization as a political exercise. They don't recognize there is
a substantive dimension,'' said Greg Mastel, senior policy analyst
at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank.
<p>
   ``Jiang has been swayed by concerns driven by Chinese
bureaucrats who would lose their jobs'' if China's import regime
were rationalized and state-owned companies turned into private
enterprises. ``That represents a significant section of China's
leadership, and is slowing down the process,'' Mastel said.
<p>
   Rubin's message to China on WTO comes at a sensitive time for
Boeing Co., which is waiting on word from China about an order for
up to $2 billion in jetliners.
<p>
   Rubin yesterday suggested to China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
that China announce its expected Boeing order during U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley's visit to China from October 6-10 -- and
not when Jiang visits Washington next month, U.S. officials said.
<p>
   Announcements of such big-ticket contracts are often a staple of
state visits. In this case, though, while the Clinton
administration has been pressing hard for the Boeing order, Rubin
told the Chinese the administration is sensitive about President
Bill Clinton being linked to business deals involving China, a U.S.
official said.
<p>
   The U.S. Democratic Party has been criticized for receiving
foreign campaign funding during the 1996 election, and Republicans
in Congress charged that Chinese donations may have illegally been
routed to the Clinton re-election campaign. Chinese officials have
denied those charges.
<p>
   The separation of the summit and a big aircraft deal is also in
the interest of Seattle, Washington-based Boeing, the world's
biggest aircraft producer. The company has seen its sales in China
regularly snagged in recent years by the often-turbulent U.S.-China
relations.
<p>
   Boeing Chairman and CEO Philip M. Condit urged yesterday in a
speech in Washington that the U.S. continue to engage China to
insure that promises to open markets and sell off state-owned
companies are realized. ``As China moves in that direction, it is
embracing economic reforms,'' Condit said. ``We have a chance to
begin to lock in those reforms, to insure that China moves down the
road to a market economy and open trade.''
<p>
   Condit said it's unrealistic for the U.S. to expect China to
address all of its concerns before backing its entry into the WTO.
``It would be foolish to say you've got to get everything done
before we start, because that's a formula for not getting anything
done,'' he said.
<p>
   On a separate issue, Rubin said there has only been ``sporadic
implementation'' of a 1994 agreement to restrict exports of goods
made by Chinese prison labor. He said it is an issue both sides
will revisit. ``It's certainly a difficult problem,'' he said.
<p>
   Rubin and Liu did not announce at the press conference that an
agreement had been reached on the regulation of foreign financial
news and information companies in China. U.S. officials had
indicated yesterday that an agreement would be announced.
<p>
   Copies of the agreement, which seeks to hold China to
commitments made in May not to charge users of financial news an
administration fee of as much as 7 percent, were exchanged and are
now being studied to ensure the Chinese and English versions match,
a U.S. Embassy official said yesterday.
<p>
   The agreement makes no major changes to what Chinese authorities
had promised in May, but seeks to lock Beijing into those
commitments, the official said.
<p>
   In January last year, Beijing said it would tighten controls on
foreign financial news agencies selling services in China. The
rules are yet to be enforced.
<p>
   These companies include Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg
News, Reuters Holdings Plc and Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
<p>
   China said in May that it would not levy the 7 percent fee, but
intends to enforce other regulations, such the requirement of
foreign news organize to submit their list of clients and prices to
Xinhua.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks may trade mixed
next week as gains by autos and electronics makers on the back of a
stronger dollar offset declines in retail stocks sparked by
sluggish domestic consumption.
<p>
   Autos and electronics stocks, the so-called 'nifty stocks,' led
the Nikkei average up early in the week after the dollar rose as
much as 1.5 yen Monday. The dollar then tumbled Wednesday, leading
the nifties into retreat, analysts said.
<p>
   The dollar recently traded for 120.85 yen. Traders predict it
will strengthen next week, boosting exporters like Toyota Motor
Corp. and Sony Corp.
<p>
   ``Export stocks should rebound, especially if the dollar
strengthens to 121 yen,'' said Daniel Marull, a trader at Hoenig &AMP;
Co. ``The blue chips dropped quite a bit today, so I think we'll
rebound from that. They'll look cheap and there's little else to
buy.''
<p>
   A weak yen helps keep down the price of Japanese exports
overseas and raises the value of dollar-denominated revenue when
it's repatriated.
<p>
   The beginning of the second half of the fiscal year on Oct. 1
may also help boost blue chips as buying from Japanese
institutional buyers is expected to pick up once first-half books
are closed, said Celia Farnon, a director in equity sales at Nomura
International Plc. Japanese, particularly pension funds, are
traditionally heavy buyers of the blue chips, she said.
<p>
   Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 63.5 points,
0.36 percent, for the week to 17,994.71. On Thursday and Friday,
the index gave up 2 percent of gains made earlier in the week.
<p>
   Retail stocks will likely fall next week on increased investor
concerns about Japan's sluggish domestic economy. Retailers as a
group slipped 3 percent today after the government said Tokyo
consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in September from August because
of higher medical costs.
<p>
   ``Everyone is concerned about retailers these days,'' said
Hoenig's Marull. ``The government's announcement is just one more
piece of bad news.
<p>
   Japan's retail stores have suffered since the national sales tax
was boosted to 5 percent from 2 percent on April 1. Sales of
big-ticket consumer goods such as electronics and furniture have
been sliding since then.
<p>
   Department store and supermarket sales fell for a fifth straight
month in August.
<p>
   ``There are lots of worries about consumption in Japan,'' said
Nomura's Farnon. ``We've had a steady series of bad numbers and the
problems seems to be right across the board, from supermarkets to
department stores. You've got to be a little worried when consumers
aren't even buying food. It's pretty dire.''
<p>
   Small and midsize construction companies may also fall next week
after plunging today amid concern about their fiscal health.
<p>
   Midsize Japanese construction companies are fighting for
survival amid a squeeze in public spending on construction
projects. Many are saddled with land bought during the 1980's
asset-inflated bubble. Land prices have plunged about 25 percent in
Japan since their 1990 peak. Since July, three construction
companies have gone bankrupt.
<p>
   ``The construction industry is beleaguered from all sides,''
said Toshihiko Okino, construction analyst at Schroders Securities
Japan.
<p>
   Major banks shares may rise on expectations they will benefit
from proposed reforms of the Japanese financial market.
<p>
   ``There is an increasing number of believers in the 'Big Bang'
deregulation story for the financial sector,'' said Farnon. ``I
wouldn't be surprised if we see foreigners next week come in and
buy some of the banks -- not all banks, but the perceived better
banks like Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.''

<p>
   Jakarta, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- A Garuda Airbus A-300 bound for
Medan, North Sumatra, from Jakarta with 221 passengers has crashed,
an official at the national search and rescue office said.
<p>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the Garuda flight at
about 1:00 p.m. Jakarta time, or 30 minutes before it was due to
land at Medan, the official said. There's no confirmation on the
number of casualties or the cause of the crash.
<p>
   The search and rescue official said the plane burst into flames
when it hit the ground and it's not likely there will be many
survivors. If that is correct, the crash could be one of the worst
in Garuda's history. The plane went down near the village of Duah
Nabar, about 45 kilometers from Medan.
<p>
   No one at Garuda, the government-owned airline, was immediately
available for comment. Search and rescue and medical workers have
already been dispatched to the scene, the search and rescue
official said.
<p>
   Many flights to Sumatra have been canceled in recent weeks
because extensive forest fires on the island have reduced
visibility. It isn't known yet if this was a factor in today's
crash.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The European Union asked the
World Trade Organization to look into South Korea's tax on imported
alcoholic beverages on the eve of an international conference aimed
at expanding Asia-Europe trade.
<p>
   German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Japanese Trade
Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi, European Union Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan will join their counterparts from other Asian and
European countries in Tokyo this weekend to discuss ways to boost
trade between the two regions.
<p>
   The dispute over South Korean liquor taxes will likely be high
on the agenda.
<p>
   Korea's liquor tax is a ``long-standing trade irritant'' in an
industry where the EU has ``a major economic interest,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's ambassador in Geneva, said in a statement
yesterday to the global trade watchdog's Dispute Settlement Body,
which rules on trade spats.
<p>
   Companies such as Guinness, Plc, Grand Metropolitan Plc and
Allied Domecq Plc stand to gain if South Korean's 100 percent tax
on imported whiskey is cut. The tax on Soju, a Korean spirit, is
32.5 percent, favoring Korean companies such as Jinro Ltd.
<p>
   Trade representatives from 25 countries will meet at the Asia
Europe Meeting (ASEM), the first multinational gathering of trade
ministers exclusively from Asia and Europe.
<p>
   Their main challenge is generating more trade between Asia and
Europe. Often Asian companies put more effort into trade with the
U.S. than with Europe, and the same is true for European companies.
<p>
   Direct investment by the EU in Japan stood at 1.5 billion Ecu
($1.67 billion) in 1996, or 1.6 percent of all foreign investment.
By comparison, the EU directed 14.4 percent of all investments to
the U.S. and 52 percent to other countries within the EU. Going the
other direction, Japan had a net drop in direct investment flowing
to the EU in 1996 of 181 million Ecu of its investments from the EU
in 1996.
<p>
   ``ASEM will serve as a catalyst, a place where we can share
ideas,'' said Jorn Keck, head of the Delegation of the European
Commission in Japan, at a meeting with the press last week.
<p>
   Cutting Barriers
<p>
   Most of the ideas will revolve around ways to reduce barriers
and increase access to markets.
<p>
   The EU wants Japanese port facilities to be open to more
competition, so the price of shipping goods will decline. The U.S.
has decided to fine three Japanese shipping companies until the
ports become more competitive.
<p>
   The EU is trying to decide whether to impose duties on some
imports of fax machines from Asia. That's because Philips
Electronics NV, a Dutch company, claims its fax machine sales have
been hurt by unfair competition from Asian products which are sold
in Europe at prices below those in their domestic market.
<p>
   In addition, the EU wants Japan to streamline plant quarantine
and certification procedures for automobiles and construction.
<p>
   The EU may take up the issue of financial services trade,
following on discussions earlier this week among finance ministers
at a meeting in Hong Kong. The EU position is the reluctance of
Asian countries to let in foreign-controlled banks and insurers is
the main obstacle to reaching a new agreement on global trade in
financial services by a Dec. 12 deadline set by the WTO.
<p>
   Indonesia faces some questions regarding its ``national car''
policy. The U.S., Japan and the EU have lodged complaints at the
WTO against Indonesia's national car policy, which they say
breaches market-opening commitments. Under the policy, PT Timor
Putra Nasional, a start-up company controlled by Suharto's youngest
son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, was given exclusive tax and import duty
exemptions to eventually build up a car high in local content.
<p>
   The Asia Europe Meeting held its first summit in Bangkok in
March 1996, and since then held a meeting of foreign ministers in
Singapore in February and of finance ministers in Bangkok last
week. The second summit will be held in London in April.
<p>
   The European Union countries attending include Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the U.K.
<p>
   Ten Asian nations will attend, including Japan, China, South
Korea, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam. Leon Brittan, the vice president of European
Commission will represent the EU.

   Singapore, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Singapore stocks rose, led by
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., amid expectations the
government-controlled telephone company may raise dividends and
buy-back its shares.
<p>
   Electronics stocks such as Creative Technology Ltd. also gained
after a surge in U.S. electronics orders.
<p>
   Shares of SingTel, as the former phone monopoly is known, rose
14 cents to S$2.67, its highest in seven weeks. The rise in
SingTel, which accounts for 29 percent of the DBS50 Index, pushed
the index 8.22 points higher, or 1.70 percent, to 492.01. The
Straits Times Industrials Index rose 1.76 points, or 0.09 percent,
to 1,922.85. Investors are ``reacting to the mere mention of the
possibility of a buy back'' plan for SingTel shares, said Chong
Yoon Chou, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd.
which manages $1 billion.
<p>
   The Straits Times newspaper reported yesterday that SingTel is
considering raising its dividend or buying back shares on the
market, to use some of the S$4 billion ($2.6 billion) it holds in
cash.
<p>
   Companies in Singapore are prohibited by law from buying back
their shares, meaning SingTel would need the law to be changed if
it wants to go ahead with the plan. The Singapore government is a
majority shareholder in SingTel.
<p>
   If Singapore Telecommunications ``starts buying back shares, it
could improve the stock performance,'' said Gabriel Yap, an
institutional broker at Tsang &AMP; Ong.
<p>
   Singapore stocks are likely to be mixed in the week ahead, as
expectations of a rise in electronics demand boosting economic
growth could be offset by concern about declining regional
currencies.
<p>
   ``The electronics recovery looks like it's coming through,''
said Chong of Aberdeen. Still, investors are concerned that a
possible slowdown in Malaysia's economic growth could hurt
Singapore companies.
<p>
   Malaysia is one of Singapore's largest trading partners and many
companies, such as banks, have operations in the neighboring
country.
<p>
   For the week, the Straits Times index rose 1.5 percent while the
DBS50 index gained 5.7 percent.
<p>
   Electronics stocks rose, led by Creative Technology Ltd., a
maker of computer sound cards, which rose 90 cents to S$38.50.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Singapore Electronics Index surged 4.08 points, or
2.45 percent, to 170.39 after the U.S. Commerce Department said
yesterday orders for electronic components rose a record 28.4
percent in August from a month ago, the first increase since May.
<p>
   The electronics industry ``should be recovering,'' said Lawrence
Lye, head of research at NatWest Securities Singapore Pte.
<p>
   Sunright Ltd., a maker of semiconductor testing equipment,
gained 27 cents to S$2.52; while Acer Computer International Ltd.,
a maker of personal computers, rose 10 U.S. cents to $1.85.
<p>
   Elec &AMP; Eltek International Co., a maker of printed circuit
boards, rose 60 U.S. cents to $8.60 after the company said profit
for the year ended June 30 rose a higher than expected 21 percent
to S$59.4 million, boosted by a rebound in global electronics
demand in its fiscal second half.
<p>
   Elec &AMP; Eltek ``has high operating margins, respectable earnings
per share, and stable and visible earnings,'' said Eddy Tan, an
analyst at Vickers Ballas Investment Research.
<p>
   Gainers outnumbered losers by 201 to 161. Trading amounted to
134.68 million shares worth S$324.52 million.

<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- China hasn't committed to
opening its markets sufficiently for the U.S. to back its entry to
the World Trade Organization, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said today.
<p>
   ``On WTO, our position remains unchanged,'' Rubin said at press
conference after he met with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli.
``We are a very, very strong advocate of China becoming a member of
the WTO, but we believe it must be on commercially viable terms,
which means real opening of China's markets. In our judgment,
that's what the WTO is all about.''
<p>
   Liu said China still wants to become a member of the world trade
body, which mediates disputes between nations. Still, ``If the
requirement is too demanding, we will not join the WTO,'' he said.
<p>
   China has been trying to enter the world trade body for more
than a decade. Doing so would allow importers of its products, such
as textiles and machinery, to pay reduced tariffs. It also would
have access to the WTO's trade dispute settlement mechanism.
<p>
   The U.S., the lead negotiator on China's entry, said those
benefits can only be extended if China provides its trading
partners with greater market access for their products and
services. The issue is pressing for the U.S. since China's trade
surplus with the U.S. is surging. The U.S. trade gap with China
rose to $4.707 billion in July, the highest level since October
1996, and it was 32.5 percent higher in the first seven months of
the year than in the same period of 1996.
<p>
   For the whole year, the U.S. trade deficit with China could
surge as high as $50 billion, analysts predict. ``That large
deficit creates problems, both economically, and politically, in
the United States,'' Rubin said.
<p>
   Asked about when China may be ready to join the WTO, Rubin said,
``I can't predict that. We welcome the tariff reduction (announced
by China yesterday on products like automobiles and appliances). It
is moving in the direction of opening markets in China. In terms of
WTO membership there are obviously a lot of other issues that
remain and non-tariff barriers.''
<p>
   Negotiators from the U.S. Trade Representative office in Beijing
this week were disappointed by the offers made by the Chinese side,
according to officials familiar with the talks. These include a
Chinese proposal to cut tariffs by a percentage point or less for
only about 290 items of the 6,000 products covered, while tariffs
for some 163 items would rise.
<p>
   The lack of progress in the talks suggests Chinese President
Jiang Zemin hasn't been successful in getting warring factions
among Chinese bureaucrats, intent on protecting their fiefdoms, to
agree to sweetened WTO terms. Analysts said it will be up to
Clinton to press Jiang at their summit to force such discipline on
his government's agencies.
<p>
   ``The Chinese have always seen membership in the World Trade
Organization as a political exercise. They don't recognize there is
a substantive dimension,'' said Greg Mastel, senior policy analyst
at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank.
<p>
   ``Jiang has been swayed by concerns driven by Chinese
bureaucrats who would lose their jobs'' if China's import regime
were rationalized and state-owned companies turned into private
enterprises. ``That represents a significant section of China's
leadership, and is slowing down the process,'' Mastel said.
<p>
   Rubin's message to China on WTO comes at a sensitive time for
Boeing Co., which is waiting on word from China about an order for
up to $2 billion in jetliners.
<p>
   Rubin yesterday suggested to China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
that China announce its expected Boeing order during U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley's visit to China from October 6-10 -- and
not when Jiang visits Washington next month, U.S. officials said.
<p>
   Announcements of such big-ticket contracts are often a staple of
state visits. In this case, though, while the Clinton
administration has been pressing hard for the Boeing order, Rubin
told the Chinese the administration is sensitive about President
Bill Clinton being linked to business deals involving China, a U.S.
official said.
<p>
   The U.S. Democratic Party has been criticized for receiving
foreign campaign funding during the 1996 election, and Republicans
in Congress charged that Chinese donations may have illegally been
routed to the Clinton re-election campaign. Chinese officials have
denied those charges.
<p>
   The separation of the summit and a big aircraft deal is also in
the interest of Seattle, Washington-based Boeing, the world's
biggest aircraft producer. The company has seen its sales in China
regularly snagged in recent years by the often-turbulent U.S.-China
relations.
<p>
   Boeing Chairman and CEO Philip M. Condit urged yesterday in a
speech in Washington that the U.S. continue to engage China to
insure that promises to open markets and sell off state-owned
companies are realized. ``As China moves in that direction, it is
embracing economic reforms,'' Condit said. ``We have a chance to
begin to lock in those reforms, to insure that China moves down the
road to a market economy and open trade.''
<p>
   Condit said it's unrealistic for the U.S. to expect China to
address all of its concerns before backing its entry into the WTO.
``It would be foolish to say you've got to get everything done
before we start, because that's a formula for not getting anything
done,'' he said.
<p>
   On a separate issue, Rubin said there has only been ``sporadic
implementation'' of a 1994 agreement to restrict exports of goods
made by Chinese prison labor. He said it is an issue both sides
will revisit. ``It's certainly a difficult problem,'' he said.
<p>
   Rubin and Liu did not announce at the press conference that an
agreement had been reached on the regulation of foreign financial
news and information companies in China. U.S. officials had
indicated yesterday that an agreement would be announced.
<p>
   Copies of the agreement, which seeks to hold China to
commitments made in May not to charge users of financial news an
administration fee of as much as 7 percent, were exchanged and are
now being studied to ensure the Chinese and English versions match,
a U.S. Embassy official said yesterday.
<p>
   The agreement makes no major changes to what Chinese authorities
had promised in May, but seeks to lock Beijing into those
commitments, the official said.
<p>
   In January last year, Beijing said it would tighten controls on
foreign financial news agencies selling services in China. The
rules are yet to be enforced.
<p>
   These companies include Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg
News, Reuters Holdings Plc and Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
<p>
   China said in May that it would not levy the 7 percent fee, but
intends to enforce other regulations, such the requirement of
foreign news organize to submit their list of clients and prices to
Xinhua.

<p>
   Kuala Lumpur, Sept 26 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysian stocks rose, led
by Telekom Malaysia Bhd. and Tenaga Nasional Bhd., as investors bid
up stocks that have fallen to attractive levels relative to
expected earnings.
<p>
   ``There are trading opportunities'' on some of the large stocks,
said Phuah Lee Kerk, head of research at Jupiter Securities. ``Some
are trading at a PE of 10 times, which is ridiculously cheap.''
<p>
   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index gained 10.48 points,
or 1.33 percent, to 799.81. The broader KL Emas Index rose 2.26
points, or 1.01 percent, to 226.82.
<p>
   Telekom shares gained 30 sen to 9.55 ringgit ($3.06), while
Tenaga, the electric utility, rose 25 sen to 8.25 ringgit. Sime
Darby Bhd., which has interests in real estate and banking, gained
30 sen to 6.40 ringgit. United Engineers Malaysia Bhd., a
construction company, rose 40 sen to 10.10 ringgit.
<p>
   For the week, the Composite Index gained 1.5 percent while the
KL Emas Index rose 0.36 percent.
<p>
   Tenaga shares rose after the power utility took steps to reduce
its future foreign exchange risk by raising funds through bond
sales in the local market.
<p>
   Tenaga said yesterday it has almost completed a sale of 1
billion ringgit in domestic bonds.
<p>
   ``Tenaga was trying to reduce its foreign exchange exposure,
which is maybe good for it in the longer term,'' said Roslan Harun,
who helps to manage 950 million ringgit at Aseambankers Malaysia
Bhd.
<p>
   In the market, 172.47 million shares worth 851 million ringgit
changed hands. That is the lowest value since Dec. 27. Rising
stocks outpaced falling issues 346 to 264 while 181 were unchanged.
<p>
   Stocks are expected to trade mixed amid currency concerns and
worries that borrowing will cost more after Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
cut Malaysia's long-term credit ratings outlook for a second time
in six weeks.
<p>
   Some financial stocks such as Hong Leong Bank Bhd. and property
issues such as IOI Corp. may extend their declines.
<p>
   ``Investors will look to the currency, and see how the ringgit
is doing,'' said Roslan of Aseambankers. ``Any rise will be capped
as the date for the 1998 budget nears,'' he said.
<p>
   Malaysia announces its budget on Oct. 17.
<p>
   Yesterday, S&AMP;P cut Malaysia's long-term ratings outlook to
``negative'' from ``stable'', and warned there's a growing
possibility of a downgrade in the country's long-term and
short-term ratings. That comes on the heels of the cut in outlook
to ``stable'' from ``positive'' on Aug. 18. The market is still
affected by the currency's lack of stability, ``and the S&AMP;P cut
doesn't help,'' said Chong Sui San, who helps manage 420 million
ringgit at Pacific Mutual Fund Sdn.
<p>
   Some financial stocks, such as Hong Leong Bank Bhd., fell as
higher borrowing costs will discourage the use of loans. Hong Leong
Bank shares lost 10 sen to 4.88 ringgit, while Commerce Asset
Holdings Bhd. declined 2 sen to 2.70 ringgit.
<p>
   Property stocks fell. Hong Leong Properties Bhd. shares dropped
8 sen to 2.28 ringgit while Innovest Bhd. lost 15 sen to 7.80
ringgit. The KL Property Index dropped 5.21 points, or 0.3 percent,
to 1633.30.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- While most others are wondering
when Japan's central bank will raise interest rates from historical
lows, Richard Medley thinks a rate cut is possible.
<p>
   Medley, head of Medley Investment Group, a New York-based
hedge-fund adviser, says the Bank of Japan could reduce rates by
the end of the year if reports out in the next few weeks show the
economy weakening.
<p>
   He also said the reports -- a key central bank survey and retail
sales figures -- aren't likely to support the government's view
that the economy is recovering and may force the government to act
to stimulate domestic demand.
<p>
   ``If the Japanese economy looks like it's rolling over into
recession, pressure will mount for a change in Japanese fiscal
policy,'' Medley, a former partner at Soros Fund Management, told
reporters in Tokyo.
<p>
   The central bank's key quarterly ``tankan'' survey of business
sentiment scheduled for release Oct. 1, and September retail sales
figures to be released in the middle of the month, will be
``critical turning points'' to gauge the strength of the economy,
he said.
<p>
   If the reports are negative, the central bank could cut its
official discount rate by another 25 basis points, Medley said.
<p>
   The bank reduced the discount rate to a record-low 0.5 percent
in September 1995 to boost the economy and help banks write off
trillions of yen in bad loans.
<p>
   The government is holding to its forecast that gross domestic
product will grow 1.9 percent in the year through next April.
<p>
   Yet the economy shrank 2.9 percent in the April-June quarter
from the previous three-month period, or 11.2 percent at an annual
rate, as consumer spending slowed after an April increase in the
national sales tax.
<p>
   The government raised taxes and trimmed spending to lower its
budget deficit, one of the highest in the industrial world at 5.4
percent of GDP.
<p>
   Sweeping bad loans off banks' books is one of the most important
measures the Japanese government must take to help the economy,
Medley said. The Ministry of Finance said banks had almost 28
trillion yen ($231 billion) in bad loans as of March 31.
<p>
   Medley suggested the government commit taxpayer money and
establish a body akin to the Resolution Trust Corp., which the U.S.
set up to get rid of its own bad-loan problem.
<p>
   ``There's no reason in the world (the RTC idea) shouldn't work
here,'' he said.
<p>
   Medley said the U.S. allocated $500 billion to solve its savings
and loan crisis. In contrast, Japan to this point has used only 685
billion yen ($5.7 billion) in taxpayers' money.
<p>
   Medley also said the government should consider cutting personal
income taxes to spur growth, and carry out economic reform quickly
to alleviate the uncertainty on the part of consumers created by
such changes.
<p>
   Medley said the dollar may rise to 125 yen if the upcoming
Japanese reports show the economy slowing further.
<p>
   ``The 125-yen level still represents the outer limits of the
policy barriers,'' Medley earlier told the Bloomberg Forum. The
dollar could appreciate to 130 yen by the end of the year if
Japan's economy weakens markedly, he said.
<p>
   Japanese officials are determined to keep the dollar from rising
above the 122-123 yen level, Medley said.
<p>
   Still, ``the risk of real intervention doesn't even begin to
enter the picture until you get nearer to 125 yen, and authorities
would have to reassess at that point,'' he said.
<p>
   The tankan will likely confirm the polarized recovery in the
economy, with large export-oriented manufacturers faring well and
smaller companies floundering, economists said.
<p>
   ``Japan's headed for an export-led recession,'' said Medley.
``Exports aren't a big enough part of the Japanese economy to drive
it into recovery.''
<p>
   Exports only account for 10 percent of gross domestic product in
Japan, compared to 30 percent in Germany, he said.
<p>
   In the U.S., Medley said Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Alan
Greenspan is unlikely to push for higher rates within the year.
<p>
   ``If they don't go in November, and we don't expect them to,
they're very unlikely to go in December,'' he said. ``They're not
in the business of being the Grinch that stole the retailers' best
week of the year.''
<p>
   Medley said he's ``very bullish'' on Treasuries, and sees the
yield on the 30-year bond falling below 6.0 percent, from its
present 6.39 percent.
<p>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers meet on Sept. 30, and then in
November and December to chart interest rate policy.
<p>
   In Germany, Medley said the Bundesbank will probably raise
interest rates within the next six weeks as the nation prepares for
the European Monetary Union, set to begin on Jan. 1, 1999.
<p>
   While that could boost the mark against the dollar in the
short-term, ``if the dollar started to drop dramatically it would
cause a huge political problem for (German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl),'' he said. Germany does ``have an export-led recovery going
and a 1.60-1.65 dollar-mark would threaten that.''
<p>
   The dollar was recently at 120.56 yen, and at 1.7525 marks.

   London, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Investors who reckon there's
little profit left in betting on which countries will qualify for
Europe's single currency in 1999 are turning to the bonds of
countries expected to join the single currency a few years later.
<p>
   That's likely to push down borrowing costs for the U.K., Sweden
and Denmark -- countries not expected to be among the first wave of
nations joining European economic and monetary union, though seen
applying for membership once EMU is underway.
<p>
   ``There's better value in these markets than in, for example,
Italy and Spain,'' said Stewart Cowley, the head of global
fixed-income for Hill Samuel Asset Management's $13 billion.
<p>
   Buying 10-year Italian or Spanish bonds offers less than a 60
basis-point premium over an investment in German bonds, Europe's
benchmark market.
<p>
   U.K. bonds deliver about 100 basis points, down from 120
yesterday and 150 a month ago, still better than the 50 basis
points offered by Sweden or 60 basis points in Danish bonds, both
of which have better economic records than Spain or Italy.
<p>
   Monetary union looks increasingly like a done deal, with the
political drive to forge a single economic bloc outweighing the
difficulties some countries have faced clearing the economic
hurdles designed to ensure synchronization between the economies of
EMU's members.
<p>
   Deutsche Bank AG's research unit, for example, now reckons
there's an 80 percent chance of a ``broad'' European monetary union
starting in 1999. In April, Germany's biggest bank put the
likelihood at 67 percent, and at just 55 percent earlier this year.
<p>
   Deutsche sees Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Finland, Spain and Portugal in the
first wave of countries adopting the euro.
<p>
   The bond yields of those countries have compressed, shrinking
the gaps investors used to exploit for profit, as governments
battling to qualify for EMU improved their economic discipline and
as the prospect of currency risk on their bonds waned.
<p>
   The gaps have shrunk faster than many analysts and investors
expected. The spread between Italian and German yields, for
example, took six months to get to 200 basis points from 400, less
than four months to halve to 100, and sprinted to 60 from 100 in
less than a month.
<p>
   The speed of the move caught many investors by surprise, as
spreads were not expected to dissolve until next summer.
Strategists recommend getting in early on the next big play, with
gilts likely to be the main beneficiary of new investor interest.
<p>
   ``The bet is that bonds of the countries that should be there in
two years' time get there earlier,'' said Alison Cottrell, the
chief international economist at PaineWebber International.
<p>
   U.K. bonds got a big boost today on reports the government is
considering joining EMU soon after the 1999 start date, which would
mean a referendum on dropping the pound for the euro earlier than
previously expected. A referendum on EMU was one of the Labour
government's election pledges.
<p>
   The Financial Times said the government will probably soon
announce that it may join the single currency at an ``early
opportunity'' after the scheduled 1999 start. The paper cited an
unidentified Cabinet minister, who said the government may release
a statement at the end of October.
<p>
   A Treasury spokesman said the report was ``pure speculation,''
though he declined further comment.
<p>
   Some bond buyers think the U.K. bond market is in a no-lose
situation. The single currency gets started in less than a
year-and-a-half.
<p>
   ``In a way gilts will have the best of both worlds -- if EMU
works well, they will benefit from convergence because people will
expect them to join sooner rather than later once they have seen
the benefits,'' Cowley at Hill Samuel said. ``If EMU isn't a
success, gilts benefit from perceived safe haven status within
Europe.''
<p>
   One effect of early U.K. entry into EMU would be to push the
pound lower. The government isn't likely to strap itself back into
the European exchange rate mechanism at current levels, which are
crippling British exporters by making their goods more expensive in
overseas markets. The pound is currently worth about 2.83 deutsche
marks, up from 2.62 marks at the beginning of the year.
<p>
   Rob Hayward, an economic adviser at Bank of America, said unless
investors get skeptical about the U.K. government's commitment to
EMU, ``the pound will move down gradually to the level at which
people believe it would join the ERM, and that's the 2.60 marks
area.''
<p>
   Of the four Nordic countries, only Finland is scheduled to join
EMU at its launch. Sweden is preparing to join some time after the
launch of the system because of lack of public support for
membership. Denmark decided in a referendum in 1993 not to join
EMU, and has secured itself an opt-out clause allowing it to resist
joining the euro even if it meets the economic qualifications.
<p>
   ``If it's a true story, then it's a question of re-valuing the
market,'' said Thomas Kristiansson, a fund manager at S-E-Banken
Fonder in Stockholm. ``I can't see any reason why Sweden wouldn't
follow Britain.''
<p>
   If Prime Minister Tony Blair does take Britain into the single
currency, analysts figure it would drag Sweden and Denmark into EMU
at an early date.
<p>
   ``The fate of Sweden and Denmark will be made totally by Tony
Blair and nobody else,'' said Carlo Eraekallio, chief strategist at
Svenska Handelsbanken AB in Stockholm. ``He will take Sweden into
EMU, as well as Denmark a bit later on. I believe the U.K. will
change its attitude fairly soon.''
<p>
   Eraekallio said he'd advise investors to be ``very long of
Swedish long bonds'' while they still offer a premium to other core
European bond markets.
<p>
   Steve Major, chief bond strategist at ING Barings, meantime, is
recommending a mix of long-dated Danish bonds, U.K bonds maturing
in more than 10 years, and two-year Swedish bonds. ``On the
surface, it may seem that all of the pre-EMU convergence has been
made, but on closer inspection there are still several trades worth
examining further,'' Major said.

<p>
   Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds are likely to rise
next week, driving the benchmark bond yield to new lows, with
investors expecting the Bank of Japan to report business confidence
is waning.
<p>
   The central bank will release its quarterly ``tankan'' survey of
business sentiment Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast that the index for major manufacturers will decline to 5
from 8 in June's survey.
<p>
   ``The market is sticking to a pessimistic view of the economy,''
said Akitsugu Bando, a portfolio manager at Okasan Capital
Management Co. If the survey shows any deterioration in confidence
that will make investors bullish, he said.
<p>
   In the week just ended, the benchmark No. 182 bond, maturing in
September 2005, rose 161 yen per 50,000 yen in face value. The
yield fell 4.5 basis points to 1.905 percent. Yesterday it touched
a record low of 1.880 percent.
<p>
   Bond futures for December delivery rose 0.91 to 128.48. Today,
the December contract rose as high as 128.54, a record for the
most-active contract.
<p>
   If the results of the tankan survey meet expectations, ``the
central bank's view of the economy could be toned down and that
could support bonds,'' said Kusuo Aoki, chief bond analyst at
Yamaichi Securities Co.
<p>
   Some traders expect next week's market to fluctuate.
<p>
   ``The market should be volatile,'' said Kazutoshi Nakata, a
manager in the financial market division at Nikko Securities Co.
The high prices of bonds could prompt some investors to sell, while
the expected weakness in the quarterly survey could encourage
others to buy, he said.
<p>
   Nakata said the benchmark yield could fall to 1.8 percent, he
said.
<p>
   Still, some life insurance companies and other investors are
reluctant to take quick action after the release of the closely
watched indicator.
<p>
   If the results meet expectations, the market's response may be
muted, said Takashi Kawashima, an asset allocation manager at
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. ``We'll see how the market goes
because the current yields are low to buy bonds.''
<p>
   Given the flattening yield curve, 20-year bonds have become
attractive to investors, said Jun Fukashiro, a fund manager at NCB
Investment Management Co.
<p>
   Traders and investors will also pay attention to a report on
industrial production for August that's scheduled for release
Tuesday.
<p>
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will likely
report that the August figure fell 1.4 percent from July and 4.9
percent from the same month a year before, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.
<p>
   ``Domestic demand is weak; only exports are supporting the
economy,'' said Masahiro Inoue, an assistant manager at Sumitomo
Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
<p>
   The following is a list of predictions for the trading range of
Japanese government bond futures contracts for December delivery.

approved a bill prohibiting the state's pension funds from
investing in tobacco companies, forcing the $21 billion fund to
sell its $200 million in tobacco stocks within the next three
years, the Boston Globe reported. Gov. Paul Cellucci plans to sign

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian government bonds were
little changed as traders tried to determine when the Bank of
Canada will raise lending rates to slow the economy and prevent
consumer prices from rising too quickly.
<p>
   Bonds posted their largest one-day drop in eight weeks yesterday
after a series of U.S. reports revived concern that the U.S.
economy is growing at a quick enough pace to fuel inflation.
<p>
   That bolstered speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise
lending rates soon to slow the U.S. economy, prompting Canada's
central bank to raise its own benchmark rate to keep Canadian
securities competitive.
<p>
   ``If the view develops that the Fed is going to go sooner rather
than later, that certainly alters the Bank of Canada's view on its
own timing,'' said David Rosenberg, a senior economist with Nesbitt
Burns Inc. Developments in the U.S. economy affect Canada directly
because the countries are each other's -- and the world's --
largest trading partners.
<p>
   Canada's benchmark 30-year, 8 percent bond rose C$0.05 (US$0.04)
to C$122.43, leaving the yield unchanged at 6.32 percent. On
Wednesday, the benchmark bond's yield slid 9 basis points to 6.26
percent -- its lowest ever. Yesterday, though, the yield retreated
on renewed concern that the inflation rate is picking up.
<p>
   Investors are awaiting domestic reports on industrial goods and
raw materials prices for confirmation that producers' costs aren't
rising. Higher costs for manufacturers can translate into higher
prices for consumer goods, which erode bonds' fixed principal and
interest payments.
<p>
   Prices for industrial goods probably rose 0.4 percent in August,
while raw-material costs may have increased 0.5 percent last month,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Both reports will be released
at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.
<p>
   ``There is no inflation in Canada,'' said Arve Bendiksrud, a
fixed-income analyst with Toronto-Dominion Securities Inc.
``There's been such a long history of no change in prices that the
market really isn't too concerned about it.''
<p>
   Even without inflation, traders are bracing for a quarter-point
increase in official lending rates because of concern strong growth
will eventually lead to higher prices if it's left unchecked.
<p>
   The central bank raised its benchmark rate in June a quarter
point to 3.5 percent to bolster the Canadian currency. The bank
typically announces changes in official rates between 8:55 a.m. and
9:05 a.m. Eastern time by issuing a brief statement.
<p>
   Among other issues, the 10-year, 7.25 percent bond's yield fell
1 basis point to 5.75 percent. The yield on the five-year, 7
percent issue fell 1 basis point to 5.13 percent.
<p>
   The Canadian dollar recently traded at 72.30 U.S. cents,
unchanged from yesterday's close. It has risen more than half a
cent in the past week on expectations of higher rates.
<p>
   In the U.S., investors are awaiting reports the final revised
report on second-quarter growth and the University of Michigan's
index of consumer sentiment for insights of the economy's strength.
<p>
   U.S. government bonds rose, with the U.S. 30-year bond's yield
at 6.38 percent, 6 basis points above its Canadian counterpart.
Canada's 30-year benchmark bond hasn't yielded more than its U.S.
equivalent since July 29.

   San Jose, California, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Adobe Systems Inc.
said Chief Operating Officer David Pratt resigned and co-founder
Charles Geschke will become co-chairman with expanded
responsibilities, moves the software company said will ``streamline
planning and decision making.''
<p>
   Pratt, a nine-year Adobe veteran who also is an executive vice
president, leaves effective Nov. 30. Adobe said it's eliminating
the chief operating officer position. The company makes software
that allows computer users to create documents with sophisticated
graphics.
<p>
   John Warnock, chairman and chief executive, will now share a new
office of the chairman position with Geschke. The two founded Adobe
in 1982. Warnock will continue as chief executive and head Adobe's
product, strategy and technology operations. Geschke will assume
expanded roles in running Adobe's marketing, selling and operations
and retains his title of president, Adobe said.
<p>
   The management changes come a week after Adobe reported
better-than-expected third-quarter profit on strong sales of its
desktop publishing software for both the Windows and Macintosh
operating systems.
<p>
   For the period ended Aug. 29, profit before a gain rose to $40.5
million, or 55 cents a share, from $29.8 million, or 40 cents, a
year earlier. Analysts expected Adobe to earn 48 cents a share.
<p>
   Adobe also said a week ago it will buy back as many as 15
million shares, or about 20 percent of its shares outstanding, over
the next two years.
<p>
   Adobe shares have risen 37 percent this year, outpacing the 27
percent jump in the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index.

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies with shares that may move in Canadian markets. The stock
symbol is given in parentheses after the company name. Prices are
as of yesterday's close.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. (CSN CT): The Ottawa-based software developer said
growth over the next few quarters may slow because of competition
from the Internet. Like other software makers, Cognos fell victim
to a perceived threat from the Internet as investors worried that
its customers may buy software from rivals that offer ways to get
similar information over the World Wide Web. Joseph Farley, an
analyst with UBS Securities in New York, rates the shares a
``strong buy'' with a 12-month target price of US$39. Cognos
tumbled C$14.65 (US$10.55) to C$30.50.
<p>
   Corel Corp. (COS CT): The company said its fiscal third-quarter
loss widened because of lower sales of its flagship WordPerfect and
CorelDraw and warned it will post a large fourth-quarter loss on
lower revenue. Corel reported a loss of US$31.4 million, or 52
cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with a loss
of US$3.2 million, or 5 cents, in the year earlier period. Corel
fell C$1.35 to C$5.45, a four year low, after the results were
announced.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (GOU CT): The Calgary, Alberta-based
company said it will price the initial public offering of its Gulf
Indonesia Resources Ltd. unit on Monday and then list the shares
the next day on the New York Stock Exchange. The 21-million-share
offer is expected to be priced between US$17 and US$21 a share.
Gulf Canada shares climbed C$0.75 to C$13.10, just off the 52-week
high of C$13.25.
<p>
   Intrawest Corp. (ITW CT): The Vancouver-based ski resort
operator and developer said it will invest C$420 million over the
next five years to expand its resort in Mont Tremblant, Quebec.
Intrawest said it plans to build new ski runs and ski lifts and
construct two championship golf courses. The company's shares fell
C$0.05 to C$24.40.
<p>
   Shell Canada Ltd. (SHC CT): The oil and natural gas producer and
refiner cut the posted price of gasoline at Sarnia and London,
Ontario, by C$0.05 a liter yesterday, following lower cash prices
across the U.S. border at Detroit. Suppliers said cash prices at
the U.S. border have been under pressure this week because of an
abundant supply of summer-grade gasoline. Shell Canada fell C$0.05
to C$23.40.
<p>
   Sherritt International Corp. (S CT): Sherritt plans to spin off
its Dynatec mining and drilling services unit, according to Gene
McBurney, managing partner with Griffiths McBurney &AMP; Partners.
McBurney said the heavy trading volume over the past couple days
was not a bid for control of Sherritt, and the buyers were
institutions. Sherritt fell C$0.15 to C$7.65, and was Canada's most
active issue for the second consecutive day.

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The industrial product price
index rose 0.7 percent in August because of increased petroleum,
paper, primary metal and car prices, Statistics Canada said.
<p>
   August's increase was greater than economists' expectations of a
0.4 percent gain. In August, the index stood at 130.8, showing
industrial product prices gained 0.9 percent from August 1996. The
index stood at 100 in 1986.
<p>
   The biggest monthly increases were a 4.5 percent rise in
industrial prices of petroleum and coal products, a 1.7 percent
climb for primary metal products, a 1.5 percent gain for paper and
paper products and a 0.9 percent climb in auto and truck prices,
the federal statistics office said.
<p>
   Excluding petroleum and coal products, the industrial product
price index rose 0.5 percent in August to 132.4, and climbed 0.8
percent from the year-earlier month.

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's raw materials price
index fell 0.1 percent in August from July because of lower prices
for logs, copper and hogs, Statistics Canada said.
<p>
   The report countered economists' expectations of a 0.5 percent
increase. August's index stood at 133.3, down 2.8 percent from the
year-earlier month. The index stood at 100 in 1986.
<p>
   StatsCan said a 1.1 percent decline in animal and animal product
prices, and a 2.9 percent drop in wood prices accounted for most of
the decrease. Hog prices, alone, fell 4.5 percent from July. Copper
prices fell 6.5 percent. These decreases were partly offset by a
2.2 percent increase in mineral fuel prices.
<p>
   The raw material price index excluding mineral fuels fell 1.1
percent in August to 139.5; the index dropped 1.1 percent from the
year-earlier month.

   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously estimated, though
more up-to-date statistics suggest there's no end in sight to the
current expansion.
<p>
   The gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods
and services, rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, the Commerce Department said in a revision to earlier
reports. That's down from its Aug. 28 estimate of 3.6 percent.
Before today's report, analysts expected a revised growth rate of
3.7 percent. The figures are adjusted for inflation.
<p>
   Real final sales, which exclude the effects of inventory
changes, rose 2.5 percent in the second quarter, previously
reported as a 2.8 percent increase. After-tax corporate profits
rose 1.7 percent during the second quarter, previously reported as
an increase of 1.2 percent.
<p>
   ``This month's revision of real GDP does not change the general
picture of the economy,'' said Steve Landefeld, director of the
department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. ``Growth was slower in
the second quarter than in the first and the slowdown was more than
accounted for by consumer spending.'' In the first quarter, the GDP
rose 4.9 percent.
<p>
   The Commerce Department also attributed the revised second
quarter growth estimate to lower calculations of goods exports and
business investment in durable goods. Still, the increase in
business investment was the largest since late 1983. Today's report
also continued to show a rapid buildup in business inventories,
which could act to brake demand for some manufactured goods in the
months ahead.
<p>
   In the third quarter, which ends Sept. 30, the economy probably
expanded at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annual rate, said William
Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter Securities in New York,
before today's report. Fourth quarter growth will likely reach a 3
percent to 3.5 percent pace, Sullivan said.
<p>
   High-tech industries are leading the way, as highlighted by
yesterday's report showing a stronger-than-expected gain in August
factory orders for durable goods.
<p>
   Analysts said most U.S. computer makers will probably report
higher third quarter earnings, as lower prices and faster chips
trigger increased demand for personal computers and business
systems. This week, Dell Computer Corp.'s chief financial officer,
Thomas Meredith, said sales in the personal computer industry will
rise 18 percent to 20 percent for the next decade.
<p>
   If the economy's growth is accompanied by higher labor costs,
the Federal Reserve could raise the overnight bank lending rate
late this year to insure inflation remains under wraps, said Robert
Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, before the report.
<p>
   ``The outlook is for the economy to still exceed the speed
limit,'' Dederick said. Unemployment is near a quarter-century low,
manufacturing and the housing market remain vibrant, and consumer
spending and business inventories are strong, according to other
recent statistics.
<p>
   At its next meeting Tuesday, though, the Fed's policymaking
panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, is expected to leave
borrowing costs unchanged because various measures of prices
exhibit no conclusive signs of accelerating inflation.
<p>
   The GDP price deflator, a measure of price increases followed by
Wall Street, grew at a 1.8 percent pace in the second quarter, the
smallest rise since a 1.7 percent increase in the second quarter of
last year. It was previously reported as an increase of 1.5
percent. The price deflator measures both the magnitude of price
increases and detects whether higher costs drive consumers away
from a product.
<p>
   The price index for gross domestic purchases, which tracks the
price of all goods purchased in the U.S., including imports, grew
at a 0.8 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged from the
previous reading and the smallest increase since a 0.7 percent rise
in the third quarter of 1961.
<p>
   The GDP chain-weighted price index, which tracks changes in the
price of all goods and services made in the U.S., increased at a
1.8 percent rate in the second quarter, the smallest rise since a
1.4 percent increase in the third quarter of 1992. It was
previously reported as a 1.5 percent increase.
<p>
   The government issues three estimates of each quarter's GDP as
more information becomes available to its economists. In its
initial estimate, on July 31, the Commerce Department said the
economy grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
That was raised to a 3.6 percent pace last month. The first
quarter's 4.9 percent growth rate was higher than the 4.3 percent
rate recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.
<p>
   Adjusted for inflation, the economy grew at a seasonally
adjusted rate of $7.160 trillion in the second quarter compared
with $7.102 trillion in the first quarter.
<p>
   Before adjusting for inflation, the economy expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $8.034 trillion in the second
quarter compared with $7.934 trillion during the first quarter.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Simon DeBartolo Group Inc.
said it acquired a majority stake in closely held shopping mall
owner Retail Property Trust through a $698 million tender offer.
<p>
   Indianapolis-based Simon DeBartolo, the largest U.S. real estate
company, gains control of 12 malls and neighborhood shopping
centers with about 12 million square feet of space, including the
Menlo Park Mall in Edison, New Jersey, and the Westchester Mall in
White Plains, New York.
<p>
   The company didn't say how much of a stake it acquired, only
that it was a ``substantial'' majority. Retail Property is owned by
pension funds. Its biggest shareholders include AT&AMP;T Master Pension
Trust, Bell Atlantic Master Trust, California State Teacher's
Retirement System and Ford Motor Company Master Trust Fund.
<p>
   Simon DeBartolo offered to buy the shares of Retail Property it
didn't already own for $19.375 each, or about $698 million. Before
the tender offer, which ended last night, it owned about 2.3
million shares.
<p>
   The offer was an attempt to break up a three-way merger between
Retail Property, and mall portfolios owned by Cleveland developer
Richard Jacobs and New England Development of Boston, creating a
company with 55 properties and 75 million square feet of space.
That would make it one of the largest in the U.S.
<p>
   Jacobs -- owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team --and New
England Development said earlier this week they would not top Simon
DeBartolo's offer.
<p>
   The offer valued Retail Property at about $1.19 billion,
including the assumption of debt.
<p>
   Simon DeBartolo owns and manages 118 malls and shopping centers
with 131 million square feet. Simon DeBartolo is worth about $10
billion, including debt.

A FEW FACTS ABOUT HONEY &HT;    Sidebar to HONEY-ROSH
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   By JAN NORRIS
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   ANY TYPE OF HONEY is fine to cook with, as long as it hasn't
oxidized too long.
<p>
   HONEY is perfect for cakes and other pastries, since it acts as
a preservative and adds more moisture than plain sugar. It is
sweeter by volume, however, and substituting it can be difficult in
recipes, since it also replaces some liquids. It's best to use
honey-specific recipes, but you can use to + cup of honey for every
cup of sugar called for. Decrease liquids by , cup for every + cup
of honey added.
<p>
   TO STORE HONEY, keep it tightly capped and away from light.
Avoid contaminating the jar with other foods, which could cause
mold to form. As honey sits, it sometimes becomes cloudy, or forms
crystals around the edges of the jar. This is normal, and can be
remedied by placing the jar in a pan of warm water until it
liquifies again. You also can put it in the microwave, with the lid
off, and heat on high power, stirring every 30 seconds, until the
honey clears.
<p>
   HONEY'S NUTRITION is often overrated; it does have a slight
amount of potassium (11 milligrams per tablespoon) and trace
amounts of vitamins C and A. Otherwise, its profile approximates
table sugar with 60 calories and 16 grams of carbohydrates per
tablespoon.
<p>
   THE TOP TASTES
<p>
   Here are the major honeys in Florida, which tied last year with
California for top honey production in the country. (Both states
earned $22.9 million for their nectars.) Tupelo  &MD;  found mostly in
the northeast and north central areas of Florida, it's prized by
connoisseurs for purity and flavor, and has a mild taste. Citrus
blossom  &MD;  Comes from grapefruit, which requires bees for
pollination. Most oranges do not. It has a faint citrus flavor.
Palmetto blossom  &MD;  Common at roadside stands, it has an herbal
flavor. Clover  &MD;  The most common honey sold in the United States.
This type could be any blossom plus clover  &MD;  bees don't always
stick to nectar from one type of plant to bring back to the hive.

   Vancouver, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Q-Entertainment Inc. said
it's holding discussions that may result in the
indoor-entertainment-center operator merging with a major Asian
company.

SPORTS COMMENTARY: Hurting Horns better have something to say to
Owls &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  An hour or so after the game, Jay Humphrey's
parents wanted to dine out and treat their son to a good meal.
Fancy restaurant. Silk napkins. Silverware. The works.
<p>
   Humphrey RSVPed no. The UCLA game had sucked the appetite right
out of the Texas offensive tackle.
<p>
   ``You don't want to show your face in public,'' Humphrey said.
``That game hurt your feelings. We just decided to get something
and take it home.''
<p>
   Two weeks later, Texas hungers for atonement. A computer ranks
the Longhorns 81st in the nation behind Miami-Florida, Miami-Ohio
and Miami High. That same computer ranks Rice 45th. I say that
computer bytes. Any football team that has as many luxury boxes as
Texas can't be lower than 80th.
<p>
   Texas will win Saturday because it has no other choice. At 1-1
with the heart of the schedule lying ahead, Rice has become a
crossroads game. John Mackovic's teams have lost 10 games by 21
points or more but gone 6-2-1 in the games that followed.
<p>
   Saturday's showdown with a 2-1 Owls team brings the program to
another critical juncture. This game will determine whether Texas
has any realistic shot at a repeat Big 12 championship, whether
Mackovic is capable of making the necessary adjustments, whether
defensive players can stop their own shadows from gaining 300 yards
on the ground and whether the Longhorns order takeout the rest of
the fall.
<p>
   Mackovic made a bold announcement Monday that he does not want
his personnel moves reported and, if that rule is violated,
threatened to close practices. I'll go him one better. If his
personnel moves don't work, he might as well close games. Does this
mean Mackovic has found someone deep on the depth chart who
actually knows how to tackle?
<p>
   The fans didn't look in any mood to stick around two weeks ago.
Thousands streamed out of Royal-Memorial Stadium early in the
second quarter of the UCLA game in search of grocery-bag hats.
<p>
   ``It's depressing that when things go bad, so many fans leave,''
Humphrey said. ``We have some great fans, but a lot of college fans
are fair-weather fans. They love you to death but when things are
going bad, they'd just as soon spit on you.''
<p>
   Lose to Rice, and the Longhorns will take umbrellas on to the
field. One detects quiet resolve from the players but no seething
anger or righteous indignation after that 66-3 heartbreaker against
UCLA.
<p>
   Bill Little, Texas' 30-year assistant athletic director, was
quoted in the Washington Post as saying: ``The best way to put it
from my point of view is that certainly nobody is happy about it,
but certainly nobody's going to lose any sleep over it, either.''
<p>
   Little knows better. Texas has sunk so low that it's to accept
63-point defeats at home against 0-2 teams? Another loss like that,
and the administration will use those luxury boxes to bury the
bodies.
<p>
   The coaches appear to have gotten their players' attention with
grueling, three-hour workouts during the open week. The Longhorns
ran 53 offensive plays on Wednesday of the off week and 50 the next
day. No count on the number of turnovers.
<p>
   ``That's three-fourths of a game,'' Humphrey said. ``We were all
thinking, `Are they trying to kill us?' But that's what we needed
to be doing.''
<p>
   Rice's triple option represents a formidable challenge, mostly
because Texas is worst at what Rice does best. The Owls gained 461
yards rushing against a Northwestern team that limited Oklahoma to
151. Only Army and Nebraska have stronger ground games, but then
one is well-known for its infantry and the other throws a pass now
and then only to keep its receivers out of the ACLU offices.
<p>
   The Longhorns have a triple option of their own. They can pound
the Owls and get back on track for what still could be a
championship season, albeit a tainted one. They can edge Rice and
leave Rice Stadium with as many doubts as they came in with. Or
they can fold up like a savings and loan and tank the season.
<p>
   This is a statement game in which Texas will state its
intentions for 1997. It's that simple.
<p>
   ``It's huge,'' Humphrey said. ``It's almost going to make or
break us. This game is going to determine what people think of us.
If we lose, people are going to think Texas obviously isn't good at
all. And if we go kill Rice, people will say that's what they
expected Texas to do.''

<p>
   London, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.K. stocks rose to records,
bond yields touched four-year lows and the pound tumbled amid
expectations the government is considering joining a European
single currency earlier than previously thought.
<p>
   Government officials stopped short of denying a Financial Times
report, which cited an unidentified cabinet minister saying the
U.K. was set to announce it may join monetary union soon after its
planned 1999 start. The officials called the report speculative.
<p>
   Joining economic and monetary union, or EMU, would mean lower
U.K. interest rates -- the base rate could drop from 7.0 percent
toward the German Bundesbank's 3.0 percent key rate, which serves
as Europe's benchmark -- because countries joining the single
currency will adopt a shared official interest rate.
<p>
   ``This is quite a significant story and a believable one,'' said
Job Curtis, a fund manager at Henderson Investors, which controls
about $16 billion in U.K. equities. ``We're probably not going to
be entering the first round but at least there's a more positive
view.''
<p>
   U.K. stocks soared to records, led by banks, with the benchmark
FT-SE 100 Index on track to post its biggest one-day gain. The
FT-SE 100 jumped as much as 154.8 points, or 3.04 percent, to
5220.3, beating the 5095.3 reached on Aug. 7. and set its 42nd
all-time high of the year.
<p>
   The yield on the U.K.'s benchmark 10-year gilt fell 19 basis
points to 6.41 percent, the first time it's traded below 6.5
percent since Feb. 4, 1994.
<p>
   Before it was elected in May, the Labour government pledged not
to join EMU unless a national referendum approved going in. With
investors increasingly convinced the single currency -- the euro --
will go ahead on time, pressure is growing for Britain to decide. A
MORI poll in April indicated, however, that 54 percent of U.K.
adults were against Britain adopting a single currency.
<p>
   ``It's certainly good news for the U.K. bond market, and for
equities on a valuation basis,'' said Jim Stride, director of asset
allocation for Sun Life Investment Management Ltd., which oversees
about 22 billion pounds ($35 billion). ``Equity valuations are a
function of current and future dividend and earnings expectations.
If you plug current bond yields into the calculations, it raises
the value of U.K. stocks.''
<p>
   ``If the U.K. becomes a full partner in Europe, and the European
central bank maintains a tight grip on monetary policy and
inflation, it would also raise the relative attraction to bonds,''
Stride said.
<p>
   Expectations the U.K. may be poised to fix the pound's value
against other European currencies sent sterling tumbling to 2.8280
deutsche marks from 2.8698 yesterday, and to $1.6121 from $1.6299.
<p>
   In May, the European Commission will fix the exchange rates for
countries joining EMU. Economists expect Britain would want to fix
the pound's rate below its current trading level, to avoid
crippling British exporters.
<p>
   ``We would reckon that the pound would join EMU around 2.60
marks,'' said Eric Fishwick, international economist at Nikko
Europe. ``But we wouldn't look for the spot rate to fall that low.
We're seeing a knee-jerk reaction, but looking more realistically
the market already knew Labour had a pro-EMU cabinet.''

HONEY A SWEET BEGINNING FOR JEWISH NEW YEAR &HT;    Has sidebar: HONEY-FACTS
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   By JAN NORRIS
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Next week brings a new year for Jews everywhere, and many will
celebrate it at the Rosh Hashana table with honey, to ensure a
sweet, or happy year.
<p>
   ``My mother always made beef tzimmes sweetened with honey,''
said Arlene Kurfurst of Boynton Beach, Fla. Rose Lipman's version
of the simmered beef dish also is flavored with pineapple and
ginger.
<p>
   Honey cake has become the traditional dessert at the Rosh
Hashana meal. Florence Cohen of Boynton Beach said her
mother-in-law, Lena Cohen, made a cake that was ahead of her time  &MD; 
it contained no oil. ``Her children liked the cake kind of rubbery,
so she added extra honey for the family,'' she recalls. Today,
Cohen makes her own version, sweetened with honey and orange juice.
<p>
   Dana Scott, executive director of Temple Beth El in West Palm
Beach, said the typical holiday table will feature apples to be
sliced and dunked in a bowl of honey. ``The apples mark the
harvest. So the honey-apple pairing means you're hoping for an
abundance of food and joy during the year.''
<p>
   The holiday begins at sundown Wednesday (Oct. 1), and continues
through sundown Oct. 3.
<p>
   The honey-dipped fruit is a part of a ritual blessing, and
special prayers are said as the fruit is dipped. One is for
repentance and a new slate for the coming year: ``May it be thy
will, Lord our God and God of our fathers, that you should tear up
any evil decree and let only our merits be read before You.''
Another is for thanks for the past year: ``Blessed art Thou, O Lord
our God, who hast kept us alive, sustained us, and enabled us to
reach this special day.''
<p>
   Often the challah, or egg bread commonly formed into a braid, is
dipped into the honey as well.
<p>
   Honey is one of the earliest foods mentioned in the written
word. Early Bibles and religious texts frequently refer to it,
though there is some controversy concerning the origin of the honey
since no beekeepers are mentioned in the Bible.
<p>
   Claudia Roden, author of ``The Book of Jewish Food'' (1996,
Knopf), writes that most descriptions of honey probably refer to
the liquid made from soaking and boiling dates in water. However,
she writes, Samson was described as eating honey from a hive of
bees made in the skull of a lion. Honey also is part of a
description given by God of the Promised Land: A land where milk
and honey freely flows.
<p>
   Honey plays a role in other Jewish rituals as well, according to
the Encyclopedia Judaica, considered an important historical source
on Judaism. Wedding guests help the bride and groom eat honeyed
cakes and sweets to help bless a sweet future. In some countries,
the couple returning from its honeymoon will find the top of its
front door frame coated in the sticky sweet as a house blessing.
<p>
   Jewish children learning their scriptures in medieval days were
treated to a Hebrew alphabet outlined in honey. They were allowed
to lick the letters from the pages, so that they would always
associate the word of God with sweetness.

COMMENTARY: A singular honor &HT;    By Gary Borders
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas  &MD;  I have been offered a singular honor, one
that ranks right up there with recently being invited to join the
American Association of Retired Persons. That invitation sent me
into a depression for weeks.
<p>
   The mail last week brought an offer to join the Handyman Club of
America as a charter member. Whoa. My reputation has reached beyond
my quiet neighborhood. Somehow, I knew, this day would come.
<p>
   Enclosed in the packet was an official Handyman of America
membership card, which looks like a credit card. The background
shows several tools, most of which I can identify if not
necessarily use. My name is embossed in gold lettering, along with
the words, ``Charter Member.'' Cool.
<p>
   Also enclosed is a decal which I have stuck on the side of my
computer at home, along with the United States Golf Association
decal and a sticker from Mr. Beer Micro Brewery. I didn't actually
join the USGA, but I appreciated the free decal. As for the Mr.
Beer sticker, it comes from a failed attempt to make my own brewski
this summer. The result tasted sort of like fermented mint tea.
<p>
   At least it beats the last time I attempted to brew beer, about
15 years ago. That attempt resulted in several dozen bottles
exploding in a spare bedroom of my brewing partner's fancy condo,
an unfortunate incident which he blames for his marriage breaking
up. Of course, if he hadn't had the temerity to try to make his
wife clean up the mess they'd probably still be married.
<p>
   Anyway, the welcome letter from the Handyman Club of America
starts out well. SEND NO MONEY. That's always a good sign. As a
club member, I can be an official product tester of new tools,
equipment and material. And I get to keep the tested product for
free. And if I join within 14 days, I get a mini-hacksaw, a
magazine subscription, and new product test reports. You can see
why I'm excited.
<p>
   I have no idea why I've been chosen to be a charter member of
this august organization. I am a handyman in spirit, but a darned
mediocre one. I am willing to tackle most any project except major
carpentry and anything to do with electricity more complicated than
changing light bulbs and swapping out a wall outlet. But that
doesn't mean I'm any good at it.
<p>
   The other day, I was attempting to fix a toilet lid that had
slipped off one of its hinges. I pulled, pried and yanked on this
piece of fiberglass to no avail. I couldn't slip the lid back on
the plastic pin that serves as a hinge. After about 30 minutes, I
was about to give up and head to the Big Discount Store for a new
$10 lid, when I finally succeeded in getting the lid back on...
upside down. I pried and pulled some more. Then I realized the pins
could be slid back and forth from the other side, which made
putting the lid on right a piece of cake. I then finished the job
in about 10 seconds.
<p>
   A real handyman would not make this type of error.
<p>
   There's also the time I decided to cap off an ice-maker copper
tube beneath the sink because my refrigerator didn't have an ice
maker. I promptly broke something, and water began gushing out into
a house that I had bought 24 hours earlier. A neighbor luckily had
a tool to turn off the water, and a plumber was summoned.
<p>
   The horror stories abound. I have had enough modest successes to
keep trying, an attitude akin to why hackers like me continue to
play golf. It's those rare great shots that one remembers, not the
dozens of shanks and pulls.
<p>
   But I'm worried about testing new products. That's the only
thing holding me back from joining the Handyman Club of America.
The price, at $12 a year, is modest. But my inability to figure out
how complicated tools work is legendary. I once borrowed a power
miter saw and spent a half-day trying to figure out how to lift the
blade, since I was too embarrassed to call the owner. What will I
do if they send me some high-tech gizmo to test, and I can't even
figure out how to turn it on?
<p>
   If I accept membership, I must agree to a statement of conduct,
of which one of the rules is that I will ``conduct myself in a
courteous fashion while wearing or displaying the Club's emblem.''
I guess I better put the card in a drawer when trying to fix
something, since my home-repair efforts generally involve more than
a few well-chosen expletives.
<p>
   Still the lure of a mini hacksaw is nearly more than I can
resist. Plus this membership card is pretty nifty. If I could just
figure out what that weird tool at the bottom of the card is
supposed to be.

   Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) --Consolidated
Papers Inc. shares are expected to fall today on the outlook for
disappointing third-quarter profit, which the company blamed on
shutdowns because of lightning strikes and difficulty restarting
mills after routine maintenance.
<p>
   The papermaker said it expects to report earnings of 55 cents a
share, well below the range of 72 cents to 85 cents expected by
analysts. The average estimate is 78 cents, based on a poll of nine
analysts by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers expects to report earnings on Oct. 8. In the
1996 third quarter, it reported net income of $40.3 million, or 90
cents a share, on sales $380.8 million.
<p>
   The quarter's performance was hindered by startup difficulties
following mill maintenance, and four plants were struck by
lightning in late-summer thunderstorms, causing them to be shut
down for up to two days each, the company said in a statement.
<p>
   The Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin-based company said it expects to
meet analysts' expectations for earnings in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers made the forecast late yesterday after the
close of trading. Its shares fell 1/8 yesterday to 58 9/16.

HOLLIMON'S WAY: OVERCOME &HT;    Athlete, poet, survivor: Morehouse RB beat harsh childhood's
challenges with verse, inner strength.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   By Earnest Reese
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  Most of his peers at prestigious Morehouse College are
the offspring of parents with solid, best-of-America backgrounds.
Rod Hollimon's mother was an unwed 14-year-old still in junior high
when he was born.
<p>
   Most of his teammates began looking up to their fathers long
before they entered preschool. Hollimon grew up looking down on his
dad, a crack addict who has not yet kicked his drug habit.
<p>
   While most of his classmates were being nurtured in a secure
home environment, Hollimon was given up by his mother at the age of
3 and forced to find temporary residence with sympathetic
relatives.
<p>
   No one at Morehouse has done more to cheat the mean streets out
of another victim than Rod Hollimon, a sophomore running back from
Augusta, Ga.
<p>
   As a senior in high school, Hollimon was named 1995 Class AAA
player of the year afer leading Josey High to a 15-0 record and the
state title with more than 1,700 yards rushing. His 3,600 career
rushing yards is a school record.
<p>
   Hollimon's off-field credentials were even more impressive  &MD;  he
finished high school with a 4.0 grade-point average, was a merit
scholar, served as president of the National Honor Society, was
part of the school's gifted program, sang in the school choir for
four years and was co-president of the Student Council.
<p>
   ``He was an unusual kid in that he was very independent,''
former Josey High football coach John Starr said. ``But he'd do
anything it took to help the team win. All of his teammates
respected Rod because he didn't just talk the talk, he walked the
walk. He was the hardest-working kid I've ever been around. I'm
still amazed at the things he accomplished  &MD;  knowing what he had to
deal with growing up.''
<p>
   Hollimon also wrote a book  &MD;  a collection of poems  &MD;  that he
paid to have published earlier this year. ``Reflections of a World
of Reality'' consists of only 63 pages, but it is a compelling
intrusion into the mind and heart of a young man gone good.
<p>
   ``I started writing poetry when I was ninth grade,'' he says.
``It never occurred me then that I'd ever be sharing my thoughts
with the world.''
<p>
   Hollimon, who considers himself an ``avowed Christian,'' has
long since forgiven his parents and those lighter-skinned cousins
who would ridicule him for being much darker-skinned. The influence
of his late grandmother, Aliene Hollimon Bland, was far-reaching
inshaping his outlook. He dedicated his book to her memory.
<p>
   ``A godsend? That's exactly what she was,'' Hollimon says. ``My
grandmother was very religious. Not only was she the backbone of
her family, but the backbone of the neighborhood, too.
<p>
   ``That's one thing I give my mother credit for. She could've
aborted me or put me up for adoption, but instead she left me with
family. I'm now able to understand more of what she was going
through at age 14. We've talked about it lately, and I can still
see the hurt in her eyes.''
<p>
   Unfortunately for Hollimon, the grandmother who taught him about
Christian charity, proper manners and the difference between right
and wrong, passed away when he was 10.
<p>
   ``When she died, everything got crazy again,'' Hollimon said.
<p>
   Upon his grandmother's death, Hollimon  &MD;  along with two uncles,
a cousin and his grandmother's husband, Roosevelt Bland  &MD;  saw the
harmony of their three-bedroom household in Augusta's Gilbert Manor
housing project fall apart. Hollimon was forced to move from place
to place with his father, Jerry, who eventually abandoned him
before he turned 12.
<p>
   ``We would stay with any relative who felt sorry for us,''
Hollimon said. ``I saw him smoke crack for the first time when I
was about 9. I didn't know exactly what he was doing at the time,
but I knew it was something terribly wrong. Then, when we were
living with these different relatives, I'd see him doing it and it
would upset me, because I knew that if they caught him, we'd be
right back out in the streets.''
<p>
   That's where Hollimon found himself when his father left for
Florida, not to return to Augusta until his son's junior year in
high school. Rod became the ``outsider'' in the home of an aunt who
had some eight children and grandchildren of her own to see after.
<p>
   ``I tried to fit in, but I felt out of place,'' he said. ``I
know I wasn't the best kid to be around at that time, because I was
confused and trying to find myself. I saw at that age how a
youngster could get caught up in drugs  &MD;  selling it or using it.
But after watching what it did to my dad and his friends, there was
no way I was going to get involved in anything like that.''
<p>
   When the fights with older cousins became too much to bear, and
feeding and clothing him a burden, Hollimon nearly became a ward of
the state.
<p>
   ``I had to wear hand-me-down clothes  &MD;  shoes of someone else
that were too big for me,'' he said. ``Seems like there wasn't a
day that passed that I didn't have to fight someone, even though I
never started a fight. Kids can be so cruel making funO5% you. But
there were some adults who did it, too.''
<p>
   But Hollimon began to turn all the negatives into positives when
he moved in with his uncle Willie Hollimon, an imposing
300-plus-pound minister who lived alone.
<p>
   ``They were talking about putting Rod in a foster home, but
since he was a Hollimon, I couldn't sit back and watch that
happen,'' said Rev. Hollimon, 41. ``When he came to stay with me,
he was half grown, and it was pretty rough. I had to guide him back
into childhood.''
<p>
   Both uncle and nephew say their relationship was turbulent from
the outset, but it evolved into a ``family thing'' that each
benefited from.
<p>
   ``He wanted to play football (in junior high school), but I told
him if he wanted to play, he had to make good grades,'' Rev.
Hollimon said. ``He was always a bright kid, and once he saw what
he could do if he applied himself, he started doing more and
more.''
<p>
   Diane Gilyard, an English teacher at Josey, saw something
special in Hollimon the year before he was to become one of her
pupils.
<p>
   ``I first noticed him as a 10th-grader. He appeared very mature
and serious,'' she said. ``Then, when he became a student of mine,
he kept me motivated with his quest for learning. He always wanted
to know more. A gifted student isn't necessarily one with all the
answers but rather one with all the questions. Rod's perseverance
was a virtue he upheld. That was very inspiring to see.''
<p>
   Hollimon received at least five scholarship offers, and chose to
attend The Citadel. ``Because people I was coming in contact with
spoke so highly of it,'' he said. But almost immediately, he knew
that choice was not the best.
<p>
   ``I wanted to transfer, but it wasn't because of the academics
or the rigid discipline,'' he said. ``I stayed there a year and
succeeded to prove to myself that I could handle it if I had to.
But I wasn't happy. It came down to whether I wanted to stay there
four years and be unhappy, or transfer to a school with a strong
academic reputation that would embrace my individuality.''
<p>
   Hollimon never played football at The Citadel, where three
veteran players were ahead of him on the depth chart. In August, he
transferred to Division II Morehouse, where he became eligible to
play without sitting out a year.
<p>
   Citadel coach Don Powers said, ``He was an excellent student
here  &MD;  a real interesting young man. But he felt like that this was
not the right environment for him.''
<p>
   Like most athletes at Morehouse, Hollimon receives only a
partial scholarship. The balance of his fees that cover tuition and
room and board are unpaid. A book signing in Augusta several months
ago provided him with little more than the cost of getting his work
published.
<p>
   An English major aspiring to a career in mass communications,
Hollimon suffered a preseason shoulder injury that has kept him
from competing for a starting position. In limited play, he has
three carries for 15 yards, and an 11-yard pass reception.
<p>
   Regardless of Hollimon's on-field performance, first-year coach
Doug Williams sees the value of having him on the team.
<p>
   ``Whether Rod gains a yard or not, it's worth having him on this
football team,'' Williams said. ``We're talking about a kid who is
a survivor  &MD;  a fighter. Society says that a kid who grew up like he
did is doomed to failure, but he's beaten all the odds. If there is
a kid in America who needs to be identified and taken under your
wings, it's this kid.''

HOW DI'S DRESSES CHANGED A WOMAN'S LIFE &HT;    By PAUL LOMARTIRE
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Three weeks ago, Maureen Rorech was just ``an anonymous Florida
buyer'' - an obscure woman with self-made means who spent $670,000
to buy 13 of Princess Diana's gowns.
<p>
   Last week, fresh from Larry King Live, Rorech faced a news
conference like a pro. Diana's dresses - and the princess' sudden
death - have thrust the 37-year-old single mother into the
spotlight and turned her into an unlikely ambassador for Diana's
charities.
<p>
   Rorech is a businesswoman, the CEO of a retail and home
furnishings company, but she prefers to be called the ``guardian''
of Diana's gowns, not the ``owner.''
<p>
   When she announced last week that her 13 dresses, plus 10 more
owned by others, would go on a ``Queen of Hearts'' tour to benefit
Diana's charities, Rorech admitted that the ball gowns had brought
her attention - and responsibility - she never expected.
<p>
   ``Has it taken over my life? Sure.'' she says, but she doesn't
need her Ohio State degree in journalism to understand how
publicity works.
<p>
   She'll travel with the tour  &MD;  at least at the beginning  &MD; 
because she wants to ``share a vision so everyone can get excited
and revisit why this is happening.''
<p>
   Her ``why'' is a well-thought-out mission for charity, she says.
``I just want to make sure I do it right.''
<p>
   Doing it right began in June, when Rorech bought the dresses by
phone during the Christie's auction.
<p>
   She didn't have a catalog, so she sketched out each dress before
deciding to buy it. She wanted dresses from different phases of
Diana's life, and she got them - 13 gowns that the princess wore
from 1985 until the end of her life.
<p>
   There was a dark green velvet gown by Victor Edelstein that
Diana wore to private dinners at Kensington Palace. Pressed into
the velvet is a child's handprint, perhaps the hand of one of her
sons.
<p>
   There was a pink embroidered gown designed by Catherine Walker
that Diana wore on a tour of India in 1992. Diana's blond hair was
found in the beadwork.
<p>
   And there was the famous ``Travolta gown'' - the blue velvet
dress that Diana wore to a 1985 White House party where she danced
with John Travolta. Rorech paid $222,500 for that gown, the highest
price ever paid for a costume at auction, easily topping the
$145,000 spent on the white disco suit Travolta wore in the film
Saturday Night Fever.
<p>
   That dress was particularly important to her, Rorech told Katie
Couric of the Today show, because it represented the dance between
two icons - the people's princess and the movie star.
<p>
   Rorech was motivated by a pre-auction Diana interview in Vogue
when the princess was asked who she hoped would buy her gowns.
``Anyone,'' Diana said, ``who will use them to do good for these
two very important causes'' - AIDS and cancer research.
<p>
   ``That was an inspiration, no doubt,'' recalled Rorech, who is
on the board of directors of the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of Tampa Bay.
<p>
   Initially, she planned to use the gowns to raise charity cash as
well as draw attention to her style company.
<p>
   As CEO of M Inc., Rorech oversees a rapidly growing retail
company - which recently started catalog and Internet sales - that
includes fashion, furniture, fitness and personal care.
<p>
   Her four M stores in the Tampa area are upscale women's clothing
boutiques, with expansion planned for Palm Beach County and Miami.
Her home design store in Tampa is called Moda For the Home.
<p>
   ``We're moving fast and we're moving hard,'' she says.
<p>
   That seems to be the story of her business life.
<p>
   Rorech, who also collects Michael Jordan memorabilia (for her
sons) and snow globes (for herself), is able to do serious shopping
because of her work for Romac International. The Tampa-based
professional staffing service provides skilled workers, both
temporary and permanent, for financial, computer, information,
health care and other high-tech businesses.
<p>
   She started as a receptionist with a Columbus, Ohio, temp agency
to pay her way through Ohio State, and she learned the staffing
business. She went on to help start Romac International's temporary
division in 1986 and became a managing partner of a franchise group
for the company. When the franchises were combined and went public
last year, she cashed in. She is currently a director for Romac.
<p>
   ``Just a lot of hard work,'' she says of that success.
<p>
   Rorech is also an adjunct professor of marketing at the
University of Tampa, and now, with Diana's death, she is carefully
using her marketing skills to craft the ``Queen of Hearts'' tour
for charity - turning the emphasis away from any business
advantage.
<p>
   On Friday, she hired a tour director who will plan the tour
stops. The tour begins Nov. 16 at a $250-per-person,
invitation-only Tampa benefit. The 18to 24-month museum tour will
include reception parties, T-shirts and other souvenirs and end in
London. All money raised under the umbrella of the Rorech-created
People's Princess Charitable Foundation will go to charities
involving AIDS and cancer research or children's services.
<p>
   And then, when the tour is over, Rorech will ask Diana's sons,
princes William and Harry, for some advice.
<p>
   ``After much soul-searching and discussions with our family and
friends,'' Rorech said last week, ``my boys and I have decided that
the late princess' boys will be asked to tell us where they think
12 of our gowns should end up after the worldwide tour.''
<p>
   The Travolta dress will stay on display in the United States.
<p>
   Rorech took her three sons - the oldest is 9 - with her when she
flew to New York to pick up the gowns at a Long Island airport
hangar.
<p>
   ``The first question out of my oldest was, `Could that happen to
you?' `` Rorech recalled. ``That's the fear of every child, losing
their mother. My boys are sensitive to what (Diana's) boys are
going through.''
<p>
   Rorech was at home working, with her sons asleep, when her
sister called with the news that Diana had died.
<p>
   ``It hit me,'' she said. ``It stopped me in my tracks just like
anybody else.''
<p>
   She doesn't have a TV at home - ``I don't like the kids to be
able to turn on TV and hear hard news and see things they shouldn't
see'' - so she got details on the accident by calling a friend who
stuck a portable phone on a bean bag chair while CNN aired.
<p>
   Overnight, the ``anonymous Florida buyer'' - who is so tiny she
would drown in Diana's size 8 gowns - became a personality.
<p>
   The dresses went into a Tampa bank vault, her Web site
(www.princessdigowns.com) averaged 70,000 hits in the days after
the accident, and the ``Queen of Hearts'' tour was born.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks are likely to rise
as bonds recaptured some of yesterday's loss.
<p>
   Banks and multinationals such as General Electric Co. are
expected to lead the market higher, after suffering some of the
biggest losses yesterday. Falling bond yields make stock investing
more attractive and bolster companies profit outlook by cutting
borrowing costs.
<p>
   Stocks may be stuck in a narrow band without further gains in
the bond market, investors said. Yesterday, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 58.70 to 7848.01. It is down 0.9 percent
this week.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent, about where it started the week.
<p>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index futures traded overnight pointed to
a higher opening. The contract expiring in December rose 6 to
952.5, about 7 points above fair value. An equivalent rise in the
Dow industrials could tack on 60 points to yesterday's close.
<p>
   A batch of companies could see their shares drop after reporting
weaker-than-expected earnings for the current quarter.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, said
it could report a loss of 12 cents to 18 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the
year-ago period. Bridgeport shares rose 1/8 to 11 1/2 yesterday
before trading was halted.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. said it expects third-quarter earnings
of about 55 cents a share, far below analyst estimates of as much
as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, said it expects third-quarter
earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less than the
year-ago 51 cents a share, citing production and shipment delays.
<p>
   Darden Restaurants Inc., which operates the Olive Garden, Red
Lobster and Bahama Breeze chains, reported profit a penny better
than the average estimate of 15 cents.

BOOK HONORS LADIES BORN BELOW MASON-DIXON LINE &HT;    By LORETTA GRANTHAM
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Scarlett O'Hara, my dear, is just the tip of the iceberg.
<p>
   ``When I was studying abroad, this British woman asked me, `What
would you Southerners do without Vivien Leigh?' '' recalls Seale
Ballenger, author of ``Hell's Belles: A Tribute to the Spitfires,
Bad Seeds and Steel Magnolias of the New and Old South'' (Conari
Press, $14.95). ``And it made me think. That stereotype, that myth,
exists all over the world. But the way it emerged was because of
very real women.''
<p>
   Such as Tallulah Bankhead of Alabama. Delta Burke of Florida.
Eudora Welty of Mississippi. And Dixie Carter of Tennessee.
<p>
   Ballenger's humorous salute isn't limited to prom queens and
plantation prima donnas. Also included are Maya Angelou, Oprah
Winfrey, Selena, Rosa Parks and others. (Even RuPaul gets a
mention, although that does seem like a stretch).
<p>
   ``Anybody who is feisty, headstrong and grew up below the
Mason-Dixon Line qualifies,'' says Ballenger, 33, an Alabama native
who craves okra and sweet tea. ``There are plenty more than the 200
women I wrote about.''
<p>
   Also given a nod are maybe-not-so-dumb belles Vanna White of
South Carolina, ``who got rich off looking good in a dress, keeping
quiet and knowing the alphabet,'' Ballenger writes, and Marla
Maples of Georgia, ``who accessed a fabulous fortune the
old-fashioned way  &MD;  by getting pregnant.''
<p>
   ``Southern belles are very diverse, but one thing's for sure,''
the author says. ``You may have the qualities  &MD;  independence,
charm, wit, intelligence  &MD;  but you just can't be from New Jersey.
There's an X factor that comes from growing up on grits.''

YOU CAN BE A CYBER STAR: NEW SOFTWARE WILL LET YOU `BROADCAST' FROM
YOUR PC &HT;    By DOUGLAS KALAJIAN
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   You have peace now: No photographers follow you to Publix; no
one asks for your autograph; People magazine never calls, except
when your subscription is about to lapse.
<p>
   Isn't it awful?
<p>
   If only there were a way to let the world know how beautiful you
are, how brilliant you are, how fascinating you are.
<p>
   There is. And it's cheap.
<p>
   The idea is an updated version of the video-telephone, that
staple of world's fairs past. Except that this one will carry your
voice and visage worldwide across the Internet.
<p>
   Which means that pretty much anyone, anywhere can tune in.
<p>
   ``Think of yourself as a news station,'' said Chris Buffum, a
senior vice president of Boca Research Inc., which is about to
market an everything-you-need video package for home computers.
``You can broadcast  &MD;  live.''
<p>
   The news would be whatever you wanted it to be.
<p>
   You could show off your new baby, your new Lexus, your new nose
job. You could play the violin, bake a cheesecake, buff your
toenails.
<p>
   Or you could look gravely into the camera and intone your
thoughts on world peace or herbal healing.
<p>
   You might even pick a regular broadcast time that would sear
itself into the memories of soon-to-become-loyal viewers. (Go
ahead: take Thursday at 9. You're funnier than Seinfeld, right?)
<p>
   For now, your total audience will be limited to four people at a
time, but if you are truly engaging, you could build up a worldwide
queue of fans waiting to click on. You could also make yourself
available in digital reruns for latecomers.
<p>
   Video conferencing isn't new, but the breakthrough is that you
don't have to own a corporation to join in. (There are also some
technical matters involving 56K modem speed and H.324 compliance
that, sadly, cannot be illuminated here.)
<p>
   The Boca Video Communications Suite includes Cast-a-Vision
software (less than $50 by itself) plus a digital camera, a
microphone and a modem card that goes inside your computer. You
also need a Pentium-based PC and an Internet account.
<p>
   The suite is supposed to cost $239 when it hits stores by the
end of this month. Intel Corp. is planning a similar package
expected to sell for $199 to $399, depending on features.
<p>
   The Boca Research package will not demand a great deal of time
or computer expertise to set up, Buffum said.
<p>
   ``All you have to do is plug in the card and load the software,
which takes about 10 minutes, and you're ready to go,'' Buffum
said.
<p>
   If you want to have a two-way, full-motion conversation, the
person on the other end would need similar equipment and software.
But any computer user with one of the commonly used Internet
browsers could see and hear you just fine.
<p>
   How fine? You'd look on screen pretty much the way you do in
person except that you'd be a bit grainy and your movements would
be jerky, neither of which hurt Charlie Chaplin.
<p>
   The half second it takes to jam all this information into a
phone line and suck it out the other end will also give you a
slight echo. But how fussy can you get when, once you've plugged in
and booted up, you can reach anywhere around the world for the
price of a local phone call?
<p>
   Whether the world reaches back is up to you. On the company's
video conference Web site (http://www.bocaplace.com), you have the
option of limiting access with a password, or of allowing anyone to
take a look. There's no charge to hold a conference at the site.
<p>
   You'd alert potential viewers by posting a note about yourself
and your presentation at the site, the Internet equivalent of
nailing your theses to the cathedral door.
<p>
   With ideas as profound as yours, who could resist a peek?
<p>

POUND ALIENS, PLOT DESTINY IN ADDICTIVE SPACE GAMES &HT;    By KEROUAC SMITH
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Space has been the fruitful frontier for gamers. Classics from
``Star Trek'' to the ``Space Quest'' series have brought us worlds
unknown and horrors unimaginable.
<p>
   Here are two new ones that enrich the tradition and appeal
especially to fans of real-time strategy games such as ``Command &AMP;
Conquer'' and ``Warcraft.'' ``X-Com Apocalypse'' (Microprose, $55):
You'll spend months on this complicated and ultimately
all-consuming game that combines war strategy with arcade action.
<p>
   You command a force of agents, biochemists, physicists and
engineers assigned to protect a teeming metropolis from alien
invasions. On your side are the government, your lone source of
cash, and Megapol, the leading weapons supplier.
<p>
   Early in the game, alien incidents are few and your enemies are
weak. Good thing. You'll need time to feel your way around, design
attack and defense strategies and plow through the 212-page manual
before the onslaught.
<p>
   When the fighting starts, you'll love ``X-Com's'' ability to
switch from real-time to turn-based combat. In turn-based, you
control the movements of every agent under your command (up to 36).
That can be a blessing or a bore, depending on your mood. Large
battles can last an hour as you and the computer take turns barking
out dozens of orders. Things speed up in real-time, where you make
decisions on the fly and control units of six agents according to
general guidelines set up beforehand.
<p>
   Back at the base, you hire agents, equip them, make additions to
your base and cover a host of other details. Whether you're ready
for the inevitable full-bore alien attack depends on how well
you've managed your forces, financed research and maintained
relationships with weapons suppliers.
<p>
   ``X-Com'' takes time, but once you learn all that can be done in
this immense game, it moves at a frantic - and addictive - pace.
``Outpost 2: Divided Destiny'' (Sierra, $55): Outpost puts a spin
on the alien-bashing space game by turning humans against each
other.
<p>
   The premise is intriguing: With Earth in ruins, a shuttle full
of the last survivors is searching for a new home. Supplies run
low, and they are forced to settle for a planet where deserts,
volcanoes and earthquakes are commonplace.
<p>
   The colonists break into factions. One calls its settlement Eden
and wants to make it as Earthlike as possible; the other calls it
Plymouth and wants only to getenough materials and fuel to go back
into space. You can play either side.
<p>
   Some scenarios call for an invasion on the other colonists, but
most have goals related to the ideals of the colonies themselves.
The scenarios for Plymouth colony deal with rebuilding your
shuttle. One of the keys is to always be on the defensive to make
the other colony wary of attacking you.
<p>
   A vast number of variables demand attention, such as mining
facilities, factories, tools, equipment, food silos and
laboratories to invent new technology. It sounds like a lot to keep
track of, but automatic commands make it easy and fun.
<p>
   ``Outpost'' is engaging despite the lack of carnage. It plays
like ``Sim-City'' in space, except with a plot.

BOOKS: BURNED INTO MEMORY &HT;    By LARRY AYDLETTE
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   BURNING THE DAYS, by James Salter. Random House; 365 pages; $24.
<p>
   Every reader has a writer, the special one, the one you admire
fiercely, the one you suggest only to those rare few who will
understand. It's the literary equivalent of a crush, a swoon. You
see their name on a magazine cover or short story, their new book
on a shelf, and there's a sharp inhalation of breath as your hands
reach out to grab and devour.
<p>
   My obsession with James Salter began in the early '80s after
reading a glowing notice in Esquire magazine. Since then, I've read
almost every short story and book he's written, and for the last 10
years traced the development of this long-awaited memoir through
portions dribbled out in journals and literary reviews.
<p>
   Salter is not just my cult figure, of course, as writers from
Richard Ford to Susan Sontag have joined the bandwagon of praise
for ``Burning the Days.'' These powerfully moving stories about
coming-of-age at West Point, flying combat missions over Korea and
the creation of a second career as filmmaker and literary novelist
may finally grant him the broader audience he greatly deserves.
<p>
   What makes him so special? First off, anybody interested in the
art of pure writing should read Salter. His prose has an unusual
clarity. It's been honed and honed until it gleams. Salter's style
has been compared to Hemingway's manly way with a declarative
sentence, but there's also a luminous quality, a rhythmic
accumulation of lush, photographic detail. He's a grand sensualist.
<p>
   Throughout ``Burning the Days,'' Salter effectively pauses to
capture a dazzling, enveloping moment, as in this scene of a New
York winter:
<p>
   ``Now it is snowing, one of the terrific storms that first mute
and then obliterate the sky. The snow sweeps down, making the
buildings seem like liners at sea, muffling everything with
silence. The streets become white, all the ledges and trees, the
sleeves of overcoats, the marquees. Soon snow has blanketed the
earth and hour after hour still down it comes. The cars with their
headlights are drifting through the whiteness, the buses and
bundled figures struggling home. All night it snows. The city has
never been more intimate, more prodigious.''
<p>
   Salter's book is subtitled ``Recollection'' and that implies a
limit  &MD;  the boundaries of his own reticence. He barely touches on
the death of a daughter. Mistresses and unattainable women are
afforded more attention than wives. The artist defines his world:
``I have written only about certain things, the essential, in my
view. The rest is banal.''
<p>
   Salter grew up in New York, had a relatively privileged
childhood, but his life really begins when he attends his father's
alma mater. The laggard youth chafes, bends and eventually blossoms
under West Point's dictatorial will. He moves on to flying school
in Arkansas, earns his pilot's wings and joins a fighter squadron
in Korea.
<p>
   The 15 years in flight are the heart of Salter's life. To this
day, he has never recovered. In page after page of brilliant prose,
the equal of Saint-Exupery, he recreates those alternating moments
of joy and fear that are the flier's daily existence. From a rookie
crash to tracing the contrails of enemy MIGs, from soaring
evocations of North Africa and the South Pacific to chance meetings
with generals MacArthur and LeMay. The living, his friends, all too
often become the dead. Especially poignant are memories of fliers
Ed White and Virgil Grissom, whose accomplishments stir Salter's
jealousy until their tragic deaths on a NASA launch pad.
<p>
   ``Once at a dinner party I was asked by a woman what on earth I
had ever seen in military life,'' Salter writes. ``I couldn't
answer her, of course. I couldn't summon it all, the distant
places, the comradeship, the idealism, the youth. I couldn't tell
about flying over the islands long ago, seeing them rise in the
blue distance wreathed in legend, the ring of white surf around
them. Or the cities, Shanghai and Tokyo, Amsterdam and Venice,
gunnery camps in North Africa and forgotten colonies of Rome along
the shore. . . . The great days of youth when you are
mispronouncing foreign words and trading dreams.''
<p>
   Salter's post-military years are just as invigorating. He writes
affectionately of both the shabby and chi-chi sides of Paris. There
is a loving portrait of writer Irwin Shaw. There is a sense of
travelogue  &MD;  as meals, countries, hotels, wines and women flow
gloriously by.
<p>
   His great novels  &MD;  ``The Hunters,'' ``A Sport and a Pastime,''
``Light Years''  &MD;  didn't pay the bills, so he also became a minor
screenwriter-director. Once again, he sailed among the beautiful
people: Nureyev, Redford, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate, Winston
Churchill's daughter, John Huston's mistress.
<p>
   It's a long, luxurious life. The book, however, is a little too
long and repetitive in tone. Easily 50-75 pages could have been
lost. You often hunger for specific details, and you wonder what
his family endured while he followed his masculine muse. But like
Isak Dinesen's ``Out of Africa,'' it is his vision, his selection
of memories, that ultimately counts.
<p>
   At the end of ``Burning the Days,'' Salter is walking along a
cold, empty road, his arm wrapped round his beloved Kay. He speaks
of a ``great desire to live on.''
<p>
   You wish it, too. If nothing else, the writings of this unique
American artist certainly will.

THE MAN OF A THOUSAND REVIEWS &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   BOCA RATON, Fla.  &MD;  Leonard Maltin, ``Entertainment Tonight''
film reporter and reviewer, has just suffered through a long, hot
summer of dismal movies. Still, he knows there's no use
complaining, because no one has much sympathy for critics.
<p>
   ``I learned this very early on when I got the job at `ET,'
because people would recognize me and talk to me on airplanes and
in restaurants,'' says the bespectacled, slightly nerdy movie buff.
``And they'd say, as they still do, `You've got the best job in the
world.' And I stupidly would say, `It's a great job, but y'know,
like anything else, it becomes a job.'
<p>
   ``And then I could see that look on their faces. It's like, `You
get paid to go to the movies, and you're complaining about
something? Wait a minute, fella.' I realized they were right.''
<p>
   The New York-born Maltin, 46, now lives in Southern California
with his wife, Alice, and his 11-year-old daughter, Jessica. At the
moment, though, he is out on the road, thumping the 1998 edition of
his ``Movie &AMP; Video Guide,'' a compendium of capsule opinions of
more than 19,000 films, a tome that he's been writing, editing and
revising annually since 1969.
<p>
   The tour is an exhausting grind, and he'd complain, but, well,
you understand.
<p>
   It does allow him to browse the nation's second-hand bookstores
and to visit places he's always wanted to see, like the
International Museum of Cartoon Art, where he serves on its
animation advisory board. Shuttled to the museum following a nearby
radio appearance, Maltin gets a glad-hand welcome and tour from
museum chairman Mort Walker, some celebrity fussing from the staff
and one more interview about the state of the movies.
<p>
   ``I think the past few years have been kind of dismal,'' he
concedes. ``I think the early '70s were a great time for American
filmmaking. It was a time of the emergence of Coppola, Altman,
Scorsese. Then the early '80s, things took a terrible dive.''
<p>
   Luckily and unluckily for Maltin, he was hired by ``ET'' in '82,
after which he could no longer duck the movies he didn't want to
see. ``It's a great gig. You get an opportunity to talk to everyone
you've always wanted to meet and the response from viewers is so
immediate. But now I was actually going to see `Friday the 13th,
Part 3' and things like that. What a dismal time that was,'' he
says, coming dangerously close to complaining again.
<p>
   ``It was around that time that sequel-itis started, when we had
the twos and threes and fours. Plus `Porky's' had been a success,
so we had a spate of gross-out teen movies. And the slasher movie
became a new popular genre.''
<p>
   Maltin watched the industry output improve again in the late
'80s, as the rise of video helped finance a wave of independent
films. But quality is on the decline again, he says, led by the
appalling releases of this summer.
<p>
   ``That anyone could make a film as awful as `Speed 2,' for
instance,'' he grimaces. ``What were they thinking?
<p>
   ``There was a real disaffection among the customers,'' Maltin
points out. ``The fact that they came out of `Batman and Robin'
muttering, feeling that they hadn't enjoyed themselves, that they
hadn't had a good time.''
<p>
   So, will anything change in Hollywood, Leonard? ``I'd like to
think so,'' he says. ``I'm by nature an optimistic person. I think
the problem is (the studios) don't know how. They don't know what
to do.''
<p>
   Although mindless summer blockbusters can raise his anger level
(``I'd set a match to `Con Air' and never look back''), Maltin
continues to have an irrepressible enthusiasm for celluloid. Why
not? Since the age of 15, when he founded, edited and published
``Film Fan Monthly,'' he has been one of the medium's most vocal
and visible boosters.
<p>
   In addition to the ``Movie &AMP; Video Guide'' (and an imminent book
on the golden age of radio), he writes a monthly column for Video
Review, hosts a syndicated radio show about video, has written
and/or edited such popular books on film as ``Of Mice and Magic: A
History of American Animated Cartoons,'' ``Hollywood: The Movie
Factory'' and ``The Great Movie Comedians.'' Those oriented to the
Internet can read Maltin's comments on Microsoft's Cinemania site
(http://cinemania.msn.com). And every now and again, like in
``Gremlins 2: The New Batch,'' he gets to appear on film and play
himself. (Maybe that explains its three-star rating in Maltin's
guide.)
<p>
   Maltin estimates he saw 150 movies last year, but the 1998 guide
added more than 400 releases to its pages, so he works with a team
of reviewers who help him rate the movies. By using several guest
critics, Maltin can maintain a quality control on the thumbnail
reviews of movies he cannot  &MD;  or chooses not to  &MD;  see.
<p>
   Occasionally, but only occasionally, Maltin will revise his
rating of a movie when convinced by his guest panel. ``Not often,
because I don't want to be seen as vacillating,'' he says, but
``sometimes I'll allow myself to be talked out of something.''
<p>
   A case in point is 1992's ``Unforgiven.'' While Maltin admires
the first half of the Clint Eastwood western, he feels ``it just
goes on and on and takes an awful long time getting where it's
going.'' When he gave the movie 2 + stars, ``my co-editors started
beating me on the head.''
<p>
   Maltin reconsidered his opinion. ``It's not that it won the
Oscar, because I gave `Forrest Gump' 2 + stars and I'll stand by
that to my dying day.'' Still, he was persuaded to keep his
``Unforgiven'' review unchanged (``Powerful examination of morality
and hypocrisy in the Old West, but marred by a midsection that
plods''), while bumping the rating up to three stars.
<p>
   Such are the thorny decisions that occupy Maltin's mind. All in
all, he is a man who loves his job.
<p>
   ``Sure, there are things, like maybe you don't feel like going
to see a film that day,'' he says. ``Maybe you had a bad day, maybe
you're tired. Maybe you really want to do something else. Or maybe
you just don't want to see it at all, like the day I had to drag
myself to see `Friday the 13th, Part 3'.
<p>
   ``But it still beats working for a living.''

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks are expected to
rise, snapping a three-day decline, led by Royal Bank of Canada and
other financial institutions on expectations official interest
rates won't climb anytime soon.
<p>
   Rising rates hurt banks and loan companies, in particular, by
discouraging new borrowing by businesses and consumers, while
forcing the financial institutions to pay higher interest on new
deposits.
<p>
   When rates are stable or declining, banks and other
interest-sensitive issues provide equal or better value than bonds
and other fixed-income securities, all of which pay dividends.
<p>
   ``We should open on the plus side with support from bonds as
they inch higher,'' said Katherine Beattie, a technical analyst
with MMS International.
<p>
   The yield on Canada's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 basis point
to 6.31 percent.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after a revised U.S. economic report showed
growth with little inflation.
<p>
   U.S. policy is closely watched by investors in Canada because
the two countries are each other's largest trading partners and any
rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve may be matched by the
Bank of Canada to keep the currency competitive.
<p>
   Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto Dominion Bank and

   The TSE said year-to-date trading value of C$301.3 billion
(US$216.9 billion) broke the full-year 1996 all-time high of C$301
billion, the fifth straight year of record values. Gold issues,

FILM COMMENTARY: George Clooney's smirk problem &HT;    By Dave Larsen
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Call me callous, but I wanted to applaud when people started
getting killed off in The Peacemaker . At least their deaths
finally wiped that self-satisfied smirk off George Clooney's face.
<p>
   Perhaps a second flop following so closely on the heels of this
summer's franchise-killing Batman &AMP; Robin will do the same.
<p>
   Clooney makes a calculated bid for serious action stardom with
this post-Cold War adventure, but he can't seem to play it
straight. Worse yet, he can't seem to play anyone other than George
Clooney.
<p>
   Directed by Mimi Leder  &MD;  who makes a stylish leap to feature
films after winning two Emmys for her work on television's ER , in
which Clooney stars  &MD;  The Peacemaker aspires to be a timely
political thriller in the Clancy tradition. Screenwriter Michael
Schiffer ( Crimson Tide ) gets the boring techno-babble right, but
his convoluted story about pirated nuclear weapons is little more
than a piecemeal string of proven situations in which our hero can
shine.
<p>
   See Clooney's cocky Lt. Col. Thomas Devoe brazenly butt heads
with his beautiful female superior, Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole
Kidman), during a White House briefing. Take bets as to whether
they'll be dating by the movie's end.
<p>
   See Devoe engage the Russian Mafia in a demolition derby through
the winding streets of Vienna. Watch him duke it out with a
power-mad Russian general in the back of a truck teetering on the
edge of a bridge, just like Kurt Russell did in Breakdown , and
dash through Manhattan traffic in pursuit of a mad Bosnian bomber,
like Mel Gibson did in Ransom .
<p>
   See Kelly and Devoe race to defuse a nuclear device before its
timer reaches zero, like about half the action movies ever made.
<p>
   Sorry, but we've seen it all before. Ditto for Clooney's
trademark grin.
<p>
   The film is too unwieldy to follow and too easy to figure out.
<p>
   The Peacemaker 's only redeeming quality  &MD;  apart from an
all-too-brief appearance by Shine 's Armin Mueller-Stahl as a
Russian mole  &MD;  is Leder's tastefully understated direction. Much of
the violence during the film's first half is stylishly suggested,
rather than shown, with the slow-building opening hijack sequence
set to the stirring, somber voices of a Russian church choir.
<p>
   Fast-paced scenes set in military command centers recall ER 's
kinetic atmosphere. Bracing action sequences aboard an armored
Mercedes Benz and a squadron of attack helicopters eventually
deliver on the film's promise.
<p>
   But Clooney and Kidman are playing character types instead of
actual characters  &MD;  he's the brash maverick and she's the woman in
charge fighting to be taken seriously. Their preferred mode of
interaction, of course, is bickering.
<p>
   To his credit, Cincinnati-area native Clooney hasn't followed
David Caruso's bridge-burning path to big-screen failure. While
he's struck out at the box office with From Dusk Till Dawn , One
Fine Day and the aforementioned Batman fiasco, he's remained
faithful to his television following.
<p>
   Despite this latest bomb, he's still got something to smile
about.

   Pippi Longstocking G
<p>
   Poorly animated and laden with the cheesiest songs imaginable,
this slapdash adaptation of Swedish author Astrid Lindgren's
classic children's stories has just enough hooks to snare the
under-6 set. Pippi (voice by 15-year-old Melissa Altro) is a
free-spirited girl who travels the world with her father on a
pirate ship. When Dad is washed overboard during a storm, she
returns to their home on dry land, where she proceeds to sing many
merry tunes. 1 hour, 15 minutes. (DH) Grade: C
<p>
   Scream 2 R
<p>
   Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox are back in this sequel to Wes
Craven's 1996 horror hit. It was filmed partly in Decatur. It's two
years later and Campbell's now in college, but she hasn't shaken
those pesky slashers. Also starring Jada Pinkett and Sarah Michelle
Gellar.
<p>
    &MD;  Opens Dec. 12
<p>
   Shall We Dance? PG
<p>
   An invitation to the dance you don't want to pass up. A 40-ish
Japanese accountant counters his midlife crisis with dance lessons.
Like ``Strictly Ballroom,'' the movie celebrates the life-enhancing
power of the tango. But it's a gentler film, with a liltingly
bittersweet humanity. In Japanese with subtitles. Rated PG for mild
language. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
<p>
   She's So Lovely R
<p>
   Nick Cassavetes directs his late father John's script about a
mentally unstable man (Sean Penn) who, after 10 years, looks for
his former wife (Robin Wright Penn), now married to another man
(John Travolta). The script can be sloppy and lacking in momentum,
but the acting is superlative, full of unexpected humor and odd
grace notes amid the gritty realism. Rated R for violence,
profanity and sexual situations. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (SM)
<p>
   Grade: B+
<p>
   A Smile Like Yours R
<p>
   A limp reproductive comedy. Jennifer (Lauren Holly) spends her
days surprising her construction-worker husband Danny (Greg
Kinnear) to try to make a baby. She starts building a nursery,
without telling Danny about it. She keeps baby toys lying around
the house. We're supposed to think she's adorable, but her baby
obsession puts her in league with Rebecca De Mornay in ``The Hand
That Rocks the Cradle.'' Rated R for language and sex. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (SM) Grade: D+
<p>
   Spawn PG-13
<p>
   Bound to spawn a sequel. Based on a hugely popular comic, this
special-effects-heavy film about a conflicted superhero (Michael
Jai White) is aimed at an audience that takes sensory overload and
narrative chaos as a way of life. It's the ``I Was a Teenage
Frankenstein'' of its time. Rated PG-13 for violence, language and
scary parts. 1 hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
<p>
   Speed 2: Cruise Control PG-13
<p>
   Not up to ``Speed,'' but still well worth the trip. Sandra
Bullock is back in action when she and her SWAT-team beau, Jason
Patric, board a luxury liner that's taken over by crazy Willem
Dafoe, There are plenty of dumb bits, but director Jan De Bont
(``Speed,'' ``Twister'') has a genuine flair for this kind of
witless mayhem. In this movie, the ship really does hit the fan.
And everything else. (ER) Grade: B+
<p>
   Steel PG-13
<p>
   A disgruntled Army metallurgist (Shaquille O'Neal) resigns
because he resents the way a batch of high-tech superweapons has
been used. As a countermeasure, he builds a suit designed to suck
guns, knives, hubcaps and garbage-can lids through the air with an
electromagnet. O'Neal is affable and fun to watch, but ``Steel'' is
a nuts-and-bolts movie in desperate need of a whole new software
package. Rated PG-13 for violence. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (Newhouse
News Services) Grade: C
<p>
   A Thousand Acres R
<p>
   In this beautifully acted adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and, in a
smaller role, Jennifer Jason Leigh play sisters caught up in a kind
of ``King Lear'' of the cornfields. But this is ``Lear'' imploded,
told from the daughters' point of view. Jason Robards is their
imperious father, whose gift of a thousand-acre farm has poisonous
consequences. 1 hour, 44 minutes. Rated R for language and sexual
themes. (ER) Grade: B+
<p>
   Ulee's Gold R
<p>
   Pure gold. Peter Fonda gives the performance of his career in
this quietly lyrical film about a North Florida beekeeper who
struggles to keep his family and his integrity intact when both are
threatened by outside forces. Florida-based filmmaker Victor
Nunez's movie is a home-grown wonder, offering a rare gift of
no-frills redemption. Rated R for language and sexual themes. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (ER) Grade: A

 &UR; IF AMERICANS UNDERSTOOD THE CONSTITUTION THEY'D BE MORE PERFECT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL TAMMEUS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 KANSAS CITY STAR &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   What bad citizens we are, my fellow Americans.
<p>
   A new study says we don't know squat about our Constitution, the
very document that freed us from Ireland and emancipated the
slaves, the core instrument of our market-economy that was divinely
inspired by the apostles and is therefore infallible and inerrant,
except for the parts that had to be amended.
<p>
   We seem to think the Bill of Rights is a political balance to
the Bill of Lefts. For all we know, the Preamble is some kind of
stretching workout we do before walking. Apparently we imagine that
Article III, if any, defines when prime time is on TV. Oh,
brother.
<p>
   The recent study done for the National Constitution Center found
that one-third of Americans think the Constitution mandates English
as the nation's official language, that 16 percent think it makes
Christianity the official religion and that 24 percent cannot name
any of the rights protected by the First Amendment.
<p>
   This just won't do, people. Apparently most of you treat the
Constitution the way you treat the Bible. You keep a copy on your
coffee table but never open it. So you have to guess at what it
says. And most of you guess wrong.
<p>
   Well, it's clearly time for me to pull my copy off my bookshelf
and explain the darn thing to you. And don't think I don't know how
lucky you are to have me around to do this.
<p>
   Now, then. Pay attention. The Constitution begins with the
Preamble, which says we're establishing this fine document ``in
order to form a more perfect Union.''
<p>
   Which is weird. Something is either perfect or it isn't. It
certainly can't be more perfect. The word perfect is like the word
unique. There are no degrees. You can't have something that's
``very unique'' or ``somewhat unique.'' So right in the Preamble
we've got evidence that the Founding Fathers may not have had their
heads screwed on quite right.
<p>
   Still, this grammatical slip doesn't necessarily negate what
follows. So let's press on to Article I.
<p>
   As you can see, articles are counted by Roman Numerals. This
reflects the close ties revolutionary America had with Rome, which
set up several of the early American colonies, such as Rome, Ga.,
Rome, N.Y., and Romania.
<p>
   It's not clear why Thomas Jefferson and Warren G. Harding, who
wrote the Constitution, elected to stick with Roman Numerals
despite widespread evidence that nobody nowadays knows what numbers
C, M or L stand for. Still, this mathematical slip doesn't
necessarily negate what follows.
<p>
   Article I establishes the House and the Senate.
<p>
   Well, now, wait a minute. We're barely into this thing and
already we've turned up two minor mistakes and one whopper. Imagine
all the trouble Congress has caused us over the years. And it could
have been avoided either by not including Article I in the first
place or by having it say: ``No legislative powers herein granted
shall be vested in a Congress, which we've been prescient enough
not to establish and for which you'll thank us later.''
<p>
   Article II establishes the presidency  &MD;  another dubious idea.
Couldn't this work have been subcontracted out to the private
sector, thereby saving us a lot of heartache?
<p>
   Article III set up the courts. Which has led to lawyers. Oy.
<p>
   Why, the more I read in the Constitution the worse it gets and
the more I grasp why nobody reads it any more. And I haven't even
gotten to the annoying First Amendment, which allows people in the
press to make up confusing stuff.

   The Lost World PG-13
<p>
   Steven Spielberg's repeat rumble in the jungle can't top its
predecessor, but it does try to trample it with new `n' improved
dinosaurs. Spielberg still knows how to push our buttons, but a
sequel is a sequel. The original was awesome; this one is, well,

aliens. Bring on the sequel! Rated PG-13 for language and scary

   Mira Sorvino stars as a New York entomologist who teams with a

tinkering with cockroach DNA. Three years later, puppy-size mutant
roaches turn up in the city's water supply. ``Mimic'' is a basic

origins. Rated R for violence, gore and profanity. 1 hour, 40
minutes. (SM) Grade: C
<p>
   Money Talks R
<p>
   Not worth a dime. Chris Tucker and Charlie Sheen play a
small-time hustler and a TV reporter reluctantly teamed against
Euro-trash jewel smugglers. Money talks; b-s walks. So will anyone

<p>
   Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely movie. One of history's odder
footnotes  &MD;  the relationship between the widowed Queen Victoria and

   My Best Friend's Wedding PG-13
<p>
   If you can swallow Julia Roberts as a schemer, you'll have a

who decides to wreck her best pal's wedding plans and steal him for
herself. Rated PG-13 for one use of strong language and brief
sex-related humor. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
<p>
   Nothing to Lose R
<p>
   Not a total loss. Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence  &MD;  the oddest
screen couple of the year  &MD;  star as an ad exec and a car thief,
respectively, who team up to pull a big heist. If there's a
troubling whiff of Hollywood stereotyping going on here  &MD;  Lawrence
is yet another black actor playing a criminal  &MD;  it's leavened by
some solid laughs. Rated R for language, brief sex and comedic
violence. 1 hour, 38 minutes. (DH) Grade: B-

   187 R
<p>
   It's a blackboard jungle out there. And growing worse. Samuel L.
Jackson plays a teacher in an L.A. high school where ``Death Wish''
seems a better survival scenario than ``Dangerous Minds.'' Though
often hyped-up and cliched, the film benefits from Jackson's
portrayal and a fierce desire to show an educational system gone
terribly wrong. Rated R for language, violence and nudity. 1 hour,
59 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-

   Out to Sea PG-13
<p>
   Sails along just fine. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are mildly

   Picture Perfect PG-13
<p>
   A perfectly adorable romantic comedy. To earn a promotion, a
copywriter (Jennifer Aniston) at a New York ad agency concocts a
fake fiance. For all its contrivances, this is one of the few
career-vs.-romance movies to get things right for the '90s. The
picture-perfect supporting cast includes Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr.

   Some harmless broadly comic consciousness-raising. A straight
pizza-parlor employee (Nick Scotti) from the Bronx answers an ad

course, is Warren (Anthony Barrile), a gay white male. Conflicts

   Kull the Conqueror PG-13
<p>
   Originally squirted from the pen of pulp fiction scribe Robert
E. Howard, Kull (Kevin Sorbo) is one of those rippled-pec sword
swingers who has to battle snooty noblemen and tame proud serving
girls. The movie has the smarts to wink at itself, and Sorbo takes
his whole macho image with a big grain of salt. Refreshingly
simple, ``Kull'' comes at the right time, a blast of silliness that
can wash away the taste of some of the summer's more overblown
movies. Rated PG-13 for fantasy violence, mild sexual situations. 1
hour, 36 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
<p>
   L.A. Confidential R
<p>
   Curtis Hanson's exhilarating adaptation of James Ellroy's novel
gives us a 1950s Hollywood in the flush of self-absorption. The
movie spreads its knotted plot among three protagonists: police
chief Dudley Smith (James Cromwell); Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), an
idealistic young cop; and Bud White (Russell Crowe), a terse mound
of muscle Smith uses as his personal henchman. You need to pay
close attention to ``L.A. Confidential'' from start to finish, but
it's a rare pleasure these days to be challenged by a Hollywood
picture. And to be surprised. Rated R for violence, language and
sexuality. 2 hours, 18 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
<p>
   Leave It to Beaver PG
<p>
   Boldly wholesome. Nine-year-old newcomer Cameron Finley plays
Theodore ``Beaver'' Cleaver in this update of the late '50s-early
'60s sitcom. The film brings the Cleavers into the '90s  &MD;  mom June
(Janine Turner) is now more Martha Stewart than Stepford wife  &MD; 
while maintaining a healthy respect for the show's values. And
Finley is cute as the dickens. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour,
28 minutes. (DH) Grade: B
<p>
   Liar Liar PG-13
<p>
   Jim Carrey plays a slimy lawyer whose kid's birthday wish
compels him to tell the truth for an entire day  &MD;  with disastrous
results. Too bad disaster is already happening. Carrey begins the
film at such a high pitch that his supernatural predicament doesn't
make a whole lot of difference. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual
situations. 1 hour, 26 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+

   A hit of a myth. Hercules goes Hollywood in a big way in this

<p>
   A fascinating, uneven look at racial warfare in gangland
Manhattan. Laurence Fishburne is Ellsworth ``Bumpy'' Johnson, a
numbers runner in Harlem during the Depression who runs afoul of
the runty, foul-mouthed Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth). The biggest
problem with ``Hoodlum'' is its ambition. It never quite decides
what story to tell. Rated R for violence and language. 2 hours, 22
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
<p>
   How to Be a Player R
<p>
   In this tawdry comedy, Bill Bellamy, host of ``MTV Jams,'' is
the ultimate ``player'' capable of keeping seven girlfriends going
at once. Natalie Desselle, as his sister, conspires to lure all of
his unwitting lovers to the same party and watch him squirm. ``How
to Be a Player'' doesn't deliver when the laughs are on the line,
and Bellamy doesn't have the charm or wit to carry a feature film.
Rated R for language, sexual suggestiveness. 1 hour, 31 minutes.
(Scripps Howard News Service) Grade: D
<p>
   In &AMP; Out PG-13
<p>
   A neutered comedy about sexual identity. Accepting his Oscar, a
young star (Matt Dillon) hoists the trophy and thanks his old
English lit teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline). ``And,'' he
adds, ``he's gay.'' Problem is, Howard is set to wed his fellow
teacher Emily (Joan Cusack) in a few days. Screenwriter Paul
Rudnick (``Jeffrey'') gives us plenty of one-liners, but the movie
aims for the safest laughs and the blandest worldview. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: C
<p>
   In the Company of Men R
<p>
   Call it a '90s ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' All's not fair in love
and work in this chillingly provocative and malignant comedy of ill
manners. Two 30-ish corporate guys (Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy)
concoct a scheme to pursue, then drop a vulnerable woman (Stacy
Edward) just for the nastiness of it. A bold, disturbing work whose
theme goes far beyond the gender wars. Rated R for language and
sexual situations. 1 hour, 33 minutes. (ER)

 &UR; BLACKSTONE TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF AMERICAN AXLE &AMP; MANUFACTURING &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing
Inc. said Blackstone Group, a New York-based investment bank,
agreed to buy control of the company, a major supplier to General
Motors Corp., for about $650 million.
<p>
   American Axle, which supplies rear-wheel drive axles for GM cars
and trucks, had 1996 sales exceeding $2 billion. GM will continue
to use American Axle as a supplier of drive-line parts. Blackstone
is buying the closely held company from Park Corp. ``We have a
positive view on the sport-utility and pick-up truck business,
which has been gaining market share for some time,'' said Stephen
Schwarzman, president and chief executive of Blackstone. ``GM has
the lowest penetration of any manufacturer in that group,'' giving
it the most room to grow, he said.
<p>
   American Axle chief executive Richard Dauch will continue to run
the company, formed in 1994, when GM sold its axle-making business
as part of a restructuring of its parts-manufacturing division. The
company supplies all of the rear-wheel and four-wheel drive axles
used in GM's pickups, such as the Blazer, Suburban and S-10.
<p>
   Officials at Park weren't immediately available for comment.
American Axle has 8,500 employees at six plants in Michigan and New
York.

   Event Horizon R
<p>
   Event Horizon is the name of a prototype spaceship lost for
seven years somewhere at the boundary of the solar system. It isn't
until members of a rescue mission team are on board that they
discover the ship has been to hell and back  &MD;  or, even worse, a
place beyond hell. Bloody, with lots of big bangs. Rated R for
brief nudity, language and violence. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
(Associated Press) Grade: C+
<p>
   Excess Baggage PG-13
<p>
   Alicia Silverstone, best known as Cher, the dewy-skinned
do-gooder in ``Clueless,'' plays a tough tootsie in this funny and
unpredictable movie. She plays rich girl Emily Hope, who stages her
own kidnapping to goose the affections of her very rich, very
distant father (Australian actor Jack Thompson). Rated PG-13 for
violence, drinking and sex-related dialogue. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(Knight-Ridder Newspapers) Grade: B-
<p>
   Face/Off R
<p>
   The new bullet ballet from director John Woo (``Broken Arrow'')
has to rank as one of the silliest movies to splash across summer
screens. John Travolta plays FBI agent Sean Archer, who swaps faces
(literally) with terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Got that?
The two actors have a great time playing this existential
vaudeville, and they let us in on the film's let's-pretend
extravagance. Rated R for intense sequences of strong violence and
for strong language. 2 hours, 20 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
<p>
   Fire Down Below R
<p>
   A superior Steven Seagal thriller. Something is rotten in the
state of Kentucky. Fish are dying, children are sick. Enter Seagal
as an Environmental Protection Agency marshal named Jack Taggart.
Directed by Felix Enriquez Alcala, this is a smooth blend of
action, character and noble environmental message. Rated R for
language, violence and an incest subplot. 1 hour, 39 minutes. (New
York Times)
<p>
   Grade: B+
<p>
   Free Willy 3: The Rescue PG
<p>
   A whale of a tale. Once again, the same basic plotline  &MD; 
endangered Orca saved by human friend (Jason James Richter)  &MD;  is
embellished with spectacular scenery and credible family conflicts.
This time, Richter teams up with a poacher's young son to save the
you-know-whats. Rated PG for mild violence. 1 hour, 26 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B
<p>
   The Full Monty R
<p>
   Full frontal humor is more the point than full frontal nudity in
this endearing British comedy about unemployed steelworkers who
take on taking it all off as a means to financial stability. More
beanbags than Chippendales, our hunk-challenged ensemble (led by
``Trainspotting's'' Robert Carlyle) offers an engaging
cross-section of damaged male ego and dancing styles. 1 hour, 30
minutes. Rated R for language and nudity. (ER) Grade: B+
<p>
   G.I. Jane R
<p>
   Demi gets her gun and Ridley Scott gets us rooting for her in
this gung-ho action film starring Moore as the first female to be
accepted  &MD;  a relative term  &MD;  into the ultra-brutal Navy SEALS
training program. The movie raises complex issues within an
action-flick framework and Scott pours on the mud, blood and
pouring rain without diluting  &MD;  or overstating  &MD;  his you-go-girl
agenda. Rated R for violence and language. 2 hour, 4 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
<p>
   The Game R
<p>
   Nifty mind games done with slick precision, David Fincher's
(``Seven'') newest bit of flashy nonsense stars Michael Douglas as
a smug zillionaire who signs up with a mysterious agency that
guarantees a ``game'' tailored to each client. The midsection sags,
veering into ``Fantasy Island'' territory, but overall, it's a
tangy paranoia piece. Rated R for violence, language and sexual
situations. 2 hours, 8 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+

   Reviews are by Cox News Service film critics Eleanor Ringel,
Steve Murray and Doug Hamilton (indicated by initials at end of
reviews). Reviews move weekly to clients of the New York Times News
Service.
<p>
   THE RATINGS
<p>
    &MD; 
<p>
   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if
viewed by children.
<p>
   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain material parents
consider inappropriate for young children.
<p>
   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be
inappropriate for preteens.
<p>
   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
Parents are urged to learn about the film before taking children.
<p>
   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.
<p>
   NR: Not rated.
<p>
   Air Bud PG
<p>
   Round ball becomes hound ball in this charming comedy about a
dog who can sink baskets like Michael Jordan. Despite a cliched
plot, the movie gives off a warm glow via the bond between Buddy,
an awesomely expressive golden retriever, and Josh, a morose
12-year-old (Kevin Zegers). Rated PG for mild language and scenes
of animal endangerment. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (DH) Grade: B
<p>
   Air Force One R
<p>
   A bumpy ride  &MD;  in all the right ways. President James Marshall
(Harrison Ford), his family and senior White House staff members
are hijacked aboard Air Force One on their way back from Russia. In
the hands of director Wolfgang Petersen and a pro cast, the film
pulls off its what-if scenario with the sort of adrenalin kick that
``Con Air'' and ``Speed 2'' never even approach. Rated R for
violence. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
<p>
   Batman &AMP; Robin PG-13
<p>
   A candy-colored catastrophe. Director Joel Schumacher's new film
is a throwback to the campy '60s TV show. Only with none of the
fun. It's too expensive, too loud, too thuddingly directed to be
fun. Rated PG-13 for strong stylized action and some sexual
innuendo. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
<p>
   Brassed Off R
<p>
   In Mark Herman's crowd-pleasing charmer, a brass band becomes
the heart, soul and spirit of a close-knit, hard pressed Yorkshire
town faced with the probable closing of the local coal mine. Rated
R for language. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
<p>
   Career Girls R
<p>
   In this modest yet surprisingly tenacious film, two former
college pals (Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman) reunite in
London after six years apart. Mike Leigh (``Secrets &AMP; Lies'') and
his astute cast show us how we use old friends like mirrors,
peering into who they are now to figure out who we are now  &MD;  and
how much is left of the way we were. Rated R for language, brief
sex and nudity. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
<p>
   Chasing Amy R
<p>
   A pair of comic book artists are attracted to one another. One
small snag: She's a lesbian. This is a Gen-X romance that doesn't
seem contrived, complacent or cloned. A savvy rumination on boy
trouble, girl trouble and every possible trouble in between. Rated
R for sex, language and adult themes. 1 hour, 51 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
<p>
   Con Air R
<p>
   Wretched excess. Nicolas Cage does an action-hero Elvis as a
parolee stuck on a plane hijacked by murderous convicts. A stupid,
mindless action flick, with some good actors in it. Rated R for
violence, language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 55 minutes. (ER)
Grade: D+
<p>
   Conspiracy Theory R
<p>
   A lazy, hazy, crazy flick for summer. Nutty New York cabbie
Jerry (Mel Gibson) publishes a newsletter full of crackpot theories
about government cover-ups. Problem is, he appears to be right
about something. Julia Roberts plays a Department of Justice
attorney who helps him elude sinister federal bigwigs. As it tosses
out one conspiracy plot after another, ``Theory'' becomes confusing
without being compelling. Rated R for some violence. 2 hours, 15
minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
<p>
   Contact PG
<p>
   Well worth making contact with. Robert Zemeckis (``Forrest
Gump'') directs Jodie Foster in this adaptation of Carl Sagan's
best seller about the possibility of life on other planets. A
little slow, but also smart, uplifting and well-acted. 2 hours, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
<p>
   Cop Land R
<p>
   Sly Stallone shifts gears as Sheriff Freddy, the paunchy, sweet
lawman of a quiet Jersey town that's home to a number of NYC cops.
But under the placid facade, corruption simmers. Great premise,
great cast (Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro), so-so direction.
Muscled out of the way by his actors, filmmaker James Mangold
becomes the Sheriff Freddy of his own movie. Rated R for violence
and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: B

MEHNDI MAKING MARK AS TRIAL TATTOO &HT;    By HEATHER GRAULICH
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  &MD;  It's a saying that rang true for
bell-bottoms, the Volkswagen Beetle and Tony Bennett: Everything
old becomes new again.
<p>
   But to trace the popularity of an Eastern art of body painting
that is fast becoming a fashion trend in Europe and the United
States, you've got to go back a little further in history  &MD;  about
5,000 years back.
<p>
   Mehndi, the ancient art of painting designs on the skin using
henna dye, has been practiced by women in India, Pakistan, the
Middle East and North Africa for milleniums.
<p>
   Mehndi's modern and well-known devotees include actresses Demi
Moore, Sharon Stone, Mira Sorvino and Liv Tyler, singer Gwen
Stefani of No Doubt and The Artist formerly known as Prince. But
plenty of teenagers and other adventuresome types have latched on
to henna dye.
<p>
   The allure? Unlike tattooing and piercing, mehndi lets you be
hip without the pain  &MD;  or the commitment. Mehndi designs are
applied with nary a needle in sight and wear off in one to three
weeks.
<p>
   Women in India and the other countries wear mehndi designs
traditionally for weddings, holidays and other special occasions.
They paint their hands and feet with intricate geometric and floral
patterns using a greenish paste made from henna leaves. The paste
is squeezed onto the skin from a cone that resembles a cake
decorator and allowed to dry. After a few hours, the paste flakes
off, leaving a reddish brown stain.
<p>
   In India, one custom holds that a bride's mehndi conceals the
name of the groom somewhere in the design. On the wedding night,
the groom then has the romantic task of tracing the designs on his
new wife's hands and feet, searching for his name.
<p>
   ``When you dress up and offer your prayers and have your hands
and feet painted, it's a good thing,'' said Rahila Vayani of Boca
Raton, Fla., who wore mehndi at her own wedding in Pakistan last
year.
<p>
   Vayani moved to the U.S. a few months ago, bringing with her a
knack for computers and a talent for applying mehndi, a skill she
learned through a class in her native country.
<p>
   Here, she quickly got a job as a software engineer for Auto
Nation in Fort Lauderdale. She practices mehndi on friends and
family for special events. But her talent could turn profitable  &MD; 
as long as the mehndi craze lasts.
<p>
   ``I haven't started it as a business,'' she said. ``But I might
be looking forward to.''
<p>
   That's because tattoo parlors and hair salons that now offer
mehndi (it also can be spelled mehdi or mehandi) charge as much as
$60 per application.
<p>
   Sue Hawkins, an owner of Outrageous Tattoos in West Palm Beach,
plans to begin offering mehndi later this month and charge $50 an
hour for the service, although most designs take 15 minutes or
less. She is importing henna supplies from England, including a
part-synthetic black henna dye that provides a darker design than
traditional henna.
<p>
   ``(Mehndi) gives people another option,'' Hawkins said. ``With
permanent tattoos, you have to be over 18. Also, people can decide
if they like it.''
<p>
   In other words, mehndi can work like a trial tattoo  &MD;  a way to
test drive body art before taking the permanent plunge.
<p>
   Artistic types can even try their own hand at mehndi. Indian
grocery stores often carry commercial henna paste in disposable
tubes that cost a few dollars and come with instructions, although
this type can fade faster than the freshly-mixed formulas most pros
use.
<p>
   Vayani said watching mehndi go mainstream only reinforces
something women in her country have believed for ages.
<p>
   ``It enhances your beauty.''

HOME AND GARDEN &HT;    A FALL AND WINTER CALENDAR OF HOUSE AND GARDEN CHORES
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   By JAMES CUMMINGS
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   DAYTON, Ohio  &MD;  Signs of approaching winter are popping up all
over:
<p>
   Squirrels are storing nuts, trees are shedding leaves, beavers
are building dams and homeowners are washing storm windows.
<p>
   Instinct drives the squirrels, trees and beavers to get their
fall chores done, but Mother Nature may not remind you when it's
time to inspect your fireplace.
<p>
   Following is a checklist of things you may need to do before the
ground freezes and is buried under a foot of snow.
<p>
   We suggest you post these pages where you'll see them regularly
for the next couple months.
<p>
   We've arranged the tasks in more-or-less chronological order,
but in most cases the best time to do a job lasts at least a couple
weeks.
<p>
   September Aerate, dethatch and fertilize your lawn as needed
during the next couple weeks. Sow seed or plant sod to cover bare
spots in the lawn. If you plant seed, remember you'll need to water
the young grass plants faithfully until they become firmly
established. Have a professional inspect and service the furnace.
When the heating season starts, it gets harder to schedule visits
from technicians. Fail to have an inspection and you can find
yourself without heat the first time you try to turn the furnace
on. Begin a compost pile to accept leaf litter and other yard
debris later in the fall. Inspect weatherstripping and replace as
needed. When two components of the outside shell of the house move
in relation to one another  &MD;  windows in their sashes, doors in
their frames, vents  &MD;  you may need a flexible barrier to seal the
edges where they meet. Inspect storm windows and doors. Replace
broken window panes early so you'll have time to wash and paint
them, if needed, before putting them in place when the weather
becomes consistently cold. Plant and transplant evergreen trees and
shrubs. Maintain watering for trees and plants that are still in
their growing season. Service your fall and winter power tools.
Change the oil and get new spark plugs for your gas-powered leaf
blower, snow blower, chain-saw or other tools you'll be using
during the next few months. Take down hummingbird feeders and store
them until spring. Also remove standing water from birdbaths. Check
perennial beds for dead leaves and stalks and remove them carefully
so you don't disturb the bulbs. Dead annuals can be removed, roots
and all, for composting. Have a professional inspect the fireplace
and sweep the chimney if you plan to burn wood this year.
<p>
   October Caulk outside while daytime temperatures are moderate  &MD; 
about 50 to 75 degrees. You should check along all seams where
components of your house meet  &MD;  around windows, doors and
foundations, along soffits, etc.  &MD;  and replace worn caulk so all
gaps are filled. Tour the house outside and inside looking for
places rodents and other pests might enter. Rats and mice are most
likely to infiltrate houses when outdoor temperatures drop. Prepare
flower beds for next spring and plant perennials. Keep leaves raked
to avoid smothering the lawn. If you're using a mulching mower to
chop up leaf litter, you may need to run it two or three times a
week. Clean gutters and inspect the roof after the first heavy leaf
fall. If your roof is 15 years old or older, look for signs that it
needs to be replaced. You may have to clean the gutters again after
the last leaves around your property have fallen. Stock bird
feeders. Some people don't feed birds during the summer months. If
you're a winter-only feeder, late October to early November is a
good time to start. If you buy bird seed in quantity, store the
excess in metal containers to protect it from squirrels and other
rodents. Check the insulation between heated and unheated portions
of the house. Adding insulation to an attic floor or above an
unheated basement or crawlspace is one of the most cost-effective
energy projects. October, when attics usually are cool enough to
work in, is a good time for the project. Install storm windows and
doors when the weather is cold enough that you're using your
furnace most days. If you don't have storm windows, you may need to
install temporary plastic storm windows. Plant deciduous
(leaf-shedding) trees after the other trees in your area are bare.
You may also prune many woody plants at this time of year, but
check with a professional on how your particular type of tree or
shrub should be handled. Update the heating-system thermostat. If
you don't have one, consider a programmable thermostat that will
turn the setting down during the hours when you're usually sleeping
or away from home. They're fairly inexpensive, easy to install and
save money and energy. Check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
and change the batteries if needed. This chore is usually done on
the day Daylight Savings Time ends, which is Oct. 26 this year.
<p>
   November Turn off your outdoor water supply and disconnect
hoses. If you have an automatic sprinkler system, all the water
should be blown from the pipes by now to prevent freezing damage.
Prepare the swimming pool for winter. Turn on the humidifier.
Dayton-area winters tend to be cold and dry, so you may be more
comfortable in cold months if use a humidifier to add moisture to
the air. Signs that it's time to increase humidity are static
electricity build-up, dry skin and throat and dry leaves on house
plants. Cut your grass to about 2 inches in the last mowing of the
year. Remove any remaining gasoline from the lawn mower and store
it in a dry place until spring. L Clean, lubricate and store all
summer gardening tools such as hedge clippers and hoes. Organize
the garage and other storage areas. Throw away things you won't be
able to use next spring and add shelves, baskets and hooks to put
tools, chemicals and other supplies away neatly. Check the gutters
for leaf litter even if you cleaned them earlier. Also check
gutters and downspouts for leaks and make any necessary repairs.
Guy-wire sapling trees to protect them from winter wind and snow.
Carefully store all garden and lawn fertilizers and pesticides in
clearly marked cotainers and place them out of the reach of
children. Store liquids where they won't freeze.

COMMENTARY: ARMED AND NERVOUS: THE GUN THAT WOULDN'T GO AWAY &HT;    By DOUGLAS KALAJIAN
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   I don't hate guns or people who own guns. I just don't want one.
And I'd never have owned one except for a series of odd
circumstances that led Harry the cop to put one in my hand as I was
about to get into a taxicab.
<p>
   Which is how I wound up armed, if not particularly dangerous, on
a train ride from New Jersey to Florida.
<p>
   The oddest thing about this series of events is that it began in
a place I've never seen, seven years before I was born: Germany,
1945. That's when my father captured the German general.
<p>
   As my father told it, this was not a dramatic event.
<p>
   Knowing the war was lost and the Russians were on the way,
German soldiers were surrendering at a furious rate to any
Americans they could find. The general spotted my father, a
sergeant, leading a patrol through the woods. And that was that.
<p>
   My father was not the sort to collect souvenirs, but he kept the
general's binoculars and gun for more than 40 years. He gave me the
binoculars some years ago, and they still work perfectly. The gun
sat in a drawer until it was time for my father to move to Florida.
<p>
   I'd forgotten all about it until I was helping him pack. I had
seen the gun a thousand times when I was a kid and my father kept
it in the cabinet in the back of his dry cleaning store. His
instructions then were clear: don't ever touch it; don't ever touch
any gun unless you're prepared to kill someone.
<p>
   His words left a permanent impression, stronger than all the
bloody news stories I've read or covered. I've never been able to
think of guns as sporting equipment, like fishing rods or golf
clubs. My palms sweat when I get close to one.
<p>
   In fact, I followed my father's rule and never touched a handgun
until I was 36 years old, when my hand fell on the general's 9-mm
automatic while I was cleaning out my father's bureau.
<p>
   ``This can't come with us,'' I announced. My father understood
that the gun had to go.
<p>
   But go where? How do you get rid of a gun?
<p>
   You don't just throw a gun in the garbage or leave it for the
movers or give it to the neighbors. Or do you? The gun stayed in
the drawer while we gave the problem some thought.
<p>
   Two drawer-dumping, clothes-folding and box-sealing days later,
we had not arrived at a solution. Not until we were midway through
dinner at the Tom Sawyer Diner.
<p>
   That's when my father spotted Harry, longtime local police
officer and gun fancier. My father waved him over and described
both the gun and the problem. Harry said he understood, but he
didn't.
<p>
   Harry assumed my father didn't want to take the gun to Florida
because it was too big for a 76-year-old man to carry.
<p>
   ``I'll get you a smaller gun,' he said.
<p>
   I tried to explain my feelings, but Harry looked at me as though
I had proposed leaving my father alone in the desert without food
or water.
<p>
   ``Florida is dangerous,'' Harry said. ``He needs a gun and you
need a gun.''
<p>
   We argued for a long time. Actually, I argued and Harry
lectured. I thought I finally made him understand that he could
have my father's gun as a gift. Harry said he'd stop by in the
morning and pick it up before we left for Florida.
<p>
   Harry arrived as my father and I stood, bags packed, waiting at
the front door. I handed him the gun and a box of ammunition. The
taxi pulled up as we were talking.
<p>
   As I reached out to shake Harry's hand, he pressed a .32-caliber
revolver into my palm. It was much smaller, much lighter and,
because it was so handy, even more frightening than the general's
gun.
<p>
   ``You'll thank me,'' Harry said. He jumped in his car and drove
away as the impatient taxi driver beeped his horn. Panicky, I
shoved the gun into the right side pocket of my jacket and didn't
touch it until we got to Florida. It was a long time before I could
laugh at the mental picture of my father and me as a couple of
Amtrak desperados, packing heat.
<p>
   So, 24 hours after I thought I solved the problem, I had simply
moved it 1,200 miles to my house. Not wanting to think about it, I
put the gun in my own bureau drawer and tried to pretend it wasn't
there.
<p>
   But Harry wasn't entirely wrong about Florida. Four years later,
our house was burglarized. Luckily, we weren't home. The gun was
among the many items taken.
<p>
   I thought about it a lot for a while. I still do from time to
time.
<p>
   I wonder if it's been used to kill anyone.
<p>

   To get the most flattering pedicure, specialists at the Babor
Institutsay you should consider the shape of your feet and toes, as
well as skin tone. A few tips for great looking feet:
<p>
   Most narrow feet can handle any color and shape. But for those
with very long nail beds, a French pedicure can break up the length
of the nail.
<p>
   Wider feet look best with slightly longer nails, which visually
elongate the feet. ``When you have wider feet, you really shouldn't
do anything that draws attention, like painting stars on your
toes,'' says Ilse Chamberlain, general manager of the Babor
Institut.
<p>
   Those with blue undertones in their skin look best in colors
that also have a bit of blue: pinks, burgundy, cherry. Warmer
colors, such as coral, brown and earth tones, flatter people with
yellow skin undertones.
<p>
   Just as a very thin woman can wear almost any fashion trend,
``little bitty feet can handle just about anything,'' when it comes
to pedicures, says Chamberlain. For fall, she recommends using
darker tones, maybe with a bit of shimmer.
<p>
   When in doubt, classic red is universally flattering.
<p>
   Most of us are just minutes away from a natural pedicure of
sorts: Walking barefoot on the beach exfoliates and softens the
feet.

<p>
   Launching your boats . . .
<p>
   There's more to barefoot waterskiing than skidding across the
water at warp speed. `People have this idea that to barefoot you
have to be going 70 miles an hour,' says David Harris, general
manager of Mike Seipel's Barefoot International Water Skiing
Lessons in Lantana. `But at that speed, the friction from the water
on the sole would literally burn your feet.' Most people need a
pull of between 30 and 40 mph (though a very large person with very
small feet would probably need a few miles-per-hour more) and
practice, practice, practice.
<p>
   O-sole-o-peeeeuuuu . . .
<p>
   Approximately 250,000 sweat glands reside in a pair of feet and
they excrete as much as a half-pint of moisture each day, making
them the second sweatiest part of the body. First place honors go
to  &MD;  no surprises here  &MD;  the underarms; third place to the back,
chest and forehead. If your feet are particularly offensive, bear
this in mind: some unlucky soles simply have a genetic
predisposition to foot odor. Clean, dry feet tucked into clean,
absorbent socks should help.
<p>
   Barefooters: Tired of shoddy treatment . . . Do you think of
shoes as ``unnecessary ballast?'' Prefer ``tough, callused soles,
and even think it's cool when they get dirty''? Think policies
against bare feet stink? The Dirty Sole Society (whose members
swear it's ``not a `sex thing' or a dating service'') is the club
for you. Contact it on-line at www.barefooters.org.
<p>
   Too much time on his feet . . . While on line, you can also
mingle with one John Doppler, an interesting fellow whose stated
goal involves bringing prehensile toes back into human evolution.
``With the growing complexity of keyboards . . . and pull-tabs on
beer cans, I feel that a mere 10 fingers will be insufficient to
meet the appliance needs of the future,'' he writes. (And you
thought the 'Net was a just a device to catch weirdos.)
<p>
   Amazing feets . . .
<p>
   Irish writer Christy Brown, portrayed in the 1990 Oscar winner
My Left Foot wrote and painted with, well, his left foot. Athletes
who compete barefoot include former 5,000-meter world record holder
Zola Budd, American pole-vaulter Desha McNeal Beamer, NFL place
kickers Tony Franklin and Rich Karlis and India's national field
hockey team.
<p>
   The foot bone's connected to . . . Each human foot consists of
26 bones, 33 joints, 107 ligaments and 19 muscles. The 52 bones in
your feet make up about one-quarter of all the bones in your body.
And the skin on the soles is the thickest on the body, three times
thicker than the skin on the palms, 15 times thicker than facial
skin.
<p>
   On their toes . . . Ballet Florida went through 80 to 100 pairs
of toe shoes during last year's 10 performances of The Nutcracker.
That's at least one pair per dancer per performance. And these
aren't Payless pumps: Each pair costs between $65 and $70.
<p>
   Foot men . . . Actor Eddie Murphy detests skanky feet on women.
On a talk show a few years ago, he implored female viewers to take
care of their feet, even incorporating his bias into his movie
Boomerang. And legend has it that Elvis Presley liked women with
well-groomed digits. Former members of The King's entourage have
said a girl needed clean fingernails and toenails before she could
romp with Presley in the Jungle Room.
<p>
   Big foot . . . The biggest feet in The Guinness Book of World
Records belong to Matthew McGrory of Pennsylvania, who wears size
26 shoes: that's approximately 17 inches long. NBA star Shaquille
O'Neal wears a mere size 22, about 15 + inches long.
<p>
   But we're right behind you, Matt . . . Shoe industry honchos are
hush hush about average shoe sizes  &MD;  something about marketing
secrets  &MD;  but who needs them? Bowling alley owners say feet are
indeed getting larger. What size shoes wear out the quickest? Used
to be women's sizes 6 to 7 + and men's size 9. These days, women's
sizes 8 + to 9 and men's sizes 10 to 10 + are replaced most often.
<p>
   Foot faults . . . As a general rule, women are more likely to
get corns; teenage and adult males to get athlete's foot. Foot
infections, corns and ingrown toenails affect about 5 percent of
the U.S. population each year; 6 percent experience bunions, flat
feet and fallen arches. As income increases, the prevalence of foot
problems decreases, according to the American Podiatric Medical
Association.
<p>
   These feet were made for walkin' . . . The average person takes
8,000 to 10,000 steps a day and walks 115,000 miles in a lifetime,
according to the American Podiatric Medical Association. That's
more than four times the circumference of the globe.
<p>
   You only think it's your feet you hate; it's really your life .
. . Everyone hates their feet (though plenty of folks love other
people's feet; more about that later). A common source of foot
embarrassment, shoe sellers report: a second toe that's longer than
the big toe. Then it's bunions, followed by nail disorders, says
Tim O'Brien, manager of the Village Bootery shoe stores. But too
much focus on the feet can indicate something deeper is afoot.
Debbie Then, a California psychologist who specializes in body
image, says women in particular will obsess about their feet as a
way of avoiding larger issues in their lives. ``Symptom
substitution,'' it's called.
<p>
   They keep growing and growing . . . Toenails grow faster in your
teens, in hot weather and during pregnancy. Feet also lengthen,
widen and flatten with age and the fat padding on the bottom of the
feet erodes. Older folks should have their feet measured each time
they buy shoes.
<p>
   Good news for Dirty Sole Society members . . . Contrary to
popular belief, driving barefoot  &MD;  at least in Florida  &MD;  is legal.
Most states tolerate naked feet on the pedals, though California is
a notable exception.
<p>
   The podophile: searching for a sole mate . . . A ``phantom toe
sucker'' in Yorkshire, England, tripped women for a chance to sniff
and kiss their feet. In San Francisco, a college was up in arms
about a midnight prowler dubbed ``the toe licker.''
<p>
   A hidden camera caught a Trump aide  &MD;  ahem  &MD;  worshiping the
shoes Marla Maples walked in. Fergie fell in with a toe man. And a
call girl let it slip that political bigwig Dick Morris loved the
taste of her toes.
<p>
   Little scientific research has been done about foot and shoe
fetishes, but sexperts say they're the most common form of fetish
and almost entirely the domain of men  &MD;  both gay and straight.
<p>
   ``We don't know why men are attracted to the female breast or
why women are attracted to men's butts,'' a professor at the
Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San
Francisco told a Los Angeles newspaper. ``But my feeling is when we
figure that out, it will also explain men who love women's shoes
and feet.''

<p>
   Longevity magazine calls them our ugliest body part. And for the
most part, the magazine is correct. Think Fred Flintstone soles,
ankles as fat and pasty as marshmallow fluff, knobby-knuckled
digits built more for extracting clams from silty shores than
running up an attractive dinner partner's calf.
<p>
   But Ellen Sirot has pretty feet. So pretty, in fact, that in
every sense they support her.
<p>
   Sirot, 32, is something of a Naomi Campbell in the unusual world
of parts modeling. For possessing appropriately tapered toes,
pleasingly curved arches and slender, shapely ankles, Sirot's size
7s can earn her between $200 a day and $300 an hour. Her feet are
currently ``the face'' for Peds and they have appeared in national
magazines and ads.
<p>
   ``Really, I never knew I had this special gift,'' jokes Sirot,
who stumbled into the profession quite by accident. Her big break
came seven years ago, when Dr. Scholl's chose her feet over 50
pairs, many much more experienced than her own. Sirot says she
quickly became ``the No. 1 foot person.''
<p>
   It's a dubious honor for the Barnard College graduate. Sirot
initially sought work in commercials and advertising (``using my
whole body'') to support her first love, modern dance. A
photographer suggested she try leg modeling, but then an agent
booking a sneaker ad paid her a compliment she had never heard
before: ``You have perfect feet.''
<p>
   ``I was introduced to this whole world I never knew about,''
Sirot said. ``Parts modeling.''
<p>
   In seven years, she has appeared, from the ankles down, in
magazines from Allure to Vogue. And clients from Avon and Sally
Hansen to those making antifungal nail treatments have paid her
bills.
<p>
   Although Sirot may strike a pose in stilettos, in real life it's
strictly thick socks and one-size-too-big sneakers. Even on her
wedding day, she wore lace tennis shoes with bows.
<p>
   Each night she slathers her feet in Neutrogena hand cream or
Vaseline petroleum jelly and tucks them into plastic bags. The few
times she's required to wear fashionable shoes in her personal
life, she swears by Peds and a toe protector from her podiatrist.
<p>
   ``If I go to a black-tie event, I'll wear my big huge sneakers
until I'm inside the front door and then I'll change,'' she says.
She also makes sure a cab is waiting close by when she's ready to
exit.
<p>
   Of course, New York City cab drivers are notoriously
uncooperative. So for those times, it's nice to have a strong guy
around.
<p>
   ``I have been known to make my husband carry me.''

   GETTING A TOE-HOLD ON PEDICURES
<p>
   Has sidebars: FOOT-PEDICURE-TIPS, FOOT-FACTS, FOOT-MODEL
<p>
   By NICOLE PISCOPO
<p>
   c. 1997 Cox News Service
<p>
   Never date anyone who doesn't have a pedicure, Ilse Chamberlain
told her son when he asked for advice on women.
<p>
   ``It means a person takes care of the minor details,'' explains
Chamberlain, general manager of the Babor Institut in Palm Beach,
where pedicures and all manner of beauty treatments are standard
fare.
<p>
   Whether lovely feet really reveal savory aspects about character
has yet to be proven. But this much is true: In recent years, we've
really grown to fawn over our feet.
<p>
   We pamper them to the tune of more than $50 million a year:
peppermint foot lotions, herbal foot baths, avocado foot scrubs,
sea salt foot gels. All designed to soften them, pretty them,
invigorate and de-peeeeeuuuuuu them.
<p>
   And there's a big fashion focus on feet right now. Fall's
hottest shoes are tendon-straining stilettos, tottery ankle boots
and skimpy, strappy sandals. That's right, sandals. They usually
disappear after Labor Day, but this year, designers want us
flaunting toe cleavage well into winter.
<p>
   This bodes well for South Florida, where we've never quite
warmed to furry boots. But it also means you can't stuff your boats
into loafers and neglect them 'til spring. (Especially if you want
a date with Chamberlain's son.)
<p>
   With that in mind, here are some fascinating foot facts  &MD;  and
useless trivia  &MD;  to help you better understand your little piggies.
<p>
   High heels  &MD;  the arch enemy?
<p>
   In 1996, just 18 percent of women wore high heels when
entertaining at home, down from 28 percent in 1986, according to
Dr. Scholl's and the American Podiatric Medical Association. And
these days, 31 percent of women surveyed consider a shoe with a
one-inch heel to be a ``high heel.'' In '86, only 18 percent would
consider a shoe that low to be high. So will women wear fall's
towering stilettos? Probably. They may be bad for the feet, but
they make the calves look really buff.
<p>
   Footnotes
<p>
   The foot has long left its imprint on art and literature.
Leonardo da Vinci called the foot ``a masterpiece of engineering
and a work of art.'' Frank Zappa penned an ode to feet. A character
in a J.D. Salinger story blew his brains out shortly after a
confrontation over his feet. And a John Updike short story features
a man enraptured by a female tennis player's ``sharp, small
anklebones and metatarsal tendons.'' Meanwhile, the ultimate
tribute to feet, ``The Foot Book'' by Dr. Seuss, has been reprinted
55 times since it was first published in 1968.
<p>
   Cruel shoes
<p>
   Until early this century, uppercrust Chinese girls endured foot
binding, a painful, crippling procedure with an unusual goal: a
foot, states one historian, that could fit inside a man's mouth
(presumably her husband's, thank you.) Chinese moms would consult
astrology to determine when the foot binding ritual would begin  &MD; 
usually when the girl was between the ages of 3 and 8, according to
``Shoes: A Celebration of Pumps, Sandals, Slippers &AMP; More.'' The
mother would then groom the child's nails, bend the four toes back
over the arch leaving the big toe free and bandage them up. After
each bath, the bandages were tightened and the foot forced into
smaller and smaller shoes. The ideal? A rare ``golden lotus,'' a
foot just 3 inches long. (Proud husbands would display a wife's
tiny, elaborately embroidered shoes on a small plate.) The reality?
Stunted feet that made walking difficult, and wandering impossible,
of course.

   Buenos Aires, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Prices for farm and ranch
lands in Argentina have risen as much as 70 percent this year as
investors snatch up real estate to take advantage of the country's
meat, grain and oilseed boom, Clarin reported. A U.S. decision
earlier this year to lift a ban on fresh Argentine beef sent prices
for cattle ranching land soaring. In some areas, prime land used
for corn cultivation doubled in price in two years to $4,500 per
hectare (2.47 acres).
<p>
   Actor Sylvestor Stallone reportedly purchased a second ranch in
the pristine Patagonia region, adding to the 14,000-hectare ranch
he already owns in southwestern Argentina, a local official said
yesterday.

   Eden, North Carolina, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Pluma Inc. said it
expects third-quarter per-share earnings to decline as much as 60
percent because of continuing textile production and shipment
delays.
<p>
   The maker of activewear under ``Pluma'' and other brands said it
expects earnings to be 50 percent to 60 percent lower than the
year-ago quarter's. It said revenue is expected to be $37 million
to $39 million.
<p>
   In the 1996 third quarter, Pluma earned $2.7 million, or 51
cents, on revenue of $39.7 million.
<p>
   Wall Street expected Pluma to earn 51 cents for the current
quarter, unchanged from a year ago, based on the average estimate
of three analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Shares of the Eden, North Carolina-based manufacturer, which
went public at $12 a share in March, fell 1/8 to 13 3/8 yesterday.
The shares are expected to fall when they begin trading today.
<p>
   Pluma's customers include Nike Inc., Starter Corp. and Walt
Disney Co. as well as retailers which purchase its branded apparel.
It said problems in production and shipments that occurred in the
second quarter continued in the third.

   Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Armstrong World
Industries Inc. said it launched legal action in an Ontario court
to prevent the purchase of Domco Inc. by Germany's Tarkett AG.
<p>
   Armstrong's motion will be heard by the Ontario Court (General
Division) on Oct. 29. The legal action relates to a lawsuit filed
in June against Sommer Allibert SA, which owns 69.2 percent of
Montreal-based Domco, for breach of fiduciary and other duties to
Domco's minority shareholders.
<p>
   Paris-based Sommer agreed in May to sell its worldwide
floor-covering business to Tarkett for 955 million deutsche marks
(US$565 million) in cash and debt. A month later, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania-based Armstrong bid C$488 million, or C$23 a share,
for Domco to strengthen its North American floor-covering business
and stop Tarkett from gaining a foothold in the U.S. and Canadian
markets.
<p>
   Armstrong shares rose 1/4 to 66 1/4 in early New York trading.
Domco shares, which have not traded today, fell C$0.30 to C$16.75
in Montreal yesterday.

 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Stockholm, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Sweden's ICB Shipping AB and
Norway's Frontline Ltd. spent $500 million buying oil tankers this
week, twice their combined 1996 sales, betting freight rates will
continue to rise after a four-year slump ended in 1995.
<p>
   The spree started Sept. 1, when Frontline made an unsolicited
$426 million bid for ICB, and was rejected. ICB tried to block the
bid Thursday by agreeing to buy Astro Tankers from Greece's
Angelicoussis family for $309 million in assumed debt and new
shares, diluting Frontline's 31 percent voting stake and leaving
the Greeks with 30 percent of the voting shares.
<p>
   The fighting over ICB presages other attempts to build market
share as booming economies worldwide boost demand for oil, forcing
transportation charges -- and shippers' profits --higher.
Concentration also reduces competition in an industry where even
the largest company, Singapore-based World-Wide Shipping Group, has
just 3 percent of available capacity.
<p>
   ``This opens up the possibility of new mergers,'' said Arne-Egil
Roenning, a shipping analyst at Den norske Bank in Oslo. ``It could
have a very positive effect on shipping companies' earnings, which
have been poor so far during the 1990s.''
<p>
   John Fredriksen, Frontline's 51-year-old chairman, isn't relying
on ICB to help him reap the benefit of growing demand. On Monday
Frontline bought London-based London &AMP; Overseas Freighters Ltd. for
$117 million. And on Wednesday Fredriksen spent $130 million of his
own money buying a 6-tanker fleet from Greek shipowner Yannis
Latsis.
<p>
   While the acquisitions make ICB and Frontline bigger, more
efficient competitors in an increasingly profitable market,
analysts say, they raise the companies' exposure to a potential
decline in rates when tankers ordered this year are delivered in
1999.
<p>
   With its Angelicoussis acquisition ICB will be the world's
second-biggest tanker company, controlling 5.2 million deadweight
tons, or 2 percent, of the world's total tanker fleet of 280
million deadweight tons.
<p>
   ``It is aggressive,'' said Stephen Y.K. Pan, chairman of
World-Wide Shipping Agency Pte, which manages privately owned
World-Wide's ships. ``All I can say is next year will be quite
good. Longterm, the fundamentals are good, provided the shipyards
don't start producing ships like sausages.''
<p>
   The slump that ended in 1995 was caused by an oversupply of
ships and more short-hauling of oil from the North Sea to Europe.
Tanker rates are only now returning to levels they enjoyed eight
years ago: about $30,000 a day for a very large crude carrier, or
VLCC, on average this year, says Richard Stokes, shipping analyst
at Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in Singapore.
<p>
   VLCCs, which hold more than 200,000 deadweight tons, were
charging as much as $50,000 a day this summer, up from a low of
$15,000 in 1994, Stokes says. He sees rates at $40,000 in 1999.
<p>
   Demand should be stable and may even rise if Japan's economy
recovers or Southeast Asia's currency turmoil ends, he said.
<p>
   After 2000, he says, rates will decline because 35 new VLCCs are
due for delivery in 1999, following 16 in 1998 and four in the
second half of this year. He recommends buying shares of Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co. and holding Hanjin Heavy Industries Co. and
Samsung Heavy Industries Co.
<p>
   Even aging, dry-docked ships are being readied for relaunch.
Fredriksen bought six ultra large crude carriers, or ULCCs, from
Latsis, including the second-largest tanker vessel in the world,
Hellas Fos. ULCC construction stopped 10 years ago because of the
limited number of ports the 300,000-plus ton carriers can use.
<p>
   Investors are already anticipating improved earnings for
shippers.
<p>
   Frontline shares have gained almost 35 percent since they were
listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on July 7. ICB has soared 49
percent in the past six months. Sweden's Argonaut AB, Nordstroem &AMP;
Thulin AB, and Norway's Bergesen ASA all gained more than 40
percent in the same period.
<p>
   While most tanker stocks trade at net asset value, Frontline is
trading at a 30 percent premium and ICB at a 10 percent premium,
says Cato Hellstenius, shipping analyst at Handelsbanken markets,
who has a hold on both stocks.
<p>
   Roenning still recommends accumulating tanker shipping stocks
even after their strong rally.
<p>
   With the 20 largest firms owning only half of the world's
tankers, these companies aren't likely to stay out of the flurry of
acquisitions for long.
<p>
   The immediate returns can be great. In Singapore, Osprey
Maritime Ltd. acquired 4 VLCC tankers as part of its $750 million
purchase of Gotaas Larsen Shipping Corp. in May. The ships, bought
for $62.5 million, are already worth about $70 million, says W.I.
Carr's Stokes.
<p>
   ``You can expect more of the same will happen,'' says Erling
Strom, director of Osprey Maritime. ``People feel that if you want
to be a really serious player and have an impact, you have to have
a big fleet.''

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies with shares that are moving in Canadian markets today.
The stock symbol is given in parentheses after the company name.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. (CSN CT) rose as much as C$1.75 (US$1.36) to C$32.25
as the Ottawa-based software developer said growth over the next
few quarters may slow because of competition from the Internet.
Like other software makers, Cognos fell victim to a perceived
threat from the Internet as investors worried that its customers
may buy software from rivals that offer ways to get similar
information over the World Wide Web. Joseph Farley, an analyst with
UBS Securities in New York, rates the shares a ``strong buy'' with
a 12-month target price of US$39 (C$54).
<p>
   Franco-Nevada Mining Corp. (FN CT) rose as much as C$0.65 to
C$30.95 after it was rated ``accumulate'' by analyst Michael
Jalonen of Midland Walwyn.
<p>
   AGF Management Ltd. (AGF/B CT) climbed as much as C$4 to C$66, a
52-week high, after the fund manager reported third-quarter net
income of C$11.3 million, or C$0.84 a share, up from C$5.8 million,
or C$0.47 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to C462.5 million from
C$47.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (GOU CT) jumped as much as C$0.40 to
C$13.50, a 52-week high, after the company said it will price the
initial public offering of its Gulf Indonesia Resources Ltd. unit
on Monday, then list the shares the next day on the New York Stock
Exchange. The 21-million-share offer is expected to be priced
between US$17 and US$21 a share.
<p>
   Northern Telecom Ltd. (NTL CT) rose as much as C$1.10 to
C$145.35 after analyst Timothy Luike at Lehman Brothers reinstated
the telecommunications-equipment maker as ``outperform.''
<p>
   Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT CT) rose as much as C$0.75 to
C$104 after analyst Brian Dunning of CIBC Wood Gundy rated the
fertilizer producer's shares a ``strong buy''.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose as bonds
recaptured some of yesterday's loss on signs of growth with little
inflation.
<p>
   Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co., General Motors Corp. and
Eastman Kodak Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher.
Kodak rose 1 3/8 to 63 13/16 after announcing it would fire about
10 percent of its general workforce and 20 percent of its managers,
in a move to boost profits.
<p>
   The Dow industrials shot up 71.22 to 7919.23, little changed on
the week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 5.43 to 943.34,
led by bank, drug and oil shares.
<p>
   Falling bond yields make stock investing more attractive and
bolster companies profit outlook by cutting borrowing costs. Banks
in particular benefit from lower interest rates, as their profit
margins temporarily widen.
<p>
   Stocks may be stuck in a narrow band without further gains in
the bond market, investors said.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis
points to 6.36 percent, about where it was on Monday.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 9.71 to 1115.67
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting possibly
weaker-than-expected earnings for the current quarter.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 6 1/2 to 27.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, said
it could report a loss of 12 cents to 18 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the
year-ago period. Bridgeport fell 1 to 10 1/2.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 2 1/4 to 56 5/16 after saying it
expects third-quarter earnings of about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected, and
declined 7/16 to 19 3/4.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, said it expects third-quarter
earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less than the
year-ago 51 cents a share, citing production and shipment delays.
Trading was delayed.
<p>
   Darden Restaurants Inc., which operates the Olive Garden, Red
Lobster and Bahama Breeze chains, reported profit a penny better
than the average estimate of 15 cents. Darden rose 11/16 to 11.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 4
1/4 to 25 3/4, after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its investment
rating to ``neutral.'' Cymer has fallen 43 percent in September on
concern growth is slowing.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Leona Helmsley sold her
controlling stake in Helmsley-Spear Inc., one of New York's largest
commercial property managers, to her late husband Harry's two main
business partners for $500,000.
<p>
   The move ends a long dispute between Leona, dubbed the ``Queen
of Mean'' by New York tabloids for her treatment of employees, and
the partners, Irving Schneider and Alvin Schwartz and comes three
months after she said she would start selling her interests in
properties valued at $5 billion.
<p>
   Real estate executives said legal disputes between Helmsley and
the partners could hamper her ability to sell the properties, which
are owned through a string of more than 100 partnerships set up by
Harry Helmsley and various associates.
<p>
   Helmsley's interests up for sale include the master lease on the
Empire State Building, office buildings, apartments and a string of
Midwest motels.
<p>
   Helmsley, who served 18 months in federal prison for tax
evasion, inherited the properties from her billionaire husband
Harry Helmsley who died in January at age 87. Leona is in her late
70's and has no heirs.
<p>
   The fighting began three years ago when Schneider and Schwartz
sued Leona claiming they are due almost $6 million in back pay
relating to their work for Helmsley-Spear, once one of the biggest
real estate companies in the U.S. Leona, in turn, launched her own
lawsuits against the two and others.
<p>
   The disputes have been blamed for holding up money that would be
better used for badly needed renovations of the Helmsley
properties. Developer Donald Trump and his partners, which own the
Empire State Building, have been trying since 1995 to get the
courts to wrest control of the master lease from Helmsley and
others by charging they neglected the buildings' physical
condition.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Heating oil fell amid
expectations that large U.S. inventories of distillate fuels, that
include heating oil, are sufficient to meet demand for home heating
during the coming month.
<p>
   U.S. inventories are ample at a time when cooler weather is
expected in key consuming regions in the U.S. Northeast and
Midwest, which is likely to boost demand for heating fuels.
<p>
   Earlier this week, the American Petroleum Institute reported
that distillate inventories rose 1.568 million barrels to 134.6
million barrels, exceeding year ago levels by 22.2 million barrels.
Home heating oil inventories held by major oil companies are 31
percent higher than a year ago.
<p>
   ``Fundamentally there's no reason to see heating oil higher,
there's so much oil that people are running out of storage
facilities,'' said Abe Glass, a trader at Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg in
New York. ``We've never been this over-supplied. There are more
than 20 million more barrels of distillates than a year ago --
that's a lot of oil.''
<p>
   Heating oil for October delivery fell 0.31 cent to 56.20 cents a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Elsewhere, soybeans are seen steady amid robust export demand
and cocoa fell as west African harvests begin. Coffee also rose.
Before the Chicago grain and livestock markets opened, the
Commodity Research Bureau index was down as much as 0.45, or 0.18
percent, to 242.54, while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index fell as much as 0.27 point, or 0.13 percent to,
202.79 points.
<p>
   Soybeans are expected to hold steady after exporters yesterday
sold 206,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to an unknown
destination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported, signaling
strong demand for crops.
<p>
   Delivery is for the 1997-98 marketing year, which began on Sept.
1. Yesterday, the department reported the sale of 102,500 tons to
an unnamed buyer.
<p>
   Soybean export sales for the week ended Sept. 18 totaled 636,200
tons, up 4 percent from the previous weeks, the USDA weekly sales
report showed yesterday.
<p>
   Soybeans for November delivery are expected to open little
changed from $6.345 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
<p>
   Cocoa prices fell amid speculation that cocoa crops in West
Africa, in the early stages of harvest, were less damaged by
persistently dry weather since July than previously thought.
<p>
   Speculation that less of the crop grown in the Ivory coast and
Ghana will be lost, boosted expectations for a large crop, traders
said. The bulk of harvesting won't take place until November. Last
year, the Ivory Coast produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa and
estimates for this year's crop range from 850,000 tons to about 1.2
million.
<p>
   In other growing regions, including Indonesia, weather
conditions remain dry, escalating concerns that some of the crops
will be damaged. Last year, Indonesia, produced about 310,000 tons
of cocoa.
<p>
   December cocoa fell as much as $16 to $1,687 a metric ton on the
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.

 &UR; CARPENTER TO ACQUIRE TALLEY INDUSTRIES FOR $312 MILLION &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Carpenter
Technology Corp. said it agreed to buy Talley Industries Inc. for
$312 million in cash and assumed debt to get Talley's stainless
steel production and distribution operations.
<p>
   A dissident group of Talley shareholders objected, saying the
offer was inadequate and that Carpenter was ``bottom fishing'' for
a cheap acquisition.
<p>
   Carpenter will pay $12 a share for Talley common shares, $11.70
a share for its series A preferred and $16 for series B preferred.
The cash portion of the transaction is about $185 million.
<p>
   Carpenter wants Talley's stainless steel production and
distribution businesses, which already are a supplier to Carpenter.
``Our five-year outlook required us to seek out more manufacturing
capacity,'' said Robert Cardy, Carpenter's chairman and chief
executive.
<p>
   The acquisition will hurt its earnings in the current fiscal
year ending June 30, 1998, but will help earnings in subsequent
years, Carpenter said.
<p>
   Talley shares rose 13/16 to 12 1/4, their highest level in a
decade, in early trading on the news. The stock's average price was
about $7.40 in the last five years. Carpenter shares rose 11/16 to
47.
<p>
   Talley said the offer represents ``an attractive premium'' over
its average stock price in the last several years. But a dissident
group of Talley shareholders called the offer inadequate.
<p>
   ``The breakup value of the company, we believe, is significantly
higher,'' said William Danzell, a leader of the dissident
shareholders, who control 10.3 percent of Talley's common stock.
<p>
   Danzell said his group will oppose Carpenter's bid. The group
forced Talley's former chief executive, William Mallender, to
resign in June.
<p>
   In its statement, Carpenter said a majority of Talley's shares
must be pledged in favor of its offer by Oct. 30 for the
transaction to proceed.
<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania-based Carpenter makes stainless steel and
titanium alloys. Its revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 was
$939 million. Talley's stainless steel production and distribution
businesses generated $136.3 million of its total $502.7 million in
revenue last year.
<p>
   Talley, based in Phoenix, also makes inflation devices for air
bags, welding equipment and power supply systems, and provides
engineering advice to shipbuilders. In a statement, Carpenter said
those businesses would be sold after the acquisition is completed.
Credit Suisse First Boston would help find buyers, the company
said.
<p>
   Carpenter added it expects its earnings per share for the fiscal
first quarter ending Sept. 30 to be between 75 cents and 80 cents,
in line with analysts' expectations. For the same quarter last
year, the earnings per share totaled 45 cents.

<p>
   Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S.
investors will pay about $10 billion in mutual fund-related taxes
in April, or about double what was paid last year, according to an
estimate by Vanguard Group.
<p>
   For fund investors, higher taxes aren't necessarily bad news
because it means they're making more money in the financial
markets. Still, some industry executives criticize fund managers
for not being as diligent as they could be about keeping their
shareholders' tax bills lower than they are.
<p>
   ``The fact is taxes have a hugely negative impact on relative
returns,'' said John Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group, the
nation's second-biggest fund company. The overall tax bill for fund
investors will rise because the markets ``are a lot higher, and
equity funds have about 30 percent more money than they did last
year,'' Bogle said.
<p>
   Among the steps fund managers can take to limit capital-gains
taxes for their shareholders is by holding stocks for longer
periods than they now do, Bogle said.
<p>
   ``Twenty years ago, portfolio turnover averaged 30 percent;
today it averages nearly 100 percent,'' Bogle said. Investors who
want to reduce their tax bills should look for ``low-turnover''
funds, he said.
<p>
   A fund's turnover rate -- the pace at which the portfolio is
buying and selling securities -- is disclosed in the prospectus and
in financial statements mailed to shareholders twice a year.
<p>
   Mutual funds usually reveal in December the dividend and
capital-gains distributions that they're going to make for that
year. An investor who buys the fund today will have to pay the full
year's tax tied to these distributions, even though the year is
almost over.
<p>
   The Internal Revenue Service said its net U.S. tax collections
totaled about $1.38 trillion last year.

The Georgian port where he picked up his load will not let him take

   VERKHNY LARS CHECKPOINT, Georgia  &MD;  Eldar Porolashvili has been
stranded here on the border between Georgia and Russia since
mid-July, sleeping in a truck with 10 tons of raw alcohol for
making vodka.
<p>
   Russia will not let him cross the border. The Georgian port
where he picked up his load will not let him take it back. And
Porolashvili, who will not be paid until he delivers his goods,
does not have enough money or gas for a return trip even if he
wanted to try his luck.
<p>
   He is not alone. At least 100 other truckers are stuck in this
narrow canyon, caught in the middle of a feud between Russia and
Georgia over vodka and money. They are parked in a milelong line
along the road, as well as in tunnels and in clusters down by the
riverside.
<p>
   ``We play cards, and sometimes dominoes,'' said Porolashvili,
who is 46. ``I just brought some bread and cheese from the store
about two kilometers away. We don't have the money to pay, but they
give us credit. We are trading in debts.''
<p>
   Behind the gridlock is a political battle that highlights the
difficult relations between Russia and the other former Soviet
republics. Georgia and other republics still depend on Russia for
trade and military help. But the countries also view one another
with mistrust and suspicion, and their strategic interests have
grown further apart.
<p>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who is counting on Russian
vodka to generate about 5 percent of his Government's revenues, has
vowed to block imports of raw ethanol, which Russian bootleggers
mix with water to make cheap vodka substitutes. But President
Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia wants to re-establish his country as
the center of a new ``Silk Route'' for traders between Europe and
Asia.
<p>
   And pure alcohol has been a big source of traffic along the
route. Until July, when the barriers went up, about 800 trucks a
month were carrying spirits from Georgia's main port on the Black
Sea to unauthorized Russian distilleries.
<p>
   The standoff has crystallized in this spectacular mountain pass,
which has long been a chokepoint between Russia and Georgia. In
1921, less than two dozen Georgians, perched on the cliffs,
repelled an army of several thousand Russians invading through the
canyon.
<p>
   Now it is the Georgians who are stuck. Just two weeks ago the
gorge was home to nearly 1,500 idled truckers, many of whom turned
around and some of whom bribed their way through.
<p>
   But the conflict endures. Drivers sleep in their trucks and wash
with water that pours out of a hose next to the river. Some cook
meals on open fires. Occasionally, they give each other breaks to
head into a nearby town, guarding their friends' trucks while they
are gone. Every few days, they telephone the companies that ordered
their shipments, waiting for the companies to bribe or finesse
their way past the Russian border guards.
<p>
   They also worry. Two truckers were killed as they ate breakfast
last month, hit by a cascade of falling boulders. Now winter is
coming, and this region, also a popular ski resort, typically gets
buried under many feet of snow that usually set off more avalanches
down the cliffs.
<p>
   In July, Russian border guards began to enforce a tough new law
restricting alcohol imports. Russian officials say they were
alarmed by both declining sales of authorized vodka and by the
country's high death rate from alcohol poisoning.
<p>
   Russia's tax revenues have slumped 45 percent this year, to
about $85 million, the government says. Russian distilleries that
make raw alcohol are operating at about 45 percent of capacity. But
unauthorized producers of moonshine have been thriving, bottling
bootleg spirits that range from bad vodka to outright poison. These
cost as little as $1.50 a bottle  &MD;  about half the price of even
low-quality authorized vodka.
<p>
   ``If people spend their money on vodka, the money should go to
the treasury and not to swindlers,'' Yeltsin said in a recent radio
address. ``We have resolutely determined to turn off the tap of
spirits smuggling.''
<p>
   Though Russian officials freely admit that their part of their
goal is simple protectionism, the health hazards of toxic liquor
are a real problem.
<p>
   Last June, 22 people in the Siberian town of Krasnoyarsk died
from drinking bootlegged spirits containing methyl alcohol as well
as traces of acetone, a toxic industrial solvent. Victims began
showing up at the hospital emergency room complaining of heart
palpitations and dizziness and then went into fatal convulsions.
Stories of smaller poisoning cases pop up every few weeks in
Russian newspapers.
<p>
   Georgia does not itself produce alcohol. But it is the main
entry point for alcohol that is exported to Russia from Europe, the
United States, and Canada.
<p>
   Shevardnadze, who was the Soviet Union's foreign minister under
Mikhail Gorbachev, has set out to transform Georgia into an
economic corridor to Asia. The government has beefed up its rail
lines, its airport at Tbilisi, the capital, and its shipping
terminals at the Black Sea port of Poti. And it has formed a
trading alliance with other Central Asian countries along the old
Silk Route used by spice traders centuries ago. That alliance is
getting financial support from the European Union  &MD;  and Russia is
not a member.
<p>
   Shipping raw alcohol to Russia fits squarely within this plan,
Georgian officials say. ``We are not an alcohol-producing
country,'' Mikhail Ukleba, Georgia's deputy foreign minister, said
in an interview. ``We are a transit state, and as a transit state
we are obligated to accept goods that are shipped with proper
documentation. Alcohol is not a banned good, like munitions or
weapons or narcotics.''
<p>
   Thus far, negotiations between the two countries have failed to
produce any compromise. In a show of pique, Shevardnadze pointedly
refused to come to Moscow's huge 850th anniversary celebration this
month.
<p>
   Because of treacherous mountain terrain and civil war, there are
no alternative land routes from Georgia to Russia. And even this
road, between Tbilisi and the border, is a wreck. Many miles are
nothing but gravel and rubble, and even large trucks must
continually weave around gaping potholes and breaks in the road.
The average speed along here is less than 40 miles per hour.
<p>
   When winter arrives, even this passage will be treacherous  &MD;  and
far too cold for people to live in their trucks. ``There has
already been snow on the mountains,'' said Vazha Odizhvili, who has
been waiting here for two months.
<p>
   Georgia's border guards say the checkpoint is only open a few
days a week in the winter. Besides heavy snow and cold, the winter
also brings a cascade of minor avalanches  &MD;  boulders heavy with
snow that break loose and tumble down the cliffs.
<p>
   However absurd it seems to simply camp out here, truckers who
remain figure this is their best bet. Faced with the choice between
no pay if they dump their loads and go home, or the possibility of
pay if they endure a bit longer, they choose to stay.
<p>
   ``There is no place else to go,'' said Kochi Hurdze, 30, a
trucker from the Georgian city of Kutaisi. He has not seen his wife
and four children since early July. Nor has he been able to send
any money back to them.
<p>
   ``They're taking in a lot of debts now,'' he said.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia  &MD;  It's always something, though
rarely has it ever threatened the peace along the world's longest
undefended border or amounted to much more than Canada and the
United States getting on each other's nerves.
<p>
   These days, however, the list of peeves, slights and
cross-border squabbles has grown unusually long. And that has left
Canadians feeling bruised and bewildered by their closest ally.
<p>
   Tough new restrictions for crossing the border have Canadians
hopping mad. Trade conflicts over milk and magazines have rattled
Ottawa. Canadians are profoundly disappointed by the failure of the
United States to sign the land mine treaty, a Canadian-led move
viewed here as a national accomplishment all but spoiled by
American stubbornness.
<p>
   And then there is the deepening conflict over Pacific salmon,
which reached new lows in Canadian eyes when President Clinton
recently threatened in a letter to use the might of the United
States to retaliate against protesting Canadians.
<p>
   ``What's going on here?'' asked The Globe and Mail of Toronto in
a front-page analysis of the cross-border lack of bonhomie. ``Now
they want us to get `smart cards','' was the snarly headline
splashed across the cover of The Province of Vancouver, referring
to a computerized card that Canadians would need under a new
American immigration law. Even the normally cautious Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation scheduled a sober look at the
deteriorating state of relations between Canada and the United
States.
<p>
   Of course, compared with past disagreements over the Vietnam War
(Canada opposed it), relations with Cuba (Canada pursues them), and
foreign investment (Canada once tried to keep Americans out),
current troubles seem like little more than another family feud.
<p>
   So why are Canadians so upset?
<p>
   Diplomats, whose job it is to insure that small incidents do not
grow into big ones, say a certain measure of irritation is
inevitable in a longstanding international relationship like that
between the two former British colonies in North America.
<p>
   ``When you have a long border like ours,'' said Georges Rioux, a
spokesman at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, ``fish cross it,
lumber crosses it, people rub elbows and sometimes disagreements
happen.''
<p>
   But Professor Stephen Blank, a specialist in Canada-United
States relations at Pace University in New York, says current
tensions run far deeper.
<p>
   ``Canadians see the United States as a rough neighbor that is
likely to get rougher,'' he said. As the two countries are drawn
ever closer by free trade agreements, the $1 billion a day in
commerce that crosses the border makes eggs, milk, and almost every
product or service a potential point of conflict.
<p>
   And then there is Canada's habitual crisis of self-confidence,
which Blank said is whipped by the ``deep uncertainty of Canadians
about what is happening to their own country.''
<p>
   Indeed, the recent cross-border conflicts all seemed to deepen
during the same week that Canada reopened its long-running and
ever-painful domestic debate about national unity and the
separatist movement in Quebec.
<p>
   As Quebec leaders were defiantly rejecting the latest peaceful
overtures from English-speaking Canada, a surprisingly harsh letter
from President Clinton to a senator from Alaska over the salmon
issue was made public in Washington.
<p>
   ``I want to assure you that we have made clear to Canada how
seriously we view the action against the M/V Malaspina,'' he wrote,
referring to the Alaskan passenger ferry that was blockaded for
several days last July by angry Canadian salmon fishermen to
protest what they say is overfishing by Alaskans.
<p>
   Clinton then warned that another incident like the blockade
would ``necessitate our taking appropriate countermeasures.''
<p>
   The threatening note from the leader of the free world angered
fishermen like Kim Olsen of Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia, one
of 195 Canadian fishermen who are cited in a suit by the state of
Alaska, which is seeking to recover damages caused by the blockade.
<p>
   ``It's all just so frustrating,'' he said. ``They try to make it
look like they're the heroes and we're the bad guys.''
<p>
   In some instances, the Canadians seem fired up by their own
language. Last July, Prime Minister Jean Chretien was caught by an
open microphone boasting to European leaders: ``I like to stand up
to the Americans. It's popular. But you have to be very careful
because they're our friends.''
<p>
   The premier of British Columbia, Glen Clark, regularly uses such
words as ``piracy'' and ``fish stealing'' when referring to the
actions of U.S. fishermen who go after salmon that the Canadians
say belong to them.
<p>
   ``From time to time, for political considerations on each side
of the border, and for genuine interests that are divergent, these
things are not resolved necessarily by polite encounters,'' Clark
said. ``One would wish they would be but they're not always.''
<p>
   Canadians were deeply disappointed that the United States would
not sign the treaty banning land mines, a favorite project of the
Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy. But that feeling,
however strong, was nothing compared with the reaction to a new law
that would force Canadians to fill out immigration documents or
have a registered ``smart card'' every time they cross the border
beginning next September.
<p>
   The focus of the new law was tracking noncitizens who cross the
Mexican border, but Canadians, who have historically crossed into
the United States by the millions without filling out forms, were
not specifically exempted.
<p>
   Congressional leaders assured Canadian officials last year that
the new law would not bother most Canadians. But a year went by
without an amendment introduced.
<p>
   Last week, in his first official meeting with reporters since
becoming the new U.S. ambassador to Canada, Gordon Giffin tried to
soothe Canadian nerves about the rash of international irritants.
``In virtually every instance, we have the same goal in mind,''
Giffin said. ``Sometimes it just takes a little effort to get
there.''
<p>
   But even without that assurance, some Canadians think they can
see past the latest round of international chest-beating and right
into the heart of the Canadian-American relationship.
<p>
   ``They are not going to shake us down, rough us up, or make us
wait in 17-hour traffic jams,'' wrote Pete McMartin, a columnist
with the Vancouver Sun. ``They are going to let us cross the border
as easily as if we were crossing the street, not because we share
the world's longest undefended border with them and we're the best
of neighbors, but because they believe in the God-given right of
Canadians to visit their glorious republic and spend large sums of
money there.''

   Johannesburg, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- South African bonds
rallied after the World Bank's sale of rand-denominated zero-coupon
bonds helped stimulate demand and weaker-than-expected U.S.
second-quarter growth buoyed the U.S. market.
<p>
   South Africa's most actively traded government bond, the R150
due 2005, rose as much as 3/8 to 91 1/2, adding 3,750 rand to the
value of a 1 million-rand bond. The yield dropped as many as 7
basis points to 13.88 percent, matching Monday's low yield, which
was the lowest since February 1996. The bond last traded at 13.9
percent, down 5 basis points.
<p>
   Bonds fell earlier today on the heels of yesterday's weakness in
U.S. bonds.
<p>
   ``Our bond market strengthened before the U.S. numbers,'' said
Neil Marsden, a trader at Coronation Asset Management. Traders said
some of the demand arose as a result of the World Bank's sale of 2
billion rand of bonds due 2017 as people sought to minimize the
risk associated with the issue.
<p>
   Banks who've sold non-government bonds they don't own to
investors sometimes buy government bonds. That's to guard against a
rise in bond prices, filling the gap left by the sales with bonds
which will mirror any shift in market prices.
<p>
   South African bonds got a further boost when U.S. bonds held
their gains after the U.S. gross domestic product report suggested
inflation isn't a threat.
<p>
   ``The U.S. numbers were slightly better so our bonds went a
little bit better,'' said Marsden.
<p>
   Bonds will likely be influenced Monday by the release of August
figures on borrowings by households and companies, known as
private-sector credit extension, and on the M3 money supply for
last month. The two reports have an important influence on monetary
policy.
<p>
   Economists estimate annual growth in credit extensions slowed to
14.6 percent in August from a preliminary 14.78 percent in July.
They estimate annual M3 money supply growth, which also will be
released on Monday, slowed to 13.2 percent from a preliminary 13.36
percent, according to Bloomberg News surveys.
<p>
   ``I think the market is expecting those numbers to come off
again,'' said Bryan Smither, director in bonds at Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell. ``I expect a rate cut by the end of October but we have
to wait to see September figures.''
<p>
   Nick Barnardt, chief economist at ING Barings, said he expects
both M3 and credit grew faster than the consensus forecasts, partly
because of strong retail sales in August and because the growth is
being compared with a low base in August last year.
<p>
   If credit growth exceeds 15 percent and M3 growth surpasses 14
percent, ``I think a rate cut could be postponed until next year,''
Barnardt said.
<p>
   The rand strengthened to 4.6805 per dollar from 4.6950
yesterday, as the U.S. currency fell against the deutsche mark and
yen, traders said.
<p>
   ``It's all on the back of the dollar. The dollar is down and
that's reflecting on the rand at the moment,'' said Dave Sadler,
chief trader at First National Bank Holdings.

   Monterrey, Mexico, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Grupo Financiero
Serfin SA, Mexico's third largest banking group, put its
warehousing unit up for sale in an effort to raise money to shore
up it finances, El Norte reported, citing a bank spokesman. The
sale will also allow the bank to concentrate more on its banking
business, the newspaper said. The warehousing unit has assets of
about 100 million pesos ($12.8 million) and consists of eight
warehouses in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Queretaro, El
Norte said.
<p>
   Serfin this week completed the sale of 49 percent of its
insurance unit, Seguros Serfin SA, to Lincoln National Corp. for
$85 million.

<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- General Electric
Co. and Sea Containers Ltd. said they'll combine their
container-ship operations to cut costs and increase profits.
<p>
   The joint venture, to be called GE SeaCo Services Ltd., will
operate one of the world's biggest fleets of marine-freight
containers, with 1.2 million of the metal boxes and depots around
the world.
<p>
   The main motivation for the venture is cutting costs. Sea
Containers and GE's container business began talks more than two
years ago with an eye to reducing the combined $100 million that
they spend annually on fixed costs, said Jim Sherwood, president of
Sea Containers.
<p>
   ``By amalgamating these two fleets, we can save a lot of money
and restore the profitability that existed a few years ago,'' said
Sherwood, who will be chairman of GE SeaCo.
<p>
   Sea Containers Class A shares rose 1 3/8 to a three-year high of
27 3/8, while its Class B shares rose 1 9/16 to 27 7/16.
<p>
   Hamilton, Bermuda-based Sea Containers derived most of its
profit gains in recent years from its passenger-ship operations.
Earnings in its container division fell to $16.5 million in the
quarter ended June 30 from $18.5 million for the quarter ended
Sept. 30, 1996, amid stiff competition and falling lease rates.
<p>
   Under the agreement, GE's GE Capital Services unit and Sea
Containers will form a 50-50 joint venture that will lease both
companies' containers at a price designed to cover annual
depreciation and interest on the underlying book, or accounting
cost, of the containers.
<p>
   GE Capital will receive 70 percent of any profit and Sea
Containers 30 percent in a formula based on last year's profits,
Sherwood said. The two companies will split profits from additions
to the fleet, including $200 million in containers GE SeaCo plans
to buy next year.
<p>
   GE Capital also will buy $10 million in newly issued Sea
Containers Class A shares and $15 million in a new issue of 7.25
percent preferred shares, convertible into Class B common shares.
<p>
   Sea Containers plans to use the investment from GE Capital to
redeem its outstanding $2.10 cumulative preferred shares, series
1982, totaling $27.6 million.
<p>
   Sea Containers moves mostly specialized cargo in containers. GE
Capital's ships, which are based in San Francisco, are focused more
on standard dry cargo and refrigerated containers.
<p>
   Sherwood said GE SeaCo will be able to make much better use of
Sea Containers' freight depots, greatly increasing profitability.
The two companies haven't decided whether to
include Sea Containers' container factories in the joint venture,
he said. The new company's board will have eight directors, split
evenly between representatives from GE Capital and Sea Containers.
GE Capital is the big financial services unit of Fairfield,
Connecticut-based General Electric Co. Sea Containers also operates
passenger ferries and rail lines, and owns and operates several
hotels.
<p>
   GE shares closed down 1 3/4 at 66 7/8.

<p>
   Baltimore, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Larry Puglia believes in
durable stocks -- not companies that make refrigerators or
dishwashers that last, but stocks that will themselves stand up for
the long haul.
<p>
   So when the manager of the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund
finds a stock he likes, he buys shares and holds them, usually for
a long time.
<p>
   Puglia's search for stocks he thinks will do well over time is
leading the portfolio manager to some of America's biggest
companies, including AlliedSignal Inc., Pfizer Corp., First Data
Corp. and Travelers Group Inc. The average holding period for
stocks in Puglia's fund is more than three years, about triple the
industry average.
<p>
   ``We want companies that have leading market positions,
outstanding managements and strong financial fundamentals,'' Puglia
said. ``Ultimately, we've defined `blue chip' stocks as those that
have sustainable and durable earnings growth.''
<p>
   Blue chip stocks are generally the ones that have led the U.S.
market's charge for most of the past three years, and Puglia's fund
has benefited from the surge.
<p>
   The T. Rowe Price fund has quadrupled in size this year to $1.9
billion, with investors attracted by the strong performance. The
fund ranked No. 41 of 426 ``growth'' stock funds tracked by
Bloomberg Fund Performance over the past three years, rising at an
annual rate of 29.54 percent for the period ended yesterday.
<p>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' Puglia said. ``There are still
some high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuation
levels.''
<p>
   Using six criteria, here's a look at whether T. Rowe Price Blue
Chip Growth Fund makes sense for your investment portfolio.
<p>
   The T. Rowe Price fund looks for companies reporting annual
earnings growth of 15 percent, sometimes higher depending on the
industry, and companies that are generating high returns on equity,
Puglia said. Companies that do both can buy back shares, make
acquisitions and take other steps to boost shareholder value.
<p>
   In the financial industry, ``we like Travelers and Freddie
Mac,'' Puglia said. ``In the pharmaceuticals, Pfizer has been a
strong performer.''
<p>
   One stock the fund purchased recently was Merck &AMP; Co. ``We were
buying shares when the stock was in the low 90s,'' Puglia said. At
that level, Merck's shares were trading at about 20 times next
year's earnings. That compares with Coca-Cola Co. shares that are
priced at more than 33 times earnings. Merck shares closed 2 1/8
lower yesterday at 99 1/8.
<p>
   Safeway Inc., the supermarket chain, is another stock on
Puglia's radar screen. Safeway's earnings are benefiting from its
purchase of Vons Cos. earlier this year and the company should be
able to generate about $400 million in free cash flow next year,
Puglia said.
<p>
   ``While some are perennially optimistic about the market, we're
perennially cautiously optimistic,'' Puglia said.
<p>
   The U.S. equities market is trading at ``rich'' valuations,
Puglia said. In the aggregate, stocks are expensive, trading at
about 12.5 times operating cash flow, which is earnings plus
depreciation, he said.
<p>
   The other concern is most investors expect the inflation rate to
stay low, leaving little room for unpleasant surprises, Puglia
said. ``There's always the chance inflation will emerge and
interest rates will rise,'' he said. ``If that happens, the U.S.
market would be susceptible to a fall.''
<p>
   The T. Rowe Price fund's ranking isn't top tier this year. The
fund placed No. 443 of 660 growth stock funds tracked by Bloomberg

   Puglia, 37, joined Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price after
graduating with a master's in business administration from
University of Virginia's Darden School of Business.
<p>
   Puglia has been involved in managing the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip
Growth Fund since its inception in June 1993.
<p>
   Before going to business school, Puglia, a Pittsburgh native,
was a senior manager with Peat Marwick Main &AMP; Co., where he
specialized in banking.
<p>
   Management fees and operating expenses for the T. Rowe Price
fund are 1.01 percent, or $10.10 for each $1,000 invested. That's
below the average 1.42 percent for diversified U.S. stock funds,
according to Morningstar Inc.
<p>
   As with most mutual funds, people should be aware of the tax
consequences. T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund made taxable
capital gains and income distributions totaling 22 cents a share
last year.
<p>
   The T. Rowe Price fund is appropriate for retirement plan
investors because it invests in what are considered some of the
most-established companies in the U.S., Puglia said.

   Houston, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- American Rice Inc. and its
Comet Rice Ingredients Co. unit were sued by the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission on Thursday for discriminating
against disabled workers, the Houston Chronicle reported. The
government agency accused the companies, both units of Erly
Industries Inc., of using X-rays to identify workers with back
abnormalities and refusing to hire them as permanent employees even
though some already worked at American Rice plants through a
temporary staffing service. American Rice's lawyer, John Richards,
said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans has declared
that the inability to do heavy lifting isn't a disability covered
by federal anti-discrimination laws, the newspaper said.
<p>
   A state court jury in Houston on Sept. 10 ordered Erly and its
chairman, Gerald Murphy, to pay $18 million to investors who
accused Murphy of backing out of a commitment to finance a
real-estate development.

   Mexico City, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Grupe SA, the parent
company of Mazatlan's Cid Mega Resort, plans an initial sale of
shares in order to repay debt and expand, Reforma reported. Chief
executive Carlos Berdegue told the newspaper that 80 percent of the
proceeds will be used to prepay part of the company's debts and the
rest would be used to expand operations to the Los Cabos area of
Baja California and to Cancun in the Yucatan. The company's annual
sales rose to $33.4 million in 1996 and it had an operating profit
of 37.5 percent in the first six months of this year, Reforma said.
<p>
   A tombstone advertisement in today's papers said Grupe SA hopes
to sell 26.4 percent of its equity -- 89.1 million shares at 1.75
pesos each -- in an effort to raise 125 million pesos for the
company and 31 million pesos for current shareholders.

<p>
   Jakarta, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- A Garuda Airbus A-300 bound for
Medan, North Sumatra, from Jakarta crashed, with all 234 passengers
and crew on board feared killed in what would be Indonesia's worst
air disaster.
<p>
   ``The damage is total. It's going to be difficult to find any
survivors,'' said Darmadi, Garuda's director of operations, at a
press conference in Jakarta. The plane crashed and exploded in
hilly terrain about 40 kilometers from Medan, probably because of
visibility problems, he said.
<p>
   Fires, set to clear land on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra
and Borneo, have raged out of control in recent weeks, covering
much of the area in a smoky haze and causing the cancellations of
hundreds of flights. Darmadi said it's not yet certain visibility
was the cause. Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said it was
premature to speculate what could have caused the crash. Medan's
Polonia Airport was closed due to limited visibility shortly after
the accident.
<p>
   A total of 110 bodies have been recovered so far and there ``is
virtually no chance of finding survivors,'' an official at the
national search and rescue office in Jakarta said. The passenger
list consists mostly of Indonesians, though there are some European
and Japanese names. Also on board was Polar Yanto Tanoto, President
of PT Inti Indorayon Utama and New York Stock Exchange-traded Asia
Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd., a Garuda spokesman
said.
<p>
   Polar's brother, Sukanto Tanoto, who is chief executive officer
of Asia Pacific, was not on board.
<p>
   Garuda President Supandi expressed the company's ``concern and
condolences'' for the families of the victims.
<p>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the Garuda flight at
about 1:00 p.m. Jakarta time, or 30 minutes before it was due to
land at Medan. There were 222 passengers and 12 crew on board, a
Garuda spokesman said. The remains of the plane came to rest in a
deep ravine, and emergency workers are now trying to recover more
bodies.
<p>
   Indonesian Transportation Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto, speaking
on state television station TVRI, said witnesses saw the plane
flying very low and added it probably crashed because of poor
visibility. The plane went down near the village of Duah Nabar,
about 30 miles from Medan. A Garuda spokesman said it's the worst
disaster in the company's 50-year history. The plane was put into
service in 1982, Garuda said.
<p>
   The crash is the fourth in Indonesia this year. On July 17, a
Fokker-27 operated by the government's PT Merpati Nusantara
airlines crashed in West Java, killing 52 people. Two other Merpati
planes have also gone down this year, killing 18.
<p>
   A different Airbus A-300 model crashed in Nagoy, Japan, in April
1994, killing 264 people on board. An investigation into the crash
found no fault with the airplane, Airbus said.

<p>
   London, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- T&AMP;N Plc said Federal-Mogul Corp.
of the U.S. may buy the U.K. auto parts manufacturing company for
about 1.51 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in cash and assumed debt.
<p>
   The potential offer of 235 pence a share, or 1.25 billion
pounds, represents a premium of 29 percent over T&AMP;N's closing price
yesterday. The stock was recently at 242.5 pence, indicating
investors expect Southfield, Michigan-based Federal-Mogul will have
to bid more.
<p>
   The move follows a $650 million offer by Blackstone Group for
American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing Inc. earlier today, and is the latest
step in the consolidation of the world's auto parts industry as
customers demand fewer suppliers with a wider range of products.
<p>
   For Federal-Mogul, the purchase would build its leadership in
engine parts such as bearings and seals.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``In one fell swoop
they could accomplish a lot in terms of getting towards their
goal.''
<p>
   Analysts said T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of
asbestos, has been vulnerable to a bid since it took a 373
million-pound charge last year to insulate it against future
liability from asbestos litigation.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around 260 pence, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it is considering the approach with its adviser, N M
Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.

<p>
    &UR; TURNER JOINS LONG LIST OF GLOBAL DO-GOODERS
<p>
    &UR; For release Sunday, Sept. 28
<p>
    &UR; By BOB DEANS
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR; 
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS  &MD;  On the evening of June 24, 1869, Swiss
businessman Jean Henri Dunant arrived in the northern Italian town
of Solferino with commerce on his mind.
<p>
   Instead, he found 40,000 dead and wounded soldiers receiving
little or no care, the ghastly toll of a massive battle earlier
that day between French and Austrian armies.
<p>
   Horrified and outraged, Dunant returned to Geneva to dedicate
his life and devote his treasure to the prospect that human beings
deserved better than to be left behind as carrion on the field of
battle.
<p>
   Thus was born the International Red Cross, perhaps the single
best known humanitarian group in the world.
<p>
   With his billion-dollar pledge to the United Nations, Atlanta
media magnate Ted Turner appears poised to take his place alongside
Dunant, munititions giant Alfred Nobel, oil king John D.
Rockefeller, financier George Soros and a handful of others in a
long line of big league global do-gooders who have used private
wealth to try to change the world.
<p>
   Other wealthy individuals seek to carve out a much more narrow
niche, often with a decidedly political agenda. Miami millionaire
Irving Moskowitz, for example, has been buying apartment buildings
in Arab East Jerusalem and settling them with Jews, a campaign that
led to this month's heated confrontation between Israelis and
Palestinians in the city.
<p>
   While Turner has yet to articulate a mission quite so clearly as
did Dunant  &MD;  ``Would it not be possible,'' Dunant posited, ``in
time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose
of having care given to the wounded in wartime?''  &MD;  he is taking a
thoroughly 21st century approach.
<p>
   For in a time of shrinking government budgets and exploding
markets, it is increasingly the private sector, far more than the
public, that is remaking the world, for better or worse.
<p>
   And as the communications revolution Turner's CNN helped to
spawn has rallied global concern around the suffering of the
victims of land mines in Angola, snipers in Bosnia or dictators in
Haiti, it has become the United Nations, more than any single
country, that spearheads efforts to address such ills.
<p>
   ``We are the biggest raiser of funds for humanitarian
operations. We've got a global reach, (and) we're the only
universal international organization,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard. ``So if you need to build a consensus on any issue, this
is the place to do it.''
<p>
   The United Nations, however, is an institution in crisis.
<p>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has pledged to press for
overarching reforms aimed at addressing inefficiency, waste and
archaic practices in the 52-year-old body. Success is anything but
guaranteed.
<p>
   The United Nations, moreover, faces chronic budget woes. More
than half of its member states don't pay their dues. The
organization claims to be owed $2.3 billion  &MD;  $1.5 billion from the
United States alone.
<p>
   The cash crunch has undercut programs affecting the safety,
health and welfare of scores of millions of victims of poverty,
disease, famine and war around the world, with the most vulnerable,
particularly children, suffering most.
<p>
   The United Nations' plight mirrors, and in many ways has been
heightened by, the budget constraints on American diplomacy.
<p>
   Between 1993 and 1996, U.S. spending on foreign aid and
diplomacy plunged 22 percent  &MD;  even more if adjusted for inflation
 &MD;  to $13.5 billion, forcing the closing of 32 embassies and
consulates and crimping American assistance flows around the world.
<p>
   The cuts were part of a global trend that saw total public aid
to developing countries slump in 1995 to $60 billion. That was down
12 percent, in inflation-adjusted dollar terms, from 1991 levels.
<p>
   The downdraft is continuing, led by Japan, which has cut aid as
part of a broader budget austerity drive.
<p>
   As public money has dwindled, private capital flows have surged
as businesses and individuals rush to invest in the rapidly
developing economies of Asia, South America and Central Europe.
<p>
   Private investments in developing countries totaled $232 billion
in 1995, the last year for which World Bank figures are available,
and the bank predicts investment on the order of $250 billion a
year for at least another decade.
<p>
   Those investments  &MD;  four times the level of foreign aid  &MD;  have
cross-fertilized a boom in world trade. Last year alone, a
staggering $6.3 trillion worth of goods and services were shipped
across national borders, according to the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization.
<p>
   Trade and investment have a dramatic impact on poverty
eradication. They do little or nothing, though, to address the
sorts of humanitarian disasters that have generated 22 million
refugees, for example, or produced half a million genocide victims
in Rwanda, the sorts of things that tend to land in the lap of the
United Nations.
<p>
   Is it too much to ask, Eckhard wonders, that companies profiting
from the global economic revolution put a pittance of their gains
back into the kitty for the world's hard pressed?
<p>
   The explosion of global commerce has helped lift corporate
profits to windfall levels, in turn fueling a moon shot on world
stock markets.
<p>
   The total value of the world's stocks increased from $9.4
trillion in 1990 to $21.4 trillion by the end of June, according to
figures provided by the World Bank and the New York investment firm
Merrill Lynch. That has enriched investor portfolios, over just
seven years, to the tune of $12 trillion, $1 billion of which
Turner has pledged to the United Nations.
<p>
   By Eckhard's reckoning, it's only fair that others should follow
Turner's lead.
<p>
   ``When you have lots of people making buckets of money on a
stock market that won't quit, we have people with excess cash,''
said Eckhard. It is money the United Nations can put to good use
``if you just prick their conscience.''
<p>
   The use of private money to help fund a club of nations,
however, raises questions in the minds of professional diplomats.
<p>
   Turner's pledge, for instance, makes him a larger donor than
more than half of the United Nations' dues-paying member states.
<p>
   That won't grant him entrance to Security Council proceedings,
but it does raise the question of how much influence policy-makers
really want a television mogul to have over an ostensibly
democratic body that professes to represent the will of the world.
<p>
   In the current environment, however, those concerns have been
drowned out by unbridled praise for Turner's unprecedented gift.
<p>
   ``It's an enormous act of generosity that will supplement
declining assistance budgets and help a very strapped U.N. to do
its work,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, under U.S. secretary for
economic, business and agricultural affairs.
<p>
   Far from being seen as meddling in U.N. affairs, Turner is being
hailed by many for appearing to take the high road, designating
broad priorities such as humanitarian and environmental concerns,
but turning over to the appropriate U.N. agencies the details of
how best to use the money.
<p>
   ``It does make it less likely that he'll do some things that are
incredibly stupid or disruptive,'' said former U.S. diplomat
Marshall Freeman Harris, policy director for the Freedom House, a
Washington foundation that promotes liberty and democratization
around the world.

<p>
   Dallas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.
shares fell as much as 25 percent after the company said its
third-quarter earnings will be 10 percent below second-quarter
levels because of less-than-expected memory chip sales.
<p>
   Benchmarq shares fell 7 5/16 to 26 3/16 in midmorning trading of
197,900, more than its three-month daily average of 92,800. Earlier
the shares reached 25 1/4.
<p>
   Benchmarq said late yesterday that sales and earnings this
quarter will be 10 percent below last quarter's levels because of
lower-than-anticipated demand from customers. The demand slowdown
is probably temporary, the company said in a statement.
<p>
   With second-quarter sales and earnings of $11.5 million and 22
cents, respectively, third-quarter figures should be about $10
million and 20 cents.
<p>
   Analysts were expecting Benchmarq to earn 24 cents, according to
a survey of 4 analysts by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Benchmarq makes non-volatile SRAM memory chips, or NVSRAMs, used
by networking equipment makers and other technology manufacturers.
The company faces many competitors in that market, said Hans
Mosesmann, Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. analyst.
<p>
   ``It's a commodity product,'' Mosesmann said.
<p>
   Mosesmann slashed his earnings estimate for this quarter to 19
cents from 25 cents. He is maintaining his ``buy'' rating on the
stock because Benchmarq's largest product line, battery management
products, is a growing business in which Benchmarq is the No. 1
supplier, he said.
<p>
   Battery management chips are used inside battery packs for
notebook computers and other small devices, to provide
``intelligent'' management of power.
<p>
   ``As people ask their notebook computers to do more functions,
more and more PC makers will need battery management products,''
Mosesmann said.

   Manchester, England, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- T&AMP;N Plc said
Federal-Mogul Corp. of the U.S. may buy the U.K. auto parts
manufacturing company for about 1.51 billion pounds ($2.4 billion)
in cash and assumed debt.
<p>
   The potential offer of 235 pence a share, or 1.25 billion
pounds, represents a premium of 29 percent over T&AMP;N's closing price
yesterday. The stock was recently at 242.5 pence, indicating
investors expect Southfield, Michigan-based Federal-Mogul will have
to bid more.
<p>
   The move follows a $650 million offer by Blackstone Group for
American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing Inc. earlier today, and is the latest
step in the consolidation of the world's auto parts industry as
customers demand fewer suppliers with a wider range of products.
<p>
   For Federal-Mogul, the purchase would build its leadership in
engine parts such as bearings and seals.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``In one fell swoop
they could accomplish a lot in terms of getting towards their
goal.''
<p>
   Analysts said T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of
asbestos, has been vulnerable to a bid since it took a 373
million-pound charge last year to insulate it against future
liability from asbestos litigation.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around 260 pence, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it is considering the approach with its adviser, N M
Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.

   Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) --Consolidated
Papers Inc. shares fell as much as 3.8 percent after the company
said third-quarter profit will be disappointing because of mill
shutdowns caused lightning strikes and difficulty restarting mills
after routine maintenance.
<p>
   North America's largest maker of coated papers said it expects
to report earnings of 55 cents a share, well below the range of 72
cents to 85 cents expected by analysts. The average estimate is 78
cents, based on a poll of nine analysts by IBES International Inc.
Coated papers are used for magazines and catalogs.
<p>
   The shares fell 1 15/16 to 56 5/8 in midmorning trading. Earlier
the shares fell as low as 56 5/16. The shares have fallen almost 16
percent this year.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers expects to report earnings on Oct. 8. In the
1996 third quarter, it reported net income of $40.3 million, or 90
cents a share, on sales of $380.8 million.
<p>
   The Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin-based company said it expects to
meet analysts' expectations for earnings in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers made the forecast late yesterday after the
close of trading.
<p>
   The third quarter's performance was hindered by startup
difficulties following mill maintenance, and four plants were
struck by lightning in late-summer thunderstorms, shutting them
down for up to two days each, the company said.
<p>
   On Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, lightning knocked out power at the
company's Whiting, Wisconsin paper mill, which produces 27 percent
of the company's coated groundwood paper and 18 percent of its
total coated paper, Scott Deitz said.

<p>
    &UR; With SPACE-PROBLEMS
<p>
    &UR; For release weekend of Sept. 27-28
<p>
    &UR; By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR; 
<p>
   STAR CITY, Russia  &MD;  Forty years ago the Soviets launched a tiny
metallic sphere called Sputnik I that shook the world. They took
the first giant leap in the Cold War space race and set the tone
for America's stalwart space program.
<p>
   Today, the Russians continue to determine U.S. space policy,
though the driving force is not competition, but co-dependency.
<p>
   The Clinton administration and NASA spent much of the past week
making the hand-wringing choice of whether to send another American
astronaut aboard the bedeviled Russian space station Mir.
<p>
   In the end, the decision was made to send astro-scientist David
Wolf to replace fellow American Michael Foale, on Mir since May
through many of its recent troubles.
<p>
   For better and sometimes worse, the Russians have the world's
only functioning space station and the forerunner of a bigger
international space station whose construction is to begin next
year.
<p>
   Weighing the risks against the potential benefits, NASA is
betting on Mir and the rundown Russian space program to endure for
at least another couple of years. Despite the near-disasters of
Mir, and because of them, Russians and Americans are working more
closely than ever before in space.
<p>
   ``Space is dangerous,'' NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said
simply, before the launch Thursday of Wolf aboard the space shuttle
Atlantis. ``We make it as safe as possible. But when we build the
international space station, it's going to be gripping, it's going
to be rough. But we're not afraid.''
<p>
   Mir has come to represent the brilliance and decline of the
once-mighty Russian space program.
<p>
   In its 11 years in existence, the orbital station has flown some
2 billion miles, roughly the equivalent of a round-trip to Saturn.
The Russian space program leads the world in the invaluable
practice of human endurance in orbit.
<p>
   But Mir also has experienced a string of indignities, from
backed-up toilets to a smashup with an unmanned cargo ship in June
that nearly ended its existence. The chronic problems have made Mir
the butt of jokes and prompted serious discussion of ending
American-Russian space cooperation.
<p>
   Critics, including some powerful voices on Capitol Hill, have
cautioned that America is flirting with disaster by exposing its
astronauts to the potential dangers of the aged Mir for the sake of
foreign policy.
<p>
   NASA and others counter that the experience has provided
American astronauts with invaluable expertise that will be
necessary in the next century when a U.S-led, 15-nation consortium
erects a new space station.
<p>
   ``The future of the Russian program depends on money, and for
that we need America and France and other partners. No single
country can really do it alone any more,'' said Gorimir Chernyi, a
leading aerodynamics and space flight theorist at Moscow State
University.
<p>
   Likewise, America needs Russia and its experience from the
long-duration space flights it began in 1971. And to help build the
new space station, Russia is to carry out 44 of the 73 rocket
launches to transport components and supplies.
<p>
   But some, like Houston-based space expert and author James
Oberg, claim the United States is playing ``Russian roulette'' by
committing itself to cooperation with Russia at a time when
Russia's space budget is squeezed and the military-industrial
complex that built the program is crumbling.
<p>
   The problems aboard Mir are warning signs that could result is
disaster, warned Oberg. ``They are not the kinds of setbacks to be
anticipated on a forward-moving space program. They are the
problems to be expected on a space program in retreat.''
<p>
   For Russia, its space program represents a vivid symbol of its
once-superpower status and a more tangible magnet for important
foreign revenues from the United States, France and other countries
who have placed passengers aboard the Mir. NASA is paying Russia
$472 million to allow American astronauts to live and work aboard
Mir.
<p>
   Yet after a string of problems aboard Mir this summer, NASA
found itself in a difficult position. To have declined to send Wolf
would have been tantamount to telling the Russians they are not
trusted.
<p>
   When Sputnik I was launched in 1957, space was a platform for
Cold War scare tactics and distrust was the order of the day.
Weighing 185 pounds and about the size of a beach ball, Sputnik
literally did nothing but emit a benign radio signal.
<p>
   But that taunting beep sent panic through America. President
Dwight Eisenhower addressed the nation. Fear spread that the
Soviets would soon be able to drop bombs on American cities from
high overhead.
<p>
   NASA successes in space soon followed, until hit by another
Russian first in April 1961 when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the
first human to travel into space.
<p>
   Throughout the Cold War, the two countries played leap-frog in
manned and unmanned achievements until the U.S. moon walk in 1969.
Finally, American and Russians linked up in space with the docking
of Apollo and Soyuz in 1975.
<p>
   But the dawning of full cooperation in space had to wait until
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. And despite close
contacts over the past three years, the Russian-American experience
on Mir points to a several key historical and cultural differences
between the space programs.
<p>
   Among them: NASA's abundance of caution after the 1985
Challenger disaster compared to Russian risktaking to keep their
problem-plagued program alive. And NASA's slick public relations
machine often frustrates and is frustrated by Russia's legacy of
Soviet secrecy.
<p>
   In recent months, announcements about computer malfunctions
aboard Mir have come from Houston and NASA decisions concerning the
role of its astronauts in repairing the station have come from
Moscow.
<p>
   But aside from differences in style and substance, both programs
have an interest in stoking the public imagination and maintaining
popular and political support for manned space ventures.
<p>
   Polls in both countries show little direct interest in the
details of Mir or shuttle missions, but a general commitment to
space exploration.
<p>
   A CBS News/New York Times poll in mid-July found substantial
support for NASA among Americans. Some 64 percent favored the space
shuttle missions and 58 percent approved of the America working
with Russia on the Mir. A similar poll taken recently in Russia
showed almost identical results.
<p>
   And all along, perhaps Russians and Americans were never really
divided on their pre-Sputnik perceptions and common desire ignited
by the tiny satellite.
<p>
   Under communism, no one tapped public opinion in Russia with
polls. But had it been done before the launch of Sputnik, the
results probably would have mirrored American attitudes.
<p>
   In 1947, when the Gallup organization asked how long it would be
before man would fly to the moon, 38 percent of Americans said it
would never happen, and 23 percent wouldn't even venture a guess.
<p>
   Sputnik changed all that, both in America and in Russia.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The El Nino weather system --
expected to cause the most severe climate changes this century --
has already resulted in droughts, fires, flooding and hurricanes.
And, next, runaway banana prices.
<p>
   El Nino, which brings warm weather northward from the Equator,
may cause heavy rains and overcast skies over banana plantations in
Ecuador in the next six or so months. Damp weather causes black
sigatoka, a fungal disease that prematurely ripens bananas and
makes them difficult to ship.
<p>
   An outbreak in Ecuador, which produces 20 percent of the world's
bananas, may reduce supplies and send up supermarket banana prices,
currently at about $3 a pound, analysts said. That's good for
banana producers Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole Food
Co., which don't own plantations in Ecuador.
<p>
   ``As was the case in the last Nino, any disruptions to the
Ecuadorian supply of bananas has led to much higher prices and
profitability for Chiquita,'' said Lehman Bros. analyst Michael
Branca. He said the El Nino effect could be a ``profit windfall''
for Dole and Chiquita.
<p>
   Weather forecasters have predicted a severe impact from the
weather system, which occurs in tropical regions of the Pacific
Ocean when trade winds slow, allowing surface temperatures in the
Western Hemisphere to heat up.
<p>
   The warmer ocean waters bring rain and floods to part of North
and South America, while the slower winds keep moisture away from
Australia and parts of Asia and Africa.
<p>
   Last month, the United Nations' World Meteorological
Organization said El Nino could be the ``climactic event of the
century.''
<p>
   U.S. consumers may feel the bite. Bananas are the third-most
popular single item in U.S. grocery stores, and analysts said
demand for the fruit is impervious to higher prices.
<p>
   For Dole, which is currently selling a 40 pound box of bananas
for about $9, a powerful El Nino could add a few dollars a box to
sales, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. food industry analyst
Timothy Ramey.
<p>
   ``The effect could be pretty profound,'' Ramey said.
<p>
   The company ships about 150 million boxes of bananas each year
and an average increase of 50 cents a box could translate into an
extra $1 a share in earnings next year, Ramey said. Dole had net
income of $130.0 million, or $2.15 a share, in 1996, before a
charge.
<p>
   Dole receives about 38 percent of its sales and about half its
income from bananas, while Chiquita receives about 60 percent of
its sales, and nearly all of its income, from bananas, Ramey said.
<p>
   ``It's too early to know whether El Nino will have any impact,''
said Tom Pernice, a spokesman for the Westlake Village,
California-based company.
<p>
   Chiquita couldn't be reached for comment.
<p>
   The two companies own banana plantations in Central America.
<p>
   El Nino's effect is already being felt in other commodities.
Cocoa and coffee prices have risen amid concerns that the storm
system could deny water to plants that need it. Indonesia's coffee
crop, the world's third-largest, could drop by as much as 30
percent by El Nino, some analysts said. The global cocoa crop could
fall short of demand by 400,000 metric tons because of drought
caused by El Nino.
<p>
   ``It shows the potential outcome (of El Nino) but the reality is
it's in the lap of the Gods,'' said Lawrence Eagles, a commodities
analyst for London-based GNI Ltd.
<p>
   Ramey added that the El Nino effect on other commodities,
particularly coffee, cocoa and palm oil, has been gradual because
those items can be stored.
<p>
   ``Those are good leading indicators of what will happen to
bananas,'' said Ramey.
<p>
   Since late February, prices for cocoa for December delivery have
risen about 26 percent to about $1,700 a ton. Prices for coffee for
December delivery have risen about 20 percent to $1.66 a pound.

 &UR; MIR JUST ANOTHER (YAWN) PROBLEM IN TROUBLED RUSSIA
 &UR; With SPACE-RUSSIA-US
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release weekend of Sept. 27-28
<p>
    &UR; By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR; 
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  When speaking of the rickety space station Mir,
Russians cite the ``Zhiguli factor.''
<p>
   The Zhiguli is a rudimentary economy car of boxy Soviet design.
The affordable and therefore popular Zhiguli jams city streets
during the week. And the model is inevitably seen with hood raised
high on the weekends, its resourceful owners tinkering to fix the
latest malfunctions.
<p>
   In much the same way, Russians say with a mixture of pride and
remorse, the nation's cosmonauts keep the trouble-plagued Mir
aloft.
<p>
   ``I'm very worried about what's happening aboard the Mir,'' said
Olga Kovalyova, 49, an artist, who was visiting the Memorial Museum
of Cosmonautics on a recent gray Moscow morning. ``But on the other
hand I'm sure our nation is 100 percent committed to it.''
<p>
   But the support isn't unanimous. In Russia, as in the United
States, the Right Stuff heyday faded long ago. The once-mighty
Russian program has fallen on hard times, like the rest of the
country struggling with its post-communist economy.
<p>
   But in the 40 years since the Soviets launched humankind's first
satellite, Sputnik I, the space program remains a source  &MD;  one of
the few remaining  &MD;  of national esteem.
<p>
   The Moscow-based Foundation of Public Opinion conducted a recent
poll asking Russians whether they would support more public money
for the space program. Even in this post-Soviet era of government
deficiencies, the survey found two of every three Russians in favor
of an expanded space program.
<p>
   But most Russians have taken Mir's galaxy of troubles, from an
onboard fire in February to a mid-space collision in June, with a
hardy dose of disinterest.
<p>
   ``The public interest in space, from Sputnik and the Yuri
Gagarin flight, was wild and enthusiastic. Now no more. All this
work is routine and has problems and some people in my country and
yours wonder if it's worth it,'' said Gorimir Chernyi, a leading
aerodynamics and space flight theorist at Moscow State University.
<p>
   When the crew of the American Apollo 13 moon mission three
decades ago faced a major malfunction but kept their spacecraft
limping along, they were hailed as heroes and celebrated in a major
motion picture a few years ago.
<p>
   Russian space officials complain that when their cosmonauts
these days routinely perform the same feats aboard the hobbled Mir,
they are ridiculed by observers from the West and viewed with
indifference by the Russian people.
<p>
   In a planned mission in October intended to boost morale, Mir
cosmonauts will take a space walk to place in orbit a working model
of Sputnik I built by Russian and French high school students.
<p>
   ``There is great interest in the events that took place 40 years
ago. We think there is a need to remind people about not just about
the negative things,'' said Sergei Gromov of the Russian Space
Agency.
<p>
   ``We hope to interest young people and demonstrate in technical
terms how Mir can be used to place satellites in orbit.''
<p>
   At the space museum in Moscow, which is topped with a 328-foot
titanium obelisk of a rocket in flight, Kovalyova said she couldn't
convince her 17-year-old son Alexander to join her. She has told
him about her childhood and the dreams that Sputnik and Gagarin
fueled for her generation.
<p>
   ``But he's so indifferent to space we never even talk about it
anymore.''

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Cognos Inc. shares rose as much
as 11 percent, regaining some of the 32 percent drop that was
triggered yesterday when the software maker said growth will slow
because customers may delay purchases to consider buying rival
programs.
<p>
   Cognos climbed C$2.72 (US$2) to C$32.25 in late morning Toronto
trading of 2.07 million shares, more than 22 times the full day
three-month day average of 92,400. Earlier, the shares reached
C$34. On Nasdaq, the shares rose 1 11/16 to 23 3/4.
<p>
   Cognos warned investors about ``moderate growth'' in the next
few quarters after the markets closed Wednesday as it reported
fiscal second-quarter profit jumped 47 percent.
<p>
   ``You can now buy a very good company with a very good product
line and an exceptional management group at 35 percent cheaper than
two days ago,'' said Richard Piotrowski, an analyst with Mesirow
Financial in Chicago.
<p>
   Although Cognos reported record profit, investors dumped the
shares amid concern the company's customers may switch to new
software that lets them access and analyze information via the
Internet instead of through corporate networks.
<p>
   After the market for the type of software made by Cognos
stabilizes, Piotrowski said Cognos will emerge in a strong position
because it has a strong product portfolio and brand equity with
executives who purchase technology for corporations.
<p>
   Cognos's two main programs, PowerPlay and Impromptu, are used by
salesmen and managers to analyze information by category,
geographical region or price. The company's rivals include
Paris-based Business Objects SA and Redwood Shores,
California-based Oracle Corp.
<p>
   Analysts were looking for Cognos's revenue in the fiscal third
and fourth quarters to increase about 30 percent. Instead, the
company said it expects sales to rise 20 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
   Cognos said its fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed to US$11
million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31, from
US$7.5 million, or 16 cents, in the year-earlier period. Revenue
rose 26 percent to US$58 million from US$46.1 million. Cognos
reports in U.S. dollars.
<p>
   ``We will have strong profit and strong positive cash flow,''
said Alan Rottenberg, head of marketing and business strategy with
Cognos. ``All the underlying fundamentals of our business are still
very strong.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing
Inc. said Blackstone Group, a New York-based investment bank, is
buying control of the company, a major supplier to General Motors
Corp., for about $650 million.
<p>
   Closely held American Axle had 1996 sales of $2 billion.
Blackstone is buying its stake from Park Corp., a holding company
controlled by Raymond Park, a Cleveland industrialist.
<p>
   GM will continue to buy from American Axle, which supplies all
of the rear-wheel and four-wheel drive axles used in GM's pickups,
such as the Blazer, Suburban and S-10. as a supplier.
<p>
   ``We have a positive view on the sport-utility and pick-up truck
business, which has been gaining market share for some time,'' said
Stephen Schwarzman, president and chief executive of Blackstone.
``GM has the lowest penetration of any manufacturer in that
group,'' giving it the most room to grow, he said.
<p>
   American Axle Chief Executive Richard Dauch will continue to run
the company, which was formed in 1994when GM sold its axle-making
business as part of a restructuring of its parts division. The
company
<p>
   Officials at Park weren't immediately available for comment.
<p>
   American Axle has 8,500 employees at six plants in Michigan and
New York.
<p>
   Blackstone probably will continue to acquire other auto-parts
makers and could eventually sell stock to the public, analysts
said.
<p>
   American Axle also needs to run its plants more efficiently and
expand its customer base beyond GM in order to compete against
companies like Dana Corp., analysts said. The plants had been
neglected when GM owned them, they said.
<p>
   ``They still need to clean up operations so they can compete
against independent parts makers that have been focused on product
development, marketing and cost reduction,'' said David Andrea, an
auto industry consultant with Roney and Co. in Detroit.
<p>
   The company's U.S. production workers are United Auto Workers
union members earning wages of about $20 an hour, as much as double
the pay of workers at some nonunion competitors of American Axle.

   Birmingham, Alabama, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares plunged by as much as 55 percent today
after the company said this morning that its lead drug in
development, known as BCX-34, didn't work in two late-stage
studies.
<p>
   Shares fell 3 15/16 to 5 9/16 this morning in trading of almost
432,400 shares, more than 13 times the average daily volume for the
stock over the last six months. Shares plunged to a 52-week low of
4 1/4 as the market first opened before recovering.
<p>
   The topical creme formulation of the company's BCX-34 drug
candidate was the most advanced of BioCryst's versions of the drug.
BioCryst is in earlier trials with oral drug candidates to treat a
variety of conditions including lymphoma and HIV, said Charles
Bugg, chairman and chief executive officer of the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company. Bugg said.
<p>
   ``The results don't really relate at all to the oral,'' Bugg
said. ``We remain very upbeat about the drug,'' for other uses, he
said.
<p>
   In preliminary analyses of the studies, there was ``no
statistical difference'' between the drug and a placebo in patients
with the skin disease psoriasis and a cancer condition known as
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, BioCryst said. The two studies were
so-called Phase III trials, generally the last set before applying
for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug.
<p>
   ``We are continuing to analyze the data from the Phase III
trials, but we do not expect to see any overall change in these
general results,'' Bugg said. Because of the results, the company
doesn't plan to continue developing the creme formulation of the
drug, he said.
<p>
   Bugg said that the failure of the creme to show efficacy set the
company back as much as a year and a half in its efforts to bring a
drug to market. The best prospect for an important drug had been
and remained the oral formulations, which he said would begin
pivotal trials for uses in 1998.
<p>
   ``Oral is the big long-range pay off,'' Bugg said.
<p>
   In the lymphoma study, the company found that 28 percent of
patients given BCX-34 saw their condition improve, while 24 percent
of patients given a placebo treatment improved. The company said
the high placebo response rate ``was totally unexpected.''
<p>
   In the psoriasis study, the company found mixed results.
Patients given BCX-34 had a 14 percent greater response when
looking at the number of lesions on the skin, though the difference
between the drug and the placebo wasn't strong enough to be
considered ``significant.'' When looking at doctors' measurements
of overall improvement in the patients, though, the company found
that only 11 percent of the patients taking the drug improved
compared with 15 percent of the group taking a placebo.
<p>
   The company is also working on an ointment version of the
topical drug, which would deliver as much as 20 times the medicine
through a patient's skin as did the creme formulation, Bugg said.

<p>
   Paris, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- French stocks fell, pulled down
by the dollar's slide. Exporters Bic SA, Elf Aquitaine SA and Total
SA slipped, while takeover target Worms &AMP; Cie. soared as it resumed
trading.
<p>
   France's benchmark CAC 40 Index lost 19.75 points, or 0.7
percent, to 2985.63, but still gained 0.3 percent for the week.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 23 to 15, with about 6.36 billion
francs worth of shares traded, down from a six-month daily average
of 6.98 billion francs. The wider SBF 120 also lost ground,
shedding 9.78 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2032.73.
<p>
   Weighing on investors minds, traders said, was the dollar's
renewed drop against the franc. It fell 2 centimes to 5.92 francs,
meaning it's now tumbled 6.6 percent since hitting an eight-year
high Aug. 8. A falling dollar cuts U.S. earnings of French
multinationals when converted into francs.
<p>
   ``The dollar's the reason we're down today,'' said Pierre-Romain
Gorot, a fund manager at Jean-Pierre Pinatton in Paris, which
handles about 700 million francs ($119 million) in stocks and
bonds. ``We've gained almost 3 percent in the past two weeks, so I
think a little pause won't do us any harm. Paris is still a fairly
expensive market -- I'm not buying anything for the time being.''
<p>
   Pen and lighter-maker Bic SA fell for a second day, shedding
12.9 francs, or 2.8 percent, to 442.8. It's now fallen 7.6 percent
since Wednesday. Bic makes 44 percent of its sales in North and
Central America. Overall, the company makes about half of its sales
in dollars.
<p>
   ``Even with the fall, Bic's still an expensive stock,'' said
Gorot. ``I'd only start buying at 400 or so.''
<p>
   Oil companies, which sell their production in dollars on
international markets, also suffered from the falling U.S.
currency. Elf Aquitaine SA, France's largest company in terms of
market capitalization, fell 15 francs to 799, while rival Total SA
slipped 12 francs to 679. Together, they knocked 8.33 points off
the benchmark index.
<p>
   Cement-maker Lafarge SA, another dollar-earner, fell 6.5 francs
to 441. North America accounts for about 30 percent of its sales.
Tiremaker Cie. Generale des Etablissements Michelin, which derives
a similar proportion of revenue from North America, fell 5 francs
to 330.5.
<p>
   The stronger franc also hurt PSA Peugeot Citroen, France's
biggest carmaker, which fell 23 francs, or 2.9 percent, to 777 as
the British pound weakened against the franc. The company makes
about 11 percent of its sales in the UK. The pound was at 9.51
francs against the franc, down from yesterday's 9.64.
<p>
   Alcatel Alsthom SA, Europe's largest
telecommunications-equipment maker, fell 15 francs to 766. The
company has fallen nearly 7 percent in the past seven sessions
after saying it made a 1.5 billion francs first-half profit
compared with a loss of 374 million francs in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   ``People might be selling it to make room for France Telecom,''
said Frederic Sauvegrain, an equity trader with Oddo brokerage in
Paris. ``Remember last year when Siemens AG fell about 10 percent
when Deutsche Telekom was listed.''
<p>
   As much as 25 percent of France Telecom will be quoted on the
Paris Bourse from Oct 20. Nigel Cobby, executive director at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in London said Alcatel remains a ``strong
buy.''
<p>
   Canal Plus SA, Europe's largest pay-television operator, fell 33
francs, or 3.1 percent, to 1,025 amid reports the government will
tax all TV channels from 1998. Rival Societe Television Francaise 1
SA also fell, shedding 3.5 francs to 495.5.
<p>
   Retailer Promodes SA bucked the trend, rising 60 francs, or 2.7
percent, to 2,320 amid growing optimism it will succeed in its
drive to become France's No.1 supermarket operator. Promodes
yesterday raised its hostile offer for Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA
by 10.5 percent, hoping to better Rallye SA's friendly bid. Outside
the CAC 40, drugmaker Synthelabo SA fell 27 francs to 712 amid
rising speculation that the government is going to impose a tax on
spending on drugs as part of measures to cut its social-security
deficit. Rival Sanofi SA declined 7 francs, or 1.3 percent, to 542.
<p>
   In 1995 the government levied a so-called one-time tax on the
pharmaceutical industry, raising 2.5 billion.
<p>
   Worms &AMP; Cie. rose 32 francs, or 8 percent, to 427.9, quickly
going over the 410 francs offered by French businessman Francois
Pinault in his $4.8 billion hostile takeover bid. The shares had
been suspended since Pinault announced the bid last Friday.

<p>
   Frankfurt, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- German shares are expected to
be mixed in coming weeks as the specter of an interest rate
increase and an unsteady dollar continue to put pressure on
financial and export shares.
<p>
   Friday, the benchmark DAX Ibis Index of Germany's 30 largest
publicly traded shares rose 30.16 points, or 0.73 percent, to
4135.09. Twenty shares rose, nine fell and one was unchanged.
<p>
   ``There is still a high degree of volatility in the U.S. with
people looking for signs of inflation lurking under every stone,''
said Trudbert Merkel, fund manager at Deka Deutsche
Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH, who helps manage 35 million marks in
equities. ``It has been like that for the past two years and will
probably continue.''
<p>
   Interest rate concern was fueled yesterday as rising German
import prices and U.S. factory orders made a reaction from the
German Bundesbank and the U.S. Federal Reserve more likely.
<p>
   On Thursday, figures on German August industrial production will
be released and the U.S. Commerce Department will report August
factory orders. Both indicators will be a sign of how fast the
economy is growing.
<p>
   Banks will be hurt by a rate rise because it would deter people
from borrowing money. Insurers benefit from low rates, which boost
the value of their large bond portfolios.
<p>
   The U.S. dollar will continue to play a major role next week.
This week has seen shares closely following the dollar.
<p>
   ``The U.S. dollar is a second factor,'' said Kurt Michel, a fund
manager at Alte Leipziger Trust Investment Gesellschaft mbH, who
manages about 300 million marks in stocks. Michel is confident,
though, that the dollar will eventually rise back to 1.80 marks.
<p>
   Germany's exporters depend on a strong dollar to make their
goods cheaper abroad and increase their dollar-denominated sales.
<p>
   On Friday the dollar fell as low as 1.7480 marks, its lowest
since July 10. It recently traded at 1.7581, down 0.28 pfennig.
<p>
   The U.S. currency fell after comments by Bundesbank Vice
President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept alive expectations that the
German central bank was poised to raise its benchmark interest
rate. Higher rates would boost the mark by making some assets
denominated in it more attractive.
<p>
   Among today's leading decliners, Henkel KGaA, which exports
about 72 percent of its goods abroad, fell 3.02 percent to 99.5
marks.
<p>
   Siemens AG, Germany's largest electronics and engineering
company, dropped 2.58 percent to 119.05 marks.
<p>
   Late Friday afternoon German stocks recovered from their early
losses as they drew support from early gains on Wall Street. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average recently was up 73.19 points, or 0.93
percent, at 7921.20.
<p>
   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG was among the top gainers in
Germany. Shares gained 3.94 percent to 1,490 marks.
<p>
   ``BMW is benefiting today from the fact that the pound has
weakened against the mark and this could be good for its Rover
group in the U.K. A weaker pound would make the sale of Rover cars
easier abroad,'' said Andreas Wahl, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais
Securities.
<p>
   Earlier shares fell more than 2 percent after a report from a
U.S. safety agency yesterday said 410,000 cars manufactured between
1992 and 1997 will be recalled to correct a problem that could
cause the cars to fail to slow as much as motorists expect.
<p>
   Among other gainers, Deutsche Bank AG shares added 4.7 percent
to 122.55 marks, after they fell to as low as 116 marks.

<p>
   London, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Investors who reckon there's
little profit left in betting on which countries will qualify for
Europe's single currency in 1999 are turning to the bonds of
countries expected to join the single currency a few years later.
<p>
   That's likely to push down borrowing costs for the U.K., Sweden
and Denmark -- countries not expected to be among the first wave of
nations joining European economic and monetary union, though seen
applying for membership once EMU is underway.
<p>
   ``There's better value in these markets than in, for example,
Italy and Spain,'' said Stewart Cowley, the head of global
fixed-income for Hill Samuel Asset Management's $13 billion.
<p>
   Buying 10-year Italian or Spanish bonds offers less than a 60
basis-point premium over an investment in German bonds, Europe's
benchmark market.
<p>
   U.K. bonds deliver about a 100-basis-point premium, down from
120 yesterday and 150 a month ago, still better than the 50 basis
points offered by Sweden or 60 basis points in Danish bonds, both
of which have better economic records than Spain or Italy.
<p>
   The bigger yield spread on U.K. bonds suggests gilts still offer
the best potential returns among the bonds of the late entrants,
said Rod Davidson, who helps manage $1 billion of fixed-income
securities at Murray Johnstone in Glasgow.
<p>
   ``We would still run with the U.K.,'' he said.
<p>
   Monetary union looks increasingly like a done deal, with the
political drive to forge a single economic bloc outweighing the
difficulties some countries have faced clearing the economic
hurdles designed to ensure synchronization between the economies of
EMU's members.
<p>
   Deutsche Bank AG's research unit, for example, now reckons
there's an 80 percent chance of a ``broad'' European monetary union
starting in 1999. In April, Germany's biggest bank put the
likelihood at 67 percent, and at just 55 percent earlier this year.
<p>
   Deutsche sees Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Finland, Spain and Portugal in the
first wave of countries adopting the euro.
<p>
   The bond yields of those countries have compressed, shrinking
the gaps investors used to exploit for profit, as governments
battling to qualify for EMU improved their economic discipline and
as the prospect of currency risk on their bonds waned.
<p>
   The gaps have shrunk faster than many analysts and investors
expected. The spread between Italian and German yields, for
example, took six months to get to 200 basis points from 400, less
than four months to halve to 100, and sprinted to 60 from 100 in
less than a month.
<p>
   The speed of the move caught many investors by surprise, as
spreads were not expected to dissolve until next summer.
Strategists recommend getting in early on the next big play, with
gilts likely to be the main beneficiary of new investor interest.
<p>
   ``The bet is that bonds of the countries that should be there in
two years' time get there earlier,'' said Alison Cottrell, the
chief international economist at PaineWebber International.
<p>
   U.K. bonds got a big boost today on reports the government is
considering joining EMU soon after the 1999 start date, which would
mean a referendum on dropping the pound for the euro earlier than
previously expected. A referendum on EMU was one of the Labour
government's election pledges.
<p>
   The Financial Times said the government will probably soon
announce that it may join the single currency at an ``early
opportunity'' after the scheduled 1999 start. The paper cited an
unidentified Cabinet minister, who said the government may release
a statement at the end of October.
<p>
   A Treasury spokesman said the report was ``pure speculation,''
though he declined further comment.
<p>
   Some bond buyers think the U.K. bond market is in a no-lose
situation. The single currency gets started in less than a
year-and-a-half.
<p>
   ``In a way gilts will have the best of both worlds -- if EMU
works well, they will benefit from convergence because people will
expect them to join sooner rather than later once they have seen
the benefits,'' Cowley at Hill Samuel said. ``If EMU isn't a
success, gilts benefit from perceived safe haven status within
Europe.''
<p>
   One effect of early U.K. entry into EMU would be to push the
pound lower. The government isn't likely to strap itself back into
the European exchange rate mechanism at current levels, which are
crippling British exporters by making their goods more expensive in
overseas markets. The pound is currently worth about 2.83 deutsche
marks, up from 2.62 marks at the beginning of the year.
<p>
   Rob Hayward, an economic adviser at Bank of America, said unless
investors get skeptical about the U.K. government's commitment to
EMU, ``the pound will move down gradually to the level at which
people believe it would join the ERM, and that's the 2.60 marks
area.''
<p>
   Of the four Nordic countries, only Finland is scheduled to join
EMU at its launch. Sweden is preparing to join some time after the
launch of the system because of lack of public support for
membership. Denmark decided in a referendum in 1993 not to join
EMU, and has secured itself an opt-out clause allowing it to resist
joining the euro even if it meets the economic qualifications.
<p>
   ``If it's a true story, then it's a question of re-valuing the
market,'' said Thomas Kristiansson, a fund manager at S-E-Banken
Fonder in Stockholm. ``I can't see any reason why Sweden wouldn't
follow Britain.''
<p>
   If Prime Minister Tony Blair does take Britain into the single
currency, analysts figure it would drag Sweden and Denmark into EMU
at an early date.
<p>
   ``The fate of Sweden and Denmark will be made totally by Tony
Blair and nobody else,'' said Carlo Eraekallio, chief strategist at
Svenska Handelsbanken AB in Stockholm. ``He will take Sweden into
EMU, as well as Denmark a bit later on. I believe the U.K. will
change its attitude fairly soon.''
<p>
   Eraekallio said he'd advise investors to be ``very long of
Swedish long bonds'' while they still offer a premium to other core
European bond markets.
<p>
   Steve Major, chief bond strategist at ING Barings, meantime, is
recommending a mix of long-dated Danish bonds, U.K bonds maturing
in more than 10 years, and two-year Swedish bonds. ``On the
surface, it may seem that all of the pre-EMU convergence has been
made, but on closer inspection there are still several trades worth
examining further,'' Major said.

 &UR; HOW TO NEGOTIATE A SIGNING BONUS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   The labor market is so tight these days that it's getting easier
to negotiate a signing bonus when you change jobs.
<p>
   But like so much in life, you often have to ask if you want one.
<p>
   Signing bonuses used to be a perk reserved for the executive
suite and top-flight graduates of business and law schools, but now
they're catching on at lower-level positions  &MD;  especially in
hard-to-fill technical jobs.
<p>
   They're becoming quite popular in the telecommunications and
information technology industries, said Jack Bradshaw, managing
director of the Stratford Group, an executive recruiting firm in
Houston.
<p>
   Companies that are looking for senior-level marketing employees
 &MD;  especially engineering and consulting companies  &MD;  are paying
workers to join them, Bradshaw said. Technical directors, software
designers, programmers and computer system administrators are also
hot these days and are getting signing bonuses.
<p>
   For example, Texas Commerce Bank, which will become Chase Bank
of Texas on Jan. 20, offers signing bonuses for many senior-level
positions as a recruiting tool because top candidates are in short
supply, said spokesman David Byford.
<p>
   Professionals  &MD;  accountants and geologists  &MD;  are cashing in too,
said Bill Sala, area director of operations for Drake Beam Morin, a
Houston outplacement firm.
<p>
   Some companies offer signing bonuses because they can't offer as
much for a base salary. Instead of paying a big base, they offer
some of the compensation in the form of an up-front bonus.
<p>
   The amount of bonus you are offered  &MD;  and whether you get one  &MD; 
depends on how hot of a commodity you are.
<p>
   For those who are sought after, the money can be good.
<p>
   If you earn, say, between $90,000 and $100,000 a year, a signing
bonus of $10,000 isn't unusual, Bradshaw said. If the salary is
between $100,000 and $120,000, a $20,000 singing bonus would be
typical.
<p>
   And a senior executive who is earning $300,000 to $400,000 can
get a $100,000 signing bonus, Sala said.
<p>
   Now here's the important part: how to do it.
<p>
   Whenever you negotiate anything, do some research first. Whether
it's job skills or an old table, a little research will give you a
good idea of what they are worth.
<p>
   So it's not a bad idea to ask others in the industry about what
kind of signing bonuses are being paid. That way, you'll be
prepared when the subject comes up.
<p>
   Second rule: don't bring up the issue of a signing bonus during
the first interview. Any discussion of money is a turnoff. Try to
avoid the issue.
<p>
   Wait until you get an offer to discuss the bonus. Or if you're
working with a recruiter, let them handle the negotiations.
<p>
   But if you're on your own, here's a script to follow.
<p>
   First of all, tell the interviewer you're flattered with the job
offer and that you think the job is a good fit and you're excited
about the opportunity, Sala said.
<p>
   Then here's the kicker: ``However, I'm a little disappointed
with the financial package. I'm making $75,000 and you're offering
$75,000. Is there any flexibility in that?'' Sala suggests.
<p>
   Now, if the interviewer says that's as high as he can go, ask if
the company will consider compensation outside of the base income
like a signing bonus.
<p>
   One savvy banker said that when her bank offered her a job about
four years ago (when the market wasn't as strong as it is today),
there was a $2,500 signing bonus attached.
<p>
   The banker, who had read a book on how to negotiate salaries,
really wanted more. So she told the interviewer that it was a big
move, that she was happy where she was and she had a lot of career
potential at her current place of employment.
<p>
   Then she added that she wanted to make sure it's worth it to
move so could they give her a higher base and retain the signing
bonus.
<p>
   It worked  &MD;  she got most everything she wanted, including the
bonus.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   ``It's kind of a fine line  &MD;  you don't want to appear too
greedy,'' she said. You have to make sure you're requesting  &MD;  not
demanding.
<p>
   ``It was all in the way I presented it  &MD;  I was very congenial,
very professional, but I was also firm,'' she said, adding that
while her knees might have been knocking, she tried to make it
sound that she negotiates every day of the week.

<p>
   It's been a rough year for Hollywood's golden boy Brad Pitt.
<p>
   First he came in for lots of flak when he played a sympathetic
IRA terrorist with a Belfast brogue opposite straight arrow New
York cop Harrison Ford in ``Devil's Own.'' After badmouthing that
film before it even opened, he later apologized, even though his
critique didn't hurt the movie's box office.
<p>
   Then this summer, Pitt and his beautiful fiancee Gwynneth
Paltrow  &MD;  darlings of the paparazzi and tabloids  &MD;  called off their
Hollywood ``royal wedding.'' Both stars kept their mouths shut on
the reasons for their change of heart.
<p>
   Finally, in July, just as publicity was building for his $70
million film ``Seven Years in Tibet,'' which opens Oct. 8, the
earth fell on Pitt again.
<p>
   The German magazine Stern published documents that indicated the
heroic mountaineer portrayed by Pitt had been cosily tucked up in
bed with the Nazis.
<p>
   Based on the true story of the adventures of Austrian climber
Heinrich Harrer, who from l944 to l951 tutored the youthful Dalai
Lama in English and geography, and who chronicled human rights
abuses in Tibet, the film should have been exactly the sort of
high-toned, high-flying adventure Pitt's career needed.
<p>
   The magazine revealed that Harrer voluntarily joined Hitler's
deadly stormstroopers, the SS, responsible for sending millions of
Jews and others to the death camps. Government documents showed
that Harrer had risen to the rank of sergeant and had asked SS
leader Heinrich Himmler's permission to marry in l938, giving proof
that he and his bride to be were proper Aryans.
<p>
   Harrer, now 84 and living in Austria, reacted by apologizing for
his involvement with Hitler's regime and insisting he in no way
aligned himself with the crimes committed under the German
dictator.
<p>
   Still, Pitt and director Jean-Jacques Annaud were stunned by the
revelations, while claiming they had always been aware of Harrer's
early Nazi links and, in fact, depicted them in their movie.
<p>
   The idea of a Hollywood hunk like Pitt glorifying the life of a
man who was a member of Hitler's elite military thugs didn't sound
like a prescription for box office magic. Swift damage control was
required.
<p>
   So when Pitt, his director and co-star British actor David
Thewlis (who plays Harrar's climbing partner Peter Aufschnaiter)
showed up at a press conference at the Toronto Film Festival
earlier this month, many questions focussed on the Harrer-Nazi
connections.
<p>
   For the occasion, Pitt dumped his grunge look. He was clean
shaven, his blond locks cut fashionably shorter, and with a golden
tan and an iridescent blue shirt which exactly matched his eyes. He
looked even more handsome in person than on all those magazine
covers that turned him into a screen sex symbol.
<p>
   He insisted first of all that the Nazi past was not glossed over
in the movie.
<p>
   ``The script addresses the fact that he is representing Germany
on his climb. We've already established that this man is an egotist
and a man of great hubris who does anything required to further his
own means,'' said Pitt. ``But it's also a story about a man who
comes to terms with his own demons.''
<p>
   Director Annaud (``Quest for Life,'' ``The Lover'') said he was
realistic about Harrer's past.
<p>
   ``Being French and being born at the end of the War II, I knew
there was little chance that this blond athlete would have been
free of any connection to the ruling party. On their expeditions
German climbers carried bags with large swastikas. We discussed it
with Brad halfway through the film and from the beginning he
understood he had to play a very unpleasant character. That's why
he dyed his hair and went for a Germanic accent which is perceived
as quite unpleasant.''
<p>
   Annaud says the story of Harrer's transformation could be
compared to that of Oskar Schindler, the German businessman who was
depicted as a hero in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film
``Schindler's List'' (1993).
<p>
   Annaud says he had no trouble persuading Pitt to play the role
from the moment he read the script.
<p>
   ``Over a five-hour lunch I was impressed by his honesty and
sincerity,'' said Annaud, who knew that Pitt has his pick of just
about every top script in Hollywood. ``Brad gave me all the right
reasons why he wanted to make the movie,'' he continued. ``I knew
it required a lot of passion, it was going to be difficult and we
would have a lot of setbacks.''
<p>
   Indeed, Annaud had hoped to shoot in India but out of
frustration with the Indian government, he moved the entire
production, including Buddhist monks and yaks, to the Andes, on the
Argentina-Chile border.
<p>
   But before shooting began, Pitt, Annaud and co-star Thewlis went
to Austria where the actors did a three-week mountaineering course
and met the real Harrer.
<p>
   David Thewlis recalls: ``He was a very voluble, garrulous old
man who talked so much you couldn't get a word in edgeways. He's
quite proud of himself and has built a huge museum as a monument to
himself which he loves to show you. It was a very surreal meeting
particularly for Brad who was going to play this man, although he
didn't want to get to know the real Harrer too well.
<p>
   ``When we asked Harrer how he felt when Germany was defeated in
the war he never quite answered the question. That's why I wasn't
surprised about the more recent revelations of his dubious past.''
<p>
   For Pitt and Annaud the story was clear: ``We wanted a movie
about the guilt of this character and his redemption,'' says
Annaud. ``Harrer has everything he wants. He's good looking and
very successful but he's unhappy. It was important to understand
that money and success meant nothing compared to self-respect.
That's difficult to obtain.''
<p>
   The scrips ``seemed to answer a few questions Brad had in his
heart,'' says Annaud. ``Why is it in a city like Hollywood where
people get so rich and famous, and it's the goal of people to go on
TV, be on the covers of magazines, get a lot of money, big cars and
beautiful women why are so many people unhappy. Brad said he found
some answers in the film.''
<p>
   Says Pitt: ``It struck a chord with me because there are some
beautiful themes in there about a peace loving nation and a man
abandoning his ego ... especially in light of what's going on in
Israel and Belfast.
<p>
   ``And you also look at these Tibetans who literally have nothing
materialistically and are at complete peace. You gotta take some
kind of thing from that.''
<p>
   Shooting in remote Argentinian mountains, next to meditating
Buddhist monks transported halfway across the world to a film set,
was also a learning experience for the actor.
<p>
   ``You'd be filming in intense heat and elements and you'd see an
89-year old Buddhist monk standing there all day, not a complaint  &MD; 
a smile on his face. That's pretty much the polar opposite of
Hollywood. I was impressed with that.''

<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  Memo to George Clooney: Stop shaking your head.
<p>
   You're a handsome fellow. You have a good voice, resonant
baritone, fair enunciation, no nasality and you've got a nice,
affable presence on screen.
<p>
   Women like you. Men like you. Everyone's rooting for you.
Everyone wants you to succeed.
<p>
   OK, so maybe not the paparazzi, but everyone else wants you to
succeed. Just do yourself a favor and Stop. Shaking. Your. Head.
And the ticks, George. Get rid of them. We see them all the time on
``E.R.,'' and we're tired of them. Don't blink so much when you're
addressing women. Don't squint when you're making a point. And
don't lower your head when you're talking to someone shorter than
you! Or taller than you! Or exactly the same height!
<p>
   But incessant nodding is the worst. Case in point: In the new
film ``The Peacemaker,'' you bob your head for emphasis 23 times.
That's almost two dozen separate instances of rabidly annoying
tickish head-shakes. It's distracting, George. It detracts from the
pleasure of admiring the fine figure you cut in that Colonel's
uniform. And frankly, it detracts from the movie as well, making
this frenziedly formulaic action film just a tad less watchable.
<p>
   Not that it's bad, exactly hey, at least it's better than
``Batman &AMP; Robin.'' As action films go, this one is serviceable: a
little dialogue, a lot of shoot-outs, plenty of hither-and-yon
chase scenes as you and Nicole Kidman (as a civilian authority on
nuclear terrorism) scurry around Russia and Vienna and midtown
Manhattan in search of stolen weapons.
<p>
   Dreamworks SKG might have chosen a heftier production for its
maiden release, but it works well enough for a movie filled with
vile, stupid Russians and heroic, stupid Americans. (Hello out
there? Didn't the Cold War end eight years ago? Aren't we all a
little sick of hearing bad Slavic accents?)
<p>
   You remember the story. The aforementioned vile Russians steal
10 mean-looking plutonium-loaded warheads from a train crossing the
Ural mountains. They set this train on a collision course with
another one and then, just as the two thundering locomotives go
boom, detonate one of the warheads. The opening sequence is long,
but it's visually intriguing it has a certain stylish portent and
Leder has a knack for establishing mood.
<p>
   But face it, George: ``The Peacemaker'' is nothing more than a
marginally spiffed-up thriller pitting Amerikanskis against the
Evil Empire.
<p>
   Sure, the screenplay (by Michael Schiffer, who wrote the miles
better ``Crimson Tide'') demonizes Serbs and Croats as well as
Russians. And yes, there are neat little touches here and there;
especially welcome are the unexpected moments of pathos as you and
Kidman reflect on the deaths of subsidiary (i.e., throwaway)
characters. How rare it is to find the leads in an action film
actually grieving over the poor schmoes who die. Radical.
<p>
   But you know what? The movie has no real character development.
You and Nicole are mere smudges on the screen, highly paid excuses
to justify all of this brainless action. Nicole's character is
introduced as the woman in charge. Remember, you're her military
liaison but then you spend nine-tenths of the movie bossing her
around. Who are you, Lee Iacocca? And don't you think Armin
Mueller-Stahl (as a sympathetic Russian) is totally wasted here?
Would someone please give this man a starring role?
<p>
   Listen, George. You were so appealing in ``One Fine Day'' a
little character-driven romance is a much better vehicle for you
than this blockheaded contraption. Director Mimi Leder has helmed
numerous episodes of ``E.R.,'' and she has that breathless pacing
down pat; she knows how to choreograph action. (Doesn't that scene
at the end, when Nicole Kidman is dismantling a bomb, remind you of
the operation-room sequences in ``E.R.''?)
<p>
   But an action movie is nothing, zero, nil, without fascinating
characters, and the persons peopling ``The Peacemaker'' are bland
as plain yogurt.
<p>
   Give the action films a rest for a while, George. Play warmer
roles in smaller movies, and trust yourself to fill the screen. You
look good; you speak well; work at it, and someday you might become
a fine cinematic actor. Just stand still.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Since 1979, the Juilliard School has held an annual
competition named for the pianist Gina Bachauer, who died three
years earlier. The winners get scholarship money and public
performances, and on Wednesday the school presented Emi Kagawa and
Adam Neiman, pianists who won this year, in a recital in Paul Hall.
<p>
   The concert was broadcast live on WQXR (96.3 FM), the classical
music radio station owned by The New York Times, as the season
opener of the weekly McGraw-Hill Companies' Young Artists Showcase
series.
<p>
   Ms. Kagawa, who is a graduate student, opened her portion of the
recital with an account of the Chopin Barcarolle in F sharp (Op.
60) that had an almost military squareness of rhythm and little in
the way of fluidity or charm. But if her Chopin was puzzlingly
rigid, her readings of several Scriabin works  &MD;  four of the
Preludes (Op. 11, Nos. 1, 3, 12 and 14) and two of the Etudes (Op.
8, Nos. 11 and 12)  &MD;  had a compensating suppleness and textural
variety.
<p>
   She was at her best in the two Etudes, which demanded a
considerable range of expression, from delicate introspection to
heated intensity.
<p>
   Neiman is in the third year of his undergraduate studies but is
already a known quantity, having made his New York debut under
auspices of Young Concert Artists last season. His technique is
imposing enough to carry him easily through the thickets of
Rachmaninoff's Etudes-Tableaux, Op. 39, Nos. 5 and 6, and in each
he balanced sheer power with a sense of high drama.
<p>
   Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of his performance, though, was
his use of rubato and coloration in shaping phrases, something he
applied effectively to Schumann's Arabesque and another
Rachamaninoff work, the Etude-Tableau No. 2.

 &UR; COMMENTARY: CLASHING OVER POLITICAL MONEY
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; Updates graf 5 with Senate campaign reform debate beginning.
<p>
    &UR; For release Sunday, Sept. 28.
<p>
    &UR; By ANDREW J. GLASS &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  When it comes to political contributions, Federal
Express, which bills itself as the world's largest express
transportation firm, is no slouch. Its world-class generosity to
both major political parties has paid handsome dividends.
<p>
   In 1996, FedEx got a proviso written into law that exempts all
of its U.S. operations from the National Labor Relations Act. That
makes it a lot tougher to bring a union into the company, since any
organizing effort must take place via a national election rather
than piecemeal at each local work place.
<p>
   After the Teamsters struck United Parcel Service, which has
roughly double the income of its non-unionized rival, FedEx won a
hefty share of UPS's market. FedEx got back its past contributions
 &MD;  with interest.
<p>
   ``The FedEx case is but one example of how the political system
has become deeply corrupted and needs to be fixed,'' says Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., co-sponsor of a campaign finance reform
bill that would do away with hundreds of millions of dollars in
unregulated donations that flow into political coffers.
<p>
   For now, the focus is on the Senate, where debate on the
McCain-Feingold bill began Friday. But the House also needs to get
into the act if President Clinton's pledge to keep Congress here
until campaign finance reform becomes the law of the land is to
mean anything.
<p>
   House Republican leaders say they'll hold the debate that
Clinton wants. But in their loathing for McCain-Feingold, they've
veered off in another direction. Their weapon of choice is called
the Citizen Legislature and Political Freedom Act. It just as well
could be called the Let the Good Times Roll Act.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich shows lots of enthusiasm for the
bill that Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., has crafted. As Gingrich
puts it: ``(He) is the one person in America that has the right
reform. Let any American citizen give any amount, but (the
politician must) report it on the Internet at the same time you
deposit it in the bank.''
<p>
   Gingrich adds: ``Let everyone go play. Let them buy all the ads
they want. Let them send all the direct mail they want. And make
sure the information is available to everybody.''
<p>
   In briefing reporters on the Doolittle approach, the speaker
fails to mention that it would also wipe out taxpayer financing of
presidential elections, a process that lets Frederick Smith, the
top honcho at FedEx, pony up his $3 a year, along with everybody
else.
<p>
   But nowadays hardly anybody wants to play that game. Some folks
may mistakenly think that the $3 embodies an extra levy while other
folks may see refusing to pay it as a way of protesting the abuse
of political power. In any event, participation in the tax
check-off sank to a paltry 14.5 percent of all tax returns in 1994.
It is still declining.
<p>
   The Teamsters still vow to unionize FedEx, despite their recent
congressional setback. Gingrich believes that their drive is
hopeless. He brands the Teamster leadership as liars or worse and
vows to haul them before a congressional panel where, no doubt,
they'll be ordered to disclose how much money they funneled into
the Clinton campaign.

<p>
   Paris, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- French stocks will likely trade
mixed in the days ahead as investors look for stocks that appear
inexpensive. Some banks, such as Credit Commercial de France SA,
could advance as speculation over mergers and takeovers in the
industry gains credence.
<p>
   Friday the CAC 40 Index fell 19.75 points, or 0.66 percent, to
2985.63. For the week the Index rose 0.28 percent. The wider SBF
120 fell Friday 9.78 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2032.73, up 0.42
percent in the week.
<p>
   ``I'm looking for stocks to buy, but it's getting hard,'' said
Eric Edelfelt, who manages about $1.3 billion for GAN SA, France's
fifth biggest insurer.
<p>
   While Edelfelt doesn't see across-the-board rises in French
stocks, he remained confident that the CAC Index won't plummet
below the 2,700 level.
<p>
   ``When we fell in August, buying came in at about 2750,'' he
said. The CAC touched a high of 3075.67 points July 31 and fell as
low as 2770.79 by the end of the August. Since Aug. 29 it's climbed
about 7.7 percent.
<p>
   Edelfelt said he would pick banking stocks and companies that
might benefit most if there is an economic recovery.
<p>
   ``I prefer Credit Commercial de France to Societe Generale,'' he
said. ``It's got a better track record.''
<p>
   ``Pechiney is beginning to look good, but, then again, it's tied
to the aluminum price,'' he said. Friday Pechiney fell 2.4 francs
to 284.1, taking its decline for the week to 4.9 percent.
<p>
   French stocks could even reach as much as 3030.0 points in the
coming weeks, said Eric Bazin de Jessey, fund manager at Courcoux
Bouvet SNC, which has about $1.6 billion under management.
<p>
   ``I'm rather positive,'' Bazin said. ``We've got several
takeover bids on the go and we've had a string of good first-half
results.''
<p>
   In the past month the French market has been assailed by bids
for retailer Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA by Promodes SA and Rallye
SA; for sports company Salomon SA by Germany's Adidas AG and for
French holding company Worms &AMP; Cie. by French businessman Francois
Pinault.
<p>
   Investors have been kept guessing as share prices have gyrated
on speculation over potential bids.
<p>
   Hotel group Accor SA rose 23 francs, or 2.1 percent, to 1,090,
taking its rise this week to 8.7 percent, on speculation it may be
a takeover target.
<p>
   ``There is no smoke without fire,'' said Bazin. ``The banking
sector should also come in for some merger activity.''
<p>
   Like Edelfelt, Bazin favored CCF as an opportunity to gain if
the sector restructures. Friday CCF rose 3.9 francs to 341, taking
its rise for the week to 5.6 percent.
<p>
   However, French stocks could miss out on rises if other European
markets gain.
<p>
   ``We're telling out clients to underweight France in favor of
the UK, Germany or even Italy,'' said Mike Young, director of
European strategy at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``French valuations are
average for Europe; Germany is a bit cheaper and more sensitive to
an economic upturn.''
<p>
   ``We're looking for indications that France is going to get out
of the business of being in business,'' he said, alluding to the
participations the French state still has in many companies. ``When
it does, the French market will boom.'' --David Tweed in the Paris

 &UR; GIVING MEANING TO RAISING THE LID &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   I've visited some unique museums in recent years  &MD;  facilities
dedicated to hamburgers, kites, toys, pirate ships, circuses,
shoes, rodeos, mustard and figure skating, to cite just a few.
<p>
   But all take, ahem, a back seat to a shrine I had heretofore
overlooked: the Toilet Seat Museum.
<p>
   And, no, it's not in Flushing, N.Y.
<p>
   As ``Texas Country Reporter'' Bob Phillips writes in his newest
book, ``52 More Offbeat Texas Stops'' (Phillips Productions,
$13.95), Barney Smith's collection is situated in the garage of his
San Antonio home.
<p>
   ``After a lifetime of plumbing practice and a warehouse of
memories,'' Phillips writes, ``Smith has decorated and dedicated
about 400 toilet-seat lids, artistically altering the functional
commode covers to become hanging history. And he has generously
hung them for the world to see.''
<p>
   According to Phillips, as Smith replaced toilets with newer
versions, ``Barney was not bashful about asking for one special
part  &MD;  the toilet seat. Then he would decorate each seat with
something special, things like keepsakes from a vacation or
mementos from a historic moment.''
<p>
   Smith's museum, at 239 Abisco Ave., is open at no charge to
visitors who call 210-824-7791 in advance, Phillips writes.
<p>
   The Toilet Seat Museum is not the only gem uncovered by
Phillips, who has roamed the back roads of Texas for 25 years and
whose ``Texas Country Reporter'' television show is broadcast
statewide.
<p>
   In a worthy sequel to his popular ``52 Offbeat Texas Stops,''
published in 1993, Phillips writes about concrete gorillas in Odem,
which is just outside of Corpus Christi; television aquariums in
Austin; the Domino and Fiddlers halls of fame in Hallettsville,
about 75 miles southwest of Houston; Bat World in Mineral Wells,
near Fort Worth; and the American Funeral Service Museum in
Houston.
<p>
   Not that Texas has a patent on unusual shrines.
<p>
   In another amusing book, ``America's Strangest Museums''
(Citadel Press, $12.95), author Sandra Gurvis takes us on a
nationwide tour of eccentric collections.
<p>
   Smith likely would be fascinated by the American Sanitary
Plumbing Museum in Worcester, Mass. But what artistic inspiration
would he apply to a turn-of-the-century iron toilet manufactured in
Pittsburgh for use in a jail cell?
<p>
   ``With a one-piece, nondetachable seat, it was designed to deter
inmates from using it as a weapon,'' Gurvis writes.
<p>
   At the Frog Fantasies Museum in Eureka Springs, Ark., 6,000
frogs are made from almost every conceivable material and adorn,
among other items, a two-story doll house and a Christmas tree.
<p>
   In Columbus, Ga., exhibits at the Lunch Box Museum include 3,000
lunch boxes and 2,000 thermoses.
<p>
   And those inventories pale in comparison with the 18,000 soda
cans, 8,500 beer cans and 9,000 soda bottles housed within the
Museum of Beverage Containers and Advertising in Goodlettsville,
Tenn., near Nashville.
<p>
   Some mergers seem in order: the Hair Museum is in Independence,
Mo., but the Barber Museum is in Canal Winchester, Ohio. The
Macaulay Museum of Dental History is in Charleston, S.C., but the
Tooth Fairy Museum is in Deerfield, Ill.
<p>
   And when folks tire of dominoes in Hallettsville, Gurvis reminds
us that they must travel to Petal, Miss., to see the International
Checker Hall of Fame.
<p>
   We learn of the Cookie Jar Museum in Lamont, Ill.; the Barbed
Wire Museum in La Crosse, Kan.; the Ice House Museum in Cedar
Falls, Iowa; the Tattoo Art Museum in San Francisco; the Bead
Museum in Prescott, Ariz.; the Candy Americana Museum in Lititz,
Pa.; and the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Helendale, Calif.
<p>
   And who wouldn't be intrigued by the Mount Vernon Museum of
Incandescent Lighting in Baltimore; the Museum of Questionable
Medical Devices in Minneapolis; Mike Weaver's Drain Tile Museum in
Geneva, N.Y.; Dave's Down to Earth Rock Shop and Prehistoric Life
Museum in Evanston, Ill.; and Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum
in Farmington Hills, Mich.?
<p>
   What will folks think of next? High on my must-see list: the
Potato Museum in Albuquerque, N.M.
<p>
   According to Gurvis, it not only celebrates the songs ``Potato
Head Blues,'' ``Potato Bug Boogie'' and ``Potato Peelings Polka,''
but also displays a British air pistol, dubbed the Spudmatic, that
shoots potato pellets.
<p>
   Even for couch potatoes, both books are enjoyable reads.

already there or beyond it, your back is probably your significant
other. Back pain is the second most common medical complaint in
America, after the cold: 80 percent of the population encounters it
between ages 25 and 40, a Public Health Service study has found. It
is also poised to become big business. Back-care products for the
home are rapidly gaining a new national profile. Office ergonomics
was the first frontier for back-friendly products. Now, products
for living rooms, home offices and bedrooms  &MD;  from
posture-correcting recliners to hand-held massage devices to
spine-stretchers like inversion tables and exercise balls  &MD;  are

<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Everywhere I go, I'm asked the same question.
I've come to think of it as the question of the '90s: ``What's your
e-mail address?''
<p>
   So, this summer, wielding my credit card, I bought a new
computer from a friendly company in the Midwest.
<p>
   It was my friend Betty who sold me on the idea of buying
computers by mail order.
<p>
   ``Great prices, great service,'' she said.
<p>
   Two weeks later, my computer arrived. The components of the
system were individually shrink-wrapped.
<p>
   When I hit the ON button, the screen remained stubbornly blank.
I curbed my impulse to throw the monitor out the window, and called
tech support.
<p>
   Eric sounded like a therapist: very calm, very measured.
<p>
   ``This is what I'd like you to do,'' he said. ``Lay the CPU on
its right side, then kind of hook your right thumb around the catch
and at the same time loop your fingers of that hand ...''
<p>
   When he'd finished, I put the phone down, looked at the machine
on my desk, picked up the receiver and said, ``I have no idea what
you're talking about.''
<p>
   After three or four attempts, I got the back off the case and
reseated the video card. When I punched the ON button again, the
screen stayed blank.
<p>
   Eric wanted me to send the CPU back for repair, using UPS, which
at the time was on strike. It took me a week to persuade customer
service to use a different shipping company, which we'll call
Modern Motion. Two hours later, the UPS strike was settled.
<p>
   The next week, I got a voice-mail message from Brenda of Modern
Motion. ``We have a box in our warehouse. We don't know what it is,
or where it's going, but it has your phone number on it.'' I
suppressed an impulse to throw myself out the window.
<p>
   Back at customer service, after the customary interval of hold
music, someone told me they'd deal with it that day.
<p>
   The next morning, Brenda called again. ``Any news about that
package?''
<p>
   Five days later, after regular conversations with customer
service, I'd yet to establish that they'd connected with Brenda. By
that point, it was six weeks since I'd bought the system and, for
all I knew, its mighty brain was still sitting in a warehouse in
Idaho.
<p>
   Blood pressure surging, I dialed again. ``Thank you for
calling,'' said a cheerful digital voice. ``We expect to answer
your call within 7 minutes.''
<p>
   I spent the time trying to distill my experience to its
irreducible essence and fending off assault by Kenny G. My elegant
summary moved the service rep to say, ``I don't have access to
those files. I'll transfer you.''
<p>
   Five minutes later, a breezy guy responded to my brief and
burnished account with: ``Hey, you need customer service. I'll
transfer you.''
<p>
   Before I knew it, a digital voice was saying, ``We expect to
answer your call within 7 minutes.''
<p>
   I began to polish another monologue, this one beginning,
``Listen, buddy. Take your dumb computer and stick it ...''
<p>
   After an aggregate wait of 30 minutes, most of which was torture
by jazz lite, I found out that my refurbished CPU was on its way
back to me.
<p>
   Half an hour later, the doorbell rang. It was UPS, with the
mended brain. I reconnected everything, and hit ON. The screen
remained blank.
<p>
   ``This is what I need you to do for me,'' the tech support guy
said. ``Hook your right thumb around the catch and at the same time
loop your fingers of that hand ...''
<p>
   No problem. I reseated the video card not once, but twice. I was
unfailingly polite on the phone. The screen stayed blank.
<p>
   Then I was on hold again. My ``take this dumb computer''
monologue was beginning to take on a Shakespearean resonance when
the tech support person informed me they were sending out a new
CPU, a new monitor, the works. It would take seven to 10 days.
<p>
   Meanwhile, I talked to my friend Betty, who just upgraded her
computer. She drove to a store, bought a system just like mine and
the next day she was on-line.

<p>
   BACKCARE-BOOM-ART-NYT (New York)  &MD;  You might be married or
single, in love or divorced. But if you're approaching middle age,
already there or beyond it, your back is probably your significant
other. Back pain is the second most common medical complaint in
America, after the cold: 80 percent of the population encounters it
between ages 25 and 40, a Public Health Service study has found. It
is also poised to become big business. Back-care products for the
home are rapidly gaining a new national profile. Office ergonomics
was the first frontier for back-friendly products. Now, products
for living rooms, home offices and bedrooms  &MD;  from
posture-correcting recliners to hand-held massage devices to
spine-stretchers like inversion tables and exercise balls  &MD;  are
creating a healthy new mainstream market niche among baby boomers
who are being literally hit in the back by age. By William L.
Hamilton.  &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR;

   SCI-TUMOR-CELLS-NYT (New York)  &MD;  Cracking a longstanding mystery
about human cells' defense against tumors, scientists at Johns
Hopkins University have discovered the probable means by which most
cells, when genetically damaged, will kill themselves rather than
grow into a tumor that threatens the whole organism. By Nicholas
Wade.  &UR; Moved 9-22. &LR;

   NICOTINE-FREE-COX (College Park, Ga.)  &MD;  A manufacturing plant in

chemist who has worked 40 years to come up with a tobacco
alternative. By Reagan Walker.  &UR; Moved 9-22. &LR; 
<p>
   ALZHEIMER'S-AZR (Peoria, Ariz.)  &MD;  Alzheimer's, a disease that

the Peoria City Hall that Ron Travers helped create. By Jodie
Snyder.  &UR; Moved 9-22. &LR; 
<p>
   CHILE-VIRUS-NYT (Santiago, Chile)  &MD;  An outbreak of hantavirus,
which causes pneumonia and high fever, has caused 13 people to die
and dozens more to be hospitalized in Chile in recent months, and
health officials fear the virus is spreading to other countries in
the region. By Calvin Sims.  &UR; Moved 9-20. &LR; 
<p>
   EYE-TREATMENT-BOS (Undated)  &MD;  For the 6 million older Americans

   SCI-MACULAR-GENE-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  Scientists have found the first

is the major cause of vision loss in the elderly. By Denise Grady.
 &UR; Moved 9-18. &LR; 
<p>
   PUBLIC-HOSPITALS-NYT (El Paso, Texas)  &MD;  With the advent of
managed care and lower fees for doctors and medical services,
patients with private insurance are not as lucrative as they once
were. This has pushed private hospitals and doctors to court the
Medicaid patients they once shunned, mindful of the government
dollars such patients bring with them. By Tamar Lewin.  &UR; W/graphic.
Moved 9-18. &LR; 
<p>
   LUNGS-COX (Austin, Texas)  &MD;  Jim Spiller took up smoking as an
11-year-old kid in Baton Rouge, La. He quit at age 35. Now 51, the
state employee considers himself to be in excellent physical shape.
But are his lungs? A study at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas suggests smoking causes permanent, genetic
damage in the lungs, raising the risk of lung cancer forever, even
in people who stop. By Leigh Hopper.  &UR; Moved 9-18. &LR;

dropped significantly, a top regional cancer expert reported
Wednesday. Based on the latest statistics, breast cancer seems to
strike Bay Area women no more often than the national average  &MD; 
belying the region's reputation as the breast-cancer capital of the
United States. By Elaine Herscher.  &UR; Moved 9-25. &LR;

   SCI-AIDS-DECLINE-NYT (Washington)  &MD;  The number of AIDS cases
diagnosed in the United States dropped last year for the first time
in the 16-year history of the epidemic, a trend that federal

   THALIDOMIDE-NYT (Washington)  &MD;  Thalidomide, the drug whose use
in the 1960s produced thousands of babies with flipperlike arms and
other gross deformities, is on the verge of receiving approval from
the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating leprosy,
nearly four decades after the agency's legendary decision to reject
it for use in the United States. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  &UR; Moved

Burros.  &UR; Moved 9-23 &LR; .
<p>
   EGGS-CHOLESTEROL-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  When it comes to eggs, few
medical experts are neutral. Either they want to see the entire
population assiduously restricting egg consumption. Or they dismiss
the anti-egg movement as so much dogmatism by heart disease

   HMO-SELF-EMPLOYED-SFCHRON (Undated)  &MD;  Affordable individual
health insurance policies for the self-employed used to be as rare
as doctors who make house calls. Today, they've become a lot easier

fighting over the growing market of self-employed workers, and
access to policy information and quotes over the Internet. By Laura

   HMO-ALTERNATIVE-SFCHRON (Undated)  &MD;  Health care organizations

<p>
   MUTUAL-FUNDS-BLOOM (St. Louis)  &MD;  The Lindner Bulwark Fund isn't
doing much to protect the investments of its clients these days.
Last year, the fund ranked among America's best-performing mutual
funds. This year, it's among the worst, down almost 20 percent. By

   INVEST-TECH-ANALYSIS-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  Maynard E. Burstein's

technical analysis. By David Barboza.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved 9-19. &LR; 
<p>
   INVEST-CUMMINS-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  Since the late 1970s, the
Cummins Engine Co. has usually had the dubious distinction of being
more intriguing to business students than to investors. By Barnaby
Feder.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved 9-19. &LR;

   MUTFUND-EQUITIES-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  For the first time in many

<p>
   INVEST-SCOOTER-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  It is a tiny company that has
toiled for 14 years on the technological frontier of electric
vehicles. It has yet to turn a profit. That sketch alone may be
enough to chase away most investors from this enterprise. But some
may want to hear more when they learn that it has recently hooked a
partner who surely knows a thing or two about transportation: Lee
A. Iacocca. The company, Unique Mobility Inc. of Golden, Colo., is
intriguing in other ways. By Anne Tergesen.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved

standout now in the Lord Abbett Developing Growth fund. BY Virginia
Munger Kahn.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved 9-19. &LR; 
<p>
   FUNDS-WATCH-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  Low turnover in a mutual fund's
portfolio can mean lower taxes for investors, especially under the
new tax law. But there can be another advantage in funds that trade
infrequently: higher returns. By Carole Gould.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved
9-19. &LR;

   MUTUAL-FUNDS-BLOOM (Boston)  &MD;  The 10-year returns of U.S. equity

<p>
   MUTUAL-FUNDS-BLOOM (Boston)  &MD;  Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc. took a signal from shareholders when it opted to split its
railroad and mutual funds groups. Now, shareholders at another

management to separate the company's tobacco and financial services
units, which include insurance and asset management businesses. By
Tim Quinson.  &UR; Moved 9-23. &LR; 
<p>
   TAKING-STOCK-BLOOM (New York)  &MD;  The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, up 24 percent this year, may keep rising, if you believe,
as some investors do, that industrial stocks follow transportation
shares. The 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average is up 40
percent. By Hal Paul.  &UR; Moved 9-23. &LR;

were misusing it. By Tim Quinson.  &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR; 
<p>
   MUTFUND-BRIDGEWAY-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  First, the bad news: The
Bridgeway Ultra-Small Co. fund, which has gained a stunning 27
percent since the end of June, better than any diversified American
mutual fund tracked by Morningstar Inc., and 53 percent since the
beginning of the year, is closed to new investors. But take heart.
The Bridgeway family of five funds, which manages barely $50
million (more than half of it in the Ultra-Small fund), offers
other opportunities, even if it is still ironing out a few kinks in
its operating systems. By Edward Wyatt.  &UR; W/graphic. Moved 9-24.  &LR; 
<p>
   MUTFUND-FEES-NYT (New York)  &MD;  The mutual fund industry, whose
assets have doubled in the last four years and quadrupled in the
last seven, does not enjoy the economies of scale that would allow
fund companies to lower the fees charged to investors as assets
grow, a new study concludes. By Edward Wyatt.  &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR; 
<p>
   SPEND-COLLEGE-PROGRAM-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  When Timothy Radle
entered Ohio State University in 1994, his parents were not
concerned about college tuition or how much it might climb while he
was there. For three years, they had been contributing money to
Ohio's prepaid tuition plan, which helped them save for college and
locked in the price of tuition even before their son became a
freshman. ``This took much of the guesswork out of college
tuition,'' said Donald Radle, Timothy's father. ``For us this has
worked out very well.'' By Karen Arenson. W/graphic.  &UR; Moved 9-19. &LR;

<p>
   OPRY-HNS (Nashville, Tenn.)  &MD;  Ever since 80-year-old Uncle Jimmy
Thompson played his fiddle into a radio microphone on Nov. 28,
1925, the Grand Ole Opry has represented an American institution.
But to best appreciate a place billed as Music City USA, it's
important to reach beyond the Opry and into Nashville's clubs and
cafes, museums and shops. By Harry Shattuck.  &UR; Moved 9-19. With 2

   OPRY-SUBTROPICAL-HNS (Nashville, Tenn.)  &MD;  The 25-passenger

spectacular 2,883-room Opryland Hotel.  &UR; Moved 9-19. &LR; 
<p>
   OPRY-TRAVEL-HNS (Nashville, Tenn.)  &MD;  When to go: The turning of

<p>
   HOTEL-THEMANSION-TEX (Dallas)  &MD;  For the third time this decade,

<p>
   ARIZONA-LAKE-DRAIN-ART-NYT (Page, Ariz.)  &MD;  To Sierra Club
directors, their proposal to drain Lake Powell, the United States'
second-largest artificial lake, is breathtaking in its boldness. To
residents and recreationists, the idea of destroying the nation's
second-most-popular camping area is breathtaking in its arrogance.
By James Brooke.  &UR; W/photo. Moved 9-21. &LR; 
<p>
   NY-KIDS-ZOO-NYT (New York)  &MD;  In the end, the intended audience
of 6- and 7-year-olds, passed judgment on the brand-new Central
Park Children's Zoo, which opens Sept. 24. For Emma Thanhauser the

in Southeast Alaska. By Joel Connell.  &UR; Moved 9-24.  &LR; 
<p>
   GREAT-BARS-ART-NYT (New York)  &MD;  What makes a bar great? The
question sounds like the kind of pseudo-philosophical puzzler that
gets hashed out after three martinis, but one New York
establishment, the self-proclaimed Greatest Bar on Earth at Windows
on the World, is begging to have it answered, simply by virtue of
its name. By William Grimes.  &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR;

   OUT-BIKING-COLUMN-LADN (Los Angeles)  &MD;  Just a few minutes by car

off-road opportunities often are overlooked, so are many paved
routes. By Mark Langton.  &UR; Moved 9-22. &LR;

   NINO-FISHING-LADN (Off the California Coast)  &MD;  El Nino has

   FANTASY-CRUISE-BOS (Boston)  &MD;  Thirty-five sailors aboard a

   TRAVEL-AGENTS-BLOOM (Washington)  &MD;  A group representing small
travel agencies will ask the U.S. Congress to give them limited
antitrust immunity to bargain collectively with the airline
industry. The action comes just days after UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines announced it would chop travel agent commissions to 8
percent from 10 percent in a bid to cut costs and remain
competitive. By Jennifer Thomas.  &UR; Moved 9-22. &LR; 
<p>
   VOLUNTEER-VACATIONS-TEX (Undated)  &MD;  What about donating your
vacation time? Instead of roasting on the beach or going on another

<p>
   BUSINESS-TRAVEL-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  Commissions to travel agents
were lowered Tuesday by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines,
following the lead of United Airlines, which cut them last Friday.
Because the Big Three carriers command about 60 percent of domestic
market share, there appears little chance that the commission cuts
will be reversed, at least voluntarily. By Edwin McDowell.  &UR; Moved
9-24. &LR; 
<p>
   MIDWEST-EXPRESS-NYT (Milwaukee)  &MD;  Susan Dietman of Plano, Texas,
has been flying Midwest Express between Dallas and Milwaukee almost
every weekend for four years. Asked why she was so loyal, she
ticked off some familiar reasons: adequate leg room, good food,
nonstop flights and attentive service. Then she added a new one:
``When I pulled into the Dallas airport over Labor Day,'' said Ms.
Dietman, an information systems manager at J.C. Penney, ``it was
threatening rain and the front window on the passenger side of my
car disappeared inside the door, and I couldn't get it up.'' A
Midwest ticket agent came to her rescue, spending 45 minutes fixing
it. ``Then he took my tickets,'' Ms. Dietman said, ``and while I
drove to the parking lot he checked me in.'' If that ticket agent's
skills were surprising, his attitude was not  &MD;  not to Midwest
Express loyalists, anyway. By Edwin McDowell.  &UR; W/photo and

<p>
   LENNON-FBI-ART-NYT (Undated)  &MD;  After a 14-year legal battle by a
California history professor, the FBI has released a new cache of
material from a 300-page dossier on the late rock star John Lennon,
and has agreed to pay $204,000 to cover legal fees incurred in his
efforts to open the file. For all the years of challenge, however,
the file contains little, if any, new information about Lennon,
although it does present some bizarre details, like a description
of an anti-war activist trying to train a parrot to speak
profanities. By Dinitia Smith. W/photo.  &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR; 
<p>
   ROLLING-STONES-CHICAGO-BLOOM (Chicago)  &MD;  The Stones kicked off
their North American ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour in Chicago's
Soldier Field to a sold-out audience of 52,000. From the opening
cord of ``Satisfaction'` to the last howl of ``Brown Sugar,'' the
band electrified the stadium for two hours and 23 songs on a cold
and windy night. By Mark Hosny.  &UR; Moved 9-24 &LR; .
<p>
   MUSIC-STONES-BOS (Undated)  &MD;  The new Rolling Stones CD,
``Bridges to Babylon,'' due out Sept. 30, is far better than even
Stones lobbyists might expect. It's better than their so-called
comeback albums, ``Steel Wheels'' and ``Voodoo Lounge,'' which
hinted there was still octane in the tank. And if you still believe
in melody, passionate vocals, and lyrics that don't insult your
intelligence, then darned if this isn't one of the better discs
you'll hear this year. By Steve Morse.  &UR; Moved 9-19 for 9-30 &LR; .
<p>
   BOB-DYLAN-NYT (Santa Monica, Calif.)  &MD;  Profile of Bob Dylan: a
wiser voice blowin' in the autumn wind. Dylan is proud of his new
album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. Due out Sept. 30,
it is his best sustained work since the mid-1970s; it reaches the
exalted level of ``Blood on the Tracks.'' By Jon Pareles.  &UR; Moved

   JOHN-PIZZARELLI-JAZZ--NYT (Undated)  &MD;  These days, John
Pizzarelli, 37, son of leading jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli, is
drawing attention on his own  &MD;  crooning, scatting, playing the
guitar with the ferocity of a banjo and fronting his own trio, all
in a bid to keep alive swing-jazz and big-band standards written
long before he was born. By Jacques Steinberg.  &UR; Moved 9-17.  &LR; 
<p>
    &UR; SPORTS &LR;

   BBA-RIPKIN-NYT (Baltimore)  &MD;  Cal Ripken, 37, has played in 2,473
consecutive games, broken Lou Gehrig's seemingly unbreakable record
and become an icon to baseball fans across the nation. But his
nagging back trouble and his slump By have stirred a question that
has dominated airwaves and headlines here, with ripples felt
throughout the game: Should Ripken rest? By Buster Olney.  &UR; Moved
9-24.  &LR; 
<p>
   SKATE-PROTOPOPOV-NYT (Lake Placid, N.Y.)  &MD;  An Olympic dream ages
gracefully: It has been said that Oleg and Lyudmila Protopopov, the
Olympic pairs champions in 1964 and 1968, performed with a
brilliance that was not quite figure skating and not quite ballet,
but more in the realm of poetry. Even now at ages 65 and 62,
respectively, they skate six days a week, up to three hours a day,
and they embody the essence of pairs skating with sophisticated
lines and elegant, tranquil harmony. By Jere Longman.  &UR; Moved 9-19. &LR; 
<p>
   BBA-INDIANS-RAMIREZ-NYT (New York)  &MD;  Cleveland's Manny Ramirez
is in his fourth full season in the major leagues, having come up
to the Indians in September 1993, and has been in the lineup
virtually from the moment he arrived. Now, at age 25, and despite
various problems of focus and maturity, he has become one of
baseball's best hitters, one who hits for power and for average. By
Ira Berkow.  &UR; Moved 9-23.  &LR;

   TV-RATHER-BOS (Undated)  &MD;  There was a time when Dan Rather used
to sign off the CBS Evening News with one word: ``Courage.'' This
season, Rather may want to resurrect that mantra for himself and
the other staffers of ``48 Hours.'' By Don Aucoin.  &UR; Moved 9-18. &LR;

   SALTER-COLUMN-COX (San Francisco)  &MD;  In this television comedy
era of ``Beavis and Butthead'' and ``Married ... with Children,''
Red Skelton's brand of humor seems not only from another time, but
from another galaxy, far, far away. By Stephanie Salter.  &UR; Moved
9-23.  &LR; 
<p>
   TV-ELLEN-BOS (Undated)  &MD;  Coming of the closet has transformed
``Ellen'' from an amiable but painfully aimless sitcom into a
lively, original, hip half-hour of TV that has become must-see,
even if it's on ABC and not NBC. By Matthew Gilbert.  &UR; Moved 9-24.  &LR; 
<p>
   DAVID-CARUSO-TV-NYT (Los Angeles)  &MD;  In 1994, David Caruso began
his disastrous, highly publicized dispute with the producers of the
hit crime series ``NYPD Blue.'' Since then, he has not complained
to the press  &MD;  or to anyone else  &MD;  of being ``demonized'' by his
enemies. Caruso has not sued anyone connected with the ABC show,
nor has he retreated from public life for treatment of any drug,
alcohol or emotional problems. By Andy Meisler.  &UR; Moved 9-17 for

   RUPERT-GRAVES-FILMS-NYT (London)  &MD;  Although the chameleonlike
Rupert Graves, who made his screen debut 12 years ago playing
Helena Bonham Carter's younger brother in ``A Room With a View,''
seems currently to be the Other Rupert of British films, he doesn't
really mind. By Sarah Lyall.  &UR; Moved 9-23 for 9-28.  &LR; 
<p>
   THOUSAND-ACRES-LADN (Los Angeles)  &MD;  It was inevitable that
Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a movie together.
And probable that they'd play sisters in it, too. Both beautiful
blondes, the two actresses have long worked hard  &MD;  and very
intelligently  &MD;  to be appreciated for their talents as well as
their looks. ``A Thousand Acres,'' then, seemed a natural for them.
And they recognized it immediately. By Bob Strauss.  &UR; Moved 9-19. &LR; 
<p>
   FILM-LANGE-HNS (Los Angeles)  &MD;  Jessica Lange survived a
laughingly average remake of ``King Kong'' in her big-screen debut
more than 20 years ago. Now the seasoned actress and double-Oscar
winner is fighting to get an enormous emotional monkey off her back
in the mesmerizing drama ``A Thousand Acres.'' By Larry Ratliff.
 &UR; Moved 9-24. &LR; 
<p>
   PEACEMAKER-DIRECTOR (Hollywood)  &MD;  Action directors are usually
macho men who bark orders on a movie set, intimidate actors and the

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's population climbed 1.1
percent last year to 30.287 million people, with most of the growth
in the westernmost province of British Columbia.

   The population grew from 29.969 million in July 1996 and from
29.617 million in July 1995, Statistics Canada said in its annual
study.
<p>
   British Columbia again posted the highest annual increase, as
its population climbed 1.9 percent to 3.933 million from 3.858
million. It was matched by Alberta's 1.9 percent increase to 2.847
million from 2.793 million.
<p>
   Ontario, home to four of every 10 Canadians, saw its population
climb 1.3 percent to 11.408 million from 11.258 million. Quebec's

Brunswick's population increased 0.3 percent to 762,049 from

<p>
   Newfoundland was the only province to show a decrease, as its
population fell 1.4 percent on the year to 563,641 from 571,657,
StatsCan said. Prince Edward Island, the smallest of Canada's 10
provinces, had an increase of 1 percent to 137,244 from 136,743 in

the world's biggest software maker. More courts are clamping down
on companies such as Microsoft, US West Communication Group and
others that try to keep costs in check with temporary or contract

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Joel Sachs casts his net widely in forming the New
Juilliard Ensemble's programs, as he is rather bound to do. For one
thing, student performers and student listeners (though sadly there
were not many of the latter in evidence at the ensemble's first
concert of the season on Tuesday evening) deserve to be exposed to
the full variety of contemporary music worldwide. For another, if
Sachs and his players do not bring us, say, ``Crossing II'' by the
Azerbaijani composer Franghiz Ali-Zadeh, who will?
<p>
   The piece was worth the bringing, and was brought exceedingly
well: its opening drone for violin and viola was beautifully
sustained and seductive, and the most appealing later moments,
where sparkling instrumental tones are crunched together, were
achieved with brilliance and precision.
<p>
   Ms. Ali-Zadeh's music has been played in New York before, by the
Kronos Quartet. She is clearly a thoughtful and imaginative artist,
and not content, in her desire to reflect both international and
Azerbaijani traditions, with easy compromise or local color.
``Crossing II'' seemed to be asking important questions about the
mixing and survival of cultures, not offering glib answers.
<p>
   Crossings of style were prominent in other parts of the program,
as is almost bound to be the case these days in new music, and
touches of regional flavor were probably accentuated by the close
packing of diverse nationalities: Azerbaijani, Ukrainian, British,
Polish, Filipino.
<p>
   The Polish piece was Zygmunt Krauze's ``Arabesque,'' a piano
concerto in which the soloist never gets to sit down but leans into
the instrument and manipulates stones and steel rods on the
strings. What emerges wonderfully from such operations is a spray
of high, jangling sonorities, aptly matched at the start of the
piece by violins playing in their top register, and contrasted
later with full wind chords.
<p>
   The new piano sounds are strange and delightful, and the new
image of the pianist is strange too. The player must concentrate on
small tasks that the audience cannot see; he must be, in a direct,
physical sense, devoted to the instrument. Eric Huebner was the
gentle coaxer on this occasion.
<p>
   The works with Ukrainian and Filipino connections were both new
commissions: Virko Baley's ``Sacred Monuments'' and Jose Maceda's
``Music for a Chamber Orchestra.'' Baley's offering consisted of
the first two movements of a four-movement piece, which may be more
cogent when it can be heard complete. Its concern is with the
lives, and, even more so, the deaths, of three 18th-century
Ukrainian composers, whose music reappears in the context of a
violent homage.
<p>
   Maceda's composition required a novel layout, with seven
percussionists standing behind an open square of seated string,
woodwind and brass players. The look was ceremonial, and the sound
too. Balance mattered less than the mass effect, of musicians
obeying a uniform pulsation or several. Maceda seems not to polish
his music but leave it rough  &MD;  like a stone or, indeed, a sacred
monument.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  A New York musical season comprises many small
seasons, and one of them began at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday
evening, when the Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli sang in a
concert to benefit brain-tumor research at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Ms. Bartoli's current visit
is to include another benefit concert, in Katonah, N.Y., for the
Caramoor Endowment Fund, on Oct. 4; the leading role in a new
production of Rossini's ``Cenerentola'' at the Metropolitan Opera,
beginning on Oct. 16, and a Carnegie concert with James Levine and
the Met Orchestra on Nov. 9.
<p>
   But Ms. Bartoli's program on Wednesday was largely a remembrance
of seasons past, with a second half consisting mostly of songs
familiar from her earlier New York appearances, with Steven Blier
as pianist.
<p>
   And the first half had a certain sameness, presenting two
extended works and an aria by Vivaldi, with I Delfici, a string
quartet including the singer's brother, Gabriele Bartoli, as
violist. Repetition and sameness at this point in her career are
hardly surprising, for Ms. Bartoli has developed repertory
carefully within her limitations. Nor are they necessarily bad
things; few singers are plying much of this trade these days, and
fewer still should.
<p>
   The aria ``Agitata da due venti,'' from Vivaldi's ``Griselda,''
for example, was utterly winning with Ms. Bartoli's easy coloratura
gymnastics, utterly unimaginable in a lesser voice. Ms. Bartoli
also used her matchless vocal agility and vivid powers of
characterization to good effect in the other Vivaldi works,
``Cessate omai cessate'' and ``In Furore Iustissimae Irae.''
<p>
   Limited range or not, the distance could hardly have been
greater between her stormy opening of ``In Furore'' and the
peaceable yearning at the end of Schubert's ``Se dall'Etra,''
meltingly sung. Although in song literature Ms. Bartoli is sorely
hemmed in by her discomfort with the German language, Schubert's
Italian nook, like most of his other niches, offers many
satisfactions.
<p>
   Here, as in songs by Rossini and Pauline Viardot, Carnegie's
unintimate surroundings did Ms. Bartoli few favors. But with Blier
exercising utmost skill and discretion (and with the piano lid
opened only a crack if at all), she conveyed the texts reasonably
well and the sentiments, as usual, superbly.
<p>
   I Delfici, using period instruments, mirrored Ms. Bartoli's
range of emotion and dynamics in Vivaldi, though not always her
uncanny accuracy of pitch.

<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  To the charge of the sartorial crime of dressing
in a manner that conjures images of Mrs. Doubtfire, the court of
public opinion finds the defendant ... guilty.
<p>
   On the charge of having an affinity for threesomes that Curly,
Larry and Moe would never sanction, the court of public opinion
finds the defendant ... guilty.
<p>
   On the charge of watching X-rated videos, which shouldn't be
mistaken for New York Giants game footage, the court of public
opinion finds the defendant ... guilty.
<p>
   On the charge of biting more than the hand that feeds him, the
court of public opinion finds the defendant ... guilty.
<p>
   Good thing for sportscaster Marv Albert that he knew when to cut
his losses.
<p>
   What Albert actually pleaded guilty to Thursday in an Arlington,
Va., court was misdemeanor assault and battery. The plea came in
time to stop charges that he committed forcible sodomy on a
longtime lover from getting to a jury  &MD;  and far too late for Albert
to save himself from becoming an unemployed laughingstock.
<p>
   Though Albert is unlikely to receive a jail sentence, he will
have plenty of time on his hands to contemplate a life where the
world knows him as a cross-dressing, three-way-sex-soliciting,
porno-film-watching, woman-biting deviant.
<p>
   NBC fired Albert hours after his guilty plea. The Madison Square
Garden Network was only too relieved to accept the resignation
Thursday night of an announcer whose number recently had been found
in a slain dominatrix's address book.
<p>
   Forevermore, the lingering image of Albert will be the one
painted by a former Hyatt hotel executive. Patricia Masden
testified Wednesday that in 1994 Albert summoned her to his room in
the Dallas-Fort Worth Hyatt for assistance. According to Masden,
Albert greeted her wearing women's panties and a garter belt and
tried to force her to perform oral sex on him.
<p>
   She said she ripped off his toupee and fled.
<p>
   With that vision still dancing in the heads of jurors, defense
attorney Roy Black tried to attack the testimony by suggesting
Masden concocted the story  &MD;  even the detail about the hairpiece  &MD; 
from media reports about Albert.
<p>
   Masden insisted she had known for years that Albert wore a
toupee, prompting Black to ask a question he quickly regretted:
``Because you read it in the press?''
<p>
   ``You can look at it and see,'' Masden said. ``Yeah, it's very
apparent that he wears a toupee.''
<p>
   As laughter rocked the courtroom, it had to occur to Albert
that, at 56, his life as he knew it was over. Albert and Black had
planned to launch a ``Fatal Attraction'' defense, portraying the
accuser as vindictive and unstable.
<p>
   But strong rape shield laws in Virginia, plus a judge who bent
over backwards on behalf of the prosecution, left Albert with
nothing to counter the image of him in a hotel room, wearing female
regalia better suited for Dennis Rodman, desperately clutching his
hairpiece.
<p>
   The same judge who admitted Masden's testimony would not allow
Albert to introduce into evidence any of his history with his
accuser. And there is more than a little reason to put the
accuser's version of events to close scrutiny. Remember that on
Monday, Black produced a tape of the accuser trying to, at best,
coach and, at worst, bribe a potential witness. Given that
evidence, it's hardly unreasonable for Albert and Black to feel
entitled to bring the accuser's credibility and character into
question.
<p>
   In the nation's understandable zeal to protect rape victims, the
Law of Unintended Consequences has come into play. At least, let's
hope it is an unintended consequence of rape shield laws as
draconian as Virginia's that a woman with a twisted or vengeful
agenda can make accusations with little accountability.
<p>
   It makes perfect sense to furnish the accuser with every
possible safeguard to privacy in a case where she doesn't know the
accused. But in a he-said, she-said matter between two people who
have a history with each other, it's frightening to think that the
accused doesn't have a chance to challenge the credibility of the
accuser.
<p>
   Nobody in his or her right mind wants mothers and sisters and
daughters and grandmothers subjected to any more trauma than a rape
already inflicts. At the same time, nobody should want fathers and
brothers and sons and grandfathers to have their lives, reputations
and families devastated by sick accusers who face little
accountability.
<p>
   Dallas Cowboys Michael Irvin and Eric Williams are living proof
that such people do exist and exploit. Williams and Irvin got
branded as rapists last December by a woman who later admitted she
made up the whole thing. Can you even remember the name of the
woman? It's Nina Shahravan, and she's a 24-year-old former topless
dancer who just recently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor perjury
charges. She received a 90-day jail sentence for smearing the
reputations of two men.
<p>
   Clearly, Albert has sexual proclivities that mainstream America
considers perverse at best. But as long as he limits those pursuits
to consenting partners, there's no crime in that.
<p>
   Only two people know what really happened at the Ritz Carlton in
Arlington, Va. Only two people know if there were two consenting
adults in Room 1002 on that February night. The world, meanwhile,
now knows sordid detail after sordid detail about Marv Albert.
<p>
   His reputation is ruined. His career and personal life are in
shambles. His engagement to another woman has been put to the sort
of stress test that not many people could pass.
<p>
   Has justice been served yet? The suspicion here is that there is
one way to know for sure. If, after all of this, the accuser tries
to turn the case into financial gain with a civil suit, then a
credible light shines on Albert's ``Fatal Attraction'' scenario. By
then, of course, it will be too late to reverse the harsh verdict
handed down in the court of public opinion.

   Houston, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Kirby Corp. said its
third-quarter earnings and revenue will fall below forecasts as an
oversupply of barges to transport oil and fuel offshore has reduced
demand and cut prices.
<p>
   Houston-based Kirby said it expects earnings of 24 cents to 26
cents a share, below the 33-cent-a-share average forecast from five
analysts polled by First Call.
<p>
   Kirby, which operates the largest fleet of inland tank barges in
the U.S., said revenue will range from $97 million to $100 million.
It earned $7.11 million, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $100.10
million, in the year-ago period.
<p>
   Kirby shares fell 9/16 to 19 5/8 in midday trading.
<p>
   Results also will be reduced by higher costs and lower volume of
refined products and fertilizers on its inland barges, Kirby said.
Kirby will report earnings Oct. 22.
<p>
   The company transports industrial and agricultural chemicals
along the Mississippi River system and the Gulf Intercoastal
Waterway. It runs a smaller barge fleet that hauls crude oil and
related products offshore, and sells and repairs diesel engines.
<p>
   ``We are disappointed in our expected results but, looking
forward, we believe our cost-reduction program will allow us to
increase our margins, and we expect the inland tank barge business
will improve,'' said Joe Pyne, Kirby chief executive.
<p>
   The company expects to save 30 cents to 40 cents a share in
operating costs over three years.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate's point man on
tobacco says he's not convinced sweeping legislation is needed to
combat the nation's deadliest habit. He offers a simple suggestion.
<p>
   ``You know, Nancy Reagan had a pretty good anti-drug campaign
when she said, `Just say, no,''' Senate Assistant Republican Leader
Don Nickles told a news conference last week. ``I'd hope that
people don't smoke.''
<p>
   Public health advocates think the government needs to do more
than say just ``no.'' They favor a resounding ''yes'' to turning
the federal screws on cigarette makers.
<p>
   ``A comprehensive settlement requires strong federal
involvement,'' not a tepid one like Nickles offered, said Diane
Conova, a vice president of the American Heart Association.
<p>
   Ethan Siegal, a political and financial analyst, says Nickles
``is simply not that interested'' in sweeping legislation that
would redefine the marketing and sale of tobacco. ``Nickles brings
to the table an anti-big government, anti-regulation ideology,''
said Siegal, who heads The Washington Exchange, a private group
that tracks policy and politics on Capitol Hill for institutional
investors.''
<p>
   ``He can't block an agreement -- not as long as (Senate
Republican Leader) Trent Lott wants one,'' said Siegal. ```But he
can configure it. Delay it. Shape it.''
<p>
   Nickles' fingerprints are certain to be on any legislation that
ultimately is introduced on Capitol Hill and sent to President Bill
Clinton for his signature. And that should provide some comfort to
the tobacco industry, which has long seen Nickles as a friend. In
the past six years, federal records show, the Oklahoma Republican
has received nearly $60,000 in campaign contributions from tobacco
giants.
<p>
   Now, as the lead Senate Republican on tobacco, Nickles is
responsible for deciding what, if any, national legislation may be
needed to better control tobacco, blamed for more than 400,000 U.S.
deaths a year.
<p>
   Toward that end, he directed Senate committee chairmen to hold a
series of hearings on the proposed tobacco liability settlement
reached by 39 states and the industry on June 20.
<p>
   They are to report back to Nickles within the next few weeks on
whether they believe at least some of that accord should be enacted
into law, such as restricting the marketing and sale of tobacco
products and giving the industry some form of immunity from future
class-action lawsuits in exchange for billions of dollars to
resolve existing smoking-related health claims.
<p>
   ``We will collectively try to decide what to do,'' said Nickles,
whose options include writing sweeping, narrow or no legislation.
<p>
   ``I don't feel compelled that we have to pass this in two
months,'' Nickles said. ``I don't feel like we are compelled to
pass it in 12 months.'' Such talk is why some on Wall Street have
begun to wonder if there will ever will be an agreement. ``The
market is remaining skeptical to both the timing and the
possibility of a deal,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst
with Smith Barney.
<p>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, said despite criticism of
Nickles from the left, he's delighted Nickles is in charge.
<p>
   ``He has credibility on the (political) right and you are going
to need support from the right, left and middle to get anything
through Congress,'' DeWine said.
<p>
   Nickles' political career has been on fast forward.
<p>
   He was elected to the Senate in 1980 as a foe of the federal
bureaucracy and as an advocate of family values and free
enterprise. He was just 31, the youngest Republican ever elected to
the Senate.
<p>
   He quickly became a rising conservative star, one who had the
support of fundamentalist Christian groups that liked what they saw
during his two years as an Oklahoma state senator, and he moved up
the Republican leadership chain rapidly.
<p>
   In 1988, he was elected chairman of the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee. Last year colleagues made him Assistant Senate
Republican Leader, commonly known as the Republican Whip.
<p>
   Nickles has pushed for a less intrusive government and a more
family-friendly tax system. He sponsored legislation that resulted
in the deregulation of natural gas, and led the fight to repeal the
so-called windfall profit tax. It was his proposal in 1995 that
returned to the states from the federal government the power to set
its own speed limits.
<p>
   Nickles didn't volunteer for the job of taking the Senate lead
on tobacco. As the Senate's No. 2 Republican, he was drafted.
Senate Republican Leader Lott assigned Nickles the task after Lott
recused himself from consideration of the proposed June 20 tobacco
liability settlement because his brother-in-law was involved in the
settlement negotiations.
<p>
   Nickles says he remains unconvinced what, if anything, Congress
should do with tobacco. Perhaps, he says, it should merely focus on
trying to wean people off of nicotine.
<p>
   ``We could run a lot of commercials: Smoking is hazardous to
your health,''' Nickles suggested.

   Menasha, Wisconsin, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Banta Corp. said it
will sell or discontinue three businesses and close three packaging
plants, resulting in a third-quarter pretax charge of $13.5 million
that trims earnings by 27 cents a share, to focus on its main
printing services.
<p>
   The Menasha, Wisconsin-based publishing company had net income
of $15.3 million, or 49 cents a share, on total revenue of $264.6
million in the year-ago third quarter. The two analysts who issued
third-quarter estimates on Banta in a recent IBES International
Inc. survey both expected earnings of 55 cents. Banta plans to
focus on its educational and general book publishing businesses, as
well as online and interactive media. About 140 employees work in
the businesses that are up for sale.
<p>
   Negotiations are under way to sell Banta's KCS Industries sign
business to a management-led group, the company said. The sign
business, which has 100 employees, had sales of about $10 million
to $15 million in 1996. Banta will retain KCS Industries' printing
business, whose 75 employees make labels.
<p>
   Banta also said it is in early discussions to sell its Boston
video production and CD-ROM interactive software business, DI
Group, to an unspecified buyer. Banta might retain some of DI
Group's 40 employees to help design World Wide Web sites at its
Cambridge, Massachusetts, online services unit.
<p>
   In addition, Banta will abandon the intaglio security printing
business and close its Milwaukee plant, where it had already fired
200 workers. Intaglio printing is used on postage stamps, food
stamps, and stock and bond certificates. A joint venture with the
U.S. Postal Service to supply postage stamps won't be renewed when
it expires Sept. 30.
<p>
   Lastly, Banta said it plans to close three of its global
software and computer distribution centers in Sacramento,
California; Irvine, California; and Provo, Utah. The company said
fewer than 20 full-time employees would be affected by the
closings, plus some part-time workers and subcontractors.
<p>
   Separately, the company said it opened three new facilities in
Union City, California; Fort Worth, Texas; and Spanish Fork, Utah.
The facilities are near customer sites where they can better manage
the assembly and distribution of computer software packages and
hardware accessories.
<p>
   Banta shares fell 3/8 to 27 3/8 in midday trading.

 &UR; BIRNER DENTAL FILES TO RAISE AS MUCH AS $23 MILLION IN IPO &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Denver-based Birner Dental
Management Services Inc., another in a series of dental practice
managers going public, expects to raise as much $23 million in a
first-time stock sale.
<p>
   The company filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the initial public offering, but didn't provide he
number of shares to be sold, the price per share or the number of
shares to be outstanding after the offer. Further details will be
available in subsequent filings.
<p>
   Since its formation in May 1995, Birner Dental has acquired 31
dental practices -- 28 in Colorado and three in New Mexico. The
company now manages 34 offices, some of which offer specialty
services such as orthodontics, in addition to general dental
services.
<p>
   Two brothers, Frederic and Mark Birner, founded the company.
Frederic Birner, 40, serves as chairman and chief executive. He
previously worked as a vice president of corporate finance for
Cohig &AMP; Associates Inc., an investment bank.
<p>
   Mark Birner, 38, serves as president and was the owner and
operator of three dental practices. He received his dental degree
from the University of Colorado.
<p>
   The brothers are the company's largest shareholders and own a
25.3 percent stake before the stock offering.
<p>
   Existing shareholders, including two Birner Dental directors,
will sell 296,236 shares in the offering, the filing said.
<p>
   The filing is the latest in a series of IPO filings from dental
practice management companies. DentalCo Inc. and Dental Care
Alliance Inc. filed registrations recently.
<p>
   Coast Dental Services Inc. shares began trading in February at
$8 each, and the stock has risen 259 percent since February,
reaching a high of 28 3/4 on Sept. 23. Its stock traded unchanged
at 28 1/8 today.
<p>
   These companies say trends such as the increase of dental
insurance and the added burdens in accounting and paperwork they
place on dentists are driving consolidation in the field. In 1995,
87 percent of the 151,000 practicing U.S. dentists worked alone or
with one other dentist, according to the American Dental
Association.
<p>
   Birner Dental said it will use $2.35 million of proceeds from
the stock sale to repay debt. Birner Dental will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of stock held by shareholders.
<p>
   An additional $1.4 million in proceeds will be used to repay a
note issued in connection with the Sept. 8 purchase of Gentle
Teeth, which has nine dental practices in Colorado, for $3.5
million. That note bears 8 percent interest and matures Sept. 8,
2000.
<p>
   The remaining proceeds will be used for potential acquisitions,
development of new offices, working capital, and general corporate
purposes, the filing said.
<p>
   For the six months ended June 30, Birner Dental reported net
income of $266,000, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$96,000, or 3 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue for the
six months ended June 30 was $6.8 million compared with $2.1
million the year before.
<p>
   On an adjusted basis to reflect recent acquisitions, the stock
offer, and reduction of debt, the company's net income for the six
months ended June 30 was $564,000. Revenue was $10.2 million.
<p>
   Dennis Genty, Birner Dental's chief financial officer, declined
to comment on the offering.
<p>
   Wheat First Butcher Singer and A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. will
underwrite the offering, and shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock
Market under the symbol BDMS, according to the S-1 registration
statement filing.

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian government bonds rose
after reports indicating both the Canadian and U.S. economies are
growing at a non-inflationary pace bolstered demand for
fixed-income securities.
<p>
   Prices for industrial goods rose 0.7 percent last month, while
raw materials prices slipped 0.1 percent, confirming for traders
that manufacturers' costs aren't threatening to push up prices for
consumer goods and services.
<p>
   At the same time, the Commerce Department said its final tally
of second quarter U.S. growth was 3.3 percent, less than
economists' estimate of 3.6 percent, while the price deflator --a
measure of inflation -- rose at a 1.8 percent pace.
<p>
   That rekindled optimism that both countries economies are
growing at a pace that isn't threatening to speed inflation.
<p>
   ``The big story for the market is on the inflation front
--prices are still quite low,'' said David Yu, a principal at
Perigee Investment Counsel Inc. who manages C$2.5 billion (US$1.8
billion) of bonds. ``Growth is strong, you can see it around you,
but costs aren't being passed on to consumers.''
<p>
   Canada's benchmark 30-year, 8 percent bond rose C$0.59 to
C$122.97, sending the yield 4 basis points lower to 6.28 percent.
On Wednesday, the benchmark bond's yield slid 9 basis points to
6.26 percent -- its lowest ever. Yesterday, though, the yield
retreated on concern that inflation is picking up.
<p>
   Bonds posted their largest one-day drop in eight weeks yesterday
after a series of U.S. reports revived speculation that the Federal
Reserve may raise lending rates soon to slow the U.S. economy,
prompting Canada's central bank to raise its own benchmark rate to
keep Canadian securities competitive.
<p>
   Even without inflation, traders are bracing for a quarter-point
increase in lending rates because of concern strong growth will
eventually lead to higher prices if left unchecked.
<p>
   The central bank raised its benchmark rate in June a quarter
point to 3.5 percent to bolster the Canadian currency. The Federal
Reserve raised its similar benchmark rate in March to 5.5 percent
to temper growth and keep inflation from rising.
<p>
   While most market watchers don't anticipate the Fed will raise
rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday, traders are still
undecided about whether Fed governors will vote to lift rates at
their Nov. 12 meeting to keep inflation at bay.
<p>
   ``I think (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan and his colleagues would
have warned the market by now if they had planned a September rate
increase,'' said David Rosenberg, a senior economist at investment
dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc. ``It's still a little early to conclude
they won't raise rates in November.''
<p>
   Rising U.S. rates place pressure on the Bank of Canada to
implement a similar move to keep the 2-percentage-point gap between
Canadian and U.S. official rates from widening. Higher U.S. rates
also directly affect the Canadian economy, damping U.S. demand for
Canadian goods. More than 80 percent of Canadian goods are destined
for U.S. consumption.
<p>
   Among other issues, the 10-year, 7.25 percent bond's yield fell
4 basis points to 5.72 percent. The yield on the five-year, 7
percent issue fell 3 basis points to 5.10 percent.
<p>
   The Canadian dollar recently traded at 72.26 U.S. cents, little
changed from yesterday's close of 72.30 U.S. cents. It has risen
more than half a cent in the past week.
<p>
   ``It's been a roller coaster ride this week,'' Yu said. He
refrained from buying or selling government securities this week,
though still sees potential for good returns on long-term issues.
<p>
   This week bonds rose, fell, then rose again as traders debated
whether growth is threatening to speed inflation.
<p>
   Even so, total returns on Canadian bonds have been the best in
the world. To date, Canadian bonds have posted a total return of
7.38 percent in Canadian dollar terms, slightly above the
6.96-percent total return in the U.S. debt market. Traders are now
turning their attention to next week's manufacturing and gross
domestic product reports in Canada and U.S. on consumer confidence,
manufacturing and jobs for more insight into the strength of both
economies.
<p>
   U.S. government bonds rose, with the U.S. 30-year bond's yield
at 6.37 percent, 9 basis points above its Canadian counterpart.
Canada's 30-year benchmark bond hasn't yielded more than its U.S.
equivalent since July 29.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing
Inc. said Blackstone Group, a New York-based investment bank, is
buying control of the company, a major supplier to General Motors
Corp., for about $650 million.
<p>
   Closely held American Axle had 1996 sales of $2 billion.
Blackstone is buying its stake from Park Corp., a holding company
controlled by Raymond Park, a Cleveland industrialist.
<p>
   GM will continue to buy from American Axle, which supplies all
of the rear-wheel and four-wheel drive axles used in GM's pickups,
such as the Blazer, Suburban and S-10.
<p>
   ``We have a positive view on the sport-utility and pick-up truck
business, which has been gaining market share for some time,'' said
Stephen Schwarzman, president and chief executive of Blackstone.
``GM has the lowest penetration of any manufacturer in that
group,'' giving it the most room to grow, he said.
<p>
   American Axle Chief Executive Richard Dauch will continue to run
the company, which was formed in 1994, when GM sold its axle-making
business as part of a restructuring of its parts division. The
company
<p>
   Officials at Park weren't immediately available for comment.
<p>
   American Axle has 8,500 employees at six plants in Michigan and
New York.
<p>
   Blackstone probably will continue to acquire other auto-parts
makers and could eventually sell stock to the public, analysts
said.
<p>
   American Axle also needs to run its plants more efficiently and
expand its customer base beyond GM in order to compete against
companies like Dana Corp., analysts said. The plants had been
neglected when GM owned them, they said.
<p>
   ``They still need to clean up operations so they can compete
against independent parts makers that have been focused on product
development, marketing and cost reduction,'' said David Andrea, an
auto industry consultant with Roney and Co. in Detroit.
<p>
   The company's U.S. production workers are United Auto Workers
union members earning wages of about $20 an hour, as much as double
the pay of workers at some nonunion competitors of American Axle.

Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''
<p>
   For repeats of any of these stories, call 212-556-1927.

some particularly good offerings. A Page One story in The New York
Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''
<p>

   Time had glowing praise for The New York Times in its Sept. 29
issue: ``The Times has the largest editorial staff, spends more
money on newsgathering and has won more Pulitzer Prizes (74) than

astuteness of its journalism, top to bottom, no other paper even
comes close.''
<p>
   Our New York Times News Service clients, who receive virtually
the entire newspaper every day, including The Times' columnists, of
course benefit from this journalistic excellence and from the

music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''

 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Bloomberg Major League
Baseball Notebook:
<p>
   MARTINEZ REACHES MILESTONE -- Montreal Expos right-hander Pedro
Martinez joined a select group last night when he recorded his
300th strikeout of the season against the Florida Marlins.
<p>
   Martinez became just the 14th pitcher this century and the
second this season to reach 300 K's, joining Philadelphia's Curt
Schilling. He finished the game with nine strikeouts to push his
season total to 305. His previous career best was 222 last season.
<p>
   It's just the fourth time in baseball history that two pitchers
have struck out 300 hitters in a season and the first since 1972
when California's Nolan Ryan fanned 329 and Philadelphia's Steve
Carlton had 310 K's.
<p>
   Ryan is the all-time leader in 300-strikeout seasons with six,
all with the Angels. Los Angeles' Sandy Koufax is tops in the
National League with three 300 strikeout campaigns.
<p>
   N.L. SAVE LEADER -- Who leads the National League in saves? The
answer may be hard to guess.
<p>
   With 42 saves, Cincinnati right-hander Jeff Shaw will lead the
N.L. in that category. He currently holds a five-save lead over San
Francisco's Rod Beck and San Diego's Trevor Hoffman.
<p>
   Shaw's success is surprising considering he had only nine career
saves in five-plus big league seasons with Cleveland, Montreal and
Cincinnati heading into 1997.
<p>
   With 14 saves in 15 opportunities in September, Shaw's tied the
N.L. record for saves in the month of September set by Randy Myers
of the Chicago Cubs in 1993. He's also just one away from the major
league record for saves in any month set by St. Louis' Lee Smith in
June 1993 and matched by John Wetteland of the New York Yankees in
June 1996.
<p>
   TONY GWYNN SUPERLATIVES -- A few notes of interest as San
Diego's Tony Gwynn closes in on his eighth National League batting
title.
<p>
   Since his first full season of 1984, Gywnn has never finished
lower than sixth in the N.L. batting race. In non-winning years, he
was sixth in 1990, fifth in 1992, fourth in 1985, third in 1986 and
1991 and second in 1993.
<p>
   During the seven seasons in which he won the batting crown, his
statistical average has been .354 with seven home runs and 66 runs
batted in. Heading into the final three-game series with San
Francisco, Gwynn is hitting .374 with career highs of 17 HR and 118
RBI.
<p>
   Gwynn currently leads Colorado Rockies outfielder Larry Walker
by eight points in the batting race. His narrowest margin of
victory came in 1989 when he edged out San Francisco's Will Clark
by three points, .336 to .333.
<p>
   Gwynn's winning batting averages: .351 (1984), .370 (1987), .313
(1988), .336 (1989), .394 (1994), .368 (1995) and .353 (1996).
<p>
   His winning a fourth straight title this season would be the
longest streak in the N.L. since Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis
Cardinals won six straight from 1920-25.
<p>
   AVERY CASHES IN -- Boston Red Sox left-hander Steve Avery's
start yesterday against the Detroit Tigers was worth $3.9 million.
<p>
   The start, Avery's 18th of the season, automatically activated a
$3.9 million contract option for 1998. Although it's a nice piece
of change, Avery, who can become a free agent at the end of the
season, isn't sure he'll return to Boston.
<p>
   ``If I were in Vegas, I'd bet against it (coming back),'' Avery
said. ``If I take it, it's because Boston is the best place for me.
I don't feel that way right now.
<p>
   ``If I take it, it's something I've earned for pitching eight
years and I don't think I have to answer to anybody.''
<p>
   Avery was making his first start since being banished to the
bullpen on Aug. 31. At that time, the Players Association
considered filing a grievance on his behalf, saying the demotion
came to prevent him from fulfilling the 18-start clause in his
contract.
<p>
   Avery didn't get the decision in the Red Sox's 3-1 win. For the
season, he's 6-7 with a 6.42 earned run average.

   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''

 &UR; LEONA HELMSLEY SELLS HELMSLEY-SPEAR TO PARTNERS (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Robert Burgess &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
   (Updates with statements in third and last paragraphs.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Leona Helmsley sold her
controlling stake in Helmsley-Spear Inc., one of New York's largest
commercial property managers, to her late husband Harry's two main
business partners for $500,000.
<p>
   The move ends a long dispute between Leona, dubbed the ``Queen
of Mean'' by New York tabloids for her treatment of employees, and
the partners, Irving Schneider and Alvin Schwartz and comes three
months after she said she would start selling her interests in
properties valued at $5 billion.
<p>
   ``Leona Helmsley, Alvin Schwartz and Irving Schneider announced
today that they had resolved all disputes between them, and that
they had signed definitive agreements that turned Helmsley-Spear
over to Schwartz and Schneider,'' the three said in a joint
statement.
<p>
   Real estate executives said legal disputes between Helmsley and
the partners could hamper her ability to sell the properties, which
are owned through a string of more than 100 partnerships set up by
Harry Helmsley and various associates.
<p>
   Helmsley's interests up for sale include the master lease on the
Empire State Building, office buildings, apartments and a string of
Midwest motels.
<p>
   Helmsley, who served 18 months in federal prison for tax
evasion, inherited the properties from her billionaire husband
Harry Helmsley who died in January at age 87. Leona is in her late
70's and has no heirs.
<p>
   The fighting began three years ago when Schneider and Schwartz
sued Leona claiming they are due almost $6 million in back pay
relating to their work for Helmsley-Spear, once one of the biggest
real estate companies in the U.S. Leona, in turn, launched her own
lawsuits against the two and others.
<p>
   These disputes and others have been blamed for holding up money
that would be better used for badly needed renovations of the
Helmsley properties. Developer Donald Trump and his partners, which
own the Empire State Building, have been trying since 1995 to get
the courts to wrest control of the master lease from Helmsley and
others by charging they neglected the buildings' physical
condition.
<p>
   ``Schneider particularly regrets any negative statements about
either Mr. Helmsley or Mrs. Helmsley that may have been included in
legal papers prepared on his behalf in the litigation between
them,'' the statement said.

<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''

 &UR; CANADIAN COMPANIES RUSH TO SELL JUNK BONDS: CANADA DEBT WATCH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Corey Goldman, through the Toronto newsroom &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Toronto, Sept.26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's corporate debt market,
once the exclusive domain of the country's banks and utilities, is
fast becoming a lucrative arena for all types of companies looking
to raise cash.
<p>
   In the past two months alone, Canadian companies have sold more
than C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) of bonds in Canada's fledgling
debt market, paving the way for a second consecutive record year of
corporate issues. A large amount of that is what traders described
as lower-grade debt, often referred to as junk.
<p>
   With the Bank of Canada poised to raise interest rates to keep
inflation in check and federal and provincial governments
approaching balanced budgets -- lessening their need to sell bonds
-- even more Canadian firms will turn to Canada's emerging
corporate debt market for capital, analysts said, using more
high-risk issues than have previously been offered in Canada.
<p>
   ``With rates so low and government supply on the decline,
investors have been clamoring for more product and higher yield,''
said Paul Hancock, a portfolio manager with Investors Group Inc. in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
<p>
   So far this year, as much as C$18.5 billion of corporate bonds
have been sold in Canada, surpassing last year's record of C$15.6
billion, according to the Investment Dealers' Association of
Canada.
<p>
   That figure should top C$20 billion by year's end, bringing the
total amount of corporate debt outstanding to more than C$100
billion.
<p>
   Much of that has been junk -- debt with an official rating of
``BB'' or lower. Junk bonds, which are more common in the larger
U.S. debt market, pay higher yields than other securities because
the company selling them is considered at more risk than a bank,
utility or the government.
<p>
   Traditionally, banks and utilities were the largest and often
the only corporate borrowers in Canada because few investors were
willing to buy anything riskier than government issues.
<p>
   In the last two years, though, as yields on government bonds
have dipped to record lows, Canadian companies have turned their
attention to Canadian investors who are seeking higher yields --and
are willing to take greater investment risks than in the past to
get them.
<p>
   ``We like to say, `the sun, the moon and the stars have all
lined up,''' said Al Mawani, chief financial officer of Oxford
Properties Group Inc. Oxford recently raised C$100 million by
selling six-year, 6.93 percent debentures. The bonds are rated
``BBB'' by Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd.
<p>
   Several factors are persuading firms that Canada, rather than
the U.S., is the No. 1 place to sell debt, Mawani said.
<p>
   For one thing, supply of Canadian government debt is rapidly
shrinking. The federal government isn't issuing new bonds and, with
a balanced budget now expected this fiscal year, dwindling supply
isn't matching rising demand. Several provinces, most notably
Alberta and Saskatchewan, are close behind.
<p>
   For another, Canada's outlook for sustained growth with subdued
inflation has made fixed-income securities increasingly attractive,
particularly issues that offer high yields.
<p>
   What's more, companies and their shareholders benefit because
the company is able to raise cash in the domestic market and avoid
losing on the exchange between Canadian and U.S. dollars.
<p>
   ``It's crucial that you get a wide variation in your portfolio,
and the more high-yield debt that's issued in Canada the easier it
is to accomplish that,'' Hancock said.
<p>
   He recently bought bonds from Call-Net Enterprises Inc., Trizec
Hahn Corp., Oxford Properties and Clearnet Communications Inc.,
among others. As much as 10 percent of his portfolio consists of
high-yield debt, or bonds with a rating of ``BB'' or lower.
<p>
   Toronto-based Clearnet recently sold C$320 million of 10-year,
11.75 percent junk bonds, the largest and most successful offering
of its kind in the country's history. The success of the issue was
unusual because the bonds don't pay any interest to holders for the
first five years.
<p>
   ``Our issue principally broke the log jam on corporate debt
issuance in Canada,'' said Robert MacFarlane, Clearnet's chief
operating officer. ``We saw the economy doing well, interest rates
at near-historic lows and pools of bond money not having government
product to buy. We took advantage of that.''
<p>
   Other Canadian companies are also joining the ranks of corporate
debt issuers.
<p>
   Dundee Bankcorp Inc., which manages investment portfolios for
mutual funds and corporate pensions, recently raised C$150 million
by selling 10-year issues at almost 100 basis points above the
10-year government bond's yield.
<p>
   ``We're locking in a loan, basically, at 6.70 percent over 10
years, which is a pretty cheap way to raise money,'' said Ray
Benzinger, Dundee's chief financial officer. ``With that kind of
rate, we think it was a pretty smart thing to do.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's raw materials price
index fell an unexpected 0.1 percent in August from July because of
lower prices for logs, copper and hogs, reaffirming economists
views that inflation remains subdued.
<p>
   Economists, who forecast an increase of 0.5 percent, said the
drop in prices is further proof that inflation in Canada is under
control at an annualized 1.8 percent.
<p>
   A 1.1 percent decline in animal and animal product prices and a
2.9 percent drop in wood prices accounted for most of the decrease,
Statistics Canada said. Hog prices alone fell 4.5 percent from July
and copper prices fell 6.5 percent from the previous month.
<p>
   ``This confirms that inflation is dead in the water,'' said Rob
Palombi, economist at Toronto's MMS International. ``There is
reason for the Bank of Canada to stay on hold (with interest rates)
until they see a decrease in the unemployment rate.'' Canada's
jobless rate stands at 9 percent; the next labor force report is
scheduled Oct. 10. ``There is always a drop in pork prices in
summer'' because of consumers' changing eating patterns, said
Charles Gagne, economist with the Quebec Federation of Pork
Producers. Pork Prices Low
The U.S. pork market, the primary destination of Canada's
production, remains strong and falling prices in the U.S. are
taking down Canadian prices, he said.
<p>
   ``Our prices dropped significantly this summer,'' said Marion
Myers, a hog producer in Dalkeith, Ontario, 100 kilometers (60
miles) east of Ottawa. ``When export prices drop the whole market
sees prices fall.''
<p>
   The drop in log prices was because of oversupply, mainly a large
inventory of fir on the U.S. west coast. Log prices fell 3.8
percent from the previous month.
<p>
   These decreases were partly offset by a 2.2 percent increase in
mineral fuel prices and a 0.7 percent increase in ferrous material
prices.
<p>
   Crude oil prices, which gained 2.4 percent on the month, were
still 7.5 percent lower than the year-earlier period.
<p>
   The raw material price index was at 133.3 in August, down 2.8
percent from the year-earlier month. Excluding mineral fuels, the
index fell 1.1 percent in August to 139.5. The index was 100 in
1986.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose as bonds
recaptured some of yesterday's loss on signs of growth with little
inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. and
Eastman Kodak Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 63.12, or
0.8 percent, to 7911.13. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained
6.17, or 0.7 percent, to 944.08, led by banks.
<p>
   Banks in particular benefit from lower interest rates, as they
boost demand for loans. Steady growing companies like drugmakers
are attractive as bond yields become less competitive.
<p>
   Even after today's rise, the Dow average was little changed for
the week. Stocks may be stuck in a narrow band without further
gains in the bond market, investors said.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent, about where it was on Monday. Its 52-week
low of 6.30 percent was reached on July 31.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.14, or 0.07 percent, to
1680.03, losing a 9.98-point gain, as Microsoft Corp. declined 3/4
to 132.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after the government said the economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported, without
speeding up inflation.
<p>
   Perhaps more than profits and interest rates, the strength of
the U.S. currency provides the best hint as to the path of stocks
in coming weeks and months, said Kenneth L. Fisher, president of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, California, with $1.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   U.S. stocks attracted foreign investors in the past year as the
dollar rose 16 percent against the German mark, the benchmark
currency for Europe. The Dow industrials climbed 35 percent in that
period; what's more, the dollar and the Dow rose in tandem 60
percent of the time.
<p>
   A pickup in Europe's economy could weaken the dollar and signal
the end of the past few year's unprecedented gains in U.S. stocks,
especially large companies such as General Electric Co. The dollar
and the Dow both peaked Aug. 6; since then, the dollar has dropped
6.5 percent against the mark and the Dow is down 4.3 percent.
<p>
   Fisher said he is sticking for now with his ownership of the
biggest, most international U.S. companies, such as DuPont Co. and
Merck &AMP; Co. If he sees signs of growth oversees, he would expand
his holdings of non-U.S. superstars like Siemens AG and Sony Corp.
It would be his biggest portfolio change in three years, he said.
<p>
   ``The explanation in the weeks ahead will come out of keeping an
eye on the dollar,'' he said.
<p>
   Even with the August slump, the Dow has gained 3.1 percent for
the quarter ending Tuesday, up from the second quarter's 2.7
percent. The S&AMP;P 500 is up 6.7 percent, the Nasdaq soared 16
percent and the Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks gained 13
percent.
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting that the current
quarter's earnings may be weaker than expected.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 8 1/4 to 25 1/4.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, said
it could report a loss of 12 cents to 18 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the
year-ago period. Bridgeport fell 1 1/4 to 10 1/4.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 1 1/6 to 57 1/2 after saying it
expects third-quarter earnings of about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected, and
declined 13/16 to 19 3/8.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, fell 3 3/8 to 10 after warning
that it expects third-quarter earnings to be about 50 percent to 60
percent less than the year-ago 51 cents a share because of
production and shipment delays.
<p>
   Darden Restaurants Inc., which operates the Olive Garden, Red
Lobster and Bahama Breeze chains, reported profit a penny better
than the average estimate of 15 cents. Darden rose 1/2 to 10 13/16.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 3
1/2 to 26 1/2, after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its investment
rating to ``neutral.'' Cymer has fallen 43 percent in September on
concern growth is slowing.
<p>
   Kodak rose 1 1/2 to 63 15/16 after announcing it would fire
about 10 percent of its clerical staff and 20 percent of its
managers, in a move to boost profits.
<p>
   3M gained 2 7/16 to 90 1/4 after Cowen &AMP; Co. raised its
investment opinion from ``neutral'' to ``strong buy.''

<p>
   Houston, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Kirby Corp. said its
third-quarter earnings and revenue will fall below forecasts as an
oversupply of barges to transport oil and fuel offshore has reduced
demand and cut prices.
<p>
   Houston-based Kirby said it expects earnings of 24 cents to 26
cents a share, below the 33-cent-a-share average forecast from five
analysts polled by First Call.
<p>
   The company also said revenue will range from $97 million to
$100 million, below expectations of $102 million to $105 million.
<p>
   Kirby shares fell 3/4 to 19 7/16 in trading.
<p>
   Kirby is evaluating options for its fleet of seven tanker barges
because of excess capacity in the market. Options include a
possible sale of the tankers, which were acquired in 1992 and 1993.
Kirby has no timetable for a decision on the fleet, said Steve
Holcomb, company controller.
<p>
   Third-quarter earnings also will be reduced by higher labor and
shipyard costs and lower volumes of gasoline, heating oil and
liquid fertilizers transported on its inland barges, Holcomb said.
The company will report earnings Oct. 22.
<p>
   Kirby operates about 500 inland tank barges, the largest such
fleet in the U.S., transporting industrial and agricultural
chemicals along the Mississippi River system and the Gulf
Intercoastal Waterway. It runs a smaller barge fleet that hauls
crude oil and related products offshore, and sells and repairs
diesel engines.
<p>
   ``We are disappointed in our expected results but, looking
forward, we believe our cost-reduction program will allow us to
increase our margins, and we expect the inland tank barge business
will improve,'' said Joe Pyne, Kirby chief executive.
<p>
   The company expects to save 30 cents to 40 cents a share over
three years as it identifies areas to trim operating costs.

<p>
   Manchester, England, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal-Mogul Corp.
said it wants to buy U.K. auto parts company T&AMP;N Plc for about 1.51
billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in cash and assumed debt, in a bid to
offer a broader range of products to its customers.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it received an initial offer from Southfield,
Michigan-based Federal-Mogul of 235 pence a share, or 1.25 billion
pounds, representing a premium of 29 percent over T&AMP;N's closing
price yesterday. A spokesman for T&AMP;N, which is considering the
approach, declined to comment further.
<p>
   The stock climbed 60.5 pence to 242.5 pence in London,
indicating investors expect Federal-Mogul will have to bid more.
Federal-Mogul shares rose 3 1/4 to 36 3/4 in midday trading in New
York.
<p>
   The move follows a $650 million offer by Blackstone Group for
American Axle &AMP; Manufacturing Inc. earlier today, and is the latest
step in the consolidation of the world's auto parts industry as
customers demand fewer suppliers with a wider range of products.
For Federal-Mogul, the purchase would build its leadership in
engine parts such as bearings and seals, and marry T&AMP;N's expertise
in brake pads and pistons.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ``In one fell swoop
they could accomplish a lot in terms of getting towards their
goal.''
<p>
   Analysts said T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of
asbestos, has been vulnerable to a bid since it took a 373
million-pound charge last year to cover it against future liability
from asbestos litigation.

   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid of about 260 pence, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.

<p>
   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Cognos Inc. shares rose as much
as 11 percent, regaining some of the 32 percent drop that was
triggered yesterday when the software maker said growth will slow
because customers may delay purchases to consider buying rival
programs.
<p>
   Cognos climbed C$2.70 (US$2) to C$32.20 in early afternoon
Toronto trading of 2.41 million shares, more than 26 times the full
day three-month day average of 92,400. Earlier, the shares reached
C$34. On Nasdaq, the shares rose 1 15/16 to 24.
<p>
   Cognos warned investors about ``moderate growth'' in the next
few quarters after the markets closed Wednesday as it reported
fiscal second-quarter profit jumped 47 percent.
<p>
   ``You can now buy a very good company with a very good product
line and an exceptional management group at 35 percent cheaper than
two days ago,'' said Richard Piotrowski, an analyst with Mesirow
Financial in Chicago.
<p>
   Although Cognos reported record profit, investors dumped the
shares amid concern the company's customers may switch to new
software that lets them access and analyze information via the
Internet instead of through corporate networks.
<p>
   After the market for the type of software made by Cognos
stabilizes, Piotrowski said Cognos will emerge in a strong position
because it has a strong product portfolio and brand equity with
executives who purchase technology for corporations.
<p>
   Cognos's two main programs, PowerPlay and Impromptu, are used by
salesmen and managers to analyze information by category,
geographical region or price. The company's rivals include
Paris-based Business Objects SA and Redwood Shores,
California-based Oracle Corp.
<p>
   Analysts were looking for Cognos's revenue in the fiscal third
and fourth quarters to increase about 30 percent. Instead, the
company said it expects sales to rise 20 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
   Cognos said its fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed to US$11
million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31, from
US$7.5 million, or 16 cents, in the year-earlier period. Revenue
rose 26 percent to US$58 million from US$46.1 million. Cognos
reports in U.S. dollars.
<p>
   ``We will have strong profit and strong positive cash flow,''
said Alan Rottenberg, head of marketing and business strategy with
Cognos. ``All the underlying fundamentals of our business are still
very strong.''

 &UR; SALOMON'S TOP EXECS MAY BE BETTER OFF OWNING TRAVELERS STOCK &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Salomon Inc.'s top executives
will own Travelers Group Inc. shares worth $65 million after
Travelers buys Salomon, swapping stock of a volatile bond trading
firm for one of the best performing financial companies.
<p>
   Deryck Maughan, chairman of Salomon's investment banking unit,
will swap his 348,425 shares of Salomon stock listed in the firm's
most recent proxy statement and subsequent regulatory filings and
worth $24.9 million the day before the acquisition, for Travelers
shares worth $27 million.
<p>
   John Haseltine, who stepped down as head of fixed income late
last year but remains on Salomon's board, is swapping his 252,606
Salomon shares, worth $18.1 million before the transaction, for
Travelers shares worth $19.6 million.
<p>
   Shigeru Myojin, head of the Salomon unit that trades securities
for the firm's own account and one of the highest paid executives
on Wall Street, will own Travelers shares worth $11.5 million.
<p>
   ``They're probably much better off owning Travelers than owing
Salomon shares,'' said John Keefe, an independent securities
analyst. ``The market loves Sandy Weill and gives him the benefit
of the doubt.''
<p>
   Travelers Chairman Sanford Weill, a leading executive on Wall
Street for more than 30 years, built Travelers into a company with
1996 net income of $2.33 billion. His firm, a New York-based
insurer, broker and consumer finance company, agreed to buy Salomon
for about $9 billion in stock Wednesday, paying 1.13 of its shares
for each Salomon share.
<p>
   The transaction will create the second-largest U.S. securities
firm and a financial services powerhouse.
<p>
   Salomon executives will own Travelers shares that rose an
average 45.3 percent a year over the past five years, compared with
19.8 percent annually for the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index. Salomon
stock, by contrast, rose 11.5 percent annually in the same period.
<p>
   Salomon is among Wall Street's most volatile companies because
it derives much of its profit from trading bonds using its own
capital. After losing $399 million in 1994, the worst year for
bonds in a generation, the firm earned $457 million in 1995 and
$617 million last year.
<p>
   Investors penalized Salomon for that volatility. The firm's
shares trade at a multiple of 11.7 times earnings after the shares
rose following announcement of Salomon's sale. Meantime, investors
reward Travelers with a higher multiple of 18 times earnings.
<p>
   Salomon executives did get big paychecks last year even without
the benefit of Travelers stock. The firm paid Myojin, nicknamed
``Sugar,'' $31.4 million in salary, bonus, deferred compensation
and stock. His compensation is tied to Salomon's proprietary
trading profits.
<p>
   Maughan got $11.5 million, including his first bonus in three
years, as Salomon's securities firm almost doubled its pretax
earnings.
<p>
   Travelers paid Weill $8.9 million in salary, bonus, stock and
other compensation last year after the company had its best year
ever.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Montreal, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Air Canada, following the lead
of U.S. carriers, said it will cut commissions paid to travel
agents on tickets purchased for all international flights in a bid
to cut costs.
<p>
   Canada's largest airline said agents will earn an 8 percent base
rate with a maximum payment of C$70 (US$50.40) for return tickets
on all flights between Canada and the U.S. The maximum payout for
one-way flights will be C$35.
<p>
   Montreal-based Air Canada said the new base rate also will apply
to flights to countries besides the U.S. although no maximum
payment amounts are set. Commissions on tickets for flights within
Canada are unchanged, it said.
<p>
   ``Air Canada must reduce commissions expenses on transborder and
international sales in order to remain cost competitive,'' said
Marc Rosenberg, the carrier's vice president of sales and product
distribution.
<p>
   The rate change will take effect on Nov. 1, the airline said.
<p>
   Air Canada shares rose C$0.05 to C$12.45 in early afternoon
Toronto trading.
<p>
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines last week cut agent commissions to 8
percent from 10 percent in a bid to cut costs. This week Delta Air
Lines Inc. and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines matched the cut.

<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Chinese are committed to
continuing the process of economic reform, President Jiang Zemin
told U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin today.
<p>
   Rubin, who brought a letter from President Bill Clinton,
exchanged views with Jiang on the economy, trade and human rights
in a wide-ranging, one-hour discussion amid the red pagodas of the
leader's compound in the Forbidden City.
<p>
   Jiang, Rubin said, was ``spirited'' in his descriptions of how
and why China's Communist Party decided to sell off thousands of
state-owned enterprises.
<p>
   ``He really gave us a sense that he has a real vision and a very
strong vision about the direction he feels the country needs to
move with respect to the broad range of economic issues,'' Rubin
told reporters following the meeting.
<p>
   Jiang announced at last week's 15th Party Congress that over the
next three years the government will convert most of China's
305,000 state companies, employing 100 million workers, into
shareholder-owned corporations.
<p>
   The Chinese leader told Rubin that the proclamation represented
``a move towards a more competitive, more market-based economy''
the secretary said.
<p>
   That means hundreds of thousands of businesses will be forced to
improve efficiency or go bankrupt, which could cost tens of
millions of workers their jobs.
<p>
   Though the economy is growing around 10 percent a year, that's
not even fast enough to absorb the existing labor pool. Officially
the unemployment rate in China is 3 percent; unofficial estimates
place it as high as 10 percent.
<p>
   Jiang, Rubin said, ``clearly recognized'' this is a very
significant change, ``and change is not easy.'' Nevertheless, ``he
was trying to get across to us that this was a deep commitment, a
deep and irreversible commitment.''
<p>
   That doesn't mean China will become an open economy overnight,
Rubin said. Rather, ``their vision is of opening China economically
to the global economy at a pace that is consistent with their
circumstances,'' he said.
<p>
   `` I don't think it was clear from what he said how much state
ownership he envisions remaining.'' Rubin pushed the Chinese to
move faster, particularly in eliminating the trade barriers that
are keeping the country out of the World Trade Organization.
Negotiations on WTO trade terms stalled this week when officials
from the U.S. Trade Representative's office rejected a new Chinese
offer that cut tariffs an average of just 1 percent, on only 290 of
6,000 tariff items.
<p>
   ``What I tried to do with both Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the
president was to bring up the WTO and in our view at least, the
importance of WTO for China's own development,'' he said, ``as a
way of trying to engage them in their own government in helping
create momentum and movement forward.''
<p>
   He got little response, Rubin said, particularly from Jiang. ``I
had the opportunity to fully make my argument, and I would say they
took it under advisement,'' Rubin said.
<p>
   Rubin also suggested to the Chinese that they should consider
slowing the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. At $131
billion, China has one of the largest reserves in the world. Some
of that, the secretary said, could be better spent on capital
projects, or invested at higher rates of return.
<p>
   The Chinese didn't appear shaken by the recent problems in
Southeast Asia, Rubin said. ``I think I would say they are very
cognizant of what's happened in Southeast Asia and they are
factoring that in as they consider the pace at which they want to
open up their capital account,'' Rubin said.
<p>
   ``I think they are still working through in their own minds how
to evaluate this, because I think they feel very secure with their
level of reserves.''
<p>
   Lower reserves would ease China's growing trade surplus with the
U.S. Rubin said he told Zhu that the trade imbalance is ``becoming
a political problem'' for the administration, which stood up to
congressional pressure in renewing China's Most Favored Nation
trade status this year.
<p>
   The more China opens its markets, the more U.S. companies will
be able to sell there. In his meetings with Jiang, and Zhu, Rubin
said he lobbied for American firms in general, and the Boeing Co.
in particular. Boeing is in the process of negotiating some $2
billion in civilian aircraft sales to China.
<p>
   ``I did not sell Boeing airplanes,'' Rubin said. ``I did . . .
raise in an appropriate fashion our interest in moving forward with
respect to the Boeing airplane sales.''
<p>
   At the same time, the secretary said he was also selling
himself, and the Clinton administration. The U.S. and China have
not had a close relationship over the past decade, leading to
frequent misunderstandings about goals and intentions.
<p>
   ``I think we are developing the kind of relationship now with
their ministry of finance that we've had with a number of other key
countries,'' Rubin said.
<p>
   In his two days of meetings with senior Chinese officials, the
two sides didn't ``sit and read pieces of paper at each other,''
Rubin said. Instead, they ``actually had real and serious
discussions.''
<p>
   ``This is the kind of thing we should have done years ago.''

corporate America is about to crumble. CD sales continue to drop,
attendance at large concert venues is down all over the country,

with a major label. Smaller labels also are hurting because record
stores only want quantities of CDs that will sell quickly. But the

<p>
   Companies have been so focused on getting rid of workers in an
era of downsizing that some have forgotten how to hang on to them
when they need to.
<p>
   The result is that many companies are now facing a crisis quite
opposite one they wrestled with a few years ago. Rather than
trimming the payroll to beef up profitability in the short term,
they need to keep more people on board to prevent their bottom
lines from taking a dive.
<p>
   But that's trickier to do in a work environment in which workers
have begun to discover they have power and choices.
<p>
   Unemployment is at all-time lows, and so is loyalty, said Lynn
Ware, president of Integral Training Systems, a national consulting
and training firm based in the San Francisco Bay area. Companies,
particularly technology-based ones, have been coming to firms such
as hers to relearn the principles of employee retention.
<p>
   ``There's a wave beginning to happen,'' said Ware, who has
noticed heightened awareness of this issue in the past year.
``Companies realize they to have to be concerned about people
leaving.'' In the information-technology industry, for example, one
in 10 positions is open, she said. And people report that they are
being called at least once or twice a week by headhunters. One
database company called when it realized it was costing it $70,000
every time it had to replace a $48,000 employee.
<p>
   A year ago, Ware was still running across the persistent
attitude that ``there are always people standing at the door to
replace those that leave,'' she said. In addition, employers had
the mind-set that attrition was inevitable and they couldn't do
anything about it, she said. ``They figured, why bother?''
<p>
   But cutting attrition rates by even a few percent ``can be a
phenomenal drop to the bottom line,'' Ware said. It saves companies
money directly by reducing the costs of training, recruiting and
relocating new employees.
<p>
   It also results in indirect savings. People who are leaving tend
to be less productive, she said. And vacant positions represent
lost opportunities.
<p>
   There are steps companies can take to bolster retention. ``Up to
75 percent of why people are not staying has to do with factors
that are in the control of managers,'' Ware said.
<p>
   There are several factors that correlate with employee
commitment.
<p>
   The first is achievement. ``People don't want to stay where they
feel like they're losing,'' she said.
<p>
   People need a sense that they are winning at their job. Managers
should take care to make sure they are tailoring assignments to
insure a good fit between a person's skills and the project or
task, she said.
<p>
   Another factor important in keeping people is to make sure they
feel they are continually gaining in ``employability.'' That means
giving them opportunities to learn new skills through training or
projects. Mentoring programs are also a good way to give people a
sense that they are moving forward in their job.
<p>
   Managers need to take care to understand the career aspirations
of their workers and help them develop, she said.
<p>
   For the past decade, workers have been so terrified of losing
their jobs, they have taken to heart the message that their career
survival depends on continuous improvement, she said.
<p>
   Indeed, in a recent Towers Perrin study of 2,500 employees, 94
percent agreed it was their responsibility to remain employable by
continually learning new job skills. That's a 180-degree turnaround
from traditional expectations of the lifetime security contract,
said Steve Bookbinder, principal and leader of the Towers Perrin
Workplace Index research.
<p>
   Now, however, workers are also demanding that their performance
be recognized, and that they get something out of keeping their end
of the bargain. One of the first steps companies can take to
improve retention is to recognize the warning signs that people are
about to leave.
<p>
   Any subtle change in behavior patterns can be a tip-off. For
example, the normally prompt person who starts coming in later and
missing deadlines, or the non-complainer who starts expressing
discontent may be at risk for leaving.
<p>
   There are also windows in people's work lives when they are more
likely to jump. The end of a project is a natural time for
re-evaluation and transition. Similarly, someone in a sales slump
can be particularly vulnerable to an outside offer.
<p>
   The biggest misconception many employers still have about
retention is that it's a financial issue, she said. But in study
after study, money (as long as it's competitive) comes in about
third in reasons for job satisfaction.
<p>
   The top two influences on job satisfaction are always management
supervisory practices and career-advancement opportunities, she
said.
<p>
   In the end, it's pretty simple, she said. ``People don't leave
if they have the perception they'll do better if they stay.''

<p>
   Waukegan, Illinois, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Outboard Marine
Corp. named David Jones Jr. president and chief executive officer,
replacing Harry Bowman, who stepped down yesterday after an
investor group won a takeover battle for the struggling boatmaker.
<p>
   Jones served as president of Brunswick Corp.'s Mercury Marine
division from December 1989 until last month. Before that, he was
general manager of Force Outboard, another Brunswick division , for
four years.
<p>
   The change comes less than two weeks after Greenmarine
Acquisition Corp. won the battle for the maker or Chris-Craft boats
and Evinrude engines. Alfred Kingsley, senior managing director of
Greenmarine affiliate Greenway Partners, replaced Bowman as
chairman yesterday.
<p>
   ``We are very confident that David will successfully lead the
management of Outboard Marine and return it to profitability,''
Kingsley said in a statement.
<p>
   Outboard Marine lost $7.3 million, or 36 cents a share, in the
fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1996. The Waukegan, Illinois-based
company is expected to report a fiscal 1997 loss of 71 cents a
share, according to the average estimate of three analysts in an
IBES International Inc. survey.
<p>
   Greenmarine announced Sept. 12 that it got 91 percent of
Outboard Marine's shares in its tender offer of $364 million, or
$18 a share. That prompted Detroit Diesel Corp., Outboard's
preferred suitor, to drop its $16-a-share bid.
<p>
   Greenmarine's offer was backed by two investment groups
associated with Soros Fund Management LLC.

   If the music industry is any indication, corporate America is
about to crumble. CD sales continue to drop, attendance at large
concert venues is down all over the country, and it is no longer an
advantage for a band to have a record deal with a major label.
Smaller labels also are hurting because record stores only want
quantities of CDs that will sell quickly.
<p>
   But the Artist Formerly Known as Prince, now simply called The
Artist, thinks he has a solution for musicians: the Internet. To
prove his point, The Artist does interviews via e-mail.
<p>
   ``The Internet is the new music industry!'' he wrote. ``Music 2
me is a form of in4mation. Y not B on the in4mation super
highway?''
<p>
   The Artist went high-tech after the demise of his label, EMI
Records, earlier this year. Now the releases from his NRG label are
only distributed via phone  &MD;  800-639-3865  &MD;  or the Internet  &MD; 
http://www.love4oneanother.com. However, he has not yet found a way
to project his funky R&AMP;B concerts through phone lines and therefore
must continue to tour. The Artist and his band play The Gorge
tomorrow night.
<p>
   When The Artist was released from the corporate music business,
he was soaring on the reputation of last year's three-CD set
``Emancipation,'' which in three hours of music spans lean funk,
ambient rock, gospel roots and the many hues of rhythm and blues.
The set is phenomenal not only in its absorption, synthesis and
fresh take on the sounds of Marvin Gaye, George Clinton, Bonnie
Raitt and Sister Rosetta Tharp, but also in its rekindling of the
steamy sensuality of '50s soul and '60s rock 'n' roll.
<p>
   Without a hint of the overwrought singing of today's pop radio,
The Artist uses his falsetto to tease, please and party. Sometimes
it's innocent, sometimes jaded, and often hedonistic.
<p>
   The Artist's next release also will be a three-CD volume,
``Crystal Ball'' ($50). The set will feature new music, as well as
what he calls ``underground classics'' such as ``Sexual Suicide''
and ``18 and Over.'' Those who buy the release also will get a free
CD, ``The Truth,'' which is an acoustic set.
<p>
   `` `The Truth' best captured the mood I was in at the time,''
The Artist wrote. ``I needed a lot of questions answered, and the
sparity (sic) of sound was most reflective. As we near 1999, I will
be adding songs culled from `The Truth.' ''
<p>
   The acoustic disc is also a reflection of his disdain for much
of corporate music generated today. Referring to labels as
``capitalist dinosaurs,'' The Artist condemns the system but stops
short of calling for an end to it.
<p>
   ``Pop music is a star collapsing on itself. Kids 2day sample and
call themselves musicians,'' The Artist wrote. ``The music business
has its place, but in it there's no place 4 me.''
<p>
   Born Prince Rogers Nelson in 1958 in Minneapolis, The Artist
began playing piano with his father's jazz band (his mother was the
vocalist) when he was 7. The child also taught himself to play
guitar and drums, and by the time he turned 20 he had a recording
deal with Warner Bros. His first two releases, ``For You'' and
``Prince,'' reflected The Artist's panoramic views of music and
sexuality.
<p>
   Nothing was sacred on his next recording, 1980's ``Dirty Mind.''
With lots of nasty language and topics ranging from oral copulation
to incest, The Artist put sex above success because most of the
tunes couldn't be played on the radio. In concert he would strip
down to his underwear and simulate sex on a brass bed.
<p>
   Though parents were alarmed and critics suspicious of his
sensationalistic lyrics and shocking performances, it was The
Artist's music that carried him through the '80s. He had a way of
building tunes around hooks, such as ``Little Red Corvette,'' and a
feel for the dance floor on hits like ``Nasty Girl'' and ``Let's Go
Crazy.'' But he also whispered, often cushioned in neo-psychedelic
or funk sounds, about his inner soul on tunes like ``I Would Die 4
U'' and ``When Doves Cry.''
<p>
   The Artist also went into the movie business to illustrate his
music. Both the film and soundtrack to ``Purple Rain'' were huge
successes. The record topped the charts for 24 weeks, sold 10
million copies and garnered a 1985 Grammy and an Oscar for ``When
Doves Cry.'' It also turned Prince into a household name.
<p>
   But not all mothers invited The Artist to stay for dinner.
Tipper Gore credits ``Darling Nikki,'' a cut from the soundtrack
that alludes to masturbation, for inspiring the censorship group
Parents Music Resource Center and the Senate hearings on offensive
lyrics.
<p>
   Gore may have won the battle by strong-arming the recording
industry into using ``voluntary'' stickers to connote that some
lyrics may be offensive to some people, but she did not silence The
Artist. Not only has he continued to be popular, he put Minneapolis
on the pop music map by opening a studio there and producing local
groups such as the Time and Vanity 6. He also has written and/or
produced hits for several artists, including Sheila E, Chaka Khan
and Sheena Easton.
<p>
   Not all of The Artist's efforts have been a success. Both
``Under the Cherry Moon'' and ``Graffiti Bridge'' bombed as films,
and during the '90s he has spent more time bickering with record
companies than making hits.
<p>
   But The Artist seems undaunted by either bad business alliances
or poorly received records. Nor is he concerned about the isolation
of nothing but Internet interaction.
<p>
   In response to the suggestion that he may be isolating himself
by only working through the Net, The Artist has decided to tour and
``party like it's 1999.'' But there won't be brass beds, elaborate
sets and extraneous sounds in the shows.
<p>
   ``My concerts R stripped down 2 the bare essentials  &MD;  in
response 2 those who are, as George Clinton says, `FAKIN' THE
FUNK','' The Artist wrote.
<p>
   His e-mail closes with his motto, ``Peace and B wild.''

   1. TIME MAGAZINE ON THE BEST NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA
<p>
   Time had glowing praise for The New York Times in its Sept. 29
issue: ``The Times has the largest editorial staff, spends more
money on newsgathering and has won more Pulitzer Prizes (74) than
any other paper in the country...For the comprehensiveness and

comes close.''

for The Dayton Daily News and the Cox News Service Washington
bureau will begin moving on Friday, Oct. 3. The first installment

   5. ON THE EDUCATION FRONT
<p>
   The Thursday feature advisory about children and family life
includes a section on education stories, and this week, we have
some particularly good offerings. A Page One story in The New York
Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''
<p>

<p>
   Radnor, Pennsylania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Pegasus
Communications Corp. said it will buy 10 DirecTV satellite-TV
franchises for about $47.8 million in cash, stock and deferred
payments as it expands in the rural satellite-broadcast market.
<p>
   The cable television and media company said it will pay $40.7
million in cash, $6.38 million in Class A common stock and $725,000
in deferred payments for the independent franchises, which serve
23,400 households in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest.
<p>
   Pegasus is growing largely in the countryside, where the
penetration of direct-broadcast satellite systems is as much as
five times higher than in metropolitan areas where other
video-delivery systems, such as cable TV, are readily available. It
owns the rights to DirecTV services in 27 states and has about
125,000 subscribers.
<p>
   DirecTV is a unit of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics
unit. The service uses satellites to beam programming to homes.
Franchisees buy the right to sell that programming through home
satellite dish antennas.
<p>
   Shares of Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Pegasus rose 1 1/8 to 17
7/8 in early afternoon trading.

   5. ON THE EDUCATION FRONT
<p>
   The Thursday feature advisory about children and family life
includes a section on education stories, and this week, we have
some particularly good offerings. A Page One story in The New York
Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''

   1. TIME MAGAZINE ON THE BEST NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA
<p>
   Time had glowing praise for The New York Times in its Sept. 29
issue: ``The Times has the largest editorial staff, spends more
money on newsgathering and has won more Pulitzer Prizes (74) than
any other paper in the country...For the comprehensiveness and
astuteness of its journalism, top to bottom, no other paper even
comes close.''
<p>
   Our New York Times News Service clients, who receive virtually
the entire newspaper every day, including The Times' columnists, of
course benefit from this journalistic excellence and from the
distinctive regional perspectives of our partner news
organizations. If you'd like to discuss how we can better serve
you, please contact Lila Locksley, the associate editor, at
212-556-7064.
<p>
   2. FALL EQUINOX TO PRODUCE SATELLITE INTERFERENCE
<p>
   Service to some News Service clients who rely on our AP

   Honolulu: Sept. 28-Oct. 3 from approximately 9 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.
each day.
<p>
   San Juan: Sept. 28-Oct. 3 from approximately 5:45 p.m. to 6 p.m.

   1. TIME MAGAZINE ON THE BEST NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA
<p>
   Time had glowing praise for The New York Times in its Sept. 29
issue: ``The Times has the largest editorial staff, spends more
money on newsgathering and has won more Pulitzer Prizes (74) than
any other paper in the country...For the comprehensiveness and
astuteness of its journalism, top to bottom, no other paper even
comes close.''
<p>
   Our New York Times News Service clients, who receive virtually
the entire newspaper every day, including The Times' columnists, of
course benefit from this journalistic excellence and from the
distinctive regional perspectives of our partner news
organizations. If you'd like to discuss how we can better serve
you, please contact Lila Locksley, the associate editor, at
212-556-7064.

   3. BLOOMBERG'S INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
<p>
   Bloomberg News has moved a package of 38 stories reviewing the
performance and outlook for selected industries in North America
and world markets in the third quarter. Stories are 800-900 words

<p>
   A yearlong investigation of doctors in the military by reporters
for The Dayton Daily News and the Cox News Service Washington
bureau will begin moving on Friday, Oct. 3. The first installment
will carry an embargo for release on Sunday, Oct. 5.
<p>
   The series explores America's flawed and sometimes deadly system
of military medicine that puts U.S. armed forces at risk far from
the battlefield.
<p>
   The series will be slugged with the keyword ``MILMED.'' Photos
and graphics will be available.
<p>
   For more information, contact Andy Alexander, deputy chief of
Cox Newspapers' Washington Bureau, at 202-887-8334.
<p>
   5. ON THE EDUCATION FRONT
<p>
   The Thursday feature advisory about children and family life
includes a section on education stories, and this week, we have
some particularly good offerings. A Page One story in The New York
Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''
<p>
   For repeats of any of these stories, call 212-556-1927.

 &UR; MANNING IS YET TO BOWL 'EM OVER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK BLAUDSCHUN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Some people think Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning may have
damaged his Heisman Trophy chances in last week's 33-20 loss to
Florida.
<p>
   In the words of that famous poet and sage of the Northeast,
Donnie Brasco, ``Forget about it.''
<p>
   It's not that Manning has overwhelmed the field. He has not. But
he's been pretty consistent and is an excellent college quarterback
who will be a superb NFL quarterback if drafted by the right team.
<p>
   No, he doesn't have a cannon arm. But he has instincts and
quickness and the ability to adjust if he receives the proper
coaching, something some people question whether he has received at
Tennessee.
<p>
   It's just that there is no one else stepping up to challenge
Manning.
<p>
   Marshall's Randy Moss? A great receiver, no question. Perhaps
the best to come out of college since Jerry Rice. But some people
will question his character, others his competition.
<p>
   Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne? Please.
<p>
   Iowa's Tavian Banks? Hasn't played anyone yet. Too early to
tell.
<p>
   Penn State running back Curt Enis? Penn State coach Joe Paterno
won't let him loose to get the numbers he needs.
<p>
   Michigan's Charles Woodson deserves some support for his
offensive and defensive versatility.
<p>
   And Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf, who looks more like
Drew Bledsoe than Drew Bledsoe at times, has put up some impressive
early numbers, but he needs exposure and he won't get it until it's
too late.
<p>
   It is still early, and someone could emerge. But to choose
someone other than Peyton Manning right now?
<p>
   Forget about it.
<p>
Missing the mistique &HT;    
<p>
   Don't talk to West Virginia coach  &UR; Don Nehlen  &LR; about Miami,
which has lost four of its last five games in the Orange Bowl, plus
some of its mystique. ``How would I know anything about mystique?''
said Nehlen, whose Mountaineers play the Hurricanes in Miami
Saturday. ``I know any time you play Miami in the Orange Bowl, you
better buckle up your helmets and play like the devil.'' Good
point, Don. Nehlen is 1-7 vs. Miami overall and 0-4 in the Orange
Bowl ... Florida coach  &UR; Steve Spurrier  &LR; on the Gators being a
consensus No. 1 pick in the polls this week: ``We're probably not
as great as everybody thinks, but a lot of great things keep
happening to the Gators.'' ... Central Florida, that Big East
wannabe road warrior, hits the road again Saturday, traveling to
Auburn. ``You wonder if we can keep going because there has been so
much pressure on our guys,'' said Golden Knight coach  &UR; Gene
McDowell &LR; , who has seen his team lose three close road games to
Mississippi, South Carolina, and Nebraska before coming home last
week to beat Idaho. ``But I'm optimstic. We have a great group of
coaches and players who truly understand we've got to play hard for
every minute of every game.'' For their efforts, the Golden Knights
will get paid approximately $1.4 million this season ... Why
doesn't North Carolina coach  &UR; Mack Brown  &LR; admit it and make  &UR; Oscar
Davenport  &LR; the Tar Heels' starting quarterback instead of dealing
with the charade of naming Davenport and  &UR; Chris Keldorf &LR; 
co-starters? Davenport has clearly played better thus far ...
Colorado resumes its season against Wyoming Saturday after taking a
week off following its embarrassing loss to Michigan. ``When you
get beat in the fashion we were beaten at Michigan (27-3), you do a
lot of soul-searching,'' said Colorado coach  &UR; Rick Neuheisel &LR; .
``You do a lot of wondering why. You do a lot of trying to figure
out what's the best tack to take.'' Neuheisel knows he has some
rebuilding to do in terms of confidence. ``I want to get our
attitude to the point where we feel good about ourselves and to the
point where we can't wait to go out there and improve every day,''
he said. ``If we put our heads in the sand, we don't have any
chance of fixing what's wrong.''
<p>
Husker innovation &HT;    
<p>
   Nebraska may not be as good as the school's national
championship teams of 1994 and 1995, but the coaching staff may be
better. The staff designed two plays against Washington that the
Huskers had not used in their first two games: a quarterback draw
by  &UR; Scott Frost  &LR; and an option run on which Frost fakes to the
fullback and then follows the I-back into an inside hole. Both went
for touchdowns (34 and 30 yards) ... In the crowd at last
Saturday's Washington-Nebraska game were Omaha billionire  &UR; Warren
Buffet  &LR; and Microsoft's  &UR; Bill Gates &LR; . Let's see, if you took both
of those men's worth and included them in the attendance for the
game (74,023), the average income for each person would be $1.3
million a year. Buffet and Gates had a friendly bet on the game:
They put up their houses. Only problem was that Buffet lives in a
house he bought in Omaha in the 1950s for $31,000, while Gates has
a state-of-the-art house near Seattle worth $43 million. It is
unlikely Gates will pay off ... In the last two years, the Big 12
is 2-10 against ranked nonconference opponents ... Wonder if
Alabama offensive coordinator  &UR; Bruce Arians  &LR; is in trouble. Listen
to first-year head coach  &UR; Mike DuBose  &LR; following the Tide's 17-16
loss to Arkansas: ``I was extremely disappointed with the offense.
We did not perform well. We're basically predictable. All the
movement we're doing is confusing us more than it's confusing the
defense.'' ... Is it The System that helps Florida win year after
year under Spurrier or is it the players Spurrier gets? Florida
lineman  &UR; Zack Piller  &LR; has an opinion. ``When you have somebody like
him calling the plays, I could get my grandmother's art class and
go out there and do pretty well against most teams. He amazes me.
He's just so much above everybody else in the country.'' ...
Kentucky sophomore quarterback  &UR; Tim Couch  &LR; threw seven TDs against
Indiana last week, tying a Southeastern Conference record. Saturday
Couch plays the varsity when the Wildcats host Florida. A similiar
performance against the Gators could push him into the national
spotlight. Couch has already thrown 15 TD passes, the most by a
Kentucky QB since 1951. ``He's a big-time prospect,'' said Spurier.
``He throws a nice catchable pass. Now he's got an offensive coach
and a system there that's going to enable him to break all the
records.''
<p>
No rah-rah guy &HT;    
<p>
   You've heard of fans being upset with coaches. How about coaches
upset with fans? Ask Ohio State coach  &UR; John Cooper  &LR; how he feels
about the Buckeye fans who have been only lukewarm in their support
of the his team so far this season. ``The whole stadium was
pathetic,'' said Cooper after Saturday's 28-20 win over Arizona.
``The coaches, the players, and the fans, they just sat on their
butts.'' ... No major changes at Notre Dame yet, but don't expect
to see Irish quarterback  &UR; Ron Powlus  &LR; run the option. Powlus is
simply too slow, so coach  &UR; Bob Davie  &LR; has taken that play out of
the playbook for Saturday's game against Michigan. The Irish will
go to more of a West Coast offense, which might be more appropriate
for next week's visit to Stanford ... Davie says he has not
contemplated a change at QB. ``Ron Powlus is still our quarterback
because I think he's competing very hard,'' Davie said. ``And I
think he gives us a better chance to win.'' In the wings is junior
 &UR; Jarius Jackson &LR; , who is an option quarterback ... We've heard of
corporate sponsors for bowl games, but what is this business coming
to when a bowl game essentially buys another bowl game? That's what
happened this week when the Fiesta Bowl created its own mini-bowl
alliance by acquiring the Copper Bowl. The Fiesta, played each year
in Tempe, Ariz., is part of the big-time Bowl Alliance, while the
Copper, played in Tucson, is a second-tier game ... Speaking of the
Fiesta Bowl, which will host the national championship game next
season, look for an invitation to either Tennessee or a Big Ten
runner-up with one of its slots. The game will be played New Year's
Eve.

   1. TIME MAGAZINE ON THE BEST NEWSPAPER IN AMERICA
<p>
   Time had glowing praise for The New York Times in its Sept. 29
issue: ``The Times has the largest editorial staff, spends more
money on newsgathering and has won more Pulitzer Prizes (74) than
any other paper in the country...For the comprehensiveness and
astuteness of its journalism, top to bottom, no other paper even
comes close.''
<p>
   Our New York Times News Service clients, who receive virtually
the entire newspaper every day, including The Times' columnists, of
course benefit from this journalistic excellence and from the
distinctive regional perspectives of our partner news
organizations. If you'd like to discuss how we can better serve
you, please contact Lila Locksley, the associate editor, at
212-556-7064.
<p>
   2. FALL EQUINOX TO PRODUCE SATELLITE INTERFERENCE
<p>
   Service to some News Service clients who rely on our AP
satellite feed may be disrupted in coming weeks because of the fall
equinox.
<p>
   When the sun and the satellite are in direct alignment, solar
interference can produce garbles and service outages.
<p>
   Here is a sampling of cities and the time period when
interference may occur:
<p>
   Honolulu: Sept. 28-Oct. 3 from approximately 9 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.
each day.
<p>
   San Juan: Sept. 28-Oct. 3 from approximately 5:45 p.m. to 6 p.m.
each day.
<p>
   Miami: Sept. 29-Oct. 6 from approximately 1:40 p.m. to 1:50 p.m.
<p>
   Atlanta: Oct. 2-Oct. 9 from approximately 5:35 p.m. to 5:50 p.m.
<p>
   Los Angeles: Oct. 2-Oct. 9 from approximately 10:20 a.m. to
10:30 a.m.
<p>
   Dallas: Oct. 2-Oct. 9 from approximately 12:30 p.m. to 12:40
p.m.

<p>
   Bloomberg News has moved a package of 38 stories reviewing the
performance and outlook for selected industries in North America
and world markets in the third quarter. Stories are 800-900 words

   4. COMING FROM COX NEWS SERVICE: MILITARY MEDICINE
<p>
   A yearlong investigation of doctors in the military by reporters
for The Dayton Daily News and the Cox News Service Washington
bureau will begin moving on Friday, Oct. 3. The first installment
will carry an embargo for release on Sunday, Oct. 5.
<p>
   The series explores America's flawed and sometimes deadly system
of military medicine that puts U.S. armed forces at risk far from
the battlefield.
<p>
   The series will be slugged with the keyword ``MILMED.'' Photos
and graphics will be available.
<p>
   For more information, contact Andy Alexander, deputy chief of
Cox Newspapers' Washington Bureau, at 202-887-8334.
<p>
   5. ON THE EDUCATION FRONT
<p>
   The Thursday feature advisory about children and family life
includes a section on education stories, and this week, we have
some particularly good offerings. A Page One story in The New York
Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''
<p>
   For repeats of any of these stories, call 212-556-1927.

 &UR; By PATRICIA SMITH &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Call off the damned jackals.
<p>
   Made drunk by blood smell, their incisors bared, the ravenous
carnivores have lately occupied themselves by gnawing at Senator
Dianne Wilkerson's newly exposed Achilles heel.
(itals)GetHerGetHerGetHer(unitals) is their breathless cry, and the
sound of lipsmacking fills the air, from the creepiest crevices of
the State House all the way up to the gilded office of Paul
``People in Glass Houses'' Cellucci.
<p>
   It is true that Lady Di was throughly, undeniably, irreversibly
busted. I'm not about to slap her five on the black-hand side,
turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to a glaring indiscretion simply
because we share the same melanin. I don't think it's her race
sparking this attack. It's the fact that, up until now, the
three-term senator has thumbed her nose at convention and
maddeningly defied her critics.
<p>
   Wilkerson is a book-learned, multisyllable kinda gal, and she
certainly knows that every mega-visible, forceful and outspoken
politico has got to sign on the dotted line come every April 15 or
squirm at the consequences. It's not a black thang, it's a tax
thang.
<p>
   But you wouldn't know that listening to her many detractors
tsk-tsking about how humiliated her peoples is, how she's let down
not only the 2d Suffolk District but her entire race, how she was
the last glimmer of hope for a bit of honest politicking in a
community governed by a line of fledgling felons. While the
disclosure that Wilkerson constructed for herself a tax-free zone
was certainly a collective community embarrassment, her
constituents are not doing the woe-is-me rhumba, dragging their
self-esteem through the mud and moaning ``Seems like we can't do
nothing right.''
<p>
   That's because the woman most of her constituents know simply as
``Dianne'' has changed the landscape of a community too often
characterized by shrugged shoulders and missed opportunities.
Whether she's blazing into a neighborhood forum, or standing
quietly in the back of a room where neighborhood kindergarteners
are being awarded their first diploma, she has become a fixture
that still signifies progress.
<p>
   She is a role model, and will continue to be one  &MD;  perfect role
models are not always the shining stars who floss religiously, pay
their taxes and tack a ``please'' or ``thank you'' onto every
sentence. In a neighborhood where the reigning role model too often
is the neighborhood drug merchant, there's no shame in emulating a
woman who's got the juice it takes to set wing tips a-quakin' in
the halls of power.
<p>
   Dianne Wilkerson's signature is all over Boston. While a tepid
black leadership twiddled its thumbs, she charged headfirst into
the fray, taking the lead in anti-redlining legislation, backing
former governor William F. Weld's veto of a ``punitive'' welfare
reform package, ushering through laws to spend millions to
rehabilitate state-owned housing and negotiating monumental
settlements that led to the integration of white public housing
projects  &MD;  through it all, preaching a gospel of black
self-reliance that lifted the heads and unslumped the shoulders of
those in the maligned communities she had vowed to serve.
<p>
   Money is not the only viable currency. Wilkerson has already
paid back what she owes. She should answer for her crime, as
forthrightly and honestly as possible, and go on serving her
community. After all, it's not like she sexed up an under-age
congressional page or took a dip in the drink with a Kopechne.
<p>
   But jackals don't think that way. Let us be entertained as they
nip away at that bloody heel. Let us giggle as the Keystone Kops
clergy known as the Ten Point Coalition leave skid marks backing
away from the woman they claim to support. Let us marvel as the
most hypocritical politicans in recent memory polish their Charles
Flaherty fund-raiser souvenirs and wallow in their
self-righteousness. Let us keep in mind this snippet from the
constitution of this fair Commonwealth:
<p>
   ``All power residing originally in the people, and being derived
from them, the several magistrates and officers of government,
vested with authority, whether legislative, executive or judicial,
are their substitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable
to them.''
<p>
   Accountable to (itals)them(unitals).
<p>
   The senator broke the law. She has apologized and promised to
explain more about her actions after her sentencing Dec. 16. The
people who put her in office have taken notice. And it should be up
to them to measure all she has given and to decide if her failure
to pay taxes negates that good. That's what elections are for.
<p>
   They may be shaking their heads. But Dianne Wilkerson is the
woman who taught them to hold those heads up.
<p>

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  A year ago Richard Allen Davis was sentenced to
death for the October 1993 kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Polly
Klaas. Those who took part in the Davis case say they will never be
able to put the experience behind them.
<p>
   During the trial, in which the 43-year-old Davis was condemned
to die by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Thomas Hastings,
Polly's family sat in the front row, often clinging to each other
as the horror of the Petaluma, Calif., Junior High School student's
death was relived in testimony.
<p>
   Today her father Marc is a peripatetic wanderer, compelled by
his need to draw meaning and social benefit from the otherwise
senseless death of his daughter.
<p>
   Recently, Klaas called a reporter from ``somewhere in the Dallas
region  &MD;  maybe Arlington or something, I'm not sure.''
<p>
   He was spending the week on the road, raising money for his
Klaas Foundation for Children, which promotes child safety
legislation, and appearing in malls and car dealerships to
fingerprint and photograph children. He estimates about 20,000
youngsters have had their vital statistics recorded in these
sessions, for investigative purposes should they  &MD;  like Polly  &MD; 
disappear.
<p>
   ``You have to find some kind of a silver lining in this
tragedy,'' he said. ``You have to find a way to continue on. We've
never done a decompression. From the time Polly was taken until
now, I don't think we've taken time to decompress or even deal with
it.''
<p>
   Klaas is financially supported by his wife, Violet, who works as
a secretary during the day and handles his travel and foundation
chores at night.
<p>
   ``This has not been a terrible strain on my marriage, but I
think if it was to continue on like this it would be,'' said Klaas,
who promised that he would curtail his travels next year.
<p>
   Marc's parents, Joe and B.J. Klaas, moved to Pebble Beach,
Calif., after the trial, where they also work for the foundation.
<p>
   ``B.J. does almost all of the work,'' said Joe Klaas. ``I've
done some public speaking, usually when Marc already has an
engagement.''
<p>
   Joe Klaas credited his son with getting at least 100 bills
protecting children passed in legislatures throughout the country.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the senior Klaas has returned to a lifelong project:
Seeking to prove, in book and in film, that aviator Amelia Earhart,
lost on a round-the-world flight in July 1937, was captured by the
Japanese and later returned to America to live under an assumed
name.
<p>
   Polly's mother, Eve Nichol, did not attend the trial. She has
guarded her privacy since the day Polly's body was recovered.
<p>
   Greg Jacobs, who prosecuted Davis, ``actually noticed the
seasons change'' this year  &MD;  a luxury denied him in the months
preceding and during the trial.
<p>
   ``When I went back to work (after the trial) I realized the
adrenaline was still flowing into my system. I was still operating
at a high level of intensity,'' he said. ``I was not really relaxed
for quite a few months. I was pretty impatient with people.''
<p>
   Finally, last spring, ``I started to get a little more adjusted
...`
<p>
   Frequent lecture invitations from police and law organizations,
said Jacobs, spring directly from the trial.
<p>
   Jacobs confesses that ``in a way I miss the excitement. The fact
that I got to take on the case of a lifetime and be in court again
and be in the limelight  &MD;  I miss it and, in a way, I don't.''
<p>
   In Santa Rosa, Jacobs has created a ``child death review team''
of law enforcement, health and social service professionals to
examine the death of every child in the county. The team has
recommended improvements in teenage suicide prevention and water
safety rules.
<p>
   Jacobs was assisted by co-counsel Cliff Harris, who often
examined witnesses. Near the end of the trial, Harris had extensive
medical tests.
<p>
   ``It turned out this spring he was diagnosed with lung cancer,''
said Jacobs. ``He had a lung removed. Now he's recuperating from
the surgery and getting chemotherapy. I hear he's got a good
prognosis.''
<p>
   His illness didn't prevent Harris from speaking at the funeral
of Gary Dixon, who had come back from quadruple-bypass surgery a
year earlier to assist the Davis defense crew as lead investigator.
<p>
   Though they wound up on different teams, Harris and Dixon had
served together as police officers in Santa Ana.
<p>
   Sonoma County Assistant Public Defender Barry Collins said,
``I'm always going to be the guy who represented Richard Allen
Davis. It's my legacy, you know.'
<p>
   Living with that legacy has not been hard. He and co-defender
Lorena Chandler were named defense attorneys of the year at the
California Public Defenders' Association convention in Monterey.
<p>
   Collins has appeared on TV and gets calls from across the
country seeking his response to events that mirror the Davis case.
<p>
   His wife filed for divorce at the end of the trial. Now Collins
lives in a small house, commutes to work by bicycle and coaches his
daughter's soccer squad. ``I've got 15 girls on my team who are
basically the same age as Polly Klaas when she died,'' he said.
<p>
   Chandler, the private attorney hired to assist Collins, took 10
days off after the trial and then plunged back into defending
murder suspects.
<p>
   ``Davis is the only client I've lost to death row,'' said
Chandler. Neither she nor Collins have stayed in touch with Davis.
``My job was never to be his friend,'' said Chandler.
<p>
   Richard Allen Davis lives in a cell in San Quentin's Adjustment
Center, essentially an auxiliary wing of death row. Prison
spokeswoman Joy McFarland said the center houses inmates who pose
disciplinary or management problems. Most are facing execution.
<p>
   Davis is classified as a Grade B condemned prisoner  &MD;  a
reflection of the security problems he presents as a child-killer,
a type of criminal that most inmates consider reprehensible.
<p>
   McFarland said Davis gets nine hours of yard time a week, when
he is permitted outside with one other prisoner.
<p>
   Four months ago, Davis and the prisoner got in a fight,
resulting in abrasions on his right eye.
<p>
   Otherwise, he has been a good prisoner  &MD;  as he was during
several other stretches behind bars. ``That's part of his
history,'' said McFarland. ``He's a conforming inmate.''
<p>
   Davis' case is undergoing an automatic appeals process that will
probably delay his execution for many years.

   Vancouver, British Columbia, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Loewen
Group Inc., North America's second-largest funeral-services
company, lost its status as one of the premier growth stocks and it
may take more than a year before earnings again meet expectations,
analysts said.
<p>
   In the last two years, the Burnaby, British Columbia-based
company has been accused of paying too much for new properties,
waging a fight against a potential US$4.3 billion takeover bid by a
U.S.-based rival and losing what many said was an avoidable
lawsuit. Impressive growth earlier in the decade also raised
investors' expectations unrealistically, analysts said.
<p>
   Last week's announcement by the company that it will take a
third-quarter charge and post a loss and that its fourth-quarter
results will be weaker-than-expected was another in a string of
surprises in recent years that have disappointed investors. The
development also gave credence that Loewen Group may have expanded
too fast and now its paying the price.
<p>
   ``There are a lot of very unhappy shareholders,'' said David
Brodie, an analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. in Toronto.
Brodie organized a recent meeting between Loewen Group executives
and institutional investors. ``They're quite a restive lot,'' he
said.
<p>
   Brodie said the company has failed to ``manage expectations''
and as a result it ``will have to spend some time in the penalty
box.''
<p>
   Its market capitalization rose as high as US$2.5 billion a year
ago, amid talk of a takeover offer, from US$550 million at the end
of 1992. It's now US$1.7 billion.
<p>
   With more than 1,000 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries, Loewen
Group is second in size in North America to only Service Corp.
International of Houston. Loewen Group generated US$908.4 million
in revenue in 1996; Service Corp. had US$2.3 billion.
<p>
   Ray Loewen, who founded the company and remains its chairman,
chief executive and largest single shareholder with a 15.3 percent
stake, is relentless in his pursuit of growth.
<p>
   While analysts said that determination has made Loewen Group an
industry leader, it also raised expectations the company couldn't
meet, analysts said.
<p>
   ``There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Loewen,'' said
Michael Farr, president of investment manager Farr, Miller and
Washington in Washington, D.C. Farr said he doesn't see any need to
rush out and buy Loewen Group stock, though.
<p>
   In other words, don't expect Loewen Group shares, which are
unchanged at 27 5/16 in early afternoon trading in New York, to go
anywhere fast.
<p>
   Brodie has a 12-month target of US$33. While still bullish, even
analysts at Smith Barney Inc., one of Loewen Group's key financial
advisers, have lowered their target stock price to US$43 from US$55
a year ago.
<p>
   Company executives maintain the board made the right decision in
rejecting takeover overtures from Service Corp. a year ago.
<p>
   Service Corp. first proposed a merger valuing Loewen Group at
US$43 a share, then said it would proceed with a hostile bid valued
at US$45 a share.
<p>
   Service Corp. ended its quest in January without ever making a
formal offer, citing Loewen Group's anti-takeover efforts.
<p>
   Since then Loewen Group shares have slumped. The stock is
trading at 39 percent of Service Corp.'s hostile price. Analysts
and investors said the onus is now on Loewen Group to reassure them
that there are no other obstacles to clear.
<p>
   ``There's no earnings problem and there's no revenue-growth
problem,'' said Paul Wagler, Loewen Group's chief financial
officer. The company expects to grow at a rate of 20 percent a year
with a relatively steady level of acquisitions in the US$500
million to US$600 million range, he said.
<p>
   Wagler, who said the company isn't overpaying for acquisitions
as some critics have suggested, added that the third-quarter charge
is intended to reduce Loewen Group's cost structure and improve
overall profitability.
<p>
   ``You could say that the speed of our growth, in and of itself,
caused the cost structure to be a little higher'' than preferred,
Wagler said.
<p>
   Wagler acknowledged that investors, including himself and the
company's chairman, are ``disappointed'' at the stock's recent
performance.
<p>
   Analysts and investors will be looking for predictable results
from the company going forward. Earnings estimates for this year
and next have been pared to between US$1.30 and US$1.40 in 1997 and
between US$1.65 and US$1.75 in 1998. Wagler said those estimates
are ``in the right ballpark.''
<p>
   Loewen Group's meteoric rise since its initial offering in 1987
came to a halt in late 1995 when a Mississippi jury ordered the
company to pay US$500 million to settle a breach-of-contract
lawsuit.
<p>
   The jury verdict, which Ray Loewen later called ``a stray
bullet,'' wiped out more than half of Loewen Group's market
capitalization and by January 1996 it was days away from a
bankruptcy protection filing.
<p>
   While Loewen Group negotiated a lower out-of-court settlement to
resolve the lawsuit, the experience put a heightened focus on the
company.
<p>
   ``I think most companies go through halcyon days when people
credit them with abilities and achievements maybe even beyond what
they have done,'' Wagler said, alluding to the company's pre-1995
growth.
<p>
   ``And definitely there are dog days when people don't give you
credit for what you are doing,'' Wagler said of the company's more
recent developments. ``We certainly have had our share of both.''

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- MGI Software Corp. shares rose
as much as 16 percent to a 52-week high after the company said
fiscal second-quarter revenue almost doubled because of its
software used to manipulate photographs and video images.
<p>
   MGI shares jumped C$0.85 to C$6.25 (US$4.50) in midafternoon
Toronto trading of 278,800 shares, nearly four times the full day
three-month daily average of 73,000. MGI shares started trading on
the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday after previously being listed
on the over-the-counter Canadian Dealing Network.
<p>
   The Toronto-based company said revenue in the quarter ended July
31 jumped to C$5.47 million from C$3.09 million in the year-earlier
period. MGI had a loss of C$1.58 million, or C$0.08 a share,
compared with C$1.09 million, or C$0.07, a year earlier.
<p>
   ``Digital photography has become one of the fastest growing
markets in the computer software industry and our leadership
reflects this trend,'' said Anthony DeCristofaro, MGI's president
and chief executive.
<p>
   MGI's PhotoSuite and VideoWave software enables computer users
to capture images and edit images for presentations, World Wide Web
sites and publishing.
<p>
   In the photographic market, MGI competes against Microsoft
Corp.'s Picture It software and Adobe Systems Inc.'s Photo Deluxe
application.
<p>
   MGI plans to raise C$14.8 million through an offering of 3.5
million warrants. The financing is being managed by Gordon Capital
Corp., Canaccord Capital Corp. and Griffiths McBurney &AMP; Partners.

FRANCO-AMERICANS NUMEROUS, BUT AN ETHNIC ENIGMA &QL; 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DON AUCOIN &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WALTHAM, Mass.  &MD;  Each day's obituaries give Gus Chiasson a
little pang, a little more disheartening evidence that
Franco-Americans don't stick together the way he thinks they
should.
<p>
   ``The French, a lot of them don't go to the French funeral
home,'' lamented Chiasson, 76, a retired electrician. ``Any time
you see an Italian name, you know they're going to the Italian
funeral home. Any time you see an Irish name, you know they're
going to the Irish funeral home. Why don't we patronize our own
funeral homes?''
<p>
   Even in death, the Franco-Americans of Massachusetts confound
the assumptions of group solidarity and identity politics of other
populations.
<p>
   They are an ethnic enigma, with a cultural identity so submerged
that it is a well-kept secret to many that there are nearly 1
million Franco-Americans in Massachusetts, residents who trace
their heritage to France but who are overwhelmingly the descendants
of immigrants from Canada. Though few would likely guess it,
Franco-Americans are the second-largest ethnic group in the state,
behind Irish-Americans, and comprise fully one-sixth of the
population of Massachusetts.
<p>
   ``People fall over backward when they learn that; they can't
believe it,'' said Claire Quintal, director of the French Institute
at Assumption College. ``It's because Franco-Americans are so
low-key; they tend to want to sink back in the woodwork and not be
seen.''
<p>
   It's not that Franco-Americans aren't proud of their heritage,
or that they don't find ways to celebrate it: They are and they do.
<p>
   But for a complex web of reasons  &MD;  encompassing history,
religion, the call of their homeland to the north, the drive toward
assimilation, and the inward-turning, spotlight-shunning character
of many Franco-Americans  &MD;  they are less likely to think and act in
group terms than Irish-, Italian-, Jewish- African-, or
Hispanic-Americans.
<p>
   ``The French-Canadians don't really organize and mobilize along
ethnic lines,'' said Lawrence Fuchs, a Brandeis professor who has
studied patterns of immigration and ethnicity. ``They don't put
themselves forward in that way.''
<p>
   The net result, according to Gerard J. Brault, author of ``The
French-Canadian Heritage in New England,'' is that despite a
history of achievement, ``they have not had much visibility as an
ethnic group.''
<p>
   The Rev. Roger Lamoureux, pastor of Ste. Jeanne D'Arc parish in
Lowell, home to 25,000 residents of French descent, says
Franco-Americans are beginning to realize what they have lost, and
are working to recover it through festivals and other cultural
expression.
<p>
   ``When I was a boy, it was very important to fit in, and that
meant not acting like a Canadian,'' said Lamoureux, whose forebears
came from Quebec. ``It was important not to be separate, but to be
mainstream. But that desire for acceptance came at the cost of our
awareness of ourselves as an ethnic group.''
<p>
   Today, Massachusetts contains more Franco-Americans than any
state other than Louisiana. But despite substantial numbers, they
have not been able to exert collective power in the civic realm
here the way Irish-Americans traditionally have done, and the way
Italian-Americans are beginning to do (claiming a governor, state
treasurer, and mayor of Boston). There has never been a
Franco-American elected governor or sent to Congress from
Massachusetts. Indeed, it's been almost 40 years since a person of
French extraction served in any statewide office  &MD;  the last was J.
Henry Goguen, secretary of state in 1958 and 1959.
<p>
   ``We often say, `Why don't we have a French mayor in Waltham?'''
said Chiasson as he relaxed at the French-American Victory Club, a
Waltham social organization with nearly 500 members. ``But I don't
see anybody in sight.''
<p>
   To be sure, Franco-American triumphs have been considerable  &MD;  if
quiet  &MD;  in Massachusetts.
<p>
   Over the generations, they have propelled themselves from the
textile mills of Lowell, the paper mills of Holyoke, and the shoe
factories of Fall River into the fields of medicine, law,
education, and the priesthood. From novelist Jack (nee Jean-Louis)
Kerouac to Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, Bay Staters of
French descent have made their mark.
<p>
   Since immigrants of French descent began their migration to New
England in the 1850s, they have founded more than 300 churches and
200 parochial schools, the basis of strong Franco-American
communities in cities such as Waltham, Leominster, and Lowell.
<p>
   ``The French-Canadians identified very strongly with the group,
for a very long time, longer than most ethnic groups,'' Brault
said.
<p>
   But there was always a mistrust of the broader society, and a
reticence about fully entering the life of the community. Part of
it was a simple desire for privacy, part of it was a sense of being
on the losing end of ethnic rivalries with groups that had arrived
here earlier and solidified their hold on political and religious
institutions. Part of it stemmed from the fact that Franco-American
immigrants often stayed only a short time in Massachusetts,
returning to Canada after earning money in the mills.
<p>
   ``The French-Canadian migration was, more than any country with
the exception of the Mexicans, a back-and-forth migration,'' said
Fuchs. ``So there wasn't that investment in learning English.''
<p>
   And part of it was rooted in their Catholic faith, and a belief,
born in Canada and carried over to the United States, that to
pursue higher education was to risk losing a vital piece of the
heritage.
<p>
   ``You came into the world in a French hospital, and there was
the sense that you would remain French and Catholic forever,'' said
Quintal. ``There was a sense that `Don't go to school, because
you'll have to go to an English school, and you'll lose your
French. And if you lose your French, you'll lose your faith.'''
<p>
   Unlike today, minority ethnic groups such as Franco-Americans
were not encouraged to treasure their heritage in the early part of
this century, according to Lamoureux. In addition, a sense of
reserve and humility permeated the Franco-American character,
coupled with a strong individualistic streak.
<p>
   The Rev. Roger Jacques, pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Waltham
(known locally as ``the French church,'' with a congregation that
is 90 percent Franco-American), said that benefactors of his church
often prefer to remain anonymous.
<p>
   ``The French people, they won't toot their own horn, they really
won't,'' said Father Jacques. ``It's cultural.''
<p>
   But those traits were combined with a problem that remains
common to this day, according to Quintal and numerous other
analysts: low self-esteem stemming from a lack of education.
<p>
   However, after World War II, the educational barrier began to
fall, as many Franco-Americans took advantage of the GI bill to go
to college. At the same time, though, ``the sense of belonging to a
group began to dissipate'' among younger Franco-Americans,
according to Brault.
<p>
   One theory for that slippage in group identity is that because
Franco-Americans came to America steadily over a century and a half
rather than in one massive flood, they were not viewed as
threatening and subjected to persecution by natives. Consequently,
this theory holds, Franco-Americans do not feel the need for an
ethnic bond as strongly as, say, Irish- or Jewish-Americans do. And
because their numbers did not reach a majority in most cities, they
were unable to take control of the political machinery.
<p>
   ``You need a little bit of repression to solidify the identity
politics,'' said Lou DiNatale, senior fellow at the McCormack
Institute.
<p>
   Other analysts, however, say that the absence of identity
politics is itself a symbol of success, that Franco-Americans have
assimilated.
<p>
   And there are encouraging signs that a revival of ethnic pride
is beginning among Franco-Americans. Lamoureux pointed to the
popularity of an annual, weeklong festival of French-Canadian
culture in Lowell.
<p>
   At 41, Paul Robichaud is both old enough to have seen the
erosion in ethnic solidarity and young enough to do something about
it.
<p>
   ``I like my French heritage,'' said Robichaud, manager of the
French-American Victory Club. ``I like to talk to my kids about it.
I tell them to be proud of their heritage.''

Times documented the growing support for school uniforms
nationwide. A Boston Globe feature describes an innovative
elementary school program in Baltimore that teaches fitness and
nutrition. A Kansas City Star feature links piano lessons with
academic excellence. A San Francisco Examiner story from the Hearst
News Service reports on a program whereby schoolchildren are
helping NASA scientists analyze satellite images of the moon. A
Boston Globe story gives tips for buying educational software for
children. And The New York Times has been following the efforts of
parents at a New York City public school to raise money to save a
teachers' job. That story has attracted nationwide attention.
<p>
   The advisory, FAMILIES-ADVISORY-NYT, moves every week on
Thursday in the ``l'' or lifestyle news category. For a repeat of
this week's edition, call 212-556-1927.
<p>
   6. SOME GOOD READS
<p>
   Finally, here are some not-to-be missed stories from the wire
this week:
<p>
    &MD;  The book review of Andrew Tobias' new book, ``My Vast Fortune:
The Money Adventures of a Quixotic Capitalist.'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt of The Times wrote that the book ``tickles both your
sense of humor and your fancy.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of ``cyber-man'' Steve Mann who is developing a
line of wearable computers. Judith Gaines of The Boston Globe
wrote, ``Mann has a computer screen in his eyeglasses, heat and
respiration sensors in his tank top, a pace monitor in his shoes, a
miniature keyboard in his pocket, a hard drive in a pouch by his
waist, and an entire ham radio station in his underwear.''
<p>
    &MD;  The profile of Ellen J. Langer, a psychology professor at
Harvard University and expert on absent minded behavior. Philip J.
Hilts of The Times wrote, ``Her latest book argues that traditional
methods of learning can produce mindless behavior because they tend
to get people to ``overlearn'' a fact or a task and suggest that
there is only one way to do it. She argues that is important to
teach skills and facts conditionally, setting the stage for doubt
and an awareness that different situations may call for different
approaches or answers.''
<p>
    &MD;  The entertainment feature on Bob Dylan by Jon Pareles, the pop
music writer for The Times. Pareles wrote, ``Dylan is proud of his
new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' and rightfully so. The album, to
be released on Tuesday, is far and away his best sustained work
since the mid-1970s...''
<p>
    &MD;  The Times' front-page story by Nicholas D. Kristof about the
upcoming publication of the 13th century diary of an Italian Jewish
trader named Jacob, who may have arrived in China four years before
Marco Polo. Kristof wrote, ``It provides extraordinary images of a
civilization that was the most dazzling in the world, describing
everything from mass-circulation pornography to an early
flamethrower. It recounts how he spent six months in Zaitun and
became embroiled in Chinese political debates so fierce he had to
flee for his life.''
<p>
    &MD;  And The Times' business feature about the marketing of Arthur,
and other public-television characters like Barney, Elmo and Thomas
the Tank Engine. Constance L. Hays of The Times wrote, ``While the
Sesame Street characters turned into toys only after the series was
a hit, merchandising was part of the Arthur script from the
start.''

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Banco de Credito Nacional SA,
Brazil's fifth-largest investor-owned bank, acknowledged that it
had held discussions with Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya SA. Both
banks denied press reports that BBV had agreed to take over BCN.
<p>
   BBV also earlier told Spanish stock market regulators that it
had held discussions with a number of Brazilian banks, as part of
its plan to invest $800 million for a ``significant market share''
in Brazil's banking industry. BBV characterized its talks with
Brazilian banks as ``priority objectives.''
<p>
   Brazil's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper reported that BBV, Spain's
second largest commercial bank, would spend about $1 billion to buy
a 51 percent stake in a holding company that controls BCN, Brazil's
fifth-largest investor-owned bank.
<p>
   ``BCN was recently approached by BBV so it could show (BCN) its
Latin American expansion plans, especially in Brazil,'' the bank
said in a statement.
<p>
   Before the start of morning trading, Brazil's Bovespa Stock
Exchange suspended trading in the shares of Banco de Credito
Nacional SA, Brazil's fifth-largest investor-owned bank, as a
result of the BCN-BBV speculation.
<p>
   According to a Bovespa press spokeswoman, trading will resume at
2:30 p.m. Sao Paulo time (1:30 EST). The decision to resume trading
was taken after the BCN and BBV declarations.
<p>
   Reports of a BBV purchase of BCN began circulating yesterday
after Brazilian television station Globo TV reported that Brazil's
Central Bank President Gustavo Franco told BBV officials in Hong
Kong that he would approve the sale of BCN, said a BCN spokesman.
<p>
   A Brazilian Central Bank spokesman denied that Franco gave
either BBV or BCN any approval for a sale, adding that any sale to
a foreign bank would have to be approved by President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and reviewed by the National Monetary Council.
<p>
   The monetary council will meet next week.
<p>
   Any such transaction would also be subject to a ``financial
system restructuring tax.'' The tax, the spokesman said has been
approved by various central banks to give authorities the resources
needed to regulate and stabilize banking systems in case of
trouble.
<p>
   Brazil is bailing out and selling troubled banks, most owned, or
formerly owned, by free-spending state governments.
<p>
   According to Brazilian press reports BBV would have to pay a tax
of about $50 million to take over BCN. BCN is not known to be in
any financial difficulty. BCN nearly doubled its branch locations
in August after it bought Brazil's Banco de Credito Real SA from
the state government of Minas Gerais for $113.6 million.
<p>
   The purchase added $1 billion to BCN's total assets of $13.8
billion.
<p>
   BBV is Spain's second-largest bank in terms of assets and
operates 2,800 branches in Spain and 1,100 in 26 other countries.
<p>
   The bank has invested $1.9 billion to acquire banks in Latin
America and profit from the region has become an increasingly
important part of its overall earnings.
<p>
   BBV shares rose 25 pesetas to 4,440 in mid-afternoon trading.
<p>
   BCN has 200 branches in Brazil and two overseas in New York and
the Cayman Islands.
<p>
   Non-voting preferred shares of BCN closed down 21 centavos at
16.09 reais yesterday. BCN common, voting shares, which are little
traded, were little changed at 18.01 reais.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Lattice
Semiconductor Corp., Xilinx Inc. and Altera Corp. all fell amid
concern that weaker-than-expected demand for their specialized
semiconductors could hurt third-quarter earnings.
<p>
   Both Altera and Xilinx warned last month that sales may not meet
Wall Street's expectations. Now analysts are concerned that
September may not have brought the companies much relief.
<p>
   ``Although September business in North America has improved
somewhat from a very slow August, recent sales-channel checks
indicate that overall bookings and sales levels are still lagging
expectations,'' analyst Charles Boucher at UBS Securities in San
Francisco said in a research report today.
<p>
   Boucher cut his earnings estimates for Xilinx and Altera and
lowered his investment rating on Lattice from ``buy'' to ``hold''
because of weak demand for their programmable logic devices, or
PLDs, which are used in computer-networking devices,
telecommunications equipment and industrial machinery.
<p>
   Lattice shares tumbled 4 1/4 to 65 1/8 in midday trading. Xilinx
fell 1 7/16 to 49 7/8. Altera slumped 2 1/8 to 52 7/8.
<p>
   Slower sales to networking companies and slumping demand in
Japan, where the economy remains weak, appear to be the primary
reasons for weaker sales of PLDs, Boucher said.
<p>
   Lattice shares outperformed rivals's stock in the last three
months, bolstered by strong sales of its ``in-system programmable''
PLDs, which allow designers to configure the devices as specific
logic circuits on the board inside a computer without having to
remove the board.
<p>
   Now, competitors are shipping their own in-system programmable
chips, cutting into Lattice's market, Boucher said.
<p>
   Given that development, Hillsboro, Oregon-based Lattice's shares
are priced too high at current levels, Boucher said. The shares
would be worth buying at $55 to $60 he said.
<p>
   ``Lattice's competitive strength has been linked to its
in-system programming technology,'' Boucher wrote today. ``We have
begun to see ISP product shipping from Altera and Xilinx, and we
think the differentiation offered by ISP is diminishing.''
<p>
   Boucher kept his ``buy'' rating on Altera and Xilinx, saying
their depressed prices already reflect investors' concern about
slower sales at the San Jose, California-based companies.
<p>
   Xilinx's shares have fallen 0.12 percent since Aug. 1, while
Altera's have fallen 13 percent. Lattice's shares are down 3
percent since then, with most of the decline coming this week.
<p>
   Boucher said he expects Altera to earn 39 cents a share in the
third quarter, down from a previous estimate of 40 cents. He
expects Xilinx to earn 39 cents its fiscal second quarter ending
Sept. 27, down from a previous estimate of 42 cents.

<p>
   Arequipa, Peru, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Peruvian mining
executives are counting on new tax breaks from the government to
help foster greater investment in the growing industry.
<p>
   Mines and Energy Minister Alberto Pandolfi today is to close a
week-long mining conference in the city of Arequipa, and may bring
good news to the industry, officials said.
<p>
   Pandolfi has said the government is studying changes to sales
tax legislation that would free mining companies from paying tax on
purchases and costs during the development stage of a mine. Such
taxes would be paid only after production begins.
<p>
   ``Peru has a great future as a mining country,'' said Luis
Hochschild, director of the conference and president of the
Peruvian Hochschild mining group. ``But we have to lower taxes to
attract foreign investors.''
<p>
   President Alberto Fujimori's office wouldn't comment on
speculation that the president will travel to Arequipa. The office
rarely outlines his agenda in advance.
<p>
   Mining companies are also looking for cuts, or the removal, of
tariffs on imported mining equipment, and the removal of a
5-percent housing tax on income.
<p>
   Mining officials said the tax cuts are crucial to ensuring that
planned mining projects go ahead. The government is counting on $10
billion in mining investment in the next decade, almost half of
that from three major projects. They are the $2.3 billion La Granja
copper project by Cambior Inc.; Antamina, a $2 billion copper and
zinc mine to be developed by Rio Algom Ltd. and Inmet Mining Corp.;
and Anglo American Corp.'s $750 million Quellaveco copper mine.
<p>
   Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. said it gave the go ahead last week
to development plans for its Pierina gold mine in Peru, which will
require investment of $260 million.
<p>
   A recent study by the Macroconsult economic research group found
several projects may not go ahead under the existing tax regime,
because they wouldn't be profitable enough for companies.
<p>
   The report found the tax systems in neighboring Chile and
Argentina more favorable to mining companies.

<p>
   In the United States, where 39 percent of teachers say not all
of their students have textbooks to bring home, you would figure
that schools that actually have enough books are places where
people covet them with the obsession accorded to a grail.
<p>
   Wrong. They are cursing them. It might still be true that it
takes a pound of education to produce an ounce of learning, but
this becomes a problem when children cannot literally carry the
load. From Boston to Paris, students say their backpacks are so
heavy they hurt. They have become the Hunchbooks of Notre Dame.
<p>
   ``My spine turned out to be a bit curved,'' said one French high
school student who said his condition was due to his daily carrying
of 30 pounds of books on his back.
<p>
   ``Usually, my shoulders really hurt because I have very tense
muscles,'' a sixth grader from the M.E. Fitzgerald School in
Cambridge, Mass. recently told the Globe.
<p>
   ``Sometimes you get hip pain, too, from having it hit you when
you walk,'' said an eighth grader at the Fitzgerald.
<p>
   In France, this issue has a Paris-area representative to the
French National Assembly campaigning for national weight limits in
backpacks. Education Minister Francois Bayrou said overweight
backpacks are symbolic of a nation so obsessed with education that
``it is very difficult to be recognized in French society ... in
business, in government, in politics if one does not have a diploma
acquired at the age of 20.''
<p>
   In the United States, a national obsession with education would
be the last reason someone would cite for weight limits. I am sure
there are cases where flyweight children have a book-to-body weight
ratio that would frighten a Nepalese sherpa. But in general, the
sad fact just might be that our children have become so sedentary
that they no longer have the strength to do what school children
could do for decades before them.
<p>
   Two years ago, the National Center for Health Statistics
reported that the number of severely overweight children and
teenagers in the United States has more than doubled from 5 to 11
percent. Between 22-30 percent of children are generally
overweight, according to different studies.
<p>
   The reasons for our pudgy children are not surprising. Despite a
higher awareness of nutrition and the need for exercise than ever
before, parents are so busy that the diet of their children  &MD;  who
are under relentless assault by fast food advertising  &MD;  goes
unmonitored. Despite an explosion in logo-laden sports apparel,
children spend an average of 32 hours a week watching TV while only
a third of high school students exercising at least 20 minutes at
least three times a week.
<p>
   But instead of serious campaigns to convince parents to turn off
the television, what do we do? In Massachusetts, the state ended
mandatory physical education. We might get a few scholars solely
because we killed gym class. But we probably will also get a lot of
people who, when they become adults, keep drug companies solvent by
reaching for the latest version of fen-phen.
<p>
   ``It's very worrisome,'' Gilman Grave, chief of endocrinology,
nutrition and growth at the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development said of overweight children two years ago.
``These children are clearly facing a doubling of the risk for
adult disease later in life.''
<p>
   At the very least, we are producing wimps. ``Carrying backpacks
of 18 to 20 pounds and getting back pain is a clue to me that there
ought to be some conditioning and muscle training for children,''
Dr. Michael Goldberg, chairman of orthopedics at the Tufts medical
school, recently told the Globe.
<p>
   One can see the endless cycle coming. We finally get the kids
books. The kids are so atrophied that their spines crack. The
schools bring in members of the New England Patriots, not as role
models to stay off the streets but to console them through rehab.
Instead of taxpayer dollars going to save endangered phys-ed
teachers, the parents go broke on ergonomically correct backpacks
and hospital copayments. Teens pop so much Advil and Tylenol, the
drugs replace marijuana as the entry-level drug for crack.
<p>
   The French should be so lucky to blame its overweight backpacks
on a cultural obsession with learning. Here, we just heap another
obsession with pain management upon our children. Robert Martin,
principal of the McCormack School in Dorchester, said the choice of
books a student takes home has become ``a sophisticated concept.
Kids need to learn how to use and manage books.'' When children who
are lucky to have textbooks are so out of shape that they have to
leave them behind, that is asking our children to jump over one
more parapet.
<p>
   That is like expecting Quasimodo to pass the SAT.

<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON -- They aren't yet calling each other nitwits, but that
could be because these days, two Boston-area organizations
dedicated to wiping out head lice aren't talking to each other at
all.
<p>
   Both the National Pediculosis Association, based in Needham, and
Sawyer Mac Productions, in Weston, are tackling the nation's
growing lice problem with informational phone lines and Web sites.
They speak at forums of parents and teachers. The energy and
creativity of their crusade have made Boston a national hub of lice
information.
<p>
   But despite their common purpose, the groups are at war over the
weapon of choice. The National Pediculosis Association supports the
manual removal of lice and their eggs, called nits, along with the
judicious use of pesticide shampoos; Sawyer Mac pushes for an
alternative treatment with olive oil.
<p>
   The nonprofit National Pediculosis Association, the older and
more established group, scorns the idea of dumping olive oil on
hair to suffocate lice. It responded to Sawyer Mac's campaign with
a press release saying, ``For those of you who believe that you can
beat head lice by dressing them like a salad  &MD;  think again.''
<p>
   Sawyer Mac, which was formed last year, fights back by saying
the NPA is loath to consider natural remedies because it gets money
from pharmaceutical firms, some of which make conventional
lice-fighting shampoos. State records show the National Pediculosis
Association got about $230,000 from drug companies over the past
three years.
<p>
   ``We will not take money from drug companies,'' said Roberta
MacPhee of Weston, whose for-profit company was founded with Joan
Sawyer of Cambridge.
<p>
   Each group accuses the other of hidden financial motives. Each
says the other is obscuring the truth to grab a marketing niche.
And both groups claim the support of researchers at the Harvard
School of Public Health, one of the few places nationwide where
lice-killing methods are getting scientific scrutiny.
<p>
   These scientists, more comfortable in the world of parasites
than politics, are cautious in talking about the rival groups.
<p>
   ``We have to be careful in these relationships,'' said Andrew
Spielman, public health entomologist at Harvard. ``We avoid
endorsing anyone.''
<p>
   While head lice have been with us throughout recorded history,
they're getting more attention these days  &MD;  perhaps because they're
more prevalent. While no official tallies are kept on lice, public
health officials in many states report rising cases of infestation.
<p>
   Deborah Altschuler, president of the National Pediculosis
Association, said there are about 12 million head lice cases a year
in this country, double the number 10 years ago. The figure is
based on the growth in sales of pesticide shampoos, now at about
$200 million a year.
<p>
   Scientists speculate that with the growing use of day care, more
youngsters get lice because they have more contact with other
children at earlier ages. Some also say the increase may be due to
tougher new strains of lice that are resistant to conventional
shampoo treatments.
<p>
   The inconvenience of lice these days goes beyond a little
scratching. Many schools have a ``no-nits'' policy, forcing
children to miss school with even one nit, the egg of a louse.
<p>
   Though lice are more a nuisance than a health hazard, some
families have turned to dangerous remedies. Last year, an
11-year-old Merrimac girl was severely burned when gasoline her
parents used to kill head lice was ignited by a nearby stove.
<p>
   In Oklahoma City this year, a man trying to kill head lice on a
6-year-old girl used the pesticide diazinon. She survived but it
sent her into cardiac and respiratory arrest.
<p>
   Altschuler was hoping to help such families when she founded the
association 15 years ago after going too many rounds with nits in
her children's hair. She draws no salary and donates her time as
well as money, Altschuler says.
<p>
   She said the group fields about 100 calls a day and records
thousands of daily hits on its Web site. The group sells many
products, such as ``Keep your wits, not your nits'' T-shirts,
coloring books, and stickers. This year, it also unveiled the
LiceMeister nit and lice comb.
<p>
   She says her group's donations from drug companies do not affect
her views about alternative treatments vs. traditional ones.
Indeed, much of the association's literature is critical of
pesticide shampoos.
<p>
   State records show that during the past few years, the National
Pediculosis Association got $155,000 from Allergan Inc., the maker
of a scabies treatment; $25,000 from Warner-Lambert, which makes
Nix shampoo; $35,000 from Del Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Pronto
treatments; and $14,000 from Effcon Inc., which hopes to market a
lice remedy.
<p>
   But Altschuler said she hears so many stories of the failure of
pesticide shampoos, she primarily advocates ``mechanical removal''
of lice and nits. She understands if parents want to try a lice
shampoo, though she cautions against repeating such treatments if
they continually fail.
<p>
   Altschuler calls the olive-oil treatment ``a marketing gambit''
to promote a $19.95 video, which Sawyer Mac began selling this
year. The video discusses how parents can saturate their children's
scalps with olive oil for several hours, or overnight, to safely
suffocate the tiny bugs. MacPhee said parents must also manually
remove lice.
<p>
   MacPhee said using olive oil is not ``a folk remedy.''
<p>
   Lisa Corrin, program coordinator at the Lesley Ellis School, a
private school in Cambridge, said olive oil helped a number of
families battle head lice last year. She said at least 22 children
had lice in the school of 120 students.
<p>
   MacPhee said she has heard of variations on the olive-oil theme,
such as adding vinegar or substituting tea tree oil, though she is
most confident that olive oil works.
<p>
   The Harvard lab has tested the olive-oil method only in a small,
informal study by entomologist Richard Pollack. He put six active
lice in olive oil and found that those removed from the oil after
an hour recovered, but those submerged for two hours died. He said
the lice must have suffocated in the olive oil, as would any animal
submerged in oil for a period of time.
<p>
   Pollack emphasized that this data is far from conclusive and
should not be construed as an endorsement of olive-oil remedies.
<p>
   But the researchers' main focus is whether lice are becoming
resistant to pesticides such as permethrin and piperonyl butoxide,
used in lice-fighting shampoos such as Nix, Rid, and Pronto. In
Israel, scientists found increased resistance to shampoo
treatments, and frustrated parents there were among the first to
report success with olive oil.
<p>
   Last Monday, the Harvard researchers heard they had won a
$50,000 grant from a private foundation for a more comprehensive
lice study, which may include looking at alternative treatments.
<p>
   And while the lab work goes on, the battle over lice treatments
rages. While olive-oil supporters say their method will ultimately
receive scientific backing, Altschuler says that parents should
follow the National Pediculosis Association's advice as the most
well-established. ``We can't be bought,'' she said. ``We're here
for all the right reasons.''
<p>
WHEN THE LICE GET AHEAD OF YOU &HT;    
<p>
   Head scratching is the most common symptom. Check for lice and
nits in a well-lighted area. Lice are reddish-brown insects the
size of sesame seeds, while nits are grayish-white eggs most
frequently found in the crown of the head, the nape of the neck,
and behind the ears.
<p>
   Be careful not to confuse dandruff or hair debris with nits.
<p>
WE'VE GOT THEM. NOW WHAT? &HT;    
<p>
   Check with your physician before using one of the
pesticide-containing shampoos available in drugstores. If one is
recommended, follow the directions carefully for dosage and
frequency of use.
<p>
   Though there is yet no scientific backing of this method, some
parents have found success with olive oil. Under this method,
saturate the scalp and hair with olive oil for at least several
hours or, ideally, overnight.
<p>
   No treatment can get around the need for the painstaking manual
removal of nits. Use a good lice comb or your fingernail tips.
<p>
   For more information, contact your physician, school nurse, or
local public health office. You can also obtain information from
private groups, such as the National Pediculosis Association at
617-449-NITS or the American Head Lice Information Center at
1-888-DIELICE.

<p>
   Q. I will be retiring at the end of this year at age 59, and my
wife will retire a year later when she reaches 59. I will collect a
pension of $2,300 a month, and my wife will collect $750 in Social
Security when she reaches age 62. Including everything I can think
of, we will need $3,800 a month in retirement. We have two mutual
fund portfolios. In taxable accounts, we have $187,000, 25 percent
of which is in Fidelity Equity Income II, 16 percent in T. Rowe
Price Small Cap Value, 7 percent in Scudder Value, 17 percent in
Vanguard Windsor II, 30 percent in T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income,
and 5 percent in a money market fund. In IRAs and 403(b) accounts,
we have $200,000, of which 26 percent is in Fidelity Fund, a like
amount in Fidelity Growth and Income, 18 percent in Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock, and 30 percent in Fidelity Puritan. Our plan is
to draw $2,000 a month from the taxable accounts for a period of 10
or 11 years until they are depleted, leaving the tax-deferred funds
to grow until then. At that point, we will begin drawing on those
in accordance with the IRS rules for withdrawals. Is this plan
feasible?
<p>
   Are these the right funds for this goal?
<p>
   D.L., Franklin, Mass.
<p>
   A. The plan seems plausible enough to me, but I'm not
comfortable with the makeup of the taxable portfolio. You have 65
percent of the taxable money in the stocks, which seems to me to be
too aggressive for a pool of money with dominant short- and
intermediate-term time frames. My nervousness about the current
market adds to my feelings here. Working backwards, if you want to
have that $187,000 last for 11 years with a sequence of $2,000
monthly withdrawals, you will require an average annual total
return of 6.85 percent. My instinct would be to reverse the
stock-to-fixed income ratio, retaining only 35 percent in stock
funds and holding 65 percent in funds such as Price's Spectrum
Income, which has a 12-month yield of 6.1 percent, adding funds
such as Fidelity Spartan High-Income, which boasts a 7.4 percent
yield, and a Ginnie Mae fund, with expectations that it will bring
average yields in the 6.5 percent to 7 percent range. Such a
portfolio, which is considerably safer than what you now hold,
would last nearly 10 years (a few days shy of 118 months) even if a
stock market correction brought your average annual returns to 5
percent. You could also improve your chances of having the taxable
pool last the full 11 years if you reduced the rate of withdrawals
by $500 once your wife's Social Security checks begin coming in. If
you followed this procedure and get average returns of 7 percent,
on paper you would have $56,214 left in the taxable fund at the end
of 11 years; even if the average returns were only 5 percent, you
would still have $21,012 in the account after 11 years.
<p>
   Such arithmetic makes me feel that a more conservative portfolio
is better suited to your needs. And bear in mind, when you rely
heavily on a stock-dominated portfolio to provide an income stream,
a sharp market correction near the beginning of the period can play
hob with such theoretical calculations. (For example, if the market
showed a 20 percent loss in the first year, the effect of that loss
and your monthly withdrawals would be to bring the value down from
$187,000 to $127,806. Even if the market then produced 10 percent
average annual gains for your portfolio for the next years, you
would be reduced to withdrawals of $1,657 a month to stretch the
funds out over the final 10 years.) I have no problems at all with
the fund choices in the tax-deferred accounts, and I calculate that
the tax-deferred pool would grow to a satisfying $570,658 over the
course of 11 years, provided you enjoyed average annual returns of
10 percent.
<p>
   Q. I plan to help my granddaughter get started with an IRA. She
is 18 years old and in college. She does work part time, but may
not reach the $2,000 earnings plateau. Can you suggest a fund to
get her started? Also, I am under the impression that the new tax
law allows more than one type of IRA. Which would you suggest for
her?
<p>
   G.U., Andover, Mass.
<p>
   A. I'd suggest that your granddaughter begin with the kind of
fund that should eventually become the core element of a
diversified retirement portfolio -- a solid growth and income fund
with a good long-term record. There are many, many funds that
qualify here, and I'll confine my remarks to one of the simplest to
understand -- the Vanguard Index 500 fund.
<p>
   This offering simply invests in the 500 stocks that make up the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index, maintaining its positions in each
stock so that the performance of the fund tracks that of the index
-- in short, an investment here is an investment in the 500
companies that dominate the U.S. economy. Since managing such a
fund has developed into a science rather than an art, the major
factors in selecting such a fund involve sales loads and low
expenses. The Vanguard offering has no load, and annual expenses
representing less than .20 percent. You're likely to get precisely
the same thing with Fidelity Spartan Market Index, which also
provides an advantage for beginning investors, allowing a minimum
IRA investment of $500 rather than Vanguard's $1,000 minimum for
IRA accounts.
<p>
   The $2,000 earnings figure represents more of a ceiling rather
than a plateau; an IRA contribution may be as much as $2,000, but
it may not exceed the IRA owner's earned income for the year. The
money used to fund the IRA need not come from the earned income.
There are two basic IRA categories in existence now, and a third
beginning next year. The current types are deductible and
non-deductible. Persons who are not covered by pension plans, or
whose income falls within certain limits, may claim contributions
to an IRA as a dollar-for-dollar deduction against their taxable
income. This is nice for a person who expects a substantial tax
bill, but a person such as your granddaughter with minimal earnings
is probably better off with a non-deductible IRA, since she
probably will realize little or nothing in tax savings. The
advantage of a non-deductible IRA is that, upon withdrawal in her
retirement years, only the portion of the IRA account which
represents the growth of her initial contribution will be taxable.
Given the many years before your granddaughter can be expected to
retire, this looms as a very small advantage, and it carries with
it the disadvantage of requiring some fairly complex paperwork to
calculate tax liabilities when the money is withdrawn. Given your
granddaughter's situation -- and the fact that things will change
for her next year -- she'd probably be better off going with a
traditional IRA and enjoying whatever tax benefit she might this
year.
<p>
   But next year a new beast called the Roth IRA comes into effect.
<p>
   This allows contributions at the same levels as traditional
IRAs, but only of after-tax money. In exchange for paying taxes on
the money that goes into the Roth IRA, the principal and all
earnings generated in the account may be withdrawn tax free,
provided the owner has reached age 59 1/2 and the money has been in
the account at least five years. I discussed this at length in last
Monday's column, but didn't mention the big advantage it will
provide for people such as your granddaughter. When somebody faces
little or no tax liability, but can still afford to set up an IRA
(or has somebody who will do it for them) there's little to gain
from the tax deduction available in a traditional IRA. But the Roth
IRA will provide them a savings pool that will be entirely tax free
unless withdrawn prematurely. Last Monday I summarized the Roth IRA
as appealing primarily to people who expect to remain in a high tax
bracket after retirement, and to people who expect tax rates in
general to rise; to this list I should have added people in your
granddaughter's situation -- who face little or no current tax
liability but who will doubtless greatly enjoy an entirely tax free
savings pool in retirement.
<p>
   For those reasons, I suggest a traditional deductible IRA for
this year, but switching to a Roth IRA if your granddaughter's
earnings continue next year.

   Q. My chimney needs attention; the top bricks look loose. I know
I need someone to check it, but who? What is the difference between
a chimney man and mason?
<p>
   MARY WHITTEMORE, Winchester, Mass.
<p>
   A. Let's put it this way: Most masons are also chimney men,
because very few masons do not also work on chimneys. Not all
chimney men are masons. So, you have to find a mason who has done
and does chimney work. The bricks sound as if they need repointing,
which entails digging out the old mortar and inserting new mortar.
If a lot of the bricks are loose, it may require rebuilding the
chimney from the &QC; 
<p>
   roofline up, also the work of a mason.
<p>
   Q. My picture window needs reputtying and repainting. Is that
something I can do?
<p>
   C.K., Brockton, Mass.
<p>
   A. It certainly is, but it is not an easy project. You have to
reputty not with putty, but something called glazing compound, and
in order to do that, you have to remove the old glazing compound,
or at least any loose stuff. Glazing compound usually deteriorates
along the bottom edge, and maybe a few inches up each side. Try
scraping off the old compound with a chisel; some will come out
easily, some may take a little more work to remove. You can soften
some of the more stubborn compound with a hot-air gun, making it
easy to scrape. Be careful, though: That hot air gun can crack the
window if the glass gets too hot.
<p>
   Once the compound is removed, paint the wood with boiled linseed
oil to condition it and prevent the new compound from failing. Use
a good glazing compound; Dap is good.
<p>
   To reglaze, roll a big dollop of compound into a long, thin
``snake,'' and press it into the space between glass and wood. Then
smooth it off with a putty knife, slanting the compound at about a
45-degree angle from glass to wood. It takes a little practice to
do this, especially to get a good, neat corner.
<p>
   Let the compound set for two or three days; then paint with an
oil-based primer; finish with a latex house paint. When painting,
paint 1/16 inch onto the glass; this is what seals the compound and
makes it waterproof. The reason you want to wait two or three days
before painting is to let the compound cure, getting hard enough to
paint.
<p>
   Q. My son wants to replace a seamless kitchen floor that is very
dry and porous. I think it will last a little longer, but is there
a way to protect it so it will last a while? Can I put a coat or
two of polyurethane varnish over it?
<p>
   L.C., Peabody, Mass.
<p>
   A. I don't think any kind of varnish will work; it would be hard
to make it stick, so avoid it. If it started to peel, you would be
in a bigger mess than you are now. You might try to coat it with
Future, though. This is an acrylic designed for linoleum and some
vinyl floors, and might look good for a while and keep it going.
But don't expect too much; that seamless floor is probably 10 or 15
years old anyway.
<p>
   Q. I had a new roof put on last spring, with a skylight. Now the
skylight leaks in the rain. What can I do?
<p>
   P.W., Littleton, Mass.
<p>
   A. Get after the roofer; a new roof, plus flashing, is usually
warranted for a year; the roofer is liable, or at least should be,
and should fix the flashing or replace it.
<p>
   First, though, determine if the leaks are actually a leak or the
water is condensation of moisture on the glass or the wood frame
inside. In wet weather a lot of moisture in the house can condense
on a cool surface (the glass and or frame), which can look like a
leak.
<p>
   Q. I have a nice looking pergola with a design problem. There
are four fiberglass columns that are holding up the pergola beams.
The columns are hollow, and the tops are open where the cross-beams
set on them, about an inch of space on each side of the beams. I am
concerned abut water getting into the columns and rotting them out.
I have to cover the column tops totally, but how?
<p>
   JIM FLEMING, Newtonville, Mass. &QC; 
<p>
   A. Where there is a problem there is a way. I suggest nailing a
short ``2 by'' (a board 1 1/2 inches thick and as high as the
height of the beam) on each side of the beam, covering that
one-inch opening. Say it's a 2 x 8 or 4 x 8; make the covering
piece a 2 x 8. Or, make the covering piece a 2 x 4. Make sure the
covering piece overhangs the column enough to provide a drip edge,
allowing water to drip away from the column, not down its face.
Anything can cover the opening, but I think that either of the
above will be decorative as well as practical.
<p>
   Or, if you can do it, lift the beam and set a square 2 x 8 or
similar 1 1/2-inch-thick board on top to cover it. It would act as
sort of a capital to the top of the column. Then set the beams on
this capital. This too would be decorative.

 &UR; NASDAQ TO REVAMP TRADING TO BOOST COMPETITION, DEALER CONTROL &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market is
launching a major restructuring of its trading operations in an
attempt to increase price competition for investors, grant
anonymity to institutional investors and give dealers more control
over their trades. The plan, dubbed the ``Next Nasdaq,'' would
create a central market for customer ``limit orders'' -- stock
orders at pre-specified prices that now interact only within a
particular dealer's file. It also would combine Nasdaq's two
principal electronic trading systems, SelectNet and the Small Order
Execution System, into one system with more advanced technology.
<p>
   ``We improve our competitiveness by making the market efficient
and fair for investors,'' said Nasdaq executive vice president
Patrick Campbell.
<p>
   The board of Nasdaq, the nation's second largest stock market,
voted earlier this week to forward the plan to the board of the
parent body, the National Association of Securities Dealers, for an
Oct. 9 review. If the NASD approves it, the Securities and Exchange
Commission will issue the proposal for public comment before
deciding whether to adopt it. The SEC regulates U.S. stock markets,
including Nasdaq.
<p>
   Under Frank Zarb, NASD's chief executive since February, NASD
has been vying to improve its ability to compete with the New York
Stock Exchange, the Instinet private trading system and other
alternative systems. NASD has sought to enhance its technology,
recruit overseas companies, and improve its responsiveness to
investors, dealers, and corporations.
<p>
   Limit orders now compete in a limited field, because they
interact only with limit orders placed by customers of the same
dealer. They also are sometimes forwarded by dealers to private
trading systems that compete with Nasdaq. The central limit-order
file would be voluntary under the Nasdaq plan, so dealers could
continue keeping their own limit-order files, Campbell said. ``A
central limit-order market would result in better stock prices for
investors and give them more access to trading information,''
Campbell said. ``This could spur them to place more trades, and
institutional investors especially would be able to guard their
strategies by trading anonymously.''
<p>
   Nasdaq-listed companies, institutional investors and some
brokerages have been pushing for a central limit-order market,
Campbell said. A Security Traders Association survey of
institutional investors found that anonymity was the trait they
found most desirable in a trading system, he said.
<p>
   Currently, an institutional investor must be identified in
Nasdaq trades, though not in trades on a private trading system.
<p>
   SelectNet, which accounts for about two-thirds of all
dealer-to-dealer orders placed on Nasdaq, is now used by most mid-
and large-sized dealers. The controversial SOES, on which about 20
percent of all dealer-to-dealer orders are placed, seeks to put
small traders on an equal footing with larger rivals.
<p>
   ``This would simplify trading and give market makers more
control over their trades,'' Nasdaq's Campbell said. ``It also
would help stop backing away.'' Market makers are dealers who stand
ready to buy or sell securities on behalf of investors or
themselves.
<p>
   Dealers sometimes ``back away,'' or fail to honor posted quotes,
because of the difficulty they have in trying to reconcile quickly
the prices of orders coming in on two trading systems, Campbell
said.
<p>
   SelectNet has been overwhelmed by price quotes since Nasdaq
started phasing in order-handling rules earlier this year that have
narrowed trading spreads -- the difference between the buying and
selling prices of a stock. As for SOES, dealers have long
complained that small traders exploit the system by placing
rapid-fire trades whenever stock prices fluctuate. Nasdaq will
scrap efforts to replace SOES with the ``Naqcess'' system, Campbell
said. For years, former NASD chief executive Joseph Hardiman
unsuccessfully pushed Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Arthur Levitt to adopt Naqcess. A stock-traders group today praised
Nasdaq efforts to combine the two trading systems but said a
central limit-order market could narrow dealer profits and dry up
market liquidity.
<p>
   ``The two plans should be decoupled because there is a dealer
consensus about combining the two systems, while the limit-order
file is controversial,'' said John Tognino, president of the
Security Traders Association. ``The limit-order file could be a
disincentive for any dealer to ultimately risk capital.''
<p>
   One SOES trader expressed dismay that she and other SOES users
weren't consulted by Nasdaq.
<p>
   ``Our biggest concern is that this plan could exacerbate, not
improve, backing-away problems,'' said Linda Lerner, general
counsel to Montvale, New Jersey-based All-Tech Investment Group
Inc.
<p>
   The NASD was censured by the SEC last year, in part, for turning
a blind eye to backing-away violations by large dealers who failed
to honor orders placed by SOES activists. NASD's enforcement arm
has been trying to clamp down on this practice, which often occurs
inadvertently, Campbell said.
<p>
   Campbell said some private trading systems are likely to be
apprehensive about the plan because of its potential to undercut
their business. The Iselin, New Jersey-based Island private trading
system said that rival Instinet, the largest private trading system
in the U.S., would be most affected by the Nasdaq plan.
<p>
   ``Instinet charges the most of any private trading system, and
dealers who could trade anonymously on Nasdaq would prefer
(Nasdaq's) lower costs and better service and technology,'' said
Jeff Citron, chief executive of Smith Wall, which owns Island.
<p>
   New York-based Instinet, which is run by Reuters Holdings Plc,
did not respond to a request for comment. Instinet competes with
Bloomberg Tradebook, owned by Bloomberg LP. Bloomberg and Reuters
compete in providing financial information and news.

<p>
   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The average price to a National
Hockey League game this season rose 6.4 percent from last year to
$40.78, according to a survey by Team Marketing Report.
<p>
   It marks the first time the average price for a ticket in a
major sports league has eclipsed the $40.00 mark, said the survey
conducted by the Chicago-based industry newsletter.
<p>
   The average ticket price in the National Football League this
season is the second most expensive at $38.09, followed by $34.08
for a National Basketball Association game last season and $11.98
for Major League Baseball.
<p>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins have the highest average ticket price at
$56.28. That's more than double the lowest average price of $25.50
offered by the Edmonton Oilers after the figure is converted to
U.S. currency.
<p>
   The Boston Bruins have the second highest average ticket price
behind the Penguins at $53.56, followed by the Philadelphia Flyers
at $52.75 and the New Jersey Devils at $50.60.
<p>
   Joining the Oilers offering less expensive ticket prices are the
Dallas Stars at $28.74 and Calgary Flames at $29.04, also adjusted
to U.S. currency.
<p>
   The newsletter also calculates the Fan Cost index, which
measures the total price for a family of four to attend a game.
<p>
   The most expensive is a Bruins game, where it costs $295.25 for
four tickets, four small soft drinks, two small beers, four hot
dogs, parking for one car, two game programs and two caps.
<p>
   The league-wide Fan Cost Index is $228.97, a 3.7 percent
increase over last year.
<p>
   For a family on a limited budget that can't afford nearly $300
an outing to a Bruins game, the newsletter also calculates the
Frugal Fan Index, which substitutes the cheapest tickets available
and eliminates the beers, programs and caps.
<p>
   The best bargain is a Flames game, which costs $50.22. A similar
no-frills trip to a Bruins game would cost $150, according to the
survey.

   To bankers, it's strictly business.
<p>
   But to others, it certainly looks as if they are trying to help
pirate a football team away from Massachusetts.
<p>
   Fleet Financial Group is quietly advising the state of Rhode
Island in its quest to woo the New England Patriots to Providence,
R.I.
<p>
   The bank is anxious to avoid any characterization of this
somewhat sticky situation as a case of choosing sides between
Massachusetts and its pushy little neighbor. Fleet spokesman James
Mahoney is careful to point out the bank is providing technical
assistance to Rhode Island officials strictly in its capacity as
the state's financial adviser.
<p>
   ``What we have done for the state of Rhode Island, we would also
be more than willing to do for the state of Massachusetts,'' says
Mahoney.
<p>
   Given the high degree of jock anxiety over talk of a possible
Patriots move from Foxboro Stadium, it's hard to ignore the
potential for conflicted loyalties here.
<p>
   Rhode Island, after all, is home to Fleet chief executive Terry
Murray. And Fleet remains huge in that state, even though it's now
headquartered in Boston.
<p>
   Murray grew up in the Ocean State and launched his banking
career there. He entered Massachusetts banking in 1991 when Fleet
acquired Bank of New England. In 1995, Fleet bought Shawmut
National Corp., which made Murray's bank by far the biggest in this
town and gave Fleet the right to put its name on the FleetCenter.
That's when Murray moved his headquarters from Providence to
Boston.
<p>
   Fleet's work on behalf of a Rhode Island stadium quest makes
sense. The bank has a national reputation for sports lending,
ranking second in the country behind NationsBank.
<p>
   Fleet bankers were embarrassed last summer when a Dallas
businessman persuaded them to underwrite an $80 million loan to buy
the New York Islanders. The businessman, who lied about his assets,
recently pleaded guilty to bank and wire fraud. The Fleet banker
who approved the loan has resigned. But Fleet also has had
high-profile sports lending successes. Just this month, it closed
on a $185 million loan to recapitalize Art Modell's Baltimore
Ravens.
<p>
   Meanwhile, BankBoston, Fleet's local rival, is the bank of the
New England Patriots. And, as Kraft's friend and banker, BankBoston
chief executive Chad Gifford has been a strong advocate for a new
Patriots stadium.
<p>
   Could Fleet be trying to pirate away BankBoston's business?
<p>
   This week, a Rhode Island delegation called on the Tampa Stadium
Authority in Florida. The meeting was arranged by Morse Diesel, the
same contractor who built the FleetCenter and who is now building a
new stadium for another Fleet customer, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Richard Meringolo, a loan officer with Fleet's sports lending
division, planned to go on the trip, but canceled because of a
scheduling conflict.
<p>
   Fleet's Mahoney stresses the bank  &MD;  so far  &MD;  is working on
behalf of Rhode Island, not the Patriots. Could that change if
Rhode Island wins the stadium bid?
<p>
   ``There has been no formal proposal, no commitment made by us.
It is speculative to answer that question,'' says Mahoney. ``But
given the fact that would be a major piece of business within our
marketplace and one of our major customers would be involved,
obviously we would be interested in the business.''
<p>
   It's also clear Fleet is interested in the Patriots as a
business partner even if the team stays in Foxborough.
<p>
   ``The BankBoston relationship with the Patriots would not
necessarily carry over to the financing of the stadium,'' says
Mahoney.
<p>
   Could there be something even more afoot?
<p>
   Fleet's recent loan to the Ravens is particularly intriguing.
The Browns left Cleveland for Baltimore, where they took a new name
and will play in a new stadium largely financed by the public.
<p>
   Could Kraft be looking to Fleet for a Modell-like package  &MD;  and
an exit strategy from New England  &MD;  if he fails once again to get a
stadium deal here?
<p>
   Patriots spokesman Don Lowery said he would refer the question
to the appropriate person in the Patriots organization. The
appropriate person did not call back.

   Can sensible shoes also be hip, cool, and urgent? Can
comfortable footgear also have attitude?
<p>
   Those are questions the Rockport Co. has been wrestling with for
some time, and ones it attempts to answer yes to in TV spots, the
first of which aired last night.
<p>
   Rockport ads show a 40-year-old California pastor skateboarding,
a 48-year-old mountain climber scaling the side of a building, and
a 25-year-old video-game inventor frisking through a video arcade.
<p>
   The ads echo the message ``be comfortable. uncompromise. start
with your feet.'' that first appeared in print ads in the September
issues of such magazines as Esquire and The New Yorker.
<p>
   Rockport has long enjoyed a loyal following among customers who
believe its shoes are comfortable and long-lasting.
<p>
   Unfortunately, these fans tended to be no-nonsense older folks.
Young folks weren't so enchanted.
<p>
   To people in their 20s, Rockports were something their parents
wore, the shoe equivalent of your father's Oldsmobile.
<p>
   For much of the 1990s, Rockport, the Marlborough, Mass.
subsidiary of Reebok International Ltd., has sought to broaden its
appeal, to convince younger people and aging baby boomers that
Rockports are as nifty as sport utility vehicles.
<p>
   That's the goal of Kirshenbaum, Bond &AMP; Partners of New York,
Rockport's new ad agency.
<p>
   ``What we want to say is, `It's cool to be comfortable,''' says
Linda Lewi, Rockport's vice president of brand marketing.
<p>
   Rockport has taken a few stabs at saying something like that
before, and has gone through more than one agency trying to find a
campaign that works.
<p>
   Parting ways with one ad agency whose campaign didn't even air
in the United States, Rockport worked with Leo Burnett, the Chicago
agency that was then creating ads for Reebok.
<p>
   Even before Burnett resigned the Reebok account earlier this
year, Rockport was looking for a new agency. It picked Kirshenbaum,
Bond in December.
<p>
   ``We wanted to reposition and re-energize the comfort-shoe
category and make it exciting,'' Lewi says. ``And for that, we
needed an agency more willing to take risks.''
<p>
   Rockports have always been popular with doctors, teachers, and
other professionals, she says.
<p>
   The idea of the ads, Lewi says, is to recruit fans from ``the
new technical elite.''
<p>
   ``We want the younger Bill Gateses of the world to be wearing
Rockports,'' Lewi says.
<p>
   Some critics regard Bill Gates as an evil genie lusting for
world dominion. Also Thursday night, viewers got to see another
putative evil genie, this one the Mephistopheles of
microprocessors.
<p>
   This Mephistopheles was cast as the villain of a new 60-second
ad from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., which is
promoting its K6 MMX microprocessor as superior to rival Intel
Corp.'s Pentium MMX.
<p>
   In an ad created by Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston,
Mephistopheles brings a captured James Bond-like good guy to his
futuristic headquarters.
<p>
   Treating himself to a good gloat before the kill, Mephistopheles
deigns to show the hero his secret plans to take over the world
before the good guy is dispatched by his minions.
<p>
   Unfortunately for Mephistopheles, his secret plan is stored in a
personal computer powered by a generic microprocessor.
<p>
   The plan takes so long to retrieve the hero is able to escape
and thwart Mephistopheles's plan, thanks to the good guy's
K6-powered computer.
<p>
   ``When your PC is powered by the AMD K6 MMX enhanced
processor,'' a voice-over says, ``awesome speed and multimedia are
on your side.''
<p>
   This scenario may sound weird. But consider new ads from Intel,
which feature a bunny-suited crew going on a road trip to the
strains of the old disco hit ``Boogie Fever.''
<p>
   Mephistopheles may be weird. ``Boogie Fever'' is lame.
<p>
   ``Intel's Pentium dominates the market,'' says Fred Bertino,
Hill Holliday's president and chief creative officer. ``Basically,
what we're trying to say to a broad audience is that it's OK to buy
a computer with something else (besides a Pentium) inside it.''

   Allmerica, the subject of a contentious fight two years ago over
its efforts to sell stock to the public, confirmed Thursday that it
had asked the state's insurance division for permission to move the
corporate charter of First Allmerica Life Insurance Co. to New
Hampshire. The move would be on paper only; the company said it had
no plans to physically relocate its Worcester headquarters or any
jobs from Massachusetts.
<p>
   The insurer said the recharter was prompted by a law enacted
this year to fund Massachusetts' uncompensated health care pool,
which reimburses hospitals for bills rung up by those unable to pay
for care. Allmerica said it was the only company that would be hurt
by the new provision because all other Massachusetts-chartered
companies had dropped out of the group health business.
<p>
   The law requires that providers of group health insurance in the
state  &MD;  mostly Massachusetts HMOs and insurance companies chartered
in other states  &MD;  pay direct assessments to the pool based on their
hospital payments. Because Massachusetts taxes out-of-state
insurers for their Massachusetts hospital payments, states where
these companies are chartered are allowed to ``retaliate'' and to
tax in the same way Massachusetts-chartered companies that do
business in their health insurance markets.
<p>
   Allmerica estimated that retaliation would cost it  &MD;  and
eventually its policyholders  &MD;  about $2 million a year, less about
a $400,000 annual credit the legislation provided Allmerica to help
alleviate its problem. Allmerica said the retaliatory taxes would
put it at a disadvantage against competitors.
<p>
   ``The transfer of our charter would be a simple, practical, and
appropriate way to insure that our policyholders do not bear the
costs of these retaliatory taxes,'' O'Brien, who at $3.4 million
was the state's second highest paid insurance executive last year,
said Thursday.
<p>
   The $1.6 million is small change for Allmerica. The life
insurance unit, which includes the group health business, last year
alone reported a profit of $133 million. The parent company, which
provides a range of financial services, reported a profit of $182
million on revenues of $3.3 billion.
<p>
   But rechartering in New Hampshire would provide Allmerica
advantages beyond the savings for the group health business. To
name two: Allmerica would be regulated primarily by New Hampshire,
not Massachusetts, and it could escape being included in a new
community reinvestment pool, which it fiercely opposes.
<p>
   Allmerica says four of its operating companies are already
charted in New Hampshire; changing regulators has nothing to do
with the issue. Jason Adkins, head the Center for Insurance
Research in Cambridge, Mass. and a bitter critic of the industry,
doubts that: ``New Hampshire is a very small state with few
resources. The oversight will be vastly diminished as will
policyholder protections, which are stronger under Massachusetts
law than New Hampshire.''
<p>
   Another issue is a proposal to have the state's insurers kick in
community reinvestment money in exchange for a bill that would give
the industry a tax break worth $20 million to $25 million a year.
The industry had long sought the tax break on its investment
income, and virtually all the big insurers  &MD;  save Allmerica  &MD;  were
on board the idea of exchanging the CRA money for the tax cut.
<p>
   Allmerica says it provides significant community investment, but
believes it should be voluntary. ``We don't think it should be a
mandated part of the tax bill,'' Jack Kelly, Allmerica's general
counsel, said in an interview. Thursday
<p>
   By rechartering in New Hampshire, Allmerica would be exempted
from the legislation, which as written would cover only
Massachusetts-chartered companies. The size of the CRA pool is far
from decided, but one industry executive estimated it could
eventually cost Allmerica $5 million to $10 million over five
years.
<p>
   Some industry observers suggested rechartering the company could
also start a slow migration of jobs to New Hampshire, though the
company denied that. The company employs about 3,000 people in
Massachusetts.
<p>
   Allmerica's move must be approved by the state's insurance
commissioner. The state's law allowing redomestication was enacted
in 1994 and five small insurers have since moved their charters to
other states. (A sixth company, Electric Mutual Liability Insurance
Co., has become the subject of a long and bitter fight over its
move to Bermuda, which was approved under the new law.)
<p>
   The law provides the commissioner must approve the move unless
she determines that it hurts Massachusetts policyholders. In a
letter last month to Allmerica's chief executive, insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt said it was unlikely she would approve
the move by the company's Oct. 1 target. She noted that
policyholders who approved the company's recent switch from mutual
to stock company had been promised that Massachusetts would oversee
their interest for at least five years.
<p>
   Ruthardt was subjected to intense criticism for her handling of
Allmerica's demutualization. Although not required, Ruthardt said
she would schedule an ``informational hearing'' on the company's
new proposal.

   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Following is the average ticket
price and Fan Cost Index for National Hockey League teams during
the 1997-98 season, as compiled by Team Marketing Report, a
Chicago-based industry newsletter.
<p>
   The Fan Cost Index is a measure of what it costs a family of
four to attend a game. It consists of the price of two small beers,
four small soft drinks, four hot dogs, parking for one car, two
programs, two caps and four average price tickets.

<p>
   BOSTON -- The state that gave birth to the automobile industry  &MD; 
and arguably the automobile itself  &MD;  is at last beginning to
celebrate its heritage in a manner befitting the importance of the
contribution. But hardly anybody was thinking about Massachusetts's
place in automotive history last week as 6,000 or more people
strolled a showplace lawn in perfect weather to enjoy the elegance
and variety of automobiles.
<p>
   A small event that once taxed the lawn of the Museum of
Transportation has grown in three years to a massive celebration
that is the Castle Hill Concours d'Elegance. The erstwhile concours
of the elite in Brookline, just outside of Boston, has blossomed
into a full-blown public party in Ipswich on Massachusetts' North
Shore..
<p>
   Concours d'Elegance is a judged show of important automobiles
where elegance is the trump card  &MD;  beauty of line, style, visual
appearance.
<p>
   How does an invitational event for the rich get to be a populist
celebration of the automobile? By a happy combination of clear
thinking, good luck, and securing a uniquely elegant venue wherein
6,000 people can stroll and not look like a crowd.
<p>
   And by bringing in the not-quite-concours-but-still-important
vintage collectibles. A mere 83 examples of elegance parked on the
grass will spark interest but maybe not real public desire. Add 300
more very interesting specimens of automotive history, add music,
make sure there is decent food at reasonable prices, ditto adequate
portable toilets, plan for traffic control and parking, and you
have the basics for success. Do it at the Crane estate and you have
the venue for success.
<p>
   Richard T. Crane Jr., rolling in money from manufacturing
plumbing fixtures, commissioned the 59-room Stuart-style mansion
that was completed in 1927. The house and grounds are now under the
care of the Trustees of Reservations and a public park. The
concours has become a fund-raising event for the trustees for the
upkeep of Castle Hill. And it could use some upkeep; the house
standing at the head of the half-mile Grand Allee, a rolling sweep
of lawn ending at seaside, is in good shape and was open last
Sunday for tours. But some of the surrounding terraces, stairways,
and statuary need repair.
<p>
   The Concours d'Elegance is the undertaking of the Vintage Sports
Car Club of America and took place in front of the house with the
Blue Horizon Jazz Band on the porch cranking out Dixie and jazz
appropriate to the day. The proper concours was separated from the
plebian show cars by a terrace, but that was roped off  &MD;  repair is
needed  &MD;  and one trod well-worn paths around it to view the 300 or
so vintage vehicles neatly arrayed in two long lines virtually to
cliffside above the ocean. The avenue between the lines was broad
enough for a bus to make a U-turn  &MD;  there was a crowd but it wasn't
crowded. The crowd was family; kids ran around as kids do, but
there was room for them to run without bothering anybody. And it
was a civilized crowd, friendly, with a distinct absence of litter.
<p>
   On the other side of the house in a courtyard, caterers
mass-produced the obligatory hamburgers and other sustenance. About
the grounds, many had chosen to bring their own picnic provisions.
<p>
   The Castle Hill Concours starts with a private event Saturday, a
traditional hill-climb for the elegant competitors  &MD;  they race.
There is another tradition of sorts, apparently; after the
hill-climb, all adjourn to dinner and listen to the rain. It poured
Saturday night, this year, last year. Once again, Sunday dawned
bright and clear.
<p>
   The event has been compared to Pebble Beach. It attracts many of
the same cars  &MD;  a rare 1933 Pierce Silver Arrow owned by Tom Derro
of Carlisle won the People's Choice Award. Last month, it was voted
Most Elegant at Pebble Beach. Best of Show at Castle Hill was a
magnificent dual-cowled 1939 Buick Saloon Tourer owned by
Christiane Beebe of Madison, Conn.
<p>
   Pebble is as different from Castle Hill as it is the same  &MD; 
Pebble is older and the venue is spectacular, too, the 18th green
of the Pebble Beach Golf Club. It appears more crowded than Castle
Hill with people milling in and around the cars on the grass by the
Pacific Shore. The crowd is moneyed, genteel  &MD;  you can smell the
wealth.
<p>
   Castle Hill has the edge in sheer splendor of site. Pebble Beach
is more expensive  &MD;  $50 a head, but they throw in the program. At
Castle Hill, the admission was $10, $5 for children, $2 for the
program. Pebble has open jitneys  &MD;  you sit along the side of a
bench and get towed from parking areas to show area. Castle Hill
had school buses. It was all very orderly, all a lot of fun. And
where else will you find an ancient Studebaker truck, a big White
woodie, and a Jaguar XKE parked amid the assorted traffic of your
youth, ready for inspection and indulgence in nostalgia.
<p>
   Castle Hill Concours has arrived.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Beijing, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin urged Chinese officials to make planned purchases of Boeing
aircraft before China's President Jiang Zemin visits Washington
next month, U.S. officials said.
<p>
   Rubin suggested to China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during a
meeting yesterday that Beijing announce at least part of what may
be $2 billion in purchases during U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley's visit to China October 6-10, the officials said, requesting
anonymity.
<p>
   ``China wanted President Jiang to announce the deal on his visit
to Washington on Oct. 28,'' one U.S. official said. ``However, the
Treasury Secretary asked Vice Premier Zhu to move up the
announcement of the deal.''
<p>
   Rubin, who ended a three-day visit to mainland China today, said
he did not press the Chinese for a specific sales commitment. ``In
what I hope was a very effective fashion, I did try . to raise in
an appropriate fashion our interests in moving forward with respect
to the Boeing airplane sales.''
<p>
   The Chinese appreciated that, officials familiar with the talks
said. Zhu contrasted the U.S. approach with that of French
President Jacques Chirac, who demanded the Chinese buy 100 planes
from European planemaker Airbus Industrie.
<p>
   Announcements of big-ticket contracts are often a staple of
state visits. In this case, though, while the Clinton
administration has been pressing hard for the Boeing order, Rubin
told the Chinese the administration is sensitive about President
Bill Clinton being linked to business deals involving China, a U.S.
official said.
<p>
   The U.S. Democratic Party has been criticized for receiving
foreign campaign funding during the 1996 election. Republicans in
Congress charged that Chinese donations may have illegally been
routed to the Clinton re-election campaign. Chinese officials have
denied those charges.
<p>
   The separation of the summit and a big aircraft deal is also in
the interest of Boeing Co., the world's biggest aircraft producer.
The Seattle, Washington-based company has seen its sales in China
regularly snagged in recent years by the often-turbulent U.S.-China
relations.
<p>
   ``Politics and business should be separated, that's what Boeing
wants,'' said Chen Jiande, Beijing-based spokesman for Boeing,
earlier this week.
<p>
   China is one of the world's fastest growing civil aviation
markets, expanding 9.3 percent in the first eight months of the
year. China will buy about one in ten commercial jetliners made
over the next 20 years, aircraft makers estimate.
<p>
   In recent years, China has announced all its major aircraft
orders for Boeing or Europe's Airbus during high level political
visits.
<p>
   The last big Boeing order, for five wide-body 777s jets worth
about $700 million came during Vice President Al Gore's March visit
to Beijing, while Airbus sold 30 narrow-body jets worth $1.5
billion during Chirac's visit in May.
<p>
   In this round, a U.S. official said China has agreed in
principle to place ``a very large'' order for Boeing aircraft. For
the record, though, Chinese officials are disputing that it's a
done deal.
<p>
   ``We don't know anything definite yet,'' said Wang Zhi, director
of the planning department of China's Civil Aviation
Administration, which controls aircraft orders.
<p>
   Boeing aircraft are not the only economic contracts under
discussion, the U.S. officials said.
<p>
   China is ``ready to move ahead'' on the purchase of one or more
power plants, including a nuclear power plant, the U.S. officials
said. The purchase could be made from General Electric Co. or
Westinghouse Electric Corp.
<p>
   For any sale of nuclear equipment, President Clinton will have
to grant a waiver for the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology.
<p>
   One U.S. official said the waiver is likely to be granted.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Seagull Energy Corp., an oil
and natural-gas company based in Houston, sold $150 million of
30-year bonds, an unusually long maturity for a company with one
junk-bond rating.
<p>
   Moody's Investors Service, which boosted Seagull's credit rating
by two notches over the last year, rates the company ``Ba1,'' the
highest junk-bond rating. Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. raised Seagull's
rating in September to ``BBB-,'' the lowest investment-grade
rating.
<p>
   Investors refer to companies that straddle the investment-grade
line a ``split-rated,'' or ``cross-over,'' credit. Most companies
with at least one junk rating sell debt that matures in a maximum
of 10 years.
<p>
   ``It's one of the first cross-over credits in the oil sector to
issue 30-year debt,'' said Mark DeVito, managing director of debt
capital markets at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which arranged the public
sale. ``It was sold all to investment-grade buyers.''
<p>
   The 7.5 percent bonds were priced to yield 115 basis points more
than the 30-year Treasury. Merrill received bids for two times more
than bonds were available.
<p>
   ``We think it shows good confidence in Seagull,'' said Stephen
Thorington, treasurer at the company, which has oil exploration and
production sites in the U.S., Egypt and Ivory Coast.
<p>
   Proceeds will be used to pay down bank debt, he said.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Bandag Inc., which makes
tire-retreading materials and equipment, filed to sell its 8.1
percent stake in HON Industries Inc., a fireplace and office
furniture manufacturer.
<p>
   In addition, HON Industries will sell 1 million shares in the
offering, and expects to raise $51.7 million after expenses, if the
shares sell for 54 3/8, the closing market price yesterday,
according to an S-3 registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission today.
<p>
   Bandag and HON Industries are both based in Muscatine, Iowa.
Bandag expects to raise $105.8 million after expenses for the
shares, which were purchased in 1987 and 1988 for about $24.4
million, said Warren Heidbreder, Bandag's chief executive officer.
<p>
   ``With the gain we hope to realize, we are very satisfied with
that investment,'' Heidbreder said, adding that he expects the sale
to be finalized by late October.
<p>
   HON Industries' stock rose 109 percent to a 52-week high of 64
on Aug. 8 from 30 1/2 last November. It has fallen in recent
trading and was at 54 5/8, up 1/4, in midday trading today.
<p>
   Bandag intends to use the proceeds from its stock sale to pay
for a portion of its previously announced purchase of five
independent franchisees.
<p>
   On Aug. 27, Bandag agreed to buy five tire dealerships for about
$158.5 million. The combined dealerships will operate through a
subsidiary, Tire Distributor Systems Inc. Until now, Bandag has
relied on its network of 1,300 independent franchised dealers.
<p>
   HON Industries will use its stock sale proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including to repay debt used to finance
acquisitions in fiscal year 1996 and 1997, the filing said. That
debt matures on June 11, 2002 and bears interest at a variable
rate, currently 5.9 percent.
<p>
   HON Industries will use its remaining credit to finance capital
expenditures and any future acquisitions.
<p>
   ``At this stage we're always looking for opportunities, but I'd
rather not make a specific comment about what we have in the
pipeline,'' said James Johnson, HON Industries' general counsel.
<p>
   The stock sale will increase HON Industries' outstanding common
shares by 3 percent to 30.67 million shares, according to the
filing.
<p>
   Bandag's stock rose 1/8 in midday trading to 52 1/2.
<p>
   Roy Carver founded the tire-retreading company in 1957. After
his death in 1981, Carver left one of the largest charitable trusts
in the history of Iowa, which is used primarily for educational
purposes, Heidberger said.
<p>
   Carver's son Martin now serves as Bandag's chairman, chief
executive and president, and Roy Carver's widow Lucille is a
company director.
<p>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. will underwrite the stock sale, with William
Blair &AMP; Co., Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co., McDonald &AMP; Co. and Securities
Inc.

<p>
   Minneapolis, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Northwest Airlines Corp.
and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will sign an agreement Monday that
ends their feud and extends a profitable trans-Atlantic alliance
for 10 years.
<p>
   The signing, scheduled for the Rockefeller Center's Rainbow Room
in New York, will be a very public ending to a very public spat. A
1994 attempt by KLM to increase its equity stake in Northwest
triggered adoption of a ``poison pill'' takeover defense by
Northwest and the filing of two lawsuits by KLM. The agreement, in
which Minneapolis-based Northwest will buy back the Dutch flag
carrier's 19 percent stake for $1.17 billion by 2000, will lead to
even closer cooperation, analysts said. Making peace allows the
airlines to build new routes as traffic expands, link their cargo
businesses, and gives KLM the chance to look for a second partner
in Europe.
<p>
   ``You now have two parties trying to work together, rather than
trying to figure out how they can sever their relationship,'' said
Tom Schreier, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst. ``All the
elements of the alliance haven't been put in place yet.''
<p>
   Under the current structure, KLM and Northwest coordinate
marketing, transfer passengers seamlessly from one to the other,
and share revenue on some international routes. The alliance
received an antitrust exemption from the U.S. Justice Department in
1993, since there was little route overlap, and has been profitable
for both companies since the beginning. It generated about $150
million of operating profit last year, with about $100 million
going to KLM.
<p>
   Northwest/KLM flights between the U.S. and Europe have been
steadily carrying more passengers. According to International
Onboard traffic data, Northwest boosted its U.S.-European traffic
by 16.3 percent from 1995 to 1996, the largest gain of any major
U.S. carrier. KLM recorded a 9.3 percent increase.
<p>
   ``They've had good healthy gains,'' said George Hamlin, senior
vice president of Global Aviation Associates. ``It would certainly
appear that the total is more than the sum of the parts.''
<p>
   Northwest and KLM are expected to expand into new geographic
areas as part of their expanded alliance. Already they are
inaugurating joint-venture service from Amsterdam to New Delhi next
week.
<p>
   ``I wouldn't rule out joint applications for new routes and
entering new markets,'' Schreier said.
<p>
   Other potential areas of cooperation include cargo flights as
well as the sharing of frequent flier databases and computerized
reservation systems, analysts said. That would take the NWA-KLM
alliance, the oldest such partnership, far beyond what any other
carriers have done.
<p>
   ``They're going into uncharted waters,'' said Arthur
Calavritinos, an analyst with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which
owned 602,900 Northwest shares as of June.
<p>
   The agreement may allow KLM managers to spend more time trying
to get another European partner, possibly Italy's Alitalia SpA. KLM
wants to link up with other European airlines to compete with much
larger rivals.
<p>
   Northwest shares fell 21/32 to 41 5/8 in midafternoon trading.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange said it will raise the margins on natural gas futures
contracts at the close of trading Monday.
<p>
   The Nymex gave no reason for the change though it follows a
surge in prices this week to their highest since January.
<p>
   Margins are deposits traders must make with the exchange when
buying or selling futures contracts to ensure obligations will be
met.
<p>
   The margins on natural gas contracts will be raised to $3,000
from $2,500 for clearing members, to $3,300 from $2,750 for members
and to $4,050 from $3,375 for customers.

 &UR; COMPANIES RUSH TO SELL BONDS: CANADA DEBT WATCH (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By Corey Goldman, through the Toronto newsroom &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
   (Adds comparison of current corporate debt issues to those of
1995.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Toronto, Sept.26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's corporate debt market,
once the exclusive domain of the country's banks and utilities, is
fast becoming a lucrative arena for all types of companies looking
to raise cash.
<p>
   In the past two months alone, Canadian companies have sold more
than C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) of bonds in Canada's fledgling
debt market, paving the way for a second consecutive record year of
corporate issues. A large amount of that is what traders described
as lower-grade debt, often referred to as junk.
<p>
   With the Bank of Canada poised to raise interest rates to keep
inflation in check and federal and provincial governments
approaching balanced budgets -- lessening their need to sell bonds
-- even more Canadian firms will turn to Canada's emerging
corporate debt market for capital, analysts said, using more
high-risk issues than have previously been offered in Canada.
<p>
   ``With rates so low and government supply on the decline,
investors have been clamoring for more product and higher yield,''
said Paul Hancock, a portfolio manager with Investors Group Inc. in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
<p>
   So far this year, as much as C$18.5 billion of corporate bonds
have been sold in Canada, surpassing last year's record of C$15.6
billion, according to the Investment Dealers' Association of
Canada.
<p>
   That figure should top C$20 billion by year's end -- a 60
percent increase from the C$8.5 billion of company bonds issued in
1990 -- bringing the total amount of corporate debt outstanding in
Canada to more than C$100 billion, Hancock said.
<p>
   Much of that has been junk -- debt with an official rating of
``BB'' or lower. Junk bonds, which are more common in the larger
U.S. debt market, pay higher yields than other securities because
the company selling them is considered at more risk than a bank,
utility or the government.
<p>
   Traditionally, banks and utilities were the largest and often
the only corporate borrowers in Canada because few investors were
willing to buy anything riskier than government issues.
<p>
   In the last two years, though, as yields on government bonds
have dipped to record lows, Canadian companies have turned their
attention to Canadian investors who are seeking higher yields --and
are willing to take greater investment risks than in the past to
get them.
<p>
   ``We like to say, `the sun, the moon and the stars have all
lined up,''' said Al Mawani, chief financial officer of Oxford
Properties Group Inc. Oxford recently raised C$100 million by
selling six-year, 6.93 percent debentures. The bonds are rated
``BBB'' by Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd.
<p>
   Several factors are persuading firms that Canada, rather than
the U.S., is the No. 1 place to sell debt, Mawani said.
<p>
   For one thing, supply of Canadian government debt is rapidly
shrinking. The federal government isn't issuing new bonds and, with
a balanced budget now expected this fiscal year, dwindling supply
isn't matching rising demand. Several provinces, most notably
Alberta and Saskatchewan, are close behind.
<p>
   For another, Canada's outlook for sustained growth with subdued
inflation has made fixed-income securities increasingly attractive,
particularly issues that offer high yields.
<p>
   What's more, companies and their shareholders benefit because
the company is able to raise cash in the domestic market and avoid
losing on the exchange between Canadian and U.S. dollars.
<p>
   ``It's crucial that you get a wide variation in your portfolio,
and the more high-yield debt that's issued in Canada the easier it
is to accomplish that,'' Hancock said.
<p>
   He recently bought bonds from Call-Net Enterprises Inc., Trizec
Hahn Corp., Oxford Properties and Clearnet Communications Inc.,
among others. As much as 10 percent of his portfolio consists of
high-yield debt, or bonds with a rating of ``BB'' or lower.
<p>
   Toronto-based Clearnet recently sold C$320 million of 10-year,
11.75 percent junk bonds, the largest and most successful offering
of its kind in the country's history. The success of the issue was
unusual because the bonds don't pay any interest to holders for the
first five years.
<p>
   ``Our issue principally broke the log jam on corporate debt
issuance in Canada,'' said Robert MacFarlane, Clearnet's chief
operating officer. ``We saw the economy doing well, interest rates
at near-historic lows and pools of bond money not having government
product to buy. We took advantage of that.''
<p>
   Other Canadian companies are also joining the ranks of corporate
debt issuers.
<p>
   Dundee Bankcorp Inc., which manages investment portfolios for
mutual funds and corporate pensions, recently raised C$150 million
by selling 10-year issues at almost 100 basis points above the
10-year government bond's yield.
<p>
   ``We're locking in a loan, basically, at 6.70 percent over 10
years, which is a pretty cheap way to raise money,'' said Ray
Benzinger, Dundee's chief financial officer. ``With that kind of
rate, we think it was a pretty smart thing to do.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of the start of a sustained
period of pro-independence demonstrations in Tibet, and while
public demonstrations have become more sporadic in recent years,
the cause continues to attract sympathy and support.
<p>
   In both Chinese and Western eyes, the emotional focus of the
Tibetan independence movement remains the Dalai Lama, the
62-year-old god-king. And althoughhis own position on independence
is less than absolutist, he is at least the symbol of whatever is
meant by ``Tibet.'' In ``Kundun,'' British journalist Mary Craig
provides a fresh background for understanding the role of the Dalai
Lama.
<p>
   ``Kundun,'' meaning ``presence of the Buddha,'' is a reverential
title for the Dalai Lama  &MD;  and the title of a forthcoming Martin
Scorsese film. Rather than treat the Dalai Lama as an incarnate
deity, however, the book places him in the context of his family,
based on extensive interviews with his kin.
<p>
   While other political-religious symbols (e.g., the pope) have
families, rarely do they play so prominent a role as have the Dalai
Lama's mother, his six brothers and sisters, and their spouses and
children. The Dalai Lama's older brother, Gyalo Thondup, is
described by Craig as ``urbane and articulate'' and able ``to think
globally.'' Known as GT, he organized the Committee for Social
Welfare, which became the nerve center of the Tibetan resistance
movement, and he appears to have been the CIA's main contact in the
movement.
<p>
   In 1994, then living in Beijing, GT attempted to advise the
Chinese government on how to handle the search for the
reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the second-ranking Tibetan
religious leader who had died in 1989. When the Dalai Lama
announced that a reincarnation had been found, Gyalo Thondup told
Craig, ``I warned (the Chinese) to be very careful how they handled
the situation.'' But, he said, ``they didn't take any notice, of
course,'' and the Chinese named their own choice, exacerbating
Chinese-Tibetan relations.
<p>
   The most appealing of the Dalai Lama's siblings in Craig's
account is his younger sister, Jetsun Pema. After accompanying the
family into exile in Dharamsala, India, Pema was educated at
finishing schools in Switzerland and London. On her return to
India, she took over the Tibetan Children's Village, now a network
of nine shelters for orphans.
<p>
   Later named minister of education in the exile government, Pema
played a key role in Chinese-Tibetan relations in 1979 when she led
a ``fact-finding'' delegation to Tibet (following one led by
Lobsang Samten, the sibling closest in age to the Dalai Lama).
These delegations had been organized by Gyalo Thondup with the
encouragement of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who expected they
would prove to the Tibetan exiles how beneficial Chinese occupation
had been, and perhaps pave the way for rapprochement. But their
findings confirmed the worst Tibetan suspicions. ``It was one
horror story after another,'' Pema told Craig. Of villagers she was
allowed to meet with during a three-month tour, ``they all spoke of
terrible suffering, of torture, of death, of starvation.''
<p>
   Such firsthand experiences by trusted family members provide a
context for the Dalai Lama's firm but flexible position on the
future of Tibet, one that is cautious and wary about the Chinese
but willing to accept less than full independence in order to
preserve Tibetan culture. Craig's reporting of these experiences is
a valuable contribution to understanding of the Dalai Lama's
political position.
<p>
   Like most other writers on Tibet, Craig relies greatly on Melyvn
C. Goldstein's authoritative ``History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951:
The Demise of the Lamaist State.'' Goldstein has now carried his
account forward in the forthcoming ``The Snow Lion and the
Dragon,'' in which he outlines the options for China and for the
Dalai Lama. ``Time,'' Goldstein writes, ``does not appear to be on
the Dalai Lama's side,'' because the longer China is allowed to
transform Tibetan society and culture, the more difficult it will
be to reverse.
<p>
   Goldstein fears the possibility of a Tibetan-style intifada  &MD; 
followed by full-scale military repression. But he believes
compromise is possible, something like the ``one country, two
systems'' approach to Hong Kong. In achieving this, the Dalai Lama
would be ``the key element,'' returning to Lhasa and persuading
Tibetans that ``a truly Tibetan Tibet is not incompatible with
being a part of China.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted today to bar the federal government from
promoting the export or overseas sales of tobacco, delivering
another congressional blow against the tobacco industry.
<p>
   By a voice vote, the House approved a measure to bar the United
States Trade Representative, the Commerce Department, and several
other U.S. agencies from using its funds to promote U.S. tobacco
products outside the U.S., except in cases where it was purposely
discriminated against.
<p>
   Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg says he will seek to include
the measure in similar legislation moving through the Senate, and
lawmakers predicted it will become law this year.
<p>
   ``American taxpayers have been used to promote addicting other
people's children to the nicotine drug,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett
of Texas, who sponsored the amendment in the House. ``This
amendment will stop that.''
<p>
   The trade measure is the latest in a series of attacks on the
tobacco industry this year. Congress earlier this month repealed a
$50 billion tax break for the industry slipped into last summer's
balanced budget amendment. It approved $34 million next year for
the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco control program, and
raised cigarette taxes by 15 cents in the tax bill.
<p>
   Today's measure prevents the U.S. agencies funded by the
Commerce, Justice, State annual spending bill from promoting
tobacco. That includes Commerce or State Department employees,
along with the trade representatives and ambassadors.
<p>
   The bill was amended to allow U.S. trade officials to step in if
another country was discriminating against U.S. tobacco products
while supporting local products or imports from other nations. It
would allow the USTR to step in if a country allowed domestic
advertising while banning U.S. ads, for example.
<p>
   That change was made at the request of Republican Rep. Harold
Rogers of Kentucky, who sought to ensure that the U.S. would not
allow tobacco products to be purposefully discriminated against
outside the U.S. ``We wanted a fairer playing field than what was
in the original amendment,'' said Rogers spokeswoman, Susan
Zimmerman.
<p>
   The USTR is charged with supporting the export and sale of U.S.
products overseas, opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, lowering
trade barriers and tariffs, and negotiating free trade agreements.
<p>
   It aggressively promoted tobacco -- along with other U.S.
products -- in years past. Under the Clinton administration, is
agreed to accept foreign restrictions on U.S. tobacco products,
including advertising bans and health labels, as long as they were
also required on domestic products.
<p>
   Recently anti-tobacco advocates and their congressional allies
have increasingly called for the U.S. to stop promoting tobacco
overseas at all, arguing that it is hypocritical for the U.S. to
seek restrictions on tobacco products in the U.S., while at the
same time promoting the project in other countries.
<p>
   ``While the Marlboro Man has been forced to the negotiating
table in the U.S., he's twirling his rope around the throats of
children around the world,'' Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg said.

<p>
   ``Kicked in the Head'' is a larger-budgeted version of Matthew
Harrison's impressive ``Rhythm Thief,'' made on a shoestring in
1995. Like that film, it's about a young man hurtling through a few
chaotic days on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. This time,
though, the giddy propulsiveness, vibrant lyricism, and rude humor
of the original are far less apparent.
<p>
   It can at least be said that the film loses no time finding its
central metaphor in classic newsreel footage of the crash-and-burn
landing of the Hindenburg zeppelin. Kevin Corrigan's Redmond, the
film's protagonist, is on a similar down cycle, having been evicted
from his apartment, fired from his job and about to be led into
lethal disaster by his small-time criminal uncle, played by James
Woods with a rollickingly profane heartiness that never is able to
avoid seeming overpitched and hollow.
<p>
   The same fate overtakes the film. It extends to Michael
Rapaport's buddy figure, Stretch, a beer distributor caught in a
turf war he thinks he can settle with a gun. In a further metaphor
for what the film becomes, Stretch and his competitors wave big
guns around and fire a lot of shots, but never hit anything. While
trying to stay alive after emerging from a shootout clutching a
brick of stolen cocaine, Redmond stops telling himself he's on a
spiritual quest just long enough to fall for a world-weary
stewardess he glimpses while riding the el in Queens.
<p>
   As the reluctant love object, Linda Fiorentino's smoky,
depressed allure is one of the few things that works in the film,
but even she can do only so much to supply the inner tension
``Kicked in the Head'' so conspicuously lacks. Lili Taylor, as a
woman inexplicably stuck on Redmond, is stranded, romantically and
dramatically. Burt Young is stuck with a lexicon of slow burns as
the drug dealer wondering where his cocaine went. Possibly into
Redmond's frequent ``Planet of the Apes'' allusions. ``Kicked in
the Head'' is a film filled with energies looking for something
worth fastening themselves to. Harrison remains a filmmaker of
immense promise. Just not in this film.

likely to see their street fashion and their language translated
into the popular culture. But wherever they congregate, the rules
tend to remain constant. Teen-agers like to cluster. They seek
excitement and romance. They flirt with danger. They fight a
constant battle against crushing boredom and curfews.

<p>
   Biloxi, Mississippi, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- It's easy to see
why residents of Biloxi, Mississippi, a sun-bleached town on the
Gulf of Mexico, divide time into two eras -- before-Steve Wynn and
after.
<p>
   Rising 29 stories above the cheap motels, gas stations and
antebellum mansions is Wynn's newest monument to chance: A
$600-million casino that will rank as the fifth-costliest ever
built once it opens in late 1998.
<p>
   Where the chief executive of Mirage Resorts Inc. goes others
follow, and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., Harrah's Entertainment
Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp. and others are thinking of building or
expanding existing casinos nearby. If they do, Wynn and his rivals
could turn part of the nation's poorest state into the No. 3
gambling mecca after Atlantic City, New Jersey and Las Vegas.
<p>
   ``Steve Wynn taught us a lot,'' said Michael Olivier, economic
development director of Harrison County, which includes Biloxi.
``He helped us dream bigger.''
<p>
   No one in the gambling business dreams bigger than Wynn, 55, who
in the past decade built a string of ever-more extravagant Las
Vegas casinos. The granddaddy of them all, Bellagio, a $1.25
billion complex scheduled to open next year, spurred his rivals to
start building a new generation of opulent gambling parlors on the
city's famed Strip.
<p>
   Wynn has his reasons for the Mississippi foray. The Las Vegas
market is slowing and competition fiercer than ever. To lift
earnings, Mirage needs fresh markets.
<p>
   Two years ago, Wynn picked Biloxi, a town of 50,000 that boasts
white sand beaches, warm weather, low taxes on gambling and a
grateful work force.
<p>
   When Mirage's Beau Rivage opens in the fourth quarter of 1998,
it will have 1,800 rooms, a salon, spa, banquet halls, meeting
space, 12 restaurants and 25,000-square feet of retail space -- and
serve as a point of local pride as Mississippi's tallest building.
<p>
   ``There's a lot of sex appeal to the place,'' said Mirage
Executive Vice President Barry Shier, who brought Mississippi to
Wynn's attention.
<p>
   The state's Gulf coast also drew the attention of Mirage's
competitors. Grand Casinos Inc., which owns two casinos on the
coast, is adding 900 hotel rooms and sprucing up its properties at
a cost of $160 million, while Las Vegas businessman Ralph
Englestadt is building a $300 million casino nearby.
<p>
   At least five other large casino concerns are expanding or
considering projects in the area.
<p>
   If all are built, the region's annual casino revenue could rise
to $1.2 billion or more from $750 million last year, analysts said.
By comparison, Atlantic City is the biggest casino market with
$3.81 billion in revenue last year, while the Las Vegas Strip had
$3.58 billion.
<p>
   ``If the Mirage is a success, then other properties'' will be
built on the coast, said Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. analyst Jason Ader.
<p>
   It would be a welcome break for Biloxi and the 75-mile stretch
of Mississippi shoreline that's part of the ``Redneck Riviera,''
which includes the coasts of Alabama and Florida's Panhandle. The
region prospered in the 1970s, drawing vacationing oil wildcatters
from Texas and Louisiana. When the price of oil plunged from almost
$30 a barrel to less than $10 in 1986, it took much of the region's
economy with it.
<p>
   By the late 1980s, Biloxi was in such bad shape ``we couldn't
buy tires for the police cars,'' said the city's mayor, A.J.
Holloway.
<p>
   In 1990, in the midst of a nationwide recession that was
especially hard on Mississippi, the state legislature passed a
gambling bill.
<p>
   Local casino developers flocked to the coast. By last year, 11
casinos were in business representing $1 billion in investment.
<p>
   Yet, like many of the new gambling jurisdictions voters approved
in the early 1990s, growth in Mississippi's Gulf coast gambling
industry stalled. The first casinos were shoestring affairs run by
local entrepreneurs, appealing only to day-trippers who came,
gambled and left.
<p>
   ``In 1994 we ran into a brick wall,'' says Chevis Swetman, the
chief executive of closely held Peoples Bank in Biloxi.
<p>
   Enter Wynn, with his plan to make the region a destination where
gamblers from all over the eastern U.S. come for overnight stays.
What he saw was a market with appealing ingredients.
<p>
   For one, the coast is less than two hours by plane from cities
such as Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and Miami, and its airport -- with
the longest runway in the state -- can handle Boeing 747s.
<p>
   Another draw: Mississippi's low tax rate -- 12 percent of casino
revenue compared with about 25 percent in other states.
<p>
   ``The market has great potential to position itself as one of
the finest resorts in the East,'' said Mirage's Shier.
<p>
   Nor is there the opposition to gambling that stifles expansion
in some parts of the country. Quite the opposite, and many locals
say they are thankful for the new jobs.
<p>
   ``The casinos have given this town a lot,'' said retired Biloxi
truck driver Raymond Ricard. ``People couldn't get jobs. Now they
are working.''
<p>
   Indeed, between 1990 and 1995, 62 percent of the 18,100 new jobs
in the Biloxi area were in casinos, according to Harrison County's
development commission. Meanwhile, the number of food-stamp and
welfare recipients has dropped.
<p>
   Of course, crime and gambling addiction has also increased, as
6.5 million people flocked to the coast last year -- a number
that's sure to rise when Wynn's casino opens.
<p>
   That's a price many locals say they are willing to pay in a
state that ranks last in many measures of economic well-being. And
if Wynn is what it takes to make Biloxi a casino-destination resort
to rival Las Vegas and Atlantic City, so be it.
<p>
   ``If Steve Wynn can't do it,'' said Jed Whitley, a bartender at
McElroy's Harbor House Seafood Restaurant in Biloxi, ``then it
ain't going to happen.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   Las Vegas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- ITT Corp.'s plan to split
into three companies won't be considered by the Nevada Gaming
Commission until a federal judge decides whether it's legal, Nevada
regulators said.
<p>
   The regulatory panel voted 3-2 Thursday to delay any action
until after U.S. Judge Phillip Pro rules next week on Hilton Hotels
Corp.'s bid to block ITT's plans without shareholder approval.
<p>
   Hilton, which has launched a hostile $11.5 billion takeover bid
for ITT's Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars World casinos, contends
ITT is illegally denying shareholders a vote on the spinoffs. ITT,
which operates Nevada casinos, needs state regulators' approval for
the spinoffs.
<p>
   ``The gaming commission concluded the issue wasn't ripe for
consideration with the hearing set for next week,'' said Marc
Grossman, a spokesman for Hilton.
<p>
   It's ITT's first setback in convincing state regulators to
approve the spinoffs, which Hilton contends is a part of ITT's
strategy to ward off a takeover.
<p>
   New Jersey gaming officials signed off on ITT's plans earlier
today while Mississippi regulators approved the spinoff earlier
this month. ITT operates casinos in both states.
<p>
   Nevada regulators said they plan to meet immediately after Pro
delivers his decision, which could come as early as Monday.

<TEXT>
<p>
   ``Different for Girls'' is the kind of original film that
wistfully seems to wish it didn't have to be so original.
Essentially the first post-``Crying Game'' romantic comedy, it's
about a working-class motorcycle courier who falls in love with a
gentle transsexual. It's never smirking, always sympathetic, never
sentimental. It likes its characters, and clearly wishes they
didn't have to go through so much in order to proceed with their
obviously mutual affection. But they do. It was ingenious of
scriptwriter Tony Marchant to ensure that both have to undergo
untraditional rites of passage. And to ironically structure the
story so that Steven Mackintosh's delicate, refined Kim, formerly
Karl, is several steps ahead of Rupert Graves's Prentice.
<p>
   On several counts, in fact, there's a refreshing feeling of new
ground being covered. On the one hand, it's about what happens
after a transsexual undergoes the sex-change operation, how she
gets on with life. In a wisely structured piece of irony,
Mackintosh's Kim is the quiet one who asks only to be left alone to
pursue, unnoticed, a perfectly conventional life. In the film,
Kim's make-over is complete, right down to the post-operative
counseling. On the other hand, it's Prentice's emotional makeover
that generates the problems, starting when he freaks out after
first being attracted to Kim, then realizing she's the boy he saved
from being beaten up in the shower room at the school they both
went to 20 years ago.
<p>
   Since then, both have been, at best, getting by. Kim's only
emotional contact is with her sister (Saskia Reeves), who lives
under strain with her macho career-soldier husband in a subplot
that seems designed chiefly to remind us that so-called normal
people have their troubles, too. Kim channels her feelings into a
safe, genteel, banal job  &MD;  writing greeting card verses. Prentice,
sweet and good-hearted, is locked into the look and stance of his
'70s punk youth. He'd be inclined to loosen Kim up, teach her to
relax and live a little, if he weren't so conflicted about being
attracted to a woman who once was a man. His erratic behavior not
only threatens to sabotage any chance of a relationship; it
threatens to destroy Kim's life as well when a piece of unruly
behavior lands them both in jail, where Kim's mortal fear of cops
works against her.
<p>
   The question is whether they'll be able to work their way to an
actual love story by hurdling the obstacles that society  &MD;  and
their own acquiescence to stereotyping  &MD;  has placed in their way.
What makes the film so likable is that it stretches audiences just
as surely as it stretches Graves and Mackintosh as actors. Each is
enormously appealing. The secret of Mackintosh's winning
performance is that it's never excessive or even extroverted, much
less swishy. Kim's character emerges  &MD;  and grows on us  &MD;  through
Mackintosh's way of revealing subtly nuanced expressions of feeling
from beneath Kim's armor of shyness. Graves convinces us there's a
gentle nobility at the core of Prentice's heart as well, if only he
can mature enough to grow into the courage to believe in it and
live it. ``Different for Girls'' is something different for film.
It's poignant, entertaining, exhilaratingly inclusive.

<p>
   If noble intentions were enough to float a movie, Wim Wenders's
``The End of Violence'' would be home free. Not that that's what
Wenders is after, exactly, in this meditation on images as delivery
systems for violence  &MD;  especially as dispensed by American pop
culture. He'd like to cut through a welter of plot strands to
arrive at a resurrection of innocence in the floating world of
laid-back LA anxiety and death. It can't be said that he completely
succeeds. The film is too distended and cerebral, the characters
too often just icons in a morality play, lacking dramatic focus and
urgency. Ultimately, the film falls victim to its own generosity.
But of how many films can that be said? That's what I like about
it.
<p>
   In a way that's never entirely able to avoid seeming forced and
schematic, the film merges two plot strands. One revolves around
Max, Bill Pullman's rich, arrogant producer of action movies. Alone
on the terrace of his oceanside mansion, absorbed in his laptop,
he's ignoring his trophy wife (Andie MacDowell) and ignoring the
stuntwoman (Traci Lind) who's having an increasingly difficult time
working for him. Presumably he's talking to his money. When his
wife threatens to walk out, he can barely bring himself to react.
But then his life is turned upside down when he finds himself at
the mercy of a couple of carjackers underneath a freeway overpass.
<p>
   For reasons not clear to him, they're on the verge of rubbing
him out and making off with his Mercedes, although, in the film's
humorous peak, he almost scams them out of it by offering them
points in his latest production. Then he finds deliverance, twice.
Mysteriously, gunshots bring the hit men down. Max staggers off and
finds refuge with a family of Mexican gardeners whom, ironically,
he never noticed when they tended his grounds. Warmly and
matter-of-factly taken in by the family, stripped of what had
corrupted him, he undergoes a spiritual rebirth. This coincides
with a spiritual crisis assailing Gabriel Byrne's Ray, a computer
whiz who had e-mailed Max a 400-page document outlining the secret
government project on which Ray is working, holed up in Griffith
Park Observatory.
<p>
   Ray  &MD;  protagonist of the other plot strand  &MD;  is setting up a
network of covert surveillance cameras. His ominous boss tells him
that they'll cut response time to crime by 200 percent, thus
putting an end to violence, incidentally rescuing Max by remote
control and giving the film its ironically intended title. Although
we are told, for obvious reasons of plot convenience, that Ray is a
big fan of Max's movies, it is not clear why Ray is trusting Max,
of all people, with such sensitive information. As Ray's soul
becomes ever more clouded, complicated by having to care for his
Alzheimer's-ridden father (homage-oriented casting here  &MD;  director
Sam Fuller), Wenders's other main concern emerges: the
institutionalized violence of the eradication of free will by
governments that, in Orwellian fashion, know what's good for you,
and impose it.
<p>
   The trouble is that the clouding of Ray's soul, to say nothing
of Ray himself, seems murky and ill-formed, much like his image,
kept in shadow. Like James Dean, his spiritual brother all those
years ago at the Griffith Park Observatory in ``Rebel Without a
Cause,'' he means to fight the good fight, which includes assuming
responsibility for a Salvadoran refugee woman sent to service him
sexually  &MD;  and empty his wastebaskets. Meanwhile, Max's spiritual
transformation strains credibility, as does the unintentionally
patronizing depiction of the Mexican gardening family as noble
savages, continuing to offer Max sanctuary as he goes off on a
crusade to right some wrongs he has spawned. If he can't dismantle
his evil empire back home, which his wife now rules with an iron
will, he can at least wage war on gangsta rap, which he does.
<p>
   You will have gathered that ``The End of Violence'' doesn't
exactly bring its concerns to throbbing dramatic life. It remains
schematic, undercut by the fact that Wenders seems at bottom too
much in love with American pop culture  &MD;  vulgarity, crassness, and
all  &MD;  to wade in and deliver the Swiftian hatchet job the film
promises. But at least it has concerns worth having, even if it
fails to follow through with a really incisive attack. That being
said, check the film out anyway, because although it has some
conspicuous shortcomings, there's a lot to like  &MD;  and even admire  &MD; 
in it, beyond its ethical base.
<p>
   Unlike Antonioni's ``Blow-Up,'' which it recalls (along with
Godard's chill sci-fi ``Alphaville''), ``The End of Violence'' is
optimistic. The man who made ``Wings of Desire'' is still very much
on the side of the angels here, even though this new effort plays
like that film's less exalted sequel, ``Faraway, So Close.'' When
he has Loren Dean's Candide-like cop observe that in nuclear
physics, if you look at a particle, you change it, Wenders
obviously wants to believe that art, looking at sinister forces in
society, can change those, too. He's serious, endearingly quixotic,
and worth spending a couple of hours with, even if he can't quite
pull together all the elements of his film. He's an incurable
romantic who believes that while big government can't be redeemed,
Hollywood can.

<TEXT>
<p>
   ``The Edge'' is mostly corny macho mano-a-mano stuff, made
watchable by spectacular scenery and a lot of understatement in
Anthony Hopkins's performance and David Mamet's screenplay  &MD;  until
an overwrought ending brings it down. The economical script wastes
no time getting down to business, throwing together Hopkins's
taciturn billionaire bookworm and Alec Baldwin's flashy fashion
photographer, who just may want to kill the billionaire so he can
pursue the guy's wife, model Elle Macpherson, unimpeded. The catch
is that the two potential antagonists need one another to survive
after their small plane crash-lands in the Yukon wilderness, far
from their comfortable rented lodge, while they're on a photo
shoot.
<p>
   Also, if there's going to be any killing, it's clearly going to
involve a huge Kodiak that director Lee Tamahori rightly calls the
John Wayne of bears. It's a man-eater, it has smelled their blood,
it's tracking them, and it's hungry. It's also a scene-stealer,
inevitably so since it's at the center of the scariest bear fights
ever captured by a studio film. But the best parts of ``The Edge''
involve battles of wits, where Hopkins's character has the clear
advantage. He's the one who keeps improvising solutions to keep
them going in the harsh terrain. Baldwin's cocky photographer,
meanwhile, is clever enough to conceal any malevolent intent,
realizing he needs the resourceful billionaire if he himself is
going to survive.
<p>
   So the film comes down to a series of terse, tense exchanges
between the men. They don't reveal much, though, as they take one
another's measure while floating speculations about homosexual
bonding and the best method of turning the tables on a bear that's
crashing and drooling through the woods after you. Predictably,
it's the older, more experienced man who keeps his cool, while the
photog loses his, especially after suffering a wound. But in
remaining buttoned-down and mutually suspicious, the characters
also remain opaque. We never get enough of them as people to
support the escalations of the forced, hokey ending.
<p>
   Director Tamahori punches up the narrative whenever he can,
using the plane crash and the bear confrontations to jolt to life
an essentially hollow, uneven  &MD;  and necessarily delayed  &MD; 
square-off between the smart, determined, moral character and the
greedy, weak one. Baldwin's part here is nowhere nearly as juicy as
the one Mamet gave him in ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' It's pretty
quickly apparent which of the two has the edge. This leaves a
dramatic hole that Tamahori's directorial muscle-flexing can never
quite fill without dancing on the edge of self-parody. What's raw
and elemental in ``The Edge'' is the magnificently rugged Canadian
Rockies standing in for Alaska's Yukon. It's never the passions.

<p>
   Princeton, New Jersey, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- A look back at
some of the notable quotes from the week in business.
<p>
   ``Mac OS8 appears to be selling well, but big deal. It's like
saying, `I lost an arm, but boy I feel good this morning and the
sun's out.'''
<p>
   --Duane Eatherly, senior technology analyst at Banc One
Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, speaking of Apple Computer
Inc., which has been hurt by slipping market share and falling
revenue. Though the situation is grim, analysts said the
computer-maker's Rhapsody operating system is on track and its
latest operating system, Mac OS8, is selling well.
<p>
   ``Over the next 18 months, we'll begin to see whether the
emperor has any clothes.''
<p>
   --Porter Bibb, an investment banker at Ladenburg, Thalmann &AMP;
Co., on DreamWorks SKG. The studio is betting that films with big
stars can dispel doubts the company will thrive. Its first film,
``The Peacemaker,'' starring George Clooney, opens tonight.
<p>
   ``We continue to do miracles.''
<p>
   --Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York,
as the U.S. budget deficit narrowed in August and the federal
government's annual shortfall headed for its lowest reading in 23
years, aided by the ebullient economy and strong tax revenues. The
government posted a smaller-than-expected deficit of $34.603
billion for the month, down $41.831 billion in August 1996,
Treasury figures showed.
<p>
   ``We're not getting into the junkier side of high-yield. We want
to take advantage of the premium out there, but we're not going to
troll the bottom.''
<p>
   --Gail Stone, associate director in charge of investments at
Arkansas Public Employees' Retirement System in Little Rock, as
more pension funds add high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds to their
portfolios in their quest for higher returns.
<p>
   ``When I called to congratulate him this morning, he gave the
signal that he is very happy -- he giggled. He said, `I feel
great.'''
<p>
   --Jessica Bibliowicz, president of money management firm John A.
Levin &AMP; Co., on her father, Travelers Group Inc. Chairman Sanford
Weill, on the day Travelers agreed to buy Salomon Inc. for more
than $9 billion in stock.
<p>
   ``People are afraid it will make their strawberries glow.''
<p>
   --Tim Cunniff, director of marketing at Del Monte Fresh Produce,
talking about how the public has resisted irradiation, a technology
that uses gamma rays to kill microorganisms and halt spoilage in
fresh produce. Public health officials, the food industry and some
consumer groups are slowly coming to accept its benefit, following
a rash of infections from imported fruits and vegetables.
<p>
   ``The IRS is an easy target for criticism, and a convenient
whipping boy. It is easy enough to point out the flaws in an agency
like the IRS, but it is a much more difficult task to correct
them.''
<p>
   --Nevada Democratic Senator Richard Bryan, as the Senate Finance
Committee opened three days of public hearings on the agency. The
hearings are another step in the congressional effort to repair the
Internal Revenue Service. Lawmakers and public and private
investigators have chastised the agency for a litany of sins,
ranging from abusing taxpayers to wasting as much as $4 billion on
a failed computer system.
<p>
   ``Refining earnings are going to be up like gangbusters.''
<p>
   --Adam Sieminski, an analyst with NatWest Securities Corp., as
most major U.S. oil companies are expected to have higher
third-quarter earnings as profits from refining crude oil into
gasoline offset lackluster gains from discovering and selling oil
and natural gas.

   Itasca, Illinois, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Boise Cascade Office
Products Corp. said United Parcel Service of America's recent
strike will reduce its third-quarter earnings by about 2 cents to 3
cents a share.
<p>
   The distributor of office, furniture and paper products, a unit
of Boise Cascade Corp., was expected to earn 21 cents in the
quarter, the average estimate of six analysts polled by IBES
International Inc. In August, members of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters union were on strike for 15 days, clogging
mail deliveries nationwide.
<p>
   In the year-ago third quarter, the company earned $11.7 million,
or 19 cents a share, on sales of $506.7 million.
<p>
   The Itasca, Illinois-based company also issued 2.25 million
shares of unregistered common stock to its Boise, Idaho-based
parent, which makes paper products.
<p>
   The shares were priced at $21.55 each, for a total of about
$48.5 million. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt and for general
corporate purposes, the company said.
<p>
   Boise Cascade Office Products shares fell 3/16 to 18 13/16 in
midday trading.

 &UR; DYLAN EXPLORES HIS DARK SIDE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE MORSE &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Bob Dylan's new album, ``Time Out of Mind,'' has a Boston
reference. ``I'm in Boston in some restaurant,'' he talk-sings in a
raspy tone. ``I got no idea what I want. Maybe I do, but I'm just
not sure.'' It's a strange moment  &MD;  and it's symptomatic of an
album that shows flashes of brilliance, but suggests that Dylan
really isn't sure of his place these days  &MD;  except as an outsider
wading through the latter part of the 20th century in a daze.
<p>
   ``Time Out of Mind,'' due out Tuesday, is Dylan's first album of
original material in seven years. Critics are already lining up
with their hosannas, but there's something baffling about it. His
musical arrangements are beguiling mood pieces drawn with the aid
of New Orleans producer Daniel Lanois, and dressed up with elegiac
organ lines from Augie Meyers (of Sir Douglas Quintet fame) and
some piquant guitar fills from New Englander Duke Robillard, who
once anchored Roomful of Blues.
<p>
   But the lyrics are downbeat to the point of depressing until the
clouds partially lift near the end. It's as if Dylan is sending
missives from a desert island, searching for a lifeline. ``I feel
further away than ever before,'' he sings in ``Highlands,'' a
marathon, 16-minute track. ``You could say I'm on anything but a
roll.''
<p>
   These lines are worrisome, given Dylan's physical state last
spring when he had a heart infection that was at first diagnosed as
life-threatening. Dylan scared us then  &MD;  and he's scaring us now
with this new album, in which he's often bereft of love and
connection.
<p>
   Dylan's walking-wounded pose begins with the first song, ``Love
Sick,'' which starts with the line, ``I'm walking through streets
that are dead.'' The vocal is haunting, the mood is grim, and the
stage is set for more of the same. He's still walking in the next
tune, ``Dirt Road Blues,'' with the line, ``I'll walk down that
dirt road until someone lets me ride.'' It has the liveliest
arrangement on the record  &MD;  a rockabilly-lightened rhythm with a
Jimmie Rodgers vocal inflection  &MD;  but Dylan is still walking at the
end, mired in obsessive lost love: ``I'll keep walking until I hear
her call out my name.''
<p>
   He's even more bereft in ``Standing in the Doorway.'' It has a
``Basement Tapes'' feel, as does much of this rather wonderfully
played album, but again, the lyrics are a downer. How about this
revelation: ``Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill
you.''
<p>
   The inscrutable Dylan expresses more alienation in ``Million
Miles,'' accompanied by pump organ from Jim Dickinson, who has
played with Ry Cooder and Aretha Franklin. ``I tried to get closer,
but I'm still a million miles away from you,'' Dylan sings,
extending his theme to the virtual breaking point.
<p>
   The spiritually desperate ``Tryin' to Get to Heaven'' is up
next, sounding like a sequel to ``Knockin' on Heaven's Door.'' This
time, Dylan is not just knocking. He's trying to get in before it's
too late. Yes, he's walking in the wilderness again: ``I've been
walking through the middle of nowhere, trying to get to heaven
before they close the door ... When you've lost everything, you
find you can lose a little more.''
<p>
   The bleakness continues in the reticent ```Til I Fell in Love
with You.'' A bluesy, midtempo song with fuzzed-guitar licks from
Lanois, it finds Dylan drawling, ``Well, my nerves are exploding
and my body's tense ... I was all right until I fell in love with
you.''
<p>
   His rather relentless melodrama is a test of will for fans who
are trying to keep up, but aren't quite sure where the poet
laureate of our times is headed. The stately ``Not Dark Yet'' is a
step deeper into an outsider role: ``Feels like my soul has turned
into steel; it's not dark yet, but it's getting there.''
<p>
   OK, maybe he doesn't want a lifeline. His is a self-imposed
exile raised to an art form, but one that threatens to sink from
its own weight. On a purely musical level, the listener is engulfed
by the atmospheric swirl (a Time magazine reviewer was right in
saying this is some of Dylan's best music since the '70s), but it's
often painful to dwell on the lyrics.
<p>
   In the song ``Cold Irons Bound'' is this nugget: ``I'm beginning
to hear voices and there's no end.'' Is there also no relief? Well,
he finally lets up in ``Make You Feel My Love,'' a piano ballad
with a more optimistic slant: ``I could offer you a warm embrace to
make you feel my love.''
<p>
   Dylan is back in a funk on the shuffling ``Can't Wait,'' about
unrequited love. The disc ends with the 16-minute opus,
``Highlands,'' in which slide guitar and Farfisa organ help spin a
web, but Dylan confuses us again with the verse, ``My heart's in
the highlands with the horses and the hounds.'' Say what?

<p>
   What Jenny McCarthy brings to the comedy table is a pair of sly
rolling eyes, big facial expressions, very fun hair, and an ability
to throw her entire body into phrases like ``Uh, hello??'' And
also, an indomitable will to be comic, despite her limited
resources. Which is not nothing, as her raunchy MTV skit-com, ``The
Jenny McCarthy Show,'' proved by becoming one of TV's guiltiest of
pleasures last spring. You had to admire McCarthy's white-hot drive
as she played a heavily accented waitress with footlong underarm
hair, or the businesswoman who eats her own vomit. Anyway, I did
...
<p>
   Now, NBC has domesticated McCarthy for a new series called
``Jenny,'' which premieres Sunday. It's an amusing but slight
half-hour that's got some promise in its two lead actresses,
McCarthy and Heather Paige Kent, but not enough wit in the script
department. The setup has potential, but only if the writers can up
the one-liner quotient and heighten the situational irony.
McCarthy's Jenny and Kent's Maggie are checkout girls in Utica,
N.Y., until Jenny's absentee father dies and leaves her a beautiful
home in the Hollywood Hills. Right away, the pair of not-so-swift
best friends move to the land of Lala, where they mix it up with a
self-serving lawyer and a pair of hot-to-trot amateur filmmakers.
Here's the pitch: ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' meets ``The Beverly
Hillbillies.''
<p>
   McCarthy and Kent have a good time throwing small-town
working-class pride in the face of Hollywood slickness, but their
characters remain too similar  &MD;  except for their hair color.
They've got a sparky chemistry that needs to be more Lucy-Ethel
than Lucy-Lucy. George Hamilton is well cast as Jenny's late
father, a slippery B-movie star who, in Sunday night's episode,
appears only in a videotaped will. Reportedly, Hamilton will
continue to appear on the series in future videotaped messages to
his daughter. The other supporting characters are weak, however,
and ``Jenny'' will need to throw its double heroines up against a
more piquant and timely set of LA denizens before it's all said and
done.

<p>
   BOSTON -- S-21 was a secret prison in the Cambodian capital of
Phnom Penh, run by the Pol Pot regime in the late 1970s, a place
where people accused of treason and their families were tortured
into confessing any crimes their captors cared to charge them with,
then executed.
<p>
   But first they had their pictures taken. In a macabre stab at
the kind of clinical documentation the Nazis made famous, new
arrivals were photographed, and these portraits of pain became part
of their official dossiers, along with their confessions. Of the
14,200 people imprisoned in S-21, only seven are known to have
survived.
<p>
   The negatives of their pictures did survive, though  &MD;  some 6,000
of them. After the Vietnamese drove out the Khmer Rouge in 1979,
S-21 was turned into The Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide and the
negatives and a vast quantity of written documentation entered the
museum archives.
<p>
   It was more than a decade later when two young American
photojournalists, Chris Riley and Doug Niven, visited the museum
and saw some of the portraits on the wall. Intrigued, they asked if
the negatives still existed. They did  &MD;  in a rusty file cabinet,
where they'd been damaged by mold, insects and humidity.
<p>
   Realizing the unique power of these images to bring home the
horror to a wide audience, Riley and Niven made it their mission to
clean and print the negatives and put 100 of the resulting
photographs before the public in a show called ``Facing Death.''
Boston University's Photographic Resource Center is currently
hosting the premiere of the full show  &MD;  a selection appeared
previously at New York's Museum of Modern Art  &MD;  and the PRC will
tour the exhibition nationally for the next few years.
<p>
   The show is a valuable public service. Is it also art? It
certainly wasn't intended to be. But if communication through
images is one definition of art, then art this is. Most of the
photographs were taken by a terrified teenager, Nhem Ein, whom the
Khmer Rouge had sent to China to learn photography. Forbidden to
speak to his subjects, who were propped up in front of him one by
one, he took hundreds of photos each day; in his zeal and obedience
lay his salvation. His isn't a simple story: He remained with the
Khmer Rouge, which still lives as a guerrilla movement, until seven
months ago.
<p>
   Nhem Ein's original photographs were, by all accounts, pristine.
The negatives, though, were a mess when Riley and Niven stumbled on
them, and that very condition led to ``artistic'' results in the
prints, to dark blotches and lines, accidents that sometimes take
on eery meanings. Black spots look like bullet holes or spattered
blood or suggest that part of a face has been blown away. Riley and
Niven have capitalized on the negatives' poor condition, making it
a metaphor for the prisoners' plight.
<p>
   The names of most of those prisoners have been lost. A number is
pinned on each. The numbering began anew every 12 hours, starting
over with ``one,'' which only adds to the cruel anonymity.
Prisoners were hauled before the camera blindfolded; the blindfold
was whipped off and the photo snapped. These are faces confronting
the unknown, which distinguishes them from the faces in the photos
of prisoners liberated from concentration camps at the end of World
War II, faces that have known too much. Many of the Cambodian
prisoners look numb; others seem astonished or puzzled; one
actually smiles in what must be a conditioned response to facing
the lens. Many prisoners were children, or mothers who posed with
babes in arms: You wonder what their ``crimes'' were.
<p>
   Inscribed above the photos on the walls of the PRC are quotes
from interrogators' manuals. ``Break them with the pressure of
propaganda, or break them with torture,'' one instructs. ``Don't
allow them to die; don't allow them to deteriorate to the point
where it's no longer possible to question them.'' Reading this is
almost as painful as digesting the portraits.

government reports of economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. and
Eastman Kodak Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 75.40, or
1 percent, to 7923.41. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 7.52,
or 0.8 percent, to 945.43, led by banks.
<p>
   Banks in particular benefit from lower interest rates, as they
boost demand for loans; steady growing companies like drugmakers
are attractive as bond yields become less competitive.
<p>
   Even after today's rise, the Dow average was little changed for
the week. Any further gains depend on a bond market rally,
investors said.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million
money-management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis
points to 6.36 percent, about where it was on Monday. Its 52-week
low of 6.30 percent was reached on July 31.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.86, or 0.2 percent, to
1682.75. Concern about slow sales at Lattice Semiconductor Corp.
and Xilinx Inc. and other specialty chip makers dragged the index
lower.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 3/4 to 113 7/8.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after the government said the economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported and
didn't speed up inflation.
<p>
   Perhaps more than profits and interest rates, the strength of
the U.S. currency provides the best hint as to the path of stocks
in coming weeks and months, said Kenneth L. Fisher, president of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, California, with $1.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   U.S. stocks attracted foreign investors in the past year as the
dollar rose 16 percent against the German mark, the benchmark
currency for Europe. The Dow industrials climbed 35 percent in that
period, and the dollar and the Dow rose in tandem 60 percent of the
time.
<p>
   A pickup in Europe's economy could weaken the dollar and signal
the end of the past few years of unprecedented gains in U.S.
stocks; the Dow doubled in a 31-month period.
<p>
   The dollar and the Dow both peaked Aug. 6. Since then, the
dollar has dropped 6.5 percent against the mark and the Dow is down
4.3 percent.
<p>
   Fisher said he is sticking with his ownership of the biggest,
most international U.S. companies such as DuPont Co. and Merck &AMP;
Co. If he sees signs of growth oversees, he would expand his
holdings of non-U.S. superstars like Siemens AG and Sony Corp. It
would be his biggest portfolio change in three years, he said.
<p>
   ``The explanation in the weeks ahead will come out of keeping an
eye on the dollar,'' Fisher said.
<p>
   Even with the August slump, the Dow has gained 3.1 percent for
the quarter ending Tuesday, after rising 16 percent in the second
quarter.
<p>
   The S&AMP;P 500 is up 6.7 percent since June, the Nasdaq has soared
16 percent and the Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks rose 13
percent.
<p>
   Lattice Semiconductor tumbled 3 3/4 to 65 5/8, leading the
decline in chipmakers as weak orders were seen hurting
third-quarter results. Xilinx dropped 1 7/16 to 49 7/8 and Altera
Corp. lost 1 1/2 to 53 1/2.
<p>
   Investors said that while they expect most companies to deliver
strong earnings, they may not have enough punch to drive stocks
higher.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting that the current
quarter's earnings may be weaker than expected.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 9 7/16 to 24 1/16.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, said
it could report a loss of 12 cents to 18 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the
year-ago period. Bridgeport fell 1 1/4 to 10 1/4.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 1 1/6 to 57 1/2 after it said
third-quarter earnings will be about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected. It
declined 3/4 to 19 7/16.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, fell 3 3/8 to 10 after warning
that it expects earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less
than the year-ago 51 cents a share because of production and
shipment delays.
<p>
   Darden Restaurants Inc., which operates the Olive Garden, Red
Lobster and Bahama Breeze chains, reported profit of a penny better
than the average estimate of 15 cents. Darden rose 7/16 to 10 3/4.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 3
3/4 to 26 1/4 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its investment
rating to ``neutral.'' Cymer has fallen 43 percent in September on
concern growth is slowing.
<p>
   Kodak rose 1 3/4 to 64 3/16 after announcing it will fire about
10 percent of its clerical staff and 20 percent of its managers in
a move to boost profits.
<p>
   3M gained 2 1/2 to 90 5/16 after Cowen &AMP; Co. raised its
investment opinion from ``neutral'' to ``strong buy.''

 &UR; BIG WRECK'S GUITAR SOUND IS NO ACCIDENT &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   The Boston rock scene is filled with cliques of musicians who go
their own way much of the time but have at least heard of each
other. Yet how many folks have heard of Big Wreck? The Boston act
is not familiar to most listeners, though that may soon change. The
band has a major-label album coming shortly that is so good it
could demand across-the-board attention.
<p>
   The new disc, ``In Loving Memory Of ... ,'' is out Oct. 7 on
Atlantic Records. It's a melodic hard-rock gem that evokes the
layered guitar mastery of Soundgarden and Collective Soul, along
with power chords that ``frequently crank up to Who and Nirvana
levels,'' as Guitar World magazine notes.
<p>
   The first single, ``The Oaf,'' sounds like a lean-and-mean cross
between Aerosmith hooks and Led Zeppelin drum crunch yet is still
tight enough to qualify for pop radio. It's one of many
out-of-nowhere tracks from Big Wreck, which performs at Bill's Bar
tonight with Ruby Horse (another Boston band making waves with
record-label offers about to come its way).
<p>
   So, what's the Big Wreck story? As the band's new bio says,
``Big Wreck came crashing together in 1992 at Boston's noted haven
of harmonic intent  &MD;  Berklee College of Music.'' The four members  &MD; 
singer-lead guitarist Ian Thornley, guitarist Brian Doherty,
bassist Dave Henning, and drummer Forrest Williams  &MD;  began as
like-minded musicians and friends, says Thornley, adding they
focused ``on the groove rather than technical chops.''
<p>
   They became so close at Berklee that they sometimes preferred
their own jamming to going to class. ``It wasn't like skipping
classes was a big deal,'' says Thornley. ``If you got into a jam at
10 at night and it happened to go to 6 or 7 in the morning, that
was more important than going to arranging class.''
<p>
   Somewhere, though, the band learned how to arrange, because the
new CD is a crisply structured effort that is also superbly mixed
by Joseph Puig (the Verve Pipe, L7, Tonic). While the record has
grooves, it also has hooks to spare.
<p>
   ``Mostly, my parents were big folkies when I was a kid, so I
always had a huge thing for melodies,'' says Thornley, 25, who grew
up in Toronto. ``I never got into rock 'n' roll until I was 15 ...
And I got into Led Zeppelin through their folkier stuff. Their
screaming didn't appeal to me until later.''
<p>
   Thornley liked the blues but also admits he liked the harmonies
of Supertramp and the kick of Lynyrd Skynyrd. ``I remember some
people saying that Skynyrd was `a band for gearheads' and `how
could you like them?' But I can't associate a certain music with a
stigma. That's not what music is about.''
<p>
   The guitar-oriented Big Wreck has played a few Boston clubs such
as T.T. the Bear's and Mama Kin, but also moved to Toronto in 1995
to gain experience in clubs there. The band also hooked up with
Management Trust, the same outfit that manages the popular Canadian
band Tragically Hip.
<p>
   The group moved back to Boston this year but has kept a low
profile while waiting for the new disc to come out. ``Most people
aren't that familiar with us,'' says Thornley. ``But we consider
ourselves a Boston band.''
<p>
    &UR; Stones set list: &LR;  Here's the complete song list from the
Rolling Stones opener in Chicago on Tuesday: Satisfaction, It's
Only Rock 'n' Roll, Bitch, Let's Spend the Night Together, Rock in
a Hard Place, Ruby Tuesday, Anybody Seen My Baby?, 19th Nervous
Breakdown, Out of Control, Under My Thumb, Miss You, All About You,
Wanna Hold You, Li'l Queenie, Let It Bleed, The Last Time, Sympathy
for the Devil, You Got Me Rocking, Tumbling Dice, Honky Tonk Women,
Start Me Up, Jumpin' Jack Flash, You Can't Always Get What You
Want, Brown Sugar.
<p>
   All were sung by Mick Jagger except for Keith Richards doing two
little-known tunes of his, ``All About You'' (from the ``Emotional
Rescue'' album), and ``Wanna Hold You,'' from ``Undercover.''
<p>
   The buzz among media in the press box was that the show's best
part was the Stones's mini-set on a B stage in the center of the
floor, where they rocked on ``Li'l Queenie,'' ``Let It Bleed,'' and
``The Last Time.'' It rendered their main stage superfluous and
made you wish the Stones would tone down the big spectacle of that
stage in favor of more B-stage intimacy.
<p>
   Speaking of the media, 550 press reps covered the opening  &MD;  200
domestic, and 350 international.

<p>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  &MD;  When the Boston Symphony Orchestra wanted to
commission a new work to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
Tanglewood Festival Chorus in 1995, the choice fell on Leon
Kirchner, one of America's greatest composers. Paradoxically,
Kirchner, now 78, had not written a work for chorus since 1943,
when he began work on ``Dawn,'' a setting of lines from Federico
Garcia Lorca for chorus and organ. ``Dawn'' was premiered on the
concert that introduced Kirchner to New York in 1949.
<p>
   ``I'd never written for chorus since,'' Kirchner says, ``except
for parts of my opera `Lily.' I don't even know whether I still
have a copy of `Dawn'  &MD;  I can't find it.''
<p>
   Nevertheless, Kirchner has been a serious reader all his life
and has set poetry for solo singers. Now, after long delays, and
Kirchner's major illness, his work for the Tanglewood Festival
Chorus, ``Of things exactly as they are,'' reaches performance at
this weekend's Boston Symphony concerts. Seiji Ozawa conducts, and
soprano Roberta Alexander and baritone William Sharp are the
soloists.
<p>
   Kirchner began the project by compiling a libretto. ``I was
looking for texts that could express things I had felt far better
than I ever could in words,'' the composer says. ``It was quite a
long process, and my publisher would not let me set down a single
note of music until I had secured all the necessary permissions
from poets or their estates. At one point, I wanted to include a
passage from T.S. Eliot, but his estate must have thought I was
Andrew Lloyd Webber. They wanted the kind of royalties they could
expect from `Cats'!''
<p>
   Kirchner finally assembled a sizable sheaf of poems that he
showed to his friend, critic Helen Vendler, who remarked that a
musical setting of all those lines would take a full week to
perform. As he read the poems over and over, he felt some of them
beginning to interact, to coalesce, to create the kind of friction
and drama he was looking for. Finally he settled on passages from
Robinson Jeffers, Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Wallace
Stevens, and Robert Lowell  &MD;  all of them American poets, although
that was not part of his original design. ``I was sorry to give up
Eliot, Hart Crane and Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Gerard
Manley Hopkins, Thomas Hardy, e.e. cummings, Dylan Thomas, Theodore
Roethke, and A. R. Ammons,'' Kirchner says with a wry grin.
<p>
   Kirchner had completed the short score and the choral parts in
time for last season's scheduled premiere when he was felled by an
aortal aneurysm. ``For the first couple of months I was out of the
hospital, I was so exhausted that I couldn't work on the
orchestration for more than a couple of minutes at a time, but now
it's all done except for the corrections I'd like to make!''
Kirchner has dedicated the work to his wife, ``my dearest Gert.''
<p>
   As he began work, Kirchner felt ``Of things exactly as they
are'' developing into a kind of operatic ``duo-drama''  &MD;  characters
and conflicts began to emerge from the music and text, and Kirchner
found himself thinking of ``Erwartung,'' the great operatic
monodrama for soprano and orchestra by his teacher Arnold
Schoenberg. The baritone and soprano solos suggested a passionate
relationship; the chorus took on the role of context and
commentary, like the chorus in Greek tragedy.
<p>
   The work opens with lines from a Jeffers poem about the timeless
immensity of the ocean that sees and dissolves all human experience
and conflict. ``I remember what it was like as a child to swim
through the breakers to the place beyond the waves, and so I tried
to put that into the music, my own version of Debussy's `La Mer.' I
was also thinking of the beginning of Hardy's novel `The Return of
the Native'  &MD;  I wanted to compose something vast and brooding like
that, or like the way Bruckner opens a symphony.''
<p>
   The passionate Emily Dickinson poems that follow also invoke the
sea and bring on the soprano and baritone soloists, who become
figures at once actual and symbolic. ``The sexual implications did
not escape me,'' Kirchner says, ``the really wild physical
involvement suggested in the poems.'' The lines from Edna St.
Vincent Millay ``humanize the immensity of the Jeffers, and become
personal and touching. Then something strange happens with the
arrival of lines from the Wallace Stevens poem `The Man With the
Blue Guitar.' There is something going on here that the lovers want
to be a part of, yet also fear. Here I did not want to use a real
guitar, although I explored the possibilities; finally I decided to
use piano, harp, glockenspiel, and celeste to evoke the guitar.''
<p>
   Then comes an ``immense'' poem by Robert Lowell about day and
night in Central Park that Kirchner loves so much that he carried a
copy around in his pocket for years. But this dark vision of lovers
``occupying every inch of earth and sky'' is not the end. Instead,
Kirchner has composed an epilogue, in which each poem in the cycle
comes back with a line or two and its associated musical ideas, and
this brings about a kind of resolution. This too had a literary
model in the futuristic fiction of Doris Lessing.
<p>
   Last week Kirchner was full of worries and hopes about tonight's
premiere. ``Sometimes I think of how Ulysses lashed himself to the
mast so that he would not respond to the sirens' call. That's how I
feel about hearing my own music.'' Nevertheless he was looking
forward to meetings with Seiji Ozawa and the soloists, and quite
pleased with chorus master John Oliver's work with the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus. ``The chorus already makes the music sound like my
piece; John has been absolutely wonderful throughout this entire
process.''
<p>
   As usual, Kirchner's conversation cast a wide net to catch
personal reminiscence, philosophical reflection, uncompromising but
not unfair views of the recent works of some of his younger
contemporaries, and splenetic outrage at the state of the music
business. ``In our culture, a composer merely exercises his
craft,'' he says angrily. ``It's the performer who's the genius.''
At the same time, Kircher admits he feels stirrings toward further
new work to do. ``For years,'' he admits, ``I have thought about
that first chord in the Stravinsky Violin Concerto, and how he sent
it to the violinist Samuel Dushkin to ask if it were playable. I
would construct an opening chord for a violin concerto in my head
and then I would wonder just who I could send it to. Now Young Uk
Kim wants me to write him a violin concerto; I told him I would,
and I've been thinking about it ever since.'' Kirchner has written
three of the finest string quartets ever composed by an American  &MD; 
the second won the Pulitzer Prize in 1967  &MD;  and he has promised a
fourth to the Aldeburgh Festival in England.
<p>
   And his thoughts invariably return to ``Of things exactly as
they are.'' ``Some days I'm very satisfied with it, and some days
I'm not and wonder if there's a piece there at all. But then people
tell me I've always been like that....''

<p>
   London, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.K.'s FT-SE 100 stock index
posted its biggest one-day gain in history, bond yields touched
four-year lows and the pound tumbled amid expectations Britain may
join a European single currency sooner than expected.
<p>
   The market reaction came after the government stopped short of
denying a Financial Times report in which an unidentified cabinet
minister said the U.K. was set to announce it may join monetary
union soon after its planned 1999 start. The government called the
report speculative.
<p>
   Joining economic and monetary union, or EMU, would mean lower
U.K. interest rates -- the base rate could drop from 7.0 percent
toward the German Bundesbank's 3.0 percent key rate, which serves
as Europe's benchmark -- because countries joining the single
currency will adopt a shared official interest rate.
<p>
   ``This is quite a significant story and a believable one,'' said
Job Curtis, a fund manager at Henderson Investors, which controls
about $16 billion in U.K. equities. ``We're probably not going to
be entering the first round but at least there's a more positive
view.''
<p>
   U.K. stocks soared to records, led by banks, as the FT-SE 100
index added 160.8 points, its biggest one-day gain ever, to close
at 5226.3, also a record. The previous record closing high was
5086.8 on Aug. 7. The index has hit record highs 42 times this
year.
<p>
   The index's 3.17 percent increase today is the largest
percentage rise since a 4.44 percent gain on Sept. 17, 1992 --the
day Britain was forced by speculators to quit the European Union's
exchange-rate mechanism, devalue the pound and turn its back on a
common European currency.
<p>
   The reason for both increases is the same: a falling pound.
Cheaper sterling helps exporters by making their products more
competitive abroad. In 1992, the pound fell because once Britain
left the ERM it no longer was tied to a strong deutsche mark at an
artificially high exchange rate. Today, it fell for opposite
reasons -- economic convergence will push the strong pound down
against the mark and the currencies of other trade partners.
<p>
   The yield on the U.K.'s benchmark 10-year gilt fell 19 basis
points to 6.41 percent, the first time it's traded below 6.5
percent since Feb. 4, 1994.
<p>
   Before it was elected in May, the Labour government pledged not
to join EMU unless a national referendum approved going in. With
investors increasingly convinced the single currency -- the euro --
will go ahead on time, pressure is growing for Britain to decide. A
MORI poll in April indicated, however, that 54 percent of U.K.
adults were against Britain adopting a single currency.
<p>
   The U.K takes over the presidency of the European Union at the
beginning of 1998. The Labour Party is perceived to be more in
favor of the U.K. strengthening economic ties with its European
neighbors than the previous Conservative Party administration,
increasing the likelihood of Britain eventually adopting the euro.
<p>
   That does not necessarily mean the U.K. is ready to join
economically. It can meet the formal criteria for joining, which
include cutting deficits to 3 percent or less of gross domestic
product, reducing national debt to 60 percent or less of GDP and
lowering the inflation rate to the average over time of the three
lowest rates among the EMU members. Government debt, for example,
is 54.8 percent of GDP. Most economists expect it to meet the
deficit criteria as well.
<p>
   Some investors contend Britain may be doing too well for smooth
EMU integration. The U.K. economy has been growing apace for more
than a year, they noted, while its European neighbors are only
beginning to emerge from the brink of recession.
<p>
   Unemployment illustrates the point. Britain's unemployment rate,
at 5.3 percent, is at its lowest level in 17 years, while the rates
in both Germany and France are at a post-World War II high.
<p>
   ``Our economic cycle is at a different stage,'' said Andrew
Milligan, economic adviser to General Accident, part of GA Asset
Management with $45 billion under management. This could lead to
conflicts when a unified Europe set common interest rates.
<p>
   With base lending rates at 7.0 percent in the U.K. and 3.0
percent in Germany, borrowing costs in the U.K. would most likely
fall. The yield spread between 10-year U.K. and German bonds, which
reached at an annualized 119 basis points yesterday, would also be
expected to shrink.
<p>
   Expectations the U.K. may be poised to fix the pound's value
against other European currencies sent sterling tumbling to 2.8280
deutsche marks from 2.8698 yesterday, and to $1.6121 from $1.6299.
<p>
   In May, the European Commission will fix the exchange rates for
countries joining EMU. Economists expect Britain would want to fix
the pound's rate below its current trading level, to avoid
crippling British exporters.
<p>
   ``We would reckon that the pound would join EMU around 2.60
marks,'' said Eric Fishwick, international economist at Nikko
Europe.
<p>
   Should Britain wish to adopt the euro after 1999 it would have
to apply to EU finance ministers. The ministers would judge whether
the U.K. met the Maastricht criteria, based on a report from the
commission, the EU executive agency. A final decision would be
taken at a vote among EU leaders.
<p>
   On a practical level it's unlikely the U.K. would be able to
adopt the euro before 2001, a year before notes and coins will be
introduced at a consumer level.

<p>
   It was probably smart of DreamWorks, the new
Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen studio, to avoid a big make-or-break
debut film and start with an ordinary one instead. ``The
Peacemaker'' is maybe a notch better than the average predictable
action thriller. It's faster-paced than most and isn't afraid to
spend money hopping all over Eastern Europe before climaxing in
Manhattan. It also has a couple of watchable if not irresistibly
charismatic leads in Nicole Kidman and George Clooney. Playing the
best the United States has to offer in the way of brains and
muscle, respectively, they're all that's standing between us and
the threat of a big smoking radioactive crater where the UN used to
be.
<p>
   They spend most of the film chasing down a stolen Russian
nuclear warhead after its spectacular hijacking from a train that
was then nuked with another warhead to cover the theft. Kidman
plays the government expert on nuclear smuggling, Clooney the
dirty-tricks-if-necessary guy. Here, they're very necessary if a
Croatian nationalist, embittered by sniper killings of his wife and
child, isn't going to succeed in retaliating against the countries
he believes should have prevented their deaths. As played by Marcel
Iures, the terrorist wears a more suffering expression than usual
for the type.
<p>
   But ``The Peacemaker'' is very much of a type, despite all the
painstaking effort that has gone into filming in six European
countries, starting with Clooney doing some heavy hitting in a
Vienna car chase. It turns into a demolition derby before they rush
after a truckload of nukes being shepherded by a larcenous Russian
general through lethally hostile mountainous territory in the
former Yugoslavia. Only for a moment does Clooney's effective
loose-cannon covert op think he's put out the fire after he leads a
trio of attack helicopters against the runaway truck on a bridge
and goes through a death struggle with the general who means to
sell the warheads.
<p>
   Wisely, the film doesn't try to graft a love story onto the
thrills. On the other hand, the thrills aren't enough. Mimi Leder
makes an impressive move from TV's ``ER'' in a job that calls more
for the services of a field marshal than a director. She's up to
the project's considerable demands. You just wish they had been
enlarged to include more than what must have been some fearsome
logistics. Essentially, Clooney and Kidman play human missiles in a
film ruled by the need to maintain high-speed propulsiveness. This
constant motion has been assigned priority over character faceting,
wit, or even the kind of playfulness that imparted such staying
power to the otherwise-preposterous James Bond capers. When the new
studio hits its stride, it undoubtedly will produce thrillers that
breathe more deeply and conduct themselves more flamboyantly and
confidently. Technically, ``The Peacemaker'' gets the job done on a
lavish scale, but it's too narrow, driven, and monochromatic to be
of more than passing interest. It's high-impact traffic management,
little more.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- While a successful Teamsters
union strike last month was viewed as a comeback for U.S. labor,
the turmoil surrounding President Ron Carey casts doubt on its
future.
<p>
   Just weeks after the victory over United Parcel Service of
America Inc., a federal overseer was entangled in a fund-raising
scandal among Carey aides and resigned, leaving in doubt Carey's
eligibility to run in a new election -- as well as its timetable.
<p>
   The problems raise questions for labor and for U.S. businesses,
primarily the trucking industry, which will face the union in
upcoming talks for a nationwide contract it needs to maintain its
recent rebound while avoiding a walkout.
<p>
   In interviews, Carey said he plans to win another five-year term
and will keep pushing to end union corruption while reversing a
two-decade decline in membership. His opponent, James P. Hoffa,
said he wants to return labor to the heyday of his famous father by
``restoring Teamster power'' and taking a more confrontational
approach with management.
<p>
   ``Carey looked good coming out of the UPS contract,'' in which
the union won almost every concession sought after the two-week
strike, said Michael Belzer, a labor relations professor at the
University of Michigan. Still, he said Carey's future ``depends on
how badly he's tarnished'' by the funding scandal.
<p>
   The stakes are high because Carey is one of the most visible
symbols of labor's resurgence, along with AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney. While they have energized the labor movement by remaking
its image to attract members, Hoffa has focused primarily on
internal Teamsters union issues.
<p>
   The election will be a pivotal event in the history of the
largest U.S. private-industry union because a loss by Carey would
likely end its recent push to root out corruption in local offices,
Belzer said.
<p>
   The new vote was called after the federal election overseer,
Barbara Zack Quindel, threw out in late August the results of the
1996 Teamster election, in which Carey won 52 percent of the votes
cast. She ruled that Carey aides improperly diverted union money to
his campaign treasury.
<p>
   Quindel said Carey could be disqualified from the rerun if any
evidence is discovered showing he was involved in the
misappropriation. Earlier this week, Quindel recused herself from
the issue, saying new allegations in the matter involved a member
of her staff and a political organization to which she belongs.
<p>
   Her replacement must be appointed, which could push back by
months the new election. The successor must decide whether to bar
Carey from running again, which would likely lead to an easy Hoffa
victory.
<p>
   Uncertainty aside, the candidates are preparing to face off in
the new election, and want to use their philosophies on contract
talks affecting 296,000 trucking company employees.
<p>
   In an interview at union headquarters in Washington, Carey said
he will start the talks early with the group that represents the
truckers, Trucking Management Inc., to help reassure shippers of
the union's desire to reach an agreement.
<p>
   Carey said there are ``a lot of areas of concern'' in the
national agreement, especially in the area of part-time workers and
job losses.
<p>
   The union was able to restrict part-time jobs at UPS, which
makes it less likely that the long-haul trucking companies will
demand the right to hire more part-timers.
<p>
   The union is polling its members about their views and
objectives, he said, before it draws up its detailed negotiating
strategy and goals.
<p>
   Hoffa, son of the legendary Teamster leader who built the union
into a potent force before he was removed from office and jailed
for jury tampering, termed the 1994 long-haul contract negotiated
by Carey a terrible agreement for the union.
<p>
   In an interview at his union office in Detroit last week, Hoffa
said this is a good time to ``undo the damage'' of the old
agreement, when Carey ``caved in to management,'' because ``our
major carriers are making record profits.''
<p>
   Hoffa said the accord gave trucking firms too much sway over
driver work assignments and allowed too much diversion of business
to railroads.
<p>
   Demands in a new agreement would include a return of a concept
``my father pioneered, the right to strike over grievances,'' he
said. That right, which he said his father called ``the hammer,''
was negotiated away during the 1994 talks, in favor of a system of
arbitration for such disputes.
<p>
   Hoffa said he was confident he could negotiate ``an excellent
agreement without a strike.'' Still, he added, ``no one is ever
saying there won't be a strike'' until there is an agreement.
<p>
   The contract, called the National Master Freight Agreement,
directly sets wages, benefits and work rules for 136,000 long-haul
truckers around the U.S. The agreement, which expires at the end of
March, is used as a guide in setting compensation for another
160,000 Teamsters members.
<p>
   When negotiations over the current accord broke down in 1994,
Carey led the Teamsters to a 24-day nationwide strike that crippled
the carriers, and led shippers to divert their freight to nonunion
companies.
<p>
   Trucking companies have good reason to be concerned about the
uncertainty surrounding the union leadership, analysts said. The
industry has been ``a horror movie for the past three or four
years,'' said James L. Winchester, a transportation analyst for
Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. ``Things seem to be improving, but from a
pretty low base.''
<p>
   Coupled with price wars that resulted from deregulation of the
industry, many long-haul trucking companies suffered losses in
1994, 1995 and 1996. With a stronger national economy and the end
of the shake-out that followed deregulation, many of the surviving
trucking companies are now profitable.
<p>
   In the three years after the strike, the four largest trucking
companies covered by the accord have lost about $260 million,
according to Traffic World, a trade magazine that covers the
freight industry.
<p>
   TMI officials refused to discuss their bargaining plans or
goals, saying they were waiting for their new executive director,
Timothy P. Lynch, to take office on Oct. 1.
<p>
   TMI negotiates for 24 trucking companies that employ about 75
percent of the Teamsters covered by the long-haul contract,
including the four largest, Yellow Corp., Roadway Express Inc.,
Consolidated Freightways Corp. and ABF Freight System Inc.

   BOSTON -- The state that gave birth to the automobile industry  &MD; 
and arguably the automobile itself  &MD;  is at last beginning to
celebrate its heritage in a manner befitting the importance of the
contribution. But hardly anybody was thinking about Massachusetts's
place in automotive history last week as 6,000 or more people
strolled a showplace lawn in perfect weather to enjoy the elegance
and variety of automobiles.
<p>
   A small event that once taxed the lawn of the Museum of
Transportation has grown in three years to a massive celebration
that is the Castle Hill Concours d'Elegance. The erstwhile concours
of the elite in Brookline, just outside of Boston, has blossomed
into a full-blown public party in Ipswich on Massachusetts' North
Shore..
<p>
   Concours d'Elegance is a judged show of important automobiles
where elegance is the trump card  &MD;  beauty of line, style, visual
appearance.
<p>
   How does an invitational event for the rich get to be a populist
celebration of the automobile? By a happy combination of clear
thinking, good luck, and securing a uniquely elegant venue wherein
6,000 people can stroll and not look like a crowd.
<p>
   And by bringing in the not-quite-concours-but-still-important
vintage collectibles. A mere 83 examples of elegance parked on the
grass will spark interest but maybe not real public desire. Add 300
more very interesting specimens of automotive history, add music,
make sure there is decent food at reasonable prices, ditto adequate
portable toilets, plan for traffic control and parking, and you
have the basics for success. Do it at the Crane estate and you have
the venue for success.
<p>
   Richard T. Crane Jr., rolling in money from manufacturing
plumbing fixtures, commissioned the 59-room Stuart-style mansion
that was completed in 1927. The house and grounds are now under the
care of the Trustees of Reservations and a public park. The
concours has become a fund-raising event for the trustees for the
upkeep of Castle Hill. And it could use some upkeep; the house
standing at the head of the half-mile Grand Allee, a rolling sweep
of lawn ending at seaside, is in good shape and was open last
Sunday for tours. But some of the surrounding terraces, stairways,
and statuary need repair.
<p>
   The Concours d'Elegance is the undertaking of the Vintage Sports
Car Club of America and took place in front of the house with the
Blue Horizon Jazz Band on the porch cranking out Dixie and jazz
appropriate to the day. The proper concours was separated from the
plebian show cars by a terrace, but that was roped off  &MD;  repair is
needed  &MD;  and one trod well-worn paths around it to view the 300 or
so vintage vehicles neatly arrayed in two long lines virtually to
cliffside above the ocean. The avenue between the lines was broad
enough for a bus to make a U-turn  &MD;  there was a crowd but it wasn't
crowded. The crowd was family; kids ran around as kids do, but
there was room for them to run without bothering anybody. And it
was a civilized crowd, friendly, with a distinct absence of litter.
<p>
   On the other side of the house in a courtyard, caterers
mass-produced the obligatory hamburgers and other sustenance. About
the grounds, many had chosen to bring their own picnic provisions.
<p>
   The Castle Hill Concours starts with a private event Saturday, a
traditional hill-climb for the elegant competitors  &MD;  they race.
There is another tradition of sorts, apparently; after the
hill-climb, all adjourn to dinner and listen to the rain. It poured
Saturday night, this year, last year. Once again, Sunday dawned
bright and clear.
<p>
   The event has been compared to Pebble Beach. It attracts many of
the same cars  &MD;  a rare 1933 Pierce Silver Arrow owned by Tom Derro
of Carlisle won the People's Choice Award. Last month, it was voted
Most Elegant at Pebble Beach. Best of Show at Castle Hill was a
magnificent dual-cowled 1939 Buick Saloon Tourer owned by
Christiane Beebe of Madison, Conn.
<p>
   Pebble is as different from Castle Hill as it is the same  &MD; 
Pebble is older and the venue is spectacular, too, the 18th green
of the Pebble Beach Golf Club. It appears more crowded than Castle
Hill with people milling in and around the cars on the grass by the
Pacific Shore. The crowd is moneyed, genteel  &MD;  you can smell the
wealth.
<p>
   Castle Hill has the edge in sheer splendor of site. Pebble Beach
is more expensive  &MD;  $50 a head, but they throw in the program. At
Castle Hill, the admission was $10, $5 for children, $2 for the
program. Pebble has open jitneys  &MD;  you sit along the side of a
bench and get towed from parking areas to show area. Castle Hill
had school buses. It was all very orderly, all a lot of fun. And
where else will you find an ancient Studebaker truck, a big White
woodie, and a Jaguar XKE parked amid the assorted traffic of your
youth, ready for inspection and indulgence in nostalgia.
<p>
   Castle Hill Concours has arrived.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange said it will raise the margins on natural gas futures
contracts at the close of trading Monday.
<p>
   The Nymex gave no reason for the change though it follows a
surge in prices this week to their highest since January.
<p>
   Margins are deposits traders must make with the exchange when
buying or selling futures contracts to ensure obligations will be
met. The Nymex routinely alters margins.
<p>
   The margins on natural gas contracts will be raised to $3,000
from $2,500 for clearing members, to $3,300 from $2,750 for members
and to $4,050 from $3,375 for customers.

<p>
   Montreal, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Air Canada, following the lead
of U.S. carriers, said it will cut commissions paid to travel
agents on tickets purchased for all international flights in a bid
to cut costs.
<p>
   Canada's largest airline said agents will earn an 8 percent base
rate, down from 10 percent, with a maximum payment of C$70
(US$50.40) for return tickets on all flights between Canada and the
U.S. The maximum payout for one-way flights will be C$35.
<p>
   Montreal-based Air Canada said the new base rate on flights to
countries besides the U.S. also will be 8 percent, down from 9
percent. No maximum payment amounts will be set, it said.
<p>
   The current 9 percent commission paid on tickets for flights
within Canada won't change, it said.
<p>
   ``Air Canada must reduce commissions expenses on transborder and
international sales in order to remain cost competitive,'' said
Marc Rosenberg, the carrier's vice president of sales and product
distribution.
<p>
   The rate change will take effect Nov. 1, the airline said.
<p>
   Air Canada shares rose C$0.40 to C$12.80 in midafternoon Toronto
trading.
<p>
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines last week cut agent commissions to 8
percent from 10 percent in a bid to cut costs. This week Delta Air
Lines Inc. and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines matched the cut.
<p>
   Air Canada and Chicago-based United Airlines last week were
granted antitrust immunity by the U.S. government, allowing the
carriers to proceed with their proposed marketing alliance.
<p>
   In the first half of 1997, Air Canada paid C$203 million in
commissions, up from C$191 million in the year-earlier period.

<p>
   Phoenix, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Arizona Corporation
Commission slashed U S West Inc.'s proposed charges for listing
Internet addresses in its phone directories, calling the company's
plan to charge $12 a month to homeowners and businesses
``profiteering.''
<p>
   The commission, which regulates utilities in Arizona, said U S
West could charge residential customers only $1.50 a month and
businesses $3, to include World Wide Web addresses in white-pages
directory listings.
<p>
   ``The U S West proposal was profiteering, pure and simple,''
said Commissioner Renz Jennings, in a statement from the
commission.
<p>
   The Arizona commission allowed U S West's proposed $1.50-a-month
fee for personal E-mail address listings, but it set the business
E-mail listing charge at $3, half what U S West sought.
<p>
   The regional Bell company, based in Engelwood, Colorado, also
will be allowed an initial charge per Internet address of $8.50 for
individuals and $22 for businesses. U S West provides phone service
in 14 western and midwestern states.
<p>
   The rates Arizona approved are comparable to those U S West has
charged for other premium directory listings, such as additional
lines or names or special print, according to Jim Roof, a U S West
spokesman.
<p>
   ``This is an optional service and one that's not likely to be
used by a lot of people, '' Roof said.
<p>
   Most regional Bell operating companies include one free
white-pages listing as part of their monthly telephone service.
Options for additional listings can vary.
<p>
   Chicago-based Ameritech Corp., for example, lets business
customers purchase an extra line of text in the white pages.
<p>
   ``It's around $12 a month and (the charge is) based on the
distribution of the book,'' said Karen Sanborn, an Ameritech
spokeswoman. The company hasn't sought permission to charge
residential customers for an additional line in their listings, she
said.
<p>
   The telephone directory-publishing business generates about $1.1
billion in annual revenue for U S West Media Group, which comprises
U S West's businesses other than local phone service and which has
a separate stock that tracks those businesses. The Media Group
includes the Englewood, Colorado-based phone company's cable-TV and
wireless-telephone businesses.
<p>
   U S West expects a ruling later this year from the Internal
Revenue Service on its proposal to transfer its directory business
to U S West Communications Group, the company's regulated
telephone-service unit.
<p>
   The transfer would result in additional communications group
shares being distributed tax-free to media group investors in
exchange for moving the directory revenue and about $3.8 billion in
debt from one unit to the other.
<p>
   U S West Communications Group shares rose 11/16 to 38 1/8 in
midafternoon trading, while the Media Group shares were unchanged
at 21 7/8.

<p>
   TORONTO  &MD;  So much to do, so little time.
<p>
   That's the concern of anyone who has only a weekend to
experience Canada's largest and most diverse city.
<p>
   According to some guidebooks, Toronto was once a provincial town
where curtains were drawn in department store windows on Sunday
because window shopping was considered sinful.
<p>
   But no more.
<p>
   Now it is a thriving metropolis of 3.5 million people with a
vibrant downtown, first-rate theater, nightlife, museums and the
imprint of 80 different ethnic groups  &MD;  so many that the United
Nations designated Toronto as the world's most ethnically diverse
city.
<p>
   And it seems that everyone has a cell phone.
<p>
   Toronto, which is flat and sprawling, has one thing that many
U.S. cities crave: clean and efficient transit. Subway and
streetcar systems make getting around easy for tourists. It is a
pedestrian-friendly city that is a model of urban planning.
<p>
   And while there are homeless people and ``squeegee'' men
offering to clean automobile windshields at busy intersections, the
city is so safe that women ride the subway alone at 1 a.m.
<p>
   Toronto also has a downtown stadium with a retractable roof (the
Skydome), a burgeoning waterfront district along Lake Ontario, an
entertainment area offering more live theater than any
English-speaking city in the world except New York and London, and
an underground series of shops and restaurants.
<p>
   The city is so diverse that you never know what you'll find.
Within a four-block area on a funky part of Bloor Street, near the
University of Toronto, are restaurants serving Korean, Mexican,
Lebanese, Vietnamese, Italian, Chinese and Thai cuisine.
<p>
   Tucked in between the restaurants is a hip coffee shop named
Cafe Orgasmo and a garishly lighted bargain center called Honest
Ed's that occupies a city block and sells everything from mops to
dentures.
<p>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
<p>
   The eclectic mix of people and places was evident in downtown
Toronto on a recent Saturday night.
<p>
   Outside a gothic Presbyterian Church, a Scottish bagpiper played
while a newlywed couple mingled with well-wishers, many dressed in
kilts. Around the corner, a crowd gathered to catch a glimpse of
actor Brad Pitt at the premiere of his latest movie, ``Seven Years
in Tibet,'' on the last night of the Toronto International Film
Festival.
<p>
   A few blocks away, middle-aged theatergoers jammed the ornate
Princess Alexandra Theatre to see a British musical about Al
Jolson, while the Generation X crowd waited in long lines to enter
clubs with names such as Fusion and Saigon Whiskey a few blocks
away near trendy Queen Street.
<p>
   A few subway stops in one direction, along Dundas Street, a
visitor finds the heart of Chinatown, where the streets teem with
street vendors and shoppers. The pungent smells of outdoor markets
fill the air, while a Lionel Richie ballad incongruously blares
from a stall selling CDs and Chinese videos. Nearby, a sign for the
Chinese Gospel Church tells of services in English, Cantonese and
Mandarin.
<p>
   A few subway stops in the other direction is a bustling
Greektown on Danforth Avenue, where the street signs are in Greek
and English, and diners fill the outdoor tavernas and ouzerias that
are mixed in among shops selling baptismal dresses and CDs of Greek
singers.
<p>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
<p>
   The city is so diverse that tourists visiting for a short time
run the risk of becoming overwhelmed by so many offerings.
<p>
   If money is no object, this is an easy city to go first class.
The Yorkville area includes smart shops such as Louis Vuitton,
Giorgio Armani, Versace and Chanel, all close to the Four Seasons
Hotel, the flagship for the upscale chain based in Toronto.
<p>
   However, our objective was to experience Toronto on a budget,
and we found that was surprisingly easy to do. With so much going
on, it's more a choice of deciding what you like and fitting it
into your budget rather than scrounging around for things to do.
<p>
   Among options:
<p>
    &MD;  See a play.
<p>
   Such musical blockbusters as ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' and the recent revival of ``Showboat'' were developed in
Toronto, which has a thriving scene with more than 40 theaters. The
big hit show of the summer, ``Jolson,'' continues through Oct. 25
at the Royal Alexandra Theatre; the Canadian premiere of the
Tony-award-winning musical ``Rent'' will follow.

<p>
   ``Phantom of the Opera,'' ``The Mousetrap'' and ``The Return of
Martin Guerre'' are other popular productions on stage now.
<p>
   Half-price tickets to many shows are available on the day of the
show at T.O. Tix, a storefront located at 208 Yonge St. in the
heart of downtown near the Eaton Centre.
<p>
   The most popular musicals are usually not included.
<p>
    &MD;  Go to a museum.
<p>
   The Art Gallery of Ontario, known as the AGO, includes the
world's largest collection of sculptures, drawings and prints by
noted British sculptor Henry Moore. They are displayed in a large
room with natural light, allowing a visitor to get a clear view of
the larger-than-life sculptures.
<p>
   Also featured are works by Warhol, Rodin, Mattise and Picasso in
a contemporary museum with light wood floors and stark white walls.
A suggested donation is only $3.70.
<p>
   An exhibition of paintings by Keith Haring recently featured at
the Whitney Museum in New York will be on display at the AGO from
Oct. 17 to Jan. 18.
<p>
   The Royal Ontario Museum, known as the ROM, is an eclectic
museum of art, archaeology and science, featuring everything from
full-size dinosaurs to art by European masters housed in a
wonderful stone building. A newly opened gallery of Byzantine art
features large mosaics and hundreds of ancient artifacts.
<p>
   Admission to the museum is $7.41, but if you go the last hour
before it closes, you get in free.
<p>
    &MD;  Get outdoors.
<p>
   If it's a nice day, take a ferry to the Toronto Islands, a
series of interconnected islands with picnic grounds, children's
rides, beaches and bikeways  &MD;  and no cars. The cost of the ferry
ride to the islands is about $3 and, once there, the view of
downtown Toronto is spectacular.
<p>
   On weekends, the ferry is filled with in-line skaters and bikers
who get around the islands on foot or pedal along a boardwalk.
Bikes  &MD;  some seating four people  &MD;  are for rent on the islands,
along with paddle boats, canoes and rowboats. The cost is about $5
to $15 an hour, with a deposit required.
<p>
   Back in the city, a pleasant lakeside path passes shops,
restaurants, lakeside condominiums and marinas on the waterfront.
On Sundays, the sounds of jazz music waft across the water as
tourists embark on harbor boat trips.
<p>
   Across the street near the Skydome, the Harbourfront Antique
Market is open to those who like to browse for everything from fine
antiques to old Life magazines. Admission is free. The market,
Canada's largest, is a two-story maze of booths in a nondescript
building with concrete floors. It's also a good place to find a
bathroom, which is called a ``washroom'' in Canada.
<p>
    &MD;  Act like a tourist.
<p>
   Most all tourists visiting Toronto head to the CN Tower, the
city's best-known landmark. Billed as ``the highest free-standing
structure in the world,'' the tower's primary function is to send
out radio and TV signals.
<p>
   A glass elevator climbs up the outside of the tower to two
observation desks  &MD;  one indoors and one out. On a clear day, it is
said, you can see Buffalo, N.Y., 60 miles away.
<p>
   More impressive to most visitors is the section of glass floor
that allows a view to the ground 113 stories below. Some people get
nervous when others stomp on the glass with their feet; others lie
down to have their photo made with the Skydome in view below.
<p>
   The cost to go to the top of the tower is about $12, which seems
a little steep for what's up there. Even so, it's highly popular
with tour groups.
<p>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
<p>
   Down below, a number of attractions are aimed at the younger
set. Cosmic Pinball is a three-dimensional ride that those with
queasy stomachs should avoid. Q-Zar is a fun game where
participants run around a darkened room in orange vests and zap
each other with laser guns.
<p>
   Other popular destinations for tourists include the Hockey Hall
of Fame, which traces the history of hockey and houses the Stanley
Cup, and the Bata Shoe Museum, which is devoted solely to the
history of footwear.
<p>
   Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame is about $7; the Bata Shoe
Museum is about $4.50.
<p>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
<p>
    &MD;  Shop.
<p>
   Shopping doesn't seem like such a bargain in Toronto,
particularly at those stores that are also found in the States such
as The Gap and Banana Republic. More unique to visitors is Roots, a
Canadian-based clothing store that still seems Gaplike.
<p>
   For funky, one-of-a-kind shops, head to Queen Street West. There
are many vintage clothing stores, fabric shops and other quirky
shops with names that include Artzy Phartzy, Pepo's Bismol and Way
Cool Tattoos.
<p>
   Within a few blocks, the shops range from one selling items from
Tibet to a shop called Siren that sells vampire regalia.
<p>
   Now who says Toronto is dull?

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve
policymakers, who just got another reading that U.S. growth is
exceeding their oft-stated speed limit, are unlikely to raise
borrowing costs as long as inflation remains out of sight.
<p>
   Commerce Department figures today showed the economy continues
to cruise. The gross domestic product, the total output of goods
and services, accelerated at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate in
the second quarter -- and many analysts expect that to continue for
the balance of the year.
<p>
   Central bankers meet Tuesday to consider interest rate policy.
With producer prices falling for the first eight months of 1997 and
consumer prices rising at the slowest pace in 11 years, however,
they'd be hard-pressed to justify an increase in the overnight bank
lending rate to slow things down. Inflation gauges tied to the GDP
also remain tame.
<p>
   ``They need a little more political cover,'' such as evidence of
rapidly rising wages, before springing into action, said former Fed
Gov. Lyle Gramley, now a consulting economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
<p>
   Vibrant growth alone isn't enough to force a rate increase
without drawing the wrath of the White House and Congress, Gramley
said, let alone businesses and voters.
<p>
   Second quarter growth, though down from the government's
previous estimate of 3.6 percent and below the first quarter's 4.9
percent, exceeds the 2.5 percent growth rate that Fed policymakers
generally have regarded as the speed limit above which inflation
threatens to accelerate. And in another report today, the
University of Michigan said consumer confidence in the economy
remains high.
<p>
   Even so, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has signaled he's in no
hurry to act to stem growth, saying the U.S. economy is close to
achieving the Fed's goal of price stability, driven by productivity
gains that are understated by official statistics.
<p>
   ``The last 15 years have been a period of consolidating the
gains of the early 1980s and extending them to their logical end --
the achievement of price stability,'' Greenspan said in Palo Alto,
California, Sept. 5. ``We are not quite there yet, but we trust it
is on the horizon.''
<p>
   However, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago and a voting member of the Fed's policymaking Open
Market Committee, later sounded a cautionary note.
<p>
   It may be some time before it's clear the economy has reached
the point where strong growth won't spark accelerating inflation,
Moskow said in Indianapolis Sept. 19. ``Are we entering a new era,
or just experiencing a short-term anomaly?'' he wondered. ``The
answer, of course, is we don't know yet. We probably won't know for
years.''
<p>
   Many analysts see little chance the economy will stray from its
current path.
<p>
   Growth in the third quarter, which ends the day of the Fed's
policy meeting next week, probably reached 3 percent, said Joel
Kent, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the fourth
quarter, growth will likely range between 3 percent and 3.5
percent, said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter
Securities in New York.
<p>
   Investors, meantime, are sanguine at the prospects for steady,
low-inflation growth ahead -- and the Fed staying on the sidelines.
A Bloomberg News survey of the 38 primary government bond dealers
showed they expect no Fed action Tuesday.
<p>
   Additionally, stocks and bonds rose today as investors
interpreted the latest GDP report as a sign of more good times. The
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/8, pushing down its yield
5 basis points to 6.36 percent. Stocks gained, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising 76 points, or 0.96 percent, in early
afternoon trading.
<p>
   Other analysts contend, though, the inflation picture could
darken, especially if worker shortages stemming from low
unemployment translate into higher labor costs. After all, labor
costs account for two-thirds of consumer prices.
<p>
   Former Fed Gov. Gramley said he expects labor costs to rise and
central bankers to nudge the overnight bank rate a quarter point
higher to 5.75 percent by the end of the year. Added Anthony Chan,
chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus,
Ohio: ``The question should be when -- not whether -- the Fed will
move.''
<p>
   As the economy's nearly seven-year-old expansion continues,
high-tech industries are leading the way. That was highlighted by
yesterday's report showing a stronger-than-expected gain in August
factory orders for durable goods, paced by a record surge in orders
for electronics.
<p>
   Moreover, business investment in durable goods -- such as
computers -- grew during the second quarter at the fastest pace in
almost 14 years.
<p>
   Underscoring that point, analysts said most U.S. computer makers
will probably report higher third quarter earnings, as lower prices
and faster chips trigger increased demand for personal computers
and business systems. This week for example, Dell Computer Corp.'s
chief financial officer, Thomas Meredith, said sales in the
personal computer industry will rise 18 percent to 20 percent for
the next decade.
<p>
   Housing, a leading indicator of the economy's growth, also
remains strong. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors
reported sales of previously owned homes soared in August to the
highest level on record.
<p>
   The Commerce Department issues three estimates of each quarter's
GDP as more information becomes available to its economists. In its
initial estimate, on July 31, the government said the economy grew
at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That was raised
to a 3.6 percent pace last month. The first quarter's 4.9 percent
growth rate was higher than the 4.3 percent rate recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year.
<p>
   Officials attributed the revised second quarter growth estimate
to lower calculations of goods exports, consumer spending on
services and business investment in durable goods. Still, today's
report also continued to show a rapid buildup in business
inventories, which could act to brake demand for some manufactured
goods in the months ahead.
<p>
   Meanwhile, real final sales, which exclude the effects of
inventory changes, rose 2.5 percent in the second quarter,
previously reported as a 2.8 percent increase. After-tax corporate
profits rose 1.7 percent during the second quarter, previously
reported as an increase of 1.2 percent.
<p>
   On the inflation front, the GDP price deflator, a measure of
price increases followed by Wall Street, grew at a 1.8 percent pace
in the second quarter, the smallest rise since a 1.7 percent
increase in the second quarter of 1996. It was previously reported
as an increase of 1.5 percent. The price deflator measures both the
magnitude of price increases and detects whether higher costs drive
consumers away from a product.
<p>
   The price index for gross domestic purchases, which tracks the
price of all goods purchased in the U.S., including imports, grew
at a 0.8 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged from the
previous reading and the smallest increase since a 0.7 percent rise
in the third quarter of 1961.

 &UR; MUTUAL FUNDS: FRANKLIN RESOURCES SHARES SURGE TOWARD 120? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Tim Quinson &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Investors would have made a
lot of money owning shares of Franklin Resources Inc. over the past
year -- twice what they'd have made in any of its funds.
<p>
   Shares of Franklin, the largest U.S. publicly traded mutual fund
company, have more than doubled, surging 110 percent since last
September, almost tripling the returns of the U.S. benchmark
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. Today alone, shares surged as much as
6 5/8 to 94 7/16.
<p>
   Some Wall Street analysts, including Richard Strauss of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., expect the rally in Franklin shares to continue.
Others, namely Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, think the
company's stock is fully priced.
<p>
   ``The stock could reach 120 in the next year,'' Strauss said.
That would represent an additional advance of more than 25 percent
in the company's stock from its current 94 trading level.
<p>
   Strauss bases his bullish forecast on his estimate that
Franklin's earnings will increase at an annual rate of 20 percent
for the next three to five years.
<p>
   Dally is also optimistic on Franklin's business outlook. He just
thinks the stock won't keep rising at the current pace. ``We're
neutral on the stock,'' he said.
<p>
   Just a few of the biggest U.S. fund groups are publicly traded
since most are closely held, including industry giants Fidelity
Investments and Vanguard Group.
<p>
   Among the fund groups that do offer publicly traded shares are
T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., John Nuveen Co., Pioneer Group Inc.,
Eaton Vance Corp., Liberty Financial Cos. and Phoenix Duff &AMP; Phelps
Corp.
<p>
   None of these companies' stocks have risen as much as Franklin's
in the past year. The closest competitor is Baltimore-based T. Rowe
Price. Its stock was up almost 97 percent in the past 12 months.
The worst performer is Pioneer's stock, up just 16 percent since
last September.
<p>
   Franklin, the manager of the Franklin Templeton mutual fund
group, has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry
with more than $1.7 billion in shareholders' equity, Smith Barney
Inc. analyst Dean Eberling wrote in a report distributed today.
<p>
   The company's strong balance sheet is ``a source of strategic
and competitive strength that should act in concert with earnings
growth to help the company achieve and maintain a premium
valuation,'' Eberling wrote.
<p>
   ``We're raising our price target on the stock to $100,'' wrote
Eberling, who expects Franklin shares to ``outperform'' the market.
It's possible Franklin will report higher-than-expected earnings in
its fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 30, boosted by the strong
financial markets and high cash inflows to the company's mutual
funds, he said.
<p>
   Eberling is estimating Franklin will report earnings of 93 cents
a share for the fourth quarter, and $3.37 a share for the fiscal
year, according to his report.
<p>
   The strength of Franklin's international stock fund business and
the acquisition of veteran stock-picker Michael Price's mutual fund
group are combining to attract a lot of new assets to the firm,
Goldman's Strauss said. Inflows to Franklin's fixed-income funds
also are improving as worldwide bond market returns improve, he
said.
<p>
   Franklin will report a 33 percent increase in net income for the
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, said Strauss, who estimates the
company will report earnings of $3.35 a share for the 12-month
period. The San Mateo, California-based company will earn $4.05 in
fiscal 1998, he said.
<p>
   ``The company's earnings outlook looks very positive,'' Strauss
said.

 &UR; U.S. COMMODITIES: WHEAT DROPS AS PAKISTAN BUYS FROM AUSTRALIA &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Wheat sank after Pakistan
bought twice as much wheat from Australia as from the U.S. in a
recent tender, signaling rising competition on the world market.
Elsewhere, cocoa fell and hogs were steady ahead of the
government's quarterly survey of the nation's herd. The Commodity
Research Bureau index was recently little changed at 242.78, up
0.21, while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was
up 1.31, or 0.65 percent, at 204.37. Pakistan purchased 400,000
metric tons of Australian wheat and only 200,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat in a tender yesterday, according to a U.S.-based
official of the Australian Wheat Board. Speculation also swept the
market that Egypt and Tunisia are buying wheat from France, traders
said.
<p>
   Competition is increasing on the world wheat market as the
European Union, collectively the world's largest exporter,
completed its harvest and as supplies from Australia are more
plentiful than expected after rain revived dry crops.
<p>
   ``The main reason for the weakness in the market is the Pakistan
tender,'' said Paul Koltek, a wheat trader at United Grain Corp., a
Portland, Oregon-based wheat exporting firm. ``The trade in general
anticipated there would be a lot more done from the U.S.''
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell as much as 8.25 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $3.575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
contract's lowest since July 22.
<p>
   With new supplies, the European Union yesterday raised its
subsidies on wheat exports to 4.89 European currency units ($5.43)
a ton, or 15 cents a bushel on 115,000 metric tons of wheat. A week
earlier the subsidy was 2.98 Ecu a ton.
<p>
   Cocoa prices fell amid speculation that crops in West Africa, in
the early stages of harvest, were less damaged than expected by dry
weather.
<p>
   Last year, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower,
produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa. Estimates for this
year's harvest are as low as 850,000 tons on expectations that
unusually dry weather damaged the crop.
<p>
   Now, recent rain is leading traders to revise their forecasts.
Since the bulk of harvesting won't take place until November, the
moisture will have time to reinvigorate the crop.
<p>
   ``There was really dry weather along the Ivory Coast during
September, but for most of the summer, temperatures were close to
normal, and that may mean that less of the crop was damaged and
should come in close to about 1 million tons,'' said Walter Spilka,
a commodity analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in New York.
<p>
   Cocoa for December delivery fell as much as $43, or 2.5 percent,
to $1,660 a metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New
York.
<p>
   In other growing regions, including Indonesia, weather
conditions remain dry, increasing concern that global cocoa
harvests will be low.
<p>
   Hogs were little changed before today's release of a quarterly
government report that's expected to show an increase in the
nation's herd.
<p>
   About 60.3 million hogs and pigs were on U.S. farms as of Sept.
1, up 3.6 percent from 58.2 million head a year earlier, analysts
expect the report to show. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will
release the report at 3 p.m. Eastern time, after the markets close.
<p>
   The increase comes as feed costs declined, making it more
profitable for farmers to raise animals to market-weight and
encouraging them to expand their herds.
<p>
   ``It's a report day and everybody's squaring out their
positions,'' said Dennis Smith, a broker at LIT Investor Services
in Chicago.
<p>
   October hogs were recently trading at 69.3 cents a pound, down
0.425 cent on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Corel Corp. expects its move
into the corporate market for software will be profitable within a
few quarters even though it's now dominated by Microsoft Corp.
<p>
   Michael Cowpland, Corel's president and chief executive, said
the focus on corporate sales rather than its traditional retail
market will be successful because the company has new software
products and plans to boost its sales force.
<p>
   His optimism comes even though Corel earlier this week reported
a third-quarter loss of US$31.4 million, or 52 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of US$3.2 million, or 5 cents.
Corel expects to lose US$15 million to US$20 million in the fourth
quarter.
<p>
   ``The business going into 1998 will be profitable just based on
our core products,'' Cowpland said in an interview.
<p>
   To win corporate business for its WordPerfect software, which
includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation
applications, Corel will hire 50 salesmen within the next six
months. The company will also start a service and technology
integration business that will hire 30 people over the next year.
<p>
   Corel is hoping revenue will receive a boost when its new
network computers from wholly owned Corel Computer Corp. start
shipping in the fourth quarter, he said.
<p>
   Network computers are no frills desktop machines that rely on a
central computer to store data and software. Corel believes network
computers save money because they're cheaper to maintain than
desktop computers.
<p>
   Although Cowpland declined to project Corel Computer's unit
sales next year, he said the company will go public when it shows
sustainable sales.
<p>
   Corel said it will break even or have a small profit in year
ended November 1998 while will be flat at about US$325 million.
<p>
   Corel shares rose C$0.15 to C$5.60 in midafternoon Toronto
trading.

 &UR; TRAVEL AGENTS FUME OVER REDUCED AIRLINE COMMISSIONS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE RAINE &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Most major U.S. airlines have now cut travel
agent commissions to 8 percent from 10 percent on flights they
book, biting into an already frayed relationship and causing agents
to rethink the essence of their business.
<p>
   Continental Airlines announced Thursday it was joining other
major U.S. carriers, including United, which announced the
commission trim on Sept. 18, as well as American, Delta, Northwest
and U.S. Airways. The airlines say the action will mean big
savings.
<p>
   ``I feel like the medieval prisoner who is about to feel the
screw,'' said Rita Gilmore, owner of Travel Center Inc. in
Burlingame, Calif. Gilmore, like many other agents, bemoaned the
change she believes will hurt consumers by reducing competition  &MD; 
at least by making information about competitive fares more
difficult to get.
<p>
   She and others said the cut in commissions will cause a sea
change in the travel agency industry, away from heavy reliance on
airline bookings and toward broader travel sales.
<p>
   There may be more emphasis on cruises, tours for individuals and
groups, for example, said Sheila Hyman, owner of Tanforan Travel in
San Bruno, Calif.
<p>
   ``In my office we are going back to selling travel, not just air
transportation, and I think that is what agents have to do,'' Hyman
said.
<p>
   Moreover, for the first time, travel agents may in the future
begin to charge a fee to clients for booking airline reservations
to compensate for the 20 percent decline in their revenues they say
the lower commissions represent. A few have already begun to do so,
according to the American Society of Travel Agents, a trade
association.
<p>
   ``We will not be able to do things for free like we once did,
but we will still give our clients service which the airlines do
not do. And, we will search for unbiased (information) and the best
ticket fares,'' said Hyman, who is also a member of the board of
directors of the travel agents' association.
<p>
   The association, in Alexandria, Va., Thursday was reviewing its
options, ``legislative, legal and otherwise,'' spokesman James
Ashurst said.
<p>
   The relationship between airlines and travel agents began to
deteriorate in 1995 when first Delta and then other major carriers
imposed a commission cap of $50 on each round-trip ticket and $25
for each one-way flight. The travel agents complained bitterly, and
lost $1 billion in revenue in a year's time.
<p>
   Following the commission cap, they said the fee reduction is
particularly painful. ``The dog is down, so they are going to kick
it,'' said Mike Hayes, owner of Left Coast Travel in San Francisco.
<p>
   Travel agents book about 80 percent of the airlines' domestic
and international sales, which adds up to about $70 billion. The
nation's 35,000 travel agents are on pace to sell the same amount
this year, having sold $44 billion by Aug. 31, said ASTA.
<p>
   However, the relationship is costly, the airlines complain. The
2 percentage point reduction ``reflects our larger objective of
keeping all of our costs under control,'' United Airlines Chairman
and chief executive Gerald Greenwald said recently.
<p>
   He said he anticipated a savings of from $80 million to $100
million annually. ``It will allow United to more effectively thrive
in an increasingly competitive airline marketplace and it will
allow us to invest more in our product and services to travelers,''
he said.
<p>
   Two major international carriers have said they would reduce the
commissions  &MD;  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which has a partnership
with Northwest, and Lufthansa, which has a partnership with United.
<p>
   In Dallas, Southwest Airlines said it would continue to pay
travel agents a 10 percent commission. The airline's president and
chief executive, Herb Kelleher, made the 10 percent commitment to
agents in 1995 and he reiterated this week that it is good through
2000.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Senate Republican Leader
Trent Lott opened a long-sought debate on campaign finance reform
today by attacking President Bill Clinton. Lott said there's no
reason to impose new restrictions on campaign contributions and
spending, but said existing laws need to be obeyed by all,
including the Democratic president. ``President Clinton's standing
on the subject of campaign finance reform is a case study of the
problem, not an exemplar of the solution,'' Lott said. ``Indeed, it
would take the Senate and the House too, staying in marathon
session all the way through Christmas, just to trace the appalling
campaign finance practices that were so large a part of Mr.
Clinton's re-election effort,'' Lott said.
<p>
   Lott's partisan fire set the tone for the debate that followed.
<p>
   The full Senate is expected to take much of the next few weeks
considering legislation that would ban so-called soft money
contributions to political parties, as well as bolster disclosure
requirements on donations to individual candidates. No votes are
anticipated until at least next week, when some amendments will
likely be considered. It remains unclear if the entire measure will
ever be voted on this year. ``This is a defining moment,'' said
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. ``The American people . . .
know the system is broken (and) we have the opportunity to fix
it.''
<p>
   ``People who think they can kill this effort with political
gamesmanship without anyone noticing are wrong,'' Daschle said.
``If we squander this opportunity, it will not go unnoticed.''
<p>
   Lott said he expects the sharply divided, Republican-led Senate
will be unable to agree on a measure, regardless how it may be
revised and amended.
<p>
   ``Are we going to come together on a consensus?'' said Lott, a
foe of the legislation backed by Clinton. ``I have my doubts we
have reached that point.''
<p>
   Lott and fellow Republicans believe they can kill the measure by
preventing it by filibustering. To cut off debate and move to an up
or down vote would require the support of 60 of the chamber's 100
lawmakers.
<p>
   At this point, proponents have the backing of just 49 lawmakers
-- all of the chamber's 45 Democrats, along with four of the 55
Republicans.
<p>
   Sens. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell Feingold,
a Wisconsin Democrat, are chief sponsors of the legislation.
<p>
   McCain, Feingold and their fellow proponents say the measure is
needed to curb the chase for money on Capitol Hill, which now sees
lawmakers scheduling votes on legislation around their respective
fund raisers.
<p>
   Special interests, from business to labor to environmentalists,
often contribute simply to secure access to lawmakers on
legislation affecting their respective causes.
<p>
   McCain, in making a pitch for his bill, said, ``Most Americans
believe we will let this nation pay any price, bear any burden, to
ensure the success of our personal ambitions.'' ``Now is the moment
we can show the American people that they are wrong,'' he said.
``We can take courage from our convictions and not our campaign
treasuries.''
<p>
   Lott and other opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill maintain
that restrictions on campaign contributions and spending would
amount to an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. ``The
America people can decide for themselves . . . who to trust on this
matter, which goes to the heart of their personal rights,'' Lott
said.
<p>
   Lott used the forum to take a number of partisan shots at
Clinton, the target of a congressional probe as well as a Justice
Department review for suspected fund-raising abuses.
<p>
   Lott noted that Clinton arranged to attend a fund-raiser in
Houston today. ``What is he saying, 'Stop me before I do it again!'
''
<p>
   Lott had opposed taking up the McCain-Feingold bill, but made a
sudden about-face yesterday. He did so just two days after Clinton
threatened to keep Congress in session until it considered the
measure, backed by a number of public-interest groups.
<p>
   House Republican Leader Dick Armey of Texas said Tuesday that
his chamber would consider a similar measure this year as well.
<p>
   He and other House Republican leaders, however, have declined to
say when that debate would begin.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican and long-time
foe of campaign spending limits, said yesterday he would favor
legislation that removes restrictions on giving.

   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. will run up against
startling budget deficits that will spark inflation unless the cost
of Social Security and other government entitlement programs are
curbed, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow said
today.
<p>
   ``The failure to reform Social Security and other entitlement
programs will most likely result in massive future budget
deficits,'' Moskow said in the text of a speech today at a
conference savings, investment and Social Security.
<p>
   Moskow told the investment bankers, company executives, and
economists at the conference that such deficits can trigger
inflation and cut productivity because reduced savings and
investment lowers the supply of capital and thereby pushes up
interest rates. In his speech, Moskow didn't comment on the conduct
of monetary policy or the outlook for the U.S. economy.
<p>
   ``The Fed has a strong and ingrained belief in the absolute need
to keep inflation low,'' Moskow said. ``Massive deficits, over
time, will generate enormous inflationary pressures on the
economy,'' Moskow said.
<p>
   ``It's an economic time bomb that we're bequeathing to the next
generation,'' he said in prepared remarks to be delivered at a
Chicago Fed conference on savings and investment sponsored by the
University of Chicago.
<p>
   Though Moskow credited the government with creating a nearly
balanced U.S. budget, he called for changes to avoid the huge
deficits that could result from spiraling entitlement costs for
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
   The Fed bank president recommended putting entitlement programs
on a ``sound financial basis'' or effectively scaling back the
programs, since raising taxes as the only alternative.
<p>
   If action isn't taken to rein in costs, the deficit will make up
about 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product by the
year 2030, Moskow said, citing Congressional Budget Office
estimates.
<p>
   ``We can avoid hard decisions in the short run by borrowing to
cover ongoing deficits,'' he said. ``This will simply result in
more severe problems as we find ourselves financing even larger
deficits down the road.''
<p>
   Moskow is a voting member of the U.S. central bank's Federal
Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy. The FOMC
hasn't changed the overnight bank lending rate since raising it by
a quarter point to 5.50 percent in March. U.S. policymakers meet
again Tuesday, when they're expected again to leave interest rates
unchanged.
<p>
   Economists and investors expect Fed policymakers to stay on the
sidelines for now because inflation remains low and their most
recent remarks suggest they're satisfied with the economy's
performance.
<p>
   Earlier this month, for example, Fed Gov. Laurence Meyer called
the economy ``extraordinary.'' In addition, he said in a Pittsburgh
speech, ``prospects look favorable for continued expansion and
relatively low inflation.''
<p>
   Meyer's remarks echoed those of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
earlier this month said the economy is close to price stability,
driven by productivity gains that are understated by official
government statistics.
<p>
   Still, the latest round of economic news has raised concern that
the economy might be growing fast enough to bump against capacity
constraints -- the first step of the inflationary spiral.
<p>
   Factory orders for big-ticket items rose a larger-than-expected
2.7 percent in August, for example, suggesting manufacturers either
have early evidence that their products are in demand or are
betting on a pickup in consumer spending.
<p>
   The Fed's own measure of the amount of factory capacity in use
rose to 83.9 percent in August, the highest level since September
1995, as factory output surged.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Wyche Fowler, President Clinton's nominee to be
U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, has promised to help a San
Francisco woman whose two daughters were abducted from the United
States by their father, a Saudi national.
<p>
   Fowler told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in written
testimony this week that he would ``work for a long-term
satisfactory solution to this case.''
<p>
   Eleven years ago, Patricia Roush's ex-husband, Khalid
Al-Gheshayan, took their daughters to Saudi Arabia, and she has
seen them only once since then.
<p>
   Roush, who works as a home nurse, and Al-Gheshayan had their
first child in 1978 and their second in 1982. Shortly afterward,
Al-Gehshayan returned to his home country alone.
<p>
   In January 1985, Roush and the two children joined him in Saudi
Arabia in a failed reconciliation attempt. After a few months, she
and the children returned to the United States, where she filed for
divorce and was awarded sole custody.
<p>
   In January 1986, Al-Gheshayan went to Chicago, where Roush and
the girls were then living, for a visit and suddenly took the
children to Saudi Arabia. According to Saudi law, he has sole
custody.
<p>
   Roush has been trying to get her daughters back ever since. In a
letter to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, she
praised Fowler's predecessor, former U.S. Ambassador Raymond Mabus,
calling him ``very effective'' in his efforts to help her.
<p>
   But she charged that Fowler, who took the post in a
congressional recess appointment in August 1996, has not helped.
<p>
   ``Wyche Fowler had over one year to assist in any way to help
get my girls home, and yet he did nothing,'' she wrote in opposing
his confirmation. ``Let's give someone else a chance, not Mr.
Fowler.''
<p>
   Roush said Mabus had tried to pressure her ex-husband by
refusing to grant visas to members of his family who wanted to
visit the United States, but that Fowler had lifted the ban on the
visas.
<p>
   In response to questions submitted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., Fowler wrote that withholding the visas ``would not
guarantee (Al-Gheshayan's) compliance'' with U.S. requests for the
return of the children.
<p>
   Fowler also said he had arranged for Roush to visit her
daughters this year in Saudi Arabia at no cost to her.
<p>
   He called the Saudi government ``determined and helpful within
the possibilities of Saudi law'' in trying to resolve the issue.
<p>
   But Roush said the Saudis had ``never cooperated'' with the U.S.
government on the case. She said she plans to hold a hunger strike
in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington in October.
<p>
   She also dismissed Fowler's offer of a free visit to Saudi
Arabia, saying she wants something more substantial than her
two-hour visit in 1995.
<p>
   Fowler's confirmation has been temporarily blocked by Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., who requested more information from him. An aide
to Ashcroft declined to reveal the questions Ashcroft had but said
they were ``run of the mill'' inquiries. Fowler's nomination is
expected to be approved.

<p>
   Glorious Julie Walters  &MD;  the ardent student of ``Educating
Rita'' and the savvy madam to elite London of ``Personal Services''
 &MD;  gets her chance to glow again for American audiences in
``Intimate Relations.''
<p>
   In addition to a gift for accents, a chameleon-like mien and a
boisterous talent to impersonate, Walters is also a steely
risk-taker when it comes to the selection of roles. She was the
odious matron who employed the murderous pair of cleaning girls in
``Sister My Sister,'' a part she appeared to relish.
<p>
   In ``Intimate Relations,'' she is no easier to take as Marjorie,
a dissatisfied 50-ish English housewife who has banned her
one-legged husband, Stanley (Matthew Walker), from her bedroom,
which she shares instead with their 13-year-old daughter, Joyce
(Laura Sadler). Although she cringes at the touch of her husband,
she yearns for what she calls ``comfort,'' and when Marjorie needs
a lift, she takes in a handsome young boarder.
<p>
   Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves) is the boarder, a fellow of perhaps
30, recently out of the merchant marine and the product of a lousy
childhood and a school for troubled youngsters. He certainly is
amiable when he moves in. He charms Joyce and her friends and
becomes a member of the family. Marjorie insists that he call her
``Mum,'' and he basks in the homey atmosphere.
<p>
   But Marjorie quickly makes known that her urges extend far
beyond the motherly. Soon she is sleeping with him every night, and
for a while they seem a happy pair. But there's a complication.
Joyce likes to lie in bed next to them as they make love, which she
is allowed to do so long as she agrees to keep Stanley in the dark
about the hanky-panky.
<p>
   So Harold is living with a young blackmailer who starts asking
him to ``do to me what you do to Mum,'' and her mother, a seemingly
insane nymphomaniac. To spice it all up, Marjorie is also a pious
moralist who lectures the girls at the laundry where she works to
be ``good.''
<p>
   She thinks she fulfills her parental duties when she tells Joyce
that if she needs information about sex, she should feel free to
ask her older married sister about it. All the while Marjorie
manages to cheerfully ignore the fact that her daughter is watching
the sex act every night, which also happens to be the cuckolding of
her father.
<p>
   Writer-director Phillip Goodhew is a gifted storyteller who
adapted this material from a true-life English incident of 1954
that, as they say, ``rocked the nation.''
<p>
   Sadler, in her first film, is good at conveying a young girl's
curiosity while maintaining the naivete of her youth. Another
standout in the cast is Elizabeth McKechnie, who plays Iris Guppy,
Harold's disapproving sister-in-law.
<p>
   But Walters steals the picture with the assistance of Goodhew's
great dialogue. When Stanley begs Marjorie for sex, she slaps him
down and says, ``Stanley, be a man.'' That this movie is at least
partly about confusion, sexual and otherwise, is neatly summed up
in that funny, ironic and cruel directive.

   Atlanta, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- SunTrust Banks Inc. said it
agreed to acquire investment bank and brokerage Equitable
Securities Corp. for about $148.9 million in stock and incentives,
in a bid to expand its securities business.
<p>
   The Atlanta-based bank's new securities unit, SunTrust Equitable
Securities, will combine Equitable Securities' corporate finance
and stock research, underwriting sales and trading capabilities
with the fixed-income capabilities of its SunTrust Capital Markets.
<p>
   ``The addition of Equitable strengthens our strategy of
providing a full range of financial services to our corporate,
commercial and private banking customers,'' said Sun Trust
President L. Phillip Humann in a statement.
<p>
   SunTrust joins its banking rivals as they acquire securities
companies, allowing them to offer more products to businesses and
investors. SunTrust wants to supply all financial services from
bonds and stocks to loans and checking accounts, as the regulatory
walls between brokers and banks erode.
<p>
   SunTrust said it will issue 1.31 million shares, worth $87.9
million based on yesterday's close, for the closely held Equitable
Securities. That's about 3.26 times its $27 million book value. The
bank said it will pay an additional 909,000 shares, worth $61
million, over three to five years, based on the new unit's
performance.
<p>
   The bank said the transaction, scheduled to close during the
first quarter, will have no impact on earnings per share.
<p>
   Nashville, Tennessee-based Equitable Securities, founded in
1930, also has private banking and money management businesses with
about $1.5 billion under management. It has offices in Nashville,
Atlanta and Houston.
<p>
   SunTrust is the 20th-largest U.S. bank with $62.8 billion in
total assets and 700 branches in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama. It's shares rose 13/16 to 68 3/16 in midday trading.
<p>
   Last month, SunTrust Capital Markets head R. Charles Shufeldt
told the Bloomberg Forum the bank would apply for regulatory
permission to underwrite debt and equity after the Federal Reserve
eased restrictions on bank-owned securities businesses. Permission
is expected to be granted during the first quarter.

<p>
   A frined once told me that the subject of discussion during his
years of all-male poker games was always, in one way or another,
women.
<p>
   So here are Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins lost in the harsh
Alaskan wilderness, living through ``Deliverance,'' trying to
figure out which way is south and fighting off a charging bear.
They're two guys doing a guy thing, and what is the undercurrent
throughout? Women.
<p>
   Well, one woman in particular. She's Mickey (Elle MacPherson), a
model who is the young wife of billionaire Charles Morse (Hopkins)
and, it appears, pretty good friends with fashion photographer Bob
Green (Baldwin).
<p>
   They're all traveling together for a magazine shoot with a
wilderness feel. Bob, being the artist he is, needs an authentic
native face to accompany Mickey's haute couture visage in the
photo. He hears of such a person a plane ride away and invites his
assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau) and Charles to go along for
the ``adventure.''
<p>
   They get more adventure than they planned when the plane crashes
in the middle of nowhere, a nowhere that's cold, mountainous and
full of bears.
<p>
   Fortunately, Charles is the studious type. His head ever in a
book, he is an encyclopedia of what only the night before seemed to
be trivial information but now proves vital to survival. Why just
yesterday, Charles read that a compass can be made from a needle
and a leaf. And when mealtime comes, he can handily construct a
gizmo to entrap a juicy looking squirrel. When they're being
stalked by a man-eater, Charles even devises a bear strategy. Bob
looks on derisively and points out while spitting on the rich, ``in
a crisis you bloom.'' In other words, it's bad enough that you have
money; you also have brains and ingenuity.
<p>
   What bugs me deeply about this movie is the constant reiteration
that somehow arrogant Bob is a fun guy while Charles is a zero with
deep pockets. Charles seems to enjoy adding confirming lore with
self-denigrating observations. He tells Bob, ``I have no
imagination.'' For goodness sake, given all the creative ways
Charles keeps the wanderers going through cold, hunger and physical
breakdown, you have to ask just what definition of ``imagination''
this fellow is using.
<p>
   However well director Lee Tamahori paced the film and captured
the beauty of the setting (with the help of cinematographer Donald
M. McAlpine), he still remains stubbornly bogged down with the
getting lost part of the movie, deferring the far more interesting
and less repetitive psychological aspects until it's nearly too
late.
<p>
   We could have done with one or two fewer wilderness ordeals in
order to have gotten to the final inevitable confrontation between
Charles and Bob about 20 minutes sooner.
<p>
   The director appeared at a recent screening of ``The Edge'' and,
in an introduction, laughingly called this picture a ``David
Mamet-Anthony Hopkins action movie,'' as if two such distinguished
personages as the prize-winning playwright and the lauded
Shakespearean actor would be incapable of making a common, lousy
old action movie.
<p>
   Unfortunately, it would take more than these two presences to
keep this movie from being run-of-the-mill. It takes more than a
few lines of clever dialogue, a hero who reads books, and an actor
with British training and lots of dignity to keep a movie from
going pretty much by the book.

 &UR; THOUGH THEIR STATES MAY BENEFIT, GOP LEADERS RESIST CENSUS SAMPLING
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release Sunday, Sept. 28.
<p>
    &UR; By JEANNE CUMMINGS &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; and MARK SHERMAN &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Tucked away in North Georgia, a thriving Hispanic
community runs the sewing machines in Dalton textile shops and
assembly lines in Gainesville poultry plants.
<p>
   They keep households, attend county schools, and have babies in
the local hospitals. Lots of people know them.
<p>
   But according to the federal government, they don't exist.
<p>
   The 25,000 to 50,000 Hispanic residents of North Georgia are
among the people overlooked by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1990 when
it sent out millions of questionnaires and an army of volunteers to
count, one by one, the people of America.
<p>
   As the nation approaches the 2000 census, similar pockets of
uncounted residents throughout the country are becoming pawns in a
struggle between the Republicans and Democrats over political
power.
<p>
   Reversing his own position, House Speaker Newt Gingrich this
week is expected to urge the House to attach to a budget bill an
amendment that is aimed at prohibiting the Census Bureau from
employing a new and arguably more accurate method for counting
Americans.
<p>
   President Clinton, bolstered by the support of the Census Bureau
director from the Bush administration, has vowed to veto the bill
if the amendment is attached.
<p>
   In the national arena, control of the House may hang in the
balance. For many states, the stakes are financial as well as
political.
<p>
   Many federal programs are financed based on population. An
undercount of a state's population could mean it will receive less
than its fair share of federal dollars for housing, education, law
enforcement and roads.
<p>
   In addition, an undercount of Georgia's population could mean
that the fast-growing state will miss an opportunity to gain one,
or even two, new congressional seats  &MD;  giving it wider
representation on key House committees that guide the flow of
federal spending.
<p>
   For example, there is no Georgian currently serving on the
Transportation Committee, which allocates money for roads and mass
transit. California has six members on the panel.
<p>
   The benefits of a true count are clear to Gingrich. In a 1990
letter to Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, he noted that a
200,000 undercount in the state's population in the last census
``would have a serious negative impact on Georgia.''
<p>
   The state would lose a new congressional seat, minority voting
would be ``seriously diluted,'' and Georgia would be forced to
raise money ``to provide for an additional 200,000'' residents
without any federal assistance, Gingrich said. He urged Mosbacher
use a system of statistical analysis to more accurately reflect the
state's population.
<p>
   But today, the stakes for Gingrich are much more personal.
<p>
   Gingrich's position as speaker could be on the line if the next
census reflects the millions of minorities and poor, rural whites
overlooked nationally in 1990.
<p>
   Every 10 years, state legislatures are required to take the new
census numbers and redraw the lines of congressional and state
legislative seats to reflect population shifts.
<p>
   Republicans fear that if the 2000 census shows a sharp upswing
in inner-city populations or even in poor rural areas, they would
lose some of their GOP-rich suburban districts.
<p>
   Jim Nicholson, Republican National Committee chairman, has said
that 24 to 26 House seats now held by Republicans could be in
jeopardy if the newly proposed method of counting Americans is
employed. The Republicans currently hold an 11-seat majority in the
House.
<p>
   ``This is a debate over whose vote will be heard and who will be
silenced,'' said Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez, D-N.Y.
<p>
   According to experts on both sides of the fight, the 1990 Census
missed 5 percent of the nation's Hispanic population, 4.4 percent
of African-Americans, and just 0.7 percent of whites.
<p>
   To improve those numbers, the Census Bureau wants to bolster its
traditional head-counting efforts with scientific sampling  &MD;  taking
information from a small cross-section of the population to arrive
at a complete count. The process is similar to that used in
political polling.
<p>
   The sampling results would be checked for accuracy by
re-visiting 750,000 households that are supposed to be
representative of the entire population.
<p>
   Although the process has been applauded by the National Academy
of Sciences and experts on statistics, Republicans charge that it
is guesswork and a chance for the Clinton administration to play
politics with the census.
<p>
   ``It's like throwing mud on the wall and seeing if it sticks,''
said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the GOP's lone black House member.
<p>
   Watts and others said the Republican conference is prepared to
provide whatever funds are necessary to get an accurate Census
count without sampling. But when told that the bureau estimates it
would need another $400 to $800 million to produce its best
product, lawmakers scoffed. ``Every department says they need more
money,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.
<p>
   In addition to his doubts about the accuracy of sampling,
Gingrich switched his position on the issue after becoming
convinced the method violates the Constitution's requirement for an
``actual enumeration'' of the population, said Christina Martin,
his spokeswoman.
<p>
   Matt Glavin, president of the Georgia-based Southeastern Legal
Foundation, plans to file a lawsuit to prevent the Census Bureau
from employing sampling, even though he concedes it will likely
produce a more accurate count of Americans.
<p>
   ``But what's important for purposes of reapportionment is the
distributive accuracy,'' said Glavin. By that, he meant, the
block-by-block household count that lawmakers ultimately will use
to redraw the lines of congressional and state legislative
districts.
<p>
   While Glavin reflects the worry of the House leadership, not all
Republicans are convinced that a more accurate census will
translate into reduced political power.
<p>
   ``My party thinks it will kill us politically, regardless of its
merits,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who noted that
Mississippi could lose a seat now held by a Republican if the
state's population is undercounted.
<p>
   ``I believe opposition to sampling ultimately hurts the minority
community that deserves to be counted like all Americans,'' he
added. ``Opposition to [census] sampling does not help outreach to
the minority community.'' The GOP leadership has been trying to
expand its majority by recruiting minorities.
<p>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster and consultant, also said
complaints about sampling are without merit. ``The methodology is
not only defensible but entirely reasonable,'' said Ayres.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The nominations are out for the annual VH1
Fashion Awards, an event more accurately known as Celebrities in
Free Dresses Night.
<p>
   Last year's cablefest was hosted by Heather Locklear, who is to
fashion what Cheez Whiz is to hors d'oeuvres. This year's
broadcast, which airs on Oct. 28, will boast a live performance by
the Rolling Stones, who are to rock what Wayne Newton is to Vegas.
<p>
   Are the awards just an excuse to haul the stars out in finery
given to them by designers? Yes. Does it still matter who wins? You
bet. One of life's simple pleasures is guessing who'll walk away
with the VeeHee (OK, they don't call it that, but it needs
something catchy to get up to Oscar and Emmy speed).
<p>
   Here are the nominees and projected winners in a few top
categories:
<p>
    &MD;  Womenswear designer of the year: Ann Demeulemeester, Tom Ford
for Gucci, John Galliano, Helmut Lang, Miuccia Prada. Although Ford
is still Hollywood's favorite, Galliano has provoked the most
outrage with his misogynistic flights of fancy. He wins on sheer
audacity.
<p>
    &MD;  Best new designer: John Bartlett for women, Antonio Berardi,
Daryl K, Stella McCartney, Narciso Rodriguez. Bartlett's a media
darling, but Stella McCartney is Paul's daughter. VH1 will love,
love her do.
<p>
    &MD;  Best second collection: CK by Calvin Klein, D by DKNY, Helmut
Lang Jeans by Helmut Lang, Miu Miu by Miuccia Prada, Versus by
Donatella Versace. Every award show needs an emotional highlight.
VH1 will get its when Donatella accepts in honor of her late
brother.
<p>
    &MD;  Best personal style  &MD;  female: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,
Cameron Diaz, Courtney Love, Nicole Kidman, Kate Moss. Love has
made the most impressive transformation, but Bessette Kennedy has
the power to turn what she wears into must-haves. And in fashion,
what sells, wins.
<p>
    &MD;  Best personal style  &MD;  male: George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Will
Smith, Howard Stern, Vince Vaughn. Anyone but Stern is the motto
here. Best guess is Will Smith, a stylish man in black, or any
other color.
<p>
    &MD;  Sweet Tart. San Francisco's Knucklehead Inc. is launching a
new junior line in the under-$50 range that deserves its saucy
name. Tart, as in downright tarty, is a little edgier, a little
more European than the average sportswear and dress line for 15- to
25-year-olds. Expect sassy leopard slip dresses, red and brocade
slip tops, leopard bandeau tops, crocheted tunics, and double-layer
chiffon dresses with a schoolgirl Prada feeling.
<p>
   The cool-girl clothes will be sold at Nordstrom, Contempo
Casuals, and Wet Seal, among others, and will be launched
officially at an industry party next month in Los Angeles at the
Mondrian. They may also pop up on TV  &MD;  NBC's sitcom ``The Naked
Truth'' has requested clothes, as have ``Clueless'' and ``Melrose
Place.''
<p>
   Tart even has a motto  &MD;  ``you want to, so wear it.'' Try telling
your mother that when you're 15.

<p>
   Fifty years ago on Oct. 14, Capt. Chuck Yeager and a small team
of American pilots and engineers smashed aviation's most mysterious
and dangerous barrier, the speed of sound. In a four-part series of
color graphics with authoritative text, artist and former airman
William Pitzer brilliantly recreates the key events that led to the
supersonic age.
<p>
   The series is being distributed by The New York Times Syndicate.
The graphics are available for downloading at Wieck Photo Database
or NewsCom or arrangements can be made to have the files e-mailed.
<p>
   A description follows.
<p>
   ----------------------------------------------
<p>
   ``Part 1: Mr. `Right Stuff.''' Given his choice of assignments
after World War II, ace combat pilot Chuck Yeager decides purely by
chance to fly out of Wright Field, near Dayton, Ohio. He soon
realizes that he has stumbled into a pilot's paradise. Wright
offers hangars full of airplanes to fly and will involve Yeager in
the greatest advance in aviation since Kitty Hawk.
<p>
   ``Part 2: Wall in the Sky.'' The invisible barrier shows its
dark side as British aviator Geoffrey de Havilland, 36, approaches
Mach 0.87 before his jet disintegrates over the Thames. His death
leads to speculation that no craft can navigate the shock waves
generated near the speed of sound.
<p>
   ``Part 3: Bell's Mach-Buster.'' In late 1944, a young engineer
for Bell Aircraft stops by Wright Field to chat about the problems
of high-speed aircraft. By the time he leaves, Bell has committed
to building a transonic research aircraft for the Army Air Forces.
However, the assault on Mach 1 will be done by a military test
pilot from Wright Field.
<p>
   ``Part 4: High Desert Hero.'' From a pool of 125 test pilots,
one name keeps coming up: Capt. Chuck Yeager. He and an elite team
move to a remote air field in California, where on its ninth
powered flight, the Bell X-1 pierces the ``wall in the sky,'' and
the world's first sonic boom thunders across the desert.

 &UR; BRAZIL'S CONFAB BETS ON INFRASTRUCTURE BOOM: BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Shasta Darlington &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Sao Paulo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian steel pipe maker
Confab Industrial SA is betting on an explosion in infrastructure
projects, boosted by oil joint ventures and the nation's 1998
election year, to keep the company running at full capacity through
2000.
<p>
   ``We're looking at a lot of projects,'' Tulio Cesar Chipoletti,
the director of Confab's pipe division told the Bloomberg Forum.
``We're at a very high level of production and we're going to
maintain it.''
<p>
   Confab raised its profile with oil companies in January when it
won a contract to supply steel tubes for a $2 billion pipeline
connecting Bolivian natural gas fields to Brazil's energy-thirsty
coastal regions.
<p>
   Since then, the company's share price has more than doubled.
While the Sao Paulo stock exchange took a nose dive in August,
suffering its biggest loss in more than five years, Confab soared
another 25 percent.
<p>
   ``Investors are looking at all of the projects coming up in
South America and seeing Confab's positive position,'' Chipoletti
said.
<p>
   Confab can produce up to 500,000 tons of steel tubes per year,
depending on the type of production involved. In 1997, the company
expects to produce about 300,000 tons, full capacity when producing
mostly wide diameter welded tubes.
<p>
   ``There are still so many more opportunities,'' Chipoletti said.
Of particular interest is increased activity in the oil industry,
he said.
<p>
   Brazil's Congress approved a law in July opening the country's
oil industry to foreign investment and allowing state-controlled
Petrobras to form joint ventures with other companies to explore
for and distribute oil.
<p>
   Petrobras has since been in talks with more than 100 companies,
Chipoletti said, which should translate into an increase in
investments of at least 50 percent over the $3 billion that
Petrobras, already a big Confab customer, traditionally invests in
operations.
<p>
   ``We're already in talks with a lot of companies,'' Chipoletti
said. He said Confab won't reveal the companies until contracts are
actually signed.
<p>
   Confab is also in talks with Royal/Dutch Shell Group to supply
pipelines for its natural gas projects in Peru.
<p>
   The rapidly growing electrical energy industry is also expected
to be a source of new orders for Confab. Brazil is already one of
the world's largest electricity markets and it is growing at a rate
of 6 percent a year.
<p>
   The government has said it plans to build eight thermoelectric
plants by 2000. ``All of those plants are going to need pipelines,
which represent opportunities for Confab,'' he said.
<p>
   Confab expects natural gas will fuel 10 percent of Brazil's
energy production within the next four years, compared with 2
percent today, spurred by the completion of the Bolivia-Brazil
pipeline. ``It's going to induce other projects based on natural
gas,'' Chipoletti said.
<p>
   Energy and infrastructure projects are getting an extra boost
from the administration of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
will be running for reelection next year.
<p>
   ``During election years, you look to companies that benefit from
infrastructure projects,'' said Luiz Fernando Salatini who manages
$15 million in equities at Banco Industrial e Comercial SA,
including Confab shares.
<p>
   Chipoletti pointed out the government plans to invest 3.7
billion reais ($3.4 billion) in infrastructure projects in 1998,
826 million reais in water treatment and sewage projects and 1
billion reais in environmental projects.
<p>
   ``We've got room for more projects next year, so we're keeping
our eyes open,'' he said.
<p>
   While most of Confab's production is geared towards gas and oil
pipelines made at the company's factory in Pindamonhangaba in Sao
Paulo state, the company also produces up to 80,000 tons of tubes
for water and sewage projects.
<p>
   Confab doesn't plan to expand production, however, only keep it
running at full capacity, as it boost earnings by cutting costs and
increasing efficiency.
<p>
   The company's revenue rose more than 50 percent in the first
half of the year compared with the year-earlier period while
earnings almost tripled, only partly boosted by revenue from the
Bolivia-Brazil project, which was officially inaugurated in July.
<p>
   Confab also won a $14 million contract to supply a pipeline
connecting the newest offshore oil well in Campos Basin to a
Petrobras platform. In addition, Confab won two $10 million
contracts to provide pipes for regional gas distribution projects
in the northeast of Brazil and in Chile.
<p>
   The company invested $12 million in improving productivity in
1997 and plans to invest another $20 million over the next two
years, Chipoletti said.
<p>
   Confab has risen 120 percent this year on the Sao Paulo stock
exchange, to 2.47 reais from 1.12 reais at the beginning of the
year.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Gap Inc. dressed 3,500 traders
on the New York Stock Exchange in khaki pants and oxford shirts
today as the clothing retailer broadens advertising for its casual
clothes.
<p>
   While the company used to spend about 1 percent of its annual
revenue on advertising, mainly in magazines, newspapers and store
window displays, that's been boosted by about 50 percent to $150
million this year as the retailer moves into television, radio and
billboards.
<p>
   ``As a company we have under-marketed our brand in the past,''
said Robert Fisher, president of the Gap division, which includes
the Gap, babyGap and GapKids stores.
<p>
   The $250,000 NYSE event kicks off the company's ``Gap at Work''
ad campaign, which targets the increasing use of ``casual Fridays''
dressing among U.S. companies. Gap is backing its campaign with an
Internet site and in-store displays that show consumers how its
jeans, khakis and oxford shirts can be worn to work.
<p>
   ``When the rules get thrown out, a lot of people are mystified
about what to wear'' to work on casual days, Fisher said. ``This
event really shows our consumers ... that casual dressing is here
to stay.''
<p>
   San Francisco-based Gap has also developed about 20 television
commercials as it competes against other retailers that are
increasing the visibility of their brands nationally through the
use of radio and television.
<p>
   ``TV really is an incredible mass medium,'' said Fisher. ``In
terms of the percentage spent (on advertising), television will get
the lion's share.''
<p>
   The company operates about 830 Gap, 450 GapKids and 60 babyGap
stores. It plans to open about 25 Gap stores and 30 GapKids and
babyGap stores this year, Fisher said.
<p>
   It also operates stores in Canada, the U.K., France, Germany and
Japan, he said.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Bear Stearns Cos. Chairman
James Cayne warned that some brokerages may leave the clearing
business if they're responsible for the activities of their client
firms.
<p>
   The warning was made in a letter dated Sept. 9 to New York Stock
Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso. It was sent several days after
the NYSE board voted to require investment banks that process
trades for other brokerages to monitor trading by those firms and
pass on complaints about them to regulators. The new rule means
investment banks with clearing businesses will have to keep a
closer watch on client brokerages, called introducing brokers.
<p>
   Implementing the rule will cause clearing firms to ``severely
limit'' or even ``abandon'' their clearing business, Cayne said in
his letter.
<p>
   That rule change comes as the Manhattan district attorney's
office, the New York Attorney General's office and the Securities
and Exchange Commissions are examining the clearing business Bear
Stearns did for A.R. Baron &AMP; Co., which collapsed last year. A.R.
Baron's top executives allegedly defrauded customers of $75
million.
<p>
   Baron customers who lost money filed complaints with the
National Association of Securities Dealers, arguing Bear Stearns
should have warned investors of Baron's financial condition.
<p>
   ``It would be extremely costly to require clearing brokers to
expend significant resources on staffing and monitoring,
introducing broker compliance programs, particularly where clearing
brokers do not -- and cannot -- have any meaningful'' control over
those brokers, said Cayne in the letter.
<p>
   Enforcing such programs ``would expose brokers to the risk of
claims for substantial liability'' that would ``far'' outweigh the
compensation they get, the letter said.
<p>
   At issue is the $10 billion in annual revenue clearing produces
for Wall Street. Bear Stearns, the biggest U.S. clearing firm,
handles about 12 percent of NYSE trading volume and its clearing
business accounts for about 25 percent of profits, according to the
Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story.
<p>
   In the letter, Bear Stearns suggested ways to modify the
clearing business without hurting clearing firms, such as requiring
the introducing brokers to notify the clearing firms of any
regulatory inquiry or investigation and requiring brokers to
explain to customers that clearing firms only perform back office
and record keeping functions.
<p>
   The ``documents could emphasize -- in plain English -- that the
customers' account is managed and controlled solely by the
introducing brokerage, and not the clearing broker,'' the letter
said.
<p>
   Some brokerage firms have used the relationship they have with a
well-known investment bank that processes their trades to give the
impression they have an affiliation with the firm, instead of
simply buying its clearing services. For some customers the implied
affiliation lends the brokerages a credibility they wouldn't
otherwise have.
<p>
   Bear Stearns also suggested requiring clearing firms that get
complaints about introducing brokers from their customers to pass
along the information to the brokers or regulators. Any time an
investment bank stops clearing for a brokerage firm, it should be
obligated to notify the NASD, the letter also said.
<p>
   A NYSE spokesman declined to comment on the letter.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The National Football League
fined Indianapolis Colts linebacker Quentin Coryatt $7,500 for an
illegal hit on Buffalo Bills quarterback Todd Collins on Sunday.
<p>
   Coryatt, 27, was fined for hitting Collins in the head during
the Bills' 37-35 come-from-behind victory. Coryatt was blitzing and
hit Collins just as he released the ball.
<p>
   The 6-foot-3, 250-pounder will appeal the fine, his second in
the past two seasons, a team spokeswoman said.
<p>
   Last year, Coryatt was fined the same amount for a similar hit
on then-New York Jets quarterback Frank Reich.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The British pound tumbled
against the dollar and other major currencies on a report that the
U.K. may join Europe's economic and monetary union after it gets
underway in 1999.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against sterling in two
months after an unidentified cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the British government is more eager to join Europe's single
currency, or euro, than it was several months ago.
<p>
   Sterling climbed 25 percent against the German mark since August
1996, lifted by a booming economy, comparatively higher interest
rates and expectations the U.K. wouldn't join monetary union at the
outset.
<p>
   If Britain adopts the euro, the pound will have to weaken and
U.K. interest rates may have to be lowered to bring them more in
line with rates elsewhere in Europe, analysts said.
<p>
   ``If the markets start to believe U.K. interest rates will come
down to levels seen in Germany and France, sterling will come down
relative to other currencies,'' said Chris Iggo, chief economist at
BZW Securities Inc.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.31 percent versus the dollar, its largest
one-day decline since July 28, to $1.6085 from $1.6299 yesterday.
It also fell to 2.8306 marks from 2.8698 marks, it's biggest
one-day drop against the German currency in six weeks.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 121.25 yen from 121.13 yen. And
at 1.7590 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.
<p>
   Traders were undeterred in their flurry to sell pounds, even
after the U.K. Treasury dismissed the report as speculation. A
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said the government's
reserving its option to join monetary union.
<p>
   It's typical of the British government to ``float an idea first
to see how the public reacts,'' said Bob Savage, chief currency
trader at Lehman Brothers. This could have been an ``official
leak.''
<p>
   Economists reckon the pound is likely to join the single
currency at as low as 2.5 marks, Savage said.
<p>
   Still, British officials may not let the pound fall too far,
since an overly weak currency could fan inflation. With interest
rates in the U.K. already high, the government may have little
scope to raise them much further.
<p>
   ``They have a huge dilemma,'' Savage said. ``A quickly falling
pound could lead to disaster, while a rate rise could drive the
economy into recession.''
<p>
   Jesse Torres, chief currency trader at Bank Austria, was among
sterling sellers today.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the yen on concern over
rising trade tension between the U.S. and Japan. The dollar's
strength against the Japanese currency is pushing up the price of
U.S. exports and helping to tilt the balance of trade further in
Japan's favor.
<p>
   U.S. officials repeatedly call on Japan to do more to correct
that imbalance by stimulating domestic demand. Some traders are
concerned that if the U.S. trade gap keeps worsening, U.S.
officials might soften their support for a strong dollar.
<p>
   ``Difficulty with trade issues is growing and could become even
more of a problem,'' said Lehman Brothers' Bob Savage.
<p>
   Just yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Japan's trade surplus is causing concern in Washington,
according to reports. That echoed comments by U.S. Deputy Trade
Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.
<p>
   ``The U.S. administration is on the offensive,'' said Michael
Scarlatos, currency strategist at Bankers Trust New York Corp.
``Witness Barshefsky's language yesterday.''
<p>
   Still, supporting the dollar against the yen was expectation
Japan's economy will continue to weaken, keeping the country's
interest rates near their all-time lows and souring investors on
the yen.
<p>
   Also, since the yen's weakness benefits the economy by making
exports cheaper, Japanese officials may not mind too much if it
fall further.
<p>
   ``The economy is moribund, in terrible shape,'' said Savage.
``An export-led recovery seems to be the only way out.''
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the mark, recouping
earlier losses after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing
suggested he's satisfied with the dollar's level versus the mark.
<p>
   Concern that the German currency may be too weak ``hasn't
disappeared but it's not as strong,'' Issing said.
<p>
   Analysts consider Issing one of the Bundesbank's staunchest
inflation foes. The mark's weakness against the dollar raises
import prices and can fan inflation pressures, though traders took
his comments as a sign he doesn't think the currency's too weak.
<p>
   ``Issing's a right-winger, always vigilant on inflation,''
Scarlatos said. ``Now he's making comments that are somewhat
dovish.'' That's prompting traders to buy dollars, he said.
<p>
   The dollar fell against the mark in European trading after
comments by Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept
alive expectations that the central bank was poised to raise its
benchmark interest rate. Higher rates would boost the mark by
making some assets denominated in it more alluring.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 1.4500 Swiss francs from 1.4503
francs yesterday, and at 5.9060 French francs from 5.9165 francs.
The dollar also was little changed at 1718 Italian lire from 1719
lire. Canada's dollar was little changed at 72.21 U.S. cents from
72.29 cents.

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks fell for a
fourth day, led by gold producers as bullion prices declined.
Advancing oil issues and Canadian Pacific Ltd. tempered the broader
market's decline.
<p>
   Gold issues, which account for 6.36 percent of the benchmark
index, led the market lower after bullion fell from its highest
price in more than a month on weak demand for jewelry, particularly
in Japan and Southeast Asia.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery fell US$0.60 (US$0.43) to US$328.90
an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex Division.
<p>
   ``It's a mixed bag as the gold sector has backed off and
investors are taking some profits on financial-services stocks, but
there is really nothing that stands out,'' said Fred Ketchen, a
senior trader with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. ``There is some concern the
Bank of Canada will raise interest rates.''
<p>
   The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index fell 5.92 to
6969.80.
<p>
   Placer Dome Inc. fell C$0.50 to C$24.20, Barrick Gold Corp. slid
C$0.30 to C$32.60 and TVX Gold Corp. dropped C$0.15 to C$7.55.
<p>
   Investors are cautious ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting on
Tuesday.
<p>
   ``The market is marking time ahead of Tuesday's meeting and some
people are concerned the Fed will raise rates,'' said Ketchen.
<p>
   U.S. policy is closely watched by investors in Canada because
the two countries are each other's largest trading partners and any
rise in interest rates by the Fed may be matched by the Bank of
Canada to keep the currency competitive.
<p>
   Oil issues helped buoy the market with three energy issues
accounting for 11 million of the 78 million shares traded.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. was unchanged at C$13.10 on 3.83
million shares traded after it said it will price an initial public
offering of its Gulf Indonesia Resources Ltd. subsidiary on Monday,
then list the shares the next day on the New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
   The 21-million share offering will be priced between US$17 to
US$23 a share.
<p>
   Ranger Oil Ltd. and Elan Energy Inc. were also active after
Ranger said it purchased 490,000 common shares of Elan at an
average price of C$9.90 a share. Elan gained C$0.20 to C$10.15 and
it was the most actively traded stock on 4.88 million shares, while
Ranger rose C$0.55 to C$12.80 on 1.75 million shares.
<p>
   Canadian Pacific Ltd. rose C$0.35 to C$40.85 to help limit
losses on the broader market.
<p>
   ``There is a general optimism around the stock and when an
international investor wants to buy a piece of Canada, CP is one of
the stocks he buys,'' said Steve Bokor, a portfolio manager with
Majendie Charlton Securities Ltd.
<p>
   Canadian Pacific, which accounts for 2.6 percent of the
benchmark index, has interests ranging from rail and shipping to
energy.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. rose C$2.80 to C$33.30 on 2.7 million shares traded
after falling 32 percent yesterday when the software maker warned
growth will slow because customers are delaying purchases.
<p>
   On the broader market, declining issues outpaced advancers 477
to 453, with 315 unchanged.
<p>
   Financial services issues weighed the market even as the yield
on Canada's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5 basis points to 6.27.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after a revised U.S. economic report showed
growth with little inflation. Banks, which compete with bonds for
investors' attention because they both pay steady dividends,
typically gain as bond yields decline.
<p>
   Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce dropped C$0.25 to C$39.75,
Toronto Dominion Bank fell C$0.25 to C$47 and Royal Bank of Canada
slipped C$0.10 to C$67.70.
<p>
   In other stock activity, United Dominion Industries Ltd. rose
C$0.45 to C$39.70 after it announced the purchase of two companies
that manufacture and recondition equipment for the ice-cream
industry.
<p>
   United Dominion said it will buy Philadelphia-based Processing
Machinery &AMP; Supply Co. and New Jersey-based Alliance Food Equipment
Corp. for an undisclosed amount.
<p>
   Air Canada gained C$0.40 to C$12.80 after it said it will follow
the lead of U.S. carriers and reduce commissions paid to travel
agents on tickets purchased for all international flights in an
effort to cut costs.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Pete Rose applied for
reinstatement to Major League Baseball, which could make the
sport's all-time hits leader eligible for the Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Rose accepted a lifetime ban imposed in 1989 by
then-Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti for misconduct related to
gambling. Rose steadfastly maintains that he never bet on baseball,
although he said he bet on other sports.
<p>
   In a two-sentence statement, acting Commissioner Bud Selig said
the application would be ``handled in due course.''
<p>
   Rose spent 19 seasons in the major leagues as a player, amassing
4,256 career hits and posting a lifetime batting average of .303.
<p>
   He also managed the Cincinnati Reds from 1984-1989.
<p>
   Baseball's rules prohibit players and managers from betting on
baseball games.

<p>
   ``The Peacemaker,'' the first feature release by the
Katzenberg-Geffen-Spielberg studio Dreamworks, is a big, expensive
extravaganza about the danger of nuclear weapons, or the danger of
terrorists, or the danger of violent wars being allowed to rage
unchecked anywhere in the world.
<p>
   Or maybe it's about turning George Clooney, a less than
satisfying Batman, into an action-adventure hero on the Harrison
Ford payscale. Clooney has many outstanding features, including an
ability to convey massive self-confidence, a tendency to wrinkle up
his face into smiley creases whenever charm is called for and a
chin that someone might break a champagne bottle on one day if he's
not careful.
<p>
   What he doesn't have much of is variety. There is only so much
winking an audience can bear before gastrointestinal disturbance
sets in. His character, Lt. Col. Thomas Devoe, is an intelligence
officer with the U.S. Army's Special Forces. He is trained to be
cool under fire. He throws in unflappable, cocky and arrogant for
free.
<p>
   He has no compunction about embarrassing poor nuclear physicist
Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), the acting head of the White House
Nuclear Smuggling Group, when she conducts an ill-informed briefing
on a nuclear explosion and train accident somewhere in the Urals.
<p>
   See, Devoe has already figured out that the train wreck was no
accident but rather a ruse for the hijacking of nine nukes, so he
rather rudely corrects her in front of a roomful of colleagues.
This is what they refer to as ``meeting cute'' in Hollywood.
<p>
   Kidman is short-skirted, blond, irritable and miraculously
freckle-free here, all of which add up to make her the kind of
woman the naturally irritating Devoe would go for. But their
chemistry is negligible, mostly because Clooney's character already
seems to be in love  &MD;  with himself.
<p>
   Naturally, they are teamed to find the terrorists who have
stolen the bombs and are heading toward the Iran border by truck.
This takes the antagonistic pair to Vienna, where they meet with
Russian intelligence agent Vertikoff (who has an oddly Prussian
accent as played by the wonderful actor Armin Mueller-Stahl).
<p>
   There are many McGuffins here, a McGuffin being the word Alfred
Hitchcock used to describe the more or less irrelevent instigation
or event that sets in motion a movie's action. Some trucking
executive gets beaten up with enthusiastic brutality by Devoe in a
long sequence while the appalled Kelly works a computer to find the
truck that's carrying the bombs.
<p>
   Attack helicopters get into the act and so do satellites and an
old-boy network of intelligence agents. Kelly, a scientist who
worked on bombs and is now trying to save the world from them, is
drawn into what Devoe keeps referring to accusingly as the ``real
world,'' as in ``In the real world, nuclear weapons are heading
toward Iran!''
<p>
   He also likes to tell Kelly, when she thinks thoughts that take
more than two sentences to explain, ``It's this simple,'' and then
he reduces everything to black-and-white principles meant to demean
Kelly's broader analytical approach.
<p>
   ``When that satellite is out of range, those nukes are gone,''
he explains with military precision as he urges her to make a quick
decision.
<p>
   As if to make up for Kelly's small role (even though she is
supposed to be in a leadership position), she keeps turning up in
places an unarmed and untrained woman never ought to be, like in
the street chasing a terrorist attached to a nuclear weapon. Also,
at moments when Devoe and his he-men SWAT team types are suddenly
at sea  &MD;  duh, which way did he go?  &MD;  the camera likes to creep up
for a slow closeup on Kelly's plucky, hard-thinking face.
<p>
   We wait for the lightbulb to appear over her head and a cartoon
balloon to say in block letters, ``I've got it!'' Her analytical
insights, of course, send the he-men in the right direction. But
mostly, I kept thinking, Doris Day as a nuclear physicist?
<p>
   The script by Michael Schiffer (``Crimson Tide''), based on an
article by journalists Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, was clearly
painstakingly researched. There are indeed Russian mafiosos in the
nuclear arms business and there are also, it is reported, rogue
Russian military personnel.
<p>
   But at times the movie seems overly complicated as if simply
adding more events would somehow magnify and certify the film's
importance, its weight and its seriousness.
<p>
   All of this is thrown under the unsteady direction of Mimi
Leder, an Emmy-winning director and producer of Clooney's TV show,
``ER.'' She begins by throwing us into the workings of the
hijacking, the plot of which is not explained until later. Two
speeding trains are involved, as well as troops and guns. Most of
the footage is extremely dark and it's tough to tell which train is
which and what on earth is going on.
<p>
   The chief terrorist is played nicely with war-weary desperation
by Marcel Iures, a Romanian actor with the sucked-in cheeks and
ennui of a Jeremy Irons. To add depth to his character, we learn,
when he's not threatening the safety of civilians with nuclear
fallout, he is a pretty good piano teacher.
<p>
   But my favorite moment in this movie is when Clooney, bursting
into the terrorist's hotel room moments after the guy has left,
sticks his finger into a greasy sunny-side-up and declaims, ``It's
still warm!'' a signal that the Special Forces Unit with him can
still catch the perp if they hurry.
<p>
   Now that's what I call military intelligence.

<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Carpenter
Technology Corp. agreed to buy Talley Industries Inc. for $312
million in cash and assumed debt to get Talley's stainless steel
production and distribution operations.
<p>
   A dissident group of Talley shareholders objected, saying the
offer was inadequate and that Carpenter was ``bottom fishing'' for
a cheap acquisition.
<p>
   Carpenter offered $12 a share for Talley's common shares, $11.70
a share for its series A preferred and $16 for series B preferred.
The cash portion of the transaction is about $185 million. The $12
offer is 30 percent more than Talley's average share price over the
last three months.
<p>
   Carpenter will borrow money and issue short-term debt to pay for
the shares. The company added that after the transaction, it would
issue $100 million in common stock to raise money to pay off the
debt.
<p>
   Moody's Investors Service said it may reduce its `A3' rating on
Carpenter's senior unsecured debt if the transaction occurs. It
also said the `B2' rating on Talley's senior unsecured debt may be
raised.
<p>
   Carpenter wants Talley's stainless steel production and
distribution businesses, which already are suppliers to it. ``Our
five-year outlook required us to seek out more manufacturing
capacity,'' said Robert Cardy, Carpenter's chairman and chief
executive.
<p>
   The acquisition will hurt its earnings in the current fiscal
year ending June 30, 1998, but will help earnings in subsequent
years, Carpenter said.
<p>
   Talley shares rose 1 1/8 to 12 9/16 in late trading of 1.1
million shares, 28 times their three-month average daily volume.
Carpenter shares rose 3/4 to 47 1/16.
<p>
   Talley said the offer represents ``an attractive premium'' over
its average stock price in the last several years. But a dissident
group of Talley shareholders called the offer inadequate.
<p>
   ``The breakup value of the company, we believe, is significantly
higher,'' said William Danzell, a leader of the dissident
shareholders, who control 10.3 percent of Talley's common stock.
<p>
   Danzell said his group will oppose Carpenter's bid. The group
forced Talley's former chief executive, William Mallender, to
resign in June.
<p>
   In its statement, Carpenter said a majority of Talley's shares
must be pledged in favor of its offer by Oct. 30 for the
transaction to proceed.
<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania-based Carpenter makes stainless steel and
titanium alloys. Its revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 was
$939 million. Talley's stainless steel production and distribution
businesses generated $136.3 million of its total $502.7 million in
revenue last year.
<p>
   Talley, based in Phoenix, also makes inflation devices for air
bags, welding equipment and power supply systems, and provides
engineering advice to shipbuilders. In a statement, Carpenter said
those businesses would be sold after the acquisition is completed.
Credit Suisse First Boston would help find buyers, the company
said.
<p>
   Carpenter added it expects its earnings per share for the fiscal
first quarter ending Sept. 30 to be between 75 cents and 80 cents,
in line with analysts' expectations. For the same quarter last
year, the earnings per share totaled 45 cents.

<p>
   Southfield, Michigan, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal-Mogul
Corp. offered to buy U.K. auto-parts maker T&AMP;N Plc for about $2.4
billion in cash and assumed debt, expanding its global reach and
gaining the ability to deliver the more compete engine systems that
automakers demand to cut costs.
<p>
   The offer of $3.78 a share, or about $2.0 billion, represents a
premium of 29 percent over T&AMP;N's closing price yesterday. The stock
closed in London up 60.5 pence to 242.5 pence, or about $3.90 a
share, indicating investors expect Federal-Mogul will have to bid
more. The purchase would give Southfield, Michigan-based
Federal-Mogul, the world's largest maker of bearings and bushings,
access to T&AMP;N's other engine components. It's the latest in a
series of consolidations driven by automaker demands that suppliers
ship full systems, not just individual parts, to cut assembly
costs.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, a Salomon Brothers analyst. ``In one fell swoop they could
accomplish a lot in terms of getting toward their goal.'' T&AMP;N
announced the bid to the London Stock Exchange earlier today but
declined further comment. Federal-Mogul shares rose 3 15/16 to 37
7/16 in late trading. The purchase of T&AMP;N, which had $3.0 billion
in revenue in 1996, would raise Federal-Mogul's earnings and is ``a
great fit for us,'' Federal-Mogul spokeswoman Kimberly Welch said.
<p>
   In one example of how the company could deliver a more complete
system, Welch said Federal-Mogul's own bearings could be used in
engines that also use T&AMP;N's pistons and cam shafts. Welch wouldn't
comment on whether Federal-Mogul will end up raising its bid
because of today's rise in T&AMP;N's share price. ``I'm sure that has
been thought through,'' she said.
<p>
   Federal-Mogul's 1996 revenue was $2.03 billion. The company's
strategy to continue growth through acquisitions won't slow if it
purchases T&AMP;N, she said.
<p>
   Federal-Mogul began a restructuring shortly after Richard Snell
became its chief executive in November 1996, selling its retail
operations to focus on manufacturing, Welch said. the company took
a $204 million charge in the fourth quarter to pay for the
restructuring. The plan is about two-thirds complete, she said.
<p>
   T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of asbestos, has been
vulnerable to a bid since it took a $596.8 million charge last year
to insulate it against future liability from asbestos litigation,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around $4.19 a share, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto-parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it is considering the bid with its adviser, N M
Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.

 &UR; COOPERS' HANSON SEES MORE HOTEL MERGERS: BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lodging industry mergers and
acquisitions have more than doubled to $18.7 billion this year from
$8.8 billion, and show no signs of letting up in 1998, said Bjorn
Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP's lodging and gaming
group.
<p>
   Instead of the mega-mergers among such titans as Westin Hotels &AMP;
Resorts Co., Wyndham Hotel Corp. and Doubletree Corp. that have
occurred this year, Hanson said the next wave will be among smaller
companies trying to keep pace with the industry leaders.
<p>
   ``There will probably be more mergers than this year, but the
dollar value will be lower,'' Hanson told the Bloomberg Forum.
``We're running out of large companies left to be acquired.''
<p>
   Earlier this month, Starwood Lodging Trust agreed to buy Westin
for $1.6 billion, creating one of the largest hotel companies in
the world. That came a week after Doubletree Corp. and Promus Hotel
Corp. agreed to merge in a $2.14 billion stock swap.
<p>
   Other hotel transactions this year include Patriot American
Hospitality Inc.'s purchase of Wyndham Hotel Corp. for $1.1 billion
and Marriott International Inc.'s purchase of Renaissance Hotel
Group NV for $890 million.
<p>
   The wave of mergers and acquisitions come as the lodging
industry enjoys record profits stemming from a strong economy and a
rise in business and pleasure travel.
<p>
   This year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects the industry to post
combined profits of $14.5 billion. That compares with a loss of
$5.7 billion in 1991, when hoteliers suffered through the recession
and overbuilding from the 1980s.
<p>
   ``There are very few indications of any upcoming weakness in the
economy and this industry will continue to set record profits for
at least the next three years,'' said Hanson.
<p>
   While companies are enjoying high profits and rising stock
prices, the effect on consumers from these mergers is mixed.
<p>
   ``In the short run, we'll see expanded frequent guest programs,
but on the other hand we'll see rates continue to rise,'' he said.
<p>
   Coopers &AMP; Lybrand estimates the average daily room rate will
increase 6.1 percent this year to $74.29 a night from $70 last
year. Room rates are expected to reach $78.47 in 1998.
<p>
   To be sure, the specter of overbuilding is once again
threatening to derail the industry's progress.
<p>
   Developers will start construction of 127,500 rooms this year,
about 54 percent more than the 25-year average and the most since
1985, when 156,000 rooms were started. And for the first time since
the 1980s, full service hotels offering dining, conference rooms
and other amenities are being developed.
<p>
   ``I keep hearing reports it's all limited service hotels being
built but that's not the case,'' he said. ``The largest jump in new
construction is in upscale hotels.''
<p>
   The fresh supply won't likely start to hurt occupancy rates and
cut into the ability of hotel owners to raise rents until at least
1999, Hanson said.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- It was easy to overlook the
accomplishments of Alex English, who from 1980 to 1990 scored more
points than any player in the National Basketball Association.
<p>
   The decade was defined by superstars Magic Johnson and Larry
Bird, whose fierce personal rivalry overshadowed almost everything
else, including English, a quiet superstar playing in media-starved
Denver.
<p>
   ``I didn't get as much publicity as I would have gotten in a New
York, Los Angeles or Chicago, but I kind of enjoyed the relative
anonymity,'' said English, who'll be inducted into the Basketball
Hall of Fame on Monday. ``I enjoyed playing basketball and that's
all that mattered to me at the time.''
<p>
   Also being inducted are former Princeton University coach Pete
Carril and longtime University of Texas-El Paso coach Don Haskins.
<p>
   Joining them are a pair of female players -- UCLA All-American
Denise Curry and Amateur Athletic Union star Joan Crawford -- as
well as 12-year NBA veteran Bailey Howell from the veterans
committee and Spanish coaching legend Antonio Diaz-Miguel.
<p>
   Recently, English has learned well what a lack of media exposure
can do to a player -- even one with impeccable credentials. Unlike
Johnson and Bird, the NBA excluded him from its list of the 50
greatest players of all time, released last year in conjunction
with the league's golden anniversary.
<p>
   ``I felt very slighted by it,'' said English, the first player
in NBA history to score 2,000 points in eight straight seasons. ``I
think the real fans know and understand my contribution to the
game.''
<p>
   His contributions began long ago.
<p>
   At Dreher High School in Columbia, South Carolina, English was a
three-time All-State selection and led the team to a 50-5 record
over his final two years. He then attended the University of South
Carolina, where he remains the only player in school history to
start every game for four years.
<p>
   After brief stints with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana
Pacers, English joined the Nuggets in 1980. His up-tempo style,
like his low-key demeanor, was a perfect fit for the city.
<p>
   ``It meshed well with Denver,'' said English, who retired in
1991 after leading the Nuggets to nine straight playoff
appearances. ``I remember myself blending into the game and doing
what it took to win.''
<p>
   For English, that usually meant scoring, one of his former
teammates said.
<p>
   ``He was just unbelievable on the offensive end,'' said Bill
Hanzlik, entering his first season as Denver's head coach. ``Alex,
obviously, is one of the best of all time.''
<p>
   The numbers back him up.
<p>
   English, an eight-time All-Star selection, ranks ninth all-time
in NBA scoring with more than 25,000 points. The forward also set
31 records during his stay with the Nuggets, who retired his
jersey, No. 2, in 1993.
<p>
   ``He's very appreciated in Denver,'' said Hanzlik, who nicknamed
English ``Junior'' because of his 6-foot-7, 190-pound frame.
``Nationally, obviously, he's maybe a little unnoticed.''
<p>
   English didn't do anything to change that.
<p>
   Unlike many of today's players, who English said try a myriad of
things to draw attention to themselves, he was more of a team
player.
<p>
   ``The type of basketball that I played wasn't a lot of flash,''
said English, who remains close to the sport he loves as director
of Basketball City in New York, a private basketball center. ``I
never did that -- never would either.''
<p>
   If it cost him a spot on the 50 greatest players list, so be it,
English said.
<p>
   ``Nothing negative matters,'' he said. ``I've accomplished the
all-time achievement for basketball players and that's to be
immortalized in the Basketball Hall of Fame.''

   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Wheat fell to a two-month low
after Pakistan bought twice as much wheat from Australia as from
the U.S., signaling rising competition on the world market.
<p>
   Pakistan purchased 400,000 metric tons of Australian wheat and
only 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat in a tender yesterday,
according to a U.S.-based official of the Australian Wheat Board.
Speculation also swept the market that Egypt, one of the world's
biggest wheat importers, could soon buy French wheat.
<p>
   Competition is increasing on the world market as the European
Union, collectively the world's largest exporter, completed its
harvest. Also, supplies from Australia, the world's fourth-largest
exporter, are more plentiful than expected after rain revived dry
crops.
<p>
   ``The main reason for the weakness in the market is the Pakistan
tender,'' said Paul Koltek, a wheat trader at United Grain Corp., a
Portland, Oregon-based wheat exporting firm. ``The trade in general
anticipated there would be a lot more done from the U.S.''
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$3.5725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the contract's
lowest price since July 21.
<p>
   With new supplies, the European Union yesterday raised its
subsidies on wheat exports to 4.89 European currency units ($5.43)
a ton, or 15 cents a bushel, on 115,000 metric tons of wheat. A
week earlier the subsidy was 2.98 Ecu a ton.
<p>
   Corn and soybeans slid as tropical storm Nora brought less rain
than expected to the U.S. Southwest, reducing concern that harvests
would be delayed. The remnants of the storm had been expected to
bring rain to the Midwest early next week, keeping farmers from
collecting crops.
<p>
   Corn for December delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.575 a bushel on the CBOT, while November soybeans fell to
$6.3175 a bushel, down 2.75 cents or 0.4 percent.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Nearly five years after the United States last
exploded an atomic bomb, the Senate is girding for a fight over
President Clinton's decision to seek ratification of a treaty that
permanently bans nuclear weapons testing.
<p>
   Clinton told the U.N. General Assembly last week that the treaty
is ``the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in the history of
arms control.'' Although he signed the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty a year ago, the president has delayed sending it to the
Senate, in part because lawmakers have been cool to the idea.
<p>
   Just how cool was underscored last year when 53 senators voted
against legislation to resume testing. That margin was 14 votes shy
of the 67 votes that would be required for ratification of a treaty
banning testing once and for all.
<p>
   Arms control advocates say the Clinton administration has much
work ahead to win Senate approval. Hearings on the pact are
expected this fall, but the ratification vote won't come until next
spring.
<p>
   ``There is substantial opposition to it,'' acknowledged Spurgeon
Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, a private arms
control group in Washington, D.C. ``At the moment, prospects look
difficult.''
<p>
   John Parachini, a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson
Center, a think tank specializing in national security issues,
predicted that most of the 45 Senate Democrats would vote to
approve the treaty. If all Democrats supported the pact, the treaty
would need 22 Republican votes to be ratified.
<p>
   ``The key is that the Clinton administration must make this a
priority,'' Parachini said. ``Unless they get serious, even
Democrats won't take them seriously. Ratification will be a
fight.''
<p>
   Some Democrats have given their qualified support.
<p>
   ``This treaty will pinch,'' said Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., the
ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. ``It will
hurt. But the treaty will pinch other countries far more than it
pinches us, and the world will be a safer place.''
<p>
   Earlier this year, the Clinton administration won Senate
ratification of another arms control pact  &MD;  a treaty banning
production and use of chemical weapons  &MD;  only when Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., threw his support behind it at the 11th
hour. The Senate ratified the treaty, 74-26, in April.
<p>
   An international ban on all nuclear tests has been a goal of
American presidents dating back to Dwight D. Eisenhower. John F.
Kennedy signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, the first arms
limitation of the nuclear era. That treaty banned nuclear test
blasts in the atmosphere, in space and underwater but permitted
them underground.
<p>
   A subsequent treaty in 1974 set a size limit on underground
blasts. The treaty Clinton is forwarding to the Senate would ban
all forms of test blasts.
<p>
   The United States hasn't exploded a nuclear bomb since 1992.
<p>
   At present, 146 countries have signed the treaty, but India and
Pakistan  &MD;  long-time adversaries suspected of having nuclear
weapons  &MD;  have not. Eight of the 146 have ratified the treaty.
<p>
   The terms of the debate have changed little over the decades.
<p>
   Backers of the treaty contend that it will slow the development
of even more destructive nuclear weapons and dissuade Third World
nations from seeking to acquire nuclear arsenals.
<p>
   Detractors argue that the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile
would become a useless deterrent because scientists won't be able
to conduct test blasts to ensure the weapons work. Treaty foes also
contend that verifying compliance by other nations will be
difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
   The Republican party opposed the test ban in its 1996 platform,
saying the proposed pact ``is inconsistent with American security
interests.'' The platform stressed the need for continued
``development of nuclear weapons and their periodic testing'' to
deter potential adversaries around the world.
<p>
   The Clinton administration counters that in lieu of conducting
actual nuclear blasts, government scientists would be able to
conduct ``virtual weapons tests'' using supercomputers and high
explosives to ensure aging nuclear weapons will work if ever
needed.
<p>
   The first stop on the road to ratification will be Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,
whose panel is responsible for reviewing treaties.
<p>
   Helms hasn't publicly taken a position on the pact. Marc
Thiessen, a spokesman for Helms' committee, said many senators
``have a lot of concern'' about the treaty. He said the committee
won't start the ratification process until spring.
<p>
   Other hurdles for the administration will be convincing Lott and
members of the Armed Services Committee, chaired by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., and the Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired
by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. The two panels also will review the
treaty.

   Thurmond has ``consistently expressed concerns about whether or
not it is feasible or safe to test the nuclear stockpile using
anything other than the traditional tests,'' said John DeCrosta,
the senator's spokesman.
<p>
   An aide for Shelby said the senator hasn't taken a position.
``He's keeping an open mind and has a lot of questions about it,''
the aide said.

   Almost certain to fuel the opposition is the unresolved question
of whether Russia set off a nuclear bomb in a remote Arctic region
in August.
<p>
   The Pentagon called the incident ``a seismic event with
explosive characteristics.'' A State Department official told
reporters that the event did not appear to have been an earthquake.
<p>
   Russia announced a moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992.
<p>
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' said Frank Gaffney, director of
the Center for Security Policy, a private think tank here. ``Either
this was an event that demonstrates the `unverifiability' of the
treaty, or this treaty is verifiable and the administration should
be able to determine this was or was not a nuclear test.''

   Brantford, Ontario, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- No one knows the
Zamboni like Frank Zamboni.
<p>
   The machine lumbers around the hockey rink between periods,
changing a rutted, chopped-up surface to a glistening new one. Even
as it approaches its 50th birthday, many hockey fans don't know how
it works.
<p>
   Zamboni, whose grandfather invented the machine in 1948,
understands the wonder.
<p>
   ``It makes it look sparkling new, magically new,'' said Zamboni,
vice president of family-owned Frank J. Zamboni &AMP; Co. ``It's very
few people who actually know what the inner workings of the machine
are.''
<p>
   There's no magic. Razor-sharp blades scrape the surface, and the
shavings are mixed with water and a ``conditioner'' that smoothes
the ice, he said. The mixture is heated and spread on the ice
behind the Zamboni.
<p>
   The Zamboni was invented in 1948 by Frank J. Zamboni, who owned
an icehouse in Paramount, California. When sales of ice to dairy
farmers in the 1930s began to slow, he built an ice rink across the
street.
<p>
   In 1942, he began to experiment and after several years of
adjustments, Zamboni's machine worked.
<p>
   ``My grandfather kept tinkering with it,'' said Zamboni from the
company's plant in Brantford, Ontario, which also is Wayne
Gretzky's hometown. He finally perfected it in 1948 and started the
company a year later.
<p>
   Now the machines run from US$5,000 for a tractor-pulled model
(without the tractor) to $120,000 for a extra-wide model for
speed-skating rinks, Zamboni said. The company has sold 6,000 of
them through the years.
<p>
   ``Our company has gone through up and down cycles and is
currently in an up-cycle,'' Zamboni said, ``especially because of
the number of rinks being built in the United States right now.''
<p>
   Zamboni said his company controls more than three-quarters of
the market, employs about 60 workers and has factories in Brantford
and Paramount.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  On the eve of two gay events in San Francisco,
activists have launched a campaign to give away 1 million condoms
in an effort to reverse climbing gonorrhea rates  &MD;  and avert a
rebound in AIDS cases.
<p>
   ``Beginning this week, gay and bisexual men in San Francisco
will have easier access to free condoms than ever before,'' said
Steve Gibson of the Stop AIDS Project.
<p>
   With thousands of gay men expected to join the celebration of
the raucous Folsom Street Fair on Sunday and the Castro Street Fair
the following Sunday, activists are going door-to-door to
distribute condoms to 67 gay bars, clubs and businesses in San
Francisco.
<p>
   The free condoms are paid for by a $150,000 grant from the San
Francisco Health Department's AIDS Office, created at the urging of
gay Supervisors Leslie Katz and Tom Ammiano.
<p>
   Gay tourists flood bars, clubs, restaurants and stores in late
September and early October for the two gay events, according to
Robert Perez of the Stop AIDS Project.
<p>
   The festivities come on the heels of a disturbing new finding by
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the
number of gay men diagnosed with gonorrhea has increased in San
Francisco and several other U.S. cities, raising concerns that HIV
may also be on the rise.
<p>
   Between 1994 to 1995, the number of gay men with gonorrhea in a
sampled San Francisco clinic increased 24 percent, from 271 to 336,
according to the CDC study.
<p>
   The study linked rising gonorrhea rates with attendance at
specific sex clubs and other places frequented by gay men in San
Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
<p>
   Cases have also climbed in those cities, as well as in Honolulu,
San Diego, Denver and Long Beach, Calif.
<p>
   This is a far cry from the rampant levels of sexually
transmitted disease reported in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
before safe sex practices became commonplace.
<p>
   In 1980, a total of 5,100 cases of rectal gonorrhea were
reported in San Francisco.
<p>
   Gonorrhea infections are considered a sentinel of the spread of
the HIV virus, which leads to AIDS. The same unsafe sex practices
that transmit gonorrhea also spread HIV.
<p>
   Because rates of the human immunodeficiency virus are less
easily monitored than rates of gonorrhea, because of
confidentiality concerns, epidemiologists watch gonorrhea trends
for evidence of a rebound in the HIV epidemic.
<p>
   In recent years, new HIV infections have plateaued. In 1996, San
Francisco had roughly 500 new HIV infections, down from about 950
annually five years ago.
<p>
   San Francisco's Stop AIDS Project has been distributing condoms,
on a limited basis, for three years. But the new ``Condoms Now!''
program seeks much wider distribution of condoms in bars and clubs
catering to high-risk gays.
<p>
   In addition, the city distributes about 165,000 free condoms at
health clinics, schools and needle exchange sites.
<p>
   San Francisco's estimated dozen public commercial sex clubs are
not included in the giveaway campaign because they already
distribute condoms, as required by law.

   DEARBORN, Mich.  &MD;  One of Detroit's most influential auto
designers of recent times is retiring, and the Ford Motor Co. will
hand over his responsibilities to a young designer whom many
consider one of the world's most promising up-and-comers.
<p>
   Jack Telnack, 60, Ford's vice president for global design since
1987 and a designer at the company for nearly 40 years, will leave
Ford at year-end.
<p>
   He is credited with the acclaimed design of the original 1986
Taurus, which helped to rescue the then-struggling company and
established a trend toward sleek, aerodynamic styling that has been
widely copied in the industry.
<p>
   His replacement as of Oct. 1 will be J.C. Mays, 42. Mays is
credited with creating the Volkswagen Concept 1, the prototype for
the revived Volkswagen Beetle that will go on sale early next year.
<p>
   An American, Mays studied in the design studios of Europe. Most
recently, he was vice president for design development at SHR
Perceptual Management, a Scottsdale, Ariz., design consulting firm
that has worked with Ford.
<p>
   Previously, he was a design director for Audi in Germany and
chief designer at Volkswagen of America's design center in
California, where he worked on the Concept 1. He was also a senior
designer in Germany for BMW.
<p>
   Mays will step into some big shoes. Telnack joined Ford in 1958
and worked with the team that created the Mustang in 1964. He later
had a hand in the toned-down, clean-looking 1983 Thunderbird. But
the 1986 Ford Taurus is the car with which he will forever be
associated. At the time, the Taurus's aerodynamic shape was a
breakthrough in a market filled with boxy, hard-edged cars.
<p>
   In recent years, however, Ford is seen as having lost its design
leadership to the Chrysler Corp., which has sought inspiration from
classic cars. Trying to regain the title, Ford has experimented
with a design form advanced by Telnack known as New Edge, which
creates ``surface tension'' by adding creases to soft aerodynamic
shapes.
<p>
   The small Ford Ka, sold in Europe, is an example, and the most
recent rendition is the Mercury MC2 concept car, the basis of the
next-generation Mercury Cougar.
<p>
   Mays's task at Ford, where he will oversee a staff of 1,000
people in seven studios worldwide, is to strengthen Ford's brand
identities through design. Ford is working to make its brands more
distinctive; Mercury, in particular, is seen as lacking a clear
image, and Lincoln is struggling to appeal to younger buyers.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Silver rose to a four-month
high as strong demand from investors and manufacturers in Europe
contributed to a decline in exchange stockpiles
<p>
   Silver inventories in warehouses monitored by the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.2 million troy ounces,
or 0.9 percent, to 141.4 million ounces, the exchange said after
trading yesterday. Comex silver stockpiles have fallen 30 percent
since the first of June, the result of strong demand in both Europe
and the U.S.
<p>
   Demand for silver and other precious metals is rising, in part,
as jewelers step up production to fill orders from retailers for
the end-of-year gift-giving season in North America and Europe.
<p>
   ``Inventories are dropping, and that's sending prices higher,''
said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New
York. ``The silver is heading to London, as there is supply
tightness in Europe, (where) there is both industrial and
investment demand.''
<p>
   Silver for December delivery rose 3.7 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$4.822 an ounce on the Comex, the highest price since May 29.
December gold was little changed at $329 ounce, down 50 cents.
<p>
   Elsewhere, platinum for October delivery fell $3.70, or 0.9
percent, to $427.70 an ounce on the Nymex; while December palladium
was little changed at $193 an ounce, up 20 cents.

 &UR; CANADA BONDS RALLY AS REPORTS AFFIRM GROWTH WITHOUT INFLATION &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian bonds rose third
straight week after reports indicating both the Canadian and U.S.
economies are growing at a non-inflationary pace bolstered demand
for fixed-income issues.
<p>
   Prices for industrial goods rose 0.7 percent last month, while
raw materials prices slipped 0.1 percent, confirming for traders
that manufacturers' costs aren't about to push up prices for
consumer goods and services.
<p>
   At the same time, the Commerce Department said its final
accounting of second quarter U.S. growth was 3.3 percent, less than
economists' estimate of 3.6 percent, while the price deflator -- an
important measure of inflation -- rose at a 1.8-percent pace.
<p>
   Together, the reports confirmed that both countries economies
are growing at a pace that isn't stoking inflation.
<p>
   ``The big story for the market is on the inflation front
--prices are still quite low,'' said David Yu, a principal at
Perigee Investment Counsel Inc., who manages C$2.5 billion (US$1.8
billion) of bonds. ``Growth is strong, you can see it around you,
but costs aren't being passed on to consumers.''
<p>
   Canada's benchmark 30-year, 8 percent bond rose C$0.84 to
C$123.22, sending the yield 5 basis points lower to 6.27 percent.
On Wednesday, the benchmark bond's yield slid 9 basis points to
6.26 percent -- its lowest ever. Yesterday, the yield retreated on
concern that inflation is picking up.
<p>
   Bonds posted their largest one-day drop in eight weeks yesterday
after a series of U.S. reports revived speculation that the Federal
Reserve may raise lending rates soon to slow the U.S. economy,
prompting Canada's central bank to raise its own benchmark rate to
keep Canadian securities competitive.
<p>
   That view changed today after the reports confirmed that prices
aren't rising. Bond investors prefer moderate growth without
inflation, because rising consumer prices erodes the fixed value of
debt securities.
<p>
   Even without inflation, traders are bracing for a quarter-point
increase in lending rates because of concern strong growth will
eventually lead to higher prices if left unchecked.
<p>
   The central bank raised its benchmark rate in June a quarter
point to 3.5 percent to bolster the Canadian currency. The Federal
Reserve raised its similar benchmark rate in March to 5.5 percent
to temper growth and keep inflation from rising.
<p>
   While most market watchers don't anticipate the Fed will raise
rates at its policy meeting Tuesday, traders are still undecided
about whether Fed governors will vote to lift rates at their Nov.
12 meeting to keep inflation at bay.
<p>
   ``I think (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan and his colleagues would
have warned the market by now if they had planned a September rate
increase,'' said David Rosenberg, a senior economist at investment
dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc. ``It's still a little early to conclude
they won't raise rates in November.''
<p>
   Rising U.S. rates put pressure on the Bank of Canada to
implement a similar move to keep the 2-percentage-point gap between
Canadian and U.S. official rates from widening. Higher U.S. rates
also directly affect the Canadian economy, damping U.S. demand for
Canadian goods. As much as 85 percent of Canadian goods are
destined for U.S. consumption.
<p>
   Among other issues, the 10-year, 7.25 percent bond's yield fell
4 basis points to 5.72 percent. The yield on the five-year, 7
percent issue fell 3 basis points to 5.10 percent.
<p>
   The Canadian dollar recently traded at 72.20 U.S. cents, down
from yesterday's close of 72.30 U.S. cents. It has risen more than
half a cent in the past week.
<p>
   ``It's been a roller coaster ride this week,'' Yu said. He
didn't buy or sell government securities this week, though he still
sees potential for good returns on long-term issues.
<p>
   This week, bonds rose, fell, then rose again as traders debated
whether growth is threatening to bolster consumer prices.
<p>
   Even so, total returns on Canadian bonds are again the best in
the world. To date, Canadian bonds have posted a total return of
7.38 percent in Canadian dollar terms, slightly above the 7-percent
total return in the U.S. debt market. Traders are now turning their
attention to next week's manufacturing and gross domestic product
reports in Canada and U.S. releases on consumer confidence,
manufacturing and jobs for more insight into the strength of both
economies.
<p>
   U.S. government bonds rose, with the U.S. 30-year bond's yield
at 6.36 percent, 9 basis points above its Canadian counterpart.
Canada's 30-year benchmark bond hasn't yielded more than its U.S.
equivalent since July 29.
<p>
   In the money market, Canada's three-month treasury bill's yield
rose to 2.92 percent from 2.90 percent, according to a composite of
dealer yields by Bloomberg. Six-month bills were unchanged at 3.53
percent, while the yield on one-year bills fell to 4.11 percent
from 4.16 percent.

   Seattle, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. said it sold four
757 jetliners to Icelandair, an order valued at $272 million before
discounts.
<p>
   The first aircraft will be delivered in the first quarter of
next year, and the last one will arrive in 2002. Icelandair will
use the planes for flights to Europe and the U.S., Boeing said.
<p>
   Icelandair ordered two 757-200s, which are single-aisle,
twin-engine aircraft that carry about 190 passengers. The airline
also ordered two of Boeing's 757-300s, a new version of the 757-200
that is stretched to hold about 230 passengers.
<p>
   Neither company would reveal the terms of the order. The planes
carry a list price of $272 million, though volume buyers rarely pay
full price.
<p>
   Closely held Icelandair already operates Boeing 737 and 757
aircraft.
<p>
   Including Icelandair's orders, Seattle-based Boeing has sold 330
aircraft so far this year, including 10 from Douglas Aircraft Co.,
which it acquired when it bought McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $16.3
billion in stock this summer. Boeing's shares were up 1/4 at 54 1/2
in late trading.
<p>
   Boeing sold 717 aircraft in 1996.

<p>
   NEW CANAAN, CONN.  &MD;  Maybe you grew up watching him on ``Mutual
of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.''
<p>
   Maybe you've caught him more recently on NBC's ``Today'' show,
as he manhandles a large bear cub or, just last week, a shark that
wouldn't stay in the tank.
<p>
     Or perhaps you saw him the memorable evening years ago when
he brought a 2,000-pound water buffalo on the ``Tonight Show'' with
Johnny Carson.
<p>
   You know, the animal guy. Jim Fowler. 
<p>
   Even though ``Wild Kingdom'' is gone, the pop culture spoof of
it endures. Based on a Carson joke, the gag has Marlin Perkins
sitting safely in a vehicle, saying, ``I'll wait here in the Jeep
while Jim wrestles the crocodile ...''
<p>
   And at 6 foot 6, perpetually dressed in safari gear  &MD;  whether
actually on safari, appearing in a Manhattan TV studio, or even
when greeting guests at his rustic home in Connecticut  &MD;  Fowler is
hard to miss. (``It reduces the cost of my wardrobe,'' he says.)
<p>
   Fowler, 67, has spent a lifetime with animals. He grew up the
son of a soil scientist in Georgia; his goal, he says, is to help
others feel as close to nature as he always has.
<p>
   But contrary to the nonconfrontational approach advocated by
most naturalists who say that being brave in the face of wild
animals is asking for trouble, Fowler takes pride in his hands-on
encounters with wild beasts.
<p>
   And he is more than happy to talk about them. In his version of
himself, he is a veritable Jim of the Jungle. He tells of how he
had his arm swallowed up to the shoulder by a 300-pound anaconda in
the Venezuelan jungle. (The 22-foot constrictor did eventually let
go, though Fowler was unable to move that limb for days.)
<p>
   He tells of having been charged by 200 elephants in the Okavango
delta in Botswana. Here, he says, bluffing the pack of pachyderms
bought enough time for Fowler and his crew to leap into their Land
Rover. Fowler laughs that they not only had to abandon a $40,000
camera, but they all literally jumped out of their shoes in the
quicksand-like mud.
<p>
   There was the copter crash in the Peruvian Andes, which led to a
long, painful march out of the jungle. The face-off with an African
lion, in which, Fowler attests, the big male backed off when Fowler
roared at him. The tussle with a wild wolf in Alaska.
<p>
   Fowler wears scars of cheetah scratches and he has lost a finger
tip to a crocodile.
<p>
   TV audiences eat up these romps, but there is no question that
the way in which he cavorts with wild animals makes him a
controversial figure in naturalist circles. There are those who say
he gives viewers the wrong impression about ferocious animals,
suggesting  &MD;  by his actions, not his words  &MD;  that they can be as
manageable as cuddly toys.
<p>
   Many animal welfare groups say it's not humane to introduce wild
animals to the stresses of a television studio or a hotel banquet
room, with their loud noises, slippery floors, and bright lights.
(In the interest of full disclosure, this writer struggled with
these issues when appearing on the ``Rosie O'Donnell'' show with
big cat cubs.) 
<p>
   On that point, Fowler speaks with some anger about having
squared off against two towering figures from the world of wildlife
scientists  &MD;  Jane Goodall, the world-renowned chimpanzee expert,
and George B. Schaller, the world's most respected field
biologist. 
<p>
   In contrast to the opinions of Goodall and Schaller, Fowler
maintains that displaying live animals on TV or in front of an
audience makes ``connections for people'' who rarely have the
opportunity to interact with nature. ``The real challenge today,''
he says, ``is to affect the public's attitude and make them care.
Scientists often miss the point.'' He believes this is the way to
spur the public into action in an age of horrendous habitat loss
and constant extinctions.
<p>
   In return, Fowler dispenses harsh criticism for those who
``spend 20 years in the forest doing research'' without surfacing
to deal with society. He says Goodall ``has done a lot of good,''
but claims she could do more to connect with the government of
Tanzania and people everywhere  &MD;  this despite the fact that her
tireless efforts to spread awareness of the plight of the
chimpanzee are a matter of record.
<p>
   But Fowler doesn't stop there in the battle of popularism vs.
purity. He also takes on the huge conservation group, the World
Wildlife Fund saying they don't help people understand how the
natural world relates to them. He sees President Bill Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore as leaders who shrink back from giving a
global message of conservation. He says they ought to make people
aware that we should care about the rainforests of South America
because they directly influence our own climate. We must make
conservation a matter self-interest, he says.
<p>
   Some of Fowler's statements place him outside the most respected
circles of the conservation world.
<p>
   But he stands firm.
<p>
   The only way to promote conservation, Fowler maintains, is to
ask ``What are the benefits to human beings? We are the greatest
exploiters the world has known. What's in it for us? What's in it
for someone who is trying to make a living and feed his family? We
need to make arguments for saving wildlife by how it will benefit
us.''
<p>
   Whether displaying animals on TV or expounding on his views,
Fowler's style is sure to simultaneously please fans and ruffle
feathers.

SUVS AREN'T TOO BIG; THE CARS ARE TOO TINY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Can somebody please resurrect the Cold War? Bring back the Red
Menace? Renovate the Russky threat? Life was a lot simpler in this
country when the government knew who the enemy was  &MD;  and it wasn't
us.
<p>
   Wednesday of this week, The New York Times devoted a significant
piece of news real estate to expounding on the new threat to the
peace and well-being of the American people: The Sport/Utility! The
Times has dutifully reported what the government has discovered, no
doubt after exhaustive (and expensive) study and hours of committee
meetings, and what anybody over 6 with an IQ slightly larger than
their shoe size could have figured out instantly: When big things
hit small things, the small things get the worse of it.
<p>
   Actually, it was a well-written piece, packed with information
and quotes, and a must-read for anyone who owns a car, but
especially those who own sport/utilities, hereinafter referred to
as SUVs. You'll get an idea what's in store if somebody doesn't get
a handle on the antifun lobby. Handle? Chains, please.
<p>
   The current anticar thinking seems to be that big SUVs hurt
little cars mightily when they collide, so we should (a) alter SUVS
so that won't happen  &MD;  which probably calls for repealing the laws
of physics; (b) ban SUVs; (c) regulate SUVs out of showrooms and
off the streets.
<p>
   All right, readers, I ask this question: Are SUVs too big or are
cars getting too small, too tinny, too insubstantial?
<p>
   The federal government decided to regulate fuel consumption,
something the market would have accomplished without federal help;
Americans are not stupid, no matter what your government would have
you believe. But the feds determined that cars would instantly be
fuel efficient. That translates to lighter and smaller because
weight and size  &MD;  size determines wind resistance  &MD;  consume fuel.
It also led to small cars without heavy frames  &MD;  so-called
monocoque construction. SUVs, for the most part, are built on
frames.
<p>
   So, cars contain plastics (made from oil) in abundance, aluminum
(more expensive than steel, lighter but not as tough in a crash)  &MD; 
cars these days contain almost anything you can name, except a
6-foot, 3-inch human. Even the so-called mid-size is a 4-passenger
for medium to small people.
<p>
   But, when the station wagon died, families could not lay off
children or downsize their bodies. Enter the minivan, a vehicle
that would hold adults, children, lots of stuff  &MD;  but not a lot of
weight. Minivans can't pull much of anything.
<p>
   While the Boys Within the Beltway, down in D.C. where
regulations are manufactured, were shoving little cars at us, they
were also  &MD;  in the name of fuel efficiency  &MD;  allowing bigger trucks
on the road. Your commuter car is as big as a 1950 doghouse, the
monster in your rear-view mirror is a truck the size and weight of
a five-story building laid horizontal on wheels, and you're
worrying about ... a Nissan Pathfinder?
<p>
   Not every SUV is a GMC Suburban  &MD;  and they don't fare well
against semis, either. But before we panic into allowing the BWB
eliminating what most Americans seem to want these days  &MD;  an SUV
tall enough to see the road, big enough to pull a boat, and roomy
enough for a grownup  &MD;  lets examine a few alternatives.
<p>
    &MD; Smaller trucks. I'm tired of sharing the road with behemoths
driven by overtired ``independent contractors.'' (That's a guy who
used to have a job but now has longer hours, a contract, and no
benefits.)
<p>
    &MD; Larger cars. SUVs aren't too big; cars are too small.
<p>
    &MD; Driver education. See last week's column  &MD;  improperly trained,
incompetent young drivers grow up to become incompetent adult
drivers given to road rage because nobody taught them any manners
or skills.
<p>
   The problem seems to be that the Boys Within the Beltway don't
have a clue what working stiffs need in a car. They need room and
comfort, not Big Brother in the passenger seat.
<p>
   You cannot legislate a perfect world. Life is a risk. Regulation
is certainly in order to eliminate peril created by business greed
 &MD;  at least as much as reasonably possible  &MD;  but we are regulating
away individual responsibility in the process of protecting
everybody from everything. Learn how to drive; stay out of
accidents.
<p>
   Meanwhile, if the BWB want to be helpful, give us back the
interurban trolleys, give us the fast reliable commuter trains
they're always blathering about, and do something about oversized
trucks.
<p>
   Oh yes, and while we're at it, how about issuing every
bureaucrat his/her own electric car and make them use it. That'll
give 'em a taste of reality. Meanwhile, go away and leave us alone.
<p>
   Sunday., Oct. 5, you have a couple of choices: Hit the road or
go see Bentley cars.
<p>
   That day is the annual Grand 44 road rally of the Touring Club
of New England. The rally is not a race but a time/distance
precision driving event in classes according to experience. Novices
are more than welcome.
<p>
   The first car is off at 11:31 from the Burger King, Route 38,
Tewksbury, Mass., for a 95-mile tour of glorious New England
countryside. Registration begins at 10:30 a.m., and the entry fee
is $20 for nonmembers, $15 for members of TCNE. For particulars,
telephone (978) 256-7285.
<p>
   That day also, the Museum of Transportation sponsors Bentley Day
 &MD;  actually it's a Bentley Hour and a Half. The cars will be on view
only from noon until 1:30 but what cars! Some 25 Bentleys were to
be shipped from England for the event in Brookline, Mass., and
joined by area Bentley and Rolls-Royce clubs. For information,
telephone the museum at (617) 522-6547.
<p>

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose with bonds on
a government report showing economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 51.33,
or 0.7 percent, to 7899.59.
<p>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 5.09, or 0.5 percent, to
943.00, led by banks and drug companies. Falling interest rates
boost demand for bank loans, while steady-growing companies such as
drugmakers are attractive when bond yields become less competitive.
<p>
   Even after today's rise, the Dow average was little changed for
the week, and 4.4 percent below its Aug. 6 record. Any further
gains depend on a bond market rally, investors said.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million money
management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis
points to 6.36 percent, about where it was on Monday. A 52-week low
of 6.30 percent was reached on July 31.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.98 to 1680.87, within a point
above where it began the week. Concern about slow sales at Lattice
Semiconductor Corp. and Xilinx Inc. and other specialty chipmakers
dragged the index lower.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 7/8 to 114, leading a bank rally. Chase
Manhattan Corp. gained 2 13/16 to 118 5/16 and First Chicago NBD
Corp. climbed 2 1/8 to 75 7/8.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after the government said the economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported, while
inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   Perhaps more than profits and interest rates, the strength of
the U.S. currency provides the best hint as to the path of stocks
in coming weeks and months, said Kenneth L. Fisher, president of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, California, with $1.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   U.S. stocks attracted foreign investors in the past year as the
dollar rose 16 percent against the German mark, the benchmark
currency for Europe. The Dow industrials climbed 35 percent in that
period, rising in tandem with the dollar 60 percent of the time.
The dollar and the Dow both peaked Aug. 6, and have since declined.
<p>
   Signs that Europe's economy is accelerating would weaken the
dollar and may signal the end of the past few years of big gains in
U.S. stocks; the Dow doubled in a 31-month period.
<p>
   ``The explanation in the weeks ahead will come out of keeping an
eye on the dollar,'' Fisher said.
<p>
   Fisher said he is sticking with international U.S. companies
such as DuPont Co. and Merck &AMP; Co., which receive the bulk of
international funds. If he sees signs of growth oversees, he would
load up on non-U.S. giants like Siemens AG and Sony Corp.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications surged as much as 6 1/2, or 41 percent,
to 23 1/2 amid strong first-day demand for the phone company
founded by cellular pioneer Craig McCaw.
<p>
   Lattice Semiconductor tumbled 3 3/4 to 65 5/8, leading the
decline in chipmakers as weak orders were seen hurting
third-quarter results. Xilinx dropped 1 7/16 to 49 7/8 and Altera
Corp. lost 1 1/2 to 53 1/2.
<p>
   Investors said that while they expect most companies to deliver
strong earnings, the results may not have enough punch to drive
stocks higher.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting that the current
quarter's earnings may be weaker than expected.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 9 7/16 to 24 1/16.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, fell
1/2 to 11 after saying it could report a loss for the fiscal second
quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the year-ago
period.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 7/8 to 57 11/16 after it said
third-quarter earnings will be about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected and
declined 13/16 to 19 3/8.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, fell 3 3/8 to 10 after warning
that it expects earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less
than the year-ago 51 cents a share because of production and
shipment delays.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 4
5/16 to 25 11/16 on renewed concern that its major customers are
suffering technical problems in building cutting-edge microchip
production tools that use Cymer's lasers. Cymer has fallen 43
percent in September.
<p>
   Eastman Kodak Co. rose 1 3/4 to 64 3/16 after announcing it will
fire about 10 percent of its clerical staff and 20 percent of its
managers in a move to boost profits.
<p>
   3M gained 2 1/2 to 90 5/16 after Cowen &AMP; Co. raised its
investment opinion from ``neutral'' to ``strong buy,'' citing
accelerating growth and improved margins.

<p>
   Princeton, New Jersey, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- For Pete Carril,
success on the basketball court has always been a product of those
around him.
<p>
   With that in mind on Monday, the man who made back-door lay-ups
and bow ties popular during his 29 years at Princeton University
will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
<p>
   ``No man is an island,'' Carril said. ``It's the kind of award
that you have to share.''
<p>
   He will.
<p>
   Carril said busloads of family, friends and well-wishers will
make the 230-mile trip from his hometown of Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, to Springfield, Massachusetts, basketball's
birthplace and home of the Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Carril, 69, said he fears losing his composure, something his
well-drilled teams rarely did.
<p>
   ``I don't think it'll hit until I'm there, and I hope it doesn't
hit too hard,'' said Carril, who resigned from Princeton before
last season. ``I don't want to be a crying fool up there.''
<p>
   Also being inducted Monday are former National Basketball
Association star Alex English and longtime University of Texas-El
Paso coach Don Haskins. With them are a pair of female players
--UCLA All-American Denise Curry and Amateur Athletic Union star
Joan Crawford -- as well as 12-year NBA veteran Bailey Howell from
the veterans committee and Spanish coaching legend Antonio
Diaz-Miguel.
<p>
   Yet much of the attention will focus on the raspy-voiced Carril,
who besides being coach, also was as a full-time counselor and
friend to his players.
<p>
   ``He's like a father or mentor to every single guy who played
for him,'' said Bill Carmody, Carril's successor at Princeton after
14 years as an assistant. ``They recognize what he did for them as
people.''
<p>
   On this day, Carril was back at the tree-lined Princeton campus,
where he and his protege spend a sunny summer day in the basketball
office, doodling X's and O's on the backboard.
<p>
   They've developed a special relationship, which explains why
Carmody is one of the few people who can see what the Hall of Fame
means to his predecessor.
<p>
   ``I've never seen real satisfaction in him,'' Carmody said.
``This is really special. I've never really seen this before.''
<p>
   While his off-the-court contributions are impossible to measure,
his record isn't.
<p>
   Carril, who spent one year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem
before taking over at Princeton in 1967, has a career coaching
record of 525-273, becoming the only Division I coach to win at
least 500 games without giving an athletic scholarship.
<p>
   His Princeton teams won 13 Ivy League titles and earned 13
postseason bids, including 11 NCAA tournament appearances. In 1975,
the Tigers won the Ivy League's only National Invitation Tournament
championship.
<p>
   The coach brought a blue-collar work ethic to the blue-blooded
Ivy League school.
<p>
   ``He's got all the attributes that all great coaches have,''
said former Princeton standout Geoff Petrie, now the vice president
of basketball operations for the National Basketball Association's
Sacramento Kings. ``He's a great teacher, he's got a tremendous
love for the game, and he's got the ability to motivate people.''
<p>
   After Princeton, Carril brought his decades of wisdom to
Sacramento, where he's about to enter his second season as an
assistant.
<p>
   Petrie said the team, like himself, is lucky to have Carril
around.
<p>
   ``It's been a great experience for all of us,'' Petrie said. ``I
just feel really fortunate that later on in life we've been able to
work together.''
<p>
   Among Carril's favorite memories are a 50-49 near upset of
top-ranked Georgetown in the 1989 NCAA tournament, and 1996's 43-41
win over defending national champion UCLA.
<p>
   ``We were the little guys,'' Carril said, ``and we had to do
what was right to win.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  This is a tale of two singers  &MD;  one sparkling and
polished, the other uncut and interesting despite flaws.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the Counting Crows, led by Adam Duritz, performed at
the Greek Theatre, while on Wednesday k.d. lange brought her
``Drag'' tour to the Wiltern. It's not hard to figure out who's the
polished one.
<p>
   Lange is the sorceress of song. Only being tone deaf will
prevent you from falling under her spell by the end of a concert.
Even marginal tunes are transformed into something special when she
sings live. Take ``The Air That I Breathe.'' I have always hated
the Hollies song and was unmoved by lange's version on ``Drag,''
her latest album. Yet, even this ditty becomes transcendent when
lange sings it live. The subtle beauty of her vocal interpretations
become hypnotic and after a while you've forgotten how silly the
song is.
<p>
   When she does move on to better material, however, the results
are sublime.
<p>
   Two songs off ``Drag'' that shine are David Wilcox's poignant
``My Old Addiction'' (formerly known as ``Chet Baker's Unsung Swan
Song'') and ``Till the Heart Caves In,'' written by T-Bone Burnett,
Bob Neuwirth and Roy Orbison.
<p>
   Acknowledging that doing anything associated with Orbison takes
on a special importance, lang launched into one of the late star's
signature songs, ``Crying,'' bringing the crowd to its feet.
<p>
   At that point, we weren't even halfway through the concert. It
only got better.
<p>
   It only takes a few minutes into a Counting Crows concert to
realize that Duritz is one of the key elements in making the band
so successful. Somewhere in that bluesy growl, Duritz projects an
emotional ache that has obviously hit home with a large number of
fans. Songs become mini-dramas as the dreadlocked, goateed singer
acts out his lyrics, thrusting a finger in the air or pounding his
chest or holding out an outstretched hand in some sort of plea.
<p>
   This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Duritz has a passion
in his singing as he stumbles over and repeats words in the best
tradition of rock and blues, and he showed an ease and rapport with
his fans at Tuesday's concert that seems genuine.
<p>
   No one will ever mistake him for a great vocal stylist, however,
and some of the Crows' songs suffer in a sameness in both
production values and tone. Yet they might seem downright mediocre
delivered by a different singer.

`FINIAN'S' MESSAGE WELL-STATED &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By REED JOHNSON &QC; 
c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  ``Finian's Rainbow'' is a crock of liberal
blarney, but it's blarney with smarts, great songs and the best of
intentions.
<p>
   The show, which turns 50 this year, is the second offering in
the new ``Reprise!'' series of semi-staged concert musicals. And,
although it's receiving a splendid birthday bash at UCLA's Freud
Playhouse, you'll easily see why it's seldom revived.
<p>
   With its odd synthesis of whimsy and social commentary, its
fairy-tale plot grafted onto an earnest lament on race relations in
the Deep South, the book by Fred Saidy and E.Y. ``Yip'' Harburg
appears at this juncture not just charmingly dated but almost
dangerously naive.
<p>
   Similarly, Burton Lane's hummable melodies and Harburg's
yearning lyrics form a fascinating grab bag of mismatched ideas:
from magical schmaltz (``How Are Things in Glocca Morra'') and lush
love songs (``Old Devil Moon'') to spry comic wordplay (``Something
Sort of Grandish'') and rousing gospel knockoffs (``The Begat'').
If bizarre contradictions were gold nuggets, ``Finian's Rainbow''
might be the richest musical ever coined.
<p>
   Meaning that it's an excellent choice for ``Reprise!''  &MD;  a
series intended not only to preserve but re-examine a
quintessential American art form. Producer Marcia Seligson deserves
to be congratulated, and the remarkable cast, coping with some key
last-minute changes, deserves to be canonized.
<p>
   The best case for song-and-dance sainthood belongs to William
Biff McGuire, stepping in just days ago for Ned Beatty as the title
character. Finian McLonergan, a twinkly eternal optimist from the
Emerald Isle, arrives in the Dixie backwater of ``Rainbow Valley,
Missitucky'' with his daughter Sharon (Andrea Marcovicci), hoping
to grow rich by planting a pot of gold in the fertile New World.
Finian admits he ``borrowed'' the treasure from a leprechaun
because ``who else would have gold in Ireland?''
<p>
   What father and daughter don't count on is having the leprechaun
(Malcolm Gets) follow them, determined to recover his stash lest he
turn into a human. Nor do they plan on landing in the middle of a
land-grabbing scheme by redneck Sen. Billboard Rawkins (a
cartoonishly menacing Robert Mandan), whose greed puts him at odds
with the sharecropper locals and, in particular, with strapping
Woody Mahoney (Rex Smith).
<p>
   Though bottom-heavy with subplots, ``Finian's Rainbow'' is
ostensibly a love story, and Smith and Marcovicci (clearly
suffering from an opening-night cold) make their paramours
credible. Marcovicci, a superb cabaret storyteller, has a sensuous,
womanly huskiness perfectly attuned to Smith's sly, easygoing
machismo (imagine a hayseed Frank Sinatra).
<p>
   But romance here gets overshadowed by deeper shades of social
satire and wishful idealism. That strange combination produces some
awkward moments, as when a black butler taunts Sen. Rawkins by
doing an exaggerated Stepin Fetchit routine, or when the senator
finds his Inner Soul Man by magically acquiring a new skin tone.
For all of its high-minded sincerity and inventiveness  &MD;  how many
musicals can rhyme ``Carmen Miranda'' with ``Red propaganda''?  &MD; 
the show carries a troubling whiff of postwar Broadway's cultural
smugness.
<p>
   But with performers like these, why carp about politics?
Scampering around a set composed of a wishing well, a poetically
crooked tree and moss-covered steps, the cast under Will
Mackenzie's savvy direction really gets its hoedown-mojo working on
big ensemble numbers such as ``If This Isn't Love.'' Cleo King
radiates sass and brass on the bluesy sharecropper anthem
``Necessity.'' Dana Stackpole's expressive dancing makes Woody's
mute sister Susan into a beautifully eloquent minor character.
<p>
   And blithe Malcolm Gets, replacing Joel Grey, steals the show as
the leprechaun Og, an anxious charmer in an Astro Turf suit.
<p>
   ``Finian's Rainbow'' evokes a time when Americans turned to the
musical theater as a test tube for new dreams. Those dreams died
with ``Camelot,'' but they still flare up now and then. And look  &MD; 
some of them shine today in ``Rent.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds rose, rounding out
a third week of gains, after the government said economic growth in
the second quarter was slower than previously reported while
inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   ``The GDP results are positive for the bond market; it makes it
look like growth isn't that strong,'' said Ken Anderson, who
oversees $7 billion at Evergreen Asset Management Corp., in
Purchase, New York. Robust growth can fuel inflation, which eats
away at the value of bonds' fixed payments.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds gained 15/32, or $4.69 per
$1,000 bond, to 100 3/32, pushing the yield down 3 basis points to
6.37 percent. The two-year note yield fell 4 basis points to 5.78
percent.
<p>
   Bonds are poised for a third straight quarter of positive
returns, according to an index of bonds maturing in more than one
year compiled by Bloomberg Analytics. With two trading days of the
third quarter remaining, Treasuries have paid investors about 3.2
percent, the fourth-best performing market in the world.
<p>
   The Commerce Department put its final estimate of second-quarter
growth at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, down from its previous
estimate of 3.6 percent. The price deflator, a measure of
inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the quarter, the
smallest rise since the second quarter of last year.
<p>
   Analysts had forecast a 1.5 percent rise in the deflator, which
measures both the magnitude of price increases and detects whether
higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
<p>
   ``Inflation is at such an extraordinary level that the slightly
higher revision isn't a problem,'' said Susan Hering, chief
economist at Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   Bonds got a further boost when the Federal Reserve bought $1.655
billion of Treasury securities maturing in two- to five years to
add money permanently to the banking system. The so-called coupon
pass doesn't signal any change in interest-rate policy, economists
said.
<p>
   To be sure, some investors fret that inflation may eventually
pick up unless the economy slows. Bonds yesterday posted their
biggest drop in almost eight weeks after reports on durable goods
orders, home sales and jobless claims showed strength, keeping
alive concern the Fed might raise bank lending rates for a second
time this year to ward off inflation.
<p>
   ``The Fed should be clear that this level of above-potential
growth is not sustainable,'', said Elizabeth Miller, who helps
manage about $500 million of bonds at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP;
Jacobsen Inc.
<p>
   ``I feel the Fed will eventually have to step in'' and raise
borrowing rates at least once more, Miller said. She's waiting for
yields on longer-term bonds to rise before buying.
<p>
   With inflation quiescent there's little expectation that a Fed
move, if it comes at all, will occur at its policy meeting Tuesday.
The central bankers last increased the target for the overnight
lending rate between banks on March 25, by a quarter point to 5.5
percent.
<p>
   ``We're still fairly positive on the outlook for the bond market
in the U.S.'' because of the prospects for slow inflation, said Rod
Davidson, who helps oversee $1 billion of fixed-income securities
at Murray Johnstone in Glasgow, Scotland.
<p>
   The government last week said that consumer prices rose at a 1.6
percent annual pace in the first eight months of the year, the
slowest since 1986.
<p>
   Now traders are turning their attention to next week, when
reports on consumer confidence, manufacturing and jobs will provide
more clues to the economy's strength.
<p>
   Friday the Labor Department will release a report on employment
and wages for September. The report is likely to show the economy
added 336,000 non-farm jobs, up from 49,000 in August, according to
the average forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
jobless rate will probably drop 0.1 percentage point to match the
23-year low of 4.8 percent seen in May and July.
<p>
   Optimism about the prospects for slow inflation can be seen in
the slim yield premium that investors are willing to accept for
30-year bonds, compared with two-year notes. The difference, or
yield spread, is 58 basis points. It reached a more than 2 1/2 year
low on Wednesday.
<p>
   ``It's just the best of all possible worlds -- the way the
American economy is running, our long-bond yields are way too
high,'' said Tom Carpenter, who manages some $6 billion in assets
at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C.
<p>
   Carpenter, who has bought long-dated Treasuries betting yields
will head lower, said the yield curve will flatten more as the
low-inflation story drives down 30-year bond yields.
<p>
   A narrow difference between short- and long-term rates could
also spur more mortgage investors to pile into Treasuries, driving
yields lower. That's because a flatter yield curve cuts the profits
for Wall Street firms who buy longer-term mortgage securities and
repackage them into shorter-term collateralized mortgage
obligations.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications Inc. and World Access Inc. led five
companies that raised a combined $1.2 billion today in the
corporate bond market.
<p>
   Some $38.6 billion of corporate bonds have been sold so far this
month, according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, New Jersey, with
investment-grade corporate bonds weighing in with $27.5 billion.
<p>
   Corporate bonds have weathered the influx of supply because the
economy continues to show strength without inflation, leading to
optimism that companies will be able to repay their debts. Even
though ``we're seeing a little earnings weakness,'' it's not
widespread enough to affect corporate credit quality, said Kevin
McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income at Dreyfus Corp.
<p>
   The spread, or the gap in yield between corporate bonds and
Treasuries, was unchanged yesterday, said traders.

   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  ABC will hit on a regular TV theme tonight with
``C-16,'' a show about crime fighters, and ``Total Security,''
which is about private investigators. The two new shows will lead
into ``The Practice,'' a midseason lawyer show from last year that
is excellent and deserves better support from the network.
<p>
   ``C-16,'' and ``Total Security'' won't deliver an audience
worthy of ``The Practice.''
<p>
    &UR; C-16 &LR; 
<p>
    &UR; When: &LR;  8 p.m. Saturdays (ABC, Channel 7).
<p>
    &UR; Premieres: &LR;  8 tonight.
<p>
    &UR; Starring: &LR;  Eric Roberts (John Olansky), D.B. Sweeney (Scott
Stoddard), Morris Chestnut (Mal Robinson), Christine Tucci (Annie
Rooney), Angie Harmon (Amanda Reardon), Zach Grenier (Jack DiRado),
Michael Cavanaugh (Dennis Grassi), Glenn Morshower (Andrew
Prichett).
<p>
    &UR; Network pitch:  &LR; This is not your father's FBI. The Criminal
Division's 16th Squad handles the L.A. Field Office's major cases.
The unit tackles the high-stakes, often emotionally charged
assignments such as kidnappings, hostage crises and terrorist
threats.
<p>
    &UR; Translation:  &LR; A bunch of renegade FBI dudes and dudettes work
cases their own way. This show will air in letterbox, meaning the
top and bottom of your screen will be black. Yikes!
<p>
    &UR; Alternate title: &LR;  ``Border Patrol''
<p>
    &UR; Pros:  &LR; This is some of Eric Roberts' best work. ... D.B.
Sweeney is as cool as ever. ... High-quality production. ... L.A.,
and often the Valley, is used almost as a character.
<p>
    &UR; Cons:  &LR; The letterbox idea, not formatting a TV show for a TV is
crazy. ... Hard to follow. ... Overly dramatic. ... Two-hour pilots
(the first hour airs tonight)  &MD;  that's cheating.

CREATIVE MINDS PURSUE THEIR HOLY GRAIL &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  About once a week, inventor Timothy Nicely leaves
his Woodland Hills home and heads for the privacy of a Canoga Park
garage he has converted into a combination office and workshop.
<p>
   Surrounded by his computer, books, newspapers, files and
prototypes of toys and other products that didn't make it to store
shelves, Nicely tinkers away into the wee hours of the morning,
finally crashing on a nearby bed between 1 and 2 a.m.
<p>
   A mini-kitchen in the garage keeps him fed. Sparky, a
three-legged dog, keeps him company. And when Nicely needs a boost
of energy, he passes on the cup of java and reaches instead for a
hot mug of ground ginkgo biloba leaves, which some believe boost
the brain's activities.
<p>
   Each visit to the garage can last hours to days at a time,
depending on Nicely's creative mood. ``I don't like to be
disturbed,'' said Nicely, who is getting royalties from two of his
inventions  &MD;  a photo image and a book published on the Internet.
Nicely is far from rich, but he's working on it, as he has been for
the past two decades in between other paying business ventures.
<p>
   Like thousands of small-time inventors around the world, Nicely
is in hot pursuit of that holy grail of inventions  &MD;  a unique
product that sells like hotcakes. We're talking about the suitcase
with wheels, the granola bar, Velcro.
<p>
   But getting there is no easy task, Nicely is quick to say.
``It's a lot of self-education.''
<p>
   In the world of inventions, business savvy is almost more
important than creative ingenuity.
<p>
   ``It's a science all its own,'' said Ted De Boer, founder and
executive director of the Inventors Assistance League in Glendale.
The 35-year-old, nonprofit organization includes thousands of
members worldwide and helps wanna-be inventors learn the ropes.
<p>
   One of the most common  &MD;  and costliest  &MD;  mistakes among green
inventors is assuming you need a patent to obtain legal ownership
of an idea. In the United States, the first to invent an original
idea  &MD;  not the first to get a patent  &MD;  claims legal ownership.
<p>
   Besides, getting a patent can take more than a year and cost
several thousand dollars  &MD;  and there's no guarantee the public will
buy the patented idea. ``Ninety percent of all patents issued don't
make any money,'' said Rusty Ruscetta, also with the Inventors
Assistance League.
<p>
   But if a manufacturer or investor likes your idea enough, they
will pay for the patent process, De Boer said.
<p>
   Instead of pursuing a patent initially, De Boer suggests
inventors establish legal ownership of an idea by documenting it in
writing. Use a workbook and develop a paper trail that includes
dates, scribblings of ideas, conversations with business people.
Such diligent paperwork will hold muster in court.
<p>
   ``I keep notes in a notebook. It's very specific,'' said Michele
Weiss of Sherman Oaks, who by day works in advertising sales and by
night squeezes in several hours on her ideas for new toys and dolls
in her home office.
<p>
   In addition to keeping a written record of her work, Weiss also
carries a small tape recorder wherever she goes to capture any
flashes of ideas. ``If I have an idea, I just record it as a blurb
in my tape recorder. My mind is always going,'' she said.
<p>
   Another common error among inventors is bungling the marketing
process. Too often, beginners chat up their brilliant ideas so much
that they end up revealing their secrets to business people,
including potential manufacturers and investors.
<p>
   ``A lot of people will say, `Just give me your idea and we'll
see what we can do,' '' Weiss recalled.
<p>
   With so many pitfalls in the way of invention success, perhaps
one of the best storehouses of helpful  &MD;  and free  &MD;  information for
would-be inventors is, of all places, your local library.
<p>
   Before you start investing too much time or money developing a
brilliant idea, the public library can be the best place to pursue
a patent search to determine if your idea has been done already. No
one wants to reinvent the wheel.
<p>
   Nonprofit organizations such as De Boer's Inventors Assistance
League and other organizations also can offer guidance and warn new
inventors of pitfalls.
<p>
   Trade shows and events can be useful excursions, too. This year
at the annual Invention Convention in Pasadena, inventors rolled
out everything from motorized in-line skates to a 500-pound bed
consisting of a wooden frame and stone mat that its maker claims
releases healthful infrared rays into the human body.
<p>
   Finally, all three Valley inventors said being a successful
inventor means keeping abreast of new products  &MD;  the competition.
From new toys to unique plates, they regularly make time to examine
and take mental notes at stores to capitalize on good ideas.
<p>
   ``If I go into a mall, I see what's out there,'' Weiss said.
<p>
   Several years ago, Bette Smith of West Hills joined the ranks of
inventors when she fashioned her first set of porcelain plates,
with grooves to hold hard tacos upright. The idea came to her 20
years ago in her kitchen, when she grumbled to her late husband
about tumbling tacos.
<p>
   Now a second line of plates, featuring sections similar to paper
plates, fill her house. Smith molded both creations out of supplies
from an arts-and-craft store and tested them out on family and
friends.
<p>
   ``When I go to restaurants, I turn them (plates) over. `Who
makes this?' '' said Smith, whose quest to find better plate
designs never ends.
<p>
   Through the Internet and gift stores, Smith estimates she has
sold several thousand plates across the United States and in Japan.
She's working on marketing her products through a television
shopping program.
<p>
   ``I've had a lot of manufacturers that said they could come
through and they didn't,'' said Smith, who now has her own company,
Platter-Puss Inc., based in her home. ``It takes a lot of stamina.
Things do not come overnight.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. business executives
regained optimism about the economy in September as they planned to
step up introduction of new products and spending for research and
development, a new industry survey showed.
<p>
   The Cahners Business Confidence Index rose 1.6 points to 66.3 in
September from 64.7 in August. This month's gain marks the first
rise in four months and puts the index ``a point-and-a-half above
the confidence reading recorded in September 1996,'' said Daryl
Delano, an economist at Boston-based Cahners Economics.
<p>
   In addition, almost 52 percent of the respondents said they see
little or no change, or even cuts, in average prices for their most
popular products next year.
<p>
   ``Only 8.7 percent of firms said that they expected to raise
prices an average of 5 percent or more'' in the next year, the
survey said. ``All visible signs point to yet another year of
benign product price inflation during 1998,'' the survey said.
<p>
   A business confidence reading above 50 means more executives
expect business to pick up in the coming months than expect a
slowdown. And ``most manufacturers seem to expect slow-but-steady
gains going forward,'' Delano said.
<p>
   ``The September CBCI shows businesses are optimistic about
continued growth during the final months of 1997 and into 1998, yet
realistic about limits to that growth,'' he said.
<p>
   The Cahners index is based on responses from almost 400
executives in the manufacturing, construction, electronics, and
consumer goods industries.
<p>
   Four of the seven index's business action components rose during
September, with more companies surveyed planning to increase
spending on research and development in the next three months as
well as introduce new products. Also, several companies said they
plan to step up production and marketing spending.
<p>
   Executives, however, said they will temper hiring plans in the
next three months, as well as reduce inventories and decrease
capital spending, the report said.
<p>
   All four industries surveyed posted the same or higher readings
during the month compared with August. The index for electronic
companies posted the largest gain, rising 3.3 points in September
to 67.9, while the index for manufacturing followed with a gain of
2.4 points to 67.0.
<p>
   The construction industry index rose 0.4 point to 65.4 during
the month, while the consumer goods industry index was unchanged at
64.6.
<p>
   By region, businesses in the Northeast, Midwest, and West
remained upbeat about conditions over the next three months, while
optimism in the South cooled from the previous month.
<p>
   The index for the Northeast rose to 67.5 in September from 64.8
in August. Overall confidence in the Midwest increased to 65.2 in
September from 62.9 the previous month. In the West, the index rose
to 67.1 during the month from a revised 65.8. The South posted the
only decline, falling to 65.1 from 65.4.
<p>
   The overall Cahners index is in line with other private and
government figures, which show the manufacturing economy expanding
at a healthy pace.
<p>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said earlier this month
its general economic index -- compiled from a survey of about 150
manufacturers in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and
Delaware -- dropped to 20.4 this month from 24.3 in August. Still,
the positive reading means the number of companies reporting
stepped-up activity surpassed those reporting weakening business.
<p>
   A key gauge of U.S. manufacturing is scheduled to be released
Wednesday by the National Association of Purchasing Management.
<p>
   The purchasing managers' index likely edged lower in September,
falling to 56.2 this month from 56.8 in August, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading above 50, nevertheless, means
manufacturing continues to expand.
<p>
   The Cahners Business Confidence Index is computed for seven
categories for each of four industry groups. For each category, an
index is computed by adding the percentage of respondents
indicating that activity will increase to half of the percentage
indicating no change. The overall index is the average of the
indexes for each of the seven categories.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Alfonso Acevedo is hoping he doesn't have to say
goodbye to his wife and two young children this weekend.
<p>
   Acevedo, a permanent resident of the United States, has applied
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card
for his wife, Leticia.
<p>
   Under a 3-year-old provision of immigration law, individuals
with family members living legally in the United States can stay in
this country while they apply for permanent residency themselves,
as long as they pay a $1,000 fine. Previously, they had to stay in
their home countries and apply from there.
<p>
   But that provision of the Immigration Act, known as Section
245i, is due to expire Tuesday.
<p>
   On Monday, the House of Representatives will consider
legislation that would extend the deadline for three weeks.
<p>
   Nonetheless, immigrants are concerned. ``If 245i does not get
extended, tens of thousands of families in which one member is a
legal resident are going to face separation,'' said Mark Silverman,
a staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San
Francisco.
<p>
   ``This is incredibly confusing for experienced immigration
attorneys, and you go to community meetings  &MD;  `should I leave,
should I stay?'  &MD;  we just can't answer that,'' he said.
<p>
   In the Acevedos' case, Leticia, an illegal immigrant, cannot
take advantage of Section 245i because her eligibility date has not
yet come up. The INS processes applicants in large groups, taking
about five years to get to them after they first apply.
<p>
   The couple would be forced to take their two children out of
school so they could go back to Mexico with their mother, while
their father continues working here to support the family, they
said.
<p>
   If Leticia Acevedo and others like her decide to stay, in hopes
that Congress will extend the Sept. 30 deadline, they will run into
another law due to take effect Saturday.
<p>
   The 1996 immigration law says illegal immigrants face
deportation if they have been in the country for 180 days after
April 1. If they go back to their home countries, they are barred
from returning to the United States for three years. If they stay
here until April 1998, and then leave, they will not be allowed
back for 10 years.
<p>
   Congress passed the tougher law to send a message, said INS
District Director Thomas Schiltgen in San Francisco. ``If you're
here in the U.S. illegally, you've got a problem.''
<p>
   The INS estimates that 5 million people live in the United
States illegally, according to spokesman Andrew Lluberes in the
agency's Washington, D.C., office.
<p>
   In California, INS officials are seeing about three times as
many people applying for the 245i exemption, Schiltgen said.
<p>
   The ones who miss the deadline will not immediately be rounded
up, he said.
<p>
   ``There's not going to be a mass effort to locate these
people.'' But, if they come to the INS's attention, they will be
deported, he said.
<p>
   ``We're concerned about family unity. I think the U.S. is very
generous. But there's got to be some credibility to the process.
... Is it fair for the U.S. to expect people to abide by
immigration laws? I think it is.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve
policymakers, who just got another reading that U.S. growth is
exceeding their oft-stated speed limit, are unlikely to raise
borrowing costs as long as inflation remains out of sight.
<p>
   Commerce Department figures today showed the economy continues
to cruise. The gross domestic product, the total output of goods
and services, accelerated at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate in
the second quarter -- and many analysts expect that to continue for
the balance of the year.
<p>
   Central bankers meet Tuesday to consider interest rate policy.
With producer prices falling for the first eight months of 1997 and
consumer prices rising at the slowest pace in 11 years, however,
they'd be hard-pressed to justify an increase in the overnight bank
lending rate to slow things down. Inflation gauges tied to the GDP
also remain tame.
<p>
   ``They need a little more political cover,'' such as evidence of
rapidly rising wages, before springing into action, said former Fed
Gov. Lyle Gramley, now a consulting economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
<p>
   Vibrant growth alone isn't enough to force a rate increase
without drawing the wrath of the White House and Congress, Gramley
said, let alone businesses and voters.
<p>
   Second quarter growth, though down from the government's
previous estimate of 3.6 percent and below the first quarter's 4.9
percent, exceeds the 2.5 percent growth rate that Fed policymakers
generally have regarded as the speed limit above which inflation
threatens to accelerate. And in another report today, the
University of Michigan said consumer confidence in the economy
remains high.
<p>
   Even so, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has signaled he's in no
hurry to act to stem growth, saying the U.S. economy is close to
achieving the Fed's goal of price stability, driven by productivity
gains that are understated by official statistics.
<p>
   ``The last 15 years have been a period of consolidating the
gains of the early 1980s and extending them to their logical end --
the achievement of price stability,'' Greenspan said in Palo Alto,
California, Sept. 5. ``We are not quite there yet, but we trust it
is on the horizon.''
<p>
   However, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago and a voting member of the Fed's policymaking Open
Market Committee, later sounded a cautionary note.
<p>
   It may be some time before it's clear the economy has reached
the point where strong growth won't spark accelerating inflation,
Moskow said in Indianapolis Sept. 19. ``Are we entering a new era,
or just experiencing a short-term anomaly?'' he wondered. ``The
answer, of course, is we don't know yet. We probably won't know for
years.''
<p>
   Many analysts see little chance the economy will stray from its
current path.
<p>
   Growth in the third quarter, which ends the day of the Fed's
policy meeting next week, probably reached 3 percent, said Joel
Kent, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the fourth
quarter, growth will likely range between 3 percent and 3.5
percent, said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter
Securities in New York.
<p>
   Investors, meantime, are sanguine at the prospects for steady,
low-inflation growth ahead -- and the Fed staying on the sidelines.
A Bloomberg News survey of the 38 primary government bond dealers
showed they expect no Fed action Tuesday.
<p>
   And, stocks and bonds rose today as investors interpreted the
latest GDP report as a sign of more good times. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2, pushing down its yield almost 4
basis points to 6.37 percent. Stocks gained, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising 67 points, or 0.84 percent, in late
afternoon trading.
<p>
   Other analysts contend, though, the inflation picture could
darken, especially if worker shortages stemming from low
unemployment translate into higher labor costs. After all, labor
costs account for two-thirds of consumer prices.
<p>
   Former Fed Gov. Gramley said he expects labor costs to rise and
central bankers to nudge the overnight bank rate a quarter point
higher to 5.75 percent by the end of the year. Added Anthony Chan,
chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus,
Ohio: ``The question should be when -- not whether -- the Fed will
move.''
<p>
   As the economy's nearly seven-year-old expansion continues,
high-tech industries are leading the way. That was highlighted by
yesterday's report showing a stronger-than-expected gain in August
factory orders for durable goods, paced by a record surge in orders
for electronics.
<p>
   Moreover, business investment in durable goods -- such as
computers -- grew during the second quarter at the fastest pace in
almost 14 years.
<p>
   Underscoring that point, analysts said most U.S. computer makers
will probably report higher third quarter earnings, as lower prices
and faster chips trigger increased demand for personal computers
and business systems. This week for example, Dell Computer Corp.'s
chief financial officer, Thomas Meredith, said sales in the
personal computer industry will rise 18 percent to 20 percent for
the next decade.
<p>
   Housing, a leading indicator of the economy's growth, also
remains strong. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors
reported sales of previously owned homes soared in August to the
highest level on record.
<p>
   The Commerce Department issues three estimates of each quarter's
GDP as more information becomes available to its economists. In its
initial estimate, on July 31, the government said the economy grew
at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That was raised
to a 3.6 percent pace last month. The first quarter's 4.9 percent
growth rate was higher than the 4.3 percent rate recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year.
<p>
   Officials attributed the revised second quarter growth estimate
to lower calculations of goods exports, consumer spending on
services and business investment in durable goods. Still, today's
report also continued to show a rapid buildup in business
inventories, which could act to brake demand for some manufactured
goods in the months ahead.
<p>
   Meanwhile, real final sales, which exclude the effects of
inventory changes, rose 2.5 percent in the second quarter,
previously reported as a 2.8 percent increase. After-tax corporate
profits rose 1.7 percent during the second quarter, previously
reported as an increase of 1.2 percent.
<p>
   On the inflation front, the GDP price deflator, a measure of
price increases followed by Wall Street, grew at a 1.8 percent pace
in the second quarter, the smallest rise since a 1.7 percent
increase in the second quarter of 1996. It was previously reported
as an increase of 1.5 percent. The price deflator measures both the
magnitude of price increases and detects whether higher costs drive
consumers away from a product.
<p>
   The price index for gross domestic purchases, which tracks the
price of all goods purchased in the U.S., including imports, grew
at a 0.8 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged from the
previous reading and the smallest increase since a 0.7 percent rise
in the third quarter of 1961.

 &UR; KDD APPEALING U.S. FCC DECISION ON OVERSEAS PHONE CALL RATES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- KDD Co., Japan's largest
international long distance phone service carrier, is appealing a
Federal Communications Commission decision to cut rates it charges
U.S. long distance companies to complete calls overseas.
<p>
   KDD submitted its petition today to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit. Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of
London, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. and Guyana Telephone &AMP;
Telegraph Co., a subsidiary of the Atlantic Tele-Network Inc. based
in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, joined in the lawsuit, said Bob
Amoth, a lawyer with the firm of Kelley, Drye &AMP; Warren LLP, and
lead attorney for KDD.
<p>
   The FCC, with few enforcement tools against foreign companies,
is trying to pressure state-owned and other phone companies outside
the U.S. to negotiate reductions in the fees they charge to
complete calls originating in the U.S. Now the companies are
striking back, saying U.S. government-set rates are arbitrary and
run counter to national sovereignty.
<p>
   ``The FCC has no jurisdiction under international law and U.S.
telecommunications laws to tell foreign carriers what ratio they
may charge to terminate international calls over their own networks
in their own countries,'' the lawsuit said.
<p>
   ``They're flat wrong,'' said Scott Harris, a lawyer with firm of
Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher LLP and former FCC international bureau
chief. ``I think that the FCC decision will be upheld. It is
clearly within its jurisdiction'' to regulate the rates U.S. long
distance companies should pay to complete calls in foreign
countries.
<p>
   At issue is the FCC's decision last month to create a system of
``benchmark'' prices as of Jan. 1, 1998 to cut the amount of money
U.S. companies pay foreign phone service providers to complete
overseas calls.
<p>
   The FCC ruling could save companies such as New York City-based
AT&AMP;T Corp., Washington, D.C.-based MCI Communications Corp. and
Westwood, Kansas-based Sprint Corp. as much as $5 billion a year.
<p>
   Yet it threatened to cut KDD's revenue from the U.S. by as much
as to two-thirds. Earlier this month, KDD and AT&AMP;T reached an
accord to cut prices. Not only does KDD object to the FCC's action
on jurisdictional grounds, it disputes the U.S. agency's formula
for calculating the benchmark prices.
<p>
   ``It's a lot of bluster and bluff from the foreign carriers,''
Harris said. ``The FCC ruling is an interim measure to protect
American consumers.''
<p>
   Eventually, he said, rates will come down because of increased
competition overseas. Also, the FCC's benchmark rates still will be
more than companies like KDD would get in a competitive market,
Harris said.
<p>
   KDD and AT&AMP;T agreed to slash connection charges from the U.S. to
Japan by 40 percent and by 70 percent on calls from Japan to the
U.S. The reduction brings down charges to about 25 cents per minute
from 42 cents for calls from the U.S. to Japan and to 13 cents per
minute from 42 cents for calls from Japan to the U.S.

<p>
   Southfield, Michigan, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal-Mogul
Corp. offered to buy U.K. auto-parts maker T&AMP;N Plc for about $2.4
billion in cash and assumed debt, expanding its global reach and
gaining the ability to deliver the more complete engine systems
that automakers demand to cut costs.
<p>
   The offer of $3.78 a share, or about $2.0 billion, represents a
premium of 29 percent over T&AMP;N's closing price yesterday. T&AMP;N stock
closed in London up 60.5 pence to 242.5 pence, or about $3.90 a
share, indicating investors expect Federal-Mogul will have to bid
more. The purchase would give Southfield, Michigan-based
Federal-Mogul, the world's largest maker of bearings and bushings,
access to T&AMP;N's other engine components. It's the latest in a
series of consolidations driven by automakers' demand that
suppliers ship full systems, not just individual parts, to cut
assembly costs.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, a Salomon Brothers analyst. ``In one fell swoop they could
accomplish a lot in terms of getting toward their goal.'' Investors
agreed, sending Federal-Mogul shares up 3 7/8 to 37 3/8 in late
trading.
<p>
   ``Investors are expecting this to be accretive to earnings,''
said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. In addition, the larger size is expected to give
Federal-Mogul more ability to maintain margins in the face of
pricing pressures from automakers, analysts said. The purchase of
T&AMP;N, which had $3.0 billion in revenue in 1996, is ``a great fit
for us,'' Federal-Mogul spokeswoman Kimberly Welch said.
Federal-Mogul's 1996 revenue was $2.03 billion.
<p>
   In one example of how the partsmaker could deliver a more
complete system, Welch said Federal-Mogul's own bearings could be
used in engines that also use T&AMP;N's pistons and cam shafts. Welch
wouldn't comment on whether Federal-Mogul will end up raising its
bid because of today's rise in T&AMP;N's share price. Federal-Mogul
began restructuring shortly after Richard Snell became its chief
executive in November 1996, selling its retail operations to focus
on manufacturing. The company took a $204 million charge in the
fourth quarter to pay for the restructuring, which is about
two-thirds complete. Snell has indicated he wants Federal-Mogul to
be a $10 billion company, analyst Needham said. ``This acquisition
brings them half way there,'' she said.
<p>
   Yet this acquisition, as well as any future ones, may hurt
Federal-Mogul's credit quality, said Sean Egan, managing director
of Egan-Jones Rating Co.
<p>
   ``This acquisition is huge, relative to Federal-Mogul's total
assets of $1.4 billion,'' Egan said. ``This acquisition alone is
big enough to damage its credit quality.'' Federal-Mogul won't be
slowed in its plan to continue growing through acquisitions, Welch
said.
<p>
   T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of asbestos, has been
vulnerable to a bid since it took a $596.8 million charge last year
to insulate it against future liability from asbestos litigation,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around $4.19 a share, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto-parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it is considering the bid with its adviser, N M
Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.

<p>
   Dallas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Trading in Camelot Corp. shares
was halted late this afternoon by the Nasdaq Stock Market as it
requested more information from the company.
<p>
   Mike Shokouhi, a Nasdaq spokesman, declined to provide
additional information about the halt.
<p>
   Before trading stopped, shares in the Dallas-based Internet
video conferencing technology developer fell 22 percent, or 2 1/4
to 8, on trading of 2.2 million shares. That's more than the 1.5
million shares outstanding.
<p>
   Over the prior two days, Camelot's stock tripled after the
money-losing company said it was in talks to license its Internet
video conferencing technology to major personal computer makers. It
didn't name the companies it's talking to.
<p>
   Yesterday, Camelot shares gained 4 3/16, or 69 percent, to 10
1/4 on trading of 6.2 million shares. The stock rose 2 21/32 on
Wednesday.
<p>
   Camelot, which announced the video conferencing technology in
July, said Wednesday it's arranged meetings with top PC makers
during the next several months
<p>
   The company's market capitalization has dropped to $12 million
from more than $78 million in 1995, when Camelot Chairman and Chief
Executive Daniel Wettreich forecast big sales of its Internet
telephone software. The sales never materialized.
<p>
   Camelot's shares quadrupled in two weeks in August 1995, moving
from a reverse-split adjusted 75 on August 16 to 317 1/2 on August
25. The biggest gain was on Aug. 24, after CNBC reporter Dan
Dorfman said Camelot's Digiphone Internet telephone software could
generate sales of up to $100 million in the next 12 months.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The British pound tumbled
against the dollar and other major currencies on a report that the
U.K. may join Europe's economic and monetary union after it gets
underway in 1999.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against sterling in two
months after an unidentified cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the British government is more eager to join Europe's single
currency, or euro, than it was several months ago.
<p>
   Sterling climbed 25 percent against the German mark since August
1996, lifted by a booming economy, higher interest rates and
expectations Britain wouldn't join monetary union at the outset.
Now, the U.K. might need to cut interest rates to bring them in
line with rates elsewhere in Europe to join the union.
<p>
   ``If the markets start to believe U.K. interest rates will come
down to levels seen in Germany and France, sterling will come down
relative to other currencies,'' said Chris Iggo, chief economist at
BZW Securities Inc.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.25 percent versus the dollar, its largest
one-day decline since July 28, to $1.6095 from $1.6299 yesterday.
It also fell to 2.8308 marks from 2.8698 marks, its biggest one-day
drop against the German currency in six weeks.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 121.20 yen from 121.13 yen and
at 1.7585 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.
<p>
   Traders were undeterred in their flurry to sell pounds, even
after the U.K. Treasury dismissed the report as speculation. A
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said the government's
reserving its option to join monetary union.
<p>
   It's typical of the British government to ``float an idea first
to see how the public reacts,'' said Bob Savage, chief currency
trader at Lehman Brothers. This could have been an ``official
leak.''
<p>
   Economists reckon the pound is likely to join the single
currency at as low as 2.5 marks, Savage said.
<p>
   Still, British officials may not let the pound fall too far,
since an overly weak currency could fan inflation. With interest
rates in the U.K. already high, the government may have little
scope to raise them much further.
<p>
   ``They have a huge dilemma,'' Savage said. ``A quickly falling
pound could lead to disaster, while a rate rise could drive the
economy into recession.''
<p>
   Jesse Torres, chief currency trader at Bank Austria, was among
sterling sellers today.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the yen on concern over
rising trade tension between the U.S. and Japan. The dollar's
strength against the Japanese currency is pushing up the price of
U.S. exports and helping to tilt the balance of trade further in
Japan's favor.
<p>
   U.S. officials repeatedly call on Japan to do more to correct
that imbalance by stimulating domestic demand. Some traders are
concerned that if the U.S. trade gap keeps worsening, U.S.
officials might soften their support for a strong dollar.
<p>
   ``Difficulty with trade issues is growing and could become even
more of a problem,'' said Lehman Brothers' Bob Savage.
<p>
   Just yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Japan's trade surplus is causing concern in Washington,
according to reports. That echoed comments by U.S. Deputy Trade
Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.
<p>
   ``The U.S. administration is on the offensive,'' said Michael
Scarlatos, currency strategist at Bankers Trust New York Corp.
``Witness Barshefsky's language yesterday.''
<p>
   Still, supporting the dollar against the yen was expectation
Japan's economy will stay weak, keeping the country's interest
rates near their all-time lows and souring investors on the yen.
<p>
   Also, since the yen's weakness benefits the economy by making
exports cheaper, Japanese officials may not mind too much if it
falls further.
<p>
   ``The economy is moribund, in terrible shape,'' said Savage.
``An export-led recovery seems to be the only way out.''
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the mark, recouping
earlier losses after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing
suggested he's satisfied with the dollar's level versus the mark.
<p>
   Concern that the German currency may be too weak ``hasn't
disappeared but it's not as strong,'' Issing said.
<p>
   Analysts consider Issing one of the Bundesbank's staunchest
inflation foes. The mark's weakness against the dollar raises
import prices and can fan inflation pressures, though traders took
his comments as a sign he doesn't think the currency's too weak.
<p>
   ``Issing's a right-winger, always vigilant on inflation,''
Scarlatos said. ``Now he's making comments that are somewhat
dovish.'' That's prompting traders to buy dollars, he said.
<p>
   The dollar fell against the mark in European trading after
comments by Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept
alive expectations that the central bank was poised to raise its
benchmark interest rate. Higher rates would boost the mark by
making some assets denominated in it more alluring.
<p>
   Gaddum said the market is right to expect higher money market
rates in the run-up to monetary union.
<p>
   Boosting confidence in the mark is a growing sense that
``Germany is recovering and that recovery is happening at a much
faster rate than previously forecast,'' said Lehman Brothers'
Scarlatos.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 1.4505 Swiss francs from 1.4503
francs yesterday, and at 5.9055 French francs from 5.9165 francs.
The dollar also was little changed at 1716 Italian lire from 1719
lire. Canada's dollar was little changed at 72.22 U.S. cents from
72.29 cents.

<p>
   Rome, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Italy's major trade unions vowed
that their pension payments won't suffer the brunt of the
government's welfare-spending cuts, after they said the government
indicated it's willing to settle for only 5 trillion lire (US$3
billion) in cuts next year.
<p>
   Union officials said they will hold another meeting with the
government Wednesday to hammer out details of how to cut the 5
trillion lire from Italy's budget next year. The government
previously had sought 6 trillion lire in cuts.
<p>
   Union leaders said after a marathon session of talks ended
tonight that they couldn't yet give their approval to the
government's cuts because they don't know how much will be from
pensions and how much from health-care spending.
<p>
   ``The government has accepted our requests for smaller cuts,''
said Sergio Cofferati, secretary of the CGIL union. ``It now
remains to see how it is divided, but one thing is certain: it
won't be 5 trillion from pension cuts alone.''
<p>
   Earlier today, Cofferati said the talks had been ``a step
forward'' after the government dropped its 6 billion-lire plan.
<p>
   The government is seeking to cut spending on pensions, one of
the main causes of its perennial budget deficits --which this year
will be about 60 trillion lire, or 3 percent of Italy's annual
economic output. The cuts would be to ensure Italy can keep its
deficits low enough to qualify for, and stay in, the European
monetary union.
<p>
   Sergio D'Antoni, the secretary of the CISL union, said union
backing for the welfare reforms, and of the 1998 budget to be
announced tomorrow, which will include the welfare savings, will
hinge on the introduction by the government of adequate measures to
boost employment.
<p>
   ``Recent jobless figures show an improvement in the situation,
but this is misleading,'' he said. ``The jobs have been created in
prosperous regions, not depressed areas where they are really
needed.''
<p>
   State statistical institute Istat reported yesterday that the
unemployment rate fell to 11.7 percent in July from 12.5 percent in
April. Only France and Spain have higher rates of joblessness
within the European Union.

<p>
   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Hogs fell to a six-month low
before the release of a quarterly government report that was
expected to show an increase in the nation's herd.
<p>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, after trading, was expected
to report that about 60.3 million hogs and pigs likely were on U.S.
farms as of Sept. 1, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, according
to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
<p>
   The increase would come as feed costs declined, making it more
profitable for farmers to raise animals to market weight and
encouraging them to expand their herds.
<p>
   ``We're expecting a bearish report,'' said Dennis Smith, a
broker at LIT Investor Services in Chicago.
<p>
   October hogs fell 0.475 cent, or 0.7 percent, to 69.25 cents a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price for an
active contract since March 19.
<p>
   The price of corn, the primary ingredient in livestock feed,
averaged $2.58 a bushel during the three-month period ended Aug.
31, compared with $4.06 a year earlier.
<p>
   After trading, the USDA reported that the hogs and pig herd was
4.0 percent higher on Sept. 1 at 60.25 million head, in line with
expectations.
<p>
   The department said the number of hogs being fed for slaughter,
a barometer of autumn and winter pork supplies, was 53.299 million
head, up 4.0 percent from a year ago. Traders expected a market
inventory of 53.4 million.
<p>
   In other markets, October cattle rose 0.475 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 68.425 cents a pound. October feeder cattle rose 0.05
cent to 78.875 cents a pound.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of small and mid-size
companies were stars of the stock market in the third quarter --
and are likely to remain investor darlings for the foreseeable
future, money managers say.
<p>
   ``Valuations are not Kmart blue-light specials any more, but
there's still more value in small stocks,'' said Geoffrey
Rosenberger, a money manager with Clover Capital Management of
Pittsford, New York, which oversees $2.1 billion.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, composed of the nation's
largest companies, rose 3 percent in the past three months,
compared with a 16 percent sprint by the Nasdaq Composite Index and
a 13 percent gain for the Russell 2000 Index, both of which are
filled with smaller companies.
<p>
   Nasdaq companies like Quantum Corp., which makes hard disk
drives and doubled in price, outshone even the best-performing Dow
stock -- AT&AMP;T Corp., up 28 percent for the quarter.
<p>
   Rosenberger has been buying MedPartners Inc., a physician
management company. Earlier this week it completed a $200 million
acquisition of Talbert Medical Management Holdings Corp. He's also
buying Comcast Corp., a cable television company.
<p>
   By traditional measures, small stocks aren't cheap, even
relative to large companies. Stocks in the Russell 2000, a small
and mid-cap barometer, are trading at 35 times profits over the
past year. Companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 are trading at 24
times profits.
<p>
   Small stocks are dear relative to earnings because they've been
soaring. Also, industry analysts expect them to grow faster than
large companies. Analysts forecast profits in the Russell 2000 will
jump 22 percent for the quarter ending Tuesday, compared with a 12
percent increase for the S&AMP;P.
<p>
   The gap expands in the following quarter, with S&AMP;P earnings
forecast to rise 13 percent, vs. a 30 percent jump among Russell
companies, according to First Call Corp. of Boston.
<p>
   For example, analysts expect Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., Colgate
Palmolive Co. and other huge consumer-products companies to report
higher third-quarter earnings, but the strength of the dollar may
shave 3 to 4 percent off revenue. Weakening currencies and rising
interest rates in Southeast Asia are intensifying concern that
revenue generated there will be reduced when converted into
dollars.
<p>
   Smaller companies tend to derive more of their revenue from U.S.
operations, and thus their earnings are usually less vulnerable to
swinging currencies.
<p>
   P&AMP;G, which gained 1 1/4 to 69 3/4, is off about 10 percent from
its July 24 peak. Nonetheless, it has recovered recently, adding 7
percent in the past two weeks.
<p>
   ``Large-capitalization stocks may have lost their leadership
role, but earnings will not bring this market down,'' said Ned
Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston Corp., which oversees
$25 billion. ``Low inflation and low interest rates continue to
offset concerns about earnings.''
<p>
   Rates have declined for most of the summer as report after
report suggested the economy continues to grow moderately with
little inflation. Low rates help stocks by reducing borrowing costs
for companies. Low rates also push down yields on alternative
investments.
<p>
   Moreover, those who run large companies haven't given up their
focus on `shareholder value.' On Tuesday, Travelers Group Inc. said
it will buy Salomon Inc. for about $9 billion to create one of the
largest financial services companies. As many as 1,500 jobs would
have to be eliminated to avoid overlap, a former Salomon managing
director said.
<p>
   Eastman Kodak Co. gained almost 8 percent this week, after the
photography company said it will trim management ranks by 20
percent and consolidate assembly plants.
<p>
   ``The focus on cutting costs won't end anytime soon,''
Rosenberger said.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives delivered another blow to the tobacco companies
today, in one more sign that lawmakers are getting tougher on the
industry.
<p>
   ``The tobacco industry has not fared well on Capitol Hill this
year,'' said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.
<p>
   The House voted to bar the federal government from promoting the
export or overseas sales of tobacco, reversing a long-standing U.S.
policy. The Senate is expected to follow suit.
<p>
   The vote came as members of the House and Senate worked, both
publicly and privately, to prepare for a meeting with President
Bill Clinton.
<p>
   That meeting is likely to happen late next week, or early the
following week, according to administration and congressional
officials. Clinton has said he wants to use the meeting to spur
joint efforts to draft sweeping legislation to reduce teenage
smoking.
<p>
   The measure approved by the House today on a voice vote bars the
United states Trade Representative, the Commerce Department, and
several other U.S. agencies from using its funds to promote
American tobacco products abroad.
<p>
   ``American taxpayers have been used to promote addicting other
people's children to the nicotine drug,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett
of Texas, who sponsored the House measure. ``This . . . will stop
that.''
<p>
   Within the past month, the Senate has repealed a special $50
billion tax break for the industry, approved more money for the FDA
to check whether retailers are selling cigarettes to minors, and
passed a 15-cent per-pack cigarette tax increase.
<p>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala reiterated
this week that the administration wants full authority for the
government to regulate nicotine and tougher penalties for cigarette
makers -- up to $1.50 per pack -- if teen smoking reduction targets
aren't met.
<p>
   ``What this is about . . . is reducing teen smoking,'' Shalala
told the Senate Labor and Human Resources panel.
<p>
   ``Reducing youth smoking must be our highest priority,'' said
Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican.
<p>
   Other lawmakers feel the same way -- Richard Lugar, the Indiana
Republican who chairs the Agriculture panel, and John McCain, the
Arizona Republican who heads the Commerce panel, both favor price
increases of $1.50 per pack.
<p>
   Sen. James Jeffords, the Vermont Republican who heads the Labor
committee, agreed that price increases are necessary --along with
anti-tobacco marketing campaigns and aggressive smoking cessation
program. ``We need to make it a dumb thing to do, rather than the
hep, adult thing to do,'' Jeffords said.
<p>
   Sen. Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican coordinating tobacco
legislation in the Senate, expects key committee chairmen to brief
him within the next week on their progress.
<p>
   ``But it's clear we're not going to have legislation this
year,'' said Brook Simmons, Nickles' spokesman.
<p>
   The landmark $368.5 billion settlement would give cigarette
makers limited immunity from future class-action lawsuits in
exchange for tobacco companies accepting government regulation,
paying for smoking cessation programs, and agreeing to sweeping new
marketing and advertising restrictions.
<p>
   The House has not yet held public hearings on the settlement but
behind-the-scene briefings have been going on and House Commerce
Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, an ally of the industry, is
quietly working on draft legislation that will take the industry's
concerns to heart.
<p>
   ``What is important is to get the proper committees to dominate
the writing of the legislation,'' said Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. analyst
Roy Burry. ``This is where the battleground will be.''
<p>
   Bliley won't say what kind of legislation he's planning. Neither
Clinton nor members of Congress are yet willing to step too far out
on such a far-reaching, complex issue that leaves an aggressive
advocate open to attack from many sides. ``Interesting town you've
got here,'' Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said this week,
reflecting on complaints that he and other negotiators have gone
too easy on the tobacco industry. ``I just wonder, where were these
people when we were filing our lawsuits, and then sitting down at
the negotiating table?''
<p>
   Although Clinton and others have praised the negotiators' work,
it is increasingly likely that the agreement faces many changes.
<p>
   ``Should an agreement be approved, it will probably be vastly
different from the one in the settlement,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, a
Californian who chairs the House Democratic Caucus. ``You have a
wide variety of people . . . an incredible number of sides who feel
they need a day in the sun.''
<p>
   And where does Fazio come down on the settlement?
<p>
   ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' he said with a smile. ``It's
very complicated, and for now, I feel better just listening and
learning.''

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Ask a New Yorker to imagine an unbelievable
collection of cars, and she might envision a dozen freshly washed
cabs, with immaculate interiors and attentive drivers, waiting
patiently with medallion numbers invitingly lighted.
<p>
   This weekend, an even more impressive sight will beckon on the
streets of Rockefeller Center as the Louis Vuitton Classic presents
a multimillion-dollar assemblage of exotic cars, not one of them
for hire.
<p>
   The 1997 Vuitton Classic opened Friday to the public, with 49
extraordinary cars displayed along Rockefeller Plaza from 48th to
51st Streets. Hours are 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. There is no admission charge. The cars
include racing Ferraris and rarely seen ``dream cars`` of the 1950s
and '60s.
<p>
   More than a million people looked over the cars on display last
year at the inaugural Vuitton Classic. The event is underwritten by
Louis Vuitton North America, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton.
<p>
   ``We felt that New Yorkers would respond to a sophisticated
display of carefully chosen, important automobiles,'' said Murray
Livingstone Smith of Amagansett, N.Y., a vintage car enthusiast who
is chief judge for the event. ``So we tried to pick cars that had
visual and emotional appeal.''
<p>
   He added: ``Manhattanites don't have any opportunity to see
exotic cars. While there are scores of important paintings and
sculptures in museums here, only the Museum of Modern Art has cars
in its permanent collection, and it only has three of them.''
<p>
   Don Williams, who as president of the Blackhawk Collection in
Danville, Calif., specializes in the sale of prewar classic cars,
is sending three entries from the West Coast this year. ``In my 40
years in the classic car business, I'd never seen a concours held
in the middle of a bunch of skyscrapers,'' he said. ``Californians
have a passion for cars, but New Yorkers?''
<p>
   Last year, he added, ``I was astounded by the degree of
acceptance, by the way the passers-by would stop, admire and
enjoy.''
<p>
   Like jet-setting tourists, the cars are coming from around the
world. Many of the European entries arrived this week in regal
style  &MD;  no fender-rubbing coach class for these beauties  &MD;  on the
Queen Elizabeth 2. These included the world's only vintage Bugatti
with four-wheel drive, built in 1931; the C-Type Jaguar that won
the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1953, and a 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB
that was raced by Stirling Moss, the only person to be world
champion on motorcycles and in cars.
<p>
   The cars in the classic, handpicked by Smith, are divided into
eight classes. A team of judges will rate the cars on the basis of
their originality, rarity, significance of coachwork, mechanical
innovation and visual appeal. Among the judges are Phil Hill, the
former Formula One World Champion; Alain de Cadenet, one-time race
car driver, car collector and award-winning philatelist; Steve
Earle, founder of the Monterey Historic Races in California, and
David Gooding, managing director of Christie's international auto
auction division.
<p>
   In an event that includes many notable cars, many spectators may
find these entries of particular interest:
<p>
   1957 BMW 507  &MD;  Entered in the postwar sports car class, the 507
has had a modest resurgence of popularity in the last two years.
The styling of the current BMW Z3 roadster makes reference to the
507, and some Americans may recall that Elvis Presley owned a new
one. Only 253 of these V8-powered cars were built, from 1955
through 1963. The cars are currently valued at more than $200,000
each.
<p>
   1911 MERCEDES LABOURDETTE SKIFF  &MD;  One of the most unusual cars
in Rockefeller Center will be this 90-horsepower, four-seat
roadster. Delivered new to Harry Stetson of haberdashery fame, the
body is constructed entirely of ash and mahogany. The Skiff's
restoration took 12,600 hours, and 2,700 brass rivets were used to
fasten the wooden body panels to the frame.
<p>
   1970 PLYMOUTH SUPERBIRD  &MD;  Yes, the Vuitton Classic includes cars
that are not from Europe. This Detroit supercar, powered by a
426-cubic-inch Hemi V8, has been driven only 4,000 miles since new.
The original window sticker is still in place, and Smith says  &MD; 
with perhaps a trace of exaggeration  &MD;  that it ``still has the
original air in its tires.'' Built with a sloping nose and a high
rear wing intended to improve aerodynamics on the 150 mile-an-hour
banked turns of Daytona and other stock-car tracks, the Superbird
was an immediate success in competition. It was so good, in fact,
that it was outlawed under a rules change after one season.
<p>
   1938 ADLER COMPETITION COUPE  &MD;  When new, this German car won its
class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It was also the first car to
start the 24-hour race with a woman, Anne Rose Itier, behind the
wheel.
<p>
   1927 TYPE 8AS ISOTTA FRASCHINI  &MD;  This car, with a custom
roadster body designed by the Fleetwood coachworks, was ordered by
Rudolph Valentino. The car  &MD;  built at a cost of $25,000  &MD;  was still
being built for the screen idol at the time of his death in 1926.
<p>
   Another highlight will be four ``dream cars`` from the Bortz
Auto Museum in Highland Park, Ill. In the 1950s and '60s Chrysler,
Ford and General Motors tried to outdo one another with futuristic
designs for the auto show circuit, each with more elaborate gadgets
and more outrageous styling flourishes. Most of these concept cars
ended up being crushed by the manufacturers, since old show cars,
like last year's race cars, have no functional purpose.
<p>
   But Joe and Mark Bortz have spent years tracking down the few
cars that escaped destruction and restoring them for exhibition.
Among their finds is a 1954 Pontiac Bonneville Special with a
Plexiglas jet-fighter-style cockpit and aircraft-type
instrumentation. Its two seat belts were controversial at the time,
when the prevailing view on crash safety was ``don't belt me in.''
<p>
   There will also be a class for Ferraris, celebrating the Italian
company's 50th anniversary. One featured car is a 1962 Ferrari GTO.
Only 39 GTO's were built in 1962-64, and during the collector car
boom of the late 1980's one prime example sold for nearly $13
million. Although their value has declined to about $4 million,
that still represents a hefty rate of appreciation for a vehicle
that cost less than $15,000 new.
<p>
   The Chrysler Corp., in keeping with its current practice of
seeking inspiration for new cars in the automotive past, is
sponsoring four awards. The categories are overall design
excellence, packaging, most fun to drive and mechanical ingenuity.
And enhancing the New York qualities of the classic this year, Saks
Fifth Avenue is decorating its windows nearby to pay tribute.
<p>
   The Louis Vuitton Classic ends on Sunday after a parade at 3
p.m. across 50th Street, down Fifth Avenue and back across 49th
Street. When the cars arrive at the viewing stand on Rockefeller
Plaza, awards will be presented to the winners in each class, along
with a ``people's choice`` award and a trophy for best of show.

<p>
   Birmingham, Alabama, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares plunged 34 percent today after the
company said its lead drug in development, known as BCX-34, didn't
work in two late-stage studies.
<p>
   Shares of the Birmingham, Alabama-based company fell 3 1/4 to
close at 6 1/4, making the stock the biggest percentage loser on
U.S. markets today. Shares plunged to a 52-week low of 4 1/4 as the
market first opened before recovering later in the day. More than
1.2 million shares changed hands, about 39 times the stock's
previous three-month average daily volume.
<p>
   The topical cream formulation of the company's BCX-34 drug
candidate was the most advanced of BioCryst's versions of the drug.
BioCryst is in earlier trials with oral drug candidates to treat a
variety of conditions including lymphoma and HIV, said Charles
Bugg, chairman and chief executive officer of the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company.
<p>
   ``The results don't really relate at all to the oral'' version
of the drug, Bugg said. ``We remain very upbeat about the drug,''
for other uses, he said.
<p>
   In preliminary analyses of the studies, there was ``no
statistical difference'' between the drug and a placebo in patients
with the skin disease psoriasis and a cancer condition known as
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, BioCryst said. The two studies were
so-called Phase III trials, generally the last set before applying
for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug.
<p>
   ``We are continuing to analyze the data from the Phase III
trials, but we do not expect to see any overall change in these
general results,'' Bugg said. Because of the results, the company
doesn't plan to continue developing the cream formulation of the
drug, he said.
<p>
   The failure of the cream to show efficacy set the company back
as much as a year and a half in its efforts to bring a drug to
market, Bugg said. He added the best prospect for an important drug
had been and remained the oral formulations, which should begin
pivotal trials in 1998.
<p>
   ``Oral is the big long-range pay off,'' Bugg said.
<p>
   In the lymphoma study, the company found that 28 percent of
patients given BCX-34 saw their condition improve, while 24 percent
of patients given a placebo treatment improved. The company said
the high placebo response rate ``was totally unexpected.''
<p>
   In the psoriasis study, the company found mixed results.
Patients given BCX-34 had a 14 percent greater response when
looking at the number of lesions on the skin, though the difference
between the drug and the placebo wasn't strong enough to be
considered ``significant.'' When looking at doctors' measurements
of overall improvement in the patients, though, the company found
that only 11 percent of the patients taking the drug improved
compared with 15 percent of the group taking a placebo.
<p>
   The company is also working on an ointment version of the
topical drug, which would deliver as much as 20 times the medicine
through a patient's skin as did the cream formulation, Bugg said.

 &UR; MUTUAL FUNDS: FRANKLIN RESOURCES SURGES TOWARD 120? (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Tim Quinson &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Investors would have made a
lot of money owning shares of Franklin Resources Inc. over the past
year -- twice what they'd have made in any of its funds.
<p>
   Shares of Franklin, the largest U.S. publicly traded mutual fund
company, have risen 112 percent since last September, almost
tripling the returns of the U.S. benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Index. Today alone, Franklin shares surged 5 13/16 to 93 1/2.
<p>
   Some Wall Street analysts, including Richard Strauss of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., expect the rally in Franklin shares to continue.
Others, namely Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, think the
company's stock is fully priced.
<p>
   ``The stock could reach 120 in the next year,'' Strauss said.
That would represent an additional advance of more than 25 percent
in the company's stock from its current level.
<p>
   Strauss bases his bullish forecast on his estimate that
Franklin's earnings will increase at an annual rate of 20 percent
for the next three to five years.
<p>
   Dally is also optimistic on Franklin's business outlook. He just
thinks the stock won't keep rising at the current pace. ``We're
neutral on the stock,'' he said.
<p>
   Just a few of the biggest U.S. fund groups are publicly traded
since most are closely held, including industry giants Fidelity
Investments and Vanguard Group.
<p>
   Among the fund groups that do offer publicly traded shares are
T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., John Nuveen Co., Pioneer Group Inc.,
Eaton Vance Corp., Liberty Financial Cos. and Phoenix Duff &AMP; Phelps
Corp.
<p>
   None of these companies' stocks have risen as much as Franklin's
in the past year. The closest competitor is Baltimore-based T. Rowe
Price. Its stock was up almost 97 percent in the past 12 months.
The worst performer is Pioneer's stock, up just 16 percent since
last September.
<p>
   Franklin, the manager of the Franklin Templeton mutual fund
group, has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry
with more than $1.7 billion in shareholders' equity, Smith Barney
Inc. analyst Dean Eberling wrote in a report distributed today.
<p>
   The company's strong balance sheet is ``a source of strategic
and competitive strength that should act in concert with earnings
growth to help the company achieve and maintain a premium
valuation,'' Eberling wrote.
<p>
   ``We're raising our price target on the stock to $100,'' wrote
Eberling, who expects Franklin shares to ``outperform'' the market.
It's possible Franklin will report higher-than-expected earnings in
its fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 30, boosted by the strong
financial markets and high cash inflows to the company's mutual
funds, he said.
<p>
   Eberling is estimating Franklin will report earnings of 93 cents
a share for the fourth quarter, and $3.37 a share for the fiscal
year, according to his report.
<p>
   The strength of Franklin's international stock fund business and
the acquisition of veteran stock-picker Michael Price's mutual fund
group are combining to attract a lot of new assets to the firm,
Goldman's Strauss said. Inflows to Franklin's fixed-income funds
also are improving as worldwide bond market returns improve, he
said.
<p>
   Franklin will report a 33 percent increase in net income for the
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, said Strauss, who estimates the
company will report earnings of $3.35 a share for the 12-month
period. The San Mateo, California-based company will earn $4.05 in
fiscal 1998, he said.
<p>
   ``The company's earnings outlook looks very positive,'' Strauss
said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted today to bar the federal government from
promoting the export or overseas sales of tobacco, delivering
another congressional blow against the tobacco industry.
<p>
   By a voice vote, the House approved a measure to bar the United
States Trade Representative, the Commerce Department, and several
other U.S. agencies from using its funds to promote U.S. tobacco
products outside the U.S., except in cases where it was purposely
discriminated against.
<p>
   Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg says he will seek to include
the measure in similar legislation moving through the Senate, and
lawmakers predicted it will become law this year.
<p>
   ``American taxpayers have been used to promote addicting other
people's children to the nicotine drug,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett
of Texas, who sponsored the amendment in the House. ``This
amendment will stop that.''
<p>
   The trade measure is the latest in a series of attacks on the
tobacco industry this year. Congress earlier this month repealed a
$50 billion tax break for the industry slipped into last summer's
balanced budget amendment. It approved $34 million next year for
the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco control program, and
raised cigarette taxes by 15 cents in the tax bill.
<p>
   ``The tobacco industry has not fared well on Capitol Hill this
year,'' said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.
<p>
   Today's measure prevents the U.S. agencies funded by the
Commerce, Justice, State annual spending bill from promoting
tobacco. That includes Commerce or State Department employees,
along with U.S. trade representatives and ambassadors.
<p>
   The bill was amended to allow trade officials to step in if
another country was discriminating against U.S. tobacco products
while supporting local products or imports from other nations. It
would allow the USTR to step in if a country allowed domestic
advertising while banning U.S. ads, for example.
<p>
   That change was made at the request of Republican Rep. Harold
Rogers of Kentucky, who sought to ensure that the U.S. would not
allow tobacco products to be purposefully discriminated against
outside the U.S. ``We wanted a fairer playing field than what was
in the original amendment,'' said Rogers spokeswoman, Susan
Zimmerman.
<p>
   The USTR is charged with supporting the export and sale of U.S.
products overseas, opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, lowering
trade barriers and tariffs, and negotiating free trade agreements.
<p>
   It aggressively promoted tobacco -- along with other U.S.
products -- in years past. Under the Clinton administration, is
agreed to accept foreign restrictions on U.S. tobacco products,
including advertising bans and health labels, as long as they were
also required on domestic products.
<p>
   Recently anti-tobacco advocates and their congressional allies
have increasingly called for the U.S. to stop promoting tobacco
overseas at all, arguing that it is hypocritical for the U.S. to
seek restrictions on tobacco products in the U.S., while at the
same time promoting the project in other countries.
<p>
   ``While the Marlboro Man has been forced to the negotiating
table in the U.S., he's twirling his rope around the throats of
children around the world,'' Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg said.

   Colorado Springs, Colorado, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Many
Canadians were shocked and shamed last year when they discovered
that one of their country's top junior hockey coaches had sexually
assaulted his players.
<p>
   It's only a matter of time before the same type of story sweeps
across America, one top U.S. hockey official said.
<p>
   While the Canadian Hockey Association recently unveiled a
three-year, C$330,000 (US$247,500) campaign aimed at identifying
coaches and volunteers with criminal records and educating players
and coaches about abuse, 23 of USA Hockey's 30 youth affiliates
don't have any kind of screening procedure.
<p>
   ``This is a time bomb waiting to happen,'' said Peter Lindberg,
USA Hockey's lead counsel. ``I hate to use a cliche, but we're
skating on thin ice.''
<p>
   With the cost of running background checks typically ranging
from $5 to $25 per person each year, some associations don't want
to spend the money.
<p>
   ``It could end up destroying the lives of some of the more than
360,000 amateur U.S. hockey players,'' Lindberg said.
<p>
   USA Hockey has a screening process on the national level, and
encourages its affiliates to run background checks on coaches,
Lindberg said. Still, the cost and privacy laws keeps groups in
some areas from doing them.
<p>
   ``I don't want to predict it,'' he said. ``But surely with all
the kids and coaches together, it's going to happen here,''
<p>
   It already has.
<p>
   A former assistant coach with the Grand Rapids Grizzlies junior
hockey team in Michigan recently pleaded guilty in Muskegan Circuit
Court to one count of assault with intent to commit sexual
penetration. Thomas Andrew Hicks, 27, in court admitted to
performing oral sex on a 13-year-old player.
<p>
   The uproar in Canada centers on Graham James, a junior league
coach who was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison after being found
guilty of sexually assaulting two former junior hockey players. One
of them, National Hockey League player Sheldon Kennedy, said James
assaulted him more than 300 times during a six-year period.
<p>
   James coached for the Swift Current Broncos in Saskatchewan,
consistently one of the best of the dozens of junior teams in
Canada.
<p>
   Massachusetts Hockey pioneered the screening procedure in 1994.
When the group checked the state's 9,000 volunteer coaches, 10 came
back with such red flags as sex-related, alcohol or drug
trafficking offenses.
<p>
   ``We have to do these type of checks,'' said Charlie Bobbish,
assistant chairman of Massachusetts Hockey's physical and sexual
abuse screening committee. ``There's no reason to think this
problem will end at the ice rink doors.''
<p>
   Running those checks may have saved Massachusetts Hockey from
potential litigation, according to the lawyer who wrote a 62-page
report on abuse for the Canadian Hockey Association.
<p>
   ``It's going to save the associations millions in the long
run,'' said Toronto lawyer Gordon Kirke, whose campaign includes
public service announcements directed at youth players from
National Hockey League stars Martin Brodeur and Paul Kariya.
<p>
   When the Michigan Amateur Hockey Association started background
checks earlier this year, 15 out of the state's approximately
10,000 amateur coaches were identified as potential concerns.
<p>
   ``Those 15 coaches were removed initially for old drug
offenses,'' said Gerry Conley, who is the group's chairman of
screening and a USA Hockey director. ``They are all back on the ice
after appealing. It was determined that their old drug offenses
didn't make them a risk to children.''
<p>
   Even as USA Hockey affiliates in Massachusetts and Michigan
acknowledge they need to follow Canadian hockey's path and educate
players about sexual abuse, others are saying that it's too
expensive to run background checks.
<p>
   ``With an attitude like that, it's safe to say they are the most
backward areas of the country with this problem,'' Conley said.
<p>
   The Montana Amateur Hockey Association hasn't paid to screen the
300 coaches and volunteers that work with 3,000 players.
<p>
   ``We don't have enough volunteers as it is,'' said association
President Steve Riggin. ``I guess we're keeping our fingers crossed
behind our backs and hoping that it doesn't happen. We've got a
real limited budget.''
<p>
   He said the association's board will discuss screening at an
upcoming meeting.
<p>
   One board member, Dexter Busby, has a 14-year-old son playing
bantam hockey in Great Falls.
<p>
   ``I'm not particularly concerned. I know the volunteers, and
ours isn't a particularly big organization,'' Busby said. ``We
don't have the money, we don't have a paid hockey official in the
state. Montana's not a high income area.''
<p>
   Still, Busby said he recognizes the association is gambling with
its players.
<p>
   ``We have recognized we are taking a risk,'' he said. ``What
happened in Canada hits home and it shocks the hell out of us. I
just have a problem believing people here would get into hockey for
that reason.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Denver-based Birner Dental
Management Services Inc., another in a series of dental practice
managers going public, expects to raise as much $23 million in a
first-time stock sale.
<p>
   The company filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the initial public offering, but didn't provide he
number of shares to be sold, the price per share or the number of
shares to be outstanding after the offer. Further details will be
available in subsequent filings.
<p>
   Since its formation in May 1995, Birner Dental has acquired 31
dental practices -- 28 in Colorado and three in New Mexico. The
company now manages 34 offices, some of which offer specialty
services such as orthodontics, in addition to general dental
services.
<p>
   Two brothers, Frederic and Mark Birner, founded the company.
Frederic Birner, 40, serves as chairman and chief executive. He
previously worked as a vice president of corporate finance for
Cohig &AMP; Associates Inc., an investment bank.
<p>
   Mark Birner, 38, serves as president and was the owner and
operator of three dental practices. He received his dental degree
from the University of Colorado.
<p>
   The brothers are the company's largest shareholders and own a
25.3 percent stake before the stock offering.
<p>
   Existing shareholders, including two Birner Dental directors,
will sell 296,236 shares in the offering, the filing said.
<p>
   The filing is the latest in a series of IPO filings from dental
practice management companies. DentalCo Inc. and Dental Care
Alliance Inc. filed registrations recently.
<p>
   Coast Dental Services Inc. shares began trading in February at
$8 each, and the stock has risen 259 percent since February,
reaching a high of 28 3/4 on Sept. 23. Its stock rose 1/4 to 28 3/8
in today's trading.
<p>
   These companies say trends such as the increase of dental
insurance and the consequent added burdens in accounting and
paperwork on dentists is are driving consolidation in the field. In
1995, 87 percent of the 151,000 practicing U.S. dentists worked
alone or with one other dentist, according to the American Dental
Association.
<p>
   Birner Dental said it will use $2.35 million of proceeds from
the stock sale to repay debt. Birner Dental will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of stock held by shareholders.
<p>
   An additional $1.4 million in proceeds will be used to repay a
note issued in connection with the Sept. 8 purchase of Gentle
Teeth, which has nine dental practices in Colorado, for $3.5
million. That note bears 8 percent interest and matures Sept. 8,
2000.
<p>
   The remaining proceeds will be used for potential acquisitions,
development of new offices, working capital, and general corporate
purposes, the filing said.
<p>
   For the six months ended June 30, Birner Dental reported net
income of $266,000, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$96,000, or 3 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue for the
six months ended June 30 was $6.8 million compared with $2.1
million the year before.
<p>
   On an adjusted basis to reflect recent acquisitions, the stock
offer, and reduction of debt, the company's net income for the six
months ended June 30 was $564,000. Revenue was $10.2 million.
<p>
   Dennis Genty, Birner Dental's chief financial officer, declined
to comment on the offering.
<p>
   Wheat First Butcher Singer and A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. will
underwrite the offering, and shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock
Market under the symbol BDMS, according to the S-1 registration
statement filing.

YELTSIN SIGNS BILL RESTRICTING SOME RELIGIONS IN RUSSIA
 &UR; By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Ignoring objections from the Clinton administration and
the Vatican, President Boris Yeltsin on Friday signed into law a
controversial bill that recognizes the Russian Orthodox Church as
the nation's dominant religion and restricts activities of other
religious groups.
<p>
   The sweeping legislation, ostensibly aimed at curbing the
activities of religious cults, was strongly backed by Russia's
Orthodox Church. A wide array of Russian politicians, eager to
distinguish the church's historic role and its newfound popularity
since the collapse of communist rule, supported the bill.
<p>
   But religious and secular groups throughout the world have
condemned the law, arguing that it violates the spirit of Russia's
constitutional democracy.
<p>
   ``This is the most serious setback in human rights since the
days of the Soviet Union,'' said Lawrence Uzzell of the Keston
Institute in Moscow, which monitors religious freedom in Russia.
<p>
   Yeltsin vetoed an earlier version of the bill in July after it
came under fire from the Vatican and the U.S. Congress threatened
to withhold aid to Russia. The Russian president faced intense
criticism within Russia for his decision and he quickly endorsed a
revised version of the bill that emerged earlier this month.
<p>
   But critics said the amendments were negligible, failing to
address the more controversial provisions of the legislation. The
law will restrain the free practice of religion, they contend.
<p>
   The law recognizes the Orthodox Church's ``special role'' in
Russia, and in general vows to respect other forms of Christianity
and Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. But many religious groups,
including mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches, fear they
will face discrimination in the way the law is administered,
particularly in Russia's outlying provinces.
<p>
   Under the new law's most controversial clause, religious groups
must be present in Russia for 15 years before they can legally
publish and distribute religious literature or invite foreign
representatives to Russia to preach.
<p>
   Under the official atheism of the Soviet era, only a few
religions were allowed to discreetly practice in Russia and thus
few meet the 15-year requirement.
<p>
   Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, patriarch of the Russian Orthodox
Church, hailed the law was an important step to protect ``the
rights of believers in Russia.''
<p>
   In August, Alexy said that ``North American standards'' of
freedom of religion should not be applied to Russia.
<p>
   The views of Pope John Paul II ``were not sufficiently taken
into consideration'' by Yeltsin and his signature of the bill was
lamentable, a senior Vatican official said in a speech Friday to
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
<p>
   The new law ``certainly does not represent progress toward the
path to religious coexistence in that great nation,'' said
Monsignor Mario Zenari in his a speech before the OSCE meeting in
Vienna.
<p>
   But the Yeltsin administration reportedly assured Vatican
officials in private that Russian authorities would not use the law
to create ``problems'' for Roman Catholics.
<p>
   Quick and overwhelming passage of the bill last week by
parliament's lower house, the Duma, and this week by the upper
house demonstrated the increasing power of the Russian Orthodox
Church in the post-Soviet society and Russian politics.
<p>
   In talks with Russian officials during a visit to Moscow this
week, Vice President Al Gore urged modifications to the bill, if
not an outright veto by Yeltsin. Gore said the United States had
serious concerns about the proposed law and its legal experts were
seeking to explain those views to Yeltsin's administration.

<p>
   St. George, Bermuda, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Asset-backed bonds,
long seen as a safe bets for capturing high yields, are cropping up
in riskier varieties, and investors are buying them up.
<p>
   The demand for the newer types of these securities is driven by
investors' appetite for higher yields, as competition for
conventional asset-backed bonds has grown to include mutual funds
and pension funds, in addition to insurance companies, which tended
to buy through private sales.
<p>
   Even as the pool of investors expands, the growth rate of new
asset-backed bond sales in the U.S. is slowing for the first time
in a decade, making the securities pricier.
<p>
   These trends will be the focus of a conference beginning Sunday
in St. George, Bermuda.
<p>
   With spreads so tight, ``People are going to have to change the
way they do business in order to generate above-average returns,''
said Michael Thomas, a conference speaker, who helps manage $2
billion of asset-backed bonds at SunAmerica Investments in Los
Angeles.
<p>
   Since 1985, when the first public asset-backed bond was sold,
the market has become better understood and more efficient.
<p>
   As the hefty yields once provided by the bonds shrink in
relation to government debt, investors are snapping up lower-rated
classes of bonds, which offer greater yields. They will be
scrutinizing these so-called subordinated classes, which are first
to take a hit by absorbing losses from delinquent loans, providing
a cushion for higher-rated bonds.
<p>
   Such bond cushions ``will take center stage as investors look
lower in credit ratings for extra yield,'' said Anand Bhattacharya,
head of fixed-income debt at Prudential Securities Inc.
<p>
   Investors are also eyeing bonds backed by nontraditional assets
such as home equity loans, considered riskier because their
payments aren't as certain as bonds backed by such assets as credit
cards.
<p>
   Interest payments on home equity loan bonds could be interrupted
if homeowners refinance these loans when interest rates decline,
delivering principal back to investors earlier than anticipated.
<p>
   As more investors turn to such bonds, the search is on for
timely information about the payment habits of consumers and the
speed at which they pay their debts.
<p>
   ``We're still learning a lot about home equity loans,'' said
Frank Fabozzi, adjunct professor at Yale University School of
Management and co-sponsor of the conference. ``We have to know more
about behavioral patterns of people with respect to prepayments.
There's a lot of credit analysis to be done.''
<p>
   Just as competition heats up among buyers of asset-backed bonds,
issuers are looking outside the U.S., turning to investors in Asia
and Europe, selling bonds in a variety of currencies.
<p>
   Ford Motor Credit Co., for instance, recently sold bonds backed
by car loans, denominated in deutsche marks, and plans to sell more
in other currencies through a special program called
``Globaldrive.''
<p>
   Ford sold car loan bonds in marks ``because that's where the
demand was,'' said James Bosscher, assistant treasurer at Ford
Motor Credit. ``We've created a platform to issue bonds in a
variety of currencies.... Because (asset-backed debt) is better
known and understood, demand is growing faster outside the U.S.''
<p>
   Just as companies reach to a wider group of investors, the pace
of asset-backed bond issuance in the U.S. is slowing. Sales of
bonds backed by credit cards are dropping as banks tighten
standards for opening new accounts, and many banks are taking their
bond offerings overseas.
<p>
   ``It hasn't been the same exponential growth we've seen in the
past,'' said Lisa Anderson, director of asset-backed research at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. ``Many U.S. issuers are looking
overseas'' and at other alternatives for selling securities backed
by receivables such as commercial paper.
<p>
   Anderson reckons that sales of asset-backed bonds will total
$170 billion this year, up about 10 percent from $159 billion last
year. On average, sales have risen 40 percent a year over the last
decade.
<p>
   The amount of bonds could decline further if consumers pull back
on credit usage. ``To the extent that consumer expansion stalls,
all the stuff that we've seen grow -- credit card bonds, home
equity loans and mortgage bonds, will start to slow,'' said
Bhattacharya of Prudential Securities.
<p>
   Yield-hungry investors will also look to credit rating companies
to help them analyze bonds as the risk of consumer defaults grows.
<p>
   Banks wrote off 5.22 percent of credit card accounts as
uncollectable in July, the latest month for which figures are
available, well above the 4.67 percent in the year-ago month,
according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.
<p>
   With losses mounting, some investors are sticking with the
safest and highest-rated asset-backed bonds, buying the bonds of
companies that are doing a good job of keeping a lid on defaults in
credit cards and other loans.
<p>
   ``Today, investors are becoming more aware about differences
among issuers and how they manage credit risk,'' said Kenneth
Vecchione, chief financial officer at AT&AMP;T Universal Card Services
Inc. ``They're willing to pay a premium for those with higher
quality profiles.''
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Universal Card Services has seen the number of investors in
its bonds grow as it tightens standards for opening new credit card
accounts. Some 125 institutions bought bonds at its last credit
card bond sale in May, up from an average of 61 buyers in sales
since its first sale two years ago.
<p>
   Still, many investors say the time is ripe for considering bonds
of a riskier nature, and will focus their attention on how to get
the most yield and value from those securities.
<p>
   Most five-year credit card bonds, rated ``AAA,'' yield about 35
basis points more than comparable Treasury notes, down from 50
basis points four years ago. They've gotten as narrow as 28 basis
points in recent months.
<p>
   ``It's unbelievable how spreads have tightened,'' said Douglas
McKoy, a conference panelist, who helps manage $30 billion of bonds
at Conseco Capital Management in Carmel, Indiana.
<p>
   ``People in the corporate market who were having a hard time
finding values turned to the asset-backed market as an alternative.
Now, they're driving spreads tighter in this market,'' McKoy said.
``It's definitely harder to find rewards.''

<p>
   LOS ANGELES -- In 1952, when Jack Webb moved his radio show
about police officers to television, he won the cooperation of
William Parker, this city's police chief. Amid an Eden of sunshine
and promise, the cops on ``Dragnet,'' chanting ``Just the facts,''
were robots of righteous nobility, immune from emotion.
<p>
   ```Dragnet' was one of the great instruments to give the people
of the United States a picture of the policeman as he really is,''
Parker said. ``This program showed the true portrait of the
policeman as a hard-working, selfless man, willing to go out and
brave all sorts of hazards and work long hours to protect the
community.''
<p>
   ``L.A. Confidential'' begs to differ. A sprawling, brawling saga
of fear and corruption, the movie is a classic of squalor in an
innocent time. At first, Curtis Hanson seems like a typical
Hollywood director with a miniseries mindset, stressing sets and
costumes over script and acting. But the camera does not linger on
surface details as it careens through a corkscrew plot.
<p>
   Popcorn sales fall during this one. Bodies do, too, with enough
corpses to staff two showings of ``Hamlet.'' On the soundtrack,
Johnny Mercer sings his 1950s hit, ``Accentuate the Positive,'' but
this gore-splattered epic evokes a line from ``Hooray for
Hollywood,'' his 1930s ditty: ``from Chillicothes and Paducahs they
bring bazookas/To get their names up in lights.''
<p>
   Since the sweep of this film seems to telescope the eras of
Raymond Chandler and Otis Chandler, when L.A. cops have been much
in the news, the question arises: Were the L.A. police that corrupt
back then?
<p>
   Just as ``L.A. Confidential'' is an antidote to ``Dragnet,'' a
full portrait of L.A. law awaits Lou Cannon's ``Official
Negligence: How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and
the L.A.P.D,'' from Random House. Cannon says that his historical
research establishes that ``Parker took a department that was
notoriously corrupt and made it into an honest force. You took an
apple on the street and you were gone.''
<p>
   Critics salute ``L.A. Confidential,'' but how about moviegoers?
I talked to several outside Mann's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood
Boulevard. ``I liked it because the characters aren't clear-cut.
The good guys are also the bad guys,'' said Jim Taylor of
Roslindale. ``This is the second time I've seen it. I read the
novel and I admire how they compressed all the characters into the
screenplay, while still preserving the bleakness of it. It's such a
great film noir. I think it's better than `Chinatown.''' (As
students rediscover film noir, they'll find that stiff old Jack
Webb played the only funny character in the ultimate film noir on
L.A., ``Sunset Boulevard.'')
<p>
   Taylor, a screenwriting student at the American Film Institute
here, has a professional interest, but another fan is Adam
Thompson, ``Security guard, San Fernando Valley, father of two.''
He liked ``how it captured the period with characters who are
believable. There aren't a lot of cliches, no car crashes or
special effects.'' Thompson, who is black, said, ``The L.A.P.D. was
abusing minorities back then, too, and getting away with it. But
what a story. Kevin Spacey did an awesome job.''
<p>
   Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, a cynically suave cop who is
technical adviser to a show much like ``Dragnet,'' a role that may
place him in the best-actor Oscar category. In a supporting role,
James Cromwell's police captain is a far oink from his role in
``Babe.''
<p>
   Praise is not universal from those who know their L.A. John
Gregory Dunne is a connoisseur of corruption. His novel, ``True
Confessions,'' is a definitive portrait of 1940s L.A., but the film
based on it was not. While admiring the acting here, he says,
``Corruption is a lot more subtle. Corrupt cops don't end up
running the mob, they work with the mob.''
<p>
   Nora Ephron, who grew up in L.A., says, ``Authentic or
inauthentic doesn't make any difference in film noir or in film.
It's the story. It's a movie.'' She also calls this movie
``wonderful.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- While a successful Teamsters
union strike last month was viewed as a comeback for U.S. labor,
turmoil surrounding President Ron Carey is casting doubt on its
future.
<p>
   Just weeks after the victory over United Parcel Service of
America Inc., a federal overseer became entangled in a fund-raising
scandal among Carey aides and resigned without ruling on Carey's
eligibility to run in a new, still unscheduled election.
<p>
   The problems raise questions for labor and for U.S. businesses,
primarily the trucking industry, which will face the union in
upcoming talks for a nationwide contract it needs to maintain
momentum while avoiding a walkout.
<p>
   In interviews, Carey said he plans to win another five-year
term, further his push to end union corruption and reverse a
two-decade decline in membership. His opponent, James P. Hoffa,
said he wants to return labor to the heyday of his famous father by
``restoring Teamster power'' and taking a more confrontational
approach with management.
<p>
   ``Carey looked good coming out of the UPS contract,'' in which
the union won almost every concession sought after the two-week
strike, said Michael Belzer, a labor relations professor at the
University of Michigan. Still, he said, Carey's future ``depends on
how badly he's tarnished'' by the funding scandal.
<p>
   The stakes are high because Carey is one of the most visible
symbols of labor's resurgence, along with AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney. While they have energized the labor movement by remaking
its image to attract members, Hoffa has focused primarily on
internal Teamsters union issues.
<p>
   The election will be a pivotal event in the history of the
largest U.S. private-industry union because a loss by Carey would
likely end its recent push to root out corruption in local offices,
Belzer said.
<p>
   The new vote was called after the federal election overseer,
Barbara Zack Quindel, threw out in late August the results of the
1996 Teamster election, in which Carey won 52 percent of the votes
cast. She ruled that Carey aides improperly diverted union money to
his campaign treasury.
<p>
   Quindel said Carey could be disqualified from the rerun if any
evidence is discovered showing he was involved in the
misappropriation. Earlier this week, Quindel recused herself from
the issue, saying new allegations in the matter involved a member
of her staff and a political organization to which she belongs.
<p>
   Her replacement must be appointed, which could push back by
months the new election. The successor must decide whether to bar
Carey from running again, which would likely lead to an easy Hoffa
victory.
<p>
   Uncertainty aside, the candidates are preparing to face off in
the new election, and want to use their philosophies on contract
talks affecting 296,000 trucking company employees.
<p>
   In an interview at union headquarters in Washington, Carey said
he will start the talks early with the group that represents the
truckers, Trucking Management Inc., to help reassure shippers of
the union's desire to reach an agreement.
<p>
   Carey said there are ``a lot of areas of concern'' in the
national agreement, especially in the area of part-time workers and
job losses.
<p>
   The union was able to restrict part-time jobs at UPS, which
makes it less likely that the long-haul trucking companies will
demand the right to hire more part-timers.
<p>
   The union is polling its members about their views and
objectives, he said, before it draws up its detailed negotiating
strategy and goals.
<p>
   Hoffa, son of the legendary Teamster leader who built the union
into a potent force before he was removed from office and jailed
for jury tampering, termed the 1994 long-haul contract negotiated
by Carey a terrible agreement for the union.
<p>
   In an interview at his union office in Detroit last week, Hoffa
said this is a good time to ``undo the damage'' of the old
agreement, when Carey ``caved in to management,'' because ``our
major carriers are making record profits.''
<p>
   Hoffa said the accord gave trucking firms too much sway over
driver work assignments and allowed too much diversion of business
to railroads. He wants to seek pensions after 25 years for
long-haul truckers and better health care.
<p>
   Demands in a new agreement would include a return of a concept
``my father pioneered, the right to strike over grievances,'' he
said. That right, which he said his father called ``the hammer,''
was negotiated away during the 1994 talks, in favor of a system of
arbitration for such disputes.
<p>
   Hoffa said he was confident he could negotiate ``an excellent
agreement without a strike.'' Still, he added, ``no one is ever
saying there won't be a strike'' until an accord is reached.
<p>
   The contract, called the National Master Freight Agreement,
directly sets wages, benefits and work rules for 136,000 long-haul
truckers around the U.S. The agreement, which expires at the end of
March, is used as a guide in setting compensation for another
160,000 Teamsters union members.
<p>
   When negotiations over the current accord broke down in 1994,
Carey led the Teamsters to a 24-day nationwide strike that crippled
the carriers, and led shippers to divert their freight to nonunion
companies.
<p>
   Trucking companies have good reason to be concerned about the
uncertainty surrounding the union leadership, analysts said. The
industry has been ``a horror movie for the past three or four
years,'' said James L. Winchester, a transportation analyst for
Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. ``Things seem to be improving, but from a
pretty low base.''
<p>
   Coupled with price wars that resulted from deregulation of the
industry, many long-haul trucking companies suffered losses in
1994, 1995 and 1996. With a stronger national economy and the end
of the shake-out that followed deregulation, many of the surviving
trucking companies are now profitable.
<p>
   In the three years after the strike, the four largest trucking
companies covered by the accord have lost about $260 million,
according to Traffic World, a trade magazine that covers the
freight industry.
<p>
   TMI officials refused to discuss their bargaining plans or
goals, saying they were waiting for their new executive director,
Timothy P. Lynch, to take office on Oct. 1.
<p>
   TMI negotiates for 24 trucking companies that employ about 75
percent of the Teamsters covered by the long-haul contract,
including the four largest, Yellow Corp., Roadway Express Inc.,
Consolidated Freightways Corp. and ABF Freight System Inc.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Few can play psycho and sleaze like Eric Roberts, with his crazy
eyes, his seething voice, and his bent nose. But in ``C-16,''
Roberts puts on a paternalistic beard and delivers lots of
meaningful eye contact to become the benevolent supervisor of a
high-stakes FBI squad. And he is surprisingly effective in the
role, just as ``C-16'' is a surprisingly good new show, even if TV
doesn't really need yet another prime-time ensemble crime drama.
The show premieres Saturday on NBC.
<p>
   Roberts is in charge of a band of L.A.-based agents who
specialize in the touchier kidnapping and terrorism cases. His
hand-picked ensemble, who know their way around sophisticated
equipment, includes a politically incorrect veteran, a reactive
agent in the middle of a divorce, and a pair of rookies, one of
whom grew up in L.A. and is saddled with a junkie brother. Think
``Mission: Impossible,'' but with a personal-life spin that's
become de riguer on the crime shows of the 1990s.
<p>
   Part of the fun is in watching the FBI play mind games and run
high-tech surveillance on the subjects of their investigations. In
tonight's episode, a divorced prosecutor's son is kidnapped, and
the team  &MD;  known as C-16  &MD;  is all over her for leads, dissecting
everything she says since she's a suspect without realizing it.
When she receives a ransom phonecall, C-16 computer-analyzes the
voice to determine the age, education, and emotional state of the
caller. It's kind of cool. Also tonight, Roberts nobly tries to
rescue a fellow agent who may have gone too deeply into his
dangerous undercover life, a sort of Kurtz of the porno-drug
underworld.
<p>
   There are a few missteps, particularly as the agents' private
lives intersect too conveniently with their cases. The divorcing
C-16er, for instance, has a powerful identification with the mother
of the kidnapped child that seems completely contrived. But there's
a lot of potential here, and some interesting new faces,
particularly Morris Chestnut as the rookie who can't shake his
past, and Zach Grenier as a tense agent returning from an
eight-month suspension. If ABC wanted to help ``C-16,'' not to
mention ``The Practice,'' it would move it off Saturday night. It
would also give the show a more adult time slot.

<p>
   Mexico City, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks rose for a
second day on investor optimism that lower local and U.S. interest
rates and a fast-growing economy will mean strong third-quarter
profits.
<p>
   The bolsa index, led by Kimberly-Clark de Mexico SA and
industrial group Alfa SA, rose 15.13, or 0.33 percent, to 5,245.74.
Kimberly Clark rose 6.5 percent to 39.6 pesos and Alfa climbed 1.3
percent to 72.6 pesos.
<p>
   ``Interest rates came down nicely and that gives investors some
comfort,'' said Thomas Tull, who manages $100 million with
Gulfstream Global Investors Ltd. in Dallas. ``And the economy still
looks pretty strong.''
<p>
   For the week, the index rose 129.95 points, or 2.54 percent.
<p>
   The benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent. Mexican rates often follow U.S. rates to
keep investors attracted to local securities.
<p>
   The yield on Mexico's benchmark 28-day Treasury bill sank 206
basis points to 16.91 percent in Tuesday's weekly government debt
auction. Lower rates can help company earnings by reducing
borrowing costs and spurring consumer spending and demand for
loans.
<p>
   The peso was unchanged at 12.80 U.S. cents after dropping more
than 1 percent from 12.94 cents Monday.
<p>
   Grocery and department store stocks rose on more signs of strong
growth in the domestic economy. Department store sales rose 16.3
percent in August from the year-earlier month, the biggest increase
since the December 1994 peso devaluation. Retail sales, which
include less expensive items, rose 5.3 percent.
<p>
   Grocery chain Grupo Gigante SA gained 0.3 percent to 3.5 and
competitor Controladora Comercial Mexicana SA climbed 0.8 percent
to 9.6 pesos. on the news.
<p>
   Cifra, the country's largest supermarket chain, rose 2.7 percent
to 16.8 pesos after Robert Fleming Inc. analyst Marc de Speville
and ING Barings Ltd. analyst Sebastian Barry-Taylor raised the
company's rating to a ``hold'' from a ``buy'' in separate reports.
<p>
   Traders are now looking to government reports on manufacturing
employment and compensation due for release at 5 p.m. local time (6
p.m. U.S. Eastern time).
<p>
   Grupo Industrial Saltillo SA, an auto parts and ceramic products
maker, fell 2.1 to 33.3 pesos in heavy activity after it began
trading 17.5 million new shares sold this week by the company and
shareholders. Investors exchanged 25.6 million Saltillo shares,
almost 40 times average volume during the last three months.
<p>
   Construction company Empresas ICA SA rose 1.6 percent to 22.25
pesos after Caspian Securities Inc. analysts Paul Rodriguez and
Sebastian Chatel rated the company ``market perform'' in new
coverage.
<p>
   Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA rose 1.5 percent to 23.95
pesos even after Santander Investment Securities Inc. analyst
Robert Lacoursiere lowered the country's largest banking group's
rating to ``market perform'' from ``buy.''
<p>
   Grupo Financiero Serfin SA, the third largest banking group,
fell 3.1 percent to 3 15/16 in New York trading after the
Monterrey-based newspaper El Norte reported the company plans to
sell its warehousing unit as part of an effort to raise money to
shore up its finances.
<p>
   Vitro SA, a large glass and appliance maker, fell 0.3 percent to
39.20 pesos after El Norte reported the company formed a joint
venture with General Electric Co. to make component parts for
turbines, generators and medical appliances as well as molds for
lighting products. The new company expects to have about $28
million in sales next year, the paper said, citing Ricardo
Gonzalez, director of Vitro's packaging division. TV Azteca SA's
shares in New York fell 0.3 percent to 22 1/2 as the television
broadcaster negotiates the size of the minority stake it might take
in a group planning to bid on a state-owned satellite company. The
group now includes silver producer Industrial Penoles SA,
Connecticut-based PanAmSat Corp. and cable company MVS
Comunicaciones SA.
<p>
   The Reforma newspaper quoted company officials as saying Azteca
might invest between $15 million and $20 million in the group .
<p>
   Penoles fell 1.4 percent to 35.1 pesos.
<p>
   Grupo Comercial Gomo SA, an importer of electronic appliances
and other electronic goods, gained the most during the day, rising
9.9 percent to 8.02 pesos.

<TEXT>
<p>
   ``Total Security'' arrives with the distinction of being The
Other Bochco, the season's Steven Bochco production that is not the
more hyped ``Brooklyn South.'' Premiering Saturday on ABC, ``Total
Security'' also has the distinction of being an unsuccessfully
oddball series that falls into that very hard-to-manage category
known as dramedy. One minute, a character is blowing off his own
head, the next we're laughing at co-star James Belushi's sexual
escapades among the lonely housewives of L.A. And the next minute,
we're wishing the creators of this show would find professional
help to resolve their split personality.
<p>
   The action is set at a private security firm in L.A., with an
ensemble of protection professionals who do everything from
installing alarm systems to running surveillance on criminals. The
head of the company is appealingly played by the sad-faced James
Remar, whose funereal mien keeps him central to the show's dramatic
plots. In tonight's episode, he witnesses a suicide and helps a
couple resolve their daughter's missing-persons case. One of his
detectives is played by Belushi as a loose-cannon whose sleazy
techniques make him a risky but beneficial addition to the firm. He
provides the comic relief, inconveniently falling into bed tonight
with a woman looking for a sophisticated alarm system.
<p>
   While ``Total Security'' should be praised for trying to do
something unpredictable with the tired hourlong ensemble format, it
nevertheless needs to work on its basics. As the show leaps from
drama to comedy, the soundtrack ranges awkwardly from heavy tension
to lightheartedness, and the narrative lurches unsatisfyingly from
plot to plot. Likewise, the purpose of the Total Security firm and
its employees could use sharpening.

<p>
   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The average price to a National
Hockey League game this season rose 6.4 percent from last year to
$40.78, according to a survey by Team Marketing Report.
<p>
   It marks the first time the average price for a ticket in a
major sports league has eclipsed the $40.00 mark, said the survey
conducted by the Chicago-based industry newsletter.
<p>
   The average ticket price in the National Football League this
season is the second most expensive at $38.09, followed by $34.08
for a National Basketball Association game last season and $11.98
for Major League Baseball.
<p>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins have the highest average ticket price at
$56.28. That's more than double the lowest average price of $25.50
offered by the Edmonton Oilers after the figure is converted to
U.S. currency.
<p>
   The Boston Bruins have the second highest average ticket price
behind the Penguins at $53.56, followed by the Philadelphia Flyers
at $52.75 and the New Jersey Devils at $50.60.
<p>
   Joining the Oilers offering less expensive ticket prices are the
Dallas Stars at $28.74 and Calgary Flames at $29.04, also adjusted
to U.S. currency.
<p>
   The newsletter also calculates the Fan Cost index, which
measures the total price for a family of four to attend a game.
<p>
   The most expensive is a Bruins game, where it costs $295.25 for
four tickets, four small soft drinks, two small beers, four hot
dogs, parking for one car, two game programs and two caps.
<p>
   The league-wide Fan Cost Index is $228.97, a 3.7 percent
increase over last year.
<p>
   For a family on a limited budget that can't afford nearly $300
an outing to a Bruins game, the newsletter also calculates the
Frugal Fan Index, which substitutes the cheapest tickets available
and eliminates the beers, programs and caps.
<p>
   The best bargain is a Flames game, which costs $50.22. A similar
no-frills trip to a Bruins game would cost $150, according to the
survey.

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks closed mixed,
with gains in Canadian Pacific Ltd. and oil issues tempered by
declining gold producers.
<p>
   Gold issues, which account for 6.8 percent of the benchmark
index, held back the broader market's advance after bullion fell
from its highest price in more than a month on weak demand for
jewelry, particularly in Japan and Southeast Asia.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery fell US$0.50 to US$329 an ounce on
the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex Division.
<p>
   The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 0.18 to
6975.90. Toronto is the second largest North American exchange in
terms of both volume and value.
<p>
   ``We had a rally in the last two-days in gold bullion, but it
looks like it has lost its legs and in the short term we see no
serious rebound in either bullion or the shares of producers,''
said Andre Chabot, a vice-president of Magna Vista Capital
Management Inc., which has C$890 million (US$641 million) in
assets.
<p>
   Placer Dome Inc. fell C$0.30 to C$24.40, Barrick Gold Corp. slid
C$0.35 to C$32.55 and TVX Gold Corp. dropped C$0.20 to C$7.50 paced
the sub-group's fall.
<p>
   Paper stocks like Avenor Inc., down C$0.80 to C$25.05, fell as
lumber for November delivery declined US$7.70 to US$298.60 a metric
ton on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Investors were also cautious ahead of a Federal Reserve policy
meeting on Tuesday when interest rates may be raised, analysts
said. Canada is directly affected by any U.S. economic change
because the countries are each other's largest trading partners.
<p>
   ``It's a mixed bag as the gold sector has backed off and
investors are taking some profits on financial-services stocks, but
there is really nothing that stands out,'' said Fred Ketchen, a
senior trader with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. ``The market is marking time
ahead of Tuesday's meeting and some people are concerned the Fed
will raise rates.''
<p>
   Any rise in interest rates by the Fed may be matched by the Bank
of Canada to keep the currency competitive. Ranger Oil Ltd. and
Elan Energy Inc. were among the most active after Ranger said it
purchased 490,000 common shares of Elan at an average price of
C$9.90 a share. Elan gained C$0.25 to C$10.20 and it was the most
actively traded stock on 5.2 million shares, while Ranger rose
C$0.40 to C$12.65 on 1.88 million shares.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. lost C$0.10 to C$13 on 4.17 mllion
shares traded after it said it will price an initial public
offering of its Gulf Indonesia Resources Ltd. subsidiary on Monday,
then list the shares the next day on the New York Stock Exchange.
Canadian Pacific Ltd. rose C$0.50 to C$41 to help offset decliners.
<p>
   ``There is a general optimism around the stock and when an
international investor wants to buy a piece of Canada, CP is one of
the stocks he buys,'' said Steve Bokor, a portfolio manager with
Majendie Charlton Securities Ltd.
<p>
   Canadian Pacific, which accounts for 2.6 percent of the
benchmark index, has interests ranging from rail and shipping to
energy.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. rose C$2.80 to C$33.30 on 2.9 million shares traded
after falling 32 percent yesterday when the software maker warned
growth will slow because customers are delaying purchases.
<p>
   On the broader market, advancing issues outpaced decliners 521
to 473, with 305 unchanged. More than 105.5 million shares changed
hands compared with a three-month average of 97.1 million shares.
The exchange reported trades valued at C$1.6 billion.
<p>
   The Montreal Stock Exchange rose 3.72 points to 3419.50. For the
week, it fell 6.11 points.
<p>
   The Vancouver Stock Exchange, where most Canadian junior
resource companies trade, climbed 3.26 points to 813.43. For the
week, it rose 3.62 points.
<p>
   Financial services issues helped stem the decline as the yield
on Canada's benchmark 30-year bond fell 4 basis points to 6.28.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after a revised U.S. economic report showed
growth with little inflation. Banks, which compete with bonds for
investors' attention because they both pay steady dividends,
typically gain as bond yields decline.
<p>
   Bank of Nova Scotia gained C$0.35 to C$64.95 and AGF Management
Ltd. Class B gained C$4.50 to C$65.50 while Mackenzie Financial
Corp. jumped C$0.85 to C$37.80.
<p>
   In other stock activity, United Dominion Industries Ltd. rose
C$0.15 to C$39.40 after it announced the purchase of two companies
that manufacture and recondition equipment for the ice-cream
industry.
<p>
   United Dominion said it will buy Philadelphia-based Processing
Machinery &AMP; Supply Co. and New Jersey-based Alliance Food Equipment
Corp. for an undisclosed amount.
<p>
   Air Canada gained C$0.75 to C$13.15 to lead transport issues
higher after it said it will follow the lead of U.S. carriers and
reduce commissions paid to travel agents on tickets purchased for
all international flights in an effort to cut costs.
<p>
   Linamar Corp. fell C$5 to C$83 after news Larry Pearson had
retired as company president.

<p>
   CALIFORNIA -- ELNINO. (Held from yesterday.) Rep. Zoe Lofgren,
D-San Jose, agreed not to push for more El Nino research funding
late Thursday on the condition that House Leadership agree to add
the funding when the House and Senate write the final version of
the Commerce Department spending package. Zaret
<p>
   -- SPECIES. The first endangered species bill in nearly a decade
to have the full support of environmentalists may be in danger of
extinction. Rep. George Miller, D-Richmond, authored a bill in July
that would replace the 24-year-old Endangered Species Act with a
new plan -- one that environmentalists rallied behind. But the
House Resource Committee has no plans to look at the bill before
the session ends in November -- and possibly ever. Meanwhile, the
Senate has a bill of their own that has been supported by just
about everyone -- but the environmentalists. Zaret
<p>
   -- LEADER. Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, has only been in
the House for nine months, but she is already being named as one of
the possible successors to Rep. Barbara Kenelly, D-Conn., in House
Democratic leadership. Zaret
<p>
   CONNECTICUT -- WAYS. With Rep. Barbara Kennelly launching her
bid for governor, Connecticut is losing a powerful voice on the
influential, tax-writing Ways and Means committee. How will the
delegation work to ensure Connecticut doesn't lose its clout in the
next Congress? Kane
<p>
   FLORIDA -- HILL. Goss and Miller talk about IRS abuses and ways
to curb them. Also about Florida's chances of getting a better
share of transportation funding now that a federal reauthorization
bill has been kicked back until next year. Bryant
<p>
   GEORGIA -- SWAMP. U.S. Rep. Saxby Chambliss will lead a
delegation of Georgia congressmen to the annual Okefenokee Festival
next month to drum up support for improvements to the largest
national wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. (Working.)
Williams
<p>
   -- TELMED. The Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center will get
less than half of the federal funding it requested for telemedicine
research next year, congressional aides said Friday. (Working.)
Williams
<p>
   KANSAS -- ROAD. The clock is ticking as the House and Senate
wrangle over transportation spending. With less than a week to go
before the old budget expires, how will Kansas fare? Not too badly,
as it turns out. Brooks
<p>
   MAINE -- REFORM. A group of would-be House campaign reformers
stood behind the Senate's McCain-Feingold proposal Friday, joining
Maine's two freshmen lawmakers, Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Tom
Allen, in their fight to remove large ``soft-money'' contributions
from the system. Kane
<p>
   OHIO -- ROAD. The clock is ticking as the House and Senate
wrangle over transportation spending. With less than a week to go
before the old budget expires, how will Ohio fare? Brooks
<p>
   OKLAHOMA -- MEMORIAL; Congress passed a final bill establishing
the Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial on Thursday. The bill now goes
to President Clinton to be signed into law.
<p>
   SOUTH CAROLINA -- SRS. A preliminary analysis shows that the
U.S. Department of Energy will lay off no more than 250 employees
at DOE complexes across the nation, including the Savannah River
Site, during the fiscal year that starts next week. The department
had been facing up to 1,500 layoffs under a worst-case scenario.
(Working.) Williams
<p>
   TEXAS -- FARM. In the wake of Dolly the cloned sheep and other
highly visible successes of biotechnology, new efforts in Congress
are focusing on making agricultural research more dynamic. U.S.
Rep. Larry Combest, R-Lubbock, is spearheading a move to
restructure the way the U.S. Department of Agriculture doles out
research funds for schools across the country. Egbert
<p>
   WISCONSIN -- RIVER. Wisconsin lawmakers procured additional
federal funding this week for the Upper Mississippi River, which
will keep jobs in the area and allow local environmental
organizations to continue with their conservation efforts.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose with bonds on
a government report showing economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 74.17,
or 1 percent, to 7922.18.
<p>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index gained 7.31, or 0.8 percent, to
945.22, led by banks and drug companies. Falling interest rates
boost demand for bank loans, while steady-growing companies such as
drugmakers are attractive when bond yields become less competitive.
<p>
   Even after today's rise, the Dow average was little changed for
the week, up less than 5 points, and 4.1 percent below its Aug. 6
record. Any further gains depend on a bond market rally, investors
said.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million money
management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent, about where it was on Monday. A 52-week low
of 6.30 percent was reached on July 31.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.35, or 0.2 percent, to
1682.24, up less than 2 points for the week. Concern about slow
sales at Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Xilinx Inc. and other
specialty chipmakers kept the index from rising much today.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 13/16 to 113 15/16, leading a bank rally.
Chase Manhattan Corp. gained 1 7/8 to 117 3/8 and First Chicago NBD
Corp. climbed 1 7/8 to 75 5/8.
<p>
   Among securities stocks, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. surged 3 1/16 to 73
5/16, Lehman Brothers Inc. gained 1 to 52 1/4 and A.G. Edwards Inc.
gained 1 9/16 to 49 3/4. Brokerages have jumped since Travelers
Inc. said it would pay $9 billion in stock for Salomon Brothers
Inc. on Wednesday.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after the government said the economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported, while
inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   Perhaps more than profits and interest rates, the strength of
the U.S. currency provides the best hint as to the path of stocks
in coming weeks and months, said Kenneth L. Fisher, president of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, California, with $1.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   U.S. stocks attracted foreign investors in the past year as the
dollar rose 15 percent against the German mark, the benchmark
currency for Europe. The Dow industrials climbed 35 percent in that
period, rising in tandem with the dollar 60 percent of the time.
The dollar and the Dow both peaked Aug. 6, and have since declined.
<p>
   Signs that Europe's economy is accelerating would weaken the
dollar and may signal the end of the past few years of big gains in
U.S. stocks; the Dow doubled in a 31-month period.
<p>
   ``The explanation in the weeks ahead will come out of keeping an
eye on the dollar,'' Fisher said.
<p>
   Fisher said he is sticking with international U.S. companies
such as DuPont Co. and Merck &AMP; Co., which receive the bulk of
international funds. If he sees signs of growth oversees, he would
trim his U.S. holdings and would load up on non-U.S. giants like
Siemens AG and Sony Corp.
<p>
   Today, international drugmakers were a big hit with investors.
Merck gained 1 1/16 to 100 3/16, Pfizer Inc. rose 1 1/8 to 61 and
Warner-Lambert Co. rose 2 15/16 to 133 3/4.
<p>
   Initial offerings also made a splash, suggesting money managers
have plenty of money to put to work.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications Inc. surged 6 1/4 to 23 1/4 in its first
day of trading as investors bet that the cachet of cellular pioneer
Craig McCaw will mean success for his new local phone company.
<p>
   Network Solutions Inc., which designates domain names for
Internet sites, jumped 5 5/16 to 23 5/16 in first-day trading.
<p>
   Lattice Semiconductor tumbled 4 7/8 to 64 1/2, leading a decline
in chipmakers as weak orders were seen hurting third-quarter
results. Xilinx dropped 1 5/16 to 50 and Altera Corp. fell 1 1/4 to
53 3/4.
<p>
   Investors said that while they expect most companies to deliver
strong earnings, the results may not have enough punch to drive
stocks higher.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting that the current
quarter's earnings may be weaker than expected.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 9 to 24 1/2.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, fell
1/2 to 11 after saying it could report a loss for the fiscal second
quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the year-ago
period.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 1 1/4 to 57 5/16 after it said
third-quarter earnings will be about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected and
declined 3/4 to 19 7/16.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, fell 3 3/8 to 10 after warning
that it expects earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less
than the year-ago 51 cents a share because of production and
shipment delays.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 4
1/2 to 25 1/2 on renewed concern that its major customers are
suffering technical problems in building cutting-edge microchip
production tools that use Cymer's lasers. Cymer has fallen 44
percent in September.
<p>
   Eastman Kodak Co. rose 1 5/8 to 64 1/16 after announcing it will
fire about 10 percent of its clerical staff and 20 percent of its
managers in a move to boost profits.
<p>
   Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. gained 2 5/8 to 90 7/16
after Cowen &AMP; Co. raised its investment opinion from ``neutral'' to
``strong buy,'' citing accelerating growth and improved margins.

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks rose on low
volume, led by utility and telephone stocks, amid optimism that
slower economic growth and lower bond yields in the U.S. will
stimulate equity investment in emerging markets, as well as the
U.S.
<p>
   ``When there's no news, the first thing that people look at is
what's going on in other markets,'' said Flavio Menezes, who
manages $350 million in equities at Banco Patrimonio de
Investimento SA in Sao Paulo. ``If stocks rise in the U.S., then
Brazil becomes cheap, and stocks here tend to move up too.''
<p>
   Sao Paulo's Bovespa index rose 123 points, or 1.08 percent, to
11518 points. Telebras, Brazil's most actively traded stock, added
1.3 reais, or 0.95 percent, to 138 reais.
<p>
   Trading volume was low. Shares worth about 400 million reais
($365 million) changed hands on the Sao Paulo exchange, roughly a
third of the daily average volume in June.
<p>
   ``The market's in a holding pattern,'' said Menezes. Investors
could break out of the holding pattern, he said, once the
government releases its game plan for the sale of Telebras and
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, the holding company for the
state-controlled utilities. Next week, Communications Minister
Sergio Motta is expected to unveil the model for the sale of the
Telebras system. That will revive investor interest and could usher
in a stock price rally, he said.
<p>
   The government is expected to group Telebras' 27 operating
companies into three or four regional phone companies before
selling the parts. Embratel, the long distance company, is expected
to be sold separately.
<p>
   Last week, Motta said the government would likely spin off
cellular telephone services and group them into nine regional
companies, coinciding with the concession areas for a competing
cellular service on a separate bandwidth for which the government
began selling licenses in June.
<p>
   Brazil hopes to raise an estimated 17 billion reais from the
sale of controlling stakes in Brazilian phone companies. Sales are
expected to get under way in the first half of 1998.
<p>
   Telebras, with a market capitalization of more than $40 billion,
is one of the largest telephone companies in the world, ranking
ahead of Deutsche Telekom and just behind British Telecom, which
has a total market capitalization of $42.9 billion.
<p>
   Caspian Securities analyst Joanne Showalter reiterated a ``buy''
recommendation on Telebras, setting a 1998 target price of $175 for
Telebras shares traded on the New York stock exchange. In New York,
Telebras shares rose 1 3/16 to 126 3/16.
<p>
   Other telephone stocks rose. Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo,
Telebras' largest regional subsidiary and Latin America's second
largest phone company after Telebras, rose 5 reais, or 1.6 percent,
to 320 reais.
<p>
   Telesp is expected to be the first of the Telebras companies to
be sold next year. The stock is 43 percent this year and nearly 97
percent over the past 12 months.
<p>
   Another Telebras subsidiary, Telecomunicacoes do Parana SA, the
Parana state operator, rose 10 reais, or 1.27 percent, to 800
reais. Cia. Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes, which is controlled
by the Rio Grande do Sul state government, rose 3.1 reais, or 2.14
percent, to 148 reais. Caspian Securities reiterated ``buy''
recommendations on both Telepar and CRT.
<p>
   Utility stocks helped lift the Bovespa, accounting for five of
the top 10 movers. The Bovespa electricity index, which tracks the
13 most actively traded utility stocks, outperformed the general
index, rising 1.27 percent to 3245 points.
<p>
   Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, which accounts for 13 percent
of the country's electricity sales, was the biggest gainer among
utilities. Preferred shares rose 2.2 reais, or 3.9 percent, to 58.2
reais, while common shares rose 1.99 reais, or 4.15 percent, to
49.99 reais.
<p>
   The utility, which sold a 33 percent stake to a group led by AES
Corp. of the U.S. in May, was given a ``recommend list'' rating
this week by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the securities' firm's
highest rating.
<p>
   Patrimonio's Menezes favors Cemig because of the utility's
chances of expansion through acquisition. The company, which is
controlled by the Minas Gerais state government, created a separate
investment company called Cemigpar to participate in the
privatization of neighboring power companies, Menezes said.
<p>
   Advancers outnumbered decliners 35 to 6 among the 51 shares that
make up the Bovespa index. Ten shares were unchanged.
<p>
   Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Paulista, or Cosipa, was the day's
biggest gainer, adding 4 centavos, or 7 percent to 61 centavos.
Banco Itau SA, Brazil's second-largest investor-owned bank,
registered the second biggest advance, rising 30 reais, or 4.7
percent, to 670 reais.

   Buenos Aires, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Argentine shares rose as
investors snapped up Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata SA and Banco
de Galicia y Buenos Aires SA, whose shares appeared attractive
compared with those to be sold by a rival bank.
<p>
   Both banks declined in recent weeks, as investors cleared space
in their portfolios for the new shares to be sold by Banco Rio de
la Plata SA.
<p>
   ``Rio's a leading bank; when you add something like that to the
market things have to be reevaluated,'' said Sergio Galvan, who
manages $80 million for Bansud SA..
<p>
   The Merval index of the 27 most traded shares rose 0.94 percent
to 825.91, the biggest gain in eight days. Seventeen shares rose,
three went unchanged and seven declined.
<p>
   The general index of all sharers traded rose 1.07 percent to
24,864.41.
<p>
   Strong growth within Argentina's banking industry and a limited
number of top-tier banks to choose from caused shares to rise to
expensive levels, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Daniel
Tassan-Din.
<p>
   The sale of Banco Rio, controlled by Banco Santander SA of
Spain, will offer investors another option, he said. Banco Rio is
expected to sell 79.35 million shares, or 26 percent of its
outstanding shares, for between 7.0 pesos and 8.5 pesos each on
Oct. 9.
<p>
   Banco Frances shares fell 20 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 23 while Banco Galicia fell 14 percent during the month
ending Sept. 23. That left prices at attractive levels, said
Tassan-Din.
<p>
   ``When relating prices to performance of loan portfolios and
total assets, the three are much closer to par now,'' he said.
``Value-wise you can no longer say that Rio is better.''
<p>
   The upcoming Banco Rio shares had been considered a better value
in part because Rio has a better safeguard against its
non-performing loans. About 110 percent of its non-performing loans
are covered by a special fund, as compared to Galicia's 65 percent
and Frances's 79 percent, said Tassan-Din. That allows shares to
trade at a relatively higher price.
<p>
   Banco Rio shares are expected to sell at between 2.6 and 2.9
times book value, or assets minus liabilities, said Galvan. Frances
trades at about 2.4 times book value, while Galicia at about 2.3.
<p>
   Banco Frances led banks, rose 1.93 percent to 10.55 pesos
($10.55). Banco Galicia rose 3.93 percent to 7.4 pesos, while
Bansud SA climbed 0.74 percent to 13.6 pesos.
<p>
   Steel shares also rallied, as steel production figures for
August showed that an industrial boom isn't slowing. Crude steel
production was 1.6 percent higher than in August 1996, the
Argentine Steel Industry Association said.
<p>
   Output of hot and cold rolled sheets of steel rose 9.1 percent
and 18.7 percent respectively. That led steel sheet producer
Siderar to climb 5.31 percent to 5.55 pesos.
<p>
   Santander Investments Securities analyst Andres Biolcati raised
his recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from ``market perform.''
<p>
   Siderca SA, which makes steel pipes used to transport petroleum
and gas, rose 2.05 percent to 2.98 pesos. Acindar Industria
Argentina de Aceros SA, which makes long steel used in
construction, rose 2.30 percent to 3.11 pesos.
<p>
   ``Argentina is in the building and development cycle of economic
growth. We continue to like the steel companies because they
continue to be key,'' said Leandro Sarave, who manages $140 million
at Deutsche Bank in Argentina.
<p>
   Other gainers included YPF SA, which rose 1.92 percent to 37.15
pesos, a record.
<p>
   Agriculture company Cresud Sacifya and real estate developer
IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones SA also rose after newspaper
Clarin reported that land prices rose as much as 70 percent this
year. Both companies have aggressively increased their land
holdings this year.
<p>
   IRSA rose 0.23 percent to 4.44 pesos, while Cresud rose 3.35
percent to 2.16 pesos. Hedge fund manager George Soros has stakes
in each.
<p>
   Telefonica de Argentina SA rose 2.75 percent to 3.73 pesos,
while Telecom Argentina Stet France Telecom SA rose 2.92 percent to
6.0 pesos.

 &UR; N.Y.C.'S LHOTA WALKS FINE LINE ON TFA PRICING: BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Tom Cahill &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- New York City will walk a fine
line when it prices $650 million in bonds for its newest borrowing
authority, said Joe Lhota, the city's budget director.
<p>
   The city on Wednesday brings out its first Transitional Finance
Authority securities in a sale handled by Lehman Brothers. The new
borrowing agency circumvents a New York City debt ceiling and
allows it to continue its capital spending program for repairs to
roads, bridges and schools.
<p>
   The sale is widely expected to be a blockbuster because the TFA
bonds are rated stronger than the city's existing debt and the
organization is sought after as a new borrowing authority. Still,
getting the best price, without alienating future buyers, will be
difficult.
<p>
   ``It's important for an issuer to be as aggressive as possible
in getting the best possible price,'' Lhota, who also chairs the
TFA, told the Bloomberg Forum. ``But there is obviously a point at
which you can destroy your marketing going into the future.''
<p>
   Lhota said the city has to be careful not to price the bonds so
high that they leave a bad taste in investors' mouths.
<p>
   ``We've got $7.5 billion to sell over the next three or four
years,'' Lhota said. ``I want to enter the market in the right way
-- I don't want to enter in a way that people remember they were
hurt.''
<p>
   He said next Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting
will make the pricing particularly tricky. The FOMC, an arm of the
Federal Reserve, will be considering interest rate policy that day.
<p>
   He also wants to make sure the bonds are all sold before Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish new year holiday, that starts at sundown
Wednesday.
<p>
   Lhota wouldn't tip his hand exactly how the city will price the
bonds, which he said represent the strongest credit in New York.
<p>
   ``What you'll see is a solid pricing,'' Lhota said. ``Aggressive
so the city is satisfied, but also so investors are satisfied,'' he
said.
<p>
   The sale comes just weeks after Moody's Investors Service Inc.
took the unusual step of revising its debt ratings for the TFA
after the city complained and altered the agency's structure.
<p>
   The TFA is rated ``Aa3'' by Moody's, two notches above its
initial rating of ``A2.'' The debt is rated ``AA'' by Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp., ``AA+'' by Fitch Investors Service and ``AAA'' by
Duff &AMP; Phelps.
<p>
   Lhota bristled at the suggestion of some critics that the rating
may be inflated.
<p>
   ``It's clearly not a gift to the city,'' Lhota said. ``We worked
hard to structure a financing with the best possible security for
bondholders. When those folks take a look at the coverage, they
will realize its a solid ``AA'' credit,'' Lhota said.
<p>
   The sale comes as the city's image has taken a new shine with
investors. Its new issues have been selling at the best prices in
almost a decade, thanks in part to an economic renaissance fueled
partly by gains on Wall Street.
<p>
   Because the city's fortunes are so closely tied to Wall
Street's, Lhota said he watched recent news with mixed reactions.
<p>
   On the one hand, Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co. and
Goldman Sachs Group LP reported third-quarter earnings rose more
than 50 percent on booming profits. On the other, Travelers Group
Inc. said it would buy Salomon Inc., likely causing the loss of as
much as 1,500 high-paying jobs.
<p>
   ``It's been a double edged sword, while we've had some good news
in that there is an increase in profitability on Wall Street
there's also some negative news in that we're going to be losing
some jobs,'' Lhota said. ``That's never a good thing for the city
of New York.''
<p>
   He said it was too early to see what the impact would be on New
York City and said revenue projections are now on target.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Latin American Brady bonds
rose on expectations that stable, low-inflation growth in Latin
America will continue.
<p>
   ``Latin America is receiving a Good Housekeeping Seal of
approval from the Internternational Monetary Fund,'' said Pedro
Coulchinsky, a bond trader at Inverworld Securities Inc. in San
Antonio, Texas.
<p>
   The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, recently concluded its
annual meeting in Hong Kong. ``The IMF basically said that Latin
America was keeping its promises and meeting their economic
targets,'' Coulchinski said. ``There's a general bullishness about
Latin America.''
<p>
   Brazilian capitalization bonds rose to 85.06 bid and 85.31
offered from 84.50 bid and 84.62 yesterday to yield 10.12 percent.
<p>
   Venezuelan par bonds rose to 87.88 bid and 88.13 offered from
87.44 bid and 87.69 offered yesterday to yield 7.90 percent after
the U.S. Treasury collateral is stripped out.
<p>
   Mexican par bonds rose to 83.00 bid and 83.25 offered from 82.62
bid and 82.88 offered yesterday to yield a stripped 7.87 percent.
<p>
   Brady bonds also got a lift from gains in the U.S. debt that
backs them.
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year U.S. treasury rose as 5/8 to 100 1/4,
pushing its yield down 5 basis points to 6.35 percent. Earlier
today the U.S. Commerce department said the U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter, down from its
previous estimate of 3.6 percent.
<p>
   Lower growth figures reduce concern about inflation, which erode
the value of interest payments on most bonds.
<p>
   Brady bonds are backed by zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities.
As a result they tend to rise and fall with the U.S. bonds.
<p>
   Latin American countries first issued Brady bonds in 1990 as
part of a conversion of bank debt into bonds.
<p>
   In other emerging market debt the Russian Vnescheconombank said
it reconciled 90 percent of its $35 billion in debts and past-due
interest it owes commercial bank creditors. Vnesheconombank is
Russia's state bank for foreign economic relations.
<p>
   Russia expects to sign the agreement with creditor banks Oct. 6.
The debt originated with bank loans to the former Soviet Union.
<p>
   Vnescheconombank certificates, which will eventually be
converted into new Russian debt, rose to 103.50 bid and 104.00
offered.

 &UR; U.S. COMMODITIES: CRUDE SURGES ON COLOMBIAN PIPELINE BOMBING &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil surged to a
four-month high after the bombing of a Colombian pipeline raised
concern that exports to the U.S. could be disrupted at a time of
low inventories.
<p>
   Elsewhere, wheat slid as Australia sold grain to Pakistan. Cocoa
also dropped. The Commodity Research Bureau index fell 0.27 to
242.72, while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index
rose 0.82, or 0.4 percent, to 203.88.
<p>
   The bombing was the 51st this year and came just two days after
state oil company Ecopetrol repaired the line from the previous
attack. The attacks are coming with U.S. crude oil inventories
lagging year-ago levels by 2.7 percent, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Colombia is the ninth-largest oil exporter to
the U.S.
<p>
   Prices rose in early trading as investors who follow charts for
technical evidence of market direction took four consecutive days
of gains as a signal to buy futures contracts.
<p>
   ``The pipeline news has added to today's gains,'' said Steve
Bellino, a senior trader at ABN Amro Chicago Corp. in New York.
<p>
   Crude oil for November delivery rose 48 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $20.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
for a contract closest to expiration since June 2. Crude prices
gained 7.9 percent this week.
<p>
   The jump in crude pulled heating oil higher. October heating oil
rose 1.41 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 57.92 cents a gallon. Heating
oil prices have risen in recent days as forecasts for cooler
weather in the U.S. Northeast prompted speculators and oil
marketers to buy contracts.
<p>
   Still, many oil traders expressed surprise at today's rise,
since distillate supplies, which include home heating oil, are 20
percent above year-ago levels, according to the API.
<p>
   Wheat dropped to a two-month low after Pakistan bought twice as
much wheat from Australia as from the U.S., signaling rising
competition on the world market.
<p>
   Pakistan purchased 400,000 metric tons of Australian wheat and
only 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat in a tender yesterday,
according to a U.S.-based official of the Australian Wheat Board.
Speculation also swept the market that Egypt, one of the world's
largest buyers, could soon buy wheat from France, traders said.
<p>
   Competition is increasing on the world wheat market as the
European Union, collectively the world's largest exporter,
completed its harvest. Also, recent rains have revived the wheat
crop in Australia, the world's fourth-largest exporter.
<p>
   ``The main reason for the weakness in the market is the Pakistan
tender,'' said Paul Koltek, a wheat trader at United Grain Corp., a
Portland, Oregon-based wheat exporting firm. ``The trade in general
anticipated there would be a lot more done from the U.S.''
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$3.5725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the contract's
lowest since July 21.
<p>
   Cocoa prices fell amid speculation that crops in West Africa, in
the early stages of harvest, suffered less damaged than expected
from dry weather.
<p>
   Last year, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower,
produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa. Estimates for this
year's harvest are as low as 850,000 tons on expectations that
unusually dry weather damaged the crop.
<p>
   Now, recent rains are leading traders to revise their forecasts.
Since the bulk of harvesting won't take place until November, the
moisture will have time to reinvigorate the crop.
<p>
   Better-than-expected weather ``may mean that less of the crop
was damaged and (it) should come in close to about 1 million
tons,'' said Walter Spilka, a commodity analyst at Smith Barney
Inc. in New York.
<p>
   Cocoa for December delivery fell $35, or 2.1 percent, to $1,668
a metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.
<p>
   In other growing regions, including Indonesia, weather
conditions remain dry, increasing the likelihood that global cocoa
harvests will be low.

<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Carpenter
Technology Corp. agreed to buy Talley Industries Inc. for $312
million in cash and assumed debt, obtaining one of its suppliers of
stainless steel.
<p>
   Carpenter offered $12 for each of Talley's common shares, $11.70
a share for its series A preferred and $16 for series B preferred.
The cash portion of the transaction is about $185 million.
<p>
   The $12 offer is 30 percent more than Talley's average share
price over the last three months. A dissident group of Talley
shareholders criticized the offer as inadequate.
<p>
   ``A share price that hasn't been seen since 1989 is a very, very
fair valuation,'' Carpenter Chairman and Chief Executive Robert
Cardy said. Carpenter, a maker of stainless steel and titanium
alloys, wants Talley's stainless steel production and distribution
businesses, which already are Carpenter suppliers, he said.
<p>
   Carpenter will increase its existing credit agreement with five
banks to $400 million from $150 million, and issue short-term debt
backed by the agreement to pay for the shares, Chief Financial
Officer Walt Cottrell said.
<p>
   Once the transaction is completed, Carpenter will issue $100
million in common stock to raise money to pay off the debt,
Cottrell added.
<p>
   Moody's Investors Service said it may reduce its `A3' rating on
Carpenter's senior unsecured debt if the transaction occurs. It
also said the `B2' rating on Talley's senior unsecured debt may be
raised.
<p>
   The acquisition would reduce the company's earnings for the
fiscal year ending June 30 by three percent to four percent, then
boost earnings in subsequent years, Cardy said.
<p>
   Talley shares rose 1 1/8 to 12 9/16 in trading of 1.17 million
shares, 29 times their three-month average daily volume. Carpenter
shares rose 1 1/4 to 47 9/16.
<p>
   Some Talley shareholders spurned Carpenter's offer.
<p>
   ``The breakup value of the company is significantly higher,''
said William Danzell, a leader of the dissident shareholders, who
control 10.3 percent of Talley's common stock.
<p>
   Danzell said his group will oppose Carpenter's bid. The group
forced Talley's former chief executive, William Mallender, to
resign in June.
<p>
   In a statement, Carpenter said a majority of Talley's shares
must be pledged in favor of its offer by Oct. 30 for the
transaction to proceed.
<p>
   Reading, Pennsylvania-based Carpenter's revenue for the fiscal
year ended June 30 was $939 million. Talley's stainless steel
production and distribution businesses generated $136.3 million of
its total $502.7 million in revenue last year.
<p>
   Talley, based in Phoenix, also makes inflation devices for air
bags, welding equipment and power supply systems, and provides
engineering advice to shipbuilders. In a statement, Carpenter said
those businesses would be sold after the acquisition is completed.
Credit Suisse First Boston would help find buyers, the company
said.
<p>
   Carpenter added it expects its earnings per share for the fiscal
first quarter ending Sept. 30 to be between 75 cents and 80 cents,
in line with analysts' expectations. For the same quarter last
year, the earnings per share totaled 45 cents.

<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  On Jan. 1, when electricity markets in California and
Rhode Island are thrown open to competition, consumers can expect
only small discounts and a big list of problems.
<p>
   Despite years of planning, observers say consumers likely will
find the advent of electric deregulation in those states will bring
on difficulties ranging from billing and metering errors to con
artists out to cash in on an atmosphere of uncertainty.
<p>
   California consumers initially will not reap the savings
promised by deregulation supporters because their bills will
include a payment to cover the utility companies' $7.3 billion in
``stranded costs.'' This payment equals the cost of power plants
built by the state's utilities that cannot generate power cheaply
enough to compete.
<p>
   The experience in these states  &MD;  particularly California  &MD;  will
influence the pace at which regulators and lawmakers in other
states will open their markets. Should major problems develop in
the first states to deregulate, other states are certain to take a
more cautious approach.
<p>
   Texas state Sen. Jerry Patterson, a Republican, said no matter
how things go in California, it will push Texas and the rest of the
nation one step closer to open power markets.
<p>
   ``It should be positive for efforts to deregulate electricity in
Texas,'' Patterson said, predicting that Texas markets will likely
open up to competition and consumer choice on Jan. 1, 2001.
<p>
   Over the long haul, the competition brought on by deregulation
of the utility business is supposed to drive down prices and lead
to a quicker introduction of new services.
<p>
   On Jan. 1, consumers in California and Rhode Island will be able
to choose their power company. Consumers in these states already
are the target of a marketing blitz.
<p>
   A horde of companies will be competing for that business.
<p>
   So far, 116 different companies have registered with the
California Public Utilities Commission to sell power to consumers
and business.
<p>
   With numerous details yet to be resolved  &MD;  things such as
billing, metering, order processing, software  &MD;  Nettie Hoge,
executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San
Francisco-based consumer group, questions whether the many entities
involved in the transition to competition in California, including
utilities, regulators and private companies, will be ready in less
than four months.
<p>
   Consumer advocates in California warn people to be wary of deals
that sound too good to be true.
<p>
   Wayne Brown, chief executive of Austin, Texas-based Planergy,
believes that the market is not ready for full-fledged competition
and that consumers will be misled until they understand exactly
where the touted savings on their bill will come.
<p>
   ``There are some folks who are misleading people are far as
potential savings,'' said Brown, whose company is hoping to sell
California consumers energy services such as appliance warranties
and help in choosing a supplier.
<p>
   ``We see more confusion during this transition period and not a
lot of opportunity for significant reductions. We think that many
residents will stay with their traditional supplier during the
early stages of this,'' he added.
<p>
   Steven Kean, senior vice president of government affairs at
Houston-based Enron Corp., said electric utilities in California
are intentionally trying to mislead people into not choosing
alternative suppliers when they are given a choice.
<p>
   Southern California Edison is advising its customers to do
nothing, Kean said, explaining that if these customers do not make
a choice of supplier when given the opportunity, their service will
default to the electric utility serving the Los Angeles area.
<p>
   Competitors will only be able to offer limited reductions
because the portion of a California residential bill that includes
the market price of power is a small percentage of the overall
bill, leaving marketers little leeway to offer significant
reductions and still remain competitive, Hoge said.
<p>
   On an average residential power bill in Northern California, the
resident will pay about 12 cents per kilowatt hour beginning Jan.
1.
<p>
   That pays for about 4.7 cents per kilowatt hour for transition
to competition costs  &MD;  or stranded costs  &MD;  a half-cent for social
programs to educate consumers, 3.4 cents for distribution services,
a half-cent for transmission and about 2.9 cents for power
generation.
<p>
   The generation cost is where the savings from competition is
supposed to show up on the bill.
<p>
   ``I am starting to feel that if people out there are offering
big reductions for customers to switch, they are probably going to
be fraudulent,'' Hoge said. ``We have had one instance of a
marketer already offering a 10 percent reduction as of Jan. 1 if
you sign with them, sounding as though you have to go through their
magic wand to get the reduction when it is already guaranteed by
statute. If that's not fraud, it's certainly a bait-and-switch.''
<p>
   The advent of deregulation on the East Coast will not be as big
an event.
<p>
   In Rhode Island, 19 companies have registered with the Rhode
Island Public Utilities Commission to be power providers.
<p>
   Although New Hampshire passed a law enabling competition
beginning Jan. 1, a federal lawsuit filed by Northeast Utilities to
have the law set aside has put electricity competition there on
hold for the time being.
<p>
   Despite state-funded education programs telling consumers what
they will face next year, there is growing evidence that consumers
are confused about what will happen when they are allowed to shop
around for a power provider.
<p>
   In a recent poll commissioned by Yankee Energy System, an
electric utility in Connecticut, 33 percent of Americans said they
knew of efforts to open up the utility market to greater
competition, and 67 percent said they hadn't heard about it.
<p>
   The public is undecided about what deregulation would actually
mean to them as consumers, according to the poll. About 45 percent
said a deregulated market would push electricity prices down while
41 percent believe it would cause a price increase and 51 percent
said the quality of service would increase.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   In California and Rhode Island, wholesale and large industrial
customers have been able to choose their electric supplier already.
<p>
   The experience there showed new competitors can woo away
business, but it may not be a way to generate quick profits.
<p>
   Dave Levoie, product manager of electricity for Tractebel, a
Belgian electric utility with its U.S. headquarters in Houston,
said such large industrial contracts struck in the early stages of
competition in Rhode Island will likely be more symbolic than
profitable.
<p>
   ``It's like they want to make a big thing out of it and tell
everyone, `We've got a deal,' when in fact these are probably going
to be loss leaders,'' Lavoie said. ``Most of the large industrial
users have stayed with their former suppliers.''

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose with bonds on
a government report showing economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 74.17,
or 0.95 percent, to 7922.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained
7.31, or 0.8 percent, to 945.22, led by banks and drug companies.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.35, or 0.2 percent, to 1682.24.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million money
management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   Falling interest rates boost demand for bank loans, while
steady-growing companies such as drugmakers are attractive when
bond yields become less competitive.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 13/16 to 113 15/16, leading a bank rally.
Among drug stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 2 to 82 1/2.
<p>
   U.S. bonds rose, rounding out a third week of gains, after the
government said economic growth in the second quarter was slower
than previously reported while inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   ``The (gross domestic product) results are positive for the bond
market; it makes it look like growth isn't that strong,'' said Ken
Anderson, who oversees $7 billion at Evergreen Asset Management
Corp., in Purchase, New York. Robust growth can fuel inflation,
which eats away at the value of bonds' fixed payments.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds gained 14/32, or $4.38 per
$1,000 bond, to 100 3/32, pushing the yield down 3 basis points to
6.37 percent. The two-year note yield fell 4 basis points to 5.78
percent.
<p>
   The Commerce Department put its final estimate of second-quarter
GDP growth at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, down from its previous
estimate of 3.6 percent. The price deflator, a measure of
inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the quarter, the
smallest rise since the second quarter of last year.
<p>
   Analysts had forecast a 1.5 percent rise in the deflator, which
measures both the magnitude of price increases and detects whether
higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
<p>
   ``Inflation is at such an extraordinary level that the slightly
higher revision isn't a problem,'' said Susan Hering, chief
economist at Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against the British pound in
two months on a report that the U.K. may join Europe's economic and
monetary union after it gets underway.
<p>
   An unidentified British cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the government is more eager to join Europe' single currency,
or euro, than it was several months ago. That could mean the U.K.
might need to cut interest rates to bring them into line with rates
elsewhere in Europe.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.25 percent versus the dollar to $1.6097 from
$1.6299 yesterday. The dollar was little changed at 121.27 yen from
121.13 and at 1.7588 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.

 &UR; ITT CORP. MAY WIN COURT DECISION OVER HILTON ON BREAK-UP PLANS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Las Vegas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- ITT Corp. may win court
approval to split into three companies without shareholder consent
next week, which would all but end Hilton Hotels Corp.'s $11.5
billion takeover attempt, legal experts and analysts said.
<p>
   Hilton wants to block ITT, saying the hotel and casino company
must let holders vote on the break-up plan and its $70-a-share
offer. ITT argues that it doesn't need investor approval.
<p>
   ITT's main weapon is Nevada corporate law, which lawyers and
legal analysts said calls for shareholder votes only when a company
merges, is sold, dissolves or changes its articles of
incorporation. ITT re-incorporated in Nevada in 1995 from Delaware
to take advantage of the state's laws.
<p>
   ``My reading of the laws in those states is that you don't need
a vote to spin off parts of your company,'' said Bernard Black, a
Columbia University professor who specializes in merger and
acquisition law.
<p>
   John Fowler, a lawyer who helped write Nevada's anti-takeover
and business combination statutes, said shareholder votes are only
called for in certain instances.
<p>
   ``The question may be whether this is a sale. That's what the
judge will have to decide,'' he said.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge Phillip Pro will hear Hilton's motion on
Monday and is expected to rule next week.
<p>
   Analysts expect ITT to quickly separate its hotel and casino,
telephone directory and technical school businesses if it gets
court and regulatory approvals. ITT also plans to buy back $2.1
billion in shares and take on $2 billion in debt.
<p>
   Stephen Bollenbach, chief executive of Burbank, California-based
Hilton, has said an ITT victory could end his eight-month effort to
buy the Sheraton hotels and Caesars World casinos.
<p>
   That's because the resulting company, ITT Destinations Inc.,
would have staggered terms for directors, which would draw out a
takeover attempt, and face a potential $1.26 billion-dollar tax
liability if taken over, Hilton's lawyers say.
<p>
   ``I feel good about our chances, but it's impossible to predict
what will happen in the courtroom,'' he said yesterday.
<p>
   Several investors in New York-based ITT have told Judge Pro they
should have the right to vote on the company's moves.
<p>
   ITT's argument that it doesn't need a vote because ITT
Destinations is a new company is a legal loophole, said Eric
Longmire, senior managing director of research for Wyser-Pratte &AMP;
Co., which owns 600,000 shares. Since 93 percent of ITT's assets
are being spun into ITT Destinations, the new company is in essence
the old ITT, he said.
<p>
   ``This is in essence the tail spinning off the dog, or a
spin-off reincarnation,'' he said.
<p>
   Two of the nation's biggest pension funds -- the College
Retirement Equities Funds and the California Public Employees'
Retirement System -- have also filed court briefs backing Hilton.
<p>
   With ITT's stock hovering at about $63, a majority of investors
would jump at Hilton's offer, said analyst David Loeb at Credit
Lyonnaise Securities. He put the chances of that happening at less
than 50/50.
<p>
   ``The current legal thinking is that judges don't like to
interfere with corporate governance,'' he said
<p>
   Regulators in two states where ITT has casinos -- New Jersey and
Mississippi -- have approved the plans. Nevada officials today
delayed their decision until Pro's ruling.
<p>
   ITT has said its split-up plan is aimed at raising its share
price, not at blocking a takeover attempt. Hilton, though, has said
move is really an attempt by ITT's management to keep their jobs.
<p>
   ITT originally had an annually elected 11-member board. To ward
off unwanted suitors, its bylaws authorized the addition of 14
directors in takeover situations to ensure that management's
supporters always make up a majority of the board.
<p>
   Hilton's legal team, led by former White House lawyer Bernard
Nussbaum, in turn nominated a slate of 25 directors to replace ITT
nominees, Black said.
<p>
   ``They thought this expansion would protect them, but when they
got indications shareholders might be willing to vote Hilton's
directors in so the offer could be approved, they got nervous,''
Black said.
<p>
   So ITT refused to hold its annual meeting in May; Nevada law
gives corporations until November to hold such meetings.
<p>
   ITT also sold about $3 billion in properties -- including
Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers
-- to build a war chest and boost its stock price.
<p>
   Hilton has had little success knocking down ITT's defenses.
<p>
   Judge Pro refused to force ITT to hold its annual meeting in May
or to block the board from adding additional directors or amending
its bylaws to disqualify Hilton board nominees.
<p>
   He has, however, denied ITT's attempt to dismiss Hilton's claims
that ITT isn't acting in shareholders' interest in breaking up the
company without their approval.
<p>
   One argument that may help Hilton is that while ITT has the
legal right to do the spinoffs, it's violating its legal duties to
shareholders by doing so, said Larry Hammermesh, a professor at
Widener University Law School.
<p>
   ``The idea is that an inequitable action -- one that isn't in
the best of interests of the shareholders -- isn't permissible
simply because the directors have the legal right to do it,'' he
said.

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks closed mixed,
with gains in Canadian Pacific Ltd. and oil issues tempered by
declining gold producers.
<p>
   Gold issues, which account for 6.8 percent of the benchmark
index, held back the broader market's advance after bullion fell
from its highest price in more than a month on weak demand for
jewelry, particularly in Japan and Southeast Asia.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery fell US$0.50 to US$329 an ounce on
the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex Division.
<p>
   The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 0.18 to
6975.90. Toronto is the second largest North American exchange in
terms of both volume and value.
<p>
   ``We had a rally in the last two-days in gold bullion, but it
looks like it has lost its legs and in the short term we see no
serious rebound in either bullion or the shares of producers,''
said Andre Chabot, a vice-president of Magna Vista Capital
Management Inc., which has C$890 million (US$641 million) in
assets.
<p>
   Placer Dome Inc. fell C$0.30 to C$24.40, Barrick Gold Corp. slid
C$0.35 to C$32.55 and TVX Gold Corp. dropped C$0.20 to C$7.50 paced
the sub-group's fall.
<p>
   Paper stocks like Avenor Inc., down C$0.80 to C$25.05, fell as
lumber for November delivery declined US$7.70 to US$298.60 a metric
ton on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Investors were also cautious ahead of a Federal Reserve policy
meeting on Tuesday when interest rates may be raised, analysts
said. Canada is directly affected by any U.S. economic change
because the countries are each other's largest trading partners.
<p>
   ``It's a mixed bag as the gold sector has backed off and
investors are taking some profits on financial-services stocks, but
there is really nothing that stands out,'' said Fred Ketchen, a
senior trader with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. ``The market is marking time
ahead of Tuesday's meeting and some people are concerned the Fed
will raise rates.''
<p>
   Any rise in interest rates by the Fed may be matched by the Bank
of Canada to keep the currency competitive. Ranger Oil Ltd. and
Elan Energy Inc. were among the most active after Ranger said it
purchased 490,000 common shares of Elan at an average price of
C$9.90 a share. Elan gained C$0.25 to C$10.20 and it was the most
actively traded stock on 5.2 million shares, while Ranger rose
C$0.40 to C$12.65 on 1.88 million shares.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. lost C$0.10 to C$13 on 4.17 mllion
shares traded after it said it will price an initial public
offering of its Gulf Indonesia Resources Ltd. subsidiary on Monday,
then list the shares the next day on the New York Stock Exchange.
Canadian Pacific Ltd. rose C$0.50 to C$41 to help offset decliners.
<p>
   ``There is a general optimism around the stock and when an
international investor wants to buy a piece of Canada, CP is one of
the stocks he buys,'' said Steve Bokor, a portfolio manager with
Majendie Charlton Securities Ltd.
<p>
   Canadian Pacific, which accounts for 2.6 percent of the
benchmark index, has interests ranging from rail and shipping to
energy.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. rose C$2.80 to C$33.30 on 2.9 million shares traded
after falling 32 percent yesterday when the software maker warned
growth will slow because customers are delaying purchases.
<p>
   On the broader market, advancing issues outpaced decliners 521
to 473, with 305 unchanged. More than 105.5 million shares changed
hands compared with a three-month average of 97.1 million shares.
The exchange reported trades valued at C$1.6 billion.
<p>
   The Montreal Stock Exchange rose 3.72 points to 3419.50. For the
week, it fell 6.11 points.
<p>
   The Vancouver Stock Exchange, where most Canadian junior
resource companies trade, climbed 3.26 points to 813.43. For the
week, it rose 3.62 points.
<p>
   Financial services issues helped stem the decline as the yield
on Canada's benchmark 30-year bond fell 4 basis points to 6.28.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after a revised U.S. economic report showed
growth with little inflation. Banks, which compete with bonds for
investors' attention because they both pay steady dividends,
typically gain as bond yields decline.
<p>
   Bank of Nova Scotia gained C$0.35 to C$64.95 and AGF Management
Ltd. Class B gained C$4.50 to C$65.50 while Mackenzie Financial
Corp. jumped C$0.85 to C$37.80.
<p>
   In other stock activity, United Dominion Industries Ltd. rose
C$0.15 to C$39.40 after it announced the purchase of two companies
that manufacture and recondition equipment for the ice-cream
industry.
<p>
   United Dominion said it will buy Philadelphia-based Processing
Machinery &AMP; Supply Co. and New Jersey-based Alliance Food Equipment
Corp. for an undisclosed amount.
<p>
   Air Canada gained C$0.75 to C$13.15 to lead transport issues
higher after it said it will follow the lead of U.S. carriers and
reduce commissions paid to travel agents on tickets purchased for
all international flights in an effort to cut costs.
<p>
   Linamar Corp. fell C$5 to C$83 after news Larry Pearson had
retired as company president.

<p>
   Detroit, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. car and truck sales in
September fell about 2 percent from strong year-earlier levels,
hurt by low inventories of popular 1997 vehicles as the model year
ends and still-limited availability of some new models, analysts
said.
<p>
   The expected September results follow stronger-than-expected
results in July and August. For the first eight months, industry
sales increased 0.2 percent from the year-earlier period to 10.3
million vehicles, as growing demand for sport utility vehicles
helped offset slow car sales.
<p>
   Though lower than a year earlier, sales for the month will still
come in at an annualized rate of 15.3 million vehicles, which is
considered good, analysts said. Sales were helped by dealers
offering cut-rate deals to make room for new models, analysts said.
<p>
   ``This is the last of the housecleaning on the 1997 models,''
said George Magliano, an auto industry consultant with the WEFA
Group. ``The deals are excellent.''
<p>
   U.S.-based automakers are turning in a mixed performance for the
month, analysts said. General Motors Corp. sales are expected to
rise about 2 percent, while Ford Motor Co.'s are seen little
changed. But Chrysler Corp.'s sales are likely to be down more than
10 percent for the month, analysts said, reflecting a lack of
exciting new vehicles.
<p>
   Chrysler will report sales Wednesday, and Ford and GM will
follow on Friday.
<p>
   The car-sales outlook comes amid signs of continued growth for
the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department said today that the
nation's gross domestic product grew 3.3 percent in the second
quarter, and economists expect growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent
in each of the year's two remaining quarters.
<p>
   Many auto industry officials are upbeat about the rest of the
year. ``The second half is looking much stronger than we thought it
would a few months ago,'' said Mel Stephens, a Ford spokesman.
<p>
   The catch to the favorable sales rate is that it's being propped
up by profit-trimming rebates, cut-rate loans and other incentives,
which companies have used to attract price-conscious shoppers.
<p>
   ``In 1996, you had a very strong demand pull,'' said Chrysler
Vice Chairman Robert Lutz. ``This year, there's less pull and more
push, with higher incentives and higher lease subsidies.''
<p>
   Analysts say rebates industrywide are running about $1,000 a
vehicle, up about 30 percent from year-ago levels.
<p>
   For the full year, industry sales of light vehicles in the U.S.
are expected to reach 15.0 million. GM officials told analysts this
week that 1998 sales are expected to total 14.7 million to 15.2
million vehicles.
<p>
   Chrysler hasn't posted a year-over-year monthly sales gain since
January, and that trend is continuing in September. Some analysts
say its sales will be down as much as 14 percent, with both car and
truck sales declining.
<p>
   Chrysler's lineup has become stale, analysts said, though that
may change soon.
<p>
   The company will introduce two new midsize cars, the Chrysler
Concorde and Dodge Intrepid, beginning in October. Chrysler also is
unveiling the Dodge Durango, the company's biggest sport utility,
and a four-door version of the Dodge Ram full-size pickup.
<p>
   Ford's car sales fell, hurt by a strong-year-earlier pace when
it sold 45,000 Taurus cars in a race to become the best-selling
U.S. car. Taurus sales will be 25,000 to 30,000 this month,
Stephens said.
<p>
   But truck sales are growing for Ford, as they have been all
year, rising 6.9 percent through August, versus a 6.6 percent
decline for cars.
<p>
   ``Everything is doing well on the truck side,'' Stephens said.
Among the bright spots are the Expedition and Navigator full-size
sport utilities and the Econoline full-size van.
<p>
   GM sales are seen rising about 2 percent in September, with
trucks up and cars down slightly. GM has limited supplies of some
new models, including Oldsmobile's Intrigue and Cutlass cars and
extended-cab full-size pickup trucks.
<p>
   Both GM and Ford are expected to increase market share from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   Japanese automakers, including Honda Motor Corp. and Nissan
Motor Co., are expected to post lower sales, while Toyota Motor
Corp. will be up slightly.
<p>
   Tight supplies of Honda's Accord, Civic and CR-V sport utility,
and Toyota's Camry and Corolla hurt sales.
<p>
   Industrywide, car inventories on dealer lots fell to a 49-day
supply at the end of August, compared with 55 days in the
year-earlier period. A 60- to 65-day supply is considered ideal.
<p>
   Following is a table of projected U.S. car and truck sales for
September among top auto companies, as supplied by the Luckey
Consulting Group of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey:
Percent Company September 1997 September 1996 Change GM 395,000

   Boston, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments' flagship
Magellan Fund has attracted about $110 million in net new cash
investments since the company announced the fund will close to new
investors, according to a research report.
<p>
   ``That's not much money relative to the size of the fund,'' said
Eric Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent
newsletter that tracks the nation's biggest fund group.
<p>
   The recent inflows do, however, mark the first month since
mid-1996 that Magellan attracted more net inflows than net
outflows, Kobren said. About $4 billion flowed from Magellan in the
first eight months of the year.
<p>
   Magellan will close to new investors on Tuesday. Magellan will
remain open after that day to investors who already own shares and
to participants in most group retirement plans where the fund is an
existing investment option.
<p>
   Magellan's market performance continues to improve. The fund
rose 35.02 percent in the 12-month period ended yesterday, ranking
No. 235 of 633 ``growth'' stock funds tracked by Bloomberg Fund
Performance.

   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted today to bar the federal government from
promoting the export or overseas sales of tobacco, delivering
another congressional blow against the tobacco industry.
<p>
   By a voice vote, the House approved a measure to bar the United
States Trade Representative, the Commerce Department, and several
other U.S. agencies from using its funds to promote U.S. tobacco
products outside the U.S., except in cases where it was purposely
discriminated against.
<p>
   Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg says he will seek to include
the measure in similar legislation moving through the Senate, and
lawmakers predicted it will become law this year.
<p>
   ``American taxpayers have been used to promote addicting other
people's children to the nicotine drug,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett
of Texas, who sponsored the amendment in the House. ``This
amendment will stop that.''
<p>
   The trade measure is the latest in a series of attacks on the
tobacco industry this year. Congress earlier this month repealed a
$50 billion tax break for the industry slipped into last summer's
balanced budget amendment. It approved $34 million next year for
the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco control program, and
raised cigarette taxes by 15 cents in the tax bill.
<p>
   ``The tobacco industry has not fared well on Capitol Hill this
year,'' said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.
<p>
   Today's measure prevents the U.S. agencies funded by the
Commerce, Justice, State annual spending bill from promoting
tobacco. That includes Commerce or State Department employees,
along with U.S. trade representatives and ambassadors.
<p>
   The bill was amended to allow trade officials to step in if
another country was discriminating against U.S. tobacco products
while supporting local products or imports from other nations. It
would allow the USTR to step in if a country allowed domestic
advertising while banning U.S. ads, for example.
<p>
   That change was made at the request of Republican Rep. Harold
Rogers of Kentucky, who sought to ensure that the U.S. would not
allow tobacco products to be purposefully discriminated against
outside the U.S. ``We wanted a fairer playing field than what was
in the original amendment,'' said Rogers spokeswoman, Susan
Zimmerman.
<p>
   The USTR is charged with supporting the export and sale of U.S.
products overseas, opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, lowering
trade barriers and tariffs, and negotiating free trade agreements.
<p>
   It aggressively promoted tobacco -- along with other U.S.
products -- in years past. Under the Clinton administration, is
agreed to accept foreign restrictions on U.S. tobacco products,
including advertising bans and health labels, as long as they were
also required on domestic products.
<p>
   Recently anti-tobacco advocates and their congressional allies
have increasingly called for the U.S. to stop promoting tobacco
overseas at all, arguing that it is hypocritical for the U.S. to
seek restrictions on tobacco products in the U.S., while at the
same time promoting the project in other countries.
<p>
   ``While the Marlboro Man has been forced to the negotiating
table in the U.S., he's twirling his rope around the throats of
children around the world,'' Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg said.

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Only Cal Ripken's sore back
could steal some of the spotlight from his team's first division
title in 14 years.
<p>
   With the Baltimore Orioles winning their first American League
Eastern Division pennant since 1983, Ripken said his back is
healing rapidly and he won't sit out a game until at least next
season.
<p>
   ``It's unfortunate that my situation can overshadow something
like this,'' Ripken said after Baltimore won its division-clinching
game on Wednesday against the Toronto Blue Jays.
<p>
   The 37-year-old Ripken, who'll make his 2,476th straight start
tonight in Milwaukee, told Bloomberg News that his sore back is
improving and he's shying away from offseason surgery.
<p>
   The last time the Orioles clinched a division title was Sept.
25, 1983. Baltimore, piloted by Eddie Murray and Mike Flanagan,
beat the Brewers as Ripken played in his 273rd straight game.
<p>
   Coming out of a players meeting to decide shares of playoff
bonus money, Ripken, who will make the decision on when his streak
will end, said his recent aches are beginning to subside.
<p>
   ``I'm a lot healthier and getting more agile, and I just want to
get ready for the playoffs,'' he said. ``The last few days I've
been feeling really good.''
<p>
   Ripken has had a disc problem in his lower back the past few
months that sends pain shooting down his left leg. He has said he's
played at less than his best through the injury. In his past 26
games, Ripken is 14-for-93 for a .151 batting average.
<p>
   Still, Ripken's teammates publicly support his decision to stay
in the lineup.
<p>
   ``Let him play,'' said Orioles second baseman Roberto Alomar.
``Five or six years ago, no one would be writing about this because
he wasn't in a pennant race. Now that he is, everyone's talking
about it. People who are physically able to do their job should be
allowed to do it.''
<p>
   Rafael Palmeiro, the Orioles soft-spoken first baseman, said the
recent criticisms of Ripken are unjustified.
<p>
   ``I don't understand,'' Palmeiro said. ``Of course he should
keep playing. We're all tired right now and Cal is under a lot of
stress and yet he keeps playing. That's what he's made of. He'd
rather play through something instead of sitting down.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- FelCor Suites LP and Nextlink
Communications Inc. led seven companies that sold a combined $1.7
billion of debt as the pace of new sales holds steady.
<p>
   Celulosa Arauco, a Chilean forestry company, joined the ranks of
today's other borrowers, including World Access Inc., Norwest
Financial Inc., Garden State Newspapers Inc. and Conecel Holdings
Ltd.
<p>
   Some $38.6 billion of corporate bonds have been sold this month,
according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, New Jersey.
Investment-grade corporate bonds contributed the most, weighing in
with $27.5 billion.
<p>
   After a fitful start, corporate bonds weathered the influx of
supply. The average yield spread on ``A''-rated industrial company
bonds due in 10 years is 1 basis point wider now than at the
beginning of the month, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets.
<p>
   ``Corporates had a somewhat sloppy month,'' said Sid Bakst, who
helps manage $3.4 billion of fixed-income assets at Weiss, Peck &AMP;
Greer in New York. They lost ground early in the month, rallied,
then moved sideways for the past week or two. Still, they ended the
month with a ``pretty respectable performance,'' he said.
<p>
   Some investors took advantage of the month's early dip in prices
to buy corporate securities. After selling bonds in July and August
to make room for the heavy calendar of new issues, ``we now have
the same amount of bonds in absolute dollars-committed,'' said Bob
Hickey, who helps manage $1.5 billion of fixed-income assets at Van
Kampen Capital Management in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. ``But we
hope we own them cheaper.''
<p>
   With the daunting amount of supply out of the way, corporate
bonds could be poised to gain. The spread, or the gap in yield
between corporate bonds and Treasuries, was unchanged today, said
traders. ``We probably have room to move tighter, but it might not
be a straight line back into tights,'' Bakst said. ``We will likely
have some choppiness between now and year end.''
<p>
   FelCor Suite sold $300 million of notes maturing in seven and 10
years. The company added the 10-year maturity and then boosted the
size of each part by $25 million.
<p>
   The bonds were attractive because the company is ``new to the
market, so it had to offer a concession,'' said Leonard Lovito, who
helps manage $600 million of investment-grade securities at J&AMP;W
Seligman &AMP; Co. ``But the company has very good cash flow, and it's
pretty well-run.'' He bought some of the $175 million of seven-year
notes being offered.
<p>
   FelCor Suite is owned by FelCor Suite Hotels Inc., an Irving,
Texas-based real estate investment trust focusing on all-suite
hotels such as ``Embassy Suites'' and ``Doubletree Guest Suites.''
<p>
   Earlier this week, Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised its
credit rating one notch on securities of both the parent and the
limited partnership. The new securities are rated ``Ba1'' by
Moody's and ``BB+'' by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. ``I think if you
look 12 to 18 months out, they could be an upgrade candidate,''
Lovito said.
<p>
   Among today's other sales, Nextlink Communications sold $400
million of 10-year notes, while Garden State Newspapers issued $250
million of 12-year notes. World Access, a maker of communications
equipment, issued $100 million of five-year bonds that can be
converted into equity shares.
<p>
   In the secondary market, the yield spread between an index of
option-free 10-year ``A2'' bank bonds and the 10-year Treasury note
was 72 basis points yesterday, 1 basis point wider from a week
earlier, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets.
<p>
   The yield spread between an index of option-free 10-year ``A2''
telephone bonds and the 10-year Treasury note was 56 basis points
yesterday, unchanged from a week ago.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Moody's Investors Services
said it's reviewing the ratings of US$1.17 billion in debt of Clark
USA Inc. and its Clark Refining &AMP; Marketing Inc. unit for a
possible downgrade following TrizecHahn Corp.'s decision to spin
off the company earlier this week.
<p>
   Moody's said it placed the issues under review after TrizecHahn,
a Toronto real-estate company, announced Monday it would spin off
its stake in the oil refiner to its shareholders to concentrate on
its core business. The debt-rating firm said it had to review the
effect of TrizecHahn and Tiger Management's departure on remaining
shareholders of Clark USA, and the impact of yet more debt on the
company.
<p>
   TrizecHahn shares rose C$0.10 to C$34.65 in Toronto.
<p>
   Moody's said it studying five debt issues: Clark USA's US$199
million senior secured zero-coupon notes, now rated B2 and a US$175
million 10 7/8 percent senior unsecured note issue rated B3. Clark
Refining &AMP; Marketing's debt being reviewed is its US$400 million
senior secured bank facility, rated Ba2, US$175 million 9 31/32
percent senior unsecured notes with a Ba2 rating and US$225 million
of 10 31/32 percent senior unsecured notes.
<p>
   Moody's also gave Clark's proposed US$63 million issue of senior
cumulative exchangeable preferred shares due in 2009, a Caa1
rating. The shares are being issued in exchange for Tiger
Management's 31 percent stake in the company.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Bandag Inc., which makes
tire-retreading materials and equipment, filed to sell its 8.1
percent stake in HON Industries Inc., a fireplace and office
furniture manufacturer.
<p>
   In addition, HON Industries will sell 1 million shares in the
offering, and expects to raise $51.7 million after expenses, if the
shares sell for 54 3/8, the closing market price yesterday,
according to an S-3 registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission today.
<p>
   Bandag and HON Industries are both based in Muscatine, Iowa.
Bandag expects to raise $105.8 million after expenses for the
shares, which were purchased in 1987 and 1988 for about $24.4
million, said Warren Heidbreder, Bandag's chief executive officer.
<p>
   ``With the gain we hope to realize, we are very satisfied with
that investment,'' Heidbreder said, adding that he expects the sale
to be finalized by late October.
<p>
   HON Industries' stock rose 109 percent to a 52-week high of 64
on Aug. 8 from 30 1/2 last November. It has fallen in recent
trading and closed at 53 1/2 today, down 7/8.
<p>
   Bandag intends to use the proceeds from its stock sale to pay
for a portion of its previously announced purchase of five
independent franchisees.
<p>
   On Aug. 27, Bandag agreed to buy five tire dealerships for about
$158.5 million. The combined dealerships will operate through a
subsidiary, Tire Distributor Systems Inc. Until now, Bandag has
relied on its network of 1,300 independent franchised dealers.
<p>
   HON Industries will use its stock sale proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including to repay debt used to finance
acquisitions in fiscal year 1996 and 1997, the filing said. That
debt matures on June 11, 2002 and bears interest at a variable
rate, currently 5.9 percent.
<p>
   HON Industries will use its remaining credit to finance capital
expenditures and any future acquisitions.
<p>
   ``At this stage we're always looking for opportunities, but I'd
rather not make a specific comment about what we have in the
pipeline,'' said James Johnson, HON Industries' general counsel.
<p>
   The stock sale will increase HON Industries' outstanding common
shares by 3 percent to 30.67 million shares, according to the
filing.
<p>
   Bandag's stock rose 3/8 today to close at 52 3/4.
<p>
   Roy Carver founded the tire-retreading company in 1957. After
his death in 1981, Carver left one of the largest charitable trusts
in the history of Iowa, which is used primarily for educational
purposes, Heidberger said.
<p>
   Carver's son Martin Carver now serves as Bandag's chairman,
chief executive and president, and Roy Carver's widow Lucille is a
company director.
<p>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. will underwrite the stock sale, with William
Blair &AMP; Co., Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co., McDonald &AMP; Co. and Securities
Inc.

   RUSSIA-SPACE-COX  &MD;  STAR CITY, Russia  &MD;  Forty years ago on Oct. 4
when the Soviets launched a tiny metal sphere called Sputnik they
took the first giant leap in the Cold War space race and set the
tone for America's stalwart space program. Today, the Russians
continue to determine U.S. space policy, though the driving force
is not competition, but co-dependency. The Clinton administration
and NASA spent much of the past week making the hand-wringing
choice of whether to send another American astronaut aboard the
bedeviled Russian space station Mir. For better and often worse,
the Russians have the world's only functioning space station and
the forerunner of a bigger international space station whose
construction is to begin next year. Despite the recent
near-disasters aboard Mir  &MD;  and because of them  &MD;  Russians and
Americans are working more closely than ever before in space.

   With RUSSIA-SPACE-PROBLEMS-COX  &MD;  MOSCOW  &MD;  When the crew of the
Apollo 13 moon mission faced a major malfunction but kept their
spacecraft limping along, they were hailed as heros and celebrated
in a major motion picture. Russian space officials complain that
when their cosmonauts routinely perform the same magic aboard the
hobbled Mir space station, they are ridiculed by observers from the
West and viewed with indifference by the Russian people. The
Russian-American experience on Mir points to a several key
historical and cultural differences between the space programs.
Among them: NASA's abundance of caution after the Challenger
disaster compared to Russian risk taking to keep their
problem-plagued program alive. And NASA's slick p.r. machine versus
Russia's legacy of Soviet secrecy. (Holmes)

his place in a long line of big league global do-gooders, alonside
names like Nobel, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Soros, men who used
their wealth to try to change the world. Turner's crusade, however,
represents a new twist on globalization. Fueled in no small part by
Turner's own CNN and the United Nations, the knitting together of
global interests has created a moral bond between Americans and
troubled people in far off lands, be they victims of land mines in
Angola, snipers in Bosnia or impure water in India. In such an
environment, Turner's style of private dollar diplomacy presents
some unique possibilities, as well as potential pitfalls, for a

Yeshiva and its supporters have bought more than 30 properties over

   Thirteen years ago, Diana Hunter's young son was having trouble
learning. He would spend his day staring out of his first-grade
classroom window. Worried educators told Hunter that they thought
he might be retarded, but she knew that he was an intelligent
child. When an I.Q. test reinforced her beliefs, he was put in a
gifted program. But he had troubles in that class as well.
<p>
   Hunter was then warned that he would have to be taken out of the
program if she didn't put him on Ritalin. Her question at the time:
``What is Ritalin?''
<p>
   Ritalin is a frequently prescribed medication for children
diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), terms that describe problems
with inattention and excessive activity.
<p>
   ``Hyperactivity by itself isn't a disorder,'' said Daniel
Hardie, M.D., a Marquette, Mich. family physician. ``It's
classified as a conduct disorder, which involves behavior that
irritates people,'' he said. ``People with ADD don't hold their
interests well. They try, but they keep losing track of what's
going on. Because of that, they don't learn very well.''
<p>
   Hardie gave an example: ``Kids with ADHD will run right in the
middle of a soccer game and kick the ball. They're not even on the
team. Everybody gets mad at them. They keep making mistakes. Most
of us would stop doing that after everybody yelled at us a couple
times.''
<p>
   Hardie said that Ritalin is a central nervous stimulant that is
used to help some people focus and stay on task. ``It slows those
kids down and helps them pay attention,'' he said.
<p>
   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the
amount of Ritalin consumed in this country has more than doubled
since 1990.
<p>
   For some kids, it has been a useful tool when paired with new
teaching and discipline methods. For others it is a quick fix for
dealing with excessive energy.
<p>
   ``Sometimes parents think that this could be the cure-all,''
Hunter said. `` `Let's just give the child medication and I don't
have to have these problems anymore.' Unfortunately, the drugs
don't always work.''
<p>
   According to Hunter, many people do not realize that there are
drug-free approaches to dealing with inattentive and hyperactive
children.
<p>
   When Ritalin was recommended for Hunter's son, she set out to
study Ritalin and what it does for kids. Her research led her to
realize that she did not want her son to take it. She also
discovered that other parents would benefit from information on how
to help their children without the use of medication. She wrote a
book, ``The Ritalin-Free Child,'' which points out the drawbacks of
using medication and tells about alternatives.
<p>
   ``There is no definite test that can tell you that you have
ADHD,'' said Hunter. ``Say you brought a child in to get a test for
being hyperactive in the morning after he had a good night's sleep
and a wonderful breakfast. (Or) you brought him in the afternoon
after he had a miserable day at school and got in an argument with
his teacher. Or you brought him in the evening and he just had a
fight with his sister and he was on restriction.''
<p>
   Other factors may contribute to misdiagnosis. Hunter stresses
the importance of a thorough physical examination to rule out the
possibilities of allergies, contaminants, or sight or hearing
problems. Some children misdiagnosed were found to actually be
suffering from lead poisoning, aluminum toxicity, or an allergic
reaction to the artificial sweeteners saccharin and aspartame
(Nutrasweet).
<p>
   A deficiency in protein or chromium could contribute to
behavioral problems, but, contrary to popular belief, sugar in
moderation is not usually a major problem. Hunter warns that
medication can worsen the problem if there's an underlying
condition that hasn't been detected yet.
<p>
   Depression can also cause symptoms that are mistaken for ADHD.
``I know a lot of kids who are going through divorces or deaths or
something of that nature,'' she said. ``They might get written up
as being ADD because they don't pay attention. They're really
depressed.''
<p>
   However, there are some guards against misdiagnosis. Hardie
explained diagnostic criteria: ``You have to demonstrate certain
behaviors for at least six months. You don't have to do every one,
but you have to have eight out of 13. Also, it has to start before
the age of 7.''
<p>
   Hunter said that if a child does indeed have an attention and
hyperactivity problem, behavior can be changed without drugs.
<p>
   ``They need to be able to learn in a different way,'' she said.
``They need someone to teach them some motivation, teach them about
completion. As they practice it they will become better at it and
learning will become easier for them as time progresses, rather
than a continual frustrating thing where they're floundering
around.''
<p>
   So how do kids respond to the drug-free approach? According to
Hunter, they prefer not to take Ritalin.
<p>
   ``Kids don't like being labeled. If you have to take medication,
you're sick. And who wants to think they're sick all the time?''
<p>
   ``It doesn't really bother me because it helps me concentrate
better,'' said Chris, 13, from Marquette who takes Ritalin for his
ADHD. ``If I didn't take it, I probably wouldn't be in seventh
grade. I always used to be really hyper and my friends didn't like
me as much. But now when I'm taking it they're starting to like me
more because I'm not as hyper.'
<p>
   Ryan, 15, a Marquette teen with ADD who has stopped taking
Ritalin said, ``It helps you direct your thoughts.''
<p>
   ``Medication should be a last resort,'' says Hunter, whose son
is now an 18-year-old National Merit scholar. ``Even if they use
medication, there should be a long-term plan where they decide they
want to try to get off of it.''

<p>
   Diana Hunter, the author of ``The Ritalin-Free Child'' published
by Consumer Press, claims that there are advantages to being
``hyperactive'' or ``inattentive.''
<p>
   For example, she said that Albert Einstein's teacher thought he
was a slow learner, and Thomas Edison's teacher thought he was
retarded because he did not pay attention.
<p>
   ``They were incredible people,'' she said. ``Maybe people who
are considered ADD or ADHD are not disordered or sick. Maybe
they're just different. We need to approach these kids like they
are different learners, because they're probably going to be the
movers and shakers of our future.''
<p>
   Hunter said she helped her son and hundreds of other kids who
were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, with a program that
she says works. Hunter's plan uses the acronym ROAD: Routine,
Organization, Activities, and Diets.
<p>
    &UR; Routine: &LR; 
<p>
   ``With my little boy,'' she explains, ``in the morning he had
some trouble because he was being inattentive. So we put on the
side of his closet door a little list that says `Wake up, brush
teeth, get dressed, eat breakfast, put on shoes.' And it's in the
correct order. He doesn't need to look at the list anymore.''
<p>
    &UR; Organization: &LR; 
<p>
   ``It's important to teach kids to put things back where they go
because they're going to be easier to find later.''
<p>
    &UR; Activities: &LR; 
<p>
   By finding other healthy ways of channeling their energies, kids
learn to focus and use their abilities positively.
<p>
    &UR; Diet: &LR; 
<p>
   Pay attention to nutrients and food additives. ``Protein is
important because it helps your brain to think, relax, and function
better. A lot of kids don't have protein because they eat junk
food.'' Hunter adds: ``The colors that they put in foods really
affect the brain. The same color that's in the shirts and pant that
you're wearing, they put in your food.''
<p>
   Hunter says that her program has received a great deal of
positive feedback. She says that even people who take medication
can learn from this plan.
<p>
   ``I really like for kids to sit down with their parents and tell
them, `I don't want to feel disordered. I think that I have
difficulties that can be turned into something good if you help
channel me.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Investors are so sure about
the prospects for scant inflation that they're willing to accept
yields on long-term Treasury debt that aren't much higher than
those offered by shorter-term securities.
<p>
   The spread, or difference in yield, between two-year U.S. notes
and benchmark 30-year bonds narrowed this week to just a little
more than half a percentage point -- the slimmest since February
1995. Some investors expect long-term yields to fall even more --
causing further narrowing, or flattening, in the spread -- as
inflation stays down.
<p>
   ``We think the low inflation numbers will continue and the
flattening curve is validating that forecast,'' said David Kotok,
who oversees about $400 million at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland,
New Jersey. Kotok predicts yields on 30-year bonds will fall below
6 percent next year from 6.36 percent today.
<p>
   The spread between long- and short-term debt is shrinking as
reports provide more evidence that the economy is keeping up its
robust pace without pushing prices higher. That has caused
investors to pile into longer-term securities such as 30-year
bonds, which hold more of their value when inflation is tame. It
also makes real yields -- yields less the rate of inflation
--attractive.
<p>
   ``The way the American economy is running, our long-bond yields
are way too high,'' said Tom Carpenter, who manages some $6 billion
in assets at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C. ``I think
we'll move to a flatter curve.''
<p>
   Carpenter, who has bought long-dated Treasuries betting that
yields will head lower, said the difference between short- and
long-term debt will flatten more as the low-inflation story drives
down 30-year bond yields. With the yields on the two-year note at
5.78 percent and the 30-year yield at 6.36 percent, that spread is
currently 59 basis points, down from as high as 89 basis points
earlier this year.
<p>
   The last time the spread between two-year notes and 30-year
bonds narrowed dramatically -- in late 1994 -- circumstances were
different than they are today. Then, the Federal Reserve was
nearing the end of a round of rate increases, which put pressure on
short-term rates, lifting short-term yields almost as high as their
long-term counterparts. The spread narrowed to as low as 9 basis
points on Dec. 27, 1994.
<p>
   This time around, expectations for quiescent inflation are
helping drive down yields on 30-year bonds and other long-term
debt, reducing the premium investors are willing to accept to take
on the risk of holding longer-term securities rather than
short-term debt. Meanwhile, concern that the economy's strength may
compel the Fed to boost bank lending rates again is keeping
short-term rates from falling as much as long-term rates.
<p>
   ``I don't see a lot of upside in two-year notes'' at 5.78
percent, with the Fed's target for overnight lending between banks
not much lower at 5.50 percent, said John Burgess, who helps
oversee some $70 billion of bonds at Bankers Trust Global
Investment Management.
<p>
   Still, Burgess remains wary about the prospects for further
gains in longer-term bonds, after a rally that sent yields on
30-year bonds down 33 basis points since Sept. 11.
<p>
   Until recently, he was selling two-year notes short and holding
30-year bonds, on the bet that long-term yields would fall more
than shorter-term securities. In a short sale, a trader borrows
bonds and sells them, speculating that he'll be able to buy them
back later at a lower price, return them and pocket the difference.
<p>
   Burgess said he unwound that trade earlier this week as the
spread between two-year notes and 30-year bonds reached its low for
the year of 54 basis points. He said he's unwilling to make a big
bet on rates now out of concern that yields may climb in the days
ahead if reports slated for next week on jobs, manufacturing and
other parts of the economy continue to strengthen or begin to show
any signs of inflation.
<p>
   ``I can't get excited about anything here, with the numbers
continuing to surprise on the strong side,'' Burgess said. Bonds
yesterday tumbled after reports on factory orders for big-ticket
items, housing and jobless claims all suggested the economy remains
healthy.
<p>
   Even so, growth hasn't spurred inflation. Consumer prices rose
at a 1.6 percent annual pace in the first eight months of the year,
the slowest since 1986. That is likely to keep the Fed from
boosting rates when officials meet Tuesday, if not for the rest of
the year, many investors say. Some, such as Kotok at Cumberland
Advisers, say the recent rally suggests the Fed's next change in
interest rate policy is likely to be a rate cut rather than an
increase.
<p>
   For these reasons, many investors continue to favor longer-term
debt in the expectation that yields on these securities will fall,
driving the spread between long- and short-term debt narrower.
<p>
   ``The bargains are in the intermediate and long end,'' Kotok
said. ``The longer you go the bigger risk you take, but the bigger
kick you can get for the move we think we'll see.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil surged to its
highest price in almost four months after the bombing of a
Colombian oil pipeline raised concern that exports to the U.S.
could be disrupted at a time of low inventories.
<p>
   The bombing was the 51st this year and came just two days after
state oil company Ecopetrol repaired the line from the previous
attack. The attack came with U.S. crude oil inventories lagging
year-ago levels by 8.3 million barrels, or 2.7 percent, according
to the American Petroleum Institute. Colombia is the third-largest
oil exporter to the U.S. in Latin America.
<p>
   Prices rose in early trading as investors who follow charts for
technical evidence of market direction took four consecutive days
of rising prices as a signal to buy futures contracts.
<p>
   ``The pipeline news has added to today's gains,'' said Steve
Bellino, a senior trader at ABN Amro Chicago Corp. in New York.
<p>
   Crude oil for November delivery rose 48 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $20.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
for a contract closest to expiration since June 2. Crude prices
gained 7.9 percent this week. It's the biggest weekly gain for
crude since mid-May.
<p>
   October gasoline rose 2.09 cents, or 3.5 percent, to 61.34 cents
a gallon, the highest since Sept. 3. October heating oil rose 1.41
cents, or 2.5 percent, 57.92 cents a gallon, the highest since Aug.
5.
<p>
   Heating oil prices have risen in recent days as forecasts for
cooler weather in the U.S. Northeast prompted speculators and oil
marketers to buy contracts in anticipation of colder weather to
come.
<p>
   Still, many oil traders expressed surprise at today's rise,
though, since distillate supplies, which include home heating oil
are 20 percent above year-ago levels, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Heating oil inventories alone are 31 percent
higher than a year ago.
<p>
   ``Fundamentally there's no reason to see heating oil higher;
there's so much oil that people are running out of storage
facilities,'' said Abe Glass, a trader at Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg in
New York. ``We've never been this over-supplied. There are more
than 20 million more barrels of distillates than a year ago --
that's a lot of oil.''
<p>
   Heating oil inventories have risen in recent months as
refineries ran at near-maximum capacity during the summer to meet
demand for gasoline. Heating oil is produced as part of the
refining process for gasoline.
<p>
   Heating oil's gains were also influenced in part by chart
movements, traders said.
<p>
   ``We had a lot of heating oil buying from non-commercial
participants,'' said Bellino. ``Sometimes price movements don't
make sense to people who judge them from the fundamental side''
alone. We're selling into it -- we don't see the fundamentals for
the market being this strong.''
<p>
   U.S. refinery utilization, the percentage of refining capacity
in operation, rose to 99.7 percent during the week ended Aug. 29,
the highest rate ever recorded by the API. Refinery utilization
declined by 0.8 percentage point last week to 97.8 percent.
<p>
   Traders were waiting to see whether Iraq will be forced to
reduce oil exports because of a lack of spare parts for a key
pipeline.
<p>
   Elsewhere, Iraq said it isn't receiving enough spare parts to
maintain a pipeline it uses to export oil through Turkey under a
United Nations-sponsored oil-for-aid accord.
<p>
   The hardware is part of the package aid Iraq is allowed to buy
with oil revenue. Iraqi officials said the parts are being
needlessly delayed by U.S. representatives on the U.N. sanctions
committee.
<p>
   ``We have announced clearly that we need more spare parts to
repair the pipeline,'' said Saeed Hasan, deputy permanent
representative at the Iraqi mission to the U.N. in New York. ``The
U.S. is continuing to block spare parts to repair the pipeline. We
don't understand why it is being blocked. There is an agreed list,
and the parts for the pipeline are part of the deal approved by the
(U.N.) secretary general.''
<p>
   It isn't known how long the pipeline, which runs from Kirkuk in
Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, can operate without the spare
parts, Hasan said. Oil market analysts said they doubted the
pipeline was in imminent danger of failing.
<p>
   Elsewhere, traders said there was speculation that Citgo
Petroleum Corp. has a problem with a 45,000 barrel-a-day reformer
unit -- which makes premium gasoline -- at its Lake Charles,
Louisiana, refinery. Citgo refused to comment.
<p>
   In other Nymex energy markets, natural gas for October delivery
at the Henry Hub in Louisiana rose 17.2 cents to $3.47 per million
British thermal units, the highest for a contract closest to
delivery since Jan. 15. Trading was volatile on the October
contract, which expired today.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  They meet next to a Barnes and Noble book store. Some
people say they're criminals. They say they're the new anarchists.
<p>
   The media calls them ``hackers,'' but they prefer calling
themselves names like D-Frag, Pheesh and Vandal. Basically, they're
computer nerds who want access to information and services they
believe they should have anyway.
<p>
   Children's Express went to a meeting of a hacker organization
affiliated with the hacker quarterly magazine, 2600. Most of the
hackers we interviewed were in high school or college though they
were evasive about giving more exact details about their ages. Some
of them were really strange, like there was a guy all in black and
one with green hair. We only found one girl, Blue Rose, who was
there for her own purposes and not because of a boyfriend.
<p>
   A few of them talked about this superior guy called Anarchy who
was hiding in the wings. It was actually kind of scary.
<p>
   When they asked for our e-mail addresses a couple of us thought,
``Maybe we shouldn't give it to them.''
<p>
   Still, the majority of people we spoke to seemed normal. Only
they knew more about computers and seemed to have a lot of time on
their hands.
<p>
   Ebola: I'm usually spokesperson for AOC, the Agents of Chaos. We
run programs and stuff to help people out.
<p>
   Molester: I'm a grunt in the organization. I do most of the
dirty work such as acquiring books, equipment; programming books,
maybe.
<p>
   Ebola: I'm mostly a phone phreak. You ever see those guys climb
up the phone poles and tap into phone lines? That's what I do best.
Just dress in denim, you look like a phone worker.
<p>
   Akira: Phreak is spelled PH mainly because phreaking has to do
with phone lines. There's somebody out there who wants to either
manipulate the system or, on the simplest level, get free phone
calls.
<p>
   Pheesh: That sound that you just heard, that sounded like
brrrrrrrh. Those are what's known as `red box tones.' When a
quarter or any type of currency is put into a pay phone, it hits a
switch and generates a tone, which basically allows you to make the
call. When you play the red box tone, that equals a quarter.
Personally, I think it's a bad way of hacking, because that's the
illegal side of it. Actually the tape you're recording this
interview with is now illegal because it has a red box tone on it.
<p>
   D-Frag: Personally I like to take lots of money from the
Republican Committee and then transfer it to the National Negro
College Fund, or the NAACP. No, I don't do that. I'm sure someone
somewhere could do that. I've never done it.
<p>
   Pheesh: What's the best hack I ever did? There's a programming
line called Visual Basic Four that's not supposed to do certain
things and I was able to extend the capabilities of the program.
<p>
   I-Ball: I started following on BBSs. That's bulletin boards
systems and stuff. Eventually I learned programming. But it was
hard for me because I didn't have anybody to help me out. A year
ago, in 8th grade, my friend introduced me to the community.
<p>
   Ebola: You always have to have a code of ethics. That's our
whole thing. You have to have some kind of civic mind. You can't
hurt the innocents. Like if you're going to play your phone lines,
you can't go next door and screw your neighbor over.
<p>
   Akira: I don't have a fear of getting caught, mainly because
there's a lot of bull out there about how hackers break into all
this government nonsense. Which is true. They do break into it. But
whenever I try engaging in any type of hacking type activities,
it's never toward like a government or military institution. And I
don't have any malicious intent.
<p>
   Blue Rose: I got a couple of phone calls from the FBI but
nothing major. I know people that have been in jail or are in jail
now.

   Vandal: Contrary to popular belief hacking is not doing
something illegal. It's gaining access to a computer system. I
mean, you can go as far as to say when I turn on my computer, I'm
hacking my computer because I'm turning it on and I'm functioning
it. I'm making it work.
<p>
   D-Frag: The mainstreaming of hacking has pretty much brought the
world into this red box and Rollerblade type culture. It's just a
big media affair now.

get a girl. It's completely silly.

computers happen to be males. But that's not the case. There are
girls out on the scene, just not a lot of them. I wish there were
more girls on the scene.

<p>
   Bogota, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- In the two-and-a-half years
Colombian presidential candidate Alfonso Valdivieso served as the
country's chief prosecutor, his private secretary remembers seeing
him angry only twice.
<p>
   The arrival of gifts from suspected drug traffickers -- a piece
of jewelry and a food basket -- was the cause both times. Incensed,
Valdivieso ordered them returned.
<p>
   ``For me, that defined his character,'' Angela Moreno said.
<p>
   As chief prosecutor, the 47-year-old Valdivieso developed an
image of incorruptibility, and he steadily uncovered evidence of
ties between suspected criminals and public officials.
<p>
   That record is the foundation for his candidacy. ``Valdivieso's
main asset is his moral image,'' said Javier Fernandez Riva,
president of an economic consulting firm. As prosecutor, ``he was a
symbol, and his righteous attitude was significant.''
<p>
   Valdivieso helped trigger the political crisis that nearly
toppled President Ernesto Samper. Acting on evidence found in
police raids against properties owned by Cali drug ring leaders in
1995, he opened investigations into the financing of Samper's 1994
presidential campaign.
<p>
   They led to the arrest of 11 members of Congress, Samper's
former campaign manager and his campaign treasurer. It also led to
an accusation against Samper for election fraud and illicit
enrichment, as well as investigations against three cabinet
ministers. A Congress riddled with accusations of drug-related
corruption later acquitted the president.
<p>
   Last May, as surveys showed him the most popular Colombian
official, Valdivieso resigned as prosecutor and said he would run
in next May's presidential election. Some of Samper's political
allies called Valdivieso an opportunist.
<p>
   ``Valdivieso used the prosecuting office as a diving board for
politics. I will not support that candidacy,'' said Liberal Senator
Julio Cesar Guerra on the day of Valdivieso's resignation.
<p>
   ``It was a very difficult decision for me to make,'' Valdivieso
said of his foray into the presidential race. ``But for me it was
clear that I had a lot to do for the country.''
<p>
   ``Action against the sickness of corruption will be better
attended from the highest level,'' he added.
<p>
   His investigations led the U.S., Colombia's largest trading
partner, to threaten economic sanctions and repeatedly declare that
Colombia was failing to cooperate in the fight against drug
trafficking. Washington withdrew Samper's visa, citing his alleged
links to traffickers, and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno praised
Valdivieso for his ``courage'' in pursuing the investigations.
<p>
   Valdivieso is still a member of Samper's Liberal Party, but his
main support comes from independent and conservative politicians,
businessmen and the upper and middle classes, and many analysts
expect him to run as an independent.
<p>
   Polls show Valdivieso is one of the two leading candidates. The
other is a chief defender of the government Valdivieso relentlessly
investigated. The strength in the polls of Samper's former interior
minister, Horacio Serpa, shows how the political crisis has divided
Colombia.
<p>
   Serpa is running as the incumbent's ally at a difficult time.
Unemployment is at an 11-year high of 13.6 percent. A recent World
Bank study called Colombia the world's third-most corrupt country.
With about 29,000 homicides a year, Colombia is one of the world's
most violent countries.
<p>
   Guerrilla groups, grown rich through kidnapping, extortion and
drug processing, have increased their attacks on oil pipelines and
regional politicians. The government faces growing criticism by
legislators for its inability to stem the rebels' gains.
<p>
   In the face of such a bleak outlook, the candidates' personal
styles help explain how Serpa can match Valdivieso's support.
<p>
   Serpa, who is strongest among the poor and Liberal Party
chieftains, is an outgoing, veteran politician who has been in
public life for more than 30 years. Valdivieso, a soft-spoken,
diminutive man, was a virtual unknown when Congress elected him
chief prosecutor in 1994. His time as a Liberal Party senator and a
brief stint as education minister under Samper's predecessor did
little to attract the spotlight.
<p>
   Valdivieso's quiet, unassuming manner may serve him less well in
the political arena than as an investigator. Last month, he, Serpa
and seven other candidates endured their first public test before
the country's main business groups in a two-day conference in
Cartagena where they spoke on an array of issues.
<p>
   While business leaders have long shown public support for
Valdivieso, they said later they were unimpressed with his speaking
style.
<p>
   ``Serpa's experience and political grasp are undeniable,'' said
Juan Manuel Ospina, the president of the Colombia Society of
Farmers, one of the government's most outspoken critics.
``Valdivieso's style is not good for public forums.''
<p>
   Valdivieso is not considered an expert on economic issues but
he's prompted cautious optimism among investors, who hope he will
restore Colombia's international credibility and improve ties with
the U.S. if elected.
<p>
   Valdivieso's first public comments on the economy came in the
Cartagena conference, where he spoke of the need to stem the
strengthening of the peso against the dollar.
<p>
   Some economists were concerned the appreciation of Colombia's
currency was holding back Colombia's economy, making Colombia's
exports more expensive abroad and imports to Colombia cheaper in
peso terms. Since then, guerrilla attacks and falling interest
rates have helped drive down the peso.
<p>
   Valdivieso also said in an interview that he wants to reduce
spending by cutting unnecessary costs and fighting embezzlement by
public officials.
<p>
   ``The are a great many components such as inefficiency and
corruption'' that can be eliminated, he said.
<p>
   To avoid widening the budget deficit, he added, his government
would pledge not to contract new external and internal debt during
the first year of his administration.
<p>
   He also said he would ensure a clearer set of rules for foreign
investors, who have complained the present government has
discouraged some projects by changing investment rules.
<p>
   Still, economic issues are unlikely to be at the forefront of
the electoral debate. For the most part, candidates are speaking on
economic issues only when prompted, spending most of their time
discussing ways to change Colombia's political culture.
<p>
   ``I want to establish for Colombians an option for redirecting
the nation amid one of the most difficult times in its recent
history,'' Valdivieso said.

<p>
   Bogota, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Horacio Serpa, a leading
Colombian presidential candidate, recently was leaving the funeral
of a slain senator when a well-dressed woman said: ``There's goes
the country's worst criminal.''
<p>
   ``I was upset,'' said Luis Fernando Garcia, a former aide to
Serpa who recounted the story. ``This is what comes of having the
vocation of public service.''
<p>
   More than any other candidate for next year's presidential
elections, Serpa deeply divides Colombians because of a drug
scandal that's hounded President Ernesto Samper for three years.
<p>
   A former Interior minister in Samper's government, his staunch
defense of the president gives Serpa, 52, the highest negative
ratings in polls. Samper was investigated in Congress for evidence
drug cartels financed his 1994 election campaign, though a direct
link to him was never proved.
<p>
   Serpa, who was the political director in Samper's campaign,
impresses some as a loyal man who kept the government from toppling
during the highly charged hearings. Serpa angers others for his
defense of what they see as a corrupt government.
<p>
   ``I'm not worried about what others think about my relationship
with Samper,'' Serpa said in an interview during a recent
conference of business leaders in Cartagena. ``He is an honorable
man and a friend.''
<p>
   Serpa's main rival out of a field of 12 in May elections is
Alfonso Valdivieso, a former prosecutor who came to national
attention because his investigations into drug-related corruption
sent several politicians to jail.
<p>
   The campaign is likely to focus on Serpa's ties to Samper and
Valdivieso's fight against corruption, including his efforts in
Congress to press charges against the president.
<p>
   Serpa's support of Samper has earned him many enemies. In late
1995, he incurred the wrath of U.S. officials when he suggested the
Drug Enforcement Administration played a role in the shooting of
Samper's lawyer.
<p>
   Voter support for Serpa is strongest among Colombia's poor, who
like his vows to do away with social inequality. A former mayor of
Barrancabermeja, a sweltering city in northeastern Colombia, Serpa
was one of three presiding officers who drafted Colombia's 1991
constitution.
<p>
   Serpa gave few clues during the interview on his economic
policies or what he would do to improve a deficit the government
projects as 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.
<p>
   Serpa might be less willing to curb government spending than
Valdivieso, said Javier Fernandez Riva, who runs an economic
consulting firm. ``I don't think he'll be willing to pay the price
of unemployment,'' he said.
<p>
   About 1 million Colombians, or 13.6 percent of the workforce,
are jobless, an 11-year high. Serpa said the government's
employment policies ``did not yield results.''
<p>
   Some analysts also wonder if his defense of Samper's tarnished
government will pose problems for Serpa abroad.
<p>
   ``The perception of Serpa is not that favorable,'' said Michael
Henry, an analyst at ING Baring Securities Inc. ``Although he has
said very little of what he wants to do, people don't think he'll
be the man to take on the fiscal policy.'' Last month, Serpa faced
some of his strongest opponents at a conference hosted by the
National Association of Industrialists. Serpa sat visibly tense as
one presidential contender after another derided the government he
has spent three years defending. Silence and muted applause greeted
his speeches.
<p>
   ``I thought Serpa looked sincere and strong. Even if he does
come from a tainted political association,'' said Cesar Gonzalez,
the president of the National Banking Association.
<p>
   For Serpa, the campaign will revolve on bringing peace to a
country trying to overcome 40 years of a bloody guerrilla
insurgency. Leading up to October municipal and gubernatorial
elections, 159 candidates have been kidnapped, El Tiempo newspaper
recently reported. Twenty-six mayors have died since January 1996
and as many as 900 candidates have resigned, fearing for their
lives.
<p>
   Serpa said he has strong credentials for reconciliation --and
for political power-wielding -- demonstrated by his 30 years in
politics.
<p>
   ``I would sum up my campaign message in the following way: let's
live together,'' Serpa said. ``That is Colombia's great concern.''
<p>
   In the 1980s, Serpa acted as a go-between for the government of
President Belisario Betancurt and left-wing guerrilla groups, as
both sides made fruitless attempts at peace. Under Samper, he
spearheaded unsuccessful attempts at peace with left- and
right-wing rebels. Stepped up attacks by rebels aimed at sabotaging
Oct. 26 elections have led politicians and business leaders to
redouble their calls for peace.
<p>
   Guerrilla groups from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN, are
now believed to exercise some degree of control over about half of
the country's townships.
<p>
   Serpa said he would clear an area of the country of the military
so that guerrilla leaders could sit down with government officials
and discuss plans for a peace agreement. Army generals oppose the
idea, which is espoused by Samper. Serpa maintains that a military
victory against the rebels is no longer viable.
<p>
   ``My commitment with Colombia is to make peace with the
guerrillas,'' Serpa said. ``I will make an extraordinary effort.''

<p>
   Bellevue, Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Nextlink
Communications Inc. shares surged 37 percent in first-day trading
as investors bet that the cachet of cellular pioneer Craig McCaw
will mean success for his new local phone company.
<p>
   Nextlink shares rose 6 1/4 to 23 1/4 in trading of 9.28 million,
making Nextlink the second-most active U.S. stock behind Intel
Corp.
<p>
   Nextlink stands out from a crowded field of local phone
providers because it was founded by McCaw, who built McCaw Cellular
Communications into the largest U.S. cellular provider before
selling it to AT&AMP;T Corp. for $11.5 billion. His new company has two
top McCaw and AT&AMP;T executives, Steven Hooper and Wayne Perry, as
chairman and chief executive.
<p>
   ``The market is driven somewhat by personalities as well as the
numbers, and that has probably helped the performance of the IPO,''
said Bryan Van Dussen, a telecommunications analyst with Yankee
Group in Boston. ``The management has a long history and pedigree
at Nextlink.''
<p>
   The Bellevue, Washington-based company and McCaw sold 15.2
million shares for $17 each, raising about $191 million for the
company and $54.4 million for McCaw. The sale, which represents a
30 percent stake, was managed by Salomon Brothers Inc.
<p>
   Nextlink plans to use the proceeds, along with a $388 million
bond offering that also closed today, to build fiber-optic networks
in a number of U.S. cities, where it will compete against incumbent
local telephone companies.
<p>
   Nextlink, like other so-called competitive-access providers, has
run up huge losses, and analysts said earnings could be years away.
The company founded in 1994 lost $71 million, or $1.90 a share,
last year on $25.7 million in revenue.
<p>
   Other local-access providers are generating similar losses as
they spend heavily to string fiber-optic lines and install
switching equipment in U.S. cities.
<p>
   Investors don't seem to care. Shares in Brooks Fiber Properties,
which provides local telephone and data transmission, have risen
about 60 percent since the company went public in May 1996.
<p>
   And shares of McLeodUSA Inc., which provides local and
long-distance telecommunications services, have risen about 75
percent since its IPO in June 1996.
<p>
   Analysts expect local-access providers to become profitable
during the next few years as the companies steal away the most
lucrative business customers from local phone companies such as SBC
Communications Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp. by offering special
services such as computer networking and sophisticated voicemail
and paging.
<p>
   ``You have to put your network in place first,'' said Todd
Scott, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York. ``You don't have the
revenues that immediately justify the valuations of these
companies.''
<p>
   McCaw's involvement with Nextlink reassures investors, Van
Dussen said, because he battled skeptics for more than a decade as
he transformed a money-losing network of cellular franchises into
the largest U.S. cellular company before selling it in 1994.
<p>
   McCaw has had a similar effect on struggling Nextel
Communications Inc., whose shares have more than doubled this year
as McCaw and his family increased their stake to 18 percent of the
wireless communications company.
<p>
   McCaw also has lent his credibility to Teledesic Corp., a
satellite-communications company that needs to raise $9 billion or
more for an earth-girdling network of more than 200 satellites.
McCaw and Microsoft Inc. founder Bill Gates are backing the company
along with Boeing Co.
<p>
   Nextlink will offer more down-to-earth services, primarily a
combination of local phone service with special features such as
call forwarding, data networking and paging, Van Dussen said. The
company is getting a late start behind competitors such as Teleport
Communications Group Inc., he said, with only nine switches and
26,000 access lines in 23 cities.
<p>
   Teleport, for example, has more than 200,000 access lines and
McLeodUSA has 100,000, Scott of Furman Selz said.
<p>
   ``They're coming in behind the curve a little bit,'' Van Dussen
said. ``Nextlink has a long way to go until it's a truly profitable
and prosperous company.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The National Hockey League
suspended Pittsburgh Penguins center Stu Barnes four games for a
slash that broke Boston Bruins center Joe Thornton's left arm.
<p>
   Barnes, who slashed Thornton during a preseason game on Tuesday,
was also fined $1,000, the league maximum.
<p>
   The injury is expected to keep Thornton, the top overall pick in
the 1997 draft, sidelined for six to eight weeks.
<p>
   ``Mr. Barnes' use of a two-handed, baseball grip slash in an
attempt to check his opponent was careless and resulted in serious
injury to Mr. Thornton,'' said NHL senior vice president Brian
Burke.
<p>
   Barnes has already served the first game of the suspension. He
will miss the Penguins' final preseason game tomorrow against the
Flyers in Philadelphia and their first two regular season games
against the Los Angeles Kings on Oct. 1 and Carolina Hurricanes on
Oct. 3.
<p>
   Thornton, who signed a three-year contract worth as much as $9
million in August, was expected to be a key part of a rebuilding
Bruins' team that had a league-worst 26-47-9 record last season and
failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 30 years.

<p>
   Montreal, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's two major airlines,
following the lead of U.S. carriers, said they'll cut commissions
paid to travel agents on tickets purchased for all international
flights in a bid to cut costs.
<p>
   Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International Ltd. said agents
will earn an 8 percent base rate, down from 10 percent, with a
maximum payment of C$70 (US$50.40) for return tickets on all
flights between Canada and the U.S. The maximum payout for one-way
flights will be C$35.
<p>
   The new base rate on flights to countries besides the U.S. also
will be 8 percent, down from 9 percent. No maximum payment amounts
will be set, the carriers said.
<p>
   The current 9 percent commission paid on tickets for flights
within Canada won't change, they said.
<p>
   ``Air Canada must reduce commissions expenses on transborder and
international sales in order to remain cost competitive,'' said
Marc Rosenberg, vice president of sales and product distribution at
Montreal-based Air Canada, the country's largest carrier.
<p>
   Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian was simply matching the industry
move to lower rates, said Barbara Amster, Canadian Airlines' senior
vice president of marketing and sales.
<p>
   The rate changes will take effect Nov. 1, the airlines said.
<p>
   Air Canada shares rose C$0.75 to C$13.15 in Toronto. Canadian
Airlines rose C$0.11 to C$3.32.
<p>
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines last week cut agent commissions to 8
percent from 10 percent in a bid to cut costs. This week Delta Air
Lines Inc. and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines matched the cut.
<p>
   Air Canada and Chicago-based United Airlines last week were
granted antitrust immunity by the U.S. government, allowing the
carriers to proceed with their proposed marketing alliance.
<p>
   In the first half of 1997, Air Canada paid C$203 million in
commissions, up from C$191 million in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Canadian Airlines is one-third owned by AMR of Fort Worth,
Texas. Canada's second-largest carrier paid C$121 million in
commissions in the first half of 1997, down from C$152.6 million a
year ago.

   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Washington, D.C. stocks rose
this week, led by the shares of Provident Bankshares Corp. and
Computer Data Systems Inc.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Washington Area stock index rose 1.29, or 0.88
percent this week, to 148.29. Of the 276 stocks in the price
weighted index, 145 rose, 16 were unchanged, and 115 fell.
<p>
   This week's rise included a rise of 0.72 today.
<p>
   So far this year the index has risen 30.5 percent. The index is
designed to measure the Washington area economy by tracking the
stock activity of its largest publicly traded companies.
<p>
   Shares of Baltimore's Provident, which owns Provident Bank of
Maryland, rose 6 7/8 to 59 5/8 on trading of 643,000 shares, above
its three-month average weekly volume of 175,545 shares.
<p>
   Provident has 64 branches in the state, and $3.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   Most of this week's rise by Provident's stock came today, when
the shares rose 4 1/4. Analysts couldn't immediately explain the
stock's rise. Provident Chief Operating Officer Peter Martin said
the company also doesn't know why the stock rose, although he
pointed to the fact that bank stocks were generally strong today.
<p>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of regional bank stocks rose 8.41,
or 1.99 percent, to 431.79.
<p>
   Shares of Rockville, Maryland's Computer Data, which provides
computer consulting services mainly to government agencies, rose 6
3/4 to 43 on trading of 742,000 shares after Affiliated Computer
Services Inc. said it will buy Computer Data for $373 million in
stock and assumed debt.
<p>
   The average weekly volume of Computer Data shares is 105,210
shares.
<p>
   Medimmune Inc., a Gaithersburg, Maryland-based maker of drugs
used to prevent infections in kidney transplant patients and
infants, rose 3 to 34 on trading of 5.3 million shares, more than
eight times its average weekly volume. President and Chief

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Wyche Fowler, President Clinton's nominee to be
U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, has promised to help a San
Francisco woman whose two daughters were abducted from the United
States by their father, a Saudi national.
<p>
   Fowler told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in written
testimony this week that he would ``work for a long-term
satisfactory solution to this case.''
<p>
   Eleven years ago, Patricia Roush's ex-husband, Khalid
Al-Gheshayan, took their daughters to Saudi Arabia, and she has
seen them only once since then.
<p>
   Roush, who works as a home nurse, and Al-Gheshayan had their
first child in 1978 and their second in 1982. Shortly afterward,
Al-Gehshayan returned to his home country alone.
<p>
   In January 1985, Roush and the two children joined him in Saudi
Arabia in a failed reconciliation attempt. After a few months, she
and the children returned to the United States, where she filed for
divorce and was awarded sole custody.
<p>
   In January 1986, Al-Gheshayan went to Chicago, where Roush and
the girls were then living, for a visit and suddenly took the
children to Saudi Arabia. According to Saudi law, he has sole
custody.
<p>
   Roush has been trying to get her daughters back ever since. In a
letter to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, she
praised Fowler's predecessor, former U.S. Ambassador Raymond Mabus,
calling him ``very effective'' in his efforts to help her.
<p>
   But she charged that Fowler, who took the post in a
congressional recess appointment in August 1996, has not helped.
<p>
   ``Wyche Fowler had over one year to assist in any way to help
get my girls home, and yet he did nothing,'' she wrote in opposing
his confirmation. ``Let's give someone else a chance, not Mr.
Fowler.''
<p>
   Roush said Mabus had tried to pressure her ex-husband by
refusing to grant visas to members of his family who wanted to
visit the United States, but that Fowler had lifted the ban on the
visas.
<p>
   In response to questions submitted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., Fowler wrote that withholding the visas ``would not
guarantee (Al-Gheshayan's) compliance'' with U.S. requests for the
return of the children.
<p>
   Fowler also said he had arranged for Roush to visit her
daughters this year in Saudi Arabia at no cost to her.
<p>
   He called the Saudi government ``determined and helpful within
the possibilities of Saudi law'' in trying to resolve the issue.
<p>
   But Roush said the Saudis had ``never cooperated'' with the U.S.
government on the case. She said she plans to hold a hunger strike
in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington in October.
<p>
   She also dismissed Fowler's offer of a free visit to Saudi
Arabia, saying she wants something more substantial than her
two-hour visit in 1995.
<p>
   Fowler's confirmation has been temporarily blocked by Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., who requested more information from him. An aide
to Ashcroft declined to reveal the questions Ashcroft had but said
they were ``run of the mill'' inquiries. Fowler's nomination is
expected to be approved.

   Cupertino, California, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Computer
Inc. said it plans to simplify how it sells its computers to
distributors and resellers, aiming to boost the number of places
where people can buy the computers.
<p>
   The computer maker also said it will add 100 people to work with
resellers, the companies that buy the computers from Apple and
then, in turn, sell them to end customers and smaller stores.
<p>
   Apple also said it plans to allow more resellers to buy direct
from Apple by lowering the amount of computers needed to be
purchased to $2 million annually from the current $20 million for
dealers and $5 million for retailers.
<p>
   The Cupertino, California-based company said it is also taking
steps to remove inventory from the warehouses of dealers and
resellers, so that supply will more closely match demand. The moves
are similar to those in early summer by Compaq Computer Corp., the
leading maker of personal computers.
<p>
   Apple shares rose 3/16 to 21 5/16. The company announced the
sales strategy after the markets closed.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The Dunn cabernet is flowing, the antelope is to
die for, Willie Nelson is about to take the stage and, all in all,
the 1,900 attendees of the 27th Montgomery Securities annual
investment conference here are in a darn good mood.
<p>
   ``Hey, it's a bull market for growth stocks,'' said Gary
DiSilvestri, a money manager from Stamford, Conn., as he practiced
lassoing a cowgirl named Theresa Ogas, imported for the occasion
from the Riata Ranch in Exeter, Calif.
<p>
   DiSilvestri was correct: Montgomery's growth stock index is up
47 percent since it bottomed out in April. At last year's
conference, which followed a summer decline, money managers were
slapping one another on the back with far less frequency at the
quote machines, several in attendance recalled.
<p>
   And after a six-month recovery, winter brought another down
cycle in the technology, health care, media and financial services
stocks in which Montgomery specializes.
<p>
   This led some people to feel a trifle uneasy about the
celebratory abandon that marked Montgomery's weeklong event.
<p>
   ``It must be what it felt like in 1929,'' said the president of
a global asset management firm based in New York, who declined to
give his name. ``You have to wonder how many future cab drivers are
in the room. It's crazy, it's very lavish  &MD;  but it's part of the
game.''
<p>
   Montgomery's conferences, aimed at luring fund managers from the
East Coast and keeping them away from Bay Area competitors while
they're here, are notorious for unabashed excess.
<p>
   But repeat visitors deemed this year's event the most
over-the-top to date. Monday night's Western-theme social was
followed on Tuesday by a Mardi Gras party complete with deep-fried
alligator, the Neville Brothers and fortune tellers.
<p>
   Dana Carvey, the comic of ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Wayne's
World'' fame, was the headliner on Thursday night.
<p>
   Not forgotten were spouses (read: wives, as the crowd was 90
percent men in suits and ties). Their daytime activities included a
wine tour of the Napa Valley and lunch at the home of Thomas W.
Weisel, Montgomery's chairman, with a guided tour of his art
collection led by the chief curator of the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art.
<p>
   But then, the company has cause for a little extra extravagance
this year, even beyond the revival of growth stocks. Hugh L. McColl
Jr., the Monday keynote speaker and the chief executive of
Nationsbank, just paid $1.2 billion to acquire Montgomery  &MD;  a
premium far greater than that paid by other commercial banks in
recent deals to acquire investment banks.
<p>
   Montgomery's 68 partners are expected to collect an average of
$17.6 million each.
<p>
   Weisel brushes off comparisons to the legendary improvidence of
Michael R. Milken's so-called predators' balls, noting that the
optimistic forecast for growth stocks has its roots in an
unvarnished economic analysis that is a far cry from junk bonds.
<p>
   For one thing, despite their recent ascent, the stocks in
Montgomery's index of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the
United States are selling at an average of 87 percent of their
expected 1998 earnings growth rate. By contrast, those in the S&AMP;P
500 are at 190 percent of expected growth rates.

<p>
   Moreover, ``accelerated earnings growth and global wage
deflation are going to continue to drive stock prices in the growth
segments of the U.S. economy,'' Weisel said.
<p>
   Indeed, the institutional investors who jammed the first floor
of the Ritz-Carlton here seemed particularly enamored of companies
that did away with wages altogether. For instance, Christos M.
Cotsakos, chief executive of E-Trade, the Internet brokerage
company, was the buzz of the conference after his presentation.
<p>
   Cotsakos showcased the firm's advertising campaign, which
lampoons investing stereotypes. In one ad, a spoof of the old E.F.
Hutton commercials, two women are chatting in a restaurant. One
leans over and asks, ``So what does your broker say?'' As the
restaurant falls silent, her companion replies, ``I don't use a
broker.'' She uses E-Trade, which has 230,000 accounts and averages
17,000 transactions a day, of which, Montgomery analysts like to
point out ``only 14 percent require human intervention.''
<p>
   Only about 3 percent of the 60 million retail brokerage accounts
in the United States are handled on line, making the field, in
Montgomery's eyes, ripe for growth.
<p>
   Another popular theme at the conference was the growth potential
in the privatization of public institutions like schools and
prisons. The Corrections Corp. of America, which contracts with
governments to manage prisons, and the CBT Group, which develops
interactive training software, both drew big crowds. (So did an
analyst workshop on semiconductors entitled ``Staying Alive.'' But
attendance there may have been bolstered by a strobe-lit
performance by Montgomery associates, who, in a takeoff on an Intel
TV ad, wore white clean-room suits and danced to music from that
disco classic, ``Saturday Night Fever.'')
<p>
   ``Almost 40 percent of the GDP growth is tied to the
infotechnology business,'' said John K. Skeen, Montgomery's senior
managing director of research. ``As a result of that you have very
serious investment opportunities.''
<p>
   Skeen described the mood of the conference as ``ebullient'' but
not ``giddy,'' as the Beverly Hills predators' balls of the 1980s
were so often described.
<p>
   ``We might happen to have Willie Nelson or Dana Carvey, but
there are no limos driving people to these events  &MD;  we take
buses,'' he said, referring to the shuttles chartered for the
purpose. ``I seem to recall in Lalaland they were traveling in
sleds with hot tubs in the back.''
<p>
   To be sure, there was no slacking during the workday among the
attendees, whose firms control over $5 trillion of equity
investments, and the 235 presenters, whose market value comes to
about $1.2 trillion.
<p>
   ``We get to talk to more investors here than in any other
forum,'' said Thomas G. Stemberg, chief executive of Staples, the
office-supply retailer, as he hurried from his presentation to the
closed-to-the-media breakout sessions, where executives are grilled
on all aspects of their business.
<p>
   Breakfast started at 6:30 a.m. and was cleared promptly at 7:30.
Attendees packed the high-technology TV room on the hotel's second
floor, where in a feat of extreme multitasking they could watch
four presentations simultaneously.
<p>
   So why not let loose a little in the evenings?
<p>
   ``Is it too much?'' asked Ron Jacks, a portfolio manager at
Seneca Capital Management, sipping a Dixie beer last Tuesday
evening. ``If it is, it'll become evident  &MD;  five years later.''

<p>
   The storyline of Dr. Seuss' ``Cat in the Hat'' is probably
familiar to most parents: Two children are left alone at home on a
rainy day. A cat in a hat comes to the door, and turns out to be a
disguised worker from the Division of Children and Family Services
who takes the children into protective custody and arrests the
mother for child neglect.
<p>
   No, wait, that's the PC  &MD;  politically correct  &MD;  version, not the
version for the PC.
<p>
   In that version, the cat in the hat comes to entertain the
children, balances common household items on his hat while he
stands on a ball, upsets the family goldfish, brings in a box and
releases Thing One and Thing Two from it, who promptly reduce the
house to shambles, and finally helps the kids put the place back in
order and disappears as Mom walks in the door.
<p>
   ``I call this game, `Fun in a Box,''' The Cat in the Hat tells
the two kids before unleashing Thing One and Thing Two.
<p>
   I call The Cat In the Hat from Living Books ``fun in a box,''
too. This is the third release in the company's Dr. Seuss series
(joining ``Green Eggs and Ham'' and ``Dr. Seuss's ABCs''), and it
is by far the most interactive.
<p>
   Designed for children ages 3 to 7, The Cat in the Hat
(Windows/Macintosh; about $30-35) is another entry in the
``storybook'' category  &MD;  but it's more than just another entry.
More about that in a moment.
<p>
   This story unfolds on the computer screen in pages, each with
text that changes color as words are read aloud to the child. In
some cases, the words turn into the things they represent. Click on
the things; they turn back into words. On the pages, children can
click on objects which come to life  &MD;  a fisherman appears in a
picture on the wall and throws a line to the fish in the bowl on
the table below, for instance. Lamps dance.
<p>
   It's cute and entertaining. What makes it a cut above the rest
of the storybooks on the market is that it has some new concepts I
haven't seen used in other storybooks.
<p>
   One of the neat ones: If the child clicks on a picture of a man
on the wall, his facial features will fall to the bottom of the
frame. ``Oh, I've fallen apart! Help me get back together.'' By
holding down the left mouse button, children can pick up the eyes,
ears, nose, mouth and other parts and place them on the face.
<p>
   It's a way of learning to use the mouse while helping teach
eye-hand coordination and show the relationships among objects.
<p>
   Knock up to four times on the red box containing Thing One and
Thing Two, and they'll knock back the same number of times  &MD;  and in
the same rhythm the child knocks on the box. The programmers could
have just as easily knocked by the same number  &MD;  but duplicating
the rhythm adds a special touch. Attention to detail like that
makes The Cat In the Hat stand out.
<p>
   The Cat In the Hat tries to grab as many objects in the house as
he can to balance them on his hands, hat, feet and elbows while
bouncing on a ball. The software allows the children to move the
objects around, and, depending on weight and placement, the cat
will lean to one side or the other. Once again, it's a way of
learning without seeming to be taught.
<p>
   And the child gets to help the cat run his long-armed Clean Up
Machine to pick up the mess created during the afternoon.
<p>
   On the first page, a purple duck appears if the child clicks on
the right object. (Try the door behind the cat.) It won't take long
for the child to discover the duck is hidden on every page
thereafter.
<p>
   The ``Cat in the Hat'' paperback is included with the software.
A special School Edition contains the CD, storybook and a booklet
of 15 rainy-day activities for the classroom to help teachers get
students to expand their creativity, imagination and appreciation
of rainy days.
<p>
   And, in case you missed them the first time around, a Dr. Seuss
Library boxed set containing ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' ``Dr. Seuss's
ABCs'' and ``The Cat in the Hat'' is also available.

BURN CRACKS UNDER PRESSURE, LOSES, 2-1, TO REVOLUTION &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By JILL R. DORSON &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS  &MD;  ``Pressure is one of our tactical strengths. If we can
do it the right way, with concentration and discipline, we can
exploit our other virtues.''
<p>
   So said a message on the blackboard in the Dallas Burn's locker
room last night. As it turned out, pressure was the Burn's undoing
in a 2-1 Major League Soccer loss to the New England Revolution at
the Cotton Bowl.
<p>
   The loss means that the Burn, which has had the opportunity to
clinch second in the Western Conference in each of its past two
outings, must wait for the result of Sunday's Los Angeles-Kansas
City game to find out where it finishes the regular season. If
third-place LA wins that game, the Galaxy will finish second and
the Burn third. If LA loses, Dallas will finish second and the
Galaxy third.
<p>
   In either case, the Burn will play the Galaxy in the first round
of the playoffs beginning Oct. 5.
<p>
   ``It was just disheartening,'' Burn coach Dave Dir said. ``It
was like two halves ... in the second half, we couldn't pass to
white shirts, nobody was smart enough to hold on to the ball. No
one showed the experience to hold the ball, we started forcing
things.''
<p>
   And the pressure began to build against an Eastern Conference
team that was fighting for a playoff spot. The Revolution clinched
the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference not only because of
its own victory, but because Columbus beat New York/New Jersey,
1-0, also last night.
<p>
   ``We knew the result of the Columbus-New York/New Jersey game,
so we knew three points would get us in, so we wanted the result,''
said New England coach Thomas Rongen, whose team learned at
halftime of the Columbus-NY/NJ result. ``It wasn't pretty, but we
got what we came for.''
<p>
   Dallas (16-16) owned New England (15-17) in the first half,
outshooting and outscoring the Revolution. The Burn scored in the
31st minute when Gerrell Elliott, in only his 12th start of the
season, scored on a follow-up shot to the near post. Elliott
initially took a shot that New England goalkeeper Walter Zenga
deflected. Forward Damian Alvarez fired the rebound back at Zenga,
who made a diving save, but Elliott had time to settle the
deflection and shoot before Zenga could regain position.
<p>
   ``In the first half, we played one and two touches, kept good
possession and played well through the midfield,'' Dir said. ``In
the second half, the few times the midfield did get the ball, it
didn't pass (well).''
<p>
   The Burn had nine shots to the Revolution's six and five shots
on goal to New England's three.
<p>
   But a penalty-kick goal by New England's Joe-Max Moore in the
58th minute changed the tone of the game. The Revolution picked up
the pace and picked off Dallas passes, ultimately scoring in the
88th minute when Paul Keegan, who came in during the 10th minute
when Imad Baba left the game with a back injury, beat Mark Dodd
from inside the penalty area. The goal was Keegan's first of the
season.
<p>
   ``Obviously, that team was fighting for their lives up to the
last minute,'' Dodd said.

SCOTT IS TROUBLED, NOT TROUBLE, MAGIC OFFICIAL SAYS &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By DWAIN PRICE &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Orlando Magic executive Pat Williams indicated Dennis Scott's
off-season troubles are part of the reason he's now with the
Mavericks. But Williams, the Magic's senior executive vice
president, said Orlando didn't dump its garbage on the Mavericks'
doorstep.
<p>
   In July, Scott, who was acquired by the Mavericks in a Wednesday
trade that sent Derek Harper and Ed O'Bannon to the Orlando Magic,
subjected children at his own youth basketball camp to a
profanity-laced tirade. On Sept. 5, Scott rented a hotel ballroom
and was host of a party for his 29th birthday at which two people
were injured by gunshots.
<p>
   ``Dennis is a good guy,'' Williams said yesterday. ``I kind of
sensed Dennis was upset, angry and troubled with the organization
and worried about his next contract.
<p>
   ``Let's just call it an aberration. Let's call it mental
wandering, and let's hope Dennis will come in and just focus
totally on basketball. I think he'll benefit from the change of
scenery. I think starting over will be great for him.''
<p>
   A free agent after this coming season, Scott has played all
seven of his NBA seasons with the Magic after it made the former
Georgia Tech star the fourth pick of the 1990 draft. He has
averaged 14.8 points in his career and shot .422 from the field.
<p>
   Former Mavericks guard Rolando Blackman, who was hired yesterday
to work for the NBA's community services TEAM department, said
Scott will help the Mavs tremendously.
<p>
   ``He's going to have to work a little bit harder on the
defensive end of the court and get some more rebounds,'' Blackman
said. ``But instead of saying he's a bad person, I think he just
snapped during the time at that basketball camp.
<p>
   ``All of the times I've been around him, I've never heard of
Dennis getting in any kind of trouble whatsoever.''
<p>
   Dave Heeren, who writes a basketball column for CBS Sportsline
on the Internet and invented the TENDEX rating system, said Scott
has been a product of media hype and that it will soon be
discovered by Mavericks fans that he is overrated. Under TENDEX,
the average rating for every small forward in the NBA this past
season was 483. Scott's rating was 376.
<p>
   ``He's a very bad player, but he's a very good 3-point
shooter,'' Heeren said. ``I defy you to tell me anything else he
does well.
<p>
   ``He doesn't have any inside moves to get his own shot. If he's
not open at the 3-point line, forget it.''
<p>
   Scott has career averages of 3.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and one
blocked shot. He also is a career .403 shooter from 3-point land,
and set a single-season NBA record for 3-pointers made two seasons
ago with 267.
<p>
   ``Dennis can flat-out win you seven to 10 games in a given
season,'' Orlando general manager John Gabriel said. ``He has the
ability to shoot you into games to give you a chance to win, or win
them for you down the stretch.''
<p>
   Scott and former Magic superstar Shaquille O'Neal are close
friends, and Williams said when O'Neal moved to the Los Angeles
Lakers last summer, Scott suffered. His 12.5 points per game and
.398 shooting percentage last season were the worst of his career.
<p>
   ``The two of them were great for each other, and I think Dennis
missed that and will never have that luxury again,'' Williams said.
``But Dennis is now with an organization where a lot of plays can
be run his way, and he can be one of the prime scorers.''

COWBOYS PRACTICE PROTECTING THE QB &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   IRVING, Texas  &MD;  The Arizona Cardinals blitzed their way to a
25-22 overtime victory against the Cowboys in Week 2.
<p>
   Philadelphia blindsided quarterback Troy Aikman with its pass
rush to forge a 17-6 halftime lead before the Cowboys rallied to
21-20 victory the next week.
<p>
   The Cowboys coaches calculated that the Bears blitzed New
England quarterback Drew Bledsoe ``80 percent of the time'' in a
31-3 loss last week.
<p>
   Cowboys coach Barry Switzer expects more of the same ``from all
directions'' when the 0-4 Bears come to Texas Stadium for Sunday's
3 p.m. game. And during the past two weeks, the Cowboys practiced
like they're in a rush to correct this problem handling the pass
rush.
<p>
   ``We've been practicing for it all,'' Cowboys coach Barry
Switzer said. ``Most teams that are desperate ... they let it all
hang out. They are gambling (with the blitz) trying to make
something happen and create turnovers with their defense. That's
what they should do. They might as well roll the dice.''
<p>
   The Cowboys addressed the pass-protection issue the past two
weeks. The practice was an effort to work on recognition, which
combined with tactics such as a no-huddle offense might help the
Cowboys' offense handle blitzes better.
<p>
   Aikman saw progress during practice but said playing a game is
the only true test.
<p>
   ``We've worked on different things,'' Aikman said. ``I think
we've improved. But you don't get to stop the drill in the middle
of a game and correct. We'll find out Sunday.''
<p>
   In the past two games, Aikman been sacked five times for 42
yards. The difficulty might be a result of facing more blitzes
simply because the blitz has become a widespread trend across the
league in 1997.
<p>
   And it might be partly because the Cardinals and Eagles caught
the Cowboys off guard. Fullback Daryl Johnston said both teams
added new wrinkles to their blitz packages.
<p>
   ``We were out-schemed against Arizona and Philadelphia,''
Johnston said. ``Arizona waited for us to go to a single-back set
and into a spread formation and then moved everybody inside. They
had more guys inside than we could block. We didn't get the ball
out quick enough.''
<p>
   Thinking that Philadelphia would do the same because of
Arizona's success, Johnston said the Cowboys prepared for the
middle blitz, but the Eagles came from the outside with cornerback
Bobby Taylor.
<p>
   Since the Eagles game, the Cowboys have practiced against
blitzes from every imaginable direction. Offensive tackle Mark
Tuinei said now it's just a matter of picking them out during
games.
<p>
   ``Being prepared for anything is basically what it's going to
come down to,'' Tuinei said. ``You got to be prepared for any type
of blitz and any type of different change up. It's not just the
offensive line. It's the responsibility of the entire offensive
unit.''
<p>
   The Cowboys used the no-huddle offense on some third downs
against Philadelphia to discourage the Eagles from substituting and
getting into their blitz packages. The Cowboys plan to continue to
use the same strategy the rest of the season, though the no-huddle
might not be employed as much Sunday because the Bears don't
substitute as much as the Eagles.
<p>
   The Cowboys also know that if they pick up the blitz, they can
make big plays. That's especially true against the Bears, whose
gambling tactics have resulted in opponents burning them for 18
plays of 20 yards or more.
<p>
   ``I enjoy playing blitzing teams,'' Cowboys receiver Michael
Irvin said. ``With the guys up front and our running backs, if we
give Troy protection, you can pick that type of defense apart.''

MAVS' FORTUNE IMPROVES WITH WINK OF AN EYE &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By GIL LeBRETON &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   All the trades. All the billboards. All the TV commercials. All
the trips home to Maui.
<p>
   For a few minutes there, I, too, was beginning to believe in
Santa Claus.
<p>
   But with a twinkle in his eye and maybe a wee too much
orneriness flowing through his veins, Don Nelson  &MD;  the jolly old
St. Nelly of the Mavericks  &MD;  let his guard down Wednesday night.
<p>
   Having acquired the enigmatic, and occasionally bloated, Dennis
Scott, general manager Nelson announced, ``This puts us in a
position to make a legitimate playoff run.''
<p>
   It was the first time that anyone had put the words
``Mavericks'' and ``playoffs'' in the same sentence in nearly a
decade, and the pronouncement in the morning paper had to send
oatmeal flying at breakfast tables everywhere.
<p>
   ``Well,'' Nelson corrected yesterday, ``what I said was that I
thought we were playoff ``contenders,'' and I really believe that.
<p>
   ``I think with the weapons we've added and the pieces we now
have, I can see us fighting for the seventh, eighth, ninth spots.''
<p>
   Gasp. Clearly, that would constitute a quantum leap in local
basketball fortunes. Yet, Nelly seems roundly unabashed by his
``prediction.''
<p>
   But that's when it hit me. All the mega-deals. All the
earnest-sounding radio ads. All the positive report cards being
issued from Nelson's island retreat in Hawaii.
<p>
   When he dropped the P-word  &MD;  playoffs  &MD;  he let his guard down.
He ruined the illusion. The magician accidentally dropped the
rabbit.
<p>
   This is no playoff team. And no one knows that better than coach
Jim Cleamons, who has suddenly had his job expectations elevated a
few notches.
<p>
   You see, in Nelly's mind, we're all NBA bumpkins. We traded away
Jason Kidd. We let a real estate guy run the franchise. We don't
know if the basketball is blown up or stuffed.
<p>
   The real estate guy, brandishing the billionaire owner's credit
card, flew all the way out to Maui to talk Nelly into coming to
Dallas and rescuing the franchise.
<p>
   So it has been easy for Nelson to feel like Santa Claus.
<p>
   But look what he just left in Cleamons' stocking.
<p>
   Cleamons has been gifted with, by Nelly's own description, a
more fun, more exciting, more weapons-laden team. Nelson just got
Cleamons a guy who was once the NBA's best 3-point shooter.
<p>
   Cleamons, alas, might have preferred a guy whose best offensive
move is getting back on defense.
<p>
   Given his background, he has been handed a formula for failure  &MD; 
and a laboratory filled with gurgling cauldrons.
<p>
   I didn't see Nelly wink when he said ``playoffs'' the other
night. But I thought I heard Jim Cleamons gulp.
<p>
   The trade, ironically, is not a bad one. Now headed for his
third team in three seasons, Ed O'Bannon has yet to raise a blip on
the NBA radar. And while veteran Derek Harper, the franchise's
conscience, will be missed by Mavericks fans, most would agree that
he was more valuable to the new regime as trade bait than as bench
warmer.
<p>
   If Scott can keep his frame at 229 pounds, down from last
season's ponderous 260, maybe he can regain his shooting touch. And
the Mavericks would be blessed to have a 6-8 forward who can
actually shoot a field goal.
<p>
   People who have watched Scott for seven NBA seasons say they are
clueless why, after his buddy Shaquille O'Neal went away, Dennis
seemed to go wacko down in Orlando. He didn't used to be like that.
<p>
   Columnist Larry Guest of the ``Orlando Sentinel'' wrote of the
old Scott, ``He was often the voice of reason on the court. His
defense was better than advertised. His upbeat and friendly
interaction with the media and fans were refreshing beacons among
too many surly and reticent teammates. Then childlike innocence
gave way to ugly childishness that the (Magic owners) didn't
deserve.''
<p>
   Want to know how much influence Nelson wields over the Mavericks
organization? Consider that this was the same franchise that
labeled Jason Kidd, Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson as varying
degrees of bad influences. Now Nelson can even convince majority
owner Ross Perot Jr. that Scott's gun-slinging, Washington, D.C.,
birthday party and his rap tirade at a kids basketball camp were
``incidents'' that won't happen again.
<p>
   I wonder if, when they met this week, Junior Perot asked Scott
anything about Dennis' next scheduled bash that he has planned this
weekend in Orlando?
<p>
   Talk about symbolism. At his introductory news conference
Wednesday, Scott had on a black cowboy hat. For years, of course,
the Mavs were symbolized by owner Don Carter's ever-present white
hat.
<p>
   But those days are long gone, of course. The few months now seem
like years.
<p>
   The Mavericks are selling fun and excitement this season. And,
oh, yes, a possible sleigh ride to the NBA playoffs. Jim Cleamons
or bust.
<p>
   Let's see. Blown up, isn't it?

THE 2000 BUG IS MOSTLY HUMBUG &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm afraid that if I buy the wrong type of
computer, it won't work after 1999. Is it true we'll have to
replace all our computers and software because of the 2000 bug?
<p>
    &MD; Thoroughly modern millennium
<p>
   DEAR MILL: All across this great land of ours, hardware
manufacturers and software publishers must be angrily slapping
their foreheads in unison, disgusted with themselves for missing
the most incredible opportunity they're ever likely to see.
<p>
   The public is so dumb  &MD;  well, uninformed  &MD;  that these guys
probably could have gotten away with telling everybody that if they
didn't buy all new stuff before 2000, invisible blue fairies would
rip the fabric of the space-time continuum to shreds, turning us
all into our own grandparents. Instead, they stupidly told the
truth: that most consumer hardware and software is already
2000-compliant. That's good news for you, plus I'm hoping it will
put an end to my recurring nightmare about French-kissing Grandma.
<p>
   For those of you who have real lives and are too busy with them
to pay attention when geeks start yammering at one another, the
2000 bug refers to some computers' and programs' inability to deal
with a four-digit date. When the year rolls over from 99 to 00,
they either think it's 1900, or they completely freak out and sit
there catatonically trying to deal with a reality beyond their
scope of reference.
<p>
   Well, guess what? Unless you're working with stuff that belongs
in a museum instead of your house, the odds are pretty good  &MD; 
excellent, actually  &MD;  that you don't have a thing to worry about.
<p>
   You see, even though everybody is running around screaming that
the sky is about to fall, they've been anticipating it for years
and have already made provisions for it. Even Bill Gates isn't
trying to sell you anything new, which may be a first.
<p>
   Macintosh users should have no hardware problems. Even the very
first Mac will recognize dates as far into the future as 2040, but
after the year Apple has had, I'd imagine they'll be happy just to
see 1998.
<p>
   Older PCs might have some problems, but there are already fixes.
PCs have this battery-powered dealie that keeps track of the time.
When you turn the computer on, the dealie reports the time to the
computer's BIOS (Bill Is Our Sun-god) chip. If either thing can't
handle the concept of 2000, there can be trouble, but not so much
that you can't overcome it.
<p>
   Even if your computer comes up with a bogus date, you can set it
manually. DOS, the basic set of programs that makes your PC work,
can understand dates as high as 2108, which coincidentally is the
year that Bill plans to have himself thawed out to proclaim his
dominion over all the peoples of the Earth.
<p>
   If setting the date gets to be a pain, go over to
www.rightime.com and download Year2000.zip, which contains a
utility that's supposed to take care of that. It's free. Can you
believe it? Can't ANYBODY understand the concept of a shakedown?
<p>
   You can also just replace the BIOS chip, or if you buy Windows
NT or Windows 98  &MD;  assuming that Windows 98 is actually released
before 2000  &MD;  the problem is taken care of automatically.
<p>
   Even if all the hardware works, you may still be using some
program that can't manage 2000. If so, you have two options: Either
replace the software or, if you're too cheap to do that, lie to
your computer. Tell it that it's still 1998. Who's gonna know?

PROFESSOR HILL, I DO BELIEVE YOU, BUT ... &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By BILL THOMPSON &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   If you were Anita Hill, would you want to dredge it all up again
now  &MD;  six years after it happened, six years after Clarence Thomas
handed you your head on a platter, six years after your critics all
but trampled one another in the rush to call you a liar on network
television?
<p>
   Surely not.
<p>
   But it says here that Hill has written a book rehashing those
tumultuous October days in 1991, when she nearly derailed Thomas'
nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court by claiming that he had made
unwelcome sexual advances toward her and engaged in other conduct
that could be defined as sexual harassment. Hill never used the
term ``sexual harassment'' in describing Thomas' alleged behavior,
but just about everybody else used it until most of us were tired
of hearing it.
<p>
   Remember what happened? Thomas, appointed to the Supreme Court
by then-President Bush, was on the verge of confirmation by the
Senate when Hill surfaced with her claim that Thomas had behaved
inappropriately when she worked for him at two federal agencies
back in the early 1980s.
<p>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee, which evaluates Supreme Court
nominees, was inclined to ignore the allegation but succumbed to
public pressure and held a televised hearing.
<p>
   The hearing touched off a nasty but compelling media circus that
provoked much argument about the issue of sexual harassment.
Despite the spectacle and the accompanying controversy, Thomas was
confirmed by the Senate and claimed his lifetime seat on the
Supreme Court.
<p>
   Hill went back to her job as a law professor at the University
of Oklahoma, where she was given a hero's welcome. It may have been
one of the few places in America where Hill was considered a hero;
public-opinion polls showed that a majority of Americans figured
her for a liar and a political partisan who made up the charges
against Thomas in hopes of keeping him off the Supreme Court.
<p>
   The pollsters didn't ask my opinion, but if they had, I would
have sided with Hill. I believed her.
<p>
   ``How could you believe her?'' a friend demanded, as if the very
idea of taking Hill at her word was so preposterous as to be
unexplainable.
<p>
   Come to think of it, I couldn't explain it. I just believed her.
She seemed credible to me.
<p>
   Thomas  &MD;  whose nomination I had supported right up to the moment
that Hill burst onto the scene  &MD;  did not seem credible. The
nominee's thunderously indignant protestations of innocence struck
me as contrived, even theatrical. All that bluster, all that
righteous anger, seemed orchestrated.
<p>
   Thomas did protest too much, I thought.
<p>
   An innocent man, it seemed to me, might have scratched his head
and said: ``Gee, I can't imagine where she came up with this stuff.
None of it sounds familiar to me. But, you know, if I said or did
something that she might have misconstrued or found offensive,
well, golly, I'm really sorry.''
<p>
   That's my subjective judgment, of course. There is no prescribed
reaction for a man who is wrongly accused of sexual harassment  &MD; 
just as there is no prescribed reaction for a woman who is sexually
harassed.
<p>
   Lots of people disbelieved Hill because they thought she did or
didn't do certain things that a person confronted with sexual
harassment would or wouldn't do. No one can say with authority what
she should have done or when she should have done it  &MD;  any more
than someone can say how Thomas should have reacted when confronted
with Hill's allegations.
<p>
   One of two things happened in October 1991, and either would be
awful: Hill was lying, which means that a terrible injustice was
done to Thomas and to the nation; or Hill was telling the truth,
which means we have a sexual harasser on the nation's highest
court.
<p>
   But one good thing came out of the turmoil and controversy. The
Hill-Thomas showdown awakened the nation to the issue of sexual
harassment, a very real problem that had been ignored, denied and
covered up for far too long.
<p>
   So there was a bright side to one of America's darker episodes.
<p>
   But that doesn't explain why Hill would want to dredge it up
again.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The owner of two
Pennsylvania investment adviser firms was charged by the Securities
and Exchange Commission today with defrauding 75 school districts
in the state.
<p>
   The districts lost $71 million from $233 million invested
through Devon Capital Management and its affiliate, Financial
Management Sciences, both in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, the SEC said.
The firms are owned by John Gardner Black, who the SEC accused of
diverting at least $2 million to personal and business expenses.
``This is a serious fraud because these are public funds put up by
school districts,'' said SEC enforcement director William McLucas.
``It affects taxpayers, citizens, and clearly school districts.''
<p>
   Black, who lives in Broad Top, Pennsylvania, couldn't be reached
for comment. SEC officials said they did not know whether Black is
represented by an attorney. Black's two firms manage $345 million
in assets for about 100 clients, most of which are school districts
seeking to invest municipal bond proceeds, the SEC said.
<p>
   The SEC lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Pittsburgh,
accused Black of failing to tell the districts of his funds
diversion and trading losses. He also misrepresented the value of
the collateral he had available for their securities investments,
the complaint said.
<p>
   It is not clear just how many millions of dollars the districts,
in western and central Pennsylvania, lost as a result of fraud,
McLucas said. U.S. District Judge William Standish appointed former
U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh as trustee of Black's
funds, which the judge froze.
<p>
   At least $50 million of the losses stemmed from Black's trading,
which may not have been fraudulent, said Ronald Long, head of the
SEC's regional office in Philadelphia. At least $2 million more was
diverted by Black for his personal and professional use, he said.
<p>
   Among the districts defrauded were Allegheny East, Bald Eagle
Area, Bethlehem Area, Big Beaver Falls, Blacklick,
Cornwall/Lebanon, Daniel Boone, Hatboro Horsham, Lancaster, Mercer
Area, Penns Manor and Susquehanna Township.
<p>
   This was the largest municipal fraud in Pennsylvania history,
Long said.

<p>
   Menasha, Wisconsin, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Banta Corp. said it
will sell or discontinue three businesses and close three packaging
plants, resulting in a third-quarter charge of $8.2 million, to
focus on its main printing services.
<p>
   The charge will trim earnings by 27 cents a share, Banta said.
The Menasha, Wisconsin-based company had net income of $15.3
million, or 49 cents, on revenue of $264.6 million in the year-ago
period.
<p>
   Banta plans to focus on its educational and general book
publishing businesses, as well as online and interactive media.
About 140 employees work in the businesses that are up for sale.
<p>
   Negotiations are under way to sell KCS Industries to a
management-led group, Banta said. The sign business, which has 100
employees, had sales of about $10 million to $15 million in 1996.
Banta plans to retain KCS Industries' printing business, whose 75
employees make labels.
<p>
   Banta also said it's in early discussions to sell its Boston
video-production and CD-ROM interactive-software business, DI
Group, to an unnamed buyer. Banta might retain some of DI Group's
40 employees to help design World Wide Web sites at its Cambridge,
Massachusetts, online-services unit.
<p>
   In addition, Banta will abandon its intaglio security-printing
business and close its Milwaukee plant, where it had already fired
200 workers. Intaglio printing is used on postage stamps, food
stamps and stock and bond certificates. A joint venture with the
U.S. Postal Service to supply postage stamps won't be renewed when
it expires Tuesday.
<p>
   Banta also said it plans to close three of its global software-
and computer-distribution centers, in Sacramento, California;
Irvine, California; and Provo, Utah. Fewer than 20 full-time
employees, plus some part-time workers and subcontractors, will be
affected, it said.
<p>
   Separately, Banta said it opened new facilities in Union City,
California; Fort Worth, Texas; and Spanish Fork, Utah. The
facilities are near customer sites where they can better manage the
assembly and distribution of computer software packages and
hardware accessories.
<p>
   Banta shares rose 3/16 to 27 15/16 on trading of 268,600 shares,
more than three times its three-month average of 82,100.

<p>
   Montreal, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Seagram Co. said it paid Frank
Biondi Jr., chairman and chief executive of its Universal Studios
Inc. unit, US$6.85 million (C$9.5 million) in salary and bonuses
for the year ended in June.
<p>
   Biondi, the former chief executive of Viacom Inc. who was named
to head Universal in April 1996, was paid a base salary of US$1
million and a bonus of US$5.85 million, according to the company's
proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Biondi has a five-year agreement with Seagram that calls for him to
be paid an annual salary of US$1 million and a bonus of US$4.5
million that could rise as high as US$9 million based on MCA's
performance.
<p>
   Biondi holds 300,000 exercisable options valued at US$1.325
million and holds 1.4 million unexercisable options valued at
US$6.64 million.
<p>
   Seagram's entertainment business contributed a profit of US$1.65
billion in fiscal 1996, a 9.6 percent increase from US$1.51 billion
the year before.
<p>
   The Universal chief was paid more in the year than Seagram
President and CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr., who received US$1 million in
salary and US$3.15 million in bonuses. Bronfman, a former film
producer whose grandfather founded the liquor company, has been
moving Seagram from its beverage and investment roots into
entertainment.
<p>
   One of the world's largest distillers with brands such as V.O.
and Chivas Regal, Seagram disclosed that it paid Lew Wasserman US$1
million in fiscal 1996 as a consultant and advisor. Wasserman, the
MCA's former chairman and CEO, became a consultant and advisor to
Universal exclusively on Jan. 4, 1996, and will be paid an annual
fee of US$1 million until his death or his decision to terminate
the arrangement.
<p>
   Montreal-based Seagram purchased 80 percent of Universal, which
owns Universal Pictures movies studios, theme parks and MCA
Records, in 1995 for US$5.7 billion after the sale of its stake in
DuPont Co. for US$8.7 billion.
<p>
   Seagram this week agreed to buy Viacom's half of their USA
Networks joint venture for US$1.7 billion in cash, giving it a key
component needed to make it a full-fledged entertainment company.

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies with shares that moved in Canadian markets today. The
stock symbol is given in parentheses after the company name. Prices
are closing.
<p>
   Nickel producers rose as the metal's price climbed US$235 a
metric ton to US$6,830 on the London Metal Exchange and inventories
fell 36 metric tons to 60,642. Analysts said there are expectations
producers may have to build up their stockpiles to meet demand
following strikes and operating problems at mines earlier this
year. Falconbridge Ltd. (FL CT) rose C$0.70 to C$25.15, while Inco
Ltd. (N CT) rose C$1.05 to C$34.10, while shares of Inco Class VBN
(N/V), or Voisey's Bay Nickel, rose C$0.75 (US$0.54) to C$21.
<p>
   AGF Management Ltd. (AGF/B CT) rose C$4.50 to C$65.50, a
three-month high, after the fund manager reported third-quarter net
income of C$11.3 million, or C$0.84 a share, up from C$5.8 million,
or C$0.47 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to C462.5 million from
C$47.
<p>
   Alcan Aluminium Ltd. (AL CT) fell C$0.75 to C$47 after analyst
Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch issued a report headlined ``Weak
third quarter prices for fabricated products is affecting
third-quarter earnings expectations.'' Roling said he lowered his
third-quarter and full-year earnings for Alcan.
<p>
   Cameco Corp. (CCO CT) rose C$0.95 to C$51.05 after analyst
Ernest Nutter of RBC Dominion Securities rated shares of the
world's largest publicly traded uranium producer a ``strong buy.
<p>
   Cinram International Inc. (CRW CT) rose C$1.25 to C$49.25, a
52-week high, after analyst Tim Casey of Nesbitt Burns raised his
rating to ``strong buy'' from ``hold.'' Cinram makes pre-recorded
multimedia products like video and audio cassettes and CD-ROMs.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. (CSN CT) rose C$2.80 to C$33.30 as shares of the
computer software company rebounded after falling 32 percent
Thursday when it said growth will slow because customers may delay
purchases to consider buying rival programs. Analyst Joseph Farley,
analyst with UBS Securities in New York, rated the shares a
``strong buy'' with a 12-month target price of US$39.
<p>
   Investors Group Inc. (IGI CT) fell C$1.15 to C$44.25 after
analyst Roy Palmer of TD Securities Inc. lowered his rating from
``hold to reduce simply because of the `run-up' in the share price
in recent weeks.'' Palmer said ``we continue to recommend Investors
Group to long-term investors as we remain bullish both on the
(mutual fund) industry and the company'' and he will switch the
ratings to ``buy'' if the price falls below C$38. Investors reached
a high of C$45.40 on Thursday.
<p>
   JDS Fitel Inc. (JDS CT) rose C$2.70 to C$64.80 after analyst
Thomas Astle of Midland Walwyn rated its shares ``accumulate.'' The
company makes products for the fiber-optics communications market.
<p>
   Northern Telecom Ltd. (NTL CT) rose C41.55 to C$142.70 after

   Hartford, Connecticut, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) --Connecticut stocks
fell for the first time in five weeks as shares of Aetna Inc.
plunged on concern that the health insurer's third-quarter earnings
may be lower than expected.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Connecticut Index fell 1.42 this week, but rose
0.52 today, to 197.46. The index, up 34 percent this year, is a
price-weighted list of 181 Connecticut-based companies' shares
designed to reflect the performance of the state's economy. It
began Dec. 30, 1994, at a base value of 100.
<p>
   Shares of Hartford-based Aetna Inc., provider of health and life
insurance to public and private institutions, slumped 14 1/8 this
week, and rose 3/8 today, to 90 1/2. The stock fell after Merrill
Lynch analyst Margo Vignola lowered her earnings estimates, citing
sluggish revenue growth.
<p>
   ``There is speculation that the third quarter will fall below
expectations,'' said Schroder &AMP; Co. analysts William McKeever.
<p>
   Aetna hasn't commented on third-quarter expectations, making
investors cautious, McKeever said.
<p>
   Aetna is expected to earn $1.31 a share in the quarter,
according to the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   Another decliner is Stamford-based General Re Corp. Shares of
the reinsurance company fell 5 3/4 this week, and 1 1/16 today, to
196 3/4.
<p>
   Shares of Norwalk-based Micro Warehouse Inc., the catalog-based
retailer of computers, software and networking equipment, fell 6
15/16 this week, and 3/16 today, to 20 11/16.
<p>
   Shares of Stamford-based office equipment maker Xerox Corp. rose
most among stocks in the index, gaining 5 1/16 this week, and 2
13/16 today, to 82 1/2.

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Most backyard gardeners just can't wait until a
crop ripens.
<p>
   But Peter and Frances De Santis of Reseda can't wait until
theirs withers on the vine and becomes dry and leathery in the hot
summer sun.
<p>
   While other Valley gardeners are babying along their tomatoes
and zucchini, the De Santises are experimenting this year with
loofahs, squashlike gourds that  &MD;  when dried, seeded and peeled  &MD; 
sell for several dollars apiece in tony bed &MD; and &MD; bath stores as body
scrubbers and skin smoothers.
<p>
   ``They're really easy to grow,'' Frances said, looking over the
massive vine that covers a backyard fence.
<p>
   ``You start with maybe this many seeds,'' she said, holding
perhaps 20 of the flat, black seeds in her hand. ``And you've got
this many loofahs,'' she said, waving her arm toward the
fruit &MD; laden vine.
<p>
   ``You don't really have to work to grow them. Just plop the
seeds in and stand back.''
<p>
   Frances, 70, said she first read about the gourds a year or so
ago in one of the gardening publications she and her husband
subscribe to. Both are members of the San Fernando Iris Society and
other gardening organizations; their garden, which features many
varieties of plants, has been photographed for Sunset magazine.
<p>
   ``I knew there were sponges from the ocean and sponges that you
could grow,'' Frances said. ``I wanted to experiment with them. I
just love to try new things.''
<p>
   She sent off for seeds and planted them, but the plants that
grew weren't anything like the loofah plants in her gardening book.
She tried again and again until she got the right seeds  &MD;  and their
crop took off.
<p>
   ``Thank God, it grows high, not flat,'' Peter said. ``Otherwise
it'd cover the back yard. I need that space for my irises.''
<p>
   An iris hybridizer, Peter, 80, said he agreed to help with the
experiment. And he did the hard work, preparing the soil with a
heavy addition of mulch, planting the seeds, digging an irrigation
trench and training the heavy vines to grow up the fence.
<p>
   It didn't take long until green tendrils began to appear,
followed by bright yellow flowers and cucumber-shaped fruit.
<p>
   ``It was like Jack's beanstalk when it started to grow,''
Frances said.
<p>
   ``And it's continuous growth,'' Peter said. ``There's flowers,
young gourds, mature, ripe ones and drying ones, all on the same
plant.''
<p>
   The Mayans were the first to cultivate loofahs as long as 500
years ago; they used the young fruits for food and medicine and the
dry gourds for scrubbers, fibrous mats and other uses. They've
since been grown in Guatemala and southern Mexico and made into
potholders, doormats, table mats, bathroom rugs, gloves, sandals
and sun helmets.
<p>
   During World War II, the U.S. Navy used loofahs for filters in
steam engines, and the Army used them to wipe down Jeep
windshields; Army surgeons used loofahs as surgical sponges.
<p>
   When it's young, the fruit tastes a bit like a cucumber, with
the flesh surrounded by stringy, fibrous material. While green, the
outside of the fruit feels a bit like a thick-skinned zucchini;
semi-dried to a light chocolate-brown on the vine, it feels like
leather; harvested and dried in the sun, it's hard and brittle.
<p>
   When the gourds are dry, the seeds rattle around inside like
souvenir maracas from Olvera Street.
<p>
   When several of the gourds ripen, the De Santises set up an
assembly line in the back yard to process their experimental crop.
Peter cuts off one end of the gourds and granddaughters Christie
Branch, 8, and her sister, Taylor, 5, shake out the seeds. Then
they soak the dried gourds briefly in a bucket of water. When the
peel is supple, they strip it off, leaving only the light brown
fibrous interior.
<p>
   Peter hangs the wet gourds up to dry on a tree in the back yard,
and Frances bleaches them to a light beige in a solution of laundry
bleach. Then they're cut into chunks large enough for a hand to
grip in the shower.
<p>
   ``Sometimes we have to use tin snips to cut them, they're so
fibrous and tough,'' Frances said.
<p>
   Once bleached and dried, the gourds are put away until December,
when Frances plans to assemble them into personal toiletry baskets,
along with glycerine soap and lace-edged towels, for her friends as
Christmas gifts.
<p>
   Then, the loofah experiment will be over.
<p>
   ``Our woodpile is in there (behind the gourd &MD; covered fence) and
we heat our house with the wood, so we'll have to tear it all down
when it gets cold,'' Frances said.
<p>
   ``I'm going to cut it all down and fix the fence, and I'm going
to grow irises there next year,'' Peter said triumphantly.
<p>
   ``And I'm going to find some more seed and plant something
new,'' Frances countered with a grin.
<p>
   ``Either way,'' he said with a laugh, ``we'll be growing
something.''

<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  For Bobby S. Shackouls, running one of the largest
independent oil and gas companies isn't enough. He wants to be in
the same league as the majors  &MD;  and he's well on his way to
reaching that goal.
<p>
   The company he heads, Houston-based Burlington Resources, is
about to close its $2.5 billion acquisition of Louisiana Land &AMP;
Exploration Co., ranking it third in domestic natural gas reserves
after Chicago-based Amoco Corp. and Exxon Corp. of Irving, Texas.
<p>
   The addition of key deepwater prospects in the Gulf of Mexico
and properties overseas gives Burlington both the mass and the
marketing muscle to make it competitive with independents and major
oil companies.
<p>
   ``We wanted to create what we considered the first super
independent,'' says Shackouls, president and chief executive
officer at Burlington.
<p>
   ``That's a company that has all the assets of a major,'' he
says. ``But on the other hand, we'll be able to operate with the
mindset of an independent.''
<p>
   Independent oil and gas companies, once considered niche players
within the industry and on Wall Street, have finally come into
their own.
<p>
   In the past few years, as these companies have grown, management
has become more sophisticated, and technological advances have
improved business prospects.
<p>
   And while independents have long wrestled with the stereotype of
being self-promoting swindlers and small, unstable candidates for
investment, they are finally shattering that image.
<p>
   Ten years ago, ``You had this J.R. Ewing perception,'' says Mark
Jackson, chief financial officer at Forth Worth, Texas-based Snyder
Oil Corp., of the fictional character in the 1980s television show
``Dallas.'' ``People would look at people in the oil industry as
that type of person unless you were an Exxon.''
<p>
   Today, ``There's a much higher confidence level in the group.
They are more sophisticated, they are global players ... a lot of
the players have good track records, (and) the people that weren't
successful have been merged into stronger companies.''
<p>
   In 1996, for example, domestic exploration spending by the
independents far outpaced that by the major oil companies. Now
their outlays nearly equal that of major companies within the
United States.
<p>
   And this year, many of the independents, which have expanded
overseas and led major companies into international projects, are
stepping up spending abroad.
<p>
   During the past 10 years, the number of independents with more
than $100 million in equity capital has gone from a handful of
public companies to more than 65.
<p>
   Independents are further increasing their size and scope as they
embark on a new round of mergers and acquisitions.
<p>
   In the past five years, the market capitalization of the top 25
largest independent oil and gas companies has more than tripled to
$55.9 billion from $17.4 billion in 1992, according to John S.
Herold, a Stamford, Conn.-based energy research and consulting
firm.
<p>
   Five years ago, only a handful of companies had capital worth
more than $1 billion.
<p>
   Now this recent wave of mergers is ushering in a new group of
``mega independents'' with capital in the $5 billion to $10 billion
range.
<p>
   ``My observation is that there is a new target amongst the
bigger independents,'' says Eric Grubman, co-head of Goldman Sachs
&AMP; Co. energy and power group in New York. ``I don't think the goal
is one to two billion dollars anymore. People are saying this is
the age of the super independent and the goal is five to 10 billion
dollars.
<p>
   ``It's not to get big just to be big,'' he says. ``They feel
that to generate superior returns they need to venture into the
frontier areas ... and in order to do that, they feel like they
need to have bigger balance sheets.''
<p>
   The independent mindset at Burlington and other companies is a
focus on keeping operations lean. It has allowed them to grow
aggressively by profitably operating properties that were sold by
major oil companies, which were losing money on them.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve
policymakers, who just got another reading that U.S. growth is
exceeding their oft-stated speed limit, are unlikely to raise
borrowing costs as long as inflation remains out of sight.
<p>
   Commerce Department figures today showed the economy continues
to cruise. The gross domestic product, the total output of goods
and services, accelerated at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate in
the second quarter -- and many analysts expect that to continue for
the balance of the year.
<p>
   Central bankers meet Tuesday to consider interest rate policy.
With producer prices falling for the first eight months of 1997 and
consumer prices rising at the slowest pace in 11 years, however,
they'd be hard-pressed to justify an increase in the overnight bank
lending rate to slow things down. Inflation gauges tied to the GDP
also remain tame.
<p>
   ``They need a little more political cover,'' such as evidence of
rapidly rising wages, before springing into action, said former Fed
Gov. Lyle Gramley, now a consulting economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
<p>
   Vibrant growth alone isn't enough to force a rate increase
without drawing the wrath of the White House and Congress, Gramley
said, let alone businesses and voters.
<p>
   Second quarter growth, though down from the government's
previous estimate of 3.6 percent and below the first quarter's 4.9
percent, exceeds the 2.5 percent growth rate that Fed policymakers
generally have regarded as the speed limit above which inflation
threatens to accelerate. And in another report today, the
University of Michigan said consumer confidence in the economy
remains high.
<p>
   Even so, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has signaled he's in no
hurry to act to stem growth, saying the U.S. economy is close to
achieving the Fed's goal of price stability, driven by productivity
gains that are understated by official statistics.
<p>
   ``The last 15 years have been a period of consolidating the
gains of the early 1980s and extending them to their logical end --
the achievement of price stability,'' Greenspan said in Palo Alto,
California, Sept. 5. ``We are not quite there yet, but we trust it
is on the horizon.''
<p>
   However, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago and a voting member of the Fed's policymaking Open
Market Committee, later sounded a cautionary note.
<p>
   It may be some time before it's clear the economy has reached
the point where strong growth won't spark accelerating inflation,
Moskow said in Indianapolis Sept. 19. ``Are we entering a new era,
or just experiencing a short-term anomaly?'' he wondered. ``The
answer, of course, is we don't know yet. We probably won't know for
years.''
<p>
   Many analysts see little chance the economy will stray from its
current path.
<p>
   Growth in the third quarter, which ends the day of the Fed's
policy meeting next week, probably reached 3 percent, said Joel
Kent, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the fourth
quarter, growth will likely range between 3 percent and 3.5
percent, said William Sullivan, an economist at Dean Witter
Securities in New York.
<p>
   Investors, meantime, are sanguine at the prospects for steady,
low-inflation growth ahead -- and the Fed staying on the sidelines.
A Bloomberg News survey of the 38 primary government bond dealers
showed they expect no Fed action Tuesday.
<p>
   And, stocks and bonds rose today as investors interpreted the
latest GDP report as a sign of more good times. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2, pushing down its yield almost 4
basis points to 6.37 percent. Stocks gained, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising 74 points, or 0.95 percent, to close at
7922.18.
<p>
   Other analysts contend, though, the inflation picture could
darken, especially if worker shortages stemming from low
unemployment translate into higher labor costs. After all, labor
costs account for two-thirds of consumer prices.
<p>
   Former Fed Gov. Gramley said he expects labor costs to rise and
central bankers to nudge the overnight bank rate a quarter point
higher to 5.75 percent by the end of the year. Added Anthony Chan,
chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors Corp. in Columbus,
Ohio: ``The question should be when -- not whether -- the Fed will
move.''
<p>
   As the economy's nearly seven-year-old expansion continues,
high-tech industries are leading the way. That was highlighted by
yesterday's report showing a stronger-than-expected gain in August
factory orders for durable goods, paced by a record surge in orders
for electronics.
<p>
   Moreover, business investment in durable goods -- such as
computers -- grew during the second quarter at the fastest pace in
almost 14 years.
<p>
   Underscoring that point, analysts said most U.S. computer makers
will probably report higher third quarter earnings, as lower prices
and faster chips trigger increased demand for personal computers
and business systems. This week for example, Dell Computer Corp.'s
chief financial officer, Thomas Meredith, said sales in the
personal computer industry will rise 18 percent to 20 percent for
the next decade.
<p>
   Housing, a leading indicator of the economy's growth, also
remains strong. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors
reported sales of previously owned homes soared in August to the
highest level on record.
<p>
   The Commerce Department issues three estimates of each quarter's
GDP as more information becomes available to its economists. In its
initial estimate, on July 31, the government said the economy grew
at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That was raised
to a 3.6 percent pace last month. The first quarter's 4.9 percent
growth rate was higher than the 4.3 percent rate recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year.
<p>
   Officials attributed the revised second quarter growth estimate
to lower calculations of goods exports, consumer spending on
services and business investment in durable goods. Still, today's
report also continued to show a rapid buildup in business
inventories, which could act to brake demand for some manufactured
goods in the months ahead.
<p>
   Meanwhile, real final sales, which exclude the effects of
inventory changes, rose 2.5 percent in the second quarter,
previously reported as a 2.8 percent increase. After-tax corporate
profits rose 1.7 percent during the second quarter, previously
reported as an increase of 1.2 percent.
<p>
   On the inflation front, the GDP price deflator, a measure of
price increases followed by Wall Street, grew at a 1.8 percent pace
in the second quarter, the smallest rise since a 1.7 percent
increase in the second quarter of 1996. It was previously reported
as an increase of 1.5 percent. The price deflator measures both the
magnitude of price increases and detects whether higher costs drive
consumers away from a product.
<p>
   The price index for gross domestic purchases, which tracks the
price of all goods purchased in the U.S., including imports, grew
at a 0.8 percent rate in the second quarter, unchanged from the
previous reading and the smallest increase since a 0.7 percent rise
in the third quarter of 1961.

   ``They've managed to really profit and really make money on
these properties,'' says Aliza Fan, an oil and gas analyst at John
S. Herold. ``By keeping costs down and working those properties,
they've been able to reinvest their cash-flow into their
business.''
<p>
   At the same time, the exploration and production sector has
become a magnet for capital. Investors are now targeting this group
as a vehicle for growth, Fan says.
<p>
   In addition, the industry has finally come out from under the
pall cast by the shady deals of the '80s. Gone are the aggressively
marketed limited partnership deals where mom-and-pop investors fell
prey to swindlers looking to pump cash into questionable oil and
gas prospects.
<p>
   In 1996, spending on U.S. exploration by independents came close
to equaling domestic exploration spending by the majors, according
to a recent survey by the accounting firm Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The majors accounted for 51 percent of total domestic spending
of $21.6 billion in 1996. Compared to the independents, their share
has declined since 1992 when the majors spent $8.1 billion for 61
percent of the total.
<p>
   ``Most of the independents have their costs under control ...
They can focus more on growth,'' says Victor Burk, managing
director of Arthur Andersen's worldwide energy industry service
group in Houston.
<p>
   The biggest U.S. spenders among the independents in 1996 were
Fort Worth-based Union Pacific, which spent $694 million;
Burlington, whose spending declined to $432 million; and
Houston-based Enron Oil &AMP; Gas, whose spending totaled $384 million.
<p>
   Independents no longer are limiting their operations to the
United States.
<p>
   They plan to increase international spending by 20 percent in
1997, well above the 13 percent increase in 1996, according to a
Salomon Bros. analysis of 1997 worldwide oil and gas exploration
and production spending.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   But as companies get bigger, it is becoming harder to find the
deals big enough to equal their performance in recent years.
<p>
   ``It's going to be very difficult for the large-cap companies to
repeat the kind of performance they've had without having a sizable
exploration side to their business,'' says Snyder's Jackson.
<p>
   The biggest payoff for investors over the next five years is
going to come from small and mid-sized companies where a discovery
of a field holding 100 billion cubic feet of gas, for example, can
have a significant impact, Jackson says.
<p>
   ``There's a lot of opportunities for growth from making the
right acquisition and from exploration,'' he says.
<p>
   Snyder is looking to add key areas for oil and gas production,
either domestically or internationally, and has more than $400
million earmarked for an acquisition.
<p>
   While the independents are experimenting with a new identity as
steady-growth companies, their fortunes remain tied to the prices
of oil and especially natural gas.
<p>
   ``You got to be ready for a pretty volatile, pretty tumultuous
ride in the stock,'' says Wayne Andrews, oil and gas analyst at
Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The British pound tumbled
against the dollar and other major currencies on a report that the
U.K. may join Europe's economic and monetary union after it gets
underway in 1999.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against sterling in two
months after an unidentified cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the British government is more eager to join Europe's single
currency, or euro, than it was several months ago.
<p>
   Sterling climbed 25 percent against the German mark since August
1996, lifted by a booming economy, higher interest rates and
expectations Britain wouldn't join monetary union at the outset.
Now, the U.K. might need to cut interest rates to bring them in
line with rates elsewhere in Europe to enter the union.
<p>
   ``If the markets start to believe U.K. interest rates will come
down to levels seen in Germany and France, sterling will come down
relative to other currencies,'' said Chris Iggo, chief economist at
BZW Securities Inc.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.24 percent versus the dollar, its largest
one-day decline since July 28, to $1.6096 from $1.6299 yesterday.
It also fell to 2.8303 marks from 2.8698 marks, its biggest one-day
drop against the German currency in six weeks.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 121.24 yen from 121.13 yen and
at 1.7590 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.
<p>
   For the week, the dollar fell 0.91 percent against the mark and
0.74 percent against the yen. Still, the dollar gained against both
currencies so far this quarter, up 5.5 percent against the yen and
0.68 percent versus the mark.
<p>
   Traders were undeterred in their flurry to sell pounds, even
after the U.K. Treasury dismissed the report as speculation. A
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said the government's
reserving its option to join monetary union.
<p>
   It's typical of the British government to ``float an idea first
to see how the public reacts,'' said Bob Savage, chief currency
trader at Lehman Brothers. This could have been an ``official
leak.''
<p>
   Economists reckon the pound is likely to join the single
currency at as low as 2.5 marks, Savage said.
<p>
   Still, British officials may not let the pound fall too far,
since an overly weak currency could fan inflation. With interest
rates in the U.K. already high, the government may have little
scope to raise them much further.
<p>
   ``They have a huge dilemma,'' Savage said. ``A quickly falling
pound could lead to disaster, while a rate rise could drive the
economy into recession.''
<p>
   Jesse Torres, chief currency trader at Bank Austria, was among
sterling sellers today.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the yen on concern over
rising trade tension between the U.S. and Japan. The dollar's
strength against the Japanese currency is pushing up the price of
U.S. exports and helping to tilt the balance of trade further in
Japan's favor.
<p>
   U.S. officials repeatedly call on Japan to do more to correct
that imbalance by stimulating domestic demand. Some traders are
concerned that if the U.S. trade gap keeps worsening, U.S.
officials might soften their support for a strong dollar.
<p>
   ``Difficulty with trade issues is growing and could become even
more of a problem,'' said Lehman Brothers' Bob Savage.
<p>
   Just yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Japan's trade surplus is causing concern in Washington,
according to reports. That echoed comments by U.S. Deputy Trade
Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.
<p>
   ``The U.S. administration is on the offensive,'' said Michael
Scarlatos, currency strategist at Bankers Trust New York Corp.
``Witness Barshefsky's language yesterday.''
<p>
   Still, supporting the dollar against the yen was expectation
Japan's economy will stay weak, keeping the country's interest
rates near their all-time lows and souring investors on the yen.
<p>
   Also, since the yen's weakness benefits the economy by making
exports cheaper, Japanese officials may not mind too much if it
falls further.
<p>
   ``The economy is moribund, in terrible shape,'' said Savage.
``An export-led recovery seems to be the only way out.''
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the mark, recouping
earlier losses after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing
suggested he's satisfied with the dollar's level versus the mark.
<p>
   Concern that the German currency may be too weak ``hasn't
disappeared but it's not as strong,'' Issing said.
<p>
   Analysts consider Issing one of the Bundesbank's staunchest
inflation foes. The mark's weakness against the dollar raises
import prices and can fan inflation pressures, though traders took
his comments as a sign he doesn't think the currency's too weak.
<p>
   ``Issing's a right-winger, always vigilant on inflation,''
Scarlatos said. ``Now he's making comments that are somewhat
dovish.'' That's prompting traders to buy dollars, he said.
<p>
   The dollar fell against the mark in European trading after
comments by Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept
alive expectations that the central bank was poised to raise its
benchmark interest rate. Higher rates would boost the mark by
making some assets denominated in it more alluring.
<p>
   Gaddum said the market is right to expect higher money market
rates in the run-up to monetary union.
<p>
   Boosting confidence in the mark is a growing sense that
``Germany is recovering and that recovery is happening at a much
faster rate than previously forecast,'' said Lehman Brothers'
Scarlatos.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 1.4510 Swiss francs from 1.4503
francs yesterday, and at 5.9055 French francs from 5.9165 francs.
The dollar was unchanged at 1719 Italian lire. Canada's dollar was
little changed at 72.24 U.S. cents from 72.29 cents.

   Bellevue, Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Next Software Inc.
sells ``Nextstep'' software and NextLevel Systems Inc. provides
network systems and NextLink Communications Inc. is building a
wireless telephone network.
<p>
   What's next?
<p>
   At least 11 companies sport the name Next in some form, the most
recent being Bellevue, Washington-based Nextlink, which went public
today. ``Next'' conveys a sense of forward thinking, dynamism and
progress into -- well, the next century, public relations
consultants said.
<p>
   ``(It) means you're trying to figure out the coming landscape
for your clients,'' said Faith Popcorn of Brain Reserve, a New York
company that advises companies on future trends.
<p>
   The popularity of Next also suggests companies are confident
that subliminal message will translate into profits, consultants
said. ``There's a lot less economics that makes stocks go up and
down and a lot more emotions,'' said David Allman, a technical
analyst with Elliott Wave International. ``Sex sells.''
<p>
   To be sure, not every company has millennium fever. Boole &AMP;
Babbage Inc. is a San Jose-based software maker that was named
after George Boole and Charles Babbage, 19th century mathematicians
who influenced computer development.
<p>
   On the other hand, there's Next Media Group, Nextel
Communications Inc., Nextron Corp. and NextWave Telecom Inc.
<p>
   And of course NextHealth Inc. Its stock ticker? NEXT.

<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Actress Jane Fonda, warning that an emphasis on
sexual abstinence could reverse a decline in the nation's teen
birth rate, said Friday that schools also need to teach students
about condoms and other contraceptives.
<p>
   Fonda said the new welfare reform law, which institutionalizes
abstinence-only sex education in schools, will deny some students
information on contraceptives.
<p>
   ``We have to be realistic in order to protect our kids,'' said
Fonda, a volunteer for Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention. ``There's a way to talk to children about relationships
and sexuality that is appropriate to their level of development.''
<p>
   ``Abstinence must always be the first message, but include with
that the information'' on birth control, she said.
<p>
   Fonda and James Wagoner, executive director of the international
group Advocates for Youth, appeared at a news conference to launch
a month-long ``Let's Talk'' campaign urging parents to talk to
their children frankly about issues important to their age group.
<p>
   Fonda, who next week becomes a national spokeswoman for Durex,
an Atlanta company that is the world's largest condom manufacturer,
said part of her role would be to ask parents to learn about what
their children's schools are teaching and to alert the public about
``huge amounts'' of federal money going to support abstinence-only
education.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Wagoner, whose organization works to increase the opportunities
for youth to make healthy decisions about sexuality, said that
``the biggest threat that we face today in adolescent reproductive
health ... is political.''
<p>
   Saying that 75 percent of teenagers have had sex by the age of
18 and that 98 percent of Americans support sexual education in
schools, Wagoner claimed ``there's not a single, credible
peer-reviewed study that shows that abstinence-only works''
toprevent teen preegnancy.
<p>
   On the contrary, he said, extensive studies by the World Health
Organization show that programs promoting both postponement and
protected sex were more effective than abstinence-only programs.
<p>
   Wagoner urged the Clinton administration to protect reproductive
health services for teen schools and condom availability programs.
<p>
   Instead, of Congress ``hijacking'' adolescent reproductive
health policy and leading the public ``down the road of denial,''
Wagoner said, ``the political leadership needs to step up to the
plate and take advantage of the potential golden opportunity for
progress in the area.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds rose, rounding out
a third week of gains, after the government said economic growth in
the second quarter was slower than previously reported while
inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   ``The GDP results are positive for the bond market; it makes it
look like growth isn't that strong,'' said Ken Anderson, who
oversees $7 billion at Evergreen Asset Management Corp., in
Purchase, New York. Robust growth can fuel inflation, which eats
away at the value of bonds' fixed payments.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds rose 14/32 point, or $4.38 per
$1,000 bond, to 100 2/32, pushing the yield down 3 basis points to
6.37 percent. The two-year note yield fell 4 basis points to 5.78
percent.
<p>
   Bonds are poised for a third straight quarter of gains,
according to an index of bonds maturing in more than one year
compiled by Bloomberg Analytics. With two trading days of the third
quarter remaining, Treasuries have paid investors about 3.2
percent, the fourth-best performing market in the world.
<p>
   The Commerce Department put its final estimate of second-quarter
growth at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, down from its previous
estimate of 3.6 percent. The price deflator, a measure of
inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the quarter, the
smallest rise since the second quarter of last year.
<p>
   Analysts had forecast a 1.5 percent rise in the deflator, which
measures both the magnitude of price increases and detects whether
higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
<p>
   ``Inflation is at such an extraordinary level that the slightly
higher revision isn't a problem,'' said Susan Hering, chief
economist at Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   Bonds got a further boost when the Federal Reserve bought $1.655
billion of Treasury securities maturing in two- to five years to
add money permanently to the banking system. The so-called coupon
pass doesn't signal any change in interest-rate policy, economists
said.
<p>
   To be sure, some investors fret that inflation may eventually
pick up unless the economy slows. Bonds yesterday posted their
biggest drop in almost eight weeks after reports on durable goods
orders, home sales and jobless claims showed strength, keeping
alive concern the Fed might raise bank lending rates for a second
time this year to ward off inflation.
<p>
   ``The Fed should be clear that this level of above-potential
growth is not sustainable,'' said Elizabeth Miller, who helps
manage about $500 million of bonds at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP;
Jacobsen Inc.
<p>
   ``I feel the Fed will eventually have to step in'' and raise
borrowing rates at least once more, Miller said. She's waiting for
yields on longer-term bonds to rise before buying.
<p>
   With inflation quiescent there's little expectation that a Fed
move, if it comes at all, will occur at its policy meeting Tuesday.
The central bankers last increased the target for the overnight
lending rate between banks on March 25, by a quarter point to 5.5
percent.
<p>
   ``We're still fairly positive on the outlook for the bond market
in the U.S.'' because of the prospects for slow inflation, said Rod
Davidson, who helps oversee $1 billion of fixed-income securities
at Murray Johnstone in Glasgow, Scotland.
<p>
   The government last week said that consumer prices rose at a 1.6
percent annual pace in the first eight months of the year, the
slowest since 1986.
<p>
   Now traders are turning their attention to next week, when
reports on consumer confidence, manufacturing and jobs will provide
more clues to the economy's strength.
<p>
   Friday the Labor Department will release a report on employment
and wages for September. The report is likely to show the economy
added 336,000 non-farm jobs, up from 49,000 in August, according to
the average forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
jobless rate will probably drop 0.1 percentage point to match the
23-year low of 4.8 percent seen in May and July.
<p>
   ``My gut feeling is that the reports -- manufacturing and jobs
figures in particular -- are going to be good news for the economy,
and that's not such good news for bonds,'' lest it points to
accelerating inflation, said Donald Ross, who helps oversee $11
billion in assets at National City Asset Management in Cleveland.
<p>
   Ross said he sold 30-year bonds today and invested in 10-year
bonds instead, betting the market has priced in so much good
inflation news already that further gains may be limited.
<p>
   ``I still see a flattening bias'' for the yield curve, he said.
``But I don't think we can break out of that 6.25 percent to 6.75
percent range on the 30-year bond yet.''
<p>
   To be sure, optimism about the prospects for slow inflation has
been reflected in the slim yield premium that investors are willing
to accept for 30-year bonds, compared with two-year notes. The
difference, or yield spread, is 59 basis points. It reached a more
than 2 1/2-year low on Wednesday.
<p>
   ``It's just the best of all possible worlds -- the way the
American economy is running, our long-bond yields are way too
high,'' said Tom Carpenter, who manages some $6 billion in assets
at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C.
<p>
   Carpenter, who has bought long-dated Treasuries betting yields
will head lower, said the yield curve will flatten more as the
low-inflation story drives down 30-year bond yields.
<p>
   A narrow difference between short- and long-term rates could
also spur more mortgage investors to pile into Treasuries, driving
yields lower. That's because a flatter yield curve cuts the profits
for Wall Street firms who buy longer-term mortgage securities and
repackage them into shorter-term collateralized mortgage
obligations.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications Inc. and FelCor Suites LP. led seven
companies that raised a combined $1.7 billion today in the
corporate bond market.
<p>
   Some $38.6 billion of corporate bonds have been sold so far this
month, with $27.5 billion of that in investment-grade corporate
bonds, according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, New Jersey.
<p>
   Corporate bonds have weathered the influx of supply because the
economy continues to show strength without inflation, leading to
optimism that companies will be able to repay their debts. Even
though ``we're seeing a little earnings weakness,'' it's not
widespread enough to affect corporate credit quality, said Kevin
McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income at Dreyfus Corp.
<p>
   The spread, or the gap in yield between corporate bonds and
Treasuries, was unchanged today, said traders.
<p>
   At today's yield of 6.08 percent, U.S. 10-year notes yield 395
basis points more than the 2.13 percent yield on the No. 195
10-year Japanese bond. That's 1 basis point more than a week ago.
<p>
   U.S. debt now yields 55 basis points more than the 5.53 percent
yield on 10-year German bonds, unchanged from last week.
<p>
   About $66.8 billion in Treasuries traded through most of the
major bond brokers as of 3 p.m. U.S. Eastern time, according to
GovPX, Inc., a bond pricing service. Volume was about 8 percent
above average for a Friday in the third quarter of 1996, GovPX
said.
<p>
   The so-called basis, which reflects the difference between the
current 30-year bond and the March futures contract adjusted for a
conversion factor, was 3/32 higher at 178/32, or 5 9/16 points.
<p>
   The three-month bill's discount rate was 7 basis points higher
at 4.86 percent, a bond-equivalent yield of 4.98 percent. The
six-month bill's discount rate rose 1 basis point to 4.97 percent,
a bond-equivalent yield of 5.16 percent. The one-year bill's
discount rate fell 2 basis points to 5.18 percent, a
bond-equivalent yield of 5.45 percent.
<p>
   The three-year note rose 3/32 to 100 11/32, a yield of 5.86
percent. The five-year note rose 6/32 to 99 17/32, a yield of 5.98
percent.

 &UR; DYLEX MAY RAISE ITS C$100 MLN BID FOR MARK'S, ANALYSTS SAY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dylex Ltd. has asked Canadian
retail industry analysts for their latest profit forecasts for
Mark's Work Wearhouse Ltd. in preparation of a higher bid for the
company, analysts said.
<p>
   Toronto-based Dylex, which owns 640 clothing stores under names
such as Tip Top and Fairweather, made a C$100 million (US$72
million) cash-and-share bid for Mark's on Aug. 28. The
Calgary-based company's stock has since traded at a substantial
premium to the offer in anticipation of a higher bid.
<p>
   Dylex management today called analysts who cover both companies
asking for updated profit forecasts on Mark's and Dylex, a step
analysts said is in preparation of a sweetened bid.
<p>
   ``These guys are smart. They want to know exactly where the
street is at,'' said Jim Durran, analyst with Marleau, Lemire
Securities Inc. of Toronto. ``You may see something happen early in
the week.''
<p>
   If Dylex is going to convince the handful of institutional
investors that control most of Mark's to sell their shares the
offer will have to increase, analysts and shareholders said.
<p>
   ``It was not done in preparation of raising our bid,'' said
Dylex spokesman Michael Sherman, who acknowledged that the company
has never before called to ask for forecasts of rival retailers.
``The numbers that we have do nothing but support our bid as being
fair and reasonable.''
<p>
   Mark's, which operates 290 work and casual wear stores under the
Mark's and Work World banners, has told investors it will generate
higher revenue and profits over the next few years.
<p>
   ``I don't think they have got a very enthusiastic response to
their bid,'' said William Chisholm, analyst with Deacon Capital
Corp. of Toronto.
<p>
   Dylex is offering C$1.65 a share and a quarter share for a total
of C$3.88 a share, a 7.6 percent discount to Mark's shares at
today's share prices. The bid expires Oct. 15. Mark's shares closed
unchanged at C$4.20 in Toronto while Dylex fell C$0.15 to C$8.80.

<p>
   Dave Moss had just received a promotion and a 19 percent
increase in salary when he quit his banking career at age 35.
Instead, Moss, who had been working as a commercial loan officer,
began pursuing a 15-year dream: becoming a teacher.
<p>
   He had three teen-age children at the time, and he needed 18
months to obtain his teacher's certificate. The switch also meant a
60 percent cut in pay, to a starting salary of $18,500. But five
years later, he doesn't regret it.
<p>
   ``I'll never make the money in education that I probably could
have made as a banker,'' said Moss, who lives in Sandy, Utah, and
teaches the fourth grade. ``But after I found something that I
really enjoyed doing, our family realized, amazingly, that we
didn't miss the money.''
<p>
   Career switching isn't new to the teaching business. But it has
become more popular lately, amid growing concerns over teacher
shortages in some areas. And teachers' pay is starting to keep pace
with inflation.
<p>
   Today, a typical career switcher into teaching has been out of
college for 8 to 10 years. But more of these new teachers are men,
and more are people in their late 50s or their 60s. And while new
teachers still tend to come directly out of college, the number of
career switchers has probably doubled in the last 15 years, to
perhaps 50,000, education experts said.
<p>
   People who want to make the jump can choose among 300 programs
nationwide, half of them created since 1990. The largest is the
Troops to Teachers program, for military personnel; it has produced
2,300 new teachers since 1994. There are also programs for
physicists, retired engineers, returning Peace Corps volunteers and
``para-educators'' like teacher's aides.
<p>
   Some people are still enrolling in alternative certification
programs that take just a few weeks; school districts started
offering more of these programs in the early 1990s to deal with
teacher shortages. But about three-quarters of the career
switchers, education experts say, are turning to programs that are
usually considerably longer and often exhaustingly intense, but
that steep students in teaching theory, child-development courses
and classroom experience.
<p>
   Educators applaud the interest. They say many school districts
prefer career switchers as teachers, and for several reasons: They
tend to bring more maturity, self-confidence and self-discipline to
the job, and they are less likely to leave the profession.
<p>
   Still, educators caution, a classroom perch isn't for everyone.
Those who are happiest with the change, they say, have usually made
a realistic assessment of their skills and have some experience
working with children or schools.
<p>
   ``People often think that just because they're good at working
with people that they're right for this,'' said Professor Michael
Andrew, director of teacher education at the University of New
Hampshire. ``But they often underestimate the emotional and mental
stress of the job, and often they don't have the abilities to
relate effectively with today's multicultural, pluralistic
classroom.''
<p>
   Moss said: ``If large purchases, money and titles are important
to you, teaching is not the way to go. People who are stuck in a
9-to-5 habit or who look at it as just a job shouldn't consider it
too strongly, either. In my case, I'm working with 26 different
personalities during the day, and I have to take the time to deal
with each personality individually.''
<p>
   For David A. Krane, an elementary-school teacher in Lexington,
Mass., the decision to switch careers also took a big bite out of
his family's income.
<p>
   Krane, 43, had worked as a carpenter and building contractor for
almost 20 years before September 1996, when he became a full-time
student in an intensive yearlong teacher training course at the
Shady Hill School in Cambridge, Mass. He had run a successful
business, but found himself ``running from job to job, doing more
management and less hands-on building.''
<p>
   Luckily, Krane's wife was able to increase her earnings, to help
offset the loss of income. But Krane, who has two daughters, 5 and
8, still had to borrow almost $8,000, as well as tap into his
savings, to the tune of a few thousand dollars a month. ``It began
to get quite dicey toward the end,'' he said.
<p>
   Financial sacrifices are not new to Pablo Millares, either.
Millares, 35, is a former American Express bill collector who is
now happily teaching kindergarten in North Miami Beach, Fla.
<p>
   But to reach his goal, Millares had to obtain an $8,000
education loan and spend three years going to school on Saturdays
and in the evenings. Even after he finished his courses, he still
had to take a leave of absence from his collection job to finish a
nine-month internship.

<p>
   Now, rather than spending his entire day on the phone, Millares
teaches up to 44 kindergarteners at a time.
<p>
   ``The biggest change I had was suddenly becoming my own boss,''
he said. ``I was the one running the factory, so to speak, and to
these kids, I was a friend, a psychiatrist and Mom and Dad all
rolled into one.
<p>
   ``I didn't have gray hair when I started teaching,'' he added.
<p>
   Millares was lucky in finding a job: Just three weeks into his
internship, he was hired by the school where he was working. But
Krane had a tougher task. While interviewing for a job in a
multi-age classroom  &MD;  a teaching approach that mixes students of
slightly different ages  &MD;  he discovered that there were 350 to 500
applicants for each job.
<p>
   After sending out more than 100 letters, Krane eventually landed
a job, teaching in a multi-age class of first and second graders.
But many of his friends, he said, had to work out of state, because
so many universities in the Boston area churn out new teachers
annually.
<p>
   Education experts advise career switchers to assess training
programs carefully.
<p>
   David Haselkorn, the president of Recruiting New Teachers, a
nonprofit group in Belmont, Mass., said that more than 40 states
offer alternative certification programs intended to license
teaching candidates who already held bachelor's degrees and who had
expertise in a particular subject.
<p>
   But, he added, these programs vary widely. Some require just
nine additional hours of graduate course work, while others require
obtaining a master's degree and extensive field work.
<p>
   ``Some of these programs are just emergency programs with fig
leaves,'' he said.
<p>
   Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor at Teachers College at
Columbia University, agreed.
<p>
   ``We've found that the programs that are the most successful are
those that are usually launched by universities and that have
created strong partnerships with local schools,'' she said. ``These
programs combine intensive course work in learning theory, child
cognition and development with internships with master teachers at
local schools.''
<p>
   She added: ``The programs that fail are the four- to six-week
summer programs, where there's just enough time for orientation and
learning tricks of the trade. With these programs, students often
obtain very little knowledge of how kids develop, and they also get
no special-education training, even though classrooms now average
two students with learning disabilities apiece. As a result,
students usually run out of teaching tools by the second week of
school.''
<p>
   Professor Darling-Hammond said career switchers who completed
longer, more intense certification programs were about three times
as likely to stay in teaching as new college graduates. But career
switchers who chose the quick programs had a higher dropout rate;
20 percent to 50 percent leave after the first year. By contrast,
career switchers who train well have an attrition rate of about 5
percent.
<p>
   ``School districts think they're saving money with these
programs, but a lot of them are penny wise and pound foolish,''
Professor Darling-Hammond said.
<p>
   Still, for many switchers, training well can be taxing. At the
teaching training program at the University of New Hampshire,
students first endure a wilderness week in the White Mountains
that, like many Outward Bound programs, helps them adapt
problem-solving methods to the classroom.
<p>
   After that, the students are required to run a five-week-long
summer school for elementary and secondary students, and completes
a yearlong internship.
<p>
   ``This is basically a full-time commitment,'' Andrew said.
``Most mid-career people have saved up to do this.''

   San Jose, California, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Adobe Systems Inc.
Chief Operating Officer David Pratt resigned and President Charles
Geschke was named co-chairman, in a management reorganization to
help its efforts in getting big corporate accounts for desktop
publishing software.
<p>
   Pratt, a nine-year Adobe veteran and executive vice president,
is leaving Nov. 30 after Adobe eliminated the chief operating
officer position. Chairman and Chief Executive John Warnock, who
founded Adobe with Geschke in 1982, will share a new office of the
chairman with him.
<p>
   Adobe said the moves were part of broader management changes, as
the maker of PageMaker and other desktop publishing and Internet
programs targets big companies. Much of its business has been with
individual users and small businesses such as design shops.
<p>
   ``They need to expand more broadly into the corporate market,''
said BT-Alex Brown analyst Mary McCaffrey.
<p>
   Adobe said it has already seen growth for its products within
companies, which are using more graphics software and products for
exchanging documents within networks.
<p>
   Warnock will continue as chief executive and head Adobe's
product, strategy and technology operations. Geschke will assume
expanded roles in running Adobe's marketing, selling and
operations. He retains his title of president.
<p>
   ``The role of COO was one we saw as not appropriate for the way
we wanted to look at realigning for the year ahead,'' said Wink
Grelif, an Adobe spokeswoman.
<p>
   The management changes come a week after Adobe reported
better-than-expected third-quarter profit. The company, which
traditionally has sold products for Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintosh, has broken into the Microsoft Corp. Windows market. The
third-quarter earnings were driven by strong sales of its desktop
publishing software for both Windows and Macintosh.
<p>
   Adobe shares fell 15/16 to 49 7/8. They have risen 35 percent
this year.

60.5 pence to 242.5 pence, or about $3.90 a share, indicating
investors expect Federal-Mogul will have to raise its bid.
Southfield, Michigan-based Federal-Mogul, the world's largest maker
of bearings and bushings, gains access to T&AMP;N's line of other
engine parts through the acquisition. It's the latest of several
consolidations driven by automakers, who want to cut their own
assembly costs by forcing suppliers to build whole systems, not
just individual parts.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, a Salomon Brothers analyst. ``In one fell swoop they could
accomplish a lot in terms of getting toward their goal.''
Federal-Mogul shares rose 3 3/4 to close at 37 1/4, spurred by
investors who believe the purchase will improve earnings
immediately, said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In addition, Federal-Mogul's increased size is
expected to help it maintain margins, which are being squeezed by
automakers, analysts said. The purchase of T&AMP;N, which had $3.0
billion in revenue in 1996, is ``a great fit for us,''
Federal-Mogul spokeswoman Kimberly Welch said. Federal-Mogul's 1996
revenue was $2.03 billion.
<p>
   In one example of how the partsmaker could deliver a more
complete system, Welch said Federal-Mogul's own bearings could be
used in engines that also use T&AMP;N's pistons and cam shafts. The
move also expands the Michigan company's global reach. Welch
wouldn't comment on whether Federal-Mogul will end up raising its
bid because of the increase in T&AMP;N's share price. Federal-Mogul
began restructuring shortly after Richard Snell became its chief
executive in November 1996, selling its retail operations to focus
on manufacturing. The company took a $204 million charge in the
fourth quarter to pay for the restructuring, which is about
two-thirds complete. Snell has indicated he wants Federal-Mogul to
be a $10 billion company, analyst Needham said. ``This acquisition
brings them half way there,'' she said.
<p>
   Yet this acquisition, as well as any future ones, may hurt
Federal-Mogul's credit quality, said Sean Egan, managing director
of Egan-Jones Rating Co.
<p>
   ``This acquisition is huge, relative to Federal-Mogul's total
assets of $1.4 billion,'' Egan said. ``This acquisition alone is
big enough to damage its credit quality.'' Federal-Mogul won't be
slowed in its plan to continue growing through acquisitions, Welch
said.
<p>
   Federal Mogul's 1996 profit from continuing operations fell 15
percent to $34.7 million, or 74 cents a share, from $40.8 million,
or 92 cents, in 1995.
<p>
   After charges in both years, it had a final loss of $211
million, or $6.26 a share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or
53 cents, in 1995.
<p>
   Federal-Mogul is expected to earn 35 cents a share in the third
quarter, based on the average of six analysts surveyed by IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   Neither the company nor analysts could immediately determine how
much the acquisition would improve earnings.
<p>
   T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of asbestos, has been
vulnerable to a bid since it took a $596.8 million charge last year
to insulate it against future liability from asbestos litigation,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around $4.19 a share, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto-parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period.
<p>
   T&AMP;N said it is considering the bid with its adviser, N M
Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Whitecourt Newsprint Company
Equity Trust said it filed with regulators in all Canadian
provinces for an initial public offering of trust units.
<p>
   The units will be offered at C$20 (US$14.40). The number of
units sold will be determined when a final prospectus is filed, the
trust said.
<p>
   The money raised will be used to buy units in the Whitecourt
Newsprint Company Limited Partnership (WNC), which will give the
trust a 25 percent stake in Alberta Newsprint Co., a joint venture
formed in 1989 between WNC and West Fraser Timber Co. The venture's
newsprint mill has annual capacity of about 250,000 metric tons and
is one of the lowest cost producers of newsprint in North America.
<p>
   The IPO is scheduled to close in early November.
<p>
   Trust officials couldn't be reached for comment.
<p>
   West Fraser shares rose C$0.25 to C$47 in Toronto.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil surged to a
four-month high after the bombing of a Colombian pipeline raised
concern that exports to the U.S. could be disrupted at a time of
low inventories.
<p>
   Elsewhere, wheat slid as Australia sold grain to Pakistan. Cocoa
also dropped. The Commodity Research Bureau index fell 0.27, or 0.1
percent, to 242.72, while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index rose 0.74, or 0.4 percent, to 203.80.
<p>
   The bombing was the 51st this year and came just two days after
state oil company Ecopetrol repaired the line from the previous
attack. The attacks are coming with U.S. crude oil inventories
lagging year-ago levels by 2.7 percent, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Colombia is the ninth-largest oil exporter to
the U.S.
<p>
   Prices rose in early trading as investors who follow charts for
technical evidence of market direction took four consecutive days
of gains as a signal to buy futures contracts.
<p>
   ``The pipeline news has added to today's gains,'' said Steve
Bellino, a senior trader at ABN Amro Chicago Corp. in New York.
<p>
   Crude oil for November delivery rose 48 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $20.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
for a contract closest to expiration since June 2. Crude prices
gained 7.9 percent this week.
<p>
   The jump in crude pulled heating oil higher. October heating oil
rose 1.41 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 57.92 cents a gallon. Heating
oil prices have risen in recent days as forecasts for cooler
weather in the U.S. Northeast prompted speculators and oil
marketers to buy contracts.
<p>
   Still, many oil traders expressed surprise at today's rise,
since distillate supplies, which include home heating oil, are 20
percent above year-ago levels, according to the API.
<p>
   ``Fundamentally there's no reason to see heating oil higher,
there's so much oil that people are running out of storage
facilities,'' said Abe Glass, a trader at Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg in
New York.
<p>
   Wheat dropped to a two-month low after Pakistan bought twice as
much wheat from Australia as from the U.S., signaling rising
competition on the world market.
<p>
   Pakistan purchased 400,000 metric tons of Australian wheat and
only 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat in a tender yesterday,
according to a U.S.-based official of the Australian Wheat Board.
Speculation also swept the market that Egypt, one of the world's
largest buyers, could soon buy wheat from France, traders said.
<p>
   Competition is increasing on the world wheat market as the
European Union, collectively the world's largest exporter,
completed its harvest. Also, recent rains have revived the wheat
crop in Australia, the world's fourth-largest exporter.
<p>
   ``The main reason for the weakness in the market is the Pakistan
tender,'' said Paul Koltek, a wheat trader at United Grain Corp., a
Portland, Oregon-based wheat exporting firm. ``The trade in general
anticipated there would be a lot more done from the U.S.''
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$3.5725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the contract's
lowest since July 21.
<p>
   Cocoa prices fell amid speculation that crops in West Africa, in
the early stages of harvest, suffered less damaged than expected
from dry weather.
<p>
   Last year, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower,
produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa. Estimates for this
year's harvest are as low as 850,000 tons on expectations that
unusually dry weather damaged the crop.
<p>
   Now, recent rains are leading traders to revise their forecasts.
Since the bulk of harvesting won't take place until November, the
moisture will have time to reinvigorate the crop.
<p>
   Better-than-expected weather ``may mean that less of the crop
was damaged and (it) should come in close to about 1 million
tons,'' said Walter Spilka, a commodity analyst at Smith Barney
Inc. in New York.
<p>
   Cocoa for December delivery fell $35, or 2.1 percent, to $1,668
a metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.
<p>
   In other growing regions, including Indonesia, weather
conditions remain dry, increasing the likelihood that global cocoa
harvests will be low.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The Gray Panthers, mired in the doldrums since
the death of its fiesty founder two years ago, hopes to mount a
comeback this weekend at the organization's biennial convention.
<p>
   The Gray Panthers, founded in 1970 in Philadelphia by Maggie
Kuhn, has seen its membership decline from a high of 80,000 to
40,000 since Kuhn's death at age 89 in 1995.
<p>
   ``We haven't paid enough attention to recruitment,'' Catherine
DeLorey, the Panthers' newly elected national board chairwoman,
said earlier this week. She said she hoped this weekend's
convention  &MD;  called ``Bridging Generations for a New Social
Contract''  &MD;  re-energizes the organization.
<p>
   Kuhn, a charismatic, independent, high-energy woman, founded the
Gray Panthers just months after being forced to retire at age 65
from her job with the United Presbyterian Church.
<p>
   She described the organization as an advocate for ``fundamental
social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and
oppression in our present society.''
<p>
   Kuhn didn't pick the name the Gray Panthers  &MD;  others did. She
originally called it ``The Consultation of Older and Younger Adults
for Social Change.'' But a Philadelphia reporter dubbed the group
the Gray Panthers and the name stuck.
<p>
   Hardly anything irritates the Panthers more than to be labeled a
bunch of senior citizens  &MD;  a term Kuhn detested.
<p>
   ``This is not an old person's organization,'' said DeLorey, 55,
who is president of the Women's Health Institute, a college
professor and co-founder and director of a women-owned health
center. ``It's always had youth and age together.''
<p>
   ``We're for unity  &MD;  especially intergenerational unity,'' said
Karen Talbot of San Francisco, who helped with the convention.
``We're against ageism and all the things that divide us.''
<p>
   The Panthers were at the forefront of the anti-Vietnam war
movement and have remained in the activist vanguard ever since,
both in Washington and in state capitals.
<p>
   In recent years, the San Francisco chapter has picketed for the
unionization of home health care nurses; campaigned in favor of
affirmative action and against toxics; and it blew the whistle on
book dumping by the new San Francisco Main Library as it underwent
high-tech conversion.
<p>
   ``We're multi-issue oriented,'' Talbot said. ``We see the
connections between things  &MD;  between health care and workers
rights, with diverting some of the military budget to pay for
health care. We deal with interconnection and we work in coalition.
This is our main strength.''

   Sunnyvale, California, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Trimble
Navigation Ltd. shares fell 6.6 percent after the company said
testing delays of its satellite-based location devices will cause
third-quarter earnings to be about half of expectations.
<p>
   The shares of Sunnyvale, California-based Trimble fell 1 3/8 to
19 1/2 in trading of 1.1 million, more than nine times the
three-month daily average of 116,000. Earlier, they dropped to 17
1/8.
<p>
   Trimble makes Global Positioning System, or GPS, receivers that
use satellites to help airplane pilots, ship captains and truckers
precisely locate their positions. Testing delays of its Cargo
Utility GPS Receivers generated by military procurement procedures
will likely postpone shipment of the $5 million order into the
fourth quarter, the company said.
<p>
   ``It does appear as though this is a genuine delay only,'' said
Red Chip Review analyst John Raaf. ``My belief is that the annual
results will be the same.''
<p>
   Raaf expects Trimble to earn 62 cents a share in 1997.
<p>
   Trimble Chief Financial Officer Dennis Ing said that the delayed
shipment to the U.S. Army and Air Force will reduce third-quarter
per-share earnings by 8 cents to 10 cents. All of the earnings
deficit should be made up in the fourth quarter, he added, though
Trimble won't know for sure until later this fall when the military
testing is complete.
<p>
   Trimble was expected to earn 17 cents a share in the September
quarter, Raaf said.

   Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Armstrong World
Industries Inc. said it launched legal action in an Ontario court
to prevent the purchase of Domco Inc. by Germany's Tarkett AG.
<p>
   Armstrong's motion will be heard by the Ontario Court (General
Division) on Oct. 29. The legal action relates to a lawsuit filed
in June against Sommer Allibert SA, which owns 69.2 percent of
Montreal-based Domco, for breach of fiduciary and other duties to
Domco's minority shareholders.
<p>
   Paris-based Sommer agreed in May to sell its worldwide
floor-covering business to Tarkett for 955 million deutsche marks
(US$565 million) in cash and debt. A month later, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania-based Armstrong bid C$488 million, or C$23 a share,
for Domco to strengthen its North American floor-covering business
and stop Tarkett from gaining a foothold in the U.S. and Canadian
markets.
<p>
   Armstrong shares rose 5/8 to 66 5/8 in New York. Domco shares
closed unchanged at C$16.75 in Montreal.

   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The Dunn cabernet is flowing, the antelope is to
die for, Willie Nelson is about to take the stage and, all in all,
the 1,900 attendees of the 27th Montgomery Securities annual
investment conference here are in a darn good mood.
<p>
   ``Hey, it's a bull market for growth stocks,'' said Gary
DiSilvestri, a money manager from Stamford, Conn., as he practiced
lassoing a cowgirl named Theresa Ogas, imported for the occasion
from the Riata Ranch in Exeter, Calif.
<p>
   DiSilvestri was correct: Montgomery's growth stock index is up
47 percent since it bottomed out in April. At last year's
conference, which followed a summer decline, money managers were
slapping one another on the back with far less frequency at the
quote machines, several in attendance recalled.
<p>
   And after a six-month recovery, winter brought another down
cycle in the technology, health care, media and financial services
stocks in which Montgomery specializes.
<p>
   This led some people to feel a trifle uneasy about the
celebratory abandon that marked Montgomery's weeklong event.
<p>
   ``It must be what it felt like in 1929,'' said the president of
a global asset management firm based in New York, who declined to
give his name. ``You have to wonder how many future cab drivers are
in the room. It's crazy, it's very lavish  &MD;  but it's part of the
game.''
<p>
   Montgomery's conferences, aimed at luring fund managers from the
East Coast and keeping them away from Bay Area competitors while
they're here, are notorious for unabashed excess.
<p>
   But repeat visitors deemed this year's event the most
over-the-top to date. Monday night's Western-theme social was
followed on Tuesday by a Mardi Gras party complete with deep-fried
alligator, the Neville Brothers and fortune tellers.
<p>
   Dana Carvey, the comic of ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Wayne's
World'' fame, was the headliner on Thursday night.
<p>
   Not forgotten were spouses (read: wives, as the crowd was 90
percent men in suits and ties). Their daytime activities included a
wine tour of the Napa Valley and lunch at the home of Thomas W.
Weisel, Montgomery's chairman, with a guided tour of his art
collection led by the chief curator of the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art.
<p>
   But then, the company has cause for a little extra extravagance
this year, even beyond the revival of growth stocks. Hugh L. McColl
Jr., the Monday keynote speaker and the chief executive of
Nationsbank, just paid $1.2 billion to acquire Montgomery  &MD;  a
premium far greater than that paid by other commercial banks in
recent deals to acquire investment banks.
<p>
   Montgomery's 68 partners are expected to collect an average of
$17.6 million each.
<p>
   Weisel brushes off comparisons to the legendary improvidence of
Michael R. Milken's so-called predators' balls, noting that the
optimistic forecast for growth stocks has its roots in an
unvarnished economic analysis that is a far cry from junk bonds.
<p>
   For one thing, despite their recent ascent, the stocks in
Montgomery's index of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the
United States are selling at an average of 87 percent of their
expected 1998 earnings growth rate. By contrast, those in the S&AMP;P
500 are at 190 percent of expected growth rates.

<p>
   Moreover, ``accelerated earnings growth and global wage
deflation are going to continue to drive stock prices in the growth
segments of the U.S. economy,'' Weisel said.
<p>
   Indeed, the institutional investors who jammed the first floor
of the Ritz-Carlton here seemed particularly enamored of companies
that did away with wages altogether. For instance, Christos M.
Cotsakos, chief executive of E-Trade, the Internet brokerage
company, was the buzz of the conference after his presentation.
<p>
   Cotsakos showcased the firm's advertising campaign, which
lampoons investing stereotypes. In one ad, a spoof of the old E.F.
Hutton commercials, two women are chatting in a restaurant. One
leans over and asks, ``So what does your broker say?'' As the
restaurant falls silent, her companion replies, ``I don't use a
broker.'' She uses E-Trade, which has 230,000 accounts and averages
17,000 transactions a day, of which, Montgomery analysts like to
point out ``only 14 percent require human intervention.''
<p>
   Only about 3 percent of the 60 million retail brokerage accounts
in the United States are handled on line, making the field, in
Montgomery's eyes, ripe for growth.
<p>
   Another popular theme at the conference was the growth potential
in the privatization of public institutions like schools and
prisons. The Corrections Corp. of America, which contracts with
governments to manage prisons, and the CBT Group, which develops
interactive training software, both drew big crowds. (So did an
analyst workshop on semiconductors entitled ``Staying Alive.'' But
attendance there may have been bolstered by a strobe-lit
performance by Montgomery associates, who, in a takeoff on an Intel
TV ad, wore white clean-room suits and danced to music from that
disco classic, ``Saturday Night Fever.'')
<p>
   ``Almost 40 percent of the GDP growth is tied to the
infotechnology business,'' said John K. Skeen, Montgomery's senior
managing director of research. ``As a result of that you have very
serious investment opportunities.''
<p>
   Skeen described the mood of the conference as ``ebullient'' but
not ``giddy,'' as the Beverly Hills predators' balls of the 1980s
were so often described.
<p>
   ``We might happen to have Willie Nelson or Dana Carvey, but
there are no limos driving people to these events  &MD;  we take
buses,'' he said, referring to the shuttles chartered for the
purpose. ``I seem to recall in Lalaland they were traveling in
sleds with hot tubs in the back.''
<p>
   To be sure, there was no slacking during the workday among the
attendees, whose firms control over $5 trillion of equity
investments, and the 235 presenters, whose market value comes to
about $1.2 trillion.
<p>
   ``We get to talk to more investors here than in any other
forum,'' said Thomas G. Stemberg, chief executive of Staples, the
office-supply retailer, as he hurried from his presentation to the
closed-to-the-media breakout sessions, where executives are grilled
on all aspects of their business.
<p>
   Breakfast started at 6:30 a.m. and was cleared promptly at 7:30.
Attendees packed the high-technology TV room on the hotel's second
floor, where in a feat of extreme multitasking they could watch
four presentations simultaneously.
<p>
   So why not let loose a little in the evenings?
<p>
   ``Is it too much?'' asked Ron Jacks, a portfolio manager at
Seneca Capital Management, sipping a Dixie beer last Tuesday
evening. ``If it is, it'll become evident  &MD;  five years later.''

   Buffalo, New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Buffalo stocks fell
this week, led by General Motors Corp., Bethlehem Steel Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Buffalo Stock Index, an employee-weighted list of
58 companies with operations in the region, declined 0.77, or 0.42
percent, to 184.65 this week. The index is up 38 percent so far
this year.
<p>
   For the week, Detroit-based General Motors fell 1 3 5/8 to 65
15/16. On Friday, shares of the Detroit-based automaker gained 3/4.
<p>
   Bethlehem Steel shares declined 1 15/16 to 10 1/4 this week.
Shares of the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based steel company fell 9/16
on Friday. On Thursday, steelmaker shares fell after Salomon
Brothers Inc. analyst Michelle Applebaum cut ratings on several
producers, even though she did not downgrade Bethlehem Steel.
<p>
   Ford Motor shares fell 1 1/4 to 43 15/16 this week. On Friday,
shares of the Detroit-based automaker declined 1/16. On Wednesday,
a leading executive of Ford's Brazil unit acknowledged that because
of an ``oversight,'' his company failed to register Argentine auto
imports, an apparent violation of Brazil's auto import rules.
<p>
   Among gaining issues, Moog Class A shares rose 1 7/16 this week
to a 52-week high of 40. On Friday, shares of the East Aurora, New
York-based maker of electronic and hydraulic controls gained 7/8.
Moog Class A shares have risen 71.1 percent this year.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Buffalo stock index, which posted a smaller loss
than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index this week, was outperformed by
the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index for
the period.
<p>
   This week, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index fell 5.29, or 0.56
percent, to 945.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.91, or

<p>
   Vancouver, British Columbia, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Loewen
Group Inc., North America's second-largest funeral-services
company, lost its status as one of the premier growth stocks and it
may take more than a year before earnings again meet expectations,
analysts said.
<p>
   In the last two years, the Burnaby, British Columbia-based
company has been accused of paying too much for new properties,
waging a fight against a potential US$4.3 billion takeover bid by a
U.S.-based rival and losing what many said was an avoidable
lawsuit. Impressive growth earlier in the decade also raised
investors' expectations unrealistically, analysts said.
<p>
   Last week's announcement by the company that it will take a
third-quarter charge and post a loss and that its fourth-quarter
results will be weaker-than-expected was another in a string of
surprises in recent years that have disappointed investors. The
development also gave credence that Loewen Group may have expanded
too fast and now its paying the price.
<p>
   ``There are a lot of very unhappy shareholders,'' said David
Brodie, an analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. in Toronto.
Brodie organized a recent meeting between Loewen Group executives
and institutional investors. ``They're quite a restive lot,'' he
said.
<p>
   Brodie said the company has failed to ``manage expectations''
and as a result it ``will have to spend some time in the penalty
box.''
<p>
   Its market capitalization rose as high as US$2.5 billion a year
ago, amid talk of a takeover offer, from US$550 million at the end
of 1992. It's now US$1.7 billion.
<p>
   With more than 1,000 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries, Loewen
Group is second in size in North America to only Service Corp.
International of Houston. Loewen Group generated US$908.4 million
in revenue in 1996; Service Corp. had US$2.3 billion.
<p>
   Ray Loewen, who founded the company and remains its chairman,
chief executive and largest single shareholder with a 15.3 percent
stake, is relentless in his pursuit of growth.
<p>
   While analysts said that determination has made Loewen Group an
industry leader, it also raised expectations the company couldn't
meet, analysts said.
<p>
   ``There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Loewen,'' said
Michael Farr, president of investment manager Farr, Miller and
Washington in Washington, D.C. Farr said he doesn't see any need to
rush out and buy Loewen Group stock, though.
<p>
   In other words, don't expect Loewen Group shares, which rose 1/8
to 27 7/16 in New York, to go anywhere fast.
<p>
   Brodie has a 12-month target of US$33. While still bullish, even
analysts at Smith Barney Inc., one of Loewen Group's key financial
advisers, have lowered their target stock price to US$43 from US$55
a year ago.
<p>
   Company executives maintain the board made the right decision in
rejecting takeover overtures from Service Corp. a year ago.
<p>
   Service Corp. first proposed a merger valuing Loewen Group at
US$43 a share, then said it would proceed with a hostile bid valued
at US$45 a share.
<p>
   Service Corp. ended its quest in January without ever making a
formal offer, citing Loewen Group's anti-takeover efforts.
<p>
   Since then Loewen Group shares have slumped. The stock is
trading at 39 percent of Service Corp.'s hostile price. Analysts
and investors said the onus is now on Loewen Group to reassure them
that there are no other obstacles to clear.
<p>
   ``There's no earnings problem and there's no revenue-growth
problem,'' said Paul Wagler, Loewen Group's chief financial
officer. The company expects to grow at a rate of 20 percent a year
with a relatively steady level of acquisitions in the US$500
million to US$600 million range, he said.
<p>
   Wagler, who said the company isn't overpaying for acquisitions
as some critics have suggested, added that the third-quarter charge
is intended to reduce Loewen Group's cost structure and improve
overall profitability.
<p>
   ``You could say that the speed of our growth, in and of itself,
caused the cost structure to be a little higher'' than preferred,
Wagler said.
<p>
   Wagler acknowledged that investors, including himself and the
company's chairman, are ``disappointed'' at the stock's recent
performance.
<p>
   Analysts and investors will be looking for predictable results
from the company going forward. Earnings estimates for this year
and next have been pared to between US$1.30 and US$1.40 in 1997 and
between US$1.65 and US$1.75 in 1998. Wagler said those estimates
are ``in the right ballpark.''
<p>
   Loewen Group's meteoric rise since its initial offering in 1987
came to a halt in late 1995 when a Mississippi jury ordered the
company to pay US$500 million to settle a breach-of-contract
lawsuit.
<p>
   The jury verdict, which Ray Loewen later called ``a stray
bullet,'' wiped out more than half of Loewen Group's market
capitalization and by January 1996 it was days away from a
bankruptcy protection filing.
<p>
   While Loewen Group negotiated a lower out-of-court settlement to
resolve the lawsuit, the experience put a heightened focus on the
company.
<p>
   ``I think most companies go through halcyon days when people
credit them with abilities and achievements maybe even beyond what
they have done,'' Wagler said, alluding to the company's pre-1995
growth.
<p>
   ``And definitely there are dog days when people don't give you
credit for what you are doing,'' Wagler said of the company's more
recent developments. ``We certainly have had our share of both.''

<p>
    &UR; WHAT &LR;  A&AMP;F Quarterly, the latest in the magalogue trend.
<p>
    &UR; WHAT'S A MAGALOGUE? &LR;  A catalogue masquerading as a magazine,
mailed free to credit-card customers but also sold on newsstands.
With A&AMP;F Quarterly (cover price: $4), Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch one-ups
J. Crew by sandwiching the ``merch'' (casual clothes like chambray
shirts shorts and cargo pants) between Bruce Weber black-and-white
photos of shirtless, muscled young men. This, plus articles on
subjects like cool 1970s trucks and ``Must Have Mongrels'' (Tip No.
1: ``Go for solid brown, beige or black mutts because they'll
always complement what you're wearing.'') Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch even
brought in a real live magazine editor: Tyler Brule, the creator
and editorial director of Wallpaper, the trendy London magazine for
post-modern urban consumerists.
<p>
    &UR; WHY &LR;  While costly to produce, a magalogue creates a mystique
for a product line. The kind of hip, all-American student who has a
mutt and drives an old truck would, by association, wear
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch trousers (or ``trou,'' as they are called
here.)
<p>
    &UR; DOES IT SELL? &LR;  ``Yeah, sure,'' said Maqbool Ilahi, the manager
of a newsstand in the Metropolitan Life Building that does well
with the $10 Spiegel catalogue. Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch agreed. It is
doubling its initial 425,000 print run for the winter issue, due
out next month.
<p>
    &UR; THE TRADITION &LR;  Patagonia began to include articles in its
catalogue back in the 1970s, as did Banana Republic before its
catalogue was discontinued in 1988 (and let's face it, the Sears
catalogue was always good reading). But Neiman Marcus raised the
stakes in 1996 with the debut of The Book, a magalogue with heavy
art-book paper, avant-garde photos and articles like Christopher
Buckley's on his night out with two supermodels. The Book, which
comes out nine times a year, has a cover price of $10. Some 20,000
are sold on newsstands. And The Book sells advertisements to other
companies for $50,000 a page.
<p>
    &UR; EVERYONE IN THE POOL &LR;  Louis Boston, a Barneys-type store, has
come out with Louie. The fall issue's theme? The minimalist
movement in England, including articles on restaurants and the
cinema in London. Aveda, the aroma-therapy empire, has introduced a
magalogue. Moxiegirl, which had its debut in August, sells clothes,
accessories and cosmetics for teen-age girls and publishes articles
by teen-age girls, horoscopes and entertainment pieces.
<p>
    &UR; DISSENT &LR;  ``A lot of people are getting in a flap about it,
saying the lines are blurred,'' said Brule, who claims not to be
worried should magaloques compete with Wallpaper. ``Relax,'' he
said. ``It's still a catalogue at the end of the day.'' Just in
case, A&AMP;F Quarterly's recommended reading list includes, in
addition to The Economist and a book on Marshall McLuhan,
Wallpaper.

 &UR; UPSTART AMERICAN PERSIMMONS ADD TO FALL COLORS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For release Sun., Sept. 28) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (JT) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By LEE REICH &LR;  &QC;   &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;   &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   The American persimmon tree ``has received more criticism, both
adverse and favorable, than almost any known species,'' W.F.
Fletcher wrote for an Agriculture Department Farmers' Bulletin in
1915.
<p>
   If your mouth has ever been puckered by an unripe American
persimmon, you know much of the reason for this adverse criticism.
The bad press goes back to the early 17th century, when Captain
John Smith, of Jamestown fame, wrote: ``If it is not ripe it will
draw a man's mouth awrie with much torment.'' In modern parlance, I
liken eating an unripe persimmon to having the business end of a
vacuum cleaner in my mouth  &MD;  and the sensation lingers even after
spitting out the fruit.
<p>
   Ah, but eating a ripened persimmon is as pleasurable as eating
an unripened one is horrible. Smith went on to say that ``when it
is ripe, it is as delicious as an apricot.''
<p>
   In contrast to the larger, firmer Oriental persimmon found in
food markets, fruit of the American persimmon (Diospyros
virginiana) has the look and size of a cherry tomato, with a
similar range of color, from yellow to orange to deep red. When
ready to eat, an American persimmon is too soft to be a market
fruit but fine for backyards, where fruits need travel no more than
arm's length. At that point, the flesh has a richness and texture
akin to a wet, dried apricot with a dash of spice.
<p>
   Differences between American and Oriental persimmon go beyond
the fruit. Cold tolerance, for example. American persimmon is
native from Connecticut to Florida and west to Kansas, and some
varieties tolerate Zone 4 winters, characteristic of Albany, N.Y.
<p>
   Compared with its Oriental cousin, which has been improved by
centuries of breeding and selection, American persimmon is an
upstart. The first variety to be named was discovered in 1880 on a
farm in Alton, Ill. Early-ripening, flavorful and small, the seeded
Early Golden began a lineage of high-quality varieties that include
Garretson, Killen, John Rick and Meader. That 1915 bulletin listed
12 varieties.
<p>
   Many wild persimmons never develop good flavor, so the first key
to enjoying persimmons is to plant a variety known to bear tasty
fruits. Grafted trees range in price from about $12 to $25. In the
Hudson Valley, near the northern limit for growing persimmons, I
choose varieties that can survive frigid winters, in addition to
being able to ripen fruit in a short growing season. Contrary to
lore, frost is not necessary to ripen a persimmon  &MD;  nor will it.
What is needed is time. Szukis and Meader are varieties that ripen
fruits in the Northeast, even after temperatures plummet below
minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Other cold-hardy varieties that ripen
in short seasons are Hicks, Pieper, Dooley and Slate. They vary in
color and size.
<p>
   There is one more wrinkle in selecting a persimmon variety  &MD; 
pollination. Wild trees and many cultivated varieties are either
male or female. To get fruit from a female, you have to rely on
nearby male wild trees for pollination, plant a male nearby or
graft a male branch onto a female tree.
<p>
   Fortunately, not all females need males to set fruit. Some
female varieties accommodate gardeners by bearing occasional male
branches  &MD;  a characteristic prevalent in Early Golden and its
offspring. And some females do not need pollination to set fruit,
which is then seedless. Varieties that can bear fruit in isolation
include Meader, Szukis, Early Golden, Florence and Garretson.
<p>
   In contrast to many other fruits, persimmon is a low-maintenance
plant. I never need to spray my persimmons, and I prune them little
or not at all. Young trees benefit from occasional shortening or
removal of misplaced branches. But once fruit bearing begins,
usually three to four years after planting, persimmons become
somewhat self-pruning as they naturally drop some branches that
have borne fruit. What more could you ask for from a fruit tree?
<p>
   Persimmon also is not particularly finicky as to site. The tree
tolerates a wide range of soils, except those that are waterlogged.
It must have at least a half day of sunshine to fruit well. As a
tree matures, sprouts originating from the roots may appear five
feet or more from the parent plant. This suckering habit caused
farmers at the turn of the century to curse the plant as it spread
into their fields, but it is not a problem in mown lawn. And lawn
is a good place for a persimmon tree, since some varieties drop
their fruit when it is ripe and it can then plummet to the ground
intact.
<p>
   Persimmons grow to 50 feet or higher but are never imposing.
Drooping leaves and branches  &MD;  particularly when bearing the weight
of fruit  &MD;  give the tree a relaxed, languid appearance. A bluish
cast to the leaves enhances the soft look. The checkered pattern of
the bark makes the trunk seem wrapped in alligator hide (droll, not
frightening).
<p>
   Through much of the year, the persimmon is an asset to the
landscape. My trees' leaves stay prim through summer's end, when
those of most other plants look battered by wind, rain and insect
forays. Come fall, the tree's languid appearance is livened by the
bright fruits ripening among the lush leaves. Autumn color can be
spectacular, with leaves anywhere from clear yellow to crimson,
depending on the variety.
<p>
   Even after leaves have dropped, fruits of some varieties  &MD; 
Szukis, for example  &MD;  cling to branches, festooning the leafless
trees like Christmas ornaments. I eat some persimmons as they
ripen; others I let hang on the branches to be plucked at my
pleasure through the fall.

   Newark, New Jersey, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- New Jersey stocks
were mixed this week, led by shares of Biomatrix Inc. and Computer
Horizons Corp.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Star-Ledger Index fell 0.21, or 0.15 percent, to
141.56 since the close of trading Sept. 19. The index is a
price-weighted measure of 234 companies that are either based in
New Jersey or are major employers in the state.
<p>
   Another measure of the state's economy -- the Bloomberg New
Jersey Index -- rose 0.16 percent, or 0.24 points, this week to
153.34 from 153.10. That index includes the top 25 New Jersey
employers ranked by market value.
<p>

   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Corel Corp. expects its move
into the corporate market for software will be profitable within a
few quarters even though it's now dominated by Microsoft Corp.
<p>
   Michael Cowpland, Corel's president and chief executive, said
the focus on corporate sales rather than its traditional retail
market will be successful because the company has new software
products and plans to boost its sales force.
<p>
   His optimism comes even though Corel earlier this week reported
a third-quarter loss of US$31.4 million, or 52 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of US$3.2 million, or 5 cents.
Corel expects to lose US$15 million to US$20 million in the fourth
quarter.
<p>
   ``The business going into 1998 will be profitable just based on
our core products,'' Cowpland said in an interview.
<p>
   To win corporate business for its WordPerfect software, which
includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation
applications, Corel will hire 50 salesmen within the next six
months. The company will also start a service and technology
integration business that will hire 30 people over the next year.
<p>
   Corel is hoping revenue will receive a boost when its new
network computers from wholly owned Corel Computer Corp. start
shipping in the fourth quarter, he said.
<p>
   Network computers are no frills desktop machines that rely on a
central computer to store data and software. Corel believes network
computers save money because they're cheaper to maintain than
desktop computers.
<p>
   Although Cowpland declined to project Corel Computer's unit
sales next year, he said the company will go public when it shows
sustainable sales.
<p>
   Corel said it will break even or have a small profit in year
ended November 1998 while will be flat at about US$325 million.
<p>
   Corel shares rose C$0.10 to C$5.60 in Toronto.

<p>
   Dallas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Trading in Camelot Corp. shares
was halted late this afternoon by the Nasdaq Stock Market as it
requested more information from the company.
<p>
   Mike Shokouhi, a Nasdaq spokesman, declined to provide
additional information about the halt.
<p>
   Before trading stopped, shares in the Dallas-based Internet
video conferencing technology developer fell 22 percent, or 2 1/4
to 8, on trading of 2.2 million shares. That's more than the 1.5
million shares outstanding.
<p>
   Over the prior two days, Camelot's stock tripled after the
money-losing company said Wednesday that it's in talks to license
its VideoTalk Internet video conferencing technology to major
personal computer makers. It didn't name the companies it's talking
to.
<p>
   In July, Camelot called VideoTalk a ``major breakthrough'' in
Internet video conferencing -- sending 15 frames a second over a
Pentium-equipped computer with a 28.8 modem.
<p>
   In an interview yesterday, an official at Intel Corp., maker of
Pentium chips, questioned whether VideoTalk's fram speed was really
a breakthrough.
<p>
   ``We've definitely seen Internet video conferencing with 28.8
modems get 15 frames per second,'' said John Middleton, product
manager for Intel's Create &AMP; Share Camera Pack.
<p>
   Camelot shares had tripled from Tuesday's close of 3 13/32 to
yesterday's close of 10 1/4 on two-day trading of 9 million shares.
<p>
   At 8, the price just before the trading halt, the shares were
down 87 percent from their 52-week high of 60, adjusted for a
one-for-40 reverse split on July 14.
<p>
   The company's market capitalization has dropped to $12 million
from more than $78 million in 1995, when Camelot Chairman and Chief
Executive Daniel Wettreich forecast big sales of its Internet
telephone software. The sales never materialized.
<p>
   Camelot's shares quadrupled in two weeks in August 1995, moving
from 75 on August 16 to 317 1/2 on August 25. The biggest gain was
on Aug. 24, after CNBC reporter Dan Dorfman said Camelot's
Digiphone Internet telephone software could generate sales of up to
$100 million in the next 12 months.
<p>
   ``Digiphone is a very profitable product, and we're going to be
selling large quantities of it,'' Wettreich said in a 1995
interview.
<p>
   Camelot's loss narrowed to $2.75 million from continuing
operations, or $2.54 per share, in the first fiscal quarter of 1998
ended July 31 from $3.1 million or $4.58 per share. Revenue
increased to $1.67 million from $767,000.
<p>
   It lost $5.14 million in fiscal 1996 ended April 30, 1996. It
had revenue of $3 million. For fiscal 1997, Camelot lost $13
million and its revenue slipped to $1.89 million.

<p>
   Dallas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.
shares fell 27 percent after the company said its third-quarter
earnings will be 10 percent below second-quarter levels because of
less-than-expected memory chip sales.
<p>
   Benchmarq shares fell 9 to 24 1/2 in trading of 1.02 million,
more than ten times its three-month daily average of 92,800.
<p>
   Benchmarq said late yesterday that sales and earnings this
quarter will be 10 percent below last quarter's levels because of
lower-than-anticipated demand from customers. The demand slowdown
is probably temporary, the company said in a statement.
<p>
   With second-quarter sales and earnings of $11.5 million and 22
cents, respectively, third-quarter figures should be about $10
million and 20 cents.
<p>
   Analysts were expecting Benchmarq to earn 24 cents, according to
a survey of 4 analysts by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Benchmarq makes non-volatile SRAM memory chips, or NVSRAMs, used
by networking equipment makers and other technology manufacturers.
The company faces many competitors in that market, said Hans
Mosesmann, Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. analyst.
<p>
   ``It's a commodity product,'' Mosesmann said.
<p>
   Mosesmann slashed his earnings estimate for this quarter to 19
cents from 25 cents. He is maintaining his ``buy'' rating on the
stock because Benchmarq's largest product line, battery management
products, is a growing business in which Benchmarq is the No. 1
supplier, he said.
<p>
   Battery management chips are used inside battery packs for
notebook computers and other small devices, to provide
``intelligent'' management of power.
<p>
   ``As people ask their notebook computers to do more functions,
more and more PC makers will need battery management products,''
Mosesmann said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   The name Oshkosh B'Gosh conjures up images of toddlers dressed
like farmhands, clambering around the swing set in overalls. Behind
that look is a 102-year-old, family-run Wisconsin company that rode
the affluence of the 1980s to become the biggest and best-known
brand in children's clothing.
<p>
   Late in that decade, however, Oshkosh B'Gosh's magic faded like
often-washed denim. Led from TK until the early 1990s by C.F. Hyde,
a member of one of its founding families, the company failed to
capitalize fully on its powerful brand name.
<p>
   It was also slow to move production overseas and to update its
shipping  &MD;  and the stock price meandered for years in the
mid-teens.
<p>
   The tide may be turning. A few years ago, C.F. Hyde's son,
Douglas, 47, took over as chief executive; another Hyde family
member, Michael Wachtel, 43, is now the chief operating officer.
The two have improved the company's efficiency and have recently
been seeking licensees.
<p>
   The price of the company's class A shares has risen
substantially, from about $15 in mid-April to $25.75 on Friday.
<p>
   The founding families, the Hydes and the Wymans, hold about 17
percent of the A shares, along with 87 percent of the class B
shares, which control seven of the nine board seats.
<p>
   To be sure, Oshkosh B'Gosh, which gets its name from an old
vaudeville line, has a long way to go. The recovery efforts, for
instance, have produced only modest profits  &MD;  $3.7 million in the
first half of 1997, versus a loss of $6.4 million in the period a
year earlier. Because of store closings and other initiatives,
sales fell to $168 million, compared with $203 million.
<p>
   And the apparel industry has changed greatly in recent years,
with tightfisted consumers refusing to buy until retailers put up
the sale signs.
<p>
   Because children's clothing is often bought as gifts, Oshkosh
may be less sensitive to this price pressure, yet its emphasis on
high-quality, fairly expensive goods  &MD;  a pair of toddler's overalls
costs about $26 at full price  &MD;  makes it vulnerable.
<p>
   In many other ways, however, Oshkosh has become stronger. By
closing two domestic sewing plants, moving much production
overseas, increasing reliance on subcontractors and cutting
inventory through the use of more precise shipping systems, it has
trimmed expenses.
<p>
   Based on such efforts, Amor Towles, an analyst at Select Equity
Group, estimated that Oshkosh' per-share earnings would rise 23
percent, from $1.65 in 1997 to $2.03 in 1998.
<p>
   The company's managers seem confident, too. From mid-1994 until
just a few weeks ago, Oshkosh bought back 4.6 million A shares for
$83.2 million.
<p>
   During the stock's recent run-up, Richard C. Blum &AMP; Associates,
a money management firm that focuses on companies in turnarounds,
cashed in its 10.7 percent of Oshkosh shares. While that move may
reflect a belief that the stock is fully priced, some Oshkosh
shareholders say it can go higher.
<p>
   Whitney George, managing director of Royce &AMP; Associates, a
mutual fund company with a significant investment in Oshkosh,
agrees with Towles that the company can earn $2 a share annually
within the next few years. He also sees Oshkosh as the kind of
company that the professionals may undervalue. ``Wall Street
underreacts when companies go from bleeding to growing in a short
time frame,'' George said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Senate Republican Leader
Trent Lott opened a long-sought debate on campaign finance reform
today with an attack on President Bill Clinton. There's no reason
to impose new restrictions on campaign contributions and spending,
Lott said, though existing laws need to be obeyed by all, including
the Democratic president. ``President Clinton's standing on the
subject of campaign finance reform is a case study of the problem,
not an exemplar of the solution,'' Lott said. ``Indeed, it would
take the Senate and the House too, staying in marathon session all
the way through Christmas, just to trace the appalling campaign
finance practices that were so large a part of Mr. Clinton's
re-election effort,'' Lott said.
<p>
   Clinton declined to return Lott's fire, instead calling on the
public to pressure Congress for change.
<p>
   ``You should say to congressmen and senators: `Pass good
campaign finance reform this year,' '' the president said in a
speech to college students at Jan Jacinto Community College near
Houston. ``Do it. We want it.''
<p>
   Lott's comments on the Senate floor set the tone for the debate
that followed today on both sides of the political aisle.
<p>
   The full Senate is expected to take much of the next few weeks
considering legislation that would ban so-called soft money
contributions to political parties, as well as bolster disclosure
requirements on donations to individual candidates. No votes are
anticipated until at least next week, when some amendments will
likely be considered. It remains unclear if the entire measure will
ever be voted on this year. ``This is a defining moment,'' said
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. ``The American people ...
know the system is broken (and) we have the opportunity to fix it.
<p>
   ``People who think they can kill this effort with political
gamesmanship without anyone noticing are wrong,'' Daschle said.
``If we squander this opportunity, it will not go unnoticed.''
<p>
   Lott said he expects the divided, Republican-led Senate will be
unable to agree on a measure, regardless of how it may be revised
and amended.
<p>
   ``Are we going to come together on a consensus?'' said Lott, a
foe of the legislation backed by Clinton. ``I have my doubts we
have reached that point.''
<p>
   Lott and fellow Republicans say they can kill the measure by
filibustering, or preventing it from coming up for a vote. To cut
off debate and move to an up or down vote would require the support
of 60 of the chamber's 100 lawmakers.
<p>
   At this point, proponents have the backing of just 49 lawmakers
-- all of the chamber's 45 Democrats, along with four of the 55
Republicans.
<p>
   Sens. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell Feingold,
a Wisconsin Democrat, are chief sponsors of the legislation.
<p>
   McCain, Feingold, and their fellow proponents say the measure is
needed to curb the chase for money on Capitol Hill, which now sees
lawmakers scheduling votes on legislation around their respective
fund raisers.
<p>
   Special interests, from business to labor to environmentalists,
often contribute because they see it as a way to secure access to
lawmakers on legislation affecting their causes.
<p>
   McCain, in making a pitch for his bill, said, ``Most Americans
believe we will let this nation pay any price, bear any burden, to
ensure the success of our personal ambitions. ``Now is the moment
we can show the American people that they are wrong,'' he said.
``We can take courage from our convictions and not our campaign
treasuries.''
<p>
   Lott and other opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill maintain
that restrictions on campaign contributions and spending would
amount to an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. ``The
America people can decide for themselves ... who to trust on this
matter,'' Lott said.
<p>
   Thirty-two Senate Republicans responded to a letter to them from
Clinton requesting passage of the McCain-Feingold bill, with a
pointed written response. ``We appreciate your suggestion that
passing this bill is the 'responsible' thing to do in order to
restore public trust,'' they wrote the president. However, ``We
believe it is not more laws, but more people obeying the laws, that
will restore public trust.''
<p>
   Clinton is the target of a congressional probe as well as a
Justice Department review for suspected fund-raising abuses. Lott
noted that Clinton arranged to attend a fund-raiser in Houston
today. ``What is he saying, 'Stop me before I do it again?' ''
<p>
   Lott had opposed taking up the McCain-Feingold bill, but made a
sudden about-face yesterday. He did so just two days after Clinton
threatened to keep Congress in session until it considered the
measure.
<p>
   House Republican Leader Dick Armey of Texas said Tuesday that
his chamber would consider a similar measure this year as well.
<p>
   He and other House Republican leaders, however, have declined to
say when that debate would begin.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican and long-time
foe of campaign spending limits, said yesterday he would favor
legislation that removes restrictions on giving.

<p>
   Indeed, Oshkosh's class A shares have a multiple of 16 times
1997 estimated earnings per share and 13 times estimated 1998
earnings, according to Towles'd forecast. Those multiples are lower
than the average of TK for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
and lower than the corresponding forward multiples for many other
apparel companies.
<p>
   ``Oshkosh still looks cheap relative to its two-year earnigs
outlook,'' Towlkes said.
<p>
   How much more can the stock rise? ``I think the upside is in
excess of 50 percent over two years,'' Towles said.
<p>
   He offers a different reason for the underpricing. He says the
Oshkosh recovery has gone partly unnoticed because many analysts
and brokers stopped following the company during its troubled
years.
<p>
   In fact, First Call, which compiles analysts' earnings
estimates, has not been able to calculate consensus earnings for
Oshkosh. Towles is the only analyst who has made public
projections.
<p>
   An industry pattern of steady sales growth should also help
Oshkosh. Domestic sales of children's apparel rose from about $22
billion in 1992 to about $28 billion in 1996, according to NPD
Group, a market research firm. And they should continue such growth
in the years ahead, analysts said.
<p>
   Oshkosh is making an international push, too. Foreign sales
account for about 25 percent of revenue but could reach 50 percent
by 2002, Hyde said.
<p>
   Oshkosh is trying to edge its way into the premium-clothes
market for children ages 7 to 12, too. The company first tried to
reach this older group when it bought a separate retail chain,
named Genuine Kids, which coincidentally echoed the company's
slogan, ``The Genuine Article.''
<p>
   But the strategy of these stand-alone stores had unimpressive
results failed; in the past year or so, the company shuttered 65
Genuine Kids stores and converted another 27 into regular Oshkosh
outlets or combined them with such outlets.
<p>
   But the company's Genuine Kids merchandise is a more promising.
Introduced in Oshkosh' own shops in February, the lines have
climbed to as high as 19 percent of sales in recent weeks,
according to Select Equity.
<p>
   ``It opens an entirely new market for them,'' Towles said.
<p>
   Then comes the profit potential in the Oshkosh name.
<p>
   The children's clothing landscape of the 90s may be crowded with
powerful brands like Nautica, Gap, Polo, and Tommy Hilfiger  &MD;  not
to mention more conventional competitors as Carter's.
<p>
   But the Oshkosh name, besides carrying smaller price tags than
some of the newer fashion brands, may be the closest thing to a
seal of approval in children's clothes.
<p>
   In a 1996 survey by the Total Research Corp., 2,000 consumers
were asked to rank 182 brands of varying kinds of products in terms
of quality. Oshkosh ranked ninth in the poll, known as the
Equitrend survey, ahead of household names like Lego, Nike and IBM.
<p>
   ``The brand has exceptional equity and people would kill to have
it,'' said John Morton, senior vice president of Total Research.
<p>
   Oshkosh wants to license the use of its famed name for products
that may include strollers, toys, books and videos. Such
arrangements have the potential to produce cash with relatively
little investment, although Hyde expected that these deals would
not show up on the Oshkosh bottom line before 1999.
<p>
   Of course, investors in Oshkosh should realize that its future
will be determined by the Wymans and the Hydes  &MD;  the same folks who
presided over its problems in the 1980s. But then again, these are
the people who built up this century-old enterprise in the first
place.

<p>
   Minneapolis, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Medi-Ject Corp. said it
voluntarily recalled some components of its Medi-Jector Choice
device for diabetics after receiving a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration warning letter.
<p>
   The FDA's letter regarded the company's handling of complaints
about the device and problems found during an inspection in August,
Medi-Ject said. The company said it corrected the problems and the
FDA has accepted the changes, though the company still decided to
recall certain Medi-Jector components because customers had
reported failures of the device, which delivers insulin into the
body.
<p>
   ``A small number of complaints of syringe and adapter failures
have been reported from the field,'' said Franklin Pass, chairman
and chief executive officer of the Minneapolis-based company, in a
statement. ``No significant patients injuries have been reported
from product failure . . . To be most conservative, we have decided
to voluntarily recall and replace product.''
<p>
   The company made the announcement after the market closed in the
U.S. Medi-Ject shares fell 1/8 to close at 3 1/8 today.
<p>
   The company said it doesn't expect the recall ``to have a
significant impact on its financial results.'' The recall should be
finished by Nov. 1, the company said. Company officials weren't
immediately available for comment.
<p>
   The Medi-Jector uses a high-pressure stream of liquid to inject
insulin through the skin, without using a needle. Insulin is a
hormone needed by diabetics to control the amount of blood sugar in
their system. If blood sugar isn't controlled properly, diabetics
can suffer from complications leading to stroke, blindness and even
death.

<p>
   Atlanta, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- SunTrust Banks Inc. agreed to
acquire investment bank and brokerage Equitable Securities Corp.
for about $148.9 million in stock and incentives, in a bid to
expand its securities business.
<p>
   The Atlanta-based bank said it would create a securities unit,
SunTrust Equitable Securities, combining Equitable Securities'
corporate finance and stock research, underwriting sales and
trading with the fixed-income business of its SunTrust Capital
Markets.
<p>
   ``The addition of Equitable strengthens our strategy of
providing a full range of financial services to our corporate,
commercial and private banking customers,'' said SunTrust President
L. Phillip Humann in a statement.
<p>
   Banks like SunTrust have been buying securities companies to
offer more products to businesses and investors, as the regulatory
walls between brokers and banks erode. SunTrust wants to supply all
financial services, from stocks and bonds to loans and checking
accounts.
<p>
   SunTrust said it will issue 1.31 million shares, worth $87.9
million based on yesterday's close, for closely held Equitable
Securities. That's about 3.26 times its $27 million book value. The
bank said it will pay an additional 909,000 shares, worth $61
million, over three to five years, based on the new unit's
performance.
<p>
   The bank said the transaction, scheduled to close during the
first quarter, will have no impact on earnings per share.
<p>
   Nashville, Tennessee-based Equitable Securities, founded in
1930, also has private banking and money management businesses with
about $1.5 billion under management. It has offices in Nashville,
Atlanta and Houston.
<p>
   SunTrust is the 20th-largest U.S. bank with $62.8 billion in
total assets and 700 branches in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama. Its shares rose 1 1/16 to 68 7/16.
<p>
   Last month, SunTrust Capital Markets head R. Charles Shufeldt
told the Bloomberg Forum the bank would apply for regulatory
permission to underwrite debt and equity after the Federal Reserve
eased restrictions on bank-owned securities businesses. Permission
is expected to be granted during the first quarter.

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- MGI Software Corp. shares rose
almost 15 percent and touched a 52-week high after the company said
fiscal second-quarter revenue almost doubled because of its
software used to manipulate photographs and video images.
<p>
   MGI shares jumped C$0.80 to C$6.20 (US$4.45) in Toronto trading
of 371,900 shares, more than five times the three-month daily
average of 73,000. The shares, which earlier reached C$6.25,
started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday after
previously being listed on the over-the-counter Canadian Dealing
Network.
<p>
   The Toronto-based company said revenue in the quarter ended July
31 jumped to C$5.47 million from C$3.09 million in the year-earlier
period. MGI had a loss of C$1.58 million, or C$0.08 a share,
compared with C$1.09 million, or C$0.07, a year earlier.
<p>
   ``Digital photography has become one of the fastest growing
markets in the computer software industry and our leadership
reflects this trend,'' said Anthony DeCristofaro, MGI's president
and chief executive.
<p>
   MGI's PhotoSuite and VideoWave software enables computer users
to capture images and edit images for presentations, World Wide Web
sites and publishing.
<p>
   In the photographic market, MGI competes against Microsoft
Corp.'s Picture It software and Adobe Systems Inc.'s Photo Deluxe
application.
<p>
   MGI plans to raise C$14.8 million through an offering of 3.5
million warrants. The financing is being managed by Gordon Capital
Corp., Canaccord Capital Corp. and Griffiths McBurney &AMP; Partners.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania
accused Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr Friday of
being ``unconscionably slow'' in completing his investigation.
<p>
   ``I don't know what Starr's been doing,'' Specter told
reporters. ``I think (Starr's probe) has been interminable.''
<p>
   Starr, who had no comment on Specter's attack, has come under
strong criticism from Democrats and editorial writers. But
Spector's comments were noteworthy because of his political
affiliation and the fact that he is a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which oversees the 1978 law that established
independent counsel probes of high-ranking government officials.
<p>
   Specter also serves on the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, which is looking into alleged improper fund-raising,
especially by the Democrats in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election
effort.
<p>
   Starr, since his appointment in 1994, has examined the roles of
President and Mrs. Clinton in the Ozarks land investment venture
known as Whitewater. The Clintons' partners were their one-time
friends, James and Susan McDougal.
<p>
   Whitewater and other questionable financial dealings led to the
insolvency of James McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan in
1989, at a cost of $60 million to taxpayers. The Clintons have
claimed they knew nothing of McDougal's deals and have noted that
they lost money on the venture.
<p>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has begun Justice Department
inquiries that may lead to the appointment of one or more
independent counsels to investigate Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
<p>
   Specter said Friday that if Reno asks a federal three-judge
panel here to appoint an independent counsel in those cases, the
judges should look to role models other than Starr. ``I think the
court can do a better job than (appointing another) Ken Starr,''
Specter said.
<p>
   He noted that ``Starr has had some recalcitrant witnesses'' in
the Whitewater probe, but he charged that ``Starr's been
unconscionably slow.''
<p>
   He added: ``I'd like to know where he is. I think Starr owes
(the nation) a report on what he's done and why he hasn't done
more.''
<p>
   Specter also criticized Starr for maintaining his private law
practice here while he serves as independent counsel, a position
with offices in Washington and in Little Rock.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Starr announced he would leave the Whitewater
post to become dean of the Pepperdine University law school in
Malibu, Calif. After protests by Specter and others, Starr took
back his resignation.
<p>
   Under Starr, who was sworn in Aug. 9, 1994, and his predecessor,
Robert B. Fiske Jr., who served seven months, the Whitewater probe
has cost $34 million.
<p>
   ``I think there needs to be a little judicial supervision on
these independent counsels,'' Specter said. ``The court might
decide to put some parameters on time length (saying): `You have so
much time. You can have more time when you come back and show us
what you got.'''
<p>
   Last year, Starr lost prosecutions of two Arkansas bankers,
Robert Hill and Herby Branscum, on Whitewater-related fraud
charges. But he won convictions of the McDougals and Arkansas Gov.
Jim Guy Tucker.
<p>
   Starr also won a guilty plea from former Associate Attorney
General Webster Hubbell, a Clinton confidant, who admitted bilking
his former employer, the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock.
<p>
   After his conviction, James McDougal agreed to cooperate with
Starr. Hubbell and Susan McDougal have refused.
<p>
   Starr has issued subpoenas for White House records on contacts
the Clintons and top White House aides might have had last year
with the McDougals and Hubbell. The subpoenas suggest Starr is
looking for evidence of efforts to obstruct the investigation by
offering bribes to Hubbell and Susan McDougal to remain silent.

<p>
   According to conventional wisdom, too-rapid growth is an
indicator that a mutual fund's peak performance years have passed.
But sometimes conventional wisdom is wrong. A case in point is the
Sound Shore fund.
<p>
   Sound Shore has grown at breakneck speed. The fund started 1997
with $130 million in net assets and swelled to more than $800
million by the end of August.
<p>
   The lure has been a track record that is something to shout
about. The fund, which looks for values among big and mid-sized
stocks, has gained 35.5 percent this year, through Thursday,
compared with 25.8 percent for its peers.
<p>
   Over five years, its average annual return is 24.1 percent,
almost six percentage points higher than its peers, according to
Morningstar, the Chicago fund trackers.
<p>
   Sound Shore Management, which runs the no-load fund from
Greenwich, Conn., is one of the few fund operators without a
marketing department. The fund was started in 1985 primarily to
accommodate family, friends and corporate clients who wanted to
invest their own money, said T. Gibbs Kane Jr., who manages the
fund with Harry Burn III.
<p>
   Last September, Sound Shore employees and their families owned 6
percent of the fund, Kane said.
<p>
   Sound Shore normally requires a minimum initial investment of
$10,000, but that falls to $5,000 when it is bought through the
Charles Schwab, Jack White or Fidelity fund marketplaces. For
individual retirement accounts, the minimum is only $250.
<p>
   In May last year, Sound Shore signed on with the
no-transaction-fee program at Charles Schwab. While some
marketplace investors tend to move money more rapidly than others,
and therefore might quickly abandon a fund they've lost faith in,
there has been only evidence of broad investor confidence in Sound
Shore.
<p>
   Net cash flow this year, excluding reinvested dividends, has
totaled just over $700 million, according to company reports and
estimates from AMG Data Services. That compares with $54 million
for all of last year.
<p>
   Kane called the percentage of cash the fund receives from the
marketplaces ``significant,'' but he said he did not anticipate a
turn in its fortune because ``we take relatively low risk in the
fund.''
<p>
   How has Sound Shore been able to handle a growth spurt that
often trips up other funds, unable to invest new money fast enough
or well enough? Basically, it has stuck firmly to its strategy of
finding good values among midsized to large companies and holding
only about 40 of those stocks.
<p>
   So to invest fully the cash that has been coming its way this
year, it has bought more, in some cases a lot more, of each current
pick.
<p>
   In June 1996, for instance, the fund's biggest holding was
Compuware  &MD;  at 80,000 shares worth a little over $3 million,
Morningstar said. As of June this year, its shares of Compuware had
swelled to 370,000, worth $17.7 million, but that stake was only
the fund's 10th-biggest holding. The largest position at midyear
was in Banc One, with 509,000 shares valued at $24.7 million.
<p>
   Funds that buy stocks of the smallest companies can find it
difficult to buy large blocks without driving up the price of the
shares. But the Sound Shore managers look at larger-capitalization
stocks, those worth roughly $1 billion or more. The fund's
diversified mix gives it a median market capitalization of $3.3
billion.
<p>
   ``Also, we run other money in the firm, so it's not unusual for
us to handle large blocks of money,'' Kane said. The fund accounts
for about a third of their money-management business, with the
balance in institutional accounts.
<p>
   ``It's the same thing we would do if we started up a new
institutional account,'' he added. ``As long as we're focused and
true to the process we employ, growth shouldn't be an issue.''
<p>
   The two managers evaluate a universe of the 1,250 biggest
equities from major exchanges. From those, they find the stocks
with the lowest price-to-earnings ratios that sell at the biggest
discount from their historical P/E ratios, based on consensus
earnings estimates. The formula ``points us toward a set of stocks
that don't have, or have lost, investor confidence,'' Kane said.

   After they pare the group, they check other ratios, including
price to book, price to cash flow and price to sales. Then ``we
spend most of the day talking to the companies and their suppliers
to try to figure out why the stock is so cheap,'' Kane said.
<p>
   How can they find cheap stocks in today's market? Easily, Burn
said. There are more than 1,500 stocks with market capitalizations
of $1 billion or more, he said, and this year 234 of them are down
in price, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is up nearly
30 percent.
<p>
   Moreover, 252 of them have price-to-earnings ratios of no more
than 15 times estimated earnings  &MD;  which is 75 percent of the
market's ratio. And 185 of these have met or exceeded their latest
quarterly earnings estimates.
<p>
   ``Even in a market that is this high, there are still stocks
that are out of sync  &MD;  cheap and relatively poor performers,'' Burn
said. ``That's where we spend our time.''
<p>
   The fund, which typically has about 7 percent of assets in cash,
has a turnover ratio of around 70 percent, meaning stocks are held,
on average, 18 months to two years. ``It takes a while for a
company to move back into vogue again,'' Burn said.
<p>
   The two started Sound Shore Management in 1978. Kane, 50, had
previously worked as a large-cap stock analyst at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust; Burn, 53, had put in stints at Electronic Data
Systems and as a money manager at Chase Investment Counsel, a
Virginia firm. The two also excel at racquet sports: Burn at tennis
and Kane at squash.
<p>
   Wal-Mart is a good example of the type of stocks that the two
seek. In 1992, it was selling for more than 40 times calendar-year
earnings, more than double the S&AMP;P ratio. When Sound Shore bought
the stock this year, it was selling at 15.5 times earnings, a 20
percent discount to the index. A reasonable norm for the stock
today would be a 25 percent premium to the market, Burn said.
<p>
   The stock price reflected concerns about the company's growth
rate. Sound Shore met with management and felt comfortable that the
company would meet its fiscal year 1997 earnings projections of
$1.53 a share.
<p>
   The Wal-Mart supercenter stores were meeting their anticipated
returns and cash flow was turning positive, Burn said. The stock
closed on Friday at $36.25.
<p>
   The two are now adding to their position in Toys ``R'' Us, which
Kane said was similar to Wal-Mart in some ways. The company used to
set the standard in the toy industry, he said, selling at a
price-earnings ratio that was 30 percent higher than that of the
S&AMP;P. But the shares, which sold for more than $40 in 1992 and 1993,
traded under $25 earlier this year.
<p>
   The company is now benefiting from its Concept 2000 upgrade
program and from its acquisition of Baby Superstore, a chain that
was merged into comparable stores, eliminating competition and
strengthening its own operations, Kane said.
<p>
   Same-store sales, or those for stores open at least a year, are
strong in the refurbished stores, and the stock is selling at 80
percent of the S&AMP;P based on this year's earnings, he said. It
closed on Friday at $35.875.
<p>
   At mid-year, the company was the fund's second-largest holding,
with nearly 700,000 shares worth $24.5 million bought in the second
quarter.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Copper prices were steady
close to a nine-month low as strong demand from copper tube and
wire makers in the U.S. offset weak Asian demand.
<p>
   A spate of government reports show a healthy U.S. economy. The
nation's Gross Domestic product rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate
in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. While that's
down from the department's Aug. 28 estimate of a 3.6 percent rise,
it still shows a strong economy. Yesterday the Commerce Department
said that orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items such as
aircraft and refrigerators -- rose a larger-than-expected 2.7
percent to a record $186.598 billion.
<p>
   Consumption from U.S. manufacturers has kept the copper market
from collapsing under the growing weight of stockpiles in London
Metal Exchange warehouses. LME inventories are at a 19-month high
of 3,025 metric tons.
<p>
   ``The GDP and other reports are certainly positive for copper,''
said John Gross, vice president of strategic metals at BICC Cables
Corp. in West Nyack, New York. ``Good overall demand in the U.S. is
keeping the market reasonably steady in the face rising stockpiles
and the Asian economic downturn.''
<p>
   Copper for December delivery rose 0.45 cent, or 0.5 percent, to
95.2 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Copper for delivery in three months was $12 higher, or
0.6 percent, to $2,100 a metric ton (95.25 cents a pound) on the
London Metal Exchange.
<p>
   Copper consumption is closely tied with economic growth since
copper is used in products ranging from home wiring and car air
conditioners to plumbing fixtures.
<p>
   ``Business is very good,'' said Mike Watson, vice president of
copper tube sales at Mueller Copper Tube Co. in Fulton,
Mississippi. ``That's partly a seasonal thing -- we're at the end
of the air conditioning season and the beginning of the heating
season -- but its also because the housing and construction
industries are doing well.''
<p>
   Home resales unexpectedly rose by 3.3 percent last month to an
annual rate of 4.32 million, the National Association of Realtors
said yesterday. Strong sales of existing homes show health in the
construction industry, which accounts for one third of global
copper demand.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose with bonds on
a government report showing economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 74.17,
or 0.95 percent, to 7922.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained
7.31, or 0.8 percent, to 945.22, led by banks. The Nasdaq Composite
Index rose 3.35, or 0.2 percent, to 1682.24.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million money
management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   Falling interest rates boost demand for bank loans and make the
assets they own more attractive.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 13/16 to 113 15/16, leading a bank rally.
Among drug stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 2 to 82 1/2.
<p>
   U.S. bonds rose, rounding out a third week of gains, after the
government said economic growth in the second quarter was slower
than previously reported while inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   ``The (gross domestic product) results are positive for the bond
market; it makes it look like growth isn't that strong,'' said Ken
Anderson, who oversees $7 billion at Evergreen Asset Management
Corp., in Purchase, New York. Robust growth can fuel inflation,
which eats away at the value of bonds' fixed payments.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds gained 14/32, or $4.38 per
$1,000 bond, to 100 3/32, pushing the yield down 3 basis points to
6.37 percent. The two-year note yield fell 4 basis points to 5.78
percent.
<p>
   The Commerce Department put its final estimate of second-quarter
GDP growth at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, down from its previous
estimate of 3.6 percent. The price deflator, a measure of
inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the quarter, the
smallest rise since the second quarter of last year.
<p>
   Analysts had forecast a 1.5 percent rise in the deflator, which
measures both the magnitude of price increases and detects whether
higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
<p>
   ``Inflation is at such an extraordinary level that the slightly
higher revision isn't a problem,'' said Susan Hering, chief
economist at Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against the British pound in
two months on a report that the U.K. may join Europe's economic and
monetary union after it gets underway.
<p>
   An unidentified British cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the government is more eager to join Europe' single currency,
or euro, than it was several months ago. That could mean the U.K.
might need to cut interest rates to bring them into line with rates
elsewhere in Europe.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.25 percent versus the dollar to $1.6097 from
$1.6299 yesterday. The dollar was little changed at 121.27 yen from
121.13 and at 1.7588 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Actress Jane Fonda, warning that an emphasis on
sexual abstinence could reverse a decline in the nation's teen
birth rate, said Friday that schools also need to teach students
about condoms and other contraceptives.
<p>
   Fonda said the new welfare reform law, which earmarks $850
million for abstinence-only sex education in some schools, will
deny some students information on contraceptives.
<p>
   ``We have to be realistic in order to protect our kids,'' said
Fonda, a volunteer for Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention. ``There's a way to talk to children about relationships
and sexuality that is appropriate to their level of development.''
<p>
   ``Abstinence must always be the first message, but include with
that the information'' on birth control, she said.
<p>
   Fonda and James Wagoner, executive director of the international
group Advocates for Youth, appeared at a news conference to launch
a month-long ``Let's Talk'' campaign urging parents to talk to
their children frankly about issues important to their age group.
<p>
   Fonda said that next week she would join with Durex, an Atlanta
company that is the world's largest condom manufacturer, in a
campaign to alert the public about ``huge amounts'' of federal
money going to support abstinence-only education.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Wagoner, whose organization works to increase the opportunities
for youth to make healthy decisions about sexuality, said that
``the biggest threat that we face today in adolescent reproductive
health ... is political.''
<p>
   Saying that 75 percent of teenagers have had sex by the age of
18 and that 98 percent of Americans support sexual education in
schools, Wagoner claimed ``there's not a single, credible
peer-reviewed study that shows that abstinence-only works''
toprevent teen preegnancy.
<p>
   On the contrary, he said, extensive studies by the World Health
Organization show that programs promoting both postponement and
protected sex were more effective than abstinence-only programs.
<p>
   Wagoner urged the Clinton administration to protect reproductive
health services for teen schools and condom availability programs.
<p>
   Instead, of Congress ``hijacking'' adolescent reproductive
health policy and leading the public ``down the road of denial,''
Wagoner said, ``the political leadership needs to step up to the
plate and take advantage of the potential golden opportunity for
progress in the area.''

<p>
   PASADENA, Texas  &MD;  President Clinton asked Congress on Friday to
approve his educational proposals that would help low-income
Americans pay the costs of attending community colleges.
<p>
   The president, in remarks at San Jacinto Community College,
touted his plans for a $700 million increase in federal education
grants for low-income adults and for a $47.5 million program for
voluntary standardized tests for grade-school reading and math.
<p>
   Speaking in a gymnasium before a banner proclaiming that
community colleges are ``a gateway to the economy,'' Clinton said
his education proposals and the educational provisions in the
balanced budget package will enable the nation to say ``that we
have opened the doors of college to all Americans who are willing
to work for it.''
<p>
   Clinton's appearance at San Jacinto Community College was his
13th visit to a community college as part of his campaign to make
two years of community college education as universal as a high
school education. The proposal was a centerpiece of his Feb. 4
State of the Union address.
<p>
   Some 5.3 million credit-earning students attend 1,200 community
colleges across the nation. A community college graduate earns
almost $1.1 million over the course of a lifetime  &MD;  more than four
times the amount of an average American with a high school
education.
<p>
   The president compared access to two years of community college
to the 160-acre federal land grants awarded in the 19th century to
homesteaders, who agreed to live and farm the land for at least a
year.
<p>
   Clinton said the Pell grants that help low-income students
attend college will be the 21st century equivalent of land grants
in the 19th century.
<p>
   The onrushing global economy is now a ``knowledge economy'' in
which Americans ``know that what they know is their key to the
future  &MD;  not what they own,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   Clinton promoted additional government assistance for college
students two days after the College Board reported that tuition and
fees at four-year colleges had increased an average 5 percent this
year, although the over-all rate of inflation was below 3 percent.
<p>
   Clinton spoke as members of the House and Senate struggled to
resolve their disagreements on a $279 billion spending measure
designed to provide operating funds for the departments of
education, labor and health and human services for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1.
<p>
   Clinton wants the House-Senate conference committee to boost
funding for educational grants from $2,700 a year to $3,000 a year
to help more low-income adult students pay for college expenses
under the Pell grant program.
<p>
   The White House says 1.4 million community college students
would receive an average grant of $1,810 in the next academic year
if Congress approves the plan, at a total cost of $2.6 billion.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the White House's education legislation in the
Republican-led Congress got a boost when 43 Democratic senators
vowed to stage a Senate filibuster against any education measure
that didn't include Clinton's proposals. Under the rules of the
100-member Senate, 41 senators or more can prevent action on any
legislation.
<p>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
<p>
   Clinton also used his appearance to advertise the benefits of
the $1,500 ``Hope scholarship'' tax credit that he won in the
balanced budget accord with Congress. Some 5.8 million students at
two-year community colleges can begin benefiting from the credit in
January. It provides a maximum $1,500 tax credit for two years to
families with incomes less than $80,000.
<p>
   The White House said the tax credit pays 88 percent of the
national average in tuition costs at community colleges. The tax
credit is enough to cover the entire cost of community college
tuition in seven states  &MD;  Texas, California, Arizona, Hawaii,
Louisiana, New Mexico and North Carolina. It is enough to cover at
least 75 percent of the community college tuitions in 35 states,
the White House said.
<p>
   Another 7.1 million students who have returned to college to
upgrade their professional skills after completing two years of
higher education can obtain a 20 percent tax credit on the first
$5,000 in costs for tuition and fees.
<p>
   Later, Clinton planned to travel to Houston for a fund raiser
that was expected to raise $600,000 from 70 donors before returning
to Little Rock, Ark., for the weekend.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose with bonds on
a government report showing economic growth with little inflation.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. led the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 74.17,
or 1 percent, to 7922.18.
<p>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index gained 7.31, or 0.8 percent, to
945.22, led by banks and drug companies. Falling interest rates
boost demand for bank loans and make the assets they own more
attractive.
<p>
   Even after today's rise, the Dow average was little changed for
the week, up less than 5 points, and 4.1 percent below its Aug. 6
record. Any further gains depend on a bond market rally, investors
said.
<p>
   ``If the bond rally continues, I think stocks will hit new
highs,'' said Neil Hokanson, president of his own $75 million money
management firm in Encinitas, California.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent, about where it was on Monday. Two weeks
ago, the yield was 22 basis points higher at 6.59 percent.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.35, or 0.2 percent, to
1682.24, up less than 2 points for the week. Concern about slow
sales at Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Xilinx Inc. and other
specialty chipmakers kept the index from rising much today.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan rose 2 13/16 to 113 15/16, leading a bank rally.
Chase Manhattan Corp. gained 1 7/8 to 117 3/8 and First Chicago NBD
Corp. climbed 1 7/8 to 75 5/8.
<p>
   Among securities stocks, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. surged 3 1/16 to 73
5/16, Lehman Brothers Inc. gained 1 to 52 1/4 and A.G. Edwards Inc.
gained 1 9/16 to 49 3/4. Brokerages and investment banks have
jumped since Travelers Inc. said it would pay $9 billion in stock
for Salomon Brothers Inc. on Wednesday.
<p>
   Bond yields fell after the government said the economy grew at a
slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported, while
inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   Perhaps more than profits and interest rates, the strength of
the U.S. currency provides the best hint as to the path of stocks
in coming weeks and months, said Kenneth L. Fisher, president of
Fisher Investments in Woodside, California, with $1.7 billion in
assets.
<p>
   U.S. stocks attracted foreign investors in the past year as the
dollar rose 15 percent against the German mark, the benchmark
currency for Europe. The Dow industrials climbed 35 percent in that
period, rising in tandem with the dollar 60 percent of the time.
The dollar and the Dow both peaked Aug. 6, and have since declined.
<p>
   Signs that Europe's economy is accelerating would weaken the
dollar and may signal the end of the past few years of big gains in
U.S. stocks; the Dow doubled in a 31-month period.
<p>
   ``The explanation in the weeks ahead will come out of keeping an
eye on the dollar,'' Fisher said.
<p>
   Fisher said he is sticking with international U.S. companies
such as DuPont Co. and Merck &AMP; Co., which receive the bulk of
international investor funds. If he sees signs of growth oversees,
he would trim his U.S. holdings and would load up on non-U.S.
giants like Siemens AG and Sony Corp.
<p>
   Advancing shares outnumbered those that backtracked 1,720 to
1,085. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was 502.3 million
shares, in line with the three-month daily average.
<p>
   International drugmakers were a big hit with investors. Merck
gained 1 1/16 to 100 3/16, Pfizer Inc. rose 1 1/8 to 61 and
Warner-Lambert Co. rose 2 15/16 to 133 3/4.
<p>
   Initial offerings also made a splash, suggesting money managers
have plenty of funds to put to work.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications Inc. surged 6 1/4 to 23 1/4 in its first
day of trading as investors bet that the cachet of cellular pioneer
Craig McCaw will mean success for his new local phone company.
<p>
   Network Solutions Inc., which designates domain names for
Internet sites, jumped 5 5/16 to 23 5/16 in first-day trading.
<p>
   Lattice Semiconductor tumbled 4 7/8 to 64 1/2, leading a decline
in chipmakers as weak orders were seen hurting third-quarter
results. Xilinx dropped 1 5/16 to 50 and Altera Corp. fell 1 1/4 to
53 3/4.
<p>
   Investors said that while they expect most companies to deliver
strong earnings, the results may not have enough punch to drive
stocks higher.
<p>
   ``The chance that earnings are going to surprise significantly
would seem to be pretty slight,'' said Richard Cripps, chief
investment strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``We are without
some broad investment themes until we get a change in interest
rates.''
<p>
   A batch of companies dropped after reporting that the current
quarter's earnings may be weaker than expected.
<p>
   Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc., a maker of integrated circuits,
said third-quarter earnings and revenue may be about 10 percent
below the second quarter's. Benchmarq plunged 9 to 24 1/2.
<p>
   Bridgeport Machines Inc., a maker of metal-cutting tools, fell
1/2 to 11 after saying it could report a loss for the fiscal second
quarter ending tomorrow compared with a gain in the year-ago
period.
<p>
   Consolidated Papers Inc. fell 1 1/4 to 57 5/16 after it said
third-quarter earnings will be about 55 cents a share, far below
analyst estimates of as much as 85 cents.
<p>
   Kirby Corp., a marine-transport and diesel-repair company, said
third-quarter earnings and revenue will be lower than expected and
declined 3/4 to 19 7/16.
<p>
   Pluma Inc., a clothing company, fell 3 3/8 to 10 after warning
that it expects earnings to be about 50 percent to 60 percent less
than the year-ago 51 cents a share because of production and
shipment delays.
<p>
   Cymer Inc., a maker of computer chip factory equipment, fell 4
1/2 to 25 1/2 on renewed concern that its major customers are
suffering technical problems in building cutting-edge microchip
production tools that use Cymer's lasers. Cymer has fallen 44
percent in September.
<p>
   Eastman Kodak Co. rose 1 9/16 to 64 after announcing it will
fire about 10 percent of its clerical staff and 20 percent of its
managers in a move to boost profits.
<p>
   Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co. gained 2 5/8 to 90 7/16
after Cowen &AMP; Co. raised its investment opinion from ``neutral'' to
``strong buy,'' citing accelerating growth and improved margins.

   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Toronto Raptors re-signed
forward Reggie Slater to a two-year contract, eight months after
signing him to a 10-day contract.
<p>
   The 6-foot-7, 255-pound Slater averaged 7.8 points and 3.7
rebounds in 26 games with Toronto last season. He led the Raptors
with a .550 field goal percentage, after making 59 of his 108
shots.
<p>
   Slater, 27, signed a 10-day contract with the Raptors on Jan. 25
and was signed for the remainder of the regular season on Feb. 3.
<p>
   He had started the season with LaCrosse of the Continental
Basketball Association, where he averaged 22.7 points and 9.0
rebounds in 30 games.
<p>
   ``We will count on Reggie to fill a number of roles, including
scoring in the low post and working the glass on both ends of the
floor,'' Raptors Executive Vice President Isiah Thomas said.
<p>
   Slater has averaged 5.9 points and 1.9 rebounds in 58 games with
the Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, Dallas Mavericks and
Raptors over the past three seasons. He wasn't drafted by a
National Basketball Association team after playing at the
University of Wyoming.
<p>
   Financial terms of Slater's contract weren't disclosed.

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks rose on low
volume, led by utility and telephone stocks, amid optimism that
slower economic growth and lower bond yields in the U.S. will
stimulate equity investment in emerging markets, as well as the
U.S.
<p>
   ``When there's no news, the first thing that people look at is
what's going on in other markets,'' said Flavio Menezes, who
manages $350 million in equities at Banco Patrimonio de
Investimento SA in Sao Paulo. ``If stocks rise in the U.S., then
Brazil becomes cheap, and stocks here tend to move up too.''
<p>
   Sao Paulo's Bovespa index rose 149 points, or 1.08 percent, to
11518 points. For the week, the Bovespa fell 1 percent. The index
is up 8.7 percent in September and nearly 64 percent so far this
year.
<p>
   Telebras, Brazil's most actively traded stock, added 1.5 reais,
or 1.1 percent, to 138.2 reais, accounting for a third of the
index's rise.
<p>
   Trading volume was low. Shares worth about 433 million reais
($395 million) changed hands on the Sao Paulo exchange, roughly a
third of the daily average volume in June.
<p>
   ``The market's in a holding pattern,'' said Menezes. Investors
could break out of the holding pattern, he said, once the
government releases its game plan for the sale of Telebras and
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, the holding company for the
state-controlled utilities. Next week, Communications Minister
Sergio Motta is expected to unveil the model for the sale of the
Telebras system. That will revive investor interest and could usher
in a stock price rally, he said.
<p>
   The government is expected to group Telebras' 27 operating
companies into three or four regional phone companies before
selling the parts. Embratel, the long distance company, is expected
to be sold separately.
<p>
   Last week, Motta said the government would likely spin off
cellular telephone services and group them into nine regional
companies, coinciding with the concession areas for a competing
cellular service on a separate bandwidth for which the government
began selling licenses in June.
<p>
   Brazil hopes to raise an estimated 17 billion reais from the
sale of controlling stakes in Brazilian phone companies. Sales are
expected to get under way in the first half of 1998.
<p>
   Telebras, with a market capitalization of more than $40 billion,
is one of the largest telephone companies in the world, ranking
ahead of Deutsche Telekom and just behind British Telecom, which
has a total market capitalization of $42.9 billion.
<p>
   Caspian Securities analyst Joanne Showalter reiterated a ``buy''
recommendation on Telebras, setting a 1998 target price of $175 for
Telebras shares traded on the New York stock exchange. In New York,
Telebras shares rose 1 3/16 to 126 3/16.
<p>
   Other telephone stocks rose. Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo,
Telebras' largest regional subsidiary and Latin America's second
largest phone company after Telebras, rose 6 reais, or 1.9 percent,
to 321 reais. Telesp is expected to be the first of the Telebras
companies to be sold next year.
<p>
   Another Telebras subsidiary, Telecomunicacoes do Parana SA, the
Parana state operator, rose 15 reais, or 1.9 percent, to 805 reais.
Cia. Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes, which is controlled by the
Rio Grande do Sul state government, rose 2.1 reais, or 1.4 percent,
to 147 reais. Caspian Securities reiterated ``buy'' recommendations
on both Telepar and CRT.
<p>
   Utility stocks helped lift the Bovespa. The Bovespa electricity
index, which tracks the 13 most actively traded utility stocks rose
1.2 percent to 3243.2 points.
<p>
   Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, which accounts for 13 percent
of the country's electricity sales, was the biggest gainer among
utilities. Preferred shares rose 2.2 reais, or 3.9 percent, to 58.2
reais, while common shares rose 1.99 reais, or 4.15 percent, to
49.99 reais.
<p>
   The utility, which sold a 33 percent stake to a group led by AES
Corp. of the U.S. in May, was given a ``recommend list'' rating
this week by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the securities' firm's
highest rating.
<p>
   Patrimonio's Menezes favors Cemig because of the utility's
chances of expansion through acquisition. The company, which is
controlled by the Minas Gerais state government, created a separate
investment company called Cemigpar to participate in the
privatization of neighboring power companies, Menezes said.
<p>
   Advancers outnumbered decliners 36 to 6 among the 51 shares that
make up the Bovespa index. Nine shares were unchanged.
<p>
   Steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Paulista, or Cosipa, was the day's
biggest gainer, adding 4 centavos, or 7 percent to 61 centavos.
Banco Itau SA, Brazil's second-largest investor-owned bank,
registered the second biggest advance, rising 30 reais, or 4.7
percent, to 670 reais.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Rates on four-year fixed-rate
auto loans fell in the past week.
<p>
   The average loan rate was 9.36 percent, down 0.02 percentage
point from a week earlier, according to a weekly index released by
BanxQuote Inc., a Fairfield, New Jersey-based financial information
company.
<p>
   The average rate on three-year auto loans fell 0.02 percentage
point to 9.30 percent, while the rate on five-year loans fell 0.03
percentage point to 9.41 percent.
<p>
   Many auto loans are set above the prime rate banks charge their
best customers. The prime rate rises and falls with the rate the
Federal Reserve targets for overnight loans between banks. This
target rate was boosted by a quarter percentage point to 5.50
percent in March. Fed officials left the rate unchanged at meetings
in May, July and August. They next meet on Tuesday.

   WALL STREET
<p>
   Travelers to Buy Salomon In $9 Billion Stock Deal
<p>
   Travelers Group, a sprawling ensemble of financial services
companies, agreed to acquire Salomon Inc., the Wall Street
powerhouse that owns Salomon Brothers, for more than $9 billion in
stock.
<p>
   The deal was a crowning achievement for Sanford I. Weill,
Travelers' chairman. By combining Salomon, which is strong in
bonds, with its Smith Barney brokerage, Travelers will rival Wall
Street leaders like Merrill Lynch, American Express and Citicorp,
as well as the biggest financial firms in Europe and Japan.
<p>
   Warren E. Buffett, who controls almost 20 percent of Salomon,
will exchange his holding for a 3 percent stake in Travelers  &MD; 
still significant for so large a company. The deal is likely to
touch off another round of mergers among insurance concerns,
brokerage firms and commercial banks.
<p>
   THE ECONOMY
<p>
   First Fear, Then Hope
<p>
   Durable goods orders rose 2.7 percent last month, well above
analysts' expectations, to a record of nearly $186.6 billion, the
Commerce Department said. The increase, the third consecutive
monthly advance, reflected booming demand for electronic products.
<p>
   That report, combined with a report from the Labor Department
that jobless claims fell unexpectedly by 2,000 the previous week,
to a seasonally adjusted 306,000, renewed fears that the Federal
Reserve might push up interest rates to ward off inflation.
<p>
   But on Friday the Commerce Department reported that the economy
grew a bit more slowly in the second quarter than previously
estimated. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national
economic activity, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the
quarter, down from the 3.6 percent rate reported a month ago. The
new figure eased the fears of a rate increase.
<p>
   MARKETS
<p>
   Recovering From a Slide
<p>
   The slower economic growth, in turn, reinvigorated financial
markets. Bond prices were up, sending their yields lower. The
30-year Treasury bond ended the week at 100/32 to yield 6.36
percent, down 1 basis point. That helped stocks recover on Friday
from a three-day slide.
<p>
   The Nasdaq index hit a record high of 1,689.18, before ending
the week at 1,682.24, up 1.87 points. Propelled by a surge of 74.17
on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,922.18, up
4.91 points for the week. 
<p>
   COMPUTING
<p>
   IBM Holds the Chips
<p>
   IBM plans to make chips early next year that are 40 percent more
powerful than the most advanced chips now made commercially. The
computer maker said it had solved a fundamental problem, enabling
it to use microscopic copper wiring on silicon chips, instead of
the aluminum now used.
<p>
   The new process will also cut chip-making costs by 20 percent to
30 percent. Separately, Intel, which supplies the chips that are
the brains of 80 percent of the world's personal computers, said
the FTC was investigating whether it engaged in any practices that
would deter computer makers from using competitors' chips. Intel is
cooperating.
<p>
   But no matter who makes the chips, employers want to be sure
they are used for their benefit. Many are cracking down on
employees who use office PCs to play games or send personal
E-mail.
<p>
   PEOPLE
<p>
   Family Values Win
<p>
   Brenda Barnes resigned as president and chief executive of
Pepsi-Cola North America, citing family reasons. ``Every time you
would miss a child's birthday, or a school concert or a
parent-teacher discussion, you'd feel the tug,'' said Ms. Barnes,
who has three children, aged 10, 8 and 7.
<p>
   Pepsico, the parent company, named Philip A. Marineau, the
former Quaker Oats executive who was praised for the success of
Gatorade but held responsible for the decline of Snapple, to
replace her. He is quitting as president of Dean Foods. ... William
H. Joyce, chief executive of Union Carbide, made a seemingly heroic
gesture: If the company fails to earn $4 a share in 2000, he will
return his base salary. But some compensation experts were not
impressed.
<p>
   He'll be paid the salary, which amounts to only 20 percent of
total compensation, and if the earnings fall short of the target,
an amount equal to the salary will be deducted from other
compensation. ... Ron Carey, the teamsters president, asserted that
he was a victim, not a participant, in improper fund-raising. Three
top aides have pleaded guilty; he accused them of betrayal.

   CABLE TV
<p>
   The Rates Keep Climbing
<p>
   Cable television rates are spiraling upward, and two consumer
groups, the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union,
blamed the FCC, saying that it failed to keep a rein on an
aggressive industry.
<p>
   Cable rates have risen at three times the inflation rate since
the telecommunications law was passed in early 1996, the groups
said. They asked the commission to freeze rates and to overhaul its
formula for determining reasonable rates.
<p>
   TOBACCO
<p>
   Business Better Than Usual
<p>
   Tobacco industry profits could soar under terms of a legal
settlement proposed in June by 40 state attorneys general and
cigarette makers, according to a new analysis by the FTC. It said
the tobacco companies could reap as much as $123 billion in
additional profits in the next 25 years if the settlement plan were
adopted as drafted.
<p>
   It found that the real cost to industry would be about $207
billion, not the stated $368.5 billion value of the settlement. On
the other hand, a Stanford University economist, Jeremy I. Bulow,
calculated that the industry could easily live  &MD;  and conceivably
thrive  &MD;  with President Clinton's alternative plan, which calls for
raising cigarette prices as much as $1.50 a pack to discourage
teen-age smoking. 
<p>
   MORE DEALS
<p>
   Let Them Drink Sake
<p>
   Detroit once owned the road in America. That was before Honda,
Toyota, Subaru and Nissan claimed it. Now, Nomura, the Japanese
investment bank, is buying the pub chains Inntrepreneur and Spring
Inns for $1.9 billion, becoming Britain's largest independent pub
company ... Seagram agreed to pay Viacom $1.7 billion for the 50
percent of the cable programming service, USA Network, that it does
not already own, settling a nearly two-year-old feud ... B.F.
Goodrich agreed to acquire Rohr Inc., a maker of aircraft engine
parts, in a stock swap valued at $789 million.
<p>
   A week earlier a different deal for Rohr fell through. Goodrich
will also assume Rohr debt, bringing the deal's total value to $1.3
billion ... McKesson, leapfrogging past Cardinal Health to reclaim
its perch as the nation's biggest drug wholesaler, agreed to
acquire Amerisource Health for $1.72 billion in stock.
<p>
   McKesson will also assume $532 million in debt ... Shell Oil
agreed to buy Tejas Gas, a major natural-gas marketer and pipeline
operator, for $1.45 billion in cash. The deal will give Shell a
better position in the nation's rapidly deregulating markets for
natural gas and electricity.
<p>
   HEALTH CARE
<p>
   3 HMOs Back Regulation
<p>
   Three big health maintenance organizations joined two consumer
groups in calling for more regulation of managed health care,
saying that all health plans should be subject to ``legally
enforceable national standards.''
<p>
   Until now, HMOs had generally sought voluntary, not
governmental, standards. But three nonprofit HMOs with a total of
more than 10 million members  &MD;  Kaiser Permanente, based in
California; HIP Health Insurance Plans, based in New York, and the
Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, based in Seattle  &MD;  said
regulation was needed to restore the confidence of many patients.

<p>
   Ottawa, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Cognos Inc. shares rose 9%,
regaining some of the 32 percent drop that was triggered yesterday
when the software maker said growth will slow because customers may
delay purchases to consider buying rival programs.
<p>
   Cognos climbed C$2.80 (US$2) to C$33.30 in Toronto trading of
2.92 million shares, more than 31 times the three-month average of
92,400. Earlier, the shares reached C$34. On Nasdaq, the shares
rose 2 to 24 1/16.
<p>
   Cognos warned investors about ``moderate growth'' in the next
few quarters after the markets closed Wednesday as it reported
fiscal second-quarter profit jumped 47 percent.
<p>
   ``You can now buy a very good company with a very good product
line and an exceptional management group at 35 percent cheaper than
two days ago,'' said Richard Piotrowski, an analyst with Mesirow
Financial in Chicago.
<p>
   Although Cognos reported record profit, investors dumped the
shares amid concern the company's customers may switch to new
software that lets them access and analyze information via the
Internet instead of through corporate networks.
<p>
   After the market for the type of software made by Cognos
stabilizes, Piotrowski said Cognos will emerge in a strong position
because it has a strong product portfolio and brand equity with
executives who purchase technology for corporations.
<p>
   Cognos's two main programs, PowerPlay and Impromptu, are used by
salesmen and managers to analyze information by category,
geographical region or price. The company's rivals include
Paris-based Business Objects SA and Redwood Shores,
California-based Oracle Corp.
<p>
   Analysts were looking for Cognos's revenue in the fiscal third
and fourth quarters to increase about 30 percent. Instead, the
company said it expects sales to rise 20 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
   Cognos said its fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed to US$11
million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31, from
US$7.5 million, or 16 cents, in the year-earlier period. Revenue
rose 26 percent to US$58 million from US$46.1 million. Cognos
reports in U.S. dollars.
<p>
   ``We will have strong profit and strong positive cash flow,''
said Alan Rottenberg, head of marketing and business strategy with
Cognos. ``All the underlying fundamentals of our business are still
very strong.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- When they sit down Tuesday
to pore over the latest data on the U.S. economy next week, Federal
Reserve policymakers are expected to decide to leave interest rates
unchanged. Three days later they'll turn their attention to a
report that will yield further clues on the economy's momentum.
<p>
   Friday, the Labor Department will release the September jobs
report. It's expected to show a drop in the unemployment rate to
4.8 percent as the economy added 336,000 jobs, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. If that proves to be the
case, September job growth would be more than six times August's
strike-depressed total of 49,000 and more than the average monthly
gain of 226,000 of the first eight months of the year.
<p>
   And if the report is accompanied by evidence that workers'
hourly wages climbed much more than the expected 0.4 percent, ``it
clearly raises the odds'' the Fed will push up the overnight bank
lending rate in November, said Tokai Bank chief economist Tim
McGee. Central bankers meet twice more before the end of the year,
on Nov. 12 and Dec. 16.
<p>
   ``Next week's reports will help the Fed decide whether they can
afford to leave the economy on autopilot or they need to do
something before the end of the year,'' McGee said. ``They're
looking at an economy that's quite strong and they're likely to act
if they see signs that the labor and manufacturing sectors are
strained.''
<p>
   A closely watched measure of factory output, the National
Association of Purchasing Management's index, will show Wednesday
whether manufacturers saw their business continue to expand in
September. The index will probably show little change, according to
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News, sliding to 56.2 from August's
56.8.
<p>
   Still, that reading would point to continued expansion of
factory activity, after a surge in August production that pushed
the Fed's own measure of the amount of factory capacity in use up
to 83.9 percent, the highest level since September 1995.
<p>
   Fed policymakers raised the federal funds rate on overnight bank
loans by a quarter point to 5.50 percent in March but took no
further action at its May, July and August meetings.
<p>
   The Fed cited ``persisting strength in demand'' as the reason
for its March rate increase, and central bankers will get a fresh
read on the condition of consumer pocketbooks Monday when the
Commerce Department releases a report on personal income and
spending for August. The report is expected to show Americans
earned 0.6 percent more in August than in July while they spent 0.4
percent more than a month earlier.
<p>
   A larger-than-expected gain in incomes would suggest that
consumers, refreshed after a spring spending pause and confident
about their ability to find jobs, may feel the temptation to spend
their extra money in the months ahead and propel the economy beyond
its non-inflationary boundaries, analysts said.
<p>
   Evidence that spending will continue to rise is already
trickling in. For example, factory orders for electronics rose 28
percent in August, suggesting ``consumers don't have enough VCRs
and other such electronic goods,'' said Anthony Chan, chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.
``Those aren't really household necessities, so they tell me
consumers are in the mood to buy.''
<p>
   Consumers are also taking advantage of low interest rates to
refinance their mortgages. Last week, the rate on a 30-year fixed
mortgage fell to 7.28 percent, the lowest level in almost two
years. In response to falling rates, the Mortgage Bankers'
Association index of mortgage refinancings rose 40 percent to 699.6
last week. ``When refinancing goes up, people take the money and
they spend it,'' Chan said.
<p>
   Lower borrowing costs bode well for the housing market, even
though analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Commerce
Department to report Thursday a drop of 1.3 percent in new home
sales in August. Some analysts say sales fell because consumers
aren't finding the houses they want on the market.
<p>
   ``The inventory of unsold homes is at a 25-year low and until
homebuilding picks up, tight supply conditions are likely to keep a
lid on sales of newly built properties,'' said Morgan Stanley
economist David Greenlaw. Date Time Indicator BN Survey Prior 9/29

<p>
   Claremont, North Carolina, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- WSMP Inc.
agreed to acquire steakhouse chain Sagebrush Inc. in a stock swap
valued at $40.4 million to boost the profitability of its
restaurant operations.
<p>
   Under terms of the agreement. WSMP will issue 0.3214 share for
each share of Sagebrush, valuing Sagebrush at about $6.60 a share
based on today's closing prices.
<p>
   The proposed acquisition is subject to approval by Sagebrush
shareholders and directors.
<p>
   Sagebrush shares rose 11/16 to 6 3/8, and WSMP rose 1/2 to 20
1/2.
<p>
   WSMP said the combined company will have annual revenue of about
$175 million. Both companies are based in Claremont, North
Carolina.
<p>
   WSMP is hoping the merger will help improve its restaurant
operations, which have not been performing as well as its other
businesses in baking and ham-curing, and Sagebrush restaurants have
been rather profitable, said Noland Mewborn, chief financial
officer of Sagebrush.
<p>
   After the merger, WSMP will operate 112 Texas-style steakhouse
restaurants, including Western Steer Steaks, Prime Sirloin Buffet,
Sagebrush Steakhouse &AMP; Saloon and Bennett's Smokehouse &AMP; Saloon.
<p>
   A timetable for completion of the transaction hasn't been set.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Treasuries rallied Friday as the Federal Reserve
entered the market as a buyer and a revised figure for gross
domestic product in the second quarter showed the economy growing
at a slower pace than previously reported.
<p>
   Trading was choppy with the shorter maturities outperforming the
longer issues. By late in the day, the 30-year bond had gained
13/32 to 100 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction
of the price, dropped to 6.36 percent from 6.39 percent on
Thursday.
<p>
   The Commerce Department gave its final estimate of
second-quarter growth at 3.3 percent, down from the previous
estimate of 3.6 percent. Another positive for the market was the
University of Michigan's sentiment index for September, which
showed a decrease to 106.0 from a preliminary reading of 106.8 made
in midmonth.
<p>
   ``In a market that continues to be dominated by a healthy dose
of positive sentiment, the GDP report represented pretty good news
because of the small downward revision,'' said Anthony Chan, vice
president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors
Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
<p>
   Reviewing the consumer index data, Chan said, ``the decline of
the overall figures for September from the midmonth reading was
very constructive for the market.'' He explained that ``they seemed
to imply that consumption may not grow faster in the fourth quarter
compared to the possibility of 3 to 3.25 percent consumption growth
in the third quarter.''
<p>
   Doug Burtnick, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data of
Boston, noted some good flows among the shorter maturities, but
said the market ran into trouble trading up from lofty price
levels.
<p>
   What sustained the market Friday? Burtnick thought it might have
been the purchases from small investors as they bought heavily in
the short maturities, through the five-year note. ``There was also
some pretty good central bank buying, in the form of a coupon pass,
in both the two-year and three-year maturities,'' he said.
<p>
   In its coupon pass, the Fed bought $1.7 billion in securities
maturing in two to five years, from September 1999 through August
2002. The coupon pass adds money permanently to the banking system,
but does not signal any change in the central bank's monetary
policy.
<p>
   ``Although the Fed meets on Tuesday,'' Chan of Banc One said,
``it is quite clear that the current benign inflationary outlook is
unlikely to permit policy makers to alter their current unchanged
policy course.
<p>
   ``However, if labor markets become even firmer and inflation
begins to reveal any signs of reincarnation, I would not be
surprised if they moved to conduct one more insurance tightening as
early as the November meeting.''
<p>
   Thus, the featured economic data next week will be the monthly
employment report, scheduled for Friday.

 &UR; U.S. SOFTWARE COMPANIES ACCUSE THE IRS OF STEALING TAX PROGRAMS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. software companies
accused the Internal Revenue Service today of ripping off the tax
software it sells to corporate clients.
<p>
   The Software Publishers Association, which represents software
giants Microsoft Corp., Adobe Systems Inc., Netscape Communication
Corp. and others, said the IRS is taking the computer programs that
one corporation uses to file its taxes and using it to improve the
way it checks other corporate returns.
<p>
   They said that the IRS wants to use the data behind the
programs, known as source code. IRS officials say they need the
information to ensure that companies are preparing their taxes
correctly.
<p>
   ``The IRS wants our software and is using the audits of our
corporate customers to try and get it,'' Stephen Winn, the
president of Computer Language Research Inc., told the House Ways
and Means Committee today. ``They want to be able to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of their auditing process by
confiscating software,'' said Winn, who was testifying on behalf of
the Software Publishers Association.
<p>
   Officials at the IRS say they haven't stolen anything. They said
they need access to software to understand the complicated paths
companies, particularly multinational corporations, take to pay
their federal taxes.
<p>
   ``It's absolutely not true,'' said Jodi Patterson, a spokeswoman
for the IRS. ``We need the source code (software) in order to be
able to verify the returns.''
<p>
   The dispute is part of a larger debate over whether corporate
and individual tax-payers need new protections. Over the last three
days, IRS employees and taxpayers have accused the agency of
ignoring federal laws and abusing U.S. citizens in the name of tax
collection, in hearings sponsored by the Senate Finance Committee.
<p>
   The hearings have focused national attention on the troubled
agency, virtually ensuring that Congress will take some steps to
reform the IRS in the next year. Congress could add additional
protections, known as taxpayer rights, to legislation designed to
improve IRS operations.
<p>
   Corporations, including software companies, are also hoping
Congress will cut the interest rate companies pay on their IRS
debts as part of any IRS reform effort.
<p>
   Today, the federal government pays one interest rate when it
owes a corporation a tax refund, while it imposes a higher rate on
corporations when they owe taxes. Corporate tax lawyers want the
government to charge the same rate for both payments, or at least
take steps to lessen the disparity.
<p>
   They have found some support among lawmakers. Equalizing the
rates ``is an issue of fairness,'' said Minnesota Republican Rep.
Jim Ramstad.
<p>
   The National Commission on Restructuring the IRS has unveiled a
plan that would balance the two rates.
<p>
   The Treasury Department is willing to address the issue, but it
has stopped short of endorsing eliminating the difference,
according to Donald Lubick, acting assistant secretary for tax
policy at the Treasury Department.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Asher Edelman said he'll
pursue an effort to buy Societe du Louvre SA, even though the hotel
operator's majority shareholder and another holder made a pact to
scuttle his bid.
<p>
   The Taittinger family, which owns 53 percent of Louvre's voting
shares through its Taittinger SA champagne company, and the Peugeot
family agreed to give each other first refusal if either decided to
sell their shares.
<p>
   The Peugeots' Fonciere Financiere et de Participations, owns
about 3 percent of Louvre's voting shares.
<p>
   ``There are family members who would like to realize the value
of their Louvre holdings,'' said Edelman, who made a 310 French
franc ($51.7) offer in July.
<p>
   Shares of Louvre, which owns the Le Crillon hotel in Paris,
crystal glassware maker Baccarat and Annick Goutal, a perfume
maker, rose 0.8 franc to 306 francs Thursday. A recent report by
Societe Generale SA estimates the net asset value of the company at
430 francs a share.
<p>
   Edelman who owns about 5 percent of the company's voting shares,
said he talked to family members who are unhappy with the share
price. He declined to say how many voting shares those members
controlled.
<p>
   ``Claude and company are running a bit scared,'' said Guy
Wyser-Pratte, another holder, referring to Claude Taittinger,
executive director of the champagne producer. ``As in most
families, there is not total solidarity.''
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte and French investment company Verneuil Finance
together own 6.5 percent of Taittinger. ``Taittinger is ignoring
the needs of some of his less liquid family members,'' he said.
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte plans to buy more shares of Taittinger because they
are vastly undervalued, he said. The shares, which trade today at
3,200 francs, rose as high as 5,860 francs in May, 1990.

<p>
   At least the dead man didn't breathe, and there were no ``Three
Stooges'' collisions as the docs raced into the trauma room. Maybe
there should have been. The live ``ER'' on Thursday was something
the show has never been before and isn't likely to be again:
terminally dull.
<p>
   That flatness came from a hackneyed script (by Carol Flint, one
of the executive producers) and a cowardly premise devised to cover
any gaffes. The episode's conceit was that a PBS documentary crew
was taping a day in the emergency room.
<p>
   ``So this is like faux cinema verite,'' David Letterman said
helpfully two weeks ago when Noah Wyle (who plays the eager young
doctor, John Carter) explained the idea.
<p>
   Worse than that, the much-hyped season premiere was fake ``ER,''
a huge disappointment to its audience. As television's top-rated
show, ``ER'' has an average audience of 35 million; nearly 10
million more are estimated to have watched Thursday night's
episode. That audience has been watching days in the life of ``ER''
for three years and can probably even say ``myocardial
infarction.''
<p>
   What was the point of shooting ``ER for Dummies''?
<p>
   The point, of course, was to provide a safety net. The fake
documentary allowed for shaky hand-held cameras and offered cover
for many potential flaws, including stiffness from the actors. They
seemed more awkward in the first performance, beamed to the East
Coast, than in the second, done again for the West. It was
obviously the character of Dr. Morgenstern, not the actor William
H. Macy, who felt skittish in front of the documentary camera. In
other cases, who's to say?
<p>
   But the documentary approach pulled the episode back from its
genuine ambition. More than historical distance separates this
``ER'' from the early days of live television. In the 1950s,
cameras were planted on a soundstage and live broadcasts preserved
the feel of watching a stage production. ``ER'' is defined by its
zooming camera work, quick editing, in-your-face drama. To present
that live is the equivalent of a rock band performing a hit onstage
that was created, with great technical complexity, in the studio.
It probably can't be done, but the audience expects a sincere try.
<p>
   The show's usual quickness and smoothness were there. (In the
West Coast version, an HIV-positive patient who is meant to
threaten the staff with a syringe drops it before he can; that was
the only conspicuous blunder in either broadcast.) That ease was
gained at the cost of the immediacy so crucial to the series. There
were no personal aspects of the story; Doug and Carol (George
Clooney and Julianna Margulies) weren't about to start groping each
other in front of the PBS crew. As the fake documentarians filmed
through glass doors and kept a respectful distance from the action,
viewers felt unnaturally detached. (It's easy to sense the lack of
close-ups even when you're not conscious of it.) When Morgenstern
apparently has a heart attack, the blinds on the trauma room's
glass door are coyly pulled shut.
<p>
   The script was self-indulgent and jokey. Were viewers waiting
for mistakes? The episode built them in. Carol spills milk in both
versions. In both, Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben) stumbled over the
word ``respiratory'' and asks the fake film crew if she should
start over.
<p>
   Only at the end was there a glimpse of the real ``ER.'' In
scenes from the next episode, Doug and Carol are in bed. Mark
Greene (Anthony Edwards) is stressed out, driving and smoking. It's
taped television, a happy return to the '90s.

   Detroit, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Michigan stocks fell for the
week, led by General Motors Corp. and Herman Miller Inc.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Michigan Index declined 0.37, or 0.21 percent, to
176.39 for the week. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index fell
5.29, or 0.56 percent, to 945.22. For the day, the Michigan Index
rose 0.83, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose 7.31.
<p>
   Earlier in the week, companies warned of lower than expected
earnings for the current quarter. Economic reports released
Thursday, however, indicated a healthy economy. Orders for durable
goods rose 2.7 percent in August, more than the 0.5 percent
forecast, and first-time unemployment claims fell by 2,000, down
for the third week in a row.
<p>
   Among Michigan movers, GM fell 3 9/16 to 66 for the week. U.S.
automakers expect September sales to fall 2 percent from the
year-ago month. GM shares rose 7/8 to 66 on Friday.
<p>
   Zeeland-based Herman Miller shares fell 3 3/8 to 52 3/4 for the
week. On Friday, the furniture maker stock rose 11/16 to 52 3/4.
Herman Miller shares have more than doubled from its 52-week low of
19 13/16 set a year ago.
<p>
   Also declining in the week were cereal maker Kellogg Co. which
lost 2 1/8 to 42 13/16, and household product maker Dow Chemical
Co., which fell 1 15/16 to 90 7/16. The Midland-based company said
it agreed to buy the assets of the disk drive components division
of VisPro Corp. of Beaverton, Oregon.
<p>
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. both declined during the week.
Ford lost 1 1/4 to 43 15/16. Chrysler fell 9/16 to 37 5/16, after
hitting a 52-week high of 38 9/16 on Monday. On Friday, Ford
dropped 1/16, while Chrysler rose 3/16.
<p>
   Southfield-based Lear Corp. was one of the week's biggest
gainers. The auto and truck seatmaker rose 2 5/16 to 50 1/8, a
52-week high. On Friday, Lear stock gained 1 1/2. The Bloomberg
Michigan Index is a price-weighted list of 107 stocks with a base
of 100 on Dec. 30, 1994. It's up 27.53 percent this year, while the
S&AMP;P 500 is up 27.60 percent.

<p>
   Denver, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- New Century Energies Inc. is
seeking partners to build a transmission line costing as much as
$254 million to link its two utilities' electric systems in the
U.S. Southwest.
<p>
   New Century was created in August when Public Service Co. of
Colorado completed its $2.1 billion buyout of Southwestern Public
Service Co. Public Service serves the Denver area. Southwestern
provides electricity to parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Kansas. The Denver area is served by the network of transmission
lines known as the U.S. western grid. Southwestern Public Service's
customers are served by the U.S. eastern grid. New Century's
planned transmission line will allow it to send power from one grid
to the other, increasing its opportunities for electricity sales
and lowering the cost of producing electricity for its 1.6 million
power customers.
<p>
   ``They're sort of like highways. You can't move electricity
without transmission lines, so the more you put in place, the more
you increase the opportunities for commerce,'' said Bill Crenshaw,
a spokesman for New Century Energies.
<p>
   The route for the new transmission line has not been determined.
The company is studying 17 possible. It will solicit proposals from
potential partners for the project until Oct. 31, the company said.
<p>
   If built, the line would be the seventh link between the
country's western and eastern power grids, the company said. The
lack of connections between the two grids has kept the two markets
from easily sharing electricity with each other.
<p>
   The Denver-based company wants to send power back and forth
between its systems to help the company realize some of the
estimated $770 million savings from the acquisition, the company
said. Because its subsidiaries can have access to each other's
power, the company says it won't have to build a generating plant
as soon as it would have otherwise, and they can more easily tap
the cheapest power sources in their system during peak demand
periods.
<p>
   New Century's shares rose 7/16 to 41 1/4.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  No one wants to rain on Wall Street's parade.
Particularly not when the parade is being led by the Travelers
Group's Sanford I. Weill, one of the most widely admired executives
in the securities business.
<p>
   But as merger fever sweeps the Street  &MD;  Travelers' $9 billion
deal to buy Salomon being just the latest outbreak  &MD;  there is a
certain feeling of unease among some old-timers (and some who are
not so old). It's a sense that they've been there, done that  &MD;  and
rued the day.
<p>
   Remember when Prudential bought Bache? When Sears bought Dean
Witter? When American Express bought Shearson  &MD;  and Lehman and
Hutton? Remember what glorious successes those deals, all struck in
the early 1980s, turned out to be?
<p>
   Pru still owns its securities business, but it paid more than a
billion dollars to settle a scandal over limited partnerships.
Sears sold Dean Witter to the public. American Express sold
Shearson/Hutton to Weill for a bargain price, and had to pump
millions into Lehman before spinning it off.
<p>
   It was thanks to such deals that claims of ``new synergies''
became almost as scary as the phrase now echoing down Wall Street:
``It's different this time.''
<p>
   Of course, it always is. Merger mavens argue that financial
markets are booming around the world, and playing in those markets
indeed may require more heft on the part of financial services
companies  &MD;  heft they have little choice but to buy.
<p>
   And unlike deals of the 80s, acquisitions today are not being
financed with debt, but with stock. For companies like Travelers,
whose stock has soared from $5 to $70 a share in the last decade,
that can make an acquisition seem low risk, not to mention cheap.
<p>
   Finally, some of the buyers are different this time. To be sure,
Travelers, like Pru, is an insurance company, but it already has a
substantial securities business through Smith Barney, which caters
to the amateur investors Wall Street calls retail.
<p>
   (In fact, Weill is taking the somewhat contrarian tack of buying
an investment bank at a time when most investment banks are
desperately seeking retail distribution.)
<p>
   Most of the big buyers these days, however, are banks like
Fleet, Nationsbank, and Bankers Trust. Some experts, like William
Freund of Pace University's Center for the Study of Equity Markets,
predict that brokerage-firm marriages with banks will work better
than those with insurance companies a decade ago.
<p>
   But banks have been in the retail securities business before,
with unfortunate results for small investors, who bought stock in
companies that used the cash to repay banks  &MD;  and promptly went
bankrupt. That is one reason Congress in 1933 enacted the law known
as Glass-Steagall, which separated commercial and investment banks.
<p>
   Back then, problems emerged when the stock market sank; the
retail brokerage business becomes unattractive when markets are
rotten, as many firms found in the 1970s. And tough times make it
especially hard to manage firms that try to cater to both big
institutions and small investors, as investment bankers, traders
and brokers fight over scarce profits.
<p>
   These lessons may have been lost on Wall Street, which ``has
been lulled by the long bull market.'' said Richard H. Jenrette, a
founder of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and eventual chairman of
the Equitable, which bought and then spun off the securities firm.
<p>
   Even in the best of times, he argues, firms find it almost
impossible to serve both the mass market and high-end institutional
clients, which is the goal of new behemoths like Morgan Stanley,
Dean Witter Discover  &MD;  and will be of the new Travelers.
<p>
   Jenrette, who recently wrote a book called ``The Contrarian
Manager'' (McGraw-Hill), said he was reluctant to play Cassandra.
But, he added, ``I have never ceased to marvel at the way everyone
on Wall Street runs in a herd.''

<p>
   Denver, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Colorado stocks rose for a fifth
consecutive week, led by Ciber Inc. and DII Group Inc.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Colorado Stock Index, a price-weighted list of
companies with operations in the region, rose 2.88, or 1.87 percent
for the week, to a record 157.02. The state index posted a gain of
1.05 today.
<p>
   Gainers outnumbered losing issues 66 to 40 for the week.
<p>
   Ciber rose 4 15/16, or almost 12 percent, for the week to 47 1/2
after touching a record high 48 1/2 earlier today. The provider of
information systems solutions finished the week with a gain 2 3/16.
<p>
   Ciber announced two new contracts to provide Year 2000 solutions
earlier in the week. Additionally, UBS Securities Inc. analyst
Moshe Katri said the company should see revenue rise by 45 percent
to $78 million for the fiscal first quarter, which ends Sept. 30.
<p>
   Ciber has been shifting its operations from information
technology staffing to more lucrative, higher value-added services,
and as a result, its operating margins for the quarter should
improve to 10.9 percent from 8.6 percent, Katri said. He expects
the company to earn 24 cents a share.
<p>
   A survey of four analysts showed a 25-cent average earnings
estimate, IBES International Inc. reported.
<p>
   Other advancing issues for the week included DII Group, which
rose 3 3/8 to 30; Newmont Mining Corp., which rose 2 15/16 to 43;
and K N Energy Inc., which rose 2 1/2 to 45 7/8.
<p>
   Decliners for the week were led by OEA Inc., which said capital
spending for the expansion of its Aurora manufacturing operation
cost it 6 cents a share, prompting it to miss analysts' earnings
estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended July 31.
<p>
   OEA reported its profit rose 55 percent to $10.4 million, or 51
cents a share, from the $6.71 million or 33 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 32 percent to $60.3 million from $45.6 million.
<p>
   OEA had been expected to earn 58 cents, four analysts told IBES.
The shares fell 4 3/8 to 34 3/4 for the week.
<p>
   Other losing issues included UAL Corp., which fell 3 7/8 to 84;
Mail Well Inc., which fell 3 11/16 to 27; and Napro Biotherapeutics
Corp., which fell 2 to 8 7/8.
<p>
   In the broader market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index fell
5.29, or 0.56 percent, for the week, closing at 945.22. The index
ended the week with a gain of 7.31, or 0.78 percent, today.
<p>
   The Colorado Stock Index was developed with a base value of 100
as of Dec. 30, 1994. The state index has gained 15.15 percent this
year, compared with a 27.60 percent gain for the S&AMP;P 500.

<p>
   LAREDO, Texas  &MD;  A retired Seventh-day Adventist pastor who is
accused of ethnic genocide in Rwanda remains in custody here as
authorities try to decide whether to extradite the elderly man to
stand trial before an international tribunal.
<p>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 74, was arrested by FBI agents a year
on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. He is accused
of taking part in a massacre of civilians during internecine
fighting that broke out in Rwanda in 1994.
<p>
   A U.N. tribunal based in Tanzania charges that in April 1994,
Ntakirutimana led attackers armed with machetes, grenades and guns
in a murderous rampage of hundreds of people who had fled to the
protection of his church compound.
<p>
   But Ntakirutimana's children and lawyers said he is a man of the
cloth who never has hurt anyone and is being persecuted by members
of Rwanda's new government who resented his power as the elected
head of the 265,000-member Seventh-day Adventist Church in the
Central African nation.
<p>
   ``He never believed they would put him in jail, and keep him in
jail, when he's innocent,'' said his son, Dr. Eliel Ntakirutimana,
who is an American citizen.
<p>
   The elder Ntakirutimana has been behind bars at the Webb County
Jail while his lawyers try to prevent his extradition to the U.N.
war crimes tribunal in Tanzania.
<p>
   In early 1994, fighting between ethnic Tutsis and Hutus in
Rwanda led to the deaths of an estimated 500,000 people  &MD;  many of
them Tutsis  &MD;  and the exodus of as many as 2 million more from the
central African nation. Ethnic tension continues to simmer in the
country.
<p>
   Ntakirutimana is hospitalized with worsening stomach and
respiratory problems. The room at Laredo's Mercy Regional Medical
Center, where he has been for two weeks, is guarded. A
leather-bound Bible is at is side.
<p>
   Jail officials declined to allow him to be interviewed.
<p>
   But his son, an anesthesiologist, did not hesitate.
<p>
   ``At first it was difficult,'' he said of working in the same
hospital where his father is in custody.
<p>
   ``At least if something happens to him here, I'll know right
away,'' he said. ``If they take him back to jail, he'll die
there.''
<p>
   The legal debate has pitted the U.S. Department of Justice
against former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is
representing Ntakirutimana.
<p>
   At issue is whether U.S. authorities should hand the man over to
the U.N. war crimes tribunal and the legal power of treaties
between this country and the United Nations.
<p>
   U.S. Magistrate Marcel Notzon has given attorneys on both camps
until Sunday to file written arguments on a host of issues in the
case, including whether the United States is bound by every
resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council.
<p>
   Should the pastor be handed over, he would face charges that
carry penalties of up to life in prison, a spokesman for the
tribunal said by telephone from Tanzania.
<p>
   ``Absolutely, we are certain we will have him,'' the spokesman
said. ``I can't discuss where we are in the negotiation process at
this point.''
<p>
   But Clark has no plans to back off from a case he considers of
``enormous importance'' for legal and moral reasons.
<p>
   ``Obviously, we want him out (of custody). This has been quite a
physical hardship on a man his age,'' Clark said by telephone from
his New York office.
<p>
   ``This is a very political case; the struggle goes on,'' he
said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   During a preliminary hearing on Ntakirutimana's detention last
October, Assistant U.S. Attorney Don De Gabrielle said: ``He's
accused of the most serious crime a man can be accused of  &MD; 
genocide.
<p>
   ``I don't doubt witnesses will come forward and say, `This is a
good man,' but I assure the court that other witnesses will come
and say this man ordered the wholesale slaughter of hundreds of
people in Rwanda,'' De Gabrielle said.
<p>
   Among the court documents is a sworn statement from a Dutch
investigator for the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda.
<p>
   The investigator tells of a witness who allegedly hid under a
pile of corpses to stay alive as he watched the pastor and other
attackers fire weapons.
<p>
   ``Kill them all!'' the witness quoted the pastor as saying.
<p>
   ``There were numerous heinous acts of killing, torture and
incitement of ethnically motivated hatred and violence,'' according
to the investigator's statement.
<p>
   Ntakirutimana's son said the Dutch investigator has been misled
by translators employed by the Rwandan government. ``He doesn't
even speak the language,'' the son said. ``I'm sure if the CIA or
the FBI would do their homework, they would find out what the truth
is.''

<p>
   SAGAPONACK, N.Y.  &MD;  Pumpkins are on the vine, tables are
available at Bobby Van's, and Kurt Vonnegut, 74, the novelist who
has lived long enough to see himself enter the canon, is soaking up
the September glory of the off-season Hamptons. ``Who wouldn't?''
he says, his arm sweeping toward the glistening waves and nearly
deserted sands of Sagg Main Beach. ``This is Winslow Homer.''
<p>
   Vonnegut, for two decades part of the crowded summer literary
landscape of Long Island's South Fork, has reason to be in a good
mood. He has at last finished ``Timequake,'' his 19th and, he
insists, last book. His overwhelming emotion is relief.
<p>
   ``This is just sort of a coda on my career,'' he says.
``Self-indulgent, really. But my God, I finished it. It's like
being in the marathon. I finished 211th. But I finished.''
<p>
   Now, he can look back on a 45-year career and see that his
satire, black humor and pacifist perspective will stand. Once a
voice of the 1960s, Vonnegut these days is taught far more
extensively in high schools and colleges around the world than
contemporaries like Norman Mailer and John Updike. He is a literary
figure offered up like Mark Twain, an author rediscovered by every
generation of teen-agers. There are Cliffs Notes on Vonnegut's
major works and a 693-page compendium called ``The Vonnegut
Encyclopedia.'' All of Vonnegut's books are still in print, from
the 1952 ``Player Piano'' (initially ignored) to the 1969
``Slaughterhouse-Five'' (his great critical and commercial success,
about the Allied bombing of Dresden) through the 1990 ``Hocus
Pocus'' (mixed reception). Despite Vonnegut's own dismissive
assessment, ``Timequake,'' a novel-memoir, is getting good reviews.
<p>
   But life as a living classic is not what it might seem. Vonnegut
may live half the year in Sagaponack, among one of America's
greatest concentrations of writers and dinner-party-goers (he
spends the other half in Manhattan), but he leaves most of the
socializing to his wife, the photographer Jill Krementz. Vonnegut
appears at a book party here and there, far less a social presence
than a literary one, and readily says that he still fights
depression.
<p>
   ``It can come at any time,'' he says. ``The proper attitude is,
this thing is not your friend.'' He sulks, oddly, that ``critics,
English majors and products of prep schools'' do not take him
seriously, and he remains bitter about his early treatment as an
author.
<p>
   ``I was categorized as a science-fiction writer for pimply
17-year-old boys,'' he grouses.
<p>
   Friends describe Vonnegut as an unpretentious, decent and
generous son of Indianapolis, an author who looks out for younger
writers. The novelist Jay McInerney once called him, in the same
sentence, ``a satirist with a heart,'' ``a cynic who wants to
believe'' and ``a moralist with a whoopee cushion.'' Outside the
pages of his books, Vonnegut, not surprisingly, has a dry,
self-deprecating wit.
<p>
   ``Jill and I went on a cruise this summer,'' he says, driving
away from the beach toward Bridgehampton for lunch. ``We were
celebrity guests, and nobody had ever quite heard of us.'' He
chuckles, recalling the junket through the Mediterranean with some
``very old retired Brits'' who were more interested in the other
celebrity cruisers. ``There was a woman lecturing on all the things
you could do with a scarf,'' Vonnegut says. ``Then everybody left
that and went to hear the British soap opera star.''
<p>
   He pulls in behind Bobby Van's, the once-fabled literary hangout
turned raucous young renters' haven, enters through the back door,
and is shown a table open to the traffic-jam-less street. The crowd
seems to be made up largely of local merchants enjoying the quiet.
<p>
   Vonnegut sits, studies the menu, then grows appreciably less
talkative. Perhaps he is tired of holding forth on his literary
career, or perhaps he is focusing on the choice of grilled chicken.
<p>
   Does he feel unappreciated as a writer?
<p>
   ``No, not at all,'' he says, agreeably. ``I  &UR; am
 &LR; unappreciated.'' He smiles wanly, his leathered face with
mischievous and tired eyes topped by a tousled head of hair. He
looks younger than 74, although he smokes constantly and without
apology. (``Oh, please,'' he says after lunch. ``My father smoked
like me, and he died at the age of 72.'')
<p>
   In Vonnegut's view, he has done quite well to live as long as he
has. ``People my age are usually dead,'' he says. He says he thinks
often about death. Friends like Truman Capote, James Jones and
Irwin Shaw have all died, as have most of the people who were
prisoners with Vonnegut in Dresden during World War II, the
inspiration for ``Slaughterhouse-Five.'' His brother, Bernard  &MD;  a
``beloved, sweet, funny, highly intelligent old geezer,'' as
Vonnegut writes in ``Timequake''  &MD;  died this April. ``So it gets
kind of lonesome,'' he says.
<p>
   Writing ``Timequake,'' Vonnegut says, was awful. It started out
as fiction, the story of a dysfunctional universe that suddenly
contracts, from the year 2001 to 1991, and then marches forward,
forcing everyone to live the decade all over again. Several years
ago, when the book was nearly done and scheduled for publication by
Putnam, Vonnegut decided, as he says, that ``it was a piece of junk
and I wasn't going to end up that way.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   He tossed out huge chunks of it, then added autobiography and
personal musings that, however disjointed, will be poetry to
die-hard Vonnegut fans. The author, in ``Timequake,'' on women: ``I
know what women want. They want a whole lot of people to talk to.''
On his creative-writing students: ``I told my students that when
they were writing they should be good dates on blind dates, should
show strangers good times.'' He also brought back his alter ego,
the science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, to converse with
throughout.
<p>
   Now that his literary career is over, or so he says, Vonnegut
wants to spend more time working on his new love, silk screens, and
answering his blizzard of mail. He has a 13-year-old daughter with
Ms. Krementz, Lily, three grown children from his first marriage,
and three other grown children he adopted after his sister, Alice
Adams, and her husband died.
<p>
   ``Allie's husband, Jim Adams, really did go off an open
drawbridge in a railroad train two days before Allie died in a
hospital,'' he writes in ``Timequake.'' ``Stranger than fiction!''
<p>
   Vonnegut's legal residence is his 1749 Sagaponack saltbox, but
he also spends time at his East Side apartment. He uses an old
electric Smith-Corona, keeping computers at a distasteful distance,
especially since what was purported to be his commencement speech
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bounced around on the
Internet this summer.
<p>
   ``Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of 1997: Wear sunscreen,''
the speech began. Vonnegut never spoke at MIT, but it parodied his
distinctive voice and attitude so well that even his wife was
pleased with the speech enough to send it to family and friends.
<p>
   Technology, Vonnegut says, is creating ``people who are being
cheated out of life as human beings.'' He adds that ``when I was a
kid in Indiana, there were people with very poor complexions and
not very popular who spent all their time in the attic or in the
basement. And these were ham radio operators. And they'd say  &MD;  can
you believe it  &MD;  `I've got a friend in Nome, Alaska.'''
<p>
   His younger readers, he says, have changed. ``I used to be able
to use history as an echo chamber when I wrote, and know that
readers would respond emotionally, like Waterloo or the
assassination of Lincoln,'' he says. ``But the past is no longer an
echo chamber for writers, because the audience lives immediately in
the present. Now, the clues are about all kinds of actors and
actresses and TV I never watch and rock bands and sitcoms I've
never heard of.''
<p>
   But the author of ``Cat's Cradle,'' the 1963 novel about the end
of the world, remains, through all the pessimism, a humanist. When
he speaks at colleges across the country, he tells his new
generation of readers that they should stop thinking about
appearing on ``Seinfeld'' or playing with the Chicago Bulls.
Instead, he tells them to ``think locally.''
<p>
   ``Put on a play for a local audience,'' he says. ``Write poetry
for someone you like. Serve your community and be content with your
success within it.''
<p>
   Advice, he might add, that he himself does not always take. ``I
would rather have been Joe Namath,'' he says as he finishes up
lunch.
<p>
   But back at his saltbox, smoking again, he finally acknowledges
that over all, yes, it has been a good life.
<p>
   ``Sure,'' he says. ``And compared to most people, I won big.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Heating oil could fall in
coming days on expectations that large U.S. inventories will be
sufficient to meet demand for the home heating season.
<p>
   This week, raw materials prices, as measured by the Commodity
Research Bureau index, rose 2.0, or 0.8 percent, to 242.72. The
energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index ended the week 8.64,
or 4.4 percent, higher at 203.88. Heating oil futures rallied 8.4
percent this week as the first cool weather in the key U.S.
Northeast heating oil market encouraged buying by traders and
speculators.
<p>
   U.S. inventories of distillate fuels held by major oil companies
exceed year-ago levels by 22.2 million barrels, or 20 percent,
though, according to the American Petroleum Institute, and home
heating oil inventories alone are 31 percent higher than a year
ago.
<p>
   ``Fundamentally there's no reason to see heating oil higher,
there's so much oil that people are running out of storage
facilities,'' said Abe Glass, a trader at Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg in
New York. ``We've never been this over-supplied. There are more
than 20 million more barrels of distillates than a year ago --
that's a lot of oil.''
<p>
   For the week, heating oil for October delivery rose 4.47 cents,
or 8.4 percent to 57.92 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The gain helped lift November crude oil $1.34 or 6.9
percent this week to $20.87 a barrel.
<p>
   Cocoa prices fell amid speculation that crops in West Africa, in
the early stages of harvest, were less damaged than expected by dry
weather.
<p>
   Last year, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower,
produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa. Estimates for this
year's harvest range as low as 850,000 tons on expectations that
unusually dry weather damaged the crop.
<p>
   Now, recent rain is leading traders to revise their forecasts.
Because the bulk of harvesting won't take place until November, the
moisture will have time to reinvigorate the crop. ``There was
really dry weather along the Ivory Coast during September, but for
most of the summer, temperatures were close to normal, and that may
mean that less of the crop was damaged and should come in close to
about 1 million tons,'' said Walter Spilka, a commodity analyst at
Smith Barney Inc. in New York. ``We could see cocoa beans smaller
when the harvest comes in, and they'll have to put more beans in
bags to meet the yields.'' Cocoa for December delivery rose $19, or
1 percent, this week to $1,668 a metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange.
<p>
   In other growing regions, including Indonesia, weather
conditions remain dry, escalating concern that global cocoa
harvests will be low.
<p>
   Hog futures are expected to be little changed next week after
the government confirmed expectations that the U.S. hog herd rose
from a year earlier as lower feeding costs encouraged expansion.
<p>
   In a quarterly inventory report, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said there were 60.250 million hogs and pigs on the nation's farms
on Sept. 1, up 4 percent from the 58.20 million head at the same
time last year. The report was close to trade expectations for a
3.6 percent increase to 60.3 million head, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.
<p>
   The cost of corn, the main feed ingredient, averaged $2.58 a
bushel during the three-month period ended Aug. 31, compared with
$4.06 a bushel in the same period a year earlier. Pork producers
also are looking ahead to a projected 9.27 billion bushel corn
harvest, fourth largest ever, ensuring stable supplies and moderate
feeding costs.
<p>
   ``Looking at where we've been trading and where the average
guesses were, this is about as neutral as they come,'' said Don
Roose, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,
Iowa. ``The trade has already factored in the fact that we're going
to have some expansion so we're not going to see much of a move
based on this report.''
<p>
   Hog futures fell 0.4 cent, or 0.6 percent, to 69.25 cents a
pound this week on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. October hogs
fell 3.6 percent since the end of May amid expectations for herd
expansion, analysts said.
<p>
   Corn could rise in the week ahead as the higher hog herd points
to larger domestic demand for feedgrain. Corn for December delivery
this week lost 4.25 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.575 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
<p>
   Wheat could slide if Egypt purchases French wheat over U.S.
supplies. Egypt's chief wheat buyer said he hasn't decided whether
to buy U.S. wheat or cheaper grain offered by France.
<p>
   Egypt, one of the world's biggest wheat importers, has canceled
three out of five tenders for the grain since Sept. 4 because
prices are too high, said Samir El Shakankiri, the state wheat
buyer.
<p>
   ``I would not like to cancel again,'' Shakankiri said. U.S.
sellers ``must submit reasonable and competitive prices, and so far
what I have been offered for French wheat is better,'' he said.
Shakankiri declined to provide details.
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery on the CBOT this week lost 10.25
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $3.5725 a bushel, its lowest since July
21.

 &UR; TRUTH BEHIND NAZI ESCAPES &QL;  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; James HILL &QL;  &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The Arizona Republic &LR;  &QC; 
   (undated) - One rarely hears anything these days about the
``ratlines,'' the escape routes that big-time Nazis down to
small-time collaborators used - often with the assistance of
officials believed to be acting on behalf of their Western
governments - to cheat the hangman and spend the rest of their
bloodstained lives in Latin America, Australia and sometimes the
United States or Canada.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The literature documenting the existence of the ratlines could
fill a good-size library. Still, the trail toward accountability
always runs cold when researchers hit the stone wall of official
secrecy that continues more than 50 years after the end of World
War II. Archives remain locked around the world that could offer up
conclusive evidence as to why Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the
Holocaust; Josef Mengele, the Auschwitz ``Angel of Death''; Klaus
Barbie, the ``butcher of Lyon''; Franz Stangle, the commandant of
the Treblinka death camp; and Ante Pavelic, the dictator of the
Nazi puppet state in Croatia, to name a few, could so easily find
their ways to freedom.
<p>
   Switzerland's belated disclosure this year that its banks still
held dormant accounts belonging to Holocaust victims might force
the ratline issue open again. Among the 1,800 names, several were
believed to be those of Nazis or their collaborators. As Rabbi
Marvin Heir, dean and founder of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, said last week, the Swiss are now prepared to
freeze the suspicious accounts and ``not allow heirs to make
claims, pending an official investigation depending on the roles of
these people in the Third Reich.''
<p>
   Presumably, some of those funds could have been earmarked for
the ratlines.
<p>
   I had called Rabbi Hier after reading a fascinating Page One
story in the New York Times about a commission in Brazil and its
efforts to track down money and other valuables looted from Jews
and other Holocaust victims, then cached for use by Nazis as they
settled into their new lives. Rabbi Hier had been mentioned in the
Times story as describing the preferred routes of escape and what
Holocaust historians claim to be the complicity on the part of the
International Red Cross and the Vatican in facilitating the Nazis'
departures.
<p>
   I wondered whether Rabbi Hier might see some connection between
this and another disclosure made about the time the Swiss list was
being released: that a U.S. Treasury Department document from 1946
maintains that the Vatican had held more than 200 million Swiss
francs (about $170 million in today's dollars) for the Ustashi
movement, which ran the Croatian Nazi puppet state, after the
Ustashis were forced on the run by Hitler's defeat. (As Rabbi Hier
noted, the Ustashis were particularly cruel, more savage than even
Hitler's SS, slaughtering Jews, Serbs and Gypsies with impunity.)
<p>
   Rabbi Hier assured me there was, that the Simon Wiesenthal
Center had already made inquires of the Vatican and was continuing
to push the issue, including voicing its opposition to Israel's
recent recognition of the new Croatia that has emerged out of
former Yugoslavia.
<p>
   The problem, though, as he so clearly pointed out, was the
continued stone wall: ``Without the Vatican allowing us in (to its
archives), and without the Croatian government opening its files,
it is going to be very hard to get to the bottom of this.''
<p>
   President Clinton has promised to do just that as part of the
U.S. government's ongoing review of what happened to the funds
looted from Holocaust victims, but his administration has one
glaring problem when it comes to Croatia: It got in bed with the
ultranationalist President Franjo Tudjman several times before it
struck the Dayton accords ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
putting U.S. troops in the Balkans as part of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's peacekeeping force. How much it would push
the Zagreb government now on the Vatican connection is a matter
that can only be left to speculation.
<p>
   For its part, the Vatican insists that there is no basis for the
Ustashi money story (although I found an incident, possibly the
same, possibly another, described in a 1991 work, Unholy Trinity,
by a former U.S. Justice Department Nazi hunter, John Loftus, and
an Australian journalist, Mark Aarons, with sources listed as the
Ante Pavelic file obtained under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act). The Holy See's response to reports of complicity in the
ratlines has been to say that if priests and other church
officials, including Bishop Alois Hudal and Msgr. Giovanni Battista
Montini (who was to become Pope Paul VI) did help Nazis and other
collaborators escape, it was for reasons of Christian charity. And
another note needs to be added: Much disinformation still swirls
around actions in the immediate aftermath of World War II, some of
it by confusion, some because of the Cold War standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, and some because of deliberate
attempts to distort history.
<p>
   Like the Swiss stonewalling, which finally was broken this year,
the lack of answers is wearing thin on people such as Rabbi Hier,
who have devoted lifetimes in trying to bring the perpetrators of
the worst genocide in history to justice. Rabbi Hier sees only one
way in which the truth might finally come out: the London
conference scheduled for November in which all claimant nations to
the Swiss accounts will be represented.
<p>
   ``I think at that meeting we will have the last opportunity to
push all the states, and especially the Vatican, to open their
archives,'' Rabbi Hier said. ``We're not talking about church
matters, such as how a bishop got to be a bishop. We're simply
looking into the Nazi relationship with the Vatican. If the U.S.
secretary of State would announce that we are going to open our
archives, that would put pressure on all the others.''
<p>
   And war's first casualty - the truth  &MD;  might just have a chance
of resuscitation, whatever the consequences.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Singer Bonnie Raitt knew exactly what she was doing
this week as she patiently shook hands with dozens of starry-eyed
congressional staffers in the halls of the U.S. Capitol.
<p>
   Raitt especially knew what she was doing when she joined fellow
singing artists the Indigo Girls and Jackson Browne on a podium in
front of a simulated cask of nuclear waste and faced rows of
reporters and photographers.
<p>
   ``Frankly, if we weren't sitting up here, you guys probably
wouldn't be here,'' Raitt said.
<p>
   The reporters shifted uncomfortably, but they knew it; Raitt
knew it, and the members of Congress know it: nothing works like
celebrity to bring attention to an issue, especially one as
seemingly distant as the movement of nuclear waste from New England
to a dusty corner of Texas.
<p>
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry
Bonilla, R-Texas, whose congressional district includes the tiny
West Texas town of Sierra Blanca  &MD;  whose name has become synonymous
with the site where the waste would be moved.
<p>
   Bonilla led a successful effort to defeat the waste agreement in
the last session of Congress. Now, with another vote expected
within the next six weeks, Bonilla welcomed the additional protests
from singers like Raitt and Browne.
<p>
   ``It draws attention to the issue for people who haven't given
it a lot of thought before,'' he said. ``I don't know everything
that's going on about toxic waste in other members' districts. I
wouldn't expect other members of Congress to know about everything
that's going on in my district ... so anything we can do to get
attention helps.''
<p>
   For Raitt, that meant the news conference and handshakes and two
benefit concerts in Washington during the past week, followed by a
news conference Saturday in Austin with U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas, and a concert Sunday at the Backyard to benefit the Sierra
Blanca Legal Defense Fund.
<p>
   Doggett has joined with Bonilla to battle an agreement that has
the blessing of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, and
current Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican whom Bonilla calls ``a
dear friend.''
<p>
   The deal that is dividing friends and political allies would
allow the movement of low-level radioactive waste from Maine and
Vermont to Hudspeth County, Texas, about 16 miles from the Rio
Grande. Supporters contend the site is safe; opponents say it is on
a fault line that could shift and spill radioactive waste in the
river.
<p>
   The site ``is about as far from Travis County as you can get and
still be in Texas, but I have ... almost 2,000 people from Austin
who have contacted me on this issue,'' Doggett said. ``There is
concern about the environmental consequences of locating this in an
earthquake zone on the edge of the Rio Grande and in an area where
many of those most affected don't have the economic or political
power to make their voices known effectively ... ''
<p>
   Doggett, too, applauded the involvement of Raitt and other
``people who have such tremendous talent ... (and) match it with
their commitment to social and economic justice.''
<p>
   Raitt acknowledged that her biggest contribution is her
celebrity and that she was unlikely to change the minds of any
members of Congress who support the Texas waste agreement.
<p>
   ``Most of my talking has been congratulating people'' who work
on the issue day-to-day, Raitt said in an interview.
<p>
   For some, her presence at the Capitol this week raised a basic
question: ``Who is she?'' asked House Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey, R-Texas, who has quoted country singer Jerry Jeff Walker and
disco queen Donna Summers during news conferences.
<p>
   Raitt didn't meet Armey this week, but she spent time with
Doggett and other opponents of the Sierra Blanca plan  &MD;  and a lot
of time with reporters.
<p>
   ``I'm really here to be a town crier,'' Raitt said Wednesday in
Washington. ``It's a function that artists and musicians have been
since the early days when there weren't any newspapers.''
<p>
   Raitt has been donating concert time to the anti-nuclear power
movement for almost 20 years. She was a founding member  &MD;  with
Browne and Graham Nash  &MD;  of Musicians United for Safe Energy and a
featured performer at the group's concerts at New York's Madison
Square Garden in the late 1970s.
<p>
   But Raitt said her distaste for nuclear power began when she was
a schoolgirl, prompted by her upbringing in an activist Quaker
family and her meeting with eight women who survived the atomic
bomb that leveled Hiroshima, Japan.
<p>
   At school, she said, ``I refused to participate in the bomb
drills and got sent to the principal's office.''
<p>
   Raitt's current protest is taking her to stages in Texas,
California and Nevada  &MD;  all proposed sites for nuclear-waste
storage facilities. The message that she and other musicians are
spreading is that transporting waste to those sites will needlessly
expose millions of U.S. residents to radioactivity.
<p>
   Preparing to sing a duet Wednesday night in Washington with
Browne, Raitt looked over her shoulder at the ``No Nukes'' sign
hanging above the stage at the Warner Theatre.
<p>
   ``We've done a lot of concerts under that sign,'' she said.
``I'm kind of embarrassed that we're still having to use it.''

<p>
   Toronto, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks closed mixed,
with gains in Canadian Pacific Ltd. and oil issues tempered by
declining gold producers.
<p>
   Gold issues, which account for 6.8 percent of the benchmark
index, held back the broader market's advance after bullion fell
from its highest price in more than a month on weak demand for
jewelry, particularly in Japan and Southeast Asia.
<p>
   Gold for December delivery fell US$0.50 to US$329 an ounce on
the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex Division.
<p>
   The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 0.16 to
6975.88. Toronto is the second largest North American exchange in
terms of both volume and value.
<p>
   ``We had a rally in the last two-days in gold bullion, but it
looks like it has lost its legs and in the short term we see no
serious rebound in either bullion or the shares of producers,''
said Andre Chabot, a vice-president of Magna Vista Capital
Management Inc., which has C$890 million (US$641 million) in
assets.
<p>
   Placer Dome Inc. fell C$0.30 to C$24.40, Barrick Gold Corp. slid
C$0.35 to C$32.55 and TVX Gold Corp. dropped C$0.20 to C$7.50 paced
the sub-group's fall.
<p>
   Paper stocks like Avenor Inc., down C$0.80 to C$25.05, fell as
lumber for November delivery declined US$7.70 to US$298.60 a metric
ton on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   Investors were also cautious ahead of a Federal Reserve policy
meeting on Tuesday when interest rates may be raised, analysts
said. Canada is directly affected by any U.S. economic change
because the countries are each other's largest trading partners.
<p>
   ``It's a mixed bag as the gold sector has backed off and
investors are taking some profits on financial-services stocks, but
there is really nothing that stands out,'' said Fred Ketchen, a
senior trader with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. ``The market is marking time
ahead of Tuesday's meeting and some people are concerned the Fed
will raise rates.''
<p>
   Any rise in interest rates by the Fed may be matched by the Bank
of Canada to keep the currency competitive. Ranger Oil Ltd. and
Elan Energy Inc. were among the most active after Ranger said it
purchased 490,000 common shares of Elan at an average price of
C$9.90 a share. Elan gained C$0.25 to C$10.20 and it was the most
actively traded stock on 5.2 million shares, while Ranger rose
C$0.40 to C$12.65 on 1.88 million shares.
<p>
   Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. lost C$0.10 to C$13 on 4.17 mllion
shares traded after it said it will price an initial public
offering of its Gulf Indonesia Resources Ltd. subsidiary on Monday,
then list the shares the next day on the New York Stock Exchange.
Canadian Pacific Ltd. rose C$0.50 to C$41 to help offset decliners.
<p>
   ``There is a general optimism around the stock and when an
international investor wants to buy a piece of Canada, CP is one of
the stocks he buys,'' said Steve Bokor, a portfolio manager with
Majendie Charlton Securities Ltd.
<p>
   Canadian Pacific, which accounts for 2.6 percent of the
benchmark index, has interests ranging from rail and shipping to
energy.
<p>
   Cognos Inc. rose C$2.80 to C$33.30 on 2.9 million shares traded
after falling 32 percent yesterday when the software maker warned
growth will slow because customers are delaying purchases.
<p>

    &UR; RAITT NO STRANGER TO ADDING HER CELEBRITY TO `NO NUKES' CAUSE

    &UR; By CHRISTI HARLAN &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Singer Bonnie Raitt knew exactly what she was doing
this week as she patiently shook hands with dozens of starry-eyed
congressional staffers in the halls of the U.S. Capitol.
<p>
   Raitt especially knew what she was doing when she joined fellow
singing artists the Indigo Girls and Jackson Browne on a podium in
front of a simulated cask of nuclear waste and faced rows of
reporters and photographers.
<p>
   ``Frankly, if we weren't sitting up here, you guys probably
wouldn't be here,'' Raitt said.
<p>
   The reporters shifted uncomfortably, but they knew it; Raitt
knew it, and the members of Congress know it: nothing works like
celebrity to bring attention to an issue, especially one as
seemingly distant as the movement of nuclear waste from New England
to a dusty corner of Texas.
<p>
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry
Bonilla, R-Texas, whose congressional district includes the tiny
West Texas town of Sierra Blanca  &MD;  whose name has become synonymous
with the site where the waste would be moved.
<p>
   Bonilla led a successful effort to defeat the waste agreement in
the last session of Congress. Now, with another vote expected
within the next six weeks, Bonilla welcomed the additional protests
from singers like Raitt and Browne.
<p>
   ``It draws attention to the issue for people who haven't given
it a lot of thought before,'' he said. ``I don't know everything
that's going on about toxic waste in other members' districts. I
wouldn't expect other members of Congress to know about everything
that's going on in my district ... so anything we can do to get
attention helps.''
<p>
   For Raitt, that meant the news conference and handshakes and two
benefit concerts in Washington during the past week, followed by a
news conference Saturday in Austin with U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas, and a concert Sunday at the Backyard to benefit the Sierra
Blanca Legal Defense Fund.
<p>
   Doggett has joined with Bonilla to battle an agreement that has
the blessing of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, and
current Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican whom Bonilla calls ``a
dear friend.''
<p>
   The deal that is dividing friends and political allies would
allow the movement of low-level radioactive waste from Maine and
Vermont to Hudspeth County, Texas, about 16 miles from the Rio
Grande. Supporters contend the site is safe; opponents say it is on
a fault line that could shift and spill radioactive waste in the
river.
<p>
   The site ``is about as far from Travis County as you can get and
still be in Texas, but I have ... almost 2,000 people from Austin
who have contacted me on this issue,'' Doggett said. ``There is
concern about the environmental consequences of locating this in an
earthquake zone on the edge of the Rio Grande and in an area where
many of those most affected don't have the economic or political
power to make their voices known effectively ... ''
<p>
   Doggett, too, applauded the involvement of Raitt and other
``people who have such tremendous talent ... (and) match it with
their commitment to social and economic justice.''
<p>
   Raitt acknowledged that her biggest contribution is her
celebrity and that she was unlikely to change the minds of any
members of Congress who support the Texas waste agreement.
<p>
   ``Most of my talking has been congratulating people'' who work
on the issue day-to-day, Raitt said in an interview.
<p>
   For some, her presence at the Capitol this week raised a basic
question: ``Who is she?'' asked House Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey, R-Texas, who has quoted country singer Jerry Jeff Walker and
disco queen Donna Summers during news conferences.
<p>
   Raitt didn't meet Armey this week, but she spent time with
Doggett and other opponents of the Sierra Blanca plan  &MD;  and a lot
of time with reporters.
<p>
   ``I'm really here to be a town crier,'' Raitt said Wednesday in
Washington. ``It's a function that artists and musicians have been
since the early days when there weren't any newspapers.''
<p>
   Raitt has been donating concert time to the anti-nuclear power
movement for almost 20 years. She was a founding member  &MD;  with
Browne and Graham Nash  &MD;  of Musicians United for Safe Energy and a
featured performer at the group's concerts at New York's Madison
Square Garden in the late 1970s.
<p>
   But Raitt said her distaste for nuclear power began when she was
a schoolgirl, prompted by her upbringing in an activist Quaker
family and her meeting with eight women who survived the atomic
bomb that leveled Hiroshima, Japan.
<p>
   At school, she said, ``I refused to participate in the bomb
drills and got sent to the principal's office.''
<p>
   Raitt's current protest is taking her to stages in Texas,
California and Nevada  &MD;  all proposed sites for nuclear-waste
storage facilities. The message that she and other musicians are
spreading is that transporting waste to those sites will needlessly
expose millions of U.S. residents to radioactivity.
<p>
   Preparing to sing a duet Wednesday night in Washington with
Browne, Raitt looked over her shoulder at the ``No Nukes'' sign
hanging above the stage at the Warner Theatre.
<p>
   ``We've done a lot of concerts under that sign,'' she said.
``I'm kind of embarrassed that we're still having to use it.''

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds rose, rounding out
a third week of gains, after the government said the economy grew
at a slower pace in the second quarter than previously reported
while inflation remained subdued.
<p>
   The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a
3.3 percent annual rate, down from an earlier estimate of 3.6
percent and below the average forecast of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.
<p>
   ``The GDP results are positive for the bond market; it makes it
look like growth isn't that strong,'' said Ken Anderson, who
oversees $7 billion at Evergreen Asset Management Corp., in
Purchase, New York. Robust growth can fuel inflation, which eats
away at the value of bonds' fixed payments.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds gained 1/2, or $5 per $1,000
bond, to 100 1/8, pushing the yield down 4 basis points to 6.36
percent. The two-year note yield fell 4 basis points to 5.78
percent.
<p>
   Bonds are poised for a third straight quarter of positive
returns, according to an index of bonds maturing in more than one
year compiled by Bloomberg Analytics. With two trading days of the
third quarter remaining, Treasuries have paid investors about 3.2
percent, the fourth-best performing market in the world.
<p>
   The government today also said the price deflator, a measure of
inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual pace in the second quarter,
the smallest rise since the second quarter of last year.
<p>
   Analysts had forecast a 1.5 percent rise in the deflator, which
measures both the magnitude of price increases and detects whether
higher costs drive consumers away from a product.
<p>
   ``Inflation is at such an extraordinary level that the slightly
higher revision isn't a problem,'' said Susan Hering, chief
economist at Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   Bonds got a further boost when the Federal Reserve bought $1.655
billion of Treasury securities maturing in two- to five years to
add money permanently to the banking system. The so-called coupon
pass doesn't signal any change in interest-rate policy, economists
said.
<p>
   To be sure, some investors fret that inflation may eventually
pick up unless the economy slows. Bonds yesterday posted their
biggest drop in almost eight weeks after reports on durable goods
orders, home sales and jobless claims showed strength, keeping
alive concern the Fed might raise bank lending rates for a second
time this year to ward off inflation.
<p>
   ``The Fed should be clear that this level of above-potential
growth is not sustainable,'', said Elizabeth Miller, who helps
manage about $500 million of bonds at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP;
Jacobsen Inc.
<p>
   ``I feel the Fed will eventually have to step in'' and raise
borrowing rates at least once more, Miller said. She's waiting for
yields on longer-term bonds to rise before buying.
<p>
   With inflation quiescent there's little expectation that a Fed
move, if it comes at all, will occur at its policy meeting Tuesday.
The central bankers last increased the target for the overnight
lending rate between banks on March 25, by a quarter point to 5.5
percent.
<p>
   ``We're still fairly positive on the outlook for the bond market
in the U.S.'' because of the prospects for slow inflation, said Rod
Davidson, who helps oversee $1 billion of fixed-income securities
at Murray Johnstone in Glasgow, Scotland.
<p>
   The government last week said that consumer prices rose at a 1.6
percent annual pace in the first eight months of the year, the
slowest since 1986.
<p>
   Now traders are turning their attention to next week, when
reports on consumer confidence, manufacturing and jobs will provide
more clues to the economy's strength.
<p>
   Friday the Labor Department will release a report on employment
and wages for September. The report is likely to show the economy
added 336,000 non-farm jobs, up from 49,000 in August, according to
the average forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
jobless rate will probably drop 0.1 percentage point to match the
23-year low of 4.8 percent seen in May and July.
<p>
   Optimism about the prospects for slow inflation can be seen in
the slim yield premium that investors are willing to accept for
30-year bonds, compared with two-year notes. The difference, or
yield spread, is 58 basis points. It reached a more than 2 1/2 year
low on Wednesday.
<p>
   ``It's just the best of all possible worlds -- the way the
American economy is running, our long-bond yields are way too
high,'' said Tom Carpenter, who manages some $6 billion in assets
at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C.
<p>
   Carpenter, who has bought long-dated Treasuries betting yields
will head lower, said the yield curve will flatten more as the
low-inflation story drives down 30-year bond yields.
<p>
   A narrow difference between short- and long-term rates could
also spur more mortgage investors to pile into Treasuries, driving
yields lower. That's because a flatter yield curve cuts the profits
for Wall Street firms who buy longer-term mortgage securities and
repackage them into shorter-term collateralized mortgage
obligations.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications Inc. and World Access Inc. led five
companies that raised a combined $1.2 billion today in the
corporate bond market.
<p>
   Some $38.6 billion of corporate bonds have been sold so far this
month, according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, New Jersey, with
investment-grade corporate bonds weighing in with $27.5 billion.
<p>
   Corporate bonds have weathered the influx of supply because the
economy continues to show strength without inflation, leading to
optimism that companies will be able to repay their debts. Even
though ``we're seeing a little earnings weakness,'' it's not
widespread enough to affect corporate credit quality, said Kevin
McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income at Dreyfus Corp.
<p>
   The spread, or the gap in yield between corporate bonds and
Treasuries, was unchanged yesterday, said traders.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- When they sit down Tuesday
to pore over the latest data on the U.S. economy next week, Federal
Reserve policymakers are expected to decide to leave interest rates
unchanged. Three days later they'll turn their attention to a
report that will yield further clues on the economy's momentum.
<p>
   Friday, the Labor Department will release the September jobs
report. It's expected to show a drop in the unemployment rate to
4.8 percent as the economy added 336,000 jobs, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. If that proves to be the
case, September job growth would be more than six times August's
strike-depressed total of 49,000 and more than the average monthly
gain of 226,000 of the first eight months of the year.
<p>
   And if the report is accompanied by evidence that workers'
hourly wages climbed much more than the expected 0.4 percent, ``it
clearly raises the odds'' the Fed will push up the overnight bank
lending rate in November, said Tokai Bank chief economist Tim
McGee. Central bankers meet twice more before the end of the year,
on Nov. 12 and Dec. 16.
<p>
   ``Next week's reports will help the Fed decide whether they can
afford to leave the economy on autopilot or they need to do
something before the end of the year,'' McGee said. ``They're
looking at an economy that's quite strong and they're likely to act
if they see signs that the labor and manufacturing sectors are
strained.''
<p>
   A closely watched measure of factory output, the National
Association of Purchasing Management's index, should show Wednesday
that manufacturers saw their business continue to expand in
September, after a surge in August production that pushed the Fed's
own measure of the amount of factory capacity in use up to 83.9
percent, the highest level since September 1995.
<p>
   The NAPM September index itself will probably show little
change, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News, sliding
to 56.2 from August's 56.8. However, a reading above 50 points to
continued expansion of factory activity.
<p>
   Fed policymakers raised the federal funds rate on overnight bank
loans by a quarter point to 5.50 percent in March but took no
further action at the May, July and August meetings.
<p>
   The Fed cited ``persisting strength in demand'' as the reason
for its March rate increase, and central bankers will get a fresh
read on the condition of consumer pocketbooks Monday when the
Commerce Department releases a report on personal income and
spending for August. The report is expected to show Americans
earned 0.6 percent more in August than in July while they spent 0.4
percent more than a month earlier.
<p>
   A larger-than-expected gain in incomes would suggest that
consumers, refreshed after a spring spending pause and confident
about their ability to find jobs, may feel the temptation to spend
their extra money in the months ahead and propel the economy beyond
its non-inflationary boundaries, analysts said.
<p>
   Evidence that spending will continue to rise is already
trickling in. For example, factory orders for electronics rose 28
percent in August, suggesting ``consumers don't have enough VCRs
and other such electronic goods,'' said Anthony Chan, chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.
``Those aren't really household necessities, so they tell me
consumers are in the mood to buy.''
<p>
   Consumers are also taking advantage of low interest rates to
refinance their mortgages. Last week, the rate on a 30-year fixed
mortgage fell to 7.28 percent, the lowest level in almost two
years. In response to falling rates, the Mortgage Bankers'
Association index of mortgage refinancings rose 40 percent to 699.6
last week. ``When refinancing goes up, people take the money and
they spend it,'' Chan said.
<p>
   Lower borrowing costs bode well for the housing market, even
though analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Commerce
Department to report Thursday a drop of 1.3 percent in new home
sales in August. Some analysts say sales fell because consumers
aren't finding the houses they want on the market.
<p>
   ``The inventory of unsold homes is at a 25-year low and until
homebuilding picks up, tight supply conditions are likely to keep a
lid on sales of newly built properties,'' said Morgan Stanley
economist David Greenlaw. Date Time Indicator BN Survey Prior 9/29

 &UR; SENATE BEGINS FIGHT ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; By ANDREW MOLLISON &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Senate took up campaign finance reform Friday
with partisan pot shots and a bipartisan response that reflected
the opposing sides' strategies.
<p>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who is very skeptical of
restrictions on raising political funds, said the debate was
opening ``against a background of lurid exposes'' of fund-raising
abuses by President Clinton, who had threatened to call the Senate
into special session if it failed to vote on reforms before
adjourning this fall.
<p>
   Noting puckishly that the Democratic National Committee hoped to
raise $600,000 from a dinner addressed by Clinton late Friday in
Houston, Lott asked, ``What is he saying, `Stop me before I do it
again?' ''
<p>
   ``This is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem,''
responded Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who favors much
stricter controls on political finances. ``This is an American
problem evidenced by grand jury investigations, by special counsel
investigations, by congressional investigations.''
<p>
   Lott started with partisan points because he would need to keep
the votes of at least 41 of the 55 Republicans in order to block
final action, if amendments fail to make the bill acceptable to the
GOP.
<p>
   Daschle quickly struck bipartisan themes because 45 Democrats
could not prevent a bill-killing filibuster without the votes of at
least 15 Republicans.
<p>
   After the leaders left the floor, other senators began to lay
out detailed constitutional, practical and political arguments for
all sides  &MD;  entering pages of documents into the official
Congressional Record. They were trying to influence senators who
are more swayed by the written word than by oral debate.
<p>
   The speakers ranged from strong opponents of new restrictions on
political spending such as Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Bob
Bennett, R-Utah, to Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-S.D., and other advocates
of much tighter restrictions.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., made only token appearances on the floor, because they were
working with congressional staff experts to finish polishing the
latest revision of the only bill with any chance of passing.
<p>
   Their bipartisan reform bill has been endorsed by all 45
Democrats and four Republicans. They hope that further amendments
during the debate could expand their Republican support.
<p>
   The central provision of the latest version would ban the use by
national parties of ``soft money,'' which includes contributions of
any size from corporations or unions and contributions above a
$20,000 annual limit from individuals. To offset this loss, the
bill would raise the limit for individuals to $30,000 a year, and
let state parties continue to accept whatever gifts are legal under
their state's laws for non-federal election activities.
<p>
   Other provisions in the latest bipartisan bill:
<p>
    &MD;  Require swifter and better disclosure of campaign
contributions.
<p>
    &MD;  Give new enforcement powers to the Federal Election
Commission.
<p>
    &MD;  Require that any organization, such as a union or
anti-abortion group, which sponsors paid ads mentioning or using a
photo of a federal candidate in the 60 days before an election obey
the disclosure rules and contribution limits that apply to overtly
political committees. Printed voter guides comparing the voting
records or issue positions of candidates would be exempt.
<p>
    &MD;  Make it a little harder for unions to use money from their
treasuries for independent ad campaigns.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   After the formal introduction of the new bipartisan bill Monday,
Lott will introduce an amendment. Aides said it could be a
substitute for the entire bill or a much stricter version of the
union restraints.
<p>
   Senators will then have one week before the first votes on
amendments. That period will give them plenty of time to spell out
their public positions on campaign finances, while negotiating in
private over further modifications to the bipartisan bill.
<p>
   The House is expected to delay action until its leaders find out
whether the Senate will actually pass a bill.
<p>
   Preparing for that, a new group of House members from both
parties who have sponsored many conflicting reform bills announced
Friday that they have launched an effort to agree on one bill. It
will be ``based on the principles'' of the McCain-Feingold
proposal, said Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass.
<p>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the principles include
``banning soft money, increasing disclosure for candidates and
issue-advocacy advertising,'' and tightening the laws on what funds
unions can use for political activities.

 &UR; XEROX PLANS TO TARGET H-P DOMINANCE IN NETWORK PRINTER MARKET &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Xerox Corp. will
attack Hewlett-Packard Co.'s grip on the market for printers hooked
to office computer networks Monday when it introduces a new line of
products.
<p>
   Xerox, which leads in the commercial printer market, will roll
out products that compete with H-P's machines in the larger market
for office printers, analysts said. It will sell the machines
through distributors rather than its own sales force, a strategy
designed to reach broader markets.
<p>
   The introduction represents the strongest effort yet by Xerox in
its fight with H-P, which has trounced the company in the market
for network printers. The move follows Monday's announcement that
Xerox will sell toner cartridges that fit H-P printers. The battle
is so important to Xerox that Richard Thoman, who became president
this summer, will introduce the machines in his first news
conference.
<p>
   ``Xerox is targeting right smack into the heart of H-P's line,''
said Prudential Securities analyst Alex Henderson. ``The strategy
is to push H-P back into the box on the low end and to keep it
there.''
<p>
   Xerox is pricing its machines at a 25 percent discount to
comparable H-P machines, Henderson said. Jeff Simek, a Xerox
spokesman, declined to comment on any aspect of the introduction.
<p>
   Still, Xerox has its work cut out for it, analysts said.
<p>
   In 1996, Palo Alto, California-based H-P commanded 95 percent of
the $547 million market for printers that can produce 21 to 29
pages a minute. Xerox had less than 1 percent, according to
International Data Corp. analyst Keith Waryas. H-P held 24 percent
of the $495 million market for the printers that run at 13 to 20
pages, compared with Xerox's 2 percent.
<p>
   Xerox outsold H-P in the $111 million market for more-expensive
machines that print 30 to 45 pages a minute, a rate suited to
commercial printing operations rather than corporate offices. Xerox
had 24 percent of sales, while H-P had 10 percent, IDC said.
<p>
   On Wednesday, H-P said it will begin focusing on the high-end
market in the next 18 months.
<p>
   H-P has introduced products that combines functions of copiers
and printers, as it pushes into Xerox turf, said Walter Sledzieski,
marketing manager for H-P's North American network business
<p>
   ``The two companies are starting to move into areas where the
other is more dominant,'' Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. analyst Rudolf Hokanson
said.

<p>
   For ice cream lovers in the Northeast, Friendly's restaurants
have long been synonymous with tasty treats, from the company's
signature shakes to its sundaes studded with bits of candy bars.
<p>
   But are investors willing to treat themselves to shares of the
company's stock?
<p>
   Sometime next month, Friendly's parent, the Friendly Ice Cream
Corp. of Wilbraham, Mass., wants to sell five million shares  &MD;  or
67 percent of its company  &MD;  for $19 to $21 apiece.
<p>
   Prospective investors certainly may find the company's history
attractive. Founded in 1935, Friendly's has long been an industry
leader, introducing innovations like, 1951, half-gallons of ice
cream that consumers could take home.
<p>
   Today, Friendly's is continuing efforts to fashion itself into a
full-service family restaurant and to find ways to capitalize on
its special allure for the sweet-toothed.
<p>
   But in recent years Friendly's has found itself in a sticky
mess. One reason is its debt.
<p>
   Due in large part to the expensive acquisition in 1988 by the
Restaurant Co., an investor group, Friendly's has a very high
long-term debt. In 1996 alone, that debt, $386 million as of June,
cost the company $44.1 million in interest expense, contributing to
a $7.8 million loss that represented the fifth consecutive year in
which Friendly's had negative earnings.
<p>
   Indeed, the impending public offering is part of a three-pronged
effort by Friendly's to refinance its large debt. The company hopes
to raise $100 million, with more money coming from a new, $140
million credit facility, which includes a term loan and a letter of
credit.
<p>
   And if the stock offering is successful, Friendly's plans to
sell $200 million in 10-year notes. All told, it intends to use up
to $362 million of the money it raises to straighten out its
balance sheet.
<p>
   Industry analysts applaud the refinancing effort. But they still
wonder whether, carrying this heavy debt, the company can outrun
growing competition from a host of other, expanding restaurant
chains.
<p>
   True, Friendly's is still the leading full-service restaurant
operator in the Northeast, where about 80 percent of its nearly 700
restaurants and franchises are located. And so far, the company has
only one bit, established competitor there, Brigham's Inc.
<p>
   But on the way is Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc., whose
specialty is running combination restaurant-gift shops on
interstate highways mostly in the South.
<p>
   Its entrance into New England is a worrisome sign for
Friendly's, given that Cracker Barrel is growing at a rate of 20
percent a year.
<p>
   Also invading Friendly's stronghold are other family dining
chains like Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden and Ruby Tuesday.
Analysts say many of those chains can expand rapidly because they
have little debt.
<p>
   To be sure, Friendly's, which declined to comment because it is
not allowed to discuss its financial status in the period leading
up to the offering, has been moving in the right direction.
<p>
   By sprucing up its restaurants, closing unproductive ones and
offering higher-priced dishes like a steak entree, the company has
raised its average revenue per restaurant by a healthy 29 percent
during the last 10 years. But that rate lags behind the gains of
nearly every other large restaurant chain.
<p>
   Its revenues from sales to supermarkets and institutions, which
totaled just $1.4 million in 1989, have also improved. Because
Friendly's has been pushing its treats in those precincts  &MD;  more
than 5,000 supermarkets now carry its frozen desserts  &MD; 
nonrestaurant revenues have jumped to $57.7 million for the 12
months ended in June, or nearly 10 percent of its total revenues of
$665 million.

<p>
   Industry analysts are not surprised by these gains.
<p>
   ``This company has an extremely powerful signature  &MD;  its ice
cream,'' said Malcom M. Knapp, a restaurant consultant in
Manhattan. ``They look at their treat business as their special
edge.''
<p>
   To exploit that strength, Friendly's has stepped up efforts to
link sales of its frozen treats with sales of its lunch and dinner
entrees. The company has also been opening ice cream stores
overseas  &MD;  in Britain and South Korea, for example  &MD;  as well as
selling its treats in new domestic settings like stadiums and
amusement parks.
<p>
   Because of the company's strong brand name, David Menlow,
president of IPO Financial Network in Springfield, N.J., said
Friendly's stock was likely to be well-received, opening at $1 to
$2 over its offering price. ``Name-brand companies are garnering
the most attention in this I.P.O. market,'' he explained.
<p>
   But like other analysts, Menlow questioned whether Friendly's
stock would be able to sustain a premium over the long haul.
<p>
   In general, restaurant stocks have had a tough time over the
last few years, because of concerns over escalating competition in
the industry. David Trossman, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said
the 35 restaurant stocks in his company's index had gained an
average of 7.1 percent since the beginning of the year. During the
same time, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has appreciated
more than 28 perent.
<p>
   Given the intense rivalries, Trossman said, ``the Street likes
one of two things  &MD;  either a new restaurant concept that has very
rapid growth potential, or some reason to believe that returns on a
given base of restaurants will go up dramatically.''
<p>
   Friendly's has yet to prove itself on either score. It is
staying on top of food trends, like the wrap sandwich, but that
effort hardly qualifies as a new concept. And its 1996 revenues
grew in large part because of the introduction of higher-priced
foods. Strong competition within the industry, however, limits how
much farther Friendly's can push up prices.
<p>
   Friendly's seems to be having trouble carving out new territory,
too. True, in July it entered into an agreement with Davco
Restaurants  &MD;  the largest franchisee for Wendy's International  &MD; 
under which Davco has bought rights to 34 existing Friendly's sites
and has agreed to open 100 more during the next 10 years in the
mid-Atlantic region.
<p>
   But no one knows how that long-term deal will work out. And,
according to Knapp, efforts by Friendly's to expand into the
Midwest have run into competition from companies like Denny's,
Shoney's and Bob Evans Farms, which are established there.
<p>
   And while the company's newer restaurants are generating more
than $1 million in revenue annually, the average revenue for all of
its locations was $855,000 for the 12 months ended in June. The
average Denny's or Shoney's restaurant now generates $1.2 million
to $1.7 million a year, and often more, while the average Cracker
Barrel brings in about $4 million, according to industry figures.
<p>
   And then there's that high dose of debt that Friendly's
investors will be asked to swallow. In a recent report, Mark S.
Basham, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, argued that the debt
creates such large financial risks that the offering price should
be lowered. And by a large sum: from its current $20 a share to
$15, or less.

<p>
   UNDATED: Cato Institute analyst Stephen Moore recently lamented
the media's lack of interest in the fact that higher speed limits
haven't resulted in the highway carnage predicted by opponents.
<p>
   In a piece for The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine,
Moore said that if highway deaths had surged more than 6,000 a
year, as widely predicted by safety advocates, the media would have
jumped all over the story. Instead, ``the unexpected good news
about traffic fatalities'' got a yawn.
<p>
   Moore should have left well enough alone. The Wall Street
Journal did get on the story, and guess what? The headline
proclaimed, ``Texas Traffic Toll Suggests Higher Speed Limits Do
Kill.''
<p>
   What gives? Was conservative think-tanker Moore putting an
undeserved positive spin on events to shield the GOP congressional
majority that pushed higher speed limits?
<p>
   Well, not exactly. The treatment in The Journal created a
misleading impression. It dealt almost entirely with Texas, which
had the highest road fatality increase in the country during the
first full year of higher speed limits. It also quoted a National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration official in Texas saying
``it's too bad we had to lose so many lives'' to prove speed kills.
<p>
   The story would have been more informative, though, had it used
the safety administration's data for the entire country, as Moore
did in The Standard. The overall numbers show that while fatalities
rose by 109 last year, traffic deaths per mile traveled declined 1
percent. More tellingly, ``the absolute number of speeding-related
deaths fell by 258,'' according to safety administration
statistics. This means higher speed limits correlated with improved
highway safety nationwide.
<p>
   In another revelation, Moore noted how the insurance industry
was proved wrong in its prediction that higher speed limits would
cost policyholders and taxpayers dearly. Moore said figures from
the National Association of Independent Insurers show auto
insurance premiums declining last year for the first time in a
decade as profits remained strong.
<p>
   Why were traffic fatalities flat during the first full year of
higher speed limits? Perhaps the best explanation is so many
motorists were previously driving faster than the law allowed.
Thus, the most dramatic change was to transform many drivers from
scofflaws to law-abiding citizens.
<p>
   While the argument for raising speed limits had a libertarian
flavor, it was as much about economics as anything. For most
Americans in this go-go era, time is money. This explains why so
many drivers now use cellular phones to make their vehicles
extensions of their places of business.
<p>
   The trucking industry also probably has benefited substantially
from being able to deliver goods more expeditiously. Another reward
is the reduced wear on the nerves of commercial drivers, who don't
have to worry as much about getting busted for speeding.
<p>
   The silence on this issue is troubling. Why haven't those who
predicted a bloodbath expressed some measure of thanks that their
vision of a highway holocaust didn't come to pass?
<p>
   Is it unremarkable that a legal form of behavioral control was
eased and life went on without disastrous incident? Is it
disappointing that most individuals didn't act irresponsibly when
given more latitude to behave responsibly?

   Mexico City, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks rose for a
second day on investor optimism that lower local and U.S. interest
rates and a fast-growing economy will mean strong third-quarter
profits.
<p>
   The bolsa index, led by Kimberly-Clark de Mexico SA and
industrial group Alfa SA, rose 15.13, or 0.33 percent, to 5245.74.
Kimberly Clark rose 7.8 percent to 40.1 pesos and Alfa climbed 1.8
percent to 73 pesos.
<p>
   ``Interest rates came down nicely and that gives investors some
comfort,'' said Thomas Tull, who manages $100 million with
Gulfstream Global Investors Ltd. in Dallas. ``And the economy still
looks pretty strong.''
<p>
   Investors exchanged 111.7 million shares worth 2.13 billion
pesos ($273 million). Winners edged out losers 52 to 43 with 24
stocks unchanged.
<p>
   For the week, the index rose 129.95 points, or 2.54 percent.

   The benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield fell 3 basis
points to 6.37 percent. Mexican rates often follow U.S. rates to
keep investors attracted to local securities.
<p>
   The yield on Mexico's benchmark 28-day Treasury bill sank 206
basis points to 16.91 percent in Tuesday's weekly government debt
auction. Lower rates can help company earnings by reducing
borrowing costs and spurring consumer spending and demand for
loans.
<p>
   The peso was unchanged at 12.80 U.S. cents after dropping more
than 1 percent from 12.94 cents Monday.
<p>
   Employment at manufacturing companies rose 5.5 percent in July
from the same month last year, the government reported, marking its
16th straight monthly increase.
<p>
   Manufacturing wages climbed 2.1 percent during July, the highest
monthly increase since December 1994.
<p>
   Grocery and department store stocks rose on more signs of strong
growth in the domestic economy. Department store sales rose 16.3
percent in August from the year-earlier month, the biggest increase
since the December 1994 peso devaluation. Retail sales, which
include less expensive items, rose 5.3 percent.
<p>
   El Puerto de Liverpool SA, a Mexican department store, rose 2.8
percent to 11 pesos on the news.
<p>
   Cifra, the country's largest supermarket chain, rose 2.1 percent
to 16.7 pesos after Robert Fleming Inc. analyst Marc de Speville
and ING Barings Ltd. analyst Sebastian Barry-Taylor raised the
company's rating to a ``hold'' from a ``buy'' in separate reports.
<p>
   Grupo Industrial Saltillo SA, an auto parts and ceramic products
maker, fell 2.4 to 33.2 pesos in heavy activity after it began
trading 17.5 million new shares sold this week by the company and
shareholders. Investors exchanged 25.6 million Saltillo shares,
almost 40 times average volume during the last three months.
<p>
   Construction company Empresas ICA SA rose 3.2 percent to 22.6
pesos after Caspian Securities Inc. analysts Paul Rodriguez and
Sebastian Chatel rated the company ``market perform'' in new
coverage.
<p>
   Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival SA rose 1.7 percent to 24 pesos
even after Santander Investment Securities Inc. analyst Robert
Lacoursiere lowered the country's largest banking group's rating to
``market perform'' from ``buy.''
<p>
   Grupo Financiero Serfin SA, the third largest banking group,
fell 3.1 percent to 3 15/16 in New York trading after the
Monterrey-based newspaper El Norte reported the company plans to
sell its warehousing unit as part of an effort to raise money to
shore up its finances.
<p>
   Vitro SA, a large glass and appliance maker, was unchanged at
39.3 pesos after El Norte reported the company formed a joint
venture with General Electric Co. to make component parts for
turbines, generators and medical appliances as well as molds for
lighting products. The new company expects to have about $28
million in sales next year, the paper said, citing Ricardo
Gonzalez, director of Vitro's packaging division. TV Azteca SA's
shares in New York fell 0.3 percent to 22 1/2 as the television
broadcaster negotiates the size of the minority stake it might take
in a group planning to bid on a state-owned satellite company. The
group now includes silver producer Industrial Penoles SA,
Connecticut-based PanAmSat Corp. and cable company MVS
Comunicaciones SA.
<p>
   The Reforma newspaper quoted company officials as saying Azteca
might invest between $15 million and $20 million in the group .
<p>
   Penoles fell 1.4 percent to 35.1 pesos.
<p>
   Grupo Comercial Gomo SA, an importer of electronic appliances
and other electronic goods, gained the most during the day, rising
9.9 percent to 8.02 pesos.

<p>
   WESTWOOD, Kan.  &MD;  Sprint's Internet Passport service is teaming
up with Intel Corp. to test new technology that may take some of
the ``World Wide Wait'' out of the World Wide Web.
<p>
   Sprint Corp. on Thursday said it has signed an agreement with
Intel to test the company's new Quick Web Technology. Intel, best
known for making the microprocessors that power desktop computers,
says the technology cuts in half the time it takes to gain access
to some World Wide Web pages.
<p>
   The acceleration doesn't require a faster modem or software.
<p>
   Quick Web uses two techniques to speed the downloading of Web
pages, especially pages loaded with graphics and photographs, said
Frank Gill, executive vice president of Intel's Internet and
Communications Group.
<p>
   As more people hook into the Internet, delays in gaining access
to material on the World Wide Web have become common. The bandwidth
on the Web hasn't kept up with the growth in users.
<p>
   Bandwidth determines how much information  &MD;  in the form of bits
of data  &MD;  can be transmitted over a telephone line at a particular
time. On the Internet, bandwidth means speed. Slowdowns on the
Internet have led some computer users to refer to the World Wide
Web as the ``World Wide Wait.''
<p>
   Sprint is one of three Internet providers selected by Intel to
test Quick Web. In the next two weeks, an undetermined number of
Sprint Internet Passport customers will be asked to try out the
Quick Web technology.
<p>
   ``Our customers need fast, simple, reliable Internet access and
don't want to wait in line on the Net,'' said Jim Dodd, vice
president of Sprint Internet Access Services.
<p>
   Terry Parker, Sprint's director of product management and
development, said Quick Web allows users to be more productive and
spend less time looking for material on the Web.
<p>
   ``Personally, for me, I'd say 50 to 75 percent of my time on
line is spent waiting to get to the information I need,'' Parker
said.
<p>
   Quick Web uses two technologies to get Web pages to users more
quickly.
<p>
   The central technology is compression. Quick Web compresses Web
pages and removes data unnecessary to the overall look of the page.
Because the pages are smaller and don't contain as much data, they
move across the Net more quickly  &MD;  up to three times faster,
according to Intel.
<p>
   Parker said the compression technology affects picture quality
slightly.
<p>
   But Sprint employees and others who have tried out Quick Web
have been enthusiastic.
<p>
   ``People who have used it said the difference in quality was
noticeable, but the benefit far outweighed the difference,'' Parker
said.
<p>
   Quick Web can be easily switched off if a user wants to see a
photograph at its highest quality, Parker said.
<p>
   The second technology involves caching, or storing, Web pages on
computers maintained by Intel or by an Internet service provider. A
user's first request for a Web page is stored on Intel's computer.
Later requests for the same Web page are delivered quickly from the
stored data, Intel officials said.
<p>
   Parker said Sprint would determine whether to offer Quick Web to
Passport's more than 105,000 users after the test is completed.
<p>
   Quick Web is the second upgrade announced for Internet Passport
this week. On Monday, Sprint officials said the service had signed
an agreement with CNET: The Computer Network to make the Snap!
Online service available to Sprint customers.
<p>
   Snap! Online organizes material on the Internet into
``channels,'' so finding information is easier, Sprint officials
said. The service is free.
<p>
   ``We're working to make the Internet faster, and not just from a
standpoint of Net speed, but fast from the standpoint of how our
customers spend their own personal time,'' Parker said.
<p>
   ``Rather than having someone spend an hour looking for
something, we're solving all of those issues so they can get to
that content quickly and productively.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The owner of two
Pennsylvania investment adviser firms was charged by the Securities
and Exchange Commission today with defrauding 75 school districts
in the state.
<p>
   The districts lost $71 million from $233 million invested
through Devon Capital Management and its affiliate, Financial
Management Sciences, both in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, the SEC said.
The firms are owned by John Gardner Black, who the SEC said
diverted at least $2 million of the school districts' money to
personal and business expenses since January 1996.
<p>
   Black, who lives in Broad Top, Pennsylvania, couldn't be reached
for comment. Alan Strasser, an attorney who once represented Black,
called the SEC's action ``harsh and precipitous.''
<p>
   Black's two firms manage $345 million in assets for about 100
clients, most of which are school districts seeking to invest
municipal bond proceeds, the SEC said.
<p>
   The SEC lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Pittsburgh,
accused Black of failing to tell the districts of his funds
diversion and trading losses. He also misrepresented the value of
the collateral he had available for their securities investments,
the complaint said.
<p>
   ``This is a serious fraud because these are public funds put up
by school districts,'' said SEC enforcement director William
McLucas. ``It affects taxpayers, citizens, and clearly school
districts.''
<p>
   Black's sales materials said he invested in ``collateralized
investment agreements'' that he said paid a specified rate of
return over a fixed period, according to the SEC. Black told the
districts that these investments were protected by a pool of
securities equal to their investment principal, when in fact the
districts had lost $71 million in principal, the complaint alleged.
<p>
   The SEC does not allege precisely how many millions of dollars
the districts, in western and central Pennsylvania, lost as a
result of fraud, McLucas said. U.S. District Judge William Standish
appointed former U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh as
trustee of Black's funds, which the judge froze.
<p>
   ``Obtaining a trustee for Devon Capital may harm the clients
because we don't believe any trustee will be familiar with the
business of Devon Capital,'' said Strasser, an attorney for Kutak
Rock in Washington, D.C., who said he does not now represent Black
in this matter.
<p>
   At least $50 million of the losses stemmed from Black's trading,
which may not have been fraudulent, said Ronald Long, head of the
SEC's regional office in Philadelphia. At least $2 million more was
diverted by Black for his personal and professional use, Long said.
<p>
   Among the districts defrauded were Allegheny East, Bald Eagle
Area, Bethlehem Area, Big Beaver Falls, Blacklick,
Cornwall/Lebanon, Daniel Boone, Hatboro Horsham, Lancaster, Mercer
Area, Penns Manor and Susquehanna Township.
<p>
   ``These losses will be keenly felt because most of these
districts are scrambling for funds,'' said Stinson Stroup, director
of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. Most
funds in Pennsylvania school districts are raised from local
property taxes, he said.
<p>
   This was the largest municipal fraud in Pennsylvania history,
Long said.

<p>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan.  &MD;  One day last month, Tim Jury lost his
office at Andersen Consulting, where he is a partner. The company
simply kicked him out.
<p>
   Now he lines up electronically with employees and out-of-towners
in a daily grab for floor space in Overland Park. But then, all the
other partners do, too.
<p>
   ``It's not my office. It's an office,'' Jury said Monday to
describe the space he used that day.
<p>
   Welcome to the office of the future, or rather the
officelessness of the future. Even partners with a share in the
company's profits don't get their own office.
<p>
   They can get an office by reserving one the day before, as Jury
had. And then it's back in line the next day.
<p>
   Andersen Consulting's self-inflicted ``virtual office'' concept
became reality early this month.
<p>
   Need a desk? Reserve one in advance. Need to make a private
phone call to a client? Step into one of the booths and dial. Need
a spot next to your executive assistant? Order now before they fill
up.
<p>
   Need a window-filled corner office you can stuff with family
photos, decorate in your favorite sports team's motif and convert
to a putting green during lunch? Get lost.
<p>
   In this future, an office becomes an office again. Efficient.
Spare. Cold.
<p>
   Forget displays of grade-school artwork or chair bottoms that
have been transformed by time to fit just right. In this world, an
office chair is just an office chair. A wall is just a wall. A desk
top, a desk top.
<p>
   Neighboring work buddies one day become
other-side-of-the-building co-workers the next.
<p>
   And you don't get any more space than you'll be able to use that
day. ``Assigned according to your needs, if you will,'' Jury
explained.
<p>
   What makes this scary for any cubicle clutterer is the nature of
Andersen's business: It sends consultants around the world every
day to help other companies run their businesses better.
<p>
   The relief is that even Andersen Consulting doesn't think many
companies would benefit from its version of the office of the
future.
<p>
   But there are side effects that could be alluring to any office
manager. And it may be only a matter of time until some savvy
Andersen consultant figures out how this would work for everyone
else.
<p>
   Blame Paris. That's where the idea began two years ago, in the
Andersen Consulting office there. The Boston office imported the
idea in February.
<p>
   Now, Kansas City, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington have
converted. The rest will follow as leases expire.
<p>
   Here, Andersen Consulting's virtual office works this way:
<p>
   The 14th floor is filled with 75 open cubicles and 20 offices
that have doors. A few ``huddle rooms'' and community spaces fill
the rest of the 23,700 square feet. Andersen moved from downtown
Kansas City, where it had outgrown its available space.
<p>
   Each day, partners, managers and employees ask, by computer, for
whatever space they will need. Each evening around 6:30, Wendy
Newlon and Gail Haavisto assign cubicles, offices and conference
rooms based on the requests in hand.
<p>
   Next morning, the people arrive.
<p>
   ``Hi, Troy,'' Newlon said last week, greeting a man with short
hair, glasses and black shoulder bag who offered a friendly ``Hi''
in return.
<p>
   ``Let's see where you are today.''
<p>
   It's Office 1433; Troy Miller knows where that is.
<p>
   The next employee through the door, however, not only needs to
be shown where his office for the day is, but where his executive
assistant is sitting. It turns out the assistant is on one side of
the building and he's on the other, separated by the elevators,
reception areas and coffee bar.
<p>
   Newlon, whose title is service coordinator, said she couldn't
put the two near each other because the space was taken already.
<p>
   The same thing happened previously to Chris Gould and Kris
Farney. Gould works for Farney, but could reserve space no closer
than three sections away from Farney's open cubicle. Gould said he
had to walk over or telephone to discuss business.
<p>
   Once he stood and hollered, but not twice. He also devised a few
hand signals.
<p>
   Last week, they were back side by side.
<p>
   ``I'll probably be here quite a while  &MD;  couple of weeks,'' Gould
said.
<p>
   For Andersen Consulting, this idea really does make sense. Most
of its employees spend little time at the office. A study of the
Kansas City operation found that three-fourths of its offices were
empty on any given day.
<p>
   ``We have 400 people in Kansas City,'' said Jim Reed, office
managing partner. ``But they're out there. They're all over the
world.''
<p>
   They spend most of the time at clients' offices. They travel
even more than they did just three years ago because of a
reorganization of the company. Each person lugs around his or her
assigned laptop computer that will connect to Andersen's main
computers from anywhere in the world. As Jury said, they live out
of a briefcase.
<p>
   Jury said he used his old office maybe two days a week. Senior
manager Ferrell Sanders is in maybe one day a week.
<p>
   Under the new system, each taps into the main computer and asks
for an office only for the days they will be there to use it.
<p>
   By contrast, the few permanent staffers  &MD;  who are in the office
every day  &MD;  can get their own desks at the same spot every day.
Semipermanent staff can reserve a space for up to three months.
<p>
   That's enough time for Deb Exstrom, a human-resource director
with semipermanent office status, to unpack her Einstein bust, wood
curio box and large glass egg with a rabbit on top. MORE

 &UR; By Lynne Marek &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
Dallas, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Union Pacific Railroad, a unit of
Union Pacific Corp., said its top operations executive resigned.
The company gave no reason for the resignation by Art Shoener as
executive vice president of operations, which comes amid a federal
investigation of the railroad's safety practices. Dallas-based
Union Pacific Corp. elected Brad King, 49-year-old vice president
of transportation, to succeed Shoener. The 50-year-old Shoener, who
had been with the company a30 years, couldn't be reached for
comment. He had held the operations post since 1991. The King
appointment and other management changes, including the naming of a
new safety executive, followed discussions with the Federal
Railroad Administration, railroad spokesman Jim Hildreth said.
Company executives couldn't be reached for further comment. The
Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad, which operates 36,000 miles of
track, had three accidents on its lines between June 22 and Aug. 21
that resulted in the deaths of five employees and two stowaways.
Following the accidents, the Federal Railroad Administration sent
federal inspectors to probe the railroad's operations. They
determined that there had been a ``fundamental breakdown'' in Union
Pacific's procedures and operations and cited problems that
included employee fatigue, inadequate staffing, poorly trained
supervisors and defective locomotives. King, who most recently
served as vice president of transportation starting in November
1995, began his career in the railroad business in 1970 as a
management trainee at Missouri Pacific Railroad, which was acquired
by Union Pacific in 1982. Since then he has held a variety of
operating posts in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas, according
to the company press release. He couldn't be reached for comment.
The railroad elected Dennis Duffy, 46, to the new position as the
senior vice president of safety assurance and compliance. It also
named Gayla Fletcher, 41, vice president of risk management. Union
Pacific shares rose 1/16 to 62 1/16.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  All politicians want to be in demand, but in the
debate over trade agreements, Rep. Karen McCarthy of Missouri is
finding out that sometimes, to her political distress, you get what
you wish for.
<p>
   McCarthy, a Democrat, is one of about 40 swing votes in the
House who are still undecided about giving President Clinton
``fast-track'' authority to negotiate international trade
agreements. Congress would not be able to amend them, only vote up
or down.
<p>
   But like the dispute in 1993 over passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, the fast-track debate is a textbook case of
business vs. labor.
<p>
   For McCarthy, the dilemma is very real because she has tried to
be a friend to both sides. They, likewise, have been friendly to
her at election time with substantial political support.
<p>
   Labor unions contributed $141,000 to McCarthy's re-election
campaign last year. Business political action committees gave
$233,000. Now both sides want her vote, and one of them is going to
be disappointed.
<p>
   ``I'm still studying the issue,'' McCarthy said. ``There's an
awful lot of interest on all sides  &MD;  business people, working
people  &MD;  on this particular issue. I've tried to make myself
available to as many as I can.''
<p>
   President Clinton and business leaders say that fast-track
authority will enable the country to trade with the world's
fastest-growing markets. Without it, they argue, the U.S. would be
at a disadvantage in emerging economies.
<p>
   Opponents, such as labor, environmental groups and House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri want trade agreements
to require other countries to meet standards on wages and
environmental protections. Without them, they say, U.S. companies
would be able to do business more cheaply overseas, which could
mean a drop in wages here, or possibly even a loss in jobs.
<p>
   Through the month of August, 142,000 U.S. workers were eligible
for job retraining and financial aid under NAFTA-related programs,
according to the Labor Department. While unions say those jobs lost
are ``only the tip of the iceberg,'' federal labor and trade
officials cautioned that many of the jobs lost through plant
closings might not be directly related to NAFTA.
<p>
   Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative's
office, said the government estimates that about 311,000 jobs have
been added to the economy because of NAFTA.
<p>
   ``Trade is not a zero-sum equation,'' he said. ``The numbers
don't always add up. But the economy couldn't be at a 25-year low
in unemployment and have the kinds of jobs lost that opponents of
NAFTA and others are suggesting.''
<p>
   The number that matters most in Washington right now is 218.
That's how many votes the winning side in the fast-track debate
will need in Congress.
<p>
   The lobbying over fast-track authority is ``very intense,''
according to Jay Berman, a White House special counsel for trade
issues.
<p>
   ``Some people have drawn a line in the sand and made this a
litmus test: `If you vote for me, then you have to be against them.
If you vote for them, then you have to be against me,''' he said.
<p>
   Last Friday, for example, McCarthy heard from Commerce Secretary
William Daley, who made a plea for fast-track authority in a phone
call. She's due to meet with White House chief of staff Erskine
Bowles this week. She's also met with the president, spoken with
his chief trade negotiator and been lobbied by leaders from labor
and business.
<p>
   One of them is Harry Cleberg, president and CEO of Farmland
Industries, which had sales of $9.8 billion last year and exports
to 74 countries.
<p>
   ``Karen and I have a lot of commonalities of belief concerning
international trade,'' Cleberg said. ``She will make an educated
decision and I will be personally quite surprised if she doesn't
ultimately support fast track.''
<p>
   McCarthy has dodged many labor bullets  &MD;  so far.
<p>
   The AFL-CIO has begun a multimillion-dollar radio and television
campaign aimed at undecided lawmakers with large numbers of labor
voters in their districts. The ads are appearing throughout
California and in 13 other congressional districts. Seven are held
by Democrats and six by Republicans.
<p>
   The ads link fast-track authority to NAFTA. They warn that NAFTA
meant the loss of jobs, ``tainted food on our shelves'' and ``more
pollution along our border.'' The ads urge viewers and listeners to
call their members of Congress and tell them to vote no.
<p>
   ``They are persuasion ads, not punishment ads,'' said Thea Lee,
assistant director of public policy for the AFL-CIO.
<p>
   Although McCarthy's district in Kansas City has about 42,000
union households, the ad is not running there. Not yet.
<p>
   But at a news conference last week in Minneapolis, when the
AFL-CIO unveiled its ad campaign against Rep. Bill Luther, a
Democrat who is uncommitted on the fast-track legislation, the name
of the lawmaker used in the sample ad, dated Sept. 16, was Karen
McCarthy.
<p>
   McCarthy said she was unaware of any plans by labor to use the
ad in her district. Of labor's lobbying effort, she said, ``I think
they're handling me as they would on any issue: presenting me with
the facts.''
<p>
   Bridgette Williams, president of the Greater Kansas City
AFL-CIO, said the anti-fast-track ad was set to run in McCarthy's
district, but was pulled at the last minute. It still may run. She
called McCarthy's silence on fast track ``disturbing.''
<p>
   ``Typically on labor issues, she's quite clear on her stands,''
Williams said.
<p>
   McCarthy has a near-perfect labor voting record, but enjoys
strong business support back home. She also comes from a
traditional  &MD;  and safe  &MD;  Democratic district, but warms to the
so-called ``New Democrats'' for whom economic reform often trumps
what have been core Democratic issues.
<p>
   On symbolic issues like welfare reform and the balanced budget,
for instance, McCarthy sided with Clinton and voted for both  &MD;  to
the chagrin of some key Democratic constituencies, like labor and
social policy activists.
<p>
   And then there's her allegiance to Gephardt, the most outspoken
opponent of fast-track authority on the Capitol Hill. Not only is
he the party's congressional leader, he's the head of her state's
delegation.
<p>
   ``Good public policy,'' said McCarthy chief of staff Phil
Scaglia, ``is often a difficult balance.''

    &UR; ATTN: Expected to re-top following Gov. Winter's speech at 10
p.m. EDT.
 &UR; FOUR DECADES LATER, DESEGREGATION FAR SHORT OF HOPES
<p>
    &UR; By JULIA MALONE &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  &MD;  At the end of a week-long remembrance of the
day nine black students crossed the color barrier into Central High
School here, the debate on Friday turned to whether the clock is
turning backward on desegregation.
<p>
   ``We obviously have not overcome the difficulties of the past,''
said former Mississippi Gov. William Winter in remarks prepared to
open a national conference on race in Central High's auditorium.
<p>
   The two-day discussion, beamed by satellite to 40 cities on
Friday night and Saturday, followed on the heels of Thursday's
celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Little Rock school
crisis.
<p>
   Winter, a member of President Clinton's advisory board on race,
said the desegregation of the nation's public schools since 1957
has been accompanied by ``drastically reduced white enrollment.''
<p>
   By 1980, white students made up only four percent of the public
school enrollment in Washington, D.C., eight percent in Atlanta,
and 12 percent in Detroit, he said.
<p>
   Even so, Winter, an education reformer in his home state during
the 1980s, called for a renewed push to bring the races together in
schools.
<p>
   ``There must first of all be an understanding that we shall
succeed (as a competitive nation) only by making our schools places
where students not only learn how to make a living but also how to
live together,'' he said.
<p>
   Earlier, at the University of Arkansas campus here, scholars
also raised questions about the future of desegregation.
<p>
   ``The resolve for integration has weakened'' among whites and
blacks, said David Goldfield, a history professor at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte.
<p>
   Goldfield said that among some blacks it has now become
``fashionable'' to look back with nostalgia on era of segregation,
when they lived in communities where the businesses were
black-owned and families intact, he said.
<p>
   Alton Hornsby, history professor at Morehouse College in
Atlanta, concurred. ``Many blacks believe that there were certain
values in those insular communities during segregation,'' he said,
adding that he did not share the nostalgic mood.
<p>
   Nor does John Hope Franklin, the octogenarian chairman of
President Clinton's advisory council on race and a leading
African-American historian, who dismissed the idea of returning to
a bygone era.
<p>
   ``Anyone who wants to go back there wasn't there the last
time,'' he said. ``I was there.
<p>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Even so, scholars and others joined expressing disappointment at
the unfulfilled hopes of the U.S. civil rights era.
<p>
   John Walker, the lead attorney in the ongoing case against the
Little Rock school district, said in an interview, ``The fairness
that desegregated schools promised was never realized.''
<p>
   Walker's chief complaint now is that the city school system,
anxious to keep as many white students as possible, bends over
backward to assist whites. He is especially rankled by the fact
that some 60 percent of the white students at Central High School
are in advanced courses, while blacks predominate in the all of the
other levels.
<p>
   ``What you have in Little Rock is white flight,'' Walker said.
``So every white child is an asset to the school.''
<p>
   Goldfield said such policies are a ``major thrust'' in urban
school districts, where black students are generally bused longer
distances. ``The greatest burden is still on the black children,''
he said. ``The policy is to keep middle class white families'' in
the system.

 &UR; ITC FINDS INJURY TO CRAY FROM JAPANESE SUPERCOMPUTERS (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Catherine Hollingsworth &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
   (adds comment by Cray in second paragraph, shares in fifth
paragraph, NEC reaction in paragraphs 6-7.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. International Trade
Commission concluded that NEC Corp. dumped Japanese-made
supercomputers on the U.S. market at less than fair value, and that
sales of those computers hurt the only U.S. maker of
supercomputers, Cray Research, an ITC spokeswoman said.
<p>
   ``This does ensure that at least in the domestic market,
competition will be conducted fairly,'' said John Sullivan, vice
president and general counsel for Cray parent Silicon Graphics Inc.
A spokesman for Japan-based NEC denied the charges.
<p>
   The commission, voting 3-0, found injury to the U.S.
supercomputer industry, represented by Cray Research, said
spokesman Peg O'Laughlin. The Eagan, Minnesota-based company filed
a complaint against NEC last September.
<p>
   Cray claimed that the Japanese company took a $65 million loss
in a contract with the National Center for Atmospheric Research to
deliver four supercomputers over five years. The center postponed
the purchases until the final decision by ITC. Shares in Cray
parent Silicon Graphics fell 1/16 to 26 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange. NEC shares fell 60 yen to 1530 yen in Tokyo today, and
its American depository receipts were unchanged at 61 1/2.
<p>
   ``The dumping charge is a blatant fabrication,'' said Samuel
Adams, vice president for a subsidiary of NEC, HNSX Supercomputers,
Inc. ``Commerce, in its desire to keep Japanese supercomputers out
of the United States, eagerly rubber stamped Cray's allegations
without even rudimentary verification.''
<p>
   ``NEC supercomputers will be actively marketed in Canada,
Mexico, Europe and other markets open to competition,'' Adams said.
<p>
   The Commerce Department ruled on the violations in August in
favor of Cray. NEC could appeal the Commerce decision in a year,
said Silicon Graphics attorney John Greenwald, a partner at Wilmer,
Cutler &AMP; Pickering.
<p>
   Cray's Sullivan said the company ``is willing to listen'' to
NEC, but ``for now, the discussions have ended.''
<p>
   The Commerce Department decides the level of dumping by the
country involved and sets tariffs accordingly to bring prices up to
what the department considers is fair value. Duties are collected
by U.S. Customs.
<p>
   The Commerce Department also examined practices of related
manufacturers from the country involved and Fujitsu Ltd. was also
named in the case. NEC and Fujitsu faced tariffs of 454 percent and
173 percent, respectively on supercomputers imported in the U.S.
Fujitsu ADRs fell 3 to 63 1/2 today.
<p>
   Fujitsu's tariff is a 150 percentage-point jump from Commerce's
March preliminary ruling of 27.17 percent. This is because Fujitsu
stopped supplying information to Commerce and the department was
forced to use information from Cray's records to determine the
final tariff, Commerce spokesman Curt Cultice has said.
<p>
   Triple-digit tariff rates aren't usually imposed in dumping
decisions, Cultice said. The tariffs were unusually high because
NEC and Fujitsu didn't submit materials refuting Cray's claim,
``Because we had no data from the companies we based the decision
on (Cray's) application.''
<p>
   A day after the Commerce Department's ruling, NEC announced its
appeal to the U.S. Court of International Trade to block the
Commerce Department's investigation of the issue and any higher
tariffs, but was unsuccessful.
<p>
   This was the first time the court examined the propriety of a
Commerce Department investigation. Had it ruled in NEC's favor, it
could have ordered special oversight of the investigation or that
the department not hear the matter at all.
<p>
   NEC officials in Japan had said at the time the court action may
cause the company to review its supercomputer strategy for the U.S.

<p>
   Lower costs for investors. Fewer funds groups. And more money in
those funds. That's what today's fund group leaders envision for
the mutual fund industry at the close of the century.
<p>
   The findings were part of a large study conducted over the past
two years by Marcia Selz, president and chief executive of
Marketing Matrix, a research firm in Los Angeles that specializes
in the financial services industry. Ms. Selz talked to 59
executives of fund groups about their industry.
<p>
   The consensus was that fund costs would be much lower over all
because of increased competition among fund groups. The executives
expect lower annual expenses and smaller management fees, as well
as fewer and lower initial sales charges, or front-end loads.
<p>
   Investors may also help push down fees. ``Educated, smarter
investors make us watch our prices and fees,'' one fund leader told
Ms. Selz.
<p>
   A study released last week by Lip-H per Analytical Services in
Summit, N.J., concluded that the fund indus- try did not now enjoy
the economies of scale that would allow fund com- panies to lower
fees charged to in- vestors as assets grow. Nonetheless, ``if
competitive pressures continue as they have been, mutual fund lead-
ers will find ways to develop econo- mies of scale,'' Ms. Selz
said.
<p>
   Nearly all the respondents to her study said financial advisers
would work on a fee basis by 2005, instead of a transaction basis,
creating a more service-oriented business. Advisers will be
rewarded for continuing money management performance, rather than
for sales alone.
<p>
   And while investors will allocate a bigger percentage of their
total investment assets to funds, the industry itself will
experience consolidation, executives said.
<p>
   But they disagreed on how the consolidation would occur: some
said smaller companies would be swallowed by larger ones; others
said the Internet would build the market for small fund groups by
giving them direct access to investors, leaving the midsized fund
families to consolidate into the larger groups. 
<p>
   A Scudder Index Fund
<p>
   Is there no end? Investors' appetite for funds that track the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index seems insatiable, and more fund
companies are chasing those dollars. The latest is  &UR; Scudder,
Stevens &AMP; Clark &LR; .
<p>
   For its  &UR; Scudder S&AMP;P 500 Index  &LR; fund, the company is tapping the
investment expertise of Bankers Trust &AMP; Co., which also runs a
similar fund for Fidelity. But the Scudder fund is much pricier.
Its expenses are capped at 0.4 percent until April 30, 1998. That
is double the 0.2 percent of the Vanguard Index 500, and more than
double the 0.19 perent of Fidelity's fund  &MD;   &UR; Spartan Market Index &LR; .
<p>
   The Scudder fund has a minimum initial investment of $2,500,
compared with $3,000 for the Vanguard fund and $10,000 for the
Fidelity fund.
<p>
   New Baron Fund
<p>
    &UR; Baron Small Cap &LR;  will invest mainly in small companies with
market values up to $1 billion. Its manager, Cliff Greenberg, was
formerly a manager with HPB Associates. Shares will be available at
$10 each through Sept. 30.
<p>
   New Managers
<p>
   Scott Satterwhite, former manager of  &UR; Biltmore Special Values &LR; ,
has joined Artisan Partners as manager of  &UR; Artisan Small Cap
Value &LR; , a new fund available by subscription at $10 a share until
Monday. The fund is scheduled to close to new investors when assets
reach $400 million.
<p>
   Alan Gilston, formerly a portfolio manager at Schroder Capital
Management International, has joined Oppenheimer Funds as
co-manager of  &UR; Oppenheimer Discovery &LR;  with the longtime manager,
Jay Tracey.
<p>

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The British pound tumbled
against the dollar and other major currencies on a report that the
U.K. may join Europe's economic and monetary union after it gets
underway in 1999.
<p>
   The dollar staged its biggest gain against sterling in two
months after an unidentified cabinet minister told the Financial
Times the British government is more eager to join Europe's single
currency, or euro, than it was several months ago.
<p>
   Sterling climbed 25 percent against the German mark since August
1996, lifted by a booming economy, higher interest rates and
expectations Britain wouldn't join monetary union at the outset.
Now, the U.K. might need to cut interest rates to bring them in
line with rates elsewhere in Europe to enter the union.
<p>
   ``If the markets start to believe U.K. interest rates will come
down to levels seen in Germany and France, sterling will come down
relative to other currencies,'' said Chris Iggo, chief economist at
BZW Securities Inc.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.34 percent versus the dollar, its largest
one-day decline since July 28, to $1.6079 from $1.6299 yesterday.
It also fell to 2.8303 marks from 2.8698 marks, its biggest one-day
drop against the German currency in six weeks.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 121.26 yen from 121.13 yen and
at 1.7590 marks from 1.7609 marks yesterday.
<p>
   For the week, the dollar fell 0.92 percent against the mark and
0.74 percent against the yen. Still, the dollar gained against both
currencies so far this quarter, up 5.8 percent against the yen and
0.82 percent versus the mark.
<p>
   Traders were undeterred in their flurry to sell pounds, even
after the U.K. Treasury dismissed the report as speculation. A
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said the government's
reserving its option to join monetary union.
<p>
   It's typical of the British government to ``float an idea first
to see how the public reacts,'' said Bob Savage, chief currency
trader at Lehman Brothers. This could have been an ``official
leak.''
<p>
   Economists reckon the pound is likely to join the single
currency at as low as 2.5 marks, Savage said.
<p>
   Still, British officials may not let the pound fall too far,
since an overly weak currency could fan inflation. With interest
rates in the U.K. already high, the government may have little
scope to raise them much further.
<p>
   ``They have a huge dilemma,'' Savage said. ``A quickly falling
pound could lead to disaster, while a rate rise could drive the
economy into recession.''
<p>
   Jesse Torres, chief currency trader at Bank Austria, was among
sterling sellers today.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the yen on concern over
rising trade tension between the U.S. and Japan. The dollar's
strength against the Japanese currency is pushing up the price of
U.S. exports and helping to tilt the balance of trade further in
Japan's favor.
<p>
   U.S. officials repeatedly call on Japan to do more to correct
that imbalance by stimulating domestic demand. Some traders are
concerned that if the U.S. trade gap keeps worsening, U.S.
officials might soften their support for a strong dollar.
<p>
   ``Difficulty with trade issues is growing and could become even
more of a problem,'' said Lehman Brothers' Bob Savage.
<p>
   Just yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Japan's trade surplus is causing concern in Washington,
according to reports. That echoed comments by U.S. Deputy Trade
Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.
<p>
   ``The U.S. administration is on the offensive,'' said Michael
Scarlatos, currency strategist at Bankers Trust New York Corp.
``Witness Barshefsky's language yesterday.''
<p>
   Still, supporting the dollar against the yen was expectation
Japan's economy will stay weak, keeping the country's interest
rates near their all-time lows and souring investors on the yen.
<p>
   Also, since the yen's weakness benefits the economy by making
exports cheaper, Japanese officials may not mind too much if it
falls further.
<p>
   ``The economy is moribund, in terrible shape,'' said Savage.
``An export-led recovery seems to be the only way out.''
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against the mark, recouping
earlier losses after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing
suggested he's satisfied with the dollar's level versus the mark.
<p>
   Concern that the German currency may be too weak ``hasn't
disappeared but it's not as strong,'' Issing said.
<p>
   Analysts consider Issing one of the Bundesbank's staunchest
inflation foes. The mark's weakness against the dollar raises
import prices and can fan inflation pressures, though traders took
his comments as a sign he doesn't think the currency's too weak.
<p>
   ``Issing's a right-winger, always vigilant on inflation,''
Scarlatos said. ``Now he's making comments that are somewhat
dovish.'' That's prompting traders to buy dollars, he said.
<p>
   The dollar fell against the mark in European trading after
comments by Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept
alive expectations that the central bank was poised to raise its
benchmark interest rate. Higher rates would boost the mark by
making some assets denominated in it more alluring.
<p>
   Gaddum said the market is right to expect higher money market
rates in the run-up to monetary union.
<p>
   Boosting confidence in the mark is a growing sense that
``Germany is recovering and that recovery is happening at a much
faster rate than previously forecast,'' said Lehman Brothers'
Savage.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed at 1.4511 Swiss francs from 1.4503
francs yesterday, and at 5.9055 French francs from 5.9165 francs.
The dollar was unchanged at 1719 Italian lire. Canada's dollar was
little changed at 72.24 U.S. cents from 72.29 cents.

    &UR; ATTN: Expected to re-top following Gov. Winter's speech at 10
p.m. EDT.
 &UR; FOUR DECADES LATER, DESEGREGATION FAR SHORT OF HOPES
<p>
    &UR; By JULIA MALONE &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  &MD;  At the end of a week-long remembrance of the
day nine black students crossed the color barrier into Central High
School here, the debate on Friday turned to whether the clock is
turning backward on desegregation.
<p>
   ``We obviously have not overcome the difficulties of the past,''
said former Mississippi Gov. William Winter in remarks prepared to
open a national conference on race in Central High's auditorium.
<p>
   The two-day discussion, beamed by satellite to 40 cities on
Friday night and Saturday, followed on the heels of Thursday's
celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Little Rock school
crisis.
<p>
   Winter, a member of President Clinton's advisory board on race,
said the desegregation of the nation's public schools since 1957
has been accompanied by ``drastically reduced white enrollment.''
<p>
   By 1980, white students made up only four percent of the public
school enrollment in Washington, D.C., eight percent in Atlanta,
and 12 percent in Detroit, he said.
<p>
   Even so, Winter, an education reformer in his home state during
the 1980s, called for a renewed push to bring the races together in
schools.
<p>
   ``There must first of all be an understanding that we shall
succeed (as a competitive nation) only by making our schools places
where students not only learn how to make a living but also how to
live together,'' he said.
<p>
   Earlier, at the University of Arkansas campus here, scholars
also raised questions about the future of desegregation.
<p>
   ``The resolve for integration has weakened'' among whites and
blacks, said David Goldfield, a history professor at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte.
<p>
   Goldfield said that among some blacks it has now become
``fashionable'' to look back with nostalgia on era of segregation,
when they lived in communities where the businesses were
black-owned and families intact, he said.
<p>
   Alton Hornsby, history professor at Morehouse College in
Atlanta, concurred. ``Many blacks believe that there were certain
values in those insular communities during segregation,'' he said,
adding that he did not share the nostalgic mood.
<p>
   Nor does John Hope Franklin, the octogenarian chairman of
President Clinton's advisory council on race and a leading
African-American historian, who dismissed the idea of returning to
a bygone era.
<p>
   ``Anyone who wants to go back there wasn't there the last
time,'' he said. ``I was there.
<p>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Even so, scholars and others joined expressing disappointment at
the unfulfilled hopes of the U.S. civil rights era.
<p>
   John Walker, the lead attorney in the ongoing case against the
Little Rock school district, said in an interview, ``The fairness
that desegregated schools promised was never realized.''
<p>
   Walker's chief complaint now is that the city school system,
anxious to keep as many white students as possible, bends over
backward to assist whites. He is especially rankled by the fact
that some 60 percent of the white students at Central High School
are in advanced courses, while blacks predominate in the all of the
other levels.
<p>
   ``What you have in Little Rock is white flight,'' Walker said.
``So every white child is an asset to the school.''
<p>
   Goldfield said such policies are a ``major thrust'' in urban
school districts, where black students are generally bused longer
distances. ``The greatest burden is still on the black children,''
he said. ``The policy is to keep middle class white families'' in
the system.

   Arlington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- US Airways Group Inc.'s
passenger-service workers will vote Monday on whether to join the
Communications Workers of America union, in a second vote mandated
after company actions were found to have invalidated a January vote
against the union.
<p>
   The employees will join the union if at least half of the
eligible 8,800 gate, reservations and ticket agents at US Airways
vote in favor of membership, said union spokeswoman Candice
Johnson. While the union would represent all 10,000 such workers at
the Arlington, Virginia-based airline, only the 8,800 agents
employed as of April 23, 1996, may vote.
<p>
   At least half the employees must vote for the election to be
valid and if a worker doesn't vote, he or she effectively casts a
'no' vote. The union had to get at least 30 percent of the
employees to sign a petition in order to call for the vote, Johnson
said.
<p>
   The National Mediation Board invalidated the January election
after finding that the airline's communication with employees
through its ``roundtable'' program interfered with the election
process. The union fell 280 votes shy of winning in that election.
<p>
   US Airways challenged the board's decision in federal court. The
case is pending.
<p>
   A vote in favor of unionization would make this the largest
successful labor union drive at a private company since machinists
at Northwest Airlines Inc. voted to join a union in 1987, the
Communications Workers said.
<p>
   US Airways stock fell 9/16 to 40 7/8.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Hungary and Slovakia have six
months to iron out their differences over a 1977 agreement to build
two power plants on the Danube River before they must return to the
International Court of Justice for a final ruling.
<p>
   The international court, an arm of the United Nations, ruled
yesterday that Hungary and Slovakia breached the agreement, and set
guidelines for settling the dispute, which has marred relations
between the two neighbors. Talks will focus on compensation, and
joint operation of Danube River navigation.
<p>
   ``We have six months to come to an agreement with the Slovaks,''
Hungarian Foreign Minister Laslo Kovacs said in an interview with
Bloomberg News. In a couple of days time we can start the talks.''
<p>
   Hungarian ministers will first consult members of the governing
coalition, then five opposition political parties, before starting
negotiations with the Slovaks. ``If we do not come to terms with
the Slovaks, then we have to return to the Hague court after six
months.''
<p>
   Hungarian parties will form a committee to help the Hungarian
delegation that will negotiate with Slovakia on a final agreement,
government and opposition spokesmen said today after a meeting of
representatives of six parties.
<p>
   Talks may succeed now because neither Hungary nor Slovakia will
expect the court to rule in either government's favor the next
time, Kovacs said.
<p>
   The international court, based in the Hague, Netherlands, ruled
that Hungary illegally broke the 1997 agreement with the former
Czechoslovakia by unilaterally canceling construction of one of the
power plants. For its part, Czechoslovakia abrogated the treaty
when it diverted the Danube, a river that forms the border between
the two countries for 150 kilometers (93 miles). The Hague court
may be suggesting adoption of a ``zero option'' in compensation
talks between Hungary and Slovakia, under which ``neither the
Slovaks nor the Hungarians pay a penny,'' Kovacs said.
<p>
   Kovacs said he doesn't expect the Hague's ruling to further mar
Hungary's relations with Slovakia. ``I don't think it will have a
further negative impact on our relations.''
<p>
   A 1995 treaty between Hungary and Slovakia has helped to improve
relations in areas such as trade, economic cooperation and the
creation of four new checkpoints along their common border, Kovacs
said. Still, ``there is one burning issue, and that is the rights
of minorities,'' since there are 600,000 ethnic Hungarian in
Slovakia and 100,000 ethnic Slovaks in Hungary, he said.
<p>
   ``We feel that the Hungarians there do not have their rights in
harmony with the major international, or European, human rights and
minority rights documents.''
<p>
   Separately, Kovacs said he expects Hungarian voters to
overwhelmingly approve the country's planned entry into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in a referendum Nov. 16.
<p>
   ``I'm absolutely certain that the outcome of the referendum will
be positive, because the latest poll suggests that more than 60
percent (of voters) support it, and among those who will certainly
participate, support is much higher at 75 percent,'' Kovacs said.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Three members of GNI Group's
commodity trading team quit in the past two weeks, cutting the New
York-based commodity trading team to five.
<p>
   Doug Blodgett, who left GNI Group today, was an associate
director at the firm in New York, which he joined 16 months ago
along with two colleagues from Daiwa Securities Co.
<p>
   With his colleagues, Michael Cooke, who left the firm on Sept.
15 and Sharon Powell, who quit on Sept, 18, Blodgett traded
commodity futures and foreign exchange.
<p>
   They joined GNI with a ``mandate to build a fund management side
of the business that raised and allocated money to commodity
trading advisors outside the firm,'' Blodgett said.
<p>
   The three resigned because ``there wasn't the support to build
the business,'' he said. With the resignations, there are now five
commodity traders left in GNI's New York office.
<p>
   GNI Group, a futures, options and foreign exchange brokerage,
added five traders to its commodity trading desk in New York on
March 15. One of those traders, Barry Leonard, left the firm
shortly after joining.
<p>
   Blogdett, who said he has job offers but no new job yet, said
Cooke and Powell joined Credit Lyonnais Rouse USA Ltd.
<p>
   Officials at Credit Lyonnais Rouse USA Ltd weren't available for

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Pete Rose applied for
reinstatement to Major League Baseball, which could make the
sport's all-time hits leader eligible for the Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Rose accepted a lifetime ban imposed in 1989 by
then-Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti for misconduct related to
gambling. Rose steadfastly maintains that he never bet on baseball,
although he said he bet on other sports.
<p>
   In a two-sentence statement, acting Commissioner Bud Selig said
the application would be ``handled in due course.'' In the absence
of a commissioner, the executive council will have the final say on
the petition.
<p>
   ``I just hope they approach it with an open mind,'' Rose said
during the opening of his radio show on SPORTSFAN radio in Las
Vegas.
<p>
   His son, Pete Jr., said his father belongs in baseball.
<p>
   ``I hope they let him back in because he deserves it,'' said the
younger Rose, who plays third base for the Cincinnati Reds. ``He's
one of the best that ever played. He's my idol.''
<p>
   Rose said he made the decision to seek reinstatement after
receiving an ovation from the fans when his son made his major
league debut with the Reds on Sept. 1.
<p>
   ``I just hope that the lords that be in baseball see how much
the people like me in this country,'' Rose said.
<p>
   Rose spent 19 seasons in the major leagues as a player, amassing
4,256 career hits and posting a lifetime batting average of .303.
<p>
   He also managed the Reds from 1984-1989.
<p>
   Baseball's rules prohibit players and managers from betting on
baseball games.

   Southfield, Michigan, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal-Mogul
Corp. offered to buy U.K. auto-parts maker T&AMP;N Plc for about $2.4
billion in cash and assumed debt, seeking the ability to deliver
more-complete engine systems that help automakers cut costs.
<p>
   The offer of $3.78 a share, or about $2.0 billion, was 29
percent more than T&AMP;N's closing price yesterday. T&AMP;N stock rose
60.5 pence to 242.5 pence, or about $3.90 a share, indicating
investors expect Federal-Mogul will have to raise its bid.
Southfield, Michigan-based Federal-Mogul, the world's largest maker
of bearings and bushings, gains access to T&AMP;N's line of other
engine parts through the acquisition. It's the latest of several
consolidations driven by automakers, who want to cut their own
assembly costs by forcing suppliers to build whole systems, not
just individual parts.
<p>
   ``It fits very well with their stated strategy,'' said Ron
Tadross, a Salomon Brothers analyst. ``In one fell swoop they could
accomplish a lot in terms of getting toward their goal.''
Federal-Mogul shares rose 3 3/4 to close at 37 1/4, spurred by
investors who believe the purchase will improve earnings
immediately, said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In addition, Federal-Mogul's increased size is
expected to help it maintain margins, which are being squeezed by
automakers, analysts said. The purchase of T&AMP;N, which had $3.0
billion in revenue in 1996, is ``a great fit for us,''
Federal-Mogul spokeswoman Kimberly Welch said. Federal-Mogul's 1996
revenue was $2.03 billion.
<p>
   In one example of how the partsmaker could deliver a more
complete system, Welch said Federal-Mogul's own bearings could be
used in engines that also use T&AMP;N's pistons and cam shafts. The
move also expands the Michigan company's global reach. Welch
wouldn't comment on whether Federal-Mogul will end up raising its
bid because of the increase in T&AMP;N's share price. Federal-Mogul
began restructuring shortly after Richard Snell became its chief
executive in November 1996, selling its retail operations to focus
on manufacturing. The company took a $204 million charge in the
fourth quarter to pay for the restructuring, which is about
two-thirds complete. Snell has indicated he wants Federal-Mogul to
be a $10 billion company, analyst Needham said. ``This acquisition
brings them half way there,'' she said.
<p>
   Yet this acquisition, as well as any future ones, may hurt
Federal-Mogul's credit quality, said Sean Egan, managing director
of Egan-Jones Rating Co.
<p>
   ``This acquisition is huge, relative to Federal-Mogul's total
assets of $1.4 billion,'' Egan said. ``This acquisition alone is
big enough to damage its credit quality.'' Federal-Mogul won't be
slowed in its plan to continue growing through acquisitions, Welch
said.
<p>
   Federal Mogul's 1996 profit from continuing operations fell 15
percent to $34.7 million, or 74 cents a share, from $40.8 million,
or 92 cents, in 1995.
<p>
   After charges in both years, it had a final loss of $211
million, or $6.26 a share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or
53 cents, in 1995.
<p>
   Federal-Mogul is expected to earn 35 cents a share in the third
quarter, based on the average of six analysts surveyed by IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   Neither the company nor analysts could immediately determine how
much the acquisition would improve earnings.
<p>
   T&AMP;N, formerly the U.K.'s largest maker of asbestos, has been
vulnerable to a bid since it took a $596.8 million charge last year
to insulate it against future liability from asbestos litigation,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``We felt that because they'd put an effective cap on asbestos
liability they could be vulnerable to the U.S.,'' said Zafar Khan,
an analyst at SGST Securities. However, investors are more likely
to accept a bid around $4.19 a share, he said.
<p>
   The bid comes a month after Trafford Park, Manchester-based T&AMP;N
said profit more than doubled in the first half, even as its
biggest auto-parts customers in western Europe and North America
saw vehicle output rise just 2 percent in the period. T&AMP;N said it
is considering the bid with its adviser, N M Rothschild &AMP; Sons Ltd.
<p>
   Federal-Mogul has operations in the U.S., Mexico, Germany,
Canada, Italy, Belgium, Wales, Argentina, and Japan.
<p>
   In 1996, about 11 percent of the Federal-Mogul's sales were from
the three major U.S. automakers. It also sells to Germany's
Volkswagen AG and Daimler-Benz as well as France's Renault SA and
Italy's Fiat Spa.

 &UR; LATIN BUSINESS BRIEFS: MEXICO SEEKING $2 BILLION CREDIT LINE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Maureen Webb &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Following is a snapshot of
today's major business stories in Latin America:
<p>
   (Mexico City) -- Mexico is seeking a credit line of between $2
billion and $3 billion from a group of eight international banks.
<p>
   Lukas Muhlemann, chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston,
confirmed the plans for a loan in a press briefing earlier this
week after he met with President Ernesto Zedillo..
<p>
   Mexico is seeking ``a market mechanism that will help prevent
future contingencies,'' said Muhlemann, according to a transcript
of the press conference.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry approached the banks, all of which have
offices in Mexico, in search of the credit line to help the central
bank battle any speculative attack against the currency or
unexpected turmoil in the nation's financial markets.
<p>
   (Caracas) -- Venezuela said it expects to conclude an extension
of a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary
Fund in November, ending several months of negotiations.
<p>
   Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar said the government is
confident that an agreement will be reached because the IMF is
backing the country's economic program, which started in April 1996
with the lifting of price and foreign exchange restrictions.
<p>
   A final draft of the agreement is expected in late October when
an IMF technical mission visits the country. The mission will be
accompanied by Claudio Loscher, the IMF official who oversees Latin
America.
<p>
   ``They will submit the agreement to the IMF board of
directors,'' Matos Azocar said from Brussels during a satellite
news conference with reporters in Caracas. ``The stand-by agreement
will be discussed (by the IMF) in November, and if approved, it
will be effected in 1998.''
Spain's BBV Acknowledged Talks With BCN
<p>
   (Sao Paulo) -- Banco de Credito Nacional SA, Brazil's
fifth-largest investor-owned bank, acknowledged that it had held
discussions with Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya SA. Both banks denied
press reports that BBV had agreed to take over BCN.
<p>
   BBV also earlier told Spanish stock market regulators that it
had held discussions with a number of Brazilian banks, as part of
its plan to invest $800 million for a ``significant market share''
in Brazil's banking industry. BBV characterized its talks with
Brazilian banks as ``priority objectives.''
<p>
   Brazil's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper reported that BBV, Spain's
second largest commercial bank, would spend about $1 billion to buy
a 51 percent stake in a holding company that controls BCN, Brazil's
fifth-largest investor-owned bank.
Chile Government Proposes Spending Increase
<p>
   (Santiago) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei proposed a 1998
budget that includes a 12.6 percent increase in spending, fueled by
higher outlays for social programs.
<p>
   Frei's 8 trillion peso budget ($19.32 billion) is expected to
run into opposition from right-wing leaders in the Chilean Congress
because it includes boosts in spending for education, health,
social security and other programs aimed at the poor.
<p>
   Overall spending on social programs would rise 8 percent in
Frei's budget proposal, part of an election-year push to allocate
more resources for lower income Chileans.
<p>
   The budget includes a 17 percent increase in spending on
education, to build new schools, hire more teachers and provide
more university scholarships for underprivileged Chileans. It also
includes increases in spending on roads and other infrastructure
projects and pensions for the elderly.
Venezuela's Vepica/Baker Venture Sees Growth
<p>
   (Caracas) -- Venezolana de Proyectos Integrados CA, an
industrial service companies, said it expects revenue from its
venture with Michael Baker Corp., a U.S. engineering company, to
double in each of the next four years.
<p>
   The joint venture will concentrate on the oil industry, and
expects to find additional opportunities in the petrochemical and
electricity industries, said Miguel Bocco, president of Projectos
Integrados, a company known as Vepica.
<p>
   Vepica and the energy unit of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based
Michael Baker each own a 50 percent stakes in Vepica/Baker
Operations and Maintenance CA.
<p>
   The venture clinched its first major contract last week when
British Petroleum Co. selected it to operate its Pedernales field
in eastern Venezuela, Bocco said.
Degussa Plans Brazil Plant to Meet Rubber Demand
<p>
   (Frankfurt) -- Degussa AG, a German chemicals and metals maker,
said it plans to build a carbon black plant in Brazil to meet
rising demand for tires and other rubber products.
<p>
   Financial terms weren't disclosed, and it didn't say where the
plant would be.
<p>
   The plant is expected to begin operating at the end of 1999,
Degussa said, and will have an initial production capacity of
50,000 tons of the pigment a year.
<p>
   ``During the next three years the car industry is planning to
invest $21 billion in Brazil, making it the fifth-largest car
manufacturing base in the world,'' Degussa said in a statement.
``Demand for tires and technical rubber goods will rise steadily.''
<p>
   (Geneva) -- SGS SA, the world's largest provider of goods
inspection for international trade, said it is competing with five
rivals for Argentine contracts worth about $440 million to inspect
automotive and consumer goods.
<p>
   SGS said yesterday it was among six inspection companies
accredited by the Argentine government to carry out the
inspections, which are designed to minimize tax evasion and promote
fair competition, the Geneva-based company said.
<p>
   Argentine importers of autos, auto parts and consumer goods have
75 days to set up inspection schemes with one of the accredited
inspection companies, said Friedrich Sauerlaender, an SGS
spokesman.
<p>
   ``Last year's figures show that the combined imports were worth
$5 billion to $6 billion,'' said Sauerlaender. ``The inspection fee
is 0.8 percent of this.''
Merrill Lynch Expanding to Latin America
<p>
   (New York) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said it's putting more
resources in Latin America to try to become a larger financial
force in the region and take advantage of growth there.
<p>
   Recent moves include naming Keith Horn, a longtime Merrill
investment banker who most recently served as the assistant to the
chairman and the president, to be co-head of Merrill's Latin
America Debt Capital Markets Group. The company also created a
credit research group to focus on Latin America, primarily composed
of its emerging markets credit research team in New York.
<p>
   In the past two years most of the acquisitions Merrill has made
outside the U.S. have been in Europe and Asia.
<p>
   Merrill executives said the company expects to increase its
presence in Latin American countries in the next few years by
increasing staff and expanding its securities business there. That
may include getting new seats on Latin American stock exchanges,
entering into joint ventures or making minority investments in
other firms. (Bogota) -- Assailants blew up an oil pipeline in
Colombia two days after workers repaired damage from an earlier
attack, oil industry spokesmen said.
<p>
   The transportation of oil was temporarily halted. Occidental
Petroleum Co. said it is slowly reducing output at the Cano Limon
field until the pipeline is repaired. Oil will be pumped into
nearby storage tanks that can hold 500,000 barrels of oil, or three
days worth of production.
<p>
   ``We are in the usual process of gradually reducing
production,'' a spokesman for Occidental in Bogota said.
<p>
   No one immediately took responsibility for the attack, the 51st
so far this year. The attack brings to 493 the number of bombings
on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline since 1985, said a spokesman for
Occidental Petroleum Co.
<p>
   (Monterrey) -- A recent visit to Fomento Economico Mexicano SA
left money manager Steve Oler impressed with how the beer brewer
and Coca-Cola bottler has taken its Sol beer brand from regional
obscurity to national status.
<p>
   It's part of a ``cultural change'' in which Monterrey-based
Femsa whipped its operations into shape in time to cash in as
Mexicans spend more following the country's worst recession since
the 1930s, said Oler, chief of Latin America operations for the
Putman Emerging Markets Fund.
<p>
   Mexican shoppers are back, pushing up consumer buying 6.9
percent in the second quarter of 1997 from a year earlier.
<p>
   ``Femsa is now riding the trend of rising consumer spending as
well as being a refocused company that is playing to the strength
of its brands the way it hasn't in the past years,'' said Oler,
whose firm's funds together own about $80 million of Femsa shares.

even though he pleaded guilty Thursday to repeatedly biting a
female sex partner.
<p>
   While the company hasn't shipped the product to stores, an
Acclaim spokesman said finding a replacement for Albert and
re-recording sound for the game would delay shipping and cost too
much money. Acclaim shares rose 43 percent yesterday in part
because titles designed for the Nintendo 64 machine, such as the
game Albert's voice appears on, will get a sales boost at Christmas
because there's a shortage of titles for the popular game system,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``There's no way we could get these games into stores in time
for Christmas,'' said Kathryn Morris, a spokeswoman for Acclaim.
``We have too many commitments with retailers.''
<p>
   Acclaim said it didn't make a back-up version of the game using
another announcer because Albert assured the company he was
innocent on all charges stemming from an incident where he was
accused of biting a woman and forcing her to perform oral sex.
<p>
   When asked whether the company would sue Albert for possible
lost revenue, Morris said Acclaim would be issuing a statement on
that sometime next week.
<p>
   ``NFL Quarterback Club '98 went into production prior to the
start of Mr. Albert's trial and does include his play-by-play,''
Morris said. ``Acclaim's decision after the indictment to keep Mr.
Albert's voice in the game was directly based on his assurances of
innocence to our company.''
<p>
   Acclaim said the game should be available in stores at the
beginning of November. The company is hoping to sell at least
100,000 copies, analysts said.
<p>
   Acclaim's agreement with Albert was revealed three days after
his May 20 indictment and is worth around $2 million. The length of
the agreement was undisclosed.
<p>
   Albert, one of the best-known play-by-play announcers in the
history of sports broadcasting, was fired by NBC a few hours after
he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge. Shortly after
Albert was let go by NBC, he resigned from his other broadcast
outlet, Madison Square Garden Network.
<p>
   Albert was in his 20th season with NBC and was its top
basketball announcer and an important part of its football
broadcasts.
<p>
   NFL Quarterback Club is the only NFL-licensed Nintendo 64 video
game. For the past four years, Acclaim has been the exclusive video
game licensee of the NFL Quarterback Club, an association of top
quarterbacks such as Dan Marino, Steve Young and Brett Favre.
<p>
   Acclaim shares fell 1/8 to 5 5/8 today after rising 1 23/32 to 5
3/4 yesterday.
<p>
   Morris said it hasn't decided what announcer will do
play-by-play on NFL Quarterback Club '99, although it probably
won't be Albert.
<p>
   ``We're evaluating the situation,'' Morris said.
<p>
   Morris declined to comment on whether the game could become a
collector's item.
<p>
   ``We're hoping that the game sells well, that's been our goal
all along,'' Morris said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain  &MD;  Colin Montgomerie, Seve Ballesteros, and a
few other members of the European Ryder Cup team that opened its
defense against the US Friday had taken a few mild shots at Tiger
Woods before the competition. The gist was that he was merely one
of 12 players on the American team, that any one of the 12
Europeans could beat him in match play  &MD;  and Montgomerie said he
wanted him in the Sunday singles.
<p>
   Well, as the pairings were doled out for the four-ball
competition that began after a rain delay of 1 hour 40 minutes,
Montgomerie got part of his wish. He and Bernhard Langer met Woods
and Mark O'Meara. After the four matches were completed with the
teams splitting, 2-2, the same grouping went out in the afternoon
foursomes.
<p>
   As it transpired, Montgomerie's team was routed in the morning
before returning the favor as daylight expired with two matches
still on the course, leaving the teams even at 3-3 entering the
second day of the three-day, 28-match competition.
<p>
   After the storm drenched the region with the most rainfall in
eight years, it was remarkable that six of the eight matches were
played to a decision. There was a mild disagreement when the US
team of Jeff Maggert and Justin Leonard asked to suspend play as
they approached the 16th green trailing Englishmen Nick Faldo and
Lee Westwood by two. The match between Tom Lehman and Phil
Mickelson of the US and Jesper Parnevik of Sweden and Ignacio
Garrido of Madrid was all square when it was suspended after the
13th hole.
<p>
   While Faldo and Westwood wanted to continue, Parnevik asked to
suspend his match until Saturday morning. ``The agreement states
that if any one player decides that it's too dark to play, they
have that option,'' said US captain Tom Kite. ``When we officially
stopped play, it was 8:20 and all day they were saying if we got a
little past 8, we'd be very lucky. It was dark. It's a crucial putt
for us. We need to make the putt. I would not have them
second-guess any reads. I felt comfortable with it.''
<p>
   It was transformed into a special day of golf when play began at
10:40 a.m. over a course that had dried surprisingly well in the
plateaus above the Mediterranean. The galleries may have been down
slightly because of erroneous reports that the matches had been
canceled, but they grew and became more enthuiastic by the hour.
The Woods-Montgomerie flap had stirred some emotions, and the
largest morning galleries followed their match. Woods-O'Meara never
trailed en route to a 3-and-2 victory.
<p>
   The reverse was true in the alternate-shot play as Montgomerie
and Langer managed their games beautifully and never trailed in a
5-and-3 triumph. There were still sufficient moments of high drama
that prompted Kite to state that ``those so-called experts who said
there was going to be a blowout one way or another were proven
wrong.''
<p>
   Ballesteros spoke for the Europeans in his role as captain. ``I
think both sides are displaying high quality,'' he said after using
only nine of his 12 team members, while Kite deployed everybody.
<p>
   Parnevik, who was one of the two captain's picks named by
Ballesteros, teamed with countryman Per-Ulrik Johansson to stage a
stirring comeback against Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk after losing two
of the first three holes. They won the eighth and ninth to go 1 up,
built it to 2 up after the 14th, but lost the 15th and 16th before
Parnevik's 6-foot birdie putt won the 17th for a 1-up lead they
preserved on Parnevik's 6-foot putt on the final hole.
<p>
   There was considerable vindication in the morning four-ball for
Brad Faxon of Barrington, R.I. When he failed to get it up and down
out of a trap two years ago in these matches at Oak Hill against
David Gilford of Great Britain, Faxon lost a critical Sunday match.
This time he faced a similar situation while paired with Fred
Couples against Faldo and Westwood. Once Couples bogeyed and Faldo
missed a halving putt from just outside 7 feet, Faxon sank a 6-foot
putt to halve the hole out of a trap and lead his team to a 1-up
victory.
<p>
   Mickelson was disconsolate when he missed the same putt Faxon
made to enable Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain and Costantino Rocca of
Italy to beat him and Davis Love, 1 up, in the morning. But that
was offset by the stirring finish of Scott Hoch, who calmly stroked
a putt of just over 6 feet squarely into the hole, giving him and
Lee Janzen a 1-up decision over Rocca and Olazabal.

<p>
   Glen Cove, New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Although Marv
Albert won't be broadcasting for NBC this football season, he'll be
doing play-by-play in hundreds of thousands of homes later this
year.
<p>
   Acclaim Entertainment Inc. said Albert's voice will be used to
provide play-by-play for its video game, NFL Quarterback Club '98,
even though he pleaded guilty Thursday to repeatedly biting a
female sex partner.
<p>
   While the company hasn't shipped the product to stores, an

<p>
   Bogota, Sept 26 (Bloomberg) -- Colombian stocks were little
changed as a rally that boosted share prices more than 3 percent
over the past week ran out of steam.
<p>
   ``The market is stable and something has to go way up or down
before things start to move,'' said Ricardo Arteaga, a trader at
Consorcio Bursatil SA brokerage firm.
<p>
   Bogota's IBB index nudged up just over half a point, or 0.03
percent, to 1,456.16. trading totaled 5.65 billion pesos ($4.5
million), mostly on trading of cement maker Cemento Argos SA, which
closed down a peso to 9,029. Of 16 stocks that changed price, nine
rose and seven fell.
<p>
   Medellin's Ibomed index fell 45.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to
close at 21,410.47. Trading totaled 6.4 billion pesos. Of 20 stocks
that changed price, 14 fell and six rose.
<p>
   For the week, the IBB index rose 2.3 percent, while the Ibomed
rose 1.5 percent.
<p>
   In Bogota, Brewer Bavaria SA rose today by 140 pesos to 12,590,
going above its book value price for the first time this year.
Banco de Bogota SA fell 49 pesos to 7,051.
<p>
   Banco de Colombia SA fell 6 pesos to 470 on concern that the
examination of the bank being carried out by officials from Banco
Industrial Colombiano SA, which has agreed to buy it, may encounter
hitches.
<p>
   ``People aren't comfortable with the fact that we haven't heard
anything new on the subject for a while,'' said Jaime Andres
Fonseca , a trader at Colbolsa SA brokerage firm.
<p>
   BIC could pay at least $679 million for Banco de Colombia. The
purchase would make it the country's largest bank.
<p>
   In Medellin, food company Industrias Alimenticias Noel SA
plunged 800 pesos, or 15.38 percent, after the company's decision
to issue shares locally rather than abroad was followed by the
resignation of its president, Rafael Mario Villa. Villa is expected
to join the campaign of conservative party mayoral candidate Juan
Gomez Martinez, who is running for office in Medellin.
<p>
   He has been largely credited with bringing about alliances with
foreign food companies such as Mexico's Bimbo and Heinz.
<p>
   Supermarket chain Carulla SA rose 80 pesos to 5,280. The stock
has shown periods of volatility these past few months, falling as
much as 38 percent in a single day. Insurance company Suramericana
de Seguros SA rose 60 pesos to 29,300.
<p>
   In New York, shares of Banco Ganadero SA rose 1/4 to 40 3/8.
Banco Industrial Colombiano SA rose 9/16 to 17 1/8.
<p>
   The peso closed stronger against the dollar, at 1,240.5 pesos to
the dollar, compared with the opening price of 1,241.91 pesos.

<p>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain  &MD;  Seve Ballesteros put a lot of miles on his
blue-and-gold designer golf cart Friday. He was a Ryder Cup Rommel,
commanding his forces on the field of battle for the better part of
10 hours.
<p>
   Europe's answer to Arnold Palmer, team captain Ballesteros used
binoculars, walkie-talkies, and a radio in his ear to keep track of
morning four-balls and afternoon foursomes. He rode his custom cart
across every fairway at Valderrama and willed his defending
champion team to a 3-3 tie on the first day of Ryder Cup play.
<p>
   The start was delayed 1 hour 40 minutes by a thunderstorm of
Biblical proportions on the Andalucian coast. Early Friday, a mass
of cold air from the west clashed with the hot, humid air over
North Africa, producing a violant and dazzling mix of thunder,
lightning, and rain over the Mediterranean.
<p>
   At 8 a.m., the communications director of the Ryder Cup issued a
statement advising all spectators to remain in their hotels and
homes while keeping in touch via radio reports. This proved to be
poor advice for those who heard a local radio station report that
the worst storm in 10 years had washed out the entire tournament.
<p>
   Not so. The storm kept many fans home but didn't have much
effect on play and certainly didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the
ubiquitous European captain.
<p>
   Seve cares, and it shows. That's what makes him so Spanish, so
European, so unlike just about every American player and coach in
Ryder '97. The Europeans always seem to be having more fun in this
event (Colin ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' Montgomerie excepted), and the
handsome, dashing Ballesteros sets the tone with his hands-on
coaching. He is the Zorro of the Ryder Cup.
<p>
   Friday morning, when the Swedish team of Jesper Parnevik and
Per-Ulrik Johansson fell behind by two after five holes,
Ballesteros arrived in his open-air fairway tank, gave them a pep
talk, then watched them win three of the next four. On 18, he ran
through the ropes to set up a shot Johansson needed to get out of
trouble. It was the performance of the Swedes that enabled Europe
to split the morning four-balls.
<p>
   Ballesteros was everywhere, wheeling his cart up to the ropes,
then asking gallery flies to tell him which player had hit the best
shot. Try to imagine Bill Parcells turning to fans behind the bench
and asking if the Jets have enough yardage for a first down.
<p>
   Montgomerie acknowledged, ``His intensity in trying to beat
Americans is second to none, and it's showing.''
<p>
   The dour Montgomerie still remembers sitting in front of
Ballesteros in the final moments of Ryder Cup '95. When Philip
Walton's Cup-winning putt landed in the hole, a joyous Seve kicked
Montgomerie in the back, then vaulted onto the green and embraced
heroic Nick Faldo and Faldo's then wife, Gill.
<p>
   Not many American players are huge Ballesteros fans. Seve has
been accused of coughing when opponents are putting, breaking
rules, charging opponents with cheating, and generally doing
anything he can think of to disrupt his rivals.
<p>
   He spent a million dollars redesigning the 17th hole at
Valderrama (replete with water, a slippery bank, and three bunkers
over the green) and plans to use his knowledge of the hole to help
his team win. If the Americans don't like it, Seve says they should
plan to be up by three with two holes to play.
<p>
   ``I designed the 17th hole and I know how it should be played
strategically,'' said Ballesteros. ``When my players are playing
the 17th, I will use my experience and I can tell them the way it
should be played, which will have some influence in favor of the
Europeans.''
<p>
   These are the words of a proud man, one who wants to defend the
Cup on his home soil. This is Spain. This is Seve's House.
<p>
   Europe won only one Cup in 50 years before the tourney was
expanded to include countries outside Great Britain in 1979.
Ballesteros played on eight Ryder teams, including four which
either won or tied for the Cup.
<p>
   Born to humble means in the north of Spain, he learned golf
using one club  &MD;  a cut-down 3-iron  &MD;  on the beach near his home.
Now 40 years old and no longer a force on the Tour, he is without
doubt the best golfer in his country's history and one of the most
charismatic players to grace the European or American Tour.
<p>
   When he won the Masters in 1980 at the age of 23, he was the
youngest champion in the tourney's history (21-year-old Tiger Woods
displaced him last spring). From 1979-88, he won five majors.
<p>
   And he always had a flair. Never one to stay on the fairways,
Ballesteros won his first British Open with a shot from a parking
lot. He delighted the international press with his fire and candor.
Asked to describe a four-putt at Augusta National, he said, ``I
miss, I miss, I miss, I make.''
<p>
   He marrried Carmen Botin, daughter of Emilio Botin, one of the
richest men in the world, and today his legal residence is the tax
haven of Monaco. He spent part of Wednesday giving Prince Andrew a
tour of Valderrama.
<p>
   He feuded with wealthy countryman Jimmy Patino when the latter
petitioned to bring the Ryder Cup to Valderrama. In an attempt to
feather his own business interests, Ballesteros fought to bring the
Cup to a course near Cadiz. It was instead awarded to Valderrama,
where Seve changed the rules of play.
<p>
   Ballesteros was widely critized when he bumped Spaniard Miguel
Angel Martin in favor of his friend Jose Maria Olazabal. The gamble
paid an early dividend Friday when Olazabal and Costantino Rocca
won their four-ball.
<p>
   He is coaching the way he played, with great emotion and without
fear.

<p>
   DALLAS  &MD;  Revolution coach Thomas Rongen answered a phone call in
the Cotton Bowl locker room from franchise owners Jonathan and
Robert Kraft after the team had clinched the final Major League
Soccer Eastern Conference playoff berth Thursday.
<p>
   Presumably asked to explain the Revolution's recovery to win
three of their final four regular-season games, capped by the 2-1
victory over Dallas, Rongen said, ``We have Zenga.''
<p>
   Indeed, Walter Zenga became nearly a one-man show for the
Revolution, who were on the way to becoming the only MLS team to
miss the playoffs in both of its seasons.
<p>
   With Zenga, the Revolution earned 37 points in 22 games. Without
him, they were 0-10.
<p>
   Zenga returned from arthroscopic knee surgery just in time to
rescue the Revolution from a last-place finish. It was a dramatic
reappearance, worthy of an ``Amazing Adventures of Spiderman''
(Zenga's nickname) plot. Zenga again made several improbable saves
as the Revolution defense degenerated into chaos without sweeper
Francis Okaroh, who aggravated a groin injury. He also displayed
quick reflexes in stopping Dallas counters with the Revolution in
all-out attack mode late in the game.
<p>
   ``I hate to say a goalkeeper could have that much effect,''
Rongen said. ``But one player made a very huge difference for us.
Zenga was the one constant when we have won games.''
<p>
   Rongen should be credited for pursuing Zenga when he was offered
to the league in February. Then Rongen had other plans for
goalkeeper and hoped to use foreign allocations for field players.
But he realized Zenga's impact could be great, though Zenga was no
longer playing for the Italian national team or in Serie A.
<p>
   Also, Rongen's tactical choices paid off late in the season. He
used Argentines Alberto Naveda and Leonardo Squadrone in different
roles and tried Paul Keegan, who scored the winning goal against
Dallas, as an outside midfielder. Rongen's timing was right for the
Revolution's offensive assault, and he capitalized on some
ill-advised substitutions by Dallas, especially the replacement of
Mexican striker Damian with Dante Washington. By the final minutes,
the Dallas defense was off balance, Joe-Max Moore hit the crossbar,
and Keegan just missed a close-in shot before the winning goal.
<p>
   Now the Revolution will have until Oct. 5 to prepare for D.C.
United in the first round of the playoffs. They will need that time
to recover, especially Okaroh and Imad Baba (hip). But though D.C.
United is the defending MLS champion and has the best record in the
league this season, the Revolution feel destined to be victorious
at least once. In four matchups this season, D.C. United won twice
in regulation and outscored the Revolution, 6-4.
<p>
   Plus, the Revolution will have the home-field advantage for the
second game of the best-of-three series Oct. 8 at Foxboro Stadium.
More than 6,500 tickets have been purchased for that game,
confirming the loyalty of Revolution fans.
<p>
   ``We had a lot of season ticket-holders re-up during our
nine-game losing streak,'' general manager Brian O'Donovan said.
``This game is an unknown quantity, but I think we can approach
20,000.''
<p>
   In the playoffs, MLS's shootout system for settling ties is
modified. Regulation and shootout wins both are worth 3 points, a
formula which rewards conservative tactics and teams such as the
Revolution, which strongly rely on defense.
<p>
   ``D.C. United is the class of the league, a really talented
team, but we've matched up well with them,'' O'Donovan said. ``In
this tournament, everyone starts out 0-0. There is no reason we
can't claw our way deep into the playoffs. We are a dangerous team.
That has been the identity of this team since its inception, that
they have had to fight against adversity. We'll take that identity
for now, though in the future, we don't want to be in adverse
situations as often.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- There are a couple of ways to
understand the recent purchase of Salomon Inc. by the nebulous
Travelers Group Inc., and one is as a funeral for the Great
Personalities that used to thrive in large Wall Street firms.
<p>
   Since its rise to prominence in the late 1970s the story of
Salomon Brothers has been the story of a band of renegades, less
like conventional businessmen than any men who ever wore suits,
dragged kicking and screaming into mainstream corporate America.
People forget that there was a time in the early 1980s when Salomon
Brothers was so much more profitable than the rest of Wall Street
that it seemed to be in an entirely different business.
<p>
   It WAS in a different business. Its willingness to take huge
risks in the bond market gave it something like a monopoly in that
arena. But the firm was willing to take unusual risks in part
because it was made up of unusual people.
<p>
   The one adjective that served no purpose on the Salomon trading
floor was ``normal.'' The old Salomon Brothers was staffed by all
these wonderful freaks: hugely fat guys who refused to speak
standard English, whippet-thin ulcer addicts as tense as steel
rods.
<p>
   But every day men in gray suits from Harvard Business School
seized a bit more control, leaving the fat guys and the anxiety
addicts with ever less room to maneuver. The Treasury bond scandal
of 1991 merely accelerated a process well underway by the
mid-1980s.
<p>
   The firm that was sold to Travelers on Tuesday for twice its
book value bore no relation to the firm I once worked for and wrote
about. Most of the great characters have moved on: John Gutfreund
and Lewie Ranieri and John Meriwether, of course, but also a raft
of lesser-known bond traders and salesmen who actually made the
firm's money. Larry Hilibrand, Tom Pura, Tom Bernard, Craig Coates,
Mike Mortara, and hundreds more. With these unusual people went the
firm's ability to generate unusual profits.
<p>
   The other way to understand the takeover is as a routine act of
corporate madness: Can you think of a single example of a large
Wall Street acquisition that hasn't ended in tears, or, at least,
groans? Investment bankers were never meant to be owned by larger
corporations: They are simply too adept at taking advantage of
their employers and putative shareholders. (One reason Warren
Buffett is so delighted to be selling is that he's learned this
lesson, the hard way.)
<p>
   But the buyer of Salomon Brothers is especially to be pitied.
Salomon's success has always hinged upon it remaining slightly
outside mainstream corporate culture. To be greatly profitable, the
firm's traders must be allowed behavior that no giant corporation
would ever condone.
<p>
   For instance, the one business in which Salomon retains its
former money-making powers is proprietary trading. Trading the
house account at Salomon Brothers is a bit like being a tailback at
USC: You are, by virtue of your position, destined for greatness.
<p>
   Each year in the 1990s one of these traders (Larry Hilibrand,
Rob Stavis, Victor Haghani, Hans Hufschmid, Shigeru Myojin) has
made off with $20 million-plus, and left the rest of Wall Street
wondering about his peculiar gifts. His gifts were not peculiar. He
was just permitted to do things most traders can only dream of: bet
the house on a hunch.
<p>
   Say what you will about this sort of high-risk trading. But it
is just the sort of business no large, ordinary American
corporation will ever have the nerve to conduct. It sounds good so
long as it is profitable. But there will come a time when Travelers
Chairman Sanford I. Weill will have to explain to his board that
some geek dropped $400 million in Chinese derivatives. And then
what?
<p>
   Of course this takeover is merely one of many similar
transactions transforming Wall Street, so the buyer has the usual
excuse that everyone else is doing it. But you can see where the
creation of giant financial firms will end. It will end with a
financial market in which the biggest money is made, and the most
interesting business is still done, by people who are not in giant
financial firms. The larger firms in New York will serve mainly as
farm clubs for the smaller firms, where the Midases will reside.
<p>
   With each passing day the most talented, ambitious (and lucky)
traders and salesman are learning that the best thing they can do
at Salomon Brothers (or Salomon Smith Barney) is to quit. They all
know that Meriwether is alive and well and waiting for them in his
small and obscenely profitable firm, Long-Term Capital Management
Inc.

<p>
   BOSTON -- Growing up in Cincinnati as a devout Xavier University
fan who played high school football at St. Xavier, Tom O'Brien had
come to regard the University of Cincinnati as the enemy. The
archenemy. But now that time has passed and he has become Boston
College's football coach, O'Brien's feelings toward the Bearcats
have changed.
<p>
   ``I'm 48 now and I left there when I was 17, so I've been gone a
lot longer than I lived there,'' he said when asked if he saw
tonight's BC-Cincinnati game game as a rekindling of a rivalry.
``My family probably does, because they're all Xavier people and
(Cincinnati's) the archrival.''
<p>
   Not for O'Brien. The Bearcats are just the next team on the
schedule when the Eagles (2-1) host the Conference USA visitors
(3-1) at Alumni Stadium.
<p>
   BC's offense, ranked 10th in the nation, will run up against its
stiffest challenge to date, a Cincinnati defense that is patterned
after that of the 1985 Chicago Bears and coordinated, not so
coincidentally, by Buddy Ryan's son Rex.
<p>
   `It's almost like they're a different team than the one we
played last year,'' said quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, who last week
completed 21 of 27 attempts for a career-high 314 yards to guide
the Eagles to a 35-21 victory at Rutgers. ``They're playing a lot
more aggressive than they did last year. This is certainly the best
defense we've seen on film to date this year.''
<p>
   In an impressive 34-7 victory over Kansas last week,
Cincinnati's defense (ranked fifth in the nation vs. the run) shut
down the Jayhawks by limiting them to minus-46 yards rushing while
ringing up seven quarterback sacks and forcing six turnovers (four
fumbles, two interceptions).
<p>
   ``I know it's going to be tough to run and I know that we need
to run in order to make the offense work,'' said BC junior running
back Mike Cloud, the nation's fifth-ranked rusher, who last week
carried 35 times for 166 yards and scored a career-high four
touchdowns. ``I don't think that they're going to hold us down to
negative yards. But when you go against an eight-man front, it's
kind of one-one-one blocking. As long as we can hold our
one-one-one blocking, I think I can hit a couple of creases and
make some things happen.''
<p>
   Cincinnati boasts an elephantine offensive line that averages
306 pounds and quarterback Chad Plummer, a 6-foot-3-inch, 230-pound
junior whom O'Brien said ``is as big as some of our defensive
linemen and linebackers.'' The Bearcats' size advantage could pose
a problem for BC's defense, whose linebacking corps is so decimated
that junior walk-on Brooke Heald will make his first career start
at the inside backer spot.
<p>
   A concern, perhaps?
<p>
   ``Yeah, absolutely,'' O'Brien said. ``You're going up against a
team that outweighs you by 20-30 pounds up front and they're going
to want to run and pound the ball. And then you have to start a kid
who's never been in a college game before.''
<p>
   The good news, O'Brien said, is that Cincinnati is not likely to
deviate from its game plan to run the ball. Neither, for that
matter, will the Eagles. They know it will be important to attack
Cincinnati's eight-man front by controlling the ball with a
balanced attack.
<p>
   ``That's been the game plan for the last three weeks, so why
change now?'' O'Brien said. ``It's going to be a tough challenge
for this football team, but it's not something I don't think we can
overcome. There's always ways to run the football. You just have to
be patient enough and hang in there and be physical and mentally
tough enough to do it. If they blitz you and try to make a big
play, they give you an opportunity to make a big play, and if we
make enough big plays, we should be fine.''
<p>
   About the only thing finer than a victory, O'Brien said, would
be the chance to celebrate it with a taste of one of Cincinnati's
delicacies. ``Skyline chili,'' he said. ``That would be really
nice.''

   Microsoft, the giant computer software company on whose Windows
95 operating system I'm typing this column, is bound and determined
to get deeply into the automobile business.
<p>
   I've reported before about the Microsoft CarPoint Internet Web
site, which has been offering information on new cars for the past
year or so. It also has a new-car buying program on the site that
lets Net surfers pick the vehicle they want, then get in touch with
a local dealer to establish a price and a test drive or delivery.
<p>
   Now, Microsoft has added used cars to the mix, with a service
called Interactive Classifieds.
<p>
   The service lets Net surfers specify either the type of car they
are looking for  &MD;  sport-utility, sports car, minivan, station
wagon, passenger car, pickup truck, etc.  &MD;  or a specific make and
model. Consumers can enter a price range, a range of model years
and mileage.
<p>
   The service then searches its dealer database to find vehicles
that match the consumer's specifications, then gives a list of
them, including the make and model, price, mileage and distance to
the dealership from a specified ZIP code.
<p>
   Then, with a click of the mouse on a specific vehicle on the
list, a photo and full description of the vehicle pops up at the
top of the screen. I found that the photo usually wasn't of the
particular vehicle for sale, and that for some vehicles, there was
no photo.
<p>
   To find the dealer, consumers can click on a button and the Web
site draws a color map. Another option allows consumers to query
the dealer online about the specific car, to get answers to any
questions about it.
<p>
   I checked out used minivans and sport-utilities in the $5,000 to
$12,000 range, and was immediately directed to cars at several
dealers within a 50-mile radius.
<p>
   The used-car service debuted Sept. 8 with 90,000 vehicles listed
from 700 dealers. Microsoft says it plans to double the number of
dealerships on the site within three months.
<p>
   For a $1,000 monthly fee, any dealership can join the site and
list as many vehicles as it wishes, Microsoft personnel say.
<p>
   The software company began its own new-car buying service two
months ago, after ending a yearlong association with Auto-by-Tel, a
Southern California-based Internet new-car buying service.
<p>
   The Microsoft Web address is carpoint.msn.com.

   No Accord wagon: A reader sent me an E-mail message in response
to an item in a recent column about the restyled 1998 Honda Accord.
``Is there going to be a wagon version?'' the reader asked.
<p>
   Yes and no.
<p>
   Honda is about to introduce a station wagon version of the new
Accord. But it won't be sold in the United States. The U.S. wagon
model was dropped for 1998.
<p>
   In Japan, where small wagons are still extremely popular and
haven't been replaced by minivans and sport-utilities, Honda
expects about half of all Accord sales to be wagons this coming
year. The Japanese wagon goes on sale Oct. 9.
<p>
   I believe that if enough U.S. consumers want this car, Honda
might consider bringing it here. But the problem now is that Honda
plans to build all of its Accords for the North American market at
its Ohio plant, and doesn't plan to import any Accords. The Ohio
plant isn't geared up to build wagons now, even though it did
produce the previous generation of Accord wagon.
<p>
   Jaguar goes V-8: Ford's British luxury-car division, Jaguar,
will introduce its new 1998 XJ8 sedan at U.S. dealerships Oct. 9.
<p>
   There's not a lot different about the XJ8 from its 1997
predecessor, the XJ6, except that the V-8 engine replaces the
in-line six-cylinder that has powered the XJ6 since 1987.
<p>
   The V-8 is the same engine used in the XK8 coupe and
convertible, which Jaguar rolled out last year.
<p>
   This new 4.0-liter engine cranks out 290 horsepower and 290
foot-pounds of torque, compared with 245 horsepower and 289
foot-pounds of torque for last year's in-line six. It will take the
car from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds.
<p>
   Later this fall, Jaguar will introduce a supercharged version of
the V-8 in a performance version of the XJ8 that will be called the
XJR. That engine will produce 370 horsepower and a whopping 387
foot-pounds of torque. Coupled with a Mercedes-Benz five-speed
automatic transmission, the XJR will go from zero to 60 mph in 5.4
seconds.

<p>
   Buenos Aires, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Argentine shares rose as
investors snapped up Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata SA and Banco
de Galicia y Buenos Aires SA, whose shares appeared attractive
compared with those to be sold by a rival bank.
<p>
   Both banks declined in recent weeks, as investors cleared space
in their portfolios for the new shares to be sold by Banco Rio de
la Plata SA.
<p>
   ``Rio's a leading bank; when you add something like that to the
market things have to be reevaluated,'' said Sergio Galvan, who
manages $80 million for Bansud SA..
<p>
   The Merval index of the 27 most traded shares rose 0.94 percent
to 825.91, as trading surged. Trading totaled 36.9 million pesos
($36.9 million), above the six-month daily average of 26.6 million
pesos. Seventeen shares rose, three went unchanged and seven
declined.
<p>
   The general index of all sharers traded rose 1.06 percent to
24,864.41.
<p>
   Strong growth within Argentina's banking industry and a limited
number of top-tier banks to choose from caused shares to rise to
expensive levels, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Daniel
Tassan-Din.
<p>
   The sale of Banco Rio, controlled by Banco Santander SA of
Spain, will offer investors another option, he said. Banco Rio is
expected to sell 79.35 million shares, or 26 percent of its
outstanding shares, for between 7.0 pesos and 8.5 pesos each on
Oct. 9.
<p>
   Banco Frances shares fell 20 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 23 while Banco Galicia fell 14 percent during the month
ending Sept. 23. That left prices at attractive levels, said
Tassan-Din.
<p>
   ``When relating prices to performance of loan portfolios and
total assets, the three are much closer to par now,'' he said.
``Value-wise you can no longer say that Rio is better.''
<p>
   The upcoming Banco Rio shares had been considered a better value
in part because Rio has a better safeguard against its
non-performing loans. About 110 percent of its non-performing loans
are covered by a special fund, as compared to Galicia's 65 percent
and Frances's 79 percent, said Tassan-Din. That allows shares to
trade at a relatively higher price.
<p>
   Banco Rio shares are expected to sell at between 2.6 and 2.9
times book value, or assets minus liabilities, said Galvan. Frances
trades at about 2.4 times book value, while Galicia at about 2.3.
<p>
   Banco Frances led banks, rose 2.4 percent to 10.55 pesos
($10.55). Banco Galicia rose 4.2 percent to 7.4 pesos, while Bansud
SA climbed 0.74 percent to 13.6 pesos.
<p>
   Steel shares also rallied, as steel production figures for
August showed that an industrial boom isn't slowing. Crude steel
production was 1.6 percent higher than in August 1996, the
Argentine Steel Industry Association said.
<p>
   Output of hot and cold rolled sheets of steel rose 9.1 percent
and 18.7 percent respectively. That led steel sheet producer
Siderar to climb 3.7 percent to 5.55 pesos.
<p>
   Santander Investments Securities analyst Andres Biolcati raised
his recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from ``market perform.''
<p>
   Siderca SA, which makes steel pipes used to transport petroleum
and gas, rose 1.3 percent to 2.98 pesos. Acindar Industria
Argentina de Aceros SA, which makes long steel used in
construction, rose 2.30 percent to 3.11 pesos.
<p>
   ``Argentina is in the building and development cycle of economic
growth. We continue to like the steel companies because they
continue to be key,'' said Leandro Sarave, who manages $140 million
at Deutsche Bank in Argentina.
<p>
   Other gainers included YPF SA, which rose 0.67 percent to 37.15
pesos, a record.
<p>
   Agriculture company Cresud Sacifya and real estate developer
IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones SA also rose after newspaper
Clarin reported that land prices rose as much as 70 percent this
year. Both companies have aggressively increased their land
holdings this year.
<p>
   IRSA rose 0.22 percent to 4.44 pesos, while Cresud rose 2.8
percent to 2.16 pesos. Hedge fund manager George Soros has stakes
in each.
<p>
   Telefonica de Argentina SA rose 2.1 percent to 3.73 pesos, while
Telecom Argentina Stet France Telecom SA rose 2.7 percent to 6.0
pesos.
<p>
   The Merval rose 2.4 percent during the week. That trend is
expected to continue next week on investor sentiment that the U.S.
Federal Reserve won't raise overnight borrowing rates during a
policy meeting on Tuesday.
<p>
   U.S. economic indicators showed that 2nd-quarter growth was
slower than expected and that inflation remained subdued. That
reduces the chance the Fed would decide to slow the economy by
increasing interest rates, said Galvan.
<p>
   ``I don't know anyone who expects a rate increase now,'' he
said.
<p>
   Maintaining rates would reduce the threat of higher borrowing
costs for Argentine companies. Interest rates in Argentina are
tightly bound to those in the U.S. because the two are strong trade
partners and because the peso is pegged at par with the dollar.

turn a profit of $420,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30,
according to documents filed Friday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
<p>
   That's down from $54.2 million net income in fiscal 1996, but
that year the partnership picked up an extra $105 million by
selling Channel 25 to Fox Television Stations Inc. It wasn't so
lucky this year; the partnership had to rely on ticket sales and
promotional revenues.
<p>
   In fiscal 1997, Celtics revenues fell to just under $63 million,
compared to $64.8 million in 1996.
<p>
   Results for the year were dragged down by the financial burdens
of the team's rebuilding program.
<p>
   For coaching the Boston Celtics to 15 wins in the 1996-97
season, and stepping aside gracefully for new coach Rick Pitino,
M.L. Carr took home $2 million in salary and bonus. Pitino received
$750,000 in salary and a deferred bonus of $600,000.
<p>
   The big money starts rolling in for Pitino this year, when he
will earn $6.75 million a year for the next six years, and $2
million a year for four years after that.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the team paid $4.5 million to buy out the contract of
power forward Dino Radja, and another $4 million on salaries and
bonuses for new staff, and severance expenses for people let go
during the restructuring.
<p>
   Richard Pond, the Celtics' chief financial officer, predicted
that the Pitino era will lead to increasing ticket sales and more
successful promotional tie-ins. Pond noted that when tickets for
the upcoming Celtics season went on sale, over 1,000 fans lined up
on the first day. By hiring Pitino and revamping the lineup ``what
we have effectively done is change the image of the team,'' Pond
said.
<p>
   Another revenue boost could result from a new promotional deal
with a Boston-area bank. Dissatisfied with its deal with Fleet
Financial Group, the Celtics are discussing a link with Citizens
Financial Group.
<p>
   Fleet reportedly has balked at the Celtics request that the bank
spend $6 million over the next five years on Celtics-related
marketing efforts. But Citizens may be willing to pay the price.
<p>
   Boston Celtics Limited Partnership shares fell 1/4 Friday to 25
1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  For most people the will to live, even in hard times,
is more than a determination to survive. It is an unquestioning,
ebullient zest for being sensate in the world. This humanistic
perception was the rock-bottom insight of the great Iranian
filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami's last two films, ``And Life Goes On''
and ``Through the Olive Trees,'' which were shown in the New York
Film Festival in 1992 and '94. Both films portrayed Iranian farmers
rolling with the punches of nature and almost cheerfully rebuilding
their lives after a devastating earthquake.
<p>
   In his exquisite new film, ``Taste of Cherry,'' which the
festival is showing Sunday at 4 p.m., Kiarostami contrasts the
teeming vitality of Iranian working life with the suicidal
inclination of a brooding, affluent middle-aged man identified only
as Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi).
<p>
   Through most of the film, this character, whom Ershadi imbues
with a quiet, smoldering bitterness, drives around the parched
hills outside Teheran in a dusty white Range Rover, accosting
strangers, interviewing them and asking them to assist him in a
suicidal ritual. For a fee of 200,000 tomans (what a soldier would
make in six months), he asks one man after another to accompany him
to a predetermined grave site on the side of a hill and to return
the next day to bury his dead body. In the unlikely possibility
that Badii hasn't died from an overdose of sleeping pills taken the
night before, the man designated to bury him is to help him to his
feet.
<p>
   If this grim scenario suggests one of Ingmar Bergman's bleaker
cinematic meditations, ``Taste of Cherry'' is a long way from being
a tormented probing into the soul's dark night. Badii's anguish is
never explained, and he appears to be physically healthy and
materially comfortable. He has just lost some instinctive knack.
<p>
   Until he meets up with a wizened old taxidermist who tells him
the story of his own failed suicide attempt decades earlier, Badii
finds no takers for his scheme, despite the reward. His first
prospective client is an impoverished young soldier who flees the
Range Rover in terror when Badii makes his proposition. The second
is an Afghan refugee who is a security guard at a lonely desert
outpost. The third, another Afghan, is an articulate Islamic
seminarian (Mir Hossein Noori) who lectures Badii calmly on the
Muslim strictures against suicide.
<p>
   Kiarostami, like no other filmmaker, has a vision of human scale
that is simultaneously epic and precisely minuscule. While each of
the men Badii approaches is a vivid, autonomous individual with a
rich personal history and an innate sense of dignity, each is also
seen as part of the human anthill.
<p>
   The camera continually draws back for long shots of soldiers
marching in formation over the harsh landscape and of workers
moving enormous piles of red dirt and rock with heavy equipment.
Dogs bark in the distance, the wind blows, flocks of crows circle
and descend and rise. You feel the pulse and rhythms of earthly
life on a grand scale. The breadth and fullness of this calm,
orderly vision of people going about their business in a world that
looks abundant, even beautiful, despite its aridity is idyllic if
austere.
<p>
   But it isn't until Badii meets the taxidermist, who is carrying
a bunch of freshly killed quail for a natural-history museum class
in stuffing birds, that the film finds a lyrical voice to match its
powerful visual imagery. His gorgeous, rough-hewn soliloquy about
regaining his zest for living after trying to hang himself from a
mulberry tree is a simple, eloquent parable of the senses opening
to the refreshment of life's simple pleasures.
<p>
   ``The House Is Black,'' a short film that precedes ``Taste of
Cherry,'' is a 21-minute documentary made in 1962 about life in a
leper colony. Images of excruciating suffering and courage are
accompanied by the reading of a somber poem by the Iranian director
and poet Forough Farrokhzad.
<p>

<p>
   For college hopefuls at high schools across the country, this is
the season of high anxiety. In a few days, the heart of the testing
season will begin, with many 11th graders confronting the PSAT.
Soon afterward, many seniors will grapple with the SAT. Then
there's the scariest test of all  &MD;  the existential one that
involves Making a Decision.
<p>
   It is time, in other words, to choose a college.
<p>
   Deciding on a school involves self-evaluation, research and a
sizable amount of time  &MD;  also a chunk of money, given the cost of
applications and campus visits.
<p>
   But most students begin shopping in the same, simple, way. They
look through college guides  &MD;  those ubiquitous (in autumn, anyway)
soft-cover books that list, rank, describe and otherwise categorize
the nation's colleges.
<p>
   In a yearly college guide poll of freshmen at the College of
Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, more than three-quarters of those
surveyed said they relied on these handbooks. Of those, almost 90
percent said they used two or three guides.
<p>
   ``They'll often combine a statistically oriented guide with one
that has more anecdotal information,'' said Jeff Hanna, executive
director of college relations at Wooster. ``They use these guides
early in the process  &MD;  to make a list, to make quick comparisons
about location, size or majors.''
<p>
   That is just how the guides should be used, according to the
National Association for College Admissions Counseling, which
represents 6,400 high school counselors and university admissions
people. ``The handbooks have a great value in providing factual
information,'' said Mark Milroy, the group's chief officer for
programs and services. ``We don't endorse any rankings.''
<p>
   Guides that rank schools remain popular, however. For the second
year in a row, the top-rated handbook in the Wooster poll  &MD; 
involving 517 freshmen from 37 states this year  &MD;  was ``America's
Best Colleges,'' a guide by U.S. News &AMP; World Report that ranks
1,400 schools.
<p>
   Another popular resource was the World Wide Web. About 47
percent of the students in the Wooster poll said they went to the
Internet for help, up from 17 percent last year. Of those, almost
90 percent said the sites' college information was as least as
useful as that in handbooks. ``I think the Web is going to have a
real impact on the guides,'' Hanna said.
<p>
   There are scores of college guides out there  &MD;  some slim and
specialized, others thicker than the Manhattan telephone directory.
They cost anywhere from $5.95 to $25, though some are available at
public libraries and schools.
<p>
   Following is a brief look at a few of them:
<p>
   FACTS AND STATS ``The College Handbook'' (The College Board,
$23.95) is one of the big books  &MD;  a compendium of academic,
demographic and financial facts about schools coast to coast.
<p>
   In a McDonaldized marketing touch, its cover boasts of ``over
two million copies sold,'' and one reason for the book's success
may be its useful and somewhat unusual indexes. Readers can look up
colleges by ``environment''  &MD;  small and urban or large and
suburban, for example.
<p>
   There is also a list of schools that accept applications very
late in the year. Historically black colleges are indexed, too, as
are schools with services for learning-disabled students, but these
categories pop up in other books, too.
<p>
   Another good touch: a brief rundown of the early-decision
policies at 330 schools that accept students before the yearly
rush.
<p>
   The book's Web site offers, among other things, sample PSAT
questions (www.collegeboard.org).
<p>
   3,200 PAGES ``Peterson's Guide to Four-Year Colleges''
(Peterson's, $24.95) is another comprehensive guide  &MD;  a
wrist-wrenching 3,200 pages to carry around. Aside from describing
2,004 colleges and universities, the book indexes colleges by
state, by majors offered and by cost categories from $2,000 a year
to $20,000 and more.
<p>
   A ``College Countdown Calendar'' lists important testing dates.
It also suggests a timetable for racking up those application
assets. December: ``Get involved in a community service activity,''
and ``Begin to read newspapers.'' It is depressing that this kind
of advice serves a need for students to package themselves as
commodities, but let's not blame the messenger.
<p>
   The book comes with a free compact disk containing sample
questions from the SAT and ACT, among other things.
<p>
   The publisher's Web site (www.petersons.com) competes a bit with
the book; it offers 1,000 school descriptions taken from the
guide.
<p>
   SLIMMER PICKINGS ``The Kaplan/Newsweek College Catalogue''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) encompasses 1,000 colleges. But for a big
book, it skimps. Most schools get just a page of data, no prose.
``Campus profiles'' are reserved for the big or better-known
schools in this disappointing guide. The Web site address is
www.kaplan.com.

 &UR; UPS GIRDS FOR CONTRACT REJECTION BY PILOTS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANE E. LEWIS &QC;

<p>
   United Parcel Service of America Inc. said it has almost fully
recovered from a crippling 15-day Teamsters strike earlier this
year, but is now bracing for a likely rejection of a proposed
five-year contract by its 2,000 unionized pilots.
<p>
   ``We feel our contract meets the needs of the pilots and
addresses their issues,'' said UPS spokesperson Susan Rosenberg.
``But at this point, we wouldn't be surprised if the contract is
voted down.''
<p>
   Members of the Independent Pilots Association, headquartered in
Louisville, had threatened to strike if demands for higher wages
were not met. But a timetable for talks issued by federal mediators
bars them from striking during the peak holiday shipping season,
which begins in the fall and ends after the New Year.
<p>
   The two sides disagree over annual wages for pilots, co-pilots,
and flight engineers. UPS is proposing an overall increase of 19.8
percent; the union is seeking pay raises of 21 percent over the
life of the contract.
<p>
   Rosenberg said the package would increase captains' pay to
$202,000 from $153,000, and would give co-pilots and flight
engineers raises of 56 percent and 94 percent, respectively.
<p>
   But Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the union, said the company's
offer would not enable the pilots to reach parity with other
commercial pilots in the industry.
<p>
   ``Their package is basically a 19.8 percent increase spread out
over seven years, retroactive to 1996,'' said Gaudet. ``We are
saying give us 21 percent retroactive to Jan. 1, 1996 now, and then
2.5 percent per year for each year from 1998 through 2002.''
<p>
   Gaudet said UPS pilots' earnings, based on federal statistics,
are about $102,000 per year. By contrast, he said, pilots at
Federal Express earn $127,000 per year, on average. ``Right now,
UPS is the ninth airline in the world and it is profitable,'' said
Gaudet. ``Our pilots feel it's time to close the gap, and they want
the average pay for all US pilots, which is about $135,000 per
year.''
<p>
   Last month, the union decided to submit the company's offer to
its pilots for a vote, but said it would not advise its members how
to vote.
<p>
   Rosenberg said the pilots' demands for more pay escalated
between May and August, when 185,000 Teamster drivers and sorters
walked off jobs at UPS sites around the country. She said the
company would continue to operate with no interruptions if the
pilots vote against the offer.
<p>
   Rosenberg's comments came several weeks after UPS settled the
contentious 15-day strike by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, which cost the company $700 million and crippled
hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely heavily on the
shipping industry.
<p>
   Prior to the strike, UPS handled 12 million packages daily.
During the strike, volume dropped to about 1.2 million. UPS, the
largest package delivery service in the world, handles about 80
percent of this nation's ground transportation delivery market.
<p>
   ``Right now, our volume is approaching or nearly at pre-strike
levels with respect to pick up and delivery of packages,'' noted
Rosenberg. ``But we are not kidding ourselves by assuming that the
higher levels are not caused, in part, by the beginning of the new
peak season.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, Friday, Itasca, Ill.-based Boise Cascade Office
Products Corp. said UPS's strike will reduce its third-quarter
earnings by about 2 cents to 3 cents a share.
<p>
   The distributor of office, furniture and paper products, a unit
of Boise Cascade Corp., was expected to earn 21 cents in the
quarter, the average estimate of six analysts polled by IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   In the year-ago third quarter, the company earned $11.7 million,
or 19 cents a share, on sales of $506.7 million.
<p>
   Boise Cascade Office Products shares rose 1/2 Friday to 19 1/2
on the New York Stock Exchange.

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Canada spent more on U.S. electronic products than
any other foreign country in 1996, buying $20.8 billion worth, a
7.8 percent increase over its 1995 spending, according to the
Electronic Industries Association.
<p>
   Overall, Canada spent $172 billion on all types of U.S. goods
last year, making it America's biggest foreign market, according to
the Department of Commerce.
<p>
   Japan was the second largest importer of American electronic
products, which include calculators, computers, radios and remote
controls. Tokyo spent $16 billion on such products last year, a
17.5 percent boost from 1995.
<p>
   Mexico ranked third in electronic imports from the United
States, spending $11.4 billion last year, up 29.3 percent from
1995. Britain was fourth, with $8.4 billion in electronic purchases
from America in 1996, down 7.5 percent from 1995.
<p>
   Mark Rosenker, vice president for public affairs at the
Electronic Industries Association, said Mexico's growing
electronics purchases resulted from the 1993 North American Free
Trade Agreement, which removed trade barriers among Canada, the
United States and Mexico.
<p>
   Japan topped the list of countries selling electronics to the
United States last year, although its sales to America fell from
$41.8 billion in 1995 to $38 billion, down 9 percent.
<p>
   Singapore, which sold $17 billion worth of electronics to the

   YOUR HIT PARADE Now for a few of the guides that rank,
differentiate or otherwise specialize:
<p>
    &MD;  ``America's Best Colleges'' (U.S. News &AMP; World Report, $5.95)
places 1,400 colleges in ``quality tiers'' based on academic
reputation, selectivity and alumni giving, among other things; new
this year is a diversity ranking. Popular as it may be, I found
this guide dull and predictable. The descriptions are short,
numerical snapshots; the only prose is in the introductory sections
 &MD;  articles and some ads that appeared in the special ``best
college'' issue of U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Fiske Guide to Colleges'' (Random House/Times Books,
$20) is a readable guide that seems less interested in reputation.
It covers 300 schools  &MD;  175 ``selective'' colleges, along with
others deemed interesting because of their curriculums or
locations.
<p>
   The book includes a good sampling of three kinds of schools it
considers to be popular now: Engineering colleges, schools with a
religious emphasis and colleges on the West Coast or in the Sun
Belt, where tuition tends to be cheaper.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The 311 Best Colleges,'' by The Princeton Review (Random
House/Times Books, $20) is another good guide, and the most
irreverent of the bunch. Along with information provided by college
administrators about faculty ratios, admissions and
learning-disability programs, it offers ratings and comments by
students.
<p>
   This book has become known for its student rankings of schools
in 61 categories: everything from ``Party Schools'' and ``Students
Most Nostalgic for George McGovern'' to ``Best Overall Academic
Experience'' and ``Professors Suck All Life from Materials.''
<p>
   The offbeat indexes, along with the chattily written
descriptions of each school, provide a colorful picture of each
campus. The danger is that the picture may be distorted by the
particular students who volunteered information. The Web site is
www.review.com.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The National Review College Guide'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13)
also has a strong personality  &MD;  in this case, a conservative one.
Mixing polemics with avuncular advice, the book points students to
58 colleges it considers academically rigorous and entertainingly
takes aim at brand-name schools that offer ``watered down'' or
``politically correct'' curriculums.
<p>
    &MD;  Another small speci!lty book, ``The Black Student's Guide to
Colleges'' (Madison Books, $19.95) profiles more than 190 colleges,
20 of them historically black. Aside from the usual data on
academics, admissions and costs, the book lists the number of black
professors at each college and provides some frank descriptions
about the realities of social life for black students at mostly
white schools.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Colleges That Change Lives: 40 Schools You Should Know About
Even if You're Not a Straight-A Student,'' by Loren Pope (Penguin,
$11.95) suggests some ``no-name'' colleges that produce, in the
author's words, ``a higher proportion of scientists, scholars and
people in Who's Who'' than do designer-label colleges. Smart and
credible, this book might sway an ``A'' student, too.
<p>
   HEART SET ON HARVARD? Finally, for those determined to attend a
designer-label school, there's the illuminating and just-published
``A is for Admission: The Insider's Guide to Getting Into the Ivy
League and Other Top Colleges,'' by Michele A. Hernandez (Warner
Books, $24).
<p>
   Ms. Hernandez, who spent four years as a Dartmouth admissions
officer, discloses the formula for the Academic Index  &MD;  the
admissions criteria used by the Ivies and other highly selective
schools, a set of standards that have long been mysterious. Some of
the book's revelations are heartening: Elite schools, it turns out,
are impressed by the achievements of students from humble
backgrounds. Some disclosures confirm what people already know:
Standardized test scores do count more than anything else.
<p>
   And mixed in with the details that may cause a stir, there is
this happy fact: At Dartmouth, anyway, the application envelopes
stay piled up for a week or so after the deadline; no one will
notice a slightly late postmark.
<p>
   The author's advice: Do not spend extra money on an overnight
delivery service.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
<p>
   Early Friday, an ocean buoy 280 miles west of Astoria, Ore.,
detected waves as high as 31 feet. Large waves subsequently broke
on the shores of Washington and Oregon later in the day but did not
arrive at a time of high tide, sparing the coast of serious
flooding. Seas were stirred by a formidable high-pressure system
off Vancouver Island.
<p>
   Saturday, the low will speed across western Canada, dragging a
cold front across the upper Midwest of the United States. Scattered
showers will usher the cool front across the upper Mississippi
Valley, but, given the dearth of moisture, thunder and lightning
are unlikely.
<p>
   In the wake of the cold front, winds from the northwest will
gust to 50 miles per hour or more across parts of Montana and the
western Dakotas. Farther west, strong high pressure will build into
the Pacific Northwest, restricting rain to northwest Washington,
where onshore winds promote spotty showers over the Olympics and
northern Cascades. Farther south, offshore winds blowing around the
expansive high will keep cool sea breezes at bay, setting the stage
for warm weather along the central California Coast.
<p>
   With the jet stream continuing to flow swiftly over the
northern-tier states, a sluggish low-pressure system that has been
separated from these steering winds will incite a volley of heavy
rain over parts of Florida and the Southeast Coast as it draws
tropical moisture northward. Meanwhile, after pockets of valley fog
lift, an area of high pressure will provide sunny, seasonable
conditions for most of the Northeast.
<p>
   Focus: Desert Torrents
<p>
   More rain fell in one day at Yuma, Ariz., than typically falls
in an entire year when the remnants of Hurricane Nora passed over
the city. While Thursday's downpour was noteworthy, it is not rare
at desert locations for a substantial portion of the annual rain to
fall in just a few events. Desert climates result when large-scale
wind patterns favor sinking air most of the time. Sinking air warms
and dries, while rising air cools and moistens. However, when
strong disturbances such as Nora alter the usual subsiding wind
patterns found over the desert, heavy rain can occur in normally
arid locations like Yuma.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  John Hurt is simply wonderful  &MD;  acerbic, funny and
heartbreaking  &MD;  in the role of a fusty English writer who, to his
astonishment, is seduced by the beauty of the new. Some of that
beauty belongs to the American teen-age heartthrob on whom the
writer develops an insane crush. Some of it also belongs to the
modern-day wonders like film, television and pizza of which he has
been unaware. ``Does the 20th century play any part in your life?''
an interviewer asks him early in the story.
<p>
   Well, no. But Giles De'Ath (Hurt), who has to keep reminding
people that the pronunciation of his name is ``DAY-ahth'' and not
something grimmer, begins his awakening on the day he is locked out
of his house and ventures to a cinema, having just heard that E.M.
Forster's works are sometimes made into movies. ``This isn't E.M.
Forster!'' he exclaims indignantly, and indeed it's not: it's
``Hotpants College 2,'' for which he has bought a ticket by
mistake. Giles is about to make his exit when Ronnie Bostock (Jason
Priestley) magically materializes on screen.
<p>
   Giles decides immediately that this fetching young man is far
superior to his idiotic surroundings. The sight of Ronnie lying on
the counter at a burger joint, squirted with ketchup by bullies, is
enough to remind him of the pre-Raphaelite painting of the death of
Chatterton, for example. Then the distinguished gentleman begins
shoplifting copies of teen-age fan magazines. He clips out pictures
and lovingly pastes them in a scrapbook labeled Bostockiana.
<p>
   ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' written and directed in
delightfully droll fashion by Richard Kwietniowski from a novel by
Gilbert Adair (soon to be published in the United States), for a
while enjoys Giles' sheepishness in asking for titles like ``Tex
Mex'' at the video store. (Clerks and ticket sellers take one look
at the supercilious fellow in the overcoat and love repeating those
titles as loudly as possible.) Then it sends De'Ath from England to
America in search of his unlikely idol, who lives in a quiet
community near the Hamptons. The title makes a lovely and typically
sly pun.
<p>
   The comedy of manners escalates as Giles tries to leave his
shoes outside the door at an American motel, and as he wanders
amazedly past stores full of running shoes and Stephen King books.
But it inevitably becomes anticlimactic after Ronnie, who has been
seen only in amusing parodies of birdbrained movies full of
teen-age louts, appears in the flesh. Priestley plays his role
earnestly, but he's no match for Hurt and no cause for Giles'
fascination. Still, as Giles insinuates himself into the household
shared by Ronnie and his girlfriend Audrey (Fiona Loewi), there is
the fun of watching his wiles. ``Are you saying,'' Ronnie asks him
bewilderedly, ``that if Shakespeare were alive today he'd be doing
things like `Hotpants College'?''
<p>
   ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' to be shown Saturday at 9
p.m. and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. as part of the 35th New York Film
Festival, has no easy way of resolving its one-way romance. But it
does eloquently and affectingly explore Giles' situation. ``Ronnie,
there's nothing more solitary than an artist's life,'' he finally
explains. ``One yearns for solace without quite knowing where to
look for it.'' Indeed.
<p>

<p>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich.  &MD;  The game used to have so much meaning. Winner
moves up, loser moves out. Michigan-Notre Dame, a rivalry that
epitomizes the tradition of college football.
<p>
   Three years ago, the teams suspended the rivalry. Something
about wanting to see new faces, perhaps schedule a game not quite
so intense so early in the year.
<p>
   Saturday afternoon at Michigan Stadium, a record crowd is
expected  &MD;  perhaps topping 107,000  &MD;  as the Wolverines and Irish
resume hostilities.
<p>
   Things are different than the last time the teams met in 1994.
Michigan coach Gary Moeller is now an assistant on Bobby Ross's
Detroit Lions staff. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is a CBS analyst.
<p>
   Notre Dame is 1-2. Michigan is 2-0. Perhaps that will be the
tone for this season, perhaps not. We'll know more by tonight.
<p>
   Michigan is ranked sixth nationally. The Wolverines are playing
like, well, Michigan, a team with talent up and down the line of
scrimmage, from quarterback Brian Griese to defensive-offensive
back Charles Woodson. They are averaging 243 yards a game rushing,
236 yards passing, and have not allowed a touchdown.
<p>
   ``We want to run for as many yards as we throw for, but we want
to be unpredictable in terms of down-and-distance tendencies,''
said Michigan coach Lloyd Carr.
<p>
   Michigan is doing that as well as it ever has, which is why the
talk of a national championship, something that hasn't happened
here in 50 years, is not dismissed with derisive laughter.
<p>
   A win is expected. Still, it might surprise some people, who
have grown accustomed to a steady diet of 8-4 seasons.
<p>
   Notre Dame is in a far more precarious situation. No one is
happy in South Bend with the worst start for an Irish team since
1986. Various explanations have been given for back-to-back losses
to Purdue and Michigan State.
<p>
   New coach Bob Davie is looking for solutions to problems that
might not be solved with the present roster.
<p>
   Davie has tried everything to jump-start a team that has looked
flat and uninspired all season.
<p>
   ``Every team is different,'' said Davie. ``And the real strong
teams have strong leaders. But it's something that happens
naturally, not by voting somebody a leader.''
<p>
   Part of the problem could be at quarterback. Even Davie, one of
his strongest backers, is almost ready to concede that Ron Powlus
might not be the best on the Notre Dame roster.
<p>
   One of the options discussed this week has been switching to
junior Jarious Jackson, who would give the offense more speed and
versatility. ``We've talked about it a lot this week,'' said Davie.
``And there's some merit to that. You know, it's when and where you
do it, and what are the long-term ramifications? With everythig you
do, there's a trade-off. I just don't think right now the pluses
outweigh the minuses.''
<p>
   Translation? Davie probably isn't quite ready to quit on Powlus,
who came back for his fifth year to avoid having his career end on
a negative note.
<p>
   But it is also clear that Davie is getting ready to do something
drastic if the Irish don't respond to what is clearly a crisis
situation. When and where will the Irish season bottom out, if it
has not already done so?
<p>
   Notre Dame, a stunning two-touchdown underdog, can make a
180-degree turn in its season with a win.
<p>
   Michigan can do the same thing with a loss, which is why the
game has become The Game once again.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  To perhaps the deepest and most complex of human
relationships, the Russian filmmaker Aleksandr Sokurov brings the
eye of a masterly painter and the sensitivity of a poet.
<p>
   In his spare, intense, lyrical ``Mother and Son,'' which is
being shown Saturday at 3:30 p.m. as part of the 35th New York Film
Festival, Sokurov immerses the viewer in an isolated landscape that
resonates with pain and loneliness as a young man tends his dying
mother. On the surface, little happens. The woman (Gudrun Geyer)
sleeps; the son (Aleksei Ananisnov) takes her for a walk, carrying
her most of the time. Some postcards and photos in an album allude
to a past of friends and lovers; the young man recalls his
childhood, waiting for his mother to return from teaching school
and wondering if she ever would. In time, they return to her
moldering house.
<p>
   If ``Mother and Son'' vexes at length despite the mesmerizing
cinematic canvases that Sokurov lays before the onlooker in an
unbroken parade of visual riches, it is because in time, he creates
an understandable yearning to know more of these people. For all
the universality of the relationship he depicts, for all the
universality of death and loss, this mother and this son are
singular.
<p>
   Despite the imbalance here in visual and narrative strength,
Sokurov, whose works were designated prerevolutionary and banned in
the Soviet Union, remains a filmmaker of enormous control and
power. Represented in the United States previously by such works as
``Stone,'' ``Save and Protect'' and ``The Second Circle,'' he
revels in light and shadow, fixates on lowering clouds, seizes on
the play of sunlight on forest floor, poses his characters on pale
roads rolling between green fields, angles them against stands of
birches and makes of their flesh what sculptors make of stone. He
lingers over windswept grasses and mines the ever-changing sky.
<p>
   Given that he is a filmmaker, he enhances his world with sound:
the rush of wind, the mournful whistle of a train, the buzzing of a
fly, a bit of birdsong, the rumble of thunder and somewhere in the
distance, the whisper of the sea.
<p>
   In the midst of death, Sokurov glories in life.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Takeshi Kitano is a Renaissance star in Japan: comic
actor, serious director, painter, film editor, tough guy.
Apparently in all these realms he relies on contrast and shock
value, whether in a startling juxtaposition of images or in
sweeping pronouncements.
<p>
   ``I really hate young people,'' he told an interviewer not long
ago. ``I think they're fools.''
<p>
   Similar steeliness is a big component of the meticulously
handsome, imaginatively edited ``Hana-Bi,'' which shows off both
his fierce and gentle talents, and which will be shown Sunday night
at 7 and Monday night at 9 at the New York Film Festival.
<p>
   Indeed, the film begins with the sight of Nishi, the hard-boiled
cop played by Kitano (and billed as his acting alter ego, Beat
Takeshi), brutally kicking two punks who have messed with his car.
<p>
   Punctuated throughout by similar bursts of viciousness, it also
tells the tender story of how Nishi rekindles the spirits of his
dying wife. The title acknowledges this sharp dichotomy: hana means
flower and bi means fire. Together the two words mean fireworks,
which Kitano's film certainly delivers. The filmmaker's equal
fondness for bright floral paintings and exploding blood bags is
sure to keep an audience on its toes, even if some of the effects
are as blunt as (quite literally) chopsticks in the eye.
<p>
   The rugged, laconic Nishi is silently brooding over multiple
tragedies, which the film recapitulates with ingenious leaps across
time. His daughter has died, his wife is suffering from melancholy
and leukemia and his hospital visit one fateful day has provoked
enormous grief and guilt.
<p>
   Nishi chances to be absent from duty while his friend, Horibe
(Ren Osugi), is crippled at a police stakeout. Remorse over this
and other violence against his colleagues leads Nishi to leave the
force and make restitution to loved ones in his own renegade way.
<p>
   Yakuza thugs and a bank robbery give the film its measure of
violence, which is interspersed with peacefully contemplative
moments, many of them featuring Kitano's fanciful artworks. (One
series depicts animals with flower faces: purple orchids on bats,
calla lilies on penguins. A many-tentacled creation adorns the
yakuzas' headquarters.) Nishi's stony heroism ultimately leads to a
loving getaway to Mount Fuji with his wife, an idyll whose lyricism
does nothing to compromise the film's coolly composed tone.
<p>
   The frequently surprising ``Hana-Bi'' features flashes of
deadpan humor (a box of carefully wrapped painting supplies for
Horibe includes a beret) and images of haunting pathos (one
principal setting is a junkyard, reflecting the film's
preoccupation with damaged people). Not even its most reflective
moments are at much of a remove from its volatile fury, though. In
a sequence showing Nishi's wife at the shore as she gently waters a
bouquet of dead flowers, a boorish stranger complains about the
futility of her gesture. It takes Nishi only an instant to shove
him underwater and start the water turning red.
<p>

<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Shrugging off an 11th-hour appeal by the United States,
President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a law Friday limiting religious
freedom that detractors fear could mean a return to religious
persecution in Russia.
<p>
   The measure establishes the Russian Orthodox Church as the
country's preeminent faith. It limits the rights of religious
groups that were not recognized by the atheist Soviet regime that
ran the country 15 years ago.
<p>
   Critics argue the wording of the new law violates Russia's
post-Communist constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.
Under the law, titled On Freedom of Conscience and Religious
Organizations, groups active since the collapse of communism,
including Roman Catholics and Protestants, face restrictions in
proselytizing, publishing, preaching, and owning property.
<p>
   Vice President Al Gore, in Moscow this week, appealed to Yeltsin
and other top Russian officials for amendments that would soften
what he called the law's discriminatory nature. President Clinton
expressed similar concerns to the Russian foreign minister, Yevgeny
M. Primakov, in New York.
<p>
   But Yeltsin signed the law, which was backed by the powerful
Russian Orthodox Church and the nationalist-minded parliament, just
two days after the upper house unanimously approved it.
<p>
   Yeltsin had vetoed a previous draft in July amid protests from
human-rights groups and church groups and a threat by the US Senate
to block more than $200 million in aid to Russia.
<p>
   Saying the first version included many provisions that
``restrict the constitutional rights of citizens and human
rights,'' Yeltsin ordered his administration to revise it. But
critics maintain the new version is no less discriminatory.
<p>
   The Vatican, in a written statement, called the law ``far from
the spirit and letter'' of Russia's pledge to respect religious
freedom. And a State Department spokesman in Washington said the
Clinton administration was disappointed.
<p>
   Supporters of the law say it protects citizens against cults and
``totalitarian sects'' they say have thrived, and preyed on
Russians, since the country began to open up in the late 1980s.
<p>
   Russian Orthodox Church leaders say they are trying to protect
Russia from a disaster such as the deadly gas attack on the Tokyo
subway by a Japanese cult in 1995 or the mass suicide of the Higher
Order cult in California this spring.
<p>
   Some Yeltsin aides have offered assurances that the law's
preamble  &MD;  which mentions Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and
Islam as Russia's ``traditional'' faiths  &MD;  means that Christian
denominations such as Roman Catholics and Baptists will be spared
any limitations.
<p>
   Critics say such an interpretation ignores the reality of the
rule of law in Russia. They say that local officials could use the
law to deny rights to new congregrations of established faiths.
Since 1991, more than 100 splinter groups have broken off from the
Moscow Patriarchate, the traditional seat of the Russian Orthodox
Church. Although these groups remain Orthodox in belief, they are
not recognized by the Moscow Patriarchate  &MD;  and, it follows, by the
new law.
<p>
   ``This means that those who have broken off from the Moscow
Patriarchate can be treated like a harmful cult,'' said Father Gleb
Yakunin, who was excommunicated by the Moscow Patriarchate and who
now belongs to a rival Orthodox sect. ``This means the Moscow
church can come and confiscate property, which is what they have
always wanted.''
<p>
   Similarly, Protestant and Roman Catholic congregations that have
been set up since 1991 could face the restrictions, depending on
how officials apply the law, Yakunin said. He argued religions now
depend on ``the whim of the state.''

   The winner is Rhode Island. There is really no comparison
between the offer on the table from that state and Massachusetts's
counterproposal this week designed to keep the Patriots in
Foxborough.
<p>
   The stadium in Providence would be new. The stadium in
Foxborough would be rebuilt. The financial deal in Providence is
worth millions more every year than Foxborough's.
<p>
   With this allegedly being the Bay State's best and last offer,
the Patriots now know they will never get a new facility here. But
the Massachusetts move did little to help the Patriots in Rhode
Island. They know they have the much better deal down there, and if
there is any give-and-take in the negotiations, Rhode Island will
not be in the giving mode.
<p>
   ``There is no question what we have to offer is clearly better
than what has been offered by Massachusetts,'' says Rhode Island
Speaker of the House John Harwood. ``But if there is an agreement
here, we in the General Assembly are going to make sure that it is
fair to both sides. We surely would want the Patriots to be
competitive with the rest of the league if they came here. We will
want to take a look at what they are going to take out of our
stadium compared to what other teams take out of theirs. We will
want the Patriots to do well, but not at the expense of the
taxpayers of Rhode Island.''
<p>
   Harwood expects negotiations to resume early next week.
<p>
   When the Red Sox start negotiating with Mo Vaughn's agent, Tom
Reich, on a long-term contract, they will give him a number
representing the annual salary they'll offer. If Vaughn wants to
take it, fine. If not, the Sox will trade Vaughn. It's as simple as
that.
<p>
   The Bruins will not send Joe Thornton back to junior hockey. The
No. 1 pick in the NHL draft will stay with the varsity when his
broken arm heals. The Bruins didn't think he would be a superstar
coming out of training camp and knew it would take a while for him
to get acclimated to the faster pace of the NHL. ``That story about
him being shipped back to his junior team didn't start with anyone
in this organization,'' says Harry Sinden. ``We don't know where it
came from, but he is staying here.''
<p>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams's decision to start Steve Avery
Thursday  &MD;  thus enabling the struggling lefthander to reach his
incentive quota of 18 starts, triggering a $3.9 million guarantee
next season if he wants to stay  &MD;  was done with the approval of
John Harrington and Dan Duquette. When Williams told them he wanted
to start Avery again, they asked why. Williams said he thought
Avery had corrected some of his pitching problems and could not
only win the game but could be a winner next season. And, Williams
thought, Avery would be willing to come back to Boston despite
indications to the contrary.
<p>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan concurred. Harrington and Duquette
told Williams to do it, even though it could end up costing the Red
Sox almost $4 million next year and hurt the club again if he turns
out to be a bust.
<p>
   Williams's job is safe for next year. Harrington and Duquette
know he didn't have the pitching to field a winner this year, and
they liked the way he ran the game from the dugout and had the team
playing hard even in difficult times.
<p>
   In case you couldn't have guessed, Boston is now officially
Patriots Country. The latest ESPN-Chilton Poll shows that the
Patriots are the dominant team in the Boston area. The year-long
poll wrapped up in August with 330 people from the the city and
environs responding. In order of preference, the teams of choice
are the Patriots (20.9 percent), the Red Sox (12.8), the Bruins
(7.7), and the Celtics (7.0).
<p>
   This is a major swing from a year ago when the Sox led with 19.3
precent. This means they dropped 6.5 percent  &MD;  or about one-third
of their 1996 support. Meanwhile, the Patriots moved up 6.9 percent
from their 14.0 rating the year before.
<p>
   The Patriots seemed to take fans away from the other teams. The
Celtics and Bruins both dropped about 5 percent from the year
before.
<p>
   I'm confused about Vaughn's recent remarks that he's been such a
standup guy for his teammates. Isn't this the same Mo Vaughn who,
early in the season, said the team was lousy because it didn't have
good players and blamed management for not bringing in better ones?
Is that standing up for your teammates?
<p>
   Too bad Williams didn't do with Vaughn what Bruins assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell did last year when Adam Oates made
derogatory remarks about his teammates' caliber. O'Connell called a
team meeting after practice, closed the dressing room door, and
challenged Oates to get up in front of the team and point out the
players he thought were lousy. Oates, from what we are told,
remained silent. After making his point, O'Connell left the room
while Oates reportedly tried to explain to his teammates that he
didn't mean to say they were bad, just that the team was bad.
Somehow that doesn't sound logical.
<p>
   Only about 3,000 tickets will be available to the general public
for the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. The first 20,000 will go
to Red Sox ticket-holders. Then 5,000 will go to the other 29 major
league teams and another 5,000 to Major League Baseball and its
major sponsors. The Red Sox are thinking of holding a lottery to
distribute the final 3,000 tickets. ``I think it will be the
hottest ticket in town,'' says Harrington. Trivia question of the
day: Who was the only Red Sox player to appear in the 1961 All-Star
Game, the last one held in Fenway? Answer at bottom ... A large tip
of the chapeau to Arlington's Tina Noyes, who, 25 years after
competing as one of America's premier figure skaters, enrolled at
Boston College and completed her degree in three years. She has
started the Noyes Agency and is working with fellow former
Olympians who did not win a gold medal but still participated at
the highest level of their sports. ``I finished behind Peggy
Fleming five times, so I can tell these people, `I've been there
and done that,''' says Noyes. ``Even though I'm just at the
beginning, it has been very rewarding to try a life away from
skating and try to find a way to help some very talented people who
are not the greatest of household names. Yet.''
<p>
   Different looks at the Patriots:
<p>
   From A.J. Smith, advance scout of the Buffalo Bills: ``The guy
who is a completely different player from a year ago is Jimmy
Hitchcock. His turnaround has really helped that team. There was a
weakness at that corner, and with Hitchcock playing with the
confidence he is right now, that has become a strength. He not only
covers people but he is also doing a solid job against the run.''
<p>
   From Matt Cavanaugh, offensive coordinator of last Sunday's
opponent, the Chicago Bears: ``They are very solid on defense, with
good balance. We wanted to try to bang away at them with our
running game and get into some good third-down situations where we
could dictate what would happen. We got the third and short
yardage, and they shut us down. They stopped our running game. A
guy that played well against us (who doesn't get much notice) is
(Mark) Wheeler. He is strong against the run but has some moves to
get upfield (with the pass rush).''
<p>
   Rick Pitino says what you see now of the Celtics is what you
will get. ``There will be no changes before training camp that I
can see,'' the coach says. ``We will take the players we have and
get to work. Bringing in other players at this time could be
disruptive. We will go right into double sessions, working defense
in the morning and offense in the afternoon. When you don't let
them shoot the ball in the morning, they are anxious to get to the
offensive session in the afternoon. That's why we schedule it that
way.'' ... There is talk about women possibly officiating NBA games
this year. They might be needed. Two veteran referees, Jess Kersey
and George Toliver, have already pleaded guilty in federal court to
income tax evasion. Two more, Mike Mathis and Hank Armstrong, are
scheduled to go to trial on similar charges. And reportedly, 16
more NBA officials may be involved. These officials have been
targeted by the Internal Revenue Service because they were given
first-class airplane tickets by the league, exchanged them for
cheaper tickets, pocketed the difference, and didn't report it on
their tax returns. Kersey reportedly pocketed more than $100,000
and has now agreed to testify against the others so he can avoid
jail time.
<p>
   Quiz answer: Don Schwall, a righthanded pitcher, threw three
innings in the All-Star Game and was later named American League
Rookie of the Year.

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. software companies
accused the Internal Revenue Service today of ripping off the tax
software they sell to corporate clients.
<p>
   The Software Publishers Association, which represents software
giants Microsoft Corp., Adobe Systems Inc., Netscape Communication
Corp. and others, said the IRS takes computer programs that one
corporation uses to file its taxes and uses them to improve the way
it checks other corporate returns.
<p>
   They said that the IRS wants to use the data behind the
programs, known as a source code. IRS officials say they need the
information to ensure that companies are preparing their taxes
correctly.
<p>
   ``The IRS wants our software and is using the audits of our
corporate customers to try and get it,'' Stephen Winn, the
president of Computer Language Research Inc., told the House Ways
and Means Committee today. ``They want to be able to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of their auditing process by
confiscating software,'' said Winn, who was testifying on behalf of
the Software Publishers Association.
<p>
   Officials at the IRS say they haven't stolen anything. They said
they need access to software to understand the complicated paths
companies, particularly multinational corporations, take to pay
their federal taxes.
<p>
   ``It's absolutely not true,'' said Jodi Patterson, a spokeswoman
for the IRS. ``We need the source code (software) in order to be
able to verify the returns.''
<p>
   The dispute is part of a larger debate over whether corporate
and individual tax-payers need new protections. Over the last three
days, IRS employees and taxpayers have accused the agency of
ignoring federal laws and abusing U.S. citizens in the name of tax
collection in hearings sponsored by the Senate Finance Committee.
<p>
   The hearings have focused national attention on the troubled
agency, virtually ensuring that Congress will take some steps to
overhaul the IRS in the next year. Congress could add additional
protections, known as taxpayer rights, to legislation designed to
improve IRS operations.
<p>
   Acting IRS Commissioner Michael Dolan has unveiled a plan
designed to resolve the complaints and avoid future problems. Dolan
and other senior IRS executives will also meet with Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers
on Sept. 29 to discuss the issue. Summers also plans to convene a
special meeting of the IRS Management Board.
<p>
   ``We want to have a candid conversation about this week's
testimony, the efforts we have already discussed, and what other
actions may be necessary,'' Summers wrote in a letter to Dolan
today. ``Much remains to be done.''
<p>
   Corporations, including software companies, are also hoping
Congress will cut the interest rate companies pay on their IRS
debts as part of any IRS overhaul effort.
<p>
   Today, the federal government pays one interest rate when it
owes a corporation a tax refund, while it imposes a higher rate on
corporations when they owe taxes. Corporate tax lawyers want the
government to charge the same rate for both payments, or at least
lessen the disparity.
<p>
   They have found some support among lawmakers. Equalizing the
rates ``is an issue of fairness,'' said Minnesota Republican Rep.
Jim Ramstad.
<p>
   The National Commission on Restructuring the IRS has unveiled a
plan that would balance the two rates.
<p>
   The Treasury Department is willing to address the issue, but it
has stopped short of endorsing eliminating the difference, said
Donald Lubick, acting assistant secretary for tax policy at the
Treasury Department.

<p>
   Every few years, somebody takes aim at Paul Samuelson's famous
textbook, ``Economics,'' now in its 16th edition and co-authored
with Yale's William Nordhaus. The book will be 50 years old next
year. Things have changed a lot since first Samuelson wrote: It is
time for someone to show how the field has changed. With a little
luck, maybe a new gold standard will emerge.
<p>
   Usually these ventures first take the form of an intermediate
macroeconomics text, on grounds that theories about the behavior of
the economy as a whole are what change most.
<p>
   Thus Robert Barro of Harvard; Jeffrey Sachs, also of Harvard;
David Colander of Middlebury College; Andrew Abel of the University
of Pennsylvania and Ben Bernanke of Princeton; Alan Auerbach of
Berkeley and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University; Olivier
Blanchard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: In the last
decade, they have all written books designed to reach college
upperclassmen. Their deeper purpose has been to demonstrate more
widely how, at the pinnacle of economics, our overall understanding
of the economy has changed during the battles of the last 25 years
over John Maynard Keynes's place in history.
<p>
   At other times, however, textbook writers go for broke and seek
to equip the reader with a new vision of what economics is all
about. From the ground up, they write what they call the Big Book:
an introductory principles text, the kind that freshman read when
first encountering the subject.
<p>
   These are the bolder and more beautiful ventures. Edmund Phelps
(Columbia University) and game theory; Robert Frank (Cornell
University) and behavioral economics; Michael Parkin (the
University of Western Ontario) and economics as a community of
scientists; Joseph Stiglitz (formerly of Stanford University, now
at the World Bank) and the economics of information; John Taylor
(Stanford University) and the economics of innovation and growth:
Each has sought to change the standard way of teaching the subject
 &MD;  and each has failed to make much way in the marketplace.
Samuelson's book and its clones have sailed on, their emphasis on
government stabilization spread like mainsails before the breeze.
<p>
   This autumn it is N. Gregory Mankiw's turn to try.
<p>
   Mankiw's attempt differs from the others in two respects. There
is the money, of course: a vaunted $1.4 million advance. It is the
result of a fundamental shift in power that has taken place between
authors and publishers; other texts now command about as much.
Publisher Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co. has gone to the press to take full
advantage of its outlay, hiring publicists to make the case that
``it must be really good if we paid this much.''
<p>
   But the bigger difference has to do with a clever piece of
indirection. The real target of Mankiw's book is not Samuelson at
all, nor any of the other ambitious attempts to command the heights
of the introductory textbook market. Rather it is a low-brow
alternative by Campbell R. McConnell that has been outselling
Samuelson and all of the other introductory texts for decades, by
appealing to the least-demanding schools. There are a lot more
economics students in the community college system of one
good-sized city than in all of the Ivy League.
<p>
   If he succeeds in replacing the best-selling McConnell  &MD;  whose
book apparently is finally fading after nearly 30 years at the top
of the lists  &MD;  Mankiw just possibly could find himself the author
of the best-selling textbook in the land, by dint of having
conquered the market from the bottom up. At least that's how the
campaign is supposed to work.
<p>
   The usual text in elite colleges and universities these days is
a Samuelson clone: synthetic, encyclopedic, strenuously updated
every three years to keep track of the newest developments. These
thousand-page backpack-busters are masterpieces of successful
pedagogy. But they contain much more material than possibly can be
taught, permitting each professor to pick and choose what he or she
prefers to teach.
<p>
   Behind McConnell, the two top-selling books are of this
high-quality sort, neck and neck: one by Karl Case of Wellesley and
Ray Fair of Yale and the other by Alan Blinder of Princeton and
William Baumol of New York University. Michael Parkin's volume may
be coming up.
<p>
   These are vivid and challenging books; each has its special
characteristics. Samuelson/Nordhaus is extremely smart, reflecting
Samuelson's long experience and the younger Nordhaus's stature near
the top of his generation; Stiglitz's and Taylor's volumes are even
more so. None sells very well.
<p>
   Mankiw's ``Principles,'' on the other hand, eschews any pretense
of being on the cutting edge. Its publisher, the Dryden Press
imprint of Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co., a division of Harcourt General,
says: ``This book is not about new doctrines or new theories. It is
about helping students understand economics so that they will
remember what they learn and become informed, responsible
citizens.''
<p>
   It is a very clever ploy.
<p>
   The conventional wisdom among publishers long has been that a
Harvard professor cannot go very far down the market. State schools
and community colleges constitute the greater part of the texbook
business, and these have been the special province of McConnell, a
professor at the University of Nebraska. He learned early on that
the way to sell textbooks to state schools and junior colleges was
not to make too many demands on the student. He, too, spawned a
host of imitators, teachers accustomed to the slower pace and lower
level of lesser-known schools. The author who has been preparing to
take over McConnell's text is Stanley Brue of Pacific Lutheran
University.
<p>
   If Mankiw succeeds in replacing McConnell, it will be by
supplying a good deal more coherence than is to be found in the
older book. Mankiw's text has many virtues  &MD;  it is slim, clear,
fast-paced. (Thirty percent fewer words per page than McConnell.)
It leaves out much, but includes enough to drive home a few big
standard points: the advantages of trade, the apparatus of supply
and demand, the structure of industry, the importance of policy. It
has all of the latest expository stuff: pretty paintings, cartoons,
boxes with news stories, good definitions, a catechism of 10 easy
``principles'' to memorize (``Markets are usually a good way to
organize economic activity,'' ``Governments can sometimes improve
market outcomes''). It offers a certain amount of support on the
World Wide Web.
<p>
   Moreover, it takes one bold and welcome step by inverting the
usual order in which macroeconomics is presented: The topic of
long-run growth comes first, before the chapter on the fluctuations
of the business cycle, reflecting a deep change in the thinking of
the profession in recent years.
<p>
   ``The first thing I learned about savings was the paradox of
thrift, how if we all saved too much it would cause a depression,''
says Mankiw. ``I thought it made more sense to start with the role
of savings in long-term growth, to show how savings lead to
investment, which in turn causes incomes to rise.''
<p>
   What qualified Mankiw to write the book? Here's where a certain
amount of sleight of hand comes in. He is a first-class expositor,
a thoroughly likable 39-year-old who almost became a lawyer. He is
sensible, quick, cheerful, and self-confident, a good candidate for
the president's Council of Economic Advisers, altogether willing to
become a household word. (His name is pronounced MAN-cue.)
<p>
   But he also has been party to many of the major research
controversies of the past 15 years, first over the origins of the
business cycle, then over the sources of economic growth. And
though the applied, commonsensical engineering point of view with
which Mankiw is associated has won out in many of these battles,
Mankiw himself has contributed relatively little to the debates on
the frontiers of economic research. No matter how many textbooks he
sells, Greg Mankiw is no Paul Samuelson.
<p>
   Indeed, his publisher makes the novel claim that his chief
virtue as an author is that ``Greg Mankiw, in his 20 years of being
a student, had to deal with being a slow reader. He remembers being
frustrated with lengthy textbooks when he was in college and never
having time to get through them all.''
<p>
   Economics textbooks are a big business. There are some 3,500
universities, colleges, and community colleges in the US market.
Some 1 million students take introductory economics every year, and
more than 600,000 of them buy new books, at prices from $59 (for
Mankiw's book) and up. No wonder, then, that teams of editors,
artists, and designers pore over a new text, employing focus groups
and stables of friendly reviewers to perfect a work. The Mankiw
text is as good as modern marketing can make it  &MD;  for the
particular market that it seeks.
<p>
   Will it succeed or fail? It is much too early to say. The
textbook market is not like the market for general-interest books.
Teachers do most of the choosing, and a genteel etiquette among
authors of competing texts prevails  &MD;  on the surface, at least.
That doesn't mean there is no criticism; far from it. But it is
done by salespeople calling on professors, one by one. The process
of trying to sell the Mankiw text into this intricate market is
just beginning.
<p>
   McGraw-Hill, which for years has published both Samuelson and
McConnell, hasn't been heard from yet. Nor have some of the other
publishers in the highly competitive market for introductory texts.
MIT's Paul Krugman, one of the most innovative economists of the
younger generation, is writing a widely anticipated principles
text.
<p>
   Already Mankiw's text is having an interesting effect on the
market. The second edition of John Taylor's critically
well-received textbook, due out in November, has been cut by nearly
200 pages. If Mankiw's book even comes close to its announced
long-range goal of selling 180,000 copies a year, economics will
have another new expositor with whom to reckon.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Hilton Hotels
Corp.'s $11.5 billion battle to take over ITT Corp. may decide more
than control of hotels and casinos: it's also the first test of
laws Nevada passed to help draw companies to the state.
<p>
   Nevada rewrote its corporate laws in 1991 to offer companies
based there greater protection against hostile takeovers. The
changes lured ITT to Nevada from Delaware in 1995.
<p>
   A federal judge in Las Vegas will decide next week whether the
change was worth it for ITT -- and Nevada.
<p>
   ``If the business-combination law is upheld, it certainly will
focus some attention on Nevada and may get some Fortune 500
companies' attention,'' said John Fowler, a lawyer who helped draft
the state's law.
<p>
   At stake for ITT and Hilton is whether Nevada's laws permit ITT
to split itself into three separate companies without shareholder
approval. Hilton, which wants shareholders to vote on its $70 a
share bid for ITT, 11 percent above today's closing price, contends
the law doesn't allow ITT directors to act on their own.
<p>
   At stake for Nevada is the viability of its campaign to bring
corporations to the state.
<p>
   Since the early 1900s, corporations have flocked to incorporate
in Delaware and New York to take advantage of statutes granting
favorable tax status and takeover protections.
<p>
   Delaware generates 20 percent of its $1.8 billion annual budget
from corporate taxes and fees. It's the nation's favorite corporate
haven. More than 214,000 companies are incorporated there -- almost
one for every three residents of the state. Of the Fortune 500
largest U.S. companies, almost 60 percent call Delaware their
corporate home.
<p>
   Nevada officials decided in 1990 that they wanted some of the
revenue generated by incorporations, Fowler said. So lawyers
rewrote Nevada's laws to give companies and their directors even
stronger protections than they could find in Delaware.
<p>
   Historically, most states require directors to base a decision
to accept or reject a takeover bid solely on the interests of
shareholders. Nevada law permits the board to take into account the
interests of a wider community, including suppliers, employees,
creditors and customers.
<p>
   While Delaware allows shareholders to remove corporate directors
with a majority vote, Nevada requires a two-thirds vote. Moreover,
Nevada corporate law doesn't give outsiders the right to call a
special shareholders meeting to vote on acquisition proposals. Only
the current board can do that.
<p>
   ``The goal was to provide protection from predatory corporate
raiders, but not to go to crazy extremes,'' Fowler said. ``We
weren't trying to lock companies up forever under statute.''
<p>
   Nevada's effort to become ``the Delaware of the West'' is paying
off, said Vicki Means, spokeswoman for the Nevada Secretary of
State's office.
<p>
   Since 1991, the number of corporations making their homes in
Nevada doubled to 32,000. Nevada's now the 10th largest state in
numbers of new incorporations, Means said.
<p>
   Last year, new incorporation fees amounted to $15.4 million of a
$3.9 billion state budget, Nevada officials said.
<p>
   ``Now we are getting inquiries from around the nation and around
the world about incorporating in Nevada,'' Means said. ``At this
rate, we expect to be the seventh on the list of states with most
new incorporations by the year 2,002.''
<p>
   Nevada's success hardly has Delaware officials shaking in their
wingtips, though.
<p>
   Other than ITT, there haven't been any defections from
Delaware's roster of Fortune 500 corporate residents to the sun and
sands of Nevada, said Larry Hammermesh, a Widener University Law
School professor specializing in Delaware corporate law.
<p>
   ``Many states have done what Nevada did, which was essentially
to copy Delaware's corporate statutes,'' Hammermesh said. ``What
states like Nevada don't have is a court system that is designed to
provide rational and predictable interpretations of those
statutes.''
<p>
   Delaware's Chancery Court judges are nationally recognized
authorities on merger and acquisition law and federal judges
frequently rely on their opinions for guidance, Hammermesh said.
<p>
   In fact, U.S. District Judge Phillip Pro in Las Vegas may have
to use Delaware takeover decisions to decide Hilton's takeover bid
for ITT, said Ilan Reich, a New York lawyer specializing in mergers
and acquisitions.
<p>
   ``The reality is that federal courts follow Delaware because
they provide a consistent pattern of rulings to rely on,'' Reich
said. ``There just aren't that many takeovers litigated in
Nevada.''
<p>
   That could all change. --Jef Feeley in the Wilmington, Delaware,

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- PacifiCare Health Systems
Inc. and other health plans may see their 1998 Medicare pay raise
reduced if the government decides to fix a glitch in the formula
for calculating payments.
<p>
   If not fixed, the glitch could lead to an overpayment of $90
million next year to HMOs serving Medicare, the government health
insurance program for the elderly, according to a research report
issued today by Prudential Securities analysts Barbara Dreyfuss and
Charles Boorady..
<p>
   ``HMOs wound up with a bigger net increase than was intended by
the Medicare (savings) bill'' signed into law by President Bill
Clinton last month, Boorady said.
<p>
   The Prudential report caused a decline in shares of PacifiCare
and United Healthcare Corp. Shares in PacifiCare, the nation's
largest Medicare HMO, fell 1 15/16 to close at 67 13/16 on trading
of 825,000 shares, compared to three-month average daily trading
volume of 611,000 shares. Shares in United HealthCare fell 11/16 to
close at 49 15/16. Shares in Oxford Health Plans Inc. rose 3 1/16
to close at 78.
<p>
   Boorady said Oxford shares were up, because the Norwalk,
Connecticut-based company had made a more conservative estimate of
what the final rate increase would be. The U.S. Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, is aware of the
glitch, but no decision has been made whether to reduce the 1998
increase, an HCFA official said today. Earlier this month, the
Clinton administration announced that HMO payments would rise 2.6
percent on average nationwide next year and would actually be held
to 2 percent in many counties where HMOs serve senior citizens.
<p>
   The new rates were based on balanced-budget legislation, signed
into law last month by Clinton, that will squeeze Medicare payments
to HMOs by more than $20 billion over five years.
<p>
   About 5 million, or 12 percent, of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in HMOs. HMOs are paid a lump sum to care for Medicare
beneficiaries, and the payment is adjusted in each county to take
into account regional differences in the cost of care and the
health status of enrollees.
<p>
   PacifiCare said its Medicare premiums would rise about 2.6 based
on their calculation of rate increases in various counties that it
serves around the country.
<p>
   Boorady, however, said that PacifiCare and United Healthcare
would have gotten increases closer to 2 percent if it were not for
the overpayment calculated by the government.
<p>
   Government ``officials are considering changing the way they
calculated the rates, saving Medicare possibly as much as $90
million in 1998 and more in future years,'' Boorady and Dreyfuss
wrote.

<p>
   Charlotte, North Carolina, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Nucor Corp.
is likely to cut prices for hot-rolled steel coils, used mainly to
make autos and appliances, by $25 a ton, or about 7 percent, to
fend off new competitors, an analyst said.
<p>
   The move could shave as much as 15 cents from per-share earnings
next year, said Charles Bradford, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
<p>
   Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor, which produces nearly 4
million tons a year of hot-rolled steel, doesn't want to lose
ground to newcomers such as Trico Steel Co., Bradford said. New and
expanded mills are expected to add about 10.7 million tons to the
hot-rolled steel supply by the end of next year.
<p>
   ``Nucor's order book isn't very good and they're being undercut
by a number of other folks,'' Bradford said. ``Nucor is not going
to let these new guys eat their lunch.''
<p>
   Nucor officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment.
<p>
   Bradford said he expects Nucor to earn $3.75 a share in 1998,
less than the $3.95 consensus estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
IBES International Inc. Lower scrap prices should help offset the
effect of the price cut, he added.
<p>
   Nucor is the largest U.S. operator of mini-mills, which use
electric furnaces to melt scrap metal and mold it into low volumes
of steel bar and sheet. They generally cost less to operate than
large mills, which process iron to make steel.
<p>
   Trico, a joint venture of LTV Corp., British Steel Plc and
Japan's Sumitomo Metal Industries, came on line in March and
produced about 40,000 tons of hot-rolled coils in the second
quarter. The Alabama mill eventually will produce well over 100,000
tons a year.
<p>
   Hot-rolled sheet prices averaged $350 a ton in July, up 4.7
percent from the same month a year ago, according to Purchasing
Magazine. Prices are unlikely to fall rapidly because imports are
expected to decrease, tightening the U.S. supply, Bradford said.
<p>
   Hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet, which has a smoother finish
and is used on the outside of autos and appliances, account for
about half of all U.S. steel shipments.

<p>
   The Boston Celtics Limited Partnership  &MD;  despite the second
worst record in the National Basketball Association  &MD;  managed to
turn a profit of $420,000 in the fiscal year ended June 30,
according to documents filed Friday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
<p>
   That's down from $54.2 million net income in fiscal 1996, but
that year the partnership picked up an extra $105 million by
selling Channel 25 to Fox Television Stations Inc. It wasn't so
lucky this year; the partnership had to rely on ticket sales and
promotional revenues.
<p>
   In fiscal 1997, Celtics revenues fell to just under $63 million,
compared to $64.8 million in 1996.
<p>
   Results for the year were dragged down by the financial burdens
of the team's rebuilding program.
<p>
   For coaching the Boston Celtics to 15 wins in the 1996-97
season, and stepping aside gracefully for new coach Rick Pitino,
M.L. Carr took home $2 million in salary and bonus. Pitino received
$750,000 in salary and a deferred bonus of $600,000.
<p>
   The big money starts rolling in for Pitino this year, when he
will earn $6.75 million a year for the next six years, and $2
million a year for four years after that.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the team paid $4.5 million to buy out the contract of
power forward Dino Radja, and another $4 million on salaries and
bonuses for new staff, and severance expenses for people let go
during the restructuring.
<p>
   Richard Pond, the Celtics' chief financial officer, predicted
that the Pitino era will lead to increasing ticket sales and more
successful promotional tie-ins. Pond noted that when tickets for
the upcoming Celtics season went on sale, over 1,000 fans lined up
on the first day. By hiring Pitino and revamping the lineup ``what
we have effectively done is change the image of the team,'' Pond
said.
<p>
   Another revenue boost could result from a new promotional deal
with a Boston-area bank. Dissatisfied with its deal with Fleet
Financial Group, the Celtics are discussing a link with Citizens
Financial Group.
<p>
   Fleet reportedly has balked at the Celtics request that the bank
spend $6 million over the next five years on Celtics-related
marketing efforts. But Citizens may be willing to pay the price.
<p>
   Boston Celtics Limited Partnership shares fell 1/4 Friday to 25
1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Phoenix, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Phoenix Coyotes suspended
All-Star left wing Keith Tkachuk indefinitely for refusing to play
while seeking a contract extension.
<p>
   Tkachuk, the Coyotes' leading scorer last season, has three
years remaining on a five-year, $17.2 million contract he signed in
October 1995. He is set to earn $2.8 million this season. If he
doesn't report to the National Hockey League team by Oct. 1, he
won't be paid.
<p>
   The Coyotes asked the 25-year-old Tkachuk, who had 52 goals, 34
assists and 228 penalty minutes in 81 games last season, to play in
tomorrow's preseason game against the Dallas Stars and he refused.
<p>
   He also refused to play in the club's regular season home opener
Wednesday against the Chicago Blackhawks unless he has a new
contract, the team said.
<p>
   Tkachuk, who last season became only the fourth player in league
history to record at least 50 goals and 200 penalty minutes in a
single season, is the second player to be suspended in the NHL this
past week.
<p>
   The Washington Capitals suspended right wing Peter Bondra Sept.
19 after he refused to play in a preseason game. Bondra, the
Capitals' leading goal-scorer four of the past five seasons, has
two years and $3.75 million remaining on his contract.

SUVS AREN'T TOO BIG; THE CARS ARE TOO TINY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Can somebody please resurrect the Cold War? Bring back the Red
Menace? Renovate the Russky threat? Life was a lot simpler in this
country when the government knew who the enemy was  &MD;  and it wasn't
us.
<p>
   Wednesday of this week, The New York Times devoted a significant
piece of news real estate to expounding on the new threat to the
peace and well-being of the American people: The Sport/Utility! The
Times has dutifully reported what the government has discovered, no
doubt after exhaustive (and expensive) study and hours of committee
meetings, and what anybody over 6 with an IQ slightly larger than
their shoe size could have figured out instantly: When big things
hit small things, the small things get the worse of it.
<p>
   Actually, it was a well-written piece, packed with information
and quotes, and a must-read for anyone who owns a car, but
especially those who own sport/utilities, hereinafter referred to
as SUVs. You'll get an idea what's in store if somebody doesn't get
a handle on the antifun lobby. Handle? Chains, please.
<p>
   The current anticar thinking seems to be that big SUVs hurt
little cars mightily when they collide, so we should (a) alter SUVS
so that won't happen  &MD;  which probably calls for repealing the laws
of physics; (b) ban SUVs; (c) regulate SUVs out of showrooms and
off the streets.
<p>
   All right, readers, I ask this question: Are SUVs too big or are
cars getting too small, too tinny, too insubstantial?
<p>
   The federal government decided to regulate fuel consumption,
something the market would have accomplished without federal help;
Americans are not stupid, no matter what your government would have
you believe. But the feds determined that cars would instantly be
fuel efficient. That translates to lighter and smaller because
weight and size  &MD;  size determines wind resistance  &MD;  consume fuel.
It also led to small cars without heavy frames  &MD;  so-called
monocoque construction. SUVs, for the most part, are built on
frames.
<p>
   So, cars contain plastics (made from oil) in abundance, aluminum
(more expensive than steel, lighter but not as tough in a crash)  &MD; 
cars these days contain almost anything you can name, except a
6-foot, 3-inch human. Even the so-called mid-size is a 4-passenger
for medium to small people.
<p>
   But, when the station wagon died, families could not lay off
children or downsize their bodies. Enter the minivan, a vehicle
that would hold adults, children, lots of stuff  &MD;  but not a lot of
weight. Minivans can't pull much of anything.
<p>
   While the Boys Within the Beltway, down in D.C. where
regulations are manufactured, were shoving little cars at us, they
were also  &MD;  in the name of fuel efficiency  &MD;  allowing bigger trucks
on the road. Your commuter car is as big as a 1950 doghouse, the
monster in your rear-view mirror is a truck the size and weight of
a five-story building laid horizontal on wheels, and you're
worrying about ... a Nissan Pathfinder?
<p>
   Not every SUV is a GMC Suburban  &MD;  and they don't fare well
against semis, either. But before we panic into allowing the BWB
eliminating what most Americans seem to want these days  &MD;  an SUV
tall enough to see the road, big enough to pull a boat, and roomy
enough for a grownup  &MD;  lets examine a few alternatives.
<p>
    &MD; Smaller trucks. I'm tired of sharing the road with behemoths
driven by overtired ``independent contractors.'' (That's a guy who
used to have a job but now has longer hours, a contract, and no
benefits.)
<p>
    &MD; Larger cars. SUVs aren't too big; cars are too small.
<p>
    &MD; Driver education. See last week's column  &MD;  improperly trained,
incompetent young drivers grow up to become incompetent adult
drivers given to road rage because nobody taught them any manners
or skills.
<p>
   The problem seems to be that the Boys Within the Beltway don't
have a clue what working stiffs need in a car. They need room and
comfort, not Big Brother in the passenger seat.
<p>
   You cannot legislate a perfect world. Life is a risk. Regulation
is certainly in order to eliminate peril created by business greed
 &MD;  at least as much as reasonably possible  &MD;  but we are regulating
away individual responsibility in the process of protecting
everybody from everything. Learn how to drive; stay out of
accidents.
<p>
   Meanwhile, if the BWB want to be helpful, give us back the
interurban trolleys, give us the fast reliable commuter trains
they're always blathering about, and do something about oversized
trucks.
<p>
   Oh yes, and while we're at it, how about issuing every
bureaucrat his/her own electric car and make them use it. That'll
give 'em a taste of reality. Meanwhile, go away and leave us alone.
<p>
   Sunday., Oct. 5, you have a couple of choices: Hit the road or
go see Bentley cars.
<p>
   That day is the annual Grand 44 road rally of the Touring Club
of New England. The rally is not a race but a time/distance
precision driving event in classes according to experience. Novices
are more than welcome.
<p>
   The first car is off at 11:31 from the Burger King, Route 38,
Tewksbury, Mass., for a 95-mile tour of glorious New England
countryside. Registration begins at 10:30 a.m., and the entry fee
is $20 for nonmembers, $15 for members of TCNE. For particulars,
telephone (978) 256-7285.
<p>
   That day also, the Museum of Transportation sponsors Bentley Day
 &MD;  actually it's a Bentley Hour and a Half. The cars will be on view
only from noon until 1:30 but what cars! Some 25 Bentleys were to
be shipped from England for the event in Brookline, Mass., and
joined by area Bentley and Rolls-Royce clubs. For information,
telephone the museum at (617) 522-6547.

<p>
   When Kansas City Southern Industries announced this month that
it would separate its fast-growing mutual fund business from its
century-old railroad, Wall Street cheered. And it gave an extra
hurrah to the Janus Funds, the Kansas City Southern subsidiary
whose rapid expansion caused its parent to predict that
third-quarter earnings would exceed Wall Street's expectations by
35 percent.
<p>
   That torrid growth comes as assets under management at the Janus
Capital Corp., which manages the Janus funds and is 83 percent
owned by Kansas City Southern (the rest by management), have soared
by 48 percent this year, to $68 billion from the end of 1996. That
dwarfs the gains at Berger Associates, the other portion of Kansas
City Southern's fund family, whose $4 billion in assets have grown
by only about 10 percent since the end of last year.
<p>
   But Kansas City Southern shareholders may well wonder whether
that robust pace of growth can be maintained. Like the Roman god
for which Janus is named, the fund company appears to have two
faces, facing in opposite directions.
<p>
   Roughly three-quarters of the new cash that has flowed into the
Janus funds since the beginning of 1996 has gone into two
international portfolios overseen by one manager. The flow of money
into the 10 Janus equity funds that invest primarily in the United
States, however, has been steadily declining  &MD;  and since April,
might have dried up entirely.
<p>
   That raises the question of whether much of the recently
invested money will turn and flee if performance of those two
international funds turns down, taking with it much of the
potential for further earnings surprises at Kansas City Southern.
<p>
   For its part, Kansas City Southern is optimistic.
<p>
   ``We are pretty strong in our belief that Janus has a lot of
growth potential ahead of it,'' said Bill Galligan, a spokesman for
the parent company, which is based in Kansas City.``While the two
international funds have been incredibly successful, we have seen
an upward swing in the other funds too.''
<p>
   To be sure, the profit gains at Janus have come not only from
new cash flowing into the funds, but also from admirable
performance. Through August, eight of the 12 Janus equity funds
ranked in the top half of their peer groups, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracking company.
<p>
   A couple of funds have done particularly well, in fact. The
Janus Special Situations fund, started at the end of last year, has
gained 42 percent this year, putting it in the top 1 percent of
growth-stock funds tracked by Morningstar. Janus Growth and Income,
a six-year-old fund, is up 31 percent since the beginning of the
year, near the top of its peer group.
<p>
   And the Janus Overseas and Janus Worldwide funds, the two
international portfolios managed by Helen Young Hayes, not only
ranked at the top of their peer groups during the last three years
but have each gained about 24 percent since the beginning of the
year, still well above their peers.
<p>
   The continuing good performance of the Janus equity funds has
attracted a steadily rising tide of new cash flows over all.
According to the twice-yearly financial reports issued by the
funds, in April and October, cash flows to all Janus equity funds
climbed from $1.9 billion in the six months ended April 1996 to $4
billion a year later.
<p>
   And in the first eight months of 1997, net inflows to the Janus
funds  &MD;  that is, new share purchases less redemptions and excluding
reinvested dividends  &MD;  totaled $5.9 billion.
<p>
   But the two international funds have accounted for an
ever-larger percentage of the total, while both the percentage and
total dollars flowing into the domestic stock funds have fallen.
This year, through August, at least $4.9 billion  &MD;  or 83 percent  &MD; 
has gone into the two international funds, up from 45 percent early
last year.
<p>
   Those figures come from Janus. AMG Data Services, an outside
company that tracks industry cash flows, believes the disparity is
even greater  &MD;  that $5.6 billion, or 95 percent, of flows this year
through August have gone into the two international portfolios.
<p>
   Moreover, according to AMG's data, since April the Janus funds
that invest primarily in American stocks have suffered net outflows
of nearly $150 million.
<p>
   Janus disputes AMG's numbers. Chrissy Snyder, a vice president
at Janus, said that while some individual funds have experienced
outflows since April, the domestic equity funds have taken in money
over all.
<p>
   The larger issue, however, concerns the quandary in which fund
companies often find themselves when huge cash flows follow a
particular fund's hot performance.
<p>
   Often, that money comes from investors who use the mutual fund
supermarkets, like that of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. In general, those
customers tend to be fickle, leaving a fund once performance turns
down, which can quickly deflate a portfolio's assets.
<p>
   Ms. Snyder said that less than one-third of the company's
overall cash flows came from mutual fund supermarkets. The relative
imbalance of recent flows into the Janus funds, she said, ``is not
something that concerns us.
<p>
   ``Cash flows always follow the hot performance,'' she said.
``That is very typical of this business. Do we have everything
riding on two funds? Absolutely not.''
<p>
   Russ Kinnel, equity editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, has some
reservations, however. He notes that while Janus has thrived by
introducing new funds whose strong, early performance has attracted
large amounts of money, many of those funds are fairly similar in
their investment objectives.
<p>
   ``There is a question how long they can do that if all they
create are variations on `growth at a reasonable price,' '' he
said. ``They don't seem to want to attempt any value funds, for
instance. And some of the older, bigger funds have not been doing
as well.''
<p>
   To steady its asset base, Janus has been trying to attract more
retirement plans. They currently account for $10 billion of its $68

 &UR; GLOBAL COMMODITIES: OIL RISES AFTER COLOMBIAN PIPELINE BOMBING &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a summary of
the latest global commodity markets worldwide.
<p>
   In NEW YORK, crude oil surged to a four-month high after the
bombing of a Colombian pipeline raised concern that exports to the
U.S. could be disrupted at a time of low inventories.
<p>
   The bombing was the 51st this year and came just two days after
state oil company Ecopetrol repaired the line from the previous
attack. The attacks are coming with U.S. crude oil inventories
lagging year-ago levels by 2.7 percent, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Colombia is the ninth-largest oil exporter to
the U.S.
<p>
   Prices rose in early trading as investors who follow charts for
technical evidence of market direction took four consecutive days
of gains as a signal to buy futures contracts.
<p>
   ``The pipeline news has added to today's gains,'' said Steve
Bellino, a senior trader at ABN Amro Chicago Corp. in New York.
<p>
   Crude oil for November delivery rose 48 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $20.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
for a contract closest to expiration since June 2. Crude prices
gained 7.9 percent this week.
<p>
   The jump in crude pulled heating oil higher. October heating oil
rose 1.41 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 57.92 cents a gallon. Heating
oil prices have risen in recent days as forecasts for cooler
weather in the U.S. Northeast prompted speculators and oil
marketers to buy contracts.
<p>
   In LONDON, Brent crude oil for November delivery rose 42 cents,
or 2.2 percent, to $19.56 a barrel on the International Petroleum
Exchange.
<p>
   In NEW YORK, cocoa prices fell amid speculation that crops in
West Africa, in the early stages of harvest, were less damaged than
expected by dry weather.
<p>
   Last year, the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower,
produced about 1.15 million tons of cocoa. Estimates for this
year's harvest range as low as 850,000 tons on expectations that
unusually dry weather damaged the crop.
<p>
   Now, recent rain is leading traders to revise their forecasts.
Because the bulk of harvesting won't take place until November, the
moisture will have time to reinvigorate the crop.
<p>
   ``There was really dry weather along the Ivory Coast during
September, but for most of the summer, temperatures were close to
normal, and that may mean that less of the crop was damaged and
should come in close to about 1 million tons,'' said Walter Spilka,
a commodity analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in New York. ``We could
see cocoa beans smaller when the harvest comes in, and they'll have
to put more beans in bags to meet the yields.''
<p>
   Cocoa for December delivery fell $35, or 2 percent, to $1,668 a
metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.
<p>
   In NEW YORK, silver rose to a four-month high as strong demand
from investors and manufacturers in Europe contributed to a decline
in exchange stockpiles
<p>
   Silver inventories in warehouses monitored by the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.2 million troy ounces,
or 0.9 percent, to 141.4 million ounces, the exchange said after
trading yesterday. Comex silver stockpiles have fallen 30 percent
since the first of June, the result of strong demand in both Europe
and the U.S.
<p>
   Demand for silver and other precious metals is rising, in part,
as jewelers step up production to fill orders from retailers for
the end-of-year gift-giving season in North America and Europe.
<p>
   ``Inventories are dropping, and that's sending prices higher,''
said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New
York. ``The silver is heading to London, as there is supply
tightness in Europe, (where) there is both industrial and
investment demand.''
<p>
   Silver for December delivery rose 3.7 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$4.822 an ounce on the Comex, the highest price since May 29.
December gold was little changed at $329 ounce, down 50 cents.
<p>
   In LONDON interbank trading, spot silver rose 3 cents to $4.82
an ounce, while spot gold fell 40 cents to $326.75 an ounce.
<p>
   In NEW YORK, copper prices were steady close to a nine-month low
as strong demand from copper tube and wire makers in the U.S.
offset weak Asian demand.
<p>
   A spate of government reports show a healthy U.S. economy. The
nation's Gross Domestic product rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate
in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. While that's
down from the department's Aug. 28 estimate of a 3.6 percent rise,
it still shows a strong economy. Yesterday the Commerce Department
said orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items such as aircraft
and refrigerators -- rose a larger-than-expected 2.7 percent to a
record $186.598 billion.
<p>
   Consumption from U.S. manufacturers has kept the copper market
from collapsing under the growing weight of stockpiles in London
Metal Exchange warehouses. LME inventories are at a 19-month high
of 3,025 metric tons.
<p>
   ``The GDP and other reports are certainly positive for copper,''
said John Gross, vice president of strategic metals at BICC Cables
Corp. in West Nyack, New York. ``Good overall demand in the U.S. is
keeping the market reasonably steady in the face rising stockpiles
and the Asian economic downturn.''
<p>
   Copper for December delivery rose 0.45 cent, or 0.5 percent, to
95.2 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
<p>
   In LONDON, Copper for delivery in three months rose $12, or 0.6
percent, to $2,100 a metric ton (95.25 cents a pound) on the London
Metal Exchange.
<p>
   In CHICAGO, wheat fell to a two-month low after Pakistan bought
twice as much wheat from Australia as from the U.S., signaling
rising competition on the world market.
<p>
   Pakistan purchased 400,000 metric tons of Australian wheat and
only 200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat in a tender yesterday,
according to a U.S.-based official of the Australian Wheat Board.
Speculation also swept the market that Egypt, one of the world's
biggest wheat importers, could soon buy French wheat.
<p>
   Competition is increasing on the world market as the European
Union, collectively the world's largest exporter, completed its
harvest. Also, supplies from Australia, the world's fourth-largest
exporter, are more plentiful than expected after rain revived dry
crops.
<p>
   ``The main reason for the weakness in the market is the Pakistan
tender,'' said Paul Koltek, a wheat trader at United Grain Corp., a
Portland, Oregon-based wheat exporting firm. ``The trade in general
anticipated there would be a lot more done from the U.S.''
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$3.5725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the contract's
lowest price since July 21.
<p>
   In CHICAGO, hogs fell to a six-month low before the release of a
quarterly government report that was expected to show an increase
in the nation's herd.
<p>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, after trading, was expected
to report that about 60.3 million hogs and pigs likely were on U.S.
farms as of Sept. 1, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, according
to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
<p>
   The increase would come as feed costs declined, making it more
profitable for farmers to raise animals to market weight and
encouraging them to expand their herds.
<p>
   ``We're expecting a bearish report,'' said Dennis Smith, a
broker at LIT Investor Services in Chicago.
<p>
   October hogs fell 0.475 cent, or 0.7 percent, to 69.25 cents a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price for an
active contract since March 19.
<p>
   The price of corn, the primary ingredient in livestock feed,
averaged $2.58 a bushel during the three-month period ended Aug.
31, compared with $4.06 a year earlier.
<p>
   After trading, the USDA reported that the hogs and pig herd was
4.0 percent higher on Sept. 1 at 60.25 million head, in line with
expectations.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  There comes a point late in Wojciech Has' teasingly
labyrinthine three-hour film, ``The Saragossa Manuscript,'' when so
many phantasmagoric stories have sprouted out of one another in
such rapid succession that the mind begins to reel. Questions of
who did what to whom and which adventures were charades invented by
characters who revel in deceit, and which were not, begin to blur
into a surreal comic vision of a world in which reality and fantasy
are indistinguishable. Or at least they become so in the mind of
the film's genially swashbuckling protagonist.
<p>
   When it was first shown in 1965 in a shorter version, the
black-and-white film by the eminent Polish director immediately
acquired the status of a ``trip'' movie for its freewheeling
mixture of comedy, surrealism, and ``Through the Looking
Glass''-like adventures. For its screening at the New York Film
Festival Saturday at 11:30 a.m. at Alice Tully Hall, it has been
restored to its full length. The screening is the opening event of
an 11-film retrospective of Has' work that continues at the Walter
Reade Theater as a sidebar to the festival, through Oct. 10.
<p>
   Adapted from an early-19th-century novel by the Polish author
Jan Potocki, and set at the end of the Napoleonic era, the movie
follows the travels of Capt. Alphonse van Worden (Zbigniew
Cybulski), a Belgian military officer who is making a
cross-European trip to Madrid but keeps getting sidetracked. The
story begins in the heat of battle, as Alphonse, who has fled to a
cabin, is mysteriously attracted to a manuscript whose pictures are
so compelling he barely notices when enemy soldiers arrive to
arrest him.
<p>
   When the enemy soldiers become as entranced as Alphonse by the
manuscript, especially by a drawing of two beautiful princesses,
the film dissolves into an Arabian Nights-like journey in which
Alphonse lives out the book's magical, picaresque adventures. They
unfold as a series of dreams from which Alphonse periodically
awakes to find himself wounded on a battlefield heaped with skulls
beside a gallows on which two executed prisoners still hang.
Fleeing, he meets two sisters, the princesses Emina (Iga
Cembrzynskza) and Zibelda (Joanna Jedryka), who subject him to a
series of tests of his worthiness to marry them. These trials
suggest a goofy, sprawling, all-purpose allegory so overstuffed
with symbolism that it plays as a kind of epic spoof of the form.
<p>
   If Alphonse's soldierly adventures on behalf of the princesses
have the aura of satanic temptations, the voluptuous attractions
thrown in his path appear to be a mishmash of Islamic and Christian
imagery without a clear-cut moral agenda. The film's central skein
of interlocking tales focuses on a hermit priest, later revealed as
a sheik (Kazierz Opalinksi), and his howling one-eyed assistant,
Pacheco (Franciszek Pieczka), who at first seems to be possessed by
demons but who may be faking. As Pacheco tells his life story, it
spins off into a cycle of monologues with one character after
another becoming the chief storyteller relating fantastic tales of
sexual intrigue, skulduggery and Faustian bargaining. Especially in
the last hour, you may catch yourself trying to find your way
through what amounts to a narrative maze.
<p>
   What does it all mean? The movie is really an extended jokey
meditation on reality and illusion, in a self-mocking comic style
that keeps emotion at arm's length. After emerging from this
pleasurably robust storybook world, it might take you a few minutes
to figure out which end is up.

 &UR; DOLLAR SEEN RISING VS YEN, POUND ON `TANKAN,' U.K. EMU TALK &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar is seen gaining
against the yen next week if, as anticipated, Japan's closely
watched ``tankan'' survey shows managers are growing less confident
about their companies' prospects.
<p>
   Sterling is expected to extend this week's losses amid
expectation that Great Britain will join Europe's economic and
monetary union soon after its gets underway in 1999.
<p>
   The most closely watched part of the Japanese survey -- the
index for major manufacturers -- is likely to fall to 5, compared
with the 8 forecast in last quarter's survey, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. That means executives think that an
April rise in taxes will continue to crimp profits.
<p>
   If the index is in line with or worse than expectations, the
dollar, which was little changed at 121.26 yen today from 121.13
yen yesterday, could rise as high as 125 yen in two weeks, said
Dieter Bluhm, a currency trader at Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco.
<p>
   ``I'm not very optimistic for the Japanese,'' he said. And since
the yen's weakness can help the economy by making exports cheaper,
``let's face it -- they'll be happy with the yen at 124 or 125
yen.''
<p>
   The dollar finished the week down 0.76 percent against the yen,
held back by comments earlier this week by Japan's vice finance
minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, who
suggested Group of Seven leaders didn't want the yen to weaken
further.
<p>
   Such comments aren't expected to undermine the dollar much,
Bluhm said. ``That's just him swinging a big stick.''
<p>
   Sakakibara was referring to a statement by Group of Seven
officials in Hong Kong last Saturday, which cautioned against
``excessive depreciation,'' of currencies, in particular the yen.
The Group of Seven includes the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France,
Italy, Germany and Japan.
<p>
   Still, the dollar could be weighed down by trade concerns. The
dollar's strength against the Japanese currency is pushing up the
price of U.S. exports and helping to tilt the balance of trade
further in Japan's favor.
<p>
   U.S. officials have repeatedly called on Japan to do more to
correct that imbalance by stimulating domestic demand. Some traders
are concerned that if the U.S. trade gap keeps widening, U.S.
officials might soften their support for a strong dollar.
<p>
   ``Difficulty with trade issues is growing and could become even
more of a problem,'' said Bob Savage, chief currency trader at
Lehman Brothers.
<p>
   Just yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Japan's trade surplus is causing concern in Washington,
according to reports. That echoed comments by U.S. Deputy Trade
Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.
<p>
   ``The U.S. administration is on the offensive,'' said Michael
Scarlatos, a currency strategist at Bankers Trust New York Corp.
``Witness Barshefsky's language yesterday.''
<p>
   Sterling could fall further next week on talk that the U.K. is
warming to the idea of joining Europe's planned economic and
monetary union soon after it gets under way in January 1999.
<p>
   The British currency tumbled against the dollar and other major
currencies today after an unidentified cabinet minister told the
Financial Times the British government is more eager to join
Europe's single currency, or euro, than it was several months ago.
<p>
   Sterling climbed 25 percent against the German mark since August
1996, lifted by a booming economy, higher interest rates and
expectations Britain wouldn't join monetary union at the outset.
Now, the U.K. might need to cut interest rates to bring them in
line with rates elsewhere in Europe to join the union.
<p>
   ``If the markets start to believe U.K. interest rates will come
down to levels seen in Germany and France, sterling will come down
relative to other currencies,'' said Chris Iggo, chief economist at
BZW Securities Inc.
<p>
   The pound tumbled 1.25 percent versus the dollar, its largest
one-day decline since July 28, to $1.6095 from $1.6299 yesterday.
It also fell to 2.8308 marks from 2.8698 marks, its biggest one-day
drop against the German currency in six weeks.
<p>
   Traders were undeterred in their flurry to sell pounds, even
after the U.K. Treasury dismissed the report as speculation. A
spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said the government is
reserving its option to join monetary union.
<p>
   It's typical of the British government to ``float an idea first
to see how the public reacts,'' said Lehman Brothers' Bob Savage.
This could have been an ``official leak.''
<p>
   Economists reckon the pound is likely to join the single
currency at as low as 2.5 marks, Savage said.
<p>
   The dollar may be held back against the mark next week amid
lingering concern that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, is
preparing to raise interest rates.
<p>
   Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum kept alive those
expectations today, saying the market is right to expect higher
money market rates in the run-up to monetary union. Higher rates
would boost the mark by making some assets denominated in it more
alluring.
<p>
   Boosting confidence in the mark is a growing sense that
``Germany is recovering and that recovery is happening at a much
faster rate than previously forecast,'' said Lehman Brothers'
Savage.

<p>
   I have doomed my 11-year-old son's academic career. I didn't
mean to do it. I didn't even realize that I had done it until this
week, when I attended Back to School Night, his middle school's
open house for parents.
<p>
   I knew I was in trouble almost as soon as I slipped into the
undersized chair. ``Would someone like to define algorithm,'' the
math teacher asked the crowd. As her eyes scanned the suddenly
silent room, I immediately felt my palms begin to sweat, my brow
begin to bead. I was back in Sister Evelynne Catherine's geometry
class, standing for what felt like hours at a blackboard trying in
vain to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, my math mantra  &MD;  ``I
don't know the answer. I don't know the answer. I don't know the
answer''  &MD;  running through my head.
<p>
   My son's math teacher was not engaged in some twisted experiment
to recover traumatic childhood memories the other night. She was
making a joke: an algorithm is a vice president who can keep a
beat. Get it?
<p>
   A math teacher with a sense of humor. How bad could middle
school be? My sense of relief was short-lived, however. ``The worst
thing you can do is tell your child, `I was never any good at
math,''' she warned, her advice reaching my ears about three years
late. I confessed my math phobia when Tim was in third grade
learning to do multiplication ``finger-snapping quick,'' in the
words of his teacher. It didn't take long for him to discover that
Mom could not do the 9s, let alone the 12s.
<p>
   I thought I was being honest, sharing my flaws, letting him know
that parents, too, are fallible. The truth was that this particular
weakness hardly needed verbal confirmation. Tim had seen me try to
balance my checkbook.
<p>
   ``Children internalize that message,'' the teacher explained
logically enough. ``They begin to believe they can't do math
either,'' that it is some inherited trait, like Tim's blue eyes,
his freckles, or his otherwise inexplicable appreciation of
Herman's Hermits. Of course, she was right. She made perfect sense.
One moment of self-revelation and I had undermined my child's
chances for academic success.
<p>
   I was mortified, my humiliation easing only when I realized that
mine was not the only red face in the class. Women of a certain age
all over the room were cringing in recognition. ``Yes, it's you
moms,'' said the math teacher, thankfully a woman herself. ``No
child ever says, `My Dad says he was no good at math in school.'''
<p>
   Fair enough, but how had this teacher escaped ``math block?'' It
was the learning disability of our day. It plagued girls, sort of
like PMS. I myself had an especially acute case. The mere sight of
a math book could bring on a physical reaction akin to delirium
tremens.
<p>
   I made it through Geometry. Sister Trinita gave me passing
grades in Algebra I and Algebra II but it was understood between us
that those D's were acts of Christian charity, not accurate
assessments of my ability. When she learned that I planned to apply
to college, she asked me to consider not taking the chemistry class
I thought was a prerequisite. Her tone was so plaintive, her eyes
so pained, how could I not agree? Why torture us both for another
year?
<p>
   You can imagine my horror 30 years later to hear my son's
sixth-grade science teacher describe the curriculum he will be
studying this year. ``We begin with chemistry,'' she said. ``Mass,

mastered.) ``We'll be covering electro-magnetism and taxonomy.''
Taxonomy? ``But only as it relates to invertebrates.'' I was so
glad she clarified that.
<p>
   It's 1997 and we now know that there's no such thing as ``math
block.'' Carol Gilligan and Title IX taught us that girls just
``internalized'' the expectation that we couldn't do math in much
the same way that we figured we couldn't run an 8-minute mile or
make a basketball shot from the 3-point line.
<p>
   But where does that knowledge leave red-faced women of a certain
age?
<p>
   I myself have taken to sneaking Tim's math book out of his
100-pound backpack in the middle of the night. How hard could it
be, I ask myself? Couldn't I learn along with him, the way I
learned the lyrics to all those Raffi songs 10 years ago? Maybe,
but my hands tremble so violently at the sight of his textbook that
I haven't managed to open it yet.

<p>
   Honey, I shrunk the company  &MD;  again!
<p>
   Never fear. If Rand V. Araskog, the chairman and chief executive
of the ITT Corp., succeeds in splitting up his company for the
second time in as many years, one thing will remain the same: his
generous paycheck.
<p>
   Even though Araskog will be presiding over an ever-smaller
empire  &MD;  one of the five slices taken since 1995  &MD;  his salary is
escaping unscathed and his total compensation should remain quite
ample.
<p>
   ITT wants to break up again in apparent response to a hostile
takeover attempt by the Hilton Hotels Corp. Under the plan, which
was announced in July, ITT Destinations would take the hotel and
casino operations, ITT would consist of ITT World Directories'
telephone-book publishing activities, and ITT Educational Services
would keep the technical-school business, now a majority-owned
subsidiary of ITT. Araskog would head ITT Destinations.
<p>
   Much to Hilton's dismay, this new split-up may be accomplished
without a vote by ITT shareholders. Whether Araskog can go ahead
with that plan is expected to be decided this week by Judge Philip
M. Pro of federal district court in Nevada, who will be weighing
the arguments in a suit brought by Hilton to block the
restructuring.
<p>
   Among those filing friend-of-the-court briefs are two pension
heavyweights who hold ITT stock, the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, or Calpers, and the College Retirement Equities
Fund. ITT delayed its shareholder meeting from May until November,
and some shareholders argue that they have not had enough say in
the company's new look.
<p>
   Once a huge conglomerate, ITT, the former International
Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, has certainly been amoeba-like
under Araskog. With about $25 billion in revenues at the end of
1995, the company spun off its manufacturing businesses into ITT
Industries and its insurance business into ITT Hartford.
<p>
   The current ITT Corp., which is the piece Araskog held on to,
had $6.6 billion in revenues last year, about $5.7 billion of which
came from the operations of the future ITT Destinations.
<p>
   In his 18-year reign at ITT, Araskog has also jettisoned other
parts of ITT, including Rayonier, a forest products company.
<p>
   But this shrinking empire has not meant a much smaller paycheck
for Araskog. According to the preliminary proxy statement filed
earlier this month, ITT Destinations will pay him a base salary of
$2 million. That is the same as his current base salary at the ITT
Corp. and even the same as his base pay in 1995, when ITT was
substantially larger.
<p>
   Further, ITT Destinations has assumed Araskog's employment
contract and will continue to pay him the $2 million a year  &MD;  plus
bonus, of course  &MD;  until October 2000, when he reaches 69.
<p>
   Araskog's salary was already generous, according to Graef
Crystal, a compensation expert in San Diego, who notes that the
size of a company is a major factor in determining how much
executives are paid. According to Crystal, Araskog's $2 million
salary in 1996 was 135 percent above market.
<p>
   Of course, Araskog makes much more than his salary; there are
his bonus and assorted other stock awards, options and perks. When
Crystal calculated the total value of his compensation package, it
came to $8.6 million last year and $18.3 million in 1995. As with
his base pay, ITT Destinations has not altered the terms of these
parts of Araskog's 1997 compensation, according to Jim Gallagher,
an ITT spokesman.
<p>
   Gallagher defends Araskog's pay as worth it even at the smaller
organization. ``Getting paid on the size of the company is
yesterday's thinking,'' he said, arguing that Araskog has created a
tremendous amount of shareholder value.
<p>
   The way ITT figures it, Araskog has rewarded investors with some
$20 billion in value the last 18 years and was paid just 1 percent
of that amount, or roughly $200 million, in compensation in that
time.
<p>
   Investors with all three pieces of the former ITT, he added,
have easily outpaced the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index since
the 1995 split.
<p>
   Still, ITT Corp.'s stock performance is nothing for Araskog to
brag about. Since Dec. 15, 1995, when the new ITT began trading,
the shares have risen only 24 percent, compared with a 53 percent
gain for the S&AMP;P 500. Hilton is offering $70 a share for ITT's
stock, which closed on Friday at $63.

<p>
   Chicago, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Aluminum producers, weary from
years of battle with plastic bottle makers, are unlikely to
recapture the beverage packaging market, industry experts said.
<p>
   The metal has been losing ground to plastic in the U.S. and
European soft drink markets, and severe pricing competition has cut
into profits.
<p>
   As a result, Reynolds Metals Co. stopped making sheet metal for
cans in April and is mulling the sale or spinoff of its $1 billion
packaging unit. Pechiney SA, Europe's largest aluminum producer,
said in March that it plans to cut U.S. can production by 10
percent and would close three aluminum plants.
<p>
   ``The aluminum industry is a barnacle on a plastic ship,'' said
Don Simonsen, vice president of U.S. packaging for Tenneco Inc.
Simonsen spoke at the Aluminum Outlook '98 conference in Chicago.
<p>
   Plastic bottlers, meanwhile, also face challenges. In recent
years, users misgauged supply and bottlers became too ambitious in
the competition with aluminum cans, resulting in excess capacity
that is pushing down prices, analysts say.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Crown Cork &AMP; Seal Co. has said it plans to
close up to eight plastic beverage bottle plants in an effort to
tighten supply.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Salomon Inc.'s top executives
will own Travelers Group Inc. shares worth $65 million after
Travelers buys Salomon, swapping stock of a volatile bond trading
firm for one of the best performing financial companies.
<p>
   Deryck Maughan, chairman of Salomon's investment banking unit,
will swap his 348,425 shares of Salomon stock listed in the firm's
most recent proxy statement and subsequent regulatory filings and
worth $24.9 million the day before the acquisition, for Travelers
shares worth $27.2 million.
<p>
   John Haseltine, who stepped down as head of fixed income late
last year but remains on Salomon's board, is swapping his 252,606
Salomon shares, worth $18.1 million before the transaction, for
Travelers shares worth $19.7 million.
<p>
   Shigeru Myojin, head of the Salomon unit that trades securities
for the firm's own account and one of the highest paid executives
on Wall Street, will own Travelers shares worth $11.4 million.
<p>
   ``They're probably much better off owning Travelers than owning
Salomon shares,'' said John Keefe, an independent securities
analyst. ``The market loves Sandy Weill and gives him the benefit
of the doubt.''
<p>
   Travelers Chairman Sanford Weill, a leading executive on Wall
Street for more than 30 years, built Travelers into a company with
1996 net income of $2.33 billion. His firm, a New York-based
insurer, broker and consumer finance company, agreed to buy Salomon
for about $9 billion in stock Wednesday, paying 1.13 of its shares
for each Salomon share.
<p>
   The transaction will create the second-largest U.S. securities
firm and a financial services powerhouse.
<p>
   Salomon executives will own Travelers shares that rose an
average 45.3 percent a year over the past five years, compared with
19.8 percent annually for the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index. Salomon
stock, by contrast, rose 11.5 percent annually in the same period.
<p>
   Salomon is among Wall Street's most volatile companies because
it derives much of its profit from trading bonds using its own
capital. After losing $399 million in 1994, the worst year for
bonds in a generation, the firm earned $457 million in 1995 and
$617 million last year.
<p>
   Investors penalized Salomon for that volatility. The firm's
shares trade at a multiple of 11.7 times earnings after the shares
rose following announcement of Salomon's sale. Meantime, investors
reward Travelers with a higher multiple of 18 times earnings.
<p>
   Salomon executives did get big paychecks last year even without
the benefit of Travelers stock. The firm paid Myojin, nicknamed
``Sugar,'' $31.4 million in salary, bonus, deferred compensation
and stock. His compensation is tied to Salomon's proprietary
trading profits.
<p>
   Maughan got $11.5 million, including his first bonus in three
years, as Salomon's securities firm almost doubled its pretax
earnings.
<p>
   Travelers paid Weill $8.9 million in salary, bonus, stock and
other compensation last year after the company had its best year
ever.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- New York Mets catcher Todd
Hundley underwent surgery to reconstruct a ligament and remove bone
chips in his right elbow.
<p>
   Mets team physician Dr. David Altchek performed the 2 1/2-hour
surgery. He grafted a tendon from Hundley's left wrist to the
medial collateral ligament in the elbow and arthroscopically
removed bone spurs and chips.
<p>
   ``Both procedures went perfectly,'' Altchek said. ``Todd will be
in a splint for a week and then begin gentle motion exercises in a
restricted brace for the next five weeks.''
<p>
   After the initial six-week rehabilitation period, Hundley will
begin extensive motion and strengthening exercises for the upper
arm.
<p>
   After 16 weeks he will start a light throwing program and at 20
weeks will begin to hit off a batting tee, the team said.
<p>
   ``Return to competitive play will be determined by the
progression of his final phase of rehabilitation,'' Altchek said.
<p>
   Hundley, 28, hit .273 with a team-high 30 home runs and 86 runs
batted in this season.

   Few companies have the problem that faced Fidelity Investments,
the mutual fund giant based in Boston, when it learned last week
that two of the Big Six accounting firms were talking about
merging.
<p>
   Fidelity uses two auditors to look over the books of its empire,
and the two firms that Fidelity now employs, Price Waterhouse and
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, are the ones that plan to couple.
<p>
   That puts Fidelity literally back to square one, when it's two
that it wants. ``Traditionally, we felt it was better to have more
than one firm because of the resources we need,'' said Robyn Tice,
a spokeswoman for Fidelity.
<p>
   Looking over Fidelity's 246 domestic mutual funds ``is a lot of
work,'' Ms. Tice said. Some of the funds, like its flagship
Magellan fund, are audited more than once a year.
<p>
   Coopers handles the corporate audit for the FMR Corp.,
Fidelity's parent, on its own, but it shares perusal of the funds
with Price.
<p>
   While Ms. Tice said Fidelity would not decide what to do until
the merger took place, if it continues the dual-audit practice
there may soon be a great opportunity out there for another
accounting firm.
<p>
   ``Any portion of that, if it goes out to bid, would be a huge
coup for any firm,'' said Suzanne Verity, the editor of Public
Accounting Report, an industry newsletter in Atlanta.
<p>
   Imagine: If Fidelity goes ahead and hires what would be
essentially a third auditor, it would have half the Big Six working
for it.

   Seattle, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Immunex Corp. rose 11
percent after American Home Products Corp. agreed to pay the
biotechnology firm as much as $100 million for the right to sell
its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug.
<p>
   Immunex shares rose 6 3/8 to 66 1/8 in trading of 1.24 million,
triple the three-month daily average of some 402,000. Earlier, they
touched 67, a record high.
<p>
   The drug Enbrel is in the final stages of clinical testing, and
earlier this month showed positive preliminary study results.
Immunex said it expects to file for approval with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration next year.
<p>
   The arrangement is a coup for Immunex because American Home's
Wyeth-Ayerst drug unit already leads the arthritis-drug market with
medicines including Lodine and Naprelan, and has an established
sales force in place.
<p>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Madison, New Jersey-based
American Home will pay Immunex $15 million up front, $20 million
when the company files for FDA approval and $30 million if and when
the drug is approved. The remaining $35 million in payments are
based on sales targets and label expansion.
<p>
   Immunex, based in Seattle, will pay Wyeth-Ayerst an undisclosed
percentage of annual gross profit. Immunex will keep the majority
of annual profit while still paying Wyeth-Ayerst a larger
percentage of profit as sales increase.
<p>
   Immunex also has the option to create its own sales force at any
time to promote Enbrel. If it does, the agreement calls for
Wyeth-Ayerst and Immunex to share sales-force costs.
<p>
   The companies announced the agreement after the market closed
yesterday. American Home shares rose 1 9/16 to 70 5/16.
<p>
   More then 2 million Americans suffer form rheumatoid arthritis
-- a long-term connective tissue disease that is caused when the
body's immune system attacks its own cartilage and joint tissue.
The disease differs from the more common osteo-arthritis, which
typically results from wear and tear to the joints.
<p>
   Centocor Inc. and Roche Holding AG are also working on drugs for
the rheumatoid arthritis.

   C-16 is shorthand for the 16th squad of the Criminal Division in
the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Its mission: tackling the
really big crimes, such as hostage-takings, terrorist threats and
ABC's placement of ``The Practice'' at 10 p.m. Saturday.
<p>
   If ``C-16'' does a bang-up job on the first two, the third may
take care of itself. But if ever a case posed reasonable doubt,
it's the matter of whether two rookie series can deliver a big
enough audience to keep ``The Practice'' in business.
<p>
   As the leadoff hitter in ABC's new Saturday night lineup,
``C-16'' is a distinct alternative to ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''
on CBS. It has more in common with ``The Pretender,'' which NBC
will move into the 8 p.m. position Nov. 1, but there still is
sufficient variance to offer viewers a clear choice.
<p>
   What's most noteworthy is that, despite a goofy decision to
present the show in letterbox format (black bars across the top and
bottom of the TV screen), ``C-16'' isn't that bad. This guarantees
it nothing in the squirrelly world of TV programming, but better to
be remembered for something other than unnecessary gimmickry.
<p>
   Eric Roberts plays John Olansky, tough-but-fair leader of the
major-case squad. His hand-picked team runs the gamut from a pair
of green recruits (Morris Chestnut, Angie Harmon) to a crafty
veteran (Zach Grenier).
<p>
   Nothing about ``C-16'' is terribly new. Olansky is the
iconoclast who regularly interprets Bureau procedure according to
his own peculiar rule book, and his team members have the usual
assortment of personal problems: the drug-addicted sibling, the
unreasonable spouse, etc.
<p>
   But the producers (Brillstein-Grey Communications) have packaged
it attractively enough that viewers needn't be contemptuous of the
familiar. In tonight's opener, the first of two parts, the
performances are solid, the writing intelligent and the production
values sufficiently high to assure an hour of worthwhile TV drama.
<p>
   The same cannot be said of ``Total Security.''
<p>
   Oddly, the premiere episode promises something that the show
apparently isn't. James Remar plays Frank Cisco, a no-nonsense
ex-cop who owns a private security firm; James Belushi plays Steve
Wegman, an unreliable, unrestrainable lout who wheedles a job out
Cisco. Cisco is serious, Wegman is anything but, and tonight's
episode bounces blithely, if a bit uncertainly, between high drama
and low comedy.
<p>
   The second episode, however, reverts to standard drama, with
Wegman's clowning toned down dramatically. The result is an
incredibly boring, average piece of work from Steven Bochco
Productions.
<p>
   Remar, a student of the Lance Henriksen School of Expressionless
Acting, could actually double as a sleeping aid. Belushi is much
more animated, but ``Total Security'' probably shouldn't feel too
secure about its future, or its ability to bring clients to ``The
Practice,'' a quality show that deserves better support from ABC.
<p>
   Speaking of practice, the cast of ``Jenny'' could use a little
bit more. Ready or not, ``Jenny'' has its debut tomorrow on NBC,
lifting Jenny McCarthy from the obscurity of cable to the glare of
mainstream network TV.
<p>
   Not that McCarthy isn't used to the bright lights. She appeared
in Playboy before landing a job on MTV's ``Singled Out,'' a sort of
``The Dating Game'' for morons. That propelled her to a
comedy/variety show last season, also on MTV, and tomorrow she
invades prime time on the No. 1 network with a buddy comedy that
won't exactly be missed when it's canceled.
<p>
   McCarthy and Heather Paige Kent play Jenny and Maggie, best
friends from Utica, N.Y., who decide to move to California after
Jenny's father, a B-movie actor she never knew, dies and bequeaths
his estate to her.
<p>
   George Hamilton plays the father, Guy Hathaway, and Jenny
gradually gets to know him through videos and film clips, but the
show would be a lot funnier if Jenny were watching ``King of the
Hill,'' which airs in the same time slot.
<p>

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100 ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, September 26 -- The following chart shows how senators
and representatives voted on key bills and amendments this week. A
``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the
member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not
vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
<p>
   SENATE VOTES:
<p>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LABELS
<p>
   The Senate Tuesday rejected, 65-35, a measure to strengthen the
Food and Drug Administration's authority to review medical devices.
The amendment to an FDA overhaul bill would have allowed the agency
to test medical devices for applications other than their specified
use. Supporters of the amendment said that the tests would have
prevented companies from pushing through instruments intended for
uses other than those specified, which could endanger consumers.
Opponents argued that it was a bureaucratic impediment that would
strangle progress and limit potential technological benefits to
patients. A ``yes'' vote opposes the amendment.
<p>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FDA
<p>
   The Senate Thursday approved, 98-2, a bill to speed Food and
Drug Administration approval of new drugs and medical devices. The
bill would also give patients greater access to drugs under review,
provide companies more flexibility in disseminating information on
drug uses that are not approved by the FDA, and ease restrictions
on health claims of products. Supporters said the bill ensured a
stronger and more efficient FDA. Opponents said that consumers
could be endangered by false labeling of medical devices. A ``yes''
vote favored the FDA overhaul.

   HOUSE VOTES:
<p>
   1) BILL NUMBER: RAISE
<p>
   The House Thursday rejected, 229-199, a bid to block the
congressional cost of living adjustment. The measure would have
stopped a bill increasing annual congressional pay 2.3 percent from
$133,600 to $136,673. Supporters of the pay increase said that
Congress deserved it and the raise only adjusted the salary in
accordance with inflation. Opponents said that Congress did not
deserve the pay raise because the budget was not yet balanced. A
``yes'' vote favored the cost of living adjustment.
<p>
   2) BILL NUMBER: LAWYERS
<p>
   The House Thursday approved, 340-84, a bill entitling defendants
acquitted in federal criminal cases to reimbursement for their
legal expenses. The bill would require U.S. attorneys offices to
pay a defendant up to $125 an hour in legal fees unless the
government can prove it was justified in its prosecution.
Supporters said the bill was necessary to ensure that citizens
aren't unjustly prosecuted by the federal government. Opponents
said the measure would have a harmful impact on the justice system
by encouraging additional litigation. A ``yes'' vote favors
reimbursement.

<p>
   Portland, Oregon, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The Portland Trail
Blazers signed free agent forward Vincent Askew.
<p>
   The 6-foot-6 Askew spent last season with the New Jersey Nets,
Indiana Pacers and Denver Nuggets, averaging 5.6 points and 2.3

   ``He's a strong defender and a good ballhandler who knows how to
play and brings a lot of regular season and playoff experience to
our young roster,'' Blazers President Bob Whitsitt said.
<p>
   During the 31-year-old Askew's eight-year career, which also
included stints with the Philadelphia 76ers, Golden State Warriors,
Sacramento Kings and Seattle SuperSonics, he averaged 7.4 points
and 2.5 rebounds in 437 games.
<p>
   Terms of the contract weren't disclosed.
<p>
   The Blazers also said Tony Brown and Jim Eyen joined the
coaching staff as assistants.
<p>

<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  It was late morning and the No Name Restaurant on Fish
Pier was deserted.
<p>
   At a table near the water, William P. Youngworth III, in
sunglasses and a Phillies cigar T-shirt, tucked into a seafood
lunch with his wife, Judith. He looked up and saw a peculiar sight:
a man on a staircase on the far side of the restaurant pointing a
video camera in his direction with its red light on.
<p>
   A strange moment, played out one day last week, but no stranger,
perhaps, than Youngworth himself, a 38-year-old antiques dealer
with an oddly tangled past and present and probably an equally
tangled future.
<p>
   Youngworth, who is on trial on theft charges, has also been the
object of intense scrutiny here since making a widely publicized
claim that he alone could lead the authorities to up to $300
million worth of masterpieces, including Rembrandts and a Vermeer,
that were stolen from the city's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
more than seven years ago.
<p>
   What Youngworth seeks in return is the $5 million reward offered
by the museum, immunity from prosecution and the early release from
prison of his karate teacher and mentor, Myles J. Connor Jr., 54,
an art thief with a violent criminal record.
<p>
   Spotting the man with the video camera, the square-faced,
forcefully built Youngworth left the table and paid him a visit. He
returned a few moments later, seemingly content with the
explanation that the man was a tourist who was taping Youngworth
because he looked famous. Mrs. Youngworth could only roll her eyes
at this.
<p>
   Both are convinced that they have been placed under intense
surveillance and otherwise hounded by the FBI since Youngworth
voiced his claim through The Boston Herald last month. In a
rambling interview that began on a Boston street corner, moved to
the No Name and continued in his car, which he said the FBI had
outfitted with monitoring devices, Youngworth said there appeared
to be little interest in having him return the paintings, which he
maintains he had no role in stealing.
<p>
   ``The feds don't want it to happen,'' he asserted in a thick
Boston accent. ``The only true thing they ever told me is that they
want to get it before me.''
<p>
   Mrs. Youngworth said, ``It's not in their interest to have an
ex-con find the paintings.'' Youngworth has done time for a variety
of offenses, including armed robbery as a youth.
<p>
   So matters are at a confusing standstill. Nobody in authority
seems to know whether Youngworth can produce the paintings, what
role, if any, he had in the theft or how Connor figures in all
this.
<p>
   What will happen, particularly after Connor's trial on the
unrelated theft charges, is a matter that perhaps only a detective
novelist could surmise.
<p>
   In the interview on Monday, Youngworth said he had to walk a
difficult line between being helpful and avoiding
self-incrimination, which was why, he said, he had to have a deal
for his freedom first. ``The moment those things go up on the wall,
I get indicted,'' he said as he maneuvered his old car through
construction zones while juggling calls on a constantly ringing
cellular phone and denouncing the FBI, which he said was
undoubtedly listening in on his calls.
<p>
   He said he and his wife had discovered and dismantled a
listening device under their bed at home and worried about the
safety of their 6-year-old son.
<p>
   But now, he insisted, ``I've gone as far as I can go.'' He said
he had gotten calls from people claiming links to Northern Ireland
who sought a role in brokering the return of the paintings, but he
pointedly declined to say whether they were connected to the Irish
Republican Army.
<p>
   ``Some windows are closing, some are opening,'' he said
enigmatically.
<p>
   Spokesmen for the FBI and the Gardner Museum said they were not
commenting on any aspect of the case. But officials have said they
were still waiting for unequivocal proof that Youngworth could
recover the stolen art, although he arranged for a Herald reporter,
Tom Mashberg, to see what appeared to be Rembrandt's missing
``Storm on the Sea of Galilee'' in an unidentified warehouse
somewhere in the Northeast last month.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Beyond that, officials say, it might be hard to justify freeing
Connor under any circumstances, given his long criminal record,
includes escapes from prison and a conviction in the 1975 killings
of two 20-year-old women who witnessed a gang murder. Connor spent
three years in prison before the conviction was overturned for a
new trial, in which he was acquitted. But he was subsequently
convicted of selling drugs, stolen antiques and art, including
three paintings from Amherst College.
<p>
   Nonetheless, negotiations with Youngworth, who ran a store
called ``Almost Antiques,'' were announced in a spirit of optimism
three weeks ago by the Gardner Museum. They are on hold pending
Youngworth's continuing trial in Norfolk County Superior Court in
Dedham on the theft charges, the resolution of which could
influence his bargaining position. On Thursday, proceedings were
adjourned until Tuesday at the prosecution's request after heated
arguments over lost police evidence and conflicting testimony.
Youngworth will not testify, his lawyer, Martin K. Leppo, said.
<p>
   If Youngworth is convicted of having a stolen van and illegal
ammunition that were found on his property in Randolph, items he
says he knew nothing about and traces to a man he identifies as a
tenant and provocateur, he could face a return to prison for 15
years as a habitual offender, having served a reformatory sentence
for armed robbery as a youth and prison time for firearms
violations and failing to appear on federal narcotics charges.

<p>
   He is facing other local charges next month. And people close to
the case said a federal grand jury was being convened to
investigate the possible roles of Youngworth and Connor in the
Gardner caper.
<p>
   Because he, like Connor, was behind bars in the early hours of
March 18, 1990, when two men in police garb talked their way into
the Gardner and made off with the 13 treasures, Youngworth said he
clearly had no role in the heist. He has yet to explain how he
could know the whereabouts of the art while being unconnected of
the robbery.
<p>
   Asked about that, he replied tersely: ``People died. Things
change. There was a change of custody.''
<p>
   The Boston Herald has reported an informer's account that an
unidentified international crime lord paid five thieves $100,000
each for the robbery, which was botched when they failed to take
requested masterworks by Titian and Botticelli. One of the crew was
said to have been tortured and murdered by underworld cronies in
1991 after boasting of his role. Another was reported to have died
since then. The authorities have not confirmed the report.
<p>
   Strikingly, by Youngworth's own account, he was a suspect in the
theft almost from the beginning. Three days after the break-in, he
said, FBI agents visited him in his prison cell in Terra Haute,
Ind., explaining, ``There's a short list and you're on it.'' But he
said he told them he had nothing to contribute.
<p>
   The case languished until May or June, he said in the interview,
when a former cellmate of Connor told the authorities he had new
information about the art theft and supplied Youngworth's name.
<p>
   Mysteriously, Youngworth went on, his property in Randolph was
raided on July 8 by FBI agents with a warrant for automatic weapons
and rocket launchers. None were found, but three inoperable antique
pistols and a marijuana butt were, and Youngworth was locked up.
<p>
   The convolutions had only begun. In jail, he said, he mentioned
to law-enforcement officers that he might be able to recover a
beeswax seal that had been stolen with a page of a Colonial charter
that had been missing from the Massachusetts State House for 13
years.
<p>
   He found the seal in his own living room, of all places, he
said, telling the ABC News program ``Nightline'' on Sept. 1, ``I
guess I'm just at a loss to explain it.'' He was released on bond
and the seal was then broken into pieces by a careless Randolph
police officer, Youngworth said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, he said, Connor's former cellmate had also talked to
Mashberg, the Herald reporter, who began a series of articles on
Youngworth.
<p>
   Youngworth said the release of Connor, a ``surrogate father,''
was ``an unbendable condition.'' He said they had been allowed two
meetings in a Rhode Island prison where their discussions were
undoubtedly monitored. But he said, ``If they could understand the
language we were talking, good luck.''

<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  The judge in Texas' lawsuit against the tobacco
industry on Friday backed off a proposed gag order that would have
barred trial participants from discussing the case with reporters.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge David Folsom said he was withdrawing the
draft order because all the parties in the case had filed briefs
opposing it.
<p>
   He said any potential prejudice from pre-trial publicity will be
dealt with by questioning and instructing the jury, which will
report for the first time Monday.
<p>
   In a case that has attracted national attention, Texas has sued
the tobacco industry to recover billions of dollars in health-care
costs associated with smoking. The trial may last several months.
<p>
   ``Should any problems involving publicity arise during the
course of trial, the court may again entertain, after reasonable
notice to the parties, an appropriate order limiting communication
with the media,'' Folsom said in a one-page order issued late
Friday.
<p>
   The judge's proposed gag order would have prohibited both sides
in the case from commenting to the media not only on Texas'
anti-tobacco lawsuit but also on other states' lawsuits against
cigarette makers and a proposed national settlement.
<p>
   Texas Attorney General Dan Morales and the tobacco defendants
both filed briefs opposing it. So did several news organizations.
<p>
   Morales' spokesman Ward Tisdale said the attorney general was
pleased with the judge's decision to drop the gag order.
<p>
   ``It will allow the public to remain informed about this
important lawsuit,'' Tisdale said.
<p>
   Jack Maroney, an attorney for Philip Morris Cos., said the
tobacco companies also were pleased.
<p>
   Folsom plans to submit written questions to potential jurors
Monday in Texarkana, which is on the Texas-Arkansas border, and
resume jury selection Oct. 6.
<p>
   Among other things, the questions will attempt to gauge
potential jurors' attitudes about tobacco and smoking, their views
of government and how much they have read or heard about lawsuits
against tobacco companies.

   St. Louis, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- St. Louis Cardinals
left-hander Rick Honeycutt retired after 21 major league seasons.
<p>
   Honeycutt, the oldest player in baseball at age 43, appeared in
just two games this season because of an elbow injury. In two
innings pitched, he allowed five hits and three earned runs.

   Honeycutt has a career record of 109-143 with 38 saves and a
3.71 earned run average with six different teams. He made his major
league debut with the Seattle Mariners in 1977 and pitched for the
Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Oakland Athletics, New York
Yankees and St. Louis.
<p>
   A member of three American League championship teams with
Oakland in 1988, 1989 and 1990, Honeycutt holds the League
Championship Series record for series appearances with seven and
games pitched at 20.
<p>
   In his last full season with St. Louis in 1996, Honeycutt was
2-1 with a 2.85 ERA in 61 games in helping the Cardinals to the

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. said
it plans to sell 20 percent of its U.S. finance subsidiary, CIT
Group Inc., to the public.
<p>
   ``We are planning to expand CIT as the center of our mergers and
acquisitions business in the U.S.,'' said an official from Dai-Ichi
Kangyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo owns 80 percent of Livingston, New Jersey-based
CIT, a lender to small and medium-sized companies. Chase Manhattan
Corp., through a subsidiary, owns the rest.
<p>
   The Japanese bank plans to use the proceeds of the sale to buy
Chase's share.
<p>
   CIT didn't give an estimate of how much will be raised by the
sale.
<p>
   Chase declined to provide any details about the price and terms
of its transaction with CIT. The U.S. bank sold a 20 percent stake
of CIT to Dai-Ichi about a year ago, said Chase spokesman John
Stefans, and at that time gave an option to the Japanese bank to
buy the rest of its shares.
<p>
   Chase acquired its stake as a result of the April 1996 merger
between the old Chase and Chemical Banking Corp. Chemical had
acquired CIT when it purchase Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1991.
<p>
   Two classes of shares will be issued, with Class A shares being
sold to the public, and Class B shares going to Dai-Ichi. Class B
shares will carry 5 votes per share.
<p>
   CIT has $20 billion in total assets and shareholder equity of
$2.2 billion. It has 89 offices in 28 U.S. states and a subsidiary
in Hong Kong.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. will arrange the
sale.

<p>
   Bogota, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The National Liberation Army,
one of Colombia's two main guerrilla groups, called on the
government to postpone municipal and gubernatorial elections
scheduled for Oct. 26 and discuss peace instead.
<p>
   The country should hold a national ``peace convention'' to find
ways ``out of the muddle we are in,'' the guerrillas said in a
statement sent to Radionet radio station.
<p>
   Interior minister Carlos Holmes called the proposal
``outrageous.'' The government would guarantee elections
nationwide, he said.
<p>
   The guerrilla group, known as ELN, didn't say what it meant by a
peace convention.
<p>
   The government in the past has refused guerrilla demands that
elections be called off. The two main rebel factions are the ELN
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
<p>
   In rural areas, rebels have threatened to kill politicians who
participate in the elections. Their threats have led to the
resignation of more than 900 candidates.
<p>
   In August, President Ernesto Samper said the government is
willing to clear the military from an area of the country for a
short time to meet with guerrillas. Two advisers of Samper met with
leftist rebels in Mexico City about the same time to discuss ending
decades of violence.
<p>
   The ELN said left-wing politicians are being ``annihilated'' and
added that the government was effectively prohibiting mass protests
by blaming them on guerrilla groups.
<p>
   Thousands of poor farmers last year demonstrated for more
government security and financial assistance. The government and
military blamed left wing groups for instigating the protests.

 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  There are more than seven million New Yorkers. Some
650,000 of them are teen-agers. That's 650,000 running the
punishing marathon from age 13 to 19 in a superheated urban
environment. Teen-agers may grow up faster in New York than
anywhere else in the country. They may be more jaded, and more
likely to see their street fashion and their language translated
into the popular culture.
<p>
   But wherever they congregate, the rules tend to remain constant.
Teen-agers like to cluster. They seek excitement and romance. They
flirt with danger. They fight a constant battle against crushing
boredom and curfews. They posture. They are embarrassed by their
parents.
<p>
   On Friday night, Sept. 19, a team of writers set out to watch
and listen in on some New York teen-agers. They headed for typical
gathering spots, from Astoria Park in Queens to Astor Place in
Manhattan to a skating and dance center in the South Bronx. Some of
the youths were rich, some poor. Some were happy to give their
names; some insisted on anonymity. Some looked at Manhattan as
their playground; some saw it as a far-off constellation of lights.
But for everyone it was, well, a Friday night. In fact, the last of
summer.
<p>
   Something was in the air. Here, snapshots from the front.
<p>
   God Amid the Backpacks
<p>
   In the moonless dark, on a grassy ridge by the Lake in Central
Park, four teen-agers sat on the ground hunched over a flickering
candle talking of love and God. Other 14- and 15-year-olds  &MD;  maybe
35 in all  &MD;  sat in similar knots, talking, singing, bumming
cigarettes. Jansport knapsacks lay strewn in every direction.
<p>
   ``We're discussing religion and blind faith and whether God
exists,'' said Alicia Vancouvering, 15, a 10th grader at Stuyvesant
High School. ``Before, we were talking about how love is the most
selfish emotion possible.'' In other words, a Friday night of
hanging out.
<p>
   The teen-agers, who are refugees from some of the city's
fanciest addresses, attend top public and private schools. After
school most any day, they go to the ridge or to the Sheep Meadow in
Central Park, light up cigarettes and fling their backpacks to the
ground as they sit between the ginkgos and the swamp white oaks.
They call one tree beside the Lake the Mind Tree.
<p>
   The secluded world is one of teen-age philosophizing, music,
gossip and romance. And of rituals: frequent food runs to
McDonald's or Gray's Papaya and treks to public phones to respond
to messages from parents left on the ubiquitous beepers that go off
constantly.
<p>
   It can also be, for some but not all, a world of teen-age vice:
40-ounce beers, marijuana (the park's drug of choice) and,
occasionally, LSD ($5 a tab at park rates). Couples sometimes
disappear into the shadows.
<p>
   It is, in today's lingo, a bunk place to be (read: cool).
<p>
   The conversation around the candle broke up when a friend
arrived with sodas and french fries from McDonald's.
``Sustenance,'' said Gino Taylor, a Collegiate School sophomore, as
Milan Dale, a classmate of Alicia, put an arm around her and began
to quote ``Romeo and Juliet,'' the 10th-grade staple.
<p>
   ``Good morrow, cousin,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Is the day so young?'' she responded.
<p>
   But minutes later, the quietude was disrupted, the sense of
youthful invincibility shattered. In another small group clustered
behind the trees, a 14-year-old girl passed out after smoking
marijuana and drinking nearly a fifth of Jim Beam.
<p>
   Her friends panicked, shouting at her, slapping her face. She
vomited. Several friends missed their curfews to stay with her
until an ambulance arrived. Later, at Roosevelt Hospital, she was
determined to be fine.
<p>
   A police officer took phone numbers and threatened to call
parents. But he didn't. ``They won't learn,'' he said. He did not
specify whether he meant the children or their parents.
<p>
    &MD; DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
<p>
   Boom Boxes on Wheels
<p>
   From the vantage point of Astoria Park, nestled along a bend of
the East River underneath the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan looks
like a string of Christmas lights, and a world away.
<p>
   The waterfront side of the park is known as the Strip in Queens,
a magnet for members of the first American-born generation of
European immigrant groups.
<p>
   John McNamara, 18, a freshman at the State University College at
Farmingdale, N.Y., hasn't missed a night for most of his teen
years. ``Even if I get married,'' he said. ``I'm living right
across from the Strip, so I can save on gas and just walk over
here.''
<p>
   Another 18-year-old offered a bit of iconography. ``At this end
of the Strip we're down with the Maltese, the Romanians, the Greeks
and the Italians,'' he said, adding that as one travels down the
Strip, the cars, the clothes and the ethnicities change.
<p>
   He is a member of the Guidos. ``It's a European thing,'' he
said. ``We've got the silver chains, silver earrings, tight shirts,
nice jeans. And the girls, the Guidettes, have bell-bottoms and
platform shoes.''
<p>
   Like the keepers of an informal toll booth, teen-agers sat
across the entrance to the Strip, occasionally walking over to lean
in car windows to greet friends. The drill: to show off the nicest
car, the best rims, the coolest neon lights under the chassis, the
best sound system. Indeed, the line of cars filing past resembled
the constantly shifting dial of a giant radio, each car blaring a
different style of music so loud it ignited every car alarm in its
path. In truth, most of the cars were basic models gussied up, but
they will have to do until the boys can save enough for their dream
cars. A Monte Carlo perhaps, or a Buick Regal.
<p>
   The Strip is where an evening on wheels begins and ends. In
between, the cars peel off for Francis Lewis Boulevard.
<p>
   ``We go to the Franny Lew to pick up girls,'' John McNamara
said. ``You just keep driving in circles. You just do laps.''
<p>
   Be warned: this is no activity for the uninitiated, and woe
betide the Franny Lew novice who, say, activates a turn signal to
make a turn, not knowing the rigid rules of a highly complex
ritual.
<p>
   High beam: Just checking you out.
<p>
   Turn signal: Pull over. Let's talk.
<p>
    &MD; SAMANTHA HENRY
<p>
   Big Brother
<p>
   Judd Kessler, a 15-year-old sophomore at Hunter College High
School who lives on West 18th Street, banked the cue ball off the
pool table's side wall to ricochet off the 5 ball. As it passed its
intended pocket, he looked deflated. His cousin, Zach Osofsky, 16,
a high school senior from Rockland County, patted him on the back.
``Nice try.''
<p>
   The two boys wrapped it up early at Chelsea Billiards on West
21st Street so they could duck into Barnes &AMP; Noble for a few
minutes before making their 11 p.m. curfew. ``I have to get home
soon to make sure my younger brother gets in all right,'' Judd
said. ``He went to his first concert tonight, and he's only 11. I
didn't get to go to my first concert until I was 12.''
<p>
   Actually, Judd was breaking one rule. No one under 16 is allowed
in the pool hall.
<p>
   What does he usually do on Friday nights? He scrunched up his
face with disapproval. He recently broke up with his girlfriend.
``She liked to go to Starbucks and drink hot chocolate with, like,
mocha and stuff in it.'' He prefers the movies, and occasionally
hears of a party. ``I don't get invited to too many, though.''
<p>

<p>
   In Search of a Rave
<p>
   There was a rumor circling Washington Square Park of a rave in a
loft somewhere, an all-night ``outlaw'' party of throbbing music
and drugs. So every half-hour or so somebody had to make the trip
over to a broken pay phone that works without quarters to call the
secret rave info line. But to no avail.

   ``If there are outlaws to go to, I will not sleep until I get
home on Monday night,'' said a 17-year-old dropout from Hunter
College High School, who hangs out near the park fountain almost
every weekend night with 20 or so other teen-agers. ``When you do
glass, you don't want to eat or sleep,'' he said, referring to the
downtown drug of the moment  &MD;  a potent form of crystal
methamphetamine snorted or smoked. ``You just want to keep moving,
and drink water.'' His mother, he said, is oblivious.
<p>
   A 15-year-old girl who attends City-as-School has an agreement:
a curfew only when she's not going to a rave. ``My mother would
rather have me stay out all night and come home in the daylight
than leave a party by myself and come home in the dark,'' she
explained.
<p>
   The drugs are supplied by the group's resident teen-age dealers
known by their club names, Danny Warlock and Yvie.
<p>
   ``I hate glass because I love it so much and it makes me lose 15
pounds in eight days,'' said Yvie, a rail-thin 17-year-old dropout
from Dewey High School in Brooklyn, who boasts of making $1,000 a
night selling drugs but has higher ambitions.
<p>
   ``Someday I'd like to get it together and be a pharmacist,'' she
said.
<p>
   Danny Warlock has even bigger dreams. ``I want to save enough
money selling drugs so I can stop selling drugs and play the stock
market,'' he said. He admitted that in the meantime, he steals and
is homeless and is thinking of checking into a shelter.
<p>
   At midnight the police closed the park and the ravers moved to a
sidewalk.
<p>
   At 1 a.m. came the final word from the phone booth: the rave had
been canceled. The children with homes went to them. The rest were
on their own.  &MD; SARI BOTTON
<p>
   Chauffeur Driven
<p>
   Sprawled on the floor of their friend Marissa Bregman's
pink-and-white Laura Ashley bedroom on Park Avenue, Carlton DeWoody
and Nick Raynes shared their world view.
<p>
   ``You know, all three us are very well off,'' said Carlton, 16,
a junior at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx. ``But no one has
a clue  &MD;  that's why we dress like this. You know, you don't want to
be known for who your family is, but who you are.''
<p>
   On this night, he was wearing JNCO wide-legged pants four sizes
too big, and in a challenge to stretch it out the entire night, he
was carrying $10 in his pocket. (Never mind that his family, as
well as Nick's, is heavily into real estate, and that Marissa's
father is the movie producer Martin Bregman.)
<p>
   Longtime best friends, the boys dawdled while Marissa, 14,
transformed herself into a sartorial simulation of her idol,
Courtney Love, for the night's concert by the ska reggae band Reel
Big Fish.
<p>
   Music, they proclaimed, is their life. ``We're in a band
together,'' said Nick, all about him photographs of musicians
meticulously clipped from magazines.
<p>
   ``We are all  &UR; way &LR;  into music,'' Marissa, a Spence School ninth
grader, called from the bathroom. Dressed, she pulled out her
mini-amplifier as Carlton strummed the electric guitar before
switching to the piano.
<p>
   ``He really sounds like Jimi Hendrix,'' said Nick, 13, before
Marissa cut in. ``Dude, we have to get tickets to Spring Hill Jack.
Dude, dude, dude, come on, don't forget.''
<p>
   The three, she explained, spend most of their free nights going
to clubs and following bands. ``The point is, you must go out all
the time,'' said Marissa, who claimed that she gets herself
backstage at every concert. ``If you want to make it in the music
business, you have to be out there. I'll do whatever it takes.''
<p>
   ``Not drugs, not sex,'' she added. ``We're not into that.''
<p>
   A comforting comment to a parent no doubt, but Marissa's mother,
Cornelia Bregman, takes no chances. When the pals climb into the
chauffeur-driven Land Cruiser for the ride to the concert, Mrs.
Bregman, as usual, climbs in, too, to chaperone. Until they manage
to ditch her.

   Mosh-Pit Scrum
<p>
   Missy Prainito, 16, and five classmates from the Mary Louis
Academy, a Roman Catholic high school in Queens, were pasting
bright orange ``as advertised'' canned-goods stickers all over
their bell bottoms. Little tufts of hair rubber-banded into tiny
pigtails stuck out from their heads in six or seven directions, and
glitter covered their arms and foreheads. They found the overall
look a delicious contrast to the baby-blue plaid skirts they would
be wearing again in math class on Monday morning.
<p>
   As Reel Big Fish hit the Irving Plaza stage and began pounding
out brittle guitar chords and horn blasts, parents accompanying
younger patrons seemed distinctly out of place.
<p>
   ``Man, I'm glad our parents trust us,'' said Serena Alterman,
16, a member of the Mary Louis Academy contingent. (After all, if
you're under 21, you don't get one of those special bracelets that
tips off the bartender to serve you alcohol.)
<p>
   None of the parents, to be sure, got anywhere near the mosh pit,
where amid a sweaty blur of arms, legs and elbows, the pushing,
shoving and sheer pressing occasionally got out of hand. One small,
blue-eyed girl wearing Doc Martens and a ``Star Wars'' T-shirt
fainted away and was carried from the scrum but revived with a
splash of water. By the finale, people were jumping up and down
with such force the very floor was bouncing.
<p>
   ``I've got to get home,'' Missy said, as her group headed to the
subway for the long ride back to Queens. Curfew? ``No,'' she said,
sweat glistening on her forehead. ``Because even my underwear is
soaked.''

<p>
   Carlos Santiago was decked out in signature Skate Key regalia:
baggy jeans, sneakers, North Face backpack. He also had the
appropriately shaved head with a ponytail sticking out the back of
his baseball cap.
<p>
   In a neighborhood sometimes likened to a war zone, the Key, at
East 139th Street in the South Bronx, is something of a social
oasis for teen-agers like Carlos, 16.
<p>
   ``There's not a lot of ruckus,'' he said. You don't have to
worry about anything happening. Everybody is safe.''
<p>
   For the Key, a dance and in-line-skating center that draws close
to 2,000 teen-agers on weekends and was filled to capacity as usual
this night, security is as important as the strobe lights, the
sternum-crushing sound system and the two crews of D.J.'s
<p>
   There are metal detectors at the front turnstile. Private guards
frisk patrons for weapons or beer, and lest rival members of the
Crips and the Bloods get sideways of one another, they are required
to check their colors  &MD;  blue or red bandannas  &MD;  at the door. Almost
every night that the club is open, a police van half filled with
officers is parked directly across the street from the entrance.
<p>
   ``We just needed a place to get away from the problems in our
lives  &MD;  domestic problems, life on the streets, whatever,'' said a
14-year-old girl who identified herself as Muc. ``It's the best
place we've got right now.''
<p>

<p>
   The Astor Rats?
<p>
   There was only a single police officer in sight at Lafayette
Street and Astor Place in the East Village, but as she patrolled
the perimeter of the giant metal cube that dominates the
intersection she kept a wary eye on nine teen-age boys across the
street.
<p>
   They are the self-styled Astor Rats, a group of skateboarders
who are the targets of a recent police crackdown to keep them and
their kind from swarming around the cube, long the skateboarding
epicenter of Manhattan.
<p>
   Friday night had turned to Saturday morning, and at 1 a.m. it
had been three hours since they had been kicked out of Union
Square. For the moment they had no place else to go, a small but
brave version of an elusive American dream, a diverse group of
black, white and Japanese teen-agers for whom skateboarding has
been a bridge across the cultures.
<p>
   ``I've met kids from all over the world,'' said Freddie Cotto,
18, a college freshman majoring in computer graphics. ``It's a good
way to get to know people. You see someone doing a cool trick and
you say, `How did you do that?' and then you've made a new
friend.''
<p>
   Marc Rybalchenko, a 16-year-old studying for his General
Educational Development certificate, said that skateboarding is
misunderstood.
<p>
   ``I went through a drinking phase,'' he said. ``Now, skating
gets me out of that most of the time. It's given me a new
perspective on life.''
<p>
   As they sat on their boards, gently rocking back and forth, they
smoked and talked about parties and girls, they were stymied but
not defeated.
<p>
   The teen-age urge to hang out is a powerful one, and at 2 a.m.
they knew they would be on their way uptown, aware that the guards
who watch over their favorite building plazas had dozed off.
<p>
   ``In midtown alone there are 10 to 12 buildings that have smooth
marble,'' said Justin Taylor, 19, a New York University sophomore.
``At the Paine Webber building they chase you away with guard dogs
after a few minutes, but then we go somewhere else.
<p>
   ``People are always finding new places.''

<p>
   Washington, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Federal authorities charged
researchers at a California testing firm with falsifying results of
clinical studies, throwing into doubt research used to support the
safety and effectiveness of a number of drugs.
<p>
   Because of the lab's actions, federal officials said, at least
seven major companies will have to review studies to make sure
phony testing procedures didn't contaminate the process by which
their drugs won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. If
those reviews raise doubts about the safety or effectiveness of any
of the drugs, the FDA could remove them from the market.
<p>
   The California testing lab, American Pharmaceutical Research
Inc., conducted clinical tests for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.,
SmithKline Beecham Plc, Bayer AG, Roche Holding AG, Pfizer Inc.,
Glaxo Wellcome Plc, Akzo Nobel NV and other major drug companies,
according to plea agreements released by federal prosecutors.
<p>
   FDA spokesman Don McLearn said the FDA is in the process of
reviewing studies with data from American Pharmaceutical Research
to see how they might have affected the approval process.
<p>
   ``You take out any data that they were connected with and you go
through and figure out, absent that data, does that have an effect
on the approvability of the drug?'' McLearn said. He added, though,
that the FDA's requirement that most studies have many different
centers likely will diminish the impact of any fraudulent data
contained in the studies.
<p>
   ``We generally ask for multi-center studies so when you have a
bad apple like this, it doesn't spoil the whole crop,'' he said.
<p>
   Los Angeles U.S. Attorney Nora Manella's office filed charges
today against Dr. Robert A. Fiddes, 52, the owner and principal
researcher at American Pharmaceutical Research, which formerly was
known as Southern California Research Inc. Also charged were two
company study coordinators, Laverne Charpentier, 50, and Delfina
Hernandez, 34. The three will plead guilty to charges of filing
false statements with the government as part of an agreement with
prosecutors, the government said. They each could face a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, authorities
said. Officials at the testing company's Whittier, California,
offices had no comment.
<p>
   The company conducted studies of products used in connection
with birth control, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, sinusitis,
vaginitis, and menopause, among other things.
<p>
   Glaxo spokeswoman Ramona Jones said the study in question for
the company's asthma drug, salmeterol, was a postmarketing study
and shouldn't have any impact on the drug's continuing
availability. ``We looked at the results without the data from this
group and it makes no difference to the results,'' she said.
<p>
   ``Most trials are designed to be large enough to get a cross
section of the country and a cross section of people,'' Jones
added. ``If there are errors by one investigator, it won't make
that big of a difference in most trials.''
<p>
   A spokesman for Akzo Nobel's Organon division, Patrick Osinski,
said the company is still reviewing the data on its birth control
drug, Triphasic. ``It was a small center in a multi-center study,''
Osinski said. ``We're evaluating what the outcome's going to be.''
<p>
   A spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said the company analyzed
data for its antibiotic Zagam and ``we are confident that this
investigator had no impact on the results of our trials.''
<p>
   Officials from many of the companies couldn't be reached for
comment this evening.
<p>
   The government alleged that the researchers used subjects who
didn't meet the medical criteria for some studies, and falsified
test results in others.
<p>
   In one case, the government charged, the researchers made it
appear that more than 25 patients participated in a study of a drug
to treat vaginal yeast infections. In fact, the U.S. charged, only
one patient was involved.
<p>
   Among the federal allegations were charges that the testing lab:
<p>
   -- Created false documentation for subjects used in a test of
Organon's Triphasic birth control pill.
<p>
   -- Ran water instead of urine over a flow meter designed to
determine whether patients met the clinical requirements for tests
of two SmithKline Beecham products, known as Alpha
Blocker/SB16469-S and Episteride.
<p>
   -- Falsified test results about whether some patients met the
criteria to participate in a study of a SmithKline Beecham drug,
Eprosartan.
<p>
   -- Destroyed X-rays that would have shown that some participants
in a study of a PPD/Zambon drug known as PHZ-136 did not have
osteoarthritis in their knee -- a prerequisite for participation in
the study.
<p>
   -- Created phony records for more than two dozen non-existent
patients in a study of Bayer's infection-fighting drug
clotrimazole. The study actually involved only one person.
<p>
   -- Created documents making it falsely appear that Charpentier's
and Hernandez's daughters participated in a study of Glaxo's asthma
drug, salmeterol.
<p>
   -- Purchased microorganisms from an outside lab to cover up the
fact that some patients who participated in a study of Pfizer's
antibiotic azithromycin didn't have those organisms present in
their ears -- a requirement for the study.
<p>
   -- Listed non-existent patients in a study of Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer's Dilacor hypertension drug.
<p>
   -- Used treadmill results from a test on Charpentier's husband,
substituting them for results from some other people so they could
qualify for a test of Roche's mibefradil. The drug, sold under the
brand name Posicor, was recently approved for hypertension.
<p>
   -- Prescribed for some patients a medication that was not
supposed to be taken by participants in a study of Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer's Combi-Patch, and altered blood samples on some other
participants. The Combi-Patch, a combination hormone replacement
therapy patch, isn't yet on the market.
<p>
   -- Enrolled participants in a study of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's
Zagam antibiotic without giving them a test required for
participation in the study.
<p>
   Under the plea agreement, American Pharmaceutical Research
agreed to pay $270,268 to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer; $269,981 to
SmithKline Beecham; $139,000 to Pfizer; $50,320 to
Pharmaco-Organon; $50,000 to Roche; $45,918 to PPD-Zambon; $29,279
for CTMS/Glaxo; and $18,000 to Bayer.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia  &MD;  An Indonesian Airbus A-300 that left
Jakarta carrying 234 people crashed Friday as it approached an
airport on the neighboring island of Sumatra, part of a vast region
where thick smoke from forest fires has cut visibility.
<p>
   Witnesses to the crash near Medan in northern Sumatra, 900 miles
northwest of Jakarta, said the aircraft exploded as it crashed, and
officials said they feared that no one aboard had survived. Rescue
workers reported that they had recovered 121 bodies.
<p>
   Officials of the Indonesian national carrier, Garuda Airlines,
said 11 foreigners were aboard flight 152, including two Americans.
<p>
   There was no official word on the cause of the crash, but a
number of airports in Southeast Asia have been closed by the thick
blanket of smoke caused by hundreds of forest fires burning in
Indonesia.
<p>
   ``The weather conditions were O.K. for landing, but there was
smoke and haze around Medan at the time,'' Communications Minister
Haryanto Danutirto said.
<p>
   Supandi, the president of Garuda, said at a news conference here
that visibility was about one-third of a mile at the time of the
crash at 1:55 p.m.. The airline canceled several flights into Medan
after the crash, but airport officials said other carriers
continued to use the airport.
<p>
   Witnesses said the plane was flying low in the smoky haze in a
hilly area 20 miles from the Medan airport when it hit a tree and
crashed into a ravine, shattering into pieces.
<p>
   Thick smoke prevented rescue helicopters from flying to the
crash site, the witnesses said.
<p>
   Aviation experts said an investigation would be needed to
determine the cause of the crash. But they said the haze could have
been a factor.
<p>
   ``The people investigating this accident will certainly look at
that among the other issues they will look at,'' said David Venz, a
spokesman for Airbus Industrie, which manufactures the plane.
<p>
   The Airbus A-300 is equipped with radar and guidance systems
that allow it to land at night or in other conditions of poor
visibility, but airport officials would not say whether they were
in use at the time of the crash. Nor was it immediately known
whether the airport in Medan, the main city in northern Sumatra,
was equipped with a simple beacon or the more advanced glide-slope
indicator that guides an incoming plane to the runway.
<p>
   An accumulation of ash has been known to clog the engines of
aircraft flying close to volcanic eruptions, but it was not clear
whether ash from the forest fires could have been aloft in
sufficient concentrations to have been a factor here.
<p>
   Pilot error was also a possibility, an airline expert said,
either related to the smoke or not. A plane still 20 miles from an
airport would normally be several thousand feet in the air, and the
witness accounts made no mention of a sudden plunge the might
indicate mechanical failure. It was also unclear from the witnesses
whether the explosion was seen just before or just after the plane
hit the ground.
<p>
   Experts on airline safety have raised questions about the
training and performance of Garuda personnel, and at one point the
airline was banned from flying to airports in the United States.
The ban was appealed and never went into effect.
<p>
   Since 1982, Garuda has had six major crashes in which the plane
was a total wreck. Although three of those crashes ended without
fatality, the total death toll in the other three was 56.
<p>
   ``They haven't had a lot of fatalities, but they've trashed a
lot of planes,'' said Darryl Jenkins, a professor of airline
economics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
``They are one of the most poorly run airlines in the world.''
<p>
   If the crash did result from the smoke, it adds urgency to an
unfolding disaster. The pungent haze is spreading northward from
Indonesia through Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and
Thailand, mingling with the smog of cities, darkening beach
resorts, hampering agriculture and sending tens of thousands of
people to hospitals with respiratory ailments.
<p>
   Airports are closing, shipping lanes are being disrupted, and
fishing boats are being forced to stay ashore.
<p>
   A milky gloom is settling over some cities in the region, and
people are covering their faces with surgical masks and towels when
they venture out.
<p>
   ``The sky in Southeast Asia has turned yellow, and people are
dying,'' said Claude Martin, director general of the World Wide
Fund for Nature in a statement released in Geneva. ``What we are
witnessing is not just an environmental disaster but a tremendous
health problem being imposed on millions.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Most of the smoke is coming from fires on the islands of Sumatra
and Borneo. Many of the fires have been deliberately set as a cheap
though illegal way of clearing land.
<p>
   Much of the land is being cleared for palm-oil plantations as
prices for the commodity rise. Slash-and-burn farmers are also
setting fires, as they traditionally do during the dry season that
begins in June.
<p>
   The cyclical reappearance of ``El Nino,'' a warming of
surface-water temperatures in the South Pacific, is disrupting
weather patterns over much of the globe this year, and in Southeast
Asia it has delayed the onset of the autumn monsoon rains that
usually douse the fires. Officials here said the prolonged dry
season was also causing areas that have been stripped of their
forest cover to burst into flame.
<p>
   The hot, dry weather is causing a drought that has reportedly
taken more than 200 lives on the island of New Guinea, which is
shared by Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
   Wildlife is also being threatened. The president of the
International Worldwide Fund for Nature, Syed Babar Ali, who is
visiting here, called the fires ``an international catastrophe.''
<p>
   As the haze thickens over the nations of Southeast Asia,
Indonesia has declared a state of emergency and issued an official
apology to its neighbors.
<p>
   Anger is growing throughout the region. In Malaysia,
demonstrators this week demanded action from their government and
asked why officials had not foreseen the problem. In Thailand, The
Bangkok Post said in an editorial Friday: ``Good neighbors don't
hurt others. Unless Indonesia stops the pollution, it cannot be
considered a good neighbor.''
<p>
   Malaysia, Thailand and other nations have sent firefighters to
try to help quell the blazes. But the fires are huge and
widespread, and even when they have been doused, officials said,
the areas will continue to smoke for many weeks.

<p>
   ROME  &MD;  Two earthquakes hit central Italy with a one-two punch
Friday, killing at least 11 people and sending parts of the vaulted
inner roof of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi crashing to the
ground, damaging the 13th-century frescoes on its walls and
ceiling.
<p>
   The second earthquake, at 11:42 a.m, which registered 5.7 on the
Richter scale and sent shivers up and down the peninsula, caused
the damage to the basilica in Assisi, a hilltop town in Umbria and
one of the most visited of Italy's many Roman Catholic shrines.
<p>
   The basilica, many art historians say, is where Italian painting
was born. With works by Cimabue, Giotto, Pietro Lorenzetti and
Simone Martini, it contains the most important and extensive early
Renaissance decorative cycles in Italy outside the Sistine Chapel.
<p>
   Two Franciscan friars and two surveyors from the culture
ministry who were in the basilica assessing damage from the earlier
earthquake were killed by the falling rubble, which piled up nearly
10 feet high.
<p>
   The first earthquake, which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale,
struck at 2:33 a.m., causing extensive damage and dozens of
injuries in the villages and hamlets strung along the hills of the
rugged Apennines. Among its victims were an elderly couple in the
tiny community of Collecurti who were killed in their beds.
<p>
   The two quakes were the most serious to hit Italy since the
devastating earthquake of 1980, which registered 6.8 on the Richter
scale and killed 2,570 people in the region east of Naples.
<p>
   The first quake, centered in the Marches, east of Umbria, had
already caused damage in Assisi, a town of 5,000. About 20 people,
including journalists, town officials, cultural experts and
Franciscans, were inspecting the upper basilica when a new tremor
struck, and parts of the ceiling came crashing down around them,
killing four people.
<p>
   ``We were examining the damage when we felt a bang,'' said
Constantino Centroni, superintendent for cultural heritage for
Umbria. ``I looked up and saw that the vault was falling on us. I
had enough time to jump to the safety of the walls, and then
everything was covered with dust and you couldn't see. I could hear
the cries of other people coming from the nave, asking for help.''
<p>
   According to one Franciscan, interviewed on television, the two
friars who were killed, one 25 and the other 48, had been near the
main altar when they tried to run for cover.
<p>
   ``Every death is horrific,'' he said, ``and I am devastated by
the loss of our two brothers. But there were 20 people in that
church, so we have to give thanks that more weren't killed.''
<p>
   Though local officials were criticized for having issued
reassuring reports this morning after the first earthquake, reports
that gave the inspection team confidence to enter the basilica,
Centroni said he had gone inside without giving thought to his
personal safety. ``If I could, by personal intervention, limit the
damages to the Giotto, I would have run any risk,'' he said.
<p>
   The details of the damage are still fragmentary, as workers sort
through the rubble.
<p>
   According to witnesses and a film taken by a local fire brigade,
two sections of the ceiling collapsed. One was over the bay of the
basilica nearest to the entrance, and was decorated with portraits
of Doctors of the Latin Church attributed to Cimabue, the
13th-century master whose work bridged the Byzantine period and the
new Tuscan school. The second was over the altar, and was decorated
with Cimabue frescoes of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
<p>
   ``There's your Cimabue,'' Centroni said in a television
interview, holding a piece of crumbled fresco.
<p>
   The walls of the nave, decorated with 28 frescoes long
attributed to Giotto, the revolutionary Italian painter who served
as an example for the later masters of the Italian Renaissance,
were apparently not damaged, Centroni said. Some art scholars
dispute the attribution of the frescoes, which depict the life of
St. Francis, the medieval saint beloved for his generosity and
gentle manner. But whoever did them is unquestionably the father of
Italian Renaissance painting.
<p>
   The lower church, with its many chapels rich in artistic
treasures, was reportedly untouched by the quake. But other
churches and monuments in the region were damaged, including the
13th-century church of Santa Chiara, the cathedral of San Rufino,
which dates to the 12th century, and the apostolic and papal
palaces, all of which contain signifant works of art.
<p>
   In Foligno, the bell tower above the cathedral was damaged;
there were also reports of damage at the cathedral at Fabriano and
on the carved facade of the cathedral at Orvieto.
<p>
   The second earthquake  &MD;  reported by one seismic expert to have
been two separate shocks in rapid succession  &MD;  was felt as far as
away as Rome, 80 miles to the south, and Venice, 150 miles to the
north. An iron lamp in the Senate in Rome crashed to the ground
during the tremor, which could be felt throughout the capital.
<p>
   Italy's cultural heritage has suffered a series of catastrophes
in the last few years: fires that ripped through La Fenice, the
18th-century opera house in Venice, and the Baroque chapel that
housed the Shroud of Turin, and the collapse of a Baroque cathedral
in Noto, Sicily.
<p>
   Late Friday night, Prime Minister Romano Prodi arrived for an
inspection tour. Speaking in Foligno, 10 miles southeast of Assisi,
he said the government was setting aside an initial emergency fund
of about $30 million.
<p>
   Some roads were closed, telephone service was interrupted in
some areas, and schools, hospitals and offices were evacuated;
9,000 beds in tent cities and campers were made available for those
forced out of their homes.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  &MD;  After seven days of presenting evidence
linking Edward S. O'Brien to the stabbing death of his neighbor
Janet Downing, the prosecution rested its case against the teenager
Friday, leaving the jury with a final image of the 42-year-old
murder victim's mutilated body.
<p>
   District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly opened his argument last week
by having a Somerville store clerk testify that O'Brien showed him
a knife the night before Downing was killed, and the prosecutor
ended his argument Friday with the testimony of Suffolk County
Medical Examiner Leonard Atkins, who detailed Downing's 98 wounds.
<p>
   In excruciating specifics that some of Downing's relatives and
friends chose not to endure, Atkins described 66 stab wounds and 32
slices, which the medical examiner called ``incise'' wounds, on
Downing's body.
<p>
   Reilly, who established for the jury earlier in the week that
Downing fought for her life in several rooms of her Somerville home
the night of July 23, 1995, Friday intended to show the jury that
Downing was a victim of ``overkill.'' The phrase is used by
forensic experts to describe a victim who has been wounded in a way
that indicates the attacker spent time mutilating the body. 
<p>
   The medical examiner testified Friday that Downing received only
two fatal stab wounds  &MD;  one to her liver, and the other to her
lung. Atkins described 22 thread-thin lines, apparently made with
the tip of a knife, that were made across Downing's neck.
<p>
   The term ``overkill'' was used often during pretrial motions to
determine whether O'Brien, if convicted of the crime, could be
rehabilitated in the juvenile system. Now the teenager faces a
possible life sentence in adult court.
<p>
   Defense attorney Robert A. George, who told the jury in his
opening statements that the prosecution and defense agree that
Downing died in a horrific fashion, objected several times to
Friday's testimony. In response, Judge James D. McDaniel Jr.
cautioned jurors, instructing them not to let the autopsy
photographs overwhelm them.
<p>
   ``You are not to be influenced, in any way, by any pity or
sympathy, that the gruesomeness of the photographs may indicate to
you. Sympathy, prejudices, or empathy have nothing to do with the
case,'' McDaniel told the jurors.
<p>
   The medical examiner told the jury that Downing, who stood 5
foot 3 inches tall and weighed 114 pounds, had ``defensive''
wounds, showing she had raised her arms in front of her body to
fend off her attacker.
<p>
   The prosecution has not produced a murder weapon, and Friday the
defense directed the jury's attention to the piece of metal  &MD; 
described in court as the hilt of a knife  &MD;  discovered on the
stairs leading to Downing's second floor.
<p>
   George was able to have a prosecution witness, Jennifer
Reynolds, who conducted tests on the crime scene evidence at the
Maryland-based Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory, testify that a
trace of DNA on the piece of metal could not be identified as
Downing's or O'Brien's.
<p>
   George has attempted in almost every cross-examination to point
out shortcomings in the prosecution's physical evidence, and the
way some items of evidence could have been mishandled in transit.
<p>
   The defense expects to take about half the time the prosecution
did to present its case, and Friday George said it was still a
``toss-up'' as to whether his client will take the witness stand.
O'Brien denies any involvement in the killing of Downing, a mother
of four, including a boy who was O'Brien's closest friend.
<p>
   George called his first three witnesses to the stand Friday in
an attempt to establish in jurors' minds that those who knew
O'Brien in his Prospect Hill neighborhood never considered him
dangerous, and that he was seen outside his home at about 8:30 p.m.
the night Downing was killed.
<p>
   Downing, who lived just across the street from O'Brien, was
discovered dead just before 10 p.m. The defense hopes to persuade
the jury that O'Brien did not have time to kill her.
<p>
   The trial resumes Monday, and is expected to end next week.

<p>
   JERUSALEM  &MD;  It started out as a routine night of Israeli Army
patrols in the West Bank's Palestinian villages.
<p>
   Dave, a youngster from Boston when he immigrated to Israel in
the mid-1970s and joined the army, was moving through the darkness
clutching a machine gun. Sammy was a Palestinian youth asleep in
his family's home when Dave's unit burst through the front door.
<p>
   They were both scared.
<p>
   It was 1992, the tail end of the intifada, or Palestinian
uprising. Sammy's family was pleading with the soldiers that they
were searching the wrong home. The soldiers demanded to see
identity cards. As it turned out, the Israeli unit was in the wrong
home, and in the wrong village. The soldiers mumbled an apology and
began to walk out. But the Palestinian family offered them coffee;
most of the soldiers refused and left.
<p>
   Dave stayed. He swung his machine gun over his back, sat down at
a Formica-topped table, and sipped the strong, sweet brew from a
tiny cup.
<p>
   That was the beginning of a friendship between David Silverman,
41, who moved to Israel in 1974, and Samir ``Sammy'' Khalil, 21,
who was born into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and raised in a
small West Bank village. How they came to know each other over the
next five years, to work together in a Jerusalem hair salon, and to
understand each other is a story of hope within the current despair
over the peace process.
<p>
   Dave says he was ashamed to have invaded the Khalil home five
years ago; he didn't want to add to the insult by turning down the
family's hospitality. Sammy, who was 16 at the time, remembers
thinking the soldier in full combat gear sitting at his family's
table sipping coffee had ``an interesting face, a kind face, like
he didn't want to be holding a gun.''
<p>
   ``We felt bad for him,'' says Sammy. ``You could tell he didn't
like where he was.''
<p>
   Dave moved on after the coffee into one more night of patrols,
his face disappearing into the darkness.
<p>
   Two years later, Sammy saw that face again when he was working
with his brother serving coffee in an office building in downtown
Jerusalem. Dave walked in from the hair salon he owned around the
corner.
<p>
   ``I know you,'' Sammy said.
<p>
   ``No you don't,'' replied Dave.
<p>
   ``Yes, you broke into our home. We served you coffee,'' Sammy
insisted.
<p>
   The two of them sat down over another cup of coffee, and then it
became a ritual. Almost every day, they would talk.
<p>
   Dave got to know Sammy  &MD;  learning how he climbed rocky hillsides
at dawn every morning to evade Israeli checkpoints, how frustrated
he felt at not being able to get a job he wanted, and how he feared
never saving enough money to get married.
<p>
   Sammy got to know Dave  &MD;  learning how he emigrated because he
was getting in too much trouble at home as a teenager, and how he
came to love the Jewish state and feel inextricably tied to its
history. He learned about Dave's daily fears for his wife and two
young children because of the terrorist bombings that shattered any
sense of security for Israelis.
<p>
     Dave, who hails from a family of eight children, is now a
self-avowed ``far right'' Israeli who fought in the 1982 war in
Lebanon and who still believes security has to come first for peace
to take hold. He makes no apologies for the current hard-line
government, but he also is adamant that the only true bridge to
peace will be built through personal friendships.
<p>
   ``The future of peace is one on one,'' he says. ``We'll never
have peace if we leave it up to the politicians.''
<p>
   Dave eventually hired Sammy at his hair salon on Ben Yehuda
Street. He could see his friend was an excellent worker: honest,
smart, resourceful. He could see how he worked with his hands, and
asked him if he would be interested in learning to cut hair. Now
Sammy is Dave's apprentice, but because of a restriction on work
permits, Dave can't legally employ him.
<p>
   On Sept. 4, Sammy and Dave were in the hair salon on Ben Yehuda
Street when the triple-suicide bombing tore through the shopping
promenade.
<p>
   Dave, who had served as an army medic, told Sammy to watch the
store and ran through the blood and broken glass to try to help
victims. As emergency medical teams loaded the wounded into
ambulances, he remembered that Sammy was probably in danger of
being arrested since he did not have a work permit, and Israeli
police were likely to detain every Palestinian in the area. Dave
also knew that, at times like this, groups of Israelis have
sometimes turned on Palestinians.
<p>
   When he returned to the shop, the two men looked at each other
and tears welled in their eyes. They knew this bombing, even more
than the others, would further dash their hopes of working
together.
<p>
   ``This one was just too close,'' says Dave. He feared for his
family and friends, and, as it turned out, a customer's son was
severely injured in the blast. The aftermath of the bombing has
also badly hurt his business.
<p>
   Sammy knew the Israeli government would clamp down, closing
Palestinian villages and further delaying the issuance of work
permits. ``Every time it happens,'' says Sammy, ``it pushes all of
our dreams further away.''

 &UR; LOTT ATTACKS CLINTON AS CAMPAIGN FINANCE DEBATE BEGINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Senate majority leader Trent Lott openly mocked
President Clinton Friday for attending a high-priced fund-raiser
the same day the Senate began debating contentious legislation
sought by the president to rewrite campaign finance laws.
<p>
   Clinton had threatened to keep Congress in session if lawmakers
did not consider a campaign finance reform measure this fall, a
threat that did not go over well with Lott. Lott unexpectedly
brought the bill to the floor for debate Friday, though he
expressed skepticism that it would ever pass.
<p>
   Moreover, Lott noted that Clinton was attending a Democratic
fund-raiser in Houston Friday that was expected to raise $600,000,
``exactly the kind of money he says we ought to stop.''
<p>
   ``What is he saying here? `Oh, please stop me from doing it
again,''' Lott said sarcastically, questioning the president's
desire to sign a bill into law. Republicans, however, are still
raising campaign money, too.
<p>
   All 45 Senate Democrats  &MD;  and four Republicans  &MD;  have said they
will vote for the measure sponsored by Senators John McCain, an
Arizona Republican, and Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. The
bill would ban unlimited ``soft money'' contributions to political
parties, limit the money candidates receive from the parties and
from advocacy groups, and require expanded disclosure of campaign
contributions and expenditures.
<p>
   ``The American people aren't dumb,'' said Senate minority leader
Tom Daschle. ``They know the system is broken. They know we now
have an opportunity to fix it. But they don't think we will. If we
squander this opportunity, it won't go unnoticed.''
<p>
   Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, oppose
limits on campaign spending. They say these restrictions are
unconstitutional and would limit candidates' exercise of free
speech by controlling their ability to communicate with voters.
They also say they want to restrict union contributions to
politicians, which generally tend to go to Democrats.
<p>
   ``To me we are debating ways in which government power will be
marshaled to control legitimate speech,'' said Senator Robert F.
Bennett, a Utah Republican, worrying that the Senate would ``do
violence to the Constitution and freedom of speech.''
<p>
   McConnell called the bill and its provisions ``truly an
Orwellian solution to a nonexistent problem.'' And he disagreed
with the bill's sponsors, who contend too much money is spent on
campaigns. ``This is the way many Americans participate in the
political process, by contributing money to political campaigns.''
<p>
   Against the backdrop of this debate, the Justice Department was
continuing its investigation into whether President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore violated the law by soliciting campaign
donations from the White House. And a federal grand jury was
investigating a deal involving a think tank run by former
Republican Party chairman Haley Barbour that was partly financed by
foreign funds.
<p>
   In Congress, advocates of campaign finance reform say they
believe they have the momentum to spur the legislation through both
chambers and to the president's desk. But history says otherwise.
In the past, each party has taken turns killing campaign finance
reform bills, complaining the measures favored the other party's
ability to raise money.
<p>
   No votes on the measure are expected before early October, and
Lott said ``I have my doubts'' anything will emerge from the
protracted debate. President Clinton warned, ``There will be a lot
of efforts to make it look like we're going to do something and
nothing will happen'' unless voters demand action.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday that the House would
not pass the McCain-Feingold bill, as it is known. And McConnell
vowed Friday, ``We're going to kill it, and we're going to kill it
proudly.''
<p>
   In the Senate, supporters of the legislation do not have the
votes to stop a likely filibuster. They are 11 votes short of the
60 necessary to stop debate and proceed with a vote on the bill.
<p>
   Still, the House co-sponsors of a similar measure  &MD; 
Representatives Martin Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, and Christopher
Shays, a Connecticut Republican  &MD;  said Friday that the unexpected
start of Senate debate gave impetus to efforts in the House.
<p>
   ``Bipartisan campaign reform is not dead in the House of
Representatives,'' said Meehan. ``We think, given a chance, the
House will support bipartisan campaign reform. No one is going to
prevent this from happening.''
<p>
   Proponents of campaign finance reform say money in politics is
the reason for cynicism among the voters toward government. As
politicians ask more and more people for money, voters believe
senators and congressmen wind up doing favors for a wealthy few.
<p>
   McCain, who repeatedly noted his conservative credentials, said,
``Most Americans believe that every one of us  &MD;  whether we publicly
advocate or publicly oppose campaign finance reform  &MD;  is working
either openly or deceitfully to prevent even the slightest repair
to a campaign finance system that they firmly believe is corrupt.''

DALLAS MUSEUM OF ART SHOW SHARES MUCH OF LIFE  &MD;  AND DEATH  &MD;  ON THE

<p>
   DALLAS  &MD;  Thanks to the mummy's curse, the riddle of the Sphinx
and other shadowy lore, we tend to think of ancient Egypt in terms
of mystery and, well, death.
<p>
   Or, if not death, at least not in terms of people partying down
on the banks of the Nile.
<p>
   Featuring relief carvings of lively feasts, jewelry, personal
furnishings and other evidence of daily life, the Dallas Museum of
Art's new show strives to dispel such traditional dark notions of
Egypt. But, thanks to the nature of museum exhibitions  &MD;  with their
display cases, deft lighting and such  &MD;  there's almost no way it
can.
<p>
   ``Searching for Ancient Egypt: Art, Architecture and Artifacts''
features more than 130 objects, spanning about 6,000 years, from
the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology's distinguished collection. Co-organized by the DMA
and Penn museum, the show will travel to five other cities after
closing in Dallas.
<p>
   Although most of the objects on view were taken from tombs, they
convey considerable information about everyday Egyptian life, says
Anne Bromberg, exhibition co-curator and the DMA's curator of
antiquities.
<p>
   Ancient Egyptians had much in common with their modern
counterparts, including ``devotion to family and favored pets,''
Bromberg adds. ``They also had a pronounced sense of humor and a
love for parties, sports, luxuries and good food and drink.''
<p>
   The sunny side of Egyptian life doesn't really come across here,
though. ``Searching for Ancient Egypt'' boasts a number of
marvelous sculptural works, vessels, relief carvings and items of
jewelry. But, overall, it feels like any other well-presented
exhibition of Egyptian art  &MD;  which is to say, vaguely funereal.
<p>
   The portrait heads, architectural fragments, monumental vases
and other major objects are shown in dramatic, somewhat forbidding,
isolation in artificially lighted galleries, darkly painted. If
they mirror daily life, it's generally in the context of the
afterlife. As such, the feeling is solemn, not festive.
Magnificent, not merry.
<p>
   Nonetheless, in its own museum-conventional way  &MD;  ``Searching
for Ancient Egypt'' is eminently engaging and worth at least one,
protracted visit.
<p>
   ``Searching for Ancient Egypt: Art, Architecture and Artifacts''
<p>
   Through Feb. 1: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesday-Friday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, also 4-9 p.m. Thursday at the Dallas Museum of
Art, 1717 N. Harwood St.
<p>
   Tickets: $8 adults; $6 for students, seniors and members of
groups of 20 or more; $3 for children younger than 12. Audio tours
are included in ticket price. Advance tickets are on sale through
the DMA at (214) 922-1825 or (214) 922-1217, or Dillard's ticketing
outlets at (888) MUMMIES.
<p>
   Information: (214) 922-1200
<p>
   MAIN ART
``West Wall of the Tomb Chapel of Kaipura'' (2415-2298 B.C.), from
Saqqara
<p>
   Weighing more than 16 tons, this group of limestone blocks
includes a symbolic, false door through which the deceased's soul
could pass. It subtly is carved in low relief and retains traces of
the bright pigment that enlivened its scenes of tribute and
feasting on barbecue and, yes, beer. The wall is one of two that
ran along each side of the long, narrow chapel. Visitors would have
entered at the right, by the protruding section carved with images
of boats.
``Set of Canopic Jars'' (664-525 B.C.), from Giza
<p>
   Topped with deftly carved heads of the four ``canopic'' sons of
Horus  &MD;  human, ape, falcon and jackal  &MD;  these bulbous limestone
jars held the mummified liver, stomach, lungs and bowels of the
deceased. The jars, in turn, would have been stored inside a
decorated chest.
``Head of Thutmose III'' (1479-1425 B.C.), possibly from Karnak
<p>
   The origins of Egyptian art are intertwined with the
establishment of Egyptian kingship, and this near life-size head of
Thutmose III conveys a sense of personality at once human and
particular, and godlike and transcendent. A mighty warrior and able
administrator  &MD;  arguably Egypt's greatest pharaoh  &MD;  Thutmose III
established history's first solidly founded empire. This idealized
portrait of him is sculpted in red granite; the granite's coarse
texture beautifully contrasts with the fine carving.
``Broad Collar'' (1980-1630 B.C.), from Meidum
<p>
   Along with a handful of other objects in ``Searching for Ancient
Egypt,'' this glistening collar of glazed clay beads is from Nubia
 &MD;  which at times was conquered by Egypt and at other times ruled
Egypt. It's easy to imagine how striking this must have looked
against dark skin, draped with a white-bleached linen tunic. As
such, it evokes the pleasures of ancient life more clearly than
almost anything else on view.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Edison Brothers
Stores Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 today, after almost two years
in bankruptcy proceedings, faced with the tough job of recarving a
niche in the hyper-competitive apparel retail market.
<p>
   St. Louis-based Edison Brothers, which operates shoe and
clothing stores including Jeans West, Oaktree, J. Riggins, and Wild
Pair, won creditors' approval Sept. 9 of a reorganization plan
designed to pay secured creditors 100 percent of their claims.
<p>
   Alan Miller, president, chairman, and chief executive of Edison
Brothers, said today it won't be easy for Edison Brothers in a
market where shoppers are squeezing retailers for the best deal. To
win the battle, Edison Brothers must focus on its strength in the
youth and big-and-tall markets.
<p>
   While reorganizing in bankruptcy court, Edison Brothers closed
more than a thousand stores to cut losses and fired more than 5,000
employees to get the company back on a sound financial footing.
<p>
   `` I think that we have spent two years investing in the future
of the company,'' said Miller. ``We feel good that we are exiting
(bankruptcy) a strong company.''
<p>
   Under the reorganization plan, unsecured creditors stand to
recover about 91 cents on the dollar, and shareholders are to
receive stock worth 32 cents a share of the reorganized company,
Edison Brothers said. The company also has lined up a new $200
million line of credit from Congress Financial Inc. and CIT Capital
Inc. to fuel its reorganized operations.
<p>
   Miller said Edison Brothers will distinguish itself from
competitors with new stores featuring such things as hot retro
fashions and skate-wear, including platform shoes, lava lamps and
body jewelry for teens, and by selling more brand-name apparel.
<p>
   Analysts, though, say that Edison Brothers likely will have
trouble avoiding the financial woes that landed it in bankruptcy in
1995.
<p>
   ``They have a very rough way ahead of them, the competition is
extremely stiff,'' said Kurt Bernard, the president of the Bernard
Retail Trend Report, based in New Jersey. ``The question is whether
the emergence is out of bankruptcy or into growth and success.''
<p>
   The odds are stacked against Edison Brothers, said Britt Beemer,
a New York-based analyst. The key to Edison's survival, like all
retailers, is finding a way to differentiate itself from its
competitors, he said.
<p>
   ``Since they don't stand out, it will be difficult,'' said
Beemer. ``They are going to have to find themselves a niche, and
will have to go back to basics.''

<p>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I.  &MD;  The New England Patriots have until early
next week to agree to move the team here or Rhode Island's proposal
to build a new $250 million stadium will be withdrawn, officials
said Friday.
<p>
   Gov. Lincoln Almond's office said it may force the issue with
team owner Robert Kraft as early as Monday morning and if Kraft
hesitates, asks for more time or more money, ``We most likely will
withdraw our package,'' said Edward Morabito, Almond's chief of
staff.
<p>
   Kraft could not be reached for comment last night.
<p>
   The situation has taken a surprising turn.
<p>
   Last Tuesday, the same day Almond called off negotiations, both
sides had agreed to the points in a memorandum of understanding,
Morabito said. But Kraft, apparently worried that the political
landscape in Rhode Island could change in the next year and his
handshake deal with the current administration could evaporate,
wanted another day for his lawyers to go over the language in the
lengthy document. Individuals familiar with the negotiations say
Kraft was even willing to announce the deal by phone from Dallas,
where he flew Wednesday for a National Football League owners
conference.
<p>
   But Almond apparently interpreted Kraft's hesitation as a sign
he was not committed and, anxious to save face politically, broke
off talks that night.
<p>
   Now Morabito says the state's offer to contribute as much as
$135 million to a $250 million stadium is being ``reassessed''
this weekend.
<p>
   However, others close to the talks maintained Friday that if the
package remains unchanged from last Tuesday, Kraft will accept the
tentantive deal.
<p>
   ``The real stumbling block wasn't the deal terms,'' said an
official involved in the negotiations who asked not to be
identified. ``What held it up that night was the language in the
documents...If the business points are there the beginning of next
week, it would probably be a doable deal.''
<p>
   The Patriots last night had no comment beyond its usual
statement that the team's goal is ``to find a permanent home.''
<p>
   Franchise vice president Jonathan Kraft, who spoke Friday at the
Central Massachusetts Business Expo in Worcester, Mass., did not
stray from that message when confronted by reporters.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Morabito, in an interview at his office made it clear
the time for talking had ended.
<p>
   ``We are no longer negotiating,'' Morabito said. ``Indeed, when
we return to the table  &MD;  or if we come to the table  &MD;  we are only
sitting down if they agree to a deal. It doesn't do anything for
the state if we prolong talks.''
<p>
   He also said the governor's office was taking a ``harder look''
at the numbers presented to Kraft ``to see if that will be
available in the future.'' Then he added: ``Frankly, we're at the
finishing line.''
<p>
   When asked why Almond did not want to let Kraft's attorneys work
through the night going over the documents, Morabito said he
respected their hesitancy.
<p>
   ``But the problem with that mindset is that there's never going
to be an agreement. There's always going to be those issues and
attorneys are always going to get involved. And until we can be
sure a commitment is there...the adminstration's fear is this is
going to drag on,'' he said. ``I think even if they do sign and
all the details are taken care of, they're still going to be
gun-shy of the process.''
<p>
   The situation intensified Tuesday when what the administration
expected to be a short meeting to tie up loose ends turned into a
marathon session. By 6 p.m., Almond questioned the Krafts'
commitment and called for a time out. Then, in a news conference
room set up to announce that a deal had been struck, Almond
instead had to tell reporters that both sides needed a break.
<p>
   Morabito also said the Krafts did ``ask for more'' on Tuesday,
but he declined to specify what that meant.
<p>
   ``They've got to finally decide if they want to come here,''
Morabito added. ``The governor has instructed us to take a hard
look at where we are to make sure our numbers, our assumptions,
<p>
   are correct...We're having a very thorough re-look. Whether the
same exact items will be on the table when we return I don't
know.''
<p>
   He said there was no set deadline but that both sides were
likely to talk Monday or Tuesday.
<p>
   Morabito confirmed that the exclusivity agreement is built into
the memorandum of understanding with Providence, meaning that if
Kraft accepts the proposal, he would not be allowed to negotiate a
stadium deal with anyone else for a given time.
<p>
   So essentially, Kraft has to decide between the Providence and
Foxborough, Mass. proposals within the next few days.
<p>
   On Thursday, Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci filed a bill that would
provide $30 million in infrastructure improvements around Foxboro
Stadium and would buy from Kraft the 316 acres around the facility
for another $20 million. In turn, Kraft would be expected to spend
at least $50 million of his own money to expand the stadium.
<p>
   However, Almond's office and the Patriots have both said there
is no competition between the two states, that they are different
proposals with different consequences, good and bad.
<p>
   Almond's rush to get the deal done on Tuesday had less to do
with the Foxborough bill's scheduled filing date than it did his
own political deadline.
<p>
   ``We believe strongly there was a time to make a commitment on
Tuesday. They didn't feel committed,'' Morabito said.
<p>
   ``The danger is, on their part, that they can't drive a bargain
so good for them that they negotiate themselves out of a deal...I
said we can't go any further. When we say that, we mean it.''

   (italics)Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin spent the last 10
days in Asia. In Hong Kong, he wrestled with the problems of
Southeast Asia's currency crisis, first at meetings of the finance
ministers of the world's leading industrial nations, and then at
the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. Next he traveled to China's interior to assess its confusing,
often contradictory brew of economic changes. David E. Sanger,
formerly the Tokyo bureau chief of The Times and now Washington
economic correspondent, joined the tour. Following is his
day-by-day account:(end italics) &QL;

   Sept. 19: A Repair Mission Begins
<p>
   When Hollywood makes the inevitable sequel to ``Air Force One,''
maybe the producers should forget about the president. Instead,
they can title it ``Air Force 86971,'' for the tail number on the
creaky, Eisenhower-era plane taking three of the most powerful
policy setters in the global economy to meet their Asian
counterparts: Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, his wise-cracking
deputy Lawrence H. Summers and the Sphinx-like Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
<p>
   O.K., a meeting of finance ministers may not sound like the
makings of a box-office bonanza, but imagine the story line: The
plane is not seized by a bunch of crazed nuclear terrorists, but
instead by wild-eyed bond traders, aided by a cabal of currency
traders who, to add a bit of verisimilitude, have just flattened
the Malaysian economy.
<p>
   They demand that Messrs. Rubin, Summers and Greenspan spill
their plans for short-term interest rates and the direction of the
dollar. As the midair standoff drags on, markets quiver from
Bangkok to Berlin. A worldwide recession hangs in the balance.
<p>
   Well, maybe not. Up here on the real Air Force 86971, everyone
is complaining about the cheese on the nachos and the pitiful
flying range of the plane, which must refuel three times between
Washington and Hong Kong. But that allows time for Rubin to reflect
on the fact that this is his first trip to the world's most
populous country  &MD;  either in his old life, as an investment banker,
or in the five years he has served President Clinton.
<p>
   ``When I was at Goldman,'' he says, referring to his 26 years at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., ``there weren't enough commercial
transactions in China to even justify a trip. It was all Tokyo, and
at the end a little Hong Kong.'' The world looks very different
today. Japan can't seem to dig itself out of its hole. And the boom
in Southeast Asia has hit a brick wall, with the currency crisis
that started in Thailand spreading like jungle thatch.
<p>
   So Rubin's tour is now an urgent repair mission. He wants to use
the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund to make sure countries that are opening their financial
markets don't backtrack. And in China, he must pave the way for
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Washington next month, the
first by a Chinese leader in a dozen years.
<p>
   Rubin readily acknowledges that the administration's
interactions with China over the last five years are nothing to
crow about. ``We can properly be faulted,'' he says, ``for vastly
underinvesting in our relationships with Chinese officials up and
down the line.'' It's no surprise, he adds, that ``we keep having
such a hard time understanding each other.''
<p>
   Such candor in an administration that often seems to believe its
own spin is the key to Rubin's remarkably good press. Having a few
hundred million dollars in the bank gives him, as one Cabinet
colleague noted recently, ``the security to say exactly what he
thinks.'' He also seems to speak a common language with Greenspan,
who steers clear of reporters on the 20-hour trip as assiduously as
Rubin seeks them out.
<p>
   As the plane circles halfway around the world, Rubin huddles
with his staff to discuss how to react if anti-Americanism flares
in Hong Kong. The prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad,
will be there, contending anew that American speculators victimized
his country by borrowing his currency and using it to drive down
his stock market.
<p>
   Others don't see an American conspiracy in all this, but resent
the fact that the United States, while not a major contributor to
the $20 billion IMF bailout of Thailand, nonetheless insisted that
the Thais endure a strict, Mexico-style austerity plan.
<p>
   The Japanese, some Treasury officials warn, may try to exploit
those emotions to regain influence they have lost during their own
recession and banking crisis.
<p>
   This quiet tug-of-war is a constant subtext of relations in the
Pacific  &MD;  and trade deficits, interest rates and direct investment
are all weapons in the struggle. ``Hoo, boy,'' Rubin says. ``This
could be a circus.''
<p>
   Sept. 20: Jet Lag and a Jolt
<p>
   It is 8 a.m. in Rubin's suite overlooking Victoria Harbor, and
his prediction is coming true. ``We've just had a dispute,'' Rubin
declares as his jet-lagged aides stumble into a staff meeting.
<p>
   The Japanese, technically the hosts of today's meeting of the
Group of Seven finance ministers, are floating a proposal for a
special fund to rescue Asian nations caught in the the cycle of
currency devaluations and stock-market slides.
<p>
   It is hardly an act of altruism: Japan's battered banks have
lent tens of billions of dollars to build many of the projects
throughout Asia that are now crashing.
<p>
   Rubin wants to head off the idea fast. It could amount to an
``Asia-for-Asians fund,'' he says, undercutting American interests.
And it is far from clear that the Japanese would join Washington in
insisting on the full disclosure of financial data before a country
could tap the kitty.
<p>
   But his biggest fear is that the mere existence of such a huge
pool of money could create what bankers call a ``moral hazard'';
investors could sleep soundly, knowing that any Southeast Asian
nation that threw economic discipline out the window would be
bailed out.

<p>
   ``We need to find a way for investors to take a haircut when
this kind of thing happens,'' said Rubin, who faced heavy criticism
after the bailout of Mexico in 1995 also ended up bailing out the
American banks and Mexican millionaires who financed the country's
unwise decisions.
<p>
   Late in the day, Prime Minister Mahathir steals all the
headlines, in a fiery speech blaming the ``great powers'' for his
country's crisis and suggesting that currency trading for anything
other than facilitating deals between countries is ``immoral.''
<p>
   Rubin gives a cool response, describing currency trading as
``integral to a global and modern economy.''
<p>
   Quietly, his aides make a point of telling reporters that
Malaysia's central bank was a huge speculator in the currency
markets for years  &MD;  and seemed unconcerned about the morality of it
all while it was winning.
<p>
   Sept. 21: Sizing Up Capitalism
<p>
   This is supposed to be Hong Kong's big coming-out party as a
Chinese city, the first huge international gathering since the July
1 handover. And China's leaders are pouring in to survey their new
pearl.
<p>
   If during the summer there was speculation that Hong Kong would
change China more than China would change Hong Kong, here is
China's future: With 20,000 bankers in town, luxury hotels have
ratcheted up their rates to more than $500 a night.
<p>
   Across Victoria Harbor, in Manu Melwani's narrow tailor shop,
the phone rings. ``O.K., O.K., O.K, I'll come to him,'' Melwani
says, exasperation creeping into his voice.
<p>
   It is Sunday morning, usually time here for a leisurely dim sum
brunch, but Melwani is inundated with orders from customers who
want their suits, in the finest British wools, before the end of
the World Bank-IMF meetings.
<p>
   This banker, Melwani is told over the phone, is special. ``This
fellow  &MD;  Greenberg, Greentree, no here it is, Greenspan  &MD;  does he
run a big bank?'' he asks a customer. Well, not exactly. But he
does set interest rates for the United States and, by extension,
much of the world.
<p>
   Melwani digests these facts for a moment, glances at his wall of
fabrics, and concludes: ``He'll probably want pinstripes.''
<p>
   Sept. 22: China's Economic Lurch
<p>
   Rubin is still wrestling with Southeast Asia's problems, but
over lunch with the American Chamber of Commerce here he takes time
out to get his mind around what is happening in the rest of China.
<p>
   At the Party Congress earlier in the month, the Chinese formally
embraced the economy's lurch to what the China is now calling
``diversified ownership.'' (They will not use the word
``privatization'' in regard to their huge, inefficient state-owned
enterprises, and by midweek, Rubin has shifted his language as
well.)
<p>
   The problem, the executives tell Rubin, is that no one knows
what ``diversified ownership'' means. Shareholders with real power?
Continued government control?
<p>
   ``You have to wonder who is going to be buying all these
companies,'' said Jeffrey S. Muir, director of external affairs in
Hong Kong for Seagram Asia Pacific, part of the Canadian beverage
and entertainment giant. And if the process is too quick, others
warn Rubin, a result could be huge layoffs and instability in a
country where 100 million unemployed and underemployed people
already wander the countryside.
<p>
   here is the usual round of complaints about doing business in
the Middle Kingdom  &MD;  from corruption to the slow payoff on
investments  &MD;  and lots of discussion of the precarious condition of
China's banking system, which loaned billions to the near-bankrupt
state-run industries.
<p>
   But the Southeast Asian crisis, one banker tells Rubin, ``may
turn out to be a blessing for China: they can see what happens when
you leave all this unattended.''
<p>
   Sept. 23: The Free-Market Waltz
<p>
   Rubin wants the reporters traveling with him to understand that
he has just won a great diplomatic victory, even if the evidence is
scarce. A meeting with Southeast Asia's finance ministers that
Treasury officials feared could turn into a debacle  &MD;  ``let Larry
do the food tasting,'' Rubin joked  &MD;  actually turned out well.
<p>
   ``They all said the same thing,'' Rubin declares. ``In their
view, they have to stay on the path to market liberalization.'' The
ministers agreed to hold a meeting somewhere in Asia, with
participants yet to be named, to talk about what to do next. The
subtext: America is back in the middle of the game; the steam is
out of the Japanese bailout plan.
<p>
   The session is a reminder that Rubin and his staff spend an
enormous amount of time talking to other finance ministers and
central bankers  &MD;  most of whom, these days, share a relatively
common world view. With some exceptions  &MD;  usually to protect their
own territory  &MD;  they lean toward open markets, competition and
deregulation.
<p>
   It is the politicians they work for, and the industrialists who
finance elections, who resist market openings. But by and large,
such characters are not here.
<p>
   ``Our finance minister can say anything he wants in a closed
meeting,'' noted one Thai official, whose government was teetering
all week. ``But what can he say when he gets home?''
<p>
   In short, finance ministers describe the world of currencies and
fiscal policies the way they would like to see it  &MD;  and then pray
that the markets win out over political opposition. That is true
even for Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister of Malaysia and
Mahathir's presumed successor.
<p>
   Meeting with Rubin, he is backpedaling fast, offering assurances
that his country  &MD;  whose currency hit a 26-year-low after
Mahathir's Saturday speech  &MD;  is not about to ban currency trading.
<p>
   Rubin tried to be sympathetic; after all, he has been trotted
out more than once to clean up messes after President Clinton's
ill-considered comments on currencies.

   ``I told him,'' he said later, ``that the situation is not
completely unfamiliar to me.''
<p>
   Sept. 24: Heartland Lessons
<p>
   Like most visitors to Xi'an, Rubin tours China's most astounding
archeological treasure: the army of thousands of life-size figures
that protect the graves of the Chinese emperors.
<p>
   But he traveled to Xi'an for reasons that have little to do with
tourism. The ancient capital is on the edge of central China, not
the go-go coast. Xi'an is more staid than Shanghai or Guangzhou,
but it's learning.
<p>
   Cars choke the downtown as Rubin's motorcade wends past
ramshackle markets and loose chickens on the way to the jewelry
factor of the Xi'an Diamond Co. The business is one of six
experimental companies in the city that are all but completely
private, with most employees holding shares that trade on the
Shanghai market and enjoying salaries that have vastly improved
their living standards.
<p>
   No sooner is Rubin in the door than the investment banker in him
bursts out.
<p>
   The chairman, Xu Zonglin, 41, an entrepreneur, boasts that the
company had a 60 percent profit margin last year. ``Is there an
independent accounting firm that checks your books?'' Rubin asks,
pressing for more details until it is clear that Xu's definition of
``independent'' and Rubin's are a bit different. Told that the
company sells to Italy and buys equipment in the United States,
Rubin asks detailed questions about currency convertibility.
<p>
   Soon Xu and Rubin zip across town to a huge construction site,
where the jewelry mogul is building a new factory, one of China's
largest jewelry trading exchanges and dormitories.
<p>
   ``How long did it take to get the city's approval for this huge
project?'' Rubin asks. ``One month,'' Xu responds. Among the
Americans, eyebrows shoot up.
<p>
   Lei Bao Yin, the local Communist Party chief, describes all he
did to help Xu move quickly through the bureaucracy.``We have
noticed some corruption,'' he says, ``but now the Communist Party
realizes that anti-corruption is vital to the existence of the
party.''
<p>
   Sept. 25: Skeptical Students
<p>
   In 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests, People's
University in Beijing was a hotbed of anti-government activity. But
today, the students are questioning not the legitimacy of their
government, but the global push  &MD;  led by the United States  &MD;  to
open China's markets.
<p>
   After listening to a speech by Rubin, the students  &MD;  presumably
selected by the university  &MD;  ask what he would do about shrinking
the state-owned enterprises, and he responds by talking about the
need for ``a basic safety net,'' and a program to figure out how
workers can ``relocate themselves in the economy.''
<p>
   ``We have the same problems,'' Rubin notes. ``But it is the
wrong answer to resist change, because you will simply stagnate.''
<p>
   The students are intrigued, but not convinced. ``My professor
told me that in Mexico there was a lot of suffering a few years
ago,'' says Ye Bihua, 20, an economics major, sounding a lot like
critics of the Mexican bailout in the United States. ``And I'm
afraid that if we let foreign banks come to China too soon, it will
cause even more troubles, like Mexico had.''
<p>
   Rubin ends the day by meeting Zhu Rongji, China's
recently-elevated economic czar, in the Great Hall of the People.
Gently, he raises the subject of a big pending order for Boeing
jets. Zhu laughs and tells him that he was a lot more diplomatic
than Jacques Chirac, the French president, who arrived here
recently insisting that China buy 100 Airbus jets.
<p>
   So what about those Boeings? Rubin prodded. Zhu would only hint
that another diplomatically convenient order was on the way.
<p>
   Sept. 26: A Jovial President
<p>
   The big day: Rubin's limousine zips through the gates of the
guarded compound where emperors once frolicked, where Mao Zedong
ordered the construction of the giant state factories  &MD;  and where
Jiang Zemin is now trying to turn an economy around.
<p>
   Jiang is waiting for Rubin in the doorway of the Yingtai, the
ornate, 300-year-old guest house where foreign dignitaries are
received. ``The Treasury Department is always the most important in
any country,'' Jiang says jovially. ``Meeting a Treasury Secretary
makes you think you will become rich.''
<p>
   What struck American participants in the meeting was that Jiang
was so casual, even telling self-deprecating jokes about how
history may judge his move to freer markets. He spoke about
bringing in newer, younger leaders who understood global markets.
But he also made it clear that China would move on its own
schedule.
<p>
   ``He was often quite philosophical,'' Rubin said later, ``and he
clearly had a plan.''
<p>
   And then the Treasury secretary's motorcade slipped out of the
compound, across Tiananmen Square, where crowds watched the sunset
lowering of the Chinese flag, and Rubin began the long trip back to
the Washington fray.

<p>
   Americans who are interested in baseball favor interleague play
and the designated hitter, but are divided over realignment and
whether Bud Selig should remain the acting commissioner, according
to the latest New York Times poll.
<p>
   The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Sept. 18 to 20. Of
the 1,051 adults polled, 15 percent said they were very interested
in baseball, 27 percent said they were somewhat interested and 58
percent said they were not interested.
<p>
   The 440 people who said they were very interested or somewhat
interested in baseball were asked additional questions. Here are
the results, which have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
5 percentage points:
<p>
    &MD;  Do you like the designated-hitter rule, now used in the
American League? The vote was 50 percent yes, 32 percent no and 18
percent no opinion.
<p>
    &MD;  Do you like interleague play, which was introduced this year?
The vote was 75 percent yes, 17 percent no and 8 percent no
opinion.
<p>
    &MD;  If you favor interleague play, would you like more interleague
games than the 210 played this year? The 75 percent who favored
interleague play broke down as follows: 12 percent for more games,
5 percent for fewer, 56 percent for the same and 2 percent no
opinion.
<p>
    &MD;  Do you favor a geographical realignment of the major leagues,
now being discussed by baseball officials? The vote was 44 percent
yes, 40 percent no and 16 percent no opinion.
<p>
    &MD;  Does major-league baseball need a permanent commissioner, or
should Bud Selig continue as acting commissioner? The vote was 45
percent for a permanent commissioner, 42 percent for the status quo
and 13 percent no opinion.
<p>
    &MD;  If you favor a permanent commissioner, would you prefer Selig
or someone else? The 45 percent who favored a permanent
commissioner broke down as follows: 16 percent for Selig, 22
percent for someone else and 7 percent no opinion. Telephone calls
to respondents after the poll was completed found firm opinions on
the designated hitter. Lisa Taylor, a 30-year-old fourth-grade
teacher from Hillsdale, Mich., said she liked it.
<p>
   ``When I was 10,'' she said, ``I followed the Detroit Tigers.
Rusty Staub was the designated hitter. It's good to have a strong
hitter like that who can do things for the Tigers or any team.''
<p>
   Another in favor was Cindy (she declined to give her last name),
a 42-year-old veterinarian from the Boston area. As she put it,
``Pitchers are hired for their pitching ability, but they can't
hit, so someone should come in and hit for them.''
<p>
   Eric Wollam, a 29-year-old CAT-scan technologist from Bradford,
Tenn., opposed the designated hitter.
<p>
   ``It takes managing out of the game,'' he said. ``In the
National League, when the pitcher is due up, he may be pitching a
good game, but you need a run and you have hitters on base. Do you
hit for him? I like thinking-man's baseball. You've got older guys
in the American League who can't run and can't field, just hit. If
they can't do anything else, why should they be playing?''

   Roy Hernandez, 36, likes interleague games, and not only because
they are good for his business. He works for Baseball Express San
Antonio, a mail-order catalogue company, and watches the Atlanta
Braves telecasts on weekends.
<p>
   ``Interleague games seem to be drawing a lot more fans,'' he
said. ``The only reason some people are against them is that
they're afraid of change.''
<p>
   Realignment has stirred emotions, too. One advocate is
48-year-old Joe Reinman of Greenville, S.C., who writes industrial
training manuals.
<p>
   ``Realigning by geography would be a good idea,'' he said. ``I
grew up in Atlanta, and it made no sense that the Braves always
played in the Western Division. I'd rather see them play Eastern
teams. The Braves against the Los Angeles Dodgers is good, but the
Braves against the Florida Marlins is better.''

   LAREDO, Texas  &MD;  Armed with rubber gloves and laxatives, U.S.
Customs agents have spent this week combating a gutsy breed of
heroin trafficker.
<p>
   Known as ``swallowers,'' traffickers load dozens of condoms with
illegal drugs, lubricate them in oil and ease them down their
throats before trying to slip into the country at international
bridges and airports, authorities said Friday.
<p>
   Agents say a single load can be worth about $1 million.
<p>
   Customs officials in Texas said swallowers were arrested this
week in Eagle Pass, Houston and in Del Rio as they tried to enter
the United States from Mexico.
<p>
   The illicit pellets, which are about the size of batteries or
shotgun shells, are stored in the swallower's stomach and retrieved
through bowel movements.
<p>
   A pound of heroin can be worth up to $1 million, but authorities
warn that smuggling by swallowing is extremely risky. If a condom
breaks, it means death.
<p>
   ``The second this stuff gets into your bloodstream, you are
gone,'' said Steven Hooper, deputy agent-in-charge for Customs in
Houston.
<p>
   Three alleged swallowers from Colombia have been caught in Texas
this week, including Favio Zapata, 38, who spent Friday passing
evidence in a heavily guarded toilet at Val Verde Regional Medical
Center in Del Rio.
<p>
   ``We kept two officers with him at all times,'' Customs
supervisor David Green said.
<p>
   Officers recovered 90 condoms from the suspect, he said.
<p>
   ``It is something totally unusual for us,'' Green said. ``It's
good to get this off the street.''
<p>
   Zapata arrived at the U.S. border in a taxi cab and tried to
enter the country with a fake Guatemalan passport, agents said.
<p>
   After he raised the suspicions of border guards, his stomach was
X-rayed, revealing the pellets, officers said.
<p>
   Earlier in the week, in the nearby border city of Eagle Pass,
Customs agents caught a man who allegedly swallowed three pounds of
heroin. And another man, with a smaller load, was arrested at an
airport in Houston.
<p>
   ``There continues to be an increasing steam of heroin from
Colombia to the United States,'' Hooper said by telephone from
Houston.
<p>
   ``Just what one of these guys have in their stomach is worth
more than a million dollars on the street,'' he said.
<p>
   Swallower cases are more common at international airports than
international bridges along the U.S.-Mexico border, but smugglers
might have thought it would be easier to slip into this country
among the large crowds of pedestrians, Hooper said.
<p>
   It was not immediately known if the week's cases were related,
but in the past, swallowers have been connected to trafficking
organizations based in cities such as Houston, Chicago and New
York, Hooper said.
<p>
   ``From what I understand, they train in South America to get
used to it,'' Hooper said of swallowing condoms. ``The natural
reaction is to spit it up.''
<p>
   When suspected swallowers are detained, their stomachs are
X-rayed. If authorities find the suspicious pellets, the person is
given a laxative and taken to a hospital.
<p>
   From there, it's just a waiting game.
<p>
   ``The record may be five days,'' Hooper said. ``Every once in a
while, they'll have to have them removed surgically.''

<p>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I.  &MD;  The New England Patriots have until early
next week to agree to move the team here or Rhode Island's proposal
to build a new $250 million stadium will be withdrawn, officials
said Friday.
<p>
   Gov. Lincoln Almond's office said it may force the issue with
team owner Robert Kraft as early as Monday morning and if Kraft
hesitates, asks for more time or more money, ``We most likely will
withdraw our package,'' said Edward Morabito, Almond's chief of
staff.
<p>
   Kraft could not be reached for comment last night.
<p>
   The situation has taken a surprising turn.
<p>
   Last Tuesday, the same day Almond called off negotiations, both
sides had agreed to the points in a memorandum of understanding,
Morabito said. But Kraft, apparently worried that the political
landscape in Rhode Island could change in the next year and his
handshake deal with the current administration could evaporate,
wanted another day for his lawyers to go over the language in the
lengthy document. Individuals familiar with the negotiations say
Kraft was even willing to announce the deal by phone from Dallas,
where he flew Wednesday for a National Football League owners
conference.
<p>
   But Almond apparently interpreted Kraft's hesitation as a sign
he was not committed and, anxious to save face politically, broke
off talks that night.
<p>
   Now Morabito says the state's offer to contribute as much as
$135 million to a $250 million stadium is being ``reassessed''
this weekend.
<p>
   However, others close to the talks maintained Friday that if the
package remains unchanged from last Tuesday, Kraft will accept the
tentantive deal.
<p>
   ``The real stumbling block wasn't the deal terms,'' said an
official involved in the negotiations who asked not to be
identified. ``What held it up that night was the language in the
documents...If the business points are there the beginning of next
week, it would probably be a doable deal.''
<p>
   The Patriots last night had no comment beyond its usual
statement that the team's goal is ``to find a permanent home.''
<p>
   Franchise vice president Jonathan Kraft, who spoke Friday at the
Central Massachusetts Business Expo in Worcester, Mass., did not
stray from that message when confronted by reporters.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Morabito, in an interview at his office made it clear
the time for talking had ended.
<p>
   ``We are no longer negotiating,'' Morabito said. ``Indeed, when
we return to the table  &MD;  or if we come to the table  &MD;  we are only
sitting down if they agree to a deal. It doesn't do anything for
the state if we prolong talks.''
<p>
   He also said the governor's office was taking a ``harder look''
at the numbers presented to Kraft ``to see if that will be
available in the future.'' Then he added: ``Frankly, we're at the
finishing line.''
<p>
   When asked why Almond did not want to let Kraft's attorneys work
through the night going over the documents, Morabito said he
respected their hesitancy.
<p>
   ``But the problem with that mindset is that there's never going
to be an agreement. There's always going to be those issues and
attorneys are always going to get involved. And until we can be
sure a commitment is there...the adminstration's fear is this is
going to drag on,'' he said. ``I think even if they do sign and
all the details are taken care of, they're still going to be
gun-shy of the process.''
<p>
   The situation intensified Tuesday when what the administration
expected to be a short meeting to tie up loose ends turned into a
marathon session. By 6 p.m., Almond questioned the Krafts'
commitment and called for a time out. Then, in a news conference
room set up to announce that a deal had been struck, Almond
instead had to tell reporters that both sides needed a break.
<p>
   Morabito also said the Krafts did ``ask for more'' on Tuesday,
but he declined to specify what that meant.
<p>
   ``They've got to finally decide if they want to come here,''
Morabito added. ``The governor has instructed us to take a hard
look at where we are to make sure our numbers, our assumptions,
<p>
   are correct...We're having a very thorough re-look. Whether the
same exact items will be on the table when we return I don't
know.''
<p>
   He said there was no set deadline but that both sides were
likely to talk Monday or Tuesday.
<p>
   Morabito confirmed that the exclusivity agreement is built into
the memorandum of understanding with Providence, meaning that if
Kraft accepts the proposal, he would not be allowed to negotiate a
stadium deal with anyone else for a given time.
<p>
   So essentially, Kraft has to decide between the Providence and
Foxborough, Mass. proposals within the next few days.
<p>
   On Thursday, Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci filed a bill that would
provide $30 million in infrastructure improvements around Foxboro
Stadium and would buy from Kraft the 316 acres around the facility
for another $20 million. In turn, Kraft would be expected to spend
at least $50 million of his own money to expand the stadium.
<p>
   However, Almond's office and the Patriots have both said there
is no competition between the two states, that they are different
proposals with different consequences, good and bad.
<p>
   Almond's rush to get the deal done on Tuesday had less to do
with the Foxborough bill's scheduled filing date than it did his
own political deadline.
<p>
   ``We believe strongly there was a time to make a commitment on
Tuesday. They didn't feel committed,'' Morabito said.
<p>
   ``The danger is, on their part, that they can't drive a bargain
so good for them that they negotiate themselves out of a deal...I
said we can't go any further. When we say that, we mean it.''

   Miami, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Miami Dolphins rookie linebacker
Ronnie Ward broke his left leg in practice, adding to the team's
injury problems.
<p>
   Ward, Miami's third-round pick this year out the University of
Kansas, suffered a non-displaced fracture of his left tibia. With
Miami having a bye this week, his roster status will be
re-evaluated next week, the team said.
<p>
   Ward has appeared in four games this season as a reserve and
hasn't recorded a tackle.
<p>
   The injury is the most recent of several to plague the Dolphins
this season. Eleven players have undergone surgery since the start
of training camp and four, kick returner Kirby Dar Dar, receiver
Yatil Green, linebacker Larry Izzo and defensive end Daniel Stubbs,
will miss the entire season.

   ASFORDBY, England  &MD;  The three men in blue public-works coveralls
weeding the shoulder of the road just up from the clattering
conveyor belts of the Asfordby coal mine were asked where the plant
entrance was.
<p>
   ``Next turning on the left, mate,'' one of them answered,
leaning on his hoe. ``And if you find any jobs down there, save one
for me.''
<p>
   The fact is, soon there will be no jobs left even for the people
who still have them at Asfordby, Britain's most modern coal mine
and the scene of the last government-sponsored effort to prolong
the life of the country's once-mighty coal industry. It is due to
close by the end of October, and the few workers left are busy
salvaging equipment, dismantling machinery and helping seal the
pits.
<p>
   Conceived in 1977 under a Labor government beholden to trade
unions, it is shutting down under a new Labor government with its
eye on a collar of a different color.
<p>
   What is happening in Asfordby and what will be evident when the
smartly turned-out members of ``New Labor'' gather on Sept. 29 in
Brighton for the first annual convention under a Labor prime
minister since 1978 shows that the influence of unions, which
diminished sharply under 18 years of Conservative rule, is
continuing to ebb under a new government with the more
friendly-sounding name of Labor.
<p>
   There was a time when a Labor government responded to mine
closings and lockouts by supporting national strikes and demanding
the restitution of jobs. So when the shutdown of Asfordby and the
layoff of 490 men was announced in August, Neil Greatrex, president
of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, made the predictable demand
that Prime Minister Tony Blair ``come here and put things right.''
<p>
   But the government's response came from John Battle, the
minister for science, energy and industry, who lamented the closing
as ``a great disappointment'' but promised only to review the
company's contentions of geological problems jeopardizing the
mine's safety.
<p>
   When a reporter for The Daily Telegraph asked the prime
minister's office if there was any chance that the government would
intervene, a spokesman bluntly responded, ``Wrong decade.''
<p>
   ``They're no better than the Tories,'' said Ian Riley, 40, a
coal miner here whose features were still covered in soot from his
morning shift.
<p>
   Mark Hunt, 35, who like the three generations of his family
before him has spent his working life tearing away at a coal face,
said: ``Labor should have helped us a lot more than they did. But
once they got our vote, they didn't seem to want us anymore.''
<p>
   The layoffs here are the first since the Labor Party swept to
power in the election on May 1 by positioning itself as New Labor,
representing an aspiring and entrepreneurial Britain.
<p>
   It is a country where the failing smokestack industries that
once provided Labor with its core constituency have been written
off as its past and a robust service economy where the party now
recruits its members is seen as its future.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Blair has repeatedly told his party's socialist and trade union
wings that his government would champion productivity, efficiency
and competitiveness and a unionism that did not confront business
so much as cooperate with it.
<p>
   On Sept. 9, Blair became the first Labor prime minister in two
decades to address the Trades Union Congress at its annual
convention in Brighton. He upbraided his listeners with a warning
that they must ``modernize''  &MD;  Blair's favorite verb these days  &MD; 
or expire.
<p>
   He told his aging audience that today's British economy is one
that exports more rock music than steel and employs more people in
design than in automobile construction.
<p>
   The unions' role, he said, should be to work in partnership with
employers and business to win ``the crusade for competitiveness.''
Recalling Labor's past, he said, ``We will not go back to the days
of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass and flying
pickets, secondary action and all the rest of it.''
<p>
   And in a conclusion that sounded like an opening day admonition
to a freshman class, he told them, ``I will watch very carefully to
see how the culture of modern trade unionism develops.''
<p>
   His listeners, a more grizzled group than the men and women who
will occupy the delegates' seats at the four-day annual Labor Party
conference at the same English Channel resort, responded with
resignation. John Monks, the general secretary of the Trades Union
Congress, acknowledged unprotestingly that Blair had delivered
``some hard messages.''
<p>
   The union movement, which contributed 77 percent of the party's
budget just a decade ago, will see that figure reduced to about 40
percent this year as the party continues its rapid growth in
membership from other sectors of society.
<p>
   The unions' influence in the party, and the country as a whole,
has waned, with union membership declining from 13 million at the
beginning of the Conservative years in 1979 to less than 7 million
now. In the coal industry alone, where there were 1.2 million
organized workers in 1978, there are now fewer than 13,000.
<p>
   The unions would like to see Labor roll back the raft of
legislation curbing their rights to organize and strike that was
passed during the years Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. But
all that Blair has committed himself to are three modest
legislative proposals that would secure a national minimum wage,
benefits for part-time workers and the right of representation for
unions in individual industries where a majority of the employees
want it.
<p>
   The workers of Asfordby may be the last stragglers in a
tradition that enshrined miners as the hard men of British
industry, reviled by many for their union militancy and
romanticized by others for their endurance under hellish
occupational conditions and for the gritty communal spirit of the
embattled pit villages.
<p>
   The British coal industry entered terminal decline in the
1980's, victim of an economic move to natural gas and a political
shift away from the ideological activism associated with the mining
unions.
<p>
   Its hope now for government backing collides with two new Labor
priorities: a commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent
from the 1990 level and an industrial policy pledged to keep pace
with market trends. The British coal industry faces the challenges
of imports that are cheaper and lower in sulphur and electricity
generation plants that increasingly prefer gas to coal.
<p>
   In the privatization of the coal industry in 1994, the Asfordby
colliery was bought from the government by RJB Mining, the largest
coal-mining company in the country.
<p>
   The government, which through the National Coal Board and its
successor, British Coal, had spent $530 million to redevelop
Asfordby, expected that it would employ 1,100 miners and produce
three million tons of coal a year. The men who arrived for work at
what came to be known as the ``superpit'' thought it would provide
a lifetime's employment.
<p>
   But since production began in April 1995, the mine has produced
a total of only 1.5 million tons. And this summer the company said
it would have to abandon the mine because a series of volcanic
sills lying above the coal seams had created rock fractures and
flooding that made it too dangerous.
<p>
   The men at Asfordby, often called ``gypsies'' for the migrations
they have had to make to keep working in the last 20 years, are not
encouraged by the promise of jobs at other RJB mines.
<p>
   ``We expect them to be closed down sooner or later too,'' said
James Porch, 47, another miner. ``We believe the closing of this is
the beginning of the end of the deep mining industry.''

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  A senior Saudi official said Friday that he expected
the controversy over the sentencing of two British nurses charged
with the murder of an Australian colleague in Dhahran in December
to be resolved without execution or flogging.
<p>
   The arrest of Deborah Parry, 38, and Lucille McLauchlan, 31,
their trial in an Islamic religious court and the sentencing of Ms.
Parry to death and Ms. McLauchlan to eight years in jail and 500
lashes have led to a crisis in British-Saudi relations.
<p>
   The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who has described the
sentences as ``wholly unacceptable,'' met Friday afternoon with his
Saudi counterpart, Prince Saud Faisal, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
in New York City, where both were attending the opening session of
the General Assembly.
<p>
   The senior Saudi diplomat maintained Friday, ``I am confident we
will find a solution.'' The official, who insisted on anonymity,
said in a telephone interview before the meeting, ``I hope the
British will not take a provocative stand.
<p>
   ``For our part, it could always be argued that this is case of
Western women harming another Westerner, the official said. ``If
the British and the Australians are satisfied resolving it among
each other, paying compensation or finding another way to deal with
it, it is, in the end, their business. There is no point in a
confrontation as no Saudis are involved.''
<p>
   Speaking on BBC radio Friday morning, Cook appeared equally
anxious to avoid any provocative statements in advance of his
meeting with the Saudi foreign minister.
<p>
   ``I have stressed throughout this week it is very important that
our response is measured,'' Cook said. ``I don't think it would
help anybody, particularly the two nurses, to get into the business
of making threats.''
<p>
   Cook denied knowledge of any deals between the family of the
slain nurse, Yvonne Gilford, 55, to accept monetary compensation in
return for sparing the accused nurses the harsh punishments. Under
Islamic law, the family of a murder victim can forgive the crime in
exchange for some form of compensation.
<p>
   ``There is no deal done, and it would be wrong to assume that
one is resolved yet,'' Cook said Friday before he met with Prince
Saud. ``There is some way to go before we can get an agreement
there.''
<p>
   He stressed that Britain, with the cooperation of the Australian
government, had encouraged lawyers for the families to try to agree
on compensation to spare the life of one nurse and avoid the
flogging and jail sentence for the other. ``I am still hopeful that
we will be able to achieve that,'' Cook added.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   (A spokesman for the British mission to the United Nations said
in New York after the 50-minute meeting, ``It was a useful meeting,
and the foreign secretary left feeling more hopeful of a humane
outcome.'' He said that the issue was ``essentially a consular
case,'' and that the meeting was set up before the British learned
of the nurses' sentencing and was devoted to other issues as well.)
<p>
   British newspapers Friday published letters from both women in
which they asserted their willingness to pay compensation but
insisted on their innocence in the death of Ms. Gilford on Dec. 12,
1996. The Saudi court says they stabbed her 13 times, and
bludgeoned and suffocated her to death. Her body was found in her
room at the King Fahd military medical complex in Dhahran, where
the three worked.
<p>
   Saudi investigators said the three women were involved in a
lesbian relationship that deteriorated into a fight on the night
Ms. Gilford was killed. The women have denied those allegations in
several statements. The Saudis also say the two women were caught
using Ms. Gilford's credit cards to draw money from her bank
account after the murder.
<p>
   Both women deny all charges. They initially confessed but later
retracted the confessions, saying they were extracted under
pressure and sexual menacing by Saudi investigators.
<p>
   The controversy has galvanized British public opinion, fed by
daily front page reports and contradictory statements from Frank
Gilford, the victim's brother in Australia, his lawyers and the
lawyer for the two nurses. It has also led to harsh pronouncements
on the nature of Islamic justice and retorts of hypocrisy by
Britain's large Muslim minority.
<p>
   Big headlines in newspapers speak of more than a million dollars
in ``blood money'' that several companies doing business in Saudi
Arabia are willing to pay.
<p>
   Gilford, the brother, has denied reports that he accepted the
idea of compensation, but according to some reports, he has said he
may be considering some sort of settlement. His lawyers insist
there has been no deal.
<p>
   It is not clear whether the women would have to spend time in
jail anyway.

   ``99th Dream,'' Swervedriver's fourth CD, is easily one of the
best I've heard this year.
<p>
   Unfortunately, you can't hear it  &MD;  not unless you know someone
at Geffen Records who will slip you a copy.
<p>
   That's because Geffen decided not to release ``99th Dream,'' and
to drop the English band altogether  &MD;  a decision made AFTER the CD
was recorded and mastered and advance copies were mailed out to
journalists.
<p>
   If this strikes you as dumb and more than a bit bizarre, well,
yeah, it's both. It's also an example of record company politics
and the need for immediate profit being more important than working
with bands.
<p>
   Here's the deal: Swervedriver, a guitar-driven quartet, mixes a
swirly metallic roar with darkly alluring lyrics and an overall
sense that something vaguely sinister (but very sexy) is happening
just out of the frame.
<p>
   The band recorded two excellent CDs for A&AMP;M  &MD;  1991's ``Raise''
and 1993's ``Mezcal Head.'' They toured with Pearl Jam, Therapy?
and Soundgarden.
<p>
   But the CDs didn't sell  &MD;  this was before Oasis, remember, and
nothing new and English was selling at the time. A&AMP;M gave them
almost zero label push, which didn't help, and subsequently dropped
them.
<p>
   So the band recorded a third CD, ``Ejector Seat Reservation,''
for its English label, Creation, which had also put out its first
two CDs. But two weeks before ``Ejector'' came out in mid-1995, the
band was dropped by Creation.
<p>
   With almost no promotion, ``Ejector'' also failed to sell, even
though it, too, was a marvelous CD. In ``The Trouser Press Guide to
'90s Rock,'' alternative-music expert Ira A. Robbins called it
``one of the most quietly ambitious records of this decade.'' I'd
agree with that.
<p>
   The band signed with Geffen in the spring of '96. A woman named
Jody Kurilla was doing their A&AMP;R (artist &AMP; repertoire), which means
she was their main contact within the label, their champion, their
guide. Kurilla left in November 1996, just as ``Dream'' was being
finished. The band's manager Andy Allen says she was fired;
Geffen's Dennis Dennehy says she simply ``left the label.''
<p>
   Whatever. With Kurilla gone, and without a history of huge
success in the States, Swervedriver was dead in the water. Five
weeks before the CD was due to be released, the band was dropped
via a New York-to-London phone call.
<p>
   ``The consensus was they needed this person to guide them
through the system and with her gone the best thing to do was to
give the record back to them and let them try somewhere else,''
Dennehy says.
<p>
   Allen puts it differently, as you might imagine.
<p>
   ``The official line was, there wasn't enough belief in the label
in the band  &MD;  which is fair enough,'' he says. ``The fact is, they
agreed to put the record out and they didn't address that they
weren't into it until too far down the line. The band was p-----
o--  &MD;  they thought the label believed in them and they didn't.''
<p>
   Now bear in mind, nobody I've talked to at either A&AMP;M or Geffen
(and I've talked to several) has even hinted that Swervedriver is
getting what they deserve. No one has complained that they're hard
to deal with, or that they brought their CDs in late and over
budget.
<p>
   Nope, this band worked hard and put out consistently fine music,
only to wind up without a label. Three times.
<p>
   This isn't to say the people at Geffen are villains; they're
not. Other labels drop bands, too.
<p>
   But it is to say that Swervedriver is a better band than about
90 percent of those you'll see at a lot of venues. And if one of
the best bands of the '90s can't land and keep a deal, there's
something wrong with this business.
<p>
   The good news is, Allen is confident that the band will get an
American deal with one of two labels currently courting them. He
says ``99th Dream'' should be available by early next year.
<p>
   I hope so. They deserve it  &MD;  and every sale they get from here
on out.

 &UR; MICROBE SCARE TAKES TOLL &LR;   &UR; ON MID-ATLANTIC SEAFOOD INDUSTRY &LR;  &QL; 
(lh) &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL JANOFSKY &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  While scientists say a toxic microbe that has
killed millions of fish in Middle Atlantic waters this year poses
no threat to fish-eaters, state officials in Maryland and Virginia
say the outbreak is severely hurting their seafood industry.
<p>
   In Maryland, where seafood sales normally reach $400 million a
year, officials said Friday that wholesale and retail sales had
fallen as much as 75 percent in some areas and that seafood orders
in restaurants had declined by 30 percent.
<p>
   In Virginia, Bob Stolle, the state's deputy secretary of
commerce and trade, said sales of the seafood industry there,
typically $465 million a year, were down 33 to 50 percent.
<p>
   ``There's never been anything like this before,'' said Noreen
Eberly of the Maryland Agriculture Department's seafood marketing
program. ``People aren't eating Maryland seafood or seafood from
anywhere else, including orange roughy from New Zealand and salmon
from the Atlantic Ocean. People are just avoiding seafood at every
level.''
<p>
   Ms. Eberly estimated that at current levels of seafood
consumption in Maryland, the industry was losing $15 million to $20
million a month.
<p>
   The microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, which produces red lesions on
fish, was first identified as a cause of death among them in 1991,
after billions of menhadens died in North Carolina's Pamlico Sound.
<p>
   Studies have found that the microbe can cause skin irritations,
respiratory problems, memory loss and learning impairments in
humans who are exposed to infested waters. But scientists have
found no evidence that eating fish from the same waters causes
similar symptoms, and no evidence that the microbe has had much
effect on any species except menhaden, a fish harvested not for
eating but for the production of oil and fertilizer.
<p>
   Nonetheless, outbreaks this year in Maryland's Pocomoke River,
Chicamacomico River and King's Creek and in Virginia's Rappahannock
River sounded new alarms throughout the region. As scientists
rushed in to monitor waters all around the Chesapeake Bay, and as
Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland ordered the affected areas in
his state closed, consumers began changing their eating habits.
<p>
   By summer, several leading Maryland grocery chains had cleared
their shelves of fish caught in Maryland. Even sales of blue crabs,
a summertime favorite throughout the Middle Atlantic region, fell
by as much 50 percent.
<p>
   Suzie Robertson, who works for Evans Seafood in Shadyside, Md.,
south of Annapolis, said the business typically sold 1,000 pounds
of rockfish a week for $2 a pound this time of year.
<p>
   ``But now,'' she said, ``we've stopped fishing for them. No
one's buying.''
<p>
   Lee Wilson, a fisherman from Crisfield, Md., who sells wholesale
to markets in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, said, ``All of
a sudden, people are scared to death of any of it.''
<p>
   Glendening says the economic effect of the Pfiesteria outbreak
has resulted largely from a perception that all waters around the
Chesapeake Bay are contaminated. While the affected areas are
waterways at the southern end of the bay, fishermen plying rivers
and creeks 100 miles away and farther have encountered sluggish
markets for their catches.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   As a result, Glendening has mounted a highly visible public
relations campaign to offset what state officials and
environmentalists contend is a gross overreaction. In recent weeks,
he has invited reporters to cover him eating hearty seafood
lunches. Last week he invited governors from five nearby states to
discuss Pfiesteria issues in Annapolis. On Thursday, he asked a
House subcommittee for additional federal spending on Pfieseria
research and persuaded several chains of Maryland supermarkets to
resume their purchases of fish caught in state waters.
<p>
   And Friday Glendening said the state would add $500,000 to
seafood marketing programs that would otherwise have received only
$137,000 in state support for the current fiscal year.
<p>
   ``Most of the recovery should occur within a matter of weeks,''
the governor said in an interview, referring to an improvement in
seafood sales expected with consumers' usual shift to oysters and
crabs this time of year and the gradual cooling of bay waters,
which would force Pfiesteria into a dormant stage. But he added:
<p>
   ``It will not be back to 100 percent until we are totally
confident we have contained the Pfiesteria and started the process
of eliminating the causes. That could take another year or so.''

<p>
   ROME  &MD;  A court in Sicily convicted and sentenced Salvatore
Riina, the chieftain of the Sicilian Mafia, and 23 top lieutenants
to life sentences Friday for their role in the killing of Giovanni
Falcone, the prosecutor whose work and dramatic death in 1992 made
him the hero and martyr of Italy's war against organized crime.
<p>
   All but two of the 24 men sentenced Friday by the seven-judge
panel are already in jail, many serving multiple sentences for
other Mafia crimes.
<p>
   Riina, the ``boss of bosses'' who was the mastermind behind the
Sicilian Mafia's violent campaign against the Italian state, was
arrested in 1993 and is now in a maximum-security jail, serving 11
consecutive life sentences. Italy has no death penalty.
<p>
   The court in Caltanisetta gave more lenient sentences to six
other Mafiosi  &MD;  including Giovanni Brusca, a top boss arrested in
the last year  &MD;  who had collaborated with the state during the
Falcone case, and found another nine defendants not guilty.
<p>
   Of those convicted, only Bernardo Provenzano, a onetime member
of the Sicilian Mafia's top council, and another Mafioso, Benedetto
Spera, are still at large.
<p>
   Issuing the final sentences Friday after 25 days of
deliberation, the court brought to a close one of the most dramatic
and emotional cases against the Mafia.
<p>
   Falcone, highly respected for his persistent and sometimes
lonely investigations into the Mafia's secretive workings, was
killed in May 1992, together with his wife and three bodyguards, as
their car sped over a culvert packed with explosives on the highway
outside Sicily's regional capital, Palermo.
<p>
   His slaying, and the subsequent death by bombing of his top
associate Paolo Borsellino in July 1992, were part of a campaign
ordered by Riina to warn Italian authorities to ease the pressure
on criminal organizations. But the twin killings, and a subsequent
series of attacks against Italian artistic monuments in the summer
of 1993, only backfired against the Mafia, which became the object
of an all-out crackdown, with some notable results.
<p>
   ``The strategy of terror translated into a defeat for the Cosa
Nostra,'' Piero Luigi Vigna, the head of Italy's national
anti-Mafia unit in Rome, said Friday.
<p>
   In recent years, the Italian police, helped by Mafia turncoats,
have captured several top Mafia bosses, including Riina; Brusca,
identified as the man who pressed the button detonating the bombs
that killed Falcone; Benedetto Santapaola, the onetime boss of
eastern Sicily, and more recently Peitro Aglieri, another member of
top Mafia council, who was captured last June. All four were
sentenced Friday for their role in the Falcone case.
<p>
   In the two-and-a-half-year Falcone trial, the judges heard 269
witnesses, during 107 separate sessions, describing the cool
calculations that led into the murder of Falcone, a Sicilian-born
prosecuting magistrate who was able to penetrate the Mafia's closed
world as no other investigator had before.
<p>
   Anna Falcone, the prosecutor's sister, declared the court's
ruling a ``great triumph,'' although she was critical of the more
lenient sentence given against Brusca, whose collaboration with the
state continues to be regarded with suspicion by some
investigators.
<p>
   ``Certainly, if I think of the day of the funeral, we have made
some headway,'' she said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Giorgio Napolitano, Italy's interior minister, hailed the end of
the Falcone case, as a sign of Italy's renewed commitment against
organized crime.
<p>
   ``A conviction of those responsible for the assassination of
Giovanni Falcone, his wife, Francesca Morvillo, and his bodyguards
is a response that five years ago would have been impossible to
foresee,'' he said.
<p>
   While the Italian state has scored successes against the
Sicilian Mafia, and other organized crime clans in recent years,
criminality  &MD;  particularly in its petty forms, particularly in the
south of Italy  &MD;  has not shown any signs of abating. But in
attacking the heads of the organizations, the police and
prosecutors have been able to diminish their clout, both political
and social, and to expose their cold-blooded cruelty.
<p>
   Richard Martin, who worked closely with Falcone on Mafia cases
as a federal prosecutor in New York, said the sentences issued
Friday were the culmination of an ``extremely complicated case''
that proved the ``involvement of the heads of the Mafia in this
horrible homicide.''

`CHASING THE DREAM' IS LOW-BUCKS CHRONICLE OF BIG-BUCKS SPORT &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By ROBERT PHILPOT &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Jeff Fraley is an affable, engaging guy who seems like the
perfect partner for a morning bull session. He hardly seems the
type for a bull-riding session.
<p>
   But in ``Chasing the Dream,'' a documentary by Fraley and
partner Harry Lynch, Fraley gets onto the back of a bucking,
snorting bull. It was a natural, if somewhat frightening, choice
for a guy who was making a film about bull riding and wanted to
know more about his subject.
<p>
   Fraley looks pretty good for a novice, until he tells you that
he held on to the bull so long because he was afraid to get off.
And at 1,500 pounds, it was a small bull  &MD;  if there is such a
thing.
<p>
   ``A lot of the cowboys saw my bull and started laughing,''
Fraley says. ``They thought I was riding this overgrown pig. That
was one scary pig, though.''
<p>
   The ride wasn't the only thing scary about ``Chasing the
Dream.'' The $32,000 film is the Austin, Texas-based filmmakers'
first effort.
<p>
   ``We both wanted to get into film,'' says Fraley, who met Lynch
through mutual friends in 1992. ``I've always loved documentaries
and film in general, and Harry had been screenwriting for three
years, and we met and saw an avenue to do a film quickly.''
<p>
   Fraley, a part-time bartender and former schoolteacher whose
journalistic experience was limited to working for his college
paper, narrates the movie and did the interviewing. Lynch, a
philosophy major who later produced commercials for an Austin
agency, handled the camera work.
<p>
   During the nine months they worked on the film, they discovered
that making a documentary can be pretty overwhelming.
<p>
   ``We had 33 hours of footage, and then you've got to make a
story out of it,'' says Fraley, 28, a Fort Worth native. (Lynch,
31, is from Dallas.) ``It was quite frightening. For about a week,
we didn't even really talk to each other, because we didn't really
want to address it.''
<p>
   Faced with subjects known for being tight-lipped, Fraley got
bull riders to open up with his conversational interviewing, while
Lynch's unobtrusive camera work made them forget they were being
filmed. Still, needing a more compact running time, the filmmakers
had to come to a decision.
<p>
   ``We stopped thinking as directors and started thinking as an
audience,'' Fraley says, citing examples: ``What will people walk
away from, go grab a coffee, go to dinner, go home and tell their
friends  &MD;  what will they tell them about? What would an audience
want to see? And that was how we came up with what stories stayed
in and what stayed out.''
<p>
   The results play more like a feature film than a documentary,
with comedy, drama, action, poignancy and tragedy. And there are
stars: Joe Wimberly, Fraley's bull-riding instructor, acts as comic
relief with his witty teaching and amusing anecdotes. Don Gay, an
eight-time world-champion bull rider, is the cocky authority
figure. Tuff Hedeman, with his good looks and humility, is
reminiscent of George Strait. Ronny Kitchens figures in a
Rocky-style climax.
<p>
   ``They have TV personas,'' Fraley says. ``They're as savvy as
any journalist. They know what's going on. We were pleased with the
results we got, because we felt like they dropped their TV personas
to really answer the genuine questions about bull riding.''
<p>
   The riders aren't the only stars to emerge from the film. The
bulls  &MD;  including one 2,100-pound brute named Dodge Bodacious, who
does a number on Hedeman's face in the film's most brutal scene  &MD; 
turned out to be as compelling as the riders.
<p>
   ``These bulls really know what they're doing,'' Fraley says.
``You can pet them, you can feed them by hand in the pen. But when
the cowboy pulls up on his rope, getting ready to ride, they almost
flex. And they turn their heads in the chute, and they know exactly
what's going on, and a lot of them won't go after the cowboy when
they're down. They do get smarter. They learn moves. They know how
to get a guy going to one side.''
<p>
   They're also, in a way, politically correct.
<p>
   ``We actually tried to contact PETA and SPCA to get their
official comments. They called back and said, `Well, actually, we
don't have anybody in Texas who has any problem with bull riding.
Matter of fact, we don't have anybody across the nation who has any
problem with bull riding.' And we said, `That's interesting. What
was the reason?' And they said, `Well, they believe the bull
actually has more of a chance than the man.' ''
<p>
   If the odds in the bull-riding arena are against the rider, the
odds in the filmmaking arena were against Fraley and Lynch. The two
chose their subject not just because it was Texan, but because the
locations were convenient and cheap. (They financed most of the
movie themselves.)
<p>
   There was only one problem: Neither had made a film before.
<p>
   We did it 'cause we didn't know we couldn't,'' Fraley says. ``We
took anybody and everybody we could to lunch. Some directors down
in Austin, guys like George Ratliff and Fred Miller, who's an
Academy Award-winning documentarian, we'd take 'em to lunch and
halfway through, they'd figure out that we didn't know what we were
talking about. But we didn't pretend, and they would just kind of
embrace it and take us under their wing.''
<p>
   The results, it turns out, have been better than expected. The
film has screened twice at Austin's Dobie Theatre. It also won Best
Documentary (under 60 minutes) at the Great Plains Film Festival in
Nebraska, and received an award for outstanding achievement on
video from the Washington, D.C.-based CINE organization.
<p>
   More important for Fraley is that audiences like it, and that
Fraley and Lynch's off-screen efforts seem to play a role in that.
<p>
   ``It plays really well on the big screen,'' he says. ``People
stand up, they cheer. There's a real audience response in the
theater.''
<p>
   Fraley and Lynch hope that the audience response will continue
at upcoming screenings in New York and San Francisco. Eventually,
they hope to attract the attention of a premium cable channel such
as HBO or Cinemax.
<p>
   Fraley sees more visibility for documentaries, citing recent
examples such as ``Unzipped, Crumb'' and ``Hoop Dreams.'' Although
it doesn't share the urban feel, ``Chasing the Dream'' has some
similarities with ``Hoop Dreams'' as it deflates stereotypes, tells
the stories behind the athletes, and encourages people to reach for
their goals, whatever they may be.
<p>
   ``There's that `dream' thing again,'' Fraley says, noting
another similarity. ``Ours is like `Hoof Dreams,' I think.''

<p>
   Friends at home, foes at work. This conundrum clearly fascinated
the screenwriters who cooked up the idea of having Tracy and
Hepburn battle it out as rival lawyers in ``Adam's Rib.'' But
thousands of professionals also confront it in real life,
particularly as more women move forward in their careers.
<p>
   But what really happens to a marriage, and the jobs involved,
when she's a takeover specialist and he's on the trading floor  &MD; 
and they can't unwind in the evening and tell each other all about
their day? Or suppose he's a litigator who daily battles someone
from her firm, or they're both real estate brokers or literary
agents, intent on landing the same hot property. How do they handle
it?
<p>
   It all seems to depend on the personalities involved, and what
rules are agreed on to prevent the business world from trampling
too heavily over the hearth  &MD;  and vice versa.
<p>
   Some people cite mutual trust as a cure-all; others simply agree
not to talk about work. Still others figure out a way to talk
without giving away too much detail. Then there's the James
Carville-Mary Matalin approach: when they were in rival camps in
the 1992 election, they spent as much time as possible bickering in
public.
<p>
   And, of course, corporate paranoia sometimes intrudes, with
suspicions of problems where there may not be any. While companies
used to worry about nepotism, now their concerns are more complex.
<p>
   Lawyers who are spouses often find themselves in opposing camps,
a situation they seem able to iron out by removing themselves.
<p>
   Deirdre Daly, a former assistant United States attorney in White
Plains, N.Y., could have found herself prosecuting cases in which
lawyers from her husband's firm, Gage &AMP; Pavlis, represented the
defendants.
<p>
   ``We would cut it off at the pass,'' Ms. Daly said. ``If a
client called him and said, `I've just received a subpoena,' my
husband would call me and say, `Do you know anything about X case?'
If it was my case, they would just decline working for that
client.''
<p>
   Her husband, Alfred U. Pavlis, was involved in one case that
would have posed a conflict before she joined the White Plains
office, so she simply asked that someone else supervise it. ``We'd
sort of draw lines around it,'' she said, ``so that I didn't really
know anything he wanted to know.''
<p>
   This pattern continued for five years, until Ms. Daly resigned
to join Gage &AMP; Pavlis herself about three months ago.
<p>
   Had there been any friction? He was disappointed, at times, that
he couldn't take a case, Ms. Daly said. ``But it's just the reality
of life  &MD;  the marriage first, and also the professional
responsibilities.''
<p>
   Marriages between competitors happen often in journalism, which
can be taken as a sign of either desperation (the business does
demand long hours) or like-mindedness. And when journalists marry
journalists from competing news organizations, delicate maneuvering
is required  &MD;  especially if, say, both are assigned to the same
overseas post.
<p>
   Consider Michael Wines of The New York Times and Sharon
LaFraniere of The Washington Post, who will be Moscow
correspondents starting in June.
<p>
   ``There's an expectation that in situations where competition is
an issue, people will figure out their own boundaries,'' said
William E. Schmidt, associate managing editor of The Times.
<p>
   But journalists who marry outside the business can also find
themselves clashing professionally with their spouses. Consider
what happened to Robert B. Barnett, a former personal lawyer to the
Clintons who is married to Rita Braver, a CBS News reporter.
<p>
   When she was assigned to cover the White House in 1993, he
withdrew as the Clintons' lawyer to avoid a conflict of interest.
(That gnashing sound you heard might have come from some corner
office at CBS.)
<p>
   And earlier this month, The Times decided that Bernard Weinraub,
a cultural correspondent based in Los Angeles, would no longer
write certain articles about the business side of the movie
industry  &MD;  or any articles about Columbia Pictures or its
competitive standing in Hollywood. In August, Weinraub married Amy
Pascal, the president of Columbia.
<p>
   ``It will avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest,
which he and his editors have been sensitive to all along,'' the
culture editor, John Darnton, wrote in a staff memo.
<p>
   Some professions have rules about such situations. Even so,
couples may find themselves stretching those rules a bit  &MD;  or a
lot.
<p>
   Accountants, for example, must square their personal lives with
their professional obligations, ``to not only insure independence
in fact but also in appearance,'' said Howard Schilit, president of
the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a research firm in
Bethesda, Md. Should an auditor decline the Pepsi assignment if his
wife is auditing Coke? Probably, Schilit said. ``It could create
certain uncomfortable situations.''

<p>
   The codes of conduct of the American Bar Association, meanwhile,
prevent both judges and lawyers from taking part in cases in which
relatives or spouses are involved. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's ethical guidelines urge purchasers to
refrain from any activity ``that would create a conflict between
personal interests and the interests of the employer.''
<p>
   And an investment banker with knowledge of an impending takeover
had better not tell her husband who works on the trading floor  &MD;  or
the SEC could come down like a ton of bricks with an
insider-trading charge.
<p>
   Companies seem to avoid addressing the issue directly. ``We
spend a lot of time emphasizing to people the importance of
protecting the intellectual property at Texas Instruments,'' said
Carl Skooglund, the company's ethics director. ``We recognize that
people are going to get to know each other, fall in love and get
married, and you've got to have the workplace, to as reasonable a
degree as possible, accommodate that.''
<p>
   When it comes to handling competition, Al Roker, the weatherman
for ``The Today Show'' on NBC, has chosen the free-speech path. He
routinely discusses what's going on at the office with his wife,
Deborah Roberts, a correspondent on ``20/20'' at ABC.
<p>
   Roker said: ``I am always kind of curious about people who say
they can't talk about it, because if you trust the other person,
and you each agree you're not going to tell anyone else, what's the
problem? There are times that Deborah has said, `Barbara Walters
has a big interview with this one or that one,' and it never occurs
to me to mention it to anyone. If we have somebody coming on `The
Today Show,' I would tell her and she would never divulge that. We
know what's happening at each person's shop.''
<p>
   Ms. Roberts said she has detected the occasional eyebrow arched
in her direction during closed-door meetings. And occasionally, she
said, colleagues jokingly poke around. ``They will say, `Do you
know if this big political person or this news maker is doing an
interview with NBC?' '' she said. ``I would never think about
telling anybody.''
<p>
   Donna and Ted Simonides, who have worked not only for competing
companies but also on competing software products  &MD;  he at Software
Publishing, she at Microsoft  &MD;  say the real difficulties came when
their companies joined forces on one project, so they could talk
about that project but not others.
<p>
   ``I finally just took myself out of the discussions because it
was such a gray area,'' said Ms. Simonides, now an executive at
Netscape Communications.
<p>
   They both recognized the need for silence on certain subjects.
``You always have vagueness about why you're traveling, but being
in the same boat, we just understood it was an off-limits place to
go,'' Ms. Simonides said.
<p>
   Then there are the papers each brings home. ``We respect each
other's privacy,'' Simonides said. ``If she leaves a stack of
papers out, I'm not going to grab it and start poking through it.''
<p>
   In the end, what they really wanted to talk about didn't
compromise anything. ``What you want to vent about at night is
typically how you interacted with other employees, and the politics
of the place,'' Simonides said. ``That kind of stuff is never
confidential.''
<p>
   He is now a consultant, which could bring him into competition
with his wife all over again, though so far he has steered clear of
Microsoft, Netscape's rival.
<p>
   Another couple, then just dating but now engaged, worked for
competing telephone companies  &MD;  she for AT&AMP;T, he for Pacific Bell,
both in local telecommunications and selling to the same market.
Now working for competing advertising agencies, they spoke on
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   But the problems they encountered came not from each other, but
from her superiors at AT&AMP;T, who insisted that she talk with senior
managers about the arrangement  &MD;  even though she had signed a
confidentiality agreement.
<p>
   ``It made you think, `Gosh, they don't trust either of us,' ''
the man said. ``If they have those suspicions, it makes you wonder
what (italics)they(end italics) might be up to.'' Neither talked
about work, and they enjoyed that immensely, he said. ``We both
trusted each other, that we weren't going through each other's
files.''
<p>
   At AT&AMP;T, though, even marriages between co-workers are frowned
upon, according to a spokesman, unless the people involved are of
equal rank. So just imagine how chilly the corporate reception gets
when someone is married to a competitor.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T has no formal rules on such matters, though. ``It certainly
would be awkward to be sleeping with the enemy,'' said Burke
Stinson, the company spokesman. ``But in a company with as many
interests as we have, it's easy to see how you could date or be
married to someone in a business related to or competing with
AT&AMP;T.''
<p>
   Sometimes not being able to talk about one's work has to do with
professional obligation, not competition. Dr. Jonathan Lampert,
director of clinical affairs at the Ackerman Institute for the
Family in New York, told of a couple in which the husband was a
psychoanalyst with some high-profile patients, and the wife was in
the arts.
<p>
   One day, she happened to see a celebrity coming out of his
office, which was in their home, and she asked him, ``Well, what
was (italics)that(end italics) like?'' He couldn't, and wouldn't,
tell her anything, leading to a period of intense struggle in their
marriage, Lampert said.

   ``There's a certain reality of relational life that there are
always things between couples that can't be shared,'' he said.
``This doesn't mean you can't have a wonderful, intimate
relationship as well.''
<p>
   The ``Adam's Rib'' caricature, the 1949 film in which Hollywood
confections played by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy represent
opposite sides in court, probably would not happen in real life,
lawyers married to other lawyers say. ``We have tried, so far
successfully, not to be personally involved in matters where our
firms are adverse,'' says David Nachman, a litigator in Manhattan
with Solomon, Zauder, Ellenhorn, Frischer &AMP; Sharp, which handles
cases involving securities deals and white-collar crime. ``It's
very rare that you'll see Hepburn and Tracy.''
<p>
   His wife, Amy Schulman, a lawyer with Piper &AMP; Marbury, a firm
that on more than one occasion has opposed Nachman's firm in
corporate litigation, says the situation hasn't been awkward for
her  &MD;  only for other people in her office. ``Why would they kibitz
freely with me when my husband was on the other side of the case?''
<p>
   Nachman, however, hasn't necessarily held back his own opinions
at home. ``I might say, `Your colleague so-and-so called me the
other day and made the most ridiculous argument,' '' he
acknowledged. But they draw the line at discussing particulars of
continuing cases.
<p>
   Perhaps the most extreme example of intramarital competition was
lived out by Thomas and Melinda Wilde of Portland, Ore., whose
effort to campaign together so she could win election to a state
Senate seat was torn asunder when he decided he would make a better
candidate and ran for the same seat on a different platform.
<p>
   While she was knocked out in the Republican primary, he won the
Democratic one by default (his opponent died suddenly on the golf
course) and went on to win the election.
<p>
   ``I'm very pleased we didn't end up facing each other because
things were already so tense and so personal that I don't think we
could have handled it,'' Wilde said. ``I think we would have killed
each other.'' After one candidates' forum at which she was more
tentative than he was, ``Melinda screamed at me the entire way
home,'' he said. ``She thought I looked like a stupid idiot.''
<p>
   Mrs. Wilde, however, remembers it differently. ``I was upset
with him because when he filed against me, it made both of our
candidacies look like a joke,'' she said. ``I just thought he blew
any chance I did have.''
<p>
   Once they became competitors, each tried to conceal campaign
plans, with varying success. ``He tried to keep his strategy to
himself, but I kept digging it out,'' she said. ``He couldn't help
but talk about it.''
<p>
   They squabbled about who would watch their son, then 2 years
old, when they were both campaigning in the old-fashioned,
door-to-door style that wins elections in Portland.
<p>
   ``He was telling me I had to baby-sit, and I said he had to
baby-sit. Most of these houses had big porches, and I never knew
whether to leave our son at the bottom of the steps or drag his
stroller up with me.'' And showing up with a toddler in tow didn't
play well with some of the fustier voters. ``Some of them said,
`Finish being a mom and come back and see me later,' '' she said.
<p>
   Now, with him in the state senate and her back at her old job,
as a developer and a lawyer specializing in real estate, they talk
about work even less.
<p>
   ``When he became a public official, I didn't want him using my
cases as examples and accidentally destroying a confidence,'' she
said. ``So now I don't tell him anything about what I do. Which I
think is fine with him.''
<p>
   Other couples in not-quite-so-direct competition say they talk,
but cautiously.
<p>
   ``One has to be careful about how much one says on the pillow,''
said an art dealer whose wife works in the same field. When they
travel, the two take separate hotel rooms, so they can keep
telephone calls private. And when they arrive at parties filled
with art buyers, they head in opposite directions.
<p>
   Still, in the small circles of the art world, the couple  &MD;  who
insisted on anonymity  &MD;  have found themselves trying to bring home
the same Bacon or Mondrian or whatever.
<p>
   Someone has to win, which means someone else loses. And then
what? ``The understanding sets in a few days after the fact, as the
remorse and bitterness, anger and hostility recede,'' he said.
<p>
   For some couples, being competitors may actually be an
improvement over being on the same team. Roker met his wife when
both were at NBC, and while he used to enjoy being able to see her
around the building, they have discovered benefits in being
employed by different networks.
<p>
   ``We've got two completely different groups of people we can
dish,'' he said. ``And that works pretty well.''

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  A leading British stock index recorded its biggest
one-day gain Friday, and other markets reacted sharply after a
report that the British government was considering joining the
European single-currency union shortly after its planned
introduction in 1999.
<p>
   The report, which appeared in Friday's Financial Times, cited an
unidentified government minister who said that senior members of
the Cabinet were discussing Britain's participation in the European
Monetary Union some time after 1999 but before the next scheduled
general election in 2003.
<p>
   The markets interpreted the article as an acceleration of the
timetable frequently mentioned by Prime Minister Tony Blair for
participation in the proposed single currency. Blair has said that
it is highly unlikely that Britain will consider joining the
monetary union when it is scheduled to begin in 1999, and that
Britain would not join until after a public referendum.
<p>
   A spokesman for the Treasury said, ``All we are saying about
this report is that it is pure speculation.'' Other spokesmen said
nothing had changed in the government's position
<p>
   Still, many analysts and bankers said the report confirmed what
they had sensed for months  &MD;  a small but definite change of
attitude by the Labor government about monetary union. The new
government is warming to the plan, they say. The previous Tory
government wavered between utter hostility and lukewarm enthusiasm
about abolishing the British currency in favor of the euro, which
would be the name of the new European currency.
<p>
   ``We are very confident that this government will bring the
United Kingdom into EMU sometime after it is launched,'' said Bruce
Kasman, chief economist of J.P. Morgan here in a telephone
interview, echoing a widespread sentiment in London's investment
community.
<p>
   London's benchmark blue-chip stock barometer, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, soared past 5,100 points for
the first time, then plowed through the 5,200-point mark. The index
hit an intraday high of 5,244.3, up 178.8 points, or 3.4 percent,
before drifting slightly lower in midafternoon. It closed at
5,226.3, up 160.8 points or a rise of 3.17 percent.
<p>
   In currency markets, the pound, which has been the strong
currency of Europe mostly because of Britain's ``wait-and-see''
attitude toward the euro, weakened against the German mark. The
pound tumbled to a low of 2.8150 marks in early trading, bouncing
back a bit after the government labeled the report as speculation.
<p>
   Bond yields touched four-year lows in anticipation of lower
British interest rates as well.
<p>
   A lower pound is great news for businesses here. ``That would
greatly help British exports, which have suffered from the high
value of the pound,'' said Gunther Phunmann, a Salomon Brothers
analyst in London in a phone interview.
<p>
   Analysts said the possibility of Britain joining the monetary
union suggested several other positive developments for the
economy, which has been one of the strongest in Europe. For one
thing, it means short-term British interest rates, which now hover
around 7 percent will have to get in line with those in the rest of
Europe, which are in the area of 3 percent.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   ``That would add 15 percent to 20 percent more value'' to bonds,
said Gary Dugan, European equity markets strategist for J.P.
Morgan.
<p>
   Dugan also noted that moving closer to a single currency would
force Britain to deal with its higher inflation level, which hovers
around 3.5 percent while the rest of Europe has an inflation level
closer to 2 percent.
<p>
   ``This is a bullish development for U.K. assets in general,''
said Richard Kersley, head of European strategy for BZW, the
investment firm.
<p>
   Since the Labor Party's defeat of the Conservatives last May, a
substantial part of the business community here has become
convinced that Britain was moving closer to Europe. The hard-line
minority in the former Tory government that had opposed such a move
has receded into insignificance. Both the Labor Party and its ally,
the Liberal Democratic Party, favor a much closer relationship with
Europe, contending that that is the way for Britain to play a
leading role in shaping the policies of the continent.
<p>
   The Labor Party is holding its conference starting on Monday at
Brighton, and while no big changes in policy are expected, the
financial markets will be listening carefully to any pronouncements
from Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, about monetary
union. Brown has long advocated that Britain join in the single
currency.

<p>
   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- ITT Corp. said a Dutch
publishing company offered in April to buy its telephone directory
business for as much as $2.2 billion in cash, though the two
companies couldn't come to an agreement on the terms.
<p>
   The tax structure sought by VNU NV, the third-largest Dutch
publisher, was impossible to accomplish and wasn't acceptable, said
ITT spokesman Jim Gallagher. He said VNU's ``expression of
interest'' wasn't a formal offer.
<p>
   Hilton Hotels Corp., however, which has been trying to buy ITT
since January, said ITT didn't want to sell the directories
business because it was key to its plans to separate into three
companies and keep Hilton at bay, according to a court document it
filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
   ITT and Hilton will go before a judge Monday, who will rule on
whether the New York-based company can spin off its hotel and
casino operations into one company and its technical schools into
another. The remaining company, to go by the name ITT Corp., would
be the telephone directories business.
<p>
   Burbank, California-based Hilton is asking the judge to block
ITT's plans, saying shareholders should be allowed to vote on the
break-up and its offer of $11.5 billion, or $70 a share.
<p>
   ITT's World Directories is one of the largest international
publishers of telephone books. It publishes in countries including
the Netherlands and Belgium and had revenue of about $647 million
last year.
<p>
   The potential sale of the directories unit could become an issue
at the trial in Las Vegas, analysts and investors said.
<p>
   ``If (ITT) can prove that the tax liabilities on the sale would
be substantial and would diminish the economics of the sale, then
they're probably on solid legal footing to reject the deal,'' said
Steven Pinsk, an at Credit Suisse First Boston.
<p>
   Officials with VNU didn't return calls seeking comment.
<p>
   Hilton's filing is based on information its lawyers gathered
during the discovery process for the ITT suit, including
depositions of ITT executives. The information was unsealed by the
federal court in Las Vegas this afternoon.
<p>
   Hilton described the offer from VNU in the filing to support its
contention that ITT executives are breaking up the company mainly
to thwart Hilton's offer and preserve their jobs.
<p>
   ``The information just further proves that entrenched management
and avoiding shareholders is always what this has been about for
ITT,'' said Hilton spokesman Marc Grossman.
<p>
   ITT says its plan to split up is a logical step in its evolution
as a company and to improve the value of its shares. The shares are
up 45 percent so far this year.
<p>
   The filing also says Chairman Rand Araskog secured in February a
so-called golden parachute agreement that would pay him at least
$19.8 million if ITT is taken over. That payment and others would
give Araskog at least $54.9 million if the company's ownership
changes, the filing said.
<p>
   ITT's other employees would get $110 million in payments, an
amount the filing quoted Araskog as calling ``a lot of money.''
<p>
   ``All I can say is wow. So much for making money the
old-fashioned way,'' said Eric Longmire, senior managing director
of research for Wyser-Pratte &AMP; Co., which owns 600,000 ITT shares.
<p>
   In its SEC filing, Hilton said VNU submitted a letter to ITT on
April 23 expressing its interest in buying World Directories for $2
billion to $2.2 billion. The letter also said VNU would willing to
pay more after completing due diligence.
<p>
   ITT's advisers gave preliminary advice that ``a deal in the
range proposed by VNU probably makes sense,'' Hilton said in the
filing.
<p>
   ITT executives didn't permit due diligence by VNU because of
``fears that VNU would misuse that process to gather corporate
intelligence,'' the filing says.
<p>
   Hilton said a May 29 document from Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., one of
ITT's financial advisers, suggests ITT had another motive. The
document states that selling the unit meant it wouldn't ``be
available to serve as the `surviving' company in a spinoff of
Sheraton,'' the filing says.
<p>
   ITT's Gallagher said ITT didn't pursue a transaction with VNU
because it found a more acceptable solution for its tax concerns
with its plan to split up.
<p>
   Hilton's filing says ITT in late April began receiving
indications of interest from potential buyers, including VNU.
<p>
   After a split by ITT in 1995, ITT identified the telephone
directory unit as a ``non strategic'' asset that could be sold,
Gallagher said.
<p>
   When ITT announced plans July 16 to separate into three
companies, it bought back the 20 percent of the directories company
owned by BellSouth Corp. for $254 million.
<p>
   ITT also agreed to sell a third of the publisher to investment
firm Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice for $225 million after the split and
warrants to buy an additional 13.7 percent of the business.

<p>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.  &MD;  Because he believes the Jets' special teams
are on the verge of breaking out, of becoming a successful unit
earlier than he had hoped, Coach Bill Parcells is once again going
to deactivate the flashy rookie punt returner Dedric Ward, and
replace him with the almost-forgotten Alex Van Dyke.
<p>
   So when the Jets' kick- and punt-coverage teams line up at
Cincinnati on Sunday, Van Dyke will be there trying to chase the
Bengals' kick returners.
<p>
   Van Dyke didn't even put on a uniform for the Jets' first three
games, even though he was the club's second-round draft choice last
year, following a brilliant receiving career at Nevada.
<p>
   And Ward, who had seemed like an instant starter over the summer
but who made mistakes in judgment returning some kicks, will not
even dress for the Bengals. This is the second straight week Ward
has been demoted and Van Dyke promoted.
<p>
   Parcells explains that he likes Van Dyke's ability to run down
players. He is also 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. If Ward
isn't returning kicks and punts, then his 5-9, 180-pound frame
isn't as valuable in trying to tackle people.
<p>
   Parcells seems more worried about giving up a big play on
special teams than he is of not making one. So last Sunday he
brought back Van Dyke to chase the Raiders' dangerous Desmond
Howard. The last time Parcells saw Howard was in the Super Bowl,
where Howard returned a kickoff for a crushing touchdown against
the Patriots. Howard was contained against the Jets, with Van Dyke
among those who surrounded him.
<p>
   Parcells has also discovered a punt returner in the rookie Leon
Johnson, whose 11.8-yard average is almost 3 yards better than
Ward's. And kickoff returns are being handled by cornerback Aaron
Glenn, whose average of 31.4 yards a return is among the league's
best.
<p>
   The special teams coach, Mike Sweatman, has been trying to find
a nucleus of players to create an aggregate character for his unit.
Last year's special teams on the Jets had anything but. They were
probably the league's poorest unit overall as players were shuttled
in and out to try to help the staggering offense and defense.
<p>
   Yet, this year it isn't the offense and its noted
multimillion-dollar performers, and it isn't the defense with its
array of wealthy linebackers that is about to break out, Parcells
said.
<p>
   ``This second month I'd like to get in a position where we can
dominate,'' he said Friday of his special teams.
<p>
   Although Parcells has always believed special teams need a core
of experienced performers, he is getting a good feeling for his
current unit, a collection of mostly young, limited-experienced
performers. The Jets are fresh from a 23-22 victory positioned by
special teams; the blocked field goal by Corwin Brown against the
Raiders lead to Ray Mickens' decisive touchdown.
<p>
   On Sunday, they will face the Bengals' Eric Bieniemy and David
Dunn on kickoffs and Greg Myers on punts. The Bengals' Corey Dillon
has been one of the league's leading returners, averaging more than
30 yards, but because he will start at running back instead of the
injured Ki-Jana Carter, he will give up his return duties.

<p>
   EXTRA POINTS
<p>
   Siupeli Malamala, a solid run blocker, will replace David
Williams at right tackle. Williams has a sprained foot. ... ``I
don't think Jeff Blake has a thing to prove because he was third
string in New York,'' Bengals Coach Bruce Coslet said about his
starting quarterback. ``The stupid coach wouldn't put him in
there,'' he said. The Jets' coach in 1993 happened to be Coslet.
... National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote
Corwin Brown that he had nominated him to be the American
Conference's special teams player of the week. Tagliabue said that
he went to the Jets-Raiders game at the Meadowlands, where Brown
caught a fourth-down pass off a faked punt, and also blocked a
field-goal attempt that was returned for the winning touchdown. ...
The Jets have shut out the opposition in the second half in two
games. ... Bengals running back Ki-Jana Carter, who was listed as
doubtful with a rotator-cuff injury for Sunday's game, will not
play against the Jets. ... Coach Bill Parcells says the Bengals
``will be a good game for us. I'm more interested in how we're
going to do than the other games we played. I'm interested in how
we're going to view the opponent.'' He pointed out that the Jets
are coming off a victory, while the Bengals, at 1-2, are under
pressure, since two of their division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens
and the Jacksonville Jaguars, already have 3 victories.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Arthur A. Rutledge, who arrived in Hawaii as a young
stowaway from Seattle in 1934 and stayed to become one of Hawaii's
most powerful union leaders ever, died on Monday at Kaiser Medical
Center in Honolulu. He was 90 and lived in Honolulu.
<p>
   The cause of death was heart failure, said James Walter, a
family friend and the executive director of Unity House, a
nonprofit charity founded by Rutledge's unions.
<p>
   In a region with little experience with organized labor,
Rutledge brought determination and humor to union organizing.
<p>
   He was arrested many times in the course of at least 200 strikes
and work stoppages, and the federal authorities unsuccessfully
tried to deport him after questions were raised about his
citizenship. The U.S. Senate investigated his relationship with
Jimmy Hoffa and the teamsters' union, but no charges were ever
filed. He was also tried on charges of attempted murder but was
acquitted when a witness recanted his testimony.
<p>
   In the 1970s, Rutledge opened his own small hotel, the Waikiki
Marina, having led strikes against some of Hawaii's biggest hotels.
He would lead campaigns to improve his workers' productivity and
then feign irritation by muttering, ``union labor.''
<p>
   Starting by organizing bartenders on Skid Row in the 1930s,
Rutledge became one of the major figures in the Hawaiian labor
movement by bringing together workers in the nascent hotel business
with workers in the dairy, transit, and trucking industries as part
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He headed both the
Hawaii locals of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees and
the teamsters, and his influence blossomed as tourism boomed in the
years after World War II.
<p>
   Richard R. Kelley, chairman of Outrigger Enterprises, Hawaii's
largest hotel chain, which was struck several times by Rutledge's
unions, said he remembered seeing a photograph of his father, Roy
Kelley, in Rutledge's office. ``They were like two generals who
fought across a river, and after the war they became friends,''
Kelley said. When the federal government tried to deport Rutledge
in the early 1950's, Roy Kelley testified in Rutledge's behalf.
<p>
   Arthur Abraham Rutledge was born Avrom Rotlieder on Jan. 2,
1907, in Lublin, Poland. He came to the United States with his
mother when he was 6, and his name was Anglicized by immigration
authorities.
<p>
   He held a series of odd jobs, and in 1934, when he was 27, he
noticed a painting in a Seattle bar of what he called ``pretty
girls on a South Sea island'' and impulsively stowed away on a ship
to Hawaii. He was returned to Seattle after it was discovered that
he had not paid a large fine for bootlegging but then settled in
Hawaii in 1938.
<p>
   Rutledge cared passionately about civil rights, Walter said.
When federal officials in World War II refused to seat on the local
labor board Jack Kawano, an official with the longshoremen's union
who was of Japanese descent, Rutledge acted. He calmly informed
them that his union controlled most of the territory's
transportation, and said: ``If you don't seat Jack, you don't seat
me.'' Kawano was placed on the board.
<p>
   Rutledge is survived by his three children, Anna, Anthony, and
Arthur Jr.; a younger brother, Maurice, of Los Angeles; eight
grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  The shuttle Atlantis on Friday sped toward a
rendezvous with Russia's Mir space station, where American Mike
Foale awaits arrival of his replacement, astronaut David Wolf.
<p>
   The spacecraft are scheduled to link up shortly before 4 p.m.
EDT Saturday, as they race in formation more than 240 miles above
the Earth.
<p>
   Though U.S. and Russians officials reported that the spaceships
were prepared for the delicate task of docking, they refined
procedures to deal with any last-minute problem that might crop up
with Mir's troubled guidance system computer.
<p>
   Earlier this week, the computer faltered for a third time in as
many weeks. Each time, the failure sends the orbital outpost
temporarily rolling slowly out of control. Power generation is
disrupted until the control can be restored.
<p>
   Ground controllers in Houston and in suburban Moscow agreed
Friday that the linkup  &MD;  NASA's seventh with Mir  &MD;  could proceed if
the device faltered with the shuttle within 30 feet. If the
computer were to break down at a greater distance, the Atlantis
crew would likely back away until the device could be fixed.
<p>
   ``We're on our way to Mir,'' gushed shuttle commander James
Wetherbee as the separation between the spaceships dwindled to less
than 2,000 miles late Friday.
<p>
   Wetherbee seemed at least as eager for the orbital linkup as
Foale or Wolf, whose participation in the flight did not clear
final NASA safety assessments until a few hours before Thursday
night's liftoff.
<p>
   In February 1995, Wetherbee steered the shuttle Discovery to
within 30 feet of Mir without docking as part of an elaborate dress
rehearsal for the first linkup four months later.
<p>
   ``Rendezvous are all pretty much the same when you really get
down to it,'' Wetherbee said shortly before liftoff. ``The thing
I'm looking forward to is the last 30 feet.''
<p>
   His six-member crew of Russian and French cosmonauts and U.S.
astronauts worked Friday to keep the linkup on schedule. They
positioned the shuttle's docking mechanism and tested the
navigational aids that will be required to bring the two spacecraft
together.
<p>
   And in an interview with National Public Radio, Wolf was asked
if he was concerned for his safety as he prepares to board Mir. The
station was rocked by a near-disastrous orbital collision three
months ago and has suffered a succession of life support system
problems as well as the computer breakdowns.
<p>
   ``I'm concerned as I would be on any spacecraft,'' said Wolf, a
41-year-old physician. ``But Mir is in excellent condition to my
mind. I'm looking forward to being over there.''
<p>
   He and Foale plan to swap places Sunday.
<p>
   Atlantis will be able to remain docked with Mir until Friday,
allowing an 8,000-pound cargo exchange and a spacewalk by shuttle
crewmen Scott Parazynski and Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov.
<p>
   The shuttle carries a new Russian guidance computer for Mir,
nine large storage batteries to improve the station's power deficit
and water.
<p>
   During their spacewalk, Parazynski and Titov will strap a
circular sealing device about the size of a manhole cover on the
outside of Mir.
<p>
   The Russians plan to retrieve the cover on a future spacewalk
and use it to seal the tear in the station's Spektr science module,
which bore the brunt of the station's June 25 collision with a
careening Progress cargo capsule.

 &UR; BOSNIAN SERB IS SENTENCED TO LIFE TERM FOR GENOCIDE &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   BONN, Germany  &MD;  A German court convicted a Bosnian Serb of
genocide and other charges Friday in the killing of Muslims during
the war in Bosnia, and sentenced him to life in prison.
<p>
   The Serb, Nikola Jorgic, had been tried in Dusseldorf on 11
counts of genocide and 30 of murder as well as lesser charges.
German justice authorities had agreed to try the case because the
United Nations war crimes tribunal for the Balkans in The Hague was
overburdened and because Jorgic was arrested in Germany.
<p>
   ``Whoever hoped that events like the Nazi genocide of the Jews
could never be repeated is bitterly disappointed after the events
in the former Yugoslavia,'' Judge Gunter Krentz said as he passed
the life sentence demanded by the prosecution.
<p>
   The decision coincided with a growing clamor for the
30,000-member NATO-dominated force in Bosnia, which includes a
German contingent, to take tougher action against others suspected
of war crimes, notably Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political
leader.
<p>
   In Sarajevo Friday, Louise Arbour, a United Nations war crimes
prosecutor, said it was ``scandalous'' that Karadzic was still
free.
<p>
   Jorgic, 51, remained impassive as the conviction and sentence
were announced. After his arrest in Germany in 1995, he repeatedly
insisted that he was an innocent victim of mistaken identity. A
defense lawyer challenged the court's right to try a non-German
accused of crimes far beyond Germany's frontiers involving no
German citizens.
<p>
   Some justice officials said the genocide sentence was the first
in Germany since the International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg
after World War II tried many Nazi leaders.
<p>
   In the postwar period, German courts were responsible for trying
German war-crimes suspects. But many judges were holdovers from the
Nazi era, and there were widespread complaints that cases were
pursued without vigor or enthusiasm.
<p>
   Jorgic's trial was the second in Germany against a suspect from
the Bosnian war. Last May, a court in Munich jailed Novislav Djajic
for five years on charges of being an accessory to murder.
<p>
   Like Jorgic, Djajic was arrested in Germany, which is home to
some 320,000 Bosnian war refugees and to tens of thousands of
foreign workers from the Balkans.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Prosecutors, who called more than 30 witnesses, said Jorgic had
worked as a locksmith in Germany from 1969 until 1992, when he
returned to Bosnia at the start of the war there to lead a group of
nationalist Bosnian Serbs who sought to create an ethnically pure
Greater Serbia.
<p>
   Despite Jorgic's claim to have spent much of 1992 in prison in
Bosnia, prosecutors said he took part in a series of killings,
including a massacre of 22 Muslims in June 1992 in the village of
Grapska, when he was said to have fired an automatic weapon into a
group of unarmed Muslims.
<p>
   He was also convicted of ordering that seven Muslims in the
village of Sevartlije be executed later that same summer. In
September 1992, the prosecution said, Jorgic killed a Muslim
captive by placing the prisoner's head in a metal bucket, then
beating on it with a piece of wood.
<p>
   Jorgic returned to Germany and lived in the town of Bochum until
his arrest three years later, the prosecution said.

GRUESOME TWOSOMES ARE WHAT'S AILING R&AMP;B &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By DAVE FERMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   There's a disease in modern R&AMP;B these days. And if it's not
killing the music, it's certainly smoothing it into more
homogenized, easily dismissable fluff.
<p>
   I'll call it duetitis: that overwhelming tendency to pair up
anybody and everybody with, well, ``anybody and everybody else.''
<p>
   Mariah Carey and Bone thugs-n-harmony?
<p>
   SWV and on their new CD, it appears, half the people in the New
York phone book?
<p>
   Excuse me, but what were you people thinking?
<p>
   Now, there's nothing wrong with a good, soulful duet that pairs
strong individual performers on a strong song. Think back to Otis
Redding and Carla Thomas. Or Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. Or Ray
Charles and Betty Carter.
<p>
   The music these people made together was rarely less than
wonderful, and sometimes sheer magic: Individual styles and good
material blended to produce something that neither artist could
have managed alone.
<p>
   But now all has changed. Thanks to the massive success last year
of such pairings as R. Kelly and Ronald Isley and 112 and Notorious
B.I.G., the producers and artists who rule R&AMP;B have rediscovered
the duet as a way to get two artists on the radio in the space of
one single.
<p>
   Which is to say, they're offering an ongoing two-for-one sale in
one of the most crowded, competitive genres in pop music. And
they're offering a lot of them: Last year at this time, there were
four singles in the top 20 of the national R&AMP;B singles charts
featuring duets or combinations, and seven in the top 20 of the
national rap singles charts. Currently, there are nine and 13,
respectively.
<p>
   That's too many, mainly because the actual songs themselves feed
into the sound-alike quality of much of today's urban music. That
sound is an often unsatisfying fusion of slow-to-medium beats, with
traces of '70s funk and a more streetwise sensibility than much
ultrasuccessful '80s urban music had.
<p>
   But what is more troubling for the future of the music is that
duets are becoming staples of full-length CDs. Three recent
releases illustrate the problem: Mariah Carey's ``Butterfly,''
SWV's ``Release Some Tension'' and Missy Misdemeanor Elliott's
``Supa Dupa Fly.''
<p>
   Of the three, Carey's CD falls into the duet trap only three
times: Mase and The Lox join her on the title track; there's the
one track, ``Breakdown,'' that features Bone thugs; and Dru Hill
chips in some moans and deep vocals on a cover of Prince's ``The
Beautiful Ones.'' But in each case, the combinations sound forced,
unsure  &MD;  marriages of convenience, not romance.
<p>
   The SWV and Elliott CDs, however, are off the charts for
overkill: In each case, more than half the tracks on the CD feature
other performers, from Sean ``Puff Daddy'' Combs to Redman to Lil'
Kim to Jodeci to Busta Rhymes.
<p>
   The result is that SWV and Elliott often sound like guest
artists on their own CDs; the songs ooze together until it's often
difficult to tell who is singing with whom. Is it Elliott and 702?
Elliott and Timbaland? SWV and Foxy Brown? Or is that SWV and
Elliott?
<p>
   And once you get to that point, to not even knowing who is
singing with whom, all sense of individual talents has fallen by
the wayside, and it becomes increasingly hard to care about the
music. Throwing one duet after another out to the public and hoping
for a hit is the flavor of the month. But it's become an artistic
dead end that is quickly leading to a lot of decidedly mediocre
music.
<p>
   And ultimately, that's going to mean tough times at the cash
register.

   50 men stood up proudly. Following on from this he then
enquired:
<p>
   `How many of you have sex only once a week?`
<p>
   Another 30 men stand up rather sheepishly. The lecturer then
asked:
<p>
   `Which of you only have sex once every month?`

   10 men after a pause of about 2 minutes shamefacedly stand up.
After a brief pause the lecturer then asks:
<p>
   `Are there any of you who have sex only once every 6 months?`
<p>
   Nine ncredibly embarassed men weeping from the shame stood up.
<p>
   The lecturer was astonished to find that there was still one
individual who had not been accounted for.
<p>
   So he questioned in disbelief:
<p>
   `Are there any of you who only have sex once a year!?`
<p>
   To which the remaining man leapt up ecstatically with a smile
ear to ear
and cried ` I only have sex once a year!` &HT;    The lecturer confused at why he was so happy asked him:

    &UR; BUREAUCRAT BASHING  &LR; 
<p>
   Three boys are in the schoolyard bragging of how great their
fathers are:
<p>
   The first one says: `Well, my father runs the fastest. He can
fire an arrow, and start to run, I tell you, he gets there before
the arrow.`
<p>
   The second one says: `Ha! You think that's fast! My father is a
hunter. He can shoot his gun and be there before the bullet.`
<p>
   The third one listens to the other two and shakes his head. He
then says: `You two know nothing about fast. My father is a civil
servant. He stops working at 4:30 and he is home by 3:45!`
<p>
    &UR; Is This Dirty? &LR; 
<p>
   `The lecturer had just finished giving his in-depth speech on
sex and now wanted to take down some statistics from the 100 strong
male audience regarding their sex-lives.
<p>
   He started off by asking:
<p>
   `Which of the members of this audience enjoy sex at least once
daily?`
<p>
   50 men stood up proudly. Following on from this he then
enquired:
<p>
   `How many of you have sex only once a week?`
<p>
   Another 30 men stand up rather sheepishly. The lecturer then
asked:
<p>
   `Which of you only have sex once every month?`
<p>
   10 men after a pause of about 2 minutes shamefacedly stand up.
After a brief pause the lecturer then asks:
<p>
   `Are there any of you who have sex only once every 6 months?`
<p>
   Nine ncredibly embarassed men weeping from the shame stood up.
<p>
   The lecturer was astonished to find that there was still one
individual who had not been accounted for.
<p>
   So he questioned in disbelief:
<p>
   `Are there any of you who only have sex once a year!?`
<p>
   To which the remaining man leapt up ecstatically with a smile
ear to ear
and cried ` I only have sex once a year!` &HT;    The lecturer confused at why he was so happy asked him:
<p>
   `I'm sorry, I don't understand why you are so happy. You only
have sex once a year!`
<p>

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100 ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, September 26 -- The following chart shows how senators
and representatives voted on key bills and amendments this week. A
``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the
member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not
vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
<p>
   SENATE VOTES:
<p>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LABELS
<p>
   The Senate Tuesday rejected, 65-35, a measure to strengthen the
Food and Drug Administration's authority to review medical devices.
The amendment to an FDA overhaul bill would have allowed the agency
to test medical devices for applications other than their specified
use. Supporters of the amendment said that the tests would have
prevented companies from pushing through instruments intended for
uses other than those specified, which could endanger consumers.
Opponents argued that it was a bureaucratic impediment that would
strangle progress and limit potential technological benefits to
patients. A ``yes'' vote opposes the amendment.
<p>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FDA
<p>
   The Senate Thursday approved, 98-2, a bill to speed Food and
Drug Administration approval of new drugs and medical devices. The
bill would also give patients greater access to drugs under review,
provide companies more flexibility in disseminating information on
drug uses that are not approved by the FDA, and ease restrictions
on health claims of products. Supporters said the bill ensured a
stronger and more efficient FDA. Opponents said that consumers
could be endangered by false labeling of medical devices. A ``yes''
vote favored the FDA overhaul.
<p>
   VOTE : 1 2
<p>
   --- ---
<p>
   HOUSE VOTES:
<p>
   1) BILL NUMBER: RAISE
<p>
   The House Thursday rejected, 229-199, a bid to block the
congressional cost of living adjustment. The measure would have
stopped a bill increasing annual congressional pay 2.3 percent from
$133,600 to $136,673. Supporters of the pay increase said that
Congress deserved it and the raise only adjusted the salary in
accordance with inflation. Opponents said that Congress did not
deserve the pay raise because the budget was not yet balanced. A
``yes'' vote favored the cost of living adjustment.
<p>
   2) BILL NUMBER: LAWYERS
<p>
   The House Thursday approved, 340-84, a bill entitling defendants
acquitted in federal criminal cases to reimbursement for their
legal expenses. The bill would require U.S. attorneys offices to
pay a defendant up to $125 an hour in legal fees unless the
government can prove it was justified in its prosecution.
Supporters said the bill was necessary to ensure that citizens
aren't unjustly prosecuted by the federal government. Opponents
said the measure would have a harmful impact on the justice system
by encouraging additional litigation. A ``yes'' vote favors
reimbursement.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  On the second floor of Macy's in Herald Square,
within sight of a rack of Calvin Klein jeans and around the corner
from the Polo Ralph Lauren shop, is a collection of like-minded
clothing for women. There are smart starched shirts, colorful knit
sweaters and three-button wool jackets  &MD;  the armor of women who
earn their living in an office.
<p>
   The label on the collection does not invoke the name of a famous
designer  &MD;  in fact, these items carry the rather nondescript name
INC. But INC, or International Concepts, one of a handful of
private brands of Federated Department Stores, is trying hard to
keep up with its showy neighbors. The clothes whisper the same
trendy style, and the amount of selling space allotted to them
shows that Federated, which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Stern's
stores, considers INC an important part of its apparel family.
<p>
   Private-label clothing, not so long ago a mere hodgepodge of
items shoved into an obscure corner of the selling floor, has been
transformed into a major player in most department stores, all of
which are struggling to differentiate themselves from their
competitors.
<p>
   Instead of hiding shame-faced in the back, the clothes are now
trying to imitate designer merchandise and become brands in their
own right. No longer a handful of separate items, the new
collections feature entire outfits, sometimes with purses and shoes
to match, and the latest colors and shapes.
<p>
   Shoppers are taking note. Sales of private-label apparel, for
women, men and children, grew 6 percent in the first six months of
this year, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm,
compared with a 4.4 percent increase in total retail apparel sales.
Dillard's Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores and Carson
Pirie Scott &AMP; Co. all have turned their eyes to in-house brands.
<p>
   ``Private label is an important part of our strategy,'' said
Joseph Feczko, senior vice president of marketing at Federated.
``Before, it was a commodity opportunity. Now, we are building
brands with a personality.'' Feczko said that five years ago, 5
percent of Federated's apparel was made up of its own brands. Now,
that number is closer to 15 percent.
<p>
   The benefits of private label are clear. Home-grown products
have higher profit margins than brand-name clothing  &MD;  2 percent to
8 percent more on average  &MD;  because they cut out a middleman. This
is desperately needed by the department stores, which live from one
big sale to the next and have watched apparel profits go on a diet
during the 1990s. Further, the stores have total control over how
the products are displayed and advertised.
<p>
   Private-label products also relieve some of the tension that has
existed between the stores and their apparel suppliers for years.
Indeed, the retailers are emphasizing these products in part
because designers have taken the opposite tack, opening stores of
their own to escape the demands of the retailers, who ask the
designers to kick in for advertising and share losses with them.
Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, tossed out some of its less
expensive sportswear vendors and filled in the blanks with private
labels.
<p>
   ``If there is an opportunity within a category of merchandise
which the vendor is not fulfilling, we are going to go after it in
a big way,'' said Edward Carroll Jr., an executive vice president
at Carson Pirie Scott. ``The idea of having something exclusively
yours is very attractive to us.''
<p>
   Indeed, department store executives also said that having an
exclusive line of clothing with its own brand name  &MD;  like J.C.
Penney's Arizona, Saks Fifth Avenue's the Works or Federated's INC
 &MD;  can give a store an edge that draws shoppers in, if the line is
sold in a clever manner.
<p>
   ``Private labels are more consumer driven now,'' said Adelle
Kirk, a manager with Kurt Salmon Associates, a management
consulting firm. ``Everyone has Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, and so
there is no real reason for a consumer to go to Macy's over
Bloomingdale's. But department stores can use their own labels to
differentiate themselves, and as a way of providing more value.''

<p>
   The key is to make the lines ``branded''  &MD;  an important buzzword
in retailing. The idea is rather simple. A brand appears on the
radar screens of shoppers after they are bombarded with images of
the brand's offerings, from dresses to shoes to perfume, through
advertisements that evoke a certain mood or attitude.
<p>
   The notion is that it will make wearers feel sexy (Calvin Klein)
or sporty (Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch) or wealthy (Ralph Lauren). After
all, if a designer can cut in line at a self-important East Hampton
restaurant, why shouldn't wearing the jacket the designer made at
least get you a better table?
<p>
   To make the shift from also-ran to true brand, retailers have
taken cues from some of their biggest suppliers, like Tommy
Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren and Nautica. They have saturated the
marketplace with advertisements that let shoppers know what the
brand is called, for whom it is meant and where it can be found.
<p>
   Once the shoppers get into the store, the best private-label
sections will make them feel as if they have stumbled upon a
designer's boutique. There will be colorful signs and interesting
fixtures that keep with the theme of the clothes, much in the way
Ralph Lauren throws down a tumbleweed or Aztec painting next to his
Western-themed merchandise.
<p>
   ``Marketing is very important with private label,'' said Donald
Scaccia, the vice president of brand development at J.C. Penney,
which has one of the greatest private-label success stories with
Arizona. ``You've got to get into people's heads. You have to
project an image.''
<p>
   With so much on the line, many retailers have put together
design teams to come up with collections, rather than doing it the
old way  &MD;  knocking off last year's looks on the cheap and slapping
any old label on the collar. As with all brands, there is a
specific shopper in mind for a well-defined private label.
<p>
   Who is the INC woman? ``She is between twentysomething and her
mid-40's,'' said Feczko, the marketing executive. ``She has a
career, a hectic life style and may have family. She is a
forward-thinking working woman.''
<p>
   To embody this woman in advertising, Federated went as far as to
book model Shalom Harlow, who recently satirized the out-to-lunch
super-model image with her role in the new movie ``In &AMP; Out.''
<p>
   Even pricey stores like Bergdorf Goodman, a unit of Harcourt
General, and Barneys New York, which was recently acquired by
Dickson Concepts, treat private labels as just another of their
tony brands, and have hired high-profile designers to put them
together. Much of the production for private labels is now done in
the same European factories where the designer clothes are churned
out.
<p>
   This has led to greatly improved quality, but it also can eat
away at the value that private labels are supposed to offer. To
wit: a Saks Fifth Avenue merino wool cardigan with its label the
Works goes for a hefty $450. (Keep in mind that Saks' private label
is the least expensive stuff in the store.) Usually, department
store brands tend to be roughly half the price of so-called bridge
collections, which are the lower-priced designer lines.
<p>
   Elizabeth Musch, an advertising executive who lives in Paris,
was making her way through a rack of the Works at Saks on Fifth
Avenue recently. She flipped through wool jackets and silk blouses,
and threw a few over her arm.
<p>
   ``Private label is getting better,'' said Ms. Musch, who was
weighed down with shopping bags and an expensive designer handbag.
``There is not a lot of difference anymore between this stuff and
the designer's.''
<p>
   On the other end of the scale is J.C. Penney, which came up with
the Arizona jeans line in 1990 in its children's apparel
department. Since then, sales of Arizona, whose jeans compete right
next to Levi's, have risen from $50 million a year to $1 billion,
and the brand now includes everything from T-shirts to shoes to
jeans for women, men and children. In a recent survey by Kurt
Salmon of 1,700 randomly chosen consumers, 64 percent said they had
heard of Arizona, compared with 32 percent in 1994.
<p>
   ``The consumer doesn't split hairs and say INC is Macy's and not
a real brand,'' said Ms. Kirk of the Salmon firm. ``There is no
difference to them between the Gap or Levi's or Arizona. They are
all brands to them  &MD;  where they are distributed doesn't matter.''
<p>
   Federated has perhaps the most extensive lines of private-label
goods. Over the last year, it set up a 45-person unit, the
Federated Merchandising Group, charged with developing advertising
and marketing for its in-house brands. The development of the
product, from its hemlines to the way it is packaged, is all
managed in-house, a big departure from the way private labels used
to be put together.
<p>
   While the company has seven lines of apparel, it has thrown most
of its marketing dollars behind INC and Alfani, a popular men's
line, and has just introduced Badge, a collection aimed at young
men, that it intends to promote heavily.
<p>
   If the selection at Macy's is any indication, the INC line
provides a comparatively good value. While the fabrics are not as
luxurious as those used by even the lower-priced designer lines,
the fashions are very current and the collection has a cohesive
feel  &MD;  jackets from last season will find shirts that go under them
this season, and the clothes are put together in cute outfits that
can guide a shopper through her wardrobe.
<p>
   But the collection still lags behind in terms of presentation.
Sweaters are piled high on a table, sometimes dripping onto the
floor. Knit tops are shoved under a pile of skirts, to be dug out
by only the most intrepid shopper.
<p>
   Compare this with Nordstrom, which displays its Faconnable men's
wear in an attractive setting that rivals its designer collections.
Clothing is laid out among brass fixtures and polished wood floors.
<p>
   As popular as private labels have become, smart department
stores insist that they will never be overwhelmed by them, as
Macy's was in the 1980s, before it was acquired by Federated. At
the time, the retailer had dozens of private brands, none of them
supported with strong marketing, giving the store a
bargain-basement feel. Federated said it would like to keep its
private-label merchandise to around 15 percent of its total
offerings.
<p>
   ``Most retailers will tell you that the bread and butter is
still among the established brands,'' said Eric Hertz, executive
director of the Fashion Association, a trade group. ``They will
establish a significant percentage of private label, but always the
dominant factor will be the so-called market brands.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Less than a year after the most expensive election
in the nation's history, the Senate opened debate Friday on
rewriting the country's campaign-finance laws, arguing about
whether there was too much or too little money in the system now
and about what kind of changes could be made without violating the
First Amendment.
<p>
   But after more than five hours of often impassioned debate,
there was agreement on virtually nothing among supporters and
opponents of a bipartisan bill to overhaul financing rules.
<p>
   Advocates of change urged a ban on ``soft money,'' the
unlimited, unregulated contributions, as an essential step to help
fix a political system awash in money. But detractors said the
better solution would be to lift all limits on contributions and
warned that the proposed restrictions were a government intrusion
that would violate candidates' constitutional rights to free
speech.
<p>
   ``Perhaps the public good would be best served not by
restricting donations to campaigns but by promoting them, with full
disclosure,'' said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader. ``Spending money to advance your own political views is as
much a part of the right of free speech as is running a free
press.''
<p>
   But critics of the current system point to how total spending on
House and Senate races, measured in constant dollars, increased to
$765 million in 1996 from $318 million in 1976 and threatens to
spin further out of control to the advantage of wealthy donors and
special-interest groups.
<p>
   ``The core problem is that there is too much money, period,''
said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.
``This is now a club for millionaires. You either have to have lots
of money or you're indebted to somebody for the rest of your
life.''
<p>
   Congress has not seriously considered campaign-finance
legislation since 1994, when the House stalled until early fall on
a compromise bill with the Senate. Senate Republicans then
filibustered that bill to death, complaining that it protected
incumbents.
<p>
   The prospects for any significant changes this year are unclear
at best. Both Lott and Speaker Newt Gingrich strongly oppose the
bipartisan bill, which is sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
<p>
   Lott and Gingrich are championing the ``lift all limits''
approach. But it is going nowhere in the Senate. Senators spent
Friday outlining arguments and lines of attack that will be
repeated and developed during debate that is expected to continue
through next week and culminate in votes in mid-October.
<p>
   The central provision of the McCain-Feingold legislation, which
is supported by all 45 Senate Democrats and four Republicans, would
ban soft money, which comes from corporations, unions and
individuals and which political parties can use for generic
purposes like voter turnout but not for specific races.
<p>
   Overcoming the public's deep-seated cynicism toward the
country's political system will be difficult, supporters of the
bill argued, especially in the wake of Senate hearings that
revealed lurid details of influence-peddling activities in the 1996
elections.
<p>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who heads the Senate committee
investigating campaign finance and who supports the McCain-Feingold
bill, offered this assessment:
<p>
   ``The American people look at a system where we spend so much
time with our hand out for so much money from so many people who do
so much business with the federal government who we're basically
regulating and legislating on. They look at that system and the
amounts of money that are involved nowadays. They don't have much
confidence in it.''
<p>
   But several Republicans said Thompson and his Democratic allies
were misreading public sentiments and exaggerating the harmful
effects of campaign spending.
<p>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is leading the fight against
the McCain-Feingold bill, said federal campaign spending last year
amounted to $3.89 per eligible voter, ``about the price of a
McDonald's value meal.''

<p>
   Besides the soft-money ban, lawmakers clashed over a provision
in the bipartisan bill that seeks to draw a clearer line between
broadcast advertisements that promote an issue and those that
promote a candidate.
<p>
   The difference is important. Issue advertising does not come
under federal regulations unless they specifically say to vote for
or against a candidate. But in the most recent elections, many
issue advocacy groups skirted this line and broadcast negative ads
against candidates that never specifically urged viewers to vote
for or against them.
<p>
   Under the McCain-Feingold bill, an issue advertisement could not
use a candidate's name or likeness within 60 days of an election.
If if did, it would be considered an ``express advocacy''
advertisement, which is subject to federal regulations. The
advertisement would have to be paid for with federally regulated
``hard money,'' which is designated for specific races and which is
more difficult to raise.
<p>
   McCain said: ``Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, anti-labor ads,
pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican Party ads, pro-Democrat Party
ads, all could be aired in the last 60 days. However, ads
mentioning the candidates could not.''
<p>
   Republican opponents of the bipartisan bill said the
issue-advertisement provision violated a 1976 Supreme Court
decision that permits Congress to limit campaign contributions but
not campaign spending, because that would violate a candidate's
First Amendment rights to free speech.
<p>
   ``McCain-Feingold cuts at some of the most fundamental freedoms
in this country,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. ``They could
do irreparable damage to our nation.''
<p>
   Not only is the provision unconstitutional, Bennett argued. It
is also impractical to try to control political money.
<p>
   ``Controlling political money is like putting a rock on
Jell-O,'' he said. ``You put it on one place and it squeezes out
another.''
<p>
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., disagreed. In an exchange on the
floor, he reminded Bennett that in their Senate race last year,
Kerry and his opponent, William Weld, then the governor of
Massachusetts, agreed in advance to limit their spending.
<p>
   Bennett said Kerry's example only proved his original point:
``You made a decision, your opponent made a decision, and you are
in control of the amount of money that is spent. What
McCain-Feingold does is take that decision out of your hands and
put it in the hands of a bureaucracy.''
<p>
   Advocates of change expressed exasperation at this argument.
<p>
   ``This idea that we are going to cut off somebody from saying
something or that we are going to shut people up is simply not
true,'' Thompson said. ``It makes interesting rhetoric, but it is
not in this bill.''
<p>
   He said an organization could still broadcast an advertisement
with a candidate's likeness during the 60-day period; they just
could not pay for it with soft money.
<p>
   ``If something is called an issue ad, but is really an ad for a
particular candidate, it is called such,'' Thompson said. ``If it
walks and quacks and acts like a duck, we are going to call it a
duck.''

 &UR; MAX BERKING, 80, ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE ACTIVE IN POLITICS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (HLW) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY RAMIREZ &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Max Berking, an advertising executive who became an
influential figure in Westchester County Democratic politics, died
on Wednesday at the home of his daughter, Charlotte Berking
Zanecchia, in Alford, Mass. He was 80 and had lived in Northport,
Fla., since his retirement in 1982.
<p>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, Mrs. Zanecchia said.
<p>
   Berking spent much of his advertising career at his Manhattan
firm, Max Berking Inc., which was sold in 1981. One career
highlight was a promotion for Red Devil Tools that ran in Life
magazine in the mid-1950s, family members said.
<p>
   But his extracurricular love was politics, specifically the
uphill struggle of the Democratic Party in the heavily-Republican
precincts of Westchester County. ``He was indefatigable,'' said
John Carey, mayor of Rye from 1973 to 1981. ``When I was running
for re-election to the Rye City Council in 1967, we were up way
past midnight making calls and I wanted to go home. Max just smiled
at me and said, `All the greatest political achievements in history
were achieved after midnight.' ''
<p>
   In 1964, in the Democratic landslide led by President Johnson,
Berking won his one and only elective office, filling the remaining
year of a four-year term as state senator for eastern Westchester.
A year later, however, he was defeated in the predominantly
Republican district. He also ran for Westchester County executive
in 1969, but lost.
<p>
   From then on, his role was as a party leader and unabashed
lobbyist for liberal causes. In 1971, he was unanimously elected by
the party's executive committee as Westchester County Democratic
chairman and served until 1975. He was a longtime lobbyist for
environmental groups, and from 1977 to 1986 he was consultant to
the Legislative Committee on Energy Systems, which promoted energy
conservation.
<p>
   Even after retiring to Florida, he relished politics. He wrote a
regular political column for The Northport Sun-Herald and had
framed a letter to the editor, commenting on his column, that said,
``Max Berking is just too liberal to be believed.'' Friends say he
would just beam when pointing out the letter.
<p>
   Berking, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., had a longtime concern
for justice for the poor. College friends say classes at Williams
College taught by Fred Schumann, R.R.R. Brooks, and especially Max
Lerner, the essayist and professor of government, had a profound
influence on Berking, who graduated from Williams in 1939.
<p>
   ``We were suburban kids,'' said Harry N. Gottlieb, a classmate
of Berking at Williams. ``Those professors opened our eyes to what
was going on in the world.''
<p>
   Berking's first wife, the former Dorothy Noyes, died in 1962,
and he was separated from his second wife, Frances Bauman Berking,
of Northport, Fla.
<p>
   Besides his daughter, Berking is survived by three sons,
Charles, of Boxford, Mass.; Peter, of Vienna, Va.; and Laurence, of
Rochester, N.Y.

GROUNDED TROJANS STICK TO GAME PLAN &QL;

<p>
   BERKELEY, Calif.  &MD;  With USC's running game ranked last in the
nation, sophomore quarterback John Fox has been spared much of the
early season criticism.
<p>
   Still, he is taking the Trojans' slow start personally.
<p>
   ``My ultimate stat has been bad,'' Fox said. ``We're 0-2. We
didn't predict ourselves to be 0-2. We need to win bad. We didn't
come to SC to lose.''
<p>
   Fox may be winless as a USC starter, but questions have been
raised whether it is time to put more emphasis on the inexperienced
but promising quarterback, especially if the Trojans' running game
continues to struggle today against California.
<p>
   The answer for now is no, but coaches are recognizing his
talent.
<p>
   ``I know he's a young quarterback, but he's a young maturing
quarterback,'' offensive coordinator Hue Jackson said. ``I'm more
prepared to put more responsibility on our (entire) offense.''
<p>
   A check of Fox's individual statistics reveals that his own
performance has been fairly respectable in lieu of the team's
offensive breakdowns against Florida State and Washington State.
<p>
   He completed 55.4 percent of his passes (41 completions in 74
attempts) for 388 yards with no touchdowns and one interception.
<p>
   Those numbers do little to soothe Fox, however, who feels as
responsible for the Trojans' problems as the offensive line or
running backs.
<p>
   ``My third-down completions aren't that good. I've had some bad
signal-calling,'' Fox said. ``I am (harsh), but I think it makes me
work harder. This week is important for me to get a win, as well as
the team.''
<p>
   Even as USC has rushed for only 56 yards in 61 carries, Fox
refuses to question the run-first philosophy that USC coach John
Robinson has used as the game plan for this season.
<p>
   Asked if USC might eventually adopt the pass-first mentality
that existed when Rob Johnson and Brad Otton played quarterback,
Fox says, ``Never. That will never happen. You look across our line
of running backs and there is no way we shouldn't be gaining 200
yards a game.''
<p>
   Robinson has not given any indication he will alter his
offensive plan either.
<p>
   ``I don't think we have a chance to be successful unless we run
the ball effectively,'' Robinson said.
<p>
   There's another reason the coaching staff is reluctant to rely
too much on Fox.
<p>
   He made more mental mistakes against Washington State than in
his debut against Florida State. That would include incorrect
signals called or passing to the wrong receiver on a play.
<p>
   ``We had more management errors,'' Robinson said. ``And there
were other more subtle things.''
<p>
   Robinson specifically cited a fumbled snap from center that Fox
botched and resulted in a Washington State touchdown drive.
<p>
   ``John started on a quick count to pull out too soon,'' Robinson
said.
<p>
   ``That's one thing that should never happen,'' Fox said. ``I
couldn't believe I did it.''
<p>
   For his part, Fox doesn't believe he has been shackled by the
play-calling.
<p>
   ``I think I've had freedom. They let me pass the ball,'' Fox
said. ``I don't ever doubt myself. It's just a game plan. I think
they're looking for me to be efficient.''
<p>
   Fox's position is nearly the exact opposite faced by Otton last
year, when the Trojans struggled through a 6-6 season. Robinson
admitted that too much pressure was placed on Otton and vowed that
the next USC quarterback would not be placed in a similar
situation.
<p>
   Even Otton concedes that if Fox becomes the focus of the
offense, he would quickly endure the criticism he faced last
season.
<p>
   ``I've been listening to the postgame shows. The fans and people
like that expect players who are experienced to be doing things,''
said Otton, who is rehabbing from knee surgery and hopes for an NFL
job next season. ``I think a lot of the focus and blame hasn't
gotten on (Fox). But it will.
<p>
   ``But he's the type of guy who can handle the pressure.''
<p>
   Fox already is feeling the heat, in a general sense, from the
Trojans' poor start.
<p>
   ``There's tremendous pressure this week,'' Fox said. ``It's
frustrating to be 0-2.''

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; CEO List Narrows For Apple &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
Apple Computer Inc. has whittled its search for a new CEO to a
handful of candidates, including two Silicon Valley executives. &HT;    Ed Zander, a high-ranking executive at Sun Microsystems in Menlo
Park, and Joe Costello, chief executive of San Jose-based software
maker Cadence Design Systems, are being considered for the computer
maker's top spot, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Also on the short list are David Dorman, former Pacific Bell
president and CEO and currently an executive vice president at SBC
Communications, the regional phone company in San Antonio that
bought Pacific Telesis; and Samuel Palmisano, head of IBM's
Personal Systems group in Somers, N.Y.
<p>
   Apple says it will hire a new chief executive by year's end.
Until then, co-founder Steve Jobs is filling in as interim CEO. He
succeeded Gil Amelio, who was ousted in July.
<p>
   Apple's board of directors was presented with a list of CEO
prospects at a meeting on the company's Cupertino campus in
mid-September. The CEO search is being conducted by John Thompson,
vice chairman of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, a Menlo Park-based
executive-search firm.
<p>
   Apple is beginning to interview candidates and the process
should take two weeks.
<p>
   Apple and representatives of the four executives declined to
comment.
<p>
   Thompson could not be reached for comment.
<p>
   Sources said Apple is looking for a technologist with strong
marketing and organizational skills.
<p>
   But that could be a tall order in light of the company's many
problems and the daunting task of working with the headstrong Jobs
and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who is on Apple's board.
<p>
   A source close to the board said Jobs' influence could even
increase after a new CEO is hired. He said the board is considering
naming Jobs chairman for an unspecified time after the new CEO is
named.
<p>
   The prospects of such an arrangement could scare off top-flight
talent, industry observers said.
<p>
   ``You've got the three biggest egos in the valley  &MD;  Jobs and
Ellison  &MD;  you have to answer to,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of
the California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay. ``It's a
no-win situation.''
<p>
   Ellison pooh-poohed the notion that the new Apple CEO faces a
prickly situation.
<p>
   ``Apple needs someone who is truly amazing,'' Ellison said.
``Who wouldn't want to work with Steve Jobs, who is the most gifted
visionary in the industry?''
<p>
   Meanwhile, the company hopes to polish its tarnished image
tomorrow night with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz.
<p>
   Two 60-second commercials, called ``Think Different,'' will air
during the TV debut of ``Toy Story,'' the Oscar-winning animated
film developed by Pixar Animation Studios, where Jobs is also
chairman and chief executive.
<p>
   Chiat/Day, which developed Apple's famous ``1984'' Super Bowl
ad, created the spot.
<p>
   The computer maker also announced a new program that will allow
more dealers to sell Macintosh machines.
<p>
   Apple shares improved 19 cents, to $21.31 per share, in Nasdaq
trading yesterday.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Hey Gen X'ers, Got Wine? &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
Old wines are often better than young ones. The same applies to
U.S. wine consumers, but the industry is out to change that. &HT;    Forget about aging, oversized guys like Orson Welles talking
about ``no wine before its time.'' The wine industry is now using
hipper ads and younger spokespeople to woo 21- to 40-year olds, who
make up a disproportionately small segment of wine consumers.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   For example:
<p>
    &MD;  Bozell Worldwide, the ad agency that beefed up dairy sales
with its ``Got Milk?'' campaign has been hired to work on wine
promotions.
<p>
    &MD;  E&AMP;J Gallo is using third-generation family members to give the
winery a younger image and attract new customers.
<p>
    &MD;  New publications like Wine X and a trade group called Wine
BRATS are promoting wine to a younger audience.
<p>
    The reasons for all this activity is clear. Last year, 20-and
30-somethings accounted for less than a third of U.S. wine
consumption, while those over 50 purchased more than half,
according to a recent issue of Impact, a liquor industry
publication.
<p>
   By contrast, those aged 20 to 39 quaffed 49 percent of all beer.
<p>
   ``We need a broader base of wine consumers,'' said John
Gillespie, executive director of the Wine Market Council.
<p>
   Nearly two-thirds of those who drink wine at least once a week
are over 40. And this core group accounted for nearly all of the 5
percent annual increase in U.S. wine consumption over the past
three years.
<p>
   Wine drinking has been driven by the Baby Boomer generation.
``That's fine for a decade or two,'' said Patrick Dodd, marketing
director for Gallo of Sonoma. ``But what do you do when they start
to die?''
<p>
   Gillespie agrees and also notes, ``We need to challenge the
assumption that wine is only for special occasions,''
<p>
   To attract new and so-called ``marginal'' consumers, the wine
trade group has been discussing a mass media campaign for the past
two years. A handful of ironic and whimsical concepts from Bozell
will be tested on consumer groups next month. In February, TV ads
should air in two urban areas outside California and a national
campaign could follow.
<p>
   Don Sebastiani, chief executive of Sebastiani Vineyards in
Sonoma, endorses generic advertising with a ``Got Wine'' approach.
His family-owned company also has contributed $15,000 this year to
Wine BRATS, which was co-founded a few years ago by his nephew John
Sebastiani along with Jeff Rob Bundschu and Mike Sangiacomo to
promote wine to a younger crowd.
<p>
   In addition to its Web site at  &LR; www.winebrats.com &LR; , the
organization hustles to get favorable stories about wine on
television and in the press. It is planning an eight-city national
tour of marketing events and ``wine raves,'' which it describes as
high-concept cocktail parties combining fashion, music, food and
wine. In November, WineBRATs will help Microsoft launch Sidewalk,
its city guide on the Web for San Francisco.
<p>
   ``The wine industry has a real image problem,' said Joel
Quigley, executive director of Wine BRATS. ``Our goal is to convert
the next generation to wine. The organization's budget is about
$360,000, thanks in part to a $100,000 contribution from E&AMP;J Gallo
and money from Beringer, Korbel, Wente and others.
<p>
   Gallo is using its third generation  &MD;  Gina, 30, and Matt, 34  &MD; 
to give it a more youthful image and attract new consumers. In
print and TV ads, Julio's grandkids are promoting Gallo of Sonoma's
$10 varietals.
<p>
   Several publications have sprung up &LR;   &LR; to capitalize on the
wineries' advertising to younger consumers.
<p>
   Wine X, started last year by former TV producer Darryl Roberts,
distances itself from the highfalutin prose of wine trade mags.
<p>
   It wine ratings range from XXX (Exceptionally Cool) to XX
(Killer Kine) to X (Gets it Done). Its new issue says Dry Creek
Vineyard's 1995 Reserve Chardonnay is ``like silk stockings on
Madonna: sensuous and sexy but with an attitude'' and gives it an
XX.
<p>
   WineX's first color cover this past summer featured a young
woman's bare midriff punctuated with a navel ring, a mock tattoo of
a guitar-shaped corkscrew and overprint of the words ``sex, wine &AMP;
rock 'n' roll.''
<p>
   ``We're styling the magazine like Wired and other magazines that
younger people are reading,'' said Roberts, 35. ``We're not using
descriptors like `apple and spice' which are the most boring things
in the world. We're not trying to lure under-age drinkers but are
trying to graft wine onto a younger adult life style.''
<p>
   The publication has 27,000 subscribers and is just beginning
newsstand sales in major cities.

 &UR; DOW MANAGES A SMALL GAIN FOR THE WEEK &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   A revised government estimate of second-quarter gross domestic
product that showed economic growth was slower than expected fueled
a rise in stocks Friday, pushing broad market indexes higher.
<p>
   Buoyed by the news  &MD;  and the prospect of continued low interest
rates  &MD;  financial services companies like J.P. Morgan, Merrill
Lynch and Legg Mason posted strong gains. Technology issues were
mixed.
<p>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed higher for just the
second session this week, finishing at 7,922.18, up 74.17 points.
Friday's finish helped the Dow eke out a 4.91-point gain for the
week and nearly 300 points this month, or 3.9 percent.
<p>
   Despite those gains, the Dow continued its recent trend of
lagging other market indexes, posting only a 22.86 percent gain for
the year.
<p>
   In comparison, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is up 27.60 percent
this year. The index gained 7.31 points, to 945.22, Friday, but
still lost 5.29 points on the week.
<p>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,682.24
Friday, up 3.35 points to post a gain of 1.88 points this week. The
Nasdaq, with a 30.30 percent gain this year, continues to
outperform both the Dow and S&AMP;P 500.
<p>
   Friday, the Commerce Department's final estimate of economic
growth during the second quarter came in at a 3.3 percent rate,
down from an earlier estimate of 3.6 percent. Economists had
forecast that economic growth would be revised slightly upward.
<p>
   That report, which fueled investor beliefs that the ``Goldilocks
economy'' of low inflation and moderate growth continues, pushed up
stocks of financial services companies, said Raphael Soifer, an
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
<p>
   ``Good markets are good for their business,'' Soifer said,
adding that a growing economy and investors' continued appetite for
stocks aids the firms by increasing revenues such as underwriting
fees and brokerage commissions.
<p>
   Continued speculation about possible mergers among the financial
service companies, stirred by the Travelers Corp.'s planned
purchase of Salomon, has also pushed up prices, he added.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   J.P. Morgan closed at 113 15/16 a share, up 2 13/16. Merrill
Lynch added 3 1/16, to 73 5/16, while Legg Mason closed at 53{, up
3 1/16.
<p>
   In fact, financial service companies have been strong for most
of this year, said Joseph Battipaglia, chief equity strategist at
Gruntal &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The American Stock Exchange's Securities Broker/Dealer index has
been one of the best performing indexes this month. The 12-company
index of widely held securities firms is up 17.76 percent in
September and up more than 72 percent this year.
<p>
   Investors' continued appetite for stocks was evidenced by the
strong gains of several initial public offerings that began trading
Friday.
<p>
   Nextlink Communications, one of the most active issues, gained
6\ points to 23\.
<p>
   Network Solutions, which registers Internet site names, soared 5
5/16 to 23 5/16.
<p>
   But in spite of the appetite for stocks, the Dow continued to
move within a range this week, unable to sustain a level above
8,000. Analysts continued to point to concerns about disappointing
third-quarter earnings as the culprit. But some believed those
worries might be overdone.
<p>
   Expectations that had been offered at the end of the second
quarter that the economy would slow sharply in the third quarter
caused analysts to lower earnings estimates for some companies,
said Robert J. Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Zurich
Kemper Investments. But since a significant slowdown has not
occurred, many companies could exceed those reduced estimates, he
said.
<p>
   The sharpest trading Friday was in Britain, where stocks soared
on a report in The Financial Times that the government was
considering a move to join Europe's single currency, the euro,
after its scheduled introduction in 1999.
<p>
   London's blue-chip stock barometer, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index, set a record for a one-session gain,
rising 160.8 points, or 3.2 percent, to 5,226.3. In earlier trading
in Japan, stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225
issues dropped 347.25 points, or 1.9 percent, to 17,994.71.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  The Bizinsider column, written by columnist Herb Greenberg, &LR; 
 &LR; runs Monday through Saturday. &LR;  &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; The Mailbag  &MD;  That Quote About Shoeshine Boys and Stocks &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Herb Greenberg &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
First up this week is e-mailer nweaver, who asks: ``Regarding the
crash of 1929, who said something to the effect that, `I got out of
the market when my shoeshine boy started talking about stocks.''' &HT;    Financier Bernard Baruch, and the quote was: ``When beggars and
shoeshine boys, barbers and beauticians can tell you how to get
rich, it is time to remind yourself that there is no more dangerous
illusion than the belief that one can get something for nothing.''
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Baruch was referring to his own experience with Patrick Bologna,
who in the 1920s was the self-appointed ``Bootblack to Wall
Street.''
<p>
   According to Woodside money manager Ken Fisher's book, ``100
Minds that Made the Market,'' (Classic Books) Bologna was known for
dispensing tips and inside information he had been told by his
customers. ``Legend has it one of those tips sparked Joe Kennedy
into selling out his position months  &MD;  some say days  &MD;  before the
market crashed,'' Fisher writes. ``One morning, while walking up
Wall Street, Kennedy noticed Bologna was momentarily without
customers and reading `The Wall Street Journal.' So, he climbed
aboard the wooden chair and dug his heels into the footrests while
Bologna put the paper down and picked up his brushes.
<p>
   ``The usual hellos had been exchanged when Bologna asked, `You
wanna tip?''' Kennedy said he did, and listened as Bologna told him
to ``Buy oils and rails. They're gonna hit the sky. Had a guy here
today with inside knowledge.'' Fisher writes that Kennedy figured
the market must really be out of control if a shoeshine boy was
telling him what to buy. Kennedy swiftly sold everything and went
so far as to bet prices would fall by selling short. Kennedy not
only survived the crash, but made a fortune in the process. So did
Baruch.
<p>
   Message Center
<p>
    &MD; Memo to Seven W., of Colrain, Mass., who wants to know why the
Securities and Exchange Commission approves prospectuses that are
based on tricky accounting: Because the SEC isn't out to give a
deal its blessing by determining whether it's a good investment.
Robert Bayless, who is chief accountant of the SEC's division of
corporate finance, says the agency is merely looking to identify
any departures from the SEC's accounting and disclosure rules, or
any inconsistencies or changes that may require an explanation. He
says the SEC reviews nearly every initial public offering as well
as samples of other registration statements and annual reports.
<p>
   If the explanation is incomplete or suspect, the financial
statements may then be referred to the agency's division of
enforcement, which may then do an investigation.
<p>
    &MD; Last week's item on short interest didn't mention any Web sites
that carry the numbers. However, turns out Goang-Tay Hsu, who works
for an Internet search engine company, has his own site  &MD;  ViWes at
 &LR; www.viwes.com/invest/shorts.html  &MD;   &LR; that lists short interest on
all Nasdaq stocks. (Thanks, Doug C. for the info.)
<p>
   Meanwhile, last week's item that warned about blindly following
analyst recommendations prompted Jon Chambers of the San Francisco
investment firm of Schultz Collins Lawson Young &AMP; Chambers to pass
along the results of one recent study from a Dartmouth finance
professor showing that, contrary to what my item suggested,
performance figures show that analysts generally have good market
timing and stock-picking skills. (Thanks, Jon.)

 &UR; A PROPER FUNERAL FOR BABY ANGELICA &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.  &MD;  Regular business at the Nassau County District
Courthouse came to a halt Friday for the funeral. Led by police
motorcycles, a procession of buses and cars followed the hearse,
wending the short route from the courthouse to Greenfield Cemetery.
<p>
   Judges, an array of clergy, the county executive, custodians and
secretaries all clustered around the young oak that shaded the
grave from the bright autumn sun. They had come to say goodbye to
someone none of them had ever met, someone who did not have a name
until they gave her one.
<p>
   The baby girl had been born on the morning of July 16 in the
first stall of the women's restroom on the first floor of the
courthouse at 99 Main St. She was left in the toilet, drowned and
covered under wads of tissue paper. Her mother vanished and has
never been identified.
<p>
   Even for a court that handles legal disputes and crimes all the
time, this case was shocking. ``The very next day was very
solemn,'' Paul J. Margiotta, a court officer, recalled. ``There
were officers crying and back office people. It was very sad.''
<p>
   Margiotta said that the chief clerk, Mary Miles, went to the
head court officer, Maj. Clifford Mathewson, and asked, ``If they
don't find the mother and nobody claims the baby, what can we do?''
<p>
   Everyone was determined that ``this baby was not going to go to
potter's field,'' Officer Joseph Gentissi said. Margiotta was
deputized to coordinate the effort.
<p>
   Papers were filed to make Mathewson the baby's legal guardian
and to gain custody of the body. Others worked with the medical
examiner's office  &MD;  which had issued simultaneous birth and death
certificates  &MD;  to amend those documents to change the listing of
``unidentified infant'' to Baby Angelica. The procedures and other
arrangements took several weeks.
<p>
   Hempstead Supervisor Gregory Peterson arranged with the cemetery
to provide the burial plot. A court officer in Brooklyn who holds a
funeral director's license, Patrick Pope, volunteered his services.
A monument company provided a free headstone. The casket was
donated. Neighborhood merchants joined in.
<p>
   No detail was overlooked. Seven clergymen  &MD;  three Protestant
ministers, three Catholic priests and a rabbi, including
television's ``God Squad'' team of Rabbi Marc Gellman and Father
Thomas Hartman  &MD;  were recruited for the ceremony, Gentissi said,
``because this way we send the baby off with whatever religion she
might have had.''
<p>
   Although the casket was closed, Pope said the baby had been
clothed in a light-colored burial outfit and covered with a baby
blanket, provided by a friend of his who owns a clothing shop.
<p>
   ``There's a teddy bear and a little doll for her,'' he said.
``It's being done right. The baby didn't come into this life
properly, but she should go out with a dignified ending.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Many of the flowers  &MD;  gold chrysanthemums, white gladioluses,
red roses, orange lilies  &MD;  came from a florist shop operated as a
sideline by Timothy Jaccard, a police paramedic who was called to
the courthouse on July 16 and whose task it became to remove
Angelica's body.
<p>
   Although Jaccard had seen other dead infants, he said, ``This
one was more emotional than others I've handled. My stepdaughter is
pregnant right now. It kept running through my mind, how could
anyone want to have this child drown in a toilet? I did cry a
little bit in the bathroom. You have to, when you hold a baby in
your hands and wrap it up in a sheet.''
<p>
   Riding in the van taking the body to the morgue, he said, he
broke down and sobbed.
<p>
   Volunteers in the effort played down their own roles. An officer
behind a desk who was credited with suggesting Baby Angelica's name
declined to give his own.
<p>
   A plaque commemorating ``Our Courthouse Angel'' is being
installed on a wall in the building, and those who dealt with her
case say they will never forget.
<p>
   It all started with a complaint about a mess in the women's room
on July 16. The building superintendent, Earl Murphy, recalled:
``There was whole lot of paper and blood all over the place. You
couldn't see the baby, but I was suspicious something was there.''
<p>
   In quick succession, court officers, police and the medical
examiner were summoned to what turned into an official crime scene.
``That poor baby there, with so many people wanting babies and so
many people killing babies,'' Murphy said. ``I feel very bad.''
<p>
   Some at the scene thought the case might be a simple
miscarriage. But the medical examiner quickly determined that the
baby was born full term and alive. The cause of death was listed as
``drowning  &MD;  unattended delivery into toilet'' and was classified
as a homicide.
<p>
   The baby was white, 6 pounds and 19.5 inches long.
<p>
   At the Nassau police homicide squad, Detective Sgt. Daniel
Severin said he believes the mother might have been in the
courthouse for some legal matter. The court is a bustling public
building just two blocks from a bus terminal and a train station,
so she could have come from anywhere.
<p>
   Like many others here, Court Officer Robert Connolly wondered,
``If you can't keep the baby, why not give it up for adoption?''
People could only speculate at the possible factors: panic, shame,
fear, mental impairment, emotional illness, rape, domestic
violence, poverty, moral defect.
<p>
   In his brief remarks at the funeral, Margiotta said that Baby
Angelica has ``touched the hearts of the people of the District
Court.'' He said he hoped that her message is ``that no child need
die this way,'' and he pleaded for pregnant women in distress to
seek help.
<p>
   Hartman said: ``Even though this baby lived only a short time,
the baby's impact was monumental. We never know how long God wants
us to be here.''
<p>
   Gellman said: ``There's only one thing better than a proper
funeral for this dear and innocent baby, and that is to have had a
proper life.'' The blindfold of justice must sometimes be removed,
he said, ``to see the suffering before us.''
<p>
   After the eulogies, Court Officer Glenn Poore stepped forward
and softly hummed ``Amazing Grace,'' then sang it in an
increasingly strong voice as many joined in.
<p>
   Pink balloons were released to the skies, and the mourners filed
past, placing single carnations and roses on the white, 2-foot-long
coffin.
<p>
   ``For us, fortunately, this was a first,'' said Michael Rich,
the court's spokesman. ``Hopefully, it will be the last.''

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The economy grew at a 3.3 percent annual pace
during the spring, new data showed Friday, somewhat slower than was
previously thought but still faster than what most analysts
consider the economy's speed limit, above which inflation would
revive.
<p>
   Still, despite a further pickup in economic growth over the
summer, economists and Wall Street analysts say they expect Federal
Reserve policy-makers to leave interest rates unchanged when they
meet on Tuesday. The absence of inflationary pressures in price
data and the political climate have kept the Fed from trying to
slow the economy's vibrant growth. Such inaction could eventually
chip away at the Fed's hard-won credibility as an inflation
fighter.
<p>
   Friday's Commerce Department report also showed that final
sales, adjusted for inflation and excluding the effects of
inventory changes, rose 2.5 percent in the April-June period. But
several analysts said the quarter just ending could show a rise of
4 percent.
<p>
   ``This is making the Fed very nervous,'' said James E. Annable,
chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago-NBD. ``We're
setting up a very, very rapid rebound in total spending.''
<p>
   The central bank, however, can point to nothing in price data at
any stage of production or distribution to justify tightening
monetary policy, thereby raising rates, to dampen growth.
<p>
   ``The Fed is looking at the lowest inflation rates in more than
30 years,'' observed John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns
in New York. Indeed, never in the postwar period has inflation been
decelerating this far into a business expansion. The current one is
more than 6 years old.
<p>
   Without evidence of revived inflation, analysts say, the Fed
finds itself forced to remain on the sidelines, at least for the
time being, hoping that a big buildup of inventories during the
first half of the year will help the economy slow down on its own.
<p>
   Politically, ''there's just no taste for a sustained pre-emptive
move,'' said Annable, in contrast to 1994 when the Fed doubled the
overnight interest rate it largely controls to 6 percent from 3
percent. After subsequent trims, the Fed raised the rate
one-quarter point in March, to the current target of 5.5 percent,
in what Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, called a form of
insurance against a buildup of inflationary pressures.
<p>
   Although the Fed is not expected to take any action on Tuesday  &MD; 
and there has been no signal of any to the financial markets  &MD; 
analysts say the meeting will most likely be spirited. Underlying
the debate will be how to prepare for the next meeting on Nov. 12,
when continued rapid growth might force the Fed's hand. So far, an
unemployment rate of less than 5 percent and two increases in the
minimum wage have not significantly driven up pay, which is the
dominant business cost.
<p>
   ``Most regions are experiencing tight labor markets, recruiting
difficulties or growing labor shortages,'' a survey of the Fed's 12
districts prepared for Tuesday's meeting found. ``Two-thirds of the
the districts, however, report that these supply-demand imbalances
are not translating into generally higher wages.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Some members of the Fed policy-making group, the Federal Open
Market Committee, generally those based outside Washington, are
expected to argue for higher rates based on traditional assumptions
about a trade-off in which more jobs come at the cost of higher
inflation.
<p>
   Others, including Greenspan, have increasingly accepted the view
that the economy's ``speed limit'' has increased and that inflation
can remain in check at a growth pace higher than the presumed 2
percent to 2.5 percent.
<p>
   Regarding the accepted limit, ``there's a lot of reasons to
think that could be in error,'' said Lacy H. Hunt, an economist
with Hoisington Investment Management in Austin, Texas.
<p>
   He said that both the labor force, swelling with former welfare
recipients, and productivity, the other determinant of the
economy's speed limit, could combine to produce a noninflationary
growth rate of ``maybe 3, even 3-and-a-half percent.''
<p>
   ``There needs to be a smoking gun'' of inflation for the Fed to
tighten policy, Hunt said.
<p>
   Friday's Commerce Department report was its second revision of
gross domestic product for the April-June quarter. Its first
estimate of 2.2 percent in July was raised to 3.6 percent in August
before Friday's revision to 3.3 percent.
<p>
   The largest revised change was to exports of goods, the report
showed, while real final sales were reduced to their 2.5 percent
rate of increase from 2.8 percent at preceding tally.
<p>
   While the 3.3 percent pace of the spring G.D.P. rise was below
the 4.9 percent of January through March, it was not the lull for
which policy-makers had hoped.

 &UR; LATIN AMERICA STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM ASIA CURRENCY CRISIS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Miami, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Latin American countries may be
some of the biggest beneficiaries from the exodus of capital out of
Southeast Asia this year.
<p>
   When Thailand devalued its currency in July, sending currencies
of other Southeast Asian countries reeling, some investors feared
that Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, could be the
next to go down the same road.
<p>
   Instead, Latin America, with its booming economies and strong
corporate earnings growth, may draw investment that is fleeing
Asia. That could fuel gains in Latin markets.
<p>
   ``Funds are going to flow into Latin America as a result of the
currency crisis,'' said Jane Heap, a Latin America stock strategist
at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. ``Latin America can produce better
returns.''
<p>
   Heap and other strategists say that even with concerns about
possible weaknesses in Brazil's currency, Latin America still looks
more attractive than Asia. Mexico and other countries in the region
went through a currency crisis two years ago and handled it more
effectively than Thailand or other Southeast Asian nations are
doing now, Heap said. ``The Latin markets really aren't at the same
stage as Asia,'' said John Mullin, a Latin America stock strategist
for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
<p>
   After Mexico devalued its currency, the peso, in December 1994,
investors yanked their money out of markets all over the region.
Mexico's bolsa index dropped 23 percent in dollar terms in 1995 as
the country suffered through its worst recession in more than 60
years.
<p>
   That led to corresponding declines in other Latin American
markets.
<p>
   Still, after a steep slowdown in capital flows in 1995, the
region attracted much more capital in 1996, according to figures
released this week by the International Monetary Fund.
<p>
   According to the IMF's annual International Capital Markets
study, total capital inflows into Latin America and the Caribbean
more than doubled in 1996 to $77.7 billion. Net direct foreign
investment rose 50 percent to $29.9 billion, and net portfolio
investment jumped to $27.1 billion, from a net loss of $7.5 billion
in 1995.
<p>
   With Latin stock markets rising and the region's gross domestic
product expected to grow by about 4 percent this year --its second
consecutive year of growth -- more investments are pouring in.
<p>
   ``You continue to see a boom in Latin America,'' said Keith
Horn, head of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s Latin America Debt Capital
Markets Group. ``The countries keep evolving and getting more
sophisticated.''
<p>
   Merrill, a U.S. financial services firm, is one of many U.S.
companies that are starting to put their money where their mouth is
when talking about Latin America.
<p>
   Merrill said this week it will increase its presence in Latin
America in the next few years, increasing staff and possibly
getting new seats on Latin American stock exchanges, entering into
joint ventures or making minority investments in other firms.
<p>
   ``The commitment we're making in Latin America is a commitment
for the long haul,'' Horn said.
<p>
   Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest provider of
telecommunications equipment, also said recently it expects Latin
America to become a larger part of its business. Lucent in June
completed a $100 million investment in its largest Mexican factory
in Guadalajara and in May said it would invest $50 million in a new
factory in Sao Paulo state in Brazil.
<p>
   ``We're very serious and we think the opportunity is terrific,''
said Greg Manganello, Lucent's regional director for business
strategies and marketing. Portfolio investments are also increasing
as the economies continue to rebound. Foreign investment in
Mexico's stock market nearly doubled to $49.65 billion at the end
of July from $29.65 billion a year earlier.
<p>
   Mexico's bolsa index is up 62 percent so far this year. And with
the increased political stability since July's legislative
elections, investors are starting to look again at the fundamentals
of the country's industries and companies -- and are finding some
attractive buys.
<p>
   ``Mexico is clearly a darling among emerging market investors in
Latin America today,'' Merrill's Horn said.
<p>
   Brazil's Bovespa index, on the other hand, has fallen 10 percent
in the past three months amid concern that its growing current
account deficit may pressure officials to devalue the currency.
<p>
   There are some indications that Brazil's trade deficit may not
rise as much as had been expected, however. And analysts say that
the country's $63 billion in foreign currency reserves and certain
economic policies, such as caps on consumer borrowing, will help
prevent a devaluation at least until after the elections in October
next year, analysts say.
<p>
   ``The Brazilian government has been implementing contractionary
measures throughout much of the year to prevent the situation from
getting out of hand,'' Salomon's Mullin said.
<p>
   Even with the recent decline, Brazil's Bovespa stock index is
still up 64 percent so far this year. Total foreign investment this
year through August was $10.2 billion, including both direct and
portfolio investment. That's more than the $9.6 billion invested in
the country all of last year.
<p>
   ``There are still attractive opportunities in the Brazilian
equity market,'' said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's Heap. ``The
market's not going to be subjected to a major currency shock in the
next 12 months.''
<p>
   Latin American were mixed this week as investors slowed the flow
of money into some markets seen as too expensive, while continuing
to fuel rallies in others.
<p>
   Brazilian stocks slid on the week as the market failed to
attract the domestic investors that have helped pump up the Bovespa
index's value by 64 percent so far this year. The Bovespa fell 0.99
percent on the week and rose 1.3 percent on Friday to 11,533.9,
amid optimism that slower economic growth and lower bond yields in
the U.S. will bring investors south.
<p>
   Mexican equities rose as interest rates fell in this week's
auction of government debt, fueling optimism company earnings will
rise. The bolsa index rose 0.4 percent on Friday and 2.6 percent on
the week to close at 5249.95.
<p>
   Argentine equities rose, with the Merval index jumping 1.7
percent on the week, as investors started snapping up bank stocks
again after a period of declines. The Merval index closed up 0.94
percent on Friday at 825.91.
<p>
   Stocks in Chile fell during the week as rising bond yields made
fixed-income securities more attractive than stocks, and amid
concerns about profits at electric utilities. The IPSA benchmark
index of 40 stocks dropped 2.3 percent on the week but rose 0.42
percent on Friday to 128.29 as concerns about the utilities started
to wane.
<p>
   In Venezuela, stocks fell from another all-time high on Tuesday
as investors bet that a recent rally has left shares too expensive.
The Caracas stock exchange's general index slipped 0.56 percent on
Friday and 2.5 percent on the week to 10504.3.
<p>
   Peru's Selective index rose 1.6 percent on the week, as optimism
about earnings at Telefonica del Peru SA and hopes that a dispute
at Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA will be resolved in the company's
favor more than offset earlier declines in mining shares. The index
rose 1.1 percent on Friday to 2908.18.
<p>
   Colombian equities also rose, with Bogota's IBB index reaching
another all-time high on Friday, as foreign investors continued to
put money into shares considered inexpensive relative to earnings.
The IBB index rose 2.3 percent on the week and 0.04 percent on
Friday to close at 1456.17.

 &UR; DITKA SHOWS HE HASN'T LOST HIS FIRE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (JT &LR; ) &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.  &MD;  Mike Ditka knows his image.
<p>
   ``I've never been the tyrant they've made me out to be,'' Ditka
said.
<p>
   But when his New Orleans Saints trailed the San Francisco 49ers,
23-0, at halftime two weeks ago in what became the team's third
consecutive defeat, Ditka's new players learned a bit about the man
nicknamed Iron Mike.
<p>
   ``There have always been times when I've crossed the line,''
Ditka said. ``Yeah, halftime of that game would be one of them.
Hey, everybody throughout history has gotten aggravated.''
<p>
   He comes to Giants Stadium on Sunday a first-year coach of a
different kind. Taking over the most pitiable franchise in the
National Football League, Ditka by sheer will is supposed to revive
the Saints (3-13 in 1996) and maybe even do what has not been done
in 30 years of pro football in New Orleans: win a playoff game.
<p>
   But three games into his coaching comeback, Ditka did not have a
victory. That changed last Sunday when the Saints defeated the
Detroit Lions, 35-17. In the wake of that game, people immediately
linked the victory with Ditka's halftime tirade from the previous
week.
<p>
   ``I don't know what that had to do with it,'' Ditka said. ``I
blew up to try to get them to realize I was tired of it. I wanted
them to get tired of it. I wanted it to taste so bad to them they
were disgusted with it.''
<p>
   Saints players did not credit Ditka's tirade for the victory
over the Lions. ``I think the most important thing is that the
players had a meeting amongst ourselves before the game,'' Saints
quarterback Heath Shuler said.
<p>
   ``When you raise your voice, it makes news,'' Giants Coach Jim
Fassel said. While Fassel does not wonder why he has not been
called Iron Jim, he does wonder why his image seems to be the
inverse of Ditka's.
<p>
   ``I don't know when I got this `softy' label,'' Fassel said
Friday after the Giants' practice. ``You know, all this laid-back
Californian stuff. I am that way normally, I guess. But I have a
reasonably short fuse. I will, and have, let the players know how I
feel. We're all grown men here. And I'm going to tell what I think
very frankly.''
<p>
   Or, as Ditka said: ``You can motivate greater with fear than
love.'' He added, ``But I also motivate with love.''
<p>
   Ditka, 57, said he is a calmer person than the one who coached
the Chicago Bears for 11 seasons, posting a record of 112-68 and
winning a Super Bowl.
<p>
   ``Four years off from football will do that to you,'' said
Ditka, who spent those years as a commentator for NBC. ``I'm more
mellow now. I'm enjoying it.
<p>
   ``It's a little different than I thought it would be. I didn't
realize that it would be this tough mentally. You wrap your life up
in 50 other people, plus some coaches, and there's a lot of
pressure, because a lot of people are depending on the decisions
you make.''
<p>
   But he is still Iron Mike. Asked if he was at all like another
veteran coach back in the NFL, Dick Vermeil, who cried in the
locker room after the St. Louis Rams' first victory, Ditka
snickered.
<p>
   ``Well, it was a win,'' Ditka said of the Saints' victory last
week. ``But I wasn't going to cry over it.''

RANGERS NEED TO REMEMBER DIFFERENCE IN TWO SEPTEMBERS &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By JIM REEVES &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The significance of this day in Rangers history had slipped
Johnny Oates' mind as he pondered the second game of a
season-ending four-game series with the Anaheim Angels yesterday in
his hotel room in Anaheim.
<p>
   Funny.
<p>
   If I were Oates, I think I'd be more apt to try to forget the
present and revel in the glory of the not-so-distant past.
<p>
   One year ago today, the Rangers clinched their first American
League West championship at The Ballpark in Arlington, playing
against these very same Angels.
<p>
   Then again, nothing's quite the same, is it? A year ago, they
were the California Angels. A year ago, the guys across the field
were about to be the AL West champion Texas Rangers.
<p>
   Amazing. Only 12 months ago we were doing deep-breathing
exercises, gasping for air as the pennant race played out during an
excruciating trip to Seattle, Oakland and Anaheim on the West Coast
before the Rangers flew home for that season-ending series against
the Angels.
<p>
   Can you remember how fresh and crisp those days felt? How your
every nerve-ending seemed to be standing at attention? How your
emotions rose and fell on every pitch in every game?
<p>
   Compare that September and that baseball season with the one
we're seeing slowly fade away this week, almost without notice.
Only a year ago? There's a conundrum there, because it seems more
like a lifetime and yet only yesterday, all at the same time.
<p>
   One year ago tonight the Rangers were bathing in champagne and
wrapping themselves in victory cigar smoke, and nothing could wipe
the smiles off our faces.
<p>
   Those smiles didn't last nearly long enough, did they?
<p>
   ``Gloria and I were talking about that just the other day,''
Oates said, pausing to reflect on the events of only a year ago.
``The first thing that comes to mind, should we ever be in a
position to do that again, we're going to enjoy it more. We're
going to savor it a little bit longer instead of immediately
turning our attention to the next thing.
<p>
   ``The hours you spend on trying to turn it around compared to
the hours you get to spend enjoying a triumph like that are so
short. The scales don't seem to balance. You just don't seem to get
as much enjoyment out of it as you should for the effort that's
been put in.''
<p>
   That's the life of a major-league manager. There's only one
victory that can leave him with a sense of total satisfaction and
that's the fourth one in the World Series. That's because there's
no game to win the next day.
<p>
   As thrilling, as wonderful, as that Rangers' division title was
a year ago, the season still ended with a loss.
<p>
   ``When you win, you're thinking, `How do I get better?' When you
lose, you're thinking, `How do I get better?' There's got to be a
difference there somehow,'' Oates mused. ``I sometimes wonder, is
(Braves manager) Bobby Cox enjoying it more now than he did before?
Can he let out a sigh of relief? Or is he already planning for the
next one?''
<p>
   Easy answer: Win six consecutive division titles and find out
for yourself, Johnny O.
<p>
   The truth is, Oates is experiencing his first losing season as a
big-league manager since taking over for Frank Robinson in
Baltimore in 1991. It's not something he intends to make a habit.
<p>
   A year ago the earmark of the Rangers could be summed up in
Oates' favorite way of describing his team: resilient.
<p>
   That resilience  &MD;  the ability to bounce back from adversity  &MD; 
seemed to be missing most of this season, but then, so did many of
Oates' regulars.
<p>
   ``We were just as resilient,'' Oates argued. ``We just didn't
have all those injured people when we needed them. You can only
come so far.
<p>
   ``Coming out of spring training if someone had asked me if I'd
take 75 wins, I'd have said no way. I'm not happy with 75 wins now,
but with the amount of playing time we've had guys miss, maybe 75
wins isn't that bad after all.''
<p>
   Tomorrow afternoon, before the final game of the year, Oates
will gather his troops for a little goodbye sermon. He won't dwell
on the negatives. That's not his way.
<p>
   ``I do better when I just tell my true feelings rather than
write out a speech,'' Oates said. ``It won't be long. Maybe
something along the lines that this year's been tough, but it won't
be the toughest thing they face in life. We can become better
people because of meeting challenges like this.
<p>
   ``It can help make us better husbands, better fathers, better
citizens. There's something to be learned from adversity. You grow
from trials. I'm a firm believer in that.''
<p>
   In that case, the Rangers must have grown a foot this year.
<p>
   It is hoped that Oates will also ask his players to think about
how they feel about this season's end and compare that to the way
they felt just a year ago.
<p>
   There's a world of difference there.

 &UR; MARKET REFORM IRREVERSIBLE, CHINESE LEADER TELLS U.S. &LR;  &QL; 
(gh) &QL;

<p>
   BEIJING  &MD;  In his first meeting with a senior American official
since consolidating his power as China's leader, President Jiang
Zemin told Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin Friday that he was
irreversibly committed to the wide-ranging economic reforms already
under way here.
<p>
   At the same time, Rubin said that during his hourlong session
inside the ornate, lakeside compound where China's leadership lives
and works, Jiang made clear that China would make major moves to
open its markets only ``as economic conditions improve, and at a
pace that China feels it can handle.''
<p>
   Rubin's meeting with Jiang was primarily intended to set the
tone for the Chinese leader's state visit to Washington late next
month, the first by a Chinese leader in a dozen years. American
officials described Jiang, normally a somewhat dour leader who
carefully sticks to his briefing notes, as ``slightly ebullient''
after his successes at the 15th Communist Party Congress, which
concluded last week.
<p>
   During that session, the party endorsed many of the
market-oriented changes already under way throughout the country.
Jiang also managed to ease out several of his competitors in the
top ranks of the country's leadership, replacing several military
officials with a younger generation of non-military leaders whom he
described Friday as more attuned to the imperatives of economic
reform.
<p>
   Rubin's meeting Friday came at the conclusion of a weeklong tour
of Hong Kong and China, during which he assessed the prospects and
pace of China's move toward privatizing its lumbering, state-owned
enterprises and overhauling its ailing financial infrastructure.
<p>
   Rubin said Friday that his meetings with a range of Chinese
officials, especially with Jiang, ``gave me a sense that there is a
real vision of the direction the country has to move.''
<p>
   A senior Western diplomat based here said Friday that Jiang
appears to view his trip to Washington as the capstone of a
victorious year, one in which he presided over the return of Hong
Kong to Chinese control and then tightened his control over the
Communist Party.
<p>
   ``He views this as almost a second normalization of relations,''
the diplomat said of the visit, a reference to President Nixon's
trip to China a quarter-century ago that opened diplomatic
relations between the two countries.
<p>
   The content of Rubin's meetings here underscored how the Clinton
administration is trying to change the nature of its interchanges
with China  &MD;  away from sporadic, angry exchanges about human rights
and arms proliferation, and toward regular consultations that focus
chiefly on how the world's biggest industrial economy and its
biggest developing economy should interact.
<p>
   ``What struck me,'' Rubin said Friday evening, ``is that they
were willing for the first time to have truly informal, open,
candid discussions'' that included frank admissions of the
country's biggest economic headaches.
<p>
   The first among those problems, he said, is finding a way to
streamline government-owned enterprises without setting off
large-scale unemployment that could lead to political unrest.
<p>
   A second and related problem is stabilizing the country's
teetering banking system, which has lent more money to the
government-run enterprises than they have the revenues to repay.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Before his trip, Rubin said he hoped use his meetings with
China's economic leadership to establish the kind of day-to-day
rapport between mid-level American and Chinese financial officials
that Washington has long had with Tokyo, and recently with Moscow.
Friday he said he thought that kind of trust was starting.
<p>
   ``The fact that we were able to explore these issues in detail,
rather than just reading pieces of paper to each other, is perhaps
the most important change,'' Rubin, a former investment banker who
has worked with many troubled enterprises in his former career,
said Friday night. ``It suggests that we're moving to a more
mature, stable relationship.''
<p>
   Rubin also delivered a letter from President Clinton to Jiang
about the coming summit meeting, which he declined to describe in
detail. But other American officials said that as Jiang's trip
approaches, the two countries are scrambling to put together a
string of modest accomplishments that can be announced in
Washington.

   ANN ARBOR, Mich. Desmond Howard's Heisman Trophy-winning catch
for Michigan. Raghib Ismail's pair of kickoff-return touchdowns for
Notre Dame. Remy Hamilton's decisive field goal, and Reggie Ho's,
and Harry Oliver's, with the pennants in South Bend suddenly and
mysteriously falling limp. The series of games between Notre Dame
and Michigan, the two leading programs in the history of college
football based on victories and winning percentage, has created
instant heroes and produced gripping moments.
<p>
   Their meeting on Saturday, the 27th in the series and the first
since 1994, may follow a less ambitious script. For the first time
since the Associated Press poll was introduced in 1936, an unranked
Fighting Irish team will enter Michigan Stadium. Michigan (2-0),
which has not allowed a touchdown this season, must deal with
skeptics who remember successful starts that led to disappointing
finishes. Notre Dame, 1-2 for the first time since 1986, is
struggling to confront its limitations before they become
overwhelming.
<p>
   Bob Davie, the first-year head coach of the Fighting Irish,
maintains that his team has the ability to finish in the top 20 and
earn a spot in a bowl game. But a series of injuries, made more
costly by a lack of depth and big-play ability, has already led the
new coach to make basic changes and consider others.
<p>
   Michigan's 766 victories put the Wolverines 19 ahead of the
Irish. Notre Dame's winning percentage of .758 stands .016 ahead of
Michigan. But with the Irish having fallen out of the top 25, this
meeting will be just the third in the last 18 without two ranked
teams.
<p>
   Notre Dame's struggles, with a shocking 28-17 defeat two weeks
ago at Purdue and a one-sided loss, 23-7, last week to Michigan
State, are compounded by the height of its standard. Fifty-one
times, a Notre Dame season has ended with no more than a single
defeat. In the last 33 seasons, a period beginning with Ara
Parseghian's arrival as coach in 1964, the Irish have finished with
more than three losses nine times. Seven of those seasons were the
five under Gerry Faust and the two that followed as Lou Holtz
rebuilt the program.
<p>
   After the Irish meet the sixth-ranked Wolverines, they will
travel to the West Coast to face a Stanford team that has been in
the top 25. Faced with the possibility of a demoralizing start,
Davie has concentrated on simplifying his approach and narrowing
his goals.
<p>
   ``The immediate goal for me right now is to show improvement,''
Davie said, ``and be a better football team at the end of the year
than we are starting out this year. And whatever we have to do to
do that, we're going to do that and just continue to fight and not
worry about a whole lot of outside things. We've got enough to
worry about just addressing the problems we have on this football
team right now.''
<p>
   Davie has moved Jim Colletto, the offensive coordinator, from
the sideline to the press box. He has simplified the defensive
scheme to the point where the Irish may stay with one basic
defense, so inexperienced players can absorb their
responsibilities.
<p>
   He said he has discussed the possibility of replacing the senior
quarterback Ron Powlus with the junior Jarious Jackson. He has
reminded players of the need to maintain their enthusiasm.
<p>
   ``The thing that we've talked about is not being so fragile,''
Davie said. ``Not letting our enthusiasm and our emotion hinge on
what happens during the game. We have got to go in and set the
tempo, and we've got to be enthusiastic and be excited about
playing regardless of the situation.''
<p>
   When Davie was asked if the simpler defensive approach reflected
a long-term outlook, he cited the series of injuries that made it
necessary. ``I'm addressing it right now from where we are, and the
thing we can best do for our football team defensively right now is
settle down, give them a chance of knowing exactly what to do, and
I think that will help us in the long run. You know, before you can
build, you have to have that foundation, and right now we're trying
to set a foundation.''
<p>
   Parseghian, who understands the construction process as well as
any Notre Dame coach, faxed Davie a message earlier in the week.
``He said: `I wish I had a magic wand and I could make it all be
fixed. But watching you, it's going to take time to get it all
fixed,''' Davie said.
<p>
   Following Parseghian's final season as coach, when a power
outage caused a delay in a basketball game, the students chanted:
``Ara, fix the lights. Ara, fix the lights.''
<p>
   More than two decades later, the repair job at Notre Dame is not
nearly so simple.

NORTH TEXAS, TEXAS A&AMP;M OUT TO SHOW IMAGE ISN'T EVERYTHING &QL;

<p>
   DENTON, Texas  &MD;  A quick glance was all University of North Texas
lineman Phillip Armour allowed himself before staggering from Kyle
Field last September.
<p>
   His reasoning was explained by two numbers on Texas A&AMP;M's
scoreboard: 55 and 0. Linking letters with numbers becomes
unnecessary when UNT and A&AMP;M are the letters.
<p>
   ``I looked at that scoreboard and then I looked at them,''
Armour said of Texas A&AMP;M's players, ``and they looked like they
expected it. They expected to beat North Texas like that, and I
think we expected it, too.''
<p>
   UNT, then a fledgling second-year NCAA Division I-A program, had
little reason to expect much better. A bigger, stronger team in
Texas A&AMP;M had little reason to expect much less.
<p>
   And while high expectations at Texas A&AMP;M remain unchanged
heading into today's game vs. UNT at Texas Stadium in Irving,
expectations around the Eagles' program changed significantly after
a stunning 30-27 victory at Texas Tech last week.
<p>
   ``Confidence is written all over UNT now,'' Eagles linebacker
Benny Cherry said. ``We have no excuses not to win.''
<p>
   Cherry, a captain from Vernon, varied between fuming and
fretting after last season's debacle at Kyle Field. He became so
upset that this usually soft-spoken player called his teammates in
for a closed-door talk.
<p>
   ``He made us promise we'd never let that happen again,'' Armour
remembered. ``I thought of that for a long time. ... That's a
promise, a promise we need to keep.''
<p>
   To keep that promise, UNT must generate a lot more offense this
time around. A year ago, UNT failed to cross midfield. It
accumulated minus-10 yards rushing and only four first downs. With
each ensuing UNT punt, any confidence UNT had going into the game
drained from them.
<p>
   A&AMP;M racked up 624 yards in total offense, 29 first downs and 55
points. ``That's a lot of points,'' Cherry said, ``a whole lot.''
<p>
   In a span of a couple of minutes, defensive coordinator Fred
Bleil witnessed his squad go from hanging in there, allowing only
an A&AMP;M field goal, to faltering beneath pressure, allowing 45
second- and third-quarter points.
<p>
   ``That sticks in my mind quite a bit,'' Bleil said. ``It just
kind of got on a roll and got out of hand.''
<p>
   Cherry and Armour said teammates talked often during summer
workouts about the blowout at Kyle Field.
<p>
   ``We decided we needed that big upset,'' Eagles running back Hut
Allred said. By defeating Texas Tech last weekend, a hungry UNT
team finally compelled teams to take them as a serious threat.
<p>
   And A&AMP;M, well-versed in being upset by smaller schools,
including a 29-22 loss to Southwestern Louisiana in 1996, has taken
UNT seriously.
<p>
   ``Our players have a lot of respect for Texas Tech and playing
in Lubbock,'' Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said. ``When you watch the
tape, it's not one of those fluke deals that you can rationalize
away. I thought our USL loss last year could be attributed to
turning the ball over eight times, but this wasn't one of those
types of games.''
<p>
   Slocum pointed to UNT's 300 yards in total offense, an 80-yard
drive with four minutes remaining that ended with a game-winning
touchdown pass and a defense that held Tech to 111 yards rushing.
<p>
   ``The other team has a picture of themselves and if they get a
few breaks in the game, anything can happen,'' Slocum said.
<p>
   And that's why Cherry pulled his teammates aside. He wanted to
change UNT's picture of itself.
<p>
   He wants his teammates to think like defensive end Scott Blank,
a newcomer on this team.
<p>
   ``We can play with them,'' Blank said. ``I believe that, and I'm
going to believe that until A&AMP;M scores on every series until the
end of the game.''

 &UR; SENATE OPENS DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Senate opened debate Friday on an overhaul of
campaign finances with Republicans and Democrats voicing
differences over how campaigns are funded and whether any changes
are needed in laws that have spawned illegal fund-raising charges.
<p>
   As the long-awaited debate began Friday, 51 Republicans already
were lined up to vote against legislation that would outlaw
so-called ``soft money'' contributions that are at the heart of the
current investigations into fund-raising irregularities by both
parties in the 1996 campaign.
<p>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the first vote
on the issue would likely be held Oct. 6. But he made it clear that
amendments would be offered, including one of his own, that would
effectively scrap the reform measure outlawing special interest
donations to political parties.
<p>
   The bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., has the support of all 45 Senate Democrats and
four Republicans.
<p>
   It would ban contributions from unions, corporations, special
interest groups and wealthy individuals who give unlimited amounts
to political parties for party-building efforts  &MD;  commonly called
soft money.
<p>
   The soft money donations are not supposed to benefit individual
candidates. But federal lawmakers spend a good deal of their time
raising soft money, and much of it usually ends up being put to use
in support of their campaigns.
<p>
   Lott, who is opposed to a ban on donations from special-interest
groups, called the McCain-Feingold bill a threat to free speech. He
said it would impose unconstitutional limits on contributions to
political parties and causes. He called instead for removing all
limits on campaign contributions and requiring public disclosure of
every penny given and who gives it.
<p>
   ``Why don't we instead go with freedom. Open it up. Have full
disclosure and let everybody participate to the maximum they
wish,'' he said.
<p>
   McCain warned the GOP leader that the integrity of Congress was
on the line and that the American people would not accept
alternative bills that don't address the problem of ``too much
money in the political system.''
<p>
   ``We may think we trade on America's good name to stay in office
and shine the luster of our professional reputations. But the
public's growing disdain for us is a stain on our honor. And that
is injury which none of should suffer quietly,'' McCain said.
<p>
   Lott's decision late Thursday to begin debate on the
politically-charged issue caught lawmakers by surprise. McCain and
Feingold scrambled to finalize changes in their bill so it could be
formally introduced Monday when the debate continues, and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had to hurriedly mount a
strategy to deal with a threatened filibuster against the bill.
<p>
   Daschle said he was ``still relatively optimistic'' that the
McCain-Feingold bill would prevail, despite attempts to kill it
with ``poison pill'' amendments and the planned filibuster by Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has vowed to do everything he can to
ensure that ``more money, not less'' is pumped into the nation's
political system.
<p>
   ``We're going to proudly kill this bill,'' McConnell boasted on
CNN following the debate Friday. He said McCain and Feingold ``are
nowhere near the 60 votes'' they will need to stop a filibuster,
designed to prevent legislation from coming to a vote.
<p>
   Daschle said if Republicans are successful in blocking
meaningful changes in campaign finance laws ``after all the
shouting ... and (Senate) hearings'' on the issue, ``then the
public cynicism (of Congress) will go even higher.''
<p>
   A successful filibuster would all but kill any chance of reform
this year and could scrap plans to debate the issue in the House.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has promised a debate, but he
said this week that the McCain-Feingold legislation has no chance
of passing the House.
<p>
   Lott sought in his opening remarks to focus renewed attention on
the Senate investigation that has dealt primarily with Democratic
Party fund-raising activities and especially with President
Clinton's and Vice President Al Gore's involvement.
<p>
   In highly-partisan comments tinged with bitterness, Lott took
aim at Clinton, referring to the ``lurid exposes'' about his
fund-raising tactics.
<p>
   ``President Clinton's standing on this subject of campaign
finance reform is a case study of the problem, not an exemplar of
the solution,'' the Republican leader said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   Lott also took a swipe at labor unions. He said he planned to
offer his own bill that would prevent union dues from being
funneled into political campaigns without consent from union
members.
<p>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, righting that wrong is the price of
admission to campaign finance reform,'' Lott said.
<p>
   In an effort to attract more Republican support, McCain and
Feingold have revised their legislation to include a provision that
would address the dues problem. But so far the bill has the support
of only three other Republicans: Sens. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, Susan Collins of Maine and Fred Thompson of
Tennessee.

TEXAS IN UNFAMILIAR POSITION VS. RICE &QL;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  During a recent news conference, Texas football coach
John Mackovic engaged in a brief session of role reversal with
reporters to permit everyone a glimpse of the interview process
from someone else's perspective.
<p>
   After a few minutes and some lighthearted chuckles, normalcy
prevailed and everyone reverted to their traditional duties. Today,
Mackovic is presented with a real-life role reversal that could
prove painful for his football team if played out to the hilt at
Rice Stadium.
<p>
   When the former Southwest Conference rivals meet today, it will
be Rice (2-1), not Texas (1-1), that has a superior record. It will
be Rice, not Texas, that is coming off a victory against the Big 10
co-champions. It will be Rice, not Texas, that has ground out a
total of 872 rushing yards in its past two games.
<p>
   And it will be Texas, not Rice, that seeks to rebound from an
embarrassing 66-3 loss.
<p>
   While racking up 29 victories in the teams' last 30 meetings as
SWC opponents, Texas usually entered this contest with more
victories and more apparent confidence. Now, listen to what players
are saying as they prepare for their first meeting in Houston since
1994, when Rice won, 19-17.
<p>
   ``As long as we stick to the basics, we probably can win the
game. Blocking and tackling, that's all we have to do,'' said Rice
running back Michael Perry.
<p>
   ``This is a huge game for us,'' said Texas offensive tackle Jay
Humphrey. ``It's almost going to make or break us. If we can't beat
Rice, people are going to write us off for the year.''
<p>
   Suffice to say, this one is a toss-up in the minds of more than
just the Las Vegas odds makers who declined to establish either
team as a favorite. Texas quarterback James Brown returns to the
lineup after missing the team's 66-3 loss to UCLA with a sprained
ankle, but there are questions about his mobility. The Longhorns
also shuffled several defenders during last week's open date, most
notably sliding Dusty Renfro from outside to middle linebacker in
their 4-3 alignment.
<p>
   In search of a more aggressive mind-set, Texas coach John
Mackovic filled those bye-week workouts with contact drills and
scrimmage work.
<p>
   ``I hope we're hungry. We'd better be,'' Mackovic said. ``We
can't go in with a lackadaisical approach. We have to make some
changes. We have to turn this thing around.''
<p>
   In past years, that last line usually has been reserved for the
Rice coach. Instead, Hatfield said he envisions ``a meaningful game
for both teams, and one that we can win.''
<p>
   To do so, Rice must control the ball and the clock with its
ground-gobbling option attack. The Owls did that in 1994,
maintaining possession for 39:11 and limiting Texas' offense to 179
yards.
<p>
   With a defense in transition, Texas hopes to ride the right arm
of Brown to several long-distance connections against a Rice
defense that has allowed opponents to average 221 passing yards per
game. Brown said that his ankle might be ``a little limiting'' in
terms of mobility but that it should not affect his production
level.
<p>
   ``Because of the position I play, I control a lot of games. I
have the ability to do that,'' Brown said. ``I don't know if we
would have won (against UCLA) if I'd played, but we would've scored
some touchdowns. And we'll score some touchdowns against Rice.''
<p>
   But in this matchup rife with role reversals, can the pass-happy
Longhorns score enough to shoot down the ground-bound Owls?
<p>
   ``We'd better,'' said Texas center Ryan Fiebiger. ``I don't even
want to think about what a loss could mean. Let's just say this is
definitely the turning point of our season.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Frederick W. Zuckerman, a former treasurer of the
Chrysler Corp., RJR Nabisco, and the International Business
Machines Corp., died on Sept. 19 at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital
in Manhattan at age 63.
<p>
   The cause was colon cancer, his daughter, Lee Zuckerman, said.
Zuckerman was a resident of Manhattan.
<p>
   In 1979, Zuckerman helped persuade Congress to guarantee a
$1.5-billion federal loan to rescue Chrysler as the company
teetered on the verge of bankruptcy. He resigned from the auto
maker in 1990. After 11 years of commuting weekly between New York
and Detroit, he said he had grown tired of the travel and the
separation from his family.
<p>
   He became treasurer of RJR Nabisco in 1991 and left in 1993,
when he rejoined IBM, as treasurer, after a 14-year absence from
the company. He left in 1994 and became a merchant banker in a
private partnership in New York. He was on the boards of eight
companies.
<p>
   Zuckerman, who was born in Manhattan on May 4, 1934, graduated
from Ohio State University in 1955 and earned a master's degree in
business administration from Columbia University in 1958. He spent
the next eight years with the Ford Motor Co. and then served 12
years with IBM.
<p>
   In its February 1995 issue, CFO: The Magazine for Senior
Financial Executives named Zuckerman one of 12 executives ``who
made a difference''  &MD;  even though he had never been a chief
financial officer.
<p>
   The difference Zuckerman made, the magazine said, was in
arranging huge offerings of Chrysler stock, repayment of the
company's debt, and repurchase of Chrysler's 14.4 million warrants
to the federal government. He also helped RJR Nabisco regain its
investment-grade rating. During his second stint at IBM, he insured
the company's liquidity by negotiating a $10-billion, five-year
revolving credit line with 81 banks.
<p>
   Zuckerman told the magazine that he had been offered the title
of chief financial officer four times  &MD;  including by three
companies that subsequently declared bankruptcy.
<p>
   ``But I don't care about titles,'' he said. ``I care about two
things: equity upside and fun. If you can make a lot of money for
shareholders and negotiate the proper deals, you can also make a
lot of money for yourself. And fun  &MD;  fun is being party to a
turnaround.''
<p>
   Zuckerman, who was divorced, is survived by two daughters, Lee
Zuckerman, of New York, and Susan Seely, of Menlo Park, Calif.; and
a grandson.

TCU FULLBACK MAKING THE MOST OF A LIMITED ROLE &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By TERRANCE HARRIS &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FORT WORTH, Texas  &MD;  As a wise and thoughtful person, TCU
fullback Lou Porch never really harbored dreams of carrying the
load in the Horned Frogs backfield.
<p>
   He fully understands the Frogs' offensive system and the role of
the fullback within it.
<p>
   Block. Get back up. Block again. Sneak underneath for the quick
dump pass. Perhaps a couple of rushing opportunities per outing  &MD; 
after all, keeping the opposition honest is a must.
<p>
   It certainly is far from the role of a lifetime, but the
junior-college transfer relishes the few touches he receives.
<p>
   ``Things are going pretty good, though at first I was getting a
little discouraged because I wasn't out there like I wanted to
be,'' said Porch, who splits time with junior Lance Williams. ``But
I figure, with the time that they do give me, just try to make the
most of those opportunities.''
<p>
   Which certainly seemed to be the case during last Saturday's
40-16 loss to Vanderbilt, when Porch displayed quickness and
finesse in turning his powerfully built 5-foot-11, 223-pound frame
around the corner for a 12-yard pickup early in the second half.
The sideline scamper was instrumental in setting up a 39-yard
field-goal attempt by Michael Reeder, which sailed wide left.
<p>
   On his only other carry of the afternoon, Porch was cut down for
a 1-yard loss on a third-and-18 draw play in the second quarter.
<p>
   Porch, who is the Frogs' fourth-leading rusher with 34 yards on
nine carries, has also shown his prowess as an occasional tailback
in the one-back set.
<p>
   ``Lou is not a breakaway guy, but he's versatile in his ability
to block and run the football,'' said TCU coach Pat Sullivan, whose
team has a bye this week after an 0-3 start. ``He's solid and he's
a competitor and even though he hasn't caught a pass, Lou has real
good hands.
<p>
   ``But the biggest thing Lou brings to the plate right now  &MD;  he
does a really good job of blocking.''
<p>
   And while Porch takes pride in his blocking, it was not a known
strength until last year at Cerritos Community College in
California. After garnering ``Blue Chip'' All-America honors coming
out of Bellflower, Calif., as a fullback in the option system,
Porch rushed for eight touchdowns and more than 700 yards as a
freshman.
<p>
   Becoming more of a blocking back last season, Porch's output
dipped to 200 yards and a touchdown but he made first-team
all-conference and helped Cerritos to a 9-2 record and a Strawberry
Bowl berth.
<p>
   ``I figured after that, that everyone was going to recruit me to
be a blocker,'' said Porch, who chose TCU over Fresno State and
Nevada-Las Vegas. ``My blocking was all that they had to go on,
since they really didn't get to see me running the football.''
<p>
   Even though Porch seems resigned to his situation, the passion
for carrying the ball still seems to burn.
<p>
   ``I think running the football is every running back's dream,''
he said. ``And if it wasn't, they probably shouldn't be out here.
<p>
   ``But also feel fortunate that I can do a lot of different
things to help this football team. I'm not a one-dimensional
player.''

<p>
   While he begins the painful process of living the rest of his
life, Marv Albert might take a look at the enduring case of Peter
Edward Rose, an object lesson in denial.
<p>
   Albert brought upon himself one of the most stunning falls ever
seen in sports or broadcasting this week when he pleaded guilty to
assaulting a woman in a hotel. This advice comes from a colleague,
a friend, a former neighbor: Marv should immediately admit to
himself that he needs help, that he can be helped, for his aberrant
and cruel behavior. Admission of a problem is the first step.
<p>
   The negative example for stonewalling is Pete Rose, who has
spent the last eight years insisting he never bet on baseball
games, despite considerable evidence. Just about everyone thinks
Rose did, since he bet copious amounts of money on almost anything
else.
<p>
   This adamant stance has kept Rose from moving toward his twin
goals of working in baseball and being voted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame. Friday he applied for reinstatement to baseball, but
baseball sent out signals that Rose must first admit he bet on
baseball games. So there we are.
<p>
   In August of 1989, Rose signed a statement that he accepted a
lifetime ban, but he specifically did not deny or admit gambling on
baseball games. His signature was barely dry when the commissioner,
A. Bartlett Giamatti, told journalists that he personally believed
Rose had bet on baseball games.
<p>
   A week later, Giamatti died of a heart attack, and his death
hangs over Rose, almost as if an act of mercy or expedience or
kindness or common sense by Fay Vincent or Bud Selig would have
been an insult to the memory of Giamatti. Eight years is more than
enough for this standoff that does neither side any credit.
<p>
   S. Gary Spicer, Rose's lawyer, said Friday that while ``Pete
wrote that he did not want to say anything adverse about Mr.
Giamatti,'' the late commissioner did ``violate the settlement
agreement by saying Pete had gambled, and Pete has never recovered
from that public statement.''
<p>
   Rose is hung up by the rule that nobody who is banned from
baseball may be voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. A lot of Hall
of Fame members, and some journalists I respect, feel Rose should
not be in the Hall of Fame if he bet on baseball games at any time.
I watched him whack 4,256 hits while moving from one defensive
position to another, wherever they needed him. I never saw him give
less than his best as a player.
<p>
   People have analyzed a few comments or lineup changes he made as
a manager, but there is no proof he ever did anything to cover a
bet. I can truly justify Pete Rose the player in the Hall of Fame
unless he affected games as a manager.
<p>
   First, Rose must get saved, in the baseball sense of the word,
and admit what baseball wants him to admit  &MD;  that he was an
arrogant cuss, running with steroid pushers and bookies, betting on
anything that moved. But that would take a level of self-awareness
and humility that Pete Rose has never exhibited. If he were
reinstated, I cannot imagine anybody other than Marge Schott  &MD; 
herself on the restricted list for gross public comments  &MD;  wanting
to hire him. He and Marv made that problem for themselves, but I
personally believe that there must be room for slow, unguaranteed
redemption, if accompanied by remorse and wisdom.
<p>
   At this point, baseball is rewriting history by not including
Rose in the Hall of Fame. It's like the Soviet Union used to do,
airbrushing out all the commissars who had been executed since the
mass photograph of the Politburo.
<p>
   Rose has earned his place by his honest accomplishments. And so
has Marv Albert, a distinguished broadcaster and also a flawless
public figure until now. There was a brief story out of Syracuse
University Friday that Marv's photograph will continue to hang at
the school's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications until
further notice. Albert has long been considered one of Syracuse's
most famous former students  &MD;  as well he should be.
<p>
   David Rubin, the dean of the Newhouse school, said he would not
take down the photograph of Albert because ``I'm not going to make
it an issue myself.''
<p>
   Syracuse people could live with Marv's photo on the wall. But
Marv can help himself by openly facing his compulsive acts. He
should not squander eight years blaming legal procedures or
vindictive witnesses. Pete Rose and Marv Albert are both 56. Albert
can learn something from Rose's last eight years.

 &UR; RYDER CUP OPPONENTS PLAY IT CLOSE &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain  &MD;  When darkness fell Friday night, neither the
American team nor the European team could claim a clear advantage
at the Ryder Cup.
<p>
   In a typically tense opening day, the United States and Europe
were tied, 3-3, when darkness forced play to be suspended with two
matches in progress. It was a day that featured four thrilling
matches decided at the 18th hole, great putts under pressure, and
missed putts under pressure.
<p>
   While Tom Kite, the U.S. captain, used all 12 players on his
roster, Seve Ballesteros left three golfers on the sideline: Thomas
Bjorn, Darren Clarke and Ian Woosnam. That contrast in philosophies
could set up a contest between the United States' depth and
Europe's experience.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Tiger Woods had mixed results in his Ryder Cup debut.
Woods teamed with Mark O'Meara in morning fourball to defeat Colin
Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, 3 and 2, but in an afternoon
rematch in foursomes, Langer-Montgomerie easily handled
Woods-O'Meara, 5 and 3.
<p>
   Three players  &MD;  Brad Faxon and Scott Hoch of the United States
and Jesper Parnevik of Europe  &MD;  made successful match-clinching
putts at the 18th hole. And Europe's team of Jose-Maria Olazabal
and Costantino Rocca engineered a brilliant comeback from two holes
down with seven to play in morning fourball, defeating Davis Love
III and Phil Mickelson by one hole.
<p>
   Despite so much buildup, it appears this Ryder Cup will live up
to the expectations. And the team that leaves Valderrama Golf Club
with the trophy will have to survive momentum swings, unexpected
developments and even more pressure as the compelling competition
continues.
<p>
   ``Those so-called experts that said there was going to be a
blowout one way or the other have been proven wrong,'' said Kite,
who, like Ballesteros, spent the day motoring around the course on
a cart with a walkie-talkie, checking on one match, getting reports
on others, and worrying.
<p>
   Both teams faced the prospect of a hectic Saturday, with the
scheduled completion of two suspended matches, four morning
fourball matches and four afternoon foursome matches.
<p>
   In Friday's fourball matches, where each player plays the hole
and the lower score counts, the winners for the United States were
O'Meara-Woods and Faxon and Fred Couples, by one hole over Nick
Faldo and Lee Westwood. For Europe, the winners were Olazabal-Rocca
and Parnevik and Per-Ulrik Johansson, by one hole over Jim Furyk
and Tom Lehman.
<p>
   In foursomes, where the two players alternate shots with the
same ball, Montgomerie-Langer won for Europe and Hoch and Lee
Janzen beat Olazabal and Rocca, 1-up. Johansson and Parnevik won in
a dramatic finish, when Parnevik made an 18-foot putt at No. 18.
<p>
   ``It's very good for Jesper's confidence and for Europe's
confidence,'' Johansson said. ``He has come close to winning the
British Open twice, but he hasn't won it, so it's nice for him to
show he can hole those kinds of putts under pressure.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The players' nerves may become even more frayed before the
competition ends. Faldo and Westwood were perturbed by Justin
Leonard and Jeff Maggert, who chose not to finish the 16th hole
before play was suspended. Players have the option of finishing a
hole that has been started when play is called. Faldo and Westwood
were 2 up, and Westwood had a 6-foot putt for birdie that could
have possibly closed out the match. Leonard, meanwhile, was facing
a 25-foot birdie putt. Faldo and Westwood wanted to finish the
hole, but it was Leonard's turn to putt, and he and Maggert decided
to wait until Saturday morning to complete the hole.
<p>
   Spectators in the gallery at No. 16 booed.
<p>
   ``They weren't too happy about it,'' Maggert said. ``But it's
our option to play or not to play. We decided to wait until the
morning. We're out here to try and win matches and win the Ryder
Cup. We lost some momentum in the afternoon, and we want to be
fresh and let them think about it overnight.''
<p>
   The other foursome match in progress was halted after the 12th
hole, with Parnevik and Ignacio Garrido tied with Lehman and
Mickelson. With Faldo and Westwood in control of their match,
Lehman and Mickelson may need a victory to keep the United States
from falling two points behind.
<p>
   The start of play Friday was delayed 1 hour 40 minutes by a
heavy overnight thunderstorm, a rarity in southern Spain. But once
the matches began, the action turned hot.
<p>
   Olazabal sparked Europe's morning comeback by making an eagle
with a pitching wedge from 131 yards out at the par-4, 370-yard
14th hole. With Europe 1 up at the 18th hole, Mickelson had a
chance to halve the match for the United States with a 6-foot putt
for birdie. Mickelson missed it left, then put his hands over his
face in disbelief.
<p>
   ``I'm happy I got myself in that position, but sorry I missed
it,'' Mickelson said.
<p>
   Couples and Faxon responded for the United States against Faldo
and Westwood. At No. 18, it came down to two putts. Faldo had a
7-footer for birdie that could have halved the match for Europe. He
missed just right, and his knees buckled in disappointment. That
left Faxon, one of the world's best putters, with a 6-footer to
win. After a few words of encouragement from Couples, Faxon made
the putt.
<p>
   What did Couples say?
<p>
   ``He told me he loved me,'' Faxon said.
<p>
   ``I told him I loved him as long as he made the putt,'' Couples
said.

OFFENSIVE BALANCE A MUST FOR SMU AGAINST BRIGHAM YOUNG &QL;

<p>
   SMU will open Western Athletic Conference play today armed with
the league's leading rusher, but coach Mike Cavan fears it will
take much more than that to defeat the Mustangs' distinguished
guest.
<p>
   No. 23 Brigham Young (1-1) arrives for today's game at the
Cotton Bowl in Dallas featuring its customary array of weaponry,
and Cavan figures the Mustangs (1-2) are in for a stiff challenge.
<p>
   ``If you want to start listing what they've got, you can start
just about anywhere,'' Cavan said. ``For one thing, they have an
offensive line that averages about 6-foot-6 and 310-315 pounds.
<p>
   ``They seem to have settled on a quarterback (Kevin Feterik)  &MD; 
they stuck with him last week and he took Arizona State apart. They
have great receivers  &MD;  especially that number 86 (Ben Cahoon). They
have a great running back in (Brian) McKenzie.
<p>
   ``They're a really outstanding offensive team, and they are
exactly what I would like for us to be  &MD;  balanced.
<p>
   ``They've got great big people in there on defense, and look at
the way they handled ASU. They're a complete football team.
<p>
   ``What can I say? I can't imagine this team not being picked to
win the league every year.
<p>
   ``Just go around the league and ask everybody who they would
like to be like  &MD;  it's no big mystery.''
<p>
   Based on last week's results, Cavan can hardly be accused of
exaggeration.
<p>
   Embarrassed in an opening 42-20 loss to Washington, the Cougars
took a week off, retooled themselves, then rolled into Tempe and
knocked off the 14th-ranked defending Pacific-10 champions, 13-10.
<p>
   The score remained close only because the Cougars developed
problems after penetrating the red zone  &MD;  fumbling away one scoring
opportunity and missing two field-goal attempts.
<p>
   But Feterik  &MD;  a sophomore who threw for 216 yards in the second
half of the Washington game  &MD;  made his first start a good one,
hitting 17 of 30 passes for 328 yards, including eight tosses to
Cahoon for 219 yards.
<p>
   McKenzie, slightly injured against Washington, ran for 112 yards
against the Sun Devils while the defense registered five sacks and
never allowed ASU into the red zone under its own power. At the
end, BYU's total yardage advantage was 427-245.
<p>
   SMU, which suffered five turnovers and handed Navy 26 easy
points in a 46-16 loss last week, will try to regroup around Donte
Womack  &MD;  who leads the WAC and ranks seventh in the nation with 425
yards on 86 carries.
<p>
   Womack had 119 yards on 25 tries against Navy but carried only
five times in the second half, when the Mustangs threw more than
Cavan would have preferred in an effort to catch up.
<p>
   ``We panicked a little bit and got out of our game plan,'' Cavan
said. ``We're not strong enough either as a running team or a
passing team to win exclusively in that manner.
<p>
   ``To be successful and have a chance to win, we have to mix it
up  &MD;  and that's what we'll try to do this week. This game will be a
big challenge, and we're looking forward to it.''
<p>
   The game will be the WAC opener for both teams.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  An Army medic, court-martialed for refusing to wear
the insignia of a U.N. peacekeeper, attempted Friday to have his
legal battle moved from military jurisdiction to a civilian court.
<p>
   Before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Washington, the lawyer for Spc. Michael G. New argued that his
client is unlikely to get a fair hearing in a military court.
<p>
   The court's decision is pending.
<p>
   The courtroom was packed with more than 300 New supporters, each
brandishing a 4-by-6-inch U.S. flag.
<p>
   New's attorney, Michael Farris, argued that the government's
``breach of contract'' with his client ``changed his status from a
soldier to a civilian'' and thus his appeal should be heard in a
civilian court.
<p>
   U.S. attorney Michael Ryan, a lawyer for the military, said that
while New's case was ``unusual'' and fell outside the conventional
boundaries of military law, the case should be resolved in military
court and that New would be dealt with fairly.
<p>
   Farris said outside of court, ``What do you think  &MD;  five Army
colonels  &MD;  do you think they're likely to say that the president's
order is illegal? Not too likely.''
<p>
   On Oct. 2, 1995, New, now 24, refused to comply with orders to
wear the U.N.'s baby blue beret and patch when he reported for duty
with a unit scheduled for deployment on a U.N. mission to the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
<p>
   New, who is from suburban Houston, was the only one in his
550-member division who refused to comply with the order.
<p>
   In January 1996, New was convicted by a military court of
disobeying a lawful order and given a bad conduct discharge.
<p>
   But in refusing the order, New has become a beacon of opposition
for conservatives who oppose the Clinton administration's
commitment of U.S. troops in U.N. peacekeeping operations.
<p>
   Outside the courthouse, New, flanked by his father and
22-year-old German wife, Claudia, stood before supporters from
across the country.
<p>
   New's father, Daniel, said supporters had donated more than
$300,000 for his son's legal defense.
<p>
   Cynthia Kemper, a family friend from Odessa, Texas, stuffed her
three children, two nieces and mother into a camper and drove to
Washington to support New.
<p>
   Her reason, ``Patriots support patriots.''
<p>
   Maurice Klein, a 54-year-old Army veteran from Fawngrove, Pa.,
said that although he had never met New, the trial date was
``marked on my calendar for the past four months.''

FORGET CALENDAR, GAME IS MUST-WIN FOR UCLA AND ARIZONA &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By JON WILNER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Fall arrived last weekend, UCLA started classes
two days ago and temperatures in Pasadena should top 90 degrees
this afternoon.
<p>
   It's an odd time for a Rose Bowl elimination game, but that's
the task facing Arizona and UCLA when they meet today at 12:30
p.m. in the Rose Bowl.
<p>
   Each team is 1-2 overall. Each team is 0-1 in Pacific-10 play,
and each knows a second league loss this early means it won't be in
Pasadena for New Year's.
<p>
   ``The one that loses won't have to worry about Lawry's Beef
Bowl,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said, referring to the
all-you-can-eat Rose Bowl festivity for participating teams.
<p>
   The Bruins and Wildcats are not linked by stakes and records
alone. Just as No. 24 UCLA believes it is a few plays from being
3-0, so do the Wildcats, whose 20-point fourth quarter at Ohio
State last week boosted sagging spirits.
<p>
   ``We feel a little like UCLA did after it played Tennessee,''
Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. `We were out of it, then back in it,
but we couldn't quite get it. We've got to get the corner turned.''
<p>
   UCLA's turnaround was a 66-3 victory at Texas on Sept. 13. A bye
last week gave the Bruins time to recalibrate their emotions and
adjust their sights. But that surreal outcome is relevant this week
because of a harmless comment by UCLA quarterback Cade McNown that
was twisted and turned into trash talk directed at Arizona.
<p>
   On Monday, McNown said it was possible UCLA could duplicate the
66-3 score sometime in the future  &MD;  just like it's possible he will
win the lottery. He emphasized it would not happen against Arizona.
<p>
   The Associated Press turned the meaningless comment into the
focus of a story. Arizona's student paper, the Daily Wildcat used
the story and wrote its own headline: ``McNown Says Another 66-3
Win Could Come This Weekend.''
<p>
   Of course, it took a nanosecond for the headline to materialize
in Arizona's locker room, and Wildcats coaches have used it as
motivation throughout the week.
<p>
   Now, Arizona's angry, McNown's angry and Toledo's angry. ``It's
totally inaccurate,'' Toledo said. As for the Bruins, they're
angry, too, but not about the 66-3 imbroglio. The numbers that boil
their blood are 35-17  &MD;  the score of last year's loss in Tucson, a
loss that kept them from a bowl game.
<p>
   ``Everybody feels this is a pivotal game,'' Bruins receiver Jim
McElroy said. ``If we lose, we're out of the Rose Bowl for sure.
They kept us from getting to a bowl game last year, and we're not
going to let them spoil our season again.''
<p>
   Subplots abound for both teams. Is UCLA safety Shaun Williams
(sprained ankle) healthy enough to make an impact? Can a UCLA
secondary with three freshmen in prominent roles keep big plays to
a minimum? How will McNown perform? In two games against Arizona,
he's 15 of 46.
<p>
   Will Arizona quarterback and Newbury Park native Keith Smith
stay calm before 50 friends and relatives? How will Arizona
cornerback Chris McAlister, a Pasadena native who was denied
admission to UCLA because of questionable SAT scores, perform
against his father's alma mater? (Last year, he returned a kickoff
100 yards to bury the Bruins.)
<p>
   And what of Homer Smith, the former UCLA offensive coordinator
now directing Arizona's slumping offense? His last appearance in
the Rose Bowl was UCLA's 21-16 loss to Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
<p>
   Most likely, though, today's outcome hinges on the answer to a
far simpler question: Can the Bruins run the ball effectively
against Arizona's smothering defense?
<p>
   The scheme is designed to cut off inside running lanes and force
everything outside, where the Wildcats use their quickness to run
down opposing backs. Arizona has the 10th-ranked run defense in the
nation (61.3 yards per game) and has smothered UCLA's ground game
in recent years.
<p>
   The Bruins rushed 40 times for 70 yards in 1995, and 39 times
for 70 yards last year.
<p>
   ``It's not like a normal 4-3 defense where you help double-team
the opponents,'' UCLA center Shawn Stuart said. ``They put five or
six guys on the line and force you into one-on-one matchups. They
take away the run and dare you to pass against their great
cornerbacks (McAlister and Kelly Malveaux).
<p>
   ``It's more of a personal challenge against Arizona. Coach
Toledo has said all week that it's about individual battles. It'll
be man-on-man  &MD;  that's all we've heard. It's one-on-one.''

    &UR; HOUSE VOTES TO CURB GOVERNMENT-BACKED SUPPORT OF CIGARETTE
SALES OVERSEAS
<p>
    &UR; By CHRISTI HARLAN &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The House of Representatives voted Friday to
prohibit the spending of any federal tax dollars to promote foreign
sales of U.S. cigarettes or to lobby for repealing foreign laws
that are intended to curb smoking.
<p>
   The measure, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, is
intended to end most assistance to U.S. tobacco companies from the
U.S. Commerce Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative and U.S. embassy staffs.
<p>
   ``The United States should be in the business of protecting
children, not helping addict them to what is, for America, the
leading cause of preventable death,'' Doggett said.
<p>
   The measure was approved by voice vote and attached to the House
legislation that sets spending levels for the departments of
justice, state and commerce. The measure is not part of the Senate
spending bill for those departments, but Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., said he is prepared to push for its inclusion when the two
spending bills are combined.
<p>
   ``This legislation is going to pass because the Congress
realizes that while the Marlboro man is sitting at the negotiating
table in America, he's twirling his rope around the throats of
children around the world,'' Lautenberg said. ``The
Lautenberg-Doggett legislation might be the first big piece of
tobacco legislation to come out of this Congress.''
<p>
   Doggett first proposed this summer that aid be cut off for
foreign tobacco sales. He also wants to see foreign-sold cigarettes
labeled with the same health warnings as required for cigarettes
sold in the United States, and he has suggested a U.S.-led effort
to curb smoking by teen-agers worldwide.
<p>
   ``Since we're promoting most of the nicotine addiction, I think
we have more than a little responsibility to do something about
it,'' he said. ``I'd like to see us in the U.N. (United Nations) or
some other world organization do something about it.''

   The European press was abuzz Friday with stories of a UFO
sighting by the pilot and copilot of a Swissair flight over New
York state in August, but US officials say the object was nothing
more exotic than a weather balloon.
<p>
   During an Aug. 9 flight from Philadelphia to Boston, en route to
Zurich, the two pilots of the 747 jumbo jet reported seeing a shiny
object whizzing by in the opposite direction. Wire service reports
said the two reported that the object came within 50 yards of the
jet.
<p>
   The plane was flying at 23,000 feet over Deerpark, N.Y., at the
time of the 5:10 p.m. sighting, according to a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
<p>
   The pilot told the National Transportation Safety Board the
object was long and wingless, but the copilot described it as more
spherical, according to an Associated Press report quoting Swissair
spokesman Erwin Schaerer. The sighting was first reported on Swiss
radio Thursday night.
<p>
   But while some European reports have been skeptical of the US
explanation, FAA spokesman Jim Peters said the case seemed clear:
``Shortly after we were notified of the sighting'' on Aug. 9, he
said, ``a United Airlines flight flew through the same area, and
they identified the object as a weather balloon. We investigated,
and concluded the object was a weather balloon.''
<p>
   An FAA team looked at radar records, and found the object ``was
too small to be picked up by radar,'' as would be expected of a
National Weather Service balloon, he said.
<p>
   On Thursday, Peters said, the FAA received a call from a Swiss
television station, which had received information that the object
sighted by the Swissair crew was a rocket. Until the European press
inquiries, Peters said, the FAA had ``no particular interest in
this at all.''

 &UR; SENATE BEGINS FIGHT ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; By ANDREW MOLLISON &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Senate took up campaign finance reform Friday
with partisan pot shots and a bipartisan response that reflected
the opposing sides' strategies.
<p>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who is very skeptical of
restrictions on raising political funds, said the debate was
opening ``against a background of lurid exposes'' of fund-raising
abuses by President Clinton, who had threatened to call the Senate
into special session if it failed to vote on reforms before
adjourning this fall.
<p>
   Noting puckishly that the Democratic National Committee hoped to
raise $600,000 from a dinner addressed by Clinton late Friday in
Houston, Lott asked, ``What is he saying, `Stop me before I do it
again?' ''
<p>
   ``This is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem,''
responded Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who favors much
stricter controls on political finances. ``This is an American
problem evidenced by grand jury investigations, by special counsel
investigations, by congressional investigations.''
<p>
   Lott started with partisan points because he would need to keep
the votes of at least 41 of the 55 Republicans in order to block
final action, if amendments fail to make the bill acceptable to the
GOP.
<p>
   Daschle quickly struck bipartisan themes because 45 Democrats
could not prevent a bill-killing filibuster without the votes of at
least 15 Republicans.
<p>
   After the leaders left the floor, other senators began to lay
out detailed constitutional, practical and political arguments for
all sides  &MD;  entering pages of documents into the official
Congressional Record. They were trying to influence senators who
are more swayed by the written word than by oral debate.
<p>
   The speakers ranged from strong opponents of new restrictions on
political spending such as Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Bob
Bennett, R-Utah, to Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-S.D., and other advocates
of much tighter restrictions.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., made only token appearances on the floor, because they were
working with congressional staff experts to finish polishing the
latest revision of the only bill with any chance of passing.
<p>
   Their bipartisan reform bill has been endorsed by all 45
Democrats and four Republicans. They hope that further amendments
during the debate could expand their Republican support.
<p>
   The central provision of the latest version would ban the use by
national parties of ``soft money,'' which includes contributions of
any size from corporations or unions and contributions above a
$20,000 annual limit from individuals. To offset this loss, the
bill would raise the limit for individuals to $30,000 a year, and
let state parties continue to accept whatever gifts are legal under
their state's laws for non-federal election activities.
<p>
   Other provisions in the latest bipartisan bill:
<p>
    &MD;  Require swifter and better disclosure of campaign
contributions.
<p>
    &MD;  Give new enforcement powers to the Federal Election
Commission.
<p>
    &MD;  Require that any organization, such as a union or
anti-abortion group, which sponsors paid ads mentioning or using a
photo of a federal candidate in the 60 days before an election obey
the disclosure rules and contribution limits that apply to overtly
political committees. Printed voter guides comparing the voting
records or issue positions of candidates would be exempt.
<p>
    &MD;  Make it a little harder for unions to use money from their
treasuries for independent ad campaigns.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   After the formal introduction of the new bipartisan bill Monday,
Lott will introduce an amendment. Aides said it could be a
substitute for the entire bill or a much stricter version of the
union restraints.
<p>
   Senators will then have one week before the first votes on
amendments. That period will give them plenty of time to spell out
their public positions on campaign finances, while negotiating in
private over further modifications to the bipartisan bill.
<p>
   The House is expected to delay action until its leaders find out
whether the Senate will actually pass a bill.
<p>
   Preparing for that, a new group of House members from both
parties who have sponsored many conflicting reform bills announced
Friday that they have launched an effort to agree on one bill. It
will be ``based on the principles'' of the McCain-Feingold
proposal, said Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass.
<p>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the principles include
``banning soft money, increasing disclosure for candidates and
issue-advocacy advertising,'' and tightening the laws on what funds
unions can use for political activities.

<p>
   UNITED NATIONS  &MD;  The United States signed a package of arms
control agreements Friday with Russia that pushed back by five
years one of the major treaties of the Cold War, but that could
clear the way for further cuts in nuclear weapons.
<p>
   The agreement would give Russia until the end of 2007 to
dismantle launching systems  &MD;  missile silos, bombers and submarines
 &MD;  as required by the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or
Start 2. However, the systems must still be disabled by 2003.
<p>
   The treaty was one of the major arms pacts of the Cold War and
President Boris N. Yeltsin has insisted he needs time in order to
win its approval in Russia's parliament.
<p>
   The ratification of Start 2, which was signed in 1993, has
stalled in Russia, and the agreements are meant to break the
logjam. Whether they succeed in doing that remains to be seen.
<p>
   Administration officials said the agreements signed Friday would
clear the way for new talks to negotiate further cuts in nuclear
weapons in Russia and the United States.
<p>
   Accords signed Friday with Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine as
well as Russia also modified the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of
1972, reaffirming prohibitions on longer-range defensive weapons,
but giving new flexibility for the development of shorter-range
systems intended to replace weapons like the Patriot missiles used
in the Persian Gulf war.
<p>
   The pact indirectly places new limits on the speed and range of
future systems by restricting the targets the missiles may be
tested against. It explicitly bars the United States from testing
or deploying any space-based missile defense systems, a restriction
that has already drawn fire on Capitol Hill.
<p>
   The delay in the effective date of Start 2, as well as the
modifications to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, were
concessions on the part of the United States. They are meant to
reassure Russia that as the two sides move to cut their nuclear
arsenals still more under a future Start 3, the United States would
not deploy new missile defenses that could counter Russia's
remaining weapons.
<p>
   The signing of the agreements coincided with the first meeting
of foreign ministers of NATO and Russia, a committee created to
ease Russia's fears of an expanded NATO. Central to the debate on
adding new nations to NATO was the concern that Russia would feel
so threatened that it would drag its feet on further arms-control
agreements.
<p>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright signed the accords
Friday afternoon during a ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria in
Manhattan with Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia and
their counterparts from Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine. She said
the agreements would clear the way for Russia to ratify the Start 2
treaty, as the U.S. Senate did in 1996, and thus reduce nuclear
warheads by roughly half, to 3,000 to 3,500.
<p>
   The agreements could prove controversial in the Senate, where
some Republicans have opposed efforts to curb the development of
the shorter-range missile defenses, while others have proposed
scrapping the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty altogether.
<p>
   ``I hate to have that nagging feeling that some people are more
interested in defending this treaty than defending this country,''
Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said in an interview Friday.
<p>
   The agreements put into writing the pledges made by President
Clinton and Yeltsin during their meeting in Helsinki last March. At
the time, the two presidents agreed to take the steps toward
winning approval of Start 2 and pledged that they would work to cut
the number of long-range nuclear warheads by another third  &MD;  to
2,000 to 2,500  &MD;  in a third round of Start.
<p>
   ``All of this taken together has created the conditions for
further cuts in strategic offensive arms,'' Primakov said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The ceremony came only hours after the foreign ministers of
NATO's 16 members and Russia met at the United Nations. The
permanent joint council, as it is called, was established in May as
a forum for consultations on security and other issues as NATO
expands to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
<p>
   The meeting covered a range of issues, including the NATO-led
force in Bosnia, but produced no dramatic disagreements or
breakthroughs, a senior administration official said afterward. In
a statement, the ministers agreed to explore ways for the alliance
and Russia to work together on things like environmental projects
and the retraining of retiring Russian military officers.
<p>
   Perhaps more significantly, Primakov, while reiterating Russia's
opposition to expansion, sounded conciliatory after the meeting.
<p>
   ``We didn't have empty rhetoric,'' he said at a news conference
at the United Nations. ``Rather, we had a practical exchange of
views on very important matters.''
<p>
   Some military and political leaders in Moscow have complained
that Start 2 puts Russia at a strategic disadvantage since it
requires the elimination of all land-based multiple-warhead
missiles, the core of Russia's arsenal, while allowing the United
States to keep its multiple-warhead missiles on submarines.
<p>
   Michael Krepon, the president of the Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington, said the clarifications for short-range defense systems
helped insure the larger aims of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
would not be undercut.

    &UR; RAITT NO STRANGER TO ADDING HER CELEBRITY TO `NO NUKES' CAUSE

<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Singer Bonnie Raitt knew exactly what she was doing
this week as she patiently shook hands with dozens of starry-eyed
congressional staffers in the halls of the U.S. Capitol.
<p>
   Raitt especially knew what she was doing when she joined fellow
singing artists the Indigo Girls and Jackson Browne on a podium in
front of a simulated cask of nuclear waste and faced rows of
reporters and photographers.
<p>
   ``Frankly, if we weren't sitting up here, you guys probably
wouldn't be here,'' Raitt said.
<p>
   The reporters shifted uncomfortably, but they knew it; Raitt
knew it, and the members of Congress know it: nothing works like
celebrity to bring attention to an issue, especially one as
seemingly distant as the movement of nuclear waste from New England
to a dusty corner of Texas.
<p>
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry
Bonilla, R-Texas, whose congressional district includes the tiny
West Texas town of Sierra Blanca  &MD;  whose name has become synonymous
with the site where the waste would be moved.
<p>
   Bonilla led a successful effort to defeat the waste agreement in
the last session of Congress. Now, with another vote expected
within the next six weeks, Bonilla welcomed the additional protests
from singers like Raitt and Browne.
<p>
   ``It draws attention to the issue for people who haven't given
it a lot of thought before,'' he said. ``I don't know everything
that's going on about toxic waste in other members' districts. I
wouldn't expect other members of Congress to know about everything
that's going on in my district ... so anything we can do to get
attention helps.''
<p>
   For Raitt, that meant the news conference and handshakes and two
benefit concerts in Washington during the past week, followed by a
news conference Saturday in Austin with U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas, and a concert Sunday at the Backyard to benefit the Sierra
Blanca Legal Defense Fund.
<p>
   Doggett has joined with Bonilla to battle an agreement that has
the blessing of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, and
current Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican whom Bonilla calls ``a
dear friend.''
<p>
   The deal that is dividing friends and political allies would
allow the movement of low-level radioactive waste from Maine and
Vermont to Hudspeth County, Texas, about 16 miles from the Rio
Grande. Supporters contend the site is safe; opponents say it is on
a fault line that could shift and spill radioactive waste in the
river.
<p>
   The site ``is about as far from Travis County as you can get and
still be in Texas, but I have ... almost 2,000 people from Austin
who have contacted me on this issue,'' Doggett said. ``There is
concern about the environmental consequences of locating this in an
earthquake zone on the edge of the Rio Grande and in an area where
many of those most affected don't have the economic or political
power to make their voices known effectively ... ''
<p>
   Doggett, too, applauded the involvement of Raitt and other
``people who have such tremendous talent ... (and) match it with
their commitment to social and economic justice.''
<p>
   Raitt acknowledged that her biggest contribution is her
celebrity and that she was unlikely to change the minds of any
members of Congress who support the Texas waste agreement.
<p>
   ``Most of my talking has been congratulating people'' who work
on the issue day-to-day, Raitt said in an interview.
<p>
   For some, her presence at the Capitol this week raised a basic
question: ``Who is she?'' asked House Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey, R-Texas, who has quoted country singer Jerry Jeff Walker and
disco queen Donna Summers during news conferences.
<p>
   Raitt didn't meet Armey this week, but she spent time with
Doggett and other opponents of the Sierra Blanca plan  &MD;  and a lot
of time with reporters.
<p>
   ``I'm really here to be a town crier,'' Raitt said Wednesday in
Washington. ``It's a function that artists and musicians have been
since the early days when there weren't any newspapers.''
<p>
   Raitt has been donating concert time to the anti-nuclear power
movement for almost 20 years. She was a founding member  &MD;  with
Browne and Graham Nash  &MD;  of Musicians United for Safe Energy and a
featured performer at the group's concerts at New York's Madison
Square Garden in the late 1970s.
<p>
   But Raitt said her distaste for nuclear power began when she was
a schoolgirl, prompted by her upbringing in an activist Quaker
family and her meeting with eight women who survived the atomic
bomb that leveled Hiroshima, Japan.
<p>
   At school, she said, ``I refused to participate in the bomb
drills and got sent to the principal's office.''
<p>
   Raitt's current protest is taking her to stages in Texas,
California and Nevada  &MD;  all proposed sites for nuclear-waste
storage facilities. The message that she and other musicians are
spreading is that transporting waste to those sites will needlessly
expose millions of U.S. residents to radioactivity.
<p>
   Preparing to sing a duet Wednesday night in Washington with
Browne, Raitt looked over her shoulder at the ``No Nukes'' sign
hanging above the stage at the Warner Theatre.
<p>
   ``We've done a lot of concerts under that sign,'' she said.
``I'm kind of embarrassed that we're still having to use it.''

<p>
   In the eight years and one month since he was banished from
baseball for life, Pete Rose has often talked about wanting to get
back in. Friday he made his first formal attempt at a comeback.
With the odds overwhelmingly against him, the game's career hit
leader applied for reinstatement in a letter to Bud Selig, the
acting commissioner.
<p>
   Selig, in a two-sentence, 21-word statement, said Rose's request
``will be handled in due course.'' Gary Spicer, Rose's lawyer, said
he understood that Selig would not address the request until after
baseball's realignment problems are resolved.
<p>
   ``Pete has waited very patiently,'' Spicer said, ``waited for
the labor accord and all these issues that have come before
baseball. Now he would like to have his time so he can get on with
future plans.''
<p>
   Those plans would include induction in the Hall of Fame, a place
off-limits to the 56-year-old Rose because he is on baseball's
ineligible list. Spicer said some people had raised the possibility
that officials of the Hall, which is independent from baseball but
normally follows its lead, could be persuaded to make Rose eligible
even if he fails to win reinstatement.
<p>
   Asked if he planned to talk to Hall officials, Spicer said, ``It
would be premature and presumptuous for us to talk to anyone before
baseball rules.'' Official major league rules call for the
commissioner to act on an application for reinstatement. With no
commissioner in office, the executive council acts in his place.
<p>
   Although no procedure is in place for this particular instance,
Spicer said he understood that Selig, who is chairman of the
council, would make a recommendation to the council after reviewing
the request. Baseball officials have said privately that Selig
would never recommend to the executive council that Rose be
reinstated. They said that Selig has always maintained that A.
Bartlett Giamatti, the commissioner who banned Rose, took the
proper action.
<p>
   Rose, who produced 4,256 hits in his 24-year career, was booted
out of baseball Aug. 24, 1989, following an investigation into his
gambling activities. Rose, who at the time he was banished was
managing the Cincinnati Reds, has steadfastly denied that he bet on
baseball games.
<p>
   Spicer said Rose's only mention of gambling in his letter to
Selig was in connection with his view that Giamatti violated the
agreement under which Rose was banished. In the agreement, Rose
neither denied nor admitted that he bet on baseball. In response to
a reporter's question, Giamatti said he believed that Rose had.
<p>
   Giamatti's answer, Rose said in his letter to Selig, created a
false impression about his gambling. ``Pete feels that statement
has done more harm to his life than anything else that has been
uttered,'' Spicer said by telephone from Grosse Pointe, Mich.
<p>
   For the first time Friday, former Commissioner Fay Vincent
disclosed that Rose's lawyers knew what Giamatti would say if
asked.
<p>
   Vincent, who was deputy commissioner at the time and who
negotiated the agreement with Rose's lawyers, said Rose's
representatives tried to get Giamatti to agree not to say anything.
But Vincent said that Giamatti had told him: `` `Don't ever make an
agreement that will keep me from talking. That's the thing I do
best.' ''
<p>
   ``There was a strong negotiation on that point,'' Vincent said.
``They tried to get an agreement that neither side would comment
after the agreement was signed. We said no.''
<p>
   Spicer, who was not one of Rose's lawyers at the time, said the
Giamatti matter was one of three major areas that Rose asked Selig
to examine. The others are Rose's five-month prison term for filing
false tax returns and the investigation into his gambling that John
Dowd, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, conducted for Giamatti.
<p>
   In his letter, Spicer said, Rose pointed out that he paid more
than $2 million in federal income tax for the years 1984-87,
reported 93 percent of his income, then paid an additional $366,043
in tax, interest and penalties ``when other income was found.''
<p>
   ``He paid every dime of what was allegedly owed,'' Spicer said,
``and he still spent time incarcerated. Pete feels it should have
been only a civil matter, that there was no criminal aspect to the
audit.''
<p>
   Spicer said Rose raised the Dowd investigation as an issue
because Rose felt it was ``completely biased.''

    &UR; Eds: Revises graf 6 to clarify Fonda relationship with Atlanta
firm and adds detail of abstinence education funding in graf 2.

    &UR; By REGINA M. ROBERTS &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Actress Jane Fonda, warning that an emphasis on
sexual abstinence could reverse a decline in the nation's teen
birth rate, said Friday that schools also need to teach students
about condoms and other contraceptives.
<p>
   Fonda said the new welfare reform law, which earmarks $850
million for abstinence-only sex education in some schools, will
deny some students information on contraceptives.
<p>
   ``We have to be realistic in order to protect our kids,'' said
Fonda, a volunteer for Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention. ``There's a way to talk to children about relationships
and sexuality that is appropriate to their level of development.''
<p>
   ``Abstinence must always be the first message, but include with
that the information'' on birth control, she said.
<p>
   Fonda and James Wagoner, executive director of the international
group Advocates for Youth, appeared at a news conference to launch
a month-long ``Let's Talk'' campaign urging parents to talk to
their children frankly about issues important to their age group.
<p>
   Fonda said that next week she would join with Durex, an Atlanta
company that is the world's largest condom manufacturer, in a
campaign to alert the public about ``huge amounts'' of federal
money going to support abstinence-only education.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Wagoner, whose organization works to increase the opportunities
for youth to make healthy decisions about sexuality, said that
``the biggest threat that we face today in adolescent reproductive
health ... is political.''
<p>
   Saying that 75 percent of teenagers have had sex by the age of
18 and that 98 percent of Americans support sexual education in
schools, Wagoner claimed ``there's not a single, credible
peer-reviewed study that shows that abstinence-only works''
toprevent teen preegnancy.
<p>
   On the contrary, he said, extensive studies by the World Health
Organization show that programs promoting both postponement and
protected sex were more effective than abstinence-only programs.
<p>
   Wagoner urged the Clinton administration to protect reproductive
health services for teen schools and condom availability programs.
<p>
   Instead, of Congress ``hijacking'' adolescent reproductive
health policy and leading the public ``down the road of denial,''
Wagoner said, ``the political leadership needs to step up to the
plate and take advantage of the potential golden opportunity for
progress in the area.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 27:
<p>
   The thick smoke spreading throughout Southeast Asia apparently
claimed 234 more lives on Friday, when an Indonesian airliner lost
its way in the haze and crashed. The smoke, coming from forest
fires on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Indonesian part
of Borneo, now blankets Singapore, Brunei, and parts of Malaysia,
the Philippines, and Thailand.
<p>
   The fires are accelerated by drought but were set by man. In its
headlong rush to cut down its timber and sell it, Asia has saddled
itself with the worst deforestation problem of any continent.
Environmentalists have long warned of the consequences. Asian
leaders have dismissed the critics as subversives inspired by the
West to try to stop Southeast Asia's dazzling economic growth. But
while previous fires have not persuaded governments to halt
deforestation, Asia's leaders should now realize that growth is
fleeting when based on the wanton destruction of natural resources.
<p>
   The Indonesian government has attributed previous fires to
farmers clearing their land for crops. This time, because the fires
have been burning for months and satellite data is being made
public, the government has been forced to acknowledge that the
fires coincide mainly with areas of commercial logging on Borneo
and Sumatra.
<p>
   Indigenous farmers use the same environmentally sound farming
methods they have for centuries, rotating between plots of family
land. The problem is the logging companies, which often show up
unannounced, cut the trees, burn the stumps, and set up plantations
of oil palms or eucalyptus and acacia trees for paper and pulp  &MD; 
usually all without compensating the farmers.
<p>
   To compound the tragedy, the precious tropical hardwood is then
turned into virtual garbage. Most of it is milled into plywood and
particle board, largely used in Japanese construction sites as a
disposable mold for concrete. About 10 percent of Indonesia's
plywood comes to North America, where it is used in construction
and cheap shelving.
<p>
   The export of logs is illegal in Indonesia, so they are milled
first. The plywood trade is a cartel controlled by Mohamad (Bob)
Hasan, a billionaire who is President Suharto's golf partner.
Though the government has vowed to prosecute the companies that set
the fires, the record is not promising. Loggers can pay local
forestry officials to look the other way, and powerful friends of
the Suharto family have remarkably few legal problems.
<p>
   Indonesia is not alone. Deforestation is more pronounced on the
Malaysian part of Borneo, and is widespread in Cambodia, Thailand,
and other countries. In Indonesia, however, the devastation of
commercial logging is compounded by the government's policy of
subsidizing migration, which until 1986 was supported by the World
Bank. Farmers from the crowded island of Java are encouraged to
move to the forests of Borneo and Sumatra. Unfortunately, they
bring their old techniques, which do not work outside Java's rich
volcanic soil and are eating up the forest.
<p>
   Some good can come of these tragic fires if they persuade
Southeast Asia and the nations that import their products to take
forest protection seriously. The United States should begin by
banning plywood made of tropical hardwood, or requiring
country-of-origin labeling on wood products so consumers can refuse
to buy them. Japan, often the buyer of products created by ruinous
environmental practices, also needs to rethink its import policies.
In the end, however, Southeast Asia's environmental practices will
not greatly improve until corruption and authoritarianism diminish.
There is too much money to be made by powerful people, and too
little attention paid to those groups trying to bring sanity to
reckless growth.

 &UR; IRKING U.S., YELTSIN SIGNS LAW PROTECTING ORTHODOX CHURCH &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Spurning appeals from the United States, President
Boris Yeltsin signed a new law Friday that protects the Russian
Orthodox Church from competition with other Christian faiths.
<p>
   Western church leaders deplored the law, saying it threatens
religious freedom in Russia.
<p>
   Yeltsin's move was also a setback for the Clinton
administration. During talks this week in Moscow, Vice President Al
Gore had put his prestige on the line by imploring Russian leaders
to modify the bill, but no sooner had he left Moscow than the upper
house unanimously approved it. And Friday the Kremlin put out a
terse announcement saying Yeltsin had signed the bill into law.
<p>
   The law creates a hierarchy of religious groups, with the
Russian Orthodox Church firmly ensconced in the first and most
privileged category while rival Christian groups are afforded a
secondary status.
<p>
   Having failed to persuade Yeltsin to veto or amend the law, the
administration is now trying to influence how it is administered.
<p>
   ``We regret the fact that President Yeltsin chose to sign this
law,'' said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``We
intend to watch very closely how it is implemented and whether
Russia lives up to its international commitments on freedom of
religion and respects the rights of religious minorities.''
<p>
   The Senate has passed a spending bill that would cut $200
million in aid to Russia in six months if the law proves to
discriminate against minority religions. A House-Senate conference
committee will consider the measure as early as next week, and it
is expected to eventually win the support of both houses.
<p>
   Carrying out the law will largely be left up to the local
authorities, making it likely that religious tolerance will vary
greatly from region to region. Regulations specifying how the law
is to be applied have yet to be written, and religious groups are
also likely to challenge the restrictions in court.
<p>
   Critics acknowledge that some Western European nations have
state religions. But Russia's constitution prohibits a state
religion.
<p>
   The Vatican warned Friday that the legislation could lead to
discrimination against minority religions. So did the archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. George Carey, who is the leader of the
Anglican Church.
<p>
   ``It is the most sweeping legislative rollback of human rights
since the birth of post-Soviet Russia,'' said Lawrence Uzzell,
representative here of the Keston Institute, which monitors
religious freedom in the former Communist countries of Europe.
<p>
   The dispute has its roots in the upsurge of religious activity
following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Catholics, Mormons,
mainline and evangelical Protestants and non-Christian religious
sects sought to minister to Russians' spiritual needs.
<p>
   That distressed the Russian Orthodox Church, which was
determined to maintain its dominance and to squash challenges from
dissidents in its own ranks. The church's tacit support of Yeltsin
during the 1996 election campaign also enhanced its political
influence, and it began to campaign for a new law.
<p>
   In June, Parliament passed a bill that created a two-tier
system: One consisted of groups that were registered 15 years ago,
which have full rights and privileges, and the other comprised the
remaining groups, which have second-class status.
<p>
   President Clinton sent a letter to Yeltsin expressing concerns
about the legislation. To the relief of the United States, Yeltsin
vetoed the original measure.
<p>
   But while Washington shifted its attention to other issues, the
Russian Orthodox Church continued its campaign, appealing to a
nationalist and sympathetic Parliament.
<p>
   Some Western officials believe that the administration attached
too much importance to Yeltsin's initial veto, underestimated the
political strength of the Orthodox Church and failed to use the
summer months to influence the terms of the new legislation that
was bound to follow.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Last week, the issue was pushed toward the top of the
administration's agenda when the lower house of Russia's Parliament
adopted a similar law by a vote of 358-6. Many Christian groups in
the United States were outraged.
<p>
   The bill passed two days before Gore was scheduled to arrive in
Moscow for talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
<p>
   Gore, who has touted his personal rapport with Chernomyrdin,
pressed Russian leaders to modify the bill. He said that the
religious issue was the first item of business in his Moscow talks
and that Chernomyrdin had an ``open mind'' on the matter. But even
as Gore wound up his talks, the Kremlin signaled that it no
interest in a compromise.
<p>
   Under the new law, religious organizations, like the Russian
Orthodox Church, that the authorities certify as having been active
15 or more years ago qualify for full rights and privileges. Jewish
and Islamic organizations are also included.
<p>
   Those organizations would have the right to own property,
control radio and television stations and distribute religious
literature. They would be entitled to tax exemptions and could
conduct services in hospitals and cemeteries.
<p>
   But religions organizations that do not satisfy the 15-year rule
would see their activities restricted. They would be able to carry
out financial transactions and conduct charity work, but they would
not have the right to operate schools, distribute religious
literature or invite foreigners to work as clergy or preachers.
<p>
   A third category of religious groups  &MD;  those that choose not to
register and whose registration is not accepted  &MD;  would be subject
to more stringent restrictions.
<p>
   Russian officials insist that the new law is needed to safeguard
Russians against fanatical groups and dangerous sects. Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov even told U.S. diplomats that the law
would discourage ``mass suicides,'' like those of the Heaven's Gate
cult in California.
<p>
   Patriarch Aleksy, II, the leader of the Orthodox Church, praised
the new law. ``Today's law is another step toward perfecting the
legislation that secures and defends the rights of Russia's
believers,'' he said.
<p>
   But critics say it will hamper the activities of mainstream
religious groups. Methodists, for instance, would not satisfy the
15-year rule and therefore would not be able to sell or give away
religious literature or run schools.

<p>
   CRUM, W.Va.  &MD;  When states face their first major test of
welfare-to-work Tuesday, Jerry and Kim Sturgell will not be one of
the success stories. Jerry Sturgell has a hole in his heart, and
his wife can't find a decent job. ``We'd rather be workin' than
drawin', but it's not so easy around here,'' Kim Sturgell said last
week.
<p>
   West Virginia is about to flunk its initial ``work
participation'' test for two-parent families, in part because
America's economic boom is not so loud in backwoods Appalachia, but
in part because most states are going to flunk. This wide gap
between the goals set by Congress and the progress made by families
like the Sturgells suggests that welfare reform will be a lot
harder than policymakers thought.
<p>
   By Tuesday, states are supposed to have 75 percent of their
two-parent caseload working 35 hours a week, and Iowa is the only
state sure to make it. A few others have a chance if rules are
interpreted in their favor. Most states, from California to Rhode
Island, are not even close; they could be docked up to 5 percent of
their federal welfare grants.
<p>
   West Virginia welfare officials estimate that less than 30
percent of their two-parent families do the required 35 hours of
``workfare,'' so they could lose as much as $5.5 million in federal
money. But the officials say that proves less about the
effectiveness of West Virginia's reforms than it does about the
silliness of Washington's goals. The Clinton administration is
already hinting that it may take a lenient approach to the test
this year.
<p>
   ``These are totally unreasonable expectations,'' said Sharon
Paterno, director of the state Office of Family Support. ``They
reflect this public perception that we can just snap our fingers
and make everyone go to work tomorrow. I'm sorry, but there needs
to be a healthy dose of realism.''
<p>
   Most states say they will meet the work participation
requirement for all welfare recipients, which starts at 25 percent
this year and rises to 50 percent by 2002. Even West Virginia has a
chance. But states are furious that they could be docked for
failing to meet such an ambitious goal for two-parent families, who
make up only 7 percent of the nation's welfare population.
<p>
   Federal officials say it is fair and sensible to expect at least
one of two parents who live together to work full-time outside the
home; in fact, the participation goal will jump to 90 percent in
1999. They point out that many experts see the lack of affordable
child care for single parents as the key problem of
welfare-to-work, and two-parent families have an obvious solution.
<p>
   Still, the experience of rural West Virginia points out other
potential welfare-to-work obstacles, including insufficient
transportation, health care, job skills, or jobs themselves. On the
other hand, the West Virginia case also shows how a test focusing
more on families working while on the rolls than on families
leaving the rolls may not be a fair assessment of welfare reform.
<p>
   ``The states are very concerned about this test, and we
understand their concerns,'' said federal welfare spokesman Michael
Kharfen. ``Welfare reform is just getting up and running. We don't
expect to have all the answers today.''
<p>
   In the brave new world of welfare reform, Kim Sturgell sits in
jail 15 hours a week. Actually, it's not really jail; it's a tiny
holding cell in Kermit City Hall, converted into a police dispatch
office. Sturgell answers phones, tidies up, does whatever the cops
need done. She doesn't get paid for her work, but she does get to
keep her $312-a-month welfare benefits.
<p>
   The Sturgells began drawing benefits in 1995, when Jerry, a
carpenter, was denied disability payments after open-heart surgery.
Kim Sturgell looked for work, but most jobs with health benefits
around here are in manufacturing, and the state has lost 35,000 of
those jobs since 1980. The mines now produce more coal than ever,
but with mechanization they need fewer workers with more training.
<p>
   The Sturgells own their home, up a two-mile-long dirt road along
Marrow Bone Creek, and they own a car. But Sturgell says she cannot
afford to give up the security of welfare and Medicaid for a
minimum-wage job at a convenience store, not when her husband is
sick. If she leaves the rolls, her family will only be guaranteed
health benefits for six months.
<p>
   ``I want to go back to school, but the rules say I have to work,
and I can't work without benefits,'' she said. ``So I'm working
without pay.''
<p>
   Under the sweeping reform legislation enacted in August 1996,
states were given control over their welfare programs, but must
meet federal standards such as the 75 percent rule. In West
Virginia, the reforms require all families to find some form of
work within two years or face the loss of benefits. In all states,
families are limited to five years of lifetime benefits, regardless
of whether they work or not.
<p>
   West Virginia cannot count Sturgell toward the 75 percent target
because she only works 15 hours a week, splitting her job with
Ethel Brewer, another married mother of two children. Brewer also
landed on welfare when her husband, a truck driver, was denied
disability benefits; he hurt his back five years ago and has not
worked since.
<p>
   Unlike Sturgell, though, Brewer would accept a minimum-wage job
with no benefits. She just can't find one, even though she has
applied to fast-food joints an hour down the road. West Virginia's
unemployment rate is 6 percent, the lowest it has been in years but
still well above the national average. Wayne County's rate is
closer to 10 percent. In the ``hollers'' near the Kentucky border,
the hollowed-out hills littered with rusty trailers, it could be 50
percent.
<p>
   ``I don't know what to do,'' Brewer said. ``I got no real
experience, and even if I did, there's nothing around here.''
<p>
   Still, the state has made progress moving families off welfare
since its West Virginia Works program began in nine counties in
January; it goes statewide Oct. 1. The changes are modest compared
to reforms in other states, but caseloads in those counties dropped
44 percent in the first six months. In more than a third of those
cases, the families left the rolls for employment.
<p>
   Tina and Tim, a Crum couple with five children who did not want
their last name used, are a real success story. Tim had a
$1-an-hour workfare job at an automotive shop, preserving his
welfare check. But then he landed a $5.25-an-hour job with health
benefits at a plastic bag factory an hour away, and found a
co-worker with a car who could pick him up at 4:30 a.m.
<p>
   The problem is, Tina and Tim no longer count toward the state's
75 percent goal, because they're no longer on welfare.
<p>
   Clinton has been bragging about nationwide reductions in
caseloads, and his aides say they will be taken into account when
they score the state workfare tests. But no one is sure how.
<p>
   Similarly, the Clinton aides say they do not intend to punish
states that encourage parents to stay together. But critics say
that by holding married couples to a higher standard, the workfare
test could revive the perverse incentives welfare reform was
supposed to erase.
<p>
   ``The whole test is ludicrous,'' said Dee Dee Simoneau, director
of the state's Welfare Reform Coalition. ``Are they really going to
take away our money? Those funds could be used to help get people
jobs, or get them trained, or get them a ride to work. You can't
fix 60 years of bad policy overnight.''
<p>
   In 1994, the Clinton administration waived all penalties it was
supposed to assess 40 states that failed to reach a less stringent
work participation goal, and many expect history to repeat itself
this year. But welfare reform is not going to get any easier in the
future. The families leaving welfare these days are better
educated, better trained and better equipped for the workforce than
the families still left on the rolls. And even in isolated trailer
towns like Kermit and Crum, the economy is better than it has been
in years.
<p>
   ``I worry about what will happen if the economy goes bad,'' Kim
Sturgell said. ``You know, for her homework the other night, my
8-year-old had to list three ways her community is going to change
over the next five years. The first thing she wrote was: less jobs.
And I couldn't really argue with her.''

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Ernest J. Parham, whose riveting account of one of
the century's most appalling racial atrocities prompted the Florida
Legislature to provide the survivors a measure of compensation more
than 70 years after the fact, died last Saturday at a hospital near
his home in Orlando. He was 93.
<p>
   Even seven decades later it was fairly obvious that something
had happened in the little town of Rosewood, Fla., in the first
week of 1923. After all, when an angry mob of armed white men
invades a black community, kills half a dozen of the 120 residents
and chases the rest away  &MD;  burning the entire town to the ground to
make sure they don't come back  &MD;  it is hard to imagine that someone
will not remember.
<p>
   But more than half a century and a revolution in racial
attitudes later, when the survivors told their stories to state
legislators in a quest for compensation, there was a problem.
<p>
   There was nothing except their accounts to support their claim
that state and county authorities had known about the attack and
had done nothing to stop it.
<p>
   Since all the witnesses were black survivors with a vested
interest, the Legislature, while generally sympathetic to their
appeal, was reluctant to act on their word alone.
<p>
   Then a panel of historians from the University of Florida
appointed to look into the matter were led to Parham and what he
had to say in 1994 turned the tide.
<p>
   Although he moved to Orlando in 1926 and operated a successful
laundry there for many years, in 1923 Parham, then 18, was living
and working at the company store in Sumner, Fla., a sawmill town 35
miles southwest of Gainesville and just three miles from Rosewood.
<p>
   As he told it under oath to a legislative hearing in 1994, when
word got around on New Year's Day that a hunt was on for Jesse
Hunter, a black man said to have escaped from a chain gang and to
have raped a white woman in Sumner, Parham closed the store early
and drove off to investigate.
<p>
   After meeting up with Clarence Williams, a deputy sheriff who
lived at a hotel run by Parham's stepfather, Parham said he came
upon a band of white men who had surrounded Sam Carter, a Rosewood
man they believed had given Hunter a ride in his wagon.
<p>
   As the deputy hung back, Parham said, he watched as one of the
white men repeatedly tightened a noose around Carter's neck, lifted
him onto his toes and beat him in the chest, demanding that he tell
where he had dropped Hunter off and warning that he would be killed
if the dogs didn't pick up the scent at the spot he pointed out.
<p>
   ``The dogs did not pick up the trail, and they shot him,'' said
Parham, who refused to identify the man out of consideration for
his children.
<p>
   Carter was the first victim of what became known as the Rosewood
Massacre, but although Parham was able to describe many of the
later events, including the burning of Rosewood on Jan. 5, he was
not a witness.
<p>
   Indeed, on the night of Jan. 4, when two white men trying to
force their way into a Rosewood house were fatally shot by the
black residents inside, touching off the vengeful raid that left
the town in ashes the next night, Parham was snug inside his
stepfather's hotel in Sumner, sitting in front of the lobby
fireplace.
<p>
   Still, it was his account of what happened in the lobby that
night that provided critical evidence the Legislature needed to
establish that the authorities had known about the events in
Rosewood and made no effort to intervene, justifying its decision
to provide $2.1 million to compensate the handful of Rosewood
survivors.
<p>
   Among those gathered around the hotel fireplace, Parham said,
was the deputy sheriff, Clarence Williams.
<p>
   ``The fire started cracking,'' Parham testified, ``and Clarence
Williams said, `All hell is breaking lose in Rosewood.' ''
<p>
   Then, according to Parham, the deputy went to bed.
<p>
   ``We wondered,'' Parham added, ``why he would not have been up
there as a law officer to take care of the situation.''
<p>
   Some wondered why Parham had waited so long to tell his story,
but his answer only served to underscore the fact that the state
authorities had not only failed to protect Rosewood residents from
a marauding mob but also for 70 years had made no effort to seek
justice for them.
<p>
   ``Nobody asked me,'' he said.
<p>
   Parham is survived by a daughter, Margaret Gandy, of Tampa; a
brother, Leslie, of Tallahassee; five grandchildren; and eight
great-grandchildren.

SALES OF EXISTING HOMES IN L.A. COUNTY JUMP 15.8 PERCENT &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
BY BEN SULLIVAN &QC; 
c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  In further proof of Southern California's
rebounding economy, sales of existing homes in Los Angeles County
rose 15.8 percent in August compared to the like period a year ago,
a trade group reported Friday.
<p>
   That growth outpaced a statewide August increase of 14.1
percent, according to figures released by the California
Association of Realtors.
<p>
   Sales activity during August in Los Angeles was down 4 percent
from July but up 4.6 percent statewide. The drop for Los Angeles
was ``normal seasonal behavior,'' said G.U. Krueger, an economist
for the association.
<p>
   ``The numbers to really look at are the county's increase of
15.8 percent, which is pretty much in line with what's happening
statewide,'' he said.
<p>
   August sales in Ventura County were up 0.3 percent from July,
and 21.5 percent from August 1996.
<p>
   Prices of existing Los Angeles homes showed a healthy increase
both month-to-month and compared to 1996, with the median price
reaching $181,650 in August. That was up 3.3 percent from July, and
5.4 percent from August 1996. In Ventura County, the median price
for an existing home in August was $228,860, up 2.7 percent from
July and 9.1 percent from a year earlier.
<p>
   Statewide, the median price of an existing California home was
$194,390 in August, up 7.5 percent over the 1996 period.
<p>
   In a separate study of prices for both new and existing homes,
the San Fernando Valley showed growth across the board in August,
with a 1.7 percent increase in the West Valley, a 1 percent
increase in the Northeast Valley and a 4.1 percent increase in the
Southeast Valley. Year-to-year, however, the Northeast Valley still
showed a drop in median home value, from $132,000 in August 1996 to
$128,750 in August 1997.
<p>
   ``The Valley as a whole had been negative, with prices coming
down until very recently,'' Krueger said. Price appreciation is
returning, he said, but has yet to reach all areas. ``We're hoping
the Northeast will join in soon.''
<p>
   Prices for new and used homes in Ventura County were mixed in
August, rising 11.3 percent in Thousand Oaks, but dropping 9.1
percent in Westlake Village compared to August 1996.
<p>
   The price gains underscore the market's improved climate.
Analysts believe price hikes are crucial to convince potential
homebuyers to overcome fears of another recession in real estate.

MARRIED-PROFESSIONALS-CLR, 9-26 -- For Deborah Roberts of
``20/20,'' and her husband, Al Roker of ``The Today Show,'' it's
free speech at home, mum at the office. ``There are times that
Deborah has said, 'Barbara Walters has a big interview with this
one or that one,' and it never occurs to me to mention it to
anyone,'' says Roker. ``If we have somebody coming on 'The Today

   (NYT18) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN-CLR,
9-26 -- Sen. John McCain, right, R-Ariz., listens Friday as the
Senate opens debate on rewriting the country's campaign-finance
laws, arguing about whether there was too much or too little money
in the system now and about what kind of changes could be made
without violating the First Amendment. But after more than five
hours of often impassioned debate, there was agreement on virtually
nothing by anyone. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT17) SLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. -- Sept. 26, 1997 --
GM-PLANT-REVAMP-CLR, 9-26 -- A General Motors plant on the Hudson
in Sleepy Hollow, formerly North Tarrytown, closed last year. GM
has proposed transforming the factory into a luxurious development,
but the village is saying the automaker's glittery plan may be too
ambitious. ``I think General Motors came in with the deluxe luxury
model, and we're more of a community looking for a midsize,'' says
Mayor Sean Treacy. (Susan Farley/New York Times Photo)

MOSCOW-CIRCUS-U.S.-2-CLR, 9-26 -- Vyacheslav Zolkin and his

the Moscow Circus. The animals are groomed daily and trained to
keep in practice while the circus re-organizes. (Andrew Itkoff/New

   (NYT15) ORLANDO, Fla. -- Sept. 26, 1997 --
MOSCOW-CIRCUS-U.S.-1-CLR, 9-26 -- Sergei Tolstikhin, ringmaster and
interpreter for the non-English-speaking Moscow Circus. ``This is
about a great circus, that's what we're trying to preserve,'' says
Tolstikhin. It took about $400,000 just to bring the circus and its
equipment to the United States, but poor ticket sales forced the
company out of business within weeks and they have to stand guard
by their 120-foot tent to keep creditors from hauling it away.

-- Dr. Len Soucy, president of the Raptor Trust, releases a
rehabilitated red-tailed hawk in Central Park on Friday amidst a
crowd of spectators. The hawk had eaten a poisoned pidgeon in May
and has spent the last four months being nursed back to health by
the Trust. (Carrie Boretz/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT13) ASFORDBY, England -- Sept. 26, 1997 --
BRITAIN-MINERS-POLITICS-CLR, 9-26 -- Britain's most modern coal
mine is closing down - under a Labor government. Three miners -
from left, Ian Riley, Mark Hunt and James Porch - are among those
losing their jobs, despite a plea to the prime minister. (Jonathan

   (NYT12) DEDHAM, Mass. -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- GARDNER-ARTTHEFT-CLR,
9-26 -- William Youngworth III, shown outside the Massachusetts
court where he is being tried on theft charges, claims that he can
locate up to $300 million worth of masterpieces stolen from the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here more than seven years ago. In
return, Youngworth seeks the $5 million reward, immunity from
prosecution and the early release from prison of his karate teacher
and mentor, Myles J. Connor Jr. (Kirsten Elstner/New York Times

SHEARMADNESS-LONGRUN-CLR, 9-26 -- Bruce Jordan and Marilyn Abrams,
producers of ``Shear Madness,'' which has become the nation's
longest-running nonmusical play. The show celebrated its 10th
anniversary this week, has been seen here by nearly 1.5 million
people. (Amy Thompson/New York Times Photo)
<p>
   (NYT10) HONG KONG -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT., 28
-- RUBIN-ASIA-2-CLR, 9-26 -- There is much to discuss on Day 2 of
the IMF-World Bank meeting. Treasury Secretary Rubin, seated right,
gathers his advisers for a late night post-mortem. ``We can
properly be faulted for vastly underinvesting in our relationships
with Chinese officials up and down the line,'' he says, claiming
it's no surprise that ``we keep having such a hard time
understanding each other.'' (Robert Grossman/New York Times Photo)
<p>
   (NYT9) BEIJING -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT., 28 --
RUBIN-ASIA-1-CLR, 9-26 -- Like the Great Wall, the issues facing
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on his 10-day trip through Asia
seemingly went on forever. ``When I was at Goldman, there weren't
enough commercial transactions in China to even justify a trip'' he
says, referring to his 26 years at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. (Mark
Leong/New York Times Photo) *LITE
<p>
   (NYT8) SAN FRANCISCO -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- INVEST-CONFERENCE-CLR,
9-26 -- Greta and Tom Sherby watch Theresa Ogas' rope tricks at the
annual investment conference of Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. Montgomery's growth stock index is up 47 percent since
it bottomed out in April. At last year's conference, which followed
a summer decline, money managers were slapping one another on the
back with far less frequency at the quote machines, several in
attendance recalled. (Anne Dowie/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT7) NEW YORK -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT., 28 --
SPEND-COLLEGE-GUIDES-CLR, 9-26 -- Jan Miyake, a graduate student,
reviews guides at a Barnes &AMP; Noble in Manhattan. In a yearly
college guide poll of freshmen at the College of Wooster in
Wooster, Ohio, more than three-quarters of those surveyed said they
relied on these handbooks. Of those, almost 90 percent said they
used two or three guides. (Carol Halebian/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 15, 1997 -- SAFE-SEX-COX-CLR, 9-25 --
Actress Jane Fonda teams up with Advocates for Youth on Friday to
launch the group's national campaign, ``Let's Talk Month.'' Ms.
Fonda and the Advocates for Youth denounced recent trends in U.S.
public health policy that they say may threaten the decline in the
U.S. teen birth rate. (Rick McKay/Cox News Service Photo)

   (NYT5) JERUSALEM -- Sept. 25, 1997 -- ISRAEL-OLDCITY-COX-CLR,
9-25 -- Yossi Baumol, the 44-year-old Brooklyn native who is
executive director of the Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva, stands atop one
of the Yeshiva's buildings in Jerusalem's Old City. The Dome of the
Rock, one of Islam's most holy sites, is visible the background.

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT., 28 --
NY-TEENS-CLR, 9-26 -- Music is everything for Marissa Bregman and
her friends Carlton DeWoody, center, and Nick Raynes. Teen-agers
may grow up faster in New York than anywhere else in the country.
They may be more jaded, and more likely to see their street fashion
and their language translated into the popular culture. But
wherever they congregate, they fight a constant battle against
crushing boredom and curfews. (Norman Y. Lono/New York Times Photo)
<p>
   (NYT3) SAGAPONACK, N.Y. -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN.,
SEPT., 28 -- VONNEGUT-BOOK-CLR, 9-26 -- Kurt Vonnegut says his book
``Timequake'' is his last. Really. ``This is just sort of a coda on
my career,'' he says. ``Self-indulgent, really. But my God, I
finished it. It's like being in the marathon. I finished 211th. But
I finished.'' (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo) *LITE
<p>
   (NYT2) MUTTONTOWN, N.Y. -- Sept. 26, 1997 -- ADV. FOR SUN.,
SEPT., 28 -- INVEST-IPO-FRIENDLY-CLR, 9-26 -- At a Friendly's in
Muttontown, the children of Patty O'Malley - Maureen, left, 15
months; Sean, 8, and Megan, 4 - enjoy the treats that give the
chain a strong brand name in the Northeast. Sometime next month,
Friendly's parent, the Friendly Ice Cream Corp. of Wilbraham,
Mass., wants to sell five million shares - or 67 percent of its
company - for $19 to $21 apiece. (Vic DeLucia/New York Times Photo)

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Peter Jennings and Seymour Hersh have ears full of
cider.
<p>
   They did not follow the Sky Masterson rule: ``One of these days
... a guy is going to offer to bet you that he can make the jack of
spades jump out of this brand-new deck of cards and squirt cider in
your ear. But, son, do not accept this bet, because as sure as you
stand there, you're going to wind up with an ear full of cider.''
<p>
   Jennings and Hersh fell for some hokum about newly discovered
documents, including one ``agreement'' showing that Jack Kennedy
tried to keep Marilyn Monroe quiet about their rumored affair by
promising to give her mother a $600,000 trust fund. How on earth
did these two geniuses believe for a second that Kennedy would put
something like that on paper?
<p>
   It would seem Jennings and Hersh, who were working on a
documentary based on Hersh's upcoming book, ``The Dark Side of
Camelot,'' could have figured out sometime and many millions ago
that the typewriter used to type the 1960 Monroe ``contract'' was a
model made after 1970. And that another letter dated 1961 had a ZIP
code, even though ZIP codes were not announced until 1962.
<p>
   The poor shnooks. Why didn't they call me? I live in a federal
house John Kennedy lived in from 1951 until he was elected to the
Senate in 1952. Only the other day I was poking under some
floorboards and found an old shoebox filled with ``Dear Jack''
letters! Immediately I called my agent! Here is some of what I
read:
<p>
   Dear Jack,
<p>
   Those other letters I wrote to you were fakes. This one is
really, really written personally by I, and it is really, really
valuable. You can tell, can't you? Cause this is written in my
lipstick, the one called ``Carnal'' that you sent me from Barneys!
<p>
   Marilyn
<p>
   Dear President Kennedy:
<p>
   I wanted to thank you for sending me that picture of us shaking
hands at the Boys Nation event. I'm sorry if my hand was a little
moist.
<p>
   Call me a blue goose, but I have a feeling that someday I might
need to document this moment with the greatest possible clarity. So
I'm just wondering if you could have the White House photographers
look through their negatives and see if there's another shot of our
handshake where you look a whole lot more interested in what I'm
saying?
<p>
   Really, really sincerely,
<p>
   Billy Clinton
<p>
   Dear Jack:
<p>
   Thank you for that note about how your father did, in fact, buy
you the election. My therapist says that will help a great deal
with my woundedness, my battle to be heard and loved, and my
struggle to get closure on my obsession with you. My therapist says
I have a right to be happy.
<p>
   Best wishes,
<p>
   Dick Nixon
<p>
   Dear Mr. President,
<p>
   Call off Giancana. My beard isn't falling out, but my cigars are
exploding. You can reach me at www.commie.com.
<p>
   Fidel
<p>
   Jack,
<p>
   Gone to Baby Gap and Starbucks. Won't be home too late.
<p>
   Jackie
<p>
   Dear Mr. President,
<p>
   Thank you for your participation in last week's Barneys
breakfast on ``Public Figures, Private Lives.'' Wasn't Mailer a
bore?
<p>
   Respectfully,
<p>
   Harry Evans
<p>
   Shatzi dear,
<p>
   First your father. Now you. Falling in love again. Never vanted
to. Vhat am I to do? Can't help it.
<p>
   Your blue angel,
<p>
   Marlene
<p>
   Dear Mr. President:
<p>
   Maybe serving in Vietnam is making me paranoid, but I think a
lot of people are out to get you. Watch out for Nixon, LBJ,
Goldwater, the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, shady Cubans, New Orleans
homosexuals, the Cigarette Man, the military-industrial complex and
the cruel media. Those guys play rough.
<p>
   The truth is out there,
<p>
   Oliver Stone
<p>
   Dear Jack:
<p>
   I wonder if you could put in a good word for me with Jackie. I'm
just dying to borrow that slinky fuchsia Oleg Cassini she was
wearing the other night. Also, you forgot to return the King file.
<p>
   Ominously yours,
<p>
   J. Edgar Hoover
<p>
   The dark side of Camelot!

   Wooden stakes, burning castles, silver bullets. Abuse them as
you will, you just can't keep a good monster down.
<p>
   So no surprise that five of Hollywood's primal horrors return to
life Tuesday when they join the ranks of other great Americans as
faces on U.S. postal stamps. The 32-cent stamps go on sale
nationwide Wednesday.
<p>
   The Phantom of the Opera, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the
Mummy and the Wolf Man all get their day in the sun  &MD;  though they
are sure to feel uncomfortable there.
<p>
   Also honored are the four actors who brought these horror heroes
to screen fame: Bela Lugosi (Dracula), Boris Karloff
(Frankenstein's monster and the Mummy), Lon Chaney (the Phantom)
and Lon Chaney Jr. (Wolf Man).
<p>
   The actors' pictures  &MD;  without scary makeup  &MD;  and their
signatures are on the border of the full pane of 20 stamps. That
makes the sheet of stamps a pretty nifty collectors' item for
anyone who wants to frame it.
<p>
   Fittingly, the Classic Movie Monsters, as this stamp series is
called, all come from Universal, the studio that did the most to
begin and maintain the Hollywood movie monster tradition for
decades.
<p>
   Why are movie monsters honored on U.S. stamps? Each year the
Postal Service receives more than 40,000 citizen suggestions and
chooses 25 to 30 subjects for new stamps. Many fans requested
stamps of the horror stars, and the demand increased when Famous
Monsters of Filmland, a magazine, encouraged its readers to write
the Postal Service.
<p>
   ``Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney Jr. are very, very loved,'' said
Famous Monsters publisher Ray Ferry. ``They belong to three
generations. The baby boomers are wanting to celebrate the simpler,
less gory horror films of their youth.''
<p>
   For the Postal Services historical series, the main criteria is
that the stamp is relevant to U.S. history. And the Universal
monsters certainly had a major impact on what has become an
important American art form: movies.
<p>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
<p>
   Universal began the cycle in 1925, when Lon Chaney, one of the
great stars of the silent age (his parents were deaf-mutes) donned
the mask of the deformed and love-smitten Erik, the Phantom of the
Opera.
<p>
   Silent and in black and white, except for a few key scenes in
two-color Technicolor, the film was a big-budget, first-class
production, and Chaney, a master craftsman, played the Phantom like
the Phantom played the organ.
<p>
   As would be true with most of the great Universal horror films
over the next decade, pathos was a bigger ingredient than gore.
Chaney knew how to milk it, making viewers afraid, yet sympathetic
to author Gaston Leroux's tragic character.
<p>
   Still available on video and laser, the original ``The Phantom
of the Opera'' may be slow and tame by modern standards, but there
are some elaborate set pieces and, for those willing to get into
the spirit of the times, plenty of shock when Chaney's destroyed
face is revealed.

<p>
   But it remained for ``Frankenstein'' and ``Dracula,'' both in
1931, to really turn America on to movie monsters.
<p>
   Lugosi was a Hungarian character actor of little note until he
played Bram Stoker's undead anti-hero on Broadway in 1927. With his
unnatural, stiff acting style and Eastern European accent, he was
perfect for the era's idea of a sophisticated yet bizarre Count.
<p>
   The movie, never really great, is best now as a delightfully
quaint curiosity. It starts well and eerily but eventually sputters
out, yet it is atmospheric at times and set the tone for sequels
and copies for decades to come.
<p>
   Amazingly, though Lugosi is still the actor most associated with
Dracula, he didn't play Dracula again until 1948's ``Abbott and
Costello Meet Frankenstein.'' More than 50 movies have been
produced with ``Dracula'' in the title.
<p>
   After ``Dracula's'' success, Universal rushed another Gothic
book into service, and before the year was out, Karloff was
lumbering across the cinema landscape as Dr. Frankenstein's
monster.
<p>
   Karloff, an actor of real talents, was already beginning to find
success. But ``Frankenstein'' typecast him beyond hope of
redemption from the horror genre. It made him famous, though, and
he made the most of it for decades in dozens of films, including
several ``Frankenstein'' sequels.
<p>
   Only generally faithful to Mary Shelley's story, it nonetheless
set a high standard, making the monster hugely scary (audiences
were a lot easier to spook in those days) yet more sympathetically
human than his tormentors.
<p>
   Karloff, in Universal's stylized, brilliant makeup, made it all
work while hardly uttering a sound or, seemingly, moving a facial
muscle. (He would top himself in the even better ``Bride of
Frankenstein'' in 1935.) Karloff created a second memorable villain
the next year in another first-rate Universal horror film.
<p>
   ``The Mummy'' is not as famous or as frequently shown, but it's
an excellent film and a wonderful piece of weirdness, hokum and
adventure as an ancient Egyptian murder victim is revived in modern
times. Again, Karloff gives his monster a sympathetic depth.
<p>
   Universal had already done a wolf man story in 1935, but it made
its classic in 1941, when character actor Lon Chaney Jr. was
convinced to follow in his dad's more eccentric footsteps.
<p>
   As an Americanized young Brit, he suffers the dog's bite in
``The Wolf Man.'' Soon, he's feeling the moon's power, and turns
into a dangerous canine creature.
<p>
   Yet another class film, rich on atmosphere and tragedy, it
co-stars Claude Rains. Chaney (whose was not really a junior, his
real name was Creighton Chaney) suffered the same fate as Karloff
and Lugosi: He was typecast in horror films, though he occasionally
did supporting roles in other genres.
<p>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
<p>
   Indirectly honored on the stamps is Jack Pierce, the Universal
make-up master who created the look for Frankenstein's monster, the
Mummy and the Wolf Man seen on the stamps.
<p>
   Conspicuously missing from the list is Universal's 1933 ``The
Invisible Man,'' with Claude Rains. It would have been an excellent
addition, even if Rains would have been hard to see. Then again,
the Invisible Man isn't really a monster.
<p>
   Universal also did the lesser ``Creature From the Black Lagoon''
(1954)  &MD;  no doubt about that being a monster  &MD;  but Ben Chapman and
Ricou Browning, who played Gill-Man on land and in water, hardly
rate as giants of horror, or cinema stars.
<p>
   The families of the four honored stars have worked hard for
several years to get these heroes of horror recognized in several
ways, including on stamps.
<p>
   Expected to be at Tuesday's official dedication of the stamps at
Universal Studios in Hollywood are Karloff's daughter, Sara
Karloff; Lugosi's son, Bela Lugosi; and Ron Chaney, grandson of Lon
Chaney Jr. and great-grandson of Lon Chaney Sr.

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  James Bond, the most durable character in modern
cinema, is returning to the big screen for the 19th time later this
year amid what promises to be a massive marketing campaign.
<p>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has signed up an impressive list of partners
for ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' including the first movie tie-in for
credit card giant Visa International. Actor Pierce Brosnan, the
fifth incarnation of Bond, will appear in television ads in
character as Agent 007 to pitch Visa, marking a departure from
studios' usual pre-release TV spots.
<p>
   Other promotional partners include Avis Rent a Car, Smirnoff
Vodka, Heineken, BMW, Swiss watch maker Omega International and
Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. Omega and BMW
participated in 1995's ``Goldeneye,'' the 18th Bond film, with BMW
debuting its Z3 roadster. The German automaker is rumored to be
rolling out a new model motorcycle in ``Tomorrow Never Dies.''
<p>
   Analysts have noted the Bond franchise is particularly
attractive for high-end advertisers since it offers them the
opportunity to reach an older, wealthier group of moviegoers.
<p>
   MGM began running trailers in early summer for ``Tomorrow Never
Dies,'' due to open Dec. 19 against the Paramount-Fox mega-budget
spectacular ``Titanic.'' ``The buzz so far for `Tomorrow Never
Dies' has been pretty good,'' said Arthur Rockwell, an analyst with
Yaeger Capital Markets and a former MGM executive. ``You would
expect this one to do in the same range as `Goldeneye.'''
<p>
   ``Bond films always have used significant amounts of product
tie-ins,'' the analyst added. ``It's a natural.''
<p>
   MGM took in an impressive $350 million in worldwide theatrical
grosses from ``Goldeneye'' after its release in late 1995. At that
point, MGM's internal woes had kept the Bond series on a six-year
hiatus before Brosnan took over the lead role from Timothy Dalton.
<p>
   The studio released another hit with ``The Birdcage'' early last
year but then mostly closed down production while French bank
Credit Lyonnais auctioned off the studio to Kirk Kerkorian for $1.3
billion. MGM is expected to take advantage of the interest in
``Tomorrow Never Dies'' to launch an initial public offering near
the movie's release date.
<p>
   Rockwell said the studio will need a serious promotional push to
cut through the clutter of holiday-season releases. Besides
``Titanic,'' other strong performers are expected to include Sony's
``Starship Troopers,'' Disney's ``Flubber,'' Universal's
``Jackal,'' 20th Century Fox's ``Alien Resurrection'' and Warner
Bros.' ``The Postman.''
<p>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' expected to cost between $70 million
and $100 million, calls for Bond to prevent media mogul Elliot
Carver (Jonathan Pryce) from starting World War III. The secret
agent is aided by a Chinese spy (Michelle Yeoh) and an
ex-girlfriend who happens to be Carver's wife (Teri Hatcher).
<p>
   ``From what I've heard, this is going to be one of the most
exciting Bond movies,'' said John Cork, editor of Goldeneye, a fan
magazine published by the Burbank-based Ian Fleming Foundation.
(Fleming is the late author who created the Bond character.) ``I
expect there to be a strong level of promotional tie-in activity.''
<p>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' will be the first Bond film without the
involvement of late producer Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli, who died
last year. Daughter Barbara Broccoli and stepson Michael Wilson are
producing.
<p>
   Box office trackers worry ``Titanic'' may grab much of the
audience from ``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' ``Historically, the Bond
franchise has a long and noble history with movies that are
consistently entertaining,'' said Chris Lanier, of the Motion
Picture Intelligencer forecasting service. ``But unless the market
explodes when these two come out, it's a real problem.''
<p>
   Robert Bucksbaum of the Reel Source service said MGM would be
better served if it switched the release date for ``Tomorrow Never
Dies.'' Otherwise, he predicted, it may not be able to duplicate
the $106 million domestic gross for ``Goldeneye,'' particularly if
it's perceived as going over similar ground.
<p>
   ``Sequels have really done awful this year, so it's asking a lot
for this one to do as well, especially against `Titanic,''' he
said.

 &UR; CLINTON PRESSES FOR CHANGE IN CAMPAIGN FINANCING &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  Hours before appearing as the big draw at a $600,000
fund-raising dinner here for the Democratic Party, President
Clinton Friday castigated politicians for not being sincere about
curbing the influence of money in politics and asserted: ``We
desperately need to reform the way we finance our campaigns.''
<p>
   As Senate Republicans opened debate on a campaign finance bill,
Clinton warned in a speech at San Jacinto College southeast of
Houston that the public should be wary of the oratory on Capitol
Hill.
<p>
   ``You hide and watch,'' he said. ``There will be a lot of
efforts to make it look like we're going to do something and
nothing will happen unless we all work hard and demand that
something happen.''
<p>
   Clinton was seeking to speak up for himself and his party during
a week when Republican leaders in Congress have proposed their own
campaign finance remedies  &MD;  and, if anything, stepped up their
attacks on his fund-raising practices last year.
<p>
   The president did not mention that an important purpose of his
trip to Texas Friday was to raise money at a small dinner ($10,000
a head) at the sprawling, gated mansion of Tilman Fertitta, a
restaurant magnate. Events of this type would be significantly
restricted or banned altogether if the legislation he supported
ever were enacted.
<p>
   Clinton also said nothing about the swirl of allegations
surrounding him and Vice President Al Gore concerning their
campaign's preoccupation with raising money last year or about the
decision by Attorney General Janet Reno to consider whether to ask
for an investigation by an independent counsel.
<p>
   In lamenting the way money can affect elections, Clinton could
have been referring to his own campaign drive last year to channel
millions of dollars into television commercials.
<p>
   ``The cost of political campaigns have soared astronomically,
and with it the burden of raising money,'' he said Friday, ``and
with it the questions raised about how much money has to be raised
to run for office and how it's raised.''
<p>
   Rather than speak about his own role, Clinton told his audience
that they should consider their own involvement.
<p>
   ``I ask you all to think about your role in this,'' he told
hundreds of students packed into the gymnasium. ``You might say, on
the one hand, well, `I don't like those people raising all that
money.' And then ask yourself: How many times did you vote for a
candidate who had the best television ads? Or the candidate whose
ads you saw the most?
<p>
   ``Or,'' he continued, ``did you ever vote against someone who
was attacked in a television ad and you never saw another
television ad responding to the attack? So you thought, well, what
they said might be true, I don't want to take any chances.''
<p>
   Clinton, who had threatened to keep Congress in session to
consider a measure to overhaul campaign finance practices, said he
was ``delighted the debate has begun'' over a bill sponsored by
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis. The bill
would, among other things, prohibit unregulated donations to the
state and national parties.
<p>
   ``But I want to say to you,'' Clinton said, ``we have debated
this before. And every time we debate it  &MD;  at least since I have
been president  &MD;  every year we've had a good campaign finance
reform bill before the Senate I have supported it. And every year
it has died under the parliamentary tactic that allows one more
than 40 senators to keep any bill from being voted on  &MD;  called the
filibuster.'' For his part, the president said he had ``worked very
hard'' to change how campaigns are financed.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But many groups that advocate revamping the campaign finance
system have blamed Clinton for passing up efforts in the past to
more aggressively press for legislation.
<p>
   Despite his repudiation of fund-raising practices, Clinton's
appearance at the dinner here was not particularly unusual given
that he has repeatedly attended such events in recent weeks and
months to help pay off the Democratic National Committee's debt of
more than $15 million.
<p>
   In contrast to the pages of material the White House issued that
promoted Clinton's education proposals, officials were mum about
the closed-door fund-raiser here. White House aides released a
one-paragraph statement from the Democratic Party stating that the
menu Friday night was ``Appetizer. Fish. Dessert.'' The statement
also said that guests were asked to contribute ``a minimum of
$10,000'' and that 70 guests were expected.
<p>
   Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, seemed
exasperated when questioned about the latest disclosures involving
the president's past fund-raising activities.
<p>
   ``There is, as we said all along, nothing illegal about the
president or the vice president raising money in pursuit of their
political activities,'' McCurry told reporters. ``We're doing some
of that tonight, as a matter of fact.''
<p>
   A week after dropping off his daughter at Stanford University,
one of the most expensive colleges in the country, Clinton devoted
most of his speech Friday to underscore his commitment to keeping
down the costs of higher education. He touted findings of a new
Education Department report which asserted that his Hope
scholarships would make community colleges free of tuition and fees
for students in seven states. Nationwide, the study found, the
scholarships would cover up to 88 percent of the average full-time
tuition and fees at community colleges.
<p>
   ``Our goal is simple,'' Clinton said. ``By the end of this
century, we want education in a community college like this, the
13th and 14th years of education, to be as universal when we start
the new century as a high school diploma is today.''
<p>
   The president was asked on a radio show this morning whether his
daughter, Chelsea, had called for money yet from Stanford. ``Well,
not for money yet,'' he replied. ``We've talked to her a couple of
times  &MD;  and she's having a good time.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Against the backdrop of mounting fund-raising
scandals, the Democratic National Committee opened a two-day
meeting deep in debt and searching for ways to get its message out
 &MD;  but at a much lower cost than before.
<p>
   More than 600 party officials  &MD;  politicians, state chairmen and
volunteers  &MD;  met in caucuses and planning sessions to devise ways
to expand the party's membership, come up with a vote-getting
message and raise money for the next elections.
<p>
   The Democratic Party is now $15.3 million in debt, largely as a
result of questionable donations it has had to return from the last
election and legal costs to defend itself before Congress. It has
also raised $19 million in the first six months of this year,
according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, with
15 cents of every new dollar dedicated to paying off debt.
<p>
   In an interview, Roy Romer, the Democratic chairman, said the
party would be shifting its focus from big donors  &MD;  it has already
set a $100,000 ceiling on soft-money donations from individuals  &MD; 
and toward soliciting smaller donations from a larger number of
people. ``We've got to go back to broadening the participation in
party activities and making our money less dependent on large
donations,'' Romer said.
<p>
   The reasons for this are both practical and political, he added.
Romer said it was ``healthier'' for the party to rely less on
high-ticket donations, often from large corporations with business
before Congress. Moreover, as Congress begins to consider a ban on
soft money donations  &MD;  money that the party can raise in unlimited
amounts and that is not regulated by federal law  &MD;  a shift to
smaller, individual donations may soon become a necessity.
<p>
   Yet a possible ban on soft-money donations could not come at a
worse time for the Democratic Party because of its large debt.
Should a ban be enacted before the party's debt is eliminated, it
will be even harder to erase this shortfall with only small
donations.
<p>
   For that reason, Romer has organized a ``heavy schedule of
fund-raisers,'' he said, before year's end that will feature
President Clinton and other prominent Democratic politicians. Romer
said he also had to devise a fund-raising strategy for the future
that would be more ``creative'' than in the past to draw a larger
base of support, even if the average donation is less.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   ``None of us know what will happen with campaign finance
reform,'' Romer said. ``But you assume that it will happen. And
then we will have to divert to a broader base of support. And it
will become harder for us to raise money. We are Democrats, our
base of supporters is less affluent.
<p>
   ``Our strategy will be dictated by McCain-Feingold,'' he added,
referring to the measure introduced by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
<p>
   Romer added that he expected to eliminate the party's $15
million debt within the next two years.
<p>
   Delegates gathered at the session, however, said that the
campaign finance scandals that have attracted so much attention in
Washington have not dampened their ability to raise money.
<p>
   Mike Harmless, executive director of the Indiana Democratic
Party, said the scandal ``hasn't hurt our ability to raise money  &MD; 
people just view it as politics as usual.''
<p>
   Mark Fleisher, chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, added:
``It hasn't had much of an effect in Arizona. People haven't
hesitated for an instant to donate. This is not an issue that has
gotten outside of the Beltway.''

 &UR; SHARPTON IS DENIED RUNOFF IN NEW YORK MAYORAL RACE &LR;  &QL; 
(gh) &QL;

 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  A state judge Friday rejected the Rev. Al Sharpton's
bid for a runoff in the Democratic mayoral primary, saying there
was no evidence of ``false votes or any excessive miscounting'' in
the Sept. 9 vote and no basis to question the result.
<p>
   The judge, Justice Beatrice Shainswit of State Supreme Court in
Manhattan, sympathized with Sharpton's frustrations, saying, ``I
have a feeling, in his shoes, I would be climbing the walls also.''
<p>
   But in upholding the Board of Elections' determination that Ruth
W. Messinger had won the primary  &MD;  and had received more than the
40 percent total required to avoid a runoff  &MD;  the judge said,
``Ultimately, the question doesn't come down as to how anybody
feels but what the votes were.
<p>
   ``There was no proof of anything that was really wrong,'' she
said. She also said that the assertion by Sharpton's lawyers that
they would find something if they had more time ``is simply not a
reason for interfering with the democratic results.''
<p>
   Sharpton had already lost his case in federal court, and the
ruling Friday seemed to deal a crippling blow to his efforts to win
a runoff. One of Sharpton's lawyers, Michael A. Hardy, said Friday
night that he will recommend to Sharpton ``that we move forward
politically at this point, and not with an appeal of the
decision.''
<p>
   Sharpton strongly suggested in a telephone interview that he
will soon formally endorse Ms. Messinger. Sharpton said he would
announce the next stage of his political career in a speech
Saturday morning at the headquarters in Chicago of his political
ally, the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
<p>
   Sharpton said that he would ask nothing from Ms. Messinger in
exchange for his endorsement.
<p>
   ``In my long career, not one political figure has ever said that
I've asked them for anything,'' Sharpton said. ``That's not my
style or my point.''
<p>
   He said his two main goals now were ``an all-out effort to
reform the election process'' and making sure ``that we defeat Rudy
Giuliani.''
<p>
   But Sharpton suggested that despite any political stance he
takes, he may pursue his election challenge in federal court.
Although he was denied the runoff in federal court, his suit there,
which was filed on constitutional and civil rights grounds, remains
open.
<p>
   In unofficial results on election night, Ms. Messinger appeared
to fall just short of the 40 percent total she needed, and the
Board of Elections and both candidates prepared for a runoff. But a
recanvass of voting machine totals in the days after the election
put Ms. Messinger much closer to 40 percent, and a final count of
paper ballots led the board to declare her the winner last week.
<p>
   ``Now that the judge has ruled that the election results
stand,'' Ms. Messinger said Friday, ``I hope that we will be able
to focus the five-and-a-half weeks that remain on the future of
this city, and the problems that need to be solved.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   In denying Sharpton's attempt to win a runoff in federal
District Court in Manhattan, Judge Denny Chin sharply criticized
the Elections Board for what he called a history of ineptitude and
for encouraging Sharpton to believe a runoff would be held.
<p>
   Steven E. Liebman, the court lawyer who investigated the state
case for Justice Shainswit, put some blame on Sharpton, writing
that it was an error on his part to rely on what he should have
known were unofficial election night tallies.
<p>
   ``The factual circumstances clearly demonstrate that even if the
Board contributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty, it did not
contribute to the uncertainty of the election,'' Liebman said in
his 11-page report to the judge.
<p>
   In the state case, Sharpton had to demonstrate that
irregularities in the balloting and vote count were so pervasive
that they changed the outcome of the primary. His lawyers called
polling inspectors, campaign workers and other witnesses who
testified about broken voting machines, vote count errors, late
deliveries of machines to polling places and other irregularities.
<p>
   They also elicited a concession from the board's executive
director, Daniel DeFrancesco, that some discrepancies had occurred
in the vote count. But DeFrancesco said they were the result of
human error and did not affect the outcome.
<p>
   Sharpton's lawyers also told the court that their inspection of
the Board of Elections' records had turned up about 1,000 paper
ballots that were improperly invalidated in the vote count. Had
they had more time to investigate, he said, they could have found
many more.
<p>
   But Liebman concluded that problems reported with machines and
vote tallies were largely remedied on Election Day, and that
election workers conscientiously sought to insure that voters still
were able to cast votes and that tabulations were accurate.
<p>
   Ultimately, Liebman wrote in his report to Justice Shainswit,
Sharpton had failed to ``demonstrate fraud, misconduct, or
unfairness'' in the election, and at best, had shown ``neutral
irregularities, which on their face are clearly inconsequential.''
<p>
   Hardy said after the hearing that one positive result from
Sharpton's legal effort was that ``the public has had an
opportunity to see that there needs to be reform at the Board of
Elections.''
<p>
   But DeFrancesco, the board's executive director, said in a
telephone interview that he always believed the official numbers
would stand up and felt somewhat unfairly attacked in the case.
<p>
   DeFrancesco added that in the future he would ``make it
emphatically clear'' that the news media and candidates understand
the preliminary nature of election night tallies, and that they are
not the official results.

   New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Simon DeBartolo Group Inc.
said it acquired a majority stake in closely held shopping mall
owner Retail Property Trust through a $698 million tender offer.
<p>
   Indianapolis-based Simon DeBartolo, the largest U.S. real estate
company, gains control of 12 malls and neighborhood shopping
centers with about 12 million square feet of space, including the
Menlo Park Mall in Edison, New Jersey, and the Westchester Mall in
White Plains, New York.
<p>
   The company acquired a more than 90 percent stake in Retail
Property and expects to buy the rest next week, said Stephen
Sterrett, senior vice president and treasurer.
<p>
   Simon DeBartolo shares fell 1/8 to 32 11/16.
<p>
   Retail Property is owned by pension funds. Its biggest
shareholders include AT&AMP;T Master Pension Trust, Bell Atlantic
Master Trust, California State Teacher's Retirement System and Ford
Motor Company Master Trust Fund.
<p>
   Simon DeBartolo offered to buy the shares of Retail Property it
didn't already own for $19.375 each, or about $698 million. Before
the tender offer, which ended last night, it owned about 2.3
million shares.
<p>
   The offer broke up a three-way merger between Retail Property
and mall portfolios owned by Cleveland developer Richard Jacobs and
New England Development of Boston, creating a company with 55
properties and 75 million square feet of space. That would make it
one of the largest in the U.S.
<p>
   Jacobs -- owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team --and New
England Development said earlier this week they would not top Simon
DeBartolo's offer.
<p>
   Retail Property will pay Jacobs and New England a ``break up''
fee of $39 million.
<p>
   The offer valued Retail Property at about $1.2 billion,
including the assumption of $450 million of debt.
<p>
   Simon DeBartolo owns and manages 118 malls and shopping centers
with 131 million square feet. Simon DeBartolo is worth about $10
billion, including debt.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Aides to Ron Carey, president of the teamsters'
union, have told government prosecutors and a federal election
overseer that he had general knowledge of a fraudulent scheme in
which union money was donated to several liberal groups that, in
exchange, had their donors contribute to his re-election campaign
last year, officials involved in the investigation say.
<p>
   The accounts of the Carey aides contradict the teamster leader's
strongly worded assertion at the AFL-CIO's national convention this
week that he had known nothing of the scheme and that campaign
aides had betrayed him and the union.
<p>
   Last week Carey's campaign manager and two campaign consultants
pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy in fund raising for his
re-election. They said they had decided to cut corners in seeking
money for the campaign because they believed in Carey as a union
leader and corruption fighter and because he had been trailing his
opponent, James Hoffa, both in fund raising and in polls among
members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
<p>
   The guilty pleas followed by a month the finding of the federal
election overseer, Barbara Zack Quindel, that at least $220,000 had
been circuitously funneled from the teamsters' treasury into the
Carey campaign.
<p>
   Ms. Quindel overturned Carey's narrow victory of last December
over Hoffa and ordered a new election. She declined to disqualify
Carey from running in that election, saying she did not have
evidence that he known of the scheme, but has since said he will be
barred from running if federal officials find that he was a
participant.
<p>
   That question is now being investigated by the office of the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
<p>
   Under federal law, the campaign of a union candidate is to be
totally separate from the union's activities. In addition, federal
law bars union money from being used to advance the candidacy of a
union official.
<p>
   Asked whether Carey had known even generally of the scheme, his
lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said Friday:
<p>
   ``I don't think it's true. Quindel expressly said she had no
knowledge of his wrongdoing, and we have been told expressly by the
U.S. attorney's office that he's not a target.''
<p>
   Although officials say some Carey aides have now told them that
the president was generally aware of the fraud, many details of the
witnesses' accounts could not be learned. Without strong evidence
to support those witnesses, the case could evolve simply into a
matter of their word against his.
<p>
   Herb Hadad, the spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office,
declined to comment on what Carey's aides had told the prosecutors.

<p>
   One focus of the investigators is a part of Ms. Quindel's
134-page decision invalidating Carey's re-election; it suggests
that the president knew that his campaign manager was closely
involved in deciding to which groups the union would contribute
money.
<p>
   At one point, Ms. Quindel's decision describes a telephone
conversation that Carey's secretary, Monie Simpkins, said she had
with him when he was traveling the country to campaign last year.
By Ms. Simpkins' account, she told Carey that the campaign manager,
Jere Nash, had called to say he needed Carey's immediate approval
for a donation to Citizen Action, a progressive grass-roots group
that emphasizes consumer and environmental issues.
<p>
   Altogether, the teamsters donated $475,000 to Citizen Action for
its get-out-the-vote drive to help the Democrats in last year's
congressional elections. Ms. Quindel's decision said Carey had
approved the $475,000 payment, which was more than 15 times what
the teamsters had ever given to Citizen Action in any single
previous year.
<p>
   In return, Ms. Quindel found, Citizen Action and several wealthy
donors to that group contributed $185,000 toward the Carey
campaign.
<p>
   Officials of the Hoffa campaign assert that Carey's approval of
the unusually large donation to Citizen Action demonstrates that he
knew about the scheme to give money to that group and then have its
donors contribute to his campaign.
<p>
   Speaking about the Citizen Action episode, John Bell, a
spokesman for Carey's campaign, said Friday: ``What we have said
all along is this is an allegation. It has not been proven. Mr.
Carey does not remember it. If it did happen, it was wrong.''
<p>
   Bell said the teamsters' increased donations to Citizen Action
paralleled those of other unions, which saw the grass-roots group
as an excellent vehicle with which to lend support to Democratic
causes.
<p>
   Bell also said Carey had merely been approving recommendations
made by the man he relied on to oversee political spending and
strategy, William Hamilton, the union's political director.
<p>
   ``Carey was a known delegater of authority all his career, and
had hired Hamilton to make those decisions,'' Bell said. ``I
wouldn't say he rubber stamped every one of them. He was inclined
to sign off on, put his initials on things Hamilton recommended.''
<p>
   Hamilton quit his post in July, saying he would refuse to
cooperate further with prosecutors. He has denied any wrongdoing.
<p>
   Federal prosecutors are also investigating a $20,000
contribution that Theodore Kheel, the well-known New York lawyer
and labor mediator, made to the Carey campaign. Investigators say
the donation was never reported by the Carey campaign to the
federal election monitor as required by law. Kheel says he did not
know that his donation would not be reported.
<p>
   A Carey adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said this
donation had been solicited by Charles McDonald, president of Union
Privilege, an organization of the AFL-CIO that administers union
benefits and the federation's credit-card business.
<p>
   Investigators suggested that Kheel's donation might have been
illegal because it was solicited by someone who, in running a
credit-card business, would probably be considered an employer;
under federal law, employers may not solicit contributions to union
campaigns.
<p>
   In addition, McDonald's solicitation of the donation flies in
the face of AFL-CIO rules that bar federation officials from taking
sides in union elections.
<p>
   Deborah Davis, a spokeswoman for Union Privilege, said McDonald
was not available for comment. Asked about his donation, Kheel
said:
<p>
   ``Carey was a reform candidate who was on his way to cleaning up
the teamsters and getting rid of the mob influences. He was on the
losing end of a campaign in which Jimmy Hoffa was supported far
better financially, and the fear was that Hoffa might bring back
some of the same influences into the union that the U.S. government
was trying to get rid of.''
<p>
   Richard Leebove, a Hoffa spokesman, replied that any suggestion
that Hoffa had ties to gangsters was ``McCarthyism.''
<p>
   Several present and former Carey aides are cooperating with the
prosecution.
<p>
   Paul Enzinna, Ms. Simpkins' lawyer, said that she was one of
them, but he would not describe what she had said.
<p>
   The three men who pleaded guilty last week are also cooperating.
They are Nash, the Carey campaign manager; Martin Davis, president
of the November Group, a fund-raising and direct-mail firm, and
Michael Ansara, former president of a telemarketing firm in
Somerville, Mass.
<p>
   Their lawyers all declined to comment on what the three had told
investigators.

   BRITISH PARTS SUPPLIER GETS $2-BILLION FEDERAL-MOGUL BID
<p>
   Federal-Mogul, an ailing American auto parts maker now showing
signs of recovery, said it had offered about $2 billion in cash for
T&AMP;N, a British auto supplier. The deal brought praise from Wall
Street, which bid up Federal-Mogul shares by $3.75, to $37.25. T&AMP;N
shares also rose in London trading.
<p>
   The move is part of a consolidation trend in auto parts. Indeed,
in another deal, the Blackstone Capital Partners II Merchant
Banking Fund agreed to buy a controlling stake in American Axle and
Manufacturing for about $650 million.
<p>
   STOCKS RISE ON REVISED GDP
<p>
   A revised government estimate of second-quarter gross domestic
product that showed that economic growth was slower than expected
fueled a rise in stocks, pushing broad market indexes up. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 74.17 points, to 7,922.18. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock gained 7.31 points, to 945.22, and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 3.35 points, to 1,682.24.
<p>
   Treasury bonds rallied as the Federal Reserve entered the market
as a buyer. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 6.36 percent,
from 6.39 percent on Thursday.
<p>
   UNION HEAD LINKED TO SCHEMES
<p>
   Aides to Ron Carey, president of the teamsters union, have told
federal investigators that he had general knowledge of fraudulent
schemes in which the union donated money to liberal groups and in
exchange donors to those groups contributed to his campaign,
officials involved in the investigation said. Carey has denied that
he knew about or participated in such schemes to swap
contributions, saying that he is the victim of his aides'
lawbreaking.

   SEC CHARGES FINANCIAL ADVISER
<p>
   School districts across Pennsylvania face the loss of more than
$70 million that they invested with a financial adviser who
secretly ran up big trading losses, federal regulators said. The
districts, about 75 of them, had invested more than $233 million
with the adviser, Devon Capital Management, which is run by John
Gardner Black from Tyrone, Pa., according to a complaint filed in
federal district court in Pittsburgh by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
<p>
   ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES SUPPORTED
<p>
   The International Trade Commission voted 3 to 0 to back the
imposition of punitive anti-dumping duties against the Vector
supercomputers produced by NEC and other Japanese manufacturers.
The commission, an independent trade panel, found that Cray
Research had been financially injured by the pricing practices of
Japan's supercomputer producers. The commission's ruling upheld
anti-dumping tariffs of up to 450 percent against NEC, which the
Commerce Department imposed in August.

   CHINA'S PRESIDENT MEETS WITH RUBIN
<p>
   In his first meeting with a senior American official since
consolidating his power as China's leader, President Jiang Zemin
told Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that he was irreversibly
committed to the wide-ranging economic changes already under way.
But Rubin said Jiang made clear that China would make major moves
to open its markets only ``as economic conditions improve, and at a
pace that China feels it can handle.''
<p>
   GM PROPOSAL STUNS TOWN
<p>
   General Motors, which closed its automobile plant in Sleepy
Hollow, N.Y., last year, has returned with a plan to develop the
Hudson River site into a new riverfront community with a marina,
apartment buildings, stores, perhaps a museum and hotel  &MD;  even
creation of an island for luxury homes. There is general agreement
that the GM plan would be a huge change for the village. And that
is just the problem.

<p>
   HACKENSACK, N.J.  &MD;  Nine days after he was abducted and slain in
a $20,000 robbery, Nelson G. Gross was remembered at a private
funeral Friday as an astute political strategist, a
community-spirited business and family man and a tragic victim of
senseless cruelty and the greed of strangers.
<p>
   Investigators, meantime, disclosed that Gross' 33-year-old son,
Neil, had been an alternate target of the conspiracy that led to
the death of the 65-year-old millionaire developer and
restaurateur. Gross, a former New Jersey Republican Party chairman,
was kidnapped outside his Edgewater restaurant on Sept. 17 and
killed after withdrawing money from a bank for his abductors.
<p>
   With abundant evidence, including videotaped confessions by
three New York City teen-agers who were arrested on Wednesday,
federal prosecutors in Newark were making preparations to try the
suspects, including two 17-year-old juveniles, as adults, raising
the possibility of death penalties in the case.
<p>
   Under a cloud-flecked autumn sky, Gross' family and nearly 200
friends and other mourners filed somberly into the
Gutterman-Musicant Funeral Home in Hackensack for the funeral. Many
were crying softly, and some paused outside to speak to reporters,
who were barred from the service, of the life and death of Gross.
<p>
   ``He was such a strong, vital, productive person,'' said Judy
Green, a family friend from New York. ``This was all so tragic,
cruel and unnecessary.''
<p>
   Among the mourners were Peter J. Cofrancesco Jr., of Sparta, and
Samuel M. Cannella, of Dover, both members of the New Jersey Racing
Commission, whose chairwoman is Gross' widow, Noel. ``She was
extremely sad, but she's holding up,'' Cofrancesco said after the
service.
<p>
   State Sen. Robert Littell, a Sussex County Republican who is
chairman of the powerful appropriations committee in Trenton,
remembered Gross as a man who was ``not afraid to make a
commitment,'' and ``a wonderful political strategist.''
<p>
   Littell's wife, Jennie, said that a rabbi who presided at the
service spoke of Gross' willingness to ``give back to the
community,'' and challenged the mourners to do the same. And she
added, ``If it was greed behind this, we all need to give back to
our communities, to our youth, so things like this won't happen.''
<p>
   The funeral home, at the family's request, declined to give any
information about the service, but indicated that Gross' body would
be cremated.
<p>
   Gross, a former Republican assemblyman and a key fund-raiser for
Richard M. Nixon in the 1972 presidential campaign and for Gov.
William T. Cahill in 1973, was a rising star in the state's
Republican Party until a fund-raising scandal and a conviction on
conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges derailed his
political career in 1974.
<p>
   Thereafter, he focused on real estate and restaurant businesses,
including ownership of the Binghamton Ferryboat, the riverside
restaurant in Edgewater where he was abducted.
<p>
   Investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
one of the suspects, Christian Velez, 17, had joined the restaurant
staff as a busboy last April, and by July had begun talking to two
Washington Heights, N.Y., friends, Miguel Grullon, 17, and Anthony
Estevez, 18, about the possibility of robbing Gross or his son, who
had operated the restaurant in recent years.
<p>
   ``He was a rich guy with a rich son,'' an investigator quoted
Velez as saying. ``Why not do one of them?''
<p>
   In August, Velez quit his job, the investigator said. He and a
manager of the Binghamton Ferryboat denied reports that Velez had
been humiliated in front of other employees and dismissed by the
elder Gross. ``His back was hurting him, and he just quit,'' the
investigator said of Velez.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The investigator quoted the suspects as saying the plan to rob
Gross or his son was only a vague idea until two days before they
kidnapped Gross. The elder Gross, and not his son, was abducted
because the youths encountered him at the restaurant that morning,
the investigators said.
<p>
   At gunpoint, Gross drove his silver BMW to Washington Heights,
made calls to see where he might get money quickly, and then
withdrew $20,000 from a bank in Edgewater. Investigators said the
youths promised to release him after getting the money, but Velez
and Grullon grew fearful that he might be able to identify Velez as
a former employee and decided to kill him.
<p>
   Estevez, investigators said, drove a second car and did not
participate directly in the decision or in the killing. The New
York City police, tipped by an informer who overheard one suspect
brag about the killing, arrested the three and were led by Velez to
Gross' slashed and bludgeoned body in a wooded area of upper
Manhattan near the George Washington Bridge, investigators said.
<p>
   Federal prosecutors in Newark were claiming jurisdiction in the
case because a state line had been crossed in the crime. Juveniles
may be tried as adults in federal courts if they are 15 or older
and the crime involved drugs or violence. The federal penalty in an
abduction-murder conviction is life in prison without parole, or
death.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Over the last few years, the neighborhood around
Times Square has undergone a much-heralded revival. Grittiness has
given way to glitter, as pornographic theaters have moved out and
tourist-friendly shops and restaurants have arrived.
<p>
   Amid the commercial upsurge, an element of a sacred renewal has
taken place, too, with the just-completed restoration of the
interior of a midtown Manhattan religious landmark, the Church of
St. Mary the Virgin, at 145 W. 46th St.
<p>
   Within the Episcopal Church, 129-year-old St. Mary's has stood
out as a bastion of ``Anglo-Catholic'' tradition, a place of solemn
Masses, Gregorian chants and the clouds of incense that earned the
church an affectionate nickname, ``Smoky Mary's.'' But like the
neighborhood around it, St. Mary's in recent years had stumbled
onto financially difficult times, and its condition had
deteriorated.
<p>
   ``When I came here 19 years ago, this place was falling apart,''
said the parish's rector, the Rev. Canon Edgar Wells. ``It was
majestic, but what an English curate friend of mine calls Gothic
gloom.''
<p>
   The ceiling's paint was peeling  &MD;  ``a mess,'' in the words of
one parishioner, Raymond Camiscioli, an editor at a publishing
company who has been attending the church for more than two years.
At Mass, he said, ``you'd see paint chips fluttering down.'' But
after a year in which the church spent about $800,000 for
repainting and cleaning, Wells said, ``The gloom is now gone.''
<p>
   The marble altar seems to shine, and along the cream-colored,
imitation marble walls can be seen pastel-colored stations of the
cross, visible between columns that carry imposing wooden statues
of the 12 apostles. Frescoes of biblical scenes, in two side
chapels, have been restored.
<p>
   But the biggest surprise may be the ceiling, 80 feet above the
floor. Once plain, it has been painted to resemble the heavens
themselves, in regal blue with golden stars, a sight sufficient to
call to mind a Shakespearian phrase, ``this brave, o'erhanging
firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire.''
<p>
   When he saw it several days ago, after the painters' scaffolding
was removed, Wells said, ``I was absolutely mesmerized.''
<p>
   St. Mary's restoration coincides with another notable transition
at the church. Once firmly opposed to the ordination of women as
priests  &MD;  an issue that remains a sore point for many Episcopalian
traditionalists  &MD;  St. Mary's recently appointed a female priest,
the Rev. Paulette Schiff, as a part-time assistant.
<p>
   Although the church was founded in 1868, after millionaire John
Jacob Astor donated its original site on West 45th Street, it
traces its inspiration to July 14, 1833. On that date, when the
Rev. John Keble preached a sermon at the University Church of St.
Mary the Virgin in Oxford, England, calling on the Church of
England (and, by extension, the Episcopal Church, which grew out of
it) to rediscover its Catholic heritage.
<p>
   Keble's sermon started the Oxford Movement, a reform effort
based on belief that the Church of England was a divine
institution, that liturgy was central to worship and that social
service work must be done to help the poor.
<p>
   At St. Mary's, there are four Masses on Sundays and two on
weekdays, along with morning and evening prayers. Because the
church views itself as within the Catholic tradition in its
broadest sense, prayers are said for the archbishop of Canterbury,
the pope and the ecumenical patriarch of the Orthodox churches.
<p>
   ``It's probably the leading Anglo-Catholic parish in the
Episcopal Church, or at least the best known,'' Bishop Richard
Grein of the New York Diocese said. ``But at the same time, it has
participated in diocesan life fully, unlike some other
Anglo-Catholic parishes, who tended  &MD;  especially with the
ordination of women  &MD;  to isolate themselves.''
<p>
   ``But St. Mary the Virgin never did that,'' the bishop said.
``Most of that is to be credited to Canon Wells.'' Grein will
participate in a Mass there on Oct. 5, to re-dedicate the church
after the restoration.
<p>
   When he arrived at St. Mary's, Wells said he did not support the
ordination of women, because, he said, he saw it as causing
``damage'' to the Episcopal Church's relations with the Roman
Catholics and Orthodox Christians, who do not ordain women. But,
Wells said, ``I changed because I had to change.''
<p>
   In 1995, when the Diocese of New York elected the Rev. Catherine
Roskam as its first female suffragan bishop, Wells wrote a formal
statement welcoming her. He then invited her to celebrate Mass at
St. Mary's, which she did last year, becoming the first woman ever
to preside at its altar.
<p>
   ``I guess my own ministry has been a kind of personal
pilgrimage, which I would not have foreseen,'' said Wells, who will
retire on Dec. 31 at 67.
<p>
   The church, through the restoration, has undergone a
``rebirth,'' said Camiscioli, the parishioner. ``Just to see it
restored to its original beauty,'' he said, ``is really very, very
moving.''

 &UR; TRAVELERS PLANS FURTHER GROWTH TO FILL GAPS INTERNATIONALLY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (JT) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER TRUELL &LR;  &QC;   &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;   &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Travelers Group Inc., has a
healthy appetite. One would think that this week's bite  &MD;  an
agreement to swallow Salomon Inc. for more than $9 billion  &MD;  would
be enough for anyone.
<p>
   But when Weill met with analysts on Thursday morning after the
announcement of Travelers' purchase of Salomon, he told them, in
response to a question, that this acquisition was not enough to
build the global franchise that he seeks, people at the meeting
said.
<p>
   There are still gaps, Weill was said to have acknowledged, and
filling those is likely to require the purchase of companies with
international asset management capabilities.
<p>
   But in an interview Friday, James Dimon, president of Travelers,
chairman of Smith Barney and now co-chief executive of Salomon
Smith Barney Inc., conveyed slightly less voracious intentions.
<p>
   ``I think we just said there would be more asset management and
investment banking,'' he said. ``Investment banking is probably
more of a build, asset management might be a buy.''
<p>
   Any such further acquisitions  &MD;  and building  &MD;  could well come
in London. Investment banks there have previously attracted Weill
and Dimon, who in recent years were interested in S.G. Warburg &AMP;
Co. before it was bought by the Swiss Bank Corp. and in Barings,
which ING Group snapped up.
<p>
   Indeed, London also makes sense as the new Salomon Smith Barney
tries to cast a longer global shadow. Travelers made the deal
because its Smith Barney brokerage firm was almost exclusively a
domestic operation, with more than 430 offices in the United States
and just 15 offices overseas.
<p>
   But even though Salomon has a far larger presence
internationally, with 32 offices and 2,500 of its almost 7,000
employees spread over 24 countries, its reputation  &MD;  forged during
its glory days in the 1980s  &MD;  still tends to outrun its influence.
It has a particularly strong international bond business,
especially in Tokyo, where it is bigger than most rivals. It also
boasts some good individual franchises overseas, such as its
telecommunications and cable television investment banking
businesses.
<p>
   But, prospective acquisitions aside, Salomon Smith Barney for
now is frantically trying to organize itself, sorting out
responsibilities for executives of the combined firms, and
determining where to cut as many as 1,500 to 2,000 jobs.
<p>
   James Boshart 3d, a Smith Barney managing director, is leading
the transition team, and the new firm's operating committee is
tilted toward Weill's subordinates.
<p>
   Smith Barney's presence includes Steven D. Black, who heads
global equities, municipal finance and the Robinson Humphrey Co., a
regional brokerage subsidiary; Jay Mandelbaum, in charge of private
client sales and marketing, and Michael B. Panitch, who leads the
private client division.
<p>
   Salomon's contingent includes Eduardo G. Mestre, a managing
director with a strong reputation in telecommunications banking,
who will head the Salomon Smith Barney investment bank. Thomas G.
Maheras, a Salomon bond trader, leads the newly formed bank's
global fixed-income business, and Shigeru Myojin heads its
proprietary trading.
<p>
   Further tightening the Smith Barney grip, the new firm's chief
financial officer will be Charles W. Scharf, who has worked for
Dimon as Smith Barney's executive vice president and chief
financial officer. Robert Druskin, a Smith Barney vice chairman,
will be the chief administrative officer while Robert H. Mundheim,
Salomon's lawyer, becomes the new firm's general counsel.
<p>
   The advent of Salomon Smith Barney has a lot of bankers and
traders elsewhere on Wall Street worried. Suddenly, there's another
big player wanting a seat at the table that Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.
usually consider reserved for them.
<p>
   ``This one shocked the Street,'' said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an
analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``It had folks fall out of their
chairs. It's high risk, high volatility, but the rewards could be
great. Sandy and Jamie are master integrators. If anyone can do it,
they can do it.''
<p>
   The arrival of another big Wall Street firm also means that
American and foreign banks, comparative newcomers to the New York
securities markets, now have to face an even more competitive
landscape where players, like the new Salomon Smith Barney, are
likely to start cutting fees and commissions to try to gain market
share.

SELIG'S TIES TO GIAMATTI MAKE ROSE'S REINSTATEMENT A LONG SHOT &QL;

<p>
   Pete Rose better have a crack legal team assembled or he's going
to find out the real meaning of the term ``long shot.''
<p>
   He would get better odds betting a trifecta at Lone Star Park at
Grand Prairie or the Houston Astros in three against the Atlanta
Braves, but of course Rose doesn't do that stuff anymore. Or so he
says.
<p>
   What Rose wants to do is get back into baseball, mainly because
he will not rest until his smiling face is decorating a bronzed
plaque in baseball's Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Baseball's most famous alleged gambler officially applied for
reinstatement yesterday, a move that was greeted by a two-line
statement from interim-commissioner-for-life Bud Selig: ``Major
League Baseball today has received a letter from Pete Rose
requesting reinstatement. The matter will be handled in due
course.''
<p>
   Translation: ``Since this annoying pest won't buzz off and leave
us alone, we intend to squash him like a bug ... when we feel like
getting around to it.''
<p>
   But thanks for staying in touch Pete ... how's the wife and
kids?
<p>
   Rose has been in this situation before, in the 1970 All-Star
Game. American League catcher Ray Fosse had the ball and the plate
blocked, but Rose simply lowered his head and flattened him. Game
over, the Nationals win and the legend of Charlie Hustle is secured
forever.
<p>
   This time it will not be that easy, even if the cut-and-dried
legal issue stands in Rose's favor. One simple out-of-school
statement by late commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti has branded
Rose for life.
<p>
   The simple legal fact is baseball did not prove Rose bet on
baseball games. The report compiled by baseball's chief bloodhound,
John Dowd, strongly suggests Rose did, and many believe that it is
convincing evidence. Others, including baseball historian Bill
James, believe that Rose was railroaded.
<p>
   But there was never a hearing or formal finding. Instead there
was a plea bargain for an indefinite suspension and a joint
statement that says, ``Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed an
admission or denial ... that he best on baseball games.''
<p>
   Giamatti, however, pretty much spit on the agreement the next
day in a news conference. Asked if Rose bet on baseball, Giamatti
said, ``In the absence of a hearing, I am confronted by the factual
record of Mr. Dowd. On the basis of that, I have concluded that he
bet on baseball.''
<p>
   That simple but highly damning statement remains baseball's
version of the Scarlet Letter.
<p>
   Rose's problem, as it was in 1989, is his fate won't be
determined in a court of law. He will be in the office of the
interim-commissioner-for-life, and ``The New York Times,'' citing
high-level baseball officials, reported a few weeks ago that there
is no way Selig will recommend Rose be reinstated.
<p>
   Selig was a great admirer of Giamatti and helped engineer his
rise to power. He called Giamatti ``the best friend I ever had in
baseball.'' There is a strong feeling in baseball that no amount of
legal persuasion will induce Selig to overturn Giamatti's ruling.
<p>
   In other words, Rose was playing another long shot when he said
on his radio show yesterday, ``I just hope they approach it with an
open mind.''
<p>
   Another feeling prevalent in baseball is Rose will not be
reinstated until he makes a full confession of betting on baseball,
something he continues to deny. It's an illogical suggestion, for a
binding legal agreement has already been reached on whatever Rose
did wrong.
<p>
   What baseball really wants is for Rose to undergo a religious
transformation: Confess and repent, beg for forgiveness and become
a white knight in shining armor, the great ambassador for the game
of baseball.
<p>
   In other words, they want him to become the Pete Rose they once
thought he was before all his many flaws were laid bare.
<p>
   It will not happen. Rose was a great baseball player and did
much to promote the game. Millions of Americans were right in
admiring the way he played. But Rose is also an arrogant,
self-centered, self-promoting hustler, and that's never going to
change.
<p>
   What else can you expect from a guy who said yesterday: ``I just
hope the lords that be in baseball will see how much the people
like me.''
<p>
   Sorry Pete. The man held in great reverence is Giamatti. Maybe
not by millions of baseball fans, but by the only person who counts
right now.
<p>
   And Selig won't budge as easily as Fosse.

    &UR; EDs: in 2nd graf, updates for Gov. Winter's speech.
 &UR; FOUR DECADES LATER, DESEGREGATION FAR SHORT OF HOPES
<p>
    &UR; By JULIA MALONE &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  &MD;  At the end of a week-long remembrance of the
day nine black students crossed the color barrier into Central High
School here, the debate on Friday turned to whether the clock is
turning backward on desegregation.
<p>
   ``We obviously have not overcome the difficulties of the past,''
former Mississippi Gov. William Winter said in his keynote speech
Friday night at Central High's auditorium  &MD;  opening a national
conference on race here.
<p>
   The two-day discussion, beamed by satellite to 40 cities on
Friday night and Saturday, followed on the heels of Thursday's
celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Little Rock school
crisis.
<p>
   Winter, a member of President Clinton's advisory board on race,
said the desegregation of the nation's public schools since 1957
has been accompanied by ``drastically reduced white enrollment.''
<p>
   By 1980, white students made up only four percent of the public
school enrollment in Washington, D.C., eight percent in Atlanta,
and 12 percent in Detroit, he said.
<p>
   Even so, Winter, an education reformer in his home state during
the 1980s, called for a renewed push to bring the races together in
schools.
<p>
   ``There must first of all be an understanding that we shall
succeed (as a competitive nation) only by making our schools places
where students not only learn how to make a living but also how to
live together,'' he said.
<p>
   Earlier, at the University of Arkansas campus here, scholars
also raised questions about the future of desegregation.
<p>
   ``The resolve for integration has weakened'' among whites and
blacks, said David Goldfield, a history professor at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte.
<p>
   Goldfield said that among some blacks it has now become
``fashionable'' to look back with nostalgia on era of segregation,
when they lived in communities where the businesses were
black-owned and families intact, he said.
<p>
   Alton Hornsby, history professor at Morehouse College in
Atlanta, concurred. ``Many blacks believe that there were certain
values in those insular communities during segregation,'' he said,
adding that he did not share the nostalgic mood.
<p>
   Nor does John Hope Franklin, the octogenarian chairman of
President Clinton's advisory council on race and a leading
African-American historian, who dismissed the idea of returning to
a bygone era.
<p>
   ``Anyone who wants to go back there wasn't there the last
time,'' he said. ``I was there.
<p>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   Even so, scholars and others joined expressing disappointment at
the unfulfilled hopes of the U.S. civil rights era.
<p>
   John Walker, the lead attorney in the ongoing case against the
Little Rock school district, said in an interview, ``The fairness
that desegregated schools promised was never realized.''
<p>
   Walker's chief complaint now is that the city school system,
anxious to keep as many white students as possible, bends over
backward to assist whites. He is especially rankled by the fact
that some 60 percent of the white students at Central High School
are in advanced courses, while blacks predominate in the all of the
other levels.
<p>
   ``What you have in Little Rock is white flight,'' Walker said.
``So every white child is an asset to the school.''
<p>
   Goldfield said such policies are a ``major thrust'' in urban
school districts, where black students are generally bused longer
distances. ``The greatest burden is still on the black children,''
he said. ``The policy is to keep middle class white families'' in
the system.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  There is always the chance that catcher Todd Hundley
will quickly recover from the major elbow surgery he had Friday.
There is a chance the Mets' slugger could be swinging a bat in
spring training and be back in the lineup sometime in April. But
the Mets cannot count on this.
<p>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said Friday that the
team will take a ``conservative'' approach in planning for 1998  &MD; 
in other words, it will prepare to play the season without Hundley.
<p>
   Hundley hit 30 homers and drove in 86 runs before lingering pain
in his right elbow finally forced him to the bench this month. At
first he resisted the idea of having a surgeon rebuild the joint.
However, Hundley struggled to throw the ball from home plate back
to the pitcher, and with no assurances that that would change, he
decided to have reconstructive surgery.
<p>
   Dr. David Altchek, the Mets' team physician, took a tendon from
Hundley's right wrist and used it to replace the damaged and
stretched medial collateral ligament in Hundley's right elbow. It
was the ligament's instability that had caused the bone spurs and
bone chips Altchek removed. Altchek said the surgery went
perfectly.
<p>
   Altchek said Hundley will be in a splint for a week and then
will begin a series of light motion exercises for the next five
weeks. Hundley will gradually increase his regimen, as long as
there are no setbacks. He is scheduled to start throwing lightly in
16 weeks and to start hitting off a tee in 20 weeks.
<p>
   Altchek estimated that Hundley could be playing major-league
baseball in as few as seven months, or next April, or as many as 12
months  &MD;  the end of next season.
<p>
   ``Return to competitive play will be determined by the
progression of his final phase of rehabilitation,'' Altchek said.
<p>
   But Altchek acknowledged that Hundley's status as a catcher,
which demands more throwing than any other position, could
complicate matters. Hundley's playing time could be limited when he
comes back; he could be restricted to playing first base.
<p>
   All of this will factor into the Mets' planning. They will, in
all probability, acquire an experienced catcher who could play on a
regular basis or at least share time with Todd Pratt, who has made
a strong impression since becoming Hundley's backup in July.
<p>
   There is the chance the Mets could try to reacquire Charlie
O'Brien of the Toronto Blue Jays. O'Brien has annoyed Toronto's
management with his outspokenness this season. Another possibility
is Darrin Fletcher of Montreal, a left-handed hitter who would
complement the right-handed-hitting Pratt.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The Mets have three options for filling first base. They could
re-sign John Olerud, a potential free agent who is approaching 100
runs batted in for the season and has won over Manager Bobby
Valentine.
<p>
   But if the Mets signed Olerud to a multiyear deal, they would be
in a bind if Hundley came back and had to play first base
part-time. Olerud's lack of speed and versatility would make it
harder to trade him.
<p>
   The Mets could use Butch Huskey as the first baseman and acquire
an outfielder. Or they could try to acquire a first baseman,
preferably a good hitter who would not cost them big dollars and
who could be traded or play another position if Hundley needed to
play first. Mo Vaughn is an intriguing possibility but a long shot,
because Boston would have to get a huge package in return for
trading the popular player.
<p>
   A free agent who might interest the Mets is Jeff King of the
Kansas City Royals, who was hitting .235 with 25 homers and 104
RBIs going into last night's game. King has played in the National
League most of his career, he would be relatively inexpensive
(compared with Andres Galarraga, the Colorado slugger who will
become a free agent) and, if Hundley had to play first, King could
play second or third. He would also be attractive as trade bait.
<p>
   ``We'll be doing a lot of evaluating in the months ahead,''
Phillips said.

COTTON'S FAMILY HIRES LAWYER &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  The family of UCLA basketball recruit Schea Cotton
has retained an attorney and asked the NCAA for an immediate
reversal of its decision to invalidate his SAT scores  &MD;  a decision
that has rendered him ineligible to play for UCLA.
<p>
   If the NCAA rejects the written request, Cotton may seek an
initial eligibility waiver  &MD;  the NCAA's version of an appeal. The
waiver would allow Cotton to play for UCLA without valid SAT
scores.
<p>
   The NCAA ruled his existing scores invalid because he took
untimed SATs without an NCAA-certified learning disability.
<p>
   Cotton says he suffers from anxiety when taking standardized
math tests. He received permission from the Educational Testing
Service, which administers the SATs and ACTs, to take the untimed
tests, but the NCAA must grant its approval for the untimed tests
to be valid.
<p>
   Both UCLA and Cotton's attorney, Stuart Rice, issued statements
Friday afternoon. There was no mention in either of the Cottons
taking legal action against the NCAA.
<p>
   Rice did request the NCAA apologize to Cotton and officially
close its now-dormant investigation into the financing of his 1997
Ford Explorer.
<p>
   First in the fold: UCLA received its first oral commitment of
the recruiting season late Thursday night, when 6-foot-7 Matt
Barnes told coach Steve Lavin he would sign a letter of intent with
the Bruins.
<p>
   Barnes, from Del Campo High School in Fair Oaks, chose UCLA over
Cal and Michigan.
<p>
   Although not considered an elite prospect nationally, Barnes is
regarded as one of the top 20 players in the West. He can play wing
guard or small forward.
<p>
   ``Coach Lavin told me he's losing four starters and the path was
set for me to come in and play,'' Barnes said of pending departures
of seniors Toby Bailey, Kris Johnson and J.R. Henderson and junior
Jelani McCoy. ``The chance to play right away was important to
me.''
<p>
   Barnes' commitment may impact UCLA's recruiting next year, as
well. He is close friends with Carlos Boozer, Jr., a 6-foot-8
forward from Juneau, Alaska, who is arguably the best junior in the
West. (They play on the same offseason traveling team.)
<p>
   Ray Young, a 6-foot-4 guard from St. Joseph's-Notre Dame in
Alameda, said Thursday night that he will choose from UCLA, Cal,
Stanford and Arizona late next month. The Bruins and Bears are the
current leaders, he said.
<p>
   Not signed yet: Lavin and UCLA still have not reached an
agreement on Lavin's contract, now in the hands of attorneys.
<p>
   ``It has been very frustrating for me personally,'' Bruins
athletic director Peter Dalis said.

<p>
   Bangkok, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, as expected, won a confidence vote in Parliament
after a three-day debate which focused on his management of the
economy.
<p>
   The victory paves the way for a vote later today on a new
constitution written by a group of 99 academics, businessmen and
former politicians. The document is designed to reduce the
corruption and vote-buying that has permeated Thai politics for
decades.
<p>
   Chavalit triumphed with a 54 percent majority in the 393-seat
House of Representatives. The confidence vote was mostly along
party lines, with those in the six-party government casting 212
votes for the prime minister and 170 opposition MPs voting against.
Nine ministers didn't attend the meeting. The three-day nationally
televised debate discussed corruption in the 10-month old
government and the administration's decisions to devaluation the
baht in July, after spending or borrowing more than $20 billion to
defend the currency.
<p>
   Opposition MPs also charged that some officials were given early
warning of the devaluation, enabling them to profit from the
currency change. Hard evidence was lacking in the debate, said
Chavalit.
<p>
   The charter vote is expected to be more one-sided, with both
government and opposition parties voting in favor. Though the prime
minister has given lukewarm support to the draft, he said changes
to the parts he doesn't like can be done later.
<p>
   Once the charter passes, the political deal-making will begin in
earnest for the run-up to elections promised for next spring,
analysts say. Chavalit promised this week to hold elections in
April or May.
<p>
   ``There will still be a sigh of relief as people see the
constitution passed -- though it may be fleeting,'' said Donaldson
Hartman, vice president and director of Thailand research for
Salomon Brothers Inc.
<p>
   ''Political difficulties don't stop with the passage, they
start,'' as politicians and special interests seek to influence and
adapt to the new system, he said.
<p>
   Analysts said opposition parties didn't push too hard in the
debate, as elections held before the new charter is passed would
have been held under current rules.
<p>
   Among the features of the proposed charter are a requirement
that Cabinet members declare their assets before and after their
tenures, forcing them to disclose how much they've been enriched by
public service.
<p>
   It also allows Thais to vote without going back to their home
provinces. That makes it difficult to buy the votes of the millions
of farmers with seasonal work in Bangkok in factories, restaurants
or driving taxis. More importantly, local godfathers would lose the
power to count those votes.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Attorney General Janet Reno's aides have become
accustomed to her laborious style of decision-making. After numbing
hours of meetings, she retreats to her fifth-floor Justice
Department inner sanctum  &MD;  a cozy corner office with a soft couch
and easy chairs, a cheery stone fireplace (where Bobby Kennedy once
grilled hamburgers) and bullet-resistant windows installed during a
scare over Colombian hit men.
<p>
   ``She just goes in there and burrows in,'' said a lawyer who has
watched the intellectual ritual in the past. It is a process Reno
is about to undertake again as time runs out on making a decision
to seek an independent counsel to investigate telephone fund
raising by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
<p>
   ``She reads and reads and reads, calls people up, asks hard
questions, has all kinds of fits,'' the lawyer said. ``Sometimes
she can be a royal pain.''
<p>
   Although she is one of the most public attorneys general in
recent memory, she is also among the most enigmatic. She is
lampooned in jokes on late-night television and pummeled by
Republicans in Congress who have threatened to impeach her, saying
she has shielded Clinton from an independent prosecutor.
<p>
   But White House aides privately blame her for not protecting
Clinton nearly enough. She's in everyone's cross-hairs. No wonder
Reno finds solace paddling what she calls a ``big fat canoe'' alone
on the Potomac River.
<p>
   As of Friday, she has only a week left to decide whether to
ratchet up the review of the Clinton-Gore telephone solicitations
to a 90-day preliminary investigation, the next phase leading to an
independent prosecutor. Friday, at her weekly news conference, she
indicated she had still not made up her mind.
<p>
   ``I don't know whether we will resolve it by next Friday,
because, as I indicated to you last week, what one tries to do in
all these situations is make sure that you have the facts and that
you apply the law to the facts,'' she said. ``The facts, as they
develop, may indicate that the law is applied in different ways. I
don't know what the circumstances will be, and I don't want to
prejudge it.''
<p>
   Controversy has come with the job ever since attorneys general
outgrew their traditional role as presidential confidants and began
operating as the head of the world's largest law enforcement
agency. Democrats in Congress savaged Reno's Republican
predecessor, William Barr, for his refusal to seek an independent
prosecutor in the case of a $4 billion loan to Iraq by the Atlanta
branch of the Banco Nazionale de Lavoro. But few occupants of the
office have found themselves on the high wire, swaying between law
and politics, so often or awkwardly as Reno.
<p>
   Friday, Reno contended she has not been fazed by the intense
pressures swirling around the Justice Department. ``I haven't felt
any pressure from the White House whatsoever. But I haven't felt
any pressure from Congress whatsoever. Or the press. If somebody
wants to impeach me, then I'll face that issue at that point, but
that won't be a factor in my consideration.''
<p>
   But if Reno refuses to refer what she Friday called the ``big
blob'' of disparate campaign fund-raising abuses to an independent
prosecutor, she faces certain fury from Republicans. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has already compared Reno to another occupant
of the attorney general's office, John Mitchell, who went to prison
for his role in the Watergate cover-up.
<p>
   But if she goes forward with the appointment, she will incur the
wrath of supporters of the president and vice president, the two
most powerful officials in the government, who hold in their hands
the aspirations of the Democratic Party. It is as Reno herself has
frequently observed: ``I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.''

<p>
   Reno appears also to have narrowed her room to maneuver by her
past justifications for refusing to consider the appointment of an
independent prosecutor to examine the legality of telephone
solicitations by senior White House officials. In her April 14
letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Reno said that before
concluding that the law may have been violated, ``we must have
evidence that particular solicitation involved a contribution
within the definition'' of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
<p>
   In other words, Reno said that prosecutors had to find that the
donations were solicited as ``hard money'' for the direct election
of Clinton, not ``soft money'' solicited for more generic party
purposes.
<p>
   Her distinction seemed applicable to the facts as they were
known in April, when it appeared that Clinton and Gore, if they had
made any phone calls, had solicited only soft contributions. But
the facts changed after reports that Gore's solicitations wound up
in hard-money accounts at the Democratic National Committee, a
transfer that appeared to fall exactly within Reno's definition of
activity that could be illegal.
<p>
   A closer analysis of the law in the recent weeks has turned up
additional problems with the applicability of the law in this case,
law-enforcement officials said. It is not clear, they said, whether
the election law can be used against the president of vice
president or, for example, when the people being solicited for
contributions were not on federal property.
<p>
   ``I think that there are many factors involving the phone calls
that have got to be considered, both in terms of facts and in terms
of law,'' Reno said Friday, suggesting that she does not regard
herself as bound by her past legal analysis.
<p>
   But some Justice Department lawyers fear that Reno's credibility
could be seriously at risk if she offers a fresh rationale for why
the law cannot be applied to Clinton and Gore, which would likely
be interpreted in Congress as an attempt to tailor her legal
analysis to protect the White House.
<p>
   Some officials say that given the weight of the fund-raising
issues, she will ultimately have little choice but to refer the
case to an independent prosecutor, as influential advisers like FBI
Director Louis Freeh have been urging for months.
<p>
   But current and former aides to Reno insist that she is the most
unpredictable factor in the mix because, they say, she is
stubbornly apolitical in her prosecutorial judgments. Her frequent
comment that she makes up her mind through a cold assessment of
evidence and the law is not merely a convenient platitude, they
say. ``It's a holy grail,'' said one lawyer. ``If she had to decide
it any other way, she'd quit.''
<p>
   Reno may be freer from politics than many of her predecessors
because she has no ambitions beyond her current job  &MD;  except,
friends say, to take a sport utility vehicle into the South Florida
sunset and preserve what she regards as her granite reputation for
integrity.
<p>
   People who know her say Reno is not afraid of taking the heat
for her decisions. She has accumulated layers of scar tissue.
<p>
   As the top prosecutor in Miami, Reno was blamed for days of
rioting in 1980 after four white police officers were acquitted of
beating a black man to death.
<p>
   And she has lived with her decision to approve the FBI's 1993
tear-gas assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas,
which led to a fire and the deaths of more than 80 people.
<p>
   One lawyer who knows her said, ``After that kind of thing, I
don't think this other stuff gets to her that much.''

<p>
   School districts across Pennsylvania face the loss of more than
$70 million that they invested with a financial adviser who
secretly ran up big trading losses, federal regulators said Friday.
<p>
   The school districts, about 75 of them, had invested more than
$233 million with the adviser, Devon Capital Management, which is
run by John Gardner Black from Tyrone, Pa., according to a
complaint filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
   Judge William Standish issued a temporary restraining order
against Black and his firm and separately froze his assets.
<p>
   The amount of money that the school districts will be able to
recover remains unclear, said Richard Thornburgh, a former U.S.
attorney general and former governor of Pennsylvania, who was
appointed by the court to serve as trustee for the schools' assets.
<p>
   ``Our job is to minimize whatever losses there may be,'' said
Thornburgh, now a partner based in Washington with the law firm of
Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart of Pittsburgh.
<p>
   A woman who answered the telephone at Devon Capital Management
said that Black had left for the day and that no one was available
to answer any questions. Telephone calls late Friday were not
returned by either Black or a lawyer who has represented him.
<p>
   About the same time, federal officials were still notifying the
school districts of the problem, and school administrators could
not be reached for comment. Thornburgh said he hoped to have a
preliminary meeting with local officials next week and would
provide a status report to the court next month.
<p>
   The school districts, including those of Bethlehem, Lancaster
and Beaver Falls, invested with Black money that they had raised by
selling bonds  &MD;  usually for construction projects  &MD;  but not yet
spent, according to the complaint filed by the securities
commission. They were reportedly promised that the principal would
be safe.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But in 1995, Black, who has been an investment adviser since
1989, lost at least $50 million from trading securities, according
to the commission. He tried to cover up the losses by sending the
school districts false monthly statements, the complaint said.
<p>
   It said he had also carried on his books a bond he said was
worth $83 million. Two independent investment banks said it was
worth $14 million at most, said William McLucas, director of
enforcement for the commission.
<p>
   The securities commission's complaint also contends that Black
took about $2 million that belonged to the school districts and
used it to pay his expenses.
<p>
   Despite such problems, Black continued to solicit school
districts for more money; indeed, according to the complaint, his
firm ``must continue to attract new funds for investment in the
program in order to fulfill its entire obligations to current
advisory clients.''
<p>
   The situation appears to be similar to the case of Steven D.
Wymer, a California investment adviser who promised small cities
that he would put their money in conservative investments but
secretly racked up losses that ended up costing the governments
more than $90 million. In 1993, Wymer was sentenced to 15 years in
prison.
<p>
   ``The difficulty of these cases,'' McLucas said, ``is the harm
you have to public money, public investors and ultimately
taxpayers.''

<p>
   SLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y.  &MD;  General Motors has proposed transforming
the hulking automobile factory that was the clanging heart of North
Tarrytown into a luxurious development that could be the humming
new center of Sleepy Hollow.
<p>
   Last week the auto company unveiled an ambitious plan to build a
mini-village on the site of its closed factory, one of the largest
parcels of land slated for development along the Hudson. But the
village that changed its name last year as part of an effort to
change its blue-collar image is saying the automaker's glittery
plan may be too ambitious.
<p>
   ``I think General Motors came in with the deluxe luxury model,''
the mayor, Sean Treacy, said Friday, ``and we're more of a
community looking for a midsize.''
<p>
   Planners hired by the automaker described for village officials
a new riverfront community with a marina, apartment buildings,
stores and perhaps a museum and a hotel. The planners from Cooper,
Robertson &AMP; Partners, the New York City architectural firm that
designed the master plan for Battery Park City, even described
dredging out a new inlet, creating, in effect, an island that could
be a prime location for luxury homes.
<p>
   General Motors said the plan was merely a ``conceptual' outline,
intended as a blueprint that could be followed by the automaker
itself or by a developer who might ultimately buy the 96-acre
property.
<p>
   Officials here said they were dazed by the magnitude of the
carmaker's proposal: 1,900 residential units on the site just north
of the Tappan Zee Bridge. By some calculations, that could add
4,000 people to a village with a current population of just 8,200,
requiring new schools, roads, sewers and, most importantly, turning
a small community into a bigger one almost overnight.
<p>
   Some people said the issue was a classic collision between a
desire for development that could bring much-needed dollars and an
equally strong desire to preserve the small-town feeling that is a
source of pride for many Hudson River towns.
<p>
   ``It would be a sociological jolt to the community,'' said
Patrick Munroe, one of the village trustees who attended a recent
presentation by General Motors. ``It was like saying, `OK, folks,
we used to be a little town with little streets and Mom and Pop
stores on Beekman Avenue, but now: Get out of the way.'''
<p>
   Several trustees said that they expected strong community
resistance. The village could impose zoning restrictions that would
limit development on the site, but officials said the plans were
too premature for such measures. A spokeswoman for General Motors,
Marcia McGee, said the proposal would conform to current zoning.
She added that because of the high cost of construction at the
site, high population density was necessary because ``a developer
has to make some money.''
<p>
   Experts on development said anxiety here about the density of
the proposed community reflected a widespread concern in the region
about how much large communities outside New York City can grow
before they lose their character.
<p>
   H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association,
which studies the 31-county metropolitan area, said such concerns
were particularly important in the Hudson Valley.
<p>
   ``The one thing I think the Hudson Valley has to be very careful
about is destroying the thing that makes it special, which is the
quality of life: open space, access to the river, air and water
quality.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   At the same time, Shostal said, the Regional Plan Association
says that development is appropriate for places that are, like the
General Motors site, in the midst of existing communities with easy
access to mass transportation. But the question officials must ask,
he said, is: How much development is enough?
<p>
   Some community leaders in Westchester County said they worried
that by focusing so intensely on the density issue, village
officials were forfeiting a chance to help shape one of the most
significant open sites in the metropolitan area.
<p>
   John Dobkin, president of Historic Hudson Valley, a foundation
that runs six historic sites including Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy
Hollow, said the critical questions for the New York region
involved issues that were likely to get lost, like the creation of
developments that stimulate economic growth.
<p>
   ``It is an extraordinary opportunity,'' Dobkin said. ``You have
96 acres and what are you going to do with it? It not a
once-in-a-lifetime challenge, it's a once-in-a-millennium
challenge.''
<p>
   On Sleepy Hollow's Beekman Avenue Friday, there was anxiety as
well as anticipation. For example, Hugh Casey, owner of Casey's
Tarry Inn, said he thought General Motors was suggesting bringing
in too many new residents. But some newcomers would be good for the
village, he said. ``The type of people they are talking about
bringing in,'' he said, ``are the type that don't cook at home.
They'll come out and have a drink and have dinner.''

<p>
   NEWARK, Texas  &MD;  More than 20,000 souls  &MD;  most of them already
saved  &MD;  have descended on the eastern shores of Eagle Mountain Lake
for a weekend of Christian music, motorcycling, preaching, camping
and good old-fashioned capitalistic selling.
<p>
   Admission is free, but not much else comes cheap at the eighth
annual Eagle Mountain Motorcycle Rally, a two-wheeled revival on
the lake near Fort Worth. Kenneth Copeland Ministries sponsors and
runs the event.
<p>
   By all accounts, it is the largest gathering of Christian bikers
or biker Christians anywhere. Spotted Friday at the huge
campgrounds  &MD;  a temporary city of campers, trailers and all manner
of vehicles  &MD;  were license plates from most of these United States.
Some people came from as far as Canada.
<p>
   And most came astride a hog  &MD;  the rumblin', easy-ridin'
Harley-Davidson. In descending order, there were a goodly number of
Japanese, German and British two-wheeled conveyances, but Harleys
clearly provide the ride that most of the Christians drive with
pride.
<p>
   Unlike most other motorcycle gatherings, this one features
children everywhere: on motor scooters and bikes, in strollers and
wagons, and riding the hips of moms, dads and grandparents as they
take in the sights.
<p>
   A festival atmosphere prevails. A dozen or more food stations
Friday featured the typical country fair fare: burgers ($3), hot
dogs ($2), pizza ($2 a slice) and turkey legs ($3.50).
<p>
   But there were no alcoholic beverages, overly loud rock music or
raucous behavior, not counting the occasional shouts of ``Praise
Jesus!'' or ``Jesus is Lord!'' or ``The King is here, and it ain't
Elvis!''
<p>
   Under beautiful blue skies with temperate temps, it was a
pleasant family time during which old friends caught up with hugs
and kisses, and strangers greeted one another with a smile and a
``Howdy.''
<p>
   An afternoon of games for children and adults, a motorcycle show
and motorcycle-riding contests gave way to an evening of worship.
Kenneth Copeland was the featured speaker Friday night.
<p>
   Evangelist Jesse Duplantis is to speak at 7:30 Saturday night.
Sunday, the services will include baptism at 1 p.m.
<p>
   More than a dozen Christian entertainers are scheduled to
perform throughout the weekend.
<p>
   And in Copeland's formidable aircraft hangar, it is
merchandising heaven.
<p>
   Shopping throngs Friday snatched up $1 Christian socks and
$67.50 video sets of the rally. In between were thousands of
Christian books, CDs, audio and videotapes, T-shirts, sweatshirts,
ball caps, pins, patches, sunglasses, sun visors, bracelets,
bandannas, motorcycle cleaning products, arts, crafts, gizmos,
gadgets and widgets.
<p>
   Vendors offered leather goods: jackets, beverage insulators,
wallets and purses. Several thousand ``as is'' audiotapes were free
for the taking.
<p>
   Many people wore the official Eagle Mountain Rally T-shirt with
the words, ``I've Been to the Mountain.'' Others featured
declarations: ``Hell No, Heaven Yes,'' ``When I Can't Cope, Jesus
Offers Hope,'' ``Real Men Love Jesus,'' ``Riding With Jesus,''
``Kickin' Satan's Butt'' and an ungrammatical but effective ``Jesus
The Answer.''
<p>
   Darnell Gardener and wife Ethel of Lumberton were selling $3
posters of Jesus with tiny print in the background of Matthew 1-15.
<p>
   ``I'm not really up here to sell anything. This is God's
business,'' Gardener said. ``The $3 just covers expenses.''
<p>
   ``There's just one person I love more than this lady here,'' he
added, pointing to his wife, who sat on a box next to her husband's
wheelchair. ``And that is Jesus.''
<p>
   Gardener said he paid $230 for the opportunity to sell his
posters. He said that at some Christian rallies, such as the
Believer's Convention in Fort Worth, he doesn't have to pay.
<p>
   ``Sure I had to pay $230, but you know it costs Copeland
something to do this, and he has to protect his property, with
liability and all,'' he said.
<p>
   Gardener said he was happy to be at the rally. ``I'm 68; I'm
just a young man. You know, I've been crippled since birth  &MD;  some
kind of polio or something  &MD;  but God didn't make me sick. God never
makes you sick. The devil makes you sick.''
<p>
   Outside, a series of signs offering ``Free Food'' led visitors
to the large purple and white tent of the Messengers Motorcycle
Ministry.
<p>
   Sheryl Webb said she and her husband, Rex, established the
traveling biker ministry three or four years ago. She said the
group of 30, including families and children, travels the country
dispensing food and the word of God. They spend 10 months a year on
the road and usually hit a biker gathering every week, she said.
<p>
   ``We travel all over the U.S. to minister to outlaw bikers,''
Sheryl Webb said.
<p>
   She said they haven't missed any of the Copeland gatherings,
which she said are greatly different from other biker rallies.
<p>
   ``When we get here, the spirit of God is already here. When you
go to outlaw rallies, we have to take the love of Christ with us,''
Webb said.
<p>
   ``I remember the first one. I'd say there was less than 1,000
people. When I come out here every year, this is like a homecoming.
You see people from all over the country that you haven't seen.''
<p>
   Melody and Walter Roye of Hobbs, N.M., each had a reason for
attending, along with their four children, ages 9, 7, 5 and 21
months.
<p>
   No. 5 will arrive in April, said Melody Roye, who added that her
husband is a police sergeant back home. ``Me, I'm the mom,'' she
said.
<p>
   ``What's the attraction? Well, the kids like to look at the
motorcycles. We listen to the speakers. My husband, he's a Jesse
(Duplantis) freak. But mostly, it's the atmosphere.
<p>
   ``It's a wonderful place for the kids.''

   And most came astride a hog  &MD;  the rumblin', easy-ridin'
Harley-Davidson. In descending order, there were a goodly number of
Japanese, German and British two-wheeled conveyances, but Harleys
clearly provide the ride that most of the Christians drive with
pride.
<p>
   Unlike most other motorcycle gatherings, this one features
children everywhere: on motor scooters and bikes, in strollers and
wagons, and riding the hips of moms, dads and grandparents as they
take in the sights.
<p>
   A festival atmosphere prevails. A dozen or more food stations
Friday featured the typical country fair fare: burgers ($3), hot
dogs ($2), pizza ($2 a slice) and turkey legs ($3.50).
<p>
   But there were no alcoholic beverages, overly loud rock music or
raucous behavior, not counting the occasional shouts of ``Praise
Jesus!'' or ``Jesus is Lord!'' or ``The King is here, and it ain't
Elvis!''
<p>
   Under beautiful blue skies with temperate temps, it was a
pleasant family time during which old friends caught up with hugs
and kisses, and strangers greeted one another with a smile and a
``Howdy.''
<p>
   An afternoon of games for children and adults, a motorcycle show
and motorcycle-riding contests gave way to an evening of worship.
Kenneth Copeland was the featured speaker Friday night.
<p>
   Evangelist Jesse Duplantis is to speak at 7:30 Saturday night.
Sunday, the services will include baptism at 1 p.m.
<p>
   More than a dozen Christian entertainers are scheduled to
perform throughout the weekend.
<p>
   And in Copeland's formidable aircraft hangar, it is
merchandising heaven.
<p>
   Shopping throngs Friday snatched up $1 Christian socks and
$67.50 video sets of the rally. In between were thousands of
Christian books, CDs, audio and videotapes, T-shirts, sweatshirts,
ball caps, pins, patches, sunglasses, sun visors, bracelets,
bandannas, motorcycle cleaning products, arts, crafts, gizmos,
gadgets and widgets.
<p>
   Vendors offered leather goods: jackets, beverage insulators,
wallets and purses. Several thousand ``as is'' audiotapes were free
for the taking.
<p>
   Many people wore the official Eagle Mountain Rally T-shirt with
the words, ``I've Been to the Mountain.'' Others featured
declarations: ``Hell No, Heaven Yes,'' ``When I Can't Cope, Jesus
Offers Hope,'' ``Real Men Love Jesus,'' ``Riding With Jesus,''
``Kickin' Satan's Butt'' and an ungrammatical but effective ``Jesus
The Answer.''
<p>
   Darnell Gardener and wife Ethel of Lumberton were selling $3
posters of Jesus with tiny print in the background of Matthew 1-15.
<p>
   ``I'm not really up here to sell anything. This is God's
business,'' Gardener said. ``The $3 just covers expenses.''
<p>
   ``There's just one person I love more than this lady here,'' he
added, pointing to his wife, who sat on a box next to her husband's
wheelchair. ``And that is Jesus.''
<p>
   Gardener said he paid $230 for the opportunity to sell his
posters. He said that at some Christian rallies, such as the
Believer's Convention in Fort Worth, he doesn't have to pay.
<p>
   ``Sure I had to pay $230, but you know it costs Copeland
something to do this, and he has to protect his property, with
liability and all,'' he said.
<p>
   Gardener said he was happy to be at the rally. ``I'm 68; I'm
just a young man. You know, I've been crippled since birth  &MD;  some
kind of polio or something  &MD;  but God didn't make me sick. God never
makes you sick. The devil makes you sick.''
<p>
   Outside, a series of signs offering ``Free Food'' led visitors
to the large purple and white tent of the Messengers Motorcycle
Ministry.
<p>
   Sheryl Webb said she and her husband, Rex, established the
traveling biker ministry three or four years ago. She said the
group of 30, including families and children, travels the country
dispensing food and the word of God. They spend 10 months a year on
the road and usually hit a biker gathering every week, she said.
<p>
   ``We travel all over the U.S. to minister to outlaw bikers,''
Sheryl Webb said.
<p>
   She said they haven't missed any of the Copeland gatherings,
which she said are greatly different from other biker rallies.
<p>
   ``When we get here, the spirit of God is already here. When you
go to outlaw rallies, we have to take the love of Christ with us,''
Webb said.
<p>
   ``I remember the first one. I'd say there was less than 1,000
people. When I come out here every year, this is like a homecoming.
You see people from all over the country that you haven't seen.''
<p>
   Melody and Walter Roye of Hobbs, N.M., each had a reason for
attending, along with their four children, ages 9, 7, 5 and 21
months.
<p>
   No. 5 will arrive in April, said Melody Roye, who added that her
husband is a police sergeant back home. ``Me, I'm the mom,'' she
said.
<p>
   ``What's the attraction? Well, the kids like to look at the
motorcycles. We listen to the speakers. My husband, he's a Jesse
(Duplantis) freak. But mostly, it's the atmosphere.
<p>
   ``It's a wonderful place for the kids.''

<p>
   TRENTON, N.J.  &MD;  For the last year, Gov. Christie Whitman has
repeatedly called for a clean campaign driven by issues, like the
economy and taxes, and not by personal attacks. But when the
Democrats renewed questions this week about a state-paid settlement
of a sexual harassment case against a prominent Republican, it was
the governor who got personal.
<p>
   The spat began on Tuesday after the minority leader of the state
Senate, John Lynch, said the Democrats planned to remind New Jersey
voters about the $175,000 that the state paid this summer to settle
a case brought by a state employee who had charged that she was
harassed by the state Republican Party chairman, Chuck Haytaian,
when he was speaker of the state Assembly.
<p>
   When told about the Democrats' plan, Whitman responded that
Lynch should ``be ashamed of himself'' for bringing up the sexual
harassment case when he had had his own marital problems.
<p>
   ``John Lynch is someone who should know better than this,'' she
told a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark on Tuesday. ``He is
someone who's had his own problems. Yes, he's had problems. We read
it in the newspaper. He's had domestic violence problems.''
<p>
   Those words prompted Lynch's wife, Deborah, to send the governor
a letter on Wednesday, angrily saying that it was Whitman who
should be ashamed for referring to the domestic violence charges
that the Brielle police filed against Lynch after an argument
between the couple in 1996. The charges were dropped after Mrs.
Lynch refused to testify against her husband.
<p>
   ``Your attempt to meddle in my marriage is a sick effort to
cover up the real problems your administration has in dealing with
sexual harassment,'' Mrs. Lynch wrote. ``How dare you.''
<p>
   The next day, the governor did not back down.
<p>
   ``I'm not the one who called 911,'' she told reporters on
Thursday, when asked whether she thought her comments had gone too
far.
<p>
   Friday, Whitman tried to move away from the issue.
<p>
   She said the settlement of the Haytaian lawsuit had been handled
according to state law, in the same way similar cases have been
handled for other state employees.
<p>
   ``There's nothing more to be said on the subject,'' Whitman said
at a news conference Friday morning. ``If the Democrats want to
divert attention from the real issues facing this state to talk
about a sexual harassment case, they are really getting desperate.
This case was settled under an existing law that the state has had
in place for years.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   After last year's Senate campaign between Robert Toricelli and
Richard Zimmer, Whitman complained about the candidates' personal
attacks on each other and vowed that her re-election campaign would
be different. Throughout her term as governor, she has rarely
lashed out so forcefully at her political adversaries.
<p>
   The war of words has spurred the Democrats to organize an effort
to get Haytaian, who is working on Whitman's re-election campaign,
to pay back the $340,000 that the state spent on the settlement and
his legal defense.
<p>
   Lynch said Friday that some of the Democrats campaigning for
state Senate may begin running television advertisements
criticizing the Whitman administration's handling of the case.
<p>
   The lawsuit against Haytaian was filed in January 1996 by Beth
Herbert, an administrative assistant at the state Assembly who
worked for Haytaian when he was speaker. In her complaint, Mrs.
Herbert charged that starting about July 1994, Haytaian would call
her into his office, close the door and hug or kiss her.
<p>
   The sexual allegations were never proven or disproven, but
Haytaian has denied wrongdoing. Nonetheless, in July of this year,
the state agreed to pay $175,000 to settle the suit. The former
speaker had also filed a defamation lawsuit against Ms. Herbert,
which he agreed to drop as part of the settlement.
<p>
   Based on Whitman's recommendation, the Republican State
Committee elected Haytaian in mid-1995 as their committee chairman,
a position that pays $105,000 a year.
<p>
   Whitman's Democratic opponent, state Sen. James McGreevey, has
been mostly silent about the back-and-forth between the governor
and the Lynches. McGreevey said through a spokeswoman Friday only
that he felt that Whitman's comments ``were very unfortunate.''
<p>
   Carl Golden, a spokesman for the Republican State Committee and
a former spokesman for the governor, said Haytaian did not plan to
pay the state any money and that he planned to stay involved in
Whitman's campaign.
<p>
   Golden said the governor had responded appropriately after
hearing that Lynch was accusing her administration of mishandling
the sexual harassment case.
<p>
   ``Any governor would have lost his or her temper,'' Golden said,
``when confronted with such a lie.''

<p>
   New Jersey health officials are investigating the actions of two
paramedics who performed an emergency Caesarean section on Thursday
to deliver the baby of a woman in North Bergen who was in cardiac
arrest and could not be revived.
<p>
   The paramedics acted while consulting by radio with emergency
room doctors at Jersey City Medical Center, officials said, but
state health regulations forbid paramedics to perform surgical
operations. The emergency workers said they believed the procedure
was their only hope of saving the baby.
<p>
   The full-term baby girl survived but is in critical condition;
the mother, who was 37, died.
<p>
   The two paramedics were placed on desk duty, with pay, pending
the outcome of the state investigation, which officials said should
be completed next week.
<p>
   ``This was so unusual,'' said Dr. Leah Ziskin, the deputy
commissioner of the state's Department of Health and Senior
Services. ``Our review is not complete.''
<p>
   But to hospital and volunteer officials, the only thing clear
was that the two paramedics were heroes, in spite of the rules.
<p>
   ``These two people, a man and a woman, they've gone through
probably the most traumatic situation of their professional career,
so light duty is more than appropriate,'' said Bill Dauster, a
spokesman for Jersey City Medical Center. ``We probably didn't need
the state to tell us to do that.''
<p>
   The events, according to spokesmen from the Jersey City Medical
Center and the North Bergen Volunteer First Aid Squad, unfolded as
follows:
<p>
   At 5:30 a.m. Thursday, the North Bergen squad received a 911
call from someone in a residential neighborhood in the uptown
section of North Bergen, saying that a woman was not breathing. Two
volunteers, who were on the midnight-to-7 a.m. shift, arrived a few
minutes later, finding the woman in cardiac arrest, with no
heartbeat and no sign of breathing. They tried to revive her, said
Mary Ellen Cleveland, the president of the first aid squad.
<p>
   A few minutes later, two paramedics from the staff of Jersey
City Medical Center arrived at a house in the neighborhood from
their base in Weehawken. The woman had still not been resuscitated;
the baby was lodged in the birth canal.
<p>
   ``They made a determination that she was dead,'' Dauster said.
``And then they said, `Oh my God, we have to do this.'''
<p>
   In a telephone consultation with doctors at Jersey City Medical
Center, the paramedics and the doctors made a ``joint decision'' to
try a Caesarean section, he said. The two paramedics, both of whom
were described by Dauster as seasoned, delivered the baby just
after 6 a.m.
<p>
   The baby had no pulse at birth but was revived by the
paramedics.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Another ambulance from West New York then came to assist, and
the woman and the baby were taken separately to Palisades Medical
Center in North Bergen. The woman was pronounced dead at the
hospital. The baby was later taken to Jersey City Medical Center.
<p>
   Officials said they had not yet determined what caused the
woman's heart attack.
<p>
   Friday, a woman who answered the phone at Palisades Medical
Center said the hospital had no comment on the incident. Dauster
and Ms. Cleveland declined to give the names of the family, the
paramedics or the volunteer emergency medical technicians from the
North Bergen squad.
<p>
   It was the first time anyone at Jersey City Medical Center could
recall such a case, Dauster said. But he added that everyone was
proud of the paramedics.
<p>
   ``What they did was step over what regulators have outlined for
them into the moral arena,'' he said. ``Most people are going to
view this as an act of heroic endeavor; that's how we're viewing
it.''
<p>
   The baby, he added, was named Davida by the nurses at Jersey
City Medical Center. She weighed about 10 pounds.

EX-BEARS STARTER SMITH CAN PARTICULARLY FEEL THEIR PAIN &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;

<p>
   IRVING, Texas  &MD;  Several Cowboys, drawing on the memories of the
team's woeful 1-15 campaign in 1989, have tried to sympathize with
the winless Bears going into tomorrow's game at Texas Stadium.
<p>
   Try as the Cowboys might, only linebacker Vinson Smith can truly
understand what the Bears (0-4) are going through.
<p>
   A four-year starter with the Bears before signing with the
Cowboys this season, Smith knows that he could easily be
languishing in the other locker room at the bottom of the NFC
Central rather than sitting tied atop the NFC East with the Cowboys
(2-1).
<p>
   ``My wife has been telling me all week, `We could be in
Chicago''' Smith said. ``I haven't said a word. I've been very
quiet.''
<p>
   Smith's reticence is partly based on empathy for his former
teammates and Bears coach Dave Wannstedt and partly because he
knows that the Bears could ease much of their pain with a victory
against the Cowboys.
<p>
   Smith said the Bears got a lot of mileage from last season's
22-6 victory against the Cowboys and would love for a
season-turning upset Sunday.
<p>
   ``We had some hard times last year,'' Smith said. ``But because
of the type of people that play there, we fought every game. I
don't see anything different. They are going to fight.
<p>
   ``It's the same situation like last year. If you beat the
Cowboys with all their talent, it could make your season and give
you something to feel good about.''
<p>
   Smith, who still has many friends on the Bears and talks to them
regularly, is especially disheartened for Wannstedt, who is getting
a lot of heat from the Chicago media and could be fired if the
Bears don't turn things around.
<p>
   Considering his close relationship with Wannstedt, Smith knows
that his former coach is giving himself more abuse than any that
his critics could dish out.
<p>
   ``It's hard to even imagine what he's going through,'' Smith
said. ``He is very competitive. If he is not winning, he has a very
hard time.''
<p>
   Cowboys guard Nate Newton, who called Wannstedt a ``great
motivator'' and a ``super guy,'' agreed that losing was not
something that sits well with Wannstedt.
<p>
   ``He's going through hell,'' Newton said. ``It's got to be
burning and eating at him to be 0-4.''
<p>
   Newton and Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman remembered enduring
similar hard times in 1989 when the Cowboys began the season 0-8.
But both said the situations are decidedly different: the Cowboys
were starting a rebuilding project in 1989 and Wannstedt is now in
the fifth year with the Bears.
<p>
   ``I've got some idea of what he's going through,'' Aikman said.
``I was 0-8 my rookie year. I know he's got to be extremely
disappointed. But they are in a different position than we were.
They've had success in the past. In 1989, we didn't have any
success to fall back on.''
<p>
   Despite the sympathetic voices, the Cowboys prefer that
Wannstedt's misery last at least one more week.
<p>
   ``We don't want them to get that victory against us,'' said
defensive tackle Tony Casillas, who played under Wannstedt, the
Cowboys' former defensive coordinator, in the 1992 Super Bowl
season.
<p>
   ``We don't want that.''

   ORLANDO, Fla.  &MD;  As part of the Moscow Circus, Svetlana Nugzarov
and her family performed daring acrobatics on galloping stallions
to packed houses all over the world, including in this city. But
upon their return to Orlando this year, the Nugzarovs received
standing ovations from as few as 50 people.
<p>
   Poor ticket sales were just the beginning of a dispiriting
American run for a renowned Russian circus that moved here
envisioning a permanent one. Instead, the performers went out of
business within weeks, got evicted from their condos for failing to
pay rent and have been forced to stand guard by their 120-foot tent
to keep creditors from hauling it away.
<p>
   The performers hope to carry on. But their plight raises the
question of whether a one-ring show with clowns, jugglers and
dancing bears stands a chance in Orlando's glitzy fantasy world of
multimillion-dollar resorts, state-of-the-art computer simulation,
water parks disguised as ski resorts and not one, but two,
simulated Manhattan streetscapes. Can artistry and tradition
compete in the high-tech marketplace of ``Terminator 2'' and ``Back
to the Future,'' or even Shamu the killer whale and Mickey the
make-believe mouse?
<p>
   ``It's hard to believe a program like this couldn't succeed,''
Mrs. Nugzarov, who has been with the Moscow Circus for 45 years,
said through an interpreter. ``We'd never failed before.''
<p>
   The original troupe of 85 performers, 11 horses, 20 dogs, two
leopards and six brown bears is dwindling as some of the acts, such
as the 14-member Doveiko aerialists, have accepted job offers in
Las Vegas and elsewhere. But most of the circus is hanging on while
looking for new investors to raise their tent again, blaming their
false start on inadequate promotion.
<p>
   Orlando city officials say that with 35 million tourists a year
who on average visit for five days or longer, the Moscow Circus
could find a niche even among audiences weaned on special effects,
and in an entertainment capital with leviathans like Disney World
and Universal Studios.
<p>
   ``There are plenty of smaller entertainment operators that do
very well, and marketing is key for them,'' Mayor Glenda Hood said.
``They could do well because it's an outstanding circus.''
<p>
   That possibility is what keeps the 50 hold-out performers from
running away to join other circuses. It took about $400,000 just to
bring them and their equipment to the United States, Moscow Circus
members say. Most left circus jobs in Russia to come together for
the new Orlando venture and work for twice or more their salary.
<p>
   All that and pride, they say, has made them wait.
<p>
   ``This is about a great circus, that's what we're trying to
preserve,'' said Sergei Tolstikhin, the circus ringmaster and a
linguist who now mostly performs as interpreter for the
non-English-speaking company. ``The idea of having a circus here is
very appealing because we know something beautiful could happen.''
<p>
   The Russians, who came here last February, wanted to establish
the first U.S. franchise of the Moscow Circus, a prestigious circus
known for stars like the Flying Cranes and for worldwide touring,
including shows at venues such as Radio City Music Hall and Madison
Square Garden in New York City. The 11 acts for the Orlando
production were gathered from circuses in the former Soviet Union,
where the circus is a centuries-old art form and a state-run
institution. Unlike in the United States, where most circuses are
touring enterprises, Russian circuses usually operate out of
permanent buildings in major cities.

   Difficult economic times at home since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, however, have made scores of circus performers from
the former Soviet Republics head West, and today many of them are
found in American shows, like Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP;
Bailey, and stage productions, like those in Las Vegas casino
hotels. But after falling on hard times at home, the Moscow Circus
fell on harder times in Orlando.
<p>
   An original opening date of October 1996 was delayed to the
following March, meaning the circus missed the winter tourist
season, Tolstikhin said. Finally able to open last March, the
circus was forced to close after seven weeks last May because of
poor attendance  &MD;  once they had to cancel a performance when only
10 people showed up in a tent with a seating capacity of 1,600.
Since then things have been so dire that a Christian charity,
thinking the performers were starving, sent them food when they got
in trouble with neighbors for fishing carp out of a landscaping
pond.
<p>
   Two major investors, DAJ Guani Investors and Burkett Contracting
Corp., both of Central Florida, are now suing the New York promoter
who brought the circus here, Alex Valdez and his First Capital
Investment Group, for breach of contract. The investors, who said
their contract called for at least six months of performances, with
two daily shows, want to recoup an investment of $307,800.
<p>
   The investors also name in their suit Rasul Abdullaev, the
Moscow Circus producer that assembled the troupe, over ownership of
assets such as bleachers, lights and the circus tent. Twice, a
crane has been sent to take the red and blue striped tent now
plopped down on the asphalt behind the bear mouth facade of the
Moscow Circus site here, but both times the performers have managed
to hold on to it, their lawyer said.
<p>
   ``They put their bodies under the wheels of the crane to stop
it,'' said Scott Siverson, a lawyer for Orlando tour operator Jorge
Aznar, an investor who is paying the performers' housing in a hotel
while trying to get it going again.
<p>
   Calls to Burkett Contracting Corp. were not returned and Valdez
could not be reached for comment. But Ralph Hadley, a lawyer for
DAJ Guani Investors, said he empathized with the circus performers,
calling them ``victims just like my clients are.''
<p>
   The Moscow Circus performers say they are owed more than
$250,000 in wages after being abandoned by their American sponsors.
Their travails have been compounded by negative publicity after
Florida regulators last June said they would seize the circus bears
if the animals were not moved out of their small traveling cages,
and the landlord who evicted them last July sued, claiming to be
owed more than $37,000 in back rent. Neighbors also accused some of
the Russians of unruly behavior, including fishing in the pond.
<p>
   But the performers have been able to stay here partly because of
the support of many fans here and all over the United States,
Siverson said, including people who have donated transportation,
housing for the animals and money. What they need the most,
however, is an investment of about $500,000 to start over,
Tolstikhin said.
<p>
   While they wait, performers like Vladimir Dovgan and Anatoliy
Yeni, ``the extraordinary balancing duo,'' Margulim, the clown, and
the Nugzarovs, including Mrs. Nugzarov, her husband, Tamerlan, and
two sons, spend days trying to keep fit, exercising the animals and
working the telephones from a room in Siverson's office to raise
money.
<p>
   The circus performers will likely make a decision about their
fate by next month.
<p>
   ``If nothing happens within a month, maybe the time has come to
express my appreciation to the actors and pack up and go to other
places,'' said Abdullaev, a former builder of circus tents who
moved here with his wife and two children.
<p>
   Mrs. Nugzarov said her family and the 11 other performers in the
horsemanship act will likely seek the help of the Russian state
circus company to return home, where they last worked with the Old
Moscow Circus. She said that they have received offers from
American circuses but that the constant traveling required would
not allow them enough time to rehearse and maintain their artistic
quality.
<p>
   She predicted a sad homecoming.
<p>
   ``Every time we came back to Moscow we were happy and proud,''
said Mrs. Nugzarov, who has performed for audiences of 60,000
people. ``Now it's going to be difficult. But we can't blame
ourselves for what's happened here.''

 &UR; SCHOOL ISSUES POSE CONFLICTING DEMANDS FOR MESSINGER AND HUSBAND &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Ruth Messinger, the Democratic mayoral candidate, was
watching the news the other night when a parent from Greenwich
Village called her apartment with an urgent request. Chancellor
Rudy Crew was opposing an effort by parents to raise private money
to pay the salary of a teacher who was about to lose her position
at Public School 41, and the parents wanted Messinger by their side
the next morning for a demonstration against the chancellor.
<p>
   For a fleeting moment, Messinger said, she considered whom she
might call at this time of night, almost 11, for information on
this potentially volatile confrontation between parents and their
school board. But she did not have to look any farther than the
next seat in her own den, where her husband, Andrew Lachman, had
joined her for their nightly ritual of watching the news.
<p>
   In addition to being the husband of the Democratic candidate for
mayor, Lachman is the director of government relations and external
affairs at the school district that includes P.S. 41. And as such,
Lachman's task included being the defender and explainer of the
policy that Messinger was being asked to oppose.
<p>
   Messinger, who is the Manhattan borough president, questioned
her husband about the details of the dispute that evening. The next
morning, she decided to use a press conference to denounce the
chancellor's position and called her husband at work before she
went before the microphones.
<p>
   ``I told him what I was planning to say,'' she said. ``I did not
ask him. I told him.''
<p>
   As the Greenwich Village parents carried out their battle this
week for the right to pay the teacher's salary and relieve crowding
at P.S. 41, a less noticed episode was being played out, which
provided an insight into both the Democratic candidate for mayor
and the often conflicting demands that confront working couples
these days, particularly when one of them is running for public
office.
<p>
   For the first time, Messinger and Lachman found themselves on
the opposite sides, at least in their public postures, on a
high-profile policy dispute. And Lachman, who friends say has tried
to keep a low profile in Messinger's campaign, has now decisively
emerged as the husband of a candidate for mayor whose campaign has
been driven by a relentless attack on her husband's place of
employment, the New York City school system.
<p>
   It is, according to friends, a slightly awkward moment for both
of them, and it has suggested the kind of problems they might be
forced to work out should Messinger be elected mayor and Lachman
remain in the job he has held at Community School District 2 for
the past 10 years.
<p>
   For his part, Lachman, a reserved figure who friends say does
not share his wife's interest in the public spotlight, plays down
any notion of discomfort, either in the instance of P.S. 41, or
even after a summer in which Messinger attacked the school system
every day.
<p>
   But it has been a difficult week for him, not only because of
the situation with his wife, but because he has, by virtue of his
position as spokesman for District 2, been defending a position
that he does not necessarily agree with. The district
superintendent, Anthony Alvarado, who is Lachman's supervisor and
longtime ally, initially authorized the parents to raise the money,
but was forced to back down by Crew.
<p>
   ``I didn't make this decision,'' Lachman said. ``I'm
articulating the position. The facts that she was discussing are on
the public record. It wasn't against me.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Still, Lachman's statements aside, the potential difficulties of
the situation were grasped by parents as they learned that Lachman,
who was sitting in on the negotiations about the teacher, had a
fairly influential friend back home. ``I said, `Wait a minute  &MD; 
these guys are married?' '' said June Penick-Leroy, a mother of one
of the fourth-graders in the classroom that would have lost its
teacher. ``How can a couple who believes so strongly in two
different things sit at the same breakfast table?''
<p>
   Penick-Leroy said she later revised her opinion as she learned
that the private beliefs of Messinger and Lachman were not
necessarily so different.
<p>
   This is a situation that the two have confronted before in their
dual careers, though perhaps not as acutely as they have over these
last few months. Messinger, as Manhattan borough president, recused
herself from any discussions that involved Lachman's school
district, following written procedures she said she submitted to
the city's Conflicts of Interest Board.
<p>
   Now, both Messinger and Lachman said they have refrained from
discussing issues that might bear on Lachman's immediate job,
although that does not mean they refrain from talking about the
school system, which has become the central issue of Messinger's
campaign.
<p>
   Indeed, the two of them have always shared a strong interest in
education. Messinger's entry into politics came by way of teaching
at the Children's Community Workshop School, an alternative school
in the Upper West Side that was financed by private donations, and
then by running for the district school board.
<p>
   ``Believe me, given the pace of both of our lives, we have lots
to talk about without my laying out the subject for the next day's
press conference or the next policy paper,'' Messinger said. ``And
I consider him wise in a great many areas where he is very helpful,
and it has nothing to do with his job.''
<p>
   Lachman said that he was not even particularly bothered as he
watched his wife visit public schools where she attacked Giuliani
and Crew.
<p>
   ``She was focusing on other districts, not this district,''
Lachman said. ``There's nothing wrong with arguing for additional
resources for the school system, or addressing capital budget
issues. I don't have a problem with that.''
<p>
   By all appearances, Lachman is not apparently eager to play the
politician's spouse. He makes only infrequent appearances on
Messinger's behalf. He attends only the most critical campaign
meetings, such as the one on the night after Messinger's poor
showing in the primary.
<p>
   Indeed, Lachman is known among the couple's friends as a highly
private man, who is immersed in his own work.
<p>
   ``Andrew leads a fundamentally structured life,'' said one of
the couple's friends, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
``He doesn't share the same ambition. It's not his life's work that
Ruth should become mayor.''
<p>
   Their differing tastes for public attention are only one of the
differences between Messinger and Lachman, who were married in 1989
on New Year's Eve, the night before she was inaugurated as
Manhattan borough president. She is both older than her husband
(she is 57 and he is 50), and taller than him ( Messinger's
campaign declined to provide the statistics on this observation).
This is Messinger's second marriage, and it is Lachman's first.

 &UR; UNION FIGHTING FOR OFFICER WHO REFUSED GAY GROUP'S MEDAL &LR;  &QL;

   NEW YORK  &MD;  A police officer who was suspended after refusing to
accept a medal for valor from a gay officers' organization has
touched off a storm of protests, pitting union leaders who say he
was unfairly punished against gay officers who are calling for
further punitive measures.
<p>
   Officer Lawrence Johnston was suspended without pay on Sept. 19,
a day after the police department's annual awards ceremony. Sgt.
Edwin Rodriguez, president of the Gay Officers Action League,
reported that after he, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani presented Johnston with the league's medal of
honor, Johnston later walked up to him, handed the medal back and
made several ``vulgar homophobic'' comments.
<p>
   Lou Matarazzo, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent
Association, said Johnston's refusal to accept the medal was an
expression of his First Amendment rights. He added that the union
would file a lawsuit on Monday calling for him to be placed back on
active duty.
<p>
   ``I think it is a disgrace that the department has placed a hero
police officer out on suspension based upon what members of an
organization have told them,'' Matarazzo said. ``The officer
refused the medal on the basis of his religious beliefs and had
every right to do so.''
<p>
   Members of the Gay Officers Action League said that while they
were not calling for Johnston to be dismissed, they believed that
stronger disciplinary action was warranted.
<p>
   ``We want strict punitive measures that will send a message to
the bigots,'' Rodriguez said.
<p>
   Johnston was awarded the league's Medal for Valor for pulling a
wounded officer to safety during a shootout in Queens in October
1995, said Marilyn Mode, the deputy commissioner for public
information. Each year, the police department awards approximately
75 medals, named after the various fraternal police organizations,
including the Gay Officers Action League. The groups' names are
assigned to the medals at random, Ms. Mode said.
<p>
   Matarazzo said that Johnston, who, he said, had previously
received two medals for valor and 14 citations for excellence, had
apologized for returning the medal in a meeting on Thursday.
<p>
   ``He informed Sergeant Rodriguez that if he was under fire he
would rescue him, regardless of his sexual orientation,'' Matarazzo
said. ``My guess is the sergeant will accept the apology on good
faith.''
<p>
   But Rodriguez said that Johnston's apology was not acceptable.
``What he said was `I apologize for what you perceive to be
offensive,''' Rodriguez said. ``That's not an apology.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Ms. Mode said that while Johnston was within his rights in
refusing the medal, he could be subject to dismissal if an internal
investigation finds that he uttered homophobic remarks when he did
so.
<p>
   ``The issue was the vulgarity of the remarks and the sexual
innuendo that he allegedly used, not that he refused the medal,''
Ms. Mode said. ``If it's true, it's unprofessional behavior.''
<p>
   Rodriguez agreed that Johnston had a right to turn down the
medal if he wished, but said the officer should undergo counseling.
<p>
   ``What we would like is for him not to be dismissed, but that
strict punitive measures short of dismissal be taken,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He should get diversity training regarding gay and
lesbians.''
