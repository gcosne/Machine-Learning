COLUMBUS, Ohio: Conference finals.
United 2, Revolution 1
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Carlos Llamosa beat Walter Zenga in
the seventh shootout round on Wednesday night to give D.C. United a
2-1 victory over the New England Revolution and help the defending
MLS champions advance to the Eastern Conference finals.
<p>
   Richie Williams scored in the 53rd minute off a pass from John
Harkes to give the United a 1-0 lead. New England's chances to come
back seemed to evaporate in the 70th minute, when Francis Okaroh
was given a red card for a hard tackle on Jaime Moreno in front of
the benches.
<p>
   The automatic ejection forced the Revolution to play a man down
for the remainder of the game. But two minutes later, Joe-Max Moore
scored on a penalty shot after Eddie Pope was called for a foul  &MD; 
even though it appeared Alexi Lalas simply fell.
<p>
   Moore put the ball in the lower right-hand corner of the net,
just beyond the reach of Scott Garlick's outstretched hands.
<p>
   With nearly all of the crowd of 16,233 sticking around, the
teams started the shootout strongly, with each scoring on its first
three shots. But after Jeff Agoos missed for Washington, Guiseppe
Galderisi missed for New England; Ben Iroha's miss was followed by
a miss by Alberto Naveda, sending the shootout into sudden death.
<p>
   Harkes and New England's Paul Keegan both missed. Llamosa's goal
forced Ivan McKinley to make his shot or witness the end of the
Revolution season. He kicked it into Tom Presthus, who was brought
in as a substitute during the final minute to give the United a set
of fresh legs in goal.
<p>
   The Revolution, the league's lowest-scoring team with 40 goals
in 32 games, lost its playoff opener 4-1 on Sunday to D.C., the
highest-scoring team with 70 goals. New England needed a win on
Wednesday to force a decisive Game 3 on Sunday in Washington.
 &UR; Burn 3, Galaxy 0 &QL; 
<p>
   In Dallas, Dante Washington scored two goals Wednesday night,
leading the Dallas Burn to a 3-0 victory over the Los Angeles
Galaxy and a 2-0 sweep in a Major League Soccer playoff series.
<p>
   Dallas advances to the Western Conference finals against
Colorado, which beat Kansas City 3-2 on Wednesday to win that
series 2-0.
<p>
   Washington scored his first goal in the 29th minute on a header
from four yards after a crossing pass from Mark Santel. Damian had
set up the goal by backheeling the ball to Santel from the 18-yard
box.
<p>
   In the 69th minute, Washington took a long, bending cross from
Alain Sutter that skipped past Los Angeles defender Danny Pena.
<p>
   Washington trapped the ball and beat Galaxy goaltender Kevin
Hartman into the lower right part of the goal.
<p>
   The second goal came after Washington missed two 1-on-1
opportunities with Harman in the 66th and 68th minute. His shot hit
the right upright on the first occasion and the crossbar on the
second.
<p>
   Daniel Peinado made it 3-0 in the 86th minute with Los Angeles
pressing hard and running out of time. The Burn's Jason Kreis
passed to Peinado, who received the ball at least 15 yards behind
the Galaxy defense and beat Hartman low right.
<p>
   After his second goal, Washington left the game with what was
believed to be a strained rotator cuff. His status is uncertain.

   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline raked Mexico's Pacific
coast with winds up to 120 mph (190 kph), toppling trees and small
homes as 30-foot (9-meter) waves battered the shoreline.
<p>
   Mexican authorities on Wednesday extended a hurricane warning
from Huatulco to the major resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatenejo as
Pauline hugged the coast and churned northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).
<p>
   While forecasters were unsure of Pauline's exact path, they
feared the hurricane could target Acapulco, Mexico's most populated
Pacific resort with 2.9 million inhabitants.
<p>
   ``Preparations to protect life and property in the warning area
should be rushed to completion,'' the U.S. National Hurricane
Center in Miami advised, calling Pauline's winds
``life-threatening.''
<p>
   This southern resort, meanwhile, was hit by high winds and heavy
rains much of the day but no casualties were reported.
<p>
   Several villages suffered damage near the Huatulco airport,
which closed for Pauline's passage. The hurricane then roared past
Puerto Escondido, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) west of here.
<p>
   In Las Cruces near the airport, cardboard and wooden shacks lost
roofs, and walls crumbled on some buildings.
<p>
   Otilio Jimenez Zarate, 27, wrapped in a waterlogged white
blanket and holding his 4-year old son Marcelo after his roof was
destroyed, said he was headed to shelter.
<p>
   ``We don't have a place to sleep anymore,'' said Jimenez Zarate,
whose wife Inocencia carried a garbage bag on her head and one in
her hands.
<p>
   ``This is all our clothes. It's all we have left,'' she said.
<p>
   Pauline's eye touched land earlier Wednesday west of Huatulco,
not far from Puerto Angel, and flooding was reported in parts of
Oaxaca and Chiapas states in southernmost Mexico.
<p>
   Uprooted palm trees blocked sidewalks in Huatulco and downed
power lines danced in the wind.
<p>
   As towering waves crashed over a causeway, tourists huddled in
hotels and hundreds of Mexicans sought refuge in emergency
shelters. Pieces of roofing flew in the heavy winds.
<p>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday (0300 GMT Thursday), Pauline was about
135 miles (215 kilometers) southeast of Acapulco, but the center
warned that the hurricane's path remained highly unpredictable.
<p>
   ``A slight turn inland would result in Pauline weakening, but
would pose a continued serious flood and wind threat for
mountainous areas,'' the center reported.
<p>
   ``A slight turn offshore would allow Pauline to retain much of
its current potentially destructive strength.''
<p>
   Hurricane specialist Ed Rappaport in Miami said El Nino could
have added to Pauline's punch.
<p>
   ``The Pacific waters are somewhat warmer than normal as a result
of El Nino,'' he said. ``Although we haven't seen more tropical
storms this year, we have seen a few more intense hurricanes.''
<p>
   Waves the height of a two-story house thundered against beaches
and ocean water swirled through an open-air seafood shack. ``The
sea came all the way in here,'' said owner Floralis Rio Narvaez.
<p>
   The passage of a previous storm, Olaf, caused 18 deaths and
flooding in southernmost Mexico and parts of Guatemala and El
Salvador last week.
<p>
   Ludi Michel and Doug Smith, just married in Upland, California,
found themselves stranded here on a honeymoon drive down the coast.
<p>
   ``We thought our Jeep was going to blow over. So we stopped,''
said Doug Smith, eating tortillas by candlelight as the storm raged
outside their powerless hotel. He called it a twist on an ordinary
beach vacation.
<p>
   ``You can do `nice and sunny' in Los Angeles,'' he said. ``We
might have to come back, just to see the sunny side.''

BC-Sports-Baseball-NL Playoffs,0791
Braves 7, Marlins 1
By BEN WALKER
AP Baseball Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA (AP)  &MD;  Shamed by their sloppy showing in the opener, the
Atlanta Braves bounced back with the complete package, just as
Florida manager Jim Leyland feared.
<p>
   Tom Glavine pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning, Chipper
Jones and Ryan Klesko homered and the Braves caught everything in
outplaying the upstart Marlins in all phases, winning 7-1 Wednesday
to tie the National League championship series at one game apiece.
<p>
   ``I said it last night: The Braves aren't going to get excited
about one loss,'' Leyland said. ``They came back today and did
everything almost perfect.''
<p>
   Especially Jones. A day after his misplay put the Braves in a
big hole, he played flawlessly in the field, and also drove in
three runs with three hits.
<p>
   How did he deal with failure the previous night?
<p>
   ``I have a system down pat,'' he said. ``You take the car ride
home with your spouse, you rant and rave, and cuss and whatnot.
When you get out of the car, you just forget about it.''
<p>
   Looking every bit like the team that's been boss in the NL
throughout the 1990s, and nothing like the club that gave away Game
1, the Braves gave Glavine an early 5-0 lead.
<p>
   ``They weren't too happy with the loss last night, that's for
sure,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``I felt they would swing
great today. We scalded some balls.''
<p>
   The Marlins fell for the first time in their young postseason
history. They looked bad from the beginning, too  &MD;  Gold Glove
catcher Charles Johnson made his first error of the season on Kenny
Lofton's leadoff bunt, and Alex Fernandez lasted just 2 2-3 innings
in his shortest start since 1995.
<p>
   Now, after their first setback in five playoff games, it will be
the Marlins' turn to prove they can recover from such a lousy loss.
Game 3 will be Friday night at Miami when rookie Tony Saunders, 3-0
against Atlanta this year, faces John Smoltz.
<p>
   ``The series is even. I wasn't celebrating last night and I'm
not discouraged now,'' Leyland said.
<p>
   Glavine did his best to restore the Braves' pitching prominence,
allowing three hits in 7 2-3 innings. He retired the first nine
batters and cruised until Devon White's RBI double with two outs in
the eighth  &MD;  a play, by the way, on which White was foolishly
thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple.
<p>
   ``Nobody was in here panicked,'' Glavine said. ``Realistically,
for us, unless we're facing elimination, we don't look at any game
as a must-win. But we didn't want to go to Miami down 2-0 and
having to play three times down there.''
<p>
   Relievers Mike Cather and Mark Wohlers completed the
three-hitter.
<p>
   Atlanta's fielders, meanwhile, had a return to respectability. A
day after several mistakes made all five runs off Greg Maddux
unearned in a 5-3 defeat, the four players guilty of the misplays  &MD; 
Jones, Klesko, Fred McGriff and Lofton  &MD;  each turned in neat grabs.
<p>
   Klesko and Jones each homered for the second straight day. Keith
Lockhart had two hits and scored twice.
<p>
   Fernandez, one of several key players the Marlins imported in
the offseason to beat the Braves, was 2-0 against them this year.
But he was tagged for six hits in his earliest exit since going 2
2-3 innings for the Chicago White Sox on May 25, 1995.
<p>
   ``I just had a bad day today,'' Fernandez said.
<p>
   It took only one inning in this game to see that all the omens
were in Atlanta's favor.
<p>
   Jones and Lofton had no trouble making plays in the top of the
first. On Tuesday night, Jones failed to handle a grounder down the
third-base line that turned into a three-run double.
<p>
   Lofton opened the bottom half with a bunt to the left side of
the plate that Johnson reached quickly. But he threw low past first
base on a play scored as a single and an error.
<p>
   Johnson had gone 175 games since June 23, 1996, without an
error, and set a major league record for catchers this year for
most consecutive games (123) in a season without a miscue.
<p>
   The Marlins, who did not make an error in Game 1 and never
trailed, fell behind when Lockhart followed with a triple off the
wall in right-center. Two outs later, Klesko stood at home plate
and watched his high drive sail halfway up the right-field stands
for his eighth postseason homer and a 3-0 lead.
<p>
   Lockhart, playing in place of injured second baseman Mark Lemke,
singled and scored on Jones' seventh postseason home run in the
third.
<p>
   After making two nice double-play pivots, Lockhart doubled in
the seventh off Felix Heredia, Jones hit an RBI single and Javy
Lopez had a sacrifice fly for a 7-0 lead. &QL;

BC-Japan-Bank Merger
Two Japanese regional banks merge to fight increased competition
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Two Japanese regional banks announced Thursday that
they plan to merge in a bid to survive increased competition
expected after an upcoming government deregulation of the financial
sector.
<p>
   Fukutoku Bank and Naniwa Bank, will officially merge on Oct. 1,
1998, at a ratio of one Fukutoku share for one Naniwa share. Other
details are yet to be decided, the banks said in a statement.
<p>
   Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka welcomed the merger.
<p>
   ``Under the severe business environment, the merger will further
promote their restructuring plan and accelerate the writing-off of
bad debts,'' Mitsuzuka told reporters.
<p>
   Like many banks, both Fukutoku and Naniwa have been burdened
with non-performing loans after the collapse of Japan's
asset-inflated ``bubble economy'' of the late 1980s.
<p>
   The banks said it was important they strengthen their operations
and deal with their bad debts as quickly as possible with the
government looking to implement its ``big bang'' financial
deregulation by 2001 and as the number of troubled financial
institutions grows.
<p>
   The banks said the most effective way to do this was to merge
and rationalize their combined operations.
<p>
   The surviving bank will be Fukutoku, with the president of the
new bank to come from Naniwa and the vice president from Fukutoku.
The headquarters of the new institution, which has yet to be named,
will be based in the western city of Osaka, where the existing
banks are headquartered.
<p>
   The new operation will have 430 fewer employees from a combined
2,430 people currently working at both banks  &MD;  which will result in
a projected savings of 4 billion yen (dlrs 33 million), the banks
said.
<p>
   They also said they plan to consolidate 30 branches over the
next three years. As of September the banks had a total of 159
branches.
<p>
   At the end of September, Fukutoku Bank had deposits totaling
1.27 trillion yen (dlrs 10.5 billion) with outstanding loans at
1.21 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion). Naniwa Bank had 353 billion
yen (dlrs 3 billion) of deposits and 331 billion yen (dlrs 2.7
billion) of loans.

<p>
   In Denver, Paul Bravo scored two goals and assisted on one to
lead the Colorado Rapids to a 3-2 victory Wednesday over the Kansas
City Wizards and a two-game sweep of a Major League Soccer Western
Conference semifinal series.
<p>
   The Wizards opened scoring in the ninth minute, when Uche Okafor
two-bounced a cross to Digital Takawira, who sent a high shot over
the diving Marcus Hahnemann.
<p>
   Bravo equalized in the 16th minute, connecting after passes by
the Henderson brothers, Chris and Sean.
<p>
   Bravo gave the Rapids the lead in the 68th minute, when Matt
Kmosko sent the ball from the corner to the front of the net. The
cross was tipped by Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann and was put in
by Bravo, who was at the left post.
<p>
   Wolde Harris scored the game-winner in the 83rd minute, taking a
flicked pass from Bravo and blasting it into the net from 12 yards
out.
<p>
   Preki made it close, finding the net in the 88th minute with a
hard shot to the lower left corner.
<p>
   Colorado will face the Dallas Burn in the conference final.

<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Twelve people were confirmed dead and 13 left
missing after a massive wall of mud unleashed by heavy rains tore
off of a mountainside in southwestern Yunnan province, an official
report said Thursday.
<p>
   The 750-meter- (2,500-foot-) wide swathe of hillside swept into
a remote mountain village on Friday, damaging 182 houses, 11 of
which were still buried several days later, the newspaper China
Daily reported.
<p>
   A much larger chunk of land was still slowly sliding downhill,
threatening an even larger landslide, the report said.
<p>
   Officials in the remote mountainous region, some 2,200
kilometers (1,375-miles) southwest of Beijing, were not immediately
available to provide updated details on the disaster.

Source says Dean Smith to step down as North Carolina coach
By DAVID DROSCHAK
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHAPEL HILL, North Carolina (AP)  &MD;  Dean Smith, the winningest
coach in the history of U.S. college basketball, will retire
Thursday after 36 seasons at North Carolina, The Associated Press
has learned.
<p>
   A source close to the program, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Smith called him Wednesday to tell him the news. He
also told him that Bill Guthridge, Smith's assistant for the past
31 seasons, would succeed him as coach.
<p>
   An incoming recruit to the Tar Heel basketball program also
confirmed the news to the Fayetteville Observer-Times.
<p>
   ``Coach Smith left a message for me and when I called him back,
he just came out and told me he was retiring,'' said Kris Lang, a
senior at Gastonia Huss High School who plans to play for UNC
during the 1998-99 season.
<p>
   ``He said he hoped I understood, and I said I did,'' Lang said.
``He told me he was still going to be around. He just wasn't going
to be coaching anymore.''
<p>
   ESPN, citing sources close to the North Carolina program,
reported Wednesday night that the 66-year-old Smith was not
stepping down for health reasons.
<p>
   North Carolina has called a news conference for Thursday. Sports
information director Steve Kirschner refused to give details about
the 2 p.m. news conference, saying only that the school planned a
``major announcement.'' He would not comment when asked whether it
concerned Smith.
<p>
   Smith has said for years he would decide before the start of
practice each year whether to retire. North Carolina begins
practice Oct. 18.
<p>
   Smith's home telephone was busy or went unanswered Wednesday
night.
<p>
   Smith said earlier this year he planned to honor his contract
through 2001.
<p>
   ``I take each year as it comes,'' Smith said in March, ``and I
won't make that decision in April, because every April I am
probably (tired). So, you wait to see how excited you are in
August. For 36 years I guess I've been excited in August and
September. If that ever changed up until 2001 then I would make
that decision.''
<p>
   Smith, with a career record of 879-254, broke Adolph Rupp's
all-time victory mark of 876 last season during the NCAA national
college championship tournament in Winston-Salem.
<p>
   Last year's Final Four appearance was Smith's 11th. He won
national titles in 1982 and 1993.
<p>
   Smith's teams have finished in the top three of the Atlantic

Arrest warrant issued for Ravens running back Morris
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROCKWALL, Texas (AP)  &MD;  An arrest warrant has been issued for
Baltimore Ravens running back Byron ``Bam'' Morris as part of an
attempt to revoke his 10-year probation on a 1996 drug conviction.
<p>
   Morris' lawyer, Jay Ethington, said the player would turn
himself in by Friday.
<p>
   ``This is a very serious matter,'' Ethington said. ``It impacts
on his entire career. We are aware that the judge is very strict.''
<p>
   District Attorney Ray Sumrow of Rockwall, 25 miles (40
kilometers) east of Dallas, sought the arrest warrant. He said
Morris' probation should be revoked because he violated two
conditions of his probation by using alcohol and by failing to
report to his probation officer seven times from July 1996 to
August 1997.
<p>
   ``He physically has to come back here. What his profession is
really doesn't make any difference to me,'' Sumrow told The Dallas
Morning News.
<p>
   Morris pleaded guilty to marijuana possession after his arrest
in March 1996 on Interstate 30 near Rockwall. An officer found more
than five pounds (2.25 kilograms) of marijuana in the trunk of
Morris' car.
<p>
   The player was driving toward his hometown of Cooper, 75 miles
(120 kilometers) northeast of Dallas. He was a high school star at
Cooper and a college star at Texas Tech before entering the NFL. In
1993, he won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top collegiate
running back.
<p>
   Morris was suspended by the NFL for the first four games of this
season after a drug test revealed in January that he had used
alcohol.
<p>
   The NFL refused in September to release the results to Sumrow.
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the test results are privileged
under Texas law since they are part of a voluntary substance abuse
program.
<p>
   Rick Calvert, one of Sumrall's assistants, said Rockwall County
officials think they can prove Morris violated his probation
without the official NFL test results.
<p>
   ``We have been told by other sources that the reason for his
violation was alcohol-related,'' Calvert said.
<p>
   Kevin Byrne, a spokesman for the Baltimore Ravens, said
Wednesday that he was unaware of the arrest warrant.
<p>
   ``I think whatever the court is asking, Bam will comply,'' Byrne
said. ``And as for our organization, we will try to learn more
about the situation as fast as we can, and we will react when we
learn more.''

Japan approves dlrs 27 million in food aid for North Korea
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The Japanese government Thursday approved dlrs 27
million to the United Nations in food aid to help relieve the
famine in North Korea, the Foreign Ministry announced.
<p>
   The money could buy about 67,000 tons of surplus Japanese rice
for North Korea, the ministry said.
<p>
   Separately, the government also approved a donation of about 94
million yen (dlrs 7.76 million), or equivalent to 11 million Swiss
Francs, to the Red Cross for medical aid to the country.
<p>
   Both approvals were made at a meeting Thursday of Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's Cabinet, the ministry said.
<p>
   Japan had been reluctant to send new food aid to Pyongyang
because of unresolved suspicions that North Korean spies have
abducted Japanese, who may still be alive in North Korea.
<p>
   At a news conference, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi reiterated
Japan's position, making clear that the donation is not economic
assistance for North Korea.
<p>
   Obuchi said, however, that Japan sees the situation from a
humanitarian point of view.
<p>
   ``As a member of the international community, we need to play a
relevant role.''
<p>
   North Korea has been hit by a severe food shortage caused by
massive flooding and drought. The United Nations has called for
international support to alleviate the famine.

   TORONTO (AP)  &MD;  A Pakistani cricket star has been ordered to
return to court on charges that he assaulted a fan during a game
last month.
<p>
   Inzamam Ul-Haq will return Oct. 31 at which time a trial date
will be set.
<p>
   The 27-year-old star of the former World Cup champions from
Pakistan allegedly climbed into the stands and punched and kicked a

megaphone.
<p>
   The charges followed an incident during the second game of the
Sahara Cup at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club on
Sept. 14.

Religion commissioner: Ties sought between religion, government
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  Vietnam's new religious affairs
commissioner says he hopes to foster closer ties between Vietnam's
various churches and the government, official media reported
Thursday.
<p>
   Speaking to leaders of the Episcopal Council in Vietnam, Le
Quang Vinh, the director of the Government Commission on Religious
Affairs said he wanted to promote greater solidarity between church
and state.
<p>
   Vinh met with the church leaders Tuesday, the official Vietnam
News reported.
<p>
   Religion in communist Vietnam is strictly controlled by the
government, sparking repeated confrontations between some Catholic
and Buddhist church leaders and the authorities.
<p>
   Top Catholic church appointments for Vietnam approved by the
Vatican must also receive the blessings of the Communist Party  &MD;  an
ongoing source of tension between Hanoi and the Catholic church.
<p>
   The Buddhist church, meanwhile, falls directly under the
government's supervision.
<p>
   Although Vietnam claims to permit freedom of religion, human
rights groups say church leaders have been jailed in the past
because of their religious practices.
<p>
   During their meeting Tuesday, Vinh told Episcopal Cardinal Pham
Dinh Tung, he ``would do his best to help promote bilateral ties
between the Vietnamese government and the different religions in
the country.''
<p>
   The religious leaders reported to Vinh on the churches' recent
activities, the Vietnam News reported.

Enron Corp. joins coal slurry pipeline project in China
</PREAMBLE>

<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. energy company Enron Corp.
will join a US dlrs 500 million coal slurry pipeline project in
China, an Australian company involved in the plan said Thursday.
<p>
   MRI Holdings, a small Australian company that has a stake in
China Pipeline Holdings, said in a statement it and other
shareholders of China Pipeline Holdings signed a shareholders'
agreement with Enron International China CP, a unit of the U.S.
energy and pipeline company.
<p>
   ``Under the agreement, Enron will receive new shares issued by
China Pipeline Holdings enabling it to own 61.5 percent of the
expanded equity interest of China Pipeline Holdings,'' MRI said.
MRI's stake will be diluted to 15.5 percent.
<p>
   Enron will contribute expertise and experience in project
financing, pipeline construction and operation.
<p>
   Enron's ``solid reputation in the financial community'' should
assure success in capital raising for the US dlrs 500 million
project, the Australian company added. It said 70 percent of the
project will be financed with debt and 30 percent through equity
funds.
<p>
   The restructuring of China Pipeline Holdings ``has the support
of the relevant authorities of the Chinese government,'' MRI said.

Tung urges Hong Kong to stop dwelling on Tiananmen bloodshed
By MARCUS ELIASON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Hong Kong people should look to the future and
stop dwelling on China's 1989 crackdown on protesters at Tiananmen
Square in Beijing, Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa said Thursday.
<p>
   Answering callers on a radio phone-in program, Tung also advised
the public to be careful about matters China regards as sensitive,
such as campaigning for Taiwanese and Tibetan independence.
<p>
   Replying to a woman who asked whether China should admit it was
wrong to crush the 1989 protest movement, Tung said: ``I think it's
now time for Hong Kong to lose this burden.''
<p>
   ``We have a very important future ahead of us. We are now in a
new era and so we have to work very hard on many fronts,'' he said.
<p>
   ``We cannot forget it,'' the woman said. ``The memory is still
very fresh.''
<p>
   ``What happened in the course of history, history itself will
have a verdict on that,'' Tung replied.
<p>
   The exchange highlighted Tung's delicate position as he steers
the former British colony through its first 100 days as a
semiautonomous region of China.
<p>
   He has to show Beijing that Hong Kong under his rule is not
becoming a hotbed of subversion. But any attempt to curb the memory
of Tiananmen Square would play into the hands of critics who claim
he is Beijing's yes-man.
<p>
   The attitude of many Hong Kong people to China is defined by the
events of 1989, and tens of thousands of people rally every June 4
to remember the victims.
<p>
   So Tung was careful not to imply that he would ban the
commemorations. Instead, he urged listeners to focus on China's
economic and social development since 1989, saying it was
``something of which we should all be proud.''
<p>
   The phone-in program on government-owned radio came a day after
Tung delivered his first annual policy address as Hong Kong's chief
executive.
<p>
   Wednesday's speech dwelled mainly on bread-and-butter issues,
with only brief comment on the future of Hong Kong democracy,
leading the pro-democracy camp to complain that the subject is low
on Tung's agenda.
<p>
   But the array of questions on the 90-minute radio program
suggested it isn't foremost in the public mind either. Almost all
the questions were about the housing shortage, pollution and
economics.
<p>
   One woman asked whether discussion of Taiwanese and Tibetan
independence was permissible, given China's hostility to the
subject.
<p>
   ``These are very sensitive issues, not just to our country but
to Chinese people everywhere,'' Tung replied. ``I for one feel very
much that Taiwan and Tibet are part of China.''
<p>
   ``Freedom of expression is perfectly all right,'' he said. But
he drew a distinction between discussing independence on the radio,
and advocating it ``very actively.''
<p>
   ``The key is how to draw the line,'' Tung said, adding that it
would be defined in a law to be enacted by the legislature after it
is elected next May.

Resistance leader calls for end to fighting, killing in Cambodia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  A top resistance commander loyal to
ousted co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh called Thursday for an
end to the fighting in the country's northwest, saying it has
killed too many Cambodians.
<p>
   ``I don't want to pursue any more fighting between Cambodians
and Cambodians,'' said Nhek Bunchhay, who since a July 5-6 coup has
led resistance forces opposing the Phnom Penh government. He is a
former senior official in the royal army.
<p>
   ``I want to negotiate peace and see democracy take root
according to the wishes of the Cambodian people,'' he said in a
faxed statement. It also said his forces have killed at least 2,000
of coup leader Hun Sen's troops.
<p>
   But he also set conditions for peace talks that the government
is certain to reject.
<p>
   A relatively small force of Ranariddh's loyalists have been
stubbornly holding on to a small enclave at O'Smach along
Cambodia's northern border since the prince was deposed by his
co-premier Hun Sen.
<p>
   The fighting against Hun Sen's stronger and better-equipped army
also has been spreading slowly east to Preah Vihear province and to
Samlaut, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of O'Smach.
<p>
   ``In my name as an army commander and a Cambodian, I am very
upset about the dead and wounded,'' said Nhek Bunchhay, adding that
his troops have suffered minor casualties but ``the blood which
dropped on the ground is also that of Cambodians.''
<p>
   Nhek Bunchhay outlined conditions for peace talks. He demanded
that Prince Ranariddh, now in self-exile, be allowed to return to
Phnom Penh as the legal co-premier and president of the royalist
Funcinpec party.
<p>
   Hun Sen has previously said that the prince would have to stand
trial if he returns to Phnom Penh. He has charged the prince with
illegally smuggling weapons into the country and of negotiating
with Khmer Rouge terrorists.

Philippine currency trading suspended twice as peso strengthens
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  The Philippine peso strengthened
dramatically against the dollar Thursday from its previous-day
record low, triggering trading suspensions as it hit two volatility
limits.
<p>
   The stock market's main index, meanwhile, surged 3 percent and
finished back above the psychological 2,000-point mark.
<p>
   A system of volatility bands was introduced early this week to
curb recent sharp fluctuations in both directions in the
peso-dollar rate. Each time a limit is hit, trading is suspended
for a cooling-off period for all trades outside that band.
<p>
   Trading was halted twice in the morning as the peso
strengthened. At midday it averaged 35.021 pesos per dollar
compared to 35.565 pesos Wednesday.
<p>
   A new central bank guideline preventing banks with sufficient
dollar holdings from tapping its overnight lending facility caused
a surge in dollar sales, traders said.
<p>
   The central bank re-opened its overnight lending window
Wednesday after keeping it closed since Aug. 20. The central bank
is offering an overnight lending rate of 15 percent, lower than its
previous rate of 18 percent and far below the interbank call loan
rate which averaged 68.5 percent on Wednesday.
<p>
   The central bank also was selling dollars Thursday to buoy the
Philippine currency, traders said.
<p>
   Stocks closed sharply higher as declining interest rates and the
stronger peso propped up the market for a second day Thursday,
traders said.
<p>
   The central bank's decision to re-open its overnight lending
facility helped ease interest rates, the key factor that has drawn
money away from stocks to fixed income investments such as bonds,
traders said.
<p>
   The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged 58.67
points, or 3 percent, to 2,005.50, according to preliminary
figures. On Wednesday the index gained 26.2 points.

Suspected Muslim kidnappers execute Philippine Protestant pastor
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   IPIL, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Suspected Muslim bandits shot to death
a Protestant pastor Thursday after mistakenly believing they were
encircled by soldiers as they prepared to receive ransom from the
captive's wife, police said.
<p>
   Police said five kidnappers brought Winifrido Rio by boat to a
shore in southern Zamboanga del Sur province and asked a fisherman
if there were soldiers around. The man, unaware they were
kidnappers, casually answered there was a military detachment
nearby.
<p>
   The kidnappers then shot Rio, pastor of the Alliance Church in
Ipil town, in the back of the head with a rifle and fled by boat,
police superintendent Ernanito Baul said.
<p>
   ``The kidnappers apparently thought they were being trapped,''
said Baul.
<p>
   Rio's wife, waiting nearby with 50,000 pesos (dlrs 1,450)
ransom, heard the gunshot and run to find her husband dead.
<p>
   A police official said the wife had gone alone to the shore in
the coastal village of Sanito to hand over the money to the
kidnappers for her husband's freedom. She had cautiously kept the
ransom negotiations out of the knowledge of police.
<p>
   Military troops have been deployed to look for the kidnappers.
<p>
   Rio was seized July 3 by men believed to be former members of
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger of two separatist
Muslim groups still battling the Philippine government.
<p>
   Although the military and police have launched a crackdown on
kidnappings, many abductions still occur all over the Philippines,
often for ransom.

Che Guevara supporters, military commemorate guerrilla campaign

<TEXT>
<p>
   LA HIGUERA, Bolivia (AP)  &MD;  Hundreds of sympathizers of Ernesto
``Che'' Guevara trekked through jungle paths to retrace the
guerrilla leader's final steps before his capture by soldiers three
decades ago.
<p>
   The march Wednesday continued on to La Higuera, the village
where Guevara was taken and killed the following day by CIA-trained
Bolivian troops in an event that buried dreams of a continent-wide
communist revolution.
<p>
   A weeklong series of events here commemorating the
Cuban-Argentine guerrilla has drawn musicians, artists, labor
leaders, politicians and leftists from around the world, the most
famous being the widow of former French President Francois
Mitterrand.
<p>
   ``Even though Guevara was killed by bullets 30 years ago, he is
still alive because the people have taken on his struggle in favor
of the poor and the liberation of Latin America,'' organizer
Osvaldo Peredo said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a few hundreds miles (kilometers) away, in Camiri,
President Hugo Banzer Suarez marked the victory over Guevara's
rebellion, unveiling a bronze monument to 55 soldiers who died
fighting Guevara and his guerrilla army.
<p>
   ``The guerrillas who invaded our country did not have any saving
mission or social solidarity,'' the retired general and former
dictator said Wednesday.
<p>
   ``Their objectives were oriented toward projecting a
revolutionary movement of continental reach. It was an effort to
impose through weapons a political, economic system and ideology
contrary to our historical and cultural traditions.''
<p>
   Hundreds of soldiers and veterans took part in the ceremonies in
Camiri, including Antonio Zapata, president of a veterans'
organization.
<p>
   Zapata said it was not dignified for Bolivia to allow a ``group
of fanatics who wish to use national territory to pay homage to a
person who wanted to plant blood and mourning in Latin America.''
<p>
   Bolivian special forces seized Guevara and other rebels on Oct.
8, 1967, near Vado del Yeso, in a remote jungle area southeast of
the capital.
<p>
   Guevara was executed by a Bolivian officer outside a schoolhouse
in this village on orders from then-President Gen. Rene Barrientos.
<p>
   His body was flown 300 miles (500 kms) away to Vallegrande,
where it was dumped in an unmarked common grave along with bodies
of the other guerrillas. The remains were found and returned to
Cuba in July.
<p>
   A series of tributes  &MD;  including concerts, dance performances,
lectures, painting and photography exhibits  &MD;  take place through
the weekend to commemorate Guevara.
<p>
   Born in Argentina in 1928, Guevara was a charismatic doctor who
fought with Fidel Castro to overthrow Cuban ruler Fulgencio Batista
in 1959 and was Cuba's second most influential leader until he
returned to South America to foment revolution.
<p>
   Che remains a figure of almost mythic proportions to some, a
terrorist to others.
<p>
   His bearded image became a symbol of a generation. As the 30th
anniversary of his death approached, his image sprouted on
everything from T-shirts to beer labels and record covers.

Human rights workers seek identity of two unearthed bodies
By UNG KOLVOITHDEY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Human rights workers said Thursday
they were trying to determine if the bodies of two men executed
after the July coup were senior military officials loyal to the
ousted co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
<p>
   The rights workers, who unearthed two badly decomposed bodies in
Kompong Speu province Wednesday, said they are investigating to see
if the latest victims are a senior intelligence officer, Gen. Chao
Sambath, and a Defense Ministry official, Gen. Kroch Yoeum.
<p>
   ``We are thinking of bringing in a team of forensic experts,''
said a human rights worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   A witness to the July execution of Chao Sambath and Kroch Yoeum
will also be asked to describe the clothes the victims were
wearing.
<p>
   One of the men buried in the shallow grave in Kompong Speu had
been decapitated and his hands were tied behind his back with a
string from a hammock. He wore a military uniform, and he had a pin
with a picture of Cambodia's king in his pocket, witnesses said.
<p>
   The other, wearing khaki pants and a blue shirt, was lying face
down in the grave. His hands were also bound.
<p>
   Villagers who first discovered the grave, about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) south of Phnom Penh, said they heard gunshots in the
area days after Ranariddh was ousted from power in a coup by his
co-premier, Hun Sen.
<p>
   They believed the victims were high-ranking military officials
loyal to the prince.
<p>
   Loyalists of Hun Sen were allegedly involved in dozens of
executions and hundreds of incidents of torture against Ranariddh's
loyalists following his overthrow. Scores of royalists went into
hiding and others joined Ranariddh in self-exile.
<p>
   A 23-page report prepared by the U.N. Human Rights Center and
given to Hun Sen details more than 40 executions, mainly of
military officials loyal to Ranariddh.
<p>
   The report describes an account of the capture of Chao Sambath
and Kroch Yoeum and about 30 of their subordinates on July 8, three
days after Ranariddh was deposed.
<p>
   Soldiers of paratrooper commando Regiment 911 searched the
captives and brought them to a school where they were detained with
other captured soldiers, the report said.
<p>
   Orders were issued by the general staff to execute the two
officers. They were handed over to soldiers who brought them into
the forest where they were executed with three bullets to the head,
the report said.
<p>
   The government has previously indicated that the two men were
killed in battle, though officials also claimed that Chao Sambath
committed suicide after he was captured by government forces.
<p>
   Previous promises by the government to investigate human rights
abuses have yielded no arrests.

Bank: Brunei seen unruffled by regional currency turmoil
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  Currency turmoil afflicting the rest of
Southeast Asia is not expected to hit Brunei and the small
sultanate remains on track to achieve growth forecast for this year
and next, a bank report says.
<p>
   The Standard Chartered Bank's fourth quarter outlook report,
received in Singapore Thursday, said the turmoil will have little
impact because Brunei is a net capital exporter.
<p>
   Growth of 3.0 percent had been projected this year for Brunei
and 4.0 percent in 1998, the bank said.
<p>
   ``Brunei's gross domestic product growth will stay on a
relatively even keel compared to last year's,'' the report said.
The Brunei economy registered gross domestic product growth of 3.3
percent in 1996.
<p>
   However, there are implications for the Brunei dollar, which is
linked to the Singapore dollar, the bank, with headquarters in
London, said.
<p>
   Because the Brunei dollar has maintained its relative strength
when compared with other regional currencies, ``in terms of export
competitiveness, this makes it harder for viable economic
activities to take root in Brunei,'' said the report.
<p>
   In an effort to reduce its dependence on oil exports, Brunei has
been trying to expand the manufacturing and financial sectors. The
country earlier this year announced its Seventh National Plan to
help cut the dependence on oil.
<p>
   Crude oil exports account for about 40 percent of GDP.
<p>
   Standard Chartered said the currency turmoil offers an
opportunity for Brunei to move economically closer to its
neighbors.
<p>
   ``Liquidity (in Southeast Asia) is extremely tight and many
corporates and financial institutions in the region are seeking an
injection of funds. This gives the Bruneians an opportunity to
increase their presence and participation in the regional
economies,'' the report said.
<p>
   The bank also said another implication of the turmoil is that
investing in the region will now command a premium. Given this
circumstance, ``it may be timely for Brunei to make a big push for
the activities it wants to target'' such as financial activities
and as a transshipment center.
<p>
   The bank also said that the slight dip in oil prices in recent
months shouldn't give rise to any major impact on the economy.
Also, with the weakening of the Brunei dollar against the U.S.
dollar, inflationary pressures will emerge but shouldn't be
significant.

Biodiversity will be focus of conservation law review, minister
says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The government will review Australia's
conservation laws, including consideration of new legislation
specifically protecting biodiversity, Environment Minister Robert
Hill said Thursday.
<p>
   Hill told an environmental law conference that Australia's
federal environmental laws badly needed updating and that
biodiversity would be the focus of any review.
<p>
   A special law protecting biodiversity would be among the first
such laws in the world, Hill said.
<p>
   ``Biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of human life on
earth because it supports life-sustaining processes that purify our
water, fertilize our soils and manage our climate,'' Hill said.
<p>
   ``Australia is ... the only developed nation that can be
characterized as mega-diverse and bears a special responsibility to
protect biodiversity.''
<p>
   A biodiversity conservation law would be considered as part of a
reform package aimed at streamlining state and federal
environmental responsibilities, he said.
<p>
   The law would integrate existing endangered species protection
and parks and wildlife management laws, but would be more that just
a compilation of existing legislation.
<p>
   ``It could also also contain provisions discharging Australia's
obligations under international treaties for the protection of
migratory birds ... and other migratory species ... as well as
whales,'' Hill said.
<p>
   Hill said the government recognized the importance of protecting
biodiversity in Australia, which has a high rate of species
extinction.
<p>
   ``It hasn't been one of our proud records as Australians. We
want to do better in future,'' he said.

Fugitive Swiss banker to be charged with illegal entry
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A fugitive Swiss banker who allegedly
caused massive losses at Bank Rothschild AG Zurich will be charged
Friday with illegal entry into Thailand.
<p>
   Thai Immigration Police Lt. Amornchai Panya said that Juerg Heer
was likely to be immediately fined 6,000 baht (dlrs 166) and then
undergo a quick extradition hearing.
<p>
   The speed with which he is sent home will depend on completion
of the formal paperwork by the Swiss, Amornchai said.
<p>
   Heer, 61, a former credit manager of the bank, is accused of
siphoning off 65 million Swiss francs (dlrs 44 million at current
rates) from 1986 to 1992.
<p>
   The bank dismissed him in 1992 for suspected irregularities and
he was arrested. But after two months in jail, authorities released
him provisionally and allowed him to travel to Thailand on
vacation. He never returned.
<p>
   Bank Rothschild, a normally secretive institution, held a press
conference at the time to deny Heer's allegation that it operated a
``criminal system.''
<p>
   The bank alleged that Heer's transactions caused total damages
of 271 million francs (dlrs 186 million).
<p>
   After the case came to light, the bank underwent a management
shakeup and was forced to arrange for a capital injection.
<p>
   Heer allegedly used the money to finance a lavish lifestyle and
accumulate 20 million francs (dlrs 14 million) worth of expensive
cars, furniture and art.
<p>
   There was strong public interest in the fugitive banker  &MD;  not
least because of the rewards of up to 53,000 francs (dlrs 37,000)
offered for information about him.
<p>
   Heer was arrested in Thailand last Saturday.

Mrs. Clinton pushes for bigger women's role in `vibrant democracy'
With Panama-First Ladies
By NANCY BENAC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)  &MD;  Hillary Rodham Clinton is using her
fourth annual get-together with the first ladies of Latin America
to take stock and set new goals for improving the lives of women
and children in the Americas.
<p>
   Her focus at this year's Conference of Wives of Heads of State
and Government of the Americas is on making sure women are equal
players with men ``in the social, political and economic lives of
our countries.''
<p>
   Melding her traditional emphasis on women with new attention to
human rights, Mrs. Clinton's message for her keynote address
Thursday was that ``a vibrant democracy depends on women's
empowerment and full participation.''
<p>
   To reach that goal, she says, will require changes in both law
and attitude: Women of the region need better legal protections
against domestic violence, stronger property rights, more access to
credit and a bigger chance to get involved in politics.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton first met with first ladies from the region in
1994, when she invited them to attend a symposium on children while
their husbands were meeting President Clinton at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami.
<p>
   The women reciprocated by inviting her to attend their annual
first ladies' conference, and this is the third year Mrs. Clinton
has joined them. This year's gathering also drew Queen Fabiola of
Belgium as well as Ana Botella, the wife of Spanish prime minister
Jose Maria Aznar.
<p>
   One goal was to take stock of progress on past conference goals,
including eradicating measles, reducing maternal mortality and
education reforms.
<p>
   Beyond that, Panama's Dora Boyd de Perez inaugurated this year's
two-day meeting Wednesday by outlining four topics: educating for
human rights, eradicating child labor, helping rural women increase
independence, and education during the 21st century.
<p>
   Rural women in Latin America are paid a pittance for city work
and many children are abused and made to work long hours.
<p>
   During her three-day visit to Panama, Mrs. Clinton also will
swear in new Peace Corps volunteers, tour the Panama Canal and
visit a rural village where a women's group is promoting
reforestation in the canal's watershed area with help from the U.S.
Agency for International Development. The women sell seedlings and
plants, allowing them to supplement meager family incomes.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton returns to Washington on Friday night, then quickly
heads south again with her husband on Sunday for Brazil, Argentina
and Venezuela.
<p>
   The back-to-back visits to Latin America come amid signs of
progress for women in the region. Female life expectancy has
increased to 72 years, women's literacy has risen to 85 percent and
girls' enrollment in primary and secondary schools has increased to
87 percent.
<p>
   And yet, ``the potential of women in Latin America and the
Caribbean has been undermined by poverty, violence, inadequate
education and occupational opportunities and exclusion from
leadership positions,'' the Women's Leadership Conference of the
Americas, a network of women leaders, said in a position paper.
<p>
   To reinforce her message, Mrs. Clinton will witness the signing
of an AID grant for dlrs 4.5 million to the Inter-American
Institute on Human Rights, a Latin American organization that
promotes respect for human rights and democracy.
<p>
   Human rights groups are urging Mrs. Clinton to use her visit as
an opportunity to protest the Panamanian government's efforts to
deport Gustavo Gorriti, a prominent journalist who reported on
corruption in the campaign and the administration of President
Perez Balladares and the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
<p>
   Administration officials said the first lady was likely to raise
the issue privately with Panamanian officials.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton is visiting Panama as the withdrawal of U.S. troops
and the handover of U.S. bases accelerate in preparation for
turning control of the canal and surrounding land over to Panama at
the end of 1999.
<p>
   The gradual handover was negotiated under treaties signed 20
years ago by President Carter and Panamanian strongman Gen. Omar
Torrijos. A little more than 4,400 American troops remain in
Panama, less than half the 1994 levels.

Dollar and stocks lower
Eds: UPDATES throughout with afternoon trading
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower Thursday on
worries the government won't implement special measures to boost
the economy as had been expected. The U.S. dollar was lower against
the yen.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 242.26, or
1.37 percent, closing at 17,376.92. On Wednesday, the index gained
107.99 points, or 0.62 percent, closing at 17,619.18.
<p>
   A decline in U.S. stocks drove Japanese shares lower early in
the day.
<p>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled U.S. stock and
bond markets with a warning that tight labor conditions could soon
prove inflationary.
<p>
   Japanese stocks continued to decline amid worries the economy
may weaken further. Traders said it's now unlikely that the
government will enact a special tax cut or a supplementary budget
to boost growth as some market participants had expected.
<p>
   ``The market is certainly heading downwards, and it is seen as a
matter of time before the Nikkei falls below the year's lowest
level'' of 17,303.65 set on Jan. 10, said Hideaki Nakagawa, general
manager of the stock division at Meiko Securities Co.
<p>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 17.72 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,360.24. The
TOPIX rose 3.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,377.96 Wednesday.
<p>
   Declines outnumbers advances 783 to 318, while 155 issues were
unchanged. Trading on the main section was estimated at 400 million
shares, up from 301 million shares Wednesday.
<p>
   In the currency market, the dollar was changing hands at 121.22
yen, down 1.04 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late
New York level of 121.05 yen.
<p>
   In New York overnight, sharp declines in stocks and bonds led
investors to sell the dollar against the yen.
<p>
   The dollar rebounded slightly early in Tokyo as currency traders
shifted their focus to the German mark and yen. The mark rose
against the yen on speculation the German central bank would soon
raise interest rates.
<p>
   Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to
international investors.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.770 percent from 1.750 percent Wednesday, driving
its price down to 108.47 from 108.70 yen.

Precede CHAPEL HILL, North Carolina
Source tells AP that Dean Smith will step down
Eds: RECASTS. ADDS new details and background. Will be led after
1800 GMT news conference.

AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
<p>
   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP)  &MD;  Dean Smith, the winningest coach
in the history of U.S. college basketball, will retire Thursday
after 36 seasons at North Carolina, The Associated Press has
learned.
<p>
   A source told The Associated Press that Smith would announce his
retirement Thursday in the Dean Dome  &MD;  the facility named after
him.
<p>
   Some fans and students slept overnight outside the Dean Dome,
hoping to catch a glimpse of Smith or attend his 2 p.m. (1800 GMT)
news conference.
<p>
   For years Smith, 66, said he would come to the office one day
and decide to retire from the game he's made his life for the
better part of 36 seasons.
<p>
   That day for the Tar Heels coach apparently came Wednesday as he
told his team and incoming recruits of his intentions, shocking
most everyone in the basketball fraternity once word leaked out.
<p>
   Smith, arguably the most popular sports figure in the state,
said earlier this year he planned to honor his contract through
2001.
<p>
   ``I take each year as it comes,'' Smith said in March, ``and I
won't make that decision in April, because every April I am
probably (tired). So, you wait to see how excited you are in
August. For 36 years I guess I've been excited in August and
September. If that ever changed up until 2001, then I would make
that decision.''
<p>
   A source close to the program, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told the AP that Smith called him Wednesday to tell him
the news. He also told him that Bill Guthridge, Smith's assistant
for the past 31 seasons, would succeed Smith.
<p>
   Smith and Guthridge, 60, have been virtually inseparable through
the years. Guthridge turned down several head coaching
opportunities to remain on Smith's staff.
<p>
   Guthridge said during last season's NCAA college championship
tournament he wasn't interested in becoming North Carolina's head
coach should Smith retire in the next few seasons.
<p>
   Despite his age, Smith leaves at the top of his profession,
taking the Tar Heels to his 11th Final Four last season. Smith also
guided the team to his 13th Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
title during the 1996-97 campaign, which started with his first 0-3
league start.
<p>
   The timing of the move also came as a shock to many, considering
the Tar Heels are just nine days away from opening practice and are
considered one of the contenders for the 1998 national title. Smith
has won that title twice.
<p>
   ``Coach Smith left a message for me and when I called him back,
he just came out and told me he was retiring,'' said Kris Lang, a
senior at Gastonia Huss High School who plans to play for UNC
during the 1998-99 season.
<p>
   ``He said he hoped I understood, and I said I did,'' Lang said.
``He told me he was still going to be around. He just wasn't going
to be coaching anymore.''
<p>
   The cable television sports network ESPN, citing sources close
to the North Carolina program, reported Wednesday night that Smith
was not stepping down for health reasons.
<p>
   UNC sports information director Steve Kirschner refused to give
details about the news conference, saying only that the school
planned a ``major announcement.'' He would not comment when asked
whether it concerned Smith.
<p>
   Smith, with a career record of 879-254, broke Adolph Rupp's
career victory mark of 876 last season during the NCAA tournament
in Winston-Salem. He won national titles in 1982 and 1993.
<p>
   Smith's teams have finished in the top three of the Atlantic
Coast Conference for a record 33 straight seasons, including last
season's second-place mark.
<p>
   Smith's teams have also posted an NCAA-record 27 straight 20-win
seasons.
<p>
   Smith's only losing season came in his first, when the Tar Heels
went 8-9 in 1961-62.
<p>
   He has coached 30 All-Americas, including Michael Jordan, Jerry
Stackhouse, James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Mitch Kupchak, Charlie Scott
and Billy Cunningham.

Helicopter missing on haze-covered Sumatra in Indonesia

<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Emergency teams were searching a
haze-covered area on the island of Sumatra Thursday for a missing
police helicopter with three crew members aboard, the official
Antara news agency reported.
<p>
   Brig. Gen. Deddi Ganrijadi Gantika said the helicopter
disappeared Wednesday on a flight from Batam to Palembang, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
<p>
   He said the helicopter carried a police lieutenant, a pilot and
a mechanic. Radio contact was lost about halfway through the
flight.
<p>
   The search area has been shrouded for weeks by thick haze from
hundreds of forest and scrub fires. Bad visibility has forced
several airports to cease operations.
<p>
   On Sept. 26, a Garuda Airlines Airbus A300-B4 crashed near the
city of Medan, also on Sumatra, as it descended into the haze on
its approach for landing. All 234 aboard were killed.
<p>
   The cause of the crash, Indonesia's worst, has not been
established. Searchers have yet to find the wrecked plane's black
box flight data and voice recorders.

Suicide bid politician released from hospital

<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The opposition politician who tried
to kill himself after being linked to a travel expenses abuse
scandal was discharged from hospital Thursday, a spokesman for his
party said.
<p>
   Nick Sherry, 41, slashed his wrists on Oct. 2 after the
government accused him of wrongly claiming US dlrs 30,000
(Australian dlrs 40,000) in accommodation expenses when he was
staying with his mother in Tasmania.
<p>
   A spokesman for Labor leader Kim Beazley said Sherry had been
declared medically fit but ordered to rest by doctors.
<p>
   Sherry earlier announced from his hospital bed he would be
resigning from the Labor opposition's spokesman on finance matters.
He will remain in parliament.
<p>
   Sherry had been targeted by the conservative government for the
alleged travel expenses misuse.
<p>
   The scandal had earlier forced the resignations of three
government ministers and the firing of senior staff within Prime
Minister John Howard's department.

Stanford band irks Catholic officials; athletic director apologizes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STANFORD, California (AP)  &MD;  Stanford University's marching band
is at the center of controversy over its pregame and halftime shows
during last week's football game against Notre Dame.
<p>
   Athletic Director Ted Leland has apologized to more than 30
administrators from Catholic schools who were angered at shows
during the game.
<p>
   The shows featured a parody of the Irish potato famine, a mock
debate between a Catholic cardinal and the devil, and referred to
the Irish as ``stinking drunks.''
<p>
   Leland's apology referred to the band's act as ``tasteless.''
<p>
   ``In their sophomoric attempt at humor, the band crossed the
line from funny to obnoxious and offensive,'' he wrote.
<p>
   But the band refused to apologize. The athletic department must
approve all Stanford band field shows in advance due to a number of
past controversies stemming from field shows. Scott McKissen, the
band's manager, said Saturday's shows were approved.
<p>
   ``Our field show was meant to poke fun at the Notre Dame mascot
(the Fighting Irish) and not a group of people,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, some people took it far more seriously than it was
intended.''
<p>
   School officials said they planned no sanctions against the
band.
<p>
   Tim Brosnan, principal of Archbishop Mitty, a Catholic high
school in San Jose, said he appreciates Leland's apology. But he
criticized the university's refusal to punish the band.
<p>
   ``Stanford needs to realize that this sort of institutional
idiocy that is their band  &MD;  when it goes out in front of 75,000
people who pay to see the game  &MD;  is representing the university,''
Brosnan said.
<p>
   ``When you send them out to do a performance at halftime, you're
giving them a venue that is substantial to represent that kind of
bigotry. And that's what it was: It was bigotry.''

Strong quake shakes northern Japan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  A strong earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude
of 6.0, shook northern Japan Thursday, but were no reports of
damage or injuries.
<p>
   Despite its strength, the undersea quake's depth and distance
meant it was not strongly felt on land.
<p>
   The quake, at 6:21 a.m. (2121 GMT Wednesday), was roughly 50
kilometers (30 miles) under the sea and 250 kilometers (150 miles)
out in the Pacific Ocean from Kushiro, on Japan's northern main
island of Hokkaido, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
<p>
   The agency said it registered only two on the Japanese scale of
seven, meaning it was strong enough to slide doors.
<p>
   Further quakes, believed to be aftershocks, were recorded at
12:29 p.m. (0329 GMT) with a magnitude of 5.4, at 1:01 p.m. (0401
GMT) with a magnitude of 5.3, and 1:03 p.m. (0403 GMT) with a
magnitude of 4.9.
<p>
   No tidal wave warnings were issued.

Georgian government hopes diplomat can serve sentence at home
By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP)  &MD;  Government officials said Thursday that
a Georgian diplomat did the right thing by pleading guilty to
involuntary manslaughter charges in Washington and expressed hope
he could serve his sentence at home.
<p>
   Gueorgui Makharadze, 36, the second-ranking officer in Georgia's
Embassy in Washington, crashed into a line of cars at a busy
downtown intersection on Jan. 3, killing 16-year-old Joviane
Waltrick.
<p>
   He pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of involuntary
manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault. Makharadze, who
is being held in Washington without bond until his sentencing Dec.
19, could get up to 70 years in prison.
<p>
   ``Gueorgui Makharadze made the right step by pleading guilty,''
said Georgy Burduli, a deputy Georgian foreign minister. ``By doing
this, he prevented an anti-Georgian campaign in the United States.
I believe that the court must take into consideration his sincere
plea.''
<p>
   U.S. prosecutors said Makharadze had a blood alcohol level of at
least .15 percent when the accident occurred. The legal limit in
Washington is .10.
<p>
   Although he could have been shielded from prosecution because of
his diplomatic status, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
waived diplomatic immunity, saying he did not want to damage
relations between the United States and Georgia.
<p>
   ``I take full responsibility for what happened,'' Makharadze
told the court on Wednesday.
<p>
   Officials in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, said they hoped U.S.
authorities would allow Makharadze serve his prison time in the
former Soviet republic rather than the United States.
<p>
   ``At the moment we can't demand that Makharadze serve his prison
term in Georgia because there is no corresponding agreement signed
between Georgia and the U.S.A.,'' Revaz Kipiani, Georgia's deputy
prosecutor general, told The Associated Press. ``I hope, however,
that we'll sign such an agreement in the near future and that will
provide an opportunity for Makharadze to serve his sentence here.''

Thapa wins vote of confidence in parliament
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  Nepal's newly appointed Prime Minister
Surya Bahadur Thapa won a vote of confidence in parliament
Thursday, two days after being sworn in as the country's fourth
prime minister in three years.
<p>
   Thapa, who needed a simple majority of 103 votes, got 109. There
were only two votes against the motion. Other lawmakers, including
those in the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal, abstained.
<p>
   Thapa's main backers in the 205-member lower house are from the
Nepali Congress, which gave him 86 votes Thursday. Seventeen
supporters were from Thapa's royalist party and six from smaller
groups.
<p>
   Thapa initially had the support of 103 legislators, but gained a
few more votes Thursday.
<p>
   Earlier this week, Thapa formed a coalition government after
toppling a government dominated by the Communist Party of Nepal and
the National Democratic Party. His own party is a faction of the
National Democratic Party.
<p>
   Thapa joined with the main opposition Nepali Congress to pull
down the six-month-old coalition.
<p>
   Politics in Nepal has been unstable since a pro-democracy
movement in 1990 ended the absolute monarchy.
<p>
   Thapa said his government was committed to following liberal
economic policies and encouraging private and foreign investments
for the development of the country.

BC-Hong Kong-Child Immigrants
Court throws out appeal against children's deportation
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  The government won a victory for its
immigration law Thursday when a court threw out an appeal against
the deportation of China-born children of Hong Kong residents.
<p>
   The suit was brought on behalf of four girls aged 7 to 10, along
with a 19-year-old man. They are among thousands, mostly children
of cross-border marriages, who have entered Hong Kong illegally but
claim residence because one of their parents has Hong Kong papers.
<p>
   The Basic Law, the constitution China wrote for Hong Kong,
grants them residency. But as soon as Britain handed Hong Kong back
to China on July 1, the legislature passed a law entitling the
government to expel immigrants who were not part of the quota
agreed between China and Hong Kong.
<p>
   The government feared an unmanageable influx of up to 75,000
child immigrants once the Basic Law took effect. Under the terms of
the sovereignty change, the border stays in place and the Hong Kong
government maintains its own immigration controls.
<p>
   Lawyers argued that the new law was unconstitutional. They also
said it was flawed by being retroactive, since it empowered the
government to deport children who arrived before the legislation
was passed.
<p>
   But the Court of First Instance ruled that the government had
not violated the Basic Law, and upheld the retroactive status of
the legislation.
<p>
   It held that the children broke the rules because they entered
without a Chinese exit visa.
<p>
   ``We are very disappointed because these children will face
deportation immediately,'' said Diana Pang of the Society of
Community Organizations, an advocacy group that supported the
lawsuit.
<p>
   She said the ruling would be appealed, and the government gave
no immediate indication when the children would be expelled.
<p>
   Spouses and children of Hong Kong residents have to wait years
for Chinese exit visas, and maintain that the system is corrupted
by bribery.

Sri Lanka welcomes U.S. decision to declare Tamil rebels as
terrorist group
By DILIP GANGULY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  The government on Thursday welcomed
the U.S. decision to declare the Tamil Tigers a terrorist group,
saying it will force the rebels to negotiate and stop their
14-year-old insurgency.
<p>
   ``At last the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has got the
correct label. Now they will have problems in raising funds,'' said
Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe, the spokesman for the defense
ministry.
<p>
   ``With less funds they will have problems in getting weapons and
we plan to push them militarily to the point where they will have
to talk peace,'' Munasinghe told reporters.
<p>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took steps Wednesday
to block fund raising, freeze assets and punish U.S.-based backers
of the Tamil Tigers and 29 other foreign organizations she
designated as terrorist groups.
<p>
   ``It is a victory for Sri Lanka's foreign policy and testimony
of a strong and healthy bilateral relationship that exists between
Sri Lanka and the United States,'' the foreign ministry said in a
statement Thursday.
<p>
   The Tamil Tigers maintain a major office in London and also are
active in promoting their cause and seeking financial support
elsewhere in Europe and in North America. Most of the group's funds
are believed to come from sympathizers in Southeast Asia and the
Gulf.
<p>
   The LTTE, which rose from a ragtag band of 26 fighters in 1983,
is leading a violent campaign for the secession of northern and
eastern Sri Lanka to form an independent homeland for Tamils, who
make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18 million people. Not all Tamils
support the Tamil Tigers.
<p>
   An LTTE suicide bomb attack that killed former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi in southern India in May 1991, proved the
Tigers were capable of striking outside this island nation.
<p>
   The rebels are led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, an eighth-grade
dropout who was taught guerrilla warfare at a training camp in
Lebanon run by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
<p>
   Prabhakaran's fighters, most in their teens, are known for their
brutality and discipline. Each wears a cyanide capsule around the
neck and has sworn to commit suicide if captured.
<p>
   Ethnic riots in 1983 that followed the ambush of 13 Sinhalese
soldiers in Jaffna  &MD;  an attack Prabhakaran is reported to have led
 &MD;  saw thousands of Tamils fleeing to northern Sri Lanka and being
recruited by the Tigers.
<p>
   According to independent estimates, over 6,000 rebels have been
killed since the beginning of the war. Estimates of the group's
current strength range from 3,500 to 6,000.
<p>
   In the last two years, the military has pushed the rebels out of
major towns in the north and into the jungles. Fierce fighting
around two northern towns earlier this week killed at least 500
combatants, according to government figures.

New Canadian ambassador promises more aid to southern Philippines
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Canada will provide more aid to
strife-torn southern Philippine provinces trying to catch up
economically with the rest of the nation, its new ambassador said
Thursday.
<p>
   Ambassador John Treleaven made the assurance during the
presentation of his credentials to President Fidel Ramos.
<p>
   Treleaven said he sees an even better relationship between the
two countries during his term as Canada's chief representative in
Manila.
<p>
   ``It is my hope to see during my tenure an exponential growth in
our commercial relations,'' he said.
<p>
   He said Canada hopes its development assistance will help the
impoverished southern Philippines achieve peace and catch up
economically.
<p>
   Last year, the Philippines signed a peace accord with the main
Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, ending a
quarter-century separatist rebellion that killed more than 120,000
people, primarily in the southern Philippines.
<p>
   However, two smaller rebel groups are still fighting the
government in the south.
<p>
   Early this year, the government opened preliminary peace
negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, one of the
groups. That led to the signing in July of a cease-fire accord
covering all rebel-held areas in the southern Philippines.
<p>
   Government and rebel negotiators are scheduled to draft the
cease-fire guidelines next month and hope to start formal peace
negotiations next year.
<p>
   After the meeting with Ramos, Treleaven placed a wreath at a
monument to Jose Rizal, a Philippine national hero.
<p>
   Before being posted to Manila, Treleaven was a member of the
Jobs Strategy Task Force in the Canadian Privy Council Office. He
has also served at embassies in Puerto Rico, Britain, Costa Rica,
Hong Kong and Japan.

Amnesty report criticizes human rights abuses in Lebanon
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Amnesty International on Thursday accused
the government of carrying out arbitrary political arrests, torture
and ill-treatment of suspects in post-civil war Lebanon.
<p>
   Despite the violations, the situation represents a ``significant
improvement'' in people's basic rights over the 1975-90 civil war
years, the London-based international human rights organization
said.
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from the government on the
38-page report, which was released by Amnesty officials in Beirut.
<p>
   ``The end of the war has signaled an end to mass human rights
abuses such as deliberate and indiscriminate killings, abductions
and `disappearances,' with the state once more in a position to
uphold the rule of law,'' Amnesty said.
<p>
   However, the group said it was concerned that individuals' basic
rights are often ``curbed in the name of `security' and the need
for enforcing the state's authority.''
<p>
   ``Since the end of the civil war, Lebanon has witnessed mass
arbitrary political arrests and detention, torture and
ill-treatment, violations of the right to fair trial, (and) an
expansion of the number of offenses carrying the death penalty,''
the report said.
<p>
   The emphasis on security and order by the government ``may well
open the door to future human rights violations,'' Amnesty said,
adding that real security and stability can only be maintained if
individual's human rights are protected.
<p>
   It was the first extensive report on internal Lebanese human
rights conditions since the end of the conflict. Amnesty has issued
separate documents in the last few years on human rights conditions
in southern Lebanon, where Israeli occupation forces are fighting
Lebanese guerrillas.
<p>
   In its latest report, Amnesty said hundreds of people have been
arrested but most were released later. It said three people died in
prison since 1994 as a result of alleged beatings.
<p>
   Amnesty urged the government to take steps to end torture and
ill-treatment of detainees. ``Torture may not be routine practice
but some groups are more likely to face torture because they are
usually more targeted by authorities,'' the report said.
<p>
   Amnesty also cited arrests of suspects in Lebanon who ended up
in jails in neighboring Syria, saying such arrests are rarely
acknowledged by Lebanese or Syrian authorities although it appeared
to have taken place ``with the acquiescence of the Lebanese
government.''
<p>
   Amnesty said it was aware of at least 200 Lebanese nationals who
were detained in Syria, mostly without charge or trial. It added
that reports of arrests continue to be received since the end of
the civil war in 1990.
<p>
   Syria has up to 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon and exercises
effective control over the government.
<p>
   Security arrangements, part of a number of accords between
Beirut and Damascus, provide the legal ground for transfer of
suspects to Syrian custody.
<p>
   Amnesty also voiced its usual opposition to the death penalty
and demanded that Lebanese authorities issue a moratorium on
executions, commute the sentences of those on death row and
consider abolishing the death penalty.
<p>
   Lebanon restored capital punishment in 1994 to stem a rise in
crime in the postwar period. Ten people have since been executed by
hanging or by firing squad for security and drug-related crimes.
<p>
   The report also criticized a 1991 Amnesty Law covering political
crimes committed during the civil war. It called for a commission
of inquiry to investigate the cases of 17,415 people, mostly
Lebanese, who disappeared during the conflict. It said the
government should consider compensation for their families.
<p>
   ``A new future of true and lasting peace and human rights
protection in Lebanon is only possible if the country comes to
terms with its past,'' the report said.

Thai leader asks Japanese companies to help repair economy

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
asked Japanese executives Thursday to help repair his nation's
battered economy by buying more Thai products and giving breaks to
Thai borrowers.
<p>
   ``Japanese corporate headquarters should actively use their
marketing networks to promote more exports from their industrial
ventures in Thailand, to third countries as well as back to
Japan,'' Chavalit said in a luncheon speech to a group of Japanese
business leaders.
<p>
   Chavalit arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a three-day visit. His
schedule is packed with meetings with executives of a dozen of
Japan's biggest companies, including Sony Corp., Toyota Motor Corp.
and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. He also is to meet with Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and representatives of the Export-Import Bank of
Japan.
<p>
   Many Japanese manufacturers have built plants in Thailand to
take advantage of lower wages there. In his speech Thursday,
Chavalit appealed to those companies to help revitalize the Thai
economy, now suffering from a dramatic fall in the value of its
currency and a glut of bad property loans.
<p>
   Chavalit asked Japanese automobile and electronics makers to
help tip the trade balance in Thailand's favor, encouraging them to
increase exports from Thai plants while buying more parts from
local companies.
<p>
   ``I also encourage you to increase your efforts to assist small
and medium Thai suppliers with technical assistance and technology
transfer,'' he told the businessmen.
<p>
   Chavalit appealed to Japan's giant trading companies to
``increase their `Buy Thai' programs and assist in identifying new
markets for Thai exports.''
<p>
   He asked bankers to ``be more flexible by rolling over
short-term loans and being pro-active in extending higher levels of
new loans.'' Japanese banks are the leading foreign lenders to Thai
companies.
<p>
   Hirokazu Nakamura, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp., one of
the companies Chavalit visited Thursday, said he expects his
company to export five times more trucks from Thailand by the year
2000 than it did last year.
<p>
   It is not the first time Thailand has turned to Tokyo for
assistance. In August, Japan played a key role in putting together
a dlrs 17.2 billion package to help the country cope with the
economic downturn.
<p>
   For years, Thailand had boasted one of the world's
fastest-growing economies. But in early July, the baht fell
sharply, exacerbating problems in the financial industry and
causing a ripple effect in the currencies of other Southeast Asian
countries.
<p>
   Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said separately Thursday
that he believed the Thai baht is undervalued and should be
stronger. He said the Thai economy will grow this year, but at a
rate of less 2 percent.

<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
coast Thursday with high winds and towering seas as it churned
northward toward Acapulco, Mexico's most popular resort.
<p>
   Pauline raked tourist hotels and fishing villages northwest of
here through the night, churning up 30-foot (9-meter) seas with 115
mph (185 kph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and ruined
residences.
<p>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. But
telephone communication to much of the coast was cut after Pauline
began pummeling the shore Wednesday evening.
<p>
   Tourists huddled in darkened hotels and hundreds of Mexican
coastal dwellers sought refuge in emergency shelters overnight.
<p>
   At 2 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT), Pauline was centered about 70 miles
(112 kilometers) southeast of Acapulco and moving toward it at 13
mph (21 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
<p>
   Hurricane warnings extended as far northwest as Zihuatenejo,
another popular resort hundreds of miles (kilometers) up the coast,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shoreline.
<p>
   Reached in Miami, Hurricane Center specialist Lixion Avila said
early Thursday that Pauline's path remained highly unpredictable
and that forecasters were having trouble tracking the eye.
<p>
   He said a worst-case scenario would have the hurricane directly
striking Acapulco, which has 2.9 million inhabitants, around
midday.
<p>
   ``The whole area is going to get very torrential rain, very
heavy winds and high waves,'' he warned.
<p>
   While the hurricane could weaken rapidly if it headed inland, he
said it could keep up potentially destructive fury by holding close
to water. Regardless, serious threats of flooding and tidal surges
remained.
<p>
   ``Preparations to protect life and property in the warning area
should be rushed to completion,'' the hurricane center advised,
calling Pauline's winds ``life-threatening.''
<p>
   Around Huatulco, Pauline's violent winds and rains turned
streets into rivers, ripped large trees from the ground and sent
makeshift homes of plywood flying. But nowhere did it hit as hard
as in the poor community of Las Tres Cruces, next to the Huatulco
airport.
<p>
   ``Is it gone?'' asked Pablo Avendano Lopez, one of the newly
homeless.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' replied 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo
Mayo, surveying the humble neighborhood where pots and pans lay
scattered amid broken glass and waterlogged mattresses.
<p>
   ``What about my house?'' Avendano Lopez, 45, asked. ``It's
finished,'' Gerardo Mayo said, his voice trembling as rainwater
streaked down his face.
<p>
   ``I've lived through things today that I thought I could never
live through, '' Avendano Lopez said. ``The truth is, I sacrificed
a lot to build this house.''
<p>
   Pauline's eye first touched land Wednesday afternoon west of
Huatulco, and flooding was reported in parts of Oaxaca and
neighboring Chiapas state where similar scenes of destruction
played out.
<p>
   In Tapachula, the southernmost Mexican city of neighboring
Chiapas state, Hernan Leon Merida looked over a sand dune where he
once had a home.
<p>
   Scraps of corrugated tin, a few broken wooden posts and a
tattered banana tree were all that remained after the Coatan River
washed over Leon's humble neighborhood late Tuesday.
<p>
   At least 24 houses  &MD;  mostly tin-and-wood shacks  &MD;  crumpled and
disappeared in floodwaters. Army troops brought in food supplies
and community leaders were considering evacuating everyone to
higher ground.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American Southwest as a
tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for the desert.
<p>
   Also in September, Hurricane Linda packed winds over 200 mph
(320 kph) but lived and died offshore. Forecasters said the El Nino
phenomenon, in which unusually warm Pacific waters disrupt weather
patterns, could be to blame for the high number of powerful
hurricanes.

Key ally of Suu Kyi, imprisoned for eight years, said near death
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A close ally of Burmese democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, imprisoned by the military government for
the past eight years, has been sent to Rangoon General Hospital and
is probably near death, a human rights group said Thursday.
<p>
   Win Tin, a member of the central executive committee of Suu
Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, was
transferred to the hospital from Myingyan Prison near Mandalay
sometime last week, Human Rights Watch Asia said in a news release
received in Bangkok.
<p>
   Sources in Rangoon confirmed that Win Tin has been admitted to
the hospital, but no other details were available. The military
government has not yet responded to queries about him.
<p>
   The former newspaper editor, reportedly viewed by the military
as a troublesome adviser to Suu Kyi, suffers from a heart condition
that requires constant medication. He also developed spinal
problems while in prison.
<p>
   The Burmese military has denied the Red Cross access to
political prisoners. Human rights groups have documented systematic
abuses in the Burmese prison system, considered one of the worst in
the world.
<p>
   Rights groups reported last year that Win Tin had been beaten
and was being kept in a tiny cell meant to house military dogs.
<p>
   He was arrested in June 1989 for allegedly having phone
conversations with the father of a fugitive and sentenced to three
years imprisonment in October of that year, Suu Kyi wrote in a
newspaper column in 1996.
<p>
   In June 1992, he was given an additional 11 years in prison in
what Suu Kyi called ``another farcical trial.'' He was also given
five more years in 1995 for writing a letter to the United Nations.
<p>
   Unlike Suu Kyi and most other NLD members arrested in 1989-90,
Win Tin was never released. Burmese democracy activists in Bangkok
said the military fears Win Tin for his strong intellect, believing
he advised Suu Kyi on political strategy and tactics.
<p>
   ``Immediately after his arrest, U Win Tin was kept without food
and sleep for three days,'' Suu Kyi wrote. ``It appeared the
interrogators wished to force him to admit that he was my adviser,
in other words, my puppet master.
<p>
   ``A man of courage and integrity, Win Tin would not be
intimidated into making false confessions.''
<p>
   Suu Kyi said Win Tin sent her a message of ``strong, unequivocal
support'' through U.S. congressman Bill Richardson, who visited him
in prison in 1994 and afterward met Suu Kyi while she was under her
six years of house arrest.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch Asia said Win Tin was transferred from Insein
Prison in Rangoon to Myingyan, about 540 kilometers (335 miles)
northwest of the capital.
<p>
   His family was unable to travel there to give him the medication
he needed, the rights group said.
<p>
   Myingyan is regarded as one of Burma's most brutal prisons.
<p>
   Tin Win Aung, a Burmese exile recently released from Myingyan,
said prisoners who complained of illness were beaten, and
hospitalization was permitted only for those about to die.

BC-Germany-Kidnapping
Spectacular kidnapping case in Germany ends with discovery of body
By PAUL GEITNER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BERLIN (AP)  &MD;  A desperate search for a young man kidnapped
almost four weeks ago ended Thursday when police said they had
found his decomposed body in the woods north of Berlin.
<p>
   The body of 20-year-old Matthias Hintze was found Wednesday
night, a day after two Russians were arrested. They were charged
Wednesday with suspicion of kidnapping after hours of
interrogation.
<p>
   Newspaper reports Thursday said at least one had confessed to
police where the body was hidden.
<p>
   The case made headlines across Germany since Hintze disappeared
on Sept. 14 from his family's home in Geltow, just outside Potsdam.
Police presumed he walked in during a burglary and was taken
hostage, stuffed into the trunk of the family's Mercedes.
<p>
   He was last seen alive a few hours later a short distance from
the house. A witness said he saw a BMW rear-end a Mercedes so that
the trunk popped up. A man in the trunk cried for help and tried to
escape, but the drivers of both cars got out, forced him back down
and slammed the trunk. Both cars were later found abandoned.
<p>
   The kidnappers demanded 1 million marks (dlrs 570,000) from the
parents, restaurant owners who police say are not rich.
<p>
   The parents appealed in newspapers and on national television
for the kidnappers to spare the life of their son, who had just
completed his military service.
<p>
   On Sept. 26 police released a photo of Hintze with a large black
eye staring out from an underground shaft. A letter from the
kidnappers said he was hungry and feverish and demanded the money
again.
<p>
   At least four attempts to deliver the money failed; police said
the parents had difficulty understanding the instructions given by
the kidnappers, who spoke broken German with a Russian accent.
<p>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of police searched throughout Berlin and the
surrounding state of Brandenburg.
<p>
   Two Russian men, ages 26 and 37, in a gold BMW with Russian
plates were stopped for questioning by a plain-clothes police
officer. Police said they behaved suspiciously and initially gave
false names.
<p>
   The two had police records in Germany, one for robbery and the
other for dealing in stolen autos.
<p>
   Hintze's body was found near Waren, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) north of Berlin. Police said he had been dead for at least
several days.

Stock trading resumes after communications trouble

<p>
   BOMBAY, India (AP)  &MD;  Trading on India's National Stock Exchange
resumed Thursday after a four-day interruption due to a failing
communications satellite.
<p>
   The Bombay exchange shifted its operations to the Insat 2A
satellite, and opened trading at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Trading was
suspended for a few hours for adjustments to Insat 2A in the early
afternoon, but that interruption had been expected.
<p>
   The stock exchange, India's state-run television and the
government's Department of Telecommunication had all been affected
by problems with another satellite, the Insat 2D. That satellite
was abandoned Sunday after a break in the power supply caused it to
lose its directional lock on the earth.
<p>
   The stock exchange, where roughly 40 percent of India's
transactions are conducted, closed trading early Friday after the
satellite trouble first surfaced.
<p>
   The government says the next Indian communications satellite
will be ready for launch next June.

Amnesty report criticizes human rights abuses in Lebanon
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Amnesty International on Thursday accused
the government of carrying out arbitrary political arrests, torture
and abuse of suspects in post-civil war Lebanon.
<p>
   Despite the violations, the situation represents a ``significant
improvement'' in people's basic rights over the 1975-90 civil war
years, the London-based international human rights organization
said.
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from the government on the
38-page report, which was released by Amnesty officials in Beirut.
<p>
   ``The end of the war has signaled an end to mass human rights
abuses such as deliberate and indiscriminate killings, abductions
and `disappearances,' with the state once more in a position to
uphold the rule of law,'' Amnesty said.
<p>
   However, the group said it was concerned that individuals' basic
rights are often ``curbed in the name of `security' and the need
for enforcing the state's authority.''
<p>
   ``Since the end of the civil war, Lebanon has witnessed mass
arbitrary political arrests and detention, torture and
ill-treatment, violations of the right to fair trial, (and) an
expansion of the number of offenses carrying the death penalty,''
the report said.
<p>
   The emphasis on security and order by the government ``may well
open the door to future human rights violations,'' Amnesty said,
adding that real security and stability can only be maintained if
each individual's human rights are protected.
<p>
   It was the first extensive report on internal Lebanese human
rights conditions since the end of the civil war. Amnesty has
issued separate documents in the last few years on human rights
conditions in southern Lebanon, where Israeli occupation forces are
fighting Lebanese guerrillas.
<p>
   In its latest report, Amnesty said hundreds of people have been
arrested but most were released later. It said three people died in
prison since 1994 as a result of alleged beatings.
<p>
   Amnesty urged the government to take steps to end torture and
ill-treatment of detainees. ``Torture may not be routine practice
but some groups are more likely to face torture because they are
usually more targeted by authorities,'' the report said.
<p>
   Amnesty also cited the arrests of suspects in Lebanon who ended
up in jails in neighboring Syria, saying such arrests are rarely
acknowledged by Lebanese or Syrian authorities although it appeared
to have taken place ``with the acquiescence of the Lebanese
government.''
<p>
   Amnesty said it was aware of at least 200 Lebanese nationals who
were detained in Syria, mostly without charge or trial. It added
that reports of arrests continue to be received since the end of
the civil war in 1990.
<p>
   Syria has up to 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon and exercises
effective control over the government.
<p>
   Security arrangements, part of a number of accords between
Beirut and Damascus, provide the legal ground for transfer of
suspects to Syrian custody.
<p>
   Amnesty also voiced its usual opposition to the death penalty
and demanded that Lebanese authorities issue a moratorium on
executions, commute the sentences of those on death row and
consider abolishing the death penalty.
<p>
   Lebanon restored capital punishment in 1994 to stem a rise in
crime in the postwar period. Ten people have since been executed by
hanging or by firing squad for security and drug-related crimes.
<p>
   The report also criticized a 1991 Amnesty Law covering political
crimes committed during the civil war. It called for a commission
of inquiry to investigate the cases of 17,415 people, mostly
Lebanese, who disappeared during the conflict. It said the
government should consider compensation for their families.
<p>
   ``A new future of true and lasting peace and human rights
protection in Lebanon is only possible if the country comes to
terms with its past,'' the report said.

   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as
investors grew pessimistic about chances for new government
measures to boost the economy. The dollar plunged against the yen
after U.S. stock prices fell.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 242.26 points,
or 1.37 percent, closing at 17,376.92. On Wednesday, the index had
gained 107.99 points, or 0.62 percent.
<p>
   An overnight decline on Wall Street also drove Japanese share
prices lower in early trading.
<p>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled U.S. stock and
bond markets with a warning that tight labor conditions could soon
prove inflationary.
<p>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to decline because
of growing fears about the health of the nation's economy. Traders
said many market players now believe that the government is
unlikely to adopt a special tax cut or supplementary budget to give
it a boost.
<p>
   ``The market is certainly heading downward, and it is seen as a
matter of time before the Nikkei falls below the year's lowest
level'' of 17,303.65, set on Jan. 10, said Hideaki Nakagawa,
general manager of the stock division at Meiko Securities Co.
<p>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 17.72 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,360.24. It
had climbed 3.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,377.96 Wednesday.
<p>
   Trading on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, up from 301 million Wednesday. Declines outnumbers advances
783 to 318, with 155 issues unchanged.
<p>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was changing hands at 121.18
yen in late afternoon, down 1.18 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo
but above its late New York level of 121.05 yen. It ranged between
121.08 yen and 121.35 yen in Thursday's trading.
<p>
   In New York overnight, sharp declines in stocks and bonds led
investors to sell the dollar against the yen.
<p>
   The dollar rebounded slightly early in Tokyo as currency traders
shifted their focus to the German mark and yen, traders said. The
mark rose against the yen on speculation that the German central
bank would soon raise interest rates.
<p>
   Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive to
international investors.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.785 percent from 1.750 percent Wednesday, driving
its price down to 108.44 from 108.70 yen.

Enron plans to invest dlrs 5 billion in India
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. power giant Enron plans to make
India the hub of its power and gas operations in Asia by investing
more than dlrs 5 billion, news reports said Thursday.
<p>
   Enron hopes to complete the first phase of a plant near Bombay
ahead of schedule and also speed up establishing a larger second
unit to make the dlrs 1.2 billion project the largest private
sector power unit in India, the Pioneer newspaper reported.
<p>
   Enron has now set up a 100 percent subsidary, Enron India Ltd.,
to handle its power, gas supply and marketing projects.
<p>
   Enron's plans for expanding investment in India come despite
court troubles it has faced here. Work on the plant near Bombay was
stalled after Enron was accused of securing the contract through
bribes, charges of which the company was cleared in court.

Philippine currency trading halted as peso rallies strongly
Eds: UPDATES with trading halted for rest of the day
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  The Philippine peso rallied strongly
against the dollar Thursday, hitting a 4 percent volatility limit
that caused currency trading to be halted for the day.
<p>
   The stock market's main index, meanwhile, surged 3 percent and
finished back above the psychologically important 2,000-point mark.
<p>
   When currency trading was suspended at midafternoon, the peso
averaged 34.852 pesos per dollar, compared to its record low of
35.565 pesos on Wednesday.
<p>
   The peso, buoyed by central bank intervention and new rules to
wrest dollars from the market, reached the limit of a new
three-tier volatility band introduced early this week to reduce
wild exchange rate swings.
<p>
   Its last trades were at 34.129 pesos per dollar.
<p>
   Under the new system, each time a volatility limit is hit,
trading is suspended for a cooling-off period for all trades
outside that band. Trading is halted for the rest of the day if the
rate moves more than 4 percent.
<p>
   A new central bank guideline preventing banks with sufficient
dollar holdings from tapping its overnight lending facility
contributed to the surge in dollar sales, traders said.
<p>
   The central bank re-opened its overnight lending window
Wednesday after keeping it closed since Aug. 20 to reduce
liquidity. The central bank is offering an overnight lending rate
of 15 percent, lower than its previous rate of 18 percent and far
below the interbank loan rate, which averaged 68.5 percent
Wednesday.
<p>
   The central bank also was selling dollars Thursday to buoy the
Philippine currency, traders said.
<p>
   Stocks, meanwhile, closed sharply higher as declining interest
rates and the stronger peso propped up the market for a second day,
traders said.
<p>
   The central bank's decision to re-open its overnight lending
facility helped ease interest rates, the key factor that has drawn
money away from stocks to fixed income investments such as bonds,
traders said.
<p>
   The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged 58.67 points
to 2,005.50. On Wednesday the index had gained 26.2 points.
<p>
   Ricardo Puig, research head at Research One Overseas Inc., said
the market may continue its advance in coming days because of the
declining cost of borrowing.
<p>
   But he said the advance will probably be capped by concerns over
companies' future prospects.
<p>
   On Thursday, President Fidel Ramos said he expects the country
will weather the currency storm by the end of the year.
<p>
   Ramos said the effects of the weaker peso, which have disrupted
the country's economic growth, won't linger until next year since
the economy's fundamentals remain in place and are backed by sound
growth-oriented policies.
<p>
   ``Investor confidence will return. Unlike other Asian countries,
we are not suffering from policy weakness. We do not have weak
fundamentals,'' Ramos told reporters.

Foreign sailors complain about Dutch women marines disrobing
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DEN HELDER, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Women serving at a Dutch naval
base have been ordered to draw their curtains when they undress
after some foreign sailors complained they were seeing too much
skin.
<p>
   The Royal Dutch Navy commander in the seaside city of Den Helder
circulated written orders explaining that men from Muslim countries
and elsewhere on assignment at the Willemsoord base were distracted
and offended by the sight of the disrobing Dutch marines.
<p>
   About 170 female officers and sailors live in a women-only
barracks. Many have not bothered to draw their curtains when they
change their clothes, and are clearly visible from other buildings,
the daily De Telegraaf reported Thursday.
<p>
   The women ``are not always aware of how possible it is to peek
in from other parts of the base,'' the orders said, adding that the
naval command feared it could lead to an ``undesirable'' situation.
<p>
   Sailors from Greece, the United Arab Emirates and other foreign
countries frequently dock at the base for port calls and to ready
or repair their vessels. Some have complained, military officials
said.
<p>
   ``They have other cultural and religious standards,'' explains
the order to the Dutch women sailors.

   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as
investors grew pessimistic about chances for new government

after U.S. stock prices fell.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 242.26 points,

Report: 40 Kurdish rebels killed in northern Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  An Iraqi Kurdish group allied with Turkish
soldiers claimed Thursday it has killed 40 Turkish Kurdish rebels
in recent clashes.
<p>
   The radio of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, monitored
by Turkey's Anatolia news agency, said the rebels were killed in
clashes near in areas along the border with Turkey. The radio gave
no KDP casualty figures.
<p>
   Some 16,000 Turkish troops are involved in a military operation
against the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The
incursion is aimed at wiping out rebel bases used to stage
hit-and-run attacks inside Turkey.
<p>
   The military claimed to have killed 538 guerrillas since the
start of the offensive on Sept. 21. Only six soldiers were reported
killed, but the rebels put Turkish casualties at over 40.
<p>
   Such incursions have become frequent in the last two years.
<p>
   Turkey has been pressuring rival Iraqi Kurdish groups, vying for
control in northern Iraq, to prevent the PKK from operating in the
area, which has been out of Iraqi government control since the Gulf
War. It is under the protection of U.S.-led allied jets.

BC-Israel-Spy Debate
Mossad panel member will resign, speculation Mossad boss to quit
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's blue-ribbon
panel probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start with a former Mossad chief asking to quit, an
Israeli official said Thursday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad chief, would be forced to resign from his job because of the
spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in Amman on
Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, will ask to resign from the
three-member committee investigating the Amman operation because he
publicly expressed support for it before being appointed, a senior
official said on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni had initially been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Mossad director Yatom to give the
interviews supporting the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the
Hamas political bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.
<p>
   Admoni is expected to be replaced by another former Mossad
chief, either Yitzhak Hofi or Shabtai Shavit, Israel Radio said.
<p>
   The other two members on the Netanyahu-appointed panel are
senior civil servants dependent on the government for their jobs -
Rafi Peled, a former police chief and the director of the
state-owned Israel Electric Corp., and Joseph Ciechanover, the
chairman of the national carrier El Al.
<p>
   Israeli opposition politicians complained that the
``clarification committee'' was appointed by Netanyahu to be a
political fig leaf and not intended to find the truth. They
demanded an independent state commission be appointed.
<p>
   The government attempted to shore up the credibility of the
committee on Wednesday by giving it subpoena powers.
<p>
   In another development, newspapers suggested that Yatom and the
Mossad were responsible for holding up a letter in which King
Hussein of Jordan informed Israel two days before the attack on
Mashaal that Hamas was ready for a conditional cease-fire.
<p>
   Netanyahu has said the message only reached him several hours
after the attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Netanyahu reportedly has ordered an investigation of why the
letter did not reach his desk in time, fueling speculation that
Yatom would eventually be asked to resign.
<p>
   Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak said Wednesday that Netanyahu had
great respect for Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom was scheduled to meet Netanyahu later Thursday.
<p>
   The Haaretz daily reported that the head of the Shin Bet secret
service, Ami Ayalon, and military intelligence chief, Moshe Yaalon,
had not been informed of the assassination plans and were upset
with Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom contends he gave the other intelligence chiefs a written
document about the assassination plans, Haaretz said.
<p>
   But the paper quoted an unnamed senior officer as saying the
only relevant passage reports in general terms about intentions to
carry out operations and made no mention of Jordan or of a specific
target.

Castro lauds Cuba's resistance to U.S. in 7-hour speech to party
Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Castro speech.

<TEXT>
<p>
   HAVANA (AP)  &MD;  Harkening back to the early days of the Cuban
revolution, Fidel Castro lashed out at the United States and vowed
to continue Cuba's socialist path in a 7-hour speech opening a
Communist Party congress.
<p>
   The 71-year-old Castro, who had made few recent appearances,
appeared hollow of face, but his endurance at the podium Wednesday
seemed to combat rumors he was ill and easily fatigued.
<p>
   For hours, Castro outlined the crisis Cuba has faced since the
1991 Soviet Union collapse eliminated its main source of aid and
trade.
<p>
   ``The historic enemy,'' the United States, ``which never
renounced beating back our independence, became more powerful than
ever,'' even as Cuba's economy plunged, he said.
<p>
   ``The world waited for news that the revolution had
disappeared.''
<p>
   But Cuba had resisted those pressures, he said, reasserting his
socialist faith.
<p>
   ``We are open to all possibilities except renouncing socialism,
except renouncing the conquests of the revolution, except
renouncing the unity of the people,'' the Cuban president said.
<p>
   ``Capitalism as a system belongs to pre-history,'' Castro said,
claiming it denies ``true human rights'' such as equality and
universal education.
<p>
   ``The recipe they (capitalist countries) have for the world is
unsustainable.''
<p>
   The speech opened the Fifth Communist Party Congress, which is
to lay out general policy for Cuba until the year 2002.
<p>
   The congress also will replace some members of the 25-member
party Politburo, giving a hint about the future.
<p>
   Much of Castro's speech  &MD;  which rivaled in length the epic
speeches of his early days  &MD;  was dedicated to analysis of recent
problems and there was no sign of major policy changes.
<p>
   Castro repeatedly attacked the United States, saying the country
wanted to be ``owner of the world'' and was dedicated to dominating
Cuba.
<p>
   He said Cuban officials have documented 24 terrorist attempts
against tourist sites here since 1990 and ``all without exception
were organized and supplied from the United States.''
<p>
   He noted that men accused of killing a Cuban policeman in an
escape and another who hijacked an aircraft at gunpoint were
acquitted in U.S. courts.
<p>
   That ``greatly stimulates such acts,'' Castro said.
<p>
   He also complained that the United States had ignored Cuban
claims that the Cuban-American National Foundation in Miami was
behind recent hotel bombings. The foundation has denied any role
and U.S. officials say they have found no evidence of it.
<p>
   But Castro called ``constructive'' a recent U.S. denunciation of
the hotel bombings and the return of two men accused of forcibly
hijacking a boat in hopes of reaching the United States.
<p>
   There was no live television or radio coverage, but state media
began to report excerpts from his address late Wednesday night. The
event at Havana's Palace of Conventions is closed to foreign media.
<p>
   Cuba's Communists have weathered six years of economic crisis
since the last congress in 1991. The Berlin Wall had fallen and the
Soviet Union, its patron, would collapse within weeks.
<p>
   That meeting, which Castro called ``a congress in arms,'' helped
open the way for economic and political reforms, including the
direct election of parliament, a rapprochement with churches and
creation of small-scale private businesses.
<p>
   Such reforms have slowed as Cuba's economy has improved and the
current congress was expected to emphasize cleaning up problems in
state companies rather than advancing further into private
business.
<p>
   Castro called for fighting corruption and inequality seen here
as associated with private business and tourism.
<p>
   Neither was there sign of increased space for political dissent.
<p>
   A party document ridiculed multiparty systems as prone to
``fraud, corruption, debasement of politics'' and accused
Washington of financing dissidents in Cuba in order to bring the
country under U.S. domination.
<p>
   A recurring theme was the 30th anniversary of the death of
Castro's old revolutionary comrade, Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, killed
in Bolivia in 1967 along with several other Cubans in a failed
revolution there.
<p>
   ``We know that there are no eternal things. Marxism teaches us
that,'' Castro said. ``We can only say that your dear brothers will
be eternal as long as eternity exists.''

China protests Taiwanese official's visit to Iceland
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  In actions designed to further isolate Taiwan,
China said Thursday it was closing Liberia's consulate in Hong Kong
and has lodged a stern protest with Iceland for receiving a
Taiwanese leader's visit.
<p>
   The closing of Liberia's honorary consulate followed the African
nation's declaration last month that it recognizes the governments
of both China and Taiwan.
<p>
   China regards Taiwan, ruled separately by the Nationalists since
1949, as a rebel province with no right to diplomatic
representation of its own. Beijing insists that all its diplomatic
partners have no official ties with Taiwan.
<p>
   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said Liberia was
``creating two Chinas.'' The Liberian consulate in Hong Kong, the
former British colony China recovered on July 1, would be closed
down Thursday, he said.
<p>
   China had already broken off ties with Liberia on Sept. 9.
<p>
   On a related issue, Shen said Iceland had ignored China's
protests in allowing Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan to visit and
organizing official activities for him.
<p>
   ``This is unacceptable to the Chinese people and government,''
said Shen, speaking at a twice-weekly briefing for reporters.
<p>
   ``These activities will seriously harm bilateral relations
between China and Iceland. Of course, the damage ... will include
all fields,'' he said.
<p>
   Shen did not give details. But Taiwanese media reports said
China canceled talks on imports of Icelandic fish worth several
million U.S. dollars.
<p>
   The reports said China issued two stern protests to Iceland, one
before Lien even arrived.
<p>
   Shen said the visit ``interfered in China's internal affairs,
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and damaged China-Iceland
relations.''
<p>
   ``Iceland's government ignored our serious representations,'' he
said. ``The Icelandic side must take full responsibility for all
the consequences that arise from this.''
<p>
   Iceland and Taiwan expect the visit will lead to an exchange of
trade and tourist promotion offices. Iceland is the only Western
European country where Taiwan doesn't operate a de facto embassy.
<p>
   Lien, who met Iceland Prime Minister David Oddson for two hours
Wednesday night, was due to leave Friday for Austria. He will spend
two days there, part of the time in Innsbruck, before going on to
Spain.
<p>
   China accuses Taiwanese leaders of using overseas visits to
promote the island as an independent country.
<p>
   Shen, the Chinese spokesman, warned Tuesday of ``extremely
serious consequences'' for any country that allows Lien to visit.

Apartheid spy points finger at bosses

<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  One of apartheid South Africa's
most notorious spies pointed the finger of blame Thursday at the
bosses who funded his operations and coached him in anti-communist
propaganda.
<p>
   Maj. Craig Williamson, a police spy for the white government
during the 1970s and 1980s, has admitted carrying out bombings on
anti-apartheid activists. He told the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission politicians and top police officials had always sought
to distance themselves from covert actions.
<p>
   ``The abdicated their responsibility to exercise close
operational supervision of such actions ... nevertheless, they can
never deny responsibility for the budgets used to fund covert
actions,'' Williamson said in a written statement.
<p>
   He said definite approval for killing members of the black
liberation struggle was not stated, but he said the tacit
acceptance of such actions by his superiors was clear.
<p>
   ``I had no doubt that secret violent and other actions against
the revolutionary enemy were an accepted and approved procedure,''
he wrote.
<p>
   Former police commissioner, Gen. Johan van der Merve, said some
top politicians in the State Security Council, the apartheid
state's top security body, knew the police were involved in illegal
operations.
<p>
   ``Members of the State Security Council, not necessarily all of
them, did know that certain unauthorized actions were approved,''
he said.
<p>
   Williamson has been accused by former police death squad
commander Eugene de Kock of being involved in the 1986 murder of
Swedish prime minister Olof Palme.
<p>
   In a frank statement Williamson, who denies any link to the
Palme killing, made no mention of specific actions, but said the
over-riding concern among police officers was simply not to get
caught doing anything illegal.
<p>
   ``The eleventh commandment was well known ... this was `Thou
shalt not be found out','' he said.
<p>
   The commission was set up to look into apartheid-era human
rights abuses a year after the country's first all race elections
in 1994 when the African National Congress swept to power and put
the final nail in the apartheid state's coffin.
<p>
   The day's hearing on the police is part of a special
investigation into the security forces of the previous government
as well as the armed wings of the various liberation movements.
<p>
   Williamson said the police had fought so hard and dirty against
the ANC and its allies because they believed they were saving the
state from communism during the Cold War.
<p>
   ``We learnt and taught that communism was a religion and faith
which was messianic,'' he said.
<p>
   The fact that many of southern Africa's liberation movements
were Soviet-backed and the ANC was allied with the South African
Communist Party made it easier to commit violence against them
because they were seen as ``foreign,'' he added.
<p>
   Williamson said that the paranoia of top police and military
officials reached such a pitch in the 1980s that some of them
discussed launching a coup, even wanting to put things like state
television under military control.
<p>
   ``Their solution was to suspend democratic freedoms and to
militarize the South African society,'' he said.

Foreign sailors complain about Dutch women marines disrobing
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DEN HELDER, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Women serving at a Dutch naval
base have been ordered to draw their curtains when they undress
after some foreign sailors complained they were seeing too much
skin.
<p>
   The Royal Dutch Navy commander in the seaside city of Den Helder
circulated written orders explaining that men from Muslim countries
and elsewhere on assignment at the Willemsoord base were distracted
and offended by the sight of the disrobing Dutch marines.
<p>
   About 170 female officers and sailors live in a women-only
barracks. Many have not bothered to draw their curtains when they
change their clothes, and are clearly visible from other buildings,
the daily De Telegraaf reported Thursday.
<p>
   The women ``are not always aware of how possible it is to peek
in from other parts of the base,'' the orders said, adding that the
naval command feared it could lead to an ``undesirable'' situation.
<p>
   Sailors from Greece, the United Arab Emirates and other foreign
countries frequently dock at the base for port calls and to ready
or repair their vessels. Some have complained, military officials
said.
<p>
   ``They have other cultural and religious standards,'' explains
the order to the Dutch women sailors.

   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Two Japanese regional banks announced Thursday that
they plan to merge in a bid to survive increased competition
expected after an upcoming government deregulation of the financial
sector.
<p>
   Fukutoku Bank and Naniwa Bank, will officially merge on Oct. 1,
1998, at a ratio of one Fukutoku share for one Naniwa share. Other
details are yet to be decided, the banks said in a statement.
<p>
   Like many banks, both Fukutoku and Naniwa have been burdened
with non-performing loans after the collapse of Japan's
asset-inflated ``bubble economy'' of the late 1980s.
<p>
   The banks said it was important they strengthen their operations
and deal with their bad debts as quickly as possible with the
government looking to implement its ``big bang'' financial
deregulation by 2001 and as the number of troubled financial
institutions grows.
<p>
   The new operation will have 430 fewer employees from a combined
2,430 people currently working at both banks  &MD;  which will result in
a projected savings of 4 billion yen (dlrs 33 million), the banks
said.
<p>
   At the end of September, Fukutoku Bank had deposits totaling
1.27 trillion yen (dlrs 10.5 billion) with outstanding loans at
1.21 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion). Naniwa Bank had 353 billion
yen (dlrs 3 billion) of deposits and 331 billion yen (dlrs 2.7
billion) of loans.

   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  Currency turmoil afflicting the rest of
Southeast Asia is not expected to hit Brunei and the small
sultanate remains on track to achieve growth forecast for this year
and next, a bank said.
<p>
   The Standard Chartered Bank's fourth quarter outlook report said
the turmoil will have little impact because Brunei is a net capital
exporter.
<p>
   Growth of 3.0 percent had been projected this year for Brunei
and 4.0 percent in 1998, the bank said.
<p>
   ``Brunei's gross domestic product growth will stay on a
relatively even keel compared to last year's,'' the report said.
The Brunei economy registered gross domestic product growth of 3.3
percent in 1996.
<p>
   However, there are implications for the Brunei dollar, which is
linked to the Singapore dollar, the bank said.
<p>
   Because the Brunei dollar has maintained its relative strength
when compared with other regional currencies, ``in terms of export
competitiveness, this makes it harder for viable economic
activities to take root in Brunei,'' said the report.

   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A fugitive Swiss banker who allegedly
caused massive losses at Bank Rothschild AG Zurich will be charged
Friday with illegal entry into Thailand.
<p>
   Thai Immigration Police Lt. Amornchai Panya said that Juerg Heer
was likely to be immediately fined 6,000 baht (dlrs 166) and then
undergo a quick extradition hearing.
<p>
   The speed with which he is sent home will depend on completion
of the formal paperwork by the Swiss, Amornchai said.
<p>
   Heer, 61, a former credit manager of the bank, is accused of
siphoning off 65 million Swiss francs (dlrs 44 million at current
rates) from 1986 to 1992.
<p>
   The bank dismissed him in 1992 for suspected irregularities and
he was arrested. But after two months in jail, authorities released
him provisionally and allowed him to travel to Thailand on
vacation. He never returned.

   BOMBAY, India (AP)  &MD;  Trading on India's National Stock Exchange
resumed Thursday after a four-day interruption because of a failing
communications satellite.
<p>
   The Bombay exchange shifted its operations to the Insat 2A
satellite, and opened trading at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. Trading was
suspended for a few hours for adjustments to Insat 2A in the early
afternoon, but that interruption had been expected.
<p>
   The stock exchange, India's state-run television and the
government's Department of Telecommunication had all been affected
by problems with another satellite, the Insat 2D. that satellite
was abandoned Sunday after a break in power supply caused it to
lose its directional lock on the earth.
<p>
   The stock exchange, where roughly 40 percent of India's
transactions are conducted, closed trading early Friday after the
satellite trouble first surfaced.
<p>
   India says its next Indian communications satellite will be
ready for launch next June.

   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. power giant Enron plans to make
India the hub of its power and gas operations in Asia by investing
more than dlrs 5 billion, news reports said Thursday.
<p>
   Enron hopes to complete at the first phase of a plant near
Bombay ahead of schedule and also speed up establishing a larger
second unit to make the dlrs 1.2 billion project the largest
private sector power unit in India, the Pioneer newspaper reported.
<p>
   Enron has now set up a 100 percent subsidary, Enron India Ltd.,
to handle its power, gas supply and marketing projects.
<p>
   Enron's plans for expanding investment in India come despite
court troubles it has faced here. Work on the plant near Bombay was
stalled after Enron was accused of securing the contract through
bribes, charges of which the company was cleared in court.
 &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. energy company Enron Corp.
will join a U.S. dlrs 500 million coal slurry pipeline project in
China, an Australian company involved in the plan said Thursday.
<p>
   MRI Holdings, a small Australian company that has a stake in
China Pipeline Holdings, said in a statement it and other
shareholders of China Pipeline Holdings signed a shareholders'
agreement with Enron International China CP, a unit of the U.S.
energy and pipeline company.
<p>
   ``Under the agreement, Enron will receive new shares issued by
China Pipeline Holdings enabling it to own 61.5 percent of the
expanded equity interest of China Pipeline Holdings,'' MRI said.
MRI's stake will be diluted to 15.5 percent.
<p>
   Enron will contribute expertise and experience in project
financing, pipeline construction and operation.
<p>
   Enron's ``solid reputation in the financial community'' should
assure success in capital raising for the US dlrs 500 million
project, the Australian company added. It said 70 percent of the
project will be financed with debt and 30 percent through equity
funds.
<p>
   The restructuring of China Pipeline Holdings ``has the support
of the relevant authorities of the Chinese government,'' MRI said.

Key ally of Suu Kyi, imprisoned for eight years, said near death
Eds: UPDATES with new info from inside Burma saying Win Tin's
condition is serious but improving, first 7 grafs
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A close ally of Burmese democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, imprisoned by the military government for
the past eight years, has been sent to Rangoon General Hospital
with serious heart problems, democrats and human rights groups said
Thursday.
<p>
   Win Tin, a member of the central executive committee of Suu
Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, was
transferred to the hospital from Myingyan Prison near Mandalay
sometime last week, Human Rights Watch Asia said in a news release
received in Bangkok.
<p>
   Members of Suu Kyi's party in Rangoon confirmed that Win Tin has
been admitted to the hospital and is in the cardiac ward. They said
he has been responding to medication and his condition was
beginning to improve.
<p>
   Although the rights groups said Win Tin had been released from
prison, an aide at Suu Kyi's home said his prison sentence had not
been commuted.
<p>
   ``It's not true. His condition is also not as hopeless as some
have said,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Suu Kyi's cousin, Aye Win, who has been languishing in Insein
Prison in Rangoon since May 1996 without being tried for any crime,
is also in the cardiac ward, NLD members said.
<p>
   Party members said the military government would be asked to
allow Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders to visit Win Tin. The military
government has not yet responded to queries about him.
<p>
   The former newspaper editor, reportedly viewed by the military
as a troublesome adviser to Suu Kyi, suffers from a heart condition
that requires constant medication. He also developed spinal
problems while in prison.
<p>
   The Burmese military has denied the Red Cross access to
political prisoners. Human rights groups have documented systematic
abuses in the Burmese prison system, considered one of the worst in
the world.
<p>
   Rights groups reported last year that Win Tin had been beaten
and was being kept in a tiny cell meant to house military dogs.
<p>
   He was arrested in June 1989 for allegedly having phone
conversations with the father of a fugitive and sentenced to three
years imprisonment in October of that year, Suu Kyi wrote in a
newspaper column in 1996.
<p>
   In June 1992, he was given an additional 11 years in prison in
what Suu Kyi called ``another farcical trial.'' He was also given
five more years in 1995 for writing a letter to the United Nations.
<p>
   Unlike Suu Kyi and most other NLD members arrested in 1989-90,
Win Tin was never released. Burmese democracy activists in Bangkok
said the military fears Win Tin for his strong intellect, believing
he advised Suu Kyi on political strategy and tactics.
<p>
   ``Immediately after his arrest, U Win Tin was kept without food
and sleep for three days,'' Suu Kyi wrote. ``It appeared the
interrogators wished to force him to admit that he was my adviser,
in other words, my puppet master.
<p>
   ``A man of courage and integrity, Win Tin would not be
intimidated into making false confessions.''
<p>
   Suu Kyi said Win Tin sent her a message of ``strong, unequivocal
support'' through U.S. congressman Bill Richardson, who visited him
in prison in 1994 and afterward met Suu Kyi while she was under her
six years of house arrest.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch Asia said Win Tin was transferred from Insein
Prison in Rangoon to Myingyan, about 540 kilometers (335 miles)
northwest of the capital.
<p>
   His family was unable to travel there to give him the medication
he needed, the rights group said.
<p>
   Myingyan is regarded as one of Burma's most brutal prisons.
<p>
   Tin Win Aung, a Burmese exile recently released from Myingyan,
said prisoners who complained of illness were beaten, and
hospitalization was permitted only for those about to die.

BC-Israel-Spy Debate,0578
Mossad panel member will resign, speculation Mossad boss to quit
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
panel probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start with a former Mossad chief asking to quit, an
Israeli official said Thursday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad chief, would be forced to resign from his job because of the
spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in Amman on
Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, will ask to resign from the
three-member committee investigating the Amman operation because he
publicly expressed support for it before being appointed, a senior
official said on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni had initially been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Mossad director Yatom to give the
interviews supporting the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the
Hamas political bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.
<p>
   Admoni is expected to be replaced by another former Mossad
chief, either Yitzhak Hofi or Shabtai Shavit, Israel Radio said.
<p>
   The other two members on the Netanyahu-appointed panel are
senior civil servants dependent on the government for their jobs  &MD; 
Rafi Peled, a former police chief and the director of the
state-owned Israel Electric Corp., and Joseph Ciechanover, the
chairman of the national carrier El Al.
<p>
   Israeli opposition politicians complained that the
``clarification committee'' was appointed by Netanyahu to be a
political fig leaf and not intended to find the truth. They
demanded an independent state commission be appointed.
<p>
   The government attempted to shore up the credibility of the
committee on Wednesday by giving it subpoena powers.
<p>
   In another development, newspapers suggested that Yatom and the
Mossad were responsible for holding up a letter in which King
Hussein of Jordan informed Israel two days before the attack on
Mashaal that Hamas was ready for a conditional cease-fire.
<p>
   Netanyahu has said the message only reached him several hours
after the attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Netanyahu reportedly has ordered an investigation of why the
letter did not reach his desk in time, fueling speculation that
Yatom would eventually be asked to resign.
<p>
   Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak said Wednesday that Netanyahu had
great respect for Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom was scheduled to meet Netanyahu later Thursday.
<p>
   The Haaretz daily reported that the head of the Shin Bet secret
service, Ami Ayalon, and military intelligence chief, Moshe Yaalon,
had not been informed of the assassination plans and were upset
with Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom contends he gave the other intelligence chiefs a written
document about the assassination plans, Haaretz said.
<p>
   But the paper quoted an unnamed senior officer as saying the
only relevant passage reports in general terms about intentions to
carry out operations and made no mention of Jordan or of a specific
target.

China asks U.S. to make president's visit a success
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  China urged the United States Thursday to ensure
that President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit goes smoothly, after
protesters said they plan to demonstrate during his stay.
<p>
   ``The U.S. government should handle situations that may occur on
U.S. soil during President Jiang's visit,'' Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said.
<p>
   ``The Chinese side will not interfere in any way. But we hope
that the U.S. side will take a few steps to ensure that President
Jiang Zemin's state visit goes smoothly,'' he added.
<p>
   Shen, speaking a briefing for reporters, was responding to a
question about protesters' plans to demonstrate during Jiang's
state visit, the first by a Chinese president since 1985.
<p>
   Shen said the visit ``was very important'' and would set
guidelines for China-U.S. relations into the 21st century.
<p>
   A coalition of human rights groups plans to stage a robust
demonstration across from the White House on Oct. 29, the day of
Jiang's summit with President Clinton.

Turkish workers get food poisoning, 136 hospitalized
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Some 170 Turkish construction workers contracted
food poisoning after eating catered food, and most were
hospitalized, according to a news report Thursday.
<p>
   The workers, employed by the Russian-Turkish firm Eko, were at
various building sites Tuesday when they received their meals,
cooked at a central catering establishment, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
<p>
   Out of 700 Turkish workers who received the meals, 170 came down
with food poisoning and 136 were hospitalized, said Yuri Nachkin, a
duty officer at the Moscow Department for Civil Defense and
Emergency Situations.
<p>
   Those hospitalized were improving and none was in serious
danger, officials said.

Islamic militant leader killed by Libyan army
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  A leader of an Islamic militant group
opposed to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed with three
comrades in clashes with the Libyan army, a major Arab daily
reported Thursday.
<p>
   The London-based Al-Hayat quoted a statement from the Fighting
Islamic Group saying that Salah Fathy bin Salman died on Sept. 23
in the mountainous area of al-Jabal al-Akhdar near the coastal town
of Darnah 880 kilometers (540 miles) east of Tripoli.
<p>
   The statement said the Libyan army has carried out combing
operations for more than a month in the area where opponents of his
regime have holed up.
<p>
   Bin Salman, also known as Abu Abder-Rahman Hattab, was a founder
of the Fighting Islamic Group. It claimed responsibility for an
assassination attempt on Gadhafi last year, saying one of its
members hurled a grenade at him in the desert town of Brak. The
Libyan leader escaped injury.
<p>
   Gadhafi seized power in a 1969 coup and since then has
maintained control by keeping a firm grip on the army, the
intelligence services and police. He has also deftly manipulated
Libya's system of tribal politics.
<p>
   In the past two years, there have been repeated reports of
suicide attempts on Gadhafi and attacks by Islamic militants and
other opponents of his rule.

   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Police have busted an international
drug smuggling ring, seizing 20 millon guilders (dlrs 10 million)
of cocaine bound from South America to the Netherlands, England and
Belgium.
<p>
   Dutch television reported Thursday that 10 people were arrested
and 250 kilos of the drug were seized in raids on 19 separate
locations in and around Amsterdam and the eastern Dutch city of
Arnhem.
<p>
   Authorities said the cocaine was shipped to the Netherlands by
plane and boat for distribution elsewhere in Europe. The operation
targeted traffickers who have been using Arnhem as an international
center for smuggling and selling hard drugs.
<p>
   The raids capped a two-year investigation aided by military
police.

Apartheid spy points finger at bosses

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  One of apartheid South Africa's
most notorious spies pointed the finger of blame Thursday at the
bosses who funded his operations and coached him in anti-communist
propaganda.
<p>
   Maj. Craig Williamson, a police spy for the white government
during the 1970s and 1980s, has admitted carrying out bombings on
anti-apartheid activists. He told the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission politicians and top police officials had always sought
to distance themselves from covert actions.
<p>
   ``They abdicated their responsibility to exercise close
operational supervision of such actions ... nevertheless, they can
never deny responsibility for the budgets used to fund covert
actions,'' Williamson said in a written statement.
<p>
   He said definite approval for killing members of the black
liberation struggle was not stated, but he said the tacit
acceptance of such actions by his superiors was clear.
<p>
   ``I had no doubt that secret violent and other actions against
the revolutionary enemy were an accepted and approved procedure,''
he wrote.
<p>
   Former police commissioner, Gen. Johan van der Merve, said some
top politicians in the State Security Council, the apartheid
state's top security body, knew the police were involved in illegal
operations.
<p>
   ``Members of the State Security Council, not necessarily all of
them, did know that certain unauthorized actions were approved,''
he said.
<p>
   Williamson has been accused by former police death squad
commander Eugene de Kock of being involved in the 1986 murder of
Swedish prime minister Olof Palme.
<p>
   In a frank statement Williamson, who denies any link to the
Palme killing, made no mention of specific actions, but said the
over-riding concern among police officers was simply not to get
caught doing anything illegal.
<p>
   ``The eleventh commandment was well known ... this was `Thou
shalt not be found out','' he said.
<p>
   The commission was set up to look into apartheid-era human
rights abuses a year after the country's first all race elections
in 1994 when the African National Congress swept to power and put
the final nail in the apartheid state's coffin.
<p>
   The day's hearing on the police is part of a special
investigation into the security forces of the previous government
as well as the armed wings of the various liberation movements.
<p>
   Williamson said the police had fought so hard and dirty against
the ANC and its allies because they believed they were saving the
state from communism during the Cold War.
<p>
   ``We learnt and taught that communism was a religion and faith
which was messianic,'' he said.
<p>
   The fact that many of southern Africa's liberation movements
were Soviet-backed and the ANC was allied with the South African
Communist Party made it easier to commit violence against them
because they were seen as ``foreign,'' he added.
<p>
   Williamson said that the paranoia of top police and military
officials reached such a pitch in the 1980s that some of them
discussed launching a coup, even wanting to put things like state
television under military control.
<p>
   ``Their solution was to suspend democratic freedoms and to
militarize the South African society,'' he said.

Taiwan nuclear plant reveals leak, says damage contained
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  A nuclear power plant in southern Taiwan
leaked radioactive waste but a speedy cleanup prevented
contamination of the surrounding area, the state-owned Taiwan Power
Co. said Thursday.
<p>
   Local governments and farming associations said they wanted
further checks to ensure the area was safe.
<p>
   Stored liquid waste leaked through a protective membrane last
Saturday at the third nuclear power plant in Hengchun, 300
kilometers (185 miles) south of Taipei, a Taipower statement said.
<p>
   A routine inspection detected radiation on the roof of the plant
and in drainage ditches on Monday, the company said, and a new
membrane and other equipment were installed.
<p>
   More than 400 liters (100 gallons) of water and 400 kilograms
(900 pounds) of contaminated sand were removed, plant head Chen
Pu-chan told the newspaper China Times Express.
<p>
   Defective evaporation equipment caused a tear in the protective
membrane, allowing a ``tiny amount'' of liquid waste to escape up a
ventilation pipe and into drainage ditches on plant grounds,
Taipower said.
<p>
   More than 6,000 barrels of radioactive waste are stored at the
plant, near a popular bathing area on the west coast.
<p>
   Taiwan's three nuclear power plants produce about one-third of
the island's electrical output.
<p>
   A fourth plant on the northeastern coast near Taipei is being
built despite objections from residents, environmentalists and
opposition political parties.

   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  An Iraqi Kurdish group allied with Turkish
soldiers claimed Thursday it has killed 40 Turkish Kurdish rebels
in recent clashes.
<p>
   The radio of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, monitored
by Turkey's Anatolia news agency, said the rebels were killed in
clashes near in areas along the border with Turkey. The radio gave
no KDP casualty figures.
<p>
   Some 16,000 Turkish troops are involved in a military operation
against the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The
incursion is aimed at wiping out rebel bases used to stage
hit-and-run attacks inside Turkey.
<p>
   Turkish jets and helicopters hit rebel positions Thursday in
areas between the Zap valley and Link mountain in northern Iraq,
near the border with Turkey, the Anatolia news agency said.
<p>
   Commando units immediately began to comb the area after the air
raid, Anatolia said.

Mir crew opens hatch to cargo ship, begins unloading
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  The Mir's crew opened the hatch of a newly arrived
cargo ship Thursday and began unloading perishable groceries and
equipment for biological experiments that need to be stored in the
space station's refrigerator.
<p>
   Russia's Progress M-36 cargo ship successfully docked with Mir
on Wednesday night, but space officials decided to keep its hatches
closed until the next morning.
<p>
   Flight control chief Vladimir Solovyov said that docking uses up
a lot of the station's energy and space officials decided to let
solar batteries recharge during the night before letting the crew
proceed with unloading the cargo ship.
<p>
   The Progress M-36 brought some 2 1/2 tons of supplies and
equipment, including a new back-up computer, fuel, drinking water,
and a new device designed to fly around the Mir and examine its
exterior.
<p>
   The first things the crew planned to unload were perishable
groceries and equipment for biological experiments, said Mission
Control spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova.
<p>
   The Inspector, a device designed by the European Space Agency to
fly around the space station, is the first of its kind. It will
eventually be used on the international space station that
scheduled to go into orbit next year.
<p>
   During its tests on Mir, the Inspector may be used to look for
holes punched in one of Mir's modules when a cargo ship slammed
into it during a practice docking in June.
<p>
   The crew is planning three spacewalks to repair the damage from
the collision. The first one  &MD;  into the damaged Spektr module  &MD;  is
planned for Oct. 20, and Russian officials hope to have all the
damage repaired by the end of the year, Solovyov said.
<p>
   The Progress M-36 came in on automatic pilot and docked ``very
cleanly'' with the Mir on Wednesday in the first successful use of
a new energy-saving procedure, Solovyov said.
<p>
   The U.S. space shuttle Atlantis, which left Mir last week,
delivered a new computer and other important equipment, including
sealant for holes in the Spektr module. It also brought up U.S.
astronaut David Wolf, who will spend four months on the Russian
station.

Kuwait urges Iran to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  Kuwait is urging Iran to refrain from acquiring
nuclear weapons and to base its relations with its Arab neighbors
on ``non-interference'' in their internal affairs.
<p>
   ``The problem here ... is the acquisition of mass destruction
weapons by Iran,'' Kuwait's information minister, Sheik Saud
al-Sabah, told reporters at a dinner Wednesday night.
<p>
   He was responding to a question about Iran's overtures to the
West under President Mohammad Khatami, the moderate cleric who won
a landslide victory in May elections.
<p>
   ``It is not the issue of overtures,'' said Sheik Saud. ``It is
the issue of refraining from acquisition of nuclear weapons in the
region and weapons of mass destruction.''
<p>
   The minister said any ``confrontation between Iran and the West,
especially the United States, will not serve our interest,'' and
would make ``our position very, very difficult.''
<p>
   The United States led an international coalition that fought the
1991 Gulf War and liberated Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi
occupation.
<p>
   This small oil-rich state, which still fears Iraqi aggression,
signed a 10-year defense agreement with Washington after the war.
It also signed similar ones with a number of its other Western
allies.
<p>
   Tehran, which opposes the presence of more than 20,000 U.S.
servicemen in the Gulf, has long urged its Arab neighbors to end
their close alliances with the United States.
<p>
   Washington has accused the Islamic Republic of engaging in a
massive arms buildup that includes efforts to acquire nuclear
weapons.
<p>
   Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
<p>
   Sheik Saud said both Gulf countries and Iran ``do not accept
interference in one another's affairs'' and relations between them
would be ``at its best if they were based on that principle.''
<p>
   Ties between Kuwait and Iran were strained during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war because of Kuwait's financial support to Baghdad. But
Tehran's neutrality during the Gulf War brought the countries
closer together.
<p>
   A Foreign Ministry official who spoke to The Associated Press
said Thursday that Iran's ambassador, Gholam Ali Sanaati, was
called to the ministry Wednesday.
<p>
   The official said Sanaati was ``asked to clarify'' his presence
at a gathering by a Kuwaiti lawmaker who was attacking the United
States because he was banned from attending meetings with U.S.
officials on a visit to Washington last month.
<p>
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
reports that Kuwait was planning to ask Tehran to withdraw its
ambassador for interfering in Kuwait's internal affairs were
``exaggerated.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  Taiwanese police were ordered Thursday to
wear bulletproof vests and helmets when making arrests following a
rash of shooting deaths in the ranks.
<p>
   Speaking after the killing of officer Lin An-shun in a Taipei
suburb, police commissioner Ting Yuan-chin said all departments
must enforce the order or face punishment.
<p>
   Lin died in a shootout with suspected amphetamine dealers in
Chungho, southern Taipei, early Thursday.
<p>
   Another officer was in critical condition with a bullet lodged
in his brain, and a third was hospitalized with slight injuries.
One suspect was shot and hospitalized, and at least one other
escaped on foot.
<p>
   Lin's death followed that of officer Huang Ping-jung in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, on Tuesday in a shootout with drug dealers in
which one suspect was killed and one captured.
<p>
   Four other officers have been shot or beaten to death since
January, leading to demands for better training and equipment.
<p>
   Handguns and assault weapons are banned in Taiwan, but criminal
gangs smuggle them in from China and the Philippines.
<p>
   Police say standard-issue bulletproof vests are too few and fit
so badly that they can't draw their guns when the straps are
closed.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Amnesty International on Thursday accused
the government of carrying out arbitrary political arrests, torture
and ill-treatment of suspects in post-civil war Lebanon.
<p>
   Despite the violations, the situation represents a ``significant
improvement'' in people's basic rights over the 1975-90 civil war
years, the London-based international human rights organization
said.
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from the government on the
38-page report, which was released by Amnesty officials in Beirut.
<p>
   Abdul Salam Sayed Ahmed, an Amnesty representative who released
the report at a press conference Thursday, said he had handed
copies to officials of the Lebanese foreign and justice ministries.
<p>
   ``We expect to receive soon a detailed response from the
Lebanese authorities on the report,'' Ahmed said.
<p>
   In its report, Amnesty said: ``The end of the war has signaled
an end to mass human rights abuses such as deliberate and
indiscriminate killings, abductions and `disappearances,' with the
state once more in a position to uphold the rule of law.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A close ally of Burmese democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, imprisoned by the military government for
the past eight years, has been sent to Rangoon General Hospital
with serious heart problems, democrats and human rights groups said
Thursday.
<p>
   Win Tin, a member of the central executive committee of Suu
Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, was
transferred to the hospital from Myingyan Prison near Mandalay
sometime last week, Human Rights Watch Asia said in a news release
received in Bangkok.
<p>
   Members of Suu Kyi's party in Rangoon confirmed that Win Tin has
been admitted to the hospital and is in the cardiac ward. They said
he has been responding to medication and his condition was
beginning to improve.
<p>
   Although the rights groups said Win Tin had been released from
prison, an aide at Suu Kyi's home said his prison sentence had not
been commuted.
<p>
   ``It's not true. His condition is also not as hopeless as some
have said,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Suu Kyi's cousin, Aye Win, who has been languishing in Insein
Prison in Rangoon since May 1996 without being tried for any crime,
is also in the cardiac ward, NLD members said.
<p>
   Party members said the military government would be asked to
allow Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders to visit Win Tin.
<p>
   A government spokesman said Win Tin had been serving his
sentence at Insein and was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 20
because prison doctors suspected he had high blood pressure and
heart problems.
<p>
   ``His health condition is normal and extra-medical attention is
being provided for precautionary measures,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said Win Tin was allowed
family visits.
<p>
   The former newspaper editor, reportedly viewed by the military
as a troublesome adviser to Suu Kyi, suffers from a heart condition
that requires constant medication. He also developed spinal
problems while in prison.
<p>
   The Burmese military has denied the Red Cross access to
political prisoners. Human rights groups have documented systematic
abuses in the Burmese prison system, considered one of the worst in
the world.
<p>
   Rights groups reported last year that Win Tin had been beaten
and was being kept in a tiny cell meant to house military dogs.
<p>
   He was arrested in June 1989 for allegedly having phone
conversations with the father of a fugitive and sentenced to three
years imprisonment in October of that year, Suu Kyi wrote in a
newspaper column in 1996.
<p>
   In June 1992, he was given an additional 11 years in prison in
what Suu Kyi called ``another farcical trial.'' He was also given
five more years in 1995 for writing a letter to the United Nations.
<p>
   Unlike Suu Kyi and most other NLD members arrested in 1989-90,
Win Tin was never released. Burmese democracy activists in Bangkok
said the military fears Win Tin for his strong intellect, believing
he advised Suu Kyi on political strategy and tactics.
<p>
   ``Immediately after his arrest, U Win Tin was kept without food
and sleep for three days,'' Suu Kyi wrote. ``It appeared the
interrogators wished to force him to admit that he was my adviser,
in other words, my puppet master.
<p>
   ``A man of courage and integrity, Win Tin would not be
intimidated into making false confessions.''
<p>
   Suu Kyi said Win Tin sent her a message of ``strong, unequivocal
support'' through U.S. congressman Bill Richardson, who visited him
in prison in 1994 and afterward met Suu Kyi while she was under her
six years of house arrest.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch Asia said Win Tin was transferred from Insein
Prison in Rangoon to Myingyan, about 540 kilometers (335 miles)
northwest of the capital.
<p>
   His family was unable to travel there to give him the medication
he needed, the rights group said.
<p>
   Myingyan is regarded as one of Burma's most brutal prisons.
<p>
   Tin Win Aung, a Burmese exile recently released from Myingyan,
said prisoners who complained of illness were beaten, and
hospitalization was permitted only for those about to die.

Court fines Turkish waiter for having sex with British child bride

<p>
   KAHRAMANMARAS, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  A Turkish waiter was given a
symbolic fine of 1.5 million liras (dlrs 8.50) Thursday for having
sex with an underage British girl whom he had married in an
unofficial religious ceremony.
<p>
   Musa Komeagac was on trial for his relationship with Sarah Cook,
who had converted to Islam and married him at the age of 14 last
year. Sex with persons under 15 is illegal in Turkey.
<p>
   Komeagac was originally sentenced to 10 months in jail, but it
was commuted to a fine.
<p>
   ``Now my only dream is to rejoin Sarah and my boy,'' Komeagac
told The Associated Press by telephone. He said, however, that
British authorities are barring him from entering the country.
<p>
   Sarah, now 15, gave birth in October to a boy at her hometown,
Braintree, Essex.
<p>
   The couple met while Sarah and her family were vacationing at a
Turkish Mediterranean resort two years ago.

world 100-meter butterfly record at the Australian swimming
championships on Thursday.
<p>
   The 20-year-old clocked 52.15 seconds to better Russian Denis
Pankratov's previous world mark by 0.12 seconds. Pankratov set the
former world record of 52.27 to win gold at last year's Atlanta
Olympics.
<p>
   Klim's time at the Chandler Aquatic Center came after a
controversial false start when the finalists swam 65 meters before
being stopped by officials.
<p>
   They had to wait another 20 minutes before taking to the blocks
for a second time.

   Klim raised both arms in the air in triumph after the
history-breaking swim.

<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  A Swiss banker who allegedly caused
massive losses at Bank Rothschild AG Zurich is expected to plead
guilty Friday to illegally entering Thailand, probably hastening
extradition, police said.
<p>
   Thai Immigration Police Lt. Amornchai Panya said that Juerg Heer
was likely to be immediately fined 6,000 baht (dlrs 166) after
Friday's hearing and then undergo a quick extradition hearing.
<p>
   After meeting Thai police Thursday, Heer was persuaded to enter
a plea of guilty at the hearing, Amornchai said. Under Thai law, he
is not entitled to a lawyer to represent him at the hearing since
the potential penalty is less than three years in prison.
<p>
   The speed with which he is sent home will depend on completion
of the formal paperwork by the Swiss, Amornchai said.
<p>
   Heer, 61, a former credit manager of the bank, is accused of
siphoning off 65 million Swiss francs (dlrs 44 million at current
rates) between 1986 and 1992.
<p>
   The bank dismissed him in 1992 for suspected irregularities and
he was arrested. But after two months in jail, authorities released
him provisionally and allowed him to travel to Thailand on
vacation. He never returned.
<p>
   Bank Rothschild, a normally secretive institution, held a news
conference at the time to deny Heer's allegation that it operated a
``criminal system.''
<p>
   The bank alleged that Heer's transactions caused total damages
of 271 million francs (dlrs 186 million).
<p>
   After the case came to light, the bank underwent a management
shakeup and was forced to arrange for a capital injection.
<p>
   Heer allegedly used the money to finance a lavish lifestyle and
accumulate 20 million francs (dlrs 14 million) worth of expensive
cars, furniture and art.
<p>
   There was strong public interest in the fugitive banker  &MD;  not
least because of the rewards of up to 53,000 francs (dlrs 37,000)
offered for information about him.
<p>
   Heer was arrested in Thailand last Saturday. According to Swiss
newspapers, Heer had been living in Thailand for the past 17 months
under three different passports and false names.

   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Former Cabinet Minister Maurice Papon
awaited a ruling Thursday on his request to be freed from prison
during his trial for crimes against humanity while serving France's
pro-Nazi Vichy regime during World War II.
<p>
   Papon spent a second night in prison following the opening of
his trial on Wednesday, when he told a hushed courtroom that he
lacks the physical, psychological and moral stamina to defend
himself while in prison.
<p>
   Papon, 87, is the most senior French official ever to stand
trial for his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews.
<p>
   Papon's lawyer demanded the court free him during the trial,
expected to last into December. A medical panel was appointed to
determine whether Papon could withstand detention during the
proceedings, which were to resume Thursday afternoon.
<p>
   Lawyers representing several hundred victims' families,
Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups who have waited 16 years for
the trial oppose Papon's request.
<p>
   The opening day of the trial was a historic moment for France,
and the long-awaited process shed light on the Vichy
administration's treatment of Jews during World War II.
<p>
   Papon became the highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy
regime to stand trial on charges he committed crimes against
humanity as a police supervisor in Bordeaux during World War II.

German denies direct involvement in drug use
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Former East German track and field
coach Ekkart Arbeit denied Thursday that he had been directly
involved in the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
<p>
   With a review under way into the Athletics Australia's
appointment of Arbeit as Australian coaching director, Arbeit
conceded drugs were part of the sport system in the Communist
regime when he was coaching there in the 1980s.
<p>
   But Arbeit said he had no direct involvement in the systematic
doping of athletes at a time when most other countries were also
using drugs in sport.
<p>
   ``At this time it was a part of the training system,'' Arbeit
said in a television interview. ``We were much better in training,
it is easy to say they were better because they took drugs . . .
that is really not right.
<p>
   ``You think that (East Germany) was the center for all drugs?
It's not at all. It was a part of the training all over the world.
It was a fact of life.
<p>
   ``So we have to say, everybody was a cheat or from everybody it
was not correct, that is the truth.''
<p>
   Despite the denials, some of Australia's leading athletes have
called for Arbeit's dismissal.
<p>
   A group of athletes and coaches met Thursday, issuing an
ultimatum to Athletics Australia officials to get rid of Arbeit
immediately.
<p>
   Arbeit said he believed his letter of offer for the position was
a binding legal document and he would have to be paid out the US
dlrs 288,000 value if the agreement was broken.
<p>
   ``I believe I have a legal contract,'' he said.
<p>
   Asked if he would have to be paid out if the agreement was
broken, Arbeit said: ``Of course, of course, that's for sure.
<p>
   ``I don't like to take money without (doing) my part of the
job,'' he said. ``I don't like to do it but I have other
possibilities, for example also the possibility of South Korea but
I said no, I would like to work for Australia.''

Tung clashes with leading democrat on Hong Kong's democracy
Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS throughout with fresh quotes

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa differed sharply
with the territory's leading democrat Thursday over the pace of
democracy, saying it was more important to improve living
standards.
<p>
   Martin Lee, chairman of the Democratic Party, accused Tung of
doing China's bidding by curtailing Hong Kong's freedoms.
<p>
   The conflict resurfaced a day after Tung delivered his first
annual policy address to the legislature as Hong Kong's
post-colonial leader.
<p>
   That speech dealt only briefly with the future of democracy, and
Tung followed up Thursday by urging radio listeners to stop
dwelling on China's 1989 crackdown on protesters, and to be careful
how they handle matters that are acutely sensitive to China.
<p>
   Later, in a speech, he said he wanted to put aside questions of
democratic development for a few years and focus on housing,
education and welfare.
<p>
   Lee, meanwhile, appeared before reporters to denounce Tung as an
unelected leader, ``accountable to no one,'' who had rolled back
voter rights without consulting the public.
<p>
   ``Perhaps he is only accountable to Beijing,'' Lee said.
<p>
   Lee's Democrats, the most popular party in Hong Kong, are
excluded from the legislature China set up to replace the elected
one on July 1, when the British colony reverted to Chinese
sovereignty.
<p>
   But Tung, heading a semiautonomous Hong Kong government, is also
proving popular, according to opinion polls. He has had a largely
trouble-free 100 days under Chinese sovereignty, and the signs are
that Beijing is not trying to micromanage him.
<p>
   In his speech to business leaders, Tung was asked when Hong Kong
would have full democracy.
<p>
   ``I'd like to think about it a few years down the road,'' he
said, adding that it was more urgent ``to tackle all these issues
of livelihood, education, ...''
<p>
   Judging from the calls to Tung on a radio phone-in program, many
people agree. Almost all the questions were about housing,
education, pollution and welfare.
<p>
   But the potential difficulties he faces were evident in one
question, from a woman asking whether China should admit it was
wrong to crush the 1989 protest movement at Tiananmen Square in
Beijing.
<p>
   ``I think it's now time for Hong Kong to lose this burden,''
Tung said. ``We have a very important future ahead of us.'' People
should instead take pride in China's economic achievements since
1989, he said.
<p>
   ``We cannot forget it,'' the woman replied. ``The memory is
still very fresh.''
<p>
   The attitude of many Hong Kong people to China is defined by the
events of 1989, and tens of thousands rally every June 4 to
remember the victims.
<p>
   Any attempt to curb the commemoration would play into the hands
of critics like Lee who claim Tung is Beijing's yes-man. But he
must also show Beijing that Hong Kong is not becoming a base for
subverting China.
<p>
   Tung insisted he was in favor of full democracy, and that China
had already laid out a timetable for achieving it.
<p>
   ``Democracy is very important to Hong Kong,'' he said. ``It's
about people having a choice, about the government being held
accountable to the people. ... We are all moving in that
direction.''
<p>
   Lee accused Tung of ``putting our fate in the hands of Chinese
leaders.''
<p>
   Hong Kong needs a leader to ``defend our system and not to try
to assimilate our system with the mainland system,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Does he realize that Hong Kong people are here because of
freedom? Does he realize so many of our friends and relatives have
left Hong Kong in the last decade because of the loss of freedom?''

Hong Kong share prices plunge after Greenspan comments
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Share prices plunged on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange Thursday in response to inflation warnings by U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
<p>
   The key Hang Seng Index of blue chips fell 565.40 points, or 3.8
percent, closing at 14,273.12, after rising 27.76 points Wednesday.
<p>
   The Fed chairman said an interest rate increase may be needed to
cool down the U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
finished 1 percent lower after Greenspan spoke Wednesday.
<p>
   Traders said investors used the weak U.S. stock market as an
excuse to push the home stock market lower.
<p>
   ``People also squared their positions, ahead of a long
holiday,'' which deepened losses, said Kenny Tang, research head of
C.A. Pacific Group Ltd.
<p>
   Turnover was 15.06 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 1.9 billion),
compared with Wednesday's 10.95 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 1.4
billion).
<p>
   Among major sub-indexes, financials plunged 730.31 points to
18,033.14, while utilities lost 501.65 points to 12,387.51.
<p>
   Properties slumped 758.21 points to 24,225.03, and commercials
and industrials shed 428.7 points to 8,996.14.

BC-Sports-Field Hockey-Champions Trophy
Host team confident in six-team event
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Australia will have to rewrite
history to win the Champions Trophy field hockey title, but coach
Terry Walsh is confident his team has the potential.
<p>
   No team has come from last place to claim the Champions Trophy
in the space of one year, but Walsh said his team had matured since
its disastrous campaign in India last December.
<p>
   He said at this time last year many of the Australians,
including junior team vice-captain Baeden Choppy, were finding
their feet on the international stage.
<p>
   ``We threw a lot of young guys to the lions at the end of last
year because we had a group of players at the top level in a
holding pattern,'' Walsh said Thursday.
<p>
   ``We needed to find out if hockey was going to be an integral
part of their lives.''
<p>
   Australia, which has won both Champions trophies staged in
Australia in 1985 and 1990, opens the round-robin tournament
against Olympic silver medal winner Spain at Pines Stadium on
Saturday.
<p>
   While most rate the Netherlands, Olympic gold medal winners and
current Champions Trophy holder, as the favorite, coach Roelent
Oltmans said his side felt no pressure to continue its recent
domination of the sport.
<p>
   He said with the best six sides in the world competing, any
nation could win.
<p>
   ``Every match is a final in this event and that is the
difference with it compared to the Olympics or world championship
where there are always weaker teams in your group,'' Oltmans said.
<p>
   ``We'll defend our title as well as we can but any team can
finish on top  &MD;  that's one of the nice things about the Champions
Trophy and that's why there's no extra pressure.''
<p>
   The eight-day tournament begins Saturday and finishes the
following weekend with a championship final between the two
highest-placed teams. Each team will play each other once.
<p>
   The Netherlands play Asian champion South Korea and World Cup
champions Pakistan takes on European winners Germany in other
matches Saturday.

Manila suspends two environment officials for Marcopper mining
spill
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Two environment officials were
suspended from their jobs Thursday in connection with a massive
waste spill at a copper mine last year.
<p>
   The government Ombudsman said Environment Undersecretary Delfin
Ganapin was suspended for a year without pay for extending an
environment clearance for the Marcopper mine without proper
authorization. It said only the environment secretary is entitled
to issue such clearances.
<p>
   The other official, Antonio Principe, director of the
environment department's regional office, was suspended for six
months on charges of not having properly monitored the mine despite
reports of problems there.
<p>
   Until recently, Canada's Placer Dome Inc. owned 39.9 percent of
Marcopper.
<p>
   On March 24, 1996, a concrete plug in a drainage tunnel at the
Marcopper mine failed, sending millions of tons of liquefied mining
waste gushing into the Boac River, 160 kilometers (100 miles)
southeast of Manila.
<p>
   The Ombudsman, which investigates charges of wrongdoing by
government officials, said Ganapin also had failed to make certain
that Marcopper observed the terms of its environmental clearance
and properly disposed of its mining waste.
<p>
   Ganapin called the decision ``unjust and undeserved'' and said
he was surprised because the Ombudsman's office had earlier cleared
him of responsibility in the mine accident.
<p>
   Ganapin immediately offered to resign after the suspension order
but Environment Secretary Victor Ramos refused to accept the offer
and assured Ganapin that he will support efforts to overturn the
decision.
<p>
   Ramos said the order will have a ``dire implication'' because
many projects will be delayed if officials become reluctant to
issue approvals for fear they can be held accountable later for
accidents.
<p>
   Ganapin said he issued the clearance in 1991 after Marcopper
followed all environmental regulations issued by the department.
<p>
   Three officials of Marcopper, the Philippines' third-largest
copper mining company, are on trial on charges of criminal
negligence in connection with the accident. The next trial session
is scheduled Oct. 29.
<p>
   Former company president John Loney, resident manager Steve Reid
and senior manager Pedro Hernandez face charges of criminal
negligence and violation of the Philippine Mining Act.
<p>
   Only Hernandez, who is Filipino, has been attending the court
hearings. Loney and Reid, who are Australians, waived their right
to appear.
<p>
   Violation of the mining act is punishable by up to six years'
imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 pesos (dlrs 14,300). Negligence
carries a maximum penalty of 28 months in prison plus damages, both
actual and compensatory.
<p>
   The government has canceled Marcopper's operating permit.

<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
coast Thursday with high winds and towering seas as it skirted past
Acapulco, Mexico's most popular resort.
<p>
   The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported near-hurricane force
winds of 59 mph (94 kph) raked Acapulco before dawn Thursday as the
storm moved northward up the coast toward the beach resorts of
Zihuatenejo, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta.
<p>
   Earlier in the evening, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and
fishing villages near Huatulco, churning up 30-foot (9-meter) seas
with 115 mph (185 kph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and
ruined residences.
<p>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. But
telephone communication to much of the coast was cut after Pauline
began pummeling the shore late Wednesday.
<p>
   Tourists huddled in darkened hotels and hundreds of Mexican
coastal dwellers sought refuge in emergency shelters overnight.
<p>
   At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Pauline was centered about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco and quickly moving
west-northwest up the coast at 15 mph (24 kph), the National
Hurricane Center in Miami said.
<p>
   Hurricane warnings extended hundreds of miles (kilometers) up
the coast to Puerto Vallarta, including Manzanillo and Zihuatenejo,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shoreline.
<p>
   Reached in Miami, Hurricane Center specialist Lixion Avila said
early Thursday that Pauline's path remained highly unpredictable
and that forecasters were having trouble tracking the eye.
<p>
   He said a worst-case scenario would have had the hurricane
directly striking Acapulco, which has 2.9 million inhabitants.
Instead, the storm skirted by, buffeting the city with high winds
and torrential rain.
<p>
   While the hurricane could weaken rapidly if it headed inland, he
said it could keep up potentially destructive fury by holding close
to water. Regardless, serious threats of flooding and tidal surges
remained.
<p>
   ``Preparations to protect life and property in the warning area
should be rushed to completion,'' the hurricane center advised,
calling Pauline's winds ``life-threatening.''
<p>
   Around Huatulco, Pauline's violent winds and rains turned
streets into rivers, ripped large trees from the ground and sent
makeshift homes of plywood flying. But nowhere did it hit as hard
as in the poor community of Las Tres Cruces, next to the Huatulco
airport.
<p>
   ``Is it gone?'' asked Pablo Avendano Lopez, one of the newly
homeless.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' replied 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo
Mayo, surveying the humble neighborhood where pots and pans lay
scattered amid broken glass and waterlogged mattresses.
<p>
   ``What about my house?'' Avendano Lopez, 45, asked. ``It's
finished,'' Gerardo Mayo said, his voice trembling as rainwater
streaked down his face.
<p>
   Pauline's eye first touched land Wednesday afternoon west of
Huatulco, and flooding was reported in parts of Oaxaca and
neighboring Chiapas state where similar scenes of destruction
played out.
<p>
   At least 24 houses  &MD;  mostly tin-and-wood shacks  &MD;  crumpled and
disappeared in floodwaters. Army troops brought in food supplies
and community leaders were considering evacuating everyone to
higher ground.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American Southwest as a
tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for the desert.
<p>
   Also in September, Hurricane Linda packed winds over 200 mph
(320 kph) but lived and died offshore. Forecasters said the El Nino
phenomenon, in which unusually warm Pacific waters disrupt weather
patterns, could be to blame for the high number of powerful
hurricanes.

Amnesty report criticizes human rights abuses in Lebanon

<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Amnesty International on Thursday accused
the government of carrying out arbitrary political arrests, torture
and abuse of suspects in post-civil war Lebanon.
<p>
   Despite the violations, the situation represents a ``significant
improvement'' in people's basic rights over the 1975-90 civil war
years, the London-based international human rights organization
said.
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from the government on the
38-page report, which was released by Amnesty officials in Beirut.
<p>
   Abdul Salam Sayed Ahmed, an Amnesty representative who released
the report at a press conference Thursday, said he had handed
copies to officials of the Lebanese foreign and justice ministries.
<p>
   ``We expect to receive soon a detailed response from the
Lebanese authorities on the report,'' Ahmed said.
<p>
   In its report, Amnesty said, ``The end of the war has signaled
an end to mass human rights abuses such as deliberate and
indiscriminate killings, abductions and `disappearances,' with the
state once more in a position to uphold the rule of law,'' Amnesty
said.
<p>
   However, the group said it was concerned that individuals' basic
rights are often ``curbed in the name of `security' and the need
for enforcing the state's authority.''
<p>
   ``Since the end of the civil war, Lebanon has witnessed mass
arbitrary political arrests and detention, torture and
ill-treatment, violations of the right to fair trial, (and) an
expansion of the number of offenses carrying the death penalty,''
the report said.
<p>
   The emphasis on security and order by the government ``may well
open the door to future human rights violations,'' Amnesty said,
adding that real security and stability can only be maintained if
each individual's human rights are protected.
<p>
   It was the first extensive report on internal Lebanese human
rights conditions since the end of the civil war. Amnesty has
issued separate documents in the last few years on human rights
conditions in southern Lebanon, where Israeli occupation forces are
fighting Lebanese guerrillas.
<p>
   In its latest report, Amnesty said hundreds of people have been
arrested but most were released later. It said three people died in
prison since 1994 as a result of alleged beatings.
<p>
   Amnesty urged the government to take steps to end torture and
ill-treatment of detainees. ``Torture may not be routine practice
but some groups are more likely to face torture because they are
usually more targeted by authorities,'' the report said.
<p>
   Amnesty also cited the arrests of suspects in Lebanon who ended
up in jails in neighboring Syria, saying such arrests are rarely
acknowledged by Lebanese or Syrian authorities although it appeared
to have taken place ``with the acquiescence of the Lebanese
government.''
<p>
   Amnesty said it was aware of at least 200 Lebanese nationals who
were detained in Syria, mostly without charge or trial. It added
that reports of arrests continue to be received since the end of
the civil war in 1990.
<p>
   Syria has up to 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon and exercises
effective control over the government.
<p>
   Security arrangements, part of a number of accords between
Beirut and Damascus, provide the legal ground for transfer of
suspects to Syrian custody.
<p>
   Amnesty also voiced its usual opposition to the death penalty
and demanded that Lebanese authorities issue a moratorium on
executions, commute the sentences of those on death row and
consider abolishing the death penalty.
<p>
   Lebanon restored capital punishment in 1994 to stem a rise in
crime in the postwar period. Ten people have since been executed by
hanging or by firing squad for security and drug-related crimes.
<p>
   The report also criticized a 1991 Amnesty Law covering political
crimes committed during the civil war. It called for a commission
of inquiry to investigate the cases of 17,415 people, mostly
Lebanese, who disappeared during the conflict. It said the
government should consider compensation for their families.
<p>
   ``A new future of true and lasting peace and human rights
protection in Lebanon is only possible if the country comes to
terms with its past,'' the report said.

Prodi goes before legislature in bid to save government
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Romano Prodi bid to keep his government from
collapsing Thursday, making a new appeal in parliament for a budget
deal with Communist hard-liners.
<p>
   A vote of confidence was expected later in the day, and it was
not immediately clear if the Communist Refoundation Party will
support the center-left coalition or allow it to fall.
<p>
   Prodi has made a series of appeals in parliament this week to
salvage his 17-month-old government at this crucial stage in its
march toward European Monterary Union.
<p>
   ``The goal is within reach,'' he repeated in his nationally
televised address before the Chamber of Deputies.
<p>
   Refoundation, whose votes Prodi needs in the chamber, has said
it will vote against Prodi's 1998 budget unless he made concessions
on pensions, health care, job creation and a shorter work week.

Report: Karadzic registers his car in Pale
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Bosnia's top war crimes suspect,
Radovan Karadzic, has openly registered his Mercedes in his
stronghold of Pale, a Belgrade newspaper reported Thursday.
<p>
   Recent rumors suggested that Karadzic may have gone into hiding
somewhere outside Pale, his stronghold just east of Sarajevo,
fearing the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia would follow through on
threats to arrest him.
<p>
   But a report in the independent Dnevni Telegraf (Daily
Telegraph) daily, carrying a photocopy of the car's registration
dated Sept. 3 and listing Karadzic's address as ``The Big Forest
St., Pale,'' indicated he may still be there.
<p>
   Although Karadzic has twice been indicted by the international
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and was formally forced out of
office under the Dayton accords, he continues to wield considerable
power from behind the scenes in the Bosnian Serb substate.
<p>
   The daily also reported that two Serb companies were demanding
Karadzic return a luxury Mercedes they purchased for him while in
office in 1993. They said the car now rightfully belongs to the
current Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic.
<p>
   Plavsic is at odds with Karadzic and his Pale aides over her
charges that they have been involved in corruption and smuggling
that has illegally brought them millions of dollars.

Ramos says Philippines will soon overcome currency crisis
By OLIVER TEVES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  President Fidel Ramos scaled down the
government's 1997 economic growth target Thursday but expressed
confidence the Philippines will overcome its currency crisis.
<p>
   The Philippines' gross national product grew by 6.8 percent in
1996, and the government initially targeted 7 to 7.5 percent growth
this year. But Ramos said growth had slowed to 5.9 percent in the
first eight months of this year, partly because of the peso's
depreciation.
<p>
   ``I would be very happy if we hit something a little over 6
percent, which would keep us still within the league of the
emerging tigers and well within the higher rankings in comparison
with other economies,'' Ramos said.
<p>
   He said recent economic uncertainty has been caused not by the
Philippines' economic fundamentals, but by the nervousness of
investors and traders who fear that, like other Southeast Asian
countries, it may be severely hurt by recent currency plunges.
<p>
   ``In our case, I am confident that we will fully weather this
storm well before the year end,'' Ramos said.
<p>
   ``Investor confidence will return. Unlike other Asian countries,
we are not suffering from policy weakness. We do not have weak
fundamentals,'' he told reporters.
<p>
   He said the Philippines is not suffering from a drop in exports,
investment flight or a breakdown of its financial system like some
other countries in the region.
<p>
   The Philippine peso averaged 34.852 pesos per dollar on
Thursday, 32 percent weaker than on July 11, when the government
allowed it to depreciate in response to speculative attacks.
<p>
   The devaluation has also rocked the stock market, led to higher
interest rates and triggered fuel price increases.
<p>
   Ramos said that like other leaders in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, he was concerned about the speculative
attacks on the region's currencies and supports the formation of a
``common front'' to fight the assaults. He did not elaborate.
<p>
   ASEAN groups Brunei, Burma, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
<p>
   The best guarantee for attracting foreign investment and
rebuilding investor confidence, Ramos said, is the Philippines'
democratic institutions.
<p>
   ``Philippine democracy and our respect for and defense of the
free market is in itself a comparative advantage that no other
countries ... can offer in our part of the world,'' he said.

Philippine president says he will not meet Suu Kyi
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  President Fidel Ramos said Thursday
he will not meet Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi when he
visits Rangoon next week, a signal that backdoor arrangements for
the meeting were not accepted by the country's military government.
<p>
   On Wednesday, Ramos said a meeting with Suu Kyi was not on his
schedule but was ``being worked out'' by the Philippine Department
of Foreign Affairs.
<p>
   On Thursday, however, he said, ``I am not seeking an audience
with Madame Suu Kyi and our Department of Foreign Affairs is not
scheduling any meeting with her, either.''
<p>
   He said the main purpose of his trip to Rangoon is to meet with
its military leaders and encourage expansion of trade, investment
and tourism ties.
<p>
   Philippine officials earlier said requests for the meeting with
the pro-democracy leader had been relayed unofficially to low-level
Burmese officials to test their chances.
<p>
   A close aide of Ramos said Burmese officials had not responded
to the request, an indication that the meeting would not be
allowed.
<p>
   Ramos said it was customary for older members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations to reach out to new ones.
<p>
   In July, Burma formally became a member of ASEAN despite
protests from Western nations critical of its human rights record.
ASEAN also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
<p>
   Ramos' visit signals the gradual assimilation into regional
politics of one of Southeast Asia's most repressive states.
<p>
   Former President Corazon Aquino, who took power after a
Philippine democratic ``people power'' revolt, also previously
sought permission from Burmese authorities to see Suu Kyi but
without success.
<p>
   Since her release from house arrest in July 1995, Suu Kyi has
persistently called for a dialogue with the generals. Since October
1996, the military has severely restricted her movements.
<p>
   ASEAN has a policy of not interfering in the domestic affairs of
member states, but recently urged Burmese military authorities to
open a dialogue with Suu Kyi.

Latin American cities seek more humane global anti-drug policies
Eds: RECASTS and trims, ADDS details on drug abuse in Medellin.
By FRANK BAJAK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  Global efforts to fight narcotics must
curb demand by doing more to treat chronic drug abusers,
representatives from Latin American cities and regions said at a
conference here, the former base of the Medellin cartel.
<p>
   ``Drug policies in our cities have been directed at repression
and the control of production and traffic without paying enough
attention to the problem of consumption,'' said a declaration
signed by delegates Wednesday.
<p>
   The two-day conference was organized by Guillermo Castano,
Medellin's drug policy coordinator. No U.S. representatives were
invited to this violence-plagued metropolis of 2 million whose name
is synonymous with the now-defunct cocaine cartel.
<p>
   The huge demand for illicit drugs in the United States has
fostered a cheap and abundant supply of marijuana and cocaine in
this source country.
<p>
   Medellin itself has an estimated 1,500 hard-core, indigent drug
abusers  &MD;  more than half of whom have shown no interest in
rehabilitation.
<p>
   The city offers them a daily meal, a place to shower and to wash
their clothes. Castano would like to do more, but his annual budget
of dlrs 500,000 goes only so far.
<p>
   Castano feels Colombia has been unfairly stigmatized by the
Washington-led drug war. He had wanted conference delegates to
advocate an end to the prosecution of drug addicts and to endorse
``harm reduction'' methods practiced in much of Europe.
<p>
   His model was a 1990 resolution signed by more than 30 European
cities that labels attempts to stop the flow of illegal drugs a
failure and advocates the decriminalization of marijuana as well as
small quantities of hard drugs for personal use.
<p>
   The Medellin document does not go so far, but does say that
offering help to ``drug addicts should not depend on making total
abstinence the lone objective. Intermediate objectives that achieve
a dignified life for the individual can also be reached.''
<p>
   Signatories included representatives of this city and Bogota;
Santiago, Chile; Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion; Bolivia's La Paz; Havana; and the
Mexican state of Jalisco.

Communist leader calls for no-confidence vote, but also offers
compromise

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  The Communist Party leader pledged Thursday to
hold a no-confidence vote on President Boris Yeltsin's government
next week. But he also suggested a compromise that could resolve
the bitter dispute over the 1998 budget.
<p>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a news conference that
Yeltsin's economic policies were ``doomed to failure,'' and
reiterated plans for a no-confidence vote next week, possibly on
Thursday.
<p>
   But Zyuganov also proposed a conciliatory commission made up of
lawmakers and government representatives to hammer out differences
on next year's budget, the main point of contention at present.
<p>
   Parliament was likely to reject the government's draft budget
later Thursday. The proposed commission would then try to reconcile
Yeltsin's goal of an austere budget that limits spending with the
communists' desire to increase the amount of money for social
programs.
<p>
   Even if the Duma passes a no-confidence measure next week, it
would not have any immediate impact. The chamber must pass a second
no-confidence measure within three months in order to force Yeltsin
into making a choice: dismiss his cabinet or dismiss parliament and
hold new parliamentary elections.
<p>
   Despite his sharp criticism of the Yeltsin administration,
Zyuganov also said the government had enough ``honest, decent
people'' and it's only necessary ``to create conditions to allow
these people to work.''
<p>
   This year's debate over the budget is similar to the battles
waged in recent years. Ultimately, the two sides have worked out
behind-the-scenes compromises and many observers expect the same
outcome this year despite the heated rhetoric.
<p>
   Yeltsin has made clear he is prepared to dissolve the lower
house and call new elections if no-confidence motions are passed.
<p>
   He has repeatedly assailed the Duma for blocking his economic
plans, which include calls for tax reform and expanded land
ownership rights.
<p>
   The budget calls for sharp spending cuts and forecasts overall
economic growth of 2 percent in 1998. If achieved, it would mark
the first year of growth after six years of decline.
<p>
   ``This budget is quite realistic,'' First Deputy Finance
Minister Vladimir Petrov said in a speech before the lawmakers
Thursday.
<p>
   Communists and their allies say the state subsidies are
necessary to save ailing Russian industries from total ruin and
help stimulate growth.
<p>
   ``The budget looks like that of an ill-developed country,'' said
Communist Yuri Maslyukov, who chairs the Duma's economic policy
committee.

BC-Thailand-Body Piercing
Tranced religious devotees pierce bodies with spikes, swords
AP Photos BK101-102

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHUKET, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  Tranced to numb the pain, the teen-age
acolyte didn't bat an eye as the temple elder held his mouth open
and pierced his cheek with a meter (yard)-long steel spike, like a
needle punching through cloth.
<p>
   Their faces a scene of horror, the youth and scores of others
like him marched down the streets of Phuket's main town, driven on
by the din of Chinese music, firecrackers and cheers from a crowd
that wiped off his blood and occasionally stuck money on the spike.
<p>
   ``When I'm pierced, I don't feel anything,'' said Udom Than, a
devotee. ``I'm possessed.''
<p>
   Once a year, Phuket transforms from Thailand's best-known
tropical island into the stage for one of the world's most bizarre
rituals of self-mortification  &MD;  oddly known as the Vegetarian
Festival.
<p>
   Across Thailand, the festival is traditionally celebrated in the
ninth lunar month of the Chinese year, ending Friday. During that
time, many of Thailand's 6 million or so ethnic Chinese will
refrain from eating meat.
<p>
   But on Phuket, a beach paradise 690 kilometers (428 miles) in
the Andaman Sea south of Bangkok, the festival takes on a
masochistic turn shrouded in convoluted legend. It has turned into
a crowd draw at the slowest part of the tourist season.
<p>
   For teen-age devotees, the festival is a rite of toughness. But
older men and some women predominate, driven on by prestige and
tradition. They all abstain from meat, alcohol and sex for nine
days before the piercing.
<p>
   ``The body piercing, I think, is getting out of hand,'' said a
temple elder, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's become a
big tourist attraction, with more and more youngsters getting
involved each year, sort of a macho thing.''
<p>
   Devotees gather at several temples celebrating Chinese gods and
spirits and go through a series of purification rituals that, after
several days, culminate with going into a trance.
<p>
   They roll back their eyes, shake their heads, dance  &MD;  whatever
it takes to block out the pain  &MD;  before, in an ultimate show of
religious devotion, they pierce their bodies.
<p>
   Most put a single steel rod through one cheek. The more
experienced or daring might put four through their cheeks at
crazily crossed angles, another through the skin of their necks,
and maybe one or two more through their arms.
<p>
   Others choose more bizarre objects: a sword, an umbrella, a
small tree, a bicycle, a sailfish, a musket, a lamp. One year, even
the kitchen sink  &MD;  faucet plunged through the cheek and the basin
carried by a helper.
<p>
   This year, a man sprayed blood down his chest as he ripped his
tongue on a logging saw. Most marchers don't bleed much, though  &MD; 
until the pierced objects are withdrawn, uncorking their wounds.
<p>
   The helpful along the parade route sometimes offer tea to the
marchers. But it's more symbolic than helpful, since most can't
swallow well with a mouth full of steel.
<p>
   Phuket health authorities have advised the temples to take
precautions  &MD;  such as not sharing spikes and wearing rubber gloves
when handling them  &MD;  against the blood-borne HIV virus that causes
AIDS.
<p>
   The Phuket variant of the vegetarian festival has its roots in
the discovery of tin on the island about 160 years ago and Chinese
workers coming to the mines. An epidemic swept the island at the
same time a Chinese opera troupe was touring to entertain them.
<p>
   One performer suggested the Chinese were being plagued because
they were failing to observe traditions, including the vegetarian
festival. It was duly marked from then on  &MD;  with a new twist of
self-mortification to welcome the arrival of the Nine Emperor Gods.
<p>
   At the festival's outset, ordinary worshipers deposit fruit and
incense at the temples. Each temple has a scheduled parade. On the
previous night, hundreds gather to watch men and women reputedly
become possessed by the gods and speak in ancient Chinese. Some
walk on hot coals, others climb blade ladders.
<p>
   The next day, they pierce themselves and march. Ambulances stand
by to transport those overcome by shock  &MD;  surprisingly rare  &MD;  to
hospital. Apart from soreness, little real damage is done.
<p>
   ``It's the faith,'' one acolyte, who gave his name only as
Thisan, said after the march. ``Faith in the gods here. Sorry,
that's enough now  &MD;  it hurts.''

U.S. Commerce Secretary ends China visit with no deals
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  For all his tough talk about trade, U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley will return from his first trip to China
with no deals in hand.
<p>
   Daley and China's trade minister, Wu Yi, had been widely
expected to announce an agreement on a Chinese purchase of 30
Boeing aircraft for dlrs 2 billion.
<p>
   But the officials ended several days of talks Thursday with only
broad agreement to increase cooperation on discussing trade issues.
<p>
   ``We are not announcing any contracts, any deals,'' Daley told
reporters as he wrapped up his four-day visit to China.
<p>
   Daley had said earlier in the week that he hoped to have
something to announce on Thursday.
<p>
   The on-again, off-again Boeing deal was set earlier in the week,
but the two sides wavered on the timing of the announcement,
according to well informed company and government sources.
<p>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin may be saving the news for his
state visit to the United States later this month. Such a deal
would come in handy if Jiang is confronted, as he inevitably will
be, over China's growing trade surplus with the United States.
<p>
   In one sign of progress, Wu told Daley that China would send a
purchasing mission to the United States. Officials on both sides
declined to provide details.
<p>
   A Boeing deal would help soothe frustrations over China's
purchases of some 60 Airbuses in the past two years, including the
sale of 30 announced during French President Jacques Chirac's visit
to Beijing in May.
<p>
   That deal was widely viewed as a reward to France and other
European nations for their willingness to tone down criticism of
China's human rights record.
<p>
   An aircraft purchase also would make a noticeable, but small,
dent in the U.S. trade deficit with China, which according to U.S.
reckoning is expected to rise to dlrs 44 billion this year and is
second only to Japan's.
<p>
   Daley made the ``dramatic imbalance'' in trade, as he described
it, a key issue in his meetings with Jiang and other leaders.
<p>
   Both Daley and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who visited
China just two weeks ago, were actively involved in the talks over
the Boeing deal.
<p>
   Top executives of the Seattle, Washington-based company and
Washington state Gov. Gary Locke also were in town this week,
heightening speculation that a deal was imminent.
<p>
   But aircraft were not the only urgent issue on Daley's agenda.
He strongly urged China to do more to open its markets to a wide
range of foreign goods and services, saying more must be done if
Beijing is to join the World Trade Organization.
<p>
   China wants WTO membership on concessionary terms for developing
countries that cushion the blow of increased competition. The
United States and other industrialized countries contend that
China's economy is strong enough to withstand a faster pace of
market-opening reforms.
<p>
   On Thursday, Daley did not announce any new promises by China to
ease trade barriers that American officials say are a major factor
in the yawning U.S. trade deficit.

Top U.S. official urges Egypt to attend economic meeting with
Israel
By LOUIS MEIXLER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  A top U.S. official urged Egypt on Thursday
to attend a regional economic conference with Israel, saying that
Middle Eastern countries must show investors that political
uncertainties will not affect business.
<p>
   The economic conference planned next month ``will send a signal
that again the Middle East is open for business even at a time of
difficult political circumstances,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart
E. Eizenstat said after meeting Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
<p>
   Egypt has not yet decided whether to attend the conference,
scheduled to open November 16 in the Gulf state of Qatar. Many Arab
states have threatened to boycott the meeting, arguing Israel has
stalled the peace process and should not be rewarded.
<p>
   The conference is designed to promote Israeli-Arab economic
cooperation and would be the fourth since the 1991 start of the
Middle East peace process
<p>
   ``It is important to divorce political considerations from an
economic conference,'' Eizenstat told reporters.
<p>
   ``Investors ... want a sense of certainty and stability and they
want the notion that the political process... is not going to be an
impediment to doing business here,'' he said.
<p>
   Eizenstat also said that Middle Eastern countries must work to
promote regional trade.
<p>
   Only 7 percent of trade in the Middle East is between countries
of the region, one of the lowest figures in the world, he said.
<p>
   Jordan and Oman are the only Arab states that have said they
will attend the economic conference.
<p>
   Eizenstat arrived in Egypt after visiting Israel, the
Palestinian-controlled areas and Jordan.

   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Former Cabinet Minister Maurice Papon
awaited a ruling Thursday on his request to be freed from prison
during his trial for crimes against humanity while serving France's
pro-Nazi Vichy regime during World War II.
<p>
   Papon, 87, the most senior French official ever to stand trial
for his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews claims his
health cannot withstand imprisonment during the trial.
<p>
   Two doctors appointed by the court examined Papon, and their
findings were to be presented to the court on Thursday, according
to Christine Chastenet, in charge of the press at the Palais de
Justice, packed with reporters.
<p>
   She said the doctors' findings would then be opened to comment
before a ruling is made.
<p>
   Papon spent a second night in prison following the opening of
his trial on Wednesday, when he told a hushed courtroom that he
lacks the physical, psychological and moral stamina to defend
himself while in prison.
<p>
   Papon's lawyer demanded the court free him during the trial,
expected to last into December.
<p>
   Lawyers representing several hundred victims' families,
Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups who have waited 16 years for
the trial oppose Papon's request.
<p>
   ``I can't stand the idea of Papon going to a five-star hotel
every night after the hearings,'' said Therese Stopnicki, a civil
party in the case. Her two sisters, aged 2 and 5, were arrested by
Papon.
<p>
   ``It's his way of thumbing his nose at us, of literally going
free, after all we've gone through to bring him to trial.''
<p>
   The opening day of the trial was a historic moment for France,
and the long-awaited proceedings shed light on the Vichy
administration's treatment of Jews during World War II.
<p>
   Papon became the highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy
regime to stand trial on charges he committed crimes against
humanity as a police supervisor in Bordeaux during World War II.

Russia's September GDP up 2.3 percent from year earlier
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's gross domestic product was up 2.3 percent
in September compared to a year earlier, while industrial
production was 2.4 percent higher, according to preliminary
government data released Thursday.
<p>
   For the first nine months of the year, GDP was up 0.2 percent
and industrial output up 1.5 percent, the State Statistics
Committee said.
<p>
   For the full year, the government is forecasting zero GDP
growth.
<p>
   Many economists say the economy appears to be bottoming out,
with some hints of modest growth, after six straight years of
decline.

Wayward Philippine ferry rams yachts, oil tankers, causes oil
spill
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  An inter-island ferry went out of
control as it maneuvered to berth in a Manila port and rammed two
yachts and three oil tankers, officials said Thursday.
<p>
   A Philippine navy spokesman said no one was injured in the
accident Sunday but about 15 drums of bunker fuel spilled from one
of the damaged tankers into Manila Bay. Authorities were still
trying to contain the spill on Thursday, he said.
<p>
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Salvador Cuba said the 11,400-ton Super Ferry II
was carrying only a small number of crewmen and had just been
fumigated at the bay's anchorage area after undergoing repairs at a
central Philippine shipyard.
<p>
   Cuba said the navy did not immediately report the incident
because it did not pose any danger to the public.
<p>
   Game Sevillano, personnel manager of William Gotong and Aboitiz
Co., which owns the ferry, said its engine apparently lost power as
it slowly moved into the berth area, causing it to slam into the
other vessels.
<p>
   ``We're just lucky no one got injured and the ship did not crash
into the pier,'' he said.
<p>
   He said the ferry's crew, provided by a Manila-based manning
agency, was being investigated.
<p>
   The ferry, which can carry more than 2,000 passengers, was
damaged slightly. It is part of a newer fleet of large passenger
ships that are slowly replacing rickety wooden ferries serving the
archipelago.
<p>
   Last March, a fire devastated another ferry owned by the same
company while crew members were unloading cargo and refueling the
ship at the Manila port.
<p>
   Officials said the fire could have been a major disaster had it
occurred while the ferry, estimated to be worth 800 million pesos
(dlrs 30 million), was at sea with passengers.

Prodi goes before legislature in bid to save government
EDs: INSERTS Communist reaction, other details, ADDS byline
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Romano Prodi bid to keep his government from
collapsing Thursday, making what he called a final appeal in
parliament for a budget deal with Communist hard-liners.
<p>
   A vote of confidence was expected later in the day, and it was
not immediately clear if the Communist Refoundation Party will
support the center-left coalition or allow it to fall.
<p>
   ``I will draw the necessary conclusions'' from the vote, Prodi
said, indicating he would offer his resignation if he loses.
<p>
   Prodi has made a series of appeals in parliament this week to
salvage his 17-month-old government at this crucial stage in its
march toward European Monetary Union.
<p>
   ``The goal is within reach,'' he repeated in his nationally
televised address before the Chamber of Deputies. He said
Refoundation's leader, Fausto Bertinotti, will bear the
responsibility if Italy fails in the goal.
<p>
   ``Naturally I have an opinion, but first I have to discuss it
with my party,'' Bertinotti told reporters after Prodi's speech.
<p>
   Refoundation, whose votes Prodi needs in the chamber, has said
it will vote against Prodi's 1998 budget unless he made concessions
on pensions, health care, job creation and a shorter work week.
<p>
   Prodi repeated an earlier concession that the government would
move toward a 35-hour work week, from 40 hours, and made a small
bow toward the Communists by assuring that the electrical group
ENEL would remain state-owned for a ``non-brief'' period of time.

BC-Australia-Indonesia-Bank Loss
Australia-Indonesia bank joint venture hit by currency crisis
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd.
(CBA) revealed Thursday it had lost ``several million'' of a US
dlrs 30 million (Australian dollars 40 million) equity stake in an
Indonesian banking joint venture because of Indonesia's currency
turmoil.
<p>
   The crisis in the Indonesian rupiah and stock market had also
forced a delay in release of new banking products to the Indonesian
commercial and retail markets, the bank said.
<p>
   The PT Bank BII Commonwealth, a 50-50 joint venture between the
CBA and the private bank Bank Internaisonal Indonesia, was granted
a banking license in June.
<p>
   Michael Katz, CBA's head of institutional banking, said Thursday
the currency crisis had meant there had been a ``translation loss''
on the equity which would amount to several million dollars.
<p>
   ``(But) The impact on us has been very minor,'' Katz said.
<p>
   President and managing director of PT Bank BII Commonwealth,
Bill Foxlee, defended the joint venture, saying it had plenty of
capital.
<p>
   He said June had been a ``very fortunate time'' for the CBA to
enter the Indonesian market.
<p>
   ``We don't have any assets that are not extremely solid. We have
plenty of capital in that we are very fortunate that we were the
last bank to open,'' Foxlee said.
<p>
   ``We can cherry pick the market, and the situation where we are
a new player with plenty of capital, we see opportunities. It's a
good, long-term, solid investment for the CBA.''
<p>
   Bank Internaisonal was one of the largest and most respected
groups in Indonesia, he said.
<p>
   ``The share price of the bank BII has of course come down but
has since recovered,'' he said.
<p>
   Indonesia asked the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
Wednesday to help it deal with a financial crisis that has slashed
the value of its currency, threatening economic and possibly social
stability.
<p>
   The rupiah is one of several Southeast Asian currencies to have
plunged in value this year. It has fallen more than 30 percent
against the U.S. dollar in about two months.
<p>
   It shed a dramatic 8.5 percent Friday and another 5 percent
Monday before Bank Indonesia, the central bank, intervened in
currency markets to prop it up.
<p>
   Foxlee said the slow down of the Indonesian economy had impacted
on all companies -- foreign and domestic -- operating in Indonesia.
<p>
   ``Quite clearly every bank has been impacted on by high interest
rates, the tightening of liquidity and the significant fall in the
rupiah,'' he said.
<p>
   But its Indonesian partner had been less affected than some by
the economic turmoil because it was involved in the paper export
industry which was paid in US currency, Katz said.

   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright noted
for politically oriented comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature
on Thursday. Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his
``strength in the creation of texts that simulataneously amuse,
engage and provide perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy. The prize
this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million). His most
popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo'' and ``Accidental
Death of an Anarchist.'' Fo has long been a major figure in drama,
but his winning the prestigious prize could be considered a
surprise choice; his name generally has not been included on
critics' lists of potential winners.
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
panel probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start with a former Mossad chief asking to quit, an
Israeli official said Thursday. Meanwhile, speculation mounted that
Danny Yatom, the current Mossad chief, would be forced to resign
from his job because of the spy agency's bungled assassination of a
Hamas leader in Amman on Sept. 25. Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad
head, will ask to resign from the three-member committee
investigating the Amman operation because he publicly expressed
support for it before being appointed, a senior official said on
condition of anonymity. The Mossad agents, traveling on forged
Canadian passports, were caught after injecting Mashaal with a
poison and later exchanged for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed
Yassin, and 20 other prisoners.
<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Former Cabinet Minister Maurice Papon
spent a second night in prison pending his trial for crimes against
humanity while serving France's pro-Nazi Vichy regime during World
War II. The court was to rule Thursday on Papon's request to be
released during his trial because he lacks the physical,
psychological and moral stamina to defend himself while in prison.
Papon, 87, is the most senior French official ever to stand trial
for his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews. A medical
panel was appointed to determine whether Papon could withstand
detention during the proceedings. Lawyers representing several
hundred victims' families, Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups
who have waited 16 years for the trial oppose Papon's request.
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  The Mir's crew opened the hatch of a newly arrived
cargo ship Thursday and began unloading perishable groceries and
equipment for biological experiments that need to be stored in the
space station's refrigerator. Russia's Progress M-36 cargo ship
successfully docked with Mir on Wednesday night, but space
officials decided to keep its hatches closed until the next
morning. Flight control chief Vladimir Solovyov said that docking
uses up a lot of the station's energy and space officials decided
to let solar batteries recharge during the night before letting the
crew proceed with unloading the cargo ship. The Progress M-36
brought some 2 1/2 tons of supplies and equipment, including a new
back-up computer, fuel, drinking water, and a new device designed
to fly around the Mir and examine its exterior.
<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
coast Thursday with high winds and towering seas as it skirted past
Acapulco, Mexico's most popular resort. The U.S. National Hurricane
Center reported near-hurricane force winds of 59 mph (94 kph) raked
Acapulco before dawn Thursday as the storm moved northward up the
coast toward the beach resorts of Zihuatenejo, Manzanillo and
Puerto Vallarta. Pauline has pummeled tourist hotels and fishing
villages near Huatulco, churning up 30-foot (9-meter) seas with 115
mph (185 kph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and ruined
residences. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. But
telephone communication to much of the coast was cut after Pauline
began pummeling the shore late Wednesday. Tourists huddled in
darkened hotels and hundreds of Mexican coastal dwellers sought
refuge in emergency shelters overnight. Pauline is one of several
strong eastern Pacific cyclones this year, including Nora, which
walloped the American Southwest as a tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for
the desert.

South Korea finds no more E. coli bacteria on imported beef
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  &MD;  South Korean quarantine officials
testing U.S. beef for possible contamination said Thursday they
have found no more E. coli bacteria in the imported meat.
<p>
   South Korea, a major importer of U.S. beef, expanded tests for
Nebraska and other American beef after its quarantine experts
detected E. coli bacteria in late September on the surface of
frozen and sliced beef imported from Nebraska.
<p>
   It ordered a local importer to destroy or return 18 tons of
Nebraska beef kept in warehouses, and the safety of U.S. meat has
since emerged as a major consumer concern.
<p>
   Officials so far have tested 56 meat samples, 25 of them taken
from Nebraska beef, and found no bacteria contamination, the Seoul
government's Food and Drug Administration said in a report released
Thursday.
<p>
   The administration said it was testing 200 other imported meat
samples. Most of the samples were collected from meat imported from
Nebraska, adjacent U.S. states and Australia and New Zealand.
<p>
   The case prompted the U.S. Department of Agriculture to send its
own experts to examine how South Korea detected the bacteria on the
U.S. meat. Nebraska meat packer IBP Inc., which shipped the
contaminated meat, has questioned the results of the South Korean
testing.
<p>
   ``The U.S. team was fully satisfied with the South Korean
testing procedures for E. coli,'' said a statement issued by the
U.S. Embassy shortly after the experts flew out of Seoul.
<p>
   The U.S. experts arrived Monday and met with South Korean
quarantine authorities.
<p>
   The testing results announced Thursday did not have an immediate
impact on consumers, local meat sellers said.
<p>
   ``It will take time for consumers to regain confidence. We
eliminated the U.S. beef section and do not plan to restore it
until after the government completes all the testing,'' said Koo
Jung-hoi, a spokesman for Seoul's Hyundai Department Store.
<p>
   The news of contaminated meat has caused a sudden drop in Korean
consumer confidence in U.S. meat and its sales have decreased.
<p>
   ``Since the news broke on Sept. 27, sales of imported beef have
dropped by 60 percent, compared to the same period last year,''
said Ha Soo-yeon, a spokeswoman for Lotte, Seoul's largest
department store.
<p>
   On Tuesday, IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said his company will
abide by both governments' findings.
<p>
   In the United States, E. coli is permitted on the outside of
beef because the microbes would be killed in cooking. If the
bacteria are in ground beef, however, they can get inside the
product and possibly escape the high heat necessary to destroy
them.
<p>
   South Korea says the bacteria cannot be allowed even on the
outside of meat in South Korea because it is common for Koreans to
eat raw beef.
<p>
   South Korean technical experts are scheduled to visit the United
States next week to examine quarantine procedures and discuss food
safety and the beef trade.
<p>
   U.S. beef accounted for 60 percent of South Korea's total beef
imports during the first eight months of this year, and Nebraska is
America's leading beef-producing state. Australia and New Zealand
are other major beef suppliers for the South Korean market.
<p>
   Nebraska exported roughly dlrs 48 million worth of beef to South
Korea last year, according to the Nebraska Cattlemen's Association.

Spectacular kidnapping case in Germany ends with discovery of body

<p>
   BERLIN (AP)  &MD;  A desperate search for a young man kidnapped
almost four weeks ago ended Thursday when police said they had
found his decomposed body in a hole in the woods north of Berlin.
<p>
   Authorities said 20-year-old Matthias Hintze apparently died
from starvation three weeks ago in the shaft, 4 meters (13-foot)
deep and barely wide enough to turn around in.
<p>
   One of two suspects arrested Tuesday confessed and led police to
the body Wednesday night, Prosecutor Hans-Dieter Bamler said in
Potsdam. The suspects, Russian men, face charges of murder and
kidnapping, he said.
<p>
   The case made headlines across Germany since Hintze disappeared
on Sept. 14 from his family's home in Geltow, just outside Potsdam.
Police presumed he walked in during a burglary and was taken
hostage, stuffed into the trunk of the family's Mercedes.
<p>
   He was last seen alive a few hours later a short distance from
the house. A witness said he saw a BMW rear-end a Mercedes so that
the trunk lid popped up. A man in the trunk cried for help and
tried to escape, but the drivers of both cars got out, forced him
back down and slammed the trunk shut. Both cars were later found
abandoned.
<p>
   The kidnappers demanded 1 million marks (dlrs 570,000) from the
parents, restaurant owners who police say are not rich.
<p>
   The parents appealed in newspapers and on national television
for the kidnappers to spare the life of their son, who had just
completed his military service.
<p>
   On Sept. 26 police released a photo of Hintze with a large black
eye staring up from a square hole in the ground. A letter from the
kidnappers said he was hungry and feverish and demanded the money
again.
<p>
   At least four attempts to deliver the money failed; police said
the parents had difficulty understanding the instructions given by
the kidnappers, who spoke broken German with a Russian accent.
<p>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of police searched throughout Berlin and the
surrounding state of Brandenburg.
<p>
   Two Russian men, ages 26 and 37, in a gold BMW with Russian
plates were stopped for questioning by a plain-clothes police
officer. Police said they behaved suspiciously and initially gave
false names.
<p>
   The two had police records in Germany, one for robbery and the
other for dealing in stolen autos.
<p>
   Hintze's body was found near Waren, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) north of Berlin. Police said there were no apparent injuries
and no signs that he had been given anything to eat.

   Here is a summary of late financial news from The Associated
Press. Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the
items below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  The Indonesian and Malaysian currencies
strengthened Wednesday on expectations of possible help by the
International Monetary Fund, while the Philippine central bank
spent heavily propping up the peso. Indonesian Finance Minister
Ma'rie Muhammad said his government has asked the IMF and World
Bank to help it overcome a financial crisis that has slashed the
value of its currency. Soon after the government's announcement
Wednesday, the rupiah was trading at 3,660 rupiah to the dollar,
marginally stronger than its Tuesday close of 3,690 rupiah. The
announcement also helped the stock market, with the Jakarta Stock
Exchange index ending 4.991 points, or 1 percent, higher at 518.940
on buying in telecommunication shares and on a rebound in banking
shares. Share prices elsewhere closed higher in Malaysia, the
Philippines, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Taiwan, Wellington and
Singapore and lower in Bangkok, Seoul. (ASIAN MARKETS)
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. energy company Enron Corp.
will join a US dlrs 500 million coal slurry pipeline project in
China, an Australian company involved in the plan said Thursday.
MRI Holdings, a small Australian company that has a stake in China
Pipeline Holdings, said in a statement it and other shareholders of
China Pipeline Holdings signed a shareholders' agreement with Enron
International China CP, a unit of the U.S. energy and pipeline
company. Enron will contribute expertise and experience in project
financing, pipeline construction and operation. The restructuring
of China Pipeline Holdings ``has the support of the relevant
authorities of the Chinese government,'' MRI said.

   OAK BROOK, Illinois (AP)  &MD;  McDonald's Corp. plans to invest dlrs
1 billion in Latin America during the next three years, including
almost doubling the number of restaurants to 2,000. In 1996, sales
in Latin America contributed 4 percent of McDonald's operating
income, and that amount is expected to increase this year, Ed
Sanchez, McDonald's International senior vice president, said
Wednesday. Sales for the more than 1,000 restaurants in 27
countries in the region are expected to reach dlrs 1.5 billion by
the end of this year, McDonald's said. The company said it employs
almost 75,000 people in Latin America. McDonald's, the world's
largest fast-food chain, opened its first Latin American restaurant
in 1967 in Puerto Rico. McDonald's is based in Oak Brook, Illinois.

<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd.
(CBA) revealed Thursday it had lost ``several million'' of a US
dlrs 30 million (Australian dollars 40 million) equity stake in an
Indonesian banking joint venture because of Indonesia's currency
turmoil. The crisis in the Indonesian rupiah and stock market had
also forced a delay in release of new banking products to the
Indonesian commercial and retail markets, the bank said. The PT
Bank BII Commonwealth, a 50-50 joint venture between the CBA and
the private bank Bank Internaisonal Indonesia, was granted a
banking license in June. Michael Katz, CBA's head of institutional
banking, said Thursday the currency crisis had meant there had been
a ``translation loss'' on the equity which would amount to several
million dollars. President and managing director of PT Bank BII
Commonwealth, Bill Foxlee, defended the joint venture, saying it
had plenty of capital. (AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA-BANK LOSS)

   BOMBAY, India (AP)  &MD;  Trading on India's National Stock Exchange
resumed Thursday after a four-day interruption due to a failing
communications satellite. The Bombay exchange shifted its
operations to the Insat 2A satellite, and opened trading at 9:30
a.m. Thursday. Trading was suspended for a few hours for
adjustments to Insat 2A in the early afternoon, but that
interruption had been expected. The stock exchange, India's
state-run television and the government's Department of
Telecommunication had all been affected by problems with another
satellite, the Insat 2D. That satellite was abandoned Sunday after
a break in the power supply caused it to lose its directional lock
on the earth. The stock exchange, where roughly 40 percent of
India's transactions are conducted, closed trading early Friday
after the satellite trouble first surfaced. (INDIA-STOCK EXCHANGE)

   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. power giant Enron plans to make
India the hub of its power and gas operations in Asia by investing
more than dlrs 5 billion, news reports said Thursday. Enron hopes
to complete the first phase of a plant near Bombay ahead of
schedule and also speed up establishing a larger second unit to
make the dlrs 1.2 billion project the largest private sector power
unit in India, the Pioneer newspaper reported. Enron has now set up
a 100 percent subsidary, Enron India Ltd., to handle its power, gas
supply and marketing projects. Enron's plans for expanding
investment in India come despite court troubles it has faced here.
Work on the plant near Bombay was stalled after Enron was accused
of securing the contract through bribes, charges of which the
company was cleared in court. (INDIA-ENRON)

Mystery car: police test paint, check 112,000 Fiats in search
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Police were checking thousands of Paris area Fiats
and testing paint scratches found on Diana's black Mercedes to
track down a mystery car that may have had a roll in the crash that
killed the princess.
<p>
   Since the end of last week, police have examined the records of
nearly all 112,000 Fiat Unos registered in the Paris area, dating
back to the first ones built in 1983, a police source said Thursday
on customary anonymity.
<p>
   Police lab technicians were trying to narrow the possibilities
by analyzing the paint chips to determine the year of the car that
may have sideswiped the speeding Mercedes, the source said.
<p>
   Investigators of the Aug. 31 crash that killed Diana, her
millionaire boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver were trying to
determine what, if any, role the Fiat may have played before the
Mercedes crashed into a pillar.
<p>
   The probe has also focused on photographers who pursued the
Mercedes, as well as the Mercedes' driver Henri Paul, who was
driving at a high rate of speed and was legally drunk at the time.
<p>
   Investigators were trying to determine whether the Mercedes
struck or was struck by the Fiat before veering into the pillar
inside the Pont de l'Alma tunnel along the river Seine.
<p>
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press last week that the second car theory was ``highly
favored.''
<p>
   The white paint scratches were found on the Mercedes' right
front end. The paint scratches were also on the Mercedes' right
rear-view mirror that was ripped away and found several dozen
meters (yards) away from where the Mercedes came to a halt.
<p>
   Police also found pieces of a taillight from a Fiat Uno at the
scene.
<p>
   About 100 witnesses have been questioned in the probe, including
the fourth and only surviving person in the Mercedes: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones.
<p>
   Rees-Jones, who suffered serious facial injuries, returned to
Britain last week after two interviews with investigators.
Suffering from amnesia, he told them he could remember nothing
about events immediately before the accident or the accident
itself.

<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his ``strength in
the creation of texts that simulataneously amuse, engage and
provide perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   His most popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo,
``Accidental Death of an Anarchist'' and ``Can't Pay, Won't Pay.''
<p>
   In 1980, Fo was refused an entry visa into the United States
because of his membership in an organization supporting prison
inmates.
<p>
   Fo married actress Franca Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a
drama company five years later.
<p>
   Fo has long been a major figure in drama, but his winning the
prestigious prize could be considered a surprise choice; his name
generally has not been included on critics' lists of potential
winners.
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on its deliberations, saying only
that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the prize,
which this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million).
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but is given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

Russian premier calls for greater cooperation among Commonwealth
states
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told
fellow premiers that closer cooperation was needed among the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition established
after the Soviet breakup.
<p>
   ``The picture we observe is not homogeneous at present,''
Chernomyrdin told a meeting of CIS heads of government in Bishkek,
Kyrgyzstan.
<p>
   ``This situation needs to be changed radically because
reciprocal trade turnover is the main criterion of close economic
relations,'' Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
<p>
   The CIS, which includes 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics,
was created as the Soviet Union dissolved at the end of 1991. It is
intended to preserve and develop ties between the republics, but
has achieved few practical results.
<p>
   Members countries are struggling economically and are reluctant
to relinquish any of their independence to an organization they
fear will be dominated by Moscow. The regular meetings produce a
stream of resolutions, most of which have never been implemented.
<p>
   Trade among member countries fell almost 10 percent in the first
half of this year in comparison with the same period in 1996,
Chernomyrdin noted at the conference. The CIS also has proved
ineffective in solving political and military conflicts in the
ex-Soviet republics.
<p>
   The prime ministers agreed to hold a CIS heads-of-state meeting
Oct. 23 in the Moldovan capital Kishinev to address about 20
issues, including border and customs controls, transport tariffs
and air defense.

Motoyama takes two-stroke first-round lead
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SANBU, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Japan's Yuko Motoyama shot a 5-under-par 67
Thursday and took a two-stroke first-round lead in the 80 million
yen (dlrs 661,000) Takara World Invitational.
<p>
   Sweden's Liselotte Neumann and Japan's Akane Ohshiro trailed at
69.
<p>
   Neumann matched Motoyama's six birdies, but shot three bogeys to
the leader's one.
<p>
   Ohshiro, seeking the sixth Japan LPGA tour title of her career,
caught up with Neumann with birdies on the last four holes. In all,
she had five birdies and two bogeys on the 6,238-yard, par-72
Caledonian Golf Club course.
<p>
   ``I will try to play hard without thinking too much of
victory,'' said the 30-year-old Motoyama, still winless in her
six-year pro career.
<p>
   Akiko Fukushima, who last week became the second Japanese woman
golfer to win three consecutive tournaments, shot a 76 and was tied
for 39th with Japan's Ayako Okamoto, a former U.S. LPGA tour
regular, and 13 other players, including American Jean Bartholomew.
Fukushima is seeking her sixth victory of the season.
<p>
   Britain's Laura Davies, winner of one tournament on the Europe
tour and two on the U.S. tour this season, shot a 75 and was tied
for 24th with Japan's Michiko Hattori, winner of the 1985 U.S.
Amateur championship, and 12 other golfers.
<p>
   A total of 108 golfers, including 25 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather.
<p>
   The winner receives 14.4 million yen (dlrs 119,000).

Southeast Asian currencies recover, stock markets close mixed
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Southeast Asian currencies rallied against the
U.S. dollar Thursday, but Asian stock markets closed mixed.
<p>
   The Philippine peso's climb was so steep, it hit a 4 percent
volatility limit that caused currency trading to be halted for the
day.
<p>
   Philippine stocks also closed sharply higher as declining
interest rates and the stronger peso propped up the market for a
second day, traders said.
<p>
   The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged 58.67
points, or 3 percent, and closed at 2,005.5, after gaining 26.2
points Wednesday.
<p>
   When currency trading was suspended at midafternoon, the peso
averaged 34.852 pesos per dollar, compared to its record low of
35.565 pesos on Wednesday.
<p>
   The peso, buoyed by central bank intervention and new rules to
wrest dollars from the market, reached the limit of a new
three-tier volatility band introduced early this week to reduce
wild exchange rate swings.
<p>
   President Fidel Ramos said Thursday he expects the country will
weather the currency storm by the end of the year.
<p>
   ``Investor confidence will return. Unlike other Asian countries,
we are not suffering from policy weakness. We do not have weak
fundamentals,'' Ramos told reporters.
<p>
   In Bangkok, the Thai baht rose slightly on mild corporate
dollar-selling ahead of the unveiling next week of government
measures to fix the country's financial system.
<p>
   At the close of trading, the dollar was at 36.55 baht in the
domestic spot market, down from 36.6 late Wednesday.
<p>
   Thai stock prices rose despite anxiety over massive
recapitalizations in Thailand's liquidity-starved banking sector.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index climbed 3.64 points to 528.25.
<p>
   In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian ringgit was significantly higher
against the dollar in late trading after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said he had a strategy to deal with the falling ringgit and
it wouldn't hurt anyone.
<p>
   But share prices tumbled as investors cashed in on Wednesday's
market surge. The Composite Index shed 11.66 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 824.94.
<p>
   At around 0848 GMT, the dollar was at 3.0770 ringgit, down
sharply from 3.1650 ringgit late Wednesday.
<p>
   Indonesia's rupiah maintained its gains against the dollar in
calm trading as the government's move to seek help from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank soothed the market.
The dollar was trading at 3,565 rupiah at 1025 GMT.
<p>
   The strengthening rupiah helped Jakarta share prices gain. The
Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 2.172 points to
521.112.
<p>
   In Hong Kong, share prices plunged in response to inflation
warnings by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The key
Hang Seng Index of blue chips fell 565.40 points, or 3.8 percent,
to 14,273.12, after rising 27.76 points Wednesday.
<p>
   The Fed chairman said an interest rate increase may be needed to
cool down the U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
finished 1 percent lower after Greenspan spoke Wednesday.
<p>
   Traders said investors used the weak U.S. stock market as an
excuse to push the home stock market lower.
<p>
   In Tokyo, stocks fell sharply as investors grew pessimistic
about chances for new government measures to boost the economy.
<p>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 242.26 points,
or 1.37 percent, closing at 17,376.92, after gaining 107.99
Wednesday.
<p>
   The dollar was changing hands at 121.18 yen in late afternoon,
down 1.08 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New
York level of 121.05 yen.
<p>
   Elsewhere in Asia:
<p>
   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose in quiet trading. The
NZSE-40 capital index added 5.18 points to 2,596.92.
<p>
   TAIPEI: Share prices rose as the Taiwan government's strong
showing of support for financial markets sparked buying across the
board. The Weighted Index surged 206.05 points to 8,461.87.
<p>
   SINGAPORE: Share prices fell in moderate trading, dragged down
by the overnight fall in stock prices in the United States and a
reaction to Singapore's August industrial production data. The
benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index fell 20.57 points to
1,861.46
<p>
   SEOUL: After fluctuating between positive and negative territory
throughout the day, share prices fell to a new 55-month low on
negative market sentiment. The Korean Composite Index lost 1.08
points to 609.36.
<p>
   SYDNEY: Australia share prices fell after Wall Street wilted
overnight and the case for a cut in local interest rates weakened
on the issue of domestic employment data. The All Ordinaries Index
lost 46.2 points to 2,722.2.

French foreign minister pledges cooperation with S. Africa

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine launched talks Thursday with South Africa on how the two
countries can cooperate under a new French policy for Africa.
<p>
   Vedrine met with Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo and signed
a memorandum to ensure the two countries conduct regular, close
political talks on diplomatic issues.
<p>
   They also signed an agreement pledging 17 million French francs
(dlrs 2.9 million) for South Africa's education system.
<p>
   ``These two agreements that we have just signed make concrete a
will on both sides to develop our relations,'' Vedrine told
journalists.
<p>
   He was expected to outline the new French African policy at an
afternoon briefing for members of Parliament. A key component of
the new policy is close relations with South Africa, which France
considers a continental economic and political power.
<p>
   France has traditionally been most active in her former African
colonies in West Africa. But post-apartheid South Africa, the
dominant nation of southern Africa, would provide a powerful and
useful ally for France under its revised strategy.
<p>
   Nzo said South Africa would seek to regularly exchange
information with France on international issues.
<p>
   ``The future of that relationship is not only consolidated, but
<p>
   improves all the time,'' he said Thursday.
<p>
   The one-day visit is Vedrine's first official trip to South
Africa since France elected a socialist government in June. He also
plans stops in Ethiopia, Gabon and Ivory Coast.
<p>
   He planned to brief African governments on the new policy, which
will see France retreat from the direct political and military
interference in its former colonies.
<p>
   Instead, France will focus on economic ties and development
across the whole of Africa and encourage multilateral solutions to
African problems.
<p>
   The policy change was announced in August by President Jacques
Chirac. About the same time, the French government announced plans
to cut its troops in Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and shut one of its
six military bases on the continent.
<p>
   Until the 1960s, France controlled about a third of the African
continent, and even after decolonization its military and political
presence dictated the balance of power in many nations.
<p>
   But the recent behavior of some of its African allies has been a
source of embarrassment. The Rwandan government, which Paris
supplied with weapons and other military assistance, launched a
genocide in 1994 that killed at least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus until it was ousted by Tutsi rebels.
<p>
   In May, anti-government rebels swept the former Zaire and forced
longtime French ally President Mobutu Sese Seko to flee.
<p>
   Also in May, French influence in the Republic of Congo was not
enough to prevent fighting prompted in part by the distribution of
oil revenues harvested by French companies.

Australian breaks butterfly mark
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Australian Michael Klim broke the
world 100-meter butterfly record at the Australian swimming
championships on Thursday.
<p>
   The 20-year-old clocked 52.15 seconds to better Russian Denis
Pankratov's previous world mark by 0.12 seconds. Pankratov set the
former world record of 52.27 to win gold at last year's Atlanta
Olympics.
<p>
   Klim's time at the Chandler Aquatic Center came after a
controversial false start when the finalists swam 65 meters before
being stopped by officials.
<p>
   They had to wait another 20 minutes before taking to the blocks
for a second time.
<p>
   Klim raised both arms in the air in triumph after establishing
the new mark.
<p>
   ``It's a dream really,'' said Klim, who is coached at the
Australian Institute of Sport by Russian Gennadi Touretski.
<p>
   ``After the false start, Gennadi was swearing at me in Russian
getting me fired up, saying this was the second round of a boxing
match, a heavyweight title, and you've got to get out there mate or
they'll punch you out.
<p>
   ``I think the false start was good psychologically for me
because I'm a tough swimmer. I proved it I guess.''
<p>
   Klim said his next target is the world 200-meter freestyle
record  &MD;  the longest standing mark in world men's swimming.
<p>
   ``I think that's the next reasonable swim for me,'' he said,
referring to Italian Giorgio Lamberti's time of 1 minute, 49.69
seconds set eight years ago.
<p>
   Klim says that record may come at January's world championships
in Perth, Western Australia.
<p>
   ``I want to be a world champion and until I've won a world
championship, I haven't accomplished my goals,'' he said.
<p>
   Last year, Klim went into the Atlanta Olympics ranked first in
the world for the 200-meter freestyle but did not qualify for the
final.

Eds: Leads throughout to ADD comment from critic
By JIM HEINTZ
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his ``strength in
the creation of texts that simulataneously amuse, engage and
provide perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   His most popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo,
``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The latter is based on the right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in
1969, which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers around a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who
possesses the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of
officialdom,'' the citation said.
<p>
   In 1980, Fo was refused an entry visa into the United States
because of his membership in an organization supporting prison
inmates.
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel,'' the
academy said.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher
said that Fo was a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.'' Fo married actress Franca
Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a drama company five years
later.
<p>
   Fo has long been a major figure in drama, but his winning the
prestigious prize could be considered a surprise choice; his name
generally has not been included on critics' lists of potential
winners.
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on its deliberations, saying only
that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the prize,
which this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million).
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but is given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Doctors who examined former Cabinet
minister Maurice Papon, on trial for crimes against humanity during
World War II, told the court Thursday that he should be held in a
hospital during the trial, not in prison.
<p>
   Papon, 87, told the court on the opening day of the trial
Wednesday that he could not withstand confinement in prison during
the proceedings, expected to last into December.
<p>
   The court was to debate the findings by the two doctors,
appointed by the court, and rule later Thursday on Papon's request
to be freed from prison.
<p>
   The doctors delivered their findings minutes after the second
day of proceedings opened.
<p>
   Papon is the most senior French official ever to stand trial for
his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews. He is charged
with crimes against humanity while serving France's pro-Nazi Vichy
regime during World War II.

Italian playwright wins the Nobel Prize for Literature
Eds: Leads throughout to ADD comment from critic
By JIM HEINTZ
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his ``strength in
the creation of texts that simultaneously amuse, engage and provide
perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   ``I am amazed,''' said Fo, when reached by the ANSA news agency.
<p>
   He said he learned of the prize while driving from Rome to
Milan, when another car drove near him holding up a sign ``Dario
has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   His most popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo,
``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The latter is based on the right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in
1969, which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers around a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who
possesses the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of
officialdom,'' the citation said.
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel,'' the
academy said.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher
said that Fo was a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.'' Fo married actress Franca
Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a drama company five years
later.
<p>
   Fo has long been a major figure in drama, but his winning the
prestigious prize could be considered a surprise choice; his name
generally has not been included on critics' lists of potential
winners.
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on its deliberations, saying only
that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the prize,
which this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million).
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but was given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

American Jobe shares first-round lead with Japan's Sugiyama
</PREAMBLE>

<p>
   NISHIKAMO, Japan (AP)  &MD;  American Brandt Jobe and Japan's Naoya
Sugiyama shot 4-under-par 68s Thursday and shared a one-stroke
first-round lead in the 110 million yen (dlrs 909,000) Tokai
Classic.
<p>
   Jobe, seeking his second victory on the Japan PGA tour, shot
five birdies and one bogey on the 7,050-yard, par-72 Miyoshi
Country Club's west course.
<p>
   Sugiyama, winless in his six-year pro career, had seven birdies,
including three in a row on Nos. 7-9, and three bogeys.
<p>
   Japanese veteran Tsuneyuki ``Tommy'' Nakajima shot a 69 and
stood second.
<p>
   Among eight golfers at 70 were American Tom Lehman, Singapore's
Samson Gimson, and Shigeki Maruyama, who won two of Japan's three
major golf tournaments this season.
<p>
   American Steve Jones, who won the U.S. Open last season,
suffered a two-stroke penalty for arriving late for his scheduled
11:46 a.m. start and was at 78.
<p>
   A total of 119 players, including 16 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather for the top prize of 19.8 million yen (dlrs 164,000).

Donkey detained after smuggling guns across border
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TIRANA, Albania (AP)  &MD;  Donkeys are the latest discovery for
Albanian gun- and drugrunners.
<p>
   Greek soldiers stopped a donkey carrying 28 Kalashnikov rifles,
22 kilos (48.5 pounds) of hashish and several hundred bullets just
after it crossed the border from Albania, the Albanian daily Gazeta
Shqiptare reported Thursday.
<p>
   The donkey was sent toward the border on Tuesday by residents of
Permet, a town near the border with Greece, some 130 kilometers (80
miles) southeast of Tirana.
<p>
   A group of men were waiting in Greece to unload the donkey, the
daily said. But Greek soldiers approached and, after an exchange of
gunfire in which noone was injured, held the donkey, confiscating
the guns, drugs and bullets, Gazeta Shqiptare said in a report from
Permet citing unidentified local sources.
<p>
   Permet police could not be reached by telephone from Tirana. But
a resident of the area, insisting on anonymity, told The Associated
Press by telephone that donkeys and mules recently have become a
favored means for smuggling across the border.
<p>
   Hundreds of thousands of guns were ransacked from state armories
last spring when Albania experienced a chaotic revolt in which
authority virtually collapsed, especially in the south.
<p>
   Selling the guns and running drugs is one of the main sources of
income in the impoverished country, where at least 50 percent of
the workforce is idle.
<p>
   On Thursday, police in the resort of Saranda, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) southwest of Tirana, found 72 anti-tank shells, 340
kilograms (750 pounds) of TNT explosive, 480 grenades and 118,000
bullets in an underground arms stash.
<p>
   Saranda police said the arsenal was likely connected to a gang
that attacked the local police station last Saturday with anti-tank
shells. Damage was heavy, but no injuries were caused, police
added.

Central Bank leaves key interest rates unchanged
Eds: UPDATES with more details, finance ministry statement
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates for the first time in over five years, calling it a
precautionary move against inflation.
<p>
   The Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase rates through Oct. 22, to 3.3 percent from 3.0 percent,
to preempt higher inflation and help damp growth in the M3 money
supply aggregate.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the move ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   Germany's discount rate has been at 2.5 percent and the Lombard
rate at 4.5 percent since April 1996, while the securities
repurchase rate has been fixed at 3.0 percent since August 1996.
<p>
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency
funds from the central banks and acts as an effective ceiling on
overnight rates. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank
refinancing.

Italian playwright Dario Fo wins Nobel Prize for Literature
Eds: Leads throughout to ADD number of plays in 6th graf, more Fo
comment in grafs 12-13.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his ``strength in
the creation of texts that simulataneously amuse, engage and
provide perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   ``I am amazed,''' said Fo, when reached by the ANSA news agency
while driving from Rome to Milan.
<p>
   He said he learned of the prize when another car drove near him
holding up a sign ``Dario has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   Among the most popular and noted of his more than 70 plays are
``Mistero Buffo, ``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of
an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The latter is based on the right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in
1969, which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers around a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who
possesses the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of
officialdom,'' the citation said.
<p>
   In 1980, Fo was refused an entry visa into the United States
because of his membership in an organization supporting prison
inmates.
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel,'' the
academy said.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher
said that Fo was a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.''
<p>
   Fo married actress Franca Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a
drama company five years later. He credited her as a major factor
in his prize-winning work.
<p>
   ``I'd like to think that the consistency of our discourse was
rewarded,'' he told ANSA. ``I realize that sometimes we've made
mistakes and we've been too euphoric and light.''
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on how it chooses winners, saying
only that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the
prize.
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but is given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

Prodi goes before legislature in bid to save government
EDs: LEADS with Communists rejecting Prodi's proposals; edits to
conform; vote expected after 1400 gmt
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP) - Premier Romano Prodi's government appeared headed
toward collapse Thursday after Communist hard-liners rejected his
appeal for a budget deal.
<p>
   A vote of confidence was expected later in the day.
<p>
   ``I will draw the necessary conclusions'' from the vote, Prodi
said, indicating he would offer his resignation if he loses.
<p>
   Prodi has made a series of appeals in parliament this week to
salvage his 17-month-old center-left government at this crucial
stage in its march toward European Monetary Union.
<p>
   ``The goal is within reach,'' he repeated in his nationally
televised address before the Chamber of Deputies. He said Communist
Refoundation's leader, Fausto Bertinotti, will bear the
responsibility if Italy fails in the goal.
<p>
   But Refoundation in a statement before the vote said it
expressed a ``negative judgment'' on Prodi's speech regarding the
budget and the government's economic policies in general.
<p>
   Refoundation, whose votes Prodi needs in the chamber, threatened
to vote against Prodi's 1998 budget unless he made concessions on
pensions, health care, job creation and a shorter work week.
<p>
   Prodi repeated an earlier concession that the government would
move toward a 35-hour work week, from 40 hours, and made a small
bow toward the Communists by assuring that the electrical group
ENEL would remain state-owned for a ``non-brief'' period of time.

Indonesian reform package ready within weeks: World Bank official
AP Photo JAK103
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  A reform package to revive Indonesia's
ailing financial system should be completed within ``weeks, not
months,'' the director of the World Bank's office in Indonesia said
Thursday.
<p>
   The International Monetary Fund will coordinate with the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Indonesian government to
decide on the type of package required to stabilize the economy,
which has been ravaged by a more than 30 percent depreciation of
the rupiah since August, director Dennis de Tray said.
<p>
   The Indonesian government announced Wednesday it had asked the
IMF and the World Bank for help.
<p>
   Members of a rescue team were to start arriving in Jakarta on
Friday.
<p>
   De Tray said the joint mission would focus on reforming the
financial system. It would try to revive a money market system that
has become virtually ``stagnant'' in recent weeks as liquidity has
dried up and interest rates have skyrocketed.
<p>
   De Tray said a large part of this process would involve
determining the level of existing private-sector debt in Indonesia
as well as the amount that has not been hedged.
<p>
   The strength of corporations involved would also be examined.
<p>
   ``It's the ability of these corporates to repay that's really
important,'' de Tray said.
<p>
   Bank Indonesia, the central bank, has calculated private sector
debt at dlrs 55 billion. Of this, the Bank of International
Settlements in Geneva says, dlrs 34 billion comes due within 12
months.
<p>
   The amount of private debt  &MD;  as well as the current liquidity
crisis  &MD;  will lead the international team to closely monitor the
banking system, de Tray said.
<p>
   He didn't forecast the amount of funds that might be injected,
but said a portion would be used to stabilize the banking system.
<p>
   ``A number of (banks) will be closed, or merged, and this will
take resources,'' de Tray said.
<p>
   He said that without long-term loans from the IMF, Asian
Development Bank or World Bank, Indonesia would have to print more
money to address the banking problems, which is inflationary and
puts more pressure on the economy.

Central Bank raises interest rate to preempt inflation
Eds: UPDATES with market reax, explanation of repo rate
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates for the first time in over five years, calling it a
precautionary move against inflation.
<p>
   The Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase (repo) rates through Oct. 22, to 3.3 percent from 3.0
percent, to preempt higher inflation and help dampen growth in the
money supply.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the moves ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   The dollar fell around one pfennig immediately after the
announcement, to 1.7415 marks. But dealers said the currency
market's reaction was relatively muted as the rate hike had been
expected.
<p>
   Germany's discount rate has been at 2.5 percent and the Lombard
rate at 4.5 percent since April 1996, while the securities
repurchase rate has been fixed at 3.0 percent since August 1996.
<p>
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency
funds from the central banks and acts as an effective ceiling on
overnight rates. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank
refinancing.
<p>
   The repo rate, or interest on short-term securities
transactions, is the bank's main instrument for influencing the
money market.

<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Doctors who examined Maurice Papon,
charged with World War II crimes against humanity, advised the
court on the second day of trial Thursday that he be held in a
hospital, not in prison, during the proceedings.
<p>
   Presiding Judge Jean-Louis Castagnede said a decision on whether
to keep the aging former Cabinet minister in prison would be
announced on Friday.
<p>
   Papon, 87, told the court on the opening day of the trial
Wednesday that he could not withstand confinement in prison during
the proceedings, expected to last into December.
<p>
   On Thursday, state prosecutor Henri Desclaux read the
conclusions of the court-appointed medical team charged with
examining Papon.
<p>
   Detention is not incompatible with Papon's state of health, but
``given his heart conditions, the risks would be reduced if he were
placed under surveillance in a cardiology unit,'' Desclaux told the
court, reading the medical expertise.
<p>
   Papon has been held at Gradignan Prison since Tuesday night. He
underwent triple bypass heart surgery last year and is on
medication.
<p>
   Papon is the most senior French official ever to stand trial for
his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews. He is charged
with crimes against humanity while serving France's pro-Nazi Vichy
regime during World War II.

Tories say Blair seeking to bounce Britain into single currency
With AP Photo
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BLACKPOOL, England (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Tony Blair is seeking
to railroad Britain into adopting a single European currency, the
treasury spokesman of the opposition Conservative Party said
Thursday.
<p>
   Peter Lilley, addressing the party's annual conference, also
said the Conservatives were trounced by Blair's Labor Party in the
May 1 national elections because of a series of economic blunders.
<p>
   Earlier, delegates gave a standing ovation to former prime
minister Margaret Thatcher, a standard-bearer of opposition to a
single European currency.
<p>
   Since being ousted in a party revolt in 1990 partly because of
her prickly relations with the rest of the European Union, she
traditionally comes to the four-day conference to hear one debate.
<p>
   In a blow from which its political credibility never recovered,
the Conservative government was forced in September 1992 to
withdraw the pound from the exchange rate mechanism linking major
European currencies.
<p>
   ``We've all met countless people whose confidence in us was
shattered by events like the recession, the tax rises and the ERM
debacle,'' Lilley told delegates.
<p>
   Another big problem was party divisions over the single European
currency, with so-called Euroskeptics, including Lilley, fiercely
opposed to Britain abandoning the pound.
<p>
   However, at Blackpool, William Hague, the new Tory leader, has
plastered over the splits by saying the Conservatives will oppose
Britain adopting the new currency, the euro, for the ``foreseeable
future.'' Previously, Hague ruled it out for 10 years.
<p>
   The euro is scheduled to start Jan. 1, 1999, with Germany and
France among the first nations to adopt it.
<p>
   ``The government is clearly thinking how to bounce this country
into the single currency,'' Lilley said. ``Gordon Brown ... would
rather hand power over to 14 foreign bankers than leave it with 400
Labor members of Parliament.''
<p>
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown, the treasury chief, is widely
regarded as an enthusiast for the single currency.
<p>
   Lilley argued that this is because, if the economy falters,
Brown wants to duck blame by handing over key economic decisions to
a European central bank.
<p>
   Blair says it is highly unlikely Britain will adopt the currency
in January 1999, and has promised a referendum if his government
decides to join later.
<p>
   However, The Financial Times reported two weeks ago that Labor
is shifting toward joining. That raised speculation of a referendum
before the next election, which must be held by 2002.
<p>
   ``Let's see it (the euro) survive a recession,'' Lilley said.
``Let's see whether it will actually involve centralizing taxation
and redistributing incomes between countries as some people claim.
That is the sensible approach.''
<p>
   Reflecting Hague's compromise with Tory pro-Europeans, Lilley
said that while many lawmakers in all parties oppose abandoning the
pound, ``others  &MD;  including good Conservatives  &MD;  believe it may
well be in Britain's interests at some stage.''
<p>
   ``But that isn't the issue,'' he said. ``The question in any
referendum will not be `Do you want to stay out forever?' but `Do
you want to opt in forever?' '
<p>
   Lilley urged the Tories to learn from defeat.
<p>
   ``We must re-establish ourselves as a party which keeps taxes
down. And we must be extremely cautious about embarking on any
future European monetary adventures,'' he said.
<p>
   The party's Euroskeptic wing believes that if Blair calls a
referendum on the euro, the Tories will have a good chance of
regaining power by leading a ``vote no'' campaign.

Excerpts from Nobel Literature Prize citation
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Excerpts from the Swedish Academy's
citation awarding the Nobel Literature Prize to Italian playwright
Dario Fo:
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Fo ``emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging
authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``For many years, Fo has been performed all over the world,
prhaps more than any other contemporary dramatist, and his
influence has been considerable. He, if anyone, merits the epithet
of jester in the true meaning of that word. With a blend of
laughter and gravity he opens our eyes to abuses and injustices in
society and also the wider historical perspective in which they can
be placed.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel while at
the same time experiencing enormous response from widely differing
quarters.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``Fo's strength is in the creation of texts that simultaneously
amuse, engage and provide perspectives. As in commedia dell'arte,
they are always open for creative additions and dislocations,
continually encouraging the actors to improvise, which means that
the audience is activated in a remarkable way.''

Russia opens investigation into helicopter attack, Turkey denies
incident
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia said Thursday it was investigating an
incident in which one of its military helicopters came under fire
from Turkish territory, but Turkish officials denied that the
incident ever took place.
<p>
   Russian officials have said that the border guards' Mi-8
helicopter was seriously damaged when it came under rifle fire
shortly after take off Wednesday in southwestern Georgia, near the
border with Turkey.
<p>
   Russia's Federal Border Service dispatched a task force to the
area Thursday to investigate the attack, the ITAR-Tass reported.
<p>
   Russian officials said the gunfire came from the Turkish side of
the border, but they have not accused any group of being behind the
attack.
<p>
   In Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said the
shooting never happened.
<p>
   ``We have made our own investigation,'' Akbel told the
Associated Press.
<p>
   Russian border guards said the helicopter was hit eight times,
including twice in the fuel tank, but nobody was injured.
<p>
   The helicopter had flown down from the Russian city of Adler to
evacuate a sick border guard from a post in Batumi, a Black Sea
port in southwestern Georgia, and had one medic aboard, ITAR-Tass
reported.
<p>
   Russian troops help guard the borders in Georgia, a former
Soviet republic. Russian peacekeepers also are deployed in the
separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia.

Jews prepare for holy day by swinging chickens
By MELISSA McCORD
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Swinging live chickens over their heads to cast
away sins in a symbolic gesture, Jews prepared Thursday for Yom
Kippur, or the Day of Atonement.
<p>
   The ritual is practiced by devout Jews ahead of Yom Kippur, the
holiest day on the Jewish calendar marked by fasting and prayer.
Yom Kippur begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown Saturday.
<p>
   In Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, men in
thin plastic aprons sold squawking chickens from hundreds of
colored crates stacked in the streets.
<p>
   Men with long black coats, black hats, beards and side locks
rocked back and forth as they recited blessings.
<p>
   ``On Yom Kippur, you're supposed to dispose of your sins,'' said
one man, who only gave his first name, Eli, as he swung his chicken
above his head.
<p>
   His wife Huvy scolded him for holding the chicken by the wings.
``You're supposed to hold it here,'' she said, pointing to the
bird's legs, which were bound with string.
<p>
   After the blessing the chickens were slaughtered with a
razor-sharp knife. Men in rubber boots hosed down the narrow street
to get rid of the blood and feathers.
<p>
   Most Jews give the birds to a charity which distributes them to
the poor, although some opt to keep the chicken and donate money
instead.
<p>
   The ritual, known as ``kapparot,'' or sacrifice of atonement,
has been practiced since the Middle Ages.
<p>
   ``We all would be ready to give away our lives because we are
very sorry for things we didn't do well,'' said one woman, sitting
on an empty crate as she waited for her chicken to be swung.
<p>
   ``God doesn't want us to give away our life, so when we kill the
chicken it should be for all our sins.''
<p>
   Bands of small children crowded around the crates, staring at
the chickens. One woman, Rivka, wearing a long purple dress and a
white head scarf, brought her 3-year-old son, Shalom, whose big
blue eyes were transfixed by the birds. ``He rarely sees live
animals,'' she said.
<p>
   The Ten Days of Penitence begin at the Jewish New Year and
culminate in Yom Kippur, when Jews abstain from food, drink and
work.

URGENT
Mossad panel member resigns, speculation Mossad boss to quit
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
committee probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start Thursday when a former Mossad chief resigned from
the panel.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad chief, would be forced to resign from his job because of the
spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in Amman on
Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, quit the three-member
committee investigating the Amman operation because he publicly
expressed support for it before being appointed.
<p>
   The announcement was made by the Government Press Office, which
said Admoni would be replaced by retired army Maj. Gen. Dan
Tolchovsky.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni had initially been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Mossad director Yatom to give the
interviews supporting the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the
Hamas political bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.

Hun Sen says ousted co-premier should be barred from U.S.
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Cambodian leader Hun Sen said
Thursday that Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-prime minister he
ousted, should be barred from entering the United States because of
proven ties to the outlawed Khmer Rouge.
<p>
   ``Ranariddh ... negotiated and signed agreements with the Khmer
Rouge,'' Hun Sen said upon his return from New York, where he
lobbied unsuccessfully to reverse a U.N. decision to leave
Cambodia's seat vacant. ``We have the evidence to support this.''
<p>
   Hun Sen, accompanied by newly appointed co-premier Ung Huot,
said he learned while on the airplane returning to Phnom Penh that
a bill had been introduced in the U.S. Congress to deny visas to
anyone with links to the Khmer Rouge.
<p>
   Hun Sen, who ousted his co-premier in a July 5-6 coup, has
accused Ranariddh of illegally importing weapons into Cambodia and
of holding peace negotiations with hard-line Khmer Rouge guerrillas
in the months before he was deposed.
<p>
   ``We have those documents,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``The U.S.
should review thoroughly Ranariddh's engagement with the Khmer
Rouge.''
<p>
   As many as 2 million Cambodians died under the Khmer Rouge's
1975-79 rule. Die-hard guerrillas are still fighting the government
in the country's northern provinces.
<p>
   Before he was deposed, Ranariddh had reportedly signed a peace
pact with Khmer Rouge hard-liners, the last remaining faction after
the movement fragmented in 1996 to seek peace with the government.
<p>
   Under the proposal, the hard-liners' notorious leader, Pol Pot,
was to be turned over and others in the movement allowed to defect
to the government.
<p>
   Hun Sen rapidly consolidated power after the takeover, but has
failed to win international acceptance, partly because he shattered
a coalition put in place in 1993 after U.N.-brokered elections.
<p>
   Sounding upbeat, however, Hun Sen said several things were
accomplished during his two-week trip abroad.
<p>
   He said he had received support ``from some countries'' for his
suggestion that Ranariddh face trial and then seek amnesty from
King Norodom Sihanouk, his father, before being allowed to
participate in next year's elections.
<p>
   Hun Sen also said he had asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to instruct his representative in Cambodia to help Ranariddh's
loyalists who fled the country to return before the polls.
<p>
   ``We have given the ball to the U.N. to kick,'' he said. ``They
don't have any more pretext to refuse to come home.''
<p>
   Ranariddh has been seeking international support to return to
office since the takeover. His followers are waging armed
resistance against Hun Sen's troops from near the border with
Thailand.

Excerpts from Nobel Literature Prize citation
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Excerpts from the Swedish Academy's
citation awarding the Nobel Literature Prize to Italian playwright
Dario Fo:
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Fo ``emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging
authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``For many years, Fo has been performed all over the world,
perhaps more than any other contemporary dramatist, and his
influence has been considerable. He, if anyone, merits the epithet
of jester in the true meaning of that word. With a blend of
laughter and gravity he opens our eyes to abuses and injustices in
society and also the wider historical perspective in which they can
be placed.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel while at
the same time experiencing enormous response from widely differing
quarters.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   ``Fo's strength is in the creation of texts that simultaneously
amuse, engage and provide perspectives. As in commedia dell'arte,
they are always open for creative additions and dislocations,
continually encouraging the actors to improvise, which means that
the audience is activated in a remarkable way.''

Crashed helicopter found in haze-covered waters in Indonesia
Eds: UPDATES with survivor, crashed helicopter found
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  One person was rescued and three
others were missing Thursday when searchers found the wreckage of a
police helicopter that crashed in haze-shrouded waters east of
Sumatra Island, the official Antara news agency reported.
<p>
   The wreckage was found in the Bangka Strait, east of the city of
Palembang, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
<p>
   Brig. Gen. Deddi Ganrijadi, the South Sumatra district police
chief, said the helicopter's mechanic survived, but there was no
sign of the pilot, the co-pilot or a passenger.
<p>
   Ganrijadi said low visibility from haze was hampering the search
for the missing men.
<p>
   The helicopter crashed Wednesday on a 250-kilometer (155-mile)
flight from Batam to Palembang. Radio contact was lost about
halfway through the flight.
<p>
   The search area has been shrouded for weeks by thick haze from
hundreds of forest and scrub fires. Bad visibility has forced
several airports to cease operations.
<p>
   On Sept. 26, a Garuda Airlines Airbus A300-B4 crashed near the
city of Medan, also on Sumatra, as it descended into the haze on
its approach for landing. All 234 aboard were killed.
<p>
   The cause of the crash, Indonesia's worst, has not been
established. Searchers have yet to find the wrecked plane's black
box flight data and voice recorders.
<p>
   The haze has been blamed for a series of ship collisions. The
most serious accident claimed 29 lives.

Israel plans to release tax money to Palestinians
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A Palestinian official said Thursday Israel has
agreed to release all the remaining tax revenues withheld after a
suicide bombing in July, but Israeli officials said a final
decision has not yet been taken.
<p>
   ``We were informed officially of the decision to release the
money which is estimated to be about 170 million shekels (dlrs 49
million) as soon as possible,'' said Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath, after a meeting with Finance Minister Director-General
Shmuel Slavin.
<p>
   However, Israeli officials said the money has not been released
yet and would not be handed over to the Palestinians until next
week even if the remaining details could be worked out.
<p>
   ``We are discussing unfreezing money. There is no official
decision yet,'' said Moshe Fogel, the Israeli government spokesman.
<p>
   He said, however, that there was an improved atmosphere after
Wednesday's meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first in eight months.
<p>
   According to the Oslo peace agreement, Israel is obligated to
hand over customs duties and other taxes levied on Palestinian
imports and purchases.
<p>
   Netanyahu cut off the flow of tax revenue to the Palestinian
Authority after two Islamic suicide bombers killed 16 shoppers and
the bombers at a Jerusalem market on July 30. He released some of
the funds earlier under U.S. pressure.
<p>
   The United States criticized Netanyahu for withholding the
funds. American officials said the cut-off did not help Israel's
security and merely weakened the Palestinian Authority.
<p>
   Israel will also announce that it will allow Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to land at the new airfield at Dahaniye in the Gaza
Strip, Israel radio said.
<p>
   However, the Israelis have not yet agreed to allow the
Palestinians to open the new airport to international flights.
<p>
   A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and the speaker of the Palestinian
legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, are negotiating the question of
Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
<p>
   The withdrawals were promised by Israel in peace accords, but
after two recent bombings in Jerusalem Netanyahu suspended any
further pullbacks until Israel's security demands were met.
<p>
   Fogel said Israel's decision stands but left open the
possibility of flexibility in the future, noting Palestinian
security cooperation had improved.
<p>
   Israel radio said Israel is also prepared to discuss a temporary
suspension of a controversial Jewish housing project in east
Jerusalem in return for Palestinian acquiescence in the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
<p>
   Israel would promise that the construction would be close to the
existing settlements. They would not be new neighborhoods on
distant hills which the Palestinians regard as new settlements in
all but name.
<p>
   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the report was
``sheer nonsense.'' He the two sides were discussing a definition
of the American call for a ``time-out'' in Jewish settlement
building.
<p>
   Netanyahu said withholding the funds and other measures imposed
were aimed at forcing Arafat to clamp down on the militants of the
Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups.
<p>
   In a move certain to anger Netanyahu, Arafat released from
prison a prominent member of Hamas, Mohammed Taha, the radio said.

Mossad panel member resigns, speculation Mossad boss to quit
Eds: LEADS with seven grafs with Mossad chief resigning.

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
committee probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start Thursday when a former Mossad chief resigned from
the panel.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad director, would be forced to resign from his job because of
the spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in the
Jordanian capital of Amman on Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, quit the three-member
committee investigating the Amman operation because he publicly
expressed support for it before being appointed.
<p>
   The announcement was made by the Government Press Office, which
said Admoni would be replaced by retired army Maj. Gen. Dan
Tolchovsky.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni initially had been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Yatom to give the interviews supporting
the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the Hamas political
bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.

Court throws out appeal against children's deportation
Eds: UPDATES with official's comment, grafs 10-11
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  The government won a victory for its
immigration law Thursday when a court threw out an appeal against
the deportation of China-born children of Hong Kong residents.
<p>
   The suit was brought on behalf of four girls aged 7 to 10, along
with a 19-year-old man. They are among thousands, mostly children
of cross-border marriages, who have entered Hong Kong illegally but
claim residence because one of their parents has Hong Kong papers.
<p>
   The Basic Law, the constitution China wrote for Hong Kong,
grants them residency. But as soon as Britain handed Hong Kong back
to China on July 1, the legislature passed a law entitling the
government to expel immigrants who were not part of the quota
agreed between China and Hong Kong.
<p>
   The government feared an unmanageable influx of up to 75,000
child immigrants once the Basic Law took effect. Under the terms of
the sovereignty change, the border stays in place and the Hong Kong
government maintains its own immigration controls.
<p>
   Lawyers argued that the new law was unconstitutional. They also
said it was flawed by being retroactive, since it empowered the
government to deport children who arrived before the legislation
was passed.
<p>
   But the Court of First Instance ruled that the government had
not violated the Basic Law, and upheld the retroactive status of
the legislation.
<p>
   It held that the children broke the rules because they entered
without a Chinese exit visa.
<p>
   ``We are very disappointed because these children will face
deportation immediately,'' said Diana Pang of the Society of
Community Organizations, an advocacy group that supported the
lawsuit.
<p>
   She said the ruling would be appealed.
<p>
   Peter Lai, secretary for security, said the government had no
immediate plan to deport the 1,000 children affected by the ruling.
<p>
   ``Given the fact that it is not certain all the legal progresses
have been completed and we cannot rule out the possibility of
appeal, so for the time being we are not taking any immediate
action of repatriation,'' said Lai.
<p>
   Spouses and children of Hong Kong residents have to wait years
for Chinese exit visas, and maintain that the system is corrupted
by bribery.

Mickelson falls two down after first 18 holes
Eds: WILL update about 1800 GMT after 36 holes
By STEPHEN WADE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP)  &MD;  American Phil Mickelson, knocked
out last year in the first round of the World Match Play
Championship, might go that way again.
<p>
   Mickelson was two holes down to New Zealand's Frank Nobilo after
the first 18 of 36 holes Thursday on a soggy, long-playing West
Course at Wentworth just outside London.
<p>
   In the other three first-round matches, Ian Woosnam of Wales was
1 up on Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, American Brad Faxon was 1 up on
Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland, and Vijay Singh of Fiji had a
three hole lead on Japan's Tsukasa Watanabe.
<p>
   Mickelson was four holes down as Nobilo fired birdies on six of
the first 13, but picked up two holes when Nobilo bogeyed the par-4
15th and had a double-bogey on the par-5 17th.
<p>
   ``I feel I have played horrible golf for the first 18 holes,''
said Mickelson who, along with Faxon, played on the losing U.S.
Ryder Cup team two weeks ago in Spain.
<p>
   ``He (Nobilo) only had two bad shots. He must wonder why he's
not further ahead.''
<p>
   Mickelson, who expected to be seeded among the top four here by
virtue of his No. 10 world ranking, instead was left unseeded and
forced to play the first round. First round survivors face the four
seeded players in Friday's quarterfinals.
<p>
   The final seed went instead to Steve Elkington of Australia,
ranked No. 13 in the world. Organizer Mark McCormack said that was
because the Australian won the Players' Championship in Florida in
March.
<p>
   Defending champion and defending U.S Open winner Ernie Els, Nick
Price and Colin Montgomerie got the other three seeds. Els faces
the Parnevik-Woosnam winner, Montgomerie gets either Clarke or
Faxon, Price will face Nobilo or Mickelson and Elkington faces the
winner of Singh-Watanabe.
<p>
   McCormack said the absence of the winners of the three other
majors (Tiger Woods, Davis Love and Justin Leonard declined
invitations) led him to seed Elkington since because the TPC is
regarded as the ``fifth major.''
<p>
   Mickelson suggested that Elkington received favorable treatment
because he is a client of McCormack's International Management
Group.
<p>
   In the Parnevik-Woosnam match  &MD;  pitting Ryder Cup teammates  &MD; 
Parnevik was 2 up after 10 on the strength of a 45-foot (14 meter)
birdie putt on the ninth and a short birdie putt on the 10th. But
Woosnam picked up birdies on 11, 13 and 16 to take the lead.
<p>
   Faxon was 2 up after 16 with back-to-back birdies, but lost a
hole on the par-5 17th when Clarke reached the green in two and got
down in two from 70 feet (22 meters).
<p>
   Singh fired a 69 with five birdies and never trailed the
Japanese Watanabe, who shot a level-par 72,

Italian playwright Dario Fo wins Nobel Prize for Literature
Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on being banned from the
United States;EDITS to conform.
By JIM HEINTZ
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, an Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited for his ``strength in
the creation of texts that simultaneously amuse, engage and provide
perspectives'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   ``I am amazed,''' said Fo, when reached by the ANSA news agency
while driving from Rome to Milan.
<p>
   He said he learned of the prize when another car drove near him
holding up a sign ``Dario has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   Among the most popular and noted of his more than 70 plays are
``Mistero Buffo, ``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of
an Anarchist.''
<p>
   In 1980, Fo and his wife were refused entry visas into the
United States because of his support for left-wing activities in
Italy. In 1984, the U.S. government relented and allowed the couple
to visit New York briefly and see the New York production of
``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The play is based on right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in 1969,
which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers on a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who possesses
the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of officialdom,'' the
citation said.
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel,'' the
academy said.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher
said that Fo was a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.''
<p>
   Fo married actress Franca Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a
drama company five years later. He credited her as a major factor
in his prize-winning work.
<p>
   ``I'd like to think that the consistency of our discourse was
rewarded,'' he told ANSA. ``I realize that sometimes we've made
mistakes and we've been too euphoric and light.''

   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on how it chooses winners, saying
only that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the
prize.
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but was given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

BC-Council of Europe Summit
European presidents and PMs grapple with human rights, stability
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Presidents and prime ministers from 40
European nations grapple with a new Europe Friday, trying to come
to terms with issues such as human rights and stability in the
continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit, with new members such as
Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, want to reassert the organization's
basic values of promoting democracy, human rights, human dignity
and the rule of law at a time when those ideals remain fragile in a
number of countries.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, for his part, says he wants to
convince fellow leaders to try to lessen Washington's influence on
the continent.
<p>
   ``We do not want the United States to be involved in Europe the
way it is now,'' Yeltsin said recently. ``We want a multipolar
world in which no country tells the others what to do.''
<p>
   Though this is the official Russian line, the reality is Moscow
remains preoccupied with domestic problems and foreign policy
clearly is a secondary concern. It has accepted the inevitability
of NATO's enlargement, and after an initial burst of opposition,
rarely is a word heard on the subject these days.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Moscow's full integration into democratic
Europe.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, But
that doesn't mean it won't try to exert its influence.
<p>
   Council officials said last month the Americans had quietly
circulated an unofficial paper criticizing Croatia's failure to
ensure press freedom and civil liberties. It proposed suspending
Croatia from the Council until it improves its human rights record.
<p>
   The Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   Observing the action from the sidelines will be John Shattuck,
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy and human
rights.
<p>
   Major aims of the summit will be to create a single, permanent
European Court of Human Rights by 1998, available to more than 800
million Europeans; to take action against corruption, money
laundering and organized crime; to ban cloning of human beings; and
to fight racism and intolerance.
<p>
   ``We expect it to be a manifestation of European Unity,'' said
Daniel Tarschys, the Council's secretary-general. At a time when
the European Union and NATO are enlarging, some countries are being
left out. The Council, he said, ``tries to work for a Europe where
everyone feels included.
<p>
   The existing system for implementing the European Human Rights
Convention is a two-tiered setup that first involves a European
Human Rights Commission that decides if a case is admissible, then
tries to settle it through friendly negotiations. Failing that, it
goes to the Court of Human rights.
<p>
   That was fine with a dozen member states, but has become
unwieldy with 40, often taking five years or more to deal with a
case. The Council wants to streamline that, making the process more
efficient and accessible.
<p>
   Another proposal would set up a corruption-prevention body as a
focal point for cooperation on corruption, organized crime and
money laundering.
<p>
   The Council of Europe, created in 1949 and with a current budget
of 153 million European currency units (dlrs 171 million), has a
reputation as something of a talk shop lacking real political
punch, a framer of ringing declarations backed by little
discernible action.
<p>
   Asked how Europe would be a better place after the summit,
Tarschys said even if the people of Europe ``don't wake up the next
morning flabbergasted by what we've done,'' it would serve as an
impetus for action.
<p>
   ``The ringing declaration at the end will be a signal to us to
get to work,'' he said.

Round the world sailor Chay Blyth receives knighthood
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Chay Blyth, the first person to sail around the
world from east to west, was knighted Thursday at Buckingham Palace
by Princess Anne, who was filling in for her mother, Queen
Elizabeth II.
<p>
   The 57-year-old son of a Scottish railway worker will now be
called ``Sir Chay.''
<p>
   When he set out on his first great adventure, rowing with fellow
paratrooper John Ridgeway from the United States to Ireland in
1966, Blyth had never sailed more than six miles (10 kms).
<p>
   Four years later, he began his solo non-stop trip around the
world in the 59-foot yacht British Steel. He returned to Britain on
Aug. 6, 1971 after 292 days at sea.
<p>
   He said it was fantastic that the princess had knighted him  &MD; 
tapping him on the shoulder with a sword  &MD;  because ``she is a great
sailing fan and she is always encouraging other people.''
<p>
   Anne was filling in for her mother, who is visiting Pakistan, It
was the second investiture she has conducted.
<p>
   Blyth flew back to London late Wednesday from Tenerife in the
Canary Islands, where he is organizing a trans-Atlantic rowing race
which starts on Sunday.
<p>
   ``The princess knew about this and joked that I was cutting it
fine,'' he said minutes after the ceremony.
<p>
   ``It's extraordinary if you think that I have come from such a
working class background,'' Blyth said. ``When people see that I
have been knighted, and I am an ordinary guy, perhaps they may
think there is a chance for them too.''

NATO parliament head calls for extended NATO presence in Bosnia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  The head of the North Atlantic
Assembly on Thursday urged NATO to stay in Bosnia past June, when
its mandate to help keep the peace expires.
<p>
   Assembly secretary-general Simon Lunn invoked the ``lessons of
the past'' as he called for a continued NATO presence at the first
meeting of NATO's parliamentary arm in a former Soviet bloc
country.
<p>
   Although there is developing consensus on the need to keep NATO
troops in Bosnia past June among member nations, the United States
is reluctant to commit soldiers past then and the Europeans are
unenthusiastic about staying if American troops don't.
<p>
   Romania was not among the former Soviet Bloc countries invited
to join NATO this summer but is keen to play an active role in NATO
events in hopes that will increase future chances of membership.
<p>
   Among agenda items are the costs of NATO expansion and other
economic problems, security in the Balkans and the situation in
Bosnia. Special talks will focus on NATO relations with Moscow.
<p>
   The assembly has no direct power but can draw up recommendations
to the North Atlantic Council  &MD;  NATO's top decision-making body.
<p>
   In July, the alliance invited formerly communist Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary to become full members by 1999.
<p>
   Romania made strenuous efforts to join but was told it was not
ready. However, it was praised for progress made in a relatively
short time and is thought to be a contender for future membership.
<p>
   Some 250 lawmakers from NATO and former Soviet bloc countries
are meeting in the palace built by the late Communist dictator,
Nicolae Ceausescu.
<p>
   Since his overthrow and execution during the 1989 anti-communist
revolt, the huge white palace has hosted the likes of pop star
Michael Jackson, Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and Shimon Peres, the former Israeli foreign minister and
premier.
<p>
   NATO chief Javier Solana will arrive Monday for the closing
session of the five-day conference.

RETRANSMITS to restore Eds note
Mossad panel member resigns, speculation Mossad boss to quit
Eds: UPDATES with government announcement of resignation
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
committee probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start Thursday when a former Mossad chief resigned from
the panel.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad chief, would be forced to resign from his job because of the
spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in Amman on
Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, quit the three-member
committee investigating the Amman operation because he publicly
expressed support for it before being appointed.
<p>
   The announcement was made by the Government Press Office, which
said Admoni would be replaced by retired army Maj. Gen. Dan
Tolchovsky.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni had initially been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Mossad director Yatom to give the
interviews supporting the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the
Hamas political bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.

<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
committee probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start Thursday when a former Mossad chief resigned from
the panel.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad chief, would be forced to resign from his job because of the
spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in Amman on
Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, quit the three-member
committee investigating the Amman operation because he publicly
expressed support for it before being appointed.
<p>
   The announcement was made by the Government Press Office, which
said Admoni would be replaced by retired army Maj. Gen. Dan
Tolchovsky.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni had initially been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Mossad director Yatom to give the
interviews supporting the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the
Hamas political bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.
<p>
   The other two members on the Netanyahu-appointed panel are
senior civil servants dependent on the government for their jobs -
Rafi Peled, a former police chief and the director of the
state-owned Israel Electric Corp., and Joseph Ciechanover, the
chairman of the national carrier El Al.
<p>
   Israeli opposition politicians complained that the
``clarification committee'' was appointed by Netanyahu to be a
political fig leaf and not intended to find the truth. They
demanded an independent state commission be appointed.
<p>
   The government attempted to shore up the credibility of the
committee on Wednesday by giving it subpoena powers.
<p>
   In another development, newspapers suggested that Yatom and the
Mossad were responsible for holding up a letter in which King
Hussein of Jordan informed Israel two days before the attack on
Mashaal that Hamas was ready for a conditional cease-fire.
<p>
   Netanyahu has said the message only reached him several hours
after the attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Netanyahu reportedly has ordered an investigation of why the
letter did not reach his desk in time, fueling speculation that
Yatom would eventually be asked to resign.
<p>
   The daily Maariv quoted unnamed security sources as saying that
Yatom would be forced to step down. But Netanyahu spokesman Shai
Bazak said Thursday that Netanyahu did not plan to ask Yatom to
quit.
<p>
   Yatom was scheduled to meet Netanyahu later in the day.
<p>
   The Haaretz daily reported that the head of the Shin Bet secret
service, Ami Ayalon, and military intelligence chief, Moshe Yaalon,
had not been informed of the assassination plans and were upset
with Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom contends he gave the other intelligence chiefs a written
document about the assassination plans, Haaretz said.
<p>
   But the paper quoted an unnamed senior officer as saying the
only relevant passage reports in general terms about intentions to
carry out operations and made no mention of Jordan or of a specific
target.

Israel plans to release tax money to Palestinians
Eds: RESTORES dropped word ``said,'' 16th graf, and ``certain,''
last graf
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A Palestinian official said Thursday Israel has
agreed to release all the remaining tax revenues withheld after a
suicide bombing in July, but Israeli officials said a final
decision has not yet been taken.
<p>
   ``We were informed officially of the decision to release the
money which is estimated to be about 170 million shekels (dlrs 49
million) as soon as possible,'' said Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath, after a meeting with Finance Minister Director-General
Shmuel Slavin.
<p>
   However, Israeli officials said the money has not been released
yet and would not be handed over to the Palestinians until next
week even if the remaining details could be worked out.
<p>
   ``We are discussing unfreezing money. There is no official
decision yet,'' said Moshe Fogel, the Israeli government spokesman.
<p>
   He said, however, that there was an improved atmosphere after
Wednesday's meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first in eight months.
<p>
   According to the Oslo peace agreement, Israel is obligated to
hand over customs duties and other taxes levied on Palestinian
imports and purchases.
<p>
   Netanyahu cut off the flow of tax revenue to the Palestinian
Authority after two Islamic suicide bombers killed 16 shoppers and
the bombers at a Jerusalem market on July 30. He released some of
the funds earlier under U.S. pressure.
<p>
   The United States criticized Netanyahu for withholding the
funds. American officials said the cut-off did not help Israel's
security and merely weakened the Palestinian Authority.
<p>
   Israel will also announce that it will allow Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to land at the new airfield at Dahaniye in the Gaza
Strip, Israel radio said.
<p>
   However, the Israelis have not yet agreed to allow the
Palestinians to open the new airport to international flights.
<p>
   A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and the speaker of the Palestinian
legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, are negotiating the question of
Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
<p>
   The withdrawals were promised by Israel in peace accords, but
after two recent bombings in Jerusalem Netanyahu suspended any
further pullbacks until Israel's security demands were met.
<p>
   Fogel said Israel's decision stands but left open the
possibility of flexibility in the future, noting Palestinian
security cooperation had improved.
<p>
   Israel radio said Israel is also prepared to discuss a temporary
suspension of a controversial Jewish housing project in east
Jerusalem in return for Palestinian acquiescence in the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
<p>
   Israel would promise that the construction would be close to the
existing settlements. They would not be new neighborhoods on
distant hills which the Palestinians regard as new settlements in
all but name.
<p>
   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the report was
``sheer nonsense.'' He said the two sides were discussing a
definition of the American call for a ``time-out'' in Jewish
settlement building.
<p>
   Netanyahu said withholding the funds and other measures imposed
were aimed at forcing Arafat to clamp down on the militants of the
Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups.
<p>
   In a move certain to anger Netanyahu, Arafat released from
prison a prominent member of Hamas, Mohammed Taha, the radio said.

Alcoholism on rise in China
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Alcoholism has increased sharply in China's past
two decades of economic growth as Western influences have overcome
traditional mores against drinking, a Chinese doctor said Thursday.
<p>
   Shen Yucun, an expert on mental health, said the rate of alcohol
dependence jumped to 0.68 per 1,000 people in 1993 from just 0.16
in 1982.
<p>
   ``The speed of the increase is remarkable,'' Shen told a Beijing
meeting of the World Psychiatric Association. ``This is a common
mental health problem that is confronting us.''
<p>
   Alcoholism is just one of the mental health challenges Shen said
China faces as its seeks to modernize. Drug abuse has also
increased and surveys show increases in psychological problems
among students in Beijing, and in behavioral problems in school
children, she said.
<p>
   A 1983 survey of 2,432 Beijing primary school children showed
8.34 percent with behavioral problems. By 1993, the percentage was
12.9 percent.
<p>
   Problems were more frequent among boys and among children from
one-parent families, families with a low educational level or with
parents who often fought, she said.
<p>
   In an interview, Shen said the level of alcoholism was still
very low in comparison with developed countries such as Germany and
France. But, she said, the problem is increasing as Chinese living
standards rise and because ``of the influence of Western culture.''
<p>
   Heavy drinking was traditionally frowned on, but ``now the
people have pocket money, they drink,'' she said.
<p>
   Farmers who used to drink only on holidays or birthdays may now
ferment their own wine and drink weekly or twice weekly, leading to
dependence, she said. Miners, meanwhile, drink before they go into
the mine to ward off cold, she added.
<p>
   Rates of alcohol dependence were highest among heavy laborers,
and lowest among technical workers, she said. The rate was also
higher among ethnic Koreans in China than among the majority Han
Chinese, she said.

Dog thrown from car window to slow down pursuing police
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LANGPORT, England (AP)  &MD;  Two men fleeing from police in a
high-speed car chase hurled whatever they had on hand out the
window to slow their pursuers down  &MD;  including a dog, authorities
say.
<p>
   The drama began when the men's car sped off after being spotted
by officers early Wednesday morning near Langport, Somerset, in
southwest England. They eventually abandoned the car and were found
hiding nearby.
<p>
   The Alsatian-cross was found Thursday wandering near the village
of Long Sutton and taken to a kennel.
<p>
   ``It was fairly traumatised when it first came in, but it is
fine now,'' said a kennel spokeswoman, who was not identified.
``It's a lovely dog, with a chirpy, happy nature.''
<p>
   Police were trying to establish what the dog was doing in the
vehicle and who it belonged to.
<p>
   ``Obviously, we are interviewing two men about this incident
today and that will be one of our questions,'' said a police
spokesman, also not identified. ``But to be honest, who owns the
dog will be quite far down the list.''

BC-Council of Europe Summit,0656
European presidents and PMs grapple with human rights, stability
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Presidents and prime ministers from 40
European nations are grappling with a new Europe, trying to come to
terms with issues such as human rights and stability in the
continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit beginning Friday, with new
members such as Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, wants to reassert the
organization's basic values of promoting democracy, human rights,
human dignity and the rule of law at a time when those ideals
remain fragile in a number of countries.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, for his part, says he wants to
convince fellow leaders to try to lessen Washington's influence on
the continent.
<p>
   ``We do not want the United States to be involved in Europe the
way it is now,'' Yeltsin said recently. ``We want a multipolar
world in which no country tells the others what to do.''
<p>
   Though this is the official Russian line, the reality is Moscow
remains preoccupied with domestic problems and foreign policy
clearly is a secondary concern. It has accepted the inevitability
of NATO's enlargement, and after an initial burst of opposition,
rarely is a word heard on the subject these days.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Moscow's full integration into democratic
Europe.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, But
that doesn't mean it won't try to exert its influence.
<p>
   Council officials said last month the Americans had quietly
circulated an unofficial paper criticizing Croatia's failure to
ensure press freedom and civil liberties. It proposed suspending
Croatia from the Council until it improves its human rights record.
<p>
   The Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   Observing the action from the sidelines will be John Shattuck,
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy and human
rights.
<p>
   Major aims of the summit will be to create a single, permanent
European Court of Human Rights by 1998, available to more than 800
million Europeans; to take action against corruption, money
laundering and organized crime; to ban cloning of human beings; and
to fight racism and intolerance.
<p>
   ``We expect it to be a manifestation of European Unity,'' said
Daniel Tarschys, the Council's secretary-general. At a time when
the European Union and NATO are enlarging, some countries are being
left out. The Council, he said, ``tries to work for a Europe where
everyone feels included.''
<p>
   The existing system for implementing the European Human Rights
Convention is a two-tiered setup that first involves a European
Human Rights Commission that decides if a case is admissible, then
tries to settle it through friendly negotiations. Failing that, it
goes to the Court of Human rights.
<p>
   That was fine with a dozen member states, but has become
unwieldy with 40, often taking five years or more to deal with a
case. The Council wants to streamline that, making the process more
efficient and accessible.
<p>
   Another proposal would set up a focal body for cooperation on
corruption, organized crime and money laundering.
<p>
   The Council of Europe, created in 1949 and with a current budget
of 153 million European currency units (dlrs 171 million), has a
reputation as something of a talk shop lacking real political
punch, a framer of ringing declarations backed by little
discernible action.
<p>
   Asked how Europe would be a better place after the summit,
Tarschys said even if the people of Europe ``don't wake up the next
morning flabbergasted by what we've done,'' it would serve as an
impetus for action.
<p>
   ``The ringing declaration at the end will be a signal to us to
get to work,'' he said.

Historic papers returned to Georgia
By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP)  &MD;  Archives chronicling Georgia's
short-lived independence early in this century have been returned
to the former Soviet republic after decades of safekeeping abroad.
<p>
   The arrival of 82 boxes of documents from Harvard University on
Wednesday night capped a turbulent history for the long-absent
papers.
<p>
   Detailing the chaotic days of 1918-21 and including copies of
the declaration of independence, the documents had been smuggled
out after Russia's communist Red Army overran Georgia in 1921. That
action violated a peace treaty with Georgia, which itself is among
the returned archives.
<p>
   After ultimately journeying halfway around the world, part of
the archives came in 1974 to Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., which
gave Georgia 30 years to request their return.
<p>
   In 1981, with Georgia still firmly in the grip of the Soviet
Union, Tbilisi university professor Guran Sharadze appealed to
Eduard Shevardnadze, then first secretary of Georgia's Communist
Party, to retrieve them.
<p>
   ``How much time do we have?'' asked Shevardnadze, who is now the
elected president of a free Georgia.
<p>
   ``Don't worry, by 2004 communists in Georgia will be forgotten
and (the former government of) Mensheviks will bring the archives
back,'' Shevardnadze reportedly said.
<p>
   Shevardnadze's words came partly true, said Sharadze.
<p>
   ``But we were the ones who had to get them back,'' he added.
<p>
   The arrival of the Harvard papers follows the return of the
other missing batch from France last year.
<p>
   As the Soviet army advanced in 1921, the Georgian
government-in-exile asked prominent historian Ekvtime Takaishvili
to save the documents. He moved the papers from capital Tbilisi to
the western province of Adzharia, then smuggled them to Turkey and
on to Paris, where they were stored in the French National Library.
<p>
   Hidden from the Nazis, the papers survived occupation during
World War II but were badly damaged in 1956 when a flood drenched
the library's first floor where the documents were kept.
<p>
   Members of Georgia's exiled government took the papers to a
chateau outside Paris and tried to dry them. But some of the badly
damaged papers were deteriorating.
<p>
   They then met Harvard history professor Richard Pipes, who was
in Paris on a fellowship, and spent 16 years drafting an agreement
for the damaged part of the records to be moved to Harvard,
cataloged, preserved and copied onto microfilm.
<p>
   The better preserved documents remained in France until last
December, when the French government helped return them to Tbilisi.
<p>
   The papers, in French and Russian, also include treaties with
Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia and minutes of Georgian parliament.
They will be stored for now in the parliament building, where a
commission chaired by Sharadze will study and catalog them.

Red Cross negotiating over Israelis killed in Lebanon
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Jean-Jacques Fresard, the Beirut delegate
of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Thursday it
could take months to complete negotiations over the remains at
Israeli soldiers killed last month in Lebanon.
<p>
   He made the comment after meeting with Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.
<p>
   Fresard said he would carry a message from the prime minister on
the issue to Israel. He declined to disclose its contents.
<p>
   He suggested there had been some progress ``despite the presence
of problems and difficulties along the way.'' He did not elaborate.
<p>
   Eleven Israeli soldiers were killed in a botched commando raid
in Lebanon on Sept. 5. A 12th soldier is missing and presumed dead.
<p>
   The retreating Israelis took most of the dead and wounded with
them.
<p>
   But the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group displayed body
parts several hours after the attack. Others are believed in the
hands of another Shiite Muslim militia, Amal, as well as the
Lebanese Army.
<p>
   The guerrilla groups are believed to want to swap the body parts
for the remains of Lebanese fighters or Lebanese held in Israeli
jails.
<p>
   In Judaism, giving the dead a proper burial is regarded as very
important. In the past Israel has gone to great lengths to recover
the bodies of fallen soldiers and, in some cases, has exchanged
Arab prisoners for the remains.
<p>
   Last year, Hezbollah traded the remains of two Israeli soldiers
for 45 Lebanese detainees held by Israel and its allies in southern
Lebanon.
<p>
   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla campaign to try to force Israel out
of southern Lebanon, where the Jewish state has set up a
self-styled ``security zone'' to protect its northern settlements
from cross-border raids.

Iran releases crews, but not captains, of Dutch tugs
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  &MD;  Iran has released the crew members from
three Dutch tugs it seized in September but is still holding the
captains, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Thursday.
<p>
   The agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
as saying Iran was investigating the case against the tugs, which
are owned by the Dutch firm Smit International.
<p>
   He did not say how many crew members were freed or when.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a Foreign Ministry official told The Associated Press
he expected that the three captains will be released soon, along
with the tugs.
<p>
   ``We consider the case settled,'' he said. He spoke on condition
his name not be used.
<p>
   On Sept. 10, the Dutch government said Iran had seized three
Dutch vessels. The Netherlands called for their immediate release.
<p>
   The Iranian government confirmed holding the tugs, which it said
had entered Iranian waters to salvage a sunken Croatian ship but
had abandoned their mission and headed for another part of the sea
to retrieve debris from a crashed U.S. helicopter.
<p>
   Dutch authorities said that the vessels had a combined crew of
33, including 15 Dutch nationals.
<p>
   Mohammadi disclosed that a Dutch Foreign Ministry official and a
representative from Smit International were holding talks with
Iranian officials in Tehran to secure the release of the captains
and the tugs.
<p>
   He said the Dutch delegation acknowledged the ``illegal'' act
committed by the tugs, apologized and offered to compensate Iran
for damages caused by the incident.

   TIRANA, Albania (AP)  &MD;  Donkeys are the latest discovery for
Albanian gun- and drugrunners.
<p>
   Greek soldiers stopped a donkey carrying 28 Kalashnikov rifles,
22 kilos (48.5 pounds) of hashish and several hundred bullets just
after it crossed the border from Albania, the Albanian daily Gazeta
Shqiptare reported Thursday.
<p>
   The donkey was sent toward the border on Tuesday by residents of
Permet, a town near the border with Greece, some 130 kilometers (80
miles) southeast of Tirana.
<p>
   A group of men were waiting in Greece to unload the donkey, the
daily said. But Greek soldiers approached and, after an exchange of
gunfire in which noone was injured, held the donkey, confiscating
the guns, drugs and bullets, Gazeta Shqiptare said in a report from
Permet citing unidentified local sources.
<p>
   Permet police could not be reached by telephone from Tirana. But
Greek police in Tirana confirmed the incident, saying it happened
Tuesday. And a resident of the area, insisting on anonymity, told
The Associated Press by telephone that donkeys and mules recently
have become a favored means for smuggling across the border.

Italian playwright Dario Fo wins Nobel Prize for Literature
Eds: Leads throughout to ADD background on Fo's banning from United
States and of his plays in Italy, new quote from citation in 2nd
graf.
By JIM HEINTZ
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, a leftist Italian playwright
whose work combines biting political observation with sidesplitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited as one ``who emulates
the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging the authority and
upholding the dignity of the downtrodden'' by the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1
million).
<p>
   ``I am amazed,''' said Fo, when reached by the ANSA news agency
while driving from Rome to Milan.
<p>
   He said he learned of the prize when another car drove near him
holding up a sign ``Dario has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   Among the most popular and noted of his more than 70 plays are
``Mistero Buffo, ``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of
an Anarchist.''
<p>
   Fo's open opposition to the establishment and his associations
with left-wing groups often caused officials to ban his works from
state-run theaters in Italy.
<p>
   In 1980, Fo and his wife were refused entry visas into the
United States because of his support for left-wing activities in
Italy. In 1984, the U.S. government relented and allowed the couple
to visit New York briefly and see a New York production of
``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The play is based on right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in 1969,
which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers on a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who possesses
the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of officialdom,'' the
citation said.
<p>
   ``His independence and clear-sightedness have led him to take
great risks, whose consequences he has been made to feel,'' the
academy said.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher
said that Fo was a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.''
<p>
   Fo was introduced to narrative traditions at an early age
through his grandfather, a well-known storyteller. At age 25, he
began to write and act satirical cabarets at the Piccolo Theater in
Milan.
<p>
   Fo married actress Franca Rame in 1954, with whom he founded a
drama company five years later. He credited her as a major factor
in his prize-winning work.
<p>
   ``I'd like to think that the consistency of our discourse was
rewarded,'' he told ANSA. ``I realize that sometimes we've made
mistakes and we've been too euphoric and light.''
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation said.
<p>
   The academy keeps a tight lid on how it chooses winners, saying
only that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with the
prize.
<p>
   But few observers believe that's all that the academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Other names that show up on speculators' lists of likelies year
after year include Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South
Africa, Doris Lessing of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   Bob Dylan also was nominated, but was given little chance of
winning.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won on Monday by American Stanley Prusiner
for discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

Lukashenko reminds Russia that freed journalist must face trial
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP)  &MD;  The day after freeing a Russian TV
journalist who spent more than two months in prison, the
authoritarian Belarusian leader reminded the Kremlin on Thursday
that the reporter still faces trial.
<p>
   The case of ORT correspondent Pavel Sheremet has soured
relations between the two countries to the point that President
Boris Yeltsin banned his Belarusian counterpart from visiting
Russia until he released the journalist.
<p>
   President Alexander Lukashenko lashed out at ORT for its
Wednesday report, saying it wrongly created the impression that
Sheremet had been released on orders from Yeltsin.
<p>
   ``If somebody's opinion was taken into consideration, it was
that of Patriarch Alexy II,'' the head of the Russian Orthodox
Church, the Interfax news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying.
<p>
   Lukashenko spoke during a meeting with ORT director Ksenia
Ponomaryova in which he reiterated that Sheremet will face trial in
the near future. The journalist is charged with illegally crossing
the border with Lithuania while researching a report about lax
border controls  &MD;  an accusation he denies.
<p>
   Lukashenko told Ponomaryova that ORT would be allowed to
broadcast its programs in Belarus, but urged the Russian
state-controlled network to cover its debt for signal transmission.
<p>
   In a separate interview to be published in the Russian weekly
Sobesednik, excerpts of which were released by Interfax on
Thursday, Lukashenko said he hoped to remain friends with Yeltsin
despite the recent crisis.
<p>
   Lukashenko, a former state farm director openly nostalgic for
the Soviet Union, signed a union treaty with Russia last spring and
has pushed for a full merger between his country of 10 million
people and its big eastern neighbor.
<p>
   Russian liberals have condemned the treaty, arguing that Moscow
should distance itself from the strong-handed Belarusian leader,
who has cracked down on dissent and the independent media.

Algerian president concludes visit to Saudi Arabia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  &MD;  Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
ended a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday after holding talks with
King Fahd on the Middle East peace process and trade ties, Saudi
officials said.
<p>
   He also met during his three-day visit with Crown Prince
Abdullah.
<p>
   Zeroual's visit was his first to the kingdom since he came to
power in 1994.
<p>
   The oil-rich North African country has been torn by an Islamic
insurgency set off in January 1992 when the government canceled
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
<p>
   Since then, more than 60,000 people have died in a conflict that
has turned into a series of massacres of civilians in recent weeks.
The Armed Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for much of the
violence.
<p>
   Zeroual visited Syria and Jordan in mid-September.

BC-Netherlands-Art Ultimatum
Inheritance dispute could rob museums of masterpieces
AP Photo planned
By WILLIAM J. KOLE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Major Dutch art museums, including
Amsterdam's famed Rijksmuseum, face an awkward ultimatum: Pay an
art dealer's heirs for more than 90 loaned masterpieces  &MD;  or give
them back.
<p>
   The inheritance squabble could leave nothing but white space
behind the red velvet ropes where 16th- and 17th-century works by
Dutch masters like Jan Steen now hang.
<p>
   Investigators are working to sort out the confusion over whether
relatives of the late Jacques Goudstikker have a legal claim to the
Amsterdam dealer's fabulous collection, which has drawn millions of
admiring tourists since the 1950s.
<p>
   The Culture Ministry, seeking to play down the dispute,
dismissed it Thursday as ``a lot of hypothetical noise.'' But 17 of
the Netherlands' most prominent museums were already lamenting the
possible loss of a national treasure.
<p>
   ``Naturally it's frightfully unfortunate if we have to go
without such great works. But justice must prevail,'' said Guido
Jansen, curator of the Rijksmuseum, which has seven Goudstikker
paintings.
<p>
   Mostly oils, they include Steen's famous ``The Sacrifice of
Iphigeneia,'' portraits by Nicolaes Maes and a river landscape by
Salomon van Ruysdael. Estimates of the total worth of the
Goudstikker collection run into tens of millions of guilders
(dollars).
<p>
   Goudstikker was killed on May 16, 1940, while trying to flee to
England. At that time, his collection numbered more than 1,200
paintings, drawings and sculptures.
<p>
   The artworks, like many others, fell into Nazi hands during
World War II. After the war, the Dutch government recovered many of
them and loaned them to museums, never telling Goudstikker's widow,
Desiree, who had remarried and settled in New York.
<p>
   She eventually learned of the recovery and launched a legal
battle to get the artworks back. In 1952, tired of trying, she
settled with the government and relinquished her claims.
<p>
   Now her family is asking for the paintings back, or for cash
equal to their value, contending that the Dutch government was less
than honest in its dealings with Mrs. Goudstikker and may have
knowingly withheld information from her.
<p>
   The Netherlands Collection Management Institute, which sorts out
legal issues in the Dutch art world, is examining whether
Goudstikker's heirs have a justifiable claim to the trophy
artworks.
<p>
   ``We're waiting to see whether the investigation concludes that
the paintings have to go. If that's the case, we'll have to give
them back to the family,'' said Elles Kamphuis, a Rijksmuseum
spokeswoman.
<p>
   Among the other prominent museums that were loaned masterpieces
once owned by Goudstikker are the Noordbrabants Museum in Den
Bosch, which has six; the Bonnefanten Museum in the southern city
of Maastricht, which has five; and the Catharinagasthuis in the
cheese-making city of Gouda, which has four.
<p>
   The rest of the paintings are on display or in storage at art
museums in The Hague, Utrecht, Rotterdam and other major Dutch
cities, and some decorate Dutch government offices and overseas
embassies. At least one hangs in the Dutch capital's famed
Rembrandt House.
<p>
   If the paintings have to be returned, ``it will have sweeping
consequences for our collection,'' said Ton Quik, curator of the
Limburg Museum in the southern Netherlands.
<p>
   The Culture Ministry frequently buys paintings to enrich Dutch
museums, but its budget is no match for the pricetags likely to
hang on pieces in the Goudstikker collection.
<p>
   ``We really don't know whether this claim has a chance,'' said
ministry spokesman Michael van Wissen van Veen. ``We're just
waiting now.''

Mossad panel member resigns, speculation Mossad boss to quit
Eds: UPDATES with newspaper headline speculating about possible
Mossad boss resignation, Bazak says he won't be asked to quit in
14th and 15th grafs
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's special
committee probing a botched assassination in Jordan got off to a
stumbling start Thursday when a former Mossad chief resigned from
the panel.
<p>
   Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Danny Yatom, the current
Mossad director, would be forced to resign from his job because of
the spy agency's bungled assassination of a Hamas leader in the
Jordanian capital of Amman on Sept. 25.
<p>
   Nahum Admoni, a former Mossad head, quit the three-member
committee investigating the Amman operation because he publicly
expressed support for it before being appointed.
<p>
   The announcement was made by the Government Press Office, which
said Admoni would be replaced by retired army Maj. Gen. Dan
Tolchovsky.
<p>
   Israel radio said Admoni initially had been asked by the prime
minister's office and by Yatom to give the interviews supporting
the targeting of Khalid Mashaal, chief of the Hamas political
bureau.
<p>
   At the time, government officials were not speaking publicly
about the affair because the two Mossad agents involved in the
assassination attempt were still in Jordanian custody.
<p>
   The Mossad agents, traveling on forged Canadian passports, were
caught after injecting Mashaal with a poison and later exchanged
for the jailed founder of Hamas, Ahmed Yassin, and 20 other
prisoners.
<p>
   The other two members on the Netanyahu-appointed panel are
senior civil servants dependent on the government for their jobs  &MD; 
Rafi Peled, a former police chief and the director of the
state-owned Israel Electric Corp., and Joseph Ciechanover, the
chairman of the national carrier El Al.
<p>
   Israeli opposition politicians complained that the
``clarification committee'' was appointed by Netanyahu to be a
political fig leaf and not intended to find the truth. They
demanded an independent state commission be appointed.
<p>
   The government attempted to shore up the credibility of the
committee on Wednesday by giving it subpoena powers.
<p>
   In another development, newspapers suggested that Yatom and the
Mossad were responsible for holding up a letter in which King
Hussein of Jordan informed Israel two days before the attack on
Mashaal that Hamas was ready for a conditional cease-fire.
<p>
   Netanyahu has said the message only reached him several hours
after the attack on Mashaal.
<p>
   Netanyahu reportedly has ordered an investigation of why the
letter did not reach his desk in time, fueling speculation that
Yatom would eventually be asked to resign.
<p>
   The daily Maariv quoted unnamed security sources as saying that
Yatom would be forced to step down. But Netanyahu spokesman Shai
Bazak said Thursday that Netanyahu did not plan to ask Yatom to
quit.
<p>
   Yatom was scheduled to meet Netanyahu later in the day.
<p>
   The Haaretz daily reported that the head of the Shin Bet secret
service, Ami Ayalon, and military intelligence chief, Moshe Yaalon,
had not been informed of the assassination plans and were upset
with Yatom.
<p>
   Yatom contends he gave the other intelligence chiefs a written
document about the assassination plans, Haaretz said.
<p>
   But the paper quoted an unnamed senior officer as saying the
only relevant passage reports in general terms about intentions to
carry out operations and made no mention of Jordan or of a specific
target.

<p>
   TIRANA, Albania (AP)  &MD;  Donkeys are the latest discovery for
Albanian gun- and drugrunners.
<p>
   Greek soldiers stopped a donkey carrying 28 Kalashnikov rifles,
22 kilos (48.5 pounds) of hashish and several hundred bullets just
after it crossed the border from Albania, the Albanian daily Gazeta
Shqiptare reported Thursday.
<p>
   The donkey was sent toward the border on Tuesday by residents of
Permet, a town near the border with Greece, some 130 kilometers (80
miles) southeast of Tirana.
<p>
   A group of men were waiting in Greece to unload the donkey, the
daily said. But Greek soldiers approached and, after an exchange of
gunfire in which noone was injured, held the donkey, confiscating
the guns, drugs and bullets, Gazeta Shqiptare said in a report from
Permet citing unidentified local sources.
<p>
   Permet police could not be reached by telephone from Tirana. But
Greek police in Athens confirmed the incident, saying it happened
Tuesday. And a resident of the area, insisting on anonymity, told
The Associated Press by telephone that donkeys and mules recently
have become a favored means for smuggling across the border.

EU: though some have inside lane, it will be fair to all newcomers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP)  &MD;  The European Union's foreign affairs
chief said Thursday the EU must differentiate between newcomers
adding that opening membership talks with all 11 candidates
simultaneously would be disastrous.
<p>
   ``Little would be gained by opening negotiations with countries
which are insufficiently prepared,'' Hans van den Broek said.
``Such negotiations would soon falter, leading to
disillusionment.''
<p>
   He said the plan to start membership talks in 1998 with the six
most promising candidates  &MD;  Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Estonia and Slovenia  &MD;  did not mean Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia will be forgotten.
<p>
   ``Differentiation in no way implies discrimination,'' said Van
den Broek, the EU Foreign Relations Commissioner, in a speech here
to political and business leaders. ``Nothing could be farther from
(the EU's) intentions than to draw new dividing lines across
Europe.''
<p>
   Van den Broek urged second-tier candidates to improve their
economic record without delay and thus boost their chance of early
membership. For its part, the EU has earmarked dlrs 88.5 billion in
aid for these countries in the 2000-2006 period, he added.
<p>
   It has not been easy for the current EU members to agree on the
policy of differentiation.
<p>
   Denmark, for one, would have preferred for Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania to start membership talks with the EU simultaneously for
the sake of preserving Baltic unity.
<p>
   However, differentiation will enable the EU to keep Turkey at
arm's length, for now.
<p>
   Turkey wants to join the union but has a weak economy, a poor
human rights record, tenuous relations with Greece and 35,000
troops on Cyprus propping up a Turkish-Cypriot state only Ankara
recognizes.
<p>
   Any European nation can join the EU provided it is a democracy
and has a market economy.

Environment group urges strategy to prevent forest fires
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  The World Wide Fund for Nature
urged Southeast Asian governments Thursday to adopt a strategy to
prevent a recurrence of the Indonesian forest fires now blanketing
the region with choking smog.
<p>
   ``Companies and agencies that use fire must also be made fully
financially and legally responsible for prevention, fire-fighting
and paying appropriate penalties,'' said a joint statement from the
WWF offices in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Vietnam.
<p>
   The WWF said a regional solution was needed, and governments of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations must ensure that a
strategy is adopted. The ASEAN members are Burma, Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
<p>
   Part of the strategy, it said, should be to impose a moratorium
on the use of fire in land-clearing by commercial estates and
development projects until an effective fire management system was
implemented in the stricken areas in Kalimantan and Sumatra in
Indonesia.
<p>
   ``Such a system must maintain strict controls over burning and
restrict its use in sensitive areas and at times of high-risk
fire,'' it said.
<p>
   It said local authorities also must be given powers to strictly
enforce limitations on such burning and introduce a permit system
for the use of fire in agriculture and waste incineration.

Red Cross negotiating over Israelis killed in Lebanon
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Negotiations over the remains at Israeli
soldiers killed last month in Lebanon may take months, the Beirut
delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
Thursday
<p>
   Jean-Jacques Fresard, speaking after a meeting with Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri, said he would carry a message from the prime
minister on the issue to Israel. He declined to disclose its
contents.
<p>
   He suggested there had been some progress ``despite the presence
of problems and difficulties along the way.'' He did not elaborate.
<p>
   Eleven Israeli soldiers were killed in a botched commando raid
in Lebanon on Sept. 5. A 12th soldier is missing and presumed dead.
<p>
   The retreating Israelis took most of the dead and wounded with
them.
<p>
   But the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group displayed body
parts several hours after the attack. Others are believed in the
hands of another Shiite Muslim militia, Amal, as well as the
Lebanese Army.
<p>
   The guerrilla groups are believed to want to swap the body parts
for the remains of Lebanese fighters or Lebanese held in Israeli
jails.
<p>
   Israel has always made expeditious and formal funerals for its
war dead a priority and has gone to great lengths to recover the
bodies of fallen soldiers. In some cases, it has exchanged Arab
prisoners for the remains.
<p>
   Last year, Hezbollah traded the remains of two Israeli soldiers
for 45 Lebanese detainees held by Israel and its allies in southern
Lebanon.
<p>
   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla campaign to try to force Israel out
of southern Lebanon, where the Jewish state has set up a
self-styled ``security zone'' to protect its northern settlements
from cross-border raids.

<p>
   STANFORD, California (AP)  &MD;  Stanford University has apologized
to more than 30 Catholic schools that were angered when the
university's band performed a parody of the Irish potato famine and
a mock debate between a Catholic cardinal and the devil at last
week's football game against Notre Dame.
<p>
   The band's shows also referred to the Irish as ``stinking
drunks.''
<p>
   Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland referred to the band's act
as ``tasteless'' and wrote ``the band crossed the line from funny
to obnoxious and offensive.''
<p>
   But the band refused to apologize.
<p>
   ``Our field show was meant to poke fun at the Notre Dame mascot
(the Fighting Irish) and not a group of people,'' said the band's
manager, Scott McKissen. ``Unfortunately, some people took it far
more seriously than it was intended.''
<p>
   Tim Brosnan, principal of Archbishop Mitty, a Catholic high
school in San Jose, criticized the university's refusal to punish
the band.
<p>
   ``When you send them out to do a performance at halftime, you're
giving them a venue that is substantial to represent that kind of
bigotry. And that's what it was: It was bigotry.''

Algerian president concludes visit to Saudi Arabia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  &MD;  Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
ended a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday after holding talks with
King Fahd on the Middle East peace process and trade ties, Saudi
officials said.
<p>
   He also met during his three-day visit with Crown Prince
Abdullah.
<p>
   Zeroual's visit was his first to the kingdom since he came to
power in 1994.
<p>
   The oil-rich North African country has been torn by an Islamic
insurgency set off in January 1992 when the government canceled
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
<p>
   Since then, more than 60,000 people have died in a conflict that
has turned into a series of massacres of civilians in recent weeks.
The Armed Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for much of the
violence.
<p>
   Zeroual visited Syria and Jordan in mid-September.

Thai leader asks Japanese companies to help repair economy

<p>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
asked Japanese executives Thursday to help repair his nation's
battered economy by buying more Thai products and giving breaks to
Thai borrowers.
<p>
   ``Japanese corporate headquarters should actively use their
marketing networks to promote more exports from their industrial
ventures in Thailand, to third countries as well as back to
Japan,'' Chavalit said in a luncheon speech to a group of Japanese
business leaders.
<p>
   Chavalit also met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, and Hashimoto said his government would set up a dlrs 1
billion, two-year trade insurance scheme to cover loans made by
Japanese corporations to Thai companies.
<p>
   Chavalit arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a three-day visit. His
schedule is packed with meetings with executives of a dozen of
Japan's biggest companies, including Sony Corp., Toyota Motor Corp.
and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. He also is to meet with representatives of
the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
<p>
   Many Japanese manufacturers have built plants in Thailand to
take advantage of lower wages there. In his speech Thursday,
Chavalit appealed to those companies to help revitalize the Thai
economy, now suffering from a dramatic fall in the value of its
currency and a glut of bad property loans.
<p>
   Chavalit asked Japanese automobile and electronics makers to
help tip the trade balance in Thailand's favor, encouraging them to
increase exports from Thai plants while buying more parts from
local companies.
<p>
   ``I also encourage you to increase your efforts to assist small
and medium Thai suppliers with technical assistance and technology
transfer,'' he told the businessmen.
<p>
   Chavalit appealed to Japan's giant trading companies to
``increase their `Buy Thai' programs and assist in identifying new
markets for Thai exports.''
<p>
   He asked bankers to ``be more flexible by rolling over
short-term loans and being pro-active in extending higher levels of
new loans.'' Japanese banks are the leading foreign lenders to Thai
companies.
<p>
   Hirokazu Nakamura, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp., one of
the companies Chavalit visited Thursday, said he expects his
company to export five times more trucks from Thailand by the year
2000 than it did last year.
<p>
   It is not the first time Thailand has turned to Tokyo for
assistance. In August, Japan played a key role in putting together
a dlrs 17.2 billion International Monetary Fund package to help the
country cope with the economic downturn.
<p>
   Hashimoto warned that Thailand will have to comply with the plan
in a timely way and ease restrictions on trade and foreign capital
to make his country a more attractive business environment.
<p>
   For years, Thailand had boasted one of the world's
fastest-growing economies. But in early July, the baht fell
sharply, exacerbating problems in the financial industry and
causing a ripple effect in the currencies of other Southeast Asian
countries.
<p>
   Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said separately Thursday
that he believed the Thai baht is undervalued and should be
stronger. He said the Thai economy will grow this year, but at a
rate of less 2 percent.

Russian premier calls for greater cooperation among Commonwealth
states
Eds: UPDATES with new quote from Kyrgyz president in new graf 5.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told
fellow premiers that closer cooperation was needed among the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition established
after the Soviet breakup.
<p>
   ``The picture we observe is not homogeneous at present,''
Chernomyrdin told a meeting of CIS heads of government in Bishkek,
Kyrgyzstan.
<p>
   ``This situation needs to be changed radically because
reciprocal trade turnover is the main criterion of close economic
relations,'' Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
<p>
   The CIS, which includes 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics,
was created as the Soviet Union dissolved at the end of 1991. It is
intended to preserve and develop ties between the republics, but
has achieved few practical results.
<p>
   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, who hosted the conference, told
its participants that the commonwealth ``doesn't meet the needs of
its member states.''
<p>
   Member countries are struggling economically and are reluctant
to relinquish any of their independence to an organization they
fear will be dominated by Moscow. The regular meetings produce a
stream of resolutions, most of which have never been implemented.
<p>
   Trade among member countries fell almost 10 percent in the first
half of this year in comparison with the same period in 1996,
Chernomyrdin noted at the conference. The CIS also has proved
ineffective in solving political and military conflicts in the
ex-Soviet republics.
<p>
   The prime ministers agreed to hold a CIS heads-of-state meeting
Oct. 23 in the Moldovan capital, Kishinev, to address about 20
issues, including border and customs controls, transport tariffs
and air defense.

<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  Renato Ruggiero, Director-General of the
132-member World Trade Organization, Thursday unveiled a new logo
for the trade body.
<p>
   The emblem comprises six red, green and blue arcs representing
the globe.
<p>
   The winning logo was selected from over 200 international
entries in a competition held by the Singapore government. It
symbolizes ``member nations meeting to forge strategic alliances,''
according to Su Yeang, of graphic arts company Su Yeang Design, the
firm behind it.
<p>
   It is, said Ruggiero, ``a symbol that we do not want just a
partial system'' of global commerce under the WTO, which superseded
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on Jan. 1, 1995.
<p>
   ``At the moment, we are satisfied with how things are going,''
he said, adding that a review of the WTO's dispute settlement
procedure is due to be finished by the end of next year.
<p>
   Ruggiero also expressed optimism over the prospects for progress
in long-running talks over China's entry to the international body.
<p>
   Ruggiero said he had a ``message of optimism.''
<p>
   ``Because people have chosen market economies, because nations
have chosen to liberalize their economies, we are in a situation in
which we have now a prospect of 4.5 percent (world economic) growth
in the medium term, with the developing countries having double the
growth of the advanced economies.''
<p>
   ``I think that we are moving ahead, also narrowing the
inequalities and differences, and this is due to the market economy
and to liberalization, which is the dominant economy in the world
today. This is a remarkable achievement.''

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small plane with two Spanish crew
members and seven tourists crashed Thursday morning in Gambia,
killing all but one person on board, a Spanish diplomat said.
<p>
   Sebastian Drover, the Spanish vice counsel in Banjul, said the
flight had originated in the Canary Islands, a string of Spanish
islands off the coast of Morocco.
<p>
   He had no other details but the Spanish news agency EFE, in a
dispatch from Las Palmas, Grand Canary Island's principal city,
said that all the passengers were German tourists.

people on board. The officer, who gave her name only as Mrs. Jagne,
refused to disclose any further information.

President appoints new taxation minister after bank scandal

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP)  &MD;  President Martti Ahtisaari on Thursday
appointed a new Social Democratic tax minister to succeed Arja Alho
who resigned over a banking scandal.
<p>
   Jouko Skinnari succeeds Alho who stepped down Tuesday after
lawmakers demanded her ouster because she had agreed to reduce the
fine levied on the manager of a defunct bank.
<p>
   Skinnari, 51, has been a lawmaker since 1980 and is vice
chairman of the Social Democratic parliamentary group.
<p>
   SDP lawmakers approved Skinnari's candidacy after the party
leader, Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, nominated him late
Wednesday.
<p>
   The ruling Social Democratic Party last week was thrown into
what Lipponen called the party's ``most serious crisis'' since
taking office in 1995.
<p>
   Alho came under fire after she revealed she had agreed to reduce
the fine imposed on Ulf Sundqvist, former manager of the now
defunct STS bank and former SDP chairman.
<p>
   He had been ordered by the Supreme Court in July to pay 9
million markkaa (dlrs 1.2 million) for his role in approving loans
in 1990-1992 that caused huge losses for the bank, which later went
defunct.
<p>
   Last month, Alho approved reducing the fine to 1.2 million
markkaa (dlrs 230,000) on the grounds that Sundqvist would likely
be unable to pay the full sum.
<p>
   Opposition members had been demanding Alho's resignation since
last week, but the tide turned Monday when six SDP lawmakers
demanded she step down.
<p>
   Alho, 43, had been the second finance minister since the
five-party coalition took office in April 1995. She was elected
lawmaker in 1983, and will continue in Parliament until the next
elections in 1999.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  A visiting Iraqi industrial delegation
has called for reviving trade with Lebanon and announced that an
exhibition of Lebanese industrial products will take place in
Baghdad next week.
<p>
   Iraq purchased 20 percent of Lebanon's exports before the United
Nations clamped economic sanctions on the country in 1990 to punish
it for invading neighboring Kuwait.
<p>
   The Iraqi businessmen arrived in Beirut on Sunday for a weeklong
visit, the first since the sanctions were imposed.
<p>
   Adnan al-Qudsi, chairman of Iraq's Union of Industrialists and
head of the Iraqi delegation, was quoted Thursday as saying the
exhibition of Lebanese products will open next Monday.
<p>
   He spoke to reporters after meeting with Foreign Minister Faris
Bweiz on Wednesday.
<p>
   Al-Qudsi also expressed hope for the resumption of ``economic
cooperation between the Iraqi and Lebanese private sectors'' under
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine.

   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP)  &MD;  National Bank of Bahrain, the largest
commercial bank on the island, said Thursday its net profit in the
first nine months of 1997 rose 15 percent to 12.1 million dinars
(dlrs 32 million) compared with the same period last year.
<p>
   The bank's net profit for the first nine months of 1996 was 10.5
million dinars (dlrs 28 million), the bank said in a statement.
<p>
   The banks assets in the first nine months rose nearly 20 percent
to 900.3 million dinars (dlrs 2.3 billion), the statement said.
<p>
   The bank did not explain the gains.
<p>
   NBB is 49 percent owned by the government of Bahrain. The
remaining shares are listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.

points higher than the previous week.
<p>
   Hassan Abdul-Rahim, financial analyst at the National
Investments Co., said liquidity has significantly increased with
the return of investors from their summer vacations. Activity rose
to pre-vacation levels, he said.
<p>
   Some 1.09 billion shares changed hands this week, up from 560.85
million last week. The value of these shares also shot up to 393.48
million dinars (dlrs 1.31 billion) from 198.80 million dinars (dlrs
662.66 million).

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Egypt has earmarked 50 million pounds (dlrs
14.7 million) for projects to provide oil services to the new
Toshka Canal to be built in the South.
<p>
   The English-Language Egyptian Gazette said Thursday that the
first phase will involve setting up a depot on the canal to provide
construction crews with fuel.
<p>
   It quoted Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi as saying the depot also
will power electricity generating units.
<p>
   Phase two will involve providing fuel for farming and industrial
areas, the paper said.
<p>
   The government is building the canal to draw water from behind
the High Dam in Aswan to irrigate land in the Western Desert.

ROME: budget cuts.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Prodi led Italy's 55th government since World War II and the
first dominated by leftists. Prodi had staked his administration on
joining the euro.
<p>
   It will be up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to accept
Prodi's resignation or ask him to form a new government.
<p>
   If a new majority cannot be formed, Scalfaro might have to call
an election.
<p>
   Prodi has made a series of appeals in parliament this week to
salvage his 17-month-old center-left government at this crucial
stage in its march toward European Monetary Union.
<p>
   ``The goal is within reach,'' he repeated in his nationally
televised address before the Chamber of Deputies. He said Communist
Refoundation's leader, Fausto Bertinotti, will bear the
responsibility if Italy fails in the goal.
<p>
   But Refoundation in a statement before the vote said it
expressed a ``negative judgment'' on Prodi's speech regarding the
budget and the government's economic policies in general.
<p>
   Refoundation, whose votes Prodi needs in the chamber, threatened
to vote against Prodi's 1998 budget unless he made concessions on
pensions, health care, job creation and a shorter work week.
<p>
   Prodi repeated an earlier concession that the government would
move toward a 35-hour work week, from 40 hours, and made a small
bow toward the Communists by assuring that the electrical group
ENEL would remain state-owned for a ``non-brief'' period of time.

IAEA report does not clear Iraq on nuclear program
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Iraq could still be hiding some nuclear
secrets because it has not provided a full picture of its atomic
program, the U.N. atomic energy said Thursday.
<p>
   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency sent a
report to the U.N. Security Council last week, which will be
discussed in further detail when IAEA director-general Hans Blix
speaks to the Security Council Oct. 16, agency spokesman David Kyd
said.
<p>
   In the report, ``the IAEA is not expressing the view that Iraq
has provided a full, final and complete declaration of its
clandestine nuclear program,'' Kyd said.
<p>
   The U.N. Security Council resolution of 1991 that ordered the
IAEA to get a thorough picture of Iraq's secret nuclear weapons
program required that it provide that full picture.
<p>
   Iraq wants the Security Council to lift sanctions imposed after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, insisting it has
complied with all U.N. requirements.
<p>
   Kyd's statement followed a similar declaration by Blix last
month at the IAEA's annual general conference.
<p>
   There, Blix said that ``the blank spots in this picture have
become fewer ... but it's not impossible that some equipment might
be undetected.''
<p>
   Kyd said that the IAEA report to the Security Council went to
U.N. headquarters in New York last week.
<p>
   It is more complete than a normal progress report on IAEA work
in Iraq, giving an overview of what the agency has learned in its
six years of inspecting the Iraqi facilities.
<p>
   Iraq is under U.N. orders to scrap nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons programs and long-range missiles as part of the
international policing imposed on it after the 1991 Gulf War.

Inheritance dispute could rob museums of masterpieces
By WILLIAM J. KOLE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Major Dutch art museums, including
Amsterdam's famed Rijksmuseum, face an awkward ultimatum: Pay an
art dealer's heirs for more than 90 loaned masterpieces  &MD;  or give
them back.
<p>
   The inheritance squabble could leave nothing but white space
behind the red velvet ropes where 16th- and 17th-century works by
Dutch masters like Jan Steen now hang.
<p>
   Investigators are working to sort out the confusion over whether
relatives of the late Jacques Goudstikker have a legal claim to the
Amsterdam dealer's fabulous collection, which has drawn millions of
admiring tourists since the 1950s.
<p>
   The Culture Ministry, seeking to play down the dispute,
dismissed it Thursday as ``a lot of hypothetical noise.'' But 17 of
the Netherlands' most prominent museums were already lamenting the
possible loss of a national treasure.
<p>
   ``Naturally it's frightfully unfortunate if we have to go
without such great works. But justice must prevail,'' said Guido
Jansen, curator of the Rijksmuseum, which has seven Goudstikker
paintings.
<p>
   Mostly oils, they include Steen's famous ``The Sacrifice of
Iphigeneia,'' portraits by Nicolaes Maes and a river landscape by
Salomon van Ruysdael. Estimates of the total worth of the
Goudstikker collection run into tens of millions of guilders
(dollars).
<p>
   Goudstikker was killed on May 16, 1940, while trying to flee to
England. At that time, his collection numbered more than 1,200
paintings, drawings and sculptures.
<p>
   The artworks, like many others, fell into Nazi hands during
World War II. After the war, the Dutch government recovered many of
them and loaned them to museums, never telling Goudstikker's widow,
Desiree, who had remarried and settled in New York.
<p>
   She eventually learned of the recovery and launched a legal
battle to get the artworks back. In 1952, tired of trying, she
settled with the government and relinquished her claims.
<p>
   Now her family is asking for the paintings back, or for cash
equal to their value, contending that the Dutch government was less
than honest in its dealings with Mrs. Goudstikker and may have
knowingly withheld information from her.
<p>
   The Netherlands Collection Management Institute, which sorts out
legal issues in the Dutch art world, is examining whether
Goudstikker's heirs have a justifiable claim to the trophy
artworks.
<p>
   ``We're waiting to see whether the investigation concludes that
the paintings have to go. If that's the case, we'll have to give
them back to the family,'' said Elles Kamphuis, a Rijksmuseum
spokeswoman.
<p>
   Among the other prominent museums that were loaned masterpieces
once owned by Goudstikker are the Noordbrabants Museum in Den
Bosch, which has six; the Bonnefanten Museum in the southern city
of Maastricht, which has five; and the Catharinagasthuis in the
cheese-making city of Gouda, which has four.
<p>
   The rest of the paintings are on display or in storage at art
museums in The Hague, Utrecht, Rotterdam and other major Dutch
cities, and some decorate Dutch government offices and overseas
embassies. At least one hangs in the Dutch capital's famed
Rembrandt House.
<p>
   If the paintings have to be returned, ``it will have sweeping
consequences for our collection,'' said Ton Quik, curator of the
Limburg Museum in the southern Netherlands.
<p>
   The Culture Ministry frequently buys paintings to enrich Dutch
museums, but its budget is no match for the pricetags likely to
hang on pieces in the Goudstikker collection.
<p>
   ``We really don't know whether this claim has a chance,'' said
ministry spokesman Michael van Wissen van Veen. ``We're just
waiting now.''

North Koreans celebrate Kim Jong Il's rise to power
AP Photos Available
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  &MD;  In an outpouring of orchestrated
celebration in their famine-stricken communist state, North Koreans
danced and sang Thursday, pledging loyalty to their new ``Great
Leader.''
<p>
   Kim Jong Il, 55, was elected Wednesday as general secretary of
North Korea's ruling Workers Party. That triggered mass
celebrations  &MD;  from the capital Pyongyang to military outposts
along the tense border with rival South Korea.
<p>
   Kim took the post in communism's first hereditary transfer of
power. Like his father, the late President Kim Il Sung, the younger
Kim is the object of a personality cult and is treated as a
demigod.
<p>
   In North Korean footage shown on South Korean television,
acrobats tumbled and rolled and fireworks exploded over Pyongyang,
while the capital's main square was packed with people shouting and
waving red flags.
<p>
   Seoul's MBC TV also showed North Korean soldiers dancing and
singing around their guard posts in the demilitarized zone
separating the two Koreas. Their drab, concrete guard posts were
festooned with colorful flags and balloons.
<p>
   ``Today, broad segments of people in holiday dress are dancing
in the streets and villages all day long,'' reported the North's
official Korean Central News Agency.
<p>
   Party and state officials packed the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium to
mark the 52nd anniversary of the Workers Party and pledged loyalty
to Kim, a separate KCNA dispatch said.
<p>
   South Korean monitors said North Korea's state-run TV extended
its usual air time and carried the news of Kim's election all day
Thursday. All North Korean newspapers carried Kim's color portrait
for the first time.
<p>
   Kim has been the undisputed leader of North Korea since the
death of his father in July 1994. Even before that, he had been
named head of the country's 1.1 million-strong military and
anointed to succeed his father as party chief and president.
<p>
   But his government faces severe problems with the economy and
food supply.
<p>
   With its farm industry devastated by three years of disastrous
weather, reclusive North Korea is now accepting foreign aid to
avert a famine that U.N. officials say could threaten millions of
lives.

<TEXT>
<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  The lawyer for Maurice Papon, the former
French Cabinet minister accused of crimes against humanity during
World War II, said Thursday his client cannot possibly get a fair
trial and asked that proceedings be halted.
<p>
   ``The trial cannot go on, and I ask you to free Maurice Papon,''
Jean-Marc Varaut told the court on the second day of the trial.
``That will be justice.''
<p>
   Varaut's 50-minute appeal followed a recommendation from
court-appointed medical experts that Papon be removed from prison
and detained in a cardiology unit of a hospital.
<p>
   Papon, 87, said Wednesday that he could not withstand
confinement in prison during the proceedings, referring to it as
``the unbearable weight of detention.'' The trial is expected to
last into December.
<p>
   Presiding Judge Jean-Louis Castagnede said a decision on whether
to keep Papon in prison would be announced on Friday.
<p>
   State prosecutor Henri Desclaux read the conclusions of the
court-appointed medical team charged with examining Papon.
<p>
   Detention is not incompatible with Papon's state of health, but
``given his heart conditions, the risks would be reduced if he were
placed under surveillance in a cardiology unit,'' Desclaux told the
court, reading the medical expertise.
<p>
   Papon has been held at Gradignan Prison since Tuesday night. He
underwent triple bypass heart surgery last year and is on
medication.
<p>
   Papon is the most senior French official ever to stand trial for
his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews. He is charged
with crimes against humanity while serving France's pro-Nazi Vichy
regime during World War II.
<p>
   Varaut said the jury could not remain impartial in the face of
what he said were slanted press reports, interviews and books and
the fact that many witnesses, including Papon's superiors, are
dead.
<p>
   However upright the jury, their ``hearts and minds'' risk being
influenced by the climate, the attorney said.
<p>
   Varaut told the court that he himself had been the victim of an
aggression Wednesday and was now under police protection. He did
not elaborate.
<p>
   He is seeking to allow himself and Papon to stay together in a
house in a peaceful Bordeaux suburb if the trial must continue.
<p>
   ``The trial, which is supposed to be conducted within these four
walls, is taking place on the steps of the (courthouse),'' Varaut
told the court, referring to interviews with the news media by
civil parties and their lawyers.
<p>
   The long-awaited trial could shed light on the Vichy
administration's treatment of Jews during World War II.
<p>
   Papon became the highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy
regime to stand trial on charges he committed crimes against
humanity as a police supervisor in Bordeaux during World War II.
<p>
   Papon is charged with signing the arrest orders and preparing
the convoys that sent 1,690 Jews, including 223 children, to their
deaths in Nazi camps.
<p>
   After the war, Papon went on to a prominent career in government
 &MD;  as Paris police chief under then President Charles de Gaulle and
later budget minister under conservative President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing. He enjoyed protection at the highest levels even after a
newspaper revealed his wartime record in 1981.
<p>
   In 1994, the late President Francois Mitterrand admitted he had
stepped in to delay proceedings against Papon.
<p>
   Lawyers representing several hundred victims' families,
Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups, who have waited 16 years for
the trial, oppose Papon's request.
<p>
   ``I can't stand the idea of Papon going to a five-star hotel
every night after the hearings,'' said Therese Stopnicki, a civil
party in the case. Her two sisters, aged 2 and 5, were arrested by
Papon.
<p>
   ``It's his way of thumbing his nose at us, of literally going
free, after all we've gone through to bring him to trial.''

<p>
   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP)  &MD;  Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq's haul
of five wickets for 126 helped Pakistan restrict South Africans to
359 for six on the fourth day of the first cricket test Thursday
and sent the match to almost certain draw.
<p>
   After losing six wickets for 282 runs, Dave Richardson and Shaun
Pollock halted the collapse. The pair steadied the innings with an
unbeaten seventh-wicket partnership of 77 by the end of play.
<p>
   When stumps were drawn off four overs before the scheduled close
due to fading light, Pollock was unbeaten on 35 while Richardson
was batting on 30.
<p>
   Mushtaq tore the South African middle-order apart but not before
opener Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis were involved in a tenacious
century second-wicket stand to help visitors avoid the follow-on.
Pakistan made 456 in their first innings, thanks to two debut
centuries by Azhar Mehmood and Ali Naqvi.
<p>
   Pakistan's hopes of making South Africa bat again were dashed
once overnight batsmen Jacques Kallis and Western Province
30-year-old Kirsten survived the first session.
<p>
   The pre-lunch period saw the pair adding another 66 runs to
their team's overnight total of 139 for one. On a docile wicket
where only an occasional delivery spun sharply, the South African
batting duo dug out 14 overs of leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed.
<p>
   However, the home team had a fruitful second period when
off-spinner Mushtaq claimed three wickets and allowed Hansie
Cronje's team to add only 54 runs.
<p>
   Mushtaq got rid of both Kirsten and Kallis in space of his 11
deliveries. First he got a lucky leg before verdict on Kallis from
umpire Javed Akhtar when the ball seemed to have going down the leg
side.
<p>
   Kallis put on 114 runs in the company of Kirsten in 213 minutes
and his maiden test half century  &MD;  61  &MD;  comprised six fours. Ijaz
Ahmed then took a sharp catch at second slip to dismiss Kirsten off
Mushtaq with the total on 228.
<p>
   Kirsten was unlucky to miss his fifth test century by just two
runs. His innings of 98 came off 344 balls and he stayed at the
wicket for seven hours.
<p>
   Cullinan, who was dropped by Inzamam ul-Haq off Saqlain in the
slip cordon while on 14, also departed in a controversial manner as
umpire Akhtar ruled him out leg before off Mushtaq. The TV replays
showed the ball clearly pitching outside the leg stump.
<p>
   Debutante medium fast bowler Mehmood got his first wicket in tst
cricket when captain Cronje (24) was smartly caught by Ahmed at
point. Mushtaq then completed his five-wicket haul when he removed
Brian McMillan (7) as Ahmed took his third catch of the innings.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Pakistan's regular wicketkeeper, Moin Khan, developed
a back problem during the first session and part-timer Mohammed
Wasim replaced him for the remainder of the day.
<p>
   Wasim had difficult behind the wickets and conceded 13 byes.
Although he stumped Dave Richardson of Mushtaq, umpire Akhtar
declared it a no-ball as the bowler's front foot was well over the
crease.

Burmese junta leader publishes book
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  Burma's military government will
publish a book containing wisdom dispensed by the regime's top
general, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
<p>
   The book will be ``a collection of guidance (excerpts) given by
Senior General Than Shwe,'' who since 1992 has been chairman of the
State Law and Order Restoration Council, the official name of the
military government, the paper said.
<p>
   The New Light of Myanmar is the country's only English-language
newspaper and is tightly controlled by the military government. It
devotes much of its space to photos and stories about Than Shwe,
usually inspecting development projects.
<p>
   The stories rarely quote the 65-year-old Than Shwe but almost
always contain the sentence: ``The senior general gave guidance.''
They are accompanied by photos of him pointing to something in the
distance as junior officers and officials eagerly look on.
<p>
   ``The senior general's guidance deals with areas such as
building of a peaceful, prosperous, modern and developed nation,
expediting economic growth, development of agricultural sector,
development of industrial sector and the need for the government
employees to work hard,'' the paper said.
<p>
   Although the paper said the book will published soon, it did not
give a publication date.
<p>
   The book will be sold at the News and Periodicals Department and
the offices of the State Law and Order Restoration Council in
Rangoon.

   Here is a summary of late financial news from The Associated
Press. Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the
items below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Southeast Asian currencies rallied against the
U.S. dollar Thursday, but Asian stock markets closed mixed. The
Philippine peso's climb was so steep, it hit a 4 percent volatility
limit that caused currency trading to be halted for the day.
Philippine stocks also closed sharply higher as declining interest
rates and the stronger peso propped up the market for a second day,
traders said. The 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged
58.67 points, or 3 percent, and closed at 2,005.5, after gaining
26.2 points Wednesday. When currency trading was suspended at
midafternoon, the peso averaged 34.852 pesos per dollar, compared
to its record low of 35.565 pesos on Wednesday. Share prices
elsewhere closed higher in Bangkok, Thailand; Jakarta, Indonesia;
Wellington, New Zealand; and Taiwan; and lower in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia; Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul and Sydney. (ASIAN

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. energy company Enron Corp.
will join a US dlrs 500 million coal slurry pipeline project in
China, an Australian company involved in the plan said Thursday.
MRI Holdings, a small Australian company that has a stake in China
Pipeline Holdings, said in a statement it and other shareholders of
China Pipeline Holdings signed a shareholders' agreement with Enron
International China CP, a unit of the U.S. energy and pipeline
company. Enron will contribute expertise and experience in project
financing, pipeline construction and operation. The restructuring
of China Pipeline Holdings ``has the support of the relevant
authorities of the Chinese government,'' MRI said.

   OAK BROOK, Illinois (AP)  &MD;  McDonald's Corp. plans to invest dlrs
1 billion in Latin America during the next three years, including
almost doubling the number of restaurants to 2,000. In 1996, sales
in Latin America contributed 4 percent of McDonald's operating
income, and that amount is expected to increase this year, Ed
Sanchez, McDonald's International senior vice president, said
Wednesday. Sales for the more than 1,000 restaurants in 27
countries in the region are expected to reach dlrs 1.5 billion by
the end of this year, McDonald's said. The company said it employs
almost 75,000 people in Latin America. McDonald's, the world's
largest fast-food chain, opened its first Latin American restaurant
in 1967 in Puerto Rico. McDonald's is based in Oak Brook, Illinois.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd.
(CBA) revealed Thursday it had lost ``several million'' of a US
dlrs 30 million (Australian dollars 40 million) equity stake in an
Indonesian banking joint venture because of Indonesia's currency
turmoil. The crisis in the Indonesian rupiah and stock market had
also forced a delay in release of new banking products to the
Indonesian commercial and retail markets, the bank said. The PT
Bank BII Commonwealth, a 50-50 joint venture between the CBA and
the private bank Bank Internaisonal Indonesia, was granted a
banking license in June. Michael Katz, CBA's head of institutional
banking, said Thursday the currency crisis had meant there had been
a ``translation loss'' on the equity which would amount to several
million dollars. President and managing director of PT Bank BII
Commonwealth, Bill Foxlee, defended the joint venture, saying it
had plenty of capital. (AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA-BANK LOSS)

   BOMBAY, India (AP)  &MD;  Trading on India's National Stock Exchange
resumed Thursday after a four-day interruption due to a failing
communications satellite. The Bombay exchange shifted its
operations to the Insat 2A satellite, and opened trading at 9:30
a.m. Thursday. Trading was suspended for a few hours for
adjustments to Insat 2A in the early afternoon, but that
interruption had been expected. The stock exchange, India's
state-run television and the government's Department of
Telecommunication had all been affected by problems with another
satellite, the Insat 2D. That satellite was abandoned Sunday after
a break in the power supply caused it to lose its directional lock
on the earth. The stock exchange, where roughly 40 percent of
India's transactions are conducted, closed trading early Friday
after the satellite trouble first surfaced. (INDIA-STOCK EXCHANGE)

   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. power giant Enron plans to make
India the hub of its power and gas operations in Asia by investing
more than dlrs 5 billion, news reports said Thursday. Enron hopes
to complete the first phase of a plant near Bombay ahead of
schedule and also speed up establishing a larger second unit to
make the dlrs 1.2 billion project the largest private sector power
unit in India, the Pioneer newspaper reported. Enron has now set up
a 100 percent subsidary, Enron India Ltd., to handle its power, gas
supply and marketing projects. Enron's plans for expanding
investment in India come despite court troubles it has faced here.
Work on the plant near Bombay was stalled after Enron was accused
of securing the contract through bribes, charges of which the
company was cleared in court. (INDIA-ENRON)

Most of Tanzania to go without power for five days a week
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP)  &MD;  Most of Tanzania will have to go
without power 18 hours a day, five days a week until enough rain
falls to fill a key reservoir.
<p>
   The order issued Wednesday by the state-owned Tanzania Electric
Supply Co. (Tanesco) took effect immediately but many didn't learn
about it until Thursday because of the power blackout.
<p>
   According to the rationing schedule released by Tanesco, most of
the urban residential areas in the East African nation of 30.6
million will be without power from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight. The sun
generally sets around 6:30 p.m. because of the country's proximity
to the Equator.
<p>
   Many small industries will be affected by the unwelcome move
which Tanesco said was necessary to conserve the little water
remaining at Mtera reservoir in Iringa region in the southern
highlands ``until the next rainy season.''
<p>
   After the long rains from mid-March to mid-May failed, there is
growing concern over the arrival and abundance of the short rains,
which should normally fall from mid-October to December.
<p>
   Tanzania is suffering from a severe drought that has forced the
government to import grain to beef up emergency food reserves.
<p>
   A Tanesco statement said power would be disconnected in Dar es
Salaam and other cities and towns except at major government
offices, banks, embassies and tourist hotels.
<p>
   Industrialists have blamed the government for mismanagement and
intentional negligence which has led to the country's power crisis.
<p>
   Juma Mwapachu, a representative of the Confederation of Tanzania
Industries told Industries and Minerals minister Abdallah Kigoda
that had the government been serious about finding a solution to
the power problem, there would not be one today.
<p>
   Mwapachu said plans linking Tanzania's electricity supply grid
to neighboring countries that have power surpluses have been on the
drawing board for years, but the government has done nothing to put
them into effect.
<p>
   But Kigoda assured the CTI members that the entire country would
not be plunged into darkness while the government was working on
ways to bring in more power.
<p>
   He said the power supply would be boosted by offshore barges to
be brought in by Malaysian investors to produced between 80 to 100
megawatts of power.
<p>
   A similar arrangement in neighboring Kenya using a barge
furnished by the Malaysian consortium Westmont Holdings has run
into strong criticism by the International Monetary Fund because of
irregularities in awarding the contract.

NATO parliament head calls for extended NATO presence in Bosnia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  The head of the North Atlantic
Assembly on Thursday urged NATO to stay in Bosnia past June, when
its mandate to help keep the peace expires.
<p>
   Assembly secretary-general Simon Lunn invoked the ``lessons of
the past'' as he called for a continued NATO presence at the first
meeting of NATO's parliamentary arm in a former Soviet bloc
country.
<p>
   The assembly has no direct power but can draw up recommendations
to the North Atlantic Council  &MD;  NATO's top decision-making body.
<p>
   Although there is developing consensus on the need to keep NATO
troops in Bosnia past June among member nations, the United States
is reluctant to commit soldiers past then and the Europeans are
unenthusiastic about staying if American troops don't.
<p>
   Among agenda items at this assembly meeting are the costs of
NATO expansion and other economic problems, security in the Balkans
and the situation in Bosnia. Special talks will focus on NATO
relations with Moscow.
<p>
   In July, the alliance invited formerly communist Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary to become full members by 1999.
<p>
   Romania made strenuous efforts to join but was told it was not
ready. However, it was praised for progress made in a relatively
short time and is thought to be a contender for future membership.
It is keen to play an active role in NATO events in hopes that will
increase future chances of membership.
<p>
   Some 250 lawmakers from NATO and former Soviet bloc countries
are meeting in the palace built by the late Communist dictator,
Nicolae Ceausescu.
<p>
   Since his overthrow and execution during the 1989 anti-communist
revolt, the huge white palace has hosted the likes of pop star
Michael Jackson, Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
<p>
   NATO chief Javier Solana will arrive Monday for the closing
session of the five-day conference.

<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A day after break-the-ice talks by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, the two sides neared agreement Thursday on the release of
tax revenues Israel has been withholding.
<p>
   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said after a meeting
with Israel's finance ministry director-general, Shmuel Slavin,
that he was told Israel would release the withheld revenues, an
estimated 170 million shekels (dlrs 49 million), as soon as
possible.
<p>
   Israeli officials said the money could be handed over to the
Palestinians next week if remaining details could be worked out.
<p>
   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said there was no
official decision yet, but that there there was an improved
atmosphere after Wednesday's early morning summit meeting.

German players and coaches reject suggestions to ban tackling
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  German players and coaches united
Thursday in rejecting suggestions to outlaw tackling in soccer.
<p>
   ``Tackling from behind must be dealt with more harshly. But
soccer entirely without tackling would be sad. A healthy doze of
hardness simply belongs in the game,'' said striker Oliver
Bierhoff, who plays for Udinese in Italy.
<p>
   Defenders, who use tackling to challenge strikers, and forwards,
who are usually on the receiving end, both agreed that banning
tackling altogether would completely change the game.
<p>
   Sepp Blatter, FIFA general secretary, said in an interview
published Wednesday that soccer officials were thinking of banning
tackling to protect top stars from rough defenders.
<p>
   But German coaches and players thought this would be a wrong
move.
<p>
   ``Soccer involves body contact. The referees should be schooled
better in protecting forwards, although this has been positive in
the last few years,'' said the Borussia Dortmund midfielder Andreas
Moeller.
<p>
   Most tackling from behind already results in a red card.
<p>
   Klaus Toppmoeller, coach of Bochum, said tackling belongs to
soccer ``just like goals.''
<p>
   ``Players are already punished enough when they receive yellow
or red cards for tackling from behind or from the sides,'' he said.
<p>
   National team coach Berti Vogts also said the proposal was
unrealistic. ``Forwards are already protected well enough by
referees these days,'' said Vogts, who was known as the ``Terrier''
in his playing days for his dogged pursuit of forwards. ``But I
never ended anybody's career.''

Workers of aircraft manufacturer strike for second day
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Thousands of employees of Indonesia's
only aircraft maker stayed on strike for a second day Thursday to
back demands for higher pay.
<p>
   At least 5,000 workers were on strike, and hundreds of them were
gathering at the main management building of the company, IPTN,
said an officer in the company's communication department.
<p>
   ``It seems that they will spend this night here, waiting for
Habibie, who is scheduled to come here Friday,'' said the officer,
who refused to be identified. ``The others plan to rejoin them
tomorrow.''
<p>
   He was referring to company president B.J. Habibie, who is also
Indonesia's minister of research and technology.
<p>
   He said workers of almost all of the company's divisions were on
strike.
<p>
   ``The problem is that there have been no salary increases since
1990,'' he told the Associated Press.
<p>
   He said there was a wide gap between supervisors and their
subordinates in the amount of allowances paid, regardless of length
of service. He said allowances ranged from 25,000 to 500,000
rupiahs (dlrs 7 to dlrs 142).
<p>
   It was believed to be the first protest by workers of the
state-owned aircraft company.
<p>
   IPTN is based in Bandung, the West Java capital, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Jakarta. The total size of its
work force was not immediately available.

Russia opens investigation into helicopter attack, Turkey denies

<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia said Thursday it was investigating an
attack on one of its military helicopters from gunmen in Turkish
territory, but Turkish officials denied that the shooting ever took
place.
<p>
   Russian officials have said that the border guards' Mi-8
helicopter was seriously damaged when it came under rifle fire
shortly after take off Wednesday in southwestern Georgia, near the
border with Turkey.
<p>
   In another incident, border guards in neighboring Armenia came
under automatic weapons fire from Turkish territory, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported Thursday. No casualties were reported. It was
unclear when the shooting took place.
<p>
   Russia's Federal Border Service dispatched a task force to
western Georgia Thursday to investigate the attack on the
helicopter, ITAR-Tass said.
<p>
   The service's deputy commander, Lt. Gen. Alexander Manilov,
blamed the attack on a ``lack of discipline'' among Turkish border
guards, the Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   In Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said the
shooting never happened.
<p>
   ``We have made our own investigation,'' Akbel told The
Associated Press.
<p>
   Russian border guards said the helicopter was hit eight times,
including twice in the fuel tank, but nobody was injured.
<p>
   The helicopter had flown down from the Russian city of Adler to
evacuate a sick border guard from a post in Batumi, a Black Sea
port in southwestern Georgia, and had one medic aboard, ITAR-Tass
reported.
<p>
   Russian troops help guard the borders in Georgia, a former
Soviet republic. Russian peacekeepers also are deployed in the
separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia.

BC-Egypt-Bones of Contention
Artist detained after exhibiting statue with human bones
By YASMINE ALI SALEH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An artist who hoped to win a prize with an
unusual statue that incorporated human and animal bones wound up
instead in police custody charged with desecration of the dead.
<p>
   Problems for 30-year-old artist Ahmed Desouki Korali began when
his composite figure went on display earlier this week at the Ninth
Exhibition for Young Artists in Cairo.
<p>
   The statue  &MD;  which included human arm and leg bones, a cat's
scull and a sheep's spine  &MD;  had a covering of transparent polyester
to create a figure similar to an ancient Egyptian sculpture of a
man.
<p>
   Egyptian mummies have been a recurring theme in Korali's work.
<p>
   Viewers became alarmed looking at the statue, and judges at the
exhibition called the police, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported
Thursday. He later was released on 500 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 147)
bail.
<p>
   An undertaker, identified only by the first name Samir, also was
detained for acquiring the human bones for the work, apparently
from the Khanka cemetery in central Cairo, the paper said.
<p>
   Korali could not be reached for comment.
<p>
   But Abdel-Hamid Saeed, a friend of the artist, told The
Associated Press that he doesn't believe Korali intended to show
disrespect.
<p>
   ``An artists thinks of the components that make up his project
as elements, not as bones,'' said Saeed, who is a filmmaker.
``Korali probably did not intend any disrespect for the dead. One
must think of the idea behind the statue and not necessarily the
elements that make up the statue.''
<p>
   He said, however, that he does not approve of tampering with
graves under any circumstances.
<p>
   Art critic Fatma Ismail said she felt the statue was in poor
taste.
<p>
   ``Desecrating the dead is a common and accepted theme in film
and literature, but for a virtual artist it turns into a crime when
he incorporates the tangible with the thought,'' she told The AP.
<p>
   The statue has been taken for examination by Egyptian forensic
officials.
<p>
   Tampering with the dead is against the law in Egypt. Islam and
Christianity, the two main religions in Egypt, also call for
respecting the dead.
<p>
   Two years ago, Korali won first prize in sculpture at the
Exhibition for Young Artists.

IAEA report does not clear Iraq on nuclear program
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Iraq could still be hiding some nuclear
secrets because it has not provided a full picture of its atomic
program, the U.N. atomic energy said Thursday.
<p>
   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency sent a
report to the U.N. Security Council last week, which will be
discussed in further detail when IAEA director-general Hans Blix
speaks to the Security Council Oct. 16, agency spokesman David Kyd
said.
<p>
   In the report, ``the IAEA is not expressing the view that Iraq
has provided a full, final and complete declaration of its
clandestine nuclear program,'' Kyd said.
<p>
   Iraq wants the Security Council to lift sanctions imposed after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, insisting it has
complied with all U.N. requirements.
<p>
   Kyd's statement followed a similar declaration by Blix last
month at the IAEA's annual general conference.
<p>
   There, Blix said that ``the blank spots in this picture have
become fewer ... but it's not impossible that some equipment might
be undetected.''
<p>
   Kyd said that the IAEA report, encompassing an overview of what
the agency has learned in its six years of inspecting the Iraqi
facilities, was forwarded to theU.N. headquarters in New York last
week.
<p>
   Iraq is under U.N. orders to scrap nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons programs and long-range missiles as part of the
international policing imposed on it after the 1991 Gulf War.

New logo symbol of worldwide consensus, says trade chief

<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  Renato Ruggiero, Director-General of the
132-member World Trade Organization, Thursday unveiled a new logo
for the trade body.
<p>
   The emblem comprises six red, green and blue arcs representing
the globe.
<p>
   The winning logo was selected from over 200 international
entries in a competition held by the Singapore government.
<p>
   It symbolizes ``member nations meeting to forge strategic
alliances,'' according to Su Yeang, whose firm designed the logo.
<p>
   It is, said Ruggiero, ``a symbol that we do not want just a
partial system'' of global commerce under the WTO, which superseded
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on Jan. 1, 1995.
<p>
   Ruggiero expressed optimism for progress in long-running talks
over China's entry to the international body.
<p>
   ``Because people have chosen market economies, because nations
have chosen to liberalize their economies, we are in a situation in
which we have now a prospect of 4.5 percent (world economic) growth
in the medium term, with the developing countries having double the
growth of the advanced economies.''

Orix edges Hawks 7-6 in 11 innings
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Yasuo Fujii hit the tying and winning home runs and
Willie Fraser pitched two innings of scoreless relief as the
Pacific League's Orix BlueWave edged the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 7-6 in
11 innings at Kobe Thursday.
<p>
   The Hawks went ahead 6-3 in the top of the ninth inning on
Hiroki Kokubo's two-run home run.
<p>
   But in the bottom of the inning, pinch hitter Fujii's homer
after two walks tied the game 6-6.
<p>
   Then, with two outs in the 11th inning, Fujii won it with his
18th homer of the season.
<p>
   Fraser, who formerly played for the Montreal Expos, held the
Hawks to one hit in the last two innings and picked up the victory,
evening his record at 9-9.
<p>
   Kokubo has 36 homers, one behind the league leader, former
Cleveland Indians player Nigel Wilson of the Nippon Ham Fighters.
<p>
   The Fighters have finished all their scheduled games this
season, but the Hawks have three more games and Kokubo can still
win the home run title.
<p>
   No other games were scheduled in either of Japan's two
professional baseball leagues.
<p>
   The best-of-seven Japan Series between the Central League
champion Yakult Swallows and the Pacific League pennant winner
Seibu Lions will start at Seibu Stadium on Oct. 18.

Israel may release more withheld tax revenues
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  A day after break-the-ice talks by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, the two sides neared agreement Thursday on the release of
tax revenues Israel has been withholding.
<p>
   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said after a meeting
with Israel's finance ministry director-general, Shmuel Slavin,
that he was told Israel would release the withheld revenues, an
estimated 170 million shekels (dlrs 49 million), as soon as
possible.
<p>
   Israeli officials said the money could be handed over to the
Palestinians next week if remaining details were worked out.
<p>
   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said no official
decision had been made yet, but that the atmosphere had improved
atmosphere after Wednesday's early morning summit meeting.
<p>
   According to the Oslo peace agreement, Israel is obligated to
hand over customs duties and other taxes levied on Palestinian
imports and purchases.
<p>
   Netanyahu cut off the flow of tax revenue to the Palestinian
Authority after two Islamic suicide bombers killed 16 shoppers and
the bombers at a Jerusalem market on July 30. He released some of
the funds earlier under U.S. pressure.
<p>
   The United States criticized Netanyahu for withholding the
funds. American officials said the cut-off did not help Israel's
security and merely weakened the Palestinian Authority.
<p>
   Israel will also announce plans to allow Arafat to land at the
new airfield at Dahaniye in the Gaza Strip, according to Israel
radio.
<p>
   However, the Israelis have not yet agreed to allow the
Palestinians to open the new airport to international flights.
<p>
   A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Netanyahu's envoy, Yitzhak Molcho, and the speaker of the
Palestinian legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, were negotiating the
question of Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
<p>
   The withdrawals were promised by Israel in peace accords, but
after two recent bombings in Jerusalem Netanyahu suspended any
further pullbacks until Israel's security demands were met.
<p>
   Fogel said Israel's decision stands but left open the
possibility of flexibility in the future, noting Palestinian
security cooperation had improved.
<p>
   Israel radio said Israel is also prepared to discuss a temporary
suspension of a controversial Jewish housing project in east
Jerusalem in return for Palestinian acquiescence in the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
<p>
   Israel would promise that the construction would be close to the
existing settlements. They would not be new neighborhoods on
distant hills which the Palestinians regard as new settlements in
all but name.
<p>
   However, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the report was
``sheer nonsense.'' He said the two sides were discussing a
definition of the American call for a ``time-out'' in Jewish
settlement building.
<p>
   Netanyahu said withholding the funds and other measures imposed
were aimed at forcing Arafat to clamp down on the militants of the
Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups.
<p>
   In a move certain to anger Netanyahu, Arafat released from
prison a prominent member of Hamas, Mohammed Taha, the radio said.

Communist leader calls for no-confidence vote, but also offers
compromise
Eds: LEADS thoughout to UPDATE with parliament rejecting proposed
budget but compromising by creating conciliatory commission, grafs

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  The Communist Party leader pledged Thursday to
hold a no-confidence vote on President Boris Yeltsin's government
next week. But he also came up with a compromise that could resolve
the bitter dispute over the 1998 budget.
<p>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told a news conference that
Yeltsin's economic policies were ``doomed to failure,'' and
reiterated plans for a no-confidence vote next week, possibly on
Thursday.
<p>
   But Zyuganov also proposed a conciliatory commission made up of
lawmakers and government representatives to hammer out differences
on next year's budget, the main point of contention at present.
<p>
   Parliament rejected the government's draft budget later
Thursday, but backed away from outright confrontation by also
voting 326-13 to create such a commission.
<p>
   The commission will try to reconcile Yeltsin's goal of an
austere budget that limits spending with the communists' desire to
increase the amount of money for social programs.
<p>
   Even if the Duma passes a no-confidence measure next week, it
would not have any immediate impact. The chamber must pass a second
no-confidence measure within three months in order to force Yeltsin
into making a choice: dismiss his cabinet or dismiss parliament and
hold new parliamentary elections.
<p>
   Despite his sharp criticism of the Yeltsin administration,
Zyuganov also said the government had enough ``honest, decent
people'' and it's only necessary ``to create conditions to allow
these people to work.''
<p>
   This year's debate over the budget is similar to the battles
waged in recent years. Ultimately, the two sides have worked out
behind-the-scenes compromises and many observers expect the same
outcome this year despite the heated rhetoric.
<p>
   Yeltsin has made clear he is prepared to dissolve the lower
house and call new elections if no-confidence motions are passed.
<p>
   He has repeatedly assailed the Duma for blocking his economic
plans, which include calls for tax reform and expanded land
ownership rights.
<p>
   The budget calls for sharp spending cuts and forecasts overall
economic growth of 2 percent in 1998. If achieved, it would mark
the first year of growth after six years of decline.
<p>
   ``This budget is quite realistic,'' First Deputy Finance
Minister Vladimir Petrov said in a speech before the lawmakers
Thursday.
<p>
   But there was no chance the budget would pass outright Thursday
because all the major factions, including the pro-government Our
Home is Russia bloc, opposed the plan.
<p>
   Communists and their allies say the state subsidies are
necessary to save ailing Russian industries from total ruin and
help stimulate growth.
<p>
   ``The budget looks like that of an ill-developed country,'' said
Communist Yuri Maslyukov, who chairs the Duma's economic policy
committee.

Coke employees return to work under a temporary deal

   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Workers at a Coca-Cola bottling plant
agreed to temporarily halt a 5-day strike Thursday while union
officials sought to revoke a plan to lay off hundreds of workers.

temporary period of two weeks on the basis that the company will
find a favorable way out on the retrenchment plan,'' said Bala
Tampoe, president of the Ceylon Mercantile Union, which represents
most of the striking workers.
<p>
   Pure Beverages Co. Ltd., the local agent for Coke, fired 220
workers Sept. 29 after the labor department passed a plan to
retrench about one-third of the 900 employees. The company says
that the layoffs are part of a cost-cutting exercise.
<p>
   Operations at the plant, near Colombo, have been hampered since
the strike started on Oct. 3.
<p>
   Officials at Pure Beverages were not available for comment on
the latest deal.
<p>
   Tampoe also said that legal action will be initiated against the
labor commissioner's ruling that permitted the retrenchment.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Pure Beverages was wracked by a 12-week
strike after the closure of a money losing factory. The strike,
which caused a widespread shortage of the drink across Sri Lanka,
was resolved after the labor department intervened.
<p>
   Pure Beverages is owned by F and N Coca-Cola (Pvt) Ltd. of
Singapore.
<p>
   The company produces 24 million beverage bottles every month and
also bottles Fanta and Sprite for the local market.

Land mines movement tops Nobel Peace speculation
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  A high-profile group of anti-land mines
activists tops speculation ahead of Friday's Nobel Peace Prize
announcement. Others bet on Bosnian peace workers, Chinese
dissidents and a brave group of doctors.
<p>
   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines soared in public
awareness with the death of its most visible backer, Princess
Diana, in August, then rose even higher the next month with the
drafting of a global treaty banning mines.
<p>
   ``Obviously it would be a very big help,'' said Jody Williams,
leader of the campaign that has vowed to pressure the United States
and other reluctant countries into signing the treaty in December.
<p>
   Candian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who initiated the talks
process that led to the treaty, also is a favorite for the prize.
<p>
   But many others also are seen as having a good chance.
<p>
   Those include the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders;
Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton accord that brought a
sti--troubled peace to Bosnia; Balkan peace activists Selim
Beslagic, Vesna Pesic and Vesna Terselic; and Chinese dissidents
Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
<p>
   The five-member Norwegian awards committee works in deep
secrecy, refusing even to say who has been nominated for the prize.
But many groups or individuals who propose candidates publicize
their nominations.
<p>
   The silence has grown even deeper after the news media learned
the names of two of three winners of the 1994 prize in advance.
Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres shared that prize
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
<p>
   Since then, the media have been foiled in an annual guessing
game. In 1995, the winners  &MD;  Joseph Rotblat and his Pugwash
movement against nuclear weapons  &MD;  weren't even mentioned in
speculation. Last year, guesses included one winner, East Timorese
Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, but not the other, activist Jose
Ramos-Horta, also of East Timor.
<p>
   The deadline for nominating candidates is Jan. 31, and the
committee has been deliberating since then. So if the anti-land
mine campaign was on the short-list of candidates eight months ago,
then its recent success could help secure the prize. Otherwise,
events just before the prize seem to have little impact on the
decision.
<p>
   The state radio network NRK this weekend was betting on Doctors
Without Borders, a five-time nominee. The group, founded in 1971,
sends medical teams all over the world to offer help in conflicts
and catastrophes.
<p>
   In recent decades, the prize has often been used to encourage
peace efforts and human rights. The shaky peace in the Balkans and
China's pro-democracy movement both could use a nudge forward.
<p>
   For the past two years, speculation has leaned heavily toward a
prize acknowledging peace efforts in the Balkans. Holbrooke is one
possible winner, although the committee seldom honors peace
mediators anymore.
<p>
   So it might look to others who have worked for peace in the
region, such as Beslagic, mayor of the Bosnian city of Tuzla;
Pesic, an anti-war activist in Serbia, and Terselic, a peace
activist in Croatia.
<p>
   Mere speculation about the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize going to
Chinese dissidents brought sharp reactions from Beijing, which
warned Norway this week that it would take a very dim view of an
award to activists Wei or Wang.
<p>
   The committee seems deaf to threats, and has even said it
welcomes controversy about what is often a political prize.
<p>
   Other potential winners mentioned include former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, Cambodian monk Maha
Ghosananda for his peace efforts, the Salvation Army and the
Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia.
<p>
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, a Swede who invented
dynamite and used his fortune to endow the Nobel prizes. The other
Nobel prizes are presented the same day in Stockholm, Sweden.

Irish and British ministers to discuss Northern Ireland at Summit
With BC-Council of Europe Summit
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and his
British counterpart Tony Blair will review advances in the Northern
Ireland peace process at a meeting Friday during the Council of
Europe summit.
<p>
   The two leaders are expected to have a pre-lunch bilateral
meeting in the French city of Strasbourg, government officials said
Thursday.
<p>
   At the two-day conference, presidents and prime ministers from
40 European nations will be grappling with issues confronting the
new Europe.
<p>
   Ahern and Blair have been in regular telephone contact in the
run up to Tuesday's start of full-scale negotiations on Northern
Ireland's future.
<p>
   The British and Irish governments, the co-sponsors of the
negotiations, have set a May deadline for concluding a new
political settlement on the province's future.
<p>
   The government said Ireland's new Foreign Minister, David
Andrews, will lead the country's delegation at the talks in Belfast
next Tuesday.
<p>
   Ahern moved Andrews from the Ministry of Defense to the Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday after the resignation of Ray Burke, 54, who
was embroiled in controversies over a political donation he
accepted and a deal with a Saudi sheik. Andrews served as foreign
minister in 1992-93.
<p>
   Negotiations are being conducted on three key issues  &MD;  the
internal government of Northern Ireland, relations between the
British-ruled north and the Irish Republic, and Anglo-Irish
relations.
<p>
   Eight political parties are participating in the talks,
including the IRA-allied Sinn Fein Party. The outlawed Irish
Republican Army, which draws support from Catholic parts of
Northern Ireland, has been observing a cease-fire since July 20,
which cleared the way for Sinn Fein to join the peace talks.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  A visiting Iraqi industrial delegation
has called for reviving trade with Lebanon and announced that an
exhibition of Lebanese industrial products will take place in
Baghdad next week.
<p>
   Iraq purchased 20 percent of Lebanon's exports before the United
Nations clamped economic sanctions on the country in 1990 to punish
it for invading neighboring Kuwait.
<p>
   The Iraqi businessmen arrived in Beirut on Sunday for a weeklong
visit, the first since the sanctions were imposed.
<p>
   Adnan al-Qudsi, chairman of Iraq's Union of Industrialists and
head of the Iraqi delegation, was quoted Thursday as saying the
exhibition of Lebanese products will open next Monday.
<p>
   He spoke to reporters after meeting with Foreign Minister Faris
Bweiz on Wednesday.
<p>
   Al-Qudsi also expressed hope for the resumption of ``economic
cooperation between the Iraqi and Lebanese private sectors'' under
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine.

   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP)  &MD;  National Bank of Bahrain, the largest
commercial bank on the island, said Thursday its net profit in the
first nine months of 1997 rose 15 percent to 12.1 million dinars
(dlrs 32 million) compared with the same period last year.
<p>
   The bank's net profit for the first nine months of 1996 was 10.5
million dinars (dlrs 28 million), the bank said in a statement.
<p>
   The banks assets in the first nine months rose nearly 20 percent
to 900.3 million dinars (dlrs 2.3 billion), the statement said.
<p>
   The bank did not explain the gains.
<p>
   NBB is 49 percent owned by the government of Bahrain. The
remaining shares are listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.

   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,644.2 at the end of the trading week Wednesday, 48.7
points higher than the previous week.
<p>
   Hassan Abdul-Rahim, financial analyst at the National
Investments Co., said liquidity has significantly increased with
the return of investors from their summer vacations. Activity rose
to pre-vacation levels, he said.
<p>
   Some 1.09 billion shares changed hands this week, up from 560.85
million last week. The value of these shares also shot up to 393.48
million dinars (dlrs 1.31 billion) from 198.80 million dinars (dlrs
662.66 million).
<p>
   The Kuwait Stock Exchange lists 72 companies, including eight
from neighboring Arab Gulf States.

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Egypt has earmarked 50 million pounds (dlrs
14.7 million) for projects to provide oil services to the new
Toshka Canal to be built in the South.
<p>
   The English-Language Egyptian Gazette said Thursday that the
first phase will involve setting up a depot on the canal to provide
construction crews with fuel.
<p>
   It quoted Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi as saying the depot also
will power electricity generating units.
<p>
   Phase two will involve providing fuel for farming and industrial
areas, the paper said.
<p>
   The government is building the canal to draw water from behind
the High Dam in Aswan to irrigate land in the Western Desert.
 &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL;

   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) - Share prices and trading fell on the stock
exchange this week because of political tensions following Israel's
bungled assassination attempt of a radical Muslim leader in Jordan.
<p>
   Brokers said Thursday the lull in trading followed an attempt by
an Israeli hit squad to kill Khalid Mashaal, a leader of the
Islamic movement Hamas, on Sept. 25.
<p>
   A market report, reflecting activity for six business days
ending Thursday, said the general share prices index fell by 1.37
percent to 173.73 points. The index is based on 60 major companies.
<p>
   Shares of commercial banks fell by 0.48 percent, the services
sector by 0.40 percent, industrial firms by 2.98 percent. But
shares of insurance companies rose by 0.49 percent.
<p>
   Turnover also fell by 46.2 percent to 5 million dinar (dlrs 7
million), the report said.
<p>
   Stocks of 90 companies were traded during the week.

Villeneuve ready to clinch his first title
AP Photos SUZ101-3
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SUZUKA, Japan (AP)  &MD;  For the second straight year, Jacques
Villeneuve has come to Suzuka with a chance to clinch the Formula
One championship. This time, he is determined not to let it slip
away.
<p>
   In last year's Japan Grand Prix, Villeneuve failed to finish the
race, losing his chance to become the youngest rookie to win the
title. Damon Hill of Britain won both the race and the season title
in a Williams-Renault.
<p>
   So Villeneuve, 26, wants to make sure nothing will go wrong,
even though he knows every single curve on the 5.864-kilometer
(3.636-mile) Suzuka Circuit from the 1992 season, when he lived in
Tokyo to compete in Japan's Formula Three.
<p>
   Villeneuve, a former IndyCar champion from Canada, overtook
rival Michael Schumacher of Germany in the drivers' standings by
winning the last two Grand Prix races  &MD;  in Austria and Luxembourg.
He now has a nine-point lead, 77-68.
<p>
   This means Villeneuve only needs to finish ahead of Schumacher's
Ferrari in the top six in Sunday's race to clinch the Formula One
title.
<p>
   If he wins, it will also give his team a record ninth
constructor's title.
<p>
   With the Sept. 28 victory in Luxembourg, ``everything fell in
place,'' Villeneuve said Thursday after inspecting his blue
Williams-Renault in the garage.
<p>
   ``Of course there is excitement, but it won't be over until the
end, and as you have seen in the last two races anything can happen
and it could all turn around again.
<p>
   ``You have to remind yourself to work as well as you did in the
last few races, without leaving anything to chance,'' he added.
<p>
   Winning the race is worth 10 points. A tie in the standings
would give the title to Villeneuve because he has won more races  &MD; 
seven to Schumacher's four. The 17-race season ends with the Grand
Prix of Europe on Oct. 26 in Jerez, Spain.
<p>
   But Schumacher hasn't given up hope for his third Formula One
season title.
<p>
   ``I will try to do my best. Mentally that is no problem. If
there is any problem at all, it comes from the car you have,''
Schumacher said. ``I have nothing to lose now. I will just go for
it, and if it works, it works.''
<p>
   Until the Austria GP on Sept. 21, Schumacher had led most of the
season, by up to 14 points.
<p>
   If Villeneuve takes the title on Sunday, he will be the seventh
champion determined in Suzuka since Formula One came to Honda's
home turf in 1987.

Central Bank raises interest rate to preempt inflation
Eds: UPDATES with additional Waigel comment, background; CORRECTS
that repo was at 3 percent since September, sted August, 1996; ADDS
byline
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates for the first time in over five years, calling it a
precautionary move against inflation.
<p>
   The Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase (repo) rates through Oct. 22, to 3.3 percent from 3
percent, to preempt higher inflation and help dampen growth in the
money supply.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the moves ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   Import prices rose 5.4 percent in August, the biggest jump since
1989. Especially affected are commodities priced in dollars on the
world market, such as petroleum products.
<p>
   The dollar, which has been retreating since hitting an
eight-year high of 1.891 against the mark on Aug. 6, fell another
pfennig immediately after the bank's announcement, to 1.7415 marks.
But dealers said the currency market's reaction was relatively
muted as the rate hike had been expected.
<p>
   Waigel also said that the upswing in the German economy won't be
damped by the Bundesbank's decision. Rates on long-term capital
loans to businesses, ``which are vital to investment and
employment,'' are not expected to be affected, he said in a
statement from Bonn.
<p>
   The Association of German Industry and Trade agreed, calling the
bank's decision ``moderate and appropriate.''
<p>
   The repo rate has become the Bundesbank's main instrument for
influencing the money market. It is the rate the Bundesbank charges
banks for buying back short-term securities when banks need cash
for daily operations.
<p>
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency
funds from the central banks and acts as an effective ceiling on
overnight rates. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank
refinancing.
<p>
   The last official interest rate increase was in July 1992, when
the discount rate was raised to 8.75 percent from 8 percent.
<p>
   Germany's discount rate has been at 2.5 percent and the Lombard
rate at 4.5 percent since April 1996.
<p>
   In August 1992, the repo rate, which then floated with the
market, averaged 9.7 percent from a previous average of 9.63. It
declined monthly after that until it settled at 3 percent in
September 1996. The Bundesbank fixed it at that rate this year
after it hadn't moved for six months.

interest rates unchanged for now  &MD;  good news for mortgage holders

<p>
   The bank's monetary policy committee said it will leave its base

<p>
   The benchmark rate stood at 6 percent before Blair took office,
but has since been raised by the Bank of England in hopes of

<p>
   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small tourist plane carrying nine people
crashed Thursday morning as it prepared to land at the airport in
Banjul, killing all but one person on board, an aviation official
said.
<p>
   The flight originated in Las Palmas, the principal city of Grand
Canary Island, one of a string of Spanish islands off the coast of
Morocco, said Claud Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil
Aviation Authority.
<p>
   He said the dead included both Spaniards and Germans. Sebastian
Drover, the Spanish vice consul in Banjul, said the two-person crew
was Spanish but had no details on the seven passengers.
<p>
   The crash happened at about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers short of the
airport in Banjul, the capital of this western African nation,
Jensen said.
<p>
   No information was available on the survivor.
<p>
   The cause of the crash was being investigated, Jensen said, but
noted that the airport had lost contact with the plane shortly
before the crash occurred.
<p>
   Citing sources in the Civil Aviation department, the Spanish
news agency EFE reported that the plane was owned by Naysa, a
company based in the Canary Islands.
<p>
   Encarna Fernandez, an official at Naysa in Las Palmas, confirmed
there was an accident involving one of the company's planes, but
said she had no further information.

IAEA report does not clear Iraq on nuclear program
Eds: UPDATES grafs 5-7, Iraqi non-compliance with other
inspections; grafs 10-12, security Council may consider further
sanctions

<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Iraq could still be hiding some nuclear
secrets because it has not provided a full picture of its atomic
program, the U.N. atomic energy said Thursday.
<p>
   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency sent a
report to the U.N. Security Council last week, which will be
discussed in further detail when IAEA director-general Hans Blix
speaks to the Security Council Oct. 16, agency spokesman David Kyd
said.
<p>
   In the report, ``the IAEA is not expressing the view that Iraq
has provided a full, final and complete declaration of its
clandestine nuclear program,'' Kyd said.
<p>
   Iraq wants the Security Council to lift sanctions imposed after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, insisting it has
complied with all U.N. requirements.
<p>
   But U.N. officials have recently stepped up complaints that Iraq
has not fully disclosed its non-conventional arms capabilities.
<p>
   Earlier this week, U.N. inspectors tracking Iraqi missile,
biological and chemical weaponry reported that Baghdad is still
withholding key details of its banned biological weapons program
and imposing unacceptable restrictions on U.N. inspections.
<p>
   Chief inspector Richard Butler said Iraq's claims last month
that it had made a ``full, final and complete'' disclosure of its
banned weapons programs were false and contained errors which were
``grave.''
<p>
   Kyd's statement on Thursday followed a similar declaration by
Blix last month at the IAEA's annual general conference.
<p>
   There, Blix said that ``the blank spots in this picture have
become fewer ... but it's not impossible that some equipment might
be undetected.''
<p>
   Kyd said that the IAEA report, encompassing an overview of what
the agency has learned in its six years of inspecting the Iraqi
facilities, was forwarded to theU.N. headquarters in New York last
week, where the Security Council is to discuss the latest reports.
<p>
   Last June, the council threatened to add travel restrictions to
the list of economic sanctions if Iraq failed to meet an October
deadline to comply with inspectors seeking information on the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
   It is now up to the United States and Britain, Iraq's strongest
council critics, to decide whether to seek new sanctions.
<p>
   Iraq is under U.N. orders to scrap nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons programs and long-range missiles as part of the
international policing imposed on it after the 1991 Gulf War.

Jews prepare for holy day by swinging chickens

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Swinging live chickens over their heads to cast
away sins in a symbolic gesture, Jews prepared Thursday for Yom
Kippur, or the Day of Atonement.
<p>
   The ritual is practiced by some devout Jews ahead of Yom Kippur,
the holiest day on the Jewish calendar marked by fasting and
prayer. Yom Kippur begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown
Saturday.
<p>
   In Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, men in
thin plastic aprons sold squawking chickens from hundreds of
colored crates stacked in the streets.
<p>
   Men with long black coats, black hats, beards and side locks
rocked back and forth as they recited blessings.
<p>
   ``On Yom Kippur, you're supposed to dispose of your sins,'' said
one man, who only gave his first name, Eli, as he swung his chicken
above his head.
<p>
   His wife Huvy scolded him for holding the chicken by the wings.
``You're supposed to hold it here,'' she said, pointing to the
bird's legs, which were bound with string.
<p>
   After the blessing the chickens were slaughtered with a
razor-sharp knife. Men in rubber boots hosed down the narrow street
to get rid of the blood and feathers.
<p>
   Many other Jews, including those belonging to other streams of
Orthodoxy, reject the practice as barbaric and based on
superstition. They note that rabbis have ruled that cash  &MD;  or,
recently, even credit cards  &MD;  may be used in the atonement ritual.
<p>
   Most of the Jews who use chickens give the birds to a charity
which distributes them to the poor, although some opt to keep the
chicken and donate money instead.
<p>
   The ritual, known as ``kapparot,'' or sacrifice of atonement,
has been practiced since the Middle Ages.
<p>
   ``We all would be ready to give away our lives because we are
very sorry for things we didn't do well,'' said one woman, sitting
on an empty crate as she waited for her chicken to be swung.
<p>
   ``God doesn't want us to give away our life, so when we kill the
chicken it should be for all our sins.''
<p>
   Bands of small children crowded around the crates, staring at
the chickens. One woman, Rivka, wearing a long purple dress and a
white head scarf, brought her 3-year-old son, Shalom, whose big
blue eyes were transfixed by the birds. ``He rarely sees live
animals,'' she said.
<p>
   The Ten Days of Penitence begin at the Jewish New Year and
culminate in Yom Kippur, when Jews abstain from food, drink and
work.

<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines biting political observation with side-splitting
comedy, won the Nobel Prize for literature Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, has written more than 70 plays. He
is best known for the plays ``Comic Mystery,'' ``Accidental Death
of an Anarchist'' and ``Can't Pay, Won't Pay.''
<p>
   ``With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed,'' the citation by the
Swedish Academy said.
<p>
   The prize this year is worth dlrs 1 million.
<p>
   Fo has long been a major figure in drama, but his winning the
prestigious prize could be considered a surprise choice; his name
generally has not been included on critics' lists of potential
winners.
<p>
   ``I am amazed,'' Fo said when reached by ANSA, the Italian news
agency.
<p>
   Fo said he learned of the prize while driving from Rome to
Milan, when someone in a nearby car held up a sign saying, ``Dario
has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   Fo's wife, actress Franca Rame, suggested to RAI state TV that
her husband may have been teasing with that story.
<p>
   The playwright, however, is well-known throughout Italy. He and
his wife also used to have a column in the weekly magazine of the
left-leaning Rome newspaper La Repubblica.
<p>
   Fo said he thought he was awarded the prize for his life's work,
and said he owed it partly to Rame, whom he married in 1954. The
couple founded a drama company together five years later.
<p>
   ``I'd like to think that the consistency of our discourse was
rewarded, or at least for years we have tried to be consistent,''
he said. ``I realize that sometimes we've made mistakes and we've
been too euphoric and light.
<p>
   ``This is the criticism I have for myself: to have sometimes
used a triumphal discourse to face the theme of class struggle,
even if by now only we call it that.''
<p>
   Rame said she and her husband knew they were in the running for
the Nobel but didn't expect to win. Even though they are artistic
partners, she said the prize was all his.
<p>
   ``It will pay him back for the many, many humiliations he
suffered in his life and along his cultural journey,'' she said.
``We have struggled a lot, even in dark years, suffering even
unjust criticism for our positions.''
<p>
   Fo was introduced to narrative traditions at an early age
through his grandfather, a well-known storyteller. At age 25, he
began to write and perform satirical cabarets at the Piccolo
Theater in Milan.
<p>
   His open opposition to the establishment and his associations
with left-wing groups often caused officials to ban his works from
state-run theaters in Italy.
<p>
   In 1980, Fo and his wife were refused entry visas into the
United States because of his support for left-wing activities in
Italy. In 1984, the Reagan government relented and allowed the
couple to visit New York briefly and see the New York production of
``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The play is based on right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in 1969,
which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers on a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who possesses
the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of officialdom,'' the
citation said.
<p>
   ``Comic Mystery,'' a monologue born out of the student revolts
of 1968, is still performed today with updating to touch on current
topics. The irreverent work ``re-wrote'' well-known New Testament
accounts such as Jesus' raising Lazarus back to life and the
marriage feast of Cana.
<p>
   Fo often performed in one-man shows, in which he appeared on
stage with his trademark black turtleneck and only a microphone for
a prop.
<p>
   He received the Copenhagen University's Sonning Prize award in
1981 for his contribution to European culture. Other recipients
include German writer Guenter Grass, Swedish film director Ingmar
Bergman and French novelist Simone de Beauvoir.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher,
called Fo a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He is a person who consciously tries to make performances that
appeal to the people,'' Linnell said. ``He both learns from the
people and gives back to the people.''
<p>
   The Italian Society of Drama Authors said it was ``happy that an
Italian contemporary author frequently discriminated against both
in Italy and abroad for his political intentions has been awarded
the Nobel.''
<p>
   ``We hope that this prize is felt by all those authors who write
today, facing difficulties of scant recognition respect to other,
easy forms of theatrical communication,'' it said.
<p>
   Famed Italian theater director Giorgio Strehler, who founded
Milan's Little Theater, said: ``Thanks to Dario Fo, we feel honored
as Europeans and as theater people.''
<p>
   The Swedish Academy keeps a tight lid on its deliberations,
saying only that it aims to recognize outstanding literature with
the prize. But few observers believe that's all academy members
have in mind.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans  &MD;  of the first 30 winners, there were only three women
and two non-Europeans  &MD;  the academy has spread the prize more
evenly by gender and wider by geography.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   The prize is the second of this year's Nobels to be announced.
The medicine prize was won Monday by American Stanley Prusiner for
discoveries related to brain-wasting diseases.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

Central Bank raises interest rate to preempt inflation
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9-10 with Danish central bank also increasing
rates.
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates for the first time in over five years, calling it a
precautionary move against inflation.
<p>
   The Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase (repo) rates through Oct. 22, to 3.3 percent from 3
percent, to preempt higher inflation and help dampen growth in the
money supply.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the moves ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   Import prices rose 5.4 percent in August, the biggest jump since
1989. Especially affected are commodities priced in dollars on the
world market, such as petroleum products.
<p>
   The dollar, which has been retreating since hitting an
eight-year high of 1.891 against the mark on Aug. 6, fell another
pfennig immediately after the bank's announcement, to 1.7415 marks.
But dealers said the currency market's reaction was relatively
muted as the rate hike had been expected.
<p>
   Waigel also said that the upswing in the German economy won't be
damped by the Bundesbank's decision. Rates on long-term capital
loans to businesses, ``which are vital to investment and
employment,'' are not expected to be affected, he said in a
statement from Bonn.
<p>
   The Association of German Industry and Trade agreed, calling the
bank's decision ``moderate and appropriate.''
<p>
   In Copenhagen, the Danish central bank raised its discount and
repurchase rates 0.25 percentage points to 3.50 and 3.75 percent
respectively, in a move widely expected following the Bundesbank
action.
<p>
   ``The increase occurs on the background of European interest
rate developments,'' a Danish central bank statement said.
<p>
   The repo rate has become the Bundesbank's main instrument for
influencing the money market. It is the rate the German central
bank charges banks for buying back short-term securities when banks
need cash for daily operations.
<p>
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency
funds from the central banks and acts as an effective ceiling on
overnight rates. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank
refinancing.
<p>
   The last official interest rate increase was in July 1992, when
the discount rate was raised to 8.75 percent from 8 percent.
<p>
   Germany's discount rate has been at 2.5 percent and the Lombard
rate at 4.5 percent since April 1996.
<p>
   In August 1992, the repo rate, which then floated with the
market, averaged 9.7 percent from a previous average of 9.63. It
declined monthly after that until it settled at 3 percent in
September 1996. The Bundesbank fixed it at that rate this year
after it hadn't moved for six months.

<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Italy won't have an inexperienced defense to pick on
this time. David Seaman and Tony Adams will make sure of that.
<p>
   Injuries forced the two Arsenal players out of England's 1-0
loss to Italy in February. But both are fit and will start
Saturday's World Cup qualifying rematch  &MD;  Seaman between the posts
and Adams at center-back, likely as captain.
<p>
   ``Any squad needs a spine, and they provide it,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said Thursday of his defensive stalwarts.
<p>
   The duo brings plenty of national team experience  &MD;  Seaman has
37 caps, Adams 47  &MD;  and an important familiarity that comes with
having been teammates at Arsenal since 1990.
<p>
   Seaman and Adams  &MD;  along with striker Ian Wright, expected to
start up front with Teddy Sheringham Saturday  &MD;  have helped Arsenal
take the lead in the Premier League through 10 games.
<p>
   Without them at Wembley, England left plenty of space for
sparkplug striker Gianfranco Zola. The diminutive Italian exploited
that, streaking by defender Sol Campbell and unleashing the winning
shot past backup 'keeper Ian Walker, who was making his first
international start.
<p>
   Hoddle said he has two fitness worries for Saturday's match:
midfielder David Beckham and defender Gareth Southgate, both
originally slotted for the starting 11.
<p>
   ``David has a heavy cold, and it's more than just a sniffle,''
the coach said.
<p>
   He declined to say what Southgate's injury is, but said the
Aston Villa defender  &MD;  guilty of a missed penalty against Germany
in England's Euro '96 semifinal flameout  &MD;  would skip practice
Thursday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Italy coach Cesare Maldini indicated Thursday he also
has two doubts for his lineup. The most vital is whether veteran
Ciro Ferrara, recovering from a muscle injury, can play. Maldini
said Ferrara ``still feels a little pain'' and his status will be
determines the day of the game.
<p>
   The other question is whether to start Diego Fuser or Attilio
Lombardo on the right side of the midfield.
<p>
   If Southgate can't go for England, Adams assumes a bigger burden
for directing the backline against an assault from an Italian side
that knows it must win to assure qualification.
<p>
   ``You don't get too many opportunities to play in the World Cup,
so it intensifies things,'' Adams, 30, said. ``This is the biggest
game. We've got to grab the occasion with both hands. If this game
doesn't motivate you then it's time to get out of the sport.''
<p>
   Adams hasn't had much game action this year because of the bad
ankle that held him out of the first Italy game. But he declared
himself ready this time.
<p>
   ``I would have loved to have Tony in the squad more times,''
Hoddle said. ``He's a player who can play his own game and also
help others.''
<p>
   Sheringham and Adams both said England's players are relaxed
going into the match, knowing the pressure is really on Italy.
<p>
   ``They should be worried about us because we're playing well and
they need to beat us,'' said Sheringham, who scored when Manchester
United beat Juventus of Turin 3-2 in an Oct. 2 Champions Cup match.
``It's a more important game for them. We're on top and they need
to get there.''

`Eliminate' meant `arrest', former apartheid cop says

<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  A top apartheid era police
official admitted Thursday that police used words like
``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' in their commands, but insisted
they were not orders to kill.
<p>
   Former police commissioner Johan van der Merwe told a hearing
into apartheid era abuses that the white government's State
Security Council never issued an instruction that resulted in gross
human rights violations, yet knew all the time they were being
carried out.
<p>
   Van der Merwe said he personally interpreted the words
``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' in an order to mean arrest and
detain a suspected anti-apartheid terrorist.
<p>
   But he conceded the orders could have easily been
misinterpreted.
<p>
   ``Police on the ground ... in a life and death struggle could
have seen (the word eliminate) as an order to kill,'' the former
police commander said.
<p>
   He was testifying on the third day of special hearings by the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate abuses by the
security forces of the previous white-minority government and the
armed wings of the black liberation movements seeking to overthrow
it.
<p>
   The panel, set up after 1994's first all race elections to heal
wounds from the apartheid era, has since last year been also
holding separate hearings to listen to victims' testimony and to
consider applications for amnesty.
<p>
   Van der Merwe's application for amnesty will be considered at a
separate time.
<p>
   Earlier in the day, Maj. Craig Williamson, a police spy for the
white government during the 1970s and 1980s, said the over-riding
concern among police officers was simply not to get caught doing
anything illegal.
<p>
   ``The eleventh commandment was well known ... this was `Thou
shalt not be found out','' he said.
<p>
   Williamson denied accusations by former police death squad
commander Eugene de Kock of being involved in the 1986 murder of
Swedish prime minister Olof Palme.
<p>
   But he admitted carrying out bombings on anti-apartheid
activists and said top police officials had always sought to
distance themselves from covert actions.
<p>
   ``They abdicated their responsibility to exercise close
operational supervision of such actions ... nevertheless, they can
never deny responsibility for the budgets used to fund covert
actions,'' Williamson said in a written statement.
<p>
   ``I had no doubt that secret violent and other actions against
the revolutionary enemy were an accepted and approved procedure,''
he wrote.
<p>
   Williamson said the police had fought so hard and dirty against
the ANC and its allies because they believed they were saving the
state from communism during the Cold War.
<p>
   ``We learnt and taught that communism was a religion and faith
which was messianic,'' he said.
<p>
   The fact that many of southern Africa's liberation movements
were Soviet-backed and the ANC was allied with the South African
Communist Party made it easier to commit violence against them
because they were seen as ``foreign,'' he added.

US official: Czech army must make army careers more attractive
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP)  &MD;  A U.S. defense official urged the
Czech government on Thursday to press ahead with new laws making
the army compatible with NATO and a military career more
attractive.
<p>
   Although the Czech republic, Poland and Hungary were invited
this summer to join, serious shortcomings in their militaries after
four decades of communism are alarming NATO experts.
<p>
   In the Czech republic's case, one of the problems is keeping
promising officers in the army  &MD;  many now leave because of lack of
opportunity, low pay and low prestige.
<p>
   U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Frederick Pang told reporters at
the end of a two-day seminar on military personnel policies that
the situation in the Czech military was not alarming because
``transition ... takes time.'' He added, however, that new laws
revamping the military are ``one of the keys to success in the
future.''
<p>
   The Czech Defense Ministry is working on eight laws on
restructuring the military service to meet NATO standards. One of
them is expected to set new pay structures and rules on military
education, promotion, training and benefits.
<p>
   The ministry is planning to present drafts of the laws to the
government by the end of this year and hopes for parliamentary
approval sometime next year.
<p>
   In veiled criticism, Pang said some people considered the pace
of introducing the new laws slow, ``but I know how at times the
legislative process does not work as fast as people would like.''

<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
seaboard Thursday with high winds and towering seas, packing 100
mph (160 kph) winds as it raced along Mexico's southwest resort
coast.
<p>
   As Pauline continued its furious trek up Mexico's resort coast
past Acapulco, President Ernesto Zedillo paused on a state visit to
Germany to order an emergency response plan for much of the
hard-hit coast.
<p>
   The government news agency Notimex said Zedillo dispatched
military and civil defense workers to southernmost Oaxaca and
Chiapas states, buffeted a day earlier by the first winds and rains
associated with Pauline.
<p>
   Reports of downed homes, roads severed by floodwaters and large
trees snapped or uprooted by the powerful Pacific hurricane
followed in its wake.
<p>
   ``It was very dramatic, something we had never seen here
before,'' said a hotel security guard, Nicanor Reyes, forced to
huddle overnight in the waterlogged Huatulco Sheraton with guests
as the storm raged past.
<p>
   He could not get home today because of severed roads and fretted
for the wife and five children he had left behind when Pauline
struck with 120 mph (193 kph) winds.
<p>
   ``I don't know what the situation is in my house. I think it's
normal to be worried,'' he said.
<p>
   Towering waves up to 30 feet (9.1-meters) tall had torn away the
beachfront of the Huatulco Sheraton and other bays. Tree limbs lay
everywhere under an overcast sky Thursday. Rain had driven into
many rooms and across the hotel lobby.
<p>
   Sheila Butler, of McAllen, Texas, said she hadn't seen a
hurricane so strong in her 78 years. ``We come from South Texas so
we've seen hurricanes before, but this was a real strong one.''
<p>
   No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. But telephone
communication to much of the coast was cut from Pauline's two-day
pummeling of the coast as it raked northwestward along the
shoreline.
<p>
   At 1500 GMT, Pauline was near Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and moving
quickly toward the west northwest near 15 mph (24 kph), the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
<p>
   The center also reported that a hurricane warning had been
rapidly extended northwestward from well below Acapulco to Puerto
Vallarta.
<p>
   Maximum sustained winds of about 100 mph (161 kph) were reported
with higher gusts over nearby mountains. Hurricane winds extended
out up to 35 miles (60 kilometers) and tropical storm force winds
outward up to 115 miles (185 kilometers), the Hurricane Center
said.
<p>
   After Pauline's passage, reports of flooding were reported in
Acapulco, a city of 2.9 million that is Mexico's most populous
Pacific resort.
<p>
   ``This is serious,'' said Amador Ramirez, a Televisa news
network correspondent describing people fleeing homes as
floodwaters coursed down streets.
<p>
   ``The streets are filling up with water. They are getting really
inundated. The water is practically washing away vehicles and
people are leaving their homes.'' Ramirez said.
<p>
   The Hurricane Center reported near-hurricane force winds raked
Acapulco before dawn Thursday as the storm moved northward up the
coast toward the beach resorts of Zihuatenejo, Manzanillo and
Puerto Vallarta.
<p>
   Overnight, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and fishing villages
near Huatulco, churning up 30-foot (9.1-meter) seas and leaving a
trail of roofless and ruined residences.
<p>
   Around Huatulco, Pauline's violent winds and rains turned
streets into rivers, ripped large trees from the ground and sent
makeshift homes of plywood flying. But nowhere did it hit as hard
as in the poor community of Las Tres Cruces, next to the Huatulco
airport.
<p>
   ``Is it gone?'' asked Pablo Avendano Lopez, one of the newly
homeless.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' replied 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo
Mayo, surveying the humble neighborhood reduced to broken glass and
debris.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American Southwest as a
tropical storm.
<p>
   Also in September, Hurricane Linda packed winds over 200 mph but
lived and died offshore. Forecasters said El Nino, in which
unusually warm Pacific waters disrupt weather patterns, could be to
blame for the high number of powerful hurricanes.

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small plane carrying seven German
tourists crashed Thursday morning as it prepared to land at the
Banjul airport, killing all but one person on board, officials
said.
<p>
   The crash happened about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers short of the
airport in Banjul, the capital of this West African nation, said
Claud Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil Aviation
Authority.
<p>
   The flight originated in Las Palmas, the principal city of Grand
Canary Island, one of a string of Spanish islands off the coast of
Morocco, Jensen said.
<p>
   The passengers  &MD;  five men and two women  &MD;  were German, said
Pascal Hector, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry. He said
one male passenger escaped with minor injuries.

Dog thrown from car window to slow down pursuing police

<p>
   LANGPORT, England (AP)  &MD;  Two men fleeing from police in a
high-speed car chase hurled whatever they had on hand out the
window to impede their pursuers  &MD;  including a dog, authorities say.
<p>
   The two men were arreste for alleged stolen vehicle and firearms
offenses, Somerset police said.
<p>
   The drama began when the men sped off after being spotted by
officers early Wednesday morning near Langport, Somerset, in
southwest England.
<p>
   Somerset police said officers pursued the vehicle for about 20
minutes through several villages until the two men abandoned the
car and fled.
<p>
   A police helicopter, using thermal imaging equipment, directed
officers on the ground to a nearby barn where one man was found. A
police dog later discovered a second man hiding in a ditch.
<p>
   The Alsatian-cross was found Thursday wandering near the village
of Long Sutton and taken to a kennel.
<p>
   Somerset police said it suffered cuts and bruises.
<p>
   ``It was fairly traumatized when it first came in, but it is
fine now,'' said a kennel spokeswoman, who was not identified.
``It's a lovely dog, with a chirpy, happy nature.''
<p>
   Police were trying to establish what the dog was doing in the
vehicle and who it belonged to.
<p>
   ``Obviously, we are interviewing two men about this incident
today and that will be one of our questions,'' a police spokesman,
also not identified, said Thursday. ``But to be honest, who owns
the dog will be quite far down the list.''

DNA test by state lab contradicts mother-daughter claim
By GWEN ACKERMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Results from new genetic testing released on
Thursday called into question claims that a Yemenite Jewish
immigrant to Israel and a woman living in California are mother and
daughter.
<p>
   A tearful televised reunion last summer between Margalit Omessi
and Tsila Levine of Sacramento provided what appeared to be the
missing link in a chain of evidence pointing to a 1950s scheme to
take children from Yemenite immigrants and give them to
European-descended families, many survivors of the Holocaust.
<p>
   Hundreds of toddlers and babies went missing during the
confusion that accompanied the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
immigrants after the creation of the Jewish state. Assertions that
most of them died of disease have been rejected by the families.
<p>
   But DNA tests by the state-run Abu Kabir Forensic Institute
failed to confirm family ties, officials said Thursday. ``She is
not the daughter,'' said Health Ministry director Gabi Barabash.
<p>
   Abu Kabir director Yehuda Hess said the institute's test was
more specific than an earlier test done at a Hebrew University lab
that found a DNA match between Omessi and Levine.
<p>
   Levine rejected the state findings.
<p>
   ``Why should I rely on tests by the Health Ministry, the same
government body that knew of the disappearance of the children of
Yemenites and other ethnic groups years ago?'' she told a radio
interviewer. ``I have found the truth and I am happy with the
truth. I believe with all my heart that this is my mother.''
<p>
   Levine, 50, had grown up wondering why she was so much darker
than the other children on her kibbutz, who were almost all of
European background.
<p>
   Eventually her parents told her she had been adopted, but they
knew little of her origins. When she turned 18, she tried and
failed to find out who her biological parents were. A few years
later she married and left the kibbutz, and 17 years ago moved to
the United States with her husband and two sons.
<p>
   Two months ago, she returned to Israel and published two
photographs of herself in a newspaper, one taken when she was a
baby, the other in the past year.
<p>
   Omessi thought she recognized her baby Saada, who disappeared
one day almost 50 years ago from a clinic.
<p>
   When the initial DNA test proved positive, the reunion became a
national sensation and boosted claims that there had been a
systematic kidnapping of babies.
<p>
   The new test spawned suggestions of a coverup.
<p>
   Levine's attorney Rami Tsuberi said he was suspicious of the
results because they were leaked to the press by the Health
Ministry, breaking a promise of confidentiality.
<p>
   The discrepancy was also challenged by Hassan Khatib, the Hebrew
University genetics expert who performed the first test.
<p>
   Khatib said he used a method accepted in courts and forensic
institutions worldwire and said no DNA test was foolproof.
<p>
   Levine said she plans to settle the issue by bringing the Omessi
family to the United States to do another DNA test with the FBI.
<p>
   Meanwhile, in Thursday's New York Times, the Yemenite Jewish
Federation of America placed a full-page ad asking for financial
help in reuniting Yemenite families.
<p>
   The ad displayed a picture of Levine and Omessi with the
caption: ``Mother and daughter reunited after 49 years.''
<p>
   A government-appointed committee is presently investigating the
issue in Israel.
<p>
   The inquiry was set up after Yemenite radical Uzi Meshulam and a
group of armed followers barricaded themselves in a house near Tel
Aviv for six weeks in 1994 to demand an investigation.
<p>
   The findings of two previous inquiries were inconclusive and
have been dismissed by the Yemenite community as whitewash.
<p>
   The issue is reflects the continuing social gaps between the
Sephardi Jews of Middle Eastern descent and the European-descended
Ashkenazim, who are socially and economically dominant. Israel's
4.7 million Jews are about equally divided between the groups.

Dutch central bank raises interest rates
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  The Dutch Central Bank lifted its
fixed advance rate, the equivalent of Germany's discount rate, to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent Thursday.
<p>
   The increase in the fixed advance rate came as a surprise. The
last time the bank changed the fixed advance rate was March 10,
when it was lifted to 2.5 percent from 2 percent.
<p>
   The move came after the Deutsche Bundesbank increased its
securities repurchase rate to 3.3 percent from 3 percent to preempt
higher inflation and help dampen growth in the money supply.
<p>
   The Dutch Central Bank said the decision to increase the fixed
advance rate was taken after considering the developments of the
domestic economy.
<p>
   ``It was a necessary move because the Dutch monetary policy
wasn't in tune with the economy,'' said Kees Rijswijk, an analyst
with SNS Securities, referring to relatively high consumer and
producer prices.
<p>
   Inflation figures for September will be released Friday and are
expected to be around 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent. The Dutch
inflation level in August  &MD;  2.6 percent  &MD;  was the highest in the
European Union except for Greece.

Land mines movement tops Nobel Peace speculation
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  A high-profile group of anti-land mines
activists tops speculation ahead of Friday's Nobel Peace Prize
announcement. Others bet on Bosnian peace workers, Chinese
dissidents and an intrepid group of doctors.
<p>
   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines soared in public
awareness with the death of its most visible backer, Princess
Diana, in August, then rose even higher the next month with the
drafting of a global treaty banning mines.
<p>
   ``Obviously it would be a very big help,'' said Jody Williams,
leader of the U.S.-based campaign that has vowed to pressure the
United States and other reluctant countries into signing the treaty
in December.
<p>
   Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign minister who initiated the
talks process that led to the treaty, also is a favorite for the
prize.
<p>
   Others seen as having a good chance include the humanitarian
group Doctors Without Borders; Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated
the Dayton accord that brought a still-troubled peace to Bosnia;
Balkan peace activists Selim Beslagic, Vesna Pesic and Vesna
Terselic; and Chinese dissidents Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
<p>
   The five-member Norwegian awards committee works in deep
secrecy, refusing even to say who has been nominated for the prize.
But many groups or individuals who propose candidates publicize
their nominations.
<p>
   The silence has grown even deeper after the news media learned
in advance that Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin would share the prize
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat in 1994. When the announcement came
the only surprise was that Rabin's colleague, Shimon Peres, also
shared the prize.
<p>
   Since then, the media have been foiled in an annual guessing
game. In 1995, the winners  &MD;  Joseph Rotblat and his Pugwash
movement against nuclear weapons  &MD;  weren't even mentioned in
speculation. Last year, guesses included one winner, East Timorese
Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, but not the other, activist Jose
Ramos-Horta, also of East Timor.
<p>
   The deadline for nominating candidates is Jan. 31, and the
committee has been deliberating since then. So if the anti-land
mine campaign was on the short-list of candidates eight months ago,
then its recent success could help secure the prize. Otherwise,
events just before the prize seem to have little impact on the
decision.
<p>
   The state radio network NRK this weekend was betting on Doctors
Without Borders, a five-time nominee. The group, founded in 1971,
sends medical teams all over the world to offer help in conflicts
and catastrophes.
<p>
   In recent decades, the prize has often been used to encourage
peace efforts and human rights  &MD;  a tendency typified by last year's
awards to Belo and Ramos-Horta. The shaky peace in the Balkans and
China's pro-democracy movement both could use a nudge forward.
<p>
   For the past two years, speculation has leaned heavily toward a
prize acknowledging peace efforts in the Balkans. Holbrooke is one
possible winner, although the committee seldom honors peace
mediators anymore.
<p>
   So it might look to others who have worked for peace in the
region, such as Beslagic, mayor of the Bosnian city of Tuzla;
Pesic, an anti-war activist in Serbia, and Terselic, a peace
activist in Croatia.
<p>
   Mere speculation about the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize going to
Chinese dissidents brought sharp reactions from Beijing, which
warned Norway this week that it would take a very dim view of an
award to activists Wei or Wang.
<p>
   The committee seems deaf to threats, and has even said it
welcomes controversy about what is often a political prize.
<p>
   Other potential winners mentioned include former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, Cambodian monk Maha
Ghosananda for his peace efforts, the Salvation Army and the
Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia.
<p>
   The Nobel Peace Prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, a Swede who invented
dynamite and used his fortune to endow the Nobel prizes. The other
Nobel prizes are presented the same day in Stockholm, Sweden.

<p>
   BERLIN (AP)  &MD;  A desperate search for a young man kidnapped
almost four weeks ago ended Thursday when police said they had
found his decomposed body in a hole in the woods north of Berlin.
<p>
   Authorities said 20-year-old Matthias Hintze apparently had been
left to die in the freshly dug shaft, 4 meters (13-foot) deep and
barely wide enough to turn around in, with no food, water or
protection from the cold.
<p>
   Initial autopsy results showed he'd been dead for three weeks.
``We assume he either suffocated or died from thirst or hunger,''
said Monika Haas, spokeswoman for the prosecutors office in
Potsdam.
<p>
   One of two suspects arrested Tuesday confessed and led police to
the body Wednesday night, chief investigator Peter Schultheiss said
in Potsdam. The suspects, Russian men, face charges of murder and
kidnapping.

Small fire extinguished in Moscow landmark cathedral
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Construction trash inside Moscow's newly rebuilt
Christ the Savior Cathedral caught fire Thursday, but the flames
were quickly put out, firefighters said.
<p>
   The fire was apparently caused when a worker dropped a cigarette
into a garbage heap, fire department spokesman Nikolai Sarychev
said. The landmark cathedral, whose interior is still under
construction, was not damaged, he said.
<p>
   The grandiose cathedral, which dominates central Moscow's
skyline, was rebuilt over the past two years to replicate one
destroyed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1931.
<p>
   The original cathedral, designed to celebrate Russia's victory
over Napoleon in 1812, was consecrated in 1883 after four decades
of construction.

Foreign minister Levy threatening to resign
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said
Thursday that he may resign because of his troubled relations with
Benjamin Netanyahu, and suggested his health had suffered because
of the tension with the premier.
<p>
   Levy told Israel Radio he was not consulted about the decision
to order Israeli agents to assassinate a militant Islamic leader in
Jordan, and that he would have opposed the plan.
<p>
   The botched Sept. 25 attack on Khaled Mashaal only strengthened
the militant group and damaged Israel's international standing and
its relations with its closest Arab ally, Jordan, Levy said.
<p>
   ``The damage is definitely grave ... to everything,'' Levy said.
Asked about the chances that he might resign, Levy replied, ``about
50-50.''
<p>
   Levy's relations with Netanyahu have been rocky since the
government was formed, and Netanyahu and his aides have kept Levy
and the Foreign Ministry on the margins of policymaking.
<p>
   However, Levy denied reports that Netanyahu failed to inform him
about his meeting Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat  &MD; 
the first such summit in eight months.
<p>
   Levy, who was hospitalized Tuesday night with chest pains, said
his condition was caused by overwork, but admitted that it was
aggravated by his anger with Netanyahu.
<p>
   ``I have no doubt,'' he said when asked about this.
<p>
   Media reports said Levy almost refused to receive Netanyahu when
he visited him at the hospital in Afula. The reports quoted Levy as
saying, ``I've had it with this man.''
<p>
   Doctors say Levy, 59, did not suffer a heart attack.

BC-Spain-Argentina-Dirty War
Argentine dirty war survivors flood Spanish radio show with calls
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  The appearance of a former Argentine naval
officer in Spain who admitted he hurled dissidents to their deaths
from airplanes during Argentina's dirty war uncorked a flood of
emotions Thursday.
<p>
   By the thousands, Argentine emigres and Spaniards who had lived
in Argentina during the mass killings called a national radio talk
show to remember, and to shed tears.
<p>
   The outpouring of emotion was triggered by former Argentine
naval officer Adolfo Scilingo's testimony in a Spanish courtroom
about the 1976-1983 dirty war, in which at least 9,000 suspected
leftist dissidents were arrested, tortured, and then never seen
again.
<p>
   Scilingo's testimony marked the first time a member of
Argentina's security forces who participated in the repression has
provided details in any court about the killings.
<p>
   No such probe has been held in Argentina. In 1990, Argentine
President Carlos Menem pardoned middle and senior-ranking officers
of any culpability from the dirty war.
<p>
   Scilingo is testifying in Spain because Spanish Judge Baltazar
Garzon is investigating the disappearances of 600 Spaniards during
the dirty war.
<p>
   Many Argentines  &MD;  the number is not clear  &MD;  fled to Spain and
other countries during the repression.
<p>
   The number of callers to the morning talk show shows the wounds
are still fresh.
<p>
   The panelists had been discussing Scilingo's testimony, which
began Tuesday and was to continue Thursday afternoon, when the
switchboard began lighting up.
<p>
   A former teacher in Argentina remembered all the students and
parents who had disappeared in the dirty war.
<p>
   ``Ask Scilingo,'' she said, her voice trembling with emotion.
``If he threw those people into the sea.''
<p>
   One 42-year-old man, who identified himself only as Jose,
recalled the many students he had known in Argentina who were among
the missing. He broke down crying and was unable to continue.
<p>
   ``I'm sorry. There's so many things ... that only so few people
know about,'' he said.
<p>
   Sounding a contrasting note, one caller who identified himself
as Emilio said he remembered how his security company in Buenos
Aires received many orders for security alarms from military
personnel who were afraid Montonero leftist rebels would invade
their homes and massacre their families.
<p>
   ``Let it not be forgotten there were thousand of killings by the
Montoneros,'' said the caller. ``Every effect has its cause.''
<p>
   Ana Ramos, who works for the radio show, said it was besieged by
callers.
<p>
   ``The entire radio station's telephone system was blocked for
over an hour,'' she said.
<p>
   Scilingo, who came voluntarily to Spain to testify, was arrested
Tuesday after he admitted hurling suspected dissidents to their
deaths from airplanes flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Judge
Baltazar Garzon reportedly ordered the arrest to assure Scilingo's
continued appearance in his courtroom.
<p>
   Garzon's year-old probe is backed by Spanish law which allows
the prosecution of genocide no matter where it is committed and
regardless of the nationality of those accused.
<p>
   Garzon has also ordered the arrest of a former military leader
of Argentina, but Menem's government has refused to hand over key
Argentine military personnel or help in any way with the probe.
<p>
   Under Spanish law, Garzon has until Friday after which he must
seek an extension order on Scilingo's arrest, file charges or free
him.

U.S. banker gets one-week visa to return to Moscow
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Nearly a week after he unexpectedly lost his
Russian visa, U.S. investment banker Boris Jordan received a new
visa and returned Thursday to Moscow.
<p>
   Jordan, one of the best-known foreigners in the Moscow
investment community, had his visa taken away when he left Russia
last week. Foreign Ministry officials said the move reflected
concerns about his business activities, but refused to provide
details.
<p>
   The move was criticized by First Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov, who on Wednesday blamed it on rival Russian commercial
banks.
<p>
   Jordan's visa troubles were not entirely resolved, however. His
new visa is for single entry and valid only for one week.
<p>
   Foreigners working in Russia typically get multiple-entry visas,
renewable annually. Jordan is the only foreign businessman in
recent memory who has been denied a visa.
<p>
   ``We think the situation is beginning to resolve itself,'' said
Oleg Sapozhnikov, a spokesman for MFK, a leading Russian bank
headed by Jordan. ``But we won't consider it fully solved until he
has a normal multi-entry visa.''
<p>
   Jordan also heads Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.
Renaissance and MFK, both affiliates of Russian financial giant
Oneximbank, are slated to merge Jan. 1.
<p>
   Oneximbank spokesman Modest Kolerov said Thursday the bank will
push for reinstatement of Jordan's multi-entry visa once he returns
to Moscow.
<p>
   Jordan, 31, is a U.S. national of Russian descent and has
expressed intentions of becoming a Russian citizen. He's spent most
of this decade living in Russia.
<p>
   But his aggressive business style, which often has brought him
into conflict with the Soviet-era managers at companies in which
Renaissance invests, has won him enemies inside Russia. He lost his
visa for several weeks last year in what was described as a battle
with the management of metals plant.
<p>
   Oneximbank has angered competitors in recent months by winning
numerous prized assets in the country's privatization auctions.
<p>
   Renaissance has played a key role in those deals, bringing in
hundreds of millions of dollars in investment from overseas,
including funds from financier George Soros.

Sweden seeks greater cooperation with NATO
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Sweden's foreign minister said Thursday
that the government wants to deepen its copperation with NATO, but
said the country is still committed to neutrality.
<p>
   Lena Hjelm-Wallen made the statement in submitting the
government's proposal to Parliament for legislative changes that
would allow Sweden to participate in the expansion of Partnership
for Peace activities.
<p>
   PFP exercises are being expanded to include all forms of
crisis-management with the exception of pure defense exercises. As
part of the expansion, PFP countries also will be allowed to put
officers on NATO staffs throughout Europe.
<p>
   The government also wants approval to have its ambassador to
Belgium be its representative to NATO headquarters.
<p>
   ``When Swedish soldiers are placed in a military action for
maintaining peace, the government must alo be guaranteed a say,''
Hjelm-Wallen said.
<p>
   But, she added, ``this deepened cooperation does not imply any
step toward membership in NATO.''

   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Maurice Papon, the former French Cabinet
minister accused of crimes against humanity during World War II,
suffered a small heart problem Thursday, but his trial is expected
to continue, his lawyer said.
<p>
   Jean-Marc Varaut said he asked the court to prolong a regular
break in the proceedings to allow Papon to recover from ``a shock
to the heart.''
<p>
   A doctor examined the former Vichy official outside the court
room and administered a spray under Papon's tongue, which will
allow him to participate in the rest of Thursday's hearings, Varaut
said.
<p>
   Papon fell ill in a corridor outside the courtroom, minutes
after judges ordered a break after a three-hour session, Varaut
said.
<p>
   Earlier, Varaut had argued that Papon could not get a fair trial
and asked that proceedings be halted.

Dutch central bank raises interest rates
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  The Dutch Central Bank lifted its
fixed advance rate, the equivalent of Germany's discount rate, to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent Thursday.
<p>
   The increase in the fixed advance rate came as a surprise. The
last time the bank changed the fixed advance rate was March 10,
when it was lifted to 2.5 percent from 2 percent.
<p>
   The move came after the Deutsche Bundesbank increased its
securities repurchase rate to 3.3 percent from 3 percent to preempt
higher inflation and help dampen growth in the money supply.
<p>
   The Dutch Central Bank said the decision to increase the fixed
advance rate was taken after considering the developments of the
domestic economy.
<p>
   ``It was a necessary move because the Dutch monetary policy
wasn't in tune with the economy,'' said Kees Rijswijk, an analyst
with SNS Securities, referring to relatively high consumer and
producer prices.
<p>
   Inflation figures for September will be released Friday and are
expected to be around 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent. The Dutch
inflation level in August  &MD;  2.6 percent  &MD;  was the highest in the
European Union except for Greece.

Mrs. Clinton pushes for bigger women's role in `vibrant democracy'

   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)  &MD;  Saying it is time to ``move hearts
and change old attitudes,'' U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
told a conference of Latin American first ladies Thursday taht
women need a bigger role in the region's democracies.
<p>
   ``Democracy can only achieve its fullest potential when women
are not barred by law, by tradition, or by intimidation from making
their voices heard at the ballot box, from pursuing their most
cherished dreams,'' Mrs. Clinton said in prepared remarks.
<p>
   The first lady said that even as dictatorships have given way to
democracies throughout the region, many women still are denied
opportunity because of laws and attitudes that restrict their
freedom.
<p>
   ``As we can all attest, in too many countries, my own as well,
too many rights are denied and too many doors of opportunity remain
tightly closed,'' Mrs. Clinton told the Conference of Wives of
Heads of State and Governments of the Americas.
<p>
   She cited fear of violence and inadequate laws against domestic
abuse, the problems of poverty and limited educational and business
opportunities as hindrances to women.
<p>
   ``Empowering more women to seek and claim their rights as
citizens and as human beings is the only way we can insure that our
democracies  &MD;  old and new  &MD;  survive and thrive into the 21st
century,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   She said the challenge was in some ways bigger than that of
building the Panama Canal, its entrance just blocks from the
conference site.
<p>
   ``Instead of mountains, we seek to move hearts, to change old
attitudes, to banish hunger and disease, to educate all our
children-and most of all-to empower the women of our hemisphere to
participate fully in the life of our nations.''
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton first met with first ladies from the region in
1994, when she invited them to attend a symposium on children while
their husbands were meeting President Clinton at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami.
<p>
   The women reciprocated by inviting her to attend their annual
first ladies' conference, and this is the third year Mrs. Clinton
has joined them. This year's gathering also drew Queen Fabiola of
Belgium as well as Ana Botella, the wife of Spanish prime minister
Jose Maria Aznar.
<p>
   One goal was to take stock of progress on past conference goals,
including eradicating measles, reducing maternal mortality and
education reforms.
<p>
   Beyond that, Panama's Dora Boyd de Perez inaugurated this year's
two-day meeting Wednesday by outlining four topics: educating for
human rights, eradicating child labor, helping rural women increase
independence, and education during the 21st century.

Central Bank raises interest rate to preempt inflation

<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates Thursday for the first time in more than five years, calling
it a precautionary move against inflation.
<p>
   The Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase (repo) rates through Oct. 22, to 3.3 percent from 3
percent, to preempt higher inflation and help dampen growth in the
money supply.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the moves ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   Import prices rose 5.4 percent in August, the biggest jump since
1989. Especially affected are commodities priced in dollars on the
world market, such as petroleum products.
<p>
   The dollar, which has been retreating since hitting an
eight-year high of 1.891 against the mark on Aug. 6, fell another
pfennig immediately after the bank's announcement, to 1.7415 marks.
But dealers said the currency market's reaction was relatively
muted as the rate hike had been expected.
<p>
   Waigel also said that the upswing in the German economy won't be
damped by the Bundesbank's decision. Rates on long-term capital
loans to businesses, ``which are vital to investment and
employment,'' are not expected to be affected, he said in a
statement from Bonn.
<p>
   The Association of German Industry and Trade agreed, calling the
bank's decision ``moderate and appropriate.''
<p>
   Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the repo rate increase
would not dampen German economic growth.
<p>
   ``This decision shows the determination of the Bundesbank to
secure price stability in the foreground of European currency
union,'' Rexrodt said.
<p>
   The German government has forecast economic growth of 2.5
percent for 1997 and of around 3 percent next year.
<p>
   Those joining the single currency union to begin Jan. 1, 1999,
will be determined in May 1998, based on monetary and fiscal
performances.

Hungary asks for rescheduling of European Track Championship
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  &MD;  Organizers of the l998 European
Athletic Championships want the Budapest event held a week early to
avoid a clash with the Formula-1 car race, the president of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation said Thursday.
<p>
   The Hungarian Grand Prix is to be held Aug. l6. The track meet
is to start the following day, and the city's hotel capacity simply
cannot cope, the organizers argue.
<p>
   ``We have received a request saying Hungary would have a major
problem with Formula 1 being held August 16th and the European
Athletics Championship starting on the 17th,'' IAAF President Primo
Nebiolo told reporters. ``However, we were assured that even if the
date can't be changed, the championship will be organized in the
best possible way.''
<p>
   He explained that the decision has to be made by the European
Council of the IAAF, and it must be before the end of October.
<p>
   ``We have accepted the request, we are looking into it. For us
it is one of the most important events of the year,'' Nebiolo said.

<p>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The Italian Spring-Summer 1998 fashion
showings came to a grand finale Thursday when Donatella Versace
unveiled the first Versace signature collection since her brother's
killing last summer.
<p>
   The show turned into a tribute to Gianni Versace, who was gunned
down in front of his Miami Beach mansion on July 15.
<p>
   Before the show started, a screen above the runway broadcast a
message from the fashion house:
<p>
   ``This show is dedicated to our brother's love of work and to
our entire staff, whose incredible love and devotion was so
precious to our brother and means so much to us.''
<p>
   In a rare move of solidarity, a large number of fellow designers
including Giorgio Armani, Karl Lagerfeld, Carla Fendi, Romeo Gigli
and Mariuccia Mandelli (Krizia) promised to attend the show's
evening replay in Versace's palazzo on fashionable Via Gesu.
<p>
   ``It's the least we could do for Gianni,'' Armani said earlier
in the week.
<p>
   Rumored front row notables included Elton John, a close friend
who sang at Versace's memorial Mass in the Milan cathedral in July;
actress Demi Moore, in town to promote her latest film ``G.I.
Jane;'' and Miami Beach neighbor Madonna.
<p>
   Versace was the pet designer of the Hollywood ``glitterati'' and
his fashion shows were always star-studded events.
<p>
   Andre Leon Tally, contributing editor for Vogue and a close
fashion follower, described the new collection as, ``very
Hollywood'' and ``indicative of Gianni's sensibility and
philosophy.''
<p>
   It includes the sexy body molding gowns the designer was famous
for and a new power suit with long pants and a sleeveless jacket.
<p>
   The company recently announced that Donatella, 12 years Gianni's
junior and in his own words his ``fashion muse,'' would be taking
over the artistic direction of the house and design the label.
<p>
   According to Leon Tally, Gianni, Donatella and older brother
Santo who runs the commercial side of the billion-dollar company
had a collaborative talk after the Paris couture collection in
early July.
<p>
   ``Donatella designed the collection in respect for her
brother,'' Leon Tally said.
<p>
   The collection was presented three times Thursday.
<p>
   Thursday morning, last day of the week-long showings, Alberta
Ferretti presented her feminine style for next year's warmer
weather.
<p>
   Delicate organza gowns with minute embroidery, frayed hemlines
and dipping backs offered a dreamy approach to a summer night's
ball.
<p>
   For daytime Ferretti, who is Milan's romantic minimalist,
offered neat little suits with the same frayed detail found in the
evening wear, and simply cut mid-calf dresses with discreet
shoulder-padding in the short sleeve.
<p>
   Favorite shades for the demure collection were old rose, mauve
and a glowing rather than shining silver gray.
<p>
   Unlike Paris, the Italian designing scene is full of talented
women who have climbed to the top of the fashion Olympus.
<p>
   Aside from Ferretti, Milan has Miuccia Prada, Laura Biagiotti,
Anna Molinari, Krizia, (Mariuccia Mandelli) Donatella Girombelli,
Angela Missoni and the five Fendi sisters.
<p>
   Time will tell whether Donatella can fill the fashion void her
brother left and join them.

Bosnian Serbs win election in town lost in war
By SRECKO LATAL

<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian Serbs lost the
western town of Drvar during the war, but may win it back through
the ballot, according to election results announced Thursday.
<p>
   Before the war, 97 percent of Drvar's 17,000 residents were
Serb. Now Bosnian Croat refugees who poured into the region when
Muslims overtook their villages in central Bosnia live there.
<p>
   A Serb party campaigning for return of refugees won 19 local
council seats in Drvar, compared to 11 for the ruling Croat party.
<p>
   As in so many disputed areas, handing over the town to the newly
elected officials will be difficult. The local Croat authorities in
Drvar continue to prevent Serb refugees from returning to their
pre-war homes.
<p>
   Earlier in the week, the NATO-led peace force deployed troops to
protect a group of Serbs from a Croat mob, international agencies
said Thursday.
<p>
   The incident was sparked when a group of Croat families took
over houses that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had
repaired for 27 Serb refugees.
<p>
   Peacekeepers were forced to intervene when scores of
construction workers and young men attempted to force the Serbs
out, said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the aid agency.
<p>
   Local Croatian and Bosnian media quoted the Croat mayor of
Drvar, Borivoje Malbasic, as claiming he was beaten up by
peacekeepers during the incident.
<p>
   NATO officials denied that Malbasic was beaten. Spokesman Maj.
Jan Joosten said Malbasic tried to drive through a NATO checkpoint
and knocked down a peacekeeper. Canadian military police who manned
the check point launched an investigation to confirm details.
<p>
   Results of the Sept. 13-14 elections indicated another possible
trouble zone in the northern Croat-held town of Zepce. The main
Muslim-led coalition won 39 of 42 seats in the council, but it is
likely that Croats will try to prevent them from taking over the
legislature.
<p>
   During voter registration this summer, several key Croat
candidates were removed from voting lists for attempted
manipulation of the process and fraud.
<p>
   Following the punishment, the ruling Bosnian Croat party called
upon Croats to boycott the elections. As a result the Croat
Democratic Union won only three seats.

Italian playwright Dario Fo wins Nobel Prize for Literature

<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Italy's Dario Fo, whose plays have made
audiences roar with laughter and authorities seethe with anger, won
the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited by the Swedish Academy
for ``scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the
downtrodden.''
<p>
   A left-wing sympathizer and anti-establishment figure, Fo was
not on the critics' lists of potential winners.
<p>
   ``I'm amazed,'' Fo said when he learned he won the award, this
year worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million).
<p>
   The Vatican's official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, also
used the word ``amazed'' to describe its reaction.
<p>
   ``Giving the prize to an actor who is also an author of
debatable texts... has surpassed all imagination,'' the newspaper
wrote in a brief editorial.
<p>
   Fo and his wife, Franca Rame, founded a theater company in 1959.
Since then they have satirized much of post-war Italian politics
and scandals that brought down politicians and businessmen in the
early 1990s.
<p>
   ``Dario Fo has taken great risks and been very brave, and he has
had to suffer the consequences of that,'' said Sture Allen,
permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   Fo has been arrested several times and his work was banned from
state-run radio and TV until 1977.
<p>
   In 1980, he and his wife were refused visas to the United States
because of their support for left-wing activities in Italy. In
1984, the U.S. government relented and allowed the couple to
briefly visit New York to see a production of ``Accidental Death of
an Anarchist.''
<p>
   Fo still cuts a political figure. Two weeks ago, he hit
headlines when participating in a demonstration that ridiculed the
Northern League, a separatist group in northern Italy.
<p>
   Fo was introduced to narrative traditions at an early age
through his grandfather, a well-known storyteller. At age 25, he
began to write and act satirical cabarets at the Piccolo Theater in
Milan.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher,
said that Fo is a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He both learns from the people and gives back to the people,''
Linnell said.
<p>
   Fo's most popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo,
``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The latter is based on the right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in
1969, which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers around a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who
possesses the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of
officialdom,'' the citation said.
<p>
   Fo told ANSA that he learned of the Nobel prize when he was
driving from Rome to Milan and another car drove by him holding up
a sign, ``Dario has won the Nobel.''
<p>
   Rame, whom Fo married in 1954, said her husband deserved the
award.
<p>
   ``It will pay him back for the many, many humiliations he has
suffered in his life,'' she said. ``I believe that today many
critics, when they hear this news, will have a heart attack.''
<p>
   Fo's Italian-born Swedish translator, Carlo Barsotti, said the
prize will split Italy in two.
<p>
   ``It's always been like that with Dario Fo. There are those who
will scream with joy, while reactionary people ... will turn up
their noses,'' Barsotti told the Swedish news agency TT.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans, the Swedish Academy which keeps a tight lid on its
deliberations, has over the last decades awarded the prize to more
women and to wider geographical areas.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Names that consistently show up on speculators' lists include
Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South Africa, Doris Lessing
of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   The literature prize was the second of this year's Nobels to be
announced. The medicine award was won on Monday by American Stanley
Prusiner for discoveries related to so-called ``mad cow disease''
and other brain-wasting conditions.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

US official: Czech army must make army careers more attractive
Eds: UPDATES with Hungarian army officers demonstrating for more
pay.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP)  &MD;  A U.S. defense official urged the
Czech government on Thursday to press ahead with new laws making
the army compatible with NATO and a military career more
attractive.
<p>
   Although the Czech republic, Poland and Hungary were invited
this summer to join, serious shortcomings in their militaries after
four decades of communism are alarming NATO experts.
<p>
   In the Czech republic's case, one of the problems is keeping
promising officers in the army  &MD;  many now leave because of lack of
opportunity, low pay and low prestige.
<p>
   U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Frederick Pang told reporters at
the end of a two-day seminar on military personnel policies that
the situation in the Czech military was not alarming because
``transition ... takes time.'' He added, however, that new laws
revamping the military are ``one of the keys to success in the
future.''
<p>
   The Czech Defense Ministry is working on eight laws on
restructuring the military service to meet NATO standards. One of
them is expected to set new pay structures and rules on military
education, promotion, training and benefits.
<p>
   The ministry is planning to present drafts of the laws to the
government by the end of this year and hopes for parliamentary
approval sometime next year.
<p>
   In veiled criticism, Pang said some people considered the pace
of introducing the new laws slow, ``but I know how at times the
legislative process does not work as fast as people would like.''
<p>
   In the Hungarian capital Budapest on Thursday, dozens of army
officers  &MD;  together with police, prison guards and other state
security officials  &MD;  demonstrated for higher wages.
<p>
   Col. Mihaly Volonter said workload had increased for army
officers because of downsizing from the bloated military hierarchy
of communist times.
<p>
   Hungary's military has shrunk from 100,000 to 50,000 since the
Warsaw Pact broke up in the early 1990s. An average officer's
monthly salary is the equivalent of dlrs 300.
<p>
   The officers are threatening mass demonstrations in November if
the finance ministry does not advance a pay hike planned for 1999
to Jan. 1, 1998.

Prodi resigns, asked to stay on as caretaker
EDs: UPDATES with meeting with president
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP) - Premier Romano Prodi resigned Thursday after he lost
the backing of a Communist ally for his plan to cut welfare
benefits to keep Italy on the path toward European monetary union.
<p>
   Italy's president asked Prodi to stay on in a caretaker capacity
while he consults party leaders on forming a new government.
<p>
   Prodi's deputy premier, Walter Veltroni, said he believed early
elections would be necessary.
<p>
   The premier offered to resign after a parliamentary debate in
which the Communists said they would vote against the government in
what would effectively be a no-confidence vote.
<p>
   The vote was abandoned after Prodi announced his intention to
resign.

<p>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The Italian Spring-Summer 1998 fashion
showings came to a grand finale Thursday when Donatella Versace
unveiled the first Versace signature collection since her brother's
killing last summer.
<p>
   The show turned into a tribute to Gianni Versace, who was gunned
down in front of his Miami Beach mansion on July 15.
<p>
   Before the show started, a screen above the runway broadcast a
message from the fashion house:
<p>
   ``This show is dedicated to our brother's love of work and to
our entire staff, whose incredible love and devotion was so
precious to our brother and means so much to us.''
<p>
   Ms. Versace came on to the runway afterwards to thank the
audience but after three steps she burst into tears and ran off.

German parliament salvages small part of tax cut
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BONN, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Saving a small part of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's tax reform, parliament Thursday passed a cut in the
``solidarity surcharge'' used to rebuild former communist East
Germany.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called it ``the second-best
solution'' after the opposition Social Democrats used their upper
house majority last month to kill a wider government plan for
slashing corporate and personal taxes.
<p>
   Kohl's ruling three-party coalition had quarreled off and on for
months about lowering the solidarity surcharge, which threatened to
topple the government at one point.
<p>
   With parliamentary elections due next September, the small
anti-tax Free Democrats insisted on lowering the levy despite
budget pressures caused by Germany's drive to qualify for the
planned single European currency, the euro.
<p>
   Last week, the government agreed on how to pay for lowering the
surcharge to 5.5 percent from 7.5 percent on Jan. 1.
<p>
   Parliament passed the measure on the strength of the coalition's
majority in the lower house.
<p>
   A Social Democrat lawmaker, Karl Diller, criticized the move as
``a tax cut using borrowed money and only thinly disguised with
bookkeeping tricks.''
<p>
   Approval in the upper house, which represents the nation's 16
states, is not needed because the surcharge is a federal tax that
does not affect state budgets.
<p>
   The surcharge, which was added to income tax bills after German
unification on Oct. 3, 1990, has been deeply unpopular, especially
in western Germany.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the expected 7.1 billion marks
(dlrs 4.1 billion) in lost revenue will be made up mainly by
deferring some payments to the debt fund inherited from the former
East German government.
<p>
   The government also will raise money by selling claims to money
owed the government from the sale of privatized real estate.

Yeltsin-Presidency
Yeltsin in Strasbourg says won't seek third term as president
By DEBORAH SEWARD
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  Boris Yeltsin said Thursday he would
not seek a third term as president and predicted a young, energetic
democrat would become Russia's next leader.
<p>
   Speaking firmly after arriving in Strasbourg, France for a
summit of European leaders, Yeltsin said he was the guarantor of
Russia's constitution and had no intention of changing it to be
able to run again.
<p>
   ``I will not run for a third term and because of that will not
change the constitution. When my two terms are up, there will be a
new, spirited, energetic democrat,'' in my place, Yeltsin said.
<p>
   Yeltsin's declaration he would not seek to run a third time when
his term as president expires in the year 2000 comes after more
than a month of speculation about his real political intentions.
<p>
   Just a week ago while attending a trade fair in the central
Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod, Yeltsin, 66, hinted he was still
undecided as to whether to seek a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin, who became Russia's first democratically elected
president in 1991, on Sept. 1 had flatly declared he would not seek
a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin's political allies had reportedly been seeking ways to
allow him to seek a new four-year term. Two terms are the limit
under Russia's new constitution adopted in 1993, but Yeltsin could
claim he had not actually served two full terms under it.
<p>
   However, in Strasbourg, Yeltsin said, ``I am the guarantor of
the constitution and above all must show I will carry it out.''
<p>
   Yeltsin, 66, has a long history of health problems and underwent
heart bypass surgery a year ago. But he now appears robust, and
there is no doubt he intends to serve out this term.
<p>
   A host of presidential contenders are already casting their eyes
on the 2000 presidential elections, including current Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, his first deputy Boris Nemtsov, a
young energetic reformer. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzkhov and Yeltsin
opponents such as Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, former
security chief Alexander Lebed and ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky are also possible candidates.
<p>
   After arriving in Strasbourg, Yeltsin also said he hoped for a
solution to the conflict with the Duma, the lower house of the
Russian parliament, which is dominated by his opponents.
<p>
   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, on Thursday pledged to hold a
no-confidence vote in the government next week following sharp
differences over next year's budget.
<p>
   Addressing the issue of the new post-Cold War Europe, Yeltsin
said he thought it would take at least 10 years for his country to
fully integrate into Europe.
<p>
   Yeltsin is scheduled to have dinner with French President
Jacques Chirac on Thursday evening and will address the Council of
Europe summit Friday afternoon.
<p>
   As one of his goals, Yeltsin has said he wants to persuade
fellow leaders to lessen United States influence on the European
continent.

BC-Sports-Soccer-World Cup Preview
Final round of European qualifying games promise joy and despair
By ROBERT MILLWARD
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Tension in Rome. Joy or dismay in Athens. Delirium
in Vienna and Glasgow.
<p>
   Six more European nations will advance to next year's World Cup
in France Saturday when the final 22 qualifying round matches spark
celebrations for the winners and sorrow for those who don't make
it.
<p>
   And the agony of waiting for the unknown as eight teams head for
playoffs.
<p>
   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Scotland are almost there.
England and Italy fight it out in Rome in the standout match of the
day while Ireland and Yugoslavia will have to sweat through the
playoffs of eight runners up.
<p>
   Greece can qualify for the second time in a row by beating
Denmark in Athens and finishing top of Group A. But a loss or even
a tie with the Danes likely will mean elimination because Croatia
can relegate it to third by beating Slovenia.
<p>
   Four nations, Romania, Norway, Bulgaria and Spain already join
host nation France in the 32-team finals next July. Outside of
Europe, five African nations  &MD;  South Africa, Nigeria, Cameroon,
Tunisia and Morocco  &MD;  have qualified while Argentina, Colombia and
Paraguay join defending titlist Brazil from South America.
<p>
   The Italy-England confrontation in Rome's Olympic stadium has so
much riding on it.
<p>
   Although the loser could still get through via the playoffs,
neither teams wants to rely on the back door route to France '98.
Italy was runner up at the last World Cup in 1994 and England wants
the world to know it's back as a major contender after failing to
qualify four years ago.
<p>
   The English need only a point from the game while the Italians
are in a must-win situation and badly need an early goal to stop
their 70,000 fans turning against them.
<p>
   England coach Glenn Hoddle believes his team has become tough to
beat away from home instead of a pushover.
<p>
   ``In this qualifying group we've won our three away games which
suggests things are changing,'' he said. ``We did well in the
Tournoi de France (against Italy, Brazil and France) outside of our
own country and we have performed well away from home.
<p>
   ``Now we've got to make sure we do it in one more game.''
<p>
   Denmark has a three-point advantage in Athens but can be caught
on goal difference even if it loses 1-0 and will then have to
qualify through the playoffs.
<p>
   Michael Laudrup is a doubtful starter for the Danes in Athens
because of a sore Achilles heel and coach Bo Johansson has made a
late call up in Middlesbrough's Mikkel Beck.
<p>
   Greek coach Costas Polychroniou has a full-strength team but
also the problem of reducing his players' pre-game anxiety.
<p>
   ``Whichever player is stressed, he had better say it now and not
play,'' he told them.
<p>
   Croatia, a point behind the Greeks, can finish second at best
and is bemoaning the two points it squandered to the Slovenians in
a 3-3 tie on home soil in April.
<p>
   ``I think that was our biggest failure,'' said star striker
Davor Suker. ``Because of those two points, we may lose the
qualification.''
<p>
   Germany, a three-time World Cup winner and three-time runner up,
needs only a point from its home game against last-place Albania to
qualify for the 14th time. The only World Cups the Germans have
missed were in 1930 and 1950.
<p>
   German coach Berti Vogts has almost an entire lineup missing
through injury, including star players such as Juergen Klinsmann
Matthias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten.
<p>
   ``I want a clear victory and for that we need fit players,''
said Vogts, who likely will have Olaf Thon as libero and Olivier
Bierhoff and Fredi Bobic as strikers against the Albanians.
<p>
   The expected German victory leaves Ukraine and Portugal fighting
over the playoff place as runner up. Ukraine goes to fourth place
Armenia with a one-point advantage over the Portuguese, who visit
Northern Ireland.
<p>
   ``I think the guys understand that on Saturday we have the game
of the season,'' said Ukraine head coach Iozhef Sabo. ``After all,
even second place in the group would mean success for Ukraine.
We'll worry about the play-off later.''
<p>
   Austria, Scotland and Sweden are all expected to win their Group
4 games at home and that would put the Austrians and Scots through
and eliminate the Swedes, who placed third in 1994.
<p>
   The Austrians, who host last place Belarus in Vienna, would
qualify as group winner and Scotland, at home to Latvia, would wind
up with the best record of the nine runners up. That record is
based on their records against the teams finishing first, third and
fourth in each group and the Scots would finish with a 4-1-1
record.
<p>
   Austria holds a two-point lead over Scotland with Sweden two
points further back and coach Herbert Prohaska wants no slipups
against Belarus.
<p>
   ``If we are already happy with second place, it's a very bad
sign,'' he said. ``Belarus gave us problems in Minsk, we have 90
minutes of hard work ahead of us.''
<p>
   Spain is already assured of a place from Group 6 even in the
unlikely event of a home loss to the Faeroe Islands. That means
Yugoslavia, booted out of the 1994 World Cup qualifying competition
because of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, must settle for a
playoff place and its final game at Malta is pretty meaningless.
<p>
   Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac uses the game against Malta as a
training exercise for his team ahead of the playoffs although he
may include some youngsters, such as Red Star's Perica Ognjenovic,
whose attacking possibilities have already attracted major world
clubs such as Real Madrid and Barcelona.
<p>
   Romania already is through with the best record of nine wins
from nine games so that second place Ireland needs to go to the
playoffs. Mathematically, Lithuania could catch the Irish but would
have to win at Macedonia by 13 goals and assume Ireland becomes
Romania's 10th victim.
<p>
   Likewise, Belgium theoretically can overtake the Netherlands
atop Group 7. But the Belgians would need to beat Wales by 14 goals
and hope the Dutch lose at home to the Turks. It looks like Belgium
for the playoffs although two unlikely home losses for the Dutch
and the Belgians would put Turkey into second place and Belgium
out.

Rights group blames Rwandans, Kabila's forces for Congo massacres
Eds: RECAPS, adds material on US
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The Rwandan army and Laurent Kabila's
forces carried out most of the massacres of civilians in eastern
Congo and killings there are still going on, a human rights group
has charged.
<p>
   In a 40-page report released Wednesday, Human Rights
Watch/Africa acknowledged that troops loyal to the late Mobutu Sese
Seko also committed murders, rapes and other abuses during Kabila's
seven-month rebellion, which ended with Mobutu's downfall and
Kabila's installation as president.
<p>
   Last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalled four leaders of
a U.N. team sent to the Congo to investigate the alleged massacres
after differences with the government stalled the probe.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch/Africa urged the international community to
step up pressure on Kabila to allow the investigation to proceed.
<p>
   Kabila claims that if there were massacres, they were committed
by Mobutu's troops and their Rwandan Hutu militia allies. Those
militiamen were among the 1 million Rwandans who fled to eastern
Congo  &MD;  then known as Zaire  &MD;  to escape reprisals after the
slaughter of 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch said abuses committed by Kabila's forces
and the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army ``are remarkably different in
their scale, nature and motivation'' from those carried out by
Mobutu's troops and Rwandan militiamen.
<p>
   ``These killings and the intentional blocking of aid were
apparently both in revenge for the 1994 genocide (in Rwanda)''  &MD; 
and to weaken Hutu militiamen who were fighting alongside Mobutu's
soldiers, the report said.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch claimed the United States was aware in
advance of Rwanda's plans to intervene in the Congo rebellion.
<p>
   The report said the Pentagon signed off as early as August 1995
on Rwanda's plans to clear out the refugee camps in eastern Congo
``provided it was a `clean' operation, meaning one with limited
civilian casualties.''
<p>
   In August 1996, Rwandan Defense Minister Paul Kagame told the
Americans that Rwanda was ready to dismantle the camps if no one
else acted, the report said.
<p>
   The report also alleged that the Rwandan army systematically
separated young men, former Rwandan Hutu government officials and
Hutu intellectuals from among refugees and executed them.
<p>
   After the 1994 genocide, a Tutsi-dominated rebel army overthrew
Rwanda's Hutu government. The conflict spilled over into
neighboring Zaire, which became the Democratic Republic of Congo
after Kabila's victory over Mobutu five months ago.
<p>
   ``Authorities in Congo have made concerted efforts to conceal
the evidence of civilian killing ... largely through the physical
cleanup of massacre sites and by the intimidation of witnesses,''
the report said.
<p>
   It also said killings appear to be continuing, especially in
eastern Congo's North Kivu province.
<p>
   ``Many of the killings in recent months have been related to
unresolved issues of land rights, customary power and political
leadership,'' the report said. ``Many returning Tutsis have been
attacked by what they describe as a mix'' of Rwandan Hutu
militiamen and tribal minorities.
<p>
   It said residents of the eastern Congo city of Goma ``also
reported a general insecurity in the town due in large part to
frequent looting and killings by Rwandan soldiers, who often slip
across the border to Rwanda following abuses.''

RETRANSMITTING
Yeltsin in Strasbourg says won't seek third term as president
By DEBORAH SEWARD
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  Boris Yeltsin said Thursday he would
not seek a third term as president and predicted a young, energetic
democrat would become Russia's next leader.
<p>
   Speaking firmly after arriving in Strasbourg, France for a
summit of European leaders, Yeltsin said he was the guarantor of
Russia's constitution and had no intention of changing it to be
able to run again.
<p>
   ``I will not run for a third term and because of that will not
change the constitution. When my two terms are up, there will be a
new, spirited, energetic democrat,'' in my place, Yeltsin said.
<p>
   Yeltsin's declaration he would not seek to run a third time when
his term as president expires in the year 2000 comes after more
than a month of speculation about his real political intentions.
<p>
   Just a week ago while attending a trade fair in the central
Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod, Yeltsin, 66, hinted he was still
undecided as to whether to seek a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin, who became Russia's first democratically elected
president in 1991, on Sept. 1 had flatly declared he would not seek
a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin's political allies had reportedly been seeking ways to
allow him to seek a new four-year term. Two terms are the limit
under Russia's new constitution adopted in 1993, but Yeltsin could
claim he had not actually served two full terms under it.
<p>
   However, in Strasbourg, Yeltsin said, ``I am the guarantor of
the constitution and above all must show I will carry it out.''
<p>
   Yeltsin, 66, has a long history of health problems and underwent
heart bypass surgery a year ago. But he now appears robust, and
there is no doubt he intends to serve out this term.
<p>
   A host of presidential contenders are already casting their eyes
on the 2000 presidential elections, including current Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, his first deputy Boris Nemtsov, a
young energetic reformer. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzkhov and Yeltsin
opponents such as Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, former
security chief Alexander Lebed and ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky are also possible candidates.
<p>
   After arriving in Strasbourg, Yeltsin also said he hoped for a
solution to the conflict with the Duma, the lower house of the
Russian parliament, which is dominated by his opponents.
<p>
   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, on Thursday pledged to hold a
no-confidence vote in the government next week following sharp
differences over next year's budget.
<p>
   Addressing the issue of the new post-Cold War Europe, Yeltsin
said he thought it would take at least 10 years for his country to
fully integrate into Europe.
<p>
   Yeltsin is scheduled to have dinner with French President
Jacques Chirac on Thursday evening and will address the Council of
Europe summit Friday afternoon.
<p>
   As one of his goals, Yeltsin has said he wants to persuade
fellow leaders to lessen United States influence on the European
continent.

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small charter plane carrying seven
German tourists crashed Thursday morning as it prepared to land at
the Banjul airport, killing all but one person on board, officials
said.
<p>
   The crash happened about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers short of the
airport in Banjul, the capital of this West African nation, said
Claud Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil Aviation
Authority.
<p>
   The plane crashed because of a storm, according to a statement
from Naysa, the Spanish company that owned the plane. It gave no
further details on the cause of the crash.
<p>
   Jensen said the crash was being investigated, but noted that the
airport had lost contact with the plane shortly before it slammed
into the ground.
<p>
   He had no information on the weather at the time of the crash.
<p>
   The flight originated in Las Palmas, the principal city of Grand
Canary Island, one of a string of Spanish islands off the coast of
Morocco, Jensen said.
<p>
   The passengers  &MD;  five men and two women  &MD;  were German, said
Pascal Hector, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry. He said
one male passenger escaped with minor injuries.
<p>
   The two-person crew was Spanish, according to Sebastian Drover,
the Spanish vice consul in Banjul.

   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Sweden's foreign minister said Thursday
that the government wants to deepen its cooperation with NATO, but
said the country is still committed to neutrality.
<p>
   Lena Hjelm-Wallen made the statement in submitting the
government's proposal to Parliament for legislative changes that
would allow Sweden to participate in the expansion of the
alliance's Partnership for Peace activities.
<p>
   PFP exercises are being expanded to include all forms of
crisis-management with the exception of pure defense exercises. As
part of the expansion, PFP countries also will be allowed to put
officers on NATO staffs throughout Europe.
<p>
   The Swedish government also wants approval to have its
ambassador to Belgium be its representative to NATO headquarters.
<p>
   ``When Swedish soldiers are placed in a military action for
maintaining peace, the government must also be guaranteed a say,''
Hjelm-Wallen said.
<p>
   But, she added, ``this deepened cooperation does not imply any
step toward membership in NATO.''

Thatcher takes aim at British Airways tail logos
AP Photo planned

AP Business Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  British Airways must have hoped the last shot had
been fired at its new tail designs  &MD;  but ex-prime minister Margaret
Thatcher on Thursday raised her still-influential voice against the
removal of the Union Jack logos.
<p>
   ``We fly the British flag, not these awful things you are
putting on tails,'' Lady Thatcher told the British Airways workers
who happened to be on duty at a corporate booth set up for the
annual conference of the opposition Conservative Party.
<p>
   In case anyone possibly could have missed her point, Lady
Thatcher pulled out a handkerchief and wrapped it around a model
British Airways jet to cover up the colorful new logo.
<p>
   British Airways characterized the exchange as ``a light-hearted
discussion with her about our new identity, which we enjoyed.''
<p>
   ``She has always been a great supporter of all things British
and so are we,'' British Airways spokeswoman Kate Gay said.
<p>
   British Airways hit severe public relations turbulence after
announcing in June it would replace its old Union Jack-style logos
on the jet fleet with an array of colorful designs from around the
world.
<p>
   Lady Thatcher was prime minister from 1979-90 and was
responsible for selling off formerly state-run British Airways on
the London Stock Exchange  &MD;  a deal often held up as one of
Britain's most successful privatizations.
<p>
   Although Lady Thatcher is a huge preacher of free enterprise,
her remarks sidestepped the fact that the use of the new logos is a
commercial decision by airline executives who believe they can
boost business by appealing to more travelers from overseas.
<p>
   Chief executive Bob Ayling says the designs reflect the global
character of the highly successful airline  &MD;  but many Britons have
not been amused to see native African and Asian artwork on the jets
that used the fly the British flag around the world.
<p>
   ``Absolutely terrible,'' Lady Thatcher said, even though the
British Airways workers at the political convention in Blackpool,
England, pointed out that some of the tail designs are from British
artists.
<p>
   British Airways had previously gotten an earful about the tail
designs and acknowledges nearly a third of the Britons it has
talked to don't like them, although it says the vast majority of
foreigners are favorably impressed.

BC-France-Jobs Conference
Strikes and threatening words before talks on cutting work week
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Trying to slash 12.5 percent unemployment,
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin faces a tightrope walk in
talks with labor and business on Europe's struggle to create jobs
and compete globally.
<p>
   Tough posturing by French business and unions ahead of Jospin's
jobs conference opening Friday could mean trouble, posing his
toughest challenge yet as he grapples with high taxes, extensive
social benefits and restrictive labor laws.
<p>
   Most of Europe appears headed toward loosening strict employment
and business laws to spur U.S.-style job-creation. Still, debate
over cutting the work week to spread jobs around has drawn
attention across the continent and even shaken Italy's government
this week.
<p>
   Jospin's governing coalition could erode, too, if his Communist
allies dig in their heels on demands for a shorter week with the
same pay. The left made that campaign promise to defeat President
Jacques Chirac's conservatives in June parliamentary elections.
<p>
   In a shot across the bow, the Communist-led CGT's transit union
Wednesday spearheaded the first strike to challenge Jospin since he
came to power.
<p>
   ``If this conference ends in disillusion, the quake could be
strong in the working world,'' CGT chief Louis Viannet said in the
newspaper La Croix. He co-led a crippling strike in late 1995
against the conservatives' belt-tightening reform.
<p>
   At the same time, business leaders and analysts argue that
cutting the 39-hour work week to 35 and maintaining the same pay
could spell disaster.
<p>
   The shorter week would mean ``an unacceptable added cost and
certainly more unemployment,'' said Jean Gandois, the hard-nosed
president of the National Confederation of French Employers (CNPF).
<p>
   Ahead of Friday's meeting, the government has sought to temper
its campaign promise. Changes in work time should ``not threaten
business competitiveness,'' Labor Minister Martine Aubry noted in
Thursday's edition of the weekly Nouvel Observateur magazine.
<p>
   Jospin's dilemma isn't unique. In Italy, Communist pressure to
reduce the work week to 35 hours was among the issues that weakened
Premier Romani Prodi. He offered to move toward 35 hours, but the
Communists still rejected his budget deal, prompting him to resign
Thursday.
<p>
   Unions in other countries have pressed for a shorter work week,
and there are some success stories. Volkswagen saved thousands of
jobs with a 28-hour week combined with a pay cut.
<p>
   Shorter hours can create jobs ```but it's important to avoid
this spilling over into labor costs,'' said Jorgen Elmeskov at the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation,
the industrialized world's official think tank.
<p>
   Analysts and other European officials think cuts in hours should
take a back seat to other measures.
<p>
   A European Union jobs conference is planned Nov. 20 in
Luxembourg, and an EU study last week said flexible working
arrangements instead of reduced hours ``have been the main focus of
action.''
<p>
   Britain has fewer rules governing the work place than many
European countries, which business leaders cite as one reason for
its recent economic successes including lower unemployment.
<p>
   A new study by analysts at Price Waterhouse and the French-based
Bipe group found France lacks flexibility in the labor market and
suffers from over-regulation and high business taxes. While
France's higher-skilled jobs are highly productive, less-skilled
jobs are not, the study said.
<p>
   ``Thirty-five hours is not the main problem,'' said Denis
Collart, a co-author of the 100-page study, which surveyed 400
French and foreign businesses last spring for then-Industry
Minister Franck Borotra.
<p>
   Among the study's suggestions is loosening labor laws to allow
businesses to count work hours annually, giving them freedom to
vary schedules according to business activity.
<p>
   ``Maybe they can work up to 50 hours some weeks, without
overtime,'' he said.
<p>
   The study also favors extending limits on temporary contracts,
which currently last up to six months and are renewable once.

   A tearful televised reunion last summer between Margalit Omessi
and Tsila Levine of Sacramento provided what appeared to be the
missing link in a chain of evidence pointing to a 1950s scheme to
take children from Yemenite immigrants and give them to
European-descended families, many survivors of the Holocaust.
<p>
   Hundreds of toddlers and babies disappeared during the confusion
that accompanied the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants
after the creation of the Jewish state. Assertions that most of
them died of disease have been rejected by the families.
<p>
   But DNA tests by the state-run Abu Kabir Forensic Institute
failed to confirm family ties between Omessi and Levine, officials
said Thursday. ``She is not the daughter,'' said Health Ministry
director Gabi Barabash.
<p>
   Abu Kabir director Yehuda Hess said the institute's test was
more specific than an earlier test done at a Hebrew University lab
that found a DNA match between the women.
<p>
   Levine rejected the latest findings.
<p>
   ``Why should I rely on tests by the Health Ministry, the same
government body that knew of the disappearance of the children of
Yemenites and other ethnic groups years ago?'' she told a radio
interviewer. ``I have found the truth and I am happy with the
truth. I believe with all my heart that this is my mother.''
<p>
   Levine, 50, had grown up wondering why she was so much darker
than the other children on her kibbutz, almost all of whom were of
European background.
<p>
   Eventually her parents told her she had been adopted, but they
knew little of her origins. When she turned 18, she tried
unsuccessfully to find the identities of her biological parents.
Years later, she moved to the United States with her husband and
two sons.
<p>
   Two months ago, she returned to Israel and published two
photographs of herself in a newspaper, one taken when she was a
baby, the other in the past year.
<p>
   Omessi thought she recognized her baby Saada, who disappeared
one day almost 50 years ago from a clinic.
<p>
   When the initial DNA test proved positive, the reunion became a
national sensation and boosted claims that there had been a
systematic kidnapping of babies.
<p>
   The new test spawned suggestions of a coverup.
<p>
   Levine's attorney Rami Tsuberi said he was suspicious of the
results because they were leaked to the press by the Health
Ministry, breaking a promise of confidentiality.
<p>
   The discrepancy was also challenged by Hassan Khatib, the Hebrew
University genetics expert who performed the first test.
<p>
   Khatib said he used a method accepted in courts and forensic
institutions worldwide and said no DNA test was foolproof.
<p>
   Levine said she plans to settle the issue by bringing the Omessi
family to the United States to do another DNA test with the FBI.
<p>
   Meanwhile, in Thursday's New York Times, the Yemenite Jewish
Federation of America placed a full-page ad asking for financial
help in reuniting Yemenite families.
<p>
   The ad displayed a picture of Levine and Omessi with the
caption: ``Mother and daughter reunited after 49 years.''
<p>
   A government-appointed committee is investigating the issue in
Israel.
<p>
   The inquiry was set up after Yemenite radical Uzi Meshulam and a
group of armed followers barricaded themselves in a house near Tel
Aviv for six weeks in 1994 to demand an investigation.
<p>
   The findings of two previous inquiries were inconclusive and
have been dismissed by the Yemenite community as whitewash.
<p>
   The issue is reflects the continuing social gaps between the
Sephardi Jews of Middle Eastern descent and the European-descended
Ashkenazim, who are socially and economically dominant. Israel's
4.7 million Jews are about equally divided between the groups.

   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)  &MD;  Fierce fighting broke out Thursday in
southern Somalia between Hussein Aidid's forces and the Rahanwein
Resistance Army, which supports rival faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
<p>
   The combat began after a few hundred Rahanwein militiamen armed
with assault rifles slipped into Baidoa to attack Aidid's bases, a
Rahanwein source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Both sides claimed to control Baidoa, 245 kilometers (150 miles)
southwest of Mogadishu. Aidid's side had no other comment.
<p>
   No casualty figures were available.
<p>
   Somalia has had no central government since the ouster of late
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, when the county disintegrated
among warring factions.
<p>
   -----
<p>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP)  &MD;  Nigeria has again demanded that the
British embassy stop stamping ``rejected'' on the passports of
people denied visas to Britain.
<p>
   The Foreign Affairs Ministry, in a statement issued Wednesday
after a meeting between minister Tom Ikimi and British High
Commissioner Graham Burton, said it regarded the practice as
``inappropriate and totally unacceptable.''
<p>
   The protest, to Nigeria's former colonial power, was the second
since June over the stamping.
<p>
   The ``rejected'' stamp on passports makes it difficult for
people to obtain entry permits to other countries, Nigerians say.
<p>
   The statement further asked the British embassy to refund all
fees paid by Nigerian visa applicants and demanded that it reveal
the number of Nigerians who had applied for U.K visas since June,
with a breakdown of successful and rejected applications.
<p>
   In June, the British High Commission denied allegations by the
Nigerian government that only 25 percent of visa applications by
Nigerians were accepted.

<p>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  The United States government has
reduced its aid to South Africa by 30 percent over last year, part
of a 10 year phase-out of foreign aid which is expected to end in
2005.
<p>
   ``The assumption is that trade with the United States will be on
the increase,'' said Susan Wolfe, spokeswoman for U.S. Agency for
International Development in Pretoria. `South Africa has always
said donor assistance is important but they want to carry their own
ball forward.''
<p>
   The increased trade will balance the decreasing levels of aid,
which is dlrs 110 million this year, Wolfe said Thursday. Last
year's figure was dlrs 164 million.
<p>
   Direct aid to South African government agencies will be about
dlrs 45 million, with the dlrs 20 million going to education. The
remaining dlrs 65 million will go to private organizations and loan
guarantees for businesses.
<p>
   From the mid 1980s until 1994's first all-race elections, most
of the 4.5 billion rand (dlrs 1 billion) in total U.S. aid to South
Africa went to non governmental organizations.
<p>
   ----
<p>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP)  &MD;  Mozambique's government
Telecommunications Company, TDM, is exploring ways to privatize the
country's telephone system.
<p>
   At a two-day international conference on Wednesday in Maputo,
Transport and Communications Minister Paulo Muxanga said
improvement of the phone system was an economic necessity.
<p>
   ``Communications tend to expand both internal and regional
markets,'' the minister said.
<p>
   Velerio Matete, a member of the TDM board of directors, said the
company would like to see national and foreign businessmen
investing in TDM.
<p>
   `The presence of foreign delegations at the conference is not a
joke,'' he said.
<p>
   The socialist government of President Joaquim Chissano was
returned to power in 1994's first democratic elections. Since then
it has done an economic about-face, embarking on one of the most
ambitious privatization efforts in all of Africa.
<p>

<p>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian
Severin plans to visit South Africa next week, the Romanian embassy
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Severin will meet starting Tuesday with his South African
counterpart Alfred Nzo to discuss political links and expansion of
trade and an air services agreement.
<p>
   ``We both went through an intense period of transformation in
the early '90s to introduce democracy for all our citizens,'' said
charge d'affairs Dumitru Neagu in making the announcement. ``(But)
South Africa's transition was smooth while we had a bloody
changeover of power.''
<p>
   Trade between South AFrican and Romania was about dlrs 18
million last year. Romanian exports to South Africa include cars,
tractors, glassware and furniture. It imports iron ore, coal and
telecommunication equipment from South Africa.
<p>

<p>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Rain and air force firefighters by
Thursday had quelled bush fires which have destroyed game and
cattle farms and more than 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of
grazing land.
<p>
   Fires thought to have been sparked by lightning swept through
the Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces earlier this week, nearly
claiming three game lodges and killing cattle and wildlife,
including three rhinoceros.
<p>
   Spokeswoman Lt. Col. Laverne Machine said army and air force
intervention played a major role in putting out the fires. Thirty
millimeters of rain also fell in the Northern Province Wednesday
night.
<p>
   Farmers said they needed at least two good rainy seasons for
burnt grazing land to grow back. Weather experts are predicting
drought for much of Southern Africa in the coming season, due to
the raised temperature of the El Nino ocean current.
<p>
   ``If we don't get some rain soon and if temperatures don't
subside, we are in real trouble,'' said Willie Lewies, chairman of
the Transvaal Agricultural Union's Northern Transvaal region.

DNA test by state lab contradicts mother-daughter claim

<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Results from new genetic testing released on
Thursday called into question claims that a Yemenite Jewish
immigrant to Israel and a woman living in California are mother and
daughter.
<p>
   A tearful televised reunion last summer between Margalit Omessi
and Tsila Levine of Sacramento provided what appeared to be the
missing link in a chain of evidence pointing to a 1950s scheme to

Artist detained after exhibiting statue with human bones
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An artist who hoped to win a prize with an
unusual statue that incorporated human and animal bones instead
wound up in jail, charged with desecration of the dead.
<p>
   Ahmed Desouki Korali's composition went on display earlier this
week at the Ninth Exhibition for Young Artists in Cairo. The statue
 &MD;  which included human arm and leg bones, a cat skull and a sheep
spine  &MD;  was covered with transparent polyester to create a mummy
effect.
<p>
   Some viewers were alarmed, and judges at the exhibition called
the police, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported Thursday.
<p>
   Korali, charged with violating a law that forbids tampering with
the dead, later was released on dlrs 147 bail. He could not be
reached for comment.
<p>
   An undertaker was also detained  &MD;  for acquiring the human bones,
apparently from the Khanka cemetery in central Cairo, the paper
said. The statue was being examined by Egyptian forensic officials.
<p>
   It was a reversal of fortunes for Korali, who two years ago won
first prize for sculpture at the same exhibition.

The 1990s dictionary: toyboy, mouse potato and ethnic cleansing
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Looking for notable new words of the 1990s? Try
``toyboy,'' ``mouse potato'' and ``ethnic cleansing.'' Or maybe
you're into ``pharm,'' ``green shoots'' and the ``marzipan layer.''
<p>
   The Oxford Dictionary of New Words published Thursday includes
new words and phrases that have been in the news, with explanations
of how they came to prominence.
<p>
   In British slang, a ``toyboy'' is an attractive young man who is
``kept'' as a lover by an older person, usually a woman. But the
dictionary notes that ``in an interesting reversal of meaning, it
is a boy toy rather than toyboy that has caught on in the U.S. to
refer to men as well.''
<p>
   ``Mouse potato'' is slang for a person who spends an excessive
amount of time in front of a computer, especially someone who uses
it online, according to the dictionary.
<p>
   A ``pharm'' is ``a place where genetically modified plants or
animals are grown or reared in order to produce pharmaceutical
products.'' There are also new meanings to old phrases, like
``green shoots,'' which don't spring from the ground but are signs
of economic recovery.
<p>
   The concept of dress-down Friday  &MD;  wearing casual clothes to
work to reduce stress  &MD;  is included. So is the glass ceiling, that
invisible barrier preventing advancement, and the ``marzipan
layer,'' a phrase used on the British stock market to denote
stockbroking executives immediately below the partners in a firm.
<p>
   The U.S. political scene makes several contributions: former
President George Bush's ``vision thing,'' ``smoke and mirrors,''
and ``Whitewatergate.'' The Czech Republic and Slovakia contributed
the ``velvet revolution'' and ``velvet divorce,'' and former
Yugoslavia gave the dictionary ``ethnic cleansing.''
<p>
   Editor Elizabeth Knowles wrote in the preface that political
correctness has gained such a high profile that ``PC, for
politically correct, may be used pejoratively as well as
approvingly.''
<p>
   The dictionary, published by Oxford University Press, sells for
14.99 pounds (dlrs 24).

Foreign minister Levy threatening to resign
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said
Thursday that he may resign because of his troubled relations with
Benjamin Netanyahu, and suggested his health had suffered because
of tension with the prime minister.
<p>
   Levy told Israel Radio he was not consulted about the decision
to order Israeli agents to assassinate a militant Islamic leader in
Jordan, and that he would have opposed the plan.
<p>
   The botched Sept. 25 attack on Khaled Mashaal only strengthened
the militant group and damaged Israel's international standing and
its relations with its closest Arab ally, Jordan, Levy said.
<p>
   ``The damage is definitely grave ... to everything,'' Levy said.
Asked about the chances that he might resign, Levy replied, ``about
50-50.''
<p>
   Levy's relations with Netanyahu have been rocky since the
government was formed, and Netanyahu and his aides have kept Levy
and the Foreign Ministry on the margins of policymaking.
<p>
   However, Levy denied reports that Netanyahu failed to inform him
about his meeting Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat  &MD; 
the first such summit in eight months.
<p>
   Levy, who was hospitalized Tuesday night with chest pains, said
his condition was caused by overwork, but admitted that it was
aggravated by his anger with Netanyahu.
<p>
   ``I have no doubt,'' he said when asked about this.
<p>
   Media reports said Levy almost refused to receive Netanyahu when
he visited him at the hospital in Afula. The reports quoted Levy as
saying, ``I've had it with this man.''
<p>
   Doctors say Levy, 59, did not suffer a heart attack.

Brazilian coffee exports, earnings rise in September
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  Brazilian coffee exports rose 9 percent
in September and earnings nearly doubled from a year earlier,
exporters said Thursday.
<p>
   Exports last month climbed to 1.25 million bags, from 1.15
million bags in September 1996, according to figures from the
Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters, Febec.
<p>
   In the first nine months, exports jumped to 10.9 million bags, a
43 percent increase from the same period in 1996. Febec said the
rise brings exports back to normal levels, after two frosts reduced
the harvest in the previous crop year. Febec said exports should
remain steady till the end of the year.
<p>
   September's exports earned dlrs 244.3 million, way above the
dlrs 142 million of a year ago. The reason was the higher average
price, which rose to dlrs 194.40 per bag from dlrs 122.65 in
September 1996. Each bag contains 132 pounds (60 kilograms) of
coffee beans.
<p>
   Export earnings in the first nine months totaled dlrs 2.05
billion, up from dlrs 1.04 billion in the same period last year.
The average export price through September was dlrs 187.53 per bag,
up from dlrs 136.41 in the same period of 1996.

   September's exports consisted of 1.219 million bags of arabica,
while the rest was the inferior conillon variety, the Brazilian
equivalent of African robusta.

Italy's Prodi government falls under Communist weight
EDs: AMs, recasts, updates with new quotes, background

<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  A small Communist party, whose leader reveres Fidel
Castro and courted Mexican guerrillas, brought down Italy's 55th
post-war government on Thursday.
<p>
   Premier Romano Prodi resigned after his Marxist allies refused
to stomach welfare cuts that the government says are vital for
Italy's entry into the European money club.
<p>
   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked him to stay on as a
caretaker while he consults with political leaders on forming a new
government. Prodi's deputy premier, Walter Veltroni, said he
believed new national elections would be necessary  &MD;  Italy's third
in six years.
<p>
   Prodi had staked his government on joining the continent's
currency union, scheduled for 1999. His government even imposed a
heavy onetime ``Eurotax'' to bring Italy's finances in line.
<p>
   His resignation will confirm worries by Italy's European allies
that it has yet to shed the instability that has plagued Italian
government for decades. And the crisis was another example of the
difficulty European governments are having in getting their peoples
to stomach painful budget cuts to conform to European Union
guidelines.
<p>
   Prodi's fall ends the first leftist dominated government since
World War II and comes despite his repeated pledges that he would
last the full five-year term after elections in April 1996.
<p>
   The main component in the coalition was the Democratic Party of
the Left.
<p>
   The Left Party was the post-Berlin Wall incarnation of Italy's
old Communist Party, once the largest in the West. The far-left
fringe of the party stayed behind as the Communist Refoundation.
<p>
   Prodi's coalition fell short of a majority in the Chamber of
Deputies, so it had to rely on Refoundation's votes  &MD;  giving the
party, which had won 8 percent of the vote, enormous influence.
When Refoundation and its leader Fausto Bertinotti refused to
support the budget, Prodi effectively lost his majority and had no
choice but to leave.
<p>
   ``It will have to be said that you, Honorable Bertinotti,
knowingly chose to open a long and difficult crisis,'' Prodi said
in Parliament.
<p>
   Prodi announced his resignation after a week of wrangling and
parliamentary debate over his 1998 budget law, which sought to trim
pensions by 4.5 trillion lire (dlrs 2.6 billion).
<p>
   Refoundation had sought a promise that pensions not be touched
and wanted concessions on health care, job creation and a shorter
work week.
<p>
   Prodi said the government was ready to move toward a 35-hour
work week, from 40 hours. He made small bows in promising to put
off privatization of the state electrical company and to cut health
care costs. But it wasn't enough.
<p>
   The man who brought down the government, Bertinotti, has spent
most of his entire adult life as a union organizer, labor
federation leader and political party chief.
<p>
   At 57, he is a Communist with an aristocratic accent and
well-tailored suits who eagerly beat a path Fidel Castro's door
when the Cuban leader came to Rome last year and visited the
Zapatista National Liberation Army in Mexico. After meeting with
their leader, Subcommandante Marcos, he earned the title
Subcommandante Fausto in the Italian press.
<p>
   Refoundation followers still wave the hammer and sickle and sing
the Communist ``Internationale'' at gatherings. The party opposes
big business, wants to keep industry in government hands and
champions the worker.

Swiss fund to start paying Holocaust survivors by late November
By BALZ BRUPPACHER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  A 270 million Swiss franc (dlrs 190
million) fund set up by Swiss banks to aid needy Holocaust victims
will be able to make its first payments by late November, officials
said Thursday.
<p>
   The president and secretary-general of the fund cleared
procedures with representatives of the World Jewish Restitution
Organization during a meeting in New York this week, said a
statement.
<p>
   President Rolf Bloch, a widely respected Swiss Jewish leader,
and Secretary-General Marco Sassoli, a former official of the Red
Cross, agreed to a system developed by the organization to screen
Jewish applicants and give them benefits.
<p>
   The Jewish organization will immediately start using the system
to create formal applications from the 28,000 names of Jews in
Eastern Europe presented to Swiss authorities last month in
Budapest, Hungary, and New York.
<p>
   ``Once such a formal application is submitted, the members of
the fund executive, including those three recommended by the WJRO,
should be rapidly able to decide on it,'' said the statement.
<p>
   ``The first payments from the funds which are ready to benefit
needy Jewish Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe should begin
within six weeks,'' it added.
<p>
   The idea of the fund is to provide speedy aid to aging survivors
of Nazi atrocities who then lived for decades under communist rule
in eastern Europe.
<p>
   The money was provided as a goodwill gesture by Swiss banks and
industry while slower efforts continue to help heirs recover the
assets deposited in Switzerland by their relatives who perished at
the hands of the Nazis.
<p>
   Although the three largest Swiss banks started off the fund last
winter, destitute victims have yet to see anything because of
wrangling between international Jewish leaders and the Swiss.
<p>
   The money also is for other victims of the Nazis, such as
gypsies and homosexuals, but officials have said those payments
will take longer because they are not as well organized as the
Jewish victims.
<p>
   Selected Holocaust victims will be eligible for payments of up
to dlrs 1,000.
<p>
   Although the amount is regarded by some as too little in view of
their suffering, it is a relative fortune for elderly and infirm
Jews in the former Soviet bloc. Their average age is about 80, and
many are living in extremer poverty.
<p>
   The executive board of the fund agreed in July to set aside 15
million francs (dlrs 10 million) for priority Jewish cases and 2
million francs (dlrs 1.4 million) for others selected for the first
payment.

   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Maurice Papon, the former French Cabinet
minister accused of crimes against humanity during World War II,
suffered a small heart problem Thursday but returned to the
courtroom a half hour later.
<p>
   Papon's lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut said his client suffered ``a
shock to the heart,'' but Papon seemed fine when he returned to the
courtroom.
<p>
   A doctor examined the former Vichy official and administered a
spray under Papon's tongue, which allowed him to participate in the
rest of Thursday's hearings, Varaut said.
<p>
   Papon fell ill in a corridor outside the courtroom, minutes
after judges ordered a break after a three-hour session, Varaut
said.
<p>
   Earlier, Varaut had argued that Papon could not get a fair trial
and asked that proceedings be halted.

European presidents and PMs grapple with human rights, stability
By JEFFREY ULBRICH

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Presidents and prime ministers from 40
European nations grapple with a new Europe Friday, trying to come
to terms with issues such as human rights and stability in the
continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit, with new members such as
Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, wants to reassert the organization's
basic values of promoting democracy, human rights, human dignity
and the rule of law at a time when those ideals remain fragile in a
number of countries.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who announced Thursday he would
not seek a third term, says he wants to convince fellow leaders to
try to lessen Washington's influence on the continent.
<p>
   ``We do not want the United States to be involved in Europe the
way it is now,'' he said recently. ``We want a multipolar world in
which no country tells the others what to do.''
<p>
   Though this is the official Russian line, the reality is Moscow
remains preoccupied with domestic problems and foreign policy
clearly is a secondary concern. It has accepted the inevitability
of NATO's enlargement, and after an initial burst of opposition,
rarely is a word heard on the subject.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Moscow's full integration into democratic
Europe.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, But
that doesn't mean it won't try to exert its influence.
<p>
   Last month Washington circulated an unofficial paper criticizing
Croatia's failure to ensure press freedom and civil liberties. It
proposed suspending Croatia from the Council until it improves its
human rights record.
<p>
   The Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   John Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
democracy and human rights who is heading the American observer
team at the summit, said the United States had backed off its
proposal on Croatia. That decision, he said, came after 10
suspected Croatian war criminals surrendered to authorities.
<p>
   Shattuck said the United States was not ``at this moment''
seeking the suspension of Croatia from the Council of Europe.
<p>
   ``At the time our paper was presented there had been very
limited cooperation,'' he said. ``Now, we see more.''
<p>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a letter to President Jacques
Chirac of France, host of the summit, declared Washington would
contribute dlrs 1 million toward the operation of the Bosnian human
rights commission, administered by the Council of Europe.
<p>
   Major aims of the summit will be to create a single, permanent
European Court of Human Rights by 1998, available to more than 800
million Europeans; to take action against corruption, money
laundering and organized crime; to ban cloning of human beings; and
to fight racism and intolerance.
<p>
   ``We expect it to be a manifestation of European Unity,'' said
Daniel Tarschys, the Council's secretary-general. At a time when
the European Union and NATO are enlarging, some countries are being
left out. The Council, he said, ``tries to work for a Europe where
everyone feels included.
<p>
   The existing system for implementing the European Human Rights
Convention is a two-tiered setup that first involves a European
Human Rights Commission that decides if a case is admissible, then
tries to settle it through friendly negotiations. Failing that, it
goes to the Court of Human rights.
<p>
   That was fine with a dozen member states, but has become
unwieldy with 40, often taking five years or more to deal with a
case. The Council wants to streamline that, making the process more
efficient and accessible.
<p>
   Another proposal would set up a corruption-prevention body as a
focal point for cooperation on corruption, organized crime and
money laundering.
<p>
   The Council of Europe, created in 1949 and with a current budget
of 153 million European currency units (dlrs 171 million), has a
reputation as something of a talk shop lacking real political
punch, a framer of ringing declarations backed by little
discernible action.
<p>
   Asked how Europe would be a better place after the summit,
Tarschys said even if the people of Europe ``don't wake up the next
morning flabbergasted by what we've done,'' it would serve as an
impetus for action.
<p>
   ``The ringing declaration at the end will be a signal to us to
get to work,'' he said.

Big British drink companies to label alcohol content
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Five of the biggest British liquor and beer
companies said Thursday they will put new labels on their drinks to
give tipplers a better idea of how much alcohol they are consuming.
<p>
   Some competitors are resisting the move, citing European Union
rules that will keep such labels off imported spirits and wine.
<p>
   Drink containers sold in Britain already show the percentage of
alcohol by volume, but the new labels will specify the number of
``units'' of alcohol in each bottle or can.
<p>
   One ``unit'' equals 8 grams of pure alcohol, or about the same
amount in half a pint of beer, one small glass of wine or a
standard measure of spirits. British doctors recommend consumption
of no more than three or four units daily for men and two or three
units daily for women.
<p>
   The labels will be put on drinks from five big producers: Allied
Domecq, Guinness PLC, IDV, Seagram and Whitbread. The companies
said they acted voluntarily to help the government's campaign
promoting sensible drinking.
<p>
   Bass Brewers is one big company that won't go along for now,
citing the ``disparities that will exist between drinks of U.K.
origin and imported drinks'' and pointing out that EU rules keep
such labels off of wine.
<p>
   The new labels will start appearing in a few months, after the
companies take time to design them and sell off stocks with the old
labels.

Italian playwright Dario Fo wins Nobel Prize for Literature
Eds: RECASTS throughout to ADD details, background, reaction from
Vatican and Fo's wife
By KATARINA BJARVALL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Italy's Dario Fo, whose plays have made
audiences roar with laughter and authorities seethe with anger, won
the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
<p>
   Fo, 71, who is also an actor, was cited by the Swedish Academy
for ``scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the
downtrodden.''
<p>
   A left-wing sympathizer and anti-establishment figure, Fo was
not on the critics' lists of potential winners.
<p>
   ``I'm amazed,'' Fo said when he learned he won the award, this
year worth 7.5 million kronor (dlrs 1 million).
<p>
   The Vatican's official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, also
used the word ``amazed'' to describe its reaction.
<p>
   ``Giving the prize to an actor who is also an author of
debatable texts ... has surpassed all imagination,'' the newspaper
wrote in a brief editorial.
<p>
   Fo and his wife, Franca Rame, founded a theater company in 1959.
Since then they have satirized much of post-war Italian politics
and scandals that brought down politicians and businessmen in the
early 1990s.
<p>
   ``Dario Fo has taken great risks and been very brave, and he has
had to suffer the consequences of that,'' said Sture Allen,
permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.
<p>
   Fo has been arrested several times and his work was banned from
state-run radio and TV until 1977.
<p>
   In 1980, he and his wife were refused visas to the United States
because of their support for left-wing activities in Italy. In
1984, the U.S. government relented and allowed the couple to
briefly visit New York to see a production of ``Accidental Death of
an Anarchist,'' one of Fo's best known plays.
<p>
   Fo still cuts a political figure. Two weeks ago, he hit
headlines when participating in a demonstration that ridiculed the
Northern League, a separatist group in northern Italy.
<p>
   Fo was introduced to narrative traditions at an early age
through his grandfather, a well-known storyteller. At age 25, he
began to write and act satirical cabarets at the Piccolo Theater in
Milan.
<p>
   Bjoern Linnell, a Swedish literary critic and former publisher,
said that Fo is a playwright ``of the people.''
<p>
   ``He both learns from the people and gives back to the people,''
Linnell said.
<p>
   Fo's most popular and noted plays include ``Mistero Buffo,
``Can't Pay, Won't Pay'' and ``Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The latter is based on the right-wing bomb attacks in Italy in
1969, which officials and the press blamed on anarchists. The play
centers around a figure called Il Matto (The Maniac), ``who
possesses the kind of lunacy that lays bare the lies of
officialdom,'' the citation said.
<p>
   Fo told ANSA that he learned of the Nobel prize when he was
driving from Rome to Milan and another car drove by him holding up
a sign, ``Dario has won the Nobel.'' Rame suggested to RAI state TV
that her husband may have been teasing.
<p>
   Rame, whom Fo married in 1954, said her husband deserved the
award.
<p>
   ``It will pay him back for the many, many humiliations he has
suffered in his life,'' she said. ``I believe that today many
critics, when they hear this news, will have a heart attack.''
<p>
   Fo's Italian-born Swedish translator, Carlo Barsotti, said the
prize will split Italy in two.
<p>
   ``It's always been like that with Dario Fo. There are those who
will scream with joy, while reactionary people ... will turn up
their noses,'' Barsotti told the Swedish news agency TT.
<p>
   After being criticized for being biased in favor of males and
Europeans, the Swedish Academy which keeps a tight lid on its
deliberations, has over the last decades awarded the prize to more
women and to wider geographical areas.
<p>
   Still, some notable gaps occur. Only three writers from Asia
have won the prize.
<p>
   Names that consistently show up on speculators' lists include
Belgium's Hugo Claus, J.M. Coetzee of South Africa, Doris Lessing
of Britain and Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul.
<p>
   The literature prize was the second of this year's Nobels to be
announced. The medicine award was won on Monday by American Stanley
Prusiner for discoveries related to so-called ``mad cow disease''
and other brain-wasting conditions.
<p>
   The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The
economics prize comes Tuesday, followed by physics and chemistry on
Wednesday, all in Stockholm.

Ex-screen star convicted of inciting racial hatred
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  A French court on Thursday convicted Brigitte
Bardot of inciting racial hatred, fined her 10,000 francs (dlrs
1,600) and ordered her to pay a symbolic franc (20 cents) to human
rights groups that sued her.
<p>
   The 63-year-old former screen siren and animal rights campaigner
was taken to court again for criticizing the Muslim ritual
slaughter of sheep, after a court acquitted her.
<p>
   Bardot was sued for her commentary in the conservative daily Le
Figaro in April 1996, in which she blasted the four-day Eid al-Adha
spring festival.
<p>
   Married to a member of the anti-immigrant National Front, she
complained of ``foreign overpopulation'' and that the slaughter was
``torture, signs of the most atrocious pagan sacrifices.''
<p>
   The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship of People (MRAP)
said the court ruling ``honors justice and dishonors the woman who
was the symbol of a certain image of France.''
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from Miss Bardot or from her
animal rights group, the Bardot Foundation. She avoided the maximum
sentence of one year in prison and a fine of 300,000 francs (dlrs
60,000).
<p>
   Unrepentant, Bardot in April this year wrote another commentary
saying the ritual will ``bathe France's earth in blood'' and she
criticized what she said was the transformation of the country into
``a Muslim France.''
<p>
   Bardot's animal rights foundation calls for ritual slaughter to
take place in state-supervised slaughterhouses and for the animals
to be stunned before being killed.
<p>
   On Eid al-Adha, the celebration following the Islamic fast of
Ramadan, many of France's 3 million Muslims sacrifice a lamb in a
rite of peace, as God allowed Abraham to do instead of killing his
own son.

Hungary asks for rescheduling of European Athletics Championship
EDS: REPEATING to European points to restore `track' to slug.

<TEXT>
<p>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  &MD;  Organizers of the l998 European
Athletics Championships in Budapest want the event held a week
early to avoid a clash with the country's annual Formula One race,
the IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said Thursday.
<p>
   The Hungarian Grand Prix is to be held Aug. l6. The atheltics
meet is to start the following day, and the city's hotel capacity
simply cannot cope, the organizers argue.
<p>
   ``We have received a request saying Hungary would have a major
problem with Formula One being held Aug. 16th and the European
Athletics Championships starting on the 17th,'' Nebiolo told
reporters. ``However, we were assured that even if the date can't
be changed, the championships will be organized in the best
possible way.''
<p>
   He explained that the decision has to be made by the European
Council of the IAAF, and it must be before the end of October.
<p>
   ``We have accepted the request, we are looking into it. For us
it is one of the most important events of the year,'' Nebiolo said.

Bosnian Serbs win election in town lost in war

<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  A town Bosnian Serbs lost in
war may have been won back on the ballot.
<p>
   According to local election results announced Thursday, a Serb
party campaigning for return of refugees won 19 local council seats
in the western town of Drvar, compared to 11 for the ruling Croat
party.
<p>
   Before the war, 97 percent of Drvar's 17,000 residents were
Serb. Bosnian Croat refugees who poured into the region when
Muslims overtook their villages in central Bosnia now live there.
<p>
   International officials administering the elections processes in
Bosnia have insisted that refugees vote in their home town as a
means of reversing ethnic cleansing on all sides.
<p>
   As in so many disputed areas, handing over the town to the newly
elected officials will be difficult. The local Croat authorities in
Drvar continue to prevent Serb refugees from returning to their
pre-war homes.
<p>
   Earlier in the week, the NATO-led peace force deployed troops to
protect a group of Serbs from a Croat mob, international agencies
said Thursday.
<p>
   The incident was sparked when a group of Croat families took
over houses that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had
repaired for 27 Serb refugees.
<p>
   Peacekeepers were forced to intervene when scores of
construction workers and young men attempted to force the Serbs
out, said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the aid agency.
<p>
   Local Croatian and Bosnian media quoted the Croat mayor of
Drvar, Borivoje Malbasic, as claiming he was beaten up by
peacekeepers during the incident.
<p>
   NATO officials denied that Malbasic was beaten. Spokesman Maj.
Jan Joosten said Malbasic tried to drive through a NATO checkpoint
and knocked down a peacekeeper. Canadian military police who manned
the check point launched an investigation to confirm details.
<p>
   Results of the Sept. 13-14 elections indicated another possible
trouble zone in the northern Croat-held town of Zepce. The main
Muslim-led coalition won 39 of 42 seats in the council, but it is
likely that Croats will try to prevent them from taking over the
legislature.
<p>
   During voter registration this summer, several key Croat
candidates in Zepce were removed from voting lists for attempted
manipulation of the process and fraud.
<p>
   Following the punishment, the ruling Bosnian Croat party called
upon Croats to boycott the elections. As a result the Croat
Democratic Union won only three seats.

Central Bank raises interest rate to pre-empt inflation
Eds: AMs; RECASTS lead, new information in grafs 9-10 on France and
Netherlands, trims pvs

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates Thursday for the first time in more than five years, calling
it a precautionary move against inflation. Central banks in France,
the Netherlands and Denmark followed suit.
<p>
   The German Bundesbank announced it was increasing its securities
repurchase (repo) rates through Oct. 22 to 3.3 percent from 3
percent, to pre-empt higher inflation and help dampen growth in the
money supply.
<p>
   At the same time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and
Lombard rates unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent.
<p>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel called the moves ``an appropriate
preventative measure'' in view of the dollar's appreciation against
the mark since spring ``and the subsequent rise in import prices.''
<p>
   Import prices rose 5.4 percent in August, the biggest jump since
1989. Especially affected are commodities priced in dollars on the
world market, such as petroleum products.
<p>
   The dollar, which has been retreating since hitting an
eight-year high of 1.891 against the mark on Aug. 6, fell another
pfennig immediately after the bank's announcement, to 1.7415 marks.
<p>
   Waigel also said that the upswing in the German economy won't be
dampened by the Bundesbank's decision. Rates on long-term capital
loans to businesses, ``which are vital to investment and
employment,'' are not expected to be affected, he said in a
statement from Bonn.
<p>
   The Association of German Industry and Trade agreed, calling the
bank's decision ``moderate and appropriate.''
<p>
   Following the Bundesbank's announcement, the Bank of France in
Paris also raised it key intervention interest rates to 3.30
percent from a previous 3.10 percent.
<p>
   In Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank increased its fixed advance
rate to 2.75 percent from 2.5 percent, and in Copenhagen the Danish
central bank raised its discount and repurchase rates 0.25
percentage points to 3.50 and 3.75 percent respectively.
<p>
   The repo rate has become the German Bundesbank's main instrument
for influencing the money market. It is the rate the German central
bank charges banks for buying back short-term securities when banks
need cash for daily operations.
<p>
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which banks can borrow emergency
funds from the central banks and acts as an effective ceiling on
overnight rates. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank
refinancing.
<p>
   The last official interest rate increase was in July 1992, when
the discount rate was raised to 8.75 percent from 8 percent.
<p>
   Germany's discount rate has been at 2.5 percent and the Lombard
rate at 4.5 percent since April 1996.
<p>
   In August 1992, the repo rate, which then floated with the
market, averaged 9.7 percent from a previous average of 9.63. It
declined monthly after that until it settled at 3 percent in
September 1996. The Bundesbank fixed it at that rate this year
after it hadn't moved for six months.

Russian parliament backs off on Yeltsin budget resistance

<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's communist-led parliament backed away
Thursday from a showdown with President Boris Yeltsin, signaling
its readiness to compromise in what an official praised as ``a
victory for common sense.''
<p>
   While rejecting the government's austere 1998 draft budget, the
State Duma or lower house also voted to create a special commission
including government officials to revise it.
<p>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov reiterated plans for a
no-confidence vote in the government next week, telling a news
conference that Yeltsin's economic policies are ``doomed to
failure.''
<p>
   But despite his tough rhetoric, it was Zyuganov who came up with
the plan that could resolve the bitter dispute over the budget. The
Duma voted 326-13 to pass his compromise measure, setting up a
working commission of government officials and lawmakers to draft
budget changes.
<p>
   Legislators ignored calls from hard-liners to reject that
compromise and return the budget to the government.
<p>
   First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais called the budget
vote ``a clear victory for common sense and a defeat for those who
had extremist goals.''
<p>
   He said the government was ready to compromise with legislators
on a wide variety of issues.
<p>
   Yeltsin also welcomed the vote, telling reporters in Strasbourg,
France, that ``Everything will be in order with the budget,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   The commission, which is to hold its first meeting on Friday,
will try to reconcile Yeltsin's goal of a tight budget that limits
spending with the communists' desire to increase the amount of
money for social programs.
<p>
   Even if the Duma passes a no-confidence measure next week, it
would not have any immediate impact. The chamber must pass a second
no-confidence measure within three months in order to force Yeltsin
into making a choice: dismiss his Cabinet or dismiss parliament and
hold new parliamentary elections.
<p>
   Despite his sharp criticism of the Yeltsin administration,
Zyuganov also said the government had enough ``honest, decent
people'' and it's only necessary ``to create conditions to allow
these people to work.''
<p>
   This year's debate over the budget is similar to the battles
waged in recent years. Ultimately, the two sides have worked out
behind-the-scenes compromises and many observers expect the same
outcome this year despite the heated talk.
<p>
   Yeltsin has made clear he is prepared to dissolve the lower
house and call new elections if no-confidence motions are passed.
<p>
   He has repeatedly assailed the Duma for blocking his economic
plans, which include calls for tax reform and expanded land
ownership rights.
<p>
   In contrast to past budgets, the government is working from a
very conservative revenue estimate, forcing significant spending
cutbacks to keep the deficit under control.
<p>
   The budget calls for sharp cuts and forecasts overall economic
growth of 2 percent in 1998. If achieved, it would mark the first
year of growth after six years of decline.
<p>
   ``This budget is quite realistic,'' First Deputy Finance
Minister Vladimir Petrov said in a speech to lawmakers.
<p>
   Communists and their allies say heavy state subsidies are
necessary to save ailing Russian industries from total ruin and
help stimulate growth.
<p>
   ``The budget looks like that of an ill-developed country,'' said
Communist Yuri Maslyukov, who chairs the Duma's economic policy
committee.

Hungarian president sets referendum date
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  &MD;  President Arpad Goencz on Thursday set
Nov. 16 as the date for a referendum on whether Hungary should join
NATO.
<p>
   The referendum will also ask voters to decide on the right of
foreigners to purchase arable land, a hotly debated issue that has
the country divided.
<p>
   The government's position is that Hungary, which hopes to join
the European Union within the next 10 years, cannot discriminate
between domestic and foreign buyers but is prepared to protect
farmers against speculators.
<p>
   But opposition parties and nationalists outside parliament do
not like that stance.
<p>
   They have gathered over 200,000 signatures on a petition trying
to force a referendum that would ask voters to oppose foreigners
from owning any land. And they have gone to the Constitutional
Court in an attempt to have their question put onto the referendum
and to force the government to withdraw its formulation.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs has expressed concerns that the
polarization over the land issue might lead to confusion on NATO
and result in more ``no'' votes on membership than if the NATO
question stood alone.
<p>
   Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, was offered
membership earlier this year. They were the first former Soviet
bloc countries to receive such an invitation.
<p>
   A majority against NATO would hurt Hungary's efforts to join not
only the defensive alliance but indirectly also harm its hopes of
becoming a member of the European Union. Though the two
organizations are not formally linked, acceptance by NATO is
considered a crucial entry card into the European Union.
<p>
   According to a 1,200-sample national opinion poll, released
Wednesday, only 51 percent of the respondents said they would vote
in the referendum, but 72 percent of those favored NATO membership.
<p>
   No margin of error was given.

<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
seaboard Thursday with high winds and towering seas, packing 100
mph (160 kph) winds as it raced along Mexico's southwest resort
coast.
<p>
   As Pauline continued its furious trek up Mexico's resort coast
past Acapulco, President Ernesto Zedillo paused on a state visit to
Germany to order an emergency response plan for much of the
hard-hit coast.
<p>
   The government news agency Notimex said Zedillo dispatched
military and civil defense workers to southernmost Oaxaca and
Chiapas states, buffeted a day earlier by the first winds and rains
associated with Pauline.
<p>
   Reports of downed homes, roads severed by floodwaters and large
trees snapped or uprooted by the powerful Pacific hurricane
followed in its wake.
<p>
   ``It was very dramatic, something we had never seen here
before,'' said a hotel security guard, Nicanor Reyes, forced to
huddle overnight in the waterlogged Huatulco Sheraton with guests
as the storm raged past.
<p>
   He could not get home today because of severed roads and fretted
for the wife and five children he had left behind when Pauline
struck with 120 mph (193 kph) winds.
<p>
   ``I don't know what the situation is in my house. I think it's
normal to be worried,'' he said.
<p>
   Towering waves up to 30 feet (9.1-meters) tall had torn away the
beachfront of the Huatulco Sheraton and other bays. Tree limbs lay
everywhere under an overcast sky Thursday. Rain had driven into
many rooms and across the hotel lobby.
<p>
   Sheila Butler, of McAllen, Texas, said she hadn't seen a
hurricane so strong in her 78 years. ``We come from South Texas so
we've seen hurricanes before, but this was a real strong one.''
<p>
   No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. But telephone
communication to much of the coast was cut from Pauline's two-day
pummeling of the coast as it raked northwestward along the
shoreline.
<p>
   At 1500 GMT, Pauline was near Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and moving
quickly toward the west northwest near 15 mph (24 kph), the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
<p>
   The center also reported that a hurricane warning had been
rapidly extended northwestward from well below Acapulco to Puerto
Vallarta.
<p>
   Maximum sustained winds of about 100 mph (161 kph) were reported
with higher gusts over nearby mountains. Hurricane winds extended
out up to 35 miles (60 kilometers) and tropical storm force winds
outward up to 115 miles (185 kilometers), the Hurricane Center
said.
<p>
   After Pauline's passage, reports of flooding were reported in
Acapulco, a city of 2.9 million that is Mexico's most populous
Pacific resort.
<p>
   ``This is serious,'' said Amador Ramirez, a Televisa news
network correspondent describing people fleeing homes as
floodwaters coursed down streets.
<p>
   ``The streets are filling up with water. They are getting really
inundated. The water is practically washing away vehicles and
people are leaving their homes.'' Ramirez said.
<p>
   The Hurricane Center reported near-hurricane force winds raked
Acapulco before dawn Thursday as the storm moved northward up the
coast toward the beach resorts of Zihuatenejo, Manzanillo and
Puerto Vallarta.
<p>
   Overnight, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and fishing villages
near Huatulco, churning up 30-foot (9.1-meter) seas and leaving a
trail of roofless and ruined residences.
<p>
   Around Huatulco, Pauline's violent winds and rains turned
streets into rivers, ripped large trees from the ground and sent
makeshift homes of plywood flying. But nowhere did it hit as hard
as in the poor community of Las Tres Cruces, next to the Huatulco
airport.
<p>
   ``Is it gone?'' asked Pablo Avendano Lopez, one of the newly
homeless.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' replied 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo
Mayo, surveying the humble neighborhood reduced to broken glass and
debris.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American Southwest as a
tropical storm.
<p>
   Also in September, Hurricane Linda packed winds over 200 mph but
lived and died offshore. Forecasters said El Nino, in which
unusually warm Pacific waters disrupt weather patterns, could be to
blame for the high number of powerful hurricanes.

Dutch central bank raises interest rates
Eds: UPDATES with stocks on Amsterdam exchange dropping sharply on
news.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  The Dutch Central Bank lifted its
fixed advance rate, the equivalent of Germany's discount rate, to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent Thursday.
<p>
   The increase in the fixed advance rate came as a surprise. The
last time the bank changed that rate was March 10, when it was
lifted to 2.5 percent from 2 percent.
<p>
   The move came after the Deutsche Bundesbank increased its
securities repurchase rate to 3.3 percent from 3 percent to preempt
higher inflation and help dampen growth in the money supply.
<p>
   The Dutch Central Bank said the decision to increase the fixed
advance rate was taken after considering the developments of the
domestic economy.
<p>
   ``It was a necessary move because the Dutch monetary policy
wasn't in tune with the economy,'' said Kees Rijswijk, an analyst
with SNS Securities, referring to relatively high consumer and
producer prices.
<p>
   Inflation figures for September will be released Friday and are
expected to be around 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent. The Dutch
inflation level in August  &MD;  2.6 percent  &MD;  was the highest in the
European Union except for Greece.
<p>
   Share prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange took a nose dive
Thursday afternoon, following the European-wide rise in interest
rates and the decline in the dollar.
<p>
   The 25-share AEX index plunged 3.1 percent, or 28.95 points, to
916.14.

Artist detained after exhibiting statue with human leg

<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An artist who hoped to win a prize with an
unusual statue that incorporated human and animal bones wound up
instead in police custody charged with desecration of the dead.
<p>
   Problems for 30-year-old artist Ahmed Desouki Korali began when
his composite figure went on display earlier this week at the Ninth
Exhibition for Young Artists in Cairo.
<p>
   The statue  &MD;  which included a human leg, a cat's scull and a
sheep's spine  &MD;  had a covering of transparent polyester to create a
figure similar to an ancient Egyptian sculpture of a man.
<p>
   Viewers became alarmed looking at the statue, and judges at the
exhibition called police, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported Thursday.
Korali was detained and later released on 500 Egyptian pounds (dlrs
147) bail.
<p>
   An undertaker, identified only by the first name Samir, also was
detained for acquiring the human leg for the work, apparently from
the Khanka cemetery in central Cairo, the paper said.
<p>
   Korali told The Associated Press that he was unaware he was
breaking the law.
<p>
   ``I didn't realize that using human parts is against the law,''
he said in a phone interview. ``I was just so caught up in the
excitement of the idea of the statue.''
<p>
   He said he had asked the undertaker for a leg bone, but got an
entire leg. He sculpted an arm bone for the statue himself.
<p>
   ``Beauty is in the surprise,'' he said.
<p>
   Art critic Fatma Ismail said she felt the statue was in poor
taste.
<p>
   ``Desecrating the dead is a common and accepted theme in film
and literature, but for a virtual artist it turns into a crime when
he incorporates the tangible with the thought,'' she told The AP.
<p>
   The statue has been taken for examination by Egyptian forensic
officials.
<p>
   Tampering with the dead is against the law in Egypt. Islam and
Christianity, the two main religions in Egypt, also call for
respecting the dead.
<p>
   Two years ago, Korali won first prize in sculpture at the
Exhibition for Young Artists.

Nobilo ousts Mickelson; Woosnam, Faxon, Singh in quarterfinals
Eds: UPDATES throughout with final results after 36 holes of
first-round play
By STEPHEN WADE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP)  &MD;  American Ryder Cup player Brad
Faxon and New Zealand's Frank Nobilo Thursday reached the
quarterfinals of the World Match Play Championship in first-round
play that also saw European Ryder player Ian Woosnam and Vijay
Singh of Fiji advance.
<p>
   Nobilo will face Nick Price in Friday's 36-hole quarterfinals
with Faxon taking on Colin Montgomerie, Woosnam playing three-time
defending champion Ernie Els, and Singh playing Steve Elkington of
Australia. Els, seeded No. 1, has never lost in nine matches here.
<p>
   Nobilo defeated American Phil Mickelson on the second playoff
hole after they were even through 36. Faxon beat Darren Clarke 2
and 1, Woosnam won over Jesper Parnevik 4 and 3, and Singh defeated
Tsukasa Watanabe 4 and 3.
<p>
   Mickelson, 1 up with one hole to play, hit his drive into a
fairway bunker. After Nobilo made birdie on the par-5 hole, the
American missed a 12-foot (4 meter) putt that lipped out to halve
the hole and win the match.
<p>
   Nobilo won on the 38th hole when he hit a 7 iron to a foot (30
cm) as Mickelson took par on the 155-yard (140-meter hole).
<p>
   Mickelson also lost here last year in the first round  &MD;  also on
the final hole.
<p>
   ``It was a classic match, a real tussle,'' Nobilo said. ``On the
17th when I hit it out of bounds I thought it was over. But on the
18th, Phil hit that fairway bunker and I was given a chance.''
<p>
   Woosnam closed out Ryder Cup teammate Parnevik 4 and 3 with a
3-foot (1 meter) putt on the 33rd to halve the hole.
<p>
   Woosnam was 1 up after the first 18. Parnevik, who was
hospitalized in Stockholm last week with a stomach virus and then
released himself and claimed he was ``almost back to normal''  &MD; 
probably wasn't on his game.
<p>
   He squared the match with a birdie on the 21st hole and a
eagle-3 on the 22nd with an 11-foot (3 meter) putt, but then
Woosnam charged and picked up three holes with a birdie on the
24th, a Parnevik bogey on the 25th and a birdie on the 26th. He
went 4 up on the 30th with a birdie four.
<p>
   Woosnam, plagued recently by horrible driving, played with a new
driver Thursday after experimenting ``with 14 last week.'' The new
American-made model, sold under the brand name ``Tegra,'' is a
``more center-shafted model to help amateurs draw the ball,''
Woosnam explained.
<p>
   ``Maybe this is the one that will do it for me,'' he said. ``If
I can get it in the fairway, I can usually do all right.''
<p>
   When one reporter termed it a ``Tegra Woods'' because of the
extra 40 yards (meters) off the tee, Woosnam just rolled his eyes.
``No, nowhere near.''
<p>
   Woosnam faces Els, the three-time champion in Friday's
quarterfinals. Els is unbeaten in nine matches in this event.
<p>
   Faxon was 1 up after the first 18 and took a three-hole lead
when Clarke took a bogey on the 19th and Faxon dropped a 4-foot (1
meter) birdie putt after sticking a 7 iron close on the 155-yard
(140 meter) hole.
<p>
   Clarke twice got back to two holes down but could never get any
closer.
<p>
   ``Brad holed the putts he had to,'' Clarke said. ``I made a few
stupid mistakes on some short putts I missed.''
<p>
   The Singh-Watanabe match was never really close. Singh, the
runner-up last year to Els, was 3 up after the first 18 and went 4
up with Watanabe bogeyed the 21st and 5 up with Singh eagled the
par-5 22nd hole.

Dutch central bank raises interest rates
Eds: UPDATES with stocks on Amsterdam exchange dropping sharply on
news.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  The Dutch Central Bank lifted its
fixed advance rate, the equivalent of Germany's discount rate, to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent Thursday.
<p>
   The increase in the fixed advance rate came as a surprise. The
last time the bank changed that rate was March 10, when it was
lifted to 2.5 percent from 2 percent.
<p>
   The move came after the Deutsche Bundesbank increased its
securities repurchase rate to 3.3 percent from 3 percent to preempt
higher inflation and help dampen growth in the money supply.
<p>
   The Dutch Central Bank said the decision to increase the fixed
advance rate was taken after considering the developments of the
domestic economy.
<p>
   ``It was a necessary move because the Dutch monetary policy
wasn't in tune with the economy,'' said Kees Rijswijk, an analyst
with SNS Securities, referring to relatively high consumer and
producer prices.
<p>
   Inflation figures for September will be released Friday and are
expected to be around 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent. The Dutch
inflation level in August  &MD;  2.6 percent  &MD;  was the highest in the
European Union except for Greece.
<p>
   Share prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange took a nosedive
Thursday afternoon, following the European-wide rise in interest
rates and the decline in the dollar.
<p>
   The 25-share AEX index plunged 3.1 percent, or 28.95 points, to
916.14.

Kuwait lends Syria $65 million to expand its phone system
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP)  &MD;  Kuwait is to lend Syria dlrs 65 million
for the expansion of its telephone system, the official Syrian Arab
News Agency reported Thursday.
<p>
   The loan will go toward a 340 million Syrian pound (dlrs 770
million) project that aims to install 1.65 million telephone lines
across Syria, with 467 digital exchanges.
<p>
   The loan of dlrs 65 million comes from the government-run
Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development, which has underwritten
several projects in Syria since Syrian forces took part in the
U.S.-led military campaign that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi troops
in 1991.
<p>
   The loan agreement was signed here Thursday by the Syrian
minister of state for planning, Abdul-Rahim Subeii, and the
chairman of the Kuwaiti Fund, Bader Mushara al-Humeidhi, SANA said.

   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded the Pacific
seaboard Thursday with high winds and towering seas, packing 100
mph (160 kph) winds as it raced along Mexico's southwest resort
coast.
<p>
   As Pauline continued its furious trek for hundreds of miles
(kilometers) up Mexico's resort coast past Acapulco, President
Ernesto Zedillo paused on a state visit to Germany to order an
emergency response plan for much of the hard-hit coast.
<p>
   The government news agency Notimex said Zedillo dispatched
military and civil defense workers to southernmost Oaxaca and
Chiapas states, buffeted a day earlier by the first winds and rains
associated with Pauline.
<p>
   Reports of downed homes, roads severed by floodwaters and large
trees snapped or uprooted by the powerful Pacific hurricane
followed in its wake.
<p>
   In Acapulco, Mexico's most populous resort with 2.9 million
residents, torrential rains turned many downtown streets into
fast-churning rivers of mud, water and debris. TV footage showed
dozens cars stalled or swept to the sides of roads as people
crossed the knee-deep floodwaters on ropes thrown across
intersections.
<p>
   Other scenes of Pauline's fury played out all along the coast.

Argentine dirty war survivors flood Spanish radio show with calls
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  A former Argentine naval offficer's
admission in a Spanish court to hurling dissidents to their deaths
from airplanes during his country's dirty war has uncorked a flood
of emotions.
<p>
   By the thousands, Argentine emigres and Spaniards who had lived
in Argentina during the mass killings called a national radio talk
show on Thursday to remember, and to shed tears.
<p>
   Adolfo Scilingo's testimony about the 1976-1983 dirty war  &MD;  in
which at least 9,000 suspected leftist dissidents were arrested,
tortured, and then never seen again  &MD;  marked the first time a
member of Argentina's security forces who participated in the
repression has provided details in any court about the killings.
<p>
   No such probe has been held in Argentina. In 1990, Argentine
President Carlos Menem pardoned middle and senior-ranking officers
of any culpability from the dirty war.
<p>
   Scilingo is testifying in Spain because Spanish Judge Baltazar
Garzon is investigating the disappearances of 600 Spaniards during
the dirty war.
<p>
   Garzon's year-old probe is backed by Spanish law which allows
the prosecution of genocide no matter where it is committed and
regardless of the nationality of those accused.
<p>
   Many Argentines  &MD;  the number is not clear  &MD;  fled to Spain and
other countries during the repression.
<p>
   The number of callers to the morning talk show shows the wounds
have not healed.
<p>
   The panelists had been discussing Scilingo's testimony, which
began Tuesday and was to continue Thursday afternoon, when the
switchboard began lighting up.
<p>
   A former teacher in Argentina remembered all the students and
parents who had disappeared in the dirty war.
<p>
   ``Ask Scilingo,'' she said, her voice trembling with emotion,
``if he threw those people into the sea.''
<p>
   One 42-year-old man, who identified himself only as Jose,
recalled the many students he had known in Argentina who were among
the missing. He broke down crying and was unable to continue.
<p>
   ``I'm sorry. There's so many things ... that only so few people
know about,'' he said.
<p>
   Sounding a contrasting note, one caller who identified himself
as Emilio said he remembered how his security company in Buenos
Aires received many orders for security alarms from military
personnel who were afraid Montonero leftist rebels would invade
their homes and massacre their families.
<p>
   ``Let it not be forgotten there were thousand of killings by the
Montoneros,'' said the caller. ``Every effect has its cause.''
<p>
   Ana Ramos, who works for the radio show, said it was besieged by
callers.
<p>
   ``The entire radio station's telephone system was blocked for
over an hour,'' she said.
<p>
   Scilingo, who came voluntarily to Spain to testify, was arrested
Tuesday after he admitted hurling suspected dissidents to their
deaths from airplanes flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Judge
Baltazar Garzon reportedly ordered the arrest to assure Scilingo's
continued appearance in his courtroom.
<p>
   Garzon has also ordered the arrest of a former military leader
of Argentina, but Menem's government has refused to hand over key
Argentine military personnel or help in any way with the probe.
<p>
   Under Spanish law, Garzon has until Friday after which he must
seek an extension order on Scilingo's arrest, file charges or free
him.

<TEXT>
<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Launching major changes in
France's Africa policies, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on
Thursday called South Africa the focus of its new direction.
<p>
   Despite a diplomatic flap between the two countries earlier this
year, Vedrine said South Africa was a key ally on the continent and
in the rest of the world
<p>
   ``We look upon South Africa as an essential partner in Africa
and elsewhere,'' he told the Parliament foreign affairs committee.
<p>
   Vedrine said France did not consider African nations as ``pawns
in the big chess games of diplomacy, but as fully fledged
partners.''
<p>
   He added that future defense agreements in Africa would
concentrate on training, especially peace-keeping, a shift from
France's previous role as an interventionist and protector.
<p>
   Vedrine and South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
signed agreements strengthening ties between the two countries,
including a memorandum to ensure South Africa and France conduct
regular, close political talks on diplomatic issues.
<p>
   Until the 1960s, France controlled about a third of the African
continent. After decolonization, its military and political
presence dictated the balance of power in many nations.
<p>
   But the recent behavior of some of its African allies has been a
source of embarrassment.
<p>
   In May, anti-government rebels swept the former Zaire and forced
longtime French ally President Mobutu Sese Seko to flee.
<p>
   France was the only nation to back Mobutu, who has since died in
exile, to the very end. South Africa, which cooperated with the
United States in developing policies sympathetic to rebel leader
Laurent Kabila, criticized the French for its stance; French
officials complained of burgeoning U.S. influence on the continent.
<p>
   Also in May, French influence in the Republic of Congo was not
enough to prevent fighting prompted in part by the distribution of
oil revenues harvested by French companies.
<p>
   France has traditionally been most active in her former African
colonies in West Africa. But post-apartheid South Africa, the
dominant nation of southern Africa, would provide a powerful and
useful ally for France under its revised strategy.
<p>
   ``The future of that relationship is not only consolidated, but
improves all the time,'' Nzo said Thursday.
<p>
   The one-day visit is part of Vedrine's first official trip to
Africa since France elected a socialist government in June.
<p>
   He also plans stops in Ethiopia, Gabon and Ivory Coast, where he
will brief other governments on the new policy.
<p>
   Instead of direct political and military interference in its
former colonies, France says it will focus on economic ties and
development across the whole of Africa and encourage multilateral
solutions to African problems.
<p>
   The policy change was announced in August by President Jacques
Chirac. About the same time, the French government announced plans
to cut its troops in Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and shut one of its
six military bases on the continent.
<p>
   Nzo and Vedrine also signed an agreement pledging 17 million
French francs (dlrs 2.9 million) for South Africa's education
system.

Israel awaiting U.S. documents in teenager's extradition case
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  The Justice Ministry said Thursday that it
awaited more documents from the United States before a decision is
made on the requested extradition of a Maryland teen-ager charged
in a grisly killing.
<p>
   Samuel Sheinbein, 17, has been charged in Maryland in the
slaying of Alfredo Enrique Tello, 19, whose burned and dismembered
body was found Sept. 18 in a suburb of Washington.
<p>
   Sheinbein, of Wheaton, Maryland, flew to Israel days after
Tello's body was discovered and wound up in a psychiatric ward
after a drug overdose. He was arrested after a request from U.S.
authorities and ordered held for an initial 10 days.
<p>
   Israel has to date refused to extradite him because of the
possibility that the youth has Israeli citizenship passed on to him
by his Israeli father, who moved to the United States in the 1950s.
<p>
   A team of Maryland legal and police officials visited Israel
last week, and Israel requested more documents that will help
determine the validity of Sheinbein's Israeli citizenship claim.
<p>
   On Thursday, the Justice Ministry issued a statement reiterating
that ``the authorities in Israel are currently awaiting the
additional documents before rendering a decision on this issue.''
<p>
   The statement noted that under Israeli law, ``a person born
outside Israel automatically becomes an Israeli citizen from birth
when at least one of the parents is an Israeli citizen.''
<p>
   On Wednesday, an Israeli court ordered Sheinbein held for 10
more days. He was represented by former Justice Minister David
Libai, one of the country's most respected jurists, who said his
client did not want to be extradited.
<p>
   The case has strained Israeli-U.S. relations, and U.S. lawmakers
this week floated proposals to cut as much as one-third of Israel's
dlrs 3 billion in annual U.S. aid if Sheinbein is not returned to
Maryland for trial.

Douillet wins gold mdal as judo starts
By SALVATORE ZANCA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP) - France's Olympic champion David Douillet won his
third consecutive heavyweight World Judo title Thursday and fourth
overall to make a successful comeback following a severe motorcycle
accident last year.
<p>
   He took a decision in the more than 95-kilogram category when
his opponent, Japan's Shinishi Shinohara, was disqualified for his
fourth stalling penalty. Douillet was leading on points at the time
with 50 seconds to go in the bout.
<p>
   ``This victory was exceptional for me. I thought of my children
who I neglected as well as my struggle after my accident,''
Douillet said. ``To win this title was a personal satisfaction.''
<p>
   The great Yasuhiro Yamashita was the only other person to win
three heavyweight titles in a row and also had an open win in 1981
for four titles.
<p>
   Douillet, who won the open title in 1995, still has a chance for
a fifth title in the open category on Sunday. However he has a sore
shoulder and wrist and may not compete in it.
<p>
   He said he will make a decision Friday.
<p>
   Pavel Nastula of Poland won the 95-kilo class as he did at the
Olympics. He has not been beaten in three years, also winning the
1995 world title.
<p>
   He beat Brazil's Aurelio Miguel in the final, scoring a close
judges' decision.
<p>
   In the women's more than 72-kilo division France's Christine
Cicot scored a takedown with less than a minute left to beat
Japan's Miho Ninomiya.
<p>
   Cicot was an Olympic bronze medalist and took over the
favorite's role when China's Olympic champion Sun Fuming lost in
the semfinals.
<p>
   The women's 72-kilo was won by Japan's Noriko Anno over Cuba's
Diadenis Luna
<p>
   Douillet had a motorcyle accident 12 months ago -- less than two
months after winning in Atlanta -- and only recently returned to
full combat. But he won the Mediterranean Games title to show he is
back in shape and beat the current European champion in the
semifinals here.
<p>
   He won in 1993 and 1995 at the more than 95-kilo category and
had a double two years ago when he won the open category, the first
non-Japanese man to capture both titles in the same year.
<p>
   More than 100 countries will compete in Paris for four days with
two men's and two women's weight divisions each day.
<p>
   The categories are the same as in the Olympics with the addition
of the open events in both men and women's competition.
<p>
   France took home three gold medals at the last Olympics. Its
gold total equalled Japan and was better than South Korea.

Rights group blames Rwandans, Kabila's forces for Congo massacres
Eds: RECAPS with quotes from U.N. spokesman
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  A report alleging that the Rwandan army
and Laurent Kabila's forces carried out most of the massacres of
civilians in eastern Congo underscores the urgency of a U.N.
investigation into the charges, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the next step is for the United
States to send an envoy to Congo and Rwanda to urge leaders there
to allow the United Nations to carry out an unimpeded investigation
in the Congo.
<p>
   Last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalled four leaders of
a U.N. investigation team from the Congo after differences with the
government stalled the probe. Kabila said any massacres were
carried out by troops loyal to the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,
who was ousted last May.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch/Africa said Kabila's side bore most of
the responsibility for the slaughter. In a report Wednesday, the
group claimed abuses committed by Kabila's forces and the
Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army ``are remarkably different in their
scale, nature and motivation'' from those carried out by Mobutu's
troops and his Rwandan militiamen allies.
<p>
   ``These killings and the intentional blocking of aid were
apparently both in revenge for the 1994 genocide (in Rwanda)''  &MD; 
and to weaken Hutu militiamen who were fighting alongside Mobutu's
soldiers, the report said.
<p>
   The report did concede, however, that Mobutu's allies also
committed murders, rapes and other abuses during the seven-month
war.
<p>
   ``I think it merely is one more report indicating that there is
a problem there that needs to be documented,'' Eckhard told
reporters. ``It underlines the importance of a United Nations
mission getting underway, and we continue to be hopeful it will
happen.''
<p>
   Eckhard said the United Nations hoped a special American envoy,
who has not been publicly named, would be able to break the
impasse.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch also claimed the United States bore some
responsibility for the massacres because Washington knew in advance
that Rwanda planned to intervene in the Congo.
<p>
   After Hutu extremists butchered an estimated half million
Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994, a Tutsi-dominated rebel
army overthrew Rwanda's Hutu government.
<p>
   That sent more than 1 million Rwandan Hutus  &MD;  including armed
militiamen responsible for the genocide  &MD;  streaming into
U.N.-supervised refugee camps in eastern Congo, then known as
Zaire.
<p>
   But the United Nations was powerless to stop armed raids into
Rwanda by Hutus sheltering in the camps. That promoted Rwanda to
intervene.
<p>
   The report said the Pentagon signed off as early as August 1995
on Rwanda's plans to clear out the refugee camps in eastern Congo
``provided it was a `clean' operation, meaning one with limited
civilian casualties.''
<p>
   In August 1996, Rwandan Defense Minister Paul Kagame told the
Americans that Rwanda was ready to dismantle the camps if no one
else acted, the report said.
<p>
   The report also alleged that the Rwandan army systematically
separated young men, former Rwandan Hutu government officials and
Hutu intellectuals from among refugees and executed them.
<p>
   ``Authorities in Congo have made concerted efforts to conceal
the evidence of civilian killing ... largely through the physical
cleanup of massacre sites and by the intimidation of witnesses,''
the report said.
<p>
   It also said killings appear to be continuing, especially in
eastern Congo's North Kivu province.
<p>
   ``Many of the killings in recent months have been related to
unresolved issues of land rights, customary power and political
leadership,'' the report said. ``Many returning Tutsis have been
attacked by what they describe as a mix'' of Rwandan Hutu
militiamen and tribal minorities.

Most of Tanzania to go without power 5 days a week
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP)  &MD;  Most of the East African nation
of Tanzania will go without power 18 hours a day, five days a week
until enough rain falls to fill a vital reservoir.
<p>
   The blackout will affect residents in most urban areas, and is
expected to greatly hamper small manufacturers. Those companies
will have to buy their generators and diesel fuel.
<p>
   Power will remain on at major government offices, banks,
embassies and tourist hotels in the country of 30 million people,
according to Wednesday's order by the state-owned Tanzania Electric
Supply Co., which relies heavily on hydroelectric power.
<p>
   Water levels in the system's Mtera reservoir  &MD;  which were
bolstered by heavy rain from mid-March to mid-May  &MD;  are now mostly
depleted.
<p>
   Industrialists accuse the government of dragging its feet on
plans to link Tanzania's electricity supply grid to that of
neighboring countries, like Uganda, which have surpluses.

UN says Sassou-Nguesso signs ceasefire
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  A mutinous general signed a U.N.-brokered
cease-fire agreement Thursday in the Republic of the Congo, the
United Nations announced.
<p>
   Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso signed a truce negotiated last month
in Libreville, Gabon by Gabonese President Omar Bongo and special
U.N. mediator, Mohamed Sahnoun.
<p>
   Sassou-Nguesso's rival, President Pascal Lissouba, had already
signed the agreement.
<p>
   The Security Council has refused to approve a U.N. or
U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force for the troubled country until
both sides accepted a workable cease-fire.
<p>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan welcomed ``this positive
development'' and called on the international community to ``help
consolidate this cease-fire.''
<p>
   U.N. officials said they were unable to say whether this latest
truce was any more effective than the last, which broke down in
renewed factional fighting.
<p>
   Hundreds of civilians have died in the Congolese capital
Brazzaville since forces loyal to Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso went
to war June 5, a month before they were to have faced each other in
presidential elections.
<p>
   Sassou-Nguesso accused Lissouba of provoking the violence so he
would have an excuse to delay the election and hold onto power.

Interior minister hopes to solve Crimea killings
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Ukraine's leading lawman flew to the
chaotic Crimean Peninsula on Thursday in hopes of solving a recent
string of killings in the semi-autonomous region.
<p>
   Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko arrived on the Black Sea
peninsula at the head of a team of ``experienced specialists'' from
the ministry, the Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   The visit came shortly after Valery Kuzin, the director of a
state-run heating company, was found dead in the Crimean capital
Simferopol. The night before, four men were killed in a shootout at
a filling station.
<p>
   Kravchenko said police have identified several suspects in the
gas station gunfight, and that ``the only problem now is to detain
them,'' Interfax reported.
<p>
   He said solving the apparent contract killing last month of a
top tourism official on the resort-studded peninsula would be more
difficult, as it is ``linked with financial operations, and illegal
ones at that.''
<p>
   Last May, the Crimean state property privatization chief was
shot dead, also in what police said was a contract murder. None of
the crimes have been solved.

European presidents and PMs grapple with human rights, stability
Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 3, Yeltsin not seeking re-election,
10-12 US withdrawing Croatia demand, offering dlrs 1 million for
human rights commission
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Presidents and prime ministers from 40
European nations are grappling with a new Europe, trying to come to
terms with issues such as human rights and stability in the
continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit beginning Friday, with new
members such as Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, wants to reassert the
organization's basic values of promoting democracy, human rights,
human dignity and the rule of law at a time when those ideals
remain fragile in a number of countries.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who announced Thursday he would
not seek a third term, says he wants to convince fellow leaders to
try to lessen Washington's influence on the continent.
<p>
   ``We do not want the United States to be involved in Europe the
way it is now,'' Yeltsin said recently. ``We want a multipolar
world in which no country tells the others what to do.''
<p>
   Though this is the official Russian line, the reality is Moscow
remains preoccupied with domestic problems and foreign policy
clearly is a secondary concern. It has accepted the inevitability
of NATO's enlargement, and after an initial burst of opposition,
rarely is a word heard on the subject these days.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Moscow's full integration into democratic
Europe.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, But
that doesn't mean it won't try to exert its influence.
<p>
   Last month Washington circulated an unofficial paper criticizing
Croatia's failure to ensure press freedom and civil liberties. It
proposed suspending Croatia from the Council until it improves its
human rights record.
<p>
   The Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   John Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
democracy and human rights who is heading the American observer
team at the summit, said the United States had backed off its
proposal on Croatia ``at this moment.''
<p>
   That came after 10 suspected Croatian war criminals surrendered
to authorities. ``At the time our paper was presented there had
been very limited cooperation,'' Shattuck said. ``Now, we see
more.''
<p>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a letter to President Jacques
Chirac of France, host of the summit, declared Washington would
contribute dlrs 1 million toward the operation of the Bosnian human
rights commission, administered by the Council of Europe.

Environmental organizations say Aegean Sea fish dwindling
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  Fish stocks in the Aegean Sea are
dwindling because of overfishing and a lack of government
regulations, two environmental organizations said Thursday.
<p>
   Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature criticized the
government for making half-hearted efforts to solve the problem,
saying that although some measures exist, they are often inadequate
and poorly implemented.
<p>
   ``If we describe the situation of fisheries in Greece, we have
one word: chaos,'' said Nikos Haralambidis, spokesman for
Greenpeace's branch in Greece.
<p>
   Depleted fish reserves in the Aegean and the lack of binding
regulations reflect the situation in the wider Mediterranean
region, Greenpeace and the WWF said.
<p>
   The region holds one of the two most important breeding grounds
for tuna in the world, and provides 70 percent of the international
catch, the WWF said. The other breeding ground is the Gulf of
Mexico.
<p>
   But the population of adult tunas has fallen by 83 percent over
the last 20 years, and 40 percent of tuna catches consist of
juveniles, said Dimitris Karavellas of the WWF.
<p>
   While international agreements ban the fishing of tunas smaller
than six kilograms (13 pounds), the accord ``lacks teeth and
legally binding terms,'' Karavellas said.
<p>
   An agreement by the General Fisheries Council for the
Mediterranean, GFCM, and the International Committee for the Care
of Atlantic Tuna, contains an opting out procedure under which any
country may ignore the agreement at will, he added.
<p>
   During a GFCM conference in Rome on Monday, the WWF and
Greenpeace will present a series of ``principles and measures which
must be adopted and implemented'' in order to safeguard the
Mediterranean Sea's fish reserves and ecosystems.
<p>
   The council's policy for the protection of regional fish stocks
is expected to be discussed at the meeting.
<p>
   Haralambidis claimed Greece's indifference was evident in its
failure to send a member of the fisheries department or the
Agriculture Ministry to attend the GFCM meeting.
<p>
   The agriculture minister's office and of a series of fisheries
officials contacted at the department were unaware the conference
was taking place.
<p>
   Greek national waters, which are poorly regulated, contain many
spawning and nurturing grounds, the organizations claimed.
<p>
   Haralambidis also criticized Greece for allowing its fishing
fleet to operate in international waters, saying it serves ``only
to export the problem.''
<p>
   No regulations exist outside Greece's six-mile territorial
waters, Haralambidis said. Because they are unregulated, no
controls can realistically be enforced on the size of catches and
what methods are used to harvest the fish.

Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 3, Yeltsin not seeking re-election,
10-13 US withdrawing Croatia demand, offering dlrs 1 million for
human rights commission
European presidents and PMs grapple with human rights, stability
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Presidents and prime ministers from 40
European nations grapple with a new Europe Friday, trying to come
to terms with issues such as human rights and stability in the
continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit, with new members such as
Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, wants to reassert the organization's
basic values of promoting democracy, human rights, human dignity
and the rule of law at a time when those ideals remain fragile in a
number of countries.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who announced Thursday he would
not seek a third term, says he wants to convince fellow leaders to
try to lessen Washington's influence on the continent.
<p>
   ``We do not want the United States to be involved in Europe the
way it is now,'' he said recently. ``We want a multipolar world in
which no country tells the others what to do.''
<p>
   Though this is the official Russian line, the reality is Moscow
remains preoccupied with domestic problems and foreign policy
clearly is a secondary concern. It has accepted the inevitability
of NATO's enlargement, and after an initial burst of opposition,
rarely is a word heard on the subject.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Moscow's full integration into democratic
Europe.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe, But
that doesn't mean it won't try to exert its influence.
<p>
   Last month Washington circulated an unofficial paper criticizing
Croatia's failure to ensure press freedom and civil liberties. It
proposed suspending Croatia from the Council until it improves its
human rights record.
<p>
   The Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   John Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
democracy and human rights who is heading the American observer
team at the summit, said the United States had backed off its
proposal on Croatia. That decision, he said, came after 10
suspected Croatian war criminals surrendered to authorities.
<p>
   Shattuck said the United States was not ``at this moment''
seeking the suspension of Croatia from the Council of Europe.
<p>
   ``At the time our paper was presented there had been very
limited cooperation,'' he said. ``Now, we see more.''
<p>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a letter to President Jacques
Chirac of France, host of the summit, declared Washington would
contribute dlrs 1 million toward the operation of the Bosnian human
rights commission, administered by the Council of Europe.
<p>
   Major aims of the summit will be to create a single, permanent
European Court of Human Rights by 1998, available to more than 800
million Europeans; to take action against corruption, money
laundering and organized crime; to ban cloning of human beings; and
to fight racism and intolerance.
<p>
   ``We expect it to be a manifestation of European Unity,'' said
Daniel Tarschys, the Council's secretary-general. At a time when
the European Union and NATO are enlarging, some countries are being
left out. The Council, he said, ``tries to work for a Europe where
everyone feels included.
<p>
   The existing system for implementing the European Human Rights
Convention is a two-tiered setup that first involves a European
Human Rights Commission that decides if a case is admissible, then
tries to settle it through friendly negotiations. Failing that, it
goes to the Court of Human rights.
<p>
   That was fine with a dozen member states, but has become
unwieldy with 40, often taking five years or more to deal with a
case. The Council wants to streamline that, making the process more
efficient and accessible.
<p>
   Another proposal would set up a corruption-prevention body as a
focal point for cooperation on corruption, organized crime and
money laundering.
<p>
   The Council of Europe, created in 1949 and with a current budget
of 153 million European currency units (dlrs 171 million), has a
reputation as something of a talk shop lacking real political
punch, a framer of ringing declarations backed by little
discernible action.
<p>
   Asked how Europe would be a better place after the summit,
Tarschys said even if the people of Europe ``don't wake up the next
morning flabbergasted by what we've done,'' it would serve as an
impetus for action.
<p>
   ``The ringing declaration at the end will be a signal to us to
get to work,'' he said.

Italy's latest Nobel laureate tackled all with biting, raunchy
humor
With BC-Sweden-Nobel-Literature

<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  The Communists weren't leftist enough. Italy's
theaters were too confining -- tents, town squares and occupied
factories better fit his radical sense.
<p>
   Anything was fair game for playwright-actor Dario Fo's scathing
satire and raunchy humor -- politics, religion, feminism and
impotence were food for caustic thought for Fo and his
wife/artistic partner Franca Rame.
<p>
   He even joked about how he heard Thursday he won the
literature's top prize -- Fo told a reporter a fellow motorist on
the highway to Milan held up a sign saying, ``Dario has won the
Nobel.''
<p>
   The United States once denied him a visa under a McCarthy-era
law because of his left-wing politics. He was a member of the
Italian Communist Party briefly until he broke with it in the 1970s
as the party bid for establishment power.
<p>
   Prosecutors failed to convict him in 1976 for allegedly
offending institutions like the national police force.
<p>
   Italian bishops gagged on his free-wheeling interpretations of
the Catholic faith. One of his most famous plays, ``Mistero Buffo''
(Comic Mystery), contained his version of New Testament passages,
like the marriage feast at Cana. The gospel according to Fo depicts
Jesus turning water into wine to do his mother, Mary, a favor.
<p>
   An estimated 1 million people saw ``Mistero Buffo'' when the
one-man show toured Italy over 18 months in 1968-1970.
<p>
   After so many years of Fo's attacking institutions, some found
it hard to believe that the author known as ``the jester'' won such
an establishment honor as the Nobel.
<p>
   ``Nobody was expecting this one,'' said literary critic Carlo
Bo.
<p>
   ``What does this mean?'' the 86-year-old Bo said. ``It means
that everything changes, that even literature changes. I'm too old
to figure this out.''
<p>
   Even Fo said he was ``amazed'' by the news, and the Vatican's
official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, used the same adjective
to describe its outrage.
<p>
   ``This Nobel is also Franca's,'' Fo said of the woman he married
in 1954 and his favorite interpreter of his monologue plays, many
of them written expressly for her.
<p>
   Rame said the 71-year-old Fo deserved the honor. ``It will pay
him back for the many, many humiliations he suffered in his life
and along his cultural journey.''
<p>
   ``I believe that today many critics, when they hear this news,
will have a heart attack,'' Rame said.
<p>
   Leftist sympathizers in the arts were thrilled.
<p>
   Lina Sastri, a Neapolitan singer and actress, said the Nobel
award recognized ``the political function of art'' and signaled
``hope that something was changing in the system of power in the
cultural world.''
<p>
   Fo satirized major landmarks in post-war Italian society: the
``historic compromise'' -- an effort to have Communists support
Christian-Democrat-dominated policies during the years of domestic
terrorism in the late 1970s; bitter debates over abortion and
divorce; and ``Tangentopoli'' or Kickback City, the political
corruption scandal at the start of this decade that brought down a
whole class of politicians and businessmen.
<p>
   The son of a railway worker father and a farm hand mother, Fo
studied painting at Milan's prestigious Brera Academy as well as
architecture.
<p>
   The Fo-Rame team were out of favor at RAI state TV for more than
a decade after they quit in 1962 to protest censorship of a sketch
of construction workers during delicate union negotiations.
<p>
   Fo's work grew more and more radical.
<p>
   Dealing with subjects like the Vietnam War, the Maoist
revolution and student revolts in the West, the couple took their
works out of ``bourgeois'' theaters and into the streets, piazzas,
occupied factories, circus-style tents. During his shows,
collection hats were passed for `political prisoners.''
<p>
   In 1973, a group of Italian neofascists kidnapped and raped
Rame. The next year, the couple occupied a theater in Milan which
they had painted with revolutionary-theme murals.
<p>
   By the end of the '70s, Fo's stature as an artist began to
outstrip his fame as a militant. Milan's La Scala theater let him
direct a play, ``Story of a Soldier,'' in 1978, and mainstream
theaters began to compete to showcase his works to audiences in
furs, jewels and suits.

   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  British Airways must have hoped the last shot had
been fired at its new tail designs  &MD;  but ex-prime minister Margaret
Thatcher on Thursday raised her still-influential voice against the
removal of the Union Jack logos.
<p>
   ``We fly the British flag, not these awful things you are
putting on tails,'' Lady Thatcher told the British Airways workers
who happened to be on duty at a corporate booth set up for the
annual conference of the opposition Conservative Party.
<p>
   In case anyone possibly could have missed her point, Lady
Thatcher pulled out a handkerchief and wrapped it around a model
British Airways jet to cover up the colorful new logo.
<p>
   Lady Thatcher glowered at British Airways executives who
responded with embarrassed laughter, then she walked off.
<p>
   British Airways later characterized the exchange as ``a
light-hearted discussion with her about our new identity, which we
enjoyed.''

Swiss fund to start paying Holocaust survivors by late November
By BALZ BRUPPACHER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  A fund set up by Swiss banks to aid
some Holocaust survivors will be able to make its first payments by
late November, officials said Thursday.
<p>
   The 270 million Swiss franc (dlrs 190 million) fund aims to help
Holocaust survivors who then suffered under decades of communist
rule in Eastern Europe.
<p>
   The top officials of the fund, Swiss Jewish leader Rolf Bloch
and former Red Cross official Marco Sassoli, cleared procedures
with representatives of the World Jewish Restitution Organization
during a meeting in New York this week, the officials said.
<p>
   The organization will begin to create formal applications from
the 28,000 names of Jews in Eastern Europe presented to Swiss
authorities last month in Budapest, Hungary, and New York.
<p>
   ``Once such a formal application is submitted, the members of
the fund executive ... should be rapidly able to decide on it,''
said the officials. ``The first payments from the funds which are
ready to benefit needy Jewish Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe
should begin within six weeks.''
<p>
   The money was provided as a goodwill gesture by Swiss banks and
industry. Slower efforts continue to help heirs recover the assets
deposited in Switzerland by their relatives who perished at the
hands of the Nazis.
<p>
   The three largest Swiss banks started the fund last winter, but
destitute victims have yet to see anything because of wrangling
between international Jewish leaders and the Swiss.
<p>
   The money also is for other victims of the Nazis, such as
gypsies and homosexuals, but officials have said those payments
will take longer because they are not as well organized as the
Jewish survivors.
<p>
   Selected survivors may get payments of up to dlrs 1,000, a
relative fortune for elderly and infirm Jews in the former Soviet
bloc. Their average age is about 80, and many are living in extreme
poverty.

<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  New genetic test results released Thursday call
into question claims that a Yemenite Jewish immigrant to Israel and
a woman living in California are mother and daughter.
<p>
   A tearful televised reunion last summer between Margalit Omessi
and Tsila Levine of Sacramento provided what appeared to be the
missing link in a chain of evidence pointing to a 1950s scheme to
take children from Yemenite immigrants and give them to
European-descended families, many survivors of the Holocaust.
<p>
   Hundreds of toddlers and babies disappeared during the confusion
that accompanied the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants
after the creation of the Jewish state. Assertions that most of
them died of disease have been rejected by the families.
<p>
   But DNA tests by the state-run Abu Kabir Forensic Institute
failed to confirm family ties between Omessi and Levine, officials
said Thursday. ``She is not the daughter,'' said Health Ministry
director Gabi Barabash.
<p>
   Abu Kabir director Yehuda Hess said the institute's test was
more specific than an earlier test done at a Hebrew University lab
that found a DNA match between the women.
<p>
   Levine rejected the latest findings.
<p>
   ``Why should I rely on tests by the Health Ministry, the same
government body that knew of the disappearance of the children of
Yemenites and other ethnic groups years ago?'' she told a radio
interviewer. ``I have found the truth and I am happy with the
truth. I believe with all my heart that this is my mother.''
<p>
   Levine, 50, had grown up wondering why she was so much darker
than the other children on her kibbutz, almost all of whom were of
European background.
<p>
   Eventually her parents told her she had been adopted, but they
knew little of her origins. When she turned 18, she tried
unsuccessfully to find the identities of her biological parents.
Years later, she moved to the United States with her husband and
two sons.
<p>
   Two months ago, she returned to Israel and published two
photographs of herself in a newspaper, one taken when she was a
baby, the other in the past year.
<p>
   Omessi thought she recognized her baby Saada, who disappeared
one day almost 50 years ago from a clinic.
<p>
   When the initial DNA test proved positive, the reunion became a
national sensation and boosted claims that there had been a
systematic kidnapping of babies.
<p>
   The new test spawned suggestions of a coverup.
<p>
   ``I don't trust the state,'' said Batsheva Kohlani, a daughter
of Omessi who could be Levine's sister. ``They are biased. They did
a crime in the 1950s. There is no reason not to do it again.''

Archeologists find shaft with skeletal remains of human sacrifices
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Archeologists on Thursday said they have
unearthed a shaft containing skeletons of human sacrifices dating
from before Christ.
<p>
   The Austria Press Agency said the find was unique in Europe. The
shaft, near Linz, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) west of Vienna
originated from the Celtic era, probably between 600-700 B.C.

<p>
   The report by Notimex said dozens of people were reported
missing, following muddy torrents that swept hundreds of cars, huge
tree trunks and tons of mud down mountains toward the sea.
<p>
   Elsewhere in Acapulco, Mexico's most populous Pacific resort
with 2.9 million inhabitants, frightened residents crossed torrents
of roaring water and debris over ropes strung across intersections.
<p>
   The Notimex report could not be immediately confirmed and other
reports gave widely varying numbers of dead and missing.
<p>
   Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio Santiago, reached by telephone
in Acapulco, said the relief agency counted five dead but said at
least 50 people were reported missing in flooding and mudslides.
<p>
   ``Right now we can't give an exact figure. But we do know of at
least five people dead,'' said Santiago, adding that one body had
already been brought to the Red Cross from a hard-hit neighborhood
on Acapulco's slopes.
<p>
   ``We've got rain coming down, mudslides blocking roads. Houses
have fallen, walls are down.''
<p>
   Television footage showed dramatic images of cars being battered
and swept away in the currents, tree trunks piled against homes and
frightened residents milling in doorways, soaked by the rains.

Russia's Rybkin urges compromise with Chechnya
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  A top Russian official sounded a conciliatory note
Thursday as political talks resumed with Chechnya's government,
saying ``we must work out a compromise.''
<p>
   The comment by Ivan Rybkin, Security Council secretary and the
Kremlin's top negotiator in the talks in southern Russia, seemed to
signal a softening of the harsh rhetoric exchanged by the two sides
in recent weeks.
<p>
   But Rybkin, in remarks reported by the Interfax news agency,
gave no indication Moscow is about to back off on key points, such
as its insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian
Federation.
<p>
   Russian Television reported that the Russian delegation at the
talks in Sochi will hold fast to its position that a decision on
Chechnya's political status be put off until 2001  &MD;  five years
after the war ended.
<p>
   Kidnappings and human rights violations in Chechnya were high on
the Russian agenda for the talks, Russian news reports said.
<p>
   Rybkin was joined at the talks by Security Council deputy
secretaries Boris Berezovsky and Boris Agapov, while Chechnya's
delegation was led by First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov
and Deputy Prime Minister Akhmed Zakayev.
<p>
   ``I am confident that a compromise will be struck,'' Rybkin said
before the latest round began.
<p>
   The talks are aimed at resolving differences obstructing
relations between the two former warring sides.
<p>
   President Boris Yeltsin has said that if the talks don't produce
results, he'll personally work out an arrangement with Chechnya
like the one Moscow has with its republic of Tatarstan, which
allows for power-sharing and considerable autonomy.
<p>
   The Kremlin still wants to retain some authority in the
breakaway region, including joint control of borders and airspace,
while Chechnya is determined to gain recognition of its sovereignty
as well as major war reparations.
<p>
   Russian hard-liners have warned that an agreement with Chechnya
would lead to the breakup of the Russian Federation.

Spainiards slow start in Bordeaux team golf

<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - Sluggish and inconsistent, the star duo
of Severiano Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal could only finish
tied for 18th of the 30 two-man teams after the first round in the
dollars 560,000 Novotel Open Pairs tournament here Thursday.
<p>
   France and Spain dominated the leader board with France's Jeff
Remesy and Raphael Jacquelin and their compatriots Jean-Louis Guepy
and Michel Besanceney finishing with 64 together with the
all-Spanish teams of Santiago Luna and Jose Rivero, Ignacio Garrido
and Miguel Carrasco, and Carl Suneson and Pedro Linhart.
<p>
   Playing in the 4-ball, better-ball format the name Spanish pair
of Ballesteros and Olazabal shot a 67 over the par-71, 6,316-meter,
(6,909-yard) Meoc Club course to finish three shots off the pace.
<p>
   They could only par the front-9 but then picked up four straight
birdies from the 10th before bogeying the par-5 14th.
<p>
   ``We had a good run there and came to the 14th looking for an
easy birdie,'' Ballesteros said.
<p>
   ``But we both hit into the ditch and bogeyed and that stopped
the momentum.''
<p>
   Friday's second round will be played in foursomes, each player
hitting the same ball alternately. Saturday the greensome format is
adopted -- the best drive chosen then alternate shots -- and the
tournament concludes with both players in singles, 36 holes
counting.
<p>
   `` Obviously Sunday a lot of ground can be made up.''
Ballesteros said.
<p>
   The Spaniards are together for the first time since capturing
this event two years ago.

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An artist who hoped to win a prize with an
unusual statue that incorporated human and animal bones instead
wound up in jail, charged with desecration of the dead.
<p>
   Ahmed Desouki Korali's composition went on display earlier this
week at the Ninth Exhibition for Young Artists in Cairo. The statue
 &MD;  which included a human leg, a cat skull and a sheep spine  &MD;  was
covered with transparent polyester to create a mummy effect.
<p>
   Some viewers were alarmed, and judges at the exhibition called
the police, the Al-Ahram newspaper reported Thursday.
<p>
   Korali, charged with violating a law that forbids tampering with
the dead, later was released on dlrs 147 bail.
<p>
   ``I didn't realize that using human parts is against the law,''
he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ``I was
just so caught up in the excitement of the idea of the statue.''
<p>
   He said he had asked the undertaker for a leg bone, but got an
entire leg. ``Beauty is in the surprise,'' he said.
<p>
   The undertaker also was detained  &MD;  for acquiring the human
bones, apparently from the Khanka cemetery in central Cairo, the
paper said. The statue was being examined by Egyptian forensic
officials.
<p>
   It was a reversal of fortunes for Korali, who two years ago won
first prize for sculpture at the same exhibition.

UNHCR urges action on Asian, African refugees after ruckus in
Moscow
By LYNN BERRY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  The U.N. refugee agency urged Moscow authorities
Thursday to do more for Asian and Africans who are seeking asylum
after about 50 frustrated refugees demolished the agency's office
in the Russian capital.
<p>
   ``We had been fearing such an incident might happen,'' John
Horekens of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a
statement from the Geneva office.
<p>
   About 50 people from Angola and Congo destroyed most of the
furniture Monday in the UNHCR's office when ``the frustration of
the asylum seekers flared into spontaneous violence,'' the agency
said. No one was hurt.
<p>
   Russian police detained 48 refugees and later released all but
three, who were charged with taking part in riots, the daily
Kommersant reported Wednesday.
<p>
   ``For years, these people have been living with no prospect of a
better future, in conditions of great hardship, with no security or
rights,'' said Horekens. ``They are feeling increasingly hopeless
and ... are turning desperate.''
<p>
   The UNHCR urged Moscow authorities to speed up the asylum
procedure for some 15,000 asylum seekers from outside the former
Soviet republics and prevent them from being harassed as illegal
residents.
<p>
   Police routinely question people on city streets, especially
those who do not appear Russian or Western, and there have been
reports of harassment. Residency permits are required to live in
Moscow, and the mayor has at times ordered police to round up and
ship out homeless people and others.
<p>
   Monday's melee began when representatives of the African asylum
seekers came to the refugee center to request money for the funeral
of a refugee from Congo whom they said was killed outside Moscow,
the UNHCR said. The agency said it has asked authorities to look
into the alleged killing.
<p>
   Tens of thousands of people have come to Moscow since the 1991
Soviet collapse, including many Russians and others from former
Soviet republics.
<p>
   Despite efforts by the Russian Federal Migration Service to
grant asylum to refugees in some parts of Russia, authorities in
Moscow have been slow to accept asylum applications, particularly
from people from outside the former Soviet Union, the UNHCR said.
<p>
   More than 1 million refugees from Angola, Congo, Afghanistan and
other African and Asian countries are estimated to have entered
Russia illegally, said Yevgeny Chernetsov, a spokesman for the
Federal Migration Service.
<p>
   ``In present economic conditions, it's very hard for us to
provide the refugees with adequate housing, food and work,'' he
said Thursday, adding that the cash-strapped country was having a
hard enough time dealing with the influx of about 1.2 million
Russians from other republics.
<p>
   Most of the African and Asian refugees are hoping to get to the
West and thus don't want to register with the Russian government,
since it would make it more difficult for them to get refugee
status elsewhere, according to Chernetsov.
<p>
   But those who want to stay in Russia also have a tough time, he
said.
<p>
   Some 1,400 people from Angola and the Congo, formerly called
Zaire, are registered in Moscow, the UNHCR said, and it provides
limited cash allowances, medical, school and social services to 277
of them.
<p>
   There are roughly 32,000 refugees from outside the former Soviet
Union registered in Moscow, the U.N. agency said.

Rwandans bury dead allegedly killed by army in retaliation for
rebel attack
By DIANNA CAHN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP)  &MD;  A day after the Rwandan army and Hutu
rebels clashed for seven hours in some of the worst fighting in
northwestern Rwanda in a year, three people were buried Thursday in
a single grave.
<p>
   But a mourner said the dead woman, her four-year-old child and
her sister were not victims of the fighting.
<p>
   The young man, who would not give his name, said the three Hutus
had been hacked to death with machetes by Tutsi soldiers in
retaliation for the attack mounted by at least 1,000 Hutu rebels.
<p>
   ``They did not live in the same area where the fighting took
place, and they were killed after the fighting had stopped,'' he
said. ``Many people were killed. It's because we are Hutus, and the
army blames us.''
<p>
   It was not immediately possible to reach anyone in the army or
government for comment. On Wednesday two military officials said 80
Hutu rebels and two government soldiers had been killed in the
fighting.
<p>
   Ten civilians were at the local hospital Thursday with gunshot
wounds.
<p>
   Human rights groups have charged that at least 6,000 people have
been killed in Rwanda since January, mostly civilians killed by the
army in retaliation for rebel attacks.
<p>
   Government soldiers and rebels had fought farther north of
Gisenyi along the Congo-Rwanda border, but Wednesday's attack was
the closest yet to the town.
<p>
   The rebels are former soldiers from the defeated Hutu army and
Interahamwe militia who carried out a Hutu government-orchestrated
massacre of at least half a million minority Tutsis in mid-1994.
Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu government and stopped the
genocide.
<p>
   An estimated 1 million Hutus, including the killers, fled west
to the former Zaire where they remained until last November. The
soldiers and militia used refugee camps as bases from which to
attack Rwanda. Many of the fighters returned with the civilian
refugees and established bases in northwestern Rwanda.
<p>
   Liberette Muragijimana was among 500 Hutus who fled to
neighboring Congo to escape Wednesday's fighting. But officials
turned them back to Rwanda, and they waited in Gisenyi's soccer
stadium Thursday for rides home.
<p>
   Muragijimana fled to the former Zaire 1994 as well, and lost her
husband and a four-year-old child there.
<p>
   She said it was difficult to grab her remaining three-year-old
daughter and run again, but she said she had no choice when the
fighting engulfed her village on Ruvabu Hill that looms over
Gisenyi.
<p>
   Other Hutus fled towards Congo when fighting escalated last
week, but Congolese officials closed the border to avoid a new
influx of refugees.
<p>
   There was life on the streets in Gisenyi town Thursday, but
villages on the surrounding hills were strangely quiet.
<p>
   In the market, where a shell landed Wednesday on a truck but did
not explode, there were few buyers for the clothing, fruit,
vegetables and household items merchants put out for sale.
<p>
   ``It's not like other days, because today a lot of people are
afraid,'' said Muhoza Pascazi, a seller.
<p>
   Barefoot men in tattered, dirty clothing lined up on the soccer
field to show their identity cards to soldiers. But one soldier
said the men were not suspected of being rebels.
<p>
   Across the street at the airport hundreds of soldiers lounging
on the grass along the airstrip watched as several of their
colleagues chased a young man across the tarmac. They beat him with
their rifle butts and dragged him to a small shack from which
smacking sounds could be heard.
<p>
   ``He's Interahamwe,'' muttered an airport official, referring to
the militia that killed Tutsis. ``Otherwise, why would he be
running?''

India's notorious outlaw strikes again
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  India's most notorious outlaw  &MD;  wanted
in the killing of 130 policemen and the slaughter of more than 200
elephants  &MD;  kidnapped 23 civilians Thursday, news reports said.
<p>
   He later freed most of them.
<p>
   The latest kidnapping came barely a month after outlaw Koose
Munuswamy Veerappan released all nine forest guards he held hostage
for 45 days in the dense forests of the southern state of Tamil
Nadu.
<p>
   Veerappan kept six people  &MD;  mostly environmental researchers  &MD; 
hostage in the forests of Bandipur in neighboring Karnataka state,
Press Trust of India news agency reported quoting state forest
minister Gurupadappa Nagamarpalli. The others were mostly tourists.
<p>
   Veerappan reportedly has sent an audio cassette containing his
latest demands through a messenger, a local cable TV channel
reported. The messenger was expected to reach Karnakata's capital
of Bangalore on Friday, it said.
<p>
   The outlaw apparently was irked that both states have rejected
his demand for amnesty in the killings that spanned two decades. If
convicted, he faces life imprisonment.
<p>
   Veerappan has eluded police for 15 years, often moving from
place to place in the forests of Tamil Nadu and neighboring
Karnataka states.

HUATULCO: the rains.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Before dawn Thursday, the storm raked Acapulco as it moved
northward up the coast toward the beach resorts of Zihuatanejo,
Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta. At 1500 GMT, Pauline was near
Zihuatanejo, Mexico and moving west-northwest up the coast at 15
mph (24 kph), the hurricane center in Miami said.
<p>
   ``We have an emergency. There are many dead. The flooding is
continuing,'' said federal highway police officer Abraham Silva,
reached in Acapulco.
<p>
   He said he could not provide a good estimate of the number of
dead but that he feared the toll could rise. A telephone interview
with him was severed because of the poor telephone links after
Pauline's passage.
<p>
   Authorities had no immediate injury reports from in and around
hard-hit Acapulco and surrounding Guerrero state, but Red Cross and
civil defense officials in neighboring Oaxaca said at least 46
people were injured there.
<p>
   Most of the injuries were from flying debris, according to the
reports.
<p>
   In Puerto Angel, where Pauline first rumbled ashore, many houses
that weren't made of concrete were blown away, said Federico
Velazquez, an official with the Federal Highway Police who had had
radio contact with that city.

Archeologists find shaft with skeletal remains of human sacrifices
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Archeologists on Thursday said they have
unearthed a shaft containing skeletons of human sacrifices dating
more than 2,000 years ago.
<p>
   The Austria Press Agency said the find was unique in Europe. The
shaft originated from the Celtic era, probably between 600-700 B.C.
It was found near Linz, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) west of
Vienna,

<p>
   Earlier Thursday, President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to
Germany, ordered military and civil defense workers into the
hard-hit states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, Notimex reported. Telephone
communication to much of the coast was cut after Pauline began
pummeling the shore late Wednesday.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was extended Thursday morning hundreds of
miles (kilometers) up the coast, from Acapulco to Puerto Vallarta,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shore, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
<p>
   Overnight, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and fishing villages
near Huatulco, churning up 30-foot (9.1-meter) seas with 115 mph
(185 kph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and ruined
residences.
<p>
   Around Huatulco, Pauline's violent winds and rains turned
streets into rivers, ripped large trees from the ground and sent
makeshift homes of plywood flying. Waves up to 30 feet (9.1 meters)
tall tore away the beachfront of the Huatulco Sheraton and other
bays, leaving tree limbs scattered everywhere.
<p>
   Sheila Butler, 78, of McAllen, Texas, said she had never seen a
hurricane so strong. ``We come from South Texas, so we've seen
hurricanes, but this was a real strong one,'' she said.
<p>
   ``It was very dramatic, something we had never seen here
before,'' said hotel security guard Nicanor Reyes, who was forced
to stay overnight at the hotel because of flooded roads.
<p>
   ``I don't know what the situation is in my house,'' he said,
worrying about his wife and five children.
<p>
   Pauline nearly flattened the poor community of Las Tres Cruces,
next to the Huatulco airport.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' said 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo Mayo,
surveying the humble neighborhood where pots and pans lay scattered
amid broken glass and waterlogged mattresses.
<p>
   U.S. Hurricane Center specialist Lixion Avila said early
Thursday that Pauline's path remained highly unpredictable. While
the hurricane could weaken rapidly if it heads inland, Avila said
it could keep up its potentially destructive fury by staying close
to water. Either way, serious threats of flooding and tidal surges
remained.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American southwest as a
tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for the desert.
<p>
   Forecasters said El Nino, a phenomenon in which unusually warm
Pacific waters disrupt weather patterns, could be to blame for the
high number of powerful hurricanes this year.

Explosive device explodes in southern Egypt, kills
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  An explosive device suspected to have been
left behind by Muslim militants went off in southern Egypt
Thursday, killing a farmer and wounding another, police officials
said.
<p>
   The device went off when the two farmers picked it up from a
sugar-cane field in the village of el-Mehras, in the Minya
province, which is a stronghold of Muslim militants.
<p>
   Police turned over what remained of the device to the criminal
lab, said the police officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
<p>
   They suspect it may have been a home-made bomb that Muslim
militants had left behind.
<p>
   The militants often make their own bombs in their campaign
against Egypt's secular government, and hide them in open fields.
<p>
   More than 1,100 people have died in the five year battle between
the government and the militants, who want to install strict
Islamic rule. The government has largely crushed the insurgency.

Tyson testifies about scuffle at Rolls Royce
By SAMUEL MAULL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Mike Tyson testified Thursday that he hit a
``raving and ranting'' Mitch Green outside a New York City store
and then fled to his Rolls Royce, only to have Green angrily rip
off the car's sideview mirror as he tried to drive away.
<p>
   When that happened, Tyson said, ``I got out of the car. I was
very upset.''
<p>
   The former heavyweight champion said he hit Green again and
``this time he stayed down.''
<p>
   Tyson was testifying in a lawsuit brought by Green, a former
heavyweight contender who seeks dlrs 25 million from Tyson for
injuries suffered in the street fight on Aug. 23, 1988.
<p>
   Green also claims he was cheated by boxing promoter Don King,
receiving only dlrs 30,000 to fight Tyson in 1986. In testimony on
Wednesday, King denied cheating Green.
<p>
   Tyson told the hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court that Green was
shouting that King had ``robbed'' him, and grabbed Tyson's shirt as
he tried to leave, whereupon Tyson hit him to get away.
<p>
   He said he got into his Rolls and locked the doors, but Green
followed, ``punching the windows and screaming'' at him, then
ripped off the mirror.
<p>
   Tyson, under questioning by his lawyer, Robert Hirth, said that
when he hit Green the second time, he hurt his hand  &MD;  not enough to
hinder his ring ability, ``but every now and then it hurts.''

<p>
   HUATULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded Mexico's
southwestern Pacific coast Thursday with 100 mph (160 kph) winds
and towering seas, creating fast-churning rivers of mud, water and
debris that raced down the main streets of Acapulco. At least 15
people were reported killed and dozens were missing, the government
said.
<p>
   The report by the official news agency Notimex said many of the
missing were caught in muddy torrents that swept hundreds of cars,
huge tree trunks and tons of mud down the mountains behind Acapulco
toward the sea. Residents of Acapulco, a city of 2.9 million,
struggled to cross torrents of roaring water using ropes strung
across downtown intersections.
<p>
   Tourists huddled in darkened hotels and hundreds of locals
sought refuge in emergency shelters.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was extended Thursday morning hundreds of
miles (kilometers) up the coast, from Acapulco to Puerto Vallarta,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shore, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
<p>
   Before dawn, the storm raked Acapulco as it moved up the coast
toward the beach resorts of Zihuatanejo, Manzanillo and Puerto
Vallarta. At 1500 GMT, Pauline was near Zihuatanejo, Mexico and
moving west-northwest up the coast at 15 mph (24 kph), the
hurricane center said.
<p>
   Media reports gave widely varying numbers of dead and missing.
<p>
   Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio Santiago, reached by telephone
in Acapulco, said the relief agency counted five dead but at least
50 people were reported missing in flooding and mudslides. ``We've
got rain coming down, mudslides blocking roads. Houses have fallen,
walls are down,'' he said.
<p>
   Authorities had no immediate injury reports from hard-hit
Acapulco and the surrounding state of Guerrero, but Red Cross and
civil defense officials in neighboring Oaxaca said at least 46
people were injured there.

U.N. says aid getting through despite violence in Iraq
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  Food supplies continue to reach people in
northern Iraq despite recent shooting incidents involving U.N.
convoys in the Kurdish-dominated region, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
<p>
   ``Food distribution in northern Iraq is slightly slowed by
recent violence,'' Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. oil-for-food
program, said.
<p>
   Falt, reached by telephone in Baghdad, said the delays in
delivering aid purchased with proceeds from U.N.-supervised oil
sales have been minimal.
<p>
   U.N. convoys carrying food have been fired on twice by suspected
members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, Turkish Kurds who have been
battling the Turkish army in northern Iraq.
<p>
   No one was injured in the two incidents -- Sept. 29 and last
Monday. Falt said in both cases, the convoys were flying blue U.N.
flags and displaying U.N. insignias.
<p>
   Falt said the attacks constitute ``a serious escalation'' in the
security threats to U.N. workers of the oil-for-food program, under
which Iraq is allowed to sell oil to buy humanitarian goods for its
people.
<p>
   ``The two areas are very close to the borders, 30 kilometers (18
miles) or less,'' Falt said. ``These are areas which are sparsely
populated and have been `no-go' areas in the past. The incidents
are significant because they are new, (but) we certainly don't want
to over-dramatize them. The food is getting through.''

Tories, seeking new image, reach out to gays and blacks

<TEXT>
<p>
   BLACKPOOL, England (AP)  &MD;  Reaching out to gays, blacks and
single mothers, and plastering over bitter divisions about Europe,
Britain's Conservative Party is seeking a gentler, cooler image as
it grapples for a way back from defeat.
<p>
   During the Tories' annual conference, their first since losing
power in May 1 national elections, ex-Cabinet ministers made
confessional-style apologies for a government they said voters
regarded as ``selfish, arrogant and conceited.''
<p>
   Outside the convention, which ends Friday, small groups of
activists gathered in hotel lounges at meetings with themes such
as, ``Where Do We Go From Here?'', ``Is Conservatism Dead?'' and
``Getting Them Back  &MD;  How To Identify Switchers.''
<p>
   For the first time the party which through 18 years in power
advocated what it termed ``family values,'' dabbled in political
correctness.
<p>
   ``For good or ill, many people nowadays do not marry and yet
head stable families with children,'' ex-Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo said Thursday.
<p>
   ``The Tory party is conservative and not given to political
correctness. Still the party never rejects the world that is,''
added Portillo, 44.
<p>
   During the four-day conference, party liberals warned against a
lurch to the right following the landslide victory by Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party, which has adopted Tory-style
tenets of free markets and curbing state spending.
<p>
   Right-wingers placed their hopes in Blair calling a referendum
within the next few years on Britain adopting a single European
currency  &MD;  with the Tories leading a victorious ``no'' campaign.
<p>
   The conference agreed on a revamp of the party structure over
the next six months, giving the previously passive rank-and-file a
say in electing the leader and in policy.
<p>
   With the mainly white, mainly middle-aged membership down to a
notional 400,000, but more likely 200,000, William Hague, the
36-year-old new party leader, announced a drive to attract the
young and ethnic minorities. Blacks and Asians, about 4 percent of
the population, overwhelmingly vote Labor.
<p>
   Hague slapped down a former party chairman, Lord Tebbit, 66, who
attacked ``multiculturalism,'' and defended sending a message of
support in the summer to a London rally by Gay Pride, a national
movement.
<p>
   ``It doesn't mean that we have suddenly had a great lapse of
morality,'' Hague said in a BBC radio interview Thursday.
<p>
   ``It means that we are a tolerant and inclusive party, and a
party that wants to be representative of the whole nation has got
to be like that.''
<p>
   Earlier, delegates gave a standing ovation to former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. Since being ousted in a party revolt in
1990, she traditionally comes to the four-day conference to hear
one debate but not to speak.
<p>
   Party divisions over whether Britain should adopt a single
European currency, which destabilized ex-Prime Minister John
Major's government, rumbled on in Blackpool. But powerlessness
permitted compromise.
<p>
   Hague said the Conservatives will oppose Britain adopting the
new currency, the euro, for the ``foreseeable future.'' Previously,
he had ruled it out for 10 years.
<p>
   ``The beauty of their position is that the decision is not in
their hands,'' wrote Boris Johnson, commentator in the
pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph. ``This mistake is Labor's to
make.''
<p>
   Some commentators urged the Tories, now facing five, and perhaps
10 years out of power, simply to wait for Blair to stumble.
<p>
   ``The 1997 election would have been lost by any ruler ... The
electorate was bored. It was finished with the Tories,'' wrote
Simon Jenkins, former editor of The Times of London, and now a
political columnist. ``(Now) They need to sit tight and ... watch
the make-up fade, crack and fall from the face of new Labor.''

Clash of rival soccer fans kills teen-ager
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  A homemade bomb exploded during a
clash between rival soccer fans during a first-division game,
killing a teen-age boy, police said Thursday.
<p>
   Claudenir Reis, 17, died during a 0-0 draw between Vasco da Gama
and Cruzeiro Wednesday night in Belo Horizonte, 340 kilometers (210
miles) north of Rio, police said.
<p>
   Reis had joined some Vasco fans when they ran into a group of
Cruzeiro supporters at a refreshment stand during halftime. Police
said the two groups argued and someone threw a billiard ball packed
with gunpowder, which exploded and killed Reis. Three other fans
were injured.
<p>
   Police enlisted the aid of Mauricio Otavio, head of the Cruzeiro
fan club called ``Mafia Azul''  &MD;  or Blue Mafia, for the team's
colors  &MD;  to help in the investigation.
<p>
   ``We have to root for our teams with happiness, not violence,''
Otavio said.

First lady says time to `move hearts, change attitudes' toward
women

<p>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)  &MD;  In a land where dictatorships have
given way to democracies, Hillary Rodham Clinton called on nations
of the Americas Thursday to go a step further to protect the
political and economic rights of women.
<p>
   The only way for democracies to ``survive and thrive,'' she
said, is give women more power ``to seek and claim their rights as
citizens and as human beings.''
<p>
   Speaking at a conference of Latin American first ladies, Mrs.
Clinton suggested the challenge could be more difficult than the
giant undertaking of building the Panama Canal, whose Pacific
entrance was just blocks away.
<p>
   ``Instead of mountains, we seek to move hearts, to change old
attitudes, to banish hunger and disease and ignorance, to educate
all our children ... to empower the women of our hemisphere to
participate fully in the life of our nations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   The first lady, speaking at the annual Conference of Wives of
Heads of State and Government of the Americas, included the United
States among the countries where women need greater opportunity.
<p>
   ``In too many countries, my own as well, too many rights are
denied and too many doors of opportunity remain tightly closed,''
Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   Without being specific, she called for changes in both law and
attitude to protect women's property and employment rights, combat
sexual and domestic violence, encourage political participation and
reduce poverty.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton underscored her message by witnessing the signing
of a dlrs 4.8 million grant from the Agency for International
Development to the Inter-American Institute on Human Rights, the
region's pre-eminent human rights organization.
<p>
   Where once the institute's focus was repressives regimes that
engaged in torture and execution, now its Gender and Human Rights
program pushes for greater legal and political opportunity for
women.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton cited signs of progress throughout Latin America.
In Costa Rica, for example, women pushed through a law against
domestic violence and worked to train police about the problem. In
El Salvador, she said, legislators have modernized rape laws and
required politicians to pay child support before running for
office.
<p>
   The first lady also was swearing in new Peace Corps volunteers
on Thursday and touring the Panama Canal, which the United States
is gradually turning over to the Panamanians under a treaty
negotiated during the Carter admnistration.
<p>
   After returning home on Friday, the first lady returns to Latin
America on Sunday with President Clinton for a visit to Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela. She plans to use the trip to see success
stories  &MD;  local programs that ensure women have access to low cost
credit, family planning, education and other needs.

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small charter plane carrying seven
German tourists and two Spanish crew members crashed Thursday
morning as it prepared to land at the Banjul airport, killing all
but one person on board, officials said.
<p>
   The crash happened about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers from the airport
in Banjul, the capital of this West African nation, said Claud
Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority.
<p>
   The plane crashed because of a storm, according to a statement
from Naysa, the Spanish company that owned the plane. It gave no
further details on the cause of the crash.
<p>
   Jensen said the crash was being investigated, but noted that the
airport had lost contact with the plane shortly before it slammed
into the ground.
<p>
   He had no information on the weather at the time of the crash.
<p>
   The flight originated in Las Palmas, the principal city of Grand
Canary Island, one of a string of Spanish islands off the coast of
Morocco, Jensen said.
<p>
   The passengers  &MD;  five men and two women  &MD;  were German, said
Pascal Hector, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry. One
male passenger, Tobias Schrirver, escaped with minor injuries and
had been hospitalized in Banjul, Naysa said in its statement.
<p>
   The company identified the other passengers as: Dieter Hoeninng,
Ilse Hoeninng, Christor Feige, Reinhard Frings, Thomas Schriever
and Washington Nuyken. Their ages and hometowns were not
immediately available.
<p>
   The two-person crew was Spanish, according to Sebastian Drover,
the Spanish vice consul in Banjul.
<p>
   Naysa identified them as Juan Federico Casteleiro Cullen and
Jose Miguel Aznar Rivero. No further details were provided.

Yeltsin in Strasbourg says won't seek third term as president
EDS: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting Chirac, color
By DEBORAH SEWARD
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  Boris Yeltsin said Thursday he would
not seek a third term as president and predicted a young, energetic
democrat would become Russia's next leader.
<p>
   Speaking firmly after arriving in Strasbourg, France for a
summit of European leaders, Yeltsin said he was the guarantor of
Russia's constitution and had no intention of changing it to be
able to run again.
<p>
   ``I will not run for a third term and because of that will not
change the constitution. When my two terms are up, there will be a
new, spirited, energetic democrat,'' in my pl1QM%9said.
<p>
   Yeltsin's declaration he would not seek to run a third time when
his term as president expires in the year 2000 comes after more
than a month of speculation about his real political intentions.
<p>
   Just a week ago while attending a trade fair in the central
Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod, Yeltsin, 66, hinted he was still
undecided as to whether to seek a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin, who became Russia's first democratically elected
president in 1991, on Sept. 1 had flatly declared he would not seek
a third term.
<p>
   Yeltsin's political allies had reportedly been seeking ways to
allow him to seek a new four-year term. Two terms are the limit
under Russia's new constitution adopted in 1993, but Yeltsin could
claim he had not actually served two full terms under it.
<p>
   However, in Strasbourg, Yeltsin said, ``I am the guarantor of
the constitution and above all must show I will carry it out.''
<p>
   Yeltsin, 66, has a long history of health problems and underwent
heart bypass surgery a year ago. But he now appears robust, and
there is no doubt he intends to serve out this term.
<p>
   A host of presidential contenders are already casting their eyes
on the 2000 presidential elections, including current Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, his first deputy Boris Nemtsov, a
young energetic reformer. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzkhov and Yeltsin
opponents such as Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, former
security chief Alexander Lebed and ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky are also possible candidates.
<p>
   After arriving in Strasbourg, Yeltsin also said he hoped for a
solution to the conflict with the Duma, the lower house of the
Russian parliament, which is dominated by his opponents.
<p>
   Zyuganov, the Communist leader, on Thursday pledged to hold a
no-confidence vote in the government next week following sharp
differences over next year's budget.
<p>
   Addressing the issue of the new post-Cold War Europe, Yeltsin
said he thought it would take at least 10 years for his country to
fully integrate into Europe.
<p>
   Yeltsin later had dinner with French President Jacques Chirac at
Chez Yvonne, a typical Alsatian restaurant in the center of
Strasbourg.
<p>
   Yelsin said ``everything was very gooR 9he and Chirac planned to
discuss French-Russian relations. They were to dine on veal, an
onion quiche accompanied by a light white wine.
<p>
   On Friday afternoon, Yeltsin will address the Council of Europe
summit.
<p>
   As one of his goals, Yeltsin has said he wants to persuade
fellow leaders to lessen United States influence on the European
continent.

Faxon vs. Montgomerie in Ryder II; Nobilo, Woosnam, Singh advance
Eds: AMS; RECASTS lead with new details, new quotes throughout
By STEPHEN WADE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP)  &MD;  Brad Faxon's World Match Play
quarterfinal against Colin Montgomerie is being cast as ``Ryder Cup
II.'' But Faxon isn't buying it.
<p>
   ``It's not going to get the Ryder Cup back to the States. It's
not the same as much as you make it out to be,'' said Faxon, who
beat European Ryder Cup player Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland 2
and 1 Thursday in the 36-hole first round.
<p>
   Faxon, New Zealand's Frank Nobilo, Ian Woosnam and Vijay Singh
reached Friday's quarterfinals with wins Thursday. The main
casualty was Faxon's American Ryder teammate Phil Mickelson, who
lost on the second playoff hole (the 38th overall) to Nobilo after
a 12-foot (4 meter) putt lipped out on the 36th, which would have
been the match winner.
<p>
   In the other two first-round matches, Ian Woosnam won over
European Ryder Cup teammate Jesper Parnevik 4 and 3, and Singh
defeated Tsukasa Watanabe of Japan 4 and 3.
<p>
   Last year Mickelson also lost in the first round on the final
hole. This time he drove his tee shot on the 36th hole into a
bunker and settled for par as Nobilo got birdie to force the
playoff.
<p>
   ``I thought I had the putt made on 18, but as I look back on it
 &MD;  it was the drive into the bunker than hurt me,'' Mickelson said.
<p>
   ``It was a classic match, a real tussle,'' Nobilo said. ``On the
17th when I hit it out of bounds I thought it was over. But on the
18th, Phil hit that fairway bunker and I was given a chance.''
<p>
   Nobilo closed the American out on the second playoff hole with a
tee shot to one foot (30 cm) on the 155-yard (140-meter) par-3
second hole.
<p>
   It all may be moot anyway.
<p>
   South African and world No. 3 Ernie Els has won this event three
straight times and has yet to lose in nine matches.
<p>
   Woosnam, the 5-foot-4 (1.62 m) Welshman will take aim at the 6-3
(1.91) Els in the quarterfinals while Faxon faces Montgomerie,
Nobilo plays Price, and Singh plays Australian Steve Elkington.
<p>
   Els, Price, Elkington and Montgomerie were the four seeds and
got byes into the quarterfinals  &MD;  always an advantage.
<p>
   ``The wear and tear of 36 holes for four straight days has got
to be a factor,'' Faxon said. ``And most of the matches usually go
down to the last two or three holes.''
<p>
   Prior to the Ryder Cup two weeks ago, Montgomerie commented that
Faxon's pending divorce would hurt his play and predicted his wild
drives would doom him on the tight Valderrama course.
<p>
   As it happened, Faxon won only one of three possible points as
the Europeans won 14 1/2-13 1/2 to keep the Ryder Cup.
<p>
   ``On Sunday (the final day of the Ryder Cup) some people told me
some of his comments that were written,'' Faxon said. ``I didn't
want to make a big deal of it until I talked to Monty myself.''
<p>
   ``I talked to Monty a couple of days ago,'' Faxon added.
``Things get twisted up. Monty and I are friends.''
<p>
   Woosnam, plagued recently by horrible driving, played with a new
driver Thursday after experimenting ``with 14 last week.'' The new
American-made model, sold under the brand name ``Tegra,'' is a
``more center-shafted model to help amateurs draw the ball,''
Woosnam explained.
<p>
   He'll need the distance to stay with the long-hitting Els.
<p>
   ``Maybe this is the one that will do it for me,'' he said. ``If
I can get it in the fairway, I can usually do all right.''
<p>
   When one reporter termed it a ``Tegra Woods'' because of the
extra 40 yards (meters) off the tee, Woosnam just rolled his eyes.
``No, nowhere near.''
<p>
   The Singh-Watanabe match was never really close. Singh, the
runner-up last year to Els, was 3 up after the first 18 and went 4
up with Watanabe bogeyed the 21st and 5 up with Singh eagled the
par-5 22nd hole.

Klimt landscape fetches 14.5 million pounds (dlrs 22.8 million)
EDS: Dollar value of sale in graf 1 as calculated by Christie's
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  A landscape painting by the Austrian artist Gustav
Klimt sold for 14,521,500 pounds (dlrs 23,524,830) Thursday after a
spirited contest between two bidders.
<p>
   Christie's auctioneers had predicted that the painting would
sell for more than 6 million pounds. The buyer, a private collector
bidding by telephone, was not identified.
<p>
   It was the highest price ever for a Klimt, and the highest price
for any painting sold in London since 1988, when Pablo Picasso's
``Acrobate et jeune Arlequin) sold for 20.9 million pounds (then
equivalent to dlrs 38.7 million).
<p>
   The record for London was set a year earlier by Vincent van
Gogh's ``The Sunflowers'' which sold for 24.75 million pounds (then
equivalent to about dlrs 40 million).
<p>
   The previous highest sale for a Klimt painting was dlrs 14.7
million for a landscape sold at Sotheby's in New York in May.
<p>
   Klimt's painting, whose seller has not been identified, shows
the Kammer house at Lake Attersee near Salzburg, Austria. It is
over three feet square and will be auctioned Oct. 9.
<p>
   Klimt painted it while on vacation there in 1909 with his
mistress Emilie Floege and her sisters. Four other views of the
house he did between 1908 and 1912 are in museums in Vienna and
Prague.
<p>
   Klimt died in 1918. He was among the founders of a modern art
movement in Germany and Austria called the Sezession, which
rejected academic painting for impressionist and art nouveau
styles.

Precede JERUSALEM
Israel may release more withheld tax revenues
Eds: AMS. RECASTS, UPDATES with Hamas rally in Gaza
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)  &MD;  Hamas leaders gathered in Gaza as
part of the weeklong celebration of their spiritual leader's return
vowed Thursday to continue fighting Israel, despite earlier
conciliatory statements made by Sheik Ahmed Yassin himself.
<p>
   ``Hamas will continue to terrorize all the enemies of God and we
will continue in our Jihad and resistance,'' said Hamas political
leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who was released from Israeli prison
earlier this year and is considered a relative moderate.
<p>
   Rantisi shared the stage in a Gaza soccer stadium with Yassin as
the cleric received a phone call from Khaled Mashaal, Hamas'
strategist in Jordan who was the target of a failed Israeli
assassination attempt last month.
<p>
   His voice amplified by speakers, Mashaal said he was honored to
have helped free Yassin, who was released last week as part of a
swap in which Jordan returned two Israeli agents captured in the
attack: ``It would have been my greatest pleasure to die for this
cause.''
<p>
   Yassin himself told more than 1,000 people from the town of Khan
Younis who came to the stadium that Hamas would not negotiate with
Israel. ``There is no connection between Hamas and Israel and, God
willing, there will never be,'' Yassin said.
<p>
   Such statements appeared to contradict Yassin's tentative truce
offer earlier in the week, when the quadriplegic, nearly blind
cleric suggested Hamas would cease attacks against Israeli
civilians if Israel stops ``attacks against our civilians.''
<p>
   It was not clear what Yassin meant, and Israel's response was
cautious. But the statement fed speculation that the authoritative
Yassin's presence in Gaza might rein in more radical group members
who in Yassin's absence had been under the influence of the group's
more hardline leadership abroad.
<p>
   Khalil Shikaki, a leading Palestinian analyst, told the AP that
Yassin would effect a ``modest change in Hamas: Hamas would cease
attacks on Israeli civilians but not stop violence completely''  &MD; 
meaning that military targets would still be legitimate.
<p>
   The crisis over Mashaal and the release of Yassin  &MD;  which posed
challenges to both Israeli and Palestinian Authority leaders  &MD;  are
seen as a reason for the summit between Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, their
first meeting in eight crisis-ridden months.
<p>
   The meeting was described as positive, and a day later there
were several indications of positive movement.
<p>
   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said after meeting
Israeli Finance Ministry director Shmuel Slavin that he was told
Israel would release the tax revenues it has been withholding to
force Arafat to crack down on Hamas in the wake of two suicide
bombings by the group in Jerusalem that killed 26.
<p>
   Israeli officials said the money  &MD;  estimated at about 170
million shekels (dlrs 49 million)  &MD;  could be handed over to the
Palestinians next week if remaining details could be worked out.
<p>
   According to the Oslo peace agreement, Israel is obligated to
hand over customs duties and other taxes levied on Palestinian
imports and purchases. The United States criticized Netanyahu for
withholding the funds, and part were released under U.S. pressure.
<p>
   Israel will also announce that it will allow Arafat to land at
the new airfield at Dahaniye in the Gaza Strip, Israel Radio said.
But the Israelis have not yet agreed to allow the Palestinians to
open the new airport to international flights.
<p>
   A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and the speaker of the Palestinian
legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, are negotiating the question of
Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
<p>
   The withdrawals were promised by Israel in peace accords, but
after two recent bombings in Jerusalem Netanyahu suspended any
further pullbacks until Israel's security demands were met.
<p>
   Israel Radio said Israel is also prepared to discuss a temporary
suspension of a controversial Jewish housing project in east
Jerusalem in return for Palestinian acquiescence in the expansion
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
<p>
   Israel would promise that the construction would be close to the
existing settlements. They would not be new neighborhoods on
distant hills which the Palestinians regard as new settlements in
all but name.
<p>
   But in a move certain to anger Netanyahu, Arafat released from
prison a prominent member of Hamas, Mohammed Taha, the radio said.

Jalabert new world time-trial champion

<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Against all odds, France's Laurent
Jalabert overcame the favorites and won the men's individual time
trial at the World Cycling Championships Thursday.
<p>
   Jalabert, ranked world number one in road racing but not really
noted as a time trial specialist, completed the 42-kilometer
(26-mile) course in 52 minutes and 1 seconds, only 3 seconds clear
of Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine, who won the silver medal.
<p>
   Third was Britain's Chris Boardman, who finished 20 seconds
behind Jalabert and four seconds ahead of Swiss Tony Rominger. Last
year he was silver medallist behind Alez Zulle in Lugano and in
1993 took the title in Sicily.
<p>
   Jalabert, 28, who averaged 49.135 kilometers per hour in the
race, said the victory was a big surprise for him.
<p>
   ``I never thought I could win a medal in the time-trial as this
race was a training for Sunday's road race.'' he said. ``But I have
to confess that I had never ridden such a good time-trial.
<p>
   Pre-favorite to the race and winner of the recent Tour of Spain,
Alex Zulle, needed to change his front wheel at the start of the
race and a second puncture before the 19th kilometer time check
pushed him down to 11th at the finish, 2 minutes, 15 seconds behind
Jalabert.
<p>
   ``It has been the worst day of my professional career'' said
Zulle, ``I have had bad days, but none as bad as this.'' ``I
recognize that I had a lot of hope in this race and without being
selfish I was expecting to hold the title.''
<p>
   Friday will feature the women's junior road race. On Sunday, the
men will have their road race, with Jalabert favored to achieve the
gold.

Swiss prosecutor heads to Spain to question two robbery suspects
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  Swiss district attorney Rolf Jaeger
left for Spain on Thursday to question two suspects arrested in
connection to one of the world's biggest robberies.
<p>
   Jaeger, the chief investigator, said he would also try to speed
up extradition procedures.
<p>
   One suspect, a 21-year-old Swiss man, was arrested in Alicante
Sept. 22, while the other, a 20-year-old Yugoslav, was caught in
Malaga five days later.
<p>
   Upon their arrest, both men were in possession of more than one
million Swiss francs (dlrs 689,000), only a slice of some 53
million Swiss francs (dlrs 37 million) stolen during the hold up of
a Zurich post office Sept. 1.
<p>
   Before his return next Tuesday, Jaeger said he would also
request the money be handed over to the Swiss government.
<p>
   The Zurich prosecutor's office believes the Swiss suspect is one
of the five armed men who attacked the post office.
<p>
   The robbers posed as postal workers, using phony identification
papers and a delivery van with stolen post office license plates,
to pass a security gate. They held postal workers at bay with guns
and stuffed the van with containers of cash from a loading dock,
then drove off. No physical force was used and no one was hurt.
<p>
   Presently, 18 people are being held in connection with the
heist: 14 in Switzerland two in Italy and two in Spain. Among them
are three of the five armed robbers.
<p>
   Investigators have recovered less than half of the stolen money:
27.5 million francs (dlrs 18.96 million).
<p>
   An international arrest mandate has been launched against Hassab
El-Bast of Lebanon and Italian Domenico Silano, believed to have
led the operation.

Serb authorities, ethnic Albanians meet to discuss education
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP)  &MD;  Eight days after Serbian police
broke up a protest by Albanian students seeking the right to study
in their own language, representatives of the two ethnic groups met
Thursday on the issue.
<p>
   The meeting was the first in eight months. It followed strong
international pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic to negotiate
the return of ethnic Albanian students to schools they left seven
years ago in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
<p>
   Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova signed an
education agreement more than a year ago, but it was never
implemented. Ethnic Albanians, over 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9
million people, have accused the government of stalling it.
<p>
   Kosovo Albanians have boycotted institutions of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's largest republic, including Serb-language education
and health systems, since Milosevic abolished the province's broad
autonomy and introduced virtual martial law in 1989.
<p>
   Kosovo's students and teachers have formed a parallel
Albanian-language schooling system, financed by Kosovo residents.
They have held classes in make-shift classrooms in private homes.
Their curriculum is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
<p>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanian students held protests in Kosovo on
Oct. 1, demanding that the education accord be implemented. They
were dispersed by Serbian police, but pledged to hold more
protests.
<p>
   The demonstrations have heightened fears that Kosovo could
explode in violence. Ethnic tensions in the province have simmered
since 1989. More than 200 people have been killed in sporadic
clashes.
<p>
   Last month, state-run radio said assailants with hand grenades
and automatic weapons simultaneously attacked 10 police stations,
drawing return fire. And four Serb policemen and five civilians
were killed in attacks earlier this year. A terrorist organization
calling itself the Kosovo Liberation Army has claimed
responsibility.
<p>
   It was not clear what Thursday's meeting of a mixed Serb-ethnic
Albanian education commission would produce. The Serbian
authorities have insisted that ethnic Albanians fully accept the
republic's education system, including Serbian-language
instruction.
<p>
   Also present were representatives of the Vatican-based St.
Egidio organization, which helped negotiate the Milosevic-Rugova
deal.

Sri Lankan Minister urges Britain, other nations to condemn Tamil
Tigers
By MARTIN BENEDYK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Britain is the ``international headquarters'' of
the Tamil Tiger guerrilla movement and should follow the U.S. lead
in outlawing contributions to the group, Sri Lanka's foreign
minister said Thursday.
<p>
   Lakshman Kadirgamar also predicted that his government would
fail to push through parliament a constitutional amendment designed
to erode support for the guerrilla movement by strengthening
regional government in the island nation.
<p>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday branded
the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization, and took steps to block
fund raising, freeze assets and punish U.S.-based backers of that
organization and 29 other foreign groups.
<p>
   Kadirgamar told Associated Press Television in an interview in
London, ``you have (in London) an organization brazenly
propagandizing against the (Sri Lankan) government.''
<p>
   ``The criminal law does not make it an offence here to commit a
crime abroad. International terrorism has no boundaries,'' he said.
``Therefore you have to change (British) law. This would be a very
big step.
<p>
   Kadirgamar called Britain the ``international headquarters'' of
the group, but did not elaborate. He said that his country would
raise the issue at the conference of heads of government of member
countries of the British Commonwealth later this month.
<p>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have a major office in
London and also are active in promoting their cause and seeking
financial support elsewhere in Europe and in North America. Most of
their funds are believed to come from sympathizers in southeast
Asia and the Gulf.
<p>
   A spokesman for the British Foreign Ministry could not
immediately be reached for comment on Kadirgamar's remarks.
<p>
   The Tigers have been waging a 14-year insurgency to establish a
homeland for the island's minority Tamil-speaking population. They
claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and military.
<p>
   The Sri Lankan foreign minister told the AP that he doubted
whether the government would obtain the two-thirds majority it
needs in parliament to amend the constitution to decentralize the
government, giving more power to the regions. It is thought that
strengthening regional government would be popular in Tamil areas
and undercut support for the armed struggle.
<p>
   ``At the moment ... the situation does not look particularly
bright in respect to getting the two thirds majority that we need
to amend the constitution,'' Kadirgamar said.
<p>
   If the government fails to push the amendment through
parliament, he said, it will seek a referendum on the issue.
<p>
   ``If we can't get two-thirds in parliament, the people will tell
us what to do,'' he said.
<p>
   The Tamil Tigers rose from a ragtag band of 26 fighters in 1983
to become one of the fiercest guerrilla groups in the world. Rebels
wear a cyanide capsule around the neck to avoid being captured
alive by police or soldiers.
<p>
   A Tamil Tiger suicide bomber was blamed for the 1991
assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at an
election rally in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

Hungarian president sets referendum date
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  &MD;  Hungary has set Nov. 16 as the date for
a referendum on whether Hungary should join NATO, but the vote
announed Thursday could be influenced by a supplementary question
on the right of foreigners to purchase arable land.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs has expressed concerns that
polarization over the land issue might lead to confusion on NATO
and result in more ``no'' votes on membership than if the NATO
question stood alone.
<p>
   The government's position is that Hungary, which hopes to join
the European Union within the next 10 years, cannot discriminate
between domestic and foreign buyers but is prepared to protect
farmers against speculators.
<p>
   Opposition parties and nationalists outside parliament have
gathered over 200,000 signatures on a petition trying to force a a
referendum that would ask voters to ban foreigners from owning any
land.
<p>
   They have gone to the Constitutional Court in an attempt to have
their question put onto the referendum.
<p>
   Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, were the
first former Soviet bloc countries to be offered membership in NATO
earlier this year.
<p>
   A majority against NATO would hurt Hungary's efforts to join not
only the defense alliance but indirectly also harm its hopes of
becoming a member of the European Union. Though the two
organizations are not formally linked, acceptance by NATO is
considered a crucial entry card into the European Union.
<p>
   According to a 1,200-sample national opinion poll released
Wednesday, only 51 percent of the respondents said they would vote
in the referendum, but 72 percent of those favored NATO membership.
<p>
   No margin of error was given.

Excerpts from two plays by Dario Fo, winner of the Nobel Prize for
literature
By The Associated Press
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Excerpts from Italian playwright Dario Fo's 1969 play ``Comic
Mystery.''
<p>
   The play retells several biblical tales, including the marriage
at Cana. Fo's narrator is a drunk recalling one of the best binges
of his life: A wedding at which a guest named Jesus, ``the one
they've nicknamed the `son of God,' '' turns water into wine.
    &QL; 
<p>
   ``I had no sooner swallowed it when I got the taste: a bit
bitter at the back, a bit sharp, almost spicy in the middle; it
sent out a deep red sparkle, a glow ... a golden vintage! ...
<p>
   And everyone began applauding. `Well done Jesus! You're divine!'
And the Madonna! The Madonna, his mother, was beside herself with
happiness and pride at having a son who was so clever at bringing
forth wine from water. Within a very short time we were all
drunk...
<p>
   Jesus got up on a table, and began pouring wine for everybody:
`Drink good people, be happy, get drunk, don't save it for later,
enjoy yourselves ...'
<p>
   And then, all of a sudden, he remembered his mother: `O holy
mother! Oh Madonna! Mother, I forgot, excuse me! Here, here's a
drop for you, too; drink a bit yourself.'
<p>
   `No, no thank you, my son, thanks all the same, but I can't
drink, I'm not used to wine. It makes my head spin and afterwards I
start saying silly things.'
<p>
   `But no, mother, it can't do you any harm. It will only make you
a bit happy. This wine can't do you any harm; it's a good wine, a
pure wine ... I made it myself.' ''
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Excerpts from Fo's 1970 play ``The Death of an Anarchist.''
<p>
   The play was inspired by a real incident: the death of a suspect
in a political bombing who plunged to his death from a fourth-story
window while being interrogated by police. In the play, a madman
masquerading as an investigating judge questions police about the
incident.
    &QL; 
<p>
   MANIAC: Not at all, I really believe that you treat your
suspects `jokingly,' as you say ... I remember, I was in Bergamo at
the time when they were interrogating members of the so-called
`Monday Gang'  &MD;  you remember?  &MD;  there was even a priest involved,
and a doctor, and the man who ran the pharmacy ... virtually the
entire village was put on trial ... Well, I was staying in a little
hotel right near the police station where the interrogations were
taking place, and just about every night I was woken up by shouting
and screaming. At first I thought it was the sound of people being
beaten up ... but then I realized they were LAUGHING. Yes  &MD;  the
suspects were laughing: `Ha, ha, oh Jesus. Stop it, ha, ha! Help,
you're too much! Inspector stop it or I'll die laughing.
<p>
   SUPERINTENDENT: Joking apart, you do of course know that every
one of the officers involved, from the chief inspector to the
lowest constable, all went to prison for that?
<p>
   MANIAC: Yes. For comical behavior liable to cause a breach of
the peace, wasn't it? No, no, I'm being serious. You have no idea
how many completely innocent parties move heaven and earth just to
get themselves arrested and brought to this station! You think
they're anarchists, communists, autonomists, trade unionists ...
No, the truth is they're just poor, sick manic depressives,
hypochondriacs, gloomy people, who disguise themselves as
revolutionaries just so they can be interrogated by you...and
finally have a damn good laugh! Get a bit of enjoyment, for once in
their lives!

<TEXT>
<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Maurice Papon, the former French Cabinet
minister on trial for crimes against humanity, suffered an angina
attack Thursday, as the court considered whether he should stay in
a hospital or prison during the trial.
<p>
   Papon, 87, is charged with signing the arrest orders that sent
1,690 Jews, including 223 children, from Bordeaux to Nazi
extermination camps.
<p>
   The court is to rule Friday on Papon's request to be freed for
the duration of the trial, which is expected to last three months.
On Wednesday, the opening day of the trial, Papon told the court he
lacks the physical and mental stamina to remain jailed during the
proceedings.
<p>
   A court-appointed panel of doctors recommended Thursday that
Papon be held in a hospital under guard, not in a prison, to
minimize risks to his health. Papon underwent triple bypass surgery
last year and takes heart medicine.
<p>
   Shortly after a late afternoon break in the proceedings, he
suffered a minor angina attack, his lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut, said.
He returned to the courtroom after a doctor administered Trinitine,
a spray given to relieve angina symptoms.
<p>
   The doctors' report said detention is not incompatible with
Papon's state of health, but ``given his heart conditions, the
risks would be reduced if he were placed under surveillance in a
cardiology unit.''
<p>
   Varaut pleaded for his release, saying detention might be fatal
and claiming that Papon was being detained in ``inhumane
conditions'' at the Gradignan prison outside Bordeaux.
<p>
   Lawyers representing the families of several hundred victims,
Holocaust survivors, and Jewish groups oppose Papon's request.
<p>
   ``I can't stand the idea of Papon going to a five-star hotel
every night after the hearings,'' said Therese Stopnicki, who
escaped the police roundup that captured her young sisters.
<p>
   ``It's his way of thumbing his nose at us, of literally going
free, after all we've gone through to bring him to trial,'' she
said.
<p>
   Papon returned to the stuffy court room about 30 minutes after
the angina attack to hear the presiding judge read the list of
witnesses scheduled to testify during the trial.
<p>
   A former Cabinet minister in the 1970s, he is the most senior
French official from the collaborationist Vichy regime to stand
trial for his role in the persecution and deportation of Jews.
<p>
   In a tense moment on the stand only minutes before the angina
attack, Papon defiantly refused to acknowledge remorse for the
suffering of Bordeaux's Jews when he was a Vichy police supervisor
in the surrounding Gironde region in southwestern France.
<p>
   Varaut, arguing that the massive coverage of the trial was
slanted and jeopardized Papon's chances for a fair trial, said
France 2 television had censored an interview with Papon to remove
his expression of ``deep pain over Jewish suffering.''
<p>
   When civil party lawyer Gerard Welzer asked Papon to tell the
court what he allegedly said in the interview, Papon refused to do
so.
<p>
   He rose from his seat behind bullet-proof glass and said
defiantly, ``go rummage through the waste baskets at France 2,
which refused to broadcast it.''
<p>
   In the 16 years since evidence surfaced showing his active role
in deporting Jews, Papon has repeatedly denied the charges and
refused to apologize.
<p>
   Some civil parties to the case, including Nazi hunter Serge
Klarsfeld, have said they would drop the suit if Papon expressed
remorse.
<p>
   Earlier, Varaut said the media coverage of the case would keep
Papon from getting a fair trial and asked the court to stop the
proceedings.
<p>
   He also said Papon could not defend himself properly because
most of the witnesses, including his superiors, were dead.
<p>
   The court will rule on his request next week.
<p>
   The trial marks an historic moment for France, and the
long-awaited hearing should shed light on the pro-Nazi Vichy
administration's treatment of Jews during World War II.
<p>
   About 76,000 Jews were deported from France to Nazi death camps,
including 12,000 children. Only some 2,500 survived.
<p>
   After the war, Papon went on to a prominent career in government
 &MD;  as Paris police chief under then-President Charles De Gaulle and
later as budget minister under conservative President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing.
<p>
   He enjoyed protection at the highest levels even after a
newspaper revealed his wartime record in 1981.
<p>
   In 1994, then-President Francois Mitterrand admitted he had
acted to delay proceedings against Papon.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Two Colombian police officers and a
civilian were killed Thursday when a bomb they were trying to
deactivate exploded, authorities said.
<p>
   Police said rebels held up traffic near Buenaventura, the
country's main port on the Pacific coast, and fled after planting
the bomb. The device exploded when officers tried to deactivate it.
<p>
   The blast also injured four people.
<p>
   Authorities blamed Colombia's second biggest rebel group, the
National Liberation Army.
<p>
   Rebels, who say they fight for the poor, often target police and
soldiers with ambushes and dynamite attacks. But many Colombians
regard them as bandits without ideology.
<p>
   The insurgents have killed at least 26 candidates for
mayoralties and town councils in a bid to undermine the legitimacy
of the government prior to nationwide municipal elections on Oct.
26.

`Dead Dianas' band banned in Britain

<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  A band called ``Dead Dianas'' has been turned away
from the town hall in Lancaster.
<p>
   ``The city council hopes that no other venue will allow this
group to appear whilst using this offensive material,'' Lancaster
City Council leader Stanley Henig said Thursday.
<p>
   ``They are obviously a bunch of talentless creeps who just want
publicity for themselves,'' added the local member of Parliament,
Hilton Dawson.
<p>
   The group had put up posters in Lancaster which showed a
photograph of the auto crash which killed Diana, boyfriend Dodi
Fayed and their driver.
<p>
   The band's drummer, John Constantine, said the group aimed to
attack the public reaction to Diana's death.
<p>
   ``Dead Dianas was formed in direct response to the way the
government and the press reacted after the death of Diana. They are
the people who are in bad taste, not us,'' he said.
<p>
   ``There is a famous punk band called the Dead Kennedys and no
one is upset about them,'' Constantine added.

helicopter was seriously damaged when it came under rifle fire
shortly after take off Wednesday in southwestern Georgia, near the
border with Turkey.
<p>
   In another incident, border guards in neighboring Armenia came
under automatic weapons fire from Turkish territory, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported Thursday. No casualties were reported. It was
unclear when the shooting took place.
<p>
   Russia's Federal Border Service dispatched a task force to
western Georgia Thursday to investigate the attack on the
helicopter, ITAR-Tass said.
<p>
   The service's deputy commander, Lt. Gen. Alexander Manilov,
blamed the attack on a ``lack of discipline'' among Turkish border
guards, the Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   Omer Buyukkent, the governor for Artvin, the Turkish province
bordering Georgia, told the Anatolia news agency Thursday that the
helicopter violated the border twice under bad weather conditions.
<p>
   ``It is possible that villagers may have fired shots as a
warning. But what is certain is that our military units were not
involved,'' Buyukkent said.
<p>
   Earlier, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said the
shooting never happened. ``We have made our own investigation,''
Akbel told The Associated Press.
<p>
   Regional commander of Russian border guards, Gen. Mikhail
Krylovsky, denied that the helicopter crossed the Georgian-Turkish
border. He spoke at a news conference reported by Interfax.
<p>
   Border guards said the helicopter was hit eight times, including
twice in the fuel tank. Krylovsky said a doctor was slightly
injured.
<p>
   The helicopter had flown down from the Russian city of Adler to
evacuate a sick border guard from a post in Batumi, a Black Sea
port in southwestern Georgia, the border guards said.
<p>
   Russian troops help guard the borders in Georgia, a former
Soviet republic. Russian peacekeepers also are deployed in the
separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia.

Nazi collaborator quits Canada before deportation
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OTTAWA (AP)  &MD;  A convicted Nazi collaborator from Hungary has
left Canada in advance of deportation proceedings, a government
official said Thursday.
<p>
   Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary, 82, is believed to be living in
Europe, said Paul Vickery, head of the war-crimes unit at the
Justice Department.
<p>
   Federal officials learned last week that he had left Canada when
they went to serve him notice of a deportation hearing at his
Toronto home.
<p>
   Csizsik-Csatary's citizenship was revoked in August by the
federal Cabinet. The former Hungarian policeman, accused of helping
deport thousands of Jews to concentration camps in 1944, decided
not to fight the government's efforts.
<p>
   His exact whereabouts are not known, but Vickery said Canada
would seek to learn where he is and then take steps to ensure he
never returns.
<p>
   Csizsik-Csatary was convicted in absentia for war crimes in
Hungary in 1948 and sentenced to death. He arrived in Nova Scotia
the following year, became a Canadian citizen in 1955 and worked as
an art dealer in Montreal.
<p>
   His deportation order was based on his obtaining citizenship
through ``false representation or fraud or knowingly concealing
material circumstances.''
<p>
   It is only the second time a suspected Nazi collaborator has
been stripped of his Canadian citizenship, following the 1992
deportation of Jacob Luitjens to Holland.
<p>
   Nine other war crimes cases are currently backed up in the
Federal Court. Two other individuals died before their cases could
be heard.

Protestant leader says U.S. terror list is leverage over IRA
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BLACKPOOL, England (AP)  &MD;  The leader of Northern Ireland's
largest pro-British Protestant party said Thursday that omitting
the IRA from a U.S. list of terrorist organizations gives the
Clinton administration leverage.
<p>
   ``The administration told us they would be using the threat of
this list as a Sword of Damocles over Sinn Fein/IRA,'' Ulster
Unionist Party leader David Trimble told the AP.
<p>
   Trimble came to this north England town, where Britain's
opposition Conservative Party is holding its annual conference,
after meeting President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger in Washington.
<p>
   The Ulster Unionists and the Catholic-based Irish Republican
Army's political ally, Sinn Fein, are among eight parties at
negotiations to try to find agreement on the political future of
British-ruled Northern Ireland.
<p>
   Sinn Fein was allowed to join the talks after the IRA declared a
cease-fire in July, its second since 1994.
<p>
   On Wednesday, the State Department, citing the cease-fire, left
the IRA off a list of 30 terrorist groups, including 13 Islamic
organizations. The proscribed groups are forbidden to raise funds
in the United States and their assets will be blocked.
<p>
   ``We were told they (the United States) would be saying publicly
and privately to Sinn Fein-IRA there must be no return to violence,
and if there is a number of consequences will follow,'' said
Trimble.
<p>
   ``If  &MD;  and I say if  &MD;  they are speaking to Sinn Fein in the
languages they used to us, then that would be fine ... it can give
them some leverage,'' he added. ``At least the administration are
saying to us that there will be no third bite at the apple for Sinn
Fein/IRA, and I haven't heard the British government say that.''
<p>
   Earlier, at a meeting on Northern Ireland outside the main
conference center, the Conservatives urged Prime Minister Tony
Blair to guard against shaking hands with Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams during the talks.
<p>
   ``Any such republican stunt, I believe, would be somewhat
premature until Sinn Fein-IRA have earned democratic credentials,''
Andrew Mackay, Conservative spokesman on Northern Ireland, told the
meeting. ``Remember how embarrassed President Clinton was.''
<p>
   Clinton shook hands with Adams shortly before the IRA broke a
17-month cease-fire with a London bombing.
<p>
   Mackay said the Conservatives may oppose Blair's plan to scrap a
law  &MD;  not used since 1975  &MD;  permitting imprisonment without trial
in Northern Ireland.
<p>
   Traditionally, Britain's two major parties have a bipartisan
policy on Northern Ireland.

UN to improve water sources in sub-Saharan Africa
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The World Bank and UNICEF agreed Thursday
to work together to help sub-Saharan African countries promote
access to safe water, environmental sanitation and hygiene
education for the poor.
<p>
   A memorandum of understanding between the two agencies was
signed in Washington, UNICEF said in a statement released here.
<p>
   Primary areas of collaboration will be in the development and
implementation of water, environmental sanitation and hygiene
education programs in villages, small towns and poor urban
neighborhoods.
<p>
   UNICEF estimates that more than 250 million people  &MD;  half of
Africa's entire population  &MD;  are without access to safe drinking
water and nearly 300 million lack proper sanitation.
<p>
   The problem will become more acute in the coming decades because
of population increases and water shortages, UNICEF said.

Bardot convicted of inciting racial hatred
Eds: LEADS throughout to CORRECT that ruling was from appellate
court. No pickup.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  A French appeals court on Thursday fined Brigitte
Bardot 10,000 francs (dlrs 1,600) for inciting racial hatred and
ordered her to pay a symbolic franc (16 cents) to the human rights
groups that sued her.
<p>
   The court overturned an earlier ruling in favor of the
63-year-old former screen siren and animal rights campaigner, who
had harshly criticized the Muslim ritual slaughter of sheep.
<p>
   Bardot had been sued by anti-racism groups for her commentary in
the conservative daily Le Figaro in April 1996, in which she
blasted the four-day Eid al-Adha spring festival.
<p>
   Married to a member of the anti-immigrant National Front, she
complained of ``foreign overpopulation'' and that the sheep
slaughter was ``torture, signs of the most atrocious pagan
sacrifices.''
<p>
   The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship of People said
the court ruling ``honors justice and dishonors the woman who was
the symbol of a certain image of France.''
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from Miss Bardot or from her
animal rights group, the Bardot Foundation.
<p>
   Under French law, anti-racism civil suits can be joined by
criminal prosecution, but Bardot avoided a possible sentence of one
year in prison and the maximum fine of 300,000 francs (dlrs
60,000).
<p>
   Unrepentant, Bardot last April wrote another commentary saying
the Eid al-Adha ritual will ``bathe France's earth in blood'' and
she criticized what she said was the transformation of the country
into ``a Muslim France.''
<p>
   Bardot's animal rights foundation calls for ritual slaughter to
take place in state-supervised slaughterhouses and for the animals
to be stunned before being killed.
<p>
   On Eid al-Adha, the celebration following the Islamic fast of
Ramadan, many of France's 3 million Muslims sacrifice a lamb in a
rite of peace, as God allowed Abraham to do instead of killing his
own son.

BC-Editorial Roundup, Two Takes,0867
By The Associated Press
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   The Irish Times, Dublin, on Northern Ireland peace talks:
<p>
   There have been predictable displays of ritual dancing as the
Stormont talks process approaches the point of serious business.
... Two traditions with virtually irreconcilable political cultures
are setting out to engage with each other. Two bloodlines,
representing ancient peoples with centuries of enmity between them,
are seeking to forge new arrangements by which they can live in
peace within the one stretch of land. It should not be surprising
that leaders on both sides should use opportunities over recent
days to reiterate historic claims and ambitions. ...
<p>
   But the bedrock issue will be represented as sovereignty. Whose
writ runs in Northern Ireland? Unionists say they cannot compromise
on the issue. Republicans say they cannot accept a solution which
is grounded in the status quo. ...
<p>
   When unionists say they will never compromise on the Union and
when republicans say they will not live within it, they might do
well to reflect that the present reality is not what either side
claims it to be. The North is unique  &MD;  sui generis. And unique
arrangements will have to be found to give it lasting peace.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Frankfurter Rundschau, on Serbian politics:
<p>
   How is a country to develop a halfway functioning democracy with
a political culture that can only be described with the language of
pathology or from a Shakespeare drama, and in which even the
opposition is teeming with nationalists but lacking patriots?
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on the appointment of an
East German coach accused of doping athletes with steroids:
<p>
   Dr. Ekkart Arbeit, the East German athletics head coach
(1989-90) and head coach of throwing events (1982-88), is due to
take up his appointment as the head coach of Athletics Australia on
Oct. 20. The appointment should be canceled. ...
<p>
   The Sydney Olympics is intended to be ``the athletes'
Olympics.'' What sort of message are Australian Athletics officials
sending to the rest of the world with the appointment of a coach
who was deeply involved with an East German athletics regime that
was driven by illegal drug use? ...
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on Japan's proposal on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions:
<p>
   It should be noted that the Japanese government's goal of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent represents a loosely
defined target. The flexibility of Japan's proposal would allow
other nations to achieve smaller reductions.
<p>
   These flexible measures would make sense if they were
implemented under a double-digit reduction goal. However, the 5
percent goal would allow each nation to get by with nearly no
carbon dioxide reductions if the goal was coupled with those
flexible mechanisms.
<p>
   The international community must cut its carbon dioxide
emissions to half of today's levels. No one in the world disagrees
that the struggle for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions cannot wait
anymore.
<p>
   Can Japan lead the Kyoto conference to look into the Earth's
future? To live up to its duty as the meeting's host, the
government must step up diplomatic efforts to help the
international community reach a consensus regarding how to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Clarin of Buenos Aires, on the Roman Catholic Church in France:
<p>
   In a gesture which goes way beyond its symbolic nature, the
Roman Catholic Church has publicly held up its hands and admitted
to grave errors in the past in France.
<p>
   The apology was resounding, the Church admitting that it did
nothing to prevent the deportation of Jews during the Nazi
occupation.
<p>
   Such an admission has helped close a long chapter in history
during which serious expressions of intolerance were often taken
for a defense of religious dogma.
<p>
   The Pope has been the engine behind this new ecclesiastical
analysis of the past with a view towards the year 2000.
<p>
   The world has been scarred by conflicts, extremism and religious
fundamentalism since the end of World War II. But a new
international awareness of certain universal values is now
beginning to emerge.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Der Bund, Bern, Switzerland, on the single European currency: &QL; 
<p>
   European heads of state and government are playing with fire:
the start date for European Monetary Union is only a few months
away ... but many basic questions remain unanswered.
<p>
   In these circumstances, the economy can prepare itself only
insufficiently  &MD;  if at all  &MD;  for this historic step; important
foundations are missing. This is dangerous.
<p>
   The new Target currency exchange system is due to be launched
Jan. 1, 1999  &MD;  a cornerstone of the Euro ... insiders fear the
system will not be ready to start on time. The rule of thumb is
simple  &MD;  no Target, no Euro.
<p>
   Delaying monetary union on ``technical grounds'' would damage
the prestige of a European financial area still in its infancy.
<p>
   The bottom line is that the Euro is built on weak foundations,
and its ambitious timetable hides risks.

Top Croat hardliner resigns
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)  &MD;  A hard-line nationalist widely seen as a
barrier to reconciliation with Serbs resigned his government post
in eastern Croatia on Thursday in what appeared to be a move to
appease the United States and its allies.
<p>
   The resignation of Branimir Glavas, a prominent Croat
nationalist since the 1991 war with Serbs, came as a surprise. It
followed the surrender on Monday of 10 Bosnian Croat suspects to
the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
<p>
   Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who has influence among
Bosnian Croats, had been under extreme pressure from the United
States to make the war crimes suspects surrender.
<p>
   The United States has warned Croatia that it stands no chance of
joining Western institutions without obeying the Dayton peace
agreement for Bosnia, which requires it to hand over war crimes
suspects, and improving its human rights record.
<p>
   Besides the surrender of the 10 war crimes suspects, several
hard-line Bosnian Croat nationalists also were removed from their
posts on Monday.
<p>
   It was not exactly clear why Glavas quit as prefect of Eastern
Slavonia, Croatia's last bit of Serb-held territory.
<p>
   However, he was thought to be an obstacle to reintegration of
Serbs still living in eastern Croatia, and he also may have been
targeted in a drive by Tudjman to root out corruption.
<p>
   Tudjman's government also has been regularly criticized for
allowing a small group of officials and their families to profit
from their positions.
<p>
   In an open letter to Tudjman carried by the state news agency
HINA, Glavas said his voluntary resignation was `` a moral act,
prompted by feelings of personal accountability.''
<p>
   He said he hoped his resignation would ``be an example, and
impel other government officials to do the same in the interests of
consolidating faith of all Croat citizens in their nation.''
<p>
   He did not elaborate.
<p>
   Glavas was in charge of coordinating the defenses of eastern
Croatia in the 1991 war, and was known for his extreme anti-Serb
attitude.
<p>
   Eastern Slavonia is administered by the United Nations under a
1995 agreement. The mandate expires early next year.
<p>
   Two men regarded as having strong democratic credentials
recently were given prominent positions in the state-run media.
<p>
   Mirko Galic, an ethnic Serb, was named to the governing board of
Croatian radio and TV. Branko Salaj, a diplomat who previously had
lived in Sweden for decades, became chief of HINA.

Swiss prosecutor heads to Spain to question two robbery suspects
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  Swiss district attorney Rolf Jaeger
left for Spain on Thursday to question two suspects arrested in
connection to one of the world's biggest robberies.
<p>
   Jaeger, the chief investigator, said he would also try to speed
up extradition procedures.
<p>
   One suspect, a 21-year-old Swiss man, was arrested in Alicante
Sept. 22, while the other, a 20-year-old Yugoslav, was caught in
Malaga five days later.
<p>
   Upon their arrest, both men were in possession of more than one
million Swiss francs (dlrs 689,000), only a slice of some 53
million Swiss francs (dlrs 37 million) stolen during the hold up of
a Zurich post office Sept. 1.
<p>
   Before his return next Tuesday, Jaeger said he would also
request the money be handed over to the Swiss government.
<p>
   The Zurich prosecutor's office believes the Swiss suspect is one
of the five armed men who attacked the post office.
<p>
   The robbers posed as postal workers, using phony identification
papers and a delivery van with stolen post office license plates,
to pass a security gate. They held postal workers at bay with guns
and stuffed the van with containers of cash from a loading dock,
then drove off. No physical force was used and no one was hurt.
<p>
   Presently, 18 people are being held in connection with the
heist: 14 in Switzerland two in Italy and two in Spain. Among them
are three of the five armed robbers.
<p>
   Investigators have recovered less than half of the stolen money:
27.5 million francs (dlrs 18.96 million).
<p>
   An international arrest mandate has been launched against Hassab
El-Bast of Lebanon and Italian Domenico Silano, believed to have
led the operation.

<TEXT>
<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Launching major changes in
France's Africa policies, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on
Thursday called South Africa the focus of its new direction.
<p>
   Despite a diplomatic flap between the two countries earlier this
year, Vedrine said South Africa was a key ally on the continent and
in the rest of the world
<p>
   ``We look upon South Africa as an essential partner in Africa
and elsewhere,'' he told the Parliament foreign affairs committee,
speaking in French through an interpreter.
<p>
   Vedrine said France did not consider African nations as ``pawns
in the big chess games of diplomacy, but as fully fledged
partners.''
<p>
   He added that future defense agreements in Africa would
concentrate on training, especially peace-keeping, a shift from
France's previous role as an interventionist and protector.
<p>
   Vedrine and South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
signed agreements strengthening ties between the two countries,
including a memorandum to ensure South Africa and France conduct
regular, close political talks on diplomatic issues.
<p>
   Until the 1960s, France controlled about a third of the African
continent. After decolonization, its military and political
presence dictated the balance of power in many nations.
<p>
   But the recent behavior of some of its African allies has been a
source of embarrassment.
<p>
   In May, anti-government rebels swept the former Zaire and forced
longtime French ally President Mobutu Sese Seko to flee.
<p>
   France was the only nation to back Mobutu, who has since died in
exile, to the very end. South Africa, which cooperated with the
United States in developing policies sympathetic to rebel leader
Laurent Kabila, criticized the French for its stance; French
officials complained of burgeoning U.S. influence on the continent.
<p>
   Both Vedrine and Nzo stressed Thursday there was little real
disagreement between them on the matter of Kabila's newly renamed
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
<p>
   Vedrine said the Congo situation had been discussed and points
of view constructively exchanged.
<p>
   ``Our approaches were not antagonistic,'' Nzo agreed.
<p>
   Also in May, French influence in the Republic of Congo, which
borders Kabila's Congo, was not enough to prevent fighting prompted
in part by the distribution of oil revenues harvested by French
companies.
<p>
   France has traditionally been most active in her former African
colonies in West Africa. But post-apartheid South Africa, the
dominant nation of southern Africa, would provide a powerful and
useful ally for France under its revised strategy.
<p>
   ``The future of that relationship is not only consolidated, but
improves all the time,'' Nzo said.
<p>
   The one-day visit is part of Vedrine's first official trip to
Africa since France elected a socialist government in June, and
marked the first visit of any French foreign minister since South
Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.
<p>
   He also plans stops in Ethiopia, Gabon and Ivory Coast, where he
will brief other governments on the new policy.
<p>
   Instead of direct political and military interference in its
former colonies, France says it will focus on economic ties and
development across the whole of Africa and encourage multilateral
solutions to African problems.
<p>
   The policy change was announced in August by President Jacques
Chirac. About the same time, the French government announced plans
to cut its troops in Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and shut one of its
six military bases on the continent.
<p>
   Nzo and Vedrine also signed an agreement pledging 17 million
French francs (dlrs 2.9 million) for South Africa's education
system.

Hamas leaders vow to continue fighting Israel
Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Hamas rally in Gaza, CHANGES
byline, overline.
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)  &MD;  Hamas leaders gathered in Gaza
vowed Thursday to continue fighting Israel despite earlier
conciliatory statements made by their religious leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin.
<p>
   ``Hamas will continue to terrorize all the enemies of God and we
will continue in our Jihad and resistance,'' said Hamas political
leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who was released from Israeli prison
earlier this year.
<p>
   The leaders gathered in a Gaza soccer stadium as part of a
weeklong celebration of Yassin's return. He was freed as part of
swap in which Jordan released two Israeli agents involved in the
failed assassination of another Hamas leader.
<p>
   Yassin received a phone call onstage from Hamas' strategist
Khaled Mashaal, who was the target of the assassination attempt.
<p>
   His voice amplified by speakers, Mashaal said he was honored to
have helped free Yassin: ``It would have been my greatest pleasure
to die for this cause.''
<p>
   Yassin told the 1,000-strong audience that Hamas would not
negotiate with Israel. ``There is no connection between Hamas and
Israel and, God willing, there will never be,'' the cleric said.
<p>
   Such statements appeared to contradict Yassin's tentative truce
offer earlier in the week, when the nearly blind quadriplegic
suggested Hamas would cease attacks against Israeli civilians if
Israel stops ``attacks against our civilians.''
<p>
   It was not clear what Yassin meant, and Israel's response was
cautious. But the statement fed speculation that Yassin's presence
in Gaza might rein in more radical group members.
<p>
   Khalil Shikaki, a leading Palestinian analyst, told The
Associated Press that Yassin would affect a ``modest change in
Hamas: Hamas would cease attacks on Israeli civilians but not stop
violence completely''  &MD;  meaning that military targets would still
be legitimate.
<p>
   The crisis over Mashaal and the release of Yassin  &MD;  which posed
challenges to both Israeli and Palestinian Authority leaders  &MD;  was
seen as a reason for Wednesday's summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
their first meeting in eight crisis-ridden months.
<p>
   After the meeting there were signs of positive movement between
the two sides.
<p>
   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said after meeting
Israeli Finance Ministry director Shmuel Slavin that he was told
Israel would release the tax revenues it has been withholding to
force Arafat to crack down on Hamas in the wake of two suicide
bombings by the group in Jerusalem that killed 26.
<p>
   Israeli officials said the money  &MD;  estimated at about 170
million shekels (dlrs 49 million)  &MD;  could be handed over to the
Palestinians next week if remaining details were worked out.
<p>
   The Oslo peace agreement obligates Israel to hand over customs
duties and other taxes levied on Palestinian imports and purchases.
Part of the funds were released under heavy pressure from the
United States.
<p>
   A Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity that
Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and the speaker of the Palestinian
legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, are negotiating the question of
Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank.
<p>
   The withdrawals were promised by Israel in peace accords, but
Netanyahu suspended further pullbacks after the suicide bombings.
<p>
   Israel Radio said Israel also is prepared to discuss a temporary
suspension of a Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem in return
for Palestinian acquiescence in the expansion of Jewish settlements
in the West Bank.

<p>
   The Straits Times, Singapore, on the currency crisis in Asia:
<p>
   The crisis that began with the problems of the Thai baht has
enveloped several other Southeast Asian economies, notably
Malaysia's. The state of its stock and currency markets has
regional implications as well.
<p>
   Thus, referring to the peso's plight, a foreign exchange trader
in the Philippines blames it on `the Mahathir scare,' or the
Malaysian prime minister's call to regulate currency trading. ...
<p>
   Whatever the precise extent to which the Malaysian leader's
comments are indeed responsible, it is undeniable that the economic
problems of his country do not stop at its borders.
<p>
   What Southeast Asia is facing, in differing degrees, though in
an interrelated manner, is an issues which must not be allowed to
grow into a sustained crisis of confidence. ...
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   The Jordan Times, Amman, on Netanyahu:
<p>
   Less than two years after he was voted into office primarily on
the promise of providing the Israeli people with peace and
security, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has put
his people at risk of losing both.
<p>
   His reckless shortsighted policies are threatening the collapse
of the very delicate peacemaking process that was carefully
nurtured over the last five years.
<p>
   Netanyahu is, obviously, a leader with no vision other than that
of realizing short-term gains which begin and end with television
in sound bites and newspapers headlines. What he has miserably
failed to understand is that peace is the only option for everybody
in this region, that bringing such a peace needs clear strategies
not theatrical performances.
<p>
   The botched assassination attempt against Khalid Mashaal,
chairman of Hamas politburo, is the latest in a series of ill
conceived and stupid decisions the prime minister has made.
Netanyahu has violated a sacred code of conduct by authorizing the
assassination attempt in Jordan.
<p>
   What Netanyahu did was try to export terrorism to a friendly
country, jeopardize the aspirations of his people for a peaceful
life and show the world that he could not be trusted with the fate
of the peace process. It is now to the Israeli people and the
international community to prevent Netanyahu from denying the
Middle East the peace for which it has long yearned.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   The Post and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina, on the release
of the Hamas founder:
<p>
   If Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been released from jail
by Yasser Arafat, the Israeli government and its supporters would
be calling for the Palestinian leader's head on a plate. But the
spiritual leader of Hamas, a terrorist organization that celebrates
when its suicide bombers kill innocent civilians, has been released
by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to baffled silence.
<p>
   According to the brief Israeli Army communique issued in the
middle of the night as Sheik Yassin was flown to Amman, the Hamas
leader, who is a paraplegic and is in extremely poor health, was
released by Netanyahu ``in response to an appeal by King Hussein of
Jordan and to take positive steps to help the peace process.''
<p>
   Both Israel Radio and Israel TV, which belong to the state, have
reported that Sheik Yassin was let out of jail, after serving eight
years of a life sentence, to mollify King Hussein for a botched
assassination attempt on another Hamas leader carried out by Mossad
agents in Jordan. ...
<p>
   Under the circumstances it is hard to see how the release of
Sheik Yassin could possibly help the peace process. There is no
indication of any change in the commitment of Hamas to terrorism,
including suicide bombings, and Arafat has not responded
positively. He flew to Amman to see King Hussein to try and find
out what has been going on. It is more likely this convoluted
episode could prove to be one misstep too many by Netanyahu.
    &UR;  &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   Alamogordo Daily News, Alamogordo, New Mexico, on state of U.S.
military: &QL; 
<p>
   Post-Vietnam defense cuts and neglect produced the notoriously
hollow U.S. military of the late 1970s. ...
<p>
   Ominously, similar cracks are beginning to appear in the
Clinton-era military. ...
<p>
   Privately, Navy officers ... complain of budget-driven
reductions in training and munitions.
<p>
   The Air Force, too, is increasingly beset with pilot shortages.
Some Air Force fighter squadrons are cannibalizing planes to spare
parts to keep others flying.
<p>
   The Army, reduced in size form 750,000 to 495,000 and from 18
divisions to 12 in recent years, is nonetheless having trouble
keeping its remaining units combat ready. ...
<p>
   Obviously, a reduction in defense spending and a drawdown in the
military was warranted after the Cold War ended. But the Bush and
Clinton administrations promised that a smaller military would be
kept fully trained, equipped and combat ready. This promise isn't
being kept. ...

Tajik president orders release of first group of opposition
fighters
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  In a step toward reconciliation in Tajikistan,
President Emomali Rakhnonov has ordered the release of a some
opposition members who fought in the country's civil war, a Russian
news report said Thursday.
<p>
   The order would start to fulfill an amnesty to all fighters
granted by the Tajik parliament in August. The first 170 of some
700 jailed opposition members are to be released before Sunday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
<p>
   Rakhmnonov ordered the release after meeting Wednesday with
opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri, the report said.
<p>
   They also discussed plans for the return of opposition fighters
based in Afghanistan and of Tajik refugees fleeing camps in
northern Afghanistan, where battles have been raging recently.
<p>
   Rakhmonov's order marks a new step toward reconciliation in this
former Soviet republic in Central Asia. His hard-line government
signed a peace deal in June with the main opposition groups,
formally concluding a war that broke out shortly after independence
in 1991.
<p>
   The fighting has stopped and the two sides have been moving
haltingly toward reconciliation, although many issues remain
unresolved.
<p>
   A national reconciliation commission, which includes members
from both sides of the conflict, has begin meeting in the Tajik
capital, Dushanbe.
<p>
   Religious, ethnic and regional rivalries were all factors in the
Tajik conflict, which resulted in an estimated 50,000 deaths.

   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded Mexico's
southwestern Pacific coast Thursday with 160 kph (100 mph) winds
and torrential rains, creating fast-churning rivers of mud, water
and debris that raced down the main streets of Acapulco. Dozens of
people were reported killed or missing.
<p>
   Many of them were caught in muddy torrents that swept hundreds
of cars, huge tree trunks and tons of mud down the mountains behind
Acapulco toward the sea. The once-glittering resort, a city of 2.9
million, was turned into a disaster zone, with hundreds of homes
wrecked by floods.
<p>
   Tourists huddled in darkened hotels and hundreds of locals
sought refuge in emergency shelters. Ropes were strung across
downtown intersections to help people across torrents of roaring
water. The bodies of at least five people were seen floating away
in the powerful currents.
<p>
   Towering waves carved up most of the city's once-pristine
beaches. Boulders the size of cars were swept down the hills and
cars were flipped over like scattered toys, some with their lights
still on, their doors underwater. A coastal highway skirting the
famed beaches became a raging river, where one man's body lay
face-up in mud.
<p>
   Elilasio Garcia, 22, said he and other residents of an apartment
building fled during the night as Pauline roared past. ``We left
when we felt the building tremble beaus of the rocks the river was
throwing at the foundation,'' he said.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was extended Thursday morning hundreds of
kilometers (miles) up the coast, from Acapulco to Puerto Vallarta,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shore, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
<p>
   The storm began raking Acapulco before dawn Thursday as it moved
northward up the coast toward the beach resorts of Zihuatanejo,
Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta. At 1800 GMT, Pauline was near
Zihuatanejo, Mexico, and moving west-northwest up the coast at 24
kph (15 mph), the hurricane center said.
<p>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to Germany, ordered
military and civil defense workers into the hard-hit states of
Oaxaca and Chiapas, the official Notimex news agency reported.
Telephone communication to much of the coast was cut after Pauline
began pummeling the shore late Wednesday.
<p>
   Reports gave widely varying numbers of dead and missing.
<p>
   Notimex said at least 15 people were killed. Jaime Hernandez,
who lives in the hills near Acapulco, said police took away at
least seven bodies after mud and water came rushing down the hills.
<p>
   Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio Santiago, reached by telephone
in Acapulco, said the relief agency counted five dead but at least
50 people were reported missing. ``We've got rain coming down,
mudslides blocking roads. Houses have fallen, walls are down,'' he
said.
<p>
   Authorities had no immediate injury reports from Acapulco and
the surrounding state of Guerrero, but Red Cross and civil defense
officials in neighboring Oaxaca said at least 46 people were
injured there.
<p>
   In Puerto Angel, where Pauline first rumbled ashore on
Wednesday, many houses that weren't made of concrete were washed
away, said Federico Velazquez, a federal highway police official in
radio contact with that city.
<p>
   Overnight, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and fishing villages
near Huatulco, churning up 10-meter (30-foot) seas with 185 kph
(115 mph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and ruined
residences. The violent winds and rains turned streets into rivers,
ripped large trees from the ground and sent makeshift homes of
plywood flying.
<p>
   Waves up to 10 meters (30 feet) tall tore away the beachfront of
the Huatulco Sheraton and other bays, leaving tree limbs scattered
everywhere.
<p>
   ``It was very dramatic, something we had never seen here
before,'' said hotel security guard Nicanor Reyes, who was forced
to stay overnight at the hotel because of flooded roads.
<p>
   ``I don't know what the situation is in my house,'' he said,
worrying about his wife and five children.
<p>
   Pauline nearly flattened the poor community of Las Tres Cruces,
next to the Huatulco airport.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' said 32-year old Evaristo Gerardo Mayo,
surveying the humble neighborhood where pots and pans lay scattered
amid broken glass and waterlogged mattresses.
<p>
   U.S. Hurricane Center specialist Lixion Avila said early
Thursday that Pauline's path remained highly unpredictable.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American southwest as a
tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for the desert.
<p>
   Forecasters said El Nino, a phenomenon in which unusually warm
Pacific waters disrupt weather patterns, could be to blame for the
high number of powerful hurricanes this year.

Muster falls victim to Todd Martin
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP)  &MD;  Unseeded Todd Martin of the United States
started and finished strong to bang out a three-set win Thursday
over No. 6 seed Thomas Muster in the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy tennis
tournament.
<p>
   Muster, the Austrian favorite, suffered another setback in a
tough year and joins other seeded players including Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, Sergi Bruguera and Gustavo Kuerten, who will be
watching as the tournament moves into the quarterfinals.
<p>
   The tournament's top remaining player, third seed Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia, beat Chris Woodruff of the United States
6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
<p>
   Martin, ATP's 51st-ranked player, showed improvement as he
continues to come back from an elbow injury that kept him sidelined
for six months.
<p>
   Muster said he started too slowly, and Martin took advantage
while the Austrian was still trying to find his rhythm. In 37
minutes, Martin had the first set in hand, 6-4.
<p>
   Muster gained an early break in the second set and cruised to a
6-3 victory to tie at a set apiece. Muster kept the third set close
until the end, when he needed two many second serves, and Martin
once again took advantage with strong play, closing off the match
with a 6-4 victory.
<p>
   ``I had a good start, and finished very well,'' Martin said. ``I
played my best tennis at 5-4 in the third set.''
<p>
   In other action, Tim Henman of Britain beat Sweden's Jan Apell
6-3, 6-3; Karol Kucera of Slovakia defeated Tommy Haas of Germany
6-1, 6-3; and Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands beat Arnaud
Clement of France 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Five more dead in KwaZulu-Natal

<TEXT>
<p>
   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  Five more people, including a
3-year-old child, have died in continued political fighting in a
troubled region of KwaZulu-Natal province.
<p>
   Provincial police spokesman Henry Budhram said the victims
appeared to be from areas that support the governing African
National Congress.
<p>
   A total of 13 people have died this week in attacks in the
Richmond area of KwaZulu-Natal, where political clashes have
occurred for years between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.
<p>
   The latest killings prompted KwaZulu-Natal premier Ben Ngubane
of Inkatha to ask President Nelson Mandela to declare a state of
emergency in the area.
<p>
   ``We believe the South African National Defense Force should
cordon off the area and conduct house-to-house searches for weapons
and criminals,'' said Richmond mayor Andrew Ragalavoo.
<p>
   Eight people were killed in the Richmond area on Saturday and
Sunday. Six were believed to be ANC supporters, while the other two
victims were believed to support the newly formed United Democratic
Movement.
<p>
   Those attacks occurred in the new party's stronghold, which was
controlled by former ANC strongman Sifiso Nkabinde before his
recent arrest on 18 counts of murder.
<p>
   Violence in Richmond subsided with the arrest of Nkabinde, who
was expelled from the ANC earlier this year for allegedly spying
for the former apartheid government and fomenting violence. But
animosities dating back a decade or more continue to cause sporadic
outbreaks of violence.
<p>
   More than 40 people have died in the region since May, police
said.

Rights group blames Rwandans, Kabila's forces for Congo massacres
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from author of Human Rights Watch report,
TRIMS
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  A report alleging that the Rwandan army
and Laurent Kabila's forces carried out most of the massacres of
civilians in eastern Congo underscores the urgency of a U.N.
investigation into the charges, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the next step is for the United
States to send an envoy to Congo and Rwanda to urge leaders there
to allow the United Nations to carry out an unimpeded investigation
in the Congo.
<p>
   Last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalled four leaders of
a U.N. investigation team from the Congo after differences with the
government stalled the probe. Kabila says any massacres were
carried out by troops loyal to the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,
who was ousted last May.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch/Africa said in a report Wednesday that
Kabila's side bore most of the responsibility for the slaughter.
The report cited the rule of the Tutsi-led Rwandan national army,
which intervened in the rebellion on the side of Kabila.
<p>
   ``From late last year, October, November, when the refugee camps
were attacked in eastern Congo, up until May, there were wide-scale
killings carried out by Kabila's forces and the Rwandan Patriotic
Army,'' Scott Campbell, one of the authors of the report, told
AP-Television on Thursday.
<p>
   ``Often forces that were involved in the massacres were under
the command of Rwandan officers or Rwandan officers were in the
area consistently when massacres were taking place,'' Campbell
said.
<p>
   In the report, Human Rights Watch claimed abuses committed by
Kabila's forces and the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army ``are
remarkably different in their scale, nature and motivation'' from
those carried out by Mobutu's troops and his Rwandan militiamen
allies.
<p>
   ``These killings and the intentional blocking of aid were
apparently both in revenge for the 1994 genocide (in Rwanda)''  &MD; 
and to weaken Hutu militiamen who were fighting alongside Mobutu's
soldiers, the report said.
<p>
   The report did concede, however, that Mobutu's allies also
committed murders, rapes and other abuses during the seven-month
war.
<p>
   ``I think it merely is one more report indicating that there is
a problem there that needs to be documented,'' Eckhard told
reporters. ``It underlines the importance of a United Nations
mission getting underway, and we continue to be hopeful it will
happen.''
<p>
   Campbell, who lived in the area for three years, said ``the most
striking thing we saw was the remains of civilian refugees, Rwandan
refugees, that were in the middle of the road ... These are Rwandan
civilian refugees that had been killed by forces of President
Kabila in Congo and the Rwandan Patriotic Army.''
<p>
   Eckhard said the United Nations hoped a special American envoy,
who has not been publicly named, would be able to break the
impasse.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch also claimed the United States bore some
responsibility for the massacres because Washington knew in advance
that Rwanda planned to intervene in the Congo.
<p>
   After Hutu extremists butchered an estimated half million
Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994, a Tutsi-dominated rebel
army overthrew Rwanda's Hutu government.
<p>
   That sent more than 1 million Rwandan Hutus  &MD;  including armed
militiamen responsible for the genocide  &MD;  streaming into
U.N.-supervised refugee camps in eastern Congo, then known as
Zaire.
<p>
   But the United Nations was powerless to stop armed raids into
Rwanda by Hutus shelters in the camps. That pushed Rwanda to
intervene.
<p>
   The report said the Pentagon signed off as early as August 1995
on Rwanda's plans to clear out the refugee camps in eastern Congo
``provided it was a `clean' operation, meaning one with limited
civilian casualties.''
<p>
   In August 1996, Rwandan Defense Minister Paul Kagame told the
Americans that Rwanda was ready to dismantle the camps if no one
else acted, the report said.
<p>
   The report also alleged that the Rwandan army systematically
separated young men, former Rwandan Hutu government officials and
Hutu intellectuals from among refugees and executed them.

Rwandans bury dead allegedly killed by army in retaliation for
rebel attack
EDS: Updates with army comment, graf 5; U.N. staffers reportedly
pullin staff from Gisenyi, graf 7

<p>
   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP)  &MD;  A day after the Rwandan army and Hutu
rebels clashed for seven hours in some of the worst fighting in
northwestern Rwanda in a year, three people were buried Thursday in
a single grave.
<p>
   But a mourner said the dead woman, her four-year-old child and
her sister were not victims of the fighting.
<p>
   The young man, who would not give his name, said the three Hutus
had been hacked to death with machetes by Tutsi soldiers in
retaliation for the attack mounted by at least 1,000 Hutu rebels.
<p>
   ``They did not live in the same area where the fighting took
place, and they were killed after the fighting had stopped,'' he
said. ``Many people were killed. It's because we are Hutus, and the
army blames us.''
<p>
   Military spokesman Richard Sizibera said he didn't know about
the incident, but pointed out that machetes have been a weapon of
the rebels, not of soldiers.
<p>
   On Wednesday two military officials said 80 Hutu rebels and two
government soldiers had been killed in the fighting.
<p>
   Ten civilians were at the local hospital Thursday with gunshot
wounds.
<p>
   U.N. staffers reportedly have pulled some of their staff out of
Gisenyi.
<p>
   Human rights groups have charged that at least 6,000 people have
been killed in Rwanda since January, mostly civilians killed by the
army in retaliation for rebel attacks.
<p>
   Government soldiers and rebels had fought farther north of
Gisenyi along the Congo-Rwanda border, but Wednesday's attack was
the closest yet to the town.
<p>
   The rebels are former soldiers from the defeated Hutu army and
Interahamwe militia who carried out a Hutu government-orchestrated
massacre of at least half a million minority Tutsis in mid-1994.
Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu government and stopped the
genocide.
<p>
   An estimated 1 million Hutus, including the killers, fled west
to the former Zaire where they remained until last November. The
soldiers and militia used refugee camps as bases from which to
attack Rwanda. Many of the fighters returned with the civilian
refugees and established bases in northwestern Rwanda.
<p>
   Liberette Muragijimana was among 500 Hutus who fled to
neighboring Congo to escape Wednesday's fighting. But officials
turned them back to Rwanda, and they waited in Gisenyi's soccer
stadium Thursday for rides home.
<p>
   Muragijimana fled to the former Zaire 1994 as well, and lost her
husband and a four-year-old child there.
<p>
   She said it was difficult to grab her remaining three-year-old
daughter and run again, but she said she had no choice when the
fighting engulfed her village on Ruvabu Hill that looms over
Gisenyi.
<p>
   Other Hutus fled towards Congo when fighting escalated last
week, but Congolese officials closed the border to avoid a new
influx of refugees.
<p>
   There was life on the streets in Gisenyi town Thursday, but
villages on the surrounding hills were strangely quiet.
<p>
   In the market, where a shell landed Wednesday on a truck but did
not explode, there were few buyers for the clothing, fruit,
vegetables and household items merchants put out for sale.
<p>
   ``It's not like other days, because today a lot of people are
afraid,'' said Muhoza Pascazi, a seller.
<p>
   Barefoot men in tattered, dirty clothing lined up on the soccer
field to show their identity cards to soldiers. But one soldier
said the men were not suspected of being rebels.
<p>
   Across the street at the airport hundreds of soldiers lounging
on the grass along the airstrip watched as several of their
colleagues chased a young man across the tarmac. They beat him with
their rifle butts and dragged him to a small shack from which
smacking sounds could be heard.
<p>
   ``He's Interahamwe,'' muttered an airport official, referring to
the militia that killed Tutsis. ``Otherwise, why would he be
running?''

<p>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  A bomb exploded on a highway in western
Colombia on Thursday, killing two police officers and a civilian
and wounding four others. Authorities blamed leftist guerrillas.
<p>
   Rebels held up traffic near Buenaventura, the country's main
port on the Pacific coast, and fled after planting a bomb on the
road, police said. The device exploded when officers tried to
deactivate it.
<p>
   Colombia's second-biggest rebel group, the National Liberation
Army, was held responsible.
<p>
   The group was also blamed for two bombs that exploded early
Thursday outside the offices of two political candidates in
Barrancabermeja, 175 miles (280 kilometers) north of the capital,
Bogota.
<p>
   The buildings were damaged, but there were no injuries. Two more
bombs left at other campaign offices were deactivated.
<p>
   Insurgents have killed at least 26 candidates for local office
in a bid to undermine the legitimacy of the government before
nationwide municipal elections on Oct. 26.
<p>
   Rebels, who say they fight for the poor, often target police and
soldiers with ambushes and dynamite attacks. But they lack the
military might to threaten the government. Many Colombians regard
them as bandits without ideology.

UN says Sassou-Nguesso signs ceasefire
Eds: UPDATES with unspecified conditions, new details
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The mutinous general whose forces have
been battling troops loyal to the president of the Republic of
Congo signed a U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement Thursday, the
United Nations announced.
<p>
   In the capital of the Republic of Congo, Brazzaville, the radio
station loyal to Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso confirmed he had signed
the agreement, negotiated last month by Gabonese President Omar
Bongo and special U.N. mediator, Mohamed Sahnoun.
<p>
   But Radio Liberty said the general accepted the cease-fire only
after he added unspecified conditions to the document, which his
rival, President Pascal Lissouba signed last month.
<p>
   The official Republic of Congo radio, which Lissouba controls,
said ``we believe that we are moving closer and closer towards
peace with the signature,'' of Sassou-Nguesso.
<p>
   Both stations said no date had been agreed upon yet for the
cease-fire to take effect.
<p>
   The Security Council has refused to approve a U.N. or
U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force for the troubled country until
both sides accepted a workable cease-fire.
<p>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed ``this positive
development'' and called on the international community to ``help
consolidate this cease-fire.''
<p>
   U.N. officials said they were unable to say whether this latest
truce was any more effective than the last, which broke down in
renewed factional fighting. They were also unaware of the
conditions which Sassou-Nguesso imposed.
<p>
   Hundreds of civilians have died in Brazzaville since forces
loyal to Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso went to war June 5, a month
before they were to have faced each other in presidential
elections.
<p>
   Sassou-Nguesso accused Lissouba of provoking the violence so he
would have an excuse to delay the election and hold onto power.

   TRELAWNEY, Zimbabwe (AP)  &MD;  Armed police backed by helicopters
patrolled white-owned farms Thursday after striking farm workers
trashed cars and trucks, tore up crops and destroyed produce.
<p>
   The wives and children of some of the farmers were evacuated
from this lush district 85 kilometers (about 50 miles) northwest of
Harare after three days of violent protests, said the main farmers
organization, the Commercial Farmers' Union.
<p>
   Police said more than 100 protesters were arrested Thursday
after the worst violence in a two-week work stoppage that has
affected farms across the nation.
<p>
   More than 15,000 strikers brought production to a standstill
Tuesday on Trelawney district's 144 registered farms.
<p>
   The strike is the first held nationwide by farm workers in the
nation's history and turned violent after pay negotiations
deadlocked, the CFU said.
<p>
   Farm workers are among the lowest paid employees in Zimbabwe.
The strikers are demanding increases of about 135 percent, up from
360 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 31) a month to 848 Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 75).
<p>
   Farmers have offered raises of about 20 percent.
<p>
   CFU president Nick Swanepoel said his organization sought
government-sponsored arbitration between farmers and the union.
<p>
   ``We believe a reasonable solution can be found through
negotiation. We can't afford these demands. It would cripple
commercial agriculture,'' he told reporters.
<p>
   Cuthbert Hute, a spokesman for the General Agricultural and
Plantation Workers Union, said it called on workers to return to
their jobs Thursday to await a new round of pay negotiations. But
the strike continued with violence in Trelawney.
<p>
   The CFU, which represents some 4,000 farmers, most of them
white, said Trelawney landowners received death threats from the
strikers.
<p>
   Though most of the farmers were armed, there were no shooting
incidents.
<p>
   Tractors were commandeered by strikers to travel from farm to
farm, motorcycles and other equipment were smashed, stores and
barns were robbed and one whitewashed homestead set amid blossoming
gardens was gutted by looters.
<p>
   Warwick Evans, a district official of the CFU, said fuel tanks
were ruptured and chemicals and insecticides were dumped over crops
and into irrigation channels.
<p>
   Strikers also blocked roads and stoned passing cars.
<p>
   ``This is no longer a strike. This is criminal action,'' Evans
said.
<p>
   Trelawney is one of the most productive areas for tobacco and
horticulture, high earning crops in the agriculture-based economy.

Israel says its hands may be tied on extradition

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Israel's attorney general said a Maryland
teen-ager charged in a grisly killing will not be extradited if his
claim to Israeli citizenship is valid, regardless of intense
pressure from the United States.
<p>
   Eliyakim Rubinstein said if the citizenship claim is valid,
Israel would have no choice but to try the teen-ager here.
<p>
   He said Israel was awaiting more documents from the United
States and carefully studying others already in hand before making
a decision in the case of 17-year-old Samuel Sheinbein.
<p>
   Samuel Sheinbein is wanted in connection with the death of
Alfredo Enrique Tello Jr., 19, whose burned and dismembered body
was found Sept. 18 in a suburb of Washington.
<p>
   Sheinbein, of Wheaton, Maryland, flew to Israel days after
Tello's body was discovered and wound up in a psychiatric ward
after a drug overdose. He was arrested at the request of U.S.
authorities.
<p>
   Israel's refusal thus far to hand over Sheinbein has caused an
outcry from the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she
expected ``maximum cooperation'' in the case.
<p>
   U.S. lawmakers this week floated proposals to cut roughly
one-third of Israel's dlrs 3 billion in annual U.S. aid if
Sheinbein is not returned to Maryland for trial.
<p>
   The extradition request turns on whether Sheinbein has Israeli
citizenship passed on to him by his Israeli father, who left Israel
at age 6. Under Israeli law, a person born outside Israel
automatically becomes an Israeli citizen from birth when at least
one of the parents is an Israeli citizen.
<p>
   If Sheinbein's father's citizenship  &MD;  and thus his  &MD;  is found to
be valid, the youth cannot be extradited unless he waives his right
to stay in Israel. His lawyer has said Sheinbein wants to stay.
<p>
   On Wednesday, a court ordered that Sheinbein be held for 10 more
days while Israel weighs the extradition request.
<p>
   Rubinstein said U.S. authorities had urged Israel to take time
to thoroughly investigate the matter, and that officials were
working ``night and day'' on the case.
<p>
   The key documents date from the early 1950s when the elder
Sheinbein left for the United States, officials said. Also being
investigated is whether Sheinbein's grandmother attempted at one
point to renounce her Israeli citizenship, Rubinstein said.
<p>
   ``We are not leaving any stone unturned in order to find a
solution,'' he said.
<p>
   But the attorney general appeared to be trying to prepare the
U.S. public and government officials for the possibility that
Israel might be forced to try Sheinbein here.
<p>
   He stressed that the country had obey its own laws and did not
have the discretion to make an exception. ``The national interest
is not part of the question,'' he said.
<p>
   Rubinstein said the government was considering a move to change
the law so that in future cases like this one, Israeli criminal
suspects could be extradited to stand trial overseas but then serve
their sentences back in Israel.

<p>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The fashion world drew together for an
emotional celebration of Gianni Versace Thursday in the first
showing of his label since the designer was slain.
<p>
   Some in the audience cried and all gave a standing ovation to
Donatella Versace, who took up the designing torch for the
billion-dollar fashion group after her brother was fatally shot
July 15 in front of his Miami Beach mansion.
<p>
   ``Tonight was magic,'' said Giorgio Armani, Versace's
arch-rival. ``We need less competition and more respect.''
<p>
   In a rare moment of solidarity among designers, he was joined by
Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Carla Fendi, Angela Missoni, Miuccia
Prada and Mariuccia Mandelli (Krizia) at the show at Versace's
palazzo on fashionable Via Gesu.
<p>
   The event, which had been repeated twice earlier in the day,
ended the Italian Spring-Summer 1998 fashion week.
<p>
   Before the show started, an electronic ``zipper'' above the
runway broadcast a message from the fashion house:
<p>
   ``This show is dedicated to our brother's love of work and to
our entire staff, whose incredible love and devotion was so
precious to our brother and means so much to us.''
<p>
   An unreleased song by Madonna, ``Candy Perfume Girl,'' from an
album due out next year, played in the background. Boy George
composed the music played during the show.
<p>
   At the first edition in late afternoon, Donatella Versace came
on to the runway afterwards to thank the audience but after three
steps she burst into tears and ran off.
<p>
   But by the final showing, she had gained strength and walked
proudly down the runway.
<p>
   ``The audience made me very strong, especially the presence of
Giorgio and the other designers,'' she said afterwards.
<p>
   The company recently announced that Donatella, 12 years Gianni's
junior and in his own words his ``fashion muse,'' would be taking
over the artistic direction of the house and design the label.
Brother Santo continues as chairman. He sat in the front row.
<p>
   Also there were actress Demi Moore, in town to promote her
latest film ``G.I. Jane;'' British actor Rupert Everett; pop star
boy George; actress Cher; and Trudi Schuyler, the wife of rock star
Sting.
<p>
   Versace was the pet designer of the Hollywood ``glitterati'' and
his fashion shows were always star-studded events.
<p>
   ``There was everything of him, and so much of her'' in the
collection, Ms. Moore said referring to Gianni and his sister
Donatella.
<p>
   ``Donatella designed the collection in respect for her
brother,'' Andre Leon Tally, contributing editor for Vogue and a
close fashion follower.
<p>
   Unlike Paris, the Italian designing scene is full of talented
women who have climbed to the top of the fashion Olympus. Milan has
Miuccia Prada, Laura Biagiotti, Anna Molinari, Krizia, (Mariuccia
Mandelli) Donatella Girombelli, Angela Missoni and the five Fendi
sisters.
<p>
   Time will tell whether Donatella can fill the fashion void her
brother left and join them.

   POTCHEFSTROOM, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  A collision Thursday between
a taxi van and a mine company bus killed 17 people.
<p>
   Police spokeswoman Aafje Bothma said one of the taxi's tires
appeared to have burst, causing it to swerve in front of the
oncoming bus.
<p>
   All people in the taxi van  &MD;  five men, nine women and three
children  &MD;  were killed instantly, Bothma said.
<p>
   The bus driver, who was slightly injured, was the only occupant
of the mine vehicle.
<p>
   Potchefstroom is a regional mining center about 120 kilometers
(75 miles) southwest of Johannesburg.
<p>
   Road accidents involving taxi vans, the main mode of
transportation for South Africa's black majority, are common and
often result in fatalities.

Russia denies supplying weapons to Colombian drug traffickers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russian arms sales are under tight state control,
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday in denying reports that
Russian mobsters are shipping weapons to Colombian drug traffickers
in exchange for cocaine.
<p>
   The U.S. news reports were inventions aimed at protecting U.S.
arms exports by ``squeezing Russia out of the Latin American market
by any means,'' spokesman Gennady Tarasov said, according to
Russian news agencies.
<p>
   He said the Russian government controls all military exports.
<p>
   ``This applies fully to our relations with Latin America,''
Tarasov was quoted as saying.
<p>
   The Washington Post reported last month that Russian organized
crime groups had formed an alliance with drug traffickers and were
shipping sophisticated weapons to Colombia.
<p>
   Russia's ambassador to Colombia said late last month that his
embassy was investigating the reports.

Fernandez out with torn rotator cuff
By STEVEN WINE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI (AP)  &MD;  Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez's postseason
ended suddenly Thursday when doctors discovered a fully torn
rotator cuff, an injury that could finish his career.
<p>
   The 28-year-old right-hander underwent an MRI on his pitching
shoulder after lasting just 2 2-3 innings Tuesday in a 7-1 loss to
the Atlanta Braves in Game 2 of the National League championship
series.
<p>
   The outing was Fernandez's shortest since May 25, 1995, when he
pitched for the Chicago White Sox. He struggled with his control,
and his fastballs were consistently clocked at just 83-84 mph
(133-134 kmph).
<p>
   ``There was more pain yesterday than normal,'' he said. ``I
didn't feel like I could throw with any velocity.''
<p>
   Fernandez pitched 220 2-3 innings this season and led the
Marlins with 17 victories, but he said his arm bothered him off and
on the second half of the year. An examination Thursday revealed
the injury pitchers dread, but it's unclear when the tear occurred.
<p>
   ``The doctor can't believe how I was able to go out and throw
the ball,'' Fernandez said.
<p>
   He'll be replaced by Livan Hernandez in Game 6 of the NLCS, if
the series goes that far. Florida and Atlanta are tied at one game
victory apiece, with Game 3 Friday night in Miami.
<p>
   ``I feel bad for the organization and the team,'' said
Fernandez, accompanied by his wife at a news conference. ``I feel
sometimes I let the team down, now that I'm not there for Game 6.''
<p>
   ``This is very disheartening news for Alex and the
organization,'' general manager Dave Dombrowski said.
<p>
   Fernandez, a free-agent last offseason, received a five-year,
dlrs 35 million contract from the Marlins partly because of his
durability. He averaged 213 innings per year in six seasons with
the Chicago White Sox.
<p>
   Fernandez said he expects to pitch again, but it won't be soon.
<p>
   ``It could be probably a full season, a year or a year and a
half,'' he said, his voice breaking with emotion. ``Hopefully it's
less than the prognosis.''

Guerrilla group warns Washington against taking action
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)  &MD;  Hezbollah, designated by the United
States as one of 30 terrorist organizations, warned Washington
Thursday not to take action against its guerrillas.
<p>
   The Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim group also said American
backing of Israeli actions against Lebanon was itself a terrorist
action.
<p>
   On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
designated Hezbollah and 29 other foreign organizations as
terrorist groups  &MD;  taking steps to block fund raising and punish
their U.S. backers.
<p>
   In addition, members and representatives of these organizations
will be ineligible for U.S. visas.
<p>
   The list included 13 Islamic organizations in the Middle East
along with two Israeli groups.
<p>
   ``We have absolutely no doubt of the American administration's
sponsorship of organized international terrorism,'' said a
Hezbollah statement read out on the group's Al-Manar television
station in Beirut.
<p>
   ``Therefore, we warn of any measures resulting from this list.
The Americans should not fall into the trap of the terrorist
Zionist (Israeli) instigation because it will have dire
consequences,'' it added.
<p>
   Hezbollah was believed to be the umbrella organization for
militants who attacked and kidnapped Americans and other Westerners
in the 1980s during the chaotic days of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil
war. More than 260 Americans were killed in those attacks.
<p>
   However, Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since 1990 been
concentrating on fighting Israeli forces and their Lebanese allies
who occupy a border strip in southern Lebanon.
<p>
   Albright's decision was in response to a 1996 law designed to
stop fund raising in the United States by and on behalf of
organizations that engage in or sponsor terrorist acts.
<p>
   ``Real terrorism is embodied today in Israel, which breaks
international law and norms,'' the Hezbollah statement said.
<p>
   It said the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and attacks
on civilians amounted to terrorism.
<p>
   ``Isn't the American administration's apathy toward the
terrorist practices of the Zionist entity (Israel) a terrorist
act?'' the statement asked.

Virgin Islands man sentenced to life in jail for slaying Maryland
woman
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP)  &MD;  A Virgin Islands
youth was sentenced to life in prison without parole for hacking to
death a Maryland tourist during a robbery at her St. Croix
condominium.
<p>
   Johnny Kidd, 20, was convicted in June for the murder of Barbara
Cromwell, of Rockwell. He was sentenced late Wednesday to life in
prison plus 50 years, the same sentence given his accomplice,
17-year-old Nicholas Albert, last year.
<p>
   Ms. Cromwell was found dead in her condominium on St. Croix in
November 1995, bound and gagged with her throat slashed. She had
been stabbed 12 times and doctors said she bled to death. Her
husband, prominent Montgomery County attorney James Cromwell, was
not on St. Croix at the time of the slaying.
<p>
   ``Why did she have to be killed? Why not just tie her up and
take her personal items,'' Judge Alphonse Andrews was quoted as
saying, in Thursday's edition of the Virgin Islands Daily News.
<p>
   It was ``a gruesome murder, one that her family and community
will have to live with,'' he was quoted as saying.
<p>
   Kidd had attempted to pin the murder on Albert, claiming he only
participated in the robbery. But the jury was apparently swayed by
evidence showing Kidd's fingerprints were on the duct tape covering
Cromwell's mouth.
<p>
   Kidd complained before his sentencing that his ``lawyer had done
the best he could, but he spent only about two weeks on my case and
he really didn't do that much,'' the newspaper said.
<p>
   ``He did the best job he could of defending you,'' the judge
responded.
<p>
   Kidd's lawyer, Jeffrey Moorhead, had sought an appeal after the
June conviction because the court violated his client's rights by
removing him from the courtroom in the middle of the verdict. Kidd
was dragged from the courtroom shrieking moments before his
verdict.
<p>
   Moorhead later sought an appeal on grounds he had botched his
client's case, but the request was also refused.
<p>
   Moorhead said Kidd would appeal the guilty verdict, but would do
so through a new lawyer.

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small charter plane carrying seven
German tourists and two Spanish crew members crashed Thursday
morning as it prepared to land at the Banjul airport, killing all
but one person on board, officials said.
<p>
   The crash happened about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers from the airport
in Banjul, the capital of this West African nation, said Claud
Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority.
<p>
   The plane crashed because of a storm, according to a statement
from Naysa, the Spanish company that owned the plane. It gave no
further details on the cause of the crash, though local radio
reports said the weather had been violent around the time of the
accident, with a great deal of lightening and rain.
<p>
   Jensen said the crash was being investigated, but noted that the
airport had lost contact with the plane shortly before it slammed
into the ground.

   The company recently announced that Donatella, 12 years Gianni's
junior and in his own words his ``fashion muse,'' would be taking
over the artistic direction of the house and design the label.
Brother Santo continues as chairman. He sat in the front row.
<p>
   Also there were actress Demi Moore, in town to promote her
latest film ``G.I. Jane;'' British actor Rupert Everett; pop star
boy George; actress Cher; and Trudi Schuyler, the wife of rock star
Sting.
<p>
   Versace was the pet designer of the Hollywood ``glitterati'' and
his fashion shows were always star-studded events.
<p>
   ``There was everything of him, and so much of her'' in the
collection, Ms. Moore said referring to Gianni and his sister
Donatella.
<p>
   For daytime the pant suit has a tight fitting trouser which
flares out to brush the instep, while the jacket is devoid of
lapel, buttons or even sleeve. The models including Gianni
favorites Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista wore nothing
underneath.
<p>
   Colors hark back to the Mediterranean hues the Versaces grew up
with in southern Italy: sea blue, tangerine, peach and green.
Delicate neutrals, like pinks and grays add a more modern touch.
<p>
   Nighttime was all about the rear view. Gowns with demure,
delicately embroidered fronts dip dangerously down to the curve of
the lower back. Sometimes cut gently up the front they are most
often slit right up the back.
<p>
   One silver gown modeled by Naomi had a number of slits and dips
which all came together in one tiny clasp on the hip. It better be
fastened tight.
<p>
   High heeled but not needle thin sandals with ankle ties were the
favorite shoe. The clutch bag was large and roomy in the bright
Versace colors.
<p>
   ``Donatella designed the collection in respect for her
brother,'' Andre Leon Tally, contributing editor for Vogue and a
close fashion follower.
<p>
   Unlike Paris, the Italian designing scene is full of talented
women who have climbed to the top of the fashion Olympus. Milan has
Miuccia Prada, Laura Biagiotti, Anna Molinari, Krizia, (Mariuccia
Mandelli) Donatella Girombelli, Angela Missoni and the five Fendi
sisters.
<p>
   Time will tell whether Donatella can fill the fashion void her
brother left and join them.

   ENGUERA, Spain (AP)  &MD;  A 46-year-old man went on a shooting
rampage Thursday, killing his parents and his neighbor and injuring
another person, before turning the gun on himself.
<p>
   Police said Jaime Palop Bas used a hunting rifle in the
killings.
<p>
   The violence began in the morning when Palop shot Julian Vila
Paredes, 51, apparently because of money problems at a country
house in this little village in eastern Spain.
<p>
   He later shot his parents, Jaime Palop, 76, and Rosa Bas, 70,
when they arrived at the scene of the crime in a taxi, whose driver
was injured by Palop in his arm.
<p>
   Palop then shot himself six kilometers (3 miles) from the
country house.

Russia investigates helicopter attack, Turkey says it crossed
border

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia blamed Turkish border guards Thursday for
an attack on a military helicopter, while Turkey denied its
soldiers opened fire and said villagers may have shot as a warning.
<p>
   Russian officials have said that the border guards' Mi-8
helicopter was seriously damaged when it came under automatic rifle
fire shortly after take off Wednesday in southwestern Georgia, near
the border with Turkey.
<p>
   In another incident, border guards in neighboring Armenia came
under automatic weapons fire from Turkish territory, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported Thursday. No casualties were reported. It was
unclear when the shooting took place.
<p>
   The deputy commander of the Federal Border Service, Lt. Gen.
Alexander Manilov, blamed the attack on Turkish border guards,
Russian news agencies reported.
<p>
   The helicopter landed 250 meters (yards) from the border within
sight of the Turkish troops, who opened fire when the aircraft
lifted off and was 100 meters (yards) up, Manilov said, according
to ITAR-Tass.
<p>
   Omer Buyukkent, the governor for Artvin, the Turkish province
bordering Georgia, told the Anatolia news agency Thursday that the
helicopter violated the border twice under bad weather conditions.
<p>
   ``It is possible that villagers may have fired shots as a
warning. But what is certain is that our military units were not
involved,'' Buyukkent said.
<p>
   Earlier, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said the
shooting never happened. ``We have made our own investigation,''
Akbel told The Associated Press.
<p>
   Regional commander of Russian border guards, Gen. Mikhail
Krylovsky, denied that the helicopter crossed the Georgian-Turkish
border. He spoke at a news conference reported by ITAR-Tass and
Interfax.
<p>
   Border guards said the helicopter was hit eight times, including
twice in the fuel tank. Krylovsky said a doctor was slightly
injured.
<p>
   The helicopter had flown down from the Russian city of Adler and
was ultimately headed for a border post high in the mountains to
evacuate a sick border guard, the border service said.
<p>
   Russian troops help guard the borders in Georgia, a former
Soviet republic. Russian peacekeepers also are deployed in the
separatist Black Sea region of Abkhazia.

Russia's Rybkin urges compromise with Chechnya

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  A top Russian official sounded a conciliatory note
Thursday as political talks resumed with Chechnya's government,
saying ``we must work out a compromise.''
<p>
   The comment by Ivan Rybkin, Security Council secretary and the
Kremlin's top negotiator in the talks in southern Russia, seemed to
signal a softening of the harsh rhetoric exchanged by the two sides
in recent weeks.
<p>
   But Rybkin, in remarks reported by the Interfax news agency,
gave no indication Moscow is about to back off on key points, such
as its insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian
Federation.
<p>
   Russian Television reported that the Russian delegation at the
talks in Sochi will hold fast to its position that a decision on
Chechnya's political status be put off until 2001  &MD;  five years
after the war ended.
<p>
   Kidnappings and human rights violations in Chechnya were high on
the Russian agenda for the talks, Russian news reports said.
<p>
   The talks ended late Thursday and there was no comment from
either side, Interfax said. Rybkin was expected to return to Moscow
early Friday, it said.

Report: Turkey pulls some units from northern Iraq
Eds: RECASTS overline and throughout to UPDATE with reports of
troop withdrawal
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  Turkey has started to withdraw some troops
and tanks from northern Iraq where they have been waging a
punishing three-week offensive against Turkish Kurdish rebels,
according to reports.
<p>
   Turkey launched the incursion to drive rebels of the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, from positions in northern Iraq, which they
use to launch hit-and-run attacks on Turkey. Some 16,000 Turkish
troops are involved in the operation.
<p>
   The London-based Kurdish television Med-TV reported Thursday
that a small number of units had been pulled out of two areas close
to the border, where fierce clashes had taken place recently.
<p>
   The Germany-based Kurdish News Agency said the units had been
redeployed inside Turkey, some three miles (five kilometers) from
the border.
<p>
   It was not clear if they were disengaging from fighting or
merely changing positions. No other details were available and
military officials could not be reached for comment.
<p>
   Earlier Thursday, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Turkish
jets and helicopters hit rebel positions in areas between the Zap
valley and Link mountain in northern Iraq. Commando units
immediately began to comb the area after the air raid.
<p>
   The military claims to have killed 538 guerrillas since the
offensive began three weeks ago. Only six soldiers were reported
killed, but the rebels put Turkish casualties at over 40.
<p>
   Such incursions have become frequent in the last two years.
Turkey only withdrew only some of its troops following its last
major offensive in May, retaining some 8,000 soldiers in the
region.
<p>
   An Iraqi Kurdish group allied with Turkish soldiers claimed
Thursday it has killed 40 Turkish Kurdish rebels in recent clashes.
<p>
   The radio of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, monitored
by Anatolia, said the rebels were killed in clashes along the
border. The radio gave no KDP casualty figures.
<p>
   Turkey has been pressuring rival Iraqi Kurdish groups vying for
control in northern Iraq to prevent the PKK from operating in the
area. U.S.-led allied jets have policed the area since the Persian
Gulf War.

   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline struck Mexico's most
famous tourist resort with devastating fury Thursday as raging
rivers swept bodies, giant boulders and cars down hills toward
wave-ravaged Pacific beaches.

elsewhere in Guerrero state, which is home to the once-glittering
resort of 2.9 million, Gov. Angel Aguirre said.

   ``This is a very sad day,'' said Aguirre on Mexican television,
adding that at least five more deaths were reported elsewhere along
the seaboard during Pauline's two-day rampage up the caost packing
winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph).
<p>
   ``We don't recall a hurricane ever having caused such damage,''
Aguirre said.
<p>
   Fueled by the exceedingly warm El Nino ocean currents, Pauline
powered towering waves up to nine meters (30 feet) tall on some
parts of the coast, the sea pounding prisitine beaches to a rubble
of broken palm trees and twisted lounge chairs.
<p>
   Pauline dumped heavy rains that made streets into torrents of
roaring debris. Boulders the size of cars were swept down the hills
and cars were flipped over like scattered toys, some with lights
still on, their doors underwater. A coastal highway skirting the
famed beaches became a raging river, and one man's body stuck from
mud, arms outstretched and mouth agape.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was extended this morning hundreds of
kilometers (miles) up the coast, from Acapulco to Puerto Vallarta,
as satellite images showed Pauline moving roughly parallel to the
shore, the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.

Book linking ex-ministers to killing sparks inquiry and scandal

<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  French military investigators are looking into a
book on the unsolved assassination of a lawmaker, in a growing
scandal President Jacques Chirac said Thursday challenged ``our
democracy and state of law.''
<p>
   The army is investigating the book, which cites information from
a military source to link the 1994 assassination of Yann Piat to
two ex-ministers, Defense Minister Alain Richard said.
<p>
   The two conservative ex-ministers, Francois Leotard and
Jean-Claude Gaudin, have threatened to sue the book's authors, and
Chirac met with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to discuss fallout
from the case.
<p>
   ``What is at stake is the proper functioning of our democracy
and the state of law,'' Chirac said in a statement. ``No one should
be able to attack with impunity our freedoms and the dignity of
people.''
<p>
   ``The Yann Piat Affair, Assassins at the Heart of Power,'' by
journalists Andre Rougeot and Jean-Michel Verne, cites an anonymous
retired general to implicate Leotard and Gaudin in Mrs. Piat's
death.
<p>
   Mrs. Piat, a centrist member of parliament who fought corruption
in her Riviera district, was gunned down in her car by the
passenger of a motorcycle on a road outside Toulon in 1994.
<p>
   The book says Piat was killed to prevent her from disclosing a
plan to sell military land in southern France to the mafia. At the
time of her death, Leotard was defense minister and Gaudin the
president of the region.
<p>
   Neither was mentioned by name in the book, which used only code
names, but French law allows libel suits even if the reference is
only by implication.
<p>
   Richard, the current defense minister, said an internal army
investigation was underway to determine where the authors got their
information and that the book is filled with ``un-truths.''
<p>
   ``The authors recognized that they did not have the proof behind
the very serious accusations they brought against two important
people,'' Richard said.
<p>
   ``They pretend that the proof would be in the possession of a
soldier, whose identity they hide, and who, if their allegations
were true, would himself be guilty of a crime,'' he said.
<p>
   The daily Liberation said Thursday that the military was
investigating five officers, including a navy captain that used to
work for French intelligence.
<p>
   The 46-year-old captain categorically denied he had spoken with
Rougeot and Verne, and said the first time he heard about the case
was from a television newscast earlier this week, the newspaper
said without giving his name.
<p>
   At the National Assembly Wednesday, several parliamentarians
speculated that the story was fabricated as a political tactic to
affect upcoming regional elections next year.
<p>
   Gaudin is still president of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur
region, a job Leotard, leader of the center-right Union for French
Democracy party (UDF), had hoped to win but may now give up.
<p>
   ``I ask the UDF to measure the impact on public opinion that
will be provoked by the new developments in the affair of Yann
Piat,'' said Renaud Muselier, a parliamentary member of the rival
conservative Rally for the Republic party.

Report: government rules out new yacht for queen
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Queen Elizabeth II and the government have agreed
that there will be no replacement for the royal yacht Britannia
after it retires this year, news reports said Thursday.
<p>
   Plans for a new yacht appear to have become a casualty of tight
government spending restraints and the royal family's increasing
sensitivity to its image.
<p>
   A formal announcement was expected on Friday, the Ministry of
Defense said. It would neither confirm or deny the news reports.
<p>
   Press Association, the British news agency, said the government
would announce that it was studying several proposals for
preserving Britannia, including permanent display in near the
Glasgow shipyards where it was built.
<p>
   Britannia is to begin a farewell tour of Britain on Oct. 20.
<p>
   Just before the election campaign earlier this year, the
previous Conservative government proposed spending 60 million
pounds (dlrs 96 million) for a new yacht.
<p>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party, which won the May 1
elections, at one point talked of getting private sponsorship for
the yacht.
<p>
   The 412-foot (125.6 m) Britannia, launched in 1953, has sailed
more than a million miles as the royal family's official at-sea
residence and has a Royal Navy crew of 224.
<p>
   The Britannia's last world cruise took it to the Middle East,
India and Hong Kong. It sailed from Hong Kong with the last British
governor, Chris Patten, and Prince Charles following the colony's
handover to China on July 1.

the border.
<p>
   It was not clear if they were disengaging from fighting or
merely changing positions. No other details were available and
military officials could not be reached for comment.
<p>
   Earlier Thursday, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Turkish
jets and helicopters hit rebel positions in areas between the Zap
valley and Link mountain in northern Iraq. Commando units
immediately began to comb the area after the air raid.
<p>
   The military claims to have killed 538 guerrillas since the
offensive began three weeks ago. Only six soldiers were reported
killed, but the rebels put Turkish casualties at over 40.
<p>
   Such incursions have become frequent in the last two years.
Turkey only withdrew only some of its troops following its last
major offensive in May, retaining some 8,000 soldiers in the
region.
<p>
   An Iraqi Kurdish group allied with Turkish soldiers claimed
Thursday it has killed 40 Turkish Kurdish rebels in recent clashes.
<p>
   The radio of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, monitored
by Anatolia, said the rebels were killed in clashes along the
border. The radio gave no KDP casualty figures.
<p>
   Turkey has been pressuring rival Iraqi Kurdish groups vying for
control in northern Iraq to prevent the PKK from operating in the
area. U.S.-led allied jets have policed the area since the Persian
Gulf War.

Tyson testifies that he hit Green after he was grabbed
By SAMUEL MAULL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Mike Tyson said former opponent Mitch Green came
after him like ``a madman,'' grabbing him and ripping his shirt.
<p>
   That was how their street fight began on Aug. 23, 1988, the
former heavyweight champion testified Thursday.
<p>
   Green is suing Tyson for dlrs 25 million for beating him up
during the fight in front of Dapper Dan's, a 24-hour-a-day leather
goods store on Harlem's 125th Street.
<p>
   Tyson described a violent and irrational Green. Tyson said he
went to the store to pick up a jacket he ordered and was there
about 40 minutes when Green entered around 4 a.m.
<p>
   ``He came in and started ranting and raving, talking about Don
King had robbed him,'' Tyson said.
<p>
   Green maintains that fight promoter King cheated him by paying
him dlrs 30,000 for his 1986 fight with Tyson, who got dlrs
650,000.
<p>
   Green says this disparity in pay left him dispirited, and the
emotional upset caused him to lose the 10-rounder to Tyson by
decision. He has sought a rematch ever since.
<p>
   Tyson said that when Green continued his harangue, ``I said,
`I'm getting out of here.' I left. He tried to block my way. I
walked around him. He followed me outside ranting and raving. He
grabbed my shirt and ripped it.''
<p>
   ``I believe I struck him then,'' Tyson said in reply to
questions by his lawyer Robert Hirth. ``I believe he went down.''
<p>
   Green and his lawyers contend that Tyson hit him merely because
he approached and asked for a rematch. They said Green was
frustrated because he had been virtually blackballed for two years
by Don King.
<p>
   ``Do you recall how many times you hit him?'' Hirth asked his
client.
<p>
   ``I don't know. Once or twice.''
<p>
   ``He got back up,'' Tyson continued. ``He started throwing
punches.''
<p>
   He said he hit Green again, and Green went down for 30 to 40
seconds. Meanwhile, Tyson said, he fled to his Rolls-Royce and
locked himself in.
<p>
   ``He beat on the window,'' Tyson said. ``He ripped my sideview
mirror off. I was pretty upset. He was screaming and ranting and
raving while he was punching the window. I got out of the car.''
<p>
   Tyson said he hit Green again.
<p>
   ``He went down. He didn't get up that time,'' Tyson said.
<p>
   ``I broke my hand,'' Tyson said. ``I went to the hospital
because my hand hurt.'' It has healed ``but every now and then it
hurts,'' he said, adding that it has not kept him from boxing.
<p>
   Green sat with lawyers, sometimes shaking his head as if
disagreeing with Tyson, but restraining himself much more than at
most other times during the trial. He and Tyson occasionally looked
directly at each other.
<p>
   On cross-examination, Richard Gutierrez, one of Green's lawyers,
questioned Tyson about his divorce from actress Robin Givens, about
going to prison on his rape conviction, and about biting Evander
Holyfield's ear.
<p>
   Tyson yawned theatrically at least four times while answering.
He said Green had aggravated and irritated him when he came into
the store and started yelling at him and ``being a madman for no
apparent reason.''

BC-Hurricane Pauline, 9th Ld-2nd Add,0605
ACAPULCO: Miami reported.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to Germany, ordered
army troops into stricken areas along a huge swath of coastline.
They poured by the hundreds into Acapulco in all-terrain and troop
transport vehicles to secure areas around hundreds of homes wrecked
by raging floods.
<p>
   TV footage showed five bodies in the mud of raging floodwaters.
Jaime Herandez, 40, who lives in the hills near Acapulco, said
police took away at least seven bodies after mud and water came
rushing down before dawn.
<p>
   Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio Santiago said at least 50
people were reported missing and officials feared the toll would
rise.
<p>
   There were no reports of American or other tourists injured, but
many foreigners huddled in hotels while hundreds of Mexicans up and
down the coast remained in emergency shelters.
<p>
   The deadliest drama unfolded in working neighborhoods on the
hills above the five-star oceanfront hotels as a 12-meter-
(40-foot)-wide torrent rushed Pauline's sudden deluge with a roar
toward the sea.
<p>
   ``There were shouts. There flashlights flickering. ... We felt
our apartment building tremble because of the rocks the river was
throwing against the foundations,'' said Elilasio Garcia, 22, who
escaped one 10-story concrete building when a nearly dry gulch
sprang to life.
<p>
   Hundreds of modest homes of cement and wood tottered and
collapsed into floodwaters, and knee-deep torrents raced down many
streets closer to Acapulco's beachfront and into the sea.
<p>
   Fallen palms and washed-out roads and bridges littered hundreds
of kilometers (miles) of coastline amid the worst flooding along
this coast in decades.
<p>
   At least 46 injuries, none serious, were reported in Oaxaca
state by Red Cross and civil defense workers after Pauline barreled
ashore near Huatulco on Wednesday, blowing down makeshift homes of
plywood.
<p>
   In the U-2 public housing project in Huatulco, children drew
water from a muddy canal using buckets on ropes after the canal
overflowed its banks and sent a meter (three feet) of mud into
homes there.
<p>
   ``The water took away everything,'' said Rosaura Aguilar
Ramirez, 38. ``It took our clothes. It took our dishes.
Everything.''
<p>
   Javier Hernandez, 21, shoveled mud out of his corner store in
Huatulco, in which only the shelves more than a meter (three feet)
high were stocked. ``The water took away everything lower than
that,'' he said. ``Milk, tomatoes, sugar, candy. It even turned the
refrigerator over.''
<p>
   In Puerto Angel, where Pauline first rumbled ashore on
Wednesday, many houses that weren't made of concrete were washed
away, said Federico Velazquez, a federal highway police official in
radio contact with that city.
<p>
   Overnight, Pauline pummeled tourist hotels and fishing villages
near Huatulco, churning up nine-meter (30-foot) seas with 185 kph
(115 mph) winds while leaving a trail of roofless and ruined
residences.
<p>
   Pauline nearly flattened the poor community of Las Tres Cruces
next to the Huatulco airport.
<p>
   ``Everything is gone,'' said 32-year-old Evaristo Gerardo Mayo,
surveying the humble neighborhood where pots and pans lay scattered
amid broken glass and waterlogged mattresses.
<p>
   Pauline is one of several strong eastern Pacific cyclones this
year, including Nora, which walloped the American southwest as a
tropical storm  &MD;  a rarity for the desert.
<p>
   Forecasters said El Nino, a phenomenon in which unusually warm
waters disrupt weather patterns, apparently was o blame for the
high number of powerful Pacific hurricanes this year.

Caymans selling bank tied to Gulf Union shut down in Bahamas
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (AP)  &MD;  Cayman authorities announced
Thursday they are selling the First Cayman Bank, an Arab-owned
offshore commercial bank, a week after its sister bank in the
Bahamas was shut because of liquidity problems.
<p>
   Negotiations to sell First Cayman to a local banking institution
``have reached an advanced stage,'' the Caymans Monetary Authority
said in a statement.
<p>
   Officials refused to say by what authority they were selling the
bank, whose tangled ownership appears to have contributed to its
troubles.
<p>
   When news broke of the closure of the Gulf Union Bank of the
Bahamas on Friday, the owner, Sheikh Jabor bin Mohammed al-Thani of
Qatar, announced through a spokesman that he had sold the bank on
May 15 to Sheikh Abdul S. Qureishi, a businessman and banker in
Palm Beach, Florida.
<p>
   But the Caymans Monetary Union said it had refused to authorize
the transfer of the bank and that its legal owner remained
al-Thani. Al-Thani, contacted in Qatar, has refused to comment
further on the bank's ownership. Qureishi was not home when a
reporter called Palm Beach.
<p>
   Sources close to the Gulf Union Bank in the Caymans said the
trouble at the Bahamas bank had started in May, with a large number
of cash transfers to the Caymans bank.
<p>
   After it refused to authorize the bank's sale, the Cayman
authorities rejected a newly named bank manager, who apparently had
ordered the large transfers, and appointed a controller to the
bank.
<p>
   The Bahamas bank could stay closed for at least 90 days, under
the ruling from the Bahamas Central Bank. Christopher Lunn, an
official at the Central Bank, said he had no details on the Bahamas
Gulf Union, but classified the bank as ``relatively small'' with
assets of perhaps dlrs 40 million and 2,000 clients with deposits
averaging dlrs 5,000 to dlrs 10,000.
<p>
   The Cayman's operation is believed to be larger but bank and
government officials said bank secrecy laws prevented them from
divulging details of First Cayman's holdings.

Congolese official accuses Brazzaville militia of shelling
Kinshasa
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP)  &MD;  A top Congolese official on Thursday
accused an opposition militia in the Republic of Congo of shelling
Kinshasa, saying the attack was launched in order to draw Congo
into the neighboring country's civil war.
<p>
   Mwenze Kongolo's statements came a day after Brazzaville and
Kinshasa  &MD;  which face each other across the Congo River  &MD;  exchanged
extensive mortar fire. Two soldiers guarding the office of
President Laurent Kabila were killed in the attack.
<p>
   ``I think it is something deliberately for us to get involved in
this war,'' Kongolo said in an interview with Associated Press
television.
<p>
   He called the shelling, ``a declaration of war, to my
understanding but I don't think the government is ready to take
that action because of all the international ramifications.''
<p>
   The shelling caused panic in some Kinshasa neighborhoods, as
people fled the attack for safer areas. Classes were canceled at
Kinshasa University after at least one shell landed there. The
mortars remained quiet on Thursday.
<p>
   Kongolo accused the ``Cobra'' militia loyal to former Republic
of Congo military ruler Denis Sassou-Nguesso of firing the mortars,
saying the particular shells that landed were not available to the
militia of President Pascale Lissouba.
<p>
   Previously, officials in both countries had blamed the violence
on soldiers still loyal to the late Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, who Kabila overthrew Mobutu in May.
<p>
   Kongolo called for international intervention to stop the
Brazzaville fighting from spreading throughout the region.
<p>
   ``I think the international community should do something about
this, we are having victims dying every day for a war that they
don't know anything of,'' he said.
<p>
   Kongolo's charges came the same day that Sassou-Nguesso signed a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire agreement.
<p>
   The Brazzaville radio station loyal to Sassou-Nguesso confirmed
he had signed the agreement, negotiated last month by Gabonese
President Omar Bongo and special U.N. mediator, Mohamed Sahnoun.
<p>
   But Radio Liberty said the general accepted the cease-fire only
after he added unspecified conditions to the document, which
Lissouba signed last month.
<p>
   The official Republic of Congo radio, which Lissouba controls,
said ``we believe that we are moving closer and closer towards
peace,'' with Sassou-Nguesso's signature.
<p>
   Both stations said no date had been agreed upon yet for the
cease-fire to take effect.
<p>
   The Republic of Congo's civil war broke out in June, when
Lissouba attempted to disarm Sassou-Nguesso's militia ahead of
presidential elections both men were contesting.
<p>
   Sassou-Nguesso accused Lissouba of provoking the violence so he
would have an excuse to delay the election and hold onto power.

Dean Smith retires as North Carolina coach
Eds: UPDATES with official announcement

<TEXT>
<p>
   CHAPEL HILL, North Carolina (AP)  &MD;  Dean Smith retired Thursday
as North Carolina's basketball coach after 36 years, two national
championships, more victories than anyone else - and just nine days
before the start of practice.
<p>
   ``I enjoy basketball. I enjoy coaching basketball,'' Smith said.
``It's the out-of-season stuff I didn't handle well.
<p>
   ``I've been saying for the last eight years or so maybe it's
time to go do something else.''
<p>
   And Thursday he shocked basketball fans everywhere by deciding
to do exactly that.
<p>
   Bill Guthridge, Smith's longtime assistant, will succeed him.
<p>
   ``He has learned well from the master and he is ready and eager
to do the job,'' Athletic Director Dick Baddour said.
<p>
   Guthridge said Smith had had enough of public appearances,
autograph signing and speeches.
<p>
   ``It's all the little things that wore Dean out,'' he said.
<p>
   Said Smith: ``I had one weekend from last Oct. 15 to May 18. I
canceled something. I took a weekend with my family. That's when
children and grandchildren are free.''
<p>
   The 66-year-old Smith fought back tears and sipped from a cup of
water as he announced his retirement at a packed news conference in
the basketball arena that bears his name  &MD;  the Dean Dome.
<p>
   ``I'm the luckiest guy in the world ... to be at the University
of North Carolina,'' said Smith, who just last season broke Adolph
Rupp's career victory mark of 876.
<p>
   Among those attending the news conference were current players,
Georgetown coach John Thompson, who coached the U.S. Olympic team
with Smith in 1976, and Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown, who
played for the Tar Heels.
<p>
   Smith even got a call from President Clinton, a big college
basketball fan.
<p>
   ``There is nobody like you,'' Clinton said. ``But not just
because you won, but because of the way you did it. We all respect
and admire you so much.''
<p>
   Michael Jordan, who played on Smith's 1982 championship team,
called him ``a father figure.''
<p>
   ``He's made an impact on so many players, people's lives and now
he's entitled to do that with his family,'' Jordan said from the
Chicago Bulls' training camp in Deerfield, Ill. ``And certainly we
support his decision.''
<p>
   Smith leaves at the top of his profession.
<p>
   He took the Tar Heels to his 11th Final Four last season. He
also guided the team to his 13th Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament title during the 1996-97 campaign, which started with
his first 0-3 league start.
<p>
   The Tar Heels are considered contenders for a national title,
which Smith has already won twice. With a career record of 879-254,
Smith broke Rupp's record during the NCAA tournament in
Winston-Salem. He won national titles in 1982 and 1993.
<p>
   Smith's teams have finished in the top three of the Atlantic
Coast Conference for a record 33 straight seasons, including last
season's second-place mark.
<p>
   The Tar Heels under Smith also posted an NCAA-record 27 straight
20-win seasons. Smith's only losing season came in his first, when
the Tar Heels went 8-9 in 1961-62.

Archeologists dig up ram-headed sphinxes in Luxor
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Egyptian archeologists have unearthed 24
ram-headed sphinxes in the southern ancient city of Luxor, the
Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
<p>
   The find brings to 600 the number of such statues unearthed in
recent years along the Avenue of Ram-Headed Sphinxes, a path which
links the 1,500-year-old temple of Karnak with the 3,500-year-old
Temple of Luxor  &MD;  two of the most famed sites of Pharaonic Egypt.
<p>
   The sphinxes, which were originally 1,200, sat on either side of
the 2.5 kilometer (1.55 mile) long avenue.
<p>
   The 24 statues, which date back about 1,500 years, cover a
stretch of 160 meters (528 ft) of the avenue.
<p>
   The temples of Karnak and Luxor and other pharaonic sites draw
tens of thousands of tourists each year to Luxor, about 505
kilometers (315 miles) south of Cairo.

BC-ANALYSIS-UN-Cornered in the Congo,0707
All players in the Congo boxed in by their own rhetoric, interests
An AP News Analysis
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The dispute over the U.N. plan to
investigate massacres in Congo looks like traffic gridlock: Nobody
can move unless someone else does. And they all put themselves in
this fix.
<p>
   Last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan suspended efforts to get
a team into the field to investigate whether President Laurent
Kabila's forces massacred thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees during
the revolt that toppled Mobutu Sese Seko.
<p>
   Annan summoned the team to New York for consultation, hoping to
give the United States time to persuade Kabila and his allies in
Rwanda and Uganda that the investigation is in their interests.
<p>
   The United States and Western Europe have threatened to withhold
economic aid unless Kabila cooperates with the investigation.
<p>
   Kabila isn't the only player who stands to lose if the mission
is scrubbed.
<p>
   Annan, the first U.N. chief from sub-Saharan Africa, would look
like a weak figure who caved in to pressure from an African
revolutionary leader who may have blood on his hands.
<p>
   Failure of the mission would also call into question Annan's
promise to make human rights a centerpiece of his administration,
and disappoint human rights groups and other non-governmental
organizations which Annan had vowed would have a more prominent
role within the United Nations.
<p>
   The U.S. President Bill Clinton's plans to extend U.S. influence
in Africa could also suffer a setback. Washington had pinned its
hopes on forging strong ties to Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and a new
government in Congo, formerly Zaire.
<p>
   There are risks for Washington no matter how the dispute plays
out.
<p>
   The United States has warned it will not help Kabila rebuild the
country unless the investigation into the massacres goes forward.
<p>
   But it appears Washington has not decided what to do if the
investigation incriminates Kabila and other African leaders it is
courting. The United States could hardly rush to the defense of
those accused of genocide.
<p>
   Human Rights Watch/Africa, in a detailed report Wednesday, said
most of the massacres were carried out by the Tutsi-led Rwandan
Army and Congolese Tutsis allied with Kabila.
<p>
   Their motive was said to be revenge for the 1994 genocide of a
half-million Rwandan Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu extremists
who ruled Rwanda at the time. The Hutu refugees had fled into the
former Zaire to escape reprisals when Tutsi rebels overthrew the
government in Rwanda.
<p>
   Those refugees, along with Hutu soldiers and militiamen, took
shelter in sprawling camps in eastern Congo, which the United
Nations supervised. During Kabila's rebellion, his forces sought to
clear those camps and drive out Hutu guerrillas.
<p>
   In its report, Human Rights Watch said the Pentagon decided as
early as August 1995 not to oppose Rwanda's plans to clear the
Congolese camps ``provided it was a clean operation, meaning one
with limited civilian casualties.''
<p>
   Under pressure from the Europeans, Washington signed off on a
Security Council plan to send a multinational force to assist the
return of refugees to Rwanda.
<p>
   When fighting erupted near the camps, up to 1 million refugees
reached Rwanda on their own. Washington insisted the multinational
force was no longer necessary, and it was scrubbed.
<p>
   Only later did Washington concede that up to 400,000 other
refugees had fled into the bush. There, human rights groups say,
many were slaughtered.
<p>
   Some U.N. officials, speaking privately, believe Kabila himself
is willing to approve the investigation. But he is under pressure
from Rwanda and other regional officials, who may have had a
personal hand in the murders.
<p>
   Some senior U.N. officials have said privately it may have been
a mistake to link international support so closely to the
investigation. With or without help, Kabila's fragile government
could unravel, threatening any hope of regional stability.

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  French military investigators are looking into a
book on the unsolved assassination of a lawmaker, in a growing
scandal President Jacques Chirac said Thursday challenged ``our
democracy and state of law.''
<p>
   The army is investigating the book, which cites information from
a military source to link the 1994 assassination of Yann Piat to
two ex-ministers, Defense Minister Alain Richard said.
<p>
   The two conservative ex-ministers, Francois Leotard and
Jean-Claude Gaudin, have threatened to sue the book's authors, and
Chirac met with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to discuss fallout
from the case.
<p>
   ``What is at stake is the proper functioning of our democracy
and the state of law,'' Chirac said in a statement. ``No one should
be able to attack with impunity our freedoms and the dignity of
people.''
<p>
   ``The Yann Piat Affair, Assassins at the Heart of Power,'' by
journalists Andre Rougeot and Jean-Michel Verne, cites an anonymous
retired general to implicate Leotard and Gaudin in Mrs. Piat's
death.
<p>
   Mrs. Piat, a centrist member of parliament who fought corruption
in her Riviera district, was gunned down in her car by the
passenger of a motorcycle on a road outside Toulon in 1994.
<p>
   The book says Piat was killed to prevent her from disclosing a
plan to sell military land in southern France to the mafia. At the
time of her death, Leotard was defense minister and Gaudin the
minister of cities and president of the region.
<p>
   Neither was mentioned by name in the book, which refers to them
only as ``the squid'' and ``scooter,'' but says they were political
stars of the then-ruling majority along with other identifying
details. French law allows libel suits even if the reference is
only by implication.

Governor asks state to get behind `fresh start' for Olympics
By KRISTEN MOULTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  &MD;  Gov. Mike Leavitt asked Utah residents on
Thursday to get behind the 2002 Winter Olympics, a message prompted
by souring public opinion in the wake of scandal and management
upheaval.
<p>
   ``Remember who we are  &MD;  pioneers who made cities bloom in the
desert; neighbors who help each other when help is needed; citizens
who band together to rise to any occasion,'' the governor said in a
statewide radio address carried by 10 stations.
<p>
   ``We are doers and builders who decided we wanted the Olympic
Games and worked until we got them,'' he said.
<p>
   Leavitt's address and an appearance before the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee for the Games came as public support for the
Olympics was at its lowest ebb as measured by pollsters.
<p>
   A poll conducted for the Deseret News in late September found
support for the Olympic effort had dropped to 53 percent from 62
percent in late July. That's when Olympic committee chief executive
Tom Welch resigned and then pleaded no contest to a spousal abuse
charge.
<p>
   In the weeks following Welch's resignation, the committee moved
its chairman, Frank Joklik, into Welch's spot. That prompted the
resignations of two top financial executives, one a respected
former state budget director.
<p>
   Then, Leavitt's choice for the state's first Olympics
coordinator said he wouldn't take the job after all because he saw
Joklik and the committee as hostile to state oversight.
<p>
   Last week, Leavitt appointed a new coordinator, John E. Fowler,
a former general authority of the Mormon church. And the governor
and Mayor Deedee Corradini announced auto dealer Robert Garff as
the new chairman of the committee.
<p>
   Now, the governor says, it's time for a fresh start.
<p>
   He drew parallels between Utah's euphoria over the Jazz reaching
the NBA Finals last spring. ``We rose up spontaneously behind the
Jazz and we united. It was because the Jazz are our team. Well, the
Olympics are our Games,'' he said.
<p>
   The Republican governor attempted to reassure residents the
Games are being planned in a financially sound and responsible way.
<p>
   The governor, during an appearance later before SLOC,
specifically called on the committee's members to pull together as
preparations for the Winter Games enter a critical phase.
<p>
   With that in mind, Leavitt stressed that all committee members
need to re-examine whether they have the time and energy to serve
on the board.
<p>
   Concerned about what possible bills taxpayers may be left with,
the governor also told the board to keep foremost in its
deliberations that the Games can cost no more than the revenues
they'll bring in.
<p>
   But even as Leavitt was trying to reinvigorate public support,
another tempest was brewing at the organizing committee.
<p>
   Members of the Salt Lake City Council objected to a request by
Joklik that he keep his vote as a member of the board and its
executive committee even though he's now an employee of the board.
Welch did not have a board vote.

BC-Sports-Boxing-Mercer Offer,0244
Lewis offered dlrs 20 million, with strings, to fight Mercer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Marc Roberts, manager of Ray Mercer, said on
Thursday he would guarantee WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis
dlrs 20 million to fight Mercer.
<p>
   Mercer would fight for free, should Lewis agree to guarantee
dlrs 10 million to Project Pride at Newark, New Jersey if he loses,
Roberts said.
<p>
   `You know I have the capability of putting up dlrs 20 million,''
said Roberts, chairman of Worldwide Entertainment and Sports Corp.
``I'm very sincere about the offer.''
<p>
   Asked if he thought Lewis would accept the offer, Roberts said,
``I think if I offered dlrs 100 million, he wouldn't fight Ray
Mercer.''
<p>
   Lewis, of Britain, scored a disputed 10-round decision over
Mercer, of East Orange, New Jersey May 10, 1996, before he becoming
WBC champion a second time.
<p>
   Last Saturday, Lewis stopped Andrew Golota in 95 seconds at
Atlantic City, New Jersey. Golota had been scheduled to fight
Mercer Aug. 16, but Mercer suffered a neck injury that required
surgery.
<p>
   There has been talk about Lewis fighting the winner of the Nov.
8 bout between Evander Holyfield and Michael Moorer in a match in
which he would not only make in the neighborhood of dlrs 20
million, but could also win the WBA and IBF titles.
<p>
   ``When that day comes, I'll believe it,'' Roberts said. ``That
fight isn't written in stone.''

<p>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  About 30 pilot whales frustrated
attempts to rescue them by beaching themselves again early Friday
morning after having been floated free.
<p>
   Rescuers on Thursday refloated 48 pilot whales, which had
stranded themselves on a beach on New Zealand's remote far north
coast.
<p>
   But about 30 stranded themselves again overnight.
<p>
   Conservation department spokeswoman Wanda Vivequin said a new
effort would be made to refloat the recalcitrant whales.
<p>
   ``Unusually,'' the rest of the pod has continued out to sea and
apparently is not interested in returning to the beach.
<p>
   Rescuers draped wet clothes over the whales and fire fighting
crews helped pump water to them during Thurssday's attempts to keep
them moist.
<p>
   The pod of more than 100 whales was discovered beached on
Wednesday afternoon. Fifty-three were already dead and the others
were in distress, officials said.
<p>
   The whales, each up to eight meters (yards) in length and
weighing up to 1.5 tons (1,500 kilos), were believed to have been
migrating south into Antarctic waters.
<p>
   Vivequin said the the whales' progress will be monitored from
the air and sea until they are up to five miles (12 kilometers)
offshore, where they would be clear of headlands and considered out
of danger.

<p>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline pounded Mexico's
Pacific resort coast Thursday with battering winds, waves and rains
that sent flash floods raging through this popular tourist resort,
claiming dozens of lives.
<p>
   At least 59 people died and dozens are missing along hundreds of
kilometers (miles) of coastline pummeled by Pauline's 160 kph
(100-mph) winds. Forty of those deaths were in badly battered
Acapulco, a glittering resort of 2.9 million people.
<p>
   ``This is a very sad day,'' said Gov. Angel Aguirre of Guerrero
state, home to Acapulco, where Pauline sent torrents of rainwater
raging through streets. He said at least five other people were
killed elsewhere in the state, adding ``We don't recall a hurricane
ever having caused such damage.''
<p>
   In neighboring Oaxaca state, where Pauline first struck with 185
kph (115-mph) winds a day earlier, state government spokesman
Leandro Hernandez reported 14 deaths, 15 people missing and
thousands of homeless.
<p>
   ``The figure could still rise,'' said Hernandez, speaking with
The Associated Press by telephone from the state, where powerful
Pauline ripped makeshift homes away and badly damaged such resorts
as Puerto Angel.
<p>
   The Oaxaca deaths included two people in a pickup truck swept
away by floodwaters and eight in a flooded river. Four people,
including a boy, drowned on the coast, Hernandez said.
<p>
   Fueled by the exceedingly warm El Nino ocean currents, Pauline
powered towering waves  &MD;  10 meter (30 feet) tall on exposed coasts
 &MD;  that pounded Acapulco's pristine beaches to a flooded rubble of
trash and twisted lounge chairs.
<p>
   Heavy rains turned Acapulco's streets into roaring rivers of
debris.
<p>
   Water swept boulders the size of cars down the hills and flipped
vehicles like toys, catching some with lights still on. A coastal
highway skirting the famed beaches teemed with raging water, and
one man's body stuck from the mud, arms outstretched and mouth
agape.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was extended hundreds of kilometers (miles)
up the coast, from Acapulco to the resort of Puerto Vallarta, as
satellite images showed Pauline churning northwest along the shore,
the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said.
<p>
   At 2100 GMT, Pauline was located off the coast near the port of
Lazaro Cardenas, but 160-kph (100-mph) winds had weakened to 135
kph (85-mph) amid  &MD;  still a big worry because of threats of more
flash floods and large, battering waves.
<p>
   ``If Pauline survives, it could become a potential threat to the
Gulf of California and adjacent areas within the next day or two,''
warned Miami forecaster Max Mayfield.
<p>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to Germany, ordered
soldiers into stricken areas along a huge swath of coastline.
Soldiers poured by the hundreds into Acapulco in Humvees and
transports to secure areas around hundreds of homes wrecked by
floods.
<p>
   The deadliest drama unfolded in working neighborhoods on the
hills above the five-star oceanfront hotels as a 12-meter-
(40-foot-) wide torrent rushed Pauline's sudden deluge with a roar
toward the ocean. There were no reports of foreign tourists being
injured.
<p>
   At least two of the dead where later found floating in the sea.
<p>
   ``There were shouts. There flashlights flickering .... We felt
our apartment building tremble because of the rocks the river was
throwing against the foundations,'' said Elilasio Garcia, 22, who
escaped one 10-story concrete building when a nearly dry gulch
sprang to life.
<p>
   Hundreds of modest homes of cement and wood tottered and
collapsed into floodwaters and knee-deep torrents raced down many
streets closer to the beach front, rushing brown and frothing to
the sea.
<p>
   At least 46 injuries, none serious, were reported in Oaxaca
state by Red Cross and civil defense workers after Pauline barreled
ashore near Huatulco on Wednesday, blowing down makeshift homes of
plywood.
<p>
   In the U-2 public housing project in Huatulco, children drew
water from a muddy canal using buckets on ropes after the canal
overflowed its banks and sent three feet of mud into homes there.
<p>
   ``The water took away everything,'' said Rosaura Aguilar
Ramirez, 38. ``It took our clothes. It took our dishes.
Everything.''
<p>
   She threw a muddy rag into the yard. ``My daughter's dress,''
she said.
<p>
   Javier Hernandez, 21, shoveled mud out of his corner store in
Huatulco, in which only the shelves more than 3 feet high were
stocked. ``The water took away everything lower than that,'' he
said. ``Milk, tomatoes, sugar, candy. It even turned the
refrigerator over.''

Two men in car throw Molotov cocktail near Israeli Embassy
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  &MD;  Two men in a speeding car threw a Molotov
cocktail at an empty lot in front of the Israeli Embassy Thursday,
the first such attack since an Israeli bungled assassination
attempt against a radical Muslim leader two weeks ago.
<p>
   Police officials said there were no injuries or damage in the
late night attack near the Israeli Embassy in Amman's upscale
Rabiya neighborhood
<p>
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad said the bomb caused ``a
small fire but we would not have noticed it had the Jordanian
authorities not informed us about it.''
<p>
   No one claimed responsibilty for the attack which followed an
assassination attempt on Khalid Mashaal, the political chief of the
militant Hamas group, in Jordan on Sept. 25. Two suspected Israeli
Mossad agents, carrying forged Canadian passports, reportedly
injected him with a toxic substance. Jordan's King Hussein helped
get an antidote, and he has recovered.
<p>
   The two men were returned to Israel Monday as part of a prisoner
swap.
<p>
   Thursday's attack was the second on an Israeli target in Jordan
since Sept. 22, when two gunmen shot and slightly wounded two
Israeli Embassy security guards in the capital Amman. A previously
unknown group, calling itself the Jordanian Islamic Resistance,
claimed responsibility for the attack.

Father and son charged with smuggling Cuban cigars into U.S.

<TEXT>
<p>
   FORT MYERS, Florida (AP)  &MD;  A father and son have been indicted
for bringing prohibited Cuban cigars into Florida.
<p>
   Robert Paul Winters, 61, and his 19-year-old son Bobby Winters,
both of Key Largo, are charged in a three-count indictment with
conspiracy to smuggle, smuggling and trading with the enemy.
<p>
   The charges in the indictment unsealed Wednesday carry a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison.
<p>
   Federal prosecutors say Bobby Winters, a boat captain, was
aboard the Endless Starr in November 1996 when it docked in Cuba.
He is charged with bringing 240 boxes of the cigars into Key West
and delivering most of them to his father.
<p>
   Cuban cigars have been illegal in the U.S. since the 1962 trade
embargo imposed by President Kennedy over Fidel Castro's political
ideology. Premium Cuban cigars  &MD;  a Cohiba or a Montecristo  &MD;  can
fetch dlrs 25 each in the United States.

Italian midfielder announces return to Italian league
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Italian midfielder Roberto Donadoni confirmed
days of speculation and media reports on Thursday, announcing he
will return to his former club AC Milan after two seasons in the
upstart American Major League Soccer.
<p>
   ``The only reason I am leaving is because I am going to Milan,''
said Donadoni, who was the core of the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars. ``I will miss the American fans. I like the way and the
style they treated us.''
<p>
   Donadoni, who was the first foreign player signed by MLS and
gave the new league instant credibility, returns to the team where
he played 10 seasons, winning five Italian league titles.
<p>
   He spurned an offer to return to Europe last year when he
rejected a offer from Spain's Real Madrid, instead signing a
two-year pact to stay with MLS.
<p>
   MLS officials said the league received compensation for the
34-year-old Donadoni, which came in the form of an undisclosed
transfer fee and ``other considerations.''
<p>
   ``It is a disappointing day for Major League Soccer to lose a
player who gave his heart and soul, who happens to be following his
heart by going back to Italy,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said.
``It is important to know he will always be remembered as one of
the founding fathers of MLS.''
<p>
   AC Milan discarded Donadoni after the 1994-95 season, allowing
him to go to MLS without a transfer fee. Now mired in 13th place in
the Italian standings with a 1-2-2 record and eight points behind
league-leading and cross-town rival Internazionale, the Red and
Black are trying to save their season.
<p>
   Donadoni immediately became one of MLS' biggest attractions,
earning the MetroStars Most Valuable Player Award last season and
being named to the league's ``Best 11.''
<p>
   He scored six goals in 52 games and was recalled to the Italian
national team for the 1996 European Championship.
<p>
   Donadoni came to the United States, saying he wanted to be a
pioneer in one of soccer's last frontiers.
<p>
   ``I believe that Major League Soccer's structure is the right
one to create and develop the game in America,'' he said Thursday.
``I saw difficulties where I expected them. It has been only two
years time, and it is difficult to succeed overnight. The league
absolutely has a good future. It has the necessary organization to
succeed.''

<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Survivors of Argentina's ``dirty war'' wept
and remembered missing friends Thursday in the wake of a former
Argentine naval officer's admission that he hurled dissidents from
airplanes.
<p>
   Thousands of Argentine emigres and Spaniards who lived in
Argentina during the 1976-83 mass killings called a national radio
talk show to share their grief.
<p>
   The outpouring of emotion was triggered by former Argentine
naval officer Adolfo Scilingo's testimony in a Spanish courtroom
about the dirty war, in which at least 9,000 suspected leftist
dissidents were arrested, tortured and never seen again.
<p>
   It was the first time a member of Argentina's security forces
who participated in the killings provided details in court.
<p>
   No such investigation has been held in Argentina. In 1990,
Argentine President Carlos Menem pardoned middle- and
senior-ranking officers, claiming they had no culpability.
<p>
   Scilingo is testifying in Spain because a judge there is
investigating the disappearances of 600 Spaniards during the dirty
war. Spanish law allows the prosecution of genocide no matter where
it is committed and regardless of the nationality of those accused.
<p>
   In Thursday's session Scilingo claimed that as many as 1,500
officials of Argentine's navy participated in the ``death
flights''during the dirty war, news reports said.
<p>
   He testified that himself did two journeys at the planes in
which 27 detained where thrown into the ocean. But did not give
details of his role in these deaths, the state news agency EFE
said.
<p>
   Outside the court, a dozen people demonstrated, calling him
``assassin'' and holding white puppets symbolizing those who
disappeared.
<p>
   Panelists on the talk show had been discussing Scilingo's
testimony, which began Tuesday, when the calls started flooding in.
Many Argentines had fled to Spain and other countries to escape the
violence.
<p>
   A former teacher in Argentina recalled students and parents who
disappeared.
<p>
   ``Ask Scilingo,'' she said in a trembling voice, ``if he threw
those people into the sea.''
<p>
   One 42-year-old man, who identified himself only as Jose,
recalled the many students he had known in Argentina who were among
the missing. He broke down crying and was unable to continue.
<p>
   ``I'm sorry. There's so many things ... that only so few people
know about,'' he said.
<p>
   In contrast, one caller who identified himself as Emilio said he
remembered that his security company received many orders for
alarms from military personnel who were afraid that Montoneros,
left-wing nationalist rebels, would invade their homes and massacre
their families.
<p>
   ``Let it not be forgotten there were thousand of killings by the
Montoneros,'' said the caller. ``Every effect has its cause.''
<p>
   Scilingo, who came to Spain voluntarily, was arrested Tuesday.
After Friday, Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon must seek an extension
order on his arrest, file charges or free him.
<p>
   Garzon has also ordered the arrest of a former military leader
of Argentina, but the government has refused to hand over key
military personnel or help with the investigation.

   BANJUL, Gambia (AP)  &MD;  A small charter plane carrying seven
German tourists and two Spanish crew members crashed Thursday
morning as it prepared to land at the Banjul airport, killing all
but one person on board, officials said.
<p>
   The crash happened about 3 a.m. local time when the
Spanish-registered plane was about two kilometers from the airport
in Banjul, the capital of this West African nation, said Claud
Jensen, the spokesman for the Gambia Civil Aviation Authority.
<p>
   The plane crashed because of a storm, according to a statement
from Naysa, the Spanish company that owned the plane. It gave no
further details on the cause of the crash, though local radio
reports said the weather had been violent around the time of the
accident, with a great deal of lightning and rain.

First lady says time to `move hearts, change attitudes' toward
women
Eds: Updates with speech given, other activites

<TEXT>
<p>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP)  &MD;  In a land where dictatorships have
given way to democracies, Hillary Rodham Clinton called on nations
of the Americas Thursday to go a step further to protect the
political and economic rights of women.
<p>
   The only way for democracies to ``survive and thrive,'' she
said, is give women more power ``to seek and claim their rights as
citizens and as human beings.''
<p>
   Speaking at a conference of Latin American first ladies, Mrs.
Clinton suggested the challenge could be more difficult than the
giant undertaking of building the Panama Canal, whose Pacific
entrance was just blocks away.
<p>
   ``Instead of mountains, we seek to move hearts, to change old
attitudes, to banish hunger and disease and ignorance, to educate
all our children ... to empower the women of our hemisphere to
participate fully in the life of our nations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   The first lady, speaking at the annual Conference of Wives of
Heads of State and Government of the Americas, included the United
States among the countries where women need greater opportunity.
<p>
   ``In too many countries, my own as well, too many rights are
denied and too many doors of opportunity remain tightly closed,''
Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   Without being specific, she called for changes in both law and
attitude to protect women's property and employment rights, combat
sexual and domestic violence, encourage political participation and
reduce poverty.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton underscored her message by witnessing the signing
of a dlrs 4.8 million grant from the Agency for International
Development to the Inter-American Institute on Human Rights, the
region's pre-eminent human rights organization.
<p>
   Where once the institute's focus was repressives regimes that
engaged in torture and execution, now its Gender and Human Rights
program pushes for greater legal and political opportunity for
women.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton cited signs of progress throughout Latin America.
In Costa Rica, for example, women pushed through a law against
domestic violence and worked to train police about the problem. In
El Salvador, she said, legislators have modernized rape laws and
required politicians to pay child support before running for
office.
<p>
   The first lady also was swearing in new Peace Corps volunteers
on Thursday and touring the Panama Canal, which the United States
is gradually turning over to the Panamanians under a treaty
negotiated during the Carter admnistration.
<p>
   After returning home on Friday, the first lady returns to Latin
America on Sunday with President Clinton for a visit to Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela. She plans to use the trip to see success
stories  &MD;  local programs that ensure women have access to low cost
credit, family planning, education and other needs.

Appeals panel rules for union, clearing Dudley to Knicks trade
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
AP Basketball Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  A three-man appeals panel issued a quick
decision in the Chris Dudley case Thursday, upholding an earlier
judgment that clears the way for a trade of the backup center to
the New York Knicks.
<p>
   Dudley will be sent to the Knicks from the Portland Trail
Blazers, who reached an agreement with the player on a dlrs 1.13
million contract while he was a free agent and then traded him to
the Knicks in a three-way National Basketball Association deal also
involving Toronto.
<p>
   The Raptors will receive second-year forward John Wallace from
New York, the Knicks will get the Raptors' first-round draft pick
in 1998 and Portland will receive New York's No. 1 pick.
<p>
   At issue was whether Dudley, who opted out of a contract with
three years and dlrs 13 million remaining on it and then re-signed
with Portland after realizing he had misjudged the free agent
market, could sign for a lower salary with the Trail Blazers and
retain his Larry Bird-exception rights.
<p>
   The rule gives players who play three or more years with the
same team the ability to re-sign with their current team regardless
of the salary cap. It would grant Dudley the right to secure a
long-term deal with the Knicks after playing for a lower salary
this season.
<p>
   Dudley, who averaged 3.9 points and 7.3 rebounds for Portland
last season  &MD;  his 10th in the NBA  &MD;  will be the backup to Patrick
Ewing.
<p>
   Wallace, who got off to a fast start last season but was used
sparingly thereafter, averaged 4.8 points and 2.3 rebounds. He was
a first-round choice (18th overall) from Syracuse in the 1996 draft
and had been practicing with the Knicks since camp opened Oct. 3.

Waldorf's 63 gives him one-shot lead in Michelob Championship
By HANK KURZ Jr.
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP)  &MD;  Since he finished fourth in the
Texas Open 2 1/2 weeks ago, Duffy Waldorf said he's spent most of
his time away from golf and the rest of it trying to keep his
new-found putting stroke working.
<p>
   After continuing with a routine he started before Texas, Waldorf
made it pay off again Thursday as he needed just 23 putts in an
8-under-par 63 that gave him a one-shot lead after the first round
of the Michelob Championship.
<p>
   ``Just concentrating on hitting the ball the right distance on
my putts is all I've been doing, and it's really helped,'' Waldorf
said after equaling the best round of his career, a score he's now
posted four times.
<p>
   ``In the middle of this year, I was lining it up and still kind
of fidgeting, worrying about my line and not thinking about the
distance. Now, once I get the line right, I'm just thinking about
the distance,'' he said.
<p>
   Waldorf was 2-under after going out on the back nine, then had
two streaks of three straight birdies in finishing his bogey-free
round. He capped the afternoon by hitting a 4-iron to 4 feet (1.2
meters) on the par-4 9th.
<p>
   ``I got from 5 to 8 before I knew what I was doing,'' he said.
<p>
   Brad Bryant also had his putter working, at least for 17 holes,
and he was one stroke back. Bryant needed just 20 putts until the
18th hole, when his approach stopped ``an acre and a half'' from
the hole and he three-putted.
<p>
   ``It didn't feel like me out there with the putter today until
the last hole,'' said Bryant, who twice strung together four
one-putt birdies.
<p>
   ``It's been a long time since I played good,'' he said.
<p>
   Greg Kraft, 138th on the money list, had a bizarre round with
nine birdies, one bogey and a three-putt double for a 65 that left
him in third place, one shot ahead of Kirk Triplett, Scott Gump,
Lennie Clements and Brett Quigley.
<p>
   Fred Couples and David Duval were among eight golfers four shots
back after one trip over the 6,797-yard (6,185-meter) River Course
of the Kingsmill Golf Club.
<p>
   During his break, Waldorf hurt his back while tying his shoe and
wound up lying flat for the better part of a week. That enabled him
to watch the Ryder Cup, and also forced him to leave his clubs in
the bag.
<p>
   After his strong showing at Texas, that was a good thing, he
said.
<p>
   ``A lot of times, if you're playing well, you're better off just
taking a break and not working on things too much,'' said Waldorf,
92nd on the money list with dlrs 231,824. ``You just want to keep
it going.''
<p>
   Bryant said his summer has been going downhill since he withdrew
from the U.S. Open because of illness, and he just wants to get
something going. He's playing with a hurting right shoulder, but
said it may have helped him.
<p>
   ``I think I just kind of overdid the fly fishing a couple weeks
ago and strained a muscle,'' Bryant said. ``But for every good
swing I make, the less it hurts, so it's a good incentive to make
good swings.''
<p>
   Until this year, this tournament preceded the British Open and
had almost always been played in high temperatures with humidity to
match.
<p>
   Defending champion Scott Hoch, who set the tournament record
with a 19-under 265 in his wire-to-wire victory last year, opened
with a 70.

   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline struck Mexico's most
famous tourist resort with devastating fury Thursday, unleashing
deadly torrents that swept people, cars and giant boulders toward
storm-ravaged Pacific beaches. At least 59 people died along
hundreds of kilometers (miles) of coast pummeled by Pauline's
160-kph (100-mph) winds  &MD;  40 of those deaths in badly battered
Acapulco, a glittering resort of 2.9 million people. Gov. Angel
Aguirre of Guerrero state, home to Acapulco, said at least five
other people were killed elsewhere in the state. In neighboring
Oaxaca state, state government spokesman Leandro Hernandez
confirmed 14 deaths, 15 people missing and thousands of homeless.
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  A small communist party whose leader reveres Fidel
Castro and courted Mexican guerrillas brought down Italy's 55th
post-war government on Thursday. Premier Romano Prodi resigned
after his Marxist allies, the Communist Refoundation Party, refused
to tolerate welfare cuts the government says are vital for Italy's
entry into the common European currency. President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro asked Prodi to stay on as caretaker while he consults with
political leaders on forming a new government. Prodi's deputy
premier, Walter Veltroni, said he believed new national elections
would be necessary  &MD;  Italy's third in six years.
<p>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)  &MD;  Hamas leaders, gathered in Gaza to
celebrate their spiritual leader's return, said Thursday they would
keep fighting Israel  &MD;  despite earlier conciliatory statements by
Sheik Ahmed Yassin himself. ``Hamas will continue to terrorize all
the enemies of God and we will continue in our Jihad and
resistance,'' said the militant Palestinian group's political
leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who is considered a relative moderate.
Rantisi stood with Yassin on the stage in a Gaza City soccer
stadium while the cleric received a phone call from Khaled Mashaal,
the Hamas strategist who was the target of a failed Israeli
assassination attempt in Jordan last month.
<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  Maurice Papon, the former Cabinet
minister charged with sending French Jews to Nazi death camps,
suffered chest pains Thursday as the court was considering whether
to hold him in a hospital or in prison during his trial. A
court-appointed panel of doctors examined Papon on Thursday and
recommended that the 87-year-old defendant, who underwent triple
bypass surgery last year, be held in a hospital cardiology unit.
Presiding Judge Jean-Louis Castagnede said a decision would be
announced Friday.
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Dario Fo, the unabashed leftist
playwright who was prosecuted by Italy, denounced by Roman Catholic
Church leaders and barred from the United States, won the Nobel
Prize for Literature on Thursday. Fo, Italy's best-known dramatist
despite a ban on his work on state-run radio and TV, was a surprise
choice, absent from most critics' lists of contenders. In honoring
the 71-year-old Fo, the Swedish Academy called him the modern
equivalent of a court jester, citing his ``scourging authority and
upholding the dignity of the downtrodden.''

   Here is a summary of late financial news from The Associated
Press. Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the
items below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Stocks finished mostly lower Thursday as a
sudden wave of inflation jitters escalated with some unsettling
developments at home and abroad. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 33.64 points to 8,061.42 after recovering from an early
92-point drop that nearly dragged the blue-chip barometer below

   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  The dollar tumbled to a 3 1/2-month intraday low
against the mark Thursday after Germany's central bank raised a key
short-term interest rate for the first time in five years. The U.S.
currency was barely changed vs. the yen. Although many traders had
anticipated a rate hike by the Bundesbank, the dollar dropped
quickly after the bank raised its securities repurchase rate to 3.3
percent from 3 percent, citing a need to fend off inflation. ``The
timing and the magnitude ... surprised the markets,'' said John
Nelson, foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank NV in
Chicago. (US-DOLLAR)

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Germany's central bank raised interest
rates Thursday for the first time in more than five years, calling
it a precautionary move against inflation. Central banks in France,
the Netherlands and Denmark followed suit. The German Bundesbank
announced it was increasing its securities repurchase (repo) rates
through Oct. 22 to 3.3 percent from 3 percent, to pre-empt higher
inflation and help dampen growth in the money supply. At the same
time, the Bundesbank left its official discount and Lombard rates
unchanged at a respective 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent.

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  The Dutch Central Bank lifted its
fixed advance rate, the equivalent of Germany's discount rate, to
2.75 percent from 2.5 percent Thursday. The increase in the fixed
advance rate came as a surprise. The last time the bank changed the
fixed advance rate was March 10, when it was lifted to 2.5 percent
from 2 percent. The Dutch Central Bank said the decision to
increase the fixed advance rate was taken after considering the
developments of the domestic economy. (NETHERLANDS-INTEREST RATES)

   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  Brazilian coffee exports rose 9 percent
in September and earnings nearly doubled from a year earlier,
exporters said Thursday. Exports last month climbed to 1.25 million
bags, from 1.15 million bags in September 1996, according to
figures from the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters, Febec.
In the first nine months, exports jumped to 10.9 million bags, a 43
percent increase from the same period in 1996. Febec said the rise
brings exports back to normal levels, after two frosts reduced the
harvest in the previous crop year. Febec said exports should remain
steady till the end of the year. (BRAZIL-COFFEE)

   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Trying to slash 12.5 percent unemployment,
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin faces a tightrope walk in
talks with labor and business on Europe's struggle to create jobs
and compete globally. Tough posturing by French business and unions
ahead of Jospin's jobs conference opening Friday could mean
trouble, posing his toughest challenge yet as he grapples with high
taxes, extensive social benefits and restrictive labor laws. Most
of Europe appears headed toward loosening strict employment and
business laws to spur U.S.-style job-creation. Still, debate over
cutting the work week to spread jobs around has drawn attention
across the continent and even shaken Italy's government this week.

<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Unemployment lines unexpectedly got a little
shorter last week in the United States, the latest sign of a tight
job market that threatens to revive inflation pressures. The news
fueled further financial market losses. But a second report
suggested a slower economy that may not need a dose of higher rates
to keep inflation at bay. Major retailers reported that
unseasonably warm weather curbed September sales, especially
apparel. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity. The Labor Department said Thursday that new
applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally
adjusted 304,000, down from 309,000 during the week ended Sept. 27.

<p>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colorado (AP)  &MD;  Author Kurt Vonnegut, true to his
irreverent style, said he did not mourn Princess Diana's death.
<p>
   Vonnegut said Diana never made any memorable statement and was
not known to have read a book.
<p>
   ``She's too tall, for one thing,'' the author told a luncheon
gathering Wednesday. ``I don't know why people are worshipping this
tweed. ... Don't you think you've all gone loony?''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  A band called ``Dead Dianas'' has been turned away
from the town hall in Lancaster.
<p>
   ``The city council hopes that no other venue will allow this
group to appear whilst using this offensive material,'' Lancaster
City Council leader Stanley Henig said Thursday.
<p>
   ``They are obviously a bunch of talentless creeps who just want
publicity for themselves,'' added the local member of Parliament,
Hilton Dawson.
<p>
   The group had put up posters in Lancaster which showed a
photograph of the auto crash which killed Diana, boyfriend Dodi
Fayed and their driver.
<p>
   The band's drummer, John Constantine, said the group aimed to
attack the public reaction to Diana's death.
<p>
   ``Dead Dianas was formed in direct response to the way the
government and the press reacted after the death of Diana. They are
the people who are in bad taste, not us,'' he said.
<p>
   ``There is a famous punk band called the Dead Kennedys and no
one is upset about them,'' Constantine added.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Chay Blyth, the first person to sail around the
world from east to west, is now ``Sir Chay.''
<p>
   Princess Anne, filling in for her mother, Queen Elizabeth II,
knighted the 57-year-old son of a Scottish railway worker Thursday
at Buckingham Palace.
<p>
   ``It's extraordinary if you think that I have come from such a
working-class background,'' Blyth said. ``When people see that I
have been knighted, and I am an ordinary guy, perhaps they may
think there is a chance for them too.''
<p>
   When he set out on his first great adventure, rowing with fellow
paratrooper John Ridgeway from the United States to Ireland in
1966, Blyth had never sailed more than six miles (10 kilometers).
<p>
   Four years later, he began his solo nonstop trip around the
world in the 59-foot (18-meter) yacht British Steel. He returned to
Britain on Aug. 6, 1971 after 292 days at sea.
<p>
   Blyth flew to London on Wednesday from Tenerife in the Canary
Islands, where he is organizing a trans-Atlantic rowing race that
starts on Sunday.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  John F. Kennedy Jr. entered a hospital for hand
surgery, the Daily News reported Thursday.
<p>
   Kennedy went to Lenox Hill Hospital on Wednesday, accompanied by
his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg.
<p>
   Hospital spokeswoman Karen Zipern would not discuss the report,
saying ``we absolutely do not comment on any patients.''
<p>
   A spokeswoman for George magazine declined to comment on the
editor-in-chief's personal life.
<p>
   ``Hand surgery? Yeah, that just doesn't fall into the scope of
the magazine,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Haberman.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  A French appeals court fined Brigitte Bardot dlrs
1600 for inciting racial hatred and ordered her to pay a symbolic
20 cents Thursday to human rights groups that sued her for
criticizing the Muslim slaughter of sheep.
<p>
   The court overturned an earlier ruling in favor of the
63-year-old former screen siren and animal rights campaigner on
charges of defaming Muslims.
<p>
   Ms. Bardot was sued for her commentary in the conservative daily
Le Figaro in April 1996, in which she blasted the four-day Eid
al-Adha spring festival, when many of France's 3 million Muslims
sacrifice a lamb.
<p>
   Ms. Bardot, who is married to a member of France's
anti-immigrant National Front party, complained of ``foreign
overpopulation,'' saying the slaughter was ``torture, signs of the
most atrocious pagan sacrifices.''
<p>
   The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship of People said
Thursday's court ruling ``honors justice and dishonors the woman
who was the symbol of a certain image of France.''
<p>
   There was no immediate comment from Ms. Bardot or from her
animal rights group, the Bardot Foundation. She could have been
given a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of dlrs
60,000.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Egyptian archeologists have unearthed 24
ram-headed sphinxes in the southern ancient city of Luxor, the
Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
<p>
   The find brings to 600 the number of such statues unearthed in
recent years along the Avenue of Ram-Headed Sphinxes, a path which
links the 1,500-year-old temple of Karnak with the 3,500-year-old
Temple of Luxor  &MD;  two of the most famed sites of Pharaonic Egypt.
<p>
   The sphinxes, which originally numbered 1,200, sat on either
side of the 2.5 kilometer (1.5 mile) long avenue.
<p>
   The 24 statues, which date back about 1,500 years, cover a
stretch of 160 meters (528 ft) of the avenue.
<p>
   The temples of Karnak and Luxor and other pharaonic sites draw
tens of thousands of tourists each year to Luxor, about 505
kilometers (315 miles) south of Cairo.

BC-UN-Massacres
US denies role in massacres
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The United States on Thursday denied
giving Rwanda the go-ahead to massacre thousands of Rwandan Hutu
refugees in eastern Congo but refused to say whether it had advance
information about Kigali's plan to intervene in the Congolese civil
war.
<p>
   Also Thursday, a U.N. official said a report blaming the Rwandan
army and President Laurent Kabila's forces for most of the
massacres of civilians in eastern Congo underscores the urgency of
a U.N. investigation into the charges.
<p>
   Last week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalled four team
leaders for consultations after differences between the United
Nations and the Congo government stalled the probe.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the next step in the dispute is
for the United States to send an envoy to Congo and Rwanda to urge
leaders there to allow the United Nations to carry out an unimpeded
investigation in the Congo.
<p>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin denied
allegations that the United States had advance word on the
slaughter of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Congo. But Rubin
avoided a clear denial that Washington knew in advance that the
Rwandam army was about to enter the Congo rebellion.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch/Africa charged in a report that Kabila's
side bore most of the responsibility for the slaughter, even though
troops loyal to ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko committed acts of
murder, rape and robbery during the seven-month revolt which ousted
the longtime dictator.
<p>
   The report, released Wednesday, claimed the abuses committed by
Kabila's forces and the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army ``are
remarkably different in their scale, nature and motivation'' from
those carried out by Mobutu's troops and his Rwandan militiamen
allies.
<p>
   ``These killings and the intentional blocking of aid were
apparently both in revenge for the 1994 genocide (in Rwanda)''  &MD; 
and to weaken Hutu militiamen who were fighting alongside Mobutu's
soldiers, the report said.
<p>
   Eckhard said the report ``underlines the importance of a United
Nations mission getting underway, and we continue to be hopeful it
will happen.''
<p>
   Eckhard said the United Nations hoped a special American envoy,
who has not been publicly named, would be able to break the
impasse.
<p>
   But Human Rights Watch also claimed the United States bore some
responsibility for the massacres because Washington knew in advance
that Rwanda planned to intervene in the Congo.
<p>
   ``This allegation is absolutely false,'' Rubin said. ``The
United States government has condemned strongly the ethnic violence
in the Great Lakes, and especially in Rwanda, and has worked with
all the parties in that area to bring about an end to ethnic
clashes. The United States did not receive advance notice of the
horrific violence that has engulfed Rwanda in recent years.''
<p>
   He also denied any U.S. role in arming the Rwandans. ``Our
military assistance to Rwanda is limited to helping the Rwandans
professionalize their military and adopt democratic practices,'' he
said. ``These training activities, which were limited in numbers
and confined to Rwanda, were largely targeted on such areas as
humanitarian demining, human rights, and the rule of law. The
Department of Defense provided no lethal equipment to the Rwandan
military. Currently there is no military training being provided by
the U.S in Rwanda.''
<p>
   But when pressed whether Washington knew that the Rwandan army
was about to move, Rubin said: ``I'm not going to be able to get
into the possible detection of troop movements, and I'm not going
to rule out that we can know when troops are moving. The suggestion
was the United States received advance notice of the horrific
violence that was going to take place and gave a `nod and a wink'
to it, and that is a ridiculous claim.''

Woosnam hitting it longer, straighter with new driver
Eds: RECAPS previous; will update about 1200 GMT with first 18
holes of quarterfinals
By STEPHEN WADE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP)  &MD;  Ian Woosnam may have found a club
to straighten and lengthen his woeful drives. The brand name is
``Tegra.''
<p>
   As in ``Tegra Woods?'' he was asked.
<p>
   Woosnam just rolled his eyes and laughed at being compared off
the tee to Tiger Woods  &MD;  if even it was just a play on words.
<p>
   ``No, nowhere near,'' said the 1991 Masters champion.
<p>
   ``Last week I tired about 14 different types of drivers and
maybe I have now found the one,'' said Woosnam, who beat fellow
European Ryder member Jesper Parnevik 4 and 3 Thursday in the first
round of the World Match Play Championship.
<p>
   ``Maybe this is the one that will do it for me,'' he said. ``If
I can get it in the fairway, I can usually do all right.''
<p>
   He'll need all the distance he can get facing three-time
defending champion Ernie Els in the quarterfinals. Els, a smooth
and long hitter with any club, is unbeaten in nine matches in this
event on the West Course at Wentworth just south of London.
<p>
   ``The American-made driver is very unusual looking,'' Woosnam
explained. ``The idea is that the shaft is getting closer to the
middle of the face of the club  &MD;  like a center-shafted putter... It
was done by a scientist, a NASA scientist.''
<p>
   ``It's been depressing to struggle off the tee with these guys
hitting it so much further,'' Woosnam added.
<p>
   In Thursday's other first-round matches, American Brad Faxon,
New Zealand's Frank Nobilo, and Vijay Singh of Fiji won to reach
the quarterfinals.
<p>
   Singh defeated Tsukasa Watanabe of Japan 4 and 3, Nobilo
defeated American Phil Mickelson on the second playoff hole (the
38th overall) and American Brad Faxon defeated Ryder Cup player
Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland 2 and 1.
<p>
   While Woosnam faced Els in Friday's quarterfinals, Faxon faced
Montgomerie, Nobilo drew Price, and Singh got Australian Steve
Elkington  &MD;  the four seeded players.
<p>
   Faxon's quarterfinal against Montgomerie was being dubbed
``Ryder Cup II.'' But Faxon wasn't buying it.
<p>
   ``It's not going to get the Ryder Cup back to the States. It's
not the same as much as you make it out to be,'' said Faxon.
<p>
   Prior to the Ryder Cup two weeks ago, Montgomerie commented that
Faxon's pending divorce would hurt his play and predicted his wild
drives would doom him on the tight Valderrama course.
<p>
   As it happened, Faxon won only one of three possible points as
the Europeans won 14 1/2-13 1/2 to keep the Ryder Cup.
<p>
   ``On Sunday (the final day of the Ryder Cup) some people told me
some of his comments that were written,'' Faxon said. ``I didn't
want to make a big deal of it until I talked to Monty myself.''
<p>
   ``I talked to Monty a couple of days ago,'' Faxon added.
``Things get twisted up. Monty and I are friends.''
<p>
   The main first-round casualty was Faxon's American Ryder
teammate Mickelson, who lost on the second playoff hole (the 38th
overall) to Nobilo after a his 12-foot (4-meter) putt lipped out on
the 36th, which would have been the match winner for the
left-handed American.
<p>
   Last year Mickelson also lost in the first round on the final
hole. This time he drove his tee shot on the 36th hole into a
bunker and settled for par as Nobilo got birdie to force the
playoff.
<p>
   ``I thought I had the putt made on 18, but as I look back on it
 &MD;  it was the drive into the bunker than hurt me,'' Mickelson said.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  Thousands of judicial workers demanding
higher wages entered the second week of their strike Thursday
despite government pressure to go back to work.
<p>
   The workers walked off the job Oct. 1, prompting the government
to warn them they may be fired. This week, a top court ordered the
suspension of strikers' salaries.
<p>
   About 40,000 workers are involved in the nationwide protest,
according to the Association of Judicial Employees, the union that
organized the strike. Three previous strikes by judicial workers
this year lasted one day, but the union said the latest was
indefinite.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   MEXICO CITY (AP)  &MD;  Mexicana airline suspended all flights to
Bogota, Colombia, beginning Thursday, following the discovery of a
shipment of cocaine on one of its airplanes.
<p>
   Last Wednesday, Mexican federal agents found 31 kilograms (69
pounds) of cocaine on a Mexicana de Aviacion SA airplane that had
arrived on a commercial flight from Bogota's El Dorado airport. The
flight was en route to Los Angeles.
<p>
   According to the attorney general's office, the cocaine was
found during a routine search of the plane. The drugs were
contained in eight packages hidden in the evacuation tube
compartment.
<p>
   News reports said the drug find was the second this year  &MD;  80
kilograms (176 pounds) of cocaine were found on a Mexicana flight
from Bogota to Los Angeles with a stopover in Mexico City in July.
<p>
   In a news release, Mexicana said it was fully cooperating with
authorities in Mexico, the United States and Colombia to tighten
security for commercial flights.
<p>
   But it said that until security can be guaranteed at El Dorado
airport, it would suspend all flights out of Colombia.
<p>
   Mexicana has operated four weekly flights to Bogota since April
7, 1992. The company said Colombian airline Avianca will honor
Mexicana tickets already purchased.
<p>
   It said it has taken the measure to protect its passengers,
crew, and ground personnel.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
      MEXICO CITY (AP)  &MD;  Mexico's consumer prices rose 1.25 percent in
September from the month before and rose 18.76 percent from a year
ago, the Bank of Mexico said Thursday.
<p>
   The central bank had earlier reported that consumer prices rose
0.87 percent in the first half of September.
<p>
   Market watchers had expected the September inflation figure to
come in above 1 percent, even before the first-half data came out.
Mexico typically experiences an inflation bubble in September.
<p>
   In Thursday's news release, the central bank attributed the
September increase to tuition hikes at centers of learning, which
contributed 0.35 percentage points to the overall figure. Price
increases in tortillas, eggs and milk contributed another 0.19
percentage points.

<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Leaders from 40 European countries are
seeking common ground between east and west at a summit tackling
human rights and stability in the continent's emerging democracies.
<p>
   The two-day Council of Europe summit, with new members such as
Russia, Ukraine and Croatia, seeks to reassert the organization's
basic values of promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of
law at a time when those ideals remain fragile at best in a number
of countries. The summit begins Friday.
<p>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who announced Thursday he would
not seek a third term, says he wants European leaders to try to
lessen U.S. influence on the continent.
<p>
   Although Yeltsin is striving for great power, Russia's primary
preoccupation is domestic problems, and it has grudgingly had to
accept NATO's enlargement.
<p>
   Russian officials said Yeltsin is expected to stress in his
speech the need for Russia's full integration into democratic
Europe  &MD;  something the Russian leader said would take at least 10
years.
<p>
   The United States is not a member of the Council of Europe but
still tries to exert influence.
<p>
   This month, Washington circulated an unofficial paper
criticizing Croatia's failure to ensure press freedom and civil
liberties and proposed suspending Croatia from the Council until
its human rights record improves.
<p>
   Council officials said though many members shared some of
Washington's concerns, it was unlikely Croatia would be suspended.
<p>
   John Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
democracy and human rights who is heading the American observer
team at the summit, said the United States backed off its proposal
on Croatia after 10 suspected Croatian war criminals surrendered to
authorities.
<p>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a letter to summit host
President Jacques Chirac of France, declared Washington would
contribute dlrs 1 million toward the operation of the Bosnian human
rights commission, administered by the Council of Europe.
<p>
   Major aims of the summit will be to create a single, permanent
European Court of Human Rights by 1998, available to more than 800
million Europeans; fight corruption, money laundering and organized
crime; to ban cloning of human beings and to combat racism and
intolerance.
<p>
   Now that the Council has expanded from 12 to an unwieldy 40
members, those problems are tougher to solve.
<p>
   Another proposal would set up a corruption-prevention body as a
focal point for cooperation on corruption, organized crime and
money laundering  &MD;  a major problem in the former East Bloc.
<p>
   The Council of Europe, created in 1949 and with a current budget
of 153 million European currency units (dlrs 171 million), has a
reputation as something of a talk shop lacking real political
punch.

<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  The army will evacuate 100 soldiers
from Malaysia because of health concerns raised by the smog
blanketing Southeast Asia, a spokesman said Friday.
<p>
   Lt.-Col. David Tyler said soldiers with the Butterworth Rifle
Company training at the former Royal Australian Air Force base at
Butterworth, near Penang, would be transported back to Australia at
the weekend.
<p>
   ``A lot of their training is very strenuous and because of the
haze we thought it prudent to bring them home for health reasons,''
Tyler said.
<p>
   Australian soldiers have been based at the Butterworth base for
many years, and carried out training operations and joint exercises
with other defense forces in the region, he said.
<p>
   The company will be evacuated to Townsville, north Queensland.
<p>
   Huge fires in Indonesia have blanketed a large area of Southeast
Asia in a thick smoke haze, which has been blamed for ship
collisions and for contributing to air crashes.

   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline has devastated a big
section of Pacific Coast line, striking Mexico most famous tourist
resort with deadly fury before it lost strength and was downgraded
to a tropical storm.
<p>
   At least 118 people were killed in the states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. Twice that number were reported injured. Dozens were
missing Thursday. Floods and mud slides were rampant, and damage
was enormous.
<p>
   All ports were closed all the way from Tapachula, near the
Guatemalan border, to Acapulco. Air traffic was suspended until
further notice. Power was out through most of the coast, and
telephone service was spotty.

   The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said that at 0000 GMT,
Pauline was centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Playa
Azul in Guerrero state, and moving northwest at 20 kph (13 mph).
But winds dropped to 112 kph (70 mph)  &MD;  6 kph (4 mph) below
hurricane level.
<p>
   But heavy flood warnings remained in effect.
<p>
   Guerrero state secretary Humberto Salgado said 94 people died
Thursday in Acapulco  &MD;  most of them drowned by flash floods.
<p>
   Authorities appealed for help for Acapulco, which the federal
government declared a disaster area. The beach resort had run out
of gasoline, drinking water, food, clothing, medicines and many
more essentials.
<p>
   ``This is a very sad day,'' said Gov. Angel Aguirre of Guerrero
state, home to Acapulco, where Pauline sent torrents of rainwater
raging through streets. Aguirre said at least five other people
were killed elsewhere in the state, adding, ``We don't recall a
hurricane ever having caused such damage.''

more essentials.
<p>
   ``This is a very sad day,'' said Gov. Angel Aguirre of Guerrero
state, home to Acapulco, where Pauline sent torrents of rainwater
raging through streets. Aguirre said at least five other people
were killed elsewhere in the state, adding, ``We don't recall a
hurricane ever having caused such damage.''

ACAPULCO: such damage.''
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In neighboring Oaxaca state, where Pauline first struck with 185
kph (115-mph) winds a day earlier, state government spokesman
Leandro Hernandez confirmed 19 deaths, 15 people missing and
thousands of homeless.
<p>
   ``The figure could still rise,'' said Hernandez, speaking with
The Associated Press by telephone from the state, where powerful
Pauline ripped makeshift homes away and badly damaged such resorts
as Puerto Angel.
<p>
   Fueled by the warm El Nino ocean currents, Pauline powered
towering waves  &MD;  10 meters (30 feet) tall on exposed coasts  &MD;  that
pounded Acapulco's pristine beaches to a maelstrom of trash and
twisted lounge chairs.
<p>
   Heavy rains turned streets into roaring rivers of debris. Water
swept boulders the size of cars down the hills and flipped vehicles
like toys, catching some with lights still on, their doors
underwater. A coastal highway skirting the famed beaches teemed
with raging water, and one man's body stuck from the mud, arms
outstretched and mouth agape.
<p>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to Germany, ordered
army troops into stricken areas along a long stretch of coast.
Troops in Humvees poured into Acapulco by the hundreds to secure
areas around homes wrecked by raging floods.
<p>
   TV footage showed bodies mired in the mud. Jaime Hernandez , who
lives in the hills near Acapulco, said police took away at least
seven bodies after mud and water came rushing down before dawn.
<p>
   ``We've got rain coming down, mudslides blocking roads. Houses
have fallen, walls are down,'' Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio
Santiago said.
<p>
   Many foreign tourists huddled in hotels while hundreds of
Mexicans up and down the coast remained in emergency shelters.
<p>
   Acapulco's deadliest drama unfolded in working neighborhoods on
the hills above the five-star ocean-front hotels as a 40-foot-wide
torrent tumbled toward the sea.
<p>
   ``We felt our apartment building tremble because of the rocks
the river was throwing against the foundations,'' said Eliseo
Garcia, 22, who escaped one 10-story concrete building when a
nearly dry gulch sprang to life.
<p>
   Hundreds of modest homes of cement and wood tottered and
collapsed into floodwaters and knee-deep torrents raced down many
streets closer to Acapulco's beach, rushing to the sea.
<p>
   Hurricane Pauline barreled ashore near Huatulco in Oaxaca state
on Wednesday, blowing down plywood homes.
<p>
   In a public housing project in Huatulco, children drew water
from a dirty canal using buckets after the canal overflowed its
banks and sent a meter (three feet) of mud into homes there.
<p>
   ``The water took away everything,'' said Rosaura Aguilar
Ramirez, 38. ``It took our clothes. It took our dishes.
Everything.''
<p>
   She threw a muddy rag into the yard. ``My daughter's dress,''
she said.
<p>
   In Puerto Angel, where Pauline first rumbled ashore on
Wednesday, many houses that weren't made of concrete were washed
away, said Federico Velazquez, a federal highway police official in
radio contact with that city. Waves tore away the beach of the
Huatulco Sheraton.
<p>
   Forecasters said El Nino, a phenomenon in which unusually warm
waters disrupt weather patterns, apparently was to blame for the
high number of powerful Pacific hurricanes this year.

Land mines, China rights, Bosnian peace in Nobel speculation
Eds; To be updated with announcement of prize winner expected at
0900 GMT on Friday.
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  A group campaigning to rid the world of land
mines figured heavily in frenzied, last minute speculation in the
Norwegian media.
<p>
   But only the secretive committee knows which name will be called
from a list of 130 nominees at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) Friday.
<p>
   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines was high on most
lists, especially after its campaign became a favorite of the late
Princess Diana. Some speculated on Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, who framed an anti-landmine treaty.
<p>
   Other possibles include the humanitarian group Doctors Without
Borders; U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton
accord that brought a troubled peace to Bosnia; Balkan peace
activists Selim Beslagic, Vesna Pesic and Vesna Terselic; and
Chinese dissidents Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan.
<p>
   Less prominent, but also mentioned, were U.S. President Jimmy
Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, Cambodian monk Maha
Ghosananda for his peace efforts, the Salvation Army and the
Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia.
<p>
   The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee works in deep secret
to pick a winner of the coveted prize, which includes a cash award
worth 7.5 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 1 million) this year.
<p>
   The committee refuses to say who is nominated, much less hint at
who might win. Many groups or individuals who propose candidates
publicize their nominations.
<p>
   After the names of winners PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin were leaked before the 1994 prize
announcement, the committee has grown even more silent. Rabin's
colleague, Shimon Peres, also won that year, but did not figure in
pre-prize speculation.
<p>
   The national media missed the 1995 winners  &MD;  Joseph Rotblat and
his Pugwash movement against nuclear weapons. Last year, they
mentioned one winner, East Timorese Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes
Belo, but not the other, activist Jose Ramos-Horta, also of East
Timor.
<p>
   After six years of quietly working toward a ban on
anti-personnel mines, the U.S.-based International Campaign to Ban
Landmines burst into the public's consciousness with the death of
Diana, the cause's most visible supporter.
<p>
   And last month in Oslo, more than 90 countries drafted a treaty
that would totally ban anti-personnel mines, which kill or maim
26,000 people a year, about 80 percent of them civilians.
<p>
   Since the Oslo-based Nobel committee often uses the prize to
encourage ongoing efforts, this year's award could be used to prod
the United States, Russia, China and other countries which say they
will not sign the land mine ban treaty in December.
<p>
   Others say it's time to honor the humanitarian group, Doctors
Without Borders, for more than 25 years of providing medical care
in dangerous areas.
<p>
   Also, the conflict in former Yugoslavia has figured heavily in
speculation over the past two years and remains in the running. The
prize could go to Holbrooke or local peace activists, such as
Beslagic, mayor of the Bosnian city of Tuzla; Pesic, an anti-war
activist in Serbia, and Terselic, a peace activist in Croatia.
<p>
   The committee might choose to give China a public slap for its
human rights record by honoring Wei, 47, a leading pro-democracy
campaigner, or Wang, a 28-year-old leader of student demonstrations
in 1989.
<p>
   The peace prize is the third Nobel announced this week. The
Swedish Academy said Thursday that Dario Fo, an Italian playwright,
had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. On Monday, American Stanley
Prusiner won the medicine prize.
<p>
   The Nobel prizes are always awarded on the Dec. 10 anniversary
of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who invented dynamite and
endowed the prizes in his 1895 will. The peace prize, first awarded
in 1901, is presented in Oslo, while the other Nobel prizes are
presented in the Swedish capital, Stockholm.

<p>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  The warring parties on Papua
New Guinea's secessionist island of Bougainville on Friday
announced an agreement to a cease-fire at the close of their second
round of peace talks.
<p>
   After 10 days of talks by almost 100 Papua New Guinea and
Bougainville island officials and rebels at the New Zealand army
camp in Burnham, they unanimously agreed to sign an immediate
cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce calls for an immediate halt to the armed conflict, for
all parties to work toward reconciliation, and to cooperate to
return government services to normal.
<p>
   Bougainville leaders signed a historic accord in July, calling
for a cease-fire and an end to the bitter war on the Papua New
Guinea island, which has continued for almost 10 years.
<p>
   But Papua New Guinea central government officials wed not
involved in the first round of talks.
<p>
   The talks also examined moves to consider a reconstruction of
the economy and facilities on Bougainville.
<p>
   Further talks will focus on the composition of a multinational
Pacific peacekeeping force to monitor the cease-fire.
<p>
   The small but mineral-rich Pacific island, home to about 160,000
people, has been torn by a bloody civil war since 1988.
<p>
   Thousands have died in the bloody civil conflict on Bougainville
since landowners revolted in 1989 over the royalties they received
and environmental damage caused by the huge part-Australian owned
Panguna copper mine.

Papon trial focuses on health of the accused

<p>
   BORDEAUX, France (AP)  &MD;  The health of Maurice Papon, charged
with committing crimes against humanity in occupied France, has
taken center stage near the end of the trial's first week.
<p>
   The former police official in the pro-Nazi Vichy regime suffered
an attack of chest pains Thursday, even as the court deliberated on
whether to hold him in a hospital or in prison during his trial,
which is expected to last three months.
<p>
   A court-appointed panel of doctors recommended Thursday that
Papon, 87, who underwent triple bypass surgery last year, be held
in a hospital cardiology unit under guard. Papon wants to stay in a
private residence. The court was to announce its decision Friday.
<p>
   A former police supervisor in the Gironde region around
Bordeaux, Papon is charged with ordering the deportation of 1,690
Jews, including 223 children, from this southwestern French city.
<p>
   He is the most senior Vichy official to stand trial for crimes
against humanity, and his historic trial should shed light on one
of the darkest chapters in French history.
<p>
   During World War II, France deported about 76,000 Jews,
including 12,000 children, to Nazi death camps; only some 2,500
survived.
<p>
   Near the end of hearings Thursday, Papon said he suffered chest
pains, but was able to return to the courtroom after being briefly
treated by a doctor.
<p>
   Minutes before the chest pains, Papon had refused to acknowledge
remorse for the suffering of Bordeaux's Jews.
<p>
   Papon's lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut, arguing that the massive
coverage of the proceedings was biased and jeopardized Papon's
chances for a fair trial, said France 2 television had censored an
interview with Papon to remove his expression of ``deep pain over
Jewish suffering.''
<p>
   When civil party lawyer Gerard Welzer asked Papon to tell the
court what was allegedly cut out of the interview, Papon refused.
<p>
   ``Go rummage through the wastebaskets at France 2, which refused
to broadcast it,'' he said, rising from his seat behind bulletproof
glass.
<p>
   In the 16 years since evidence surfaced showing his active role
in deporting Jews, Papon, a former budget minister under
conservative President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, has repeatedly
denied the charges and refused to apologize.
<p>
   Earlier, Varaut asked the court to throw out the case, saying
his client could not get a fair trial amid the massive media
coverage.
<p>
   Varaut also argued that the jury, mostly in their 40s, could not
understand the difficulties of occupied France because they did not
live through it. He also said Papon could not defend himself
properly because most of the witnesses, including his superiors,
were dead.
<p>
   The court will rule on Varaut's request next week.

Tourists who weathered hurricane: `We're from Chicago and we know
wind'
With Mexico-Pauline
By MARK STEVENSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  They came to Acapulco envisioning days
of relaxation, lapped by the resort city's warm Pacific breezes.
<p>
   But early Thursday, Joyce Walton and Diane Ballard awoke in
their beachside luxury hotel to the clatter of driving rain as
Hurricane Pauline raked the resort with high winds and sent flash
floods hurdling down nearby hillsides, killing more than 100
people.
<p>
   ``I felt safe. But I had a dream that this hotel fell down,''
said Walton, an American. ``It was really windy.''
<p>
   No foreign tourists were reported killed or injured during
Pauline's passage. Many of those who spent the night high in sturdy
five-star hotels of concrete little realized the horror unfolding
on the hills.
<p>
   None of the big hotels suffered any damage, but many lost at
least half of their beachfront to pounding waves  &MD;  a strip of sand
only 10 meters (yards) wide in many places.
<p>
   Vinnie Conti, 29, of New York City, said he wasn't afraid,
returning from a night of partying even as Pauline roared by.
<p>
   ``We went out about 11 p.m. and when we came back in at 5 in the
morning it was coming down pretty hard,'' he said of the rains,
which didn't abate until Thursday afternoon.
<p>
   Dennis Perrom, a Canadian visitor from Quebec, was traveling his
wife, sat glumly watching the destruction as rivers of water roared
past to the sea, carrying trash, logs and crumpled beach chairs.
<p>
   But he said he hoped his vacation wasn't a total loss.
<p>
   Nearby, a 40-meter (yard) torrent of muddy water virtually cut
Acapulco in half, leaving city hall not far from the abyss. Homes
higher up the hills dangled over a 320-meter- (200-foot-) wide
ravine the flood waters hollowed deeper than an existing gulch.
<p>
   Ana Gervilla had never experienced a hurricane, and this was
nothing to compare with the storms of the Pampas in her native
Argentina. ``We didn't know much about Pauline. We're from
Argentina and we don't have much contact with hurricanes.''
<p>
   ``You do get scared because of the wind and the waves, but we
didn't have any problem at all,'' she said.
<p>
   While shops and bars remained shuttered Thursday evening,
closing down Acapulco's normally rowdy nightlife, poor Mexicans
further up the hills pulled their dead from the muck and surveyed
the damage to hundreds of homes.
<p>
   ``There was a string of shops over here and a church over
there,'' said Ricardo Cruz, eyeing the damage high up in a working
class settlement that overlooks the tourist hotels.
<p>
   Alejandro Ratillo looked out on the raging waters that once were
a quiet creek. The storm waters stole nearly 30 meters (100 feet)
of his property and his house now stood in danger of collapsing
into the abyss, his living room hanging in air.
<p>
   ``I could never imagine I would go through something like this.
It is horrible. I could never imagine it,'' he said.

It's official: Green is fastest man on wheels
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GERLACH, Nevada (AP)  &MD;  Andy Green is officially the fastest man
on wheels.
<p>
   On an otherwise frustrating Thursday for the British Thrust SSC
team as bad weather set in on the Black Rock Desert, the
International Automobile Federation sanctioned Green's 714.144 mph
(1,149 kmph) run made Sept. 25.
<p>
   Green has gone faster, but not in an officially timed dash.
Thursday's designation wrests the record away from his boss,
Richard Noble, who set the previous standard of 633.47 mph (1,019
kmph) on Oct. 4, 1983.
<p>
   Fickle winds and occasional showers kept Green indoors on
Thursday. Across the playa, rival racer Craig Breedlove's Spirit of
America was parked as well.
<p>
   Noble wants to see his jet-powered car break the sound barrier
before he returns to England.
<p>
   Green flirted with Mach 1 on Tuesday, pushing the car to an
unofficial speed of 750 mph (1,207 kmph). The actual speed of sound
is in the 750-765 mph (1,200-1,225 kmph) range, depending on
weather conditions in the 5,000-foot (1,500-meter) altitude.
<p>
   Breedlove recorded a 475 mph (765 kmph) engine test earlier
Tuesday.
<p>
   Breedlove was the fastest man on land five times in the
mid-1960s and was the first to exceed 400 mph (640 kmph), 500 mph
(800 kmph) and 600 mph (960 kmph). His best speed this year was 531
mph (850 kmph) on Monday.

<p>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline struck Mexico's most
famous tourist resort with devastating fury, unleashing deadly
torrents that swept people, cars and boulders toward ravaged
Pacific beaches before being downgraded to a tropical storm.
<p>
   At least 118 people were killed in the states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. Twice that number were reported injured. Dozens were
missing. Floods and mud slides were rampant, and damage was
extensive.
<p>
   All ports were closed from Tapachula, near the Guatemalan
border, to Acapulco. Air traffic was suspended. Power was out
through most of the coast, and telephone service was spotty.
<p>
   The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said at 0000 GMT that Pauline
was centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Playa Azul in
Guerrero state, and moving northwest at 20 kph (13 mph). Winds had
dropped to 112 kph (70 mph)  &MD;  below hurricane level of 119 kph (74
mph).
<p>
   But heavy flood warnings remained in effect.
<p>
   Guerrero state secretary Humberto Salgado said 94 people died
Thursday in Acapulco  &MD;  most of them drowned by flash floods.
<p>
   Authorities appealed for help for Acapulco, which the federal
government declared a disaster area. The beach resort had run out
of gasoline, drinking water, food, clothing, medicines and many
more essentials.
<p>
   ``This is a very sad day,'' said Gov. Angel Aguirre of Guerrero
state, home to Acapulco, where Pauline sent torrents of rainwater
raging through streets. Aguirre said at least five other people
were killed elsewhere in the state, adding, ``We don't recall a
hurricane ever having caused such damage.''
<p>
   In neighboring Oaxaca state, where Pauline first struck with 184
kph (115-mph) winds a day earlier, state government spokesman
Leandro Hernandez confirmed 19 deaths, 15 people missing and
thousands of homeless.
<p>
   ``The figure could still rise,'' said Hernandez, speaking with
The Associated Press by telephone from the state, where powerful
Pauline ripped makeshift homes away and badly damaged such resorts
as Puerto Angel.
<p>
   Fueled by the warm El Nino ocean currents, Pauline powered
towering waves  &MD;  10 meters (30 feet) tall on exposed coasts  &MD;  that
pounded Acapulco's pristine beaches to a maelstrom of trash and
twisted lounge chairs.
<p>
   Heavy rains turned streets into roaring rivers of debris. Water
swept boulders the size of cars down the hills and flipped vehicles
like toys, catching some with lights still on, their doors
underwater. A coastal highway skirting the famed beaches teemed
with raging water, and one man's body stuck from the mud, arms
outstretched and mouth agape.
<p>
   ``If Pauline survives, it could become a potential threat to the
Gulf of California and adjacent areas within the next day or two,''
hurricane center forecaster Max Mayfield said.
<p>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, on a state visit to Germany, ordered
army troops into stricken areas along a long stretch of coast.
Troops in Humvees poured into Acapulco by the hundreds to secure
areas around homes wrecked by raging floods.
<p>
   TV footage showed bodies mired in the mud. Jaime Herandez, who
lives in the hills near Acapulco, said police took away at least
seven bodies after mud and water came rushing down before dawn.
<p>
   ``We've got rain coming down, mudslides blocking roads. Houses
have fallen, walls are down,'' Red Cross spokesman Marco Antonio
Santiago said.
<p>
   There were no reports of casualties among tourists. Many
foreigners huddled in hotels while hundreds of Mexicans up and down
the coast remained in emergency shelters.
<p>
   ``You feel bad for the people  &MD;  there's so much poverty and it's
the off-season and now this,'' said Joyce Walton, a 33-year-old
tourist from Chicago.
<p>
   Acapulco's deadliest drama unfolded in working neighborhoods on
the hills above the five-star ocean-front hotels as a 12-meter-wide
(40-foot-wide) torrent tumbled toward the sea.
<p>
   ``We felt our apartment building tremble because of the rocks
the river was throwing against the foundations,'' said Elilasio
Garcia, 22, who escaped one 10-story concrete building when a
nearly dry gulch sprang to life.
<p>
   Hundreds of modest homes of cement and wood tottered and
collapsed into floodwaters and knee-deep torrents raced down many
streets closer to Acapulco's beach, rushing to the sea.
<p>
   Hurricane Pauline barreled ashore near Huatulco in Oaxaca state
on Wednesday, blowing down plywood homes.
<p>
   In a public housing project in Huatulco, children drew water
from a dirty canal using buckets after the canal overflowed its
banks and sent a meter (3 feet) of mud into homes there.
<p>
   ``The water took away everything,'' said Rosaura Aguilar
Ramirez, 38. ``It took our clothes. It took our dishes.
Everything.''
<p>
   She threw a muddy rag into the yard. ``My daughter's dress,''
she said.
<p>
   In Puerto Angel, where Pauline first rumbled ashore on
Wednesday, many houses that weren't made of concrete were washed
away, said Federico Velazquez, a federal highway police official in
radio contact with that city. Waves tore away the beach of the
Huatulco Sheraton.
<p>
   Forecasters said El Nino, a phenomenon in which unusually warm
waters disrupt weather patterns, apparently was to blame for the
high number of powerful Pacific hurricanes this year.

<p>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  Papua New Guinea officials and
the warring parties on the secessionist island of Bougainville
signed a truce Friday at the close of their second round of peace
talks.
<p>
   After 10 days of talks by almost 100 Papua New Guinea and
Bougainville island officials and rebels at the New Zealand army
camp in Burnham, they unanimously agreed to the accord.
<p>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, who has helped broker
the talks, said he was delighted to hear ``three very beautiful
words: The Burnham Truce.''
<p>
   Martin Miriori, a rebel spokesman, said it meant the islanders
could begin to build a lasting truce.
<p>
   ``But it is another step on a long and difficult road that we
are committed to travel together,'' he said.
<p>
   The agreement also recommended that Papua New Guinea's national
government and leaders on Bougainville immediately invite a neutral
regional peacekeeping group to monitor the terms of the truce.
<p>
   The parties agreed to respect and promote basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms, to refrain from all acts of intimidation and
armed confrontation, and to promote peace and reconciliation.
<p>
   The truce also agrees to restore freedom of movement and
delivery of services to the people of Bougainville, subject to
appropriate clearances. The island has been blockaded for years by
the Papua New Guinea government, preventing food and medicines from
being imported.
<p>
   Papua New Guinea military commanders, resistance and village
chiefs are asked to meet regularly to consult, review and monitor
the implementation of the truce.
<p>
   They are also required to resolve any incidents which may
threaten or breach these understandings.
<p>
   Bougainville island leaders themselves signed a historic accord
in July, calling for a cease-fire and an end to the bitter war on
the Papua New Guinea island, which has continued for nine years.
<p>
   But Papua New Guinea central government officials were not
involved in the first round of talks.
<p>
   Further talks expected before Dec. 31 will focus on the
composition of a multinational Pacific peacekeeping force to
monitor the cease-fire.
<p>
   The small but mineral-rich Pacific island, home to about 160,000
people, has been torn by a bloody civil war since 1988.
<p>
   Thousands have died in the bloody civil conflict on Bougainville
since landowners revolted in 1989 over the royalties they received
and environmental damage caused by the huge part-Australian owned
Panguna copper mine.

BC-FEATURE-India-Shaping History,0772
50 years later, India still coming to terms with history
AP Photo DEL101
By RANJAN ROY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Every Indian high school student knows
the emperors who won the ancient wars and the independence leaders
such as Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru who mobilized millions
to brave British clubs.
<p>
   But a new generation of scholars say India's history should be
seen from below. Their quest is for a history that focuses more on
ordinary people, though without ignoring larger issues.
<p>
   The movement that found its greatest expression far from India  &MD; 
at Oxford and other British universities  &MD;  began to emerge a decade
ago. Its gurus, such as historians Ranajit Guha, at Oxford, and
David Arnold, at the London School of Oriental and African Studies,
and even later converts such as novelist Amitav Ghosh, live and
teach overseas.
<p>
   The latest wave of revisionists see ``history as one of
exploitation by the elite, Indian as well as British,'' says
Indivar Kamtekar, a Cambridge-trained professor at New Delhi's
Jawaharlal Nehru University.
<p>
   They call themselves the chroniclers of the subalterns  &MD;  the
foot soldiers  &MD;  and look not only at how society is divided by
class, but at the role culture and history play in shaping
identity. Proponents say the Marxist analysis still popular in
India is insufficient because it often ignores rivalries within
classes and issues of gender and ethnicity.
<p>
   They're not the first to try rewriting the story of India  &MD; 
British colonialists and Indian nationalists and Marxists all have
had versions.
<p>
   The British often portrayed Indian culture as backward. The
Marxists, Kamtekar said, had too narrow a view, seeing everything
in terms of capital and class. And the nationalists, he said, made
it appear the entire country owed its independence to just a few
towering figures.
<p>
   ``Many other actors have arisen during the freedom movement,''
Kamtekar said.
<p>
   But the old guard says it is too early to start questioning
heroes and moving away from the nationalist history that has
predominated since the 1950s.
<p>
   The nationalist school sees Gandhi and his Congress Party as the
vanguard that mobilized Indians against British rule known as the
Raj, but the revisionists view Congress as just another political
group vying for power.
<p>
   ``The Congress ... while fighting the Raj was also becoming the
Raj, foreshadowing the great but incomplete transformation of
1947,'' writes Sumit Sarkar, one of the movement's early theorists.
<p>
   Sarkar believes the Congress Party, with its ties to big
business and its middle class members, actually diluted a radical
movement that could have led to fundamental social change.
<p>
   The new debate has so far been confined to the pages of journals
catering to elite scholars. It is too early to erase nationalist
history, says Ravinder Kumar, director of the Nehru Memorial
Library, India's premier history research institute.
<p>
   ``We need sustenance. We still need heroes,'' Kumar said.''The
message of nationalism is that all Indians are the same and have a
common past.''
<p>
   In the high school and undergraduate classrooms where most
Indians learn their history, textbooks still overwhelmingly
concentrate on the role of Gandhi's Indian National Congress in
shaping the freedom struggle. Such nationalist history sought to
bring together an India fragmented by caste, language and religion.
<p>
   In the 1960s, the government created a special department to
design textbooks for schools and universities, ``something that
would promote national integration and unity,'' says Indira Arjan
Dev of the National Council for Educational Research and Training.
<p>
   The subaltern historians work by examining blips and incidents,
for example a death of a low-caste woman who was forced to undergo
an abortion in the late 19th century.
<p>
   Ranajit Guha's essay on Chandra's death after an illicit affair
is a moment in the everyday life of a village that, on close
inspection, reveals how caste, religion and hierarchy operated.
<p>
   Others have examined the role of strikes in factories during the
independence struggle and the protests of peasants against British
land and revenue laws, giving prominence to obscure events and
players.
<p>
   Historians have been fussing over what has been ever since the
British left. The latest chapter  &MD;  pitting those who say India
needs heroes against those who say attention must be paid to the
common man  &MD;  is likely to be followed by more rewrites as this
young country shapes its past and its future.

BC-FEATURE-Bangladesh-Fighting Hunger,0783
Homemade snacks counter malnutrition
By FARID HOSSAIN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GABTALI, Bangladesh (AP)  &MD;  Inside a mud-and-thatch hut, Khairun
grinds fistfuls of toasted rice into powder. Working rhythmically
she turns to another earthen bowl, this one of toasted lentils. A
packet of molasses lies nearby.
<p>
   These simple ingredients are saving lives in Bangladesh, a
country where at least 500 children starve to death every day. They
are the menu of a new nutrition program that also offers employment
to women such as Khairun, who earn extra money packing the rice and
lentils toasted with iodized salt and the molasses into plastic
packets of supplements, each providing 150 calories and rich in
protein and vitamins A and C.
<p>
   In the nine months since the pilot program began in Gabtali, an
area of more than 200 villages, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of
Dhaka, severe malnourishment disappeared among children, said
Mujibur Rahman, an official of a local aid agency helping run the
government project.
<p>
   Nine months ago, staff of the World Bank-funded project had
identified 2,712 malnourished children younger than 2 in Gabtali.
Volunteer health workers visited the toddlers' families to offer
the free pusti  &MD;  ``snack''  &MD;  packets and instructions on how to mix
the dry ingredients with a little boiled water and oil and shape
the resulting paste into tasty balls.
<p>
   The balls, similar to the snacks Bangladeshis often eat with tea
or coffee, are much more likely to appeal to the local palate than
the high-protein biscuits used to combat hunger in other parts of
the world.
<p>
   The snacks are meant to supplement the typical Bangladeshi's
diet of rice, lentils, fish and garden vegetables. Half of the
country's 120 million people can't afford enough to eat every day,
the World Bank says.
<p>
   The children of Gabtali were each given two packets a day for
three months  &MD;  for very young children, more water is added to turn
the dry ingredients into a porridge. Malnourished pregnant women
were also sought out, and given four packets a day for nine months.
<p>
   Two months after she conceived her first child, Monwara, a
16-year-old who like many Bangladeshis uses only one name, started
suffering headaches, dizziness and loss of appetite.
<p>
   Her family noticed nothing unusual, she said, but a neighbor
trained as a volunteer with the feeding project was concerned. She
took Monwara to one of the 177 nutrition centers in the area, where
health workers put her on the extra 600 calories a day.
<p>
   ``I'm happy,'' she says now, flashing a shy smile.
<p>
   According to World Bank figures, infant mortality in Bangladesh
 &MD;  103 babies die out of every 1,000 births  &MD;  is the highest in
South Asia. Malnutrition is responsible for about two-thirds of the
deaths of children under 5.
<p>
   At least 33 percent of Bangladeshi children under 6 are severely
stunted and another 31 percent moderately stunted. More than 68
percent of the children are underweight and nearly 17 percent
wasted, the highest of such bleak figures in South Asia.
<p>
   The hungry are stunted in size and mental development,
vulnerable to disease, incapable of productive work. The World Bank
estimates malnutrition will cost Bangladesh up to dlrs 22 billion
dollars in lost productivity over the next 10 years.
<p>
   In 1995, the Health and Family Welfare Ministry announced it
would launch the six-year Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project
at a cost of dlrs 67.3 million, 89 percent of that loaned at low
interest from the World Bank's International Development Agency.
<p>
   The project began in Gabtali and five other areas, and will
start expanding to another 34 areas by the end of next year. Four
years from now, when nutrition centers are established in all 40
initial areas, 10 percent of the country will be covered. Expansion
nationwide depends on the success of the pilot projects, and
officials are encouraged by early results.
<p>
   Community health workers visit families to spread the word and
paste up posters with pictures of malnourished children. They are
particularly on the lookout for girls, because they are often fed
less in a country where boys are more prized.
<p>
   Village women like Khairun have been formed into groups of 11
for every nutrition center to make packets and sell them to the
program for 2.30 takas (about 2 U.S. cents) each.
<p>
   Khairun, working with neighbor Rameeza Khatton, earned 80 takas
(about dlrs 2) in one two-week period, a significant sum in a
country where the average per capita weekly earning is about dlrs
10.
<p>
   ``It did not take longer than three hours to earn this money,''
Khatton said.

Brazil beats Morocco 2-0 in exhibition game
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BELEM, Brazil (AP)  &MD;  Denilson led a Brazilian team with few of
its star players to a 2-0 win over Morocco in an exhibition game
Thursday evening.
<p>
   After a penalty kick by Dodo hit the post early in the first
half, the Brazilian team could mount only lackluster plays against
a tight and aggressive Moroccan team.
<p>
   The Moroccan's dominated the field through much of the first
half and twice it fell to Brazil's goalie Taffarel to save the
team. The half ended with a final shot by Juninho going just wide
of the goal and leaving both teams scoreless.
<p>
   Brazil exploded in the second half, mounting a series of strong
plays but the jeering crowd was not silenced until Densilon fired a
shot from outside the area and straight down the middle, which
Moroccan goalie Benzekri failed to stop in the 35th minute.
<p>
   It was Denilson again with a penalty kick in the 43rd that
sealed the win and game ended with almost no extra time.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Brazil: Taffarel, Cafu (Russo), Junior Baiano, Goncalves
(Cleber), Ze Roberto, Ze Elias, Emerson, Juninho, Denilson, Dodo
(Christian) and Donizete.
<p>
   Morocco: Benzekri, Hadrioui (Abrami), Nekrouz, Naybet, Saber,
Chippo, Azzouri, Tahar, Hadji, Fertout and Raghab.

Moderate quake hits off northern Japan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 5.2 hit off the coast of northern Japan early Friday, but there
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
<p>
   The quake, at 5:42 a.m. (2042 GMT Thursday), was roughly 40
kilometers (25 miles) under the sea and just off the southwest
coast of the northern island of Hokkaido, the Meteorological Agency
said.
<p>
   No warnings were issued for tsunami, undersea waves triggered by
volcanic activity or earthquakes.
<p>
   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause damage to homes if it
occurs in a residential area.
<p>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Philippine car sales fall 7 percent in first nine months
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines declined 7 percent to 61,175 in the first nine months
of the year compared to a year earlier.
<p>
   In September alone, car sales totaled 5,349, down 25 percent
from the previous month and 28 percent from a year earlier.
<p>
   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines
attributed the decline to higher interest rates that resulted from
the weaker peso and the slower approval period for the processing
of car loans.
<p>
   The dollar has appreciated around 32 percent against the peso
since July 11, when the central bank abandoned an expensive defense
of the local currency and allowed it to trade in a wider range. On
Thursday the dollar averaged 34.852 pesos.

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  Rescuers struggled Friday to keep
20 surviving pilot whales alive after a large group ran aground for
the second time on New Zealand's remote far north coast early in
the morning.
<p>
   The whales were ``very distressed, very confused,'' said
Conservation Department spokeswoman Wanda Vivequin. Nineteen of the
39 whales that ran aground about 2 a.m. Friday had since died.
<p>
   The group was part of a large pod of about 100 whales that
beached themselves on Wednesday afternoon, of which 53 died the
same day at Karikari Bay in Northland.
<p>
   The surviving 48 were refloated Thursday and guided out to sea
but most became confused and stranded themselves about a half-mile
(1 km) further north of the original site.
<p>
   Vivequin said Project Jonah staff, local volunteers and
Conservation Department staff were with the surviving whales and
would try to put them back to sea on the high tide Friday
afternoon.
<p>
   ``At the end of the day we can only do what we can,'' she said.
<p>
   The whales, each up to eight meters (yards) in length and
weighing up to 1.5 tons (1,500 kilos), were believed to have been
migrating south into Antarctic waters.

New Zealand telecommunications companies pitch for business in
Asia
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  Ten New Zealand
telecommunications companies are part of a mission later this month
to China, Taiwan and South Korea aimed at increasing exports to
these booming economies.
<p>
   The mission is being organized by TradeNZ and participants
include Deltec NZ, Digi-tech, Exicom Technologies, MAS Technology,
Paragon Solutions, Telecom, Telemedia Asia and Televox
International.
<p>
   Asia-based agents of Swichtec Power Systems and Tait Electronics
will also join the group. Swichtec has a manufacturing operation in
China and Tait Electronics is a major supplier of radio systems,
including to a number of police districts in Shanghai.
<p>
   TradeNZ's North Asia senior trade commissioner Eugene Bowen said
China in particular offers the greatest potential for New Zealand
telecommunications exports.
<p>
   China has experienced explosive growth in telecommunications
over the past decade. The number of telephone lines has increased
from just 4.35 million in 1980 to 93.19 million lines in 1996.
<p>
   Mobile telephone networks have also rapidly expanded, up from 10
million subscribers in 1992 to over 93 million last year. China now
has one phone for every 22.4 people.

<p>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP)  &MD;  A 16-year-old youth charged with
murdering a Japanese tourist in Cairns will be transferred to a
Brisbane youth detention center to be closer to his family.
<p>
   The teen-ager, who cannot legally be named, had been ordered
jailed until Dec. 19 when he appeared in Cairns Children's Court
earlier this week charged with the murder of 22-year old Michiko
Okuyama, whose battered body was found dumped in a swamp.
<p>
   A Queensland Corrective Services Commission spokesman said
Friday that the mother of the accused youth lived north of
Brisbane, and a decision had been made to transfer the youth from
north Queensland to a youth detention center in suburban Brisbane.
<p>
   Okuyama, who was visiting Cairns on a scuba diving holiday, was
cremated Wednesday. Her family intends to scatter her ashes over
the Great Barrier Reef before flying home to Yokohama.
<p>
   Her parents and two brothers have been inundated with flowers
and cards by Cairns locals shocked at the murder and are said to
have been touched by the reaction to their daughter's death.

Philippine peso continues strong gains
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  The Philippine peso extended its
strong previous-day gains Friday, hitting two volatility limits in
early trading marked by strong central bank intervention.
<p>
   Stocks, meanwhile, advanced as investors, encouraged by the
stronger peso, picked up bargain shares, traders said.
<p>
   Dealers said the central bank's recent tightening of rules on
dollar purchases and improvements in the regional currency
situation were boosting the peso.
<p>
   The peso averaged 33.501 pesos per dollar in early trading
compared to 34.852 pesos Thursday.
<p>
   The peso quickly hit a series of two volatility limits, setting
off cooling-off periods during which trades outside the limits are
not allowed. If the peso hits a third volatility limit, all trading
will be suspended for the day.
<p>
   Traders said the central bank came into the market early in the
session, offering dollars for 34.10 pesos and then 33.263 pesos in
less than 45 minutes of dealing.
<p>
   A system of volatility bands was introduced early this week to
curb recent sharp fluctuations in the peso-dollar rate. Each time a
limit is hit, trading is suspended for 30 minutes to an hour for
all trades outside that band.
<p>
   On the stock market, the 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 36.43 points, or 1.8 percent, in early trading to
2,041.93. On Thursday it surged 58.67 points or 3 percent.

   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Hurricane Pauline struck Mexico's most
famous tourist resort with devastating fury, unleashing deadly
torrents that swept people, cars and boulders toward ravaged
Pacific beaches before being downgraded to a tropical storm.
<p>
   At least 118 people were killed in the states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero Thursday, and twice that number were reported injured.
Dozens were missing. Floods and mud slides were rampant, and damage
was extensive.
<p>
   All ports were closed from Tapachula, near the Guatemalan
border, to Acapulco. Air traffic was suspended. Power was out
through most of the coast, and telephone service was spotty.
<p>
   The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said at 0000 GMT that Pauline
was centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Playa Azul in
Guerrero state, and moving northwest at 20 kph (13 mph). Winds had
dropped to 112 kph (70 mph)  &MD;  below hurricane level of 119 kph (74
mph).
<p>
   But heavy flood warnings remained in effect.
<p>
   Guerrero state secretary Humberto Salgado said 94 people died
Thursday in Acapulco  &MD;  most of them drowned by flash floods.
<p>
   Late Thursday the bodies of the victims were brought to the
Acapulco morgue as they were dug out of the mud heaps or collapsed
buildings. The contorted, mud-stained cadavers were laid out in
rows in the patio.
<p>
   ``My god this is hard,'' said Julio Rodriguez, looking for his
father taxi-driver father-in-law, missing since the morning. ``They
are unrecognizable.''
<p>
   Felix Gonzalez, secretary to the city hall, said so far 65
bodies were laid out for identification. ``We think there are more
... we're still looking in some mud slides.''
<p>
   Police said they expected more bodies to turn up in the next two
days.

BC-Spain-Opera Comeback,0728
After delays and bad luck, Madrid's opera house to reopen in gala
event
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  When the Teatro Real's magnificent
chandelier came crashing down two years ago, many saw it as the
final straw for Madrid's opera house whose history is pockmarked
with blunders, artistic disputes, architectural errors and
wholesale mismanagement.
<p>
   But on Saturday, 72 years after the last opera was performed in
the building, the curtain will rise on an extravagant refurbishment
project aimed at placing Madrid back on the operatic map, alongside
New York, Milan and Vienna.
<p>
   The reforms cost 21 billion pesetas (dlrs 140 million), more
than four times the initial estimate, and have taken five years
longer than expected to complete.
<p>
   ``The theater has had an unfortunate history,'' Teatro Real
manager Juan Cambreleng said in an interview. ``But while a
theater's problems are never really over, a new era is opening up
now, and expectations are high.''
<p>
   Back in 1850, Spain's Queen Isabel II inaugurated the Teatro
Real as an opera house with Donizetti's ``La Favorita.''
<p>
   This weekend, King Juan Carlos will oversee the reopening. It
will feature the all-Spanish production of Manuel de Falla's ``El
Sombrero de Tres Picos'' (The Three-cornered Hat) and ``La Vida
Breve'' (The Short Life), starring tenor Jaime Aragall and soprano
Maria Jose Montiel. Hundreds of politicians, society figures and
other luminaries will attend the black-tie affair.
<p>
   The theater's reopening has been long awaited by opera signers
and aficionados alike.
<p>
   ``After all this time and so much speculation I have to admit I
never thought I would sing in the Teatro Real,'' world-renowned
tenor Placido Domingo told the daily El Mundo this week.
<p>
   ``Now it's a reality and I can hardly express my happiness, as a
citizen of Madrid, as a Spaniard and as a musician, because this is
a great event,'' Domingo said.
<p>
   Domingo  &MD;  who has achieved broad fame as one of the Three
Tenors, alongside Luciano Pavarotti and fellow Spaniard Jose
Carreras  &MD;  debuts in the theater with a world premier of the
Spanish work ``Divinas Palabras'' (Divine Words) by Anton Garcia
Abril on Oct. 18.
<p>
   Season tickets for the 1,630-seat theater were sold out in three
days.
<p>
   Built on a tributary of Madrid's Manzanares River, the theater
first opened its doors in 1708. After several reconstruction
projects, many forced by its fluvial location, it was formerly
inaugurated as an opera house in 1850.
<p>
   In following decades, it ranked among Europe's leading opera
centers, meriting a visit by Verdi in 1863 for the premier of ``The
Force of Destiny.''
<p>
   But the building fell into disrepair, and it was closed in 1925.
It reopened in 1966, but no serious refurbishing had been
undertaken and the building was considered unfit to stage a proper
opera. Only concerts were held there, with operas having to be
staged elsewhere in Madrid.
<p>
   In 1988, Spain's Culture Ministry decided to give Madrid its own
opera house once again.
<p>
   And that's when the problems resumed.
<p>
   Spiraling construction costs, architectural changes and
disagreements among national, regional and municipal authorities
eventually saw the refurbishing price zoom and the theater's
opening delayed time and time again.
<p>
   ``There's been a lot of controversy, mainly because there has
been a lack of clarity in ideas, and because some have seen the
theater as a place to play out their ambitions in search of
glory,'' said Cambreleng.
<p>
   It also appeared the old opera house was jinxed.
<p>
   In 1992, the architect for the theater's renovation, Jose Manuel
Gonzalez de Valcarcel, died of a heart attack while showing
journalists around the site.
<p>
   In 1995, the two-ton chandelier crashed down on the front-row
seats which, fortunately, were vacant.
<p>
   Now, all is set for the long-awaited opening. Fingers are
crossed against further problems occurring.
<p>
   ``Hopefully that's all finished with now,'' Cambreleng said.
<p>
   Cambreleng plans nine operas this season, including Mozart's
Figaro in January and Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera next March.
<p>
   Also planned are five ballets, including the Covent Garden Royal
Ballet version of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty in November,
numerous recitals and symphony concerts.

Sabres 5, Capitals 2
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUFFALO, New York (AP)  &MD;  Jason Dawe scored twice as the Buffalo
Sabres handed the Washington Capitals their first loss of the
season, 5-2 Thursday night.
<p>
   The Capitals had won their first four games, matching the
1991-92 start for the best in franchise history.
<p>
   Dawe scored Buffalo's first power-play goal this season after 19
misfires when he broke a 1-1 tie in the second period, and he
scored the game-winner 57 seconds into the third period.
<p>
   Erik Rasmussen, Miroslav Satan and Randy Burridge also scored
for the Sabres, who came out flat before putting together their
best performance this season.
<p>
   Dominik Hasek made 29 saves for Buffalo, giving up only goals to
Mark Tinordi and Calle Johansson.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Penguins 1 &QC; 
<p>
   In Philadelphia, Chris Joseph scored with 8:03 left in the third
period to lead Philadelphia over Pittsburgh and end the Flyers'
two-game losing streak.
<p>
   Joseph, who signed with Philadelphia as a free agent this year,
took a pass from Eric Lindros and fired a slap shot between the
pads of Pittsburgh goaltender Tom Barrasso to snap a 1-1 tie. The
goal was his first of the season.
<p>
   Shjon Podein and Lindros also scored for the Flyers, who sent
the Penguins to their third straight defeat and seventh consecutive
loss in Philadelphia dating to the 1993-94 season. Kevin Hatcher
scored for Pittsburgh.

Philippine president in good health, doctor says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  President Ramos is in good health and
can travel abroad next week, his doctor said Friday.
<p>
   Ramos' doctor, Raul Fores, said the president is healthier than
he was last December when he had an operation to remove a
life-threatening blockage in an artery carrying blood to the brain.
<p>
   A member of the presidential press staff said Fores reported
that Ramos' cholesterol level was ``very low'' and his weight was
down to 151 pounds from 165 pounds when he had the operation.
<p>
   Ramos, 69, entered the Makati Medical Center at around 6 a.m.
wearing athletic shoes, green shorts and a white sleeveless shirt.
<p>
   He checked out about three hours later and went straight to a
military air base where he took a plane for central Cebu City where
he was to address a business meeting.
<p>
   Ramos leaves on Monday for a trip to Hong Kong, Laos and Burma.
The latter two countries are the newest partners of the Philippines
in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which also includes
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
<p>
   Ramos often keeps a grueling schedule and holds many Cabinet
meetings outside the capital.
<p>
   He also is the most traveled Philippine president, having made
35 foreign trips to more than 40 countries since taking office in
June 1992.

Warring parties agree to cease-fire on Bougainville
Eds: Updates with New Zealand foreign minister saying pace process
about half complete.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  Papua New Guinea officials and
the warring parties on the secessionist island of Bougainville
signed a truce Friday at the close of their second round of peace
talks.
<p>
   After 10 days of talks by almost 100 Papua New Guinea and
Bougainville island officials and rebels at the New Zealand army
camp in Burnham, they unanimously agreed to the accord.
<p>
   New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, who has helped broker
the talks, said he was delighted to hear ``three very beautiful
words: The Burnham Truce.''
<p>
   Martin Miriori, a rebel spokesman, said it meant the islanders
could begin to build a lasting truce.
<p>
   ``But it is another step on a long and difficult road that we
are committed to travel together,'' he said.
<p>
   The agreement also recommended that Papua New Guinea's national
government and leaders on Bougainville immediately invite a neutral
regional peacekeeping group to monitor the terms of the truce.
<p>
   The parties agreed to respect and promote basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms, to refrain from all acts of intimidation and
armed confrontation, and to promote peace and reconciliation.
<p>
   The truce also agrees to restore freedom of movement and
delivery of services to the people of Bougainville, subject to
appropriate clearances. The island has been blockaded for years by
the Papua New Guinea government, preventing food and medicines from
being imported.
<p>
   Papua New Guinea military commanders, resistance and village
chiefs are asked to meet regularly to consult, review and monitor
the implementation of the truce.
<p>
   They are also required to resolve any incidents which may
threaten or breach these understandings.
<p>
   McKinnon later told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, ``We've
still got a way to go. We're still looking at having a leaders'
meeting and an agreement for a cease-fire, we're still looking at
implementation of the cease-fire.
<p>
   ``And then, of course, getting on to the reconstruction program.
So we're probably only about halfway there.''
<p>
   Bougainville island leaders themselves signed a historic accord
in July, calling for a cease-fire and an end to the bitter war on
the Papua New Guinea island, which has continued for nine years.
<p>
   But Papua New Guinea central government officials were not
involved in the first round of talks.
<p>
   Further talks expected before Dec. 31 will focus on the
composition of a multinational Pacific peacekeeping force to
monitor the cease-fire.
<p>
   The small but mineral-rich Pacific island, home to about 160,000
people, has been torn by a bloody civil war since 1988.
<p>
   Thousands have died in the bloody civil conflict on Bougainville
since landowners revolted in 1989 over the royalties they received
and environmental damage caused by the huge part-Australian owned
Panguna copper mine.

<p>
   UNION JUAREZ, Mexico (AP)  &MD;  Storms and two hurricanes for the
past two weeks have damaged as much as 20 percent of the coffee
crop in the southern state of Chiapas, Mexico's biggest coffee
producer, growers say.
<p>
   First came Olaf, then Pauline this week, with several associated
storms, dumping rain just as the deep red coffee berries started
reaching their peak. The almost-constant rain fostered fungus and
disease or knocked the berries to the ground.
<p>
   In Union Juarez near the Guatemala border, agronomist Jaime
Mendez picked up green berries from the ground. The fruit, like
those remaining on the slender branches of the tall, leafy bushes
in a damp coffee grove, had already started to blacken with rot.
<p>
   ``Phew, they stink. These are useless,'' Mendez said. ``And see
that little black bug? That's broca (screwworm). It will bore into
the bean to lay its eggs, and soon this whole grove will be
infested.''
<p>
   Chiapas was expected to produce 2.2 million sacks of 132 pounds
(60 kilos) each this season  &MD;  about one-third of the national
harvest of 6.6 million sacks, according to the government.
<p>
   Growers in Chiapas' fertile coastal mountains, which produce
about two-thirds of the state's coffee, estimated statewide losses
up to 20 percent. Furthermore, some growers disputed the official
harvest predictions.
<p>
   ``Officials inflate the figures. Chiapas couldn't have produced
more than 1.8 million sacks before the rains, and even less now,''
said Jesus Orantes Aramoni, president of the 700 small growers with
the Chiapas State Coffee Producers Union.
<p>
   Orantes instead predicted a 20-percent loss for an after-rain
harvest of about 1.44 million sacks.
<p>
   Mendez predicted losses of only 10 percent, but said it was too
soon to know the extent of the damage.
<p>
   ``And the quality for export will be less than usual,'' Orantes
added.
<p>
   Damage during this season could also affect future harvests as
mudslides take land out of operation for at least four years, and
rotting fruit becomes a haven for plant-damaging fungus and
insects, said Carlos Felipe Gonzalez, a local grower with 10 acres
(4 hectares) of high-yield coffee.
<p>
   But Chiapas Agriculture and Cattle Secretary Roberto Coutino, in
nearby Cacahoatan for the First International Coffee Fair, played
down the damage Thursday.
<p>
   ``There are 571,000 acres (231,000 hectares) of coffee in
Chiapas. Only about 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) are affected, so
there isn't much to worry about,'' Coutino said. ``In reality,
there are no coffee losses.''
<p>
   Help for affected growers will come through already-existing
state plans to pour dlrs 4.5 million (35 million pesos) into
growing new plants, usually of higher-producing varieties than
those already found on many coffee farms, Coutino said.
<p>
   That assistance follows dlrs 6.8 million in general assistance
to state coffee growers this year, Coutino said.
<p>
   For day-laborers like Nicolas Morales Martin, however, there
will be no help.
<p>
   The 47-year-old Guatemalan crosses the border into Mexico each
year to pick coffee, which helps support his family of eight
people. But since the rains, he has harvested only about half his
usual pickings, earning dlrs 2.50 (20 pesos) a day.
<p>
   ``That doesn't buy anything,'' Morales said.

Singapore prime minister appeals libel verdict
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is appealing a
court verdict that awarded him 20,000 dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,903) in
libel damages from an opposition politician, it was reported
Friday.
<p>
   Goh had asked for 200,000 dollars (U.S. dlrs 129,032) from
Workers' Party leader J.B. Jeyaretnam for statements he made at an
election campaign rally in January.
<p>
   Quoting legal sources, The Straits Times said the appeal filed
on Wednesday would likely come before the Court of Appeal in
February or March. There was no immediate information on the
grounds for the prime minister's action.
<p>
   Jeyaretnam has said he has not decided whether to appeal the
ruling announced Sept. 29.
<p>
   The International Commission of Jurists said the verdict did
little to improve the reputation of Singapore courts, which are
seen as being compliant toward the ruling People's Action Party.
<p>
   Another human rights group, Amnesty International, said the
verdict could inhibit freedom of expression and deter those seeking
to express dissenting political opinions peacefully.
<p>
   In awarding Goh a tenth of the damages he sought, Justice S.
Rajendran also ordered Jeyaretnam to pay 60 percent of the legal
costs incurred by the prime minister and 10 other leaders of the
PAP, who also sued. The damages to be collected by the other
plaintiffs are still to be assessed.
<p>
   The case stemmed from a campaign dispute between PAP leaders and
Jeyaretnam's party colleague, Tang Liang Hong. Tang had objected to
Goh and others calling the prime minister an ``anti-Christian,
Chinese chauvinist'' and accusing the group of lying about him.
<p>
   In a separate but related defamation case, Tang was ordered to
pay a record 8.08 million dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.2 million) to Goh,
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and 10 others. This case is now on
appeal.
<p>
   Tang fled the country after the election and many of his assets
have been seized.
<p>
   Jeyaretnam, who acted as one of Tang's defense lawyers in that
libel case, was sued for telling the rally:
<p>
   ``Mr. Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two police
reports he has made against, you know, Mr. Goh Chok Tong and his
people.''
<p>
   Jeyaretnam is one of three opposition voices in the 84-member
Parliament, and obtained his seat under a law which awards seats to
losers with the highest vote tally in order to provide at least
three opposition members in the legislature.

Philippine peso's strong gains force trading suspension
Eds: UPDATES with trading suspended for the day
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  The Philippine peso extended its
strong previous-day gains Friday, again hitting a 4 percent
volatility limit that forced trading to be halted for the rest of
the day.
<p>
   Stocks, meanwhile, advanced as investors, encouraged by the
stronger peso, picked up bargain shares, traders said.
<p>
   It was the second day that currency trading was halted before
the end of the day because of the peso's rapid rise.
<p>
   At mid morning, when trading was suspended, the peso averaged
33.104 pesos per dollar, compared to 34.852 pesos Thursday. The
peso reached a session-high of 32.930 pesos before trading was
halted.
<p>
   Dealers said intervention by the central bank, the recent
tightening of rules on dollar purchases, and improvements in the
regional currency situation boosted the peso.
<p>
   Traders said the central bank came into the market early in the
session, offering dollars for 34.10 pesos and then 33.263 pesos in
less than 45 minutes of dealing.
<p>
   Estimates put the central bank's dollar-selling activities at
around dlrs 15 million.
<p>
   A system of volatility bands was introduced early this week to
curb recent sharp fluctuations in the peso-dollar rate. Each time a
limit is hit, trading is suspended for 30 minutes to an hour for
all trades outside that band. However, hitting the third volatility
limit forces a complete halt to trading.
<p>
   On the stock market, the 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 36.43 points, or 1.8 percent, in early trading to
2,041.93. On Thursday it surged 58.67 points or 3 percent.
