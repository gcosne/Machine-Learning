Clinton Wraps Up Asian Trip, Defends Attention to Foreign Affairs
Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Clinton speech.
By TERENCE HUNT
AP White House Correspondent
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  President Clinton on Wednesday met
with Indonesian President Suharto and then challenged Republicans
who will run Congress to follow the tradition of bipartisanship in
foreign affairs.
<p>
   ``Partisanship stops at the water's edge,'' Clinton said,
quoting a former Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairman.
<p>
   Rejecting Republican efforts to delay a vote on a world trade
agreement, Clinton urged his newly strengthened opponents to join
with Democrats and ratify the pact before a new Congress takes
office in January.
<p>
   Clinton issued his plea in a speech prepared for delivery to
business leaders following his talks with Suharto, who has ruled
this country with a firm hand for 27 years.
<p>
   Clinton had said he would raise allegations of human rights
abuses with Suharto, but their talks also focussed on economics and
the new Asian pledge to break down trade barriers.
<p>
   The talks at Jakarta Palace wrapped up a three-day Clinton visit
in Indonesia, where leaders of 18 Asian and Pacific nations pledged
``free and open trade'' in the economically booming region by the
year 2020.
<p>
   In his prepared speech, Clinton urged Congress to approve a
sweeping world-trade agreement when it returns in a lame-duck
session later this month.
<p>
   Clinton said the accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), would open trade markets and produce high-wage jobs
that would help every American family.
<p>
   ``We've faced opposition to GATT from people in both parties,
but we've also had strong bipartisan support,'' the president said.
<p>
   ``I invite the new Republican leaders of Congress to ratify (the
late) Sen. (Arthur) Vandenburg's admonition that `partisanship
stops at the water's edge' and join me in doing what's right for
the American people,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   The underlying message from Vandenberg was that Democrats and
Republicans can squabble over domestic policy but should stand
united when it comes to foreign affairs.
<p>
   Just hours before Clinton spoke, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-S.C., the
incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, hinted he
would hinder Clinton's foreign policy initiatives unless the
president agreed to postpone the GATT vote under early next year,
when Republicans take over.
<p>
   White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said the
administration still wants GATT passed this year.
<p>
   Earlier, Clinton said that Tuesday's meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum produced a ``very historic declaration''
that would result in more U.S. high-wage jobs and sales overseas.
<p>
   ``What we are doing in this agreement is opening the
fastest-growing market in the world,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   A red-uniformed military band played the national anthems of
both countries as Clinton was welcomed in sultry weather to
Suharto's gleaming white palace.
<p>
   The president said Tuesday the United States must champion human
rights ``with both patience and determination, and we will.''
<p>
   Suharto, at a news conference Tuesday, refused to answer a
question about his human rights record. Human rights groups have
accused Suharto's authoritarian government of violently suppressing
dissidents and other abuses.
<p>
   With Clinton in town, students continued a sit-in on the parking
lot of the U.S. Embassy in protest against Indonesian rule of East
Timor. There also was a rowdy demonstration on the campus of East
Timor University in Dili, the provincial capital of East Timor.
<p>
   Clinton spent Tuesday in summit talks at the presidential palace
at Bogor, surrounded by lush gardens and ponds filled with huge
lily pads. Later, he held a news conference at a Jakarta hotel.
<p>
   After campaigning on a domestic agenda and accusing President
Bush of paying too much attention to foreign policy, Clinton
stoutly defended his frequent travels overseas.
<p>
   Foreign policy ventures have traditionally been a welcome
diversion for politically battered presidents. Clinton, however,
said his focus overseas was the result of progress in Middle East
peace talks, vital U.S. interests in Europe and his efforts to
expand foreign trade.
<p>
   Clinton does not expect to reduce his foreign involvements. He
announced he will go to Budapest for a European summit next month.
He is also expected to visit Haiti and to host a Latin American
summit in Miami.
<p>
   ``There have been more opportunities and more responsibilities
in this particular year than even I could have foreseen when I ran
for president,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   A president ``has a special responsibility'' to make sure
Americans do well in the global arena, he said. Nevertheless,
Clinton said, ``I expect that the lion's share of my work will
continue to be done at home ... We'll have to do both from now
on.''
<p>
   Even before Republicans captured control of Congress, Clinton
watched in frustration as lawmakers blocked his efforts to win
reforms in health insurance, lobbying laws and campaign financing.

   Shaquille O'Neal dominated at both ends of the court, getting 29
points and 13 rebounds as the Orlando Magic beat the Washington
Bullets 122-102 on Tuesday night in Orlando, Florida.
<p>
   O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer, also blocked five shots and
had six assists. Horace Grant added 21 points and 13 rebounds to
help the Magic avenge a season-opening loss to the Bullets.
<p>
   Rex Chapman, who beat the Magic with a shot at the buzzer in the
opener, led Washington with 17 points.
<p>
   Nick Anderson and Donald Royal had 18 points apiece and Anfernee
Hardaway 16 for Orlando. Scott Skiles, who had 11 assists, and
Kevin Duckworth scored 16 points each for the Bullets, who at 4-2
are off to their best start in five years. &QL; 
<p>
   In Atlanta, Stacey Augmon scored 27 points and Ken Norman added
19 points as the Atlanta Hawks routed the Boston Celtics and former
teammate Dominique Wilkins.
<p>
   Wilkins, the former Hawk now wearing Celtics green, managed only
16 points on 8-of-20 shooting as Atlanta, with five players in
double figures, never trailed after a 14-0 run gave the Hawks a
24-11 lead 7:36 into the game.
<p>
   Atlanta's biggest lead  &MD;  24 points  &MD;  was 78-54 when Jon Koncak
hit a three-point basket with 3:20 left in the third period. &QL; 
<p>
   In Miami, the Miami Heat, behind Harold Miner's 23 points,
earned their first victory of the season by beating Dallas.
<p>
   The win came after an 0-4 start, Miami's worst since its
inaugural season in 1988.
<p>
   Kevin Willis matched his season high with 24 points for Miami.
Glen Rice added 16.
<p>
   Jamal Mashburn, who scored 50 points Saturday against the
Chicago Bulls, had to settle for 24 against Miami. Jim Jackson had
25 for the Mavericks. &QL; 
<p>
   In Auburn Hills, Michigan, Joe Dumars scored seven of his 20
points in the final five minutes, and the Detroit Pistons hung on
to beat the Philadelphia 76ers.
<p>
   Detroit won despite missing three of eight free throws in the
final three minutes.
<p>
   Grant Hill led the Pistons with 22 points, and was followed by
Dumars. Willie Burton, who had six 3-pointers, came off the bench
to score 27, one short of his career high, and Clarence
Weatherspoon added 25. &QL; 
<p>
   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Derrick Coleman broke out of a
slump by hitting seven of his first eight shots and scoring 16 of
his 25 points in the first quarter to lead the New Jersey Nets past
the Seattle SuperSonics.
<p>
   Armon Gilliam added 19 points and Kevin Edwards 18 as New Jersey
opened a 20-point halftime lead in winning for only the second time
in seven games under new coach Butch Beard.
<p>
   The Sonics were hurt by 16 Nets' blocks, an NBA season-high.
Shawn Kemp led Seattle with 26 points and 13 rebounds. &QL; 
<p>
   In Cleveland, Chris Mills hit a desperate 3-pointer at the
buzzer in regulation and Tyrone Hill sank the go-ahead jumper in
overtime as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Charlotte Hornets
89-86 Tuesday night.
<p>
   Cleveland trailed by eight with three minutes left in regulation
and appeared all but out of it after Muggsy Bogues sank two foul
shots that put Charlotte ahead 78-75 with three seconds to go.
<p>
   After Mills sent the game into overtime, Hill's jumper with 37
seconds left gave Cleveland an 87-86 lead it never relinquished.
Hill led Cleveland with 22 points and his second consecutive
16-rebound game. Mills had 19 points and Mark Price scored 15.
<p>
   Alonzo Mourning scored 23 and Kenny Gattison 16 for the
Hornets. &QL; 
<p>
   In Denver, Robert Pack scored a career-high 30 points and the
Denver Nuggets held off a rally by the San Antonio Spurs to win
their fourth straight.
<p>
   Reserve forward Tom Hammonds scored 22 points, including 12 in
the fourth quarter. He hit his first six shots in the final period
after the Spurs had drawn within two points, 81-79, on Terry
Cummings' 16-footer barely a minute into the quarter.
<p>
   The Spurs, who saw their three-game winning streak end in their
first road game of the season, lost despite getting 33 points and
20 rebounds from David Robinson. &QL; 
<p>
   In Milwaukee, Glenn Robinson had his best night as a pro,
scoring 18 points as Milwaukee survived a second-half collapse to
edge Indiana.
<p>
   Todd Day blocked Byron Scott's desperation shot at the buzzer
after the Bucks turned the ball over with less than a second
remaining when Marty Conlon fumbled away an inbounds pass.
<p>
   Vin Baker and Day added 15 points each for the Bucks, who led by
as many as 26 points in the first half.
<p>
   Reggie Miller led Indiana with 17 points, but he missed a layup
with 30 seconds left that would have given the Pacers their first
lead of the game. &QL; 
<p>
   In Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon scored 28 points, helping the
Houston Rockets hold off Sacramento and extending their
season-opening winning streak to seven games.
<p>
   The Kings recovered from a slow start to take a 23-22 lead at
the end of the first quarter. Sacramento also led 47-45 at the half
and 76-75 going into the final quarter.
<p>
   Mitch Richmond, who averaged 24 points against the Rockets last
season, scored 29 points for the Kings, including 14 in the third
quarter. &QL;

Two Rebels Killed, But Guerrilla Cease-Fire Holding

<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Government troops shot dead two Tamil
rebels in separate confrontations, but the guerrilla's unilateral
cease-fire was holding in Sri Lanka, military officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   The rebels were killed during cordon and search operations in
eastern Batticaloa district Tuesday. Troops also recovered weapons,
ammunition, explosives and hand grenades, officials said.
<p>
   The rebels have not launched any attack since Saturday when
military intelligence intercepted messages that Tiger chief
Velupillai Prabhakaran had ordered his rebels to retaliate only if
attacked.
<p>
   No reason was given for the cease-fire, but Prabhakaran's order
came hours after Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in as president.
Mrs. Kumaratunga polled an overwhelming 62 percent of the vote on a
pledge to end the war.
<p>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga, the first woman to be president in Sri Lanka.
The 11-year-old war has claimed 34,000 lives.
<p>
   Tamils make up about 3 million of the country's 17 million
people and accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination. The
rebels want a separate nation in the north and east.

Budapest Ghetto Set Up 50 Years Ago
Eds: Also moved for AMs.
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)  &MD;  Fifty years ago, Julia Gati, her mother
and her 16-month-old son were rounded up with the rest of
Budapest's Jews and herded into a ghetto, where 20,000 people,
including her mother, died in the next two months.
<p>
   ``My mother died there, she starved to death,'' the 72-year-old
retired school teacher said on Tuesday, 50 years after Hungary's
Nazi puppet regime created the Budapest Ghetto. ``I have no idea
how we survived. It was a miracle.''
<p>
   The 50th anniversary passed almost unnoticed. Only one newspaper
 &MD;  the liberal Magyar Hirlap  &MD;  noted the date and what it meant to
the city. There were no official commemorations.
<p>
   The deputy leader of Hungary's Jewish community, Rabbi Ernoe
Lazarovits, said Jews would never commemorate such a hated date. He
said he wasn't even sure what day the barricades went up around
Budapest's Jewish quarter.
<p>
   World War II was almost over when fascists called the Arrow
Cross, opposed to the Hungarian government's attempt to end is
alliance with Nazi Germany, overthrew Regent Miklos Horthy.
<p>
   Together with the occupying Germans, they herded about 70,000 of
Budapest's Jews into the ghetto, set up around the main Budapest
synagogue.
<p>
   Between Nov. 15, 1944 and Jan. 18, 1945, when the Soviet army
liberated the ghetto, approximately 20,000 Jews died in the ghetto,
either of starvation, disease or exposure, or at the hands of gangs
working for the Arrow Cross regime.
<p>
   Before the ghetto was created, almost 90 percent of Hungary's
Jews had been sent to death camps after the German occupation began
in March 1944.
<p>
   ``We had no food, no water, no heating'' in the ghetto, Mrs.
Gati recalled in an interview with The Associated Press.
<p>
   Mrs. Gati's 66-year-old mother, Margit Kohn, died of starvation
in December 1944. ``But my son and I survived, thanks to the
Russians, who gave us food and drink,'' she said.
<p>
   The fact that her little son could survive such horror made Mrs.
Gati religious, which she had not been before the war.
<p>
   ``Until then I hadn't believed in God, but since that time I've
been a true believer,'' Mrs. Gatis said. Her son, Gabor, also lives
in Budapest.
<p>
   Budapest's Jewish ghetto was one of the few in Europe to be left
intact after the war. Although it was mined, the Nazis did not have
time to blow it up because the Red Army was advancing. About 50,000
Jews were liberated.
<p>
   An estimated 100,000 Jews live in Hungary, mostly in Budapest,
giving the country the largest Jewish community in eastern Europe.

Navratilova's Career Ends With Loss to Sabatini
Eds: UPDATES with Graf winning, Navratilova, Sabatini quotes
By STEVE WILSTEIN
AP Tennis Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  All the flashes of brilliance that stamped
Martina Navratilova's career for more than two decades  &MD;  the
darting volleys, the leaping overheads, the chip-and-charge
backhands  &MD;  were on display one last time.
<p>
   And in the end they just weren't nearly enough.
<p>
   Navratilova's storied career, 22 years marked by a record 167
singles titles, came to a close with a 6-4, 6-2 loss to Gabriela
Sabatini on Tuesday night in the first round of the Virginia Slims
Championships.
<p>
   Neither the gift of eight double-faults by Sabatini, nor the
nonstop cheers of Navratilova's fans at Madison Square Garden
affected the outcome. Navratilova could muster only moments that
recalled her greatness, and too often she couldn't reach the
perfect lobs and sizzling passes of Sabatini.
<p>
   For the history books, Navratilova's last shot was a backhand
that drifted wide crosscourt.
<p>
   ``I got blown off the court tonight by someone who was playing
in another zone,'' Navratilova said. ``If I have to lose my last
match to anyone, I'd want to lose it to Gabriela Sabatini because
she's a very, very nice human being besides being a hell of a
tennis player.''
<p>
   Navratilova began this most emotional night all smiles and ended
it, predictably, in tears, flowers in one hand, tissues in the
other during the post-match ceremony.
<p>
   ``This is a schizophrenic moment,'' Navratilova said. ``I don't
know whether to cry or laugh. ... I'm ready for my new life.''
<p>
   Navratilova hugged Sabatini at the net when the match ended and
was overwhelmed by a ceremony that included a red banner with a
yellow tennis ball raised in her honor  &MD;  the first such tribute at
the Garden for any woman and appropriate for the most successful
tennis player, man or woman, in history.
<p>
   A videotape of Navratilova's reminded fans that her career was
more than merely victories on court. It was a journey from
Communism in Czechoslovakia to freedom in the United States, where
she gained American citizenship. Her legacy is not only nine
Wimbledon championships, but years of honesty regarding her
politics and lesbian lifestyle.
<p>
   Typically, in her last match, she wore a patch with a red ribbon
on her blouse in support of the fight against AIDS.
<p>
   ``Most athletes don't get controversial because you don't get
endorsements,'' she said. ``It's like taking a cut in pay by being
honest.''
<p>
   She defined her own idea of her legacy to sport as ``being a
consummate professional, giving it everything I had on court and
off court, and striving for excellence.''
<p>
   It wasn't all sadness for Navratilova, though. She jumped up and
down like a kid when she was given a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as
a going-away gift, the song ``Born To Be Wild'' blaring as it was
rolled out. Navratilova quickly hopped aboard, as if ready to ride
off into the sunset.
<p>
   ``It's too early to be relieved,'' Navratilova said moments
later at a news conference. ``I'm too ticked off about losing. I
wanted this week to last. I'm playing good tennis. I could have
played some more, but this is the right time for me. I'm glad to go
out on my own terms. I'm glad my body didn't give out on me. There
were a lot of emotions going on in my head and my heart.''
<p>
   In the end, it was Sabatini's lobs and passes that cost her the
match.
<p>
   ``I was too busy backpedaling to get emotional until it was
match point,'' Navratilova said. ``Then I said, `OK, this is the
last point I'll ever play.'''
<p>
   Asked what she'll miss most, Navratilova said, ``playing against
the best, playing against champions, that's the treat.''
<p>
   Sabatini was one of those champions and she had mixed emotions
about being the player to send Navratilova into retirement.
<p>
   ``On the side I didn't want to be the one to beat her,''
Sabatini said. ``On the other side, I was thinking, well, this is a
great honor for me to play Martina in her last tournament.''
<p>
   When they hugged at the end, Sabatini said, ``I'm sorry I won.''
<p>
   It was a night that belonged to Navratilova, and no one else
seemed to matter to the crowd. Not No. 1 Steffi Graf, who finished
the evening with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Brenda Schultz, nor No. 4
Jana Novotna, who opened the show with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 victory over
17-year-old Iva Majoli.
<p>
   Novotna's match served as a prelude to the pulsating, standing
ovation that greeted Navratilova when she stepped onto the blue
carpeted court to play Sabatini after the singing of the national
anthem by Navratilova's friend, Grammy award winner Melissa
Etheridge.
<p>
   Navratilova, wearing Wimbledon white, tried to peak at Etheridge
from behind a phalanx of security guards. Then when she strode to
midcourt with a smile and a wave to the crowd of 17,131, more than
two dozen photographers leaned over the net to get a shot of
Navratilova as she began pursuit of one more singles crown.
Navratilova responded to the ovation by patting her heart with hand
and looking up at her family and friends in the stands.

Bettman Says Time Running Out to Save NHL Season

<p>
   TORONTO (AP)  &MD;  National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman
says hockey owners likely will cancel the season if they can't
reach a labor agreement in time to salvage a 50-game schedule.
<p>
   Bettman refused Tuesday to set a deadline, saying only,
``Obviously, the time is coming short.''
<p>
   There has been speculation among team officials that
mid-December might be the date.
<p>
   ``We're not there yet,'' Bettman said after induction ceremonies
for the Hockey Hall of Fame. ``But it's coming. We wouldn't like to
have a season with less than 50 games. And we'd like to have one
with more.''
<p>
   Bettman also said the league office has laid off 15 to 20
employees, with everyone else, ``top to bottom,'' taking a 10
percent pay cut. Bettman, who is believed to make dlrs 1 million,
will lose dlrs 100,000.
<p>
   Lionel Conacher, a defenseman in the 1920s and '30s, and Harry
Watson, who played in the '40s and '50s, were inducted into the
Hall of Fame on Tuesday night along with longtime NHL officer Brian
O'Neill. Ted Darling, the broadcaster for the Buffalo Sabres for 22
years, was honored with the Foster Hewitt Award.
<p>
   In his acceptance speech, O'Neill said he was confident the
stewards of the game will find a solution to ``this current
nuisance.''
<p>
   Bettman met with the league's general managers earlier Tuesday
to update them on negotiations to end hockey's longest work
stoppage, which has lasted through 46 days and 253 games.
Officially, the league has cut 14 games from each teams' schedule.
More cuts are expected soon.
<p>
   Union head Bob Goodenow, also at the induction ceremony, said he
expects to meet with Bettman later in the week. He would not say
whether he was expecting a counter-offer to the player proposal
owners quickly rejected last week.
<p>
   ``It only took two seconds to discuss their offer,'' Buffalo
Sabres coach and general manager John Muckler said. He said there
was no movement from ownership during the meeting of general
managers.
<p>
   ``We will do everything possible to work out a settlement,'' he
said. ``The ownership and management is very strong. I guess the
players' association will tell you the same thing.''
<p>
   On that, they can agree.
<p>
   ``They really think we're going to fold our tent,'' said Troy
Loney, the Islanders' player representative. ``It isn't in the
cards at all. Gary has come from a position of power in the NBA,
but I don't think he quite understands the hockey mentality.''
<p>
   Loney said he had hoped the player concessions on rookie
contracts would stimulate discussion.
<p>
   ``At worst, this proposal will get the owners to talk,'' he
said. ``The owners really haven't given us anything'' in the
contract negotiations.
<p>
   The Canadian Press reported that the NHL's counter-proposal will
center on entry-level salaries and salary arbitration, but will not
address the focal issue of a payroll tax. But some league officials
were pessimistic.
<p>
   ``I have not seen any rays of hope,'' Boston Bruins general
manager Harry Sinden said. ``I haven't really. I have not seen
anybody show any optimism about settling this thing.''
<p>
   ``Talking with some of our players,'' Vancouver general manager
Pat Quinn said, ``I can tell we are a long way away from resolving
anything.''

Government Troops Try to Keep Bosnian Serbs Out of Northwest Safe
Zone

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  As Bosnian Serbs and
government troops battled for a strategic plateau overlooking
Bihac, a U.S. official said NATO is studying a possible ban on
heavy weapons around the government-held town.
<p>
   Kenneth Bacon, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman in
Washington, said the alliance is considering establishing a heavy
weapons ``exclusion zone'' around Serb-encircled Bihac, which has
been declared an internationally protected safe zone.
<p>
   ``It's one of a number of suggestions that's come up for how to
deal with the situation there,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``I'd
rather not be more specific about it now. There are a whole series
of options you could think of; an exclusion zone is one.''
<p>
   Fighting also exploded Tuesday in the Majevica hills in
northeastern Bosnia, site of a Serb-held television tower, and near
Mostar on the southwest front.
<p>
   Serbs claimed gains in both regions, but U.N. officials said the
Muslim-led government army appeared to have the upper hand.
<p>
   In the north, Bosnian Serbs shelled Tuzla, another so-called
U.N. ``safe area,'' for a second straight day, killing one resident
and wounding three.
<p>
   NATO was under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac
pocket in the northwest and to U.N. accusations that Serbs in
neighboring Croatia were helping Bosnian Serbs by providing
artillery cover. The Serbs deny it.
<p>
   The mostly-Muslim Bihac pocket is sandwiched between Bosnian
Serb forces to the south and east and Croatian Serb rebels to the
north and west.
<p>
   Croatian government and NATO officials met Tuesday to discuss a
possible air response to Croatian Serb interference in Bosnia's
war. Paul Risley, a senior U.N. spokesman, said NATO should have
``full means'' to keep Croatian Serbs in check.
<p>
   NATO has launched air strikes on Bosnian Serb targets five times
because of violations involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or
attacks on U.N. personnel. The alliance wants to extend its
mandate, currently limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from
Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Risley said NATO and Croatian officials discussed the
``immediate extension of close air support'' to Croatian border
areas held by Serbs. Close air support can include air strikes.
<p>
   ``We would like to see NATO have the ability to respond by full
means to such (cross-border) attacks, should they occur,'' Risley
said in Sarajevo.
<p>
   Bosnian Serb Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, in charge of the Bihac
assault, shrugged off any NATO threat.
<p>
   ``We are ready for a NATO air strike,'' he told the Vecernje
Novosti daily in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. ``We have already prepared a
proper response for everyone, including NATO. ... I personally
think that the safe areas no longer exist.''
<p>
   According to Bosnian radio, 11 people have been killed and 26
wounded in Bosnian government-held territory in Bihac since Monday.
<p>
   Serbs and government troops in the Bihac region were fighting
for control of the Grabez plateau, high ground northeast of Bihac
city.
<p>
   Lt. Col. Tim Spicer, a U.N. spokesman, said close-range fighting
was not spilling off the plateau into government-held territory
that has been declared a safe area by the United Nations.
<p>
   Spicer said there was no indication government forces were
retreating, although previous U.N. reports said Bosnian Serb forces
had regained most of the territory taken by government troops in a
recent offensive.

Two Rebels Killed in Sri Lanka, But Guerrilla's Unilateral
Cease-Fire Holds
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Government troops shot dead two Tamil
rebels in separate confrontations, but the guerrilla's unilateral
cease-fire was holding, Sri Lankan military officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   The rebels were killed during search operations in eastern
Batticaloa district Tuesday. Troops also recovered weapons,
ammunition, explosives and hand grenades.
<p>
   The rebels have not launched any attack since Saturday when
military intelligence intercepted messages that Tiger chief
Velupillai Prabhakaran had ordered his rebels to retaliate only if
attacked.
<p>
   No reason was given for the cease-fire, but Prabhakaran's order
came hours after Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in as president.
Mrs. Kumaratunga polled an overwhelming 62 percent of the vote on a
pledge to end the war.
<p>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga is the first woman to be president in Sri
Lanka. The 11-year-old war has claimed 34,000 lives.
<p>
   Tamils make up about 3 million of the country's 17 million
people and accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination. The
rebels want a separate nation in the north and east.

Surgeon Says Evil Spirits May Have Killed Woman During Exorcism
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HORSHAM, Australia (AP)  &MD;  A prominent surgeon testified
Wednesday he could not rule out the possibility that evil spirits
killed a woman as they were cast out of her during an exorcism.
<p>
   Under cross examination, Dr. John Kennedy said his only
knowledge of exorcism was from the film ``The Exorcist'' and a
television documentary.
<p>
   Kennedy, the director of head and neck surgery at the St.
Vincent's and Austin hospitals in Melbourne, was the first defense
witness called in the trial of four people charged with killing
Joan Leonora Vollmer, 49, during a weeklong exorcism ritual in
January 1993.
<p>
   He told the County Court that medical science had not really
studied the effect of exorcisms.
<p>
   Prosecutor Peter Jones asked him if he was ``seriously
suggesting as a medical scientist'' that one possible cause of Mrs.
Vollmer's death was ``evil spirits coming from within her.''
<p>
   Kennedy replied: ``It may. The medical science of exorcism, the
biochemical bodily functions that occur ... with exorcism have
never been studied.''
<p>
   The surgeon also agreed that injury to a larynx could trigger a
heart attack. Mrs. Vollmer suffered a fractured larynx during the
exorcism.
<p>
   Mrs. Vollmer's husband, Ralph Vollmer, 56, David Andrew
Klingner, 30, and Leanne Merlyn Reichenbach, 32, have all pleaded
innocent to charges of manslaughter as well as to recklessly
causing serious injury and false imprisonment.
<p>
   Kennedy said he believed the four accused were ``extremely
unlucky'' that Mrs. Vollmer died when they clutched the carotid
artery in her neck and triggered the attack.
<p>
   The prosecution alleges the exorcism triggered a fatal heart
attack.
<p>
   The defense claims the prosecution cannot prove beyond a
reasonable doubt how Mrs. Vollmer died or that any of the accused
could have known that their actions could have killed or seriously
injured her.

Dutch National Team Refuses to Play After Disputed Call
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP)  &MD;  Creighton beat the Dutch national team by
forfeit Tuesday night when the Dutch disputed a call in the first
overtime of the exhibition game and refused to play the second
extra period.
<p>
   With Creighton ahead 80-78 in the first overtime, Okke te Velde
of the Netherlands hit a long jump shot with 10 seconds to play.
The Dutch team and coaches argued that Velde's shot was a
3-pointer.
<p>
   Creighton's Marcus Lockett missed a 3-point attempt and the
overtime ended at 80-80. After a 10-minute delay, Creighton was
awarded the victory.
<p>
   ``It was weird,'' said Vince Lodl, Creighton's assistant sports
information director. ``Everyone is kind of shocked by it.''
<p>
   Tas Ackerman scored 19 points and Randall Crutcher added 15
points for the Bluejays. Velde led the Dutch with 25 points.

Communists Take Early Lead in Nepal Polls

<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  Communists took an early lead over the
governing Nepali Congress party as counting began Wednesday in the
country's second parliamentary poll in three years.
<p>
   Krishna Gopal Shresta of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxist-Leninist) won the first seat for his party, defeating his
Congress rival by about 11,000 votes in capital Katmandu.
<p>
   The communists' promise of land reforms and breaking up large
holdings has wide appeal in this poor mountainous country.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was trailing behind his
communist rival by a few hundred votes in the southeastern
constituency of Sunsari. Details of the counting were not
immediately available from Morang, his other constituency.
<p>
   Trends available from 36 of 205 constituencies, showed the
communists leading in 28 places and the Congress in five, said
Election Commission spokesman Tek Bahadur Thapa. Small political
groups are leading in the other places.
<p>
   Thapa said 58 percent of 12 million voters took part in
Tuesday's balloting, held 18 months ahead of schedule.
<p>
   The election commission has ordered re-poll in 64 polling
stations in 33 constituencies for electoral malpractice.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
to become the figurehead in Nepal's new democracy.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's government and forced early
elections. His government was discredited because of the lack
performance in the economic field and intra-party dissension.
<p>
   Sandwiched between the world's two most populous countries,
India and china, Nepal's 20 million people survive on agriculture.

Powerful Conservative Pushes Clinton To Delay GATT Vote
By DAVE SKIDMORE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Sen. Jesse Helms, incoming chairman of the
U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, is hinting he will
hinder the administration's foreign policy initiatives unless
President Clinton agrees to postpone a vote on a world trade
agreement until early next year.
<p>
   In a letter to the president released Tuesday, Helms asked
Clinton to delay the vote so the accord, negotiated under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, does not have to be ``raced
through a lame-duck session of the U.S. Senate on a very unwise
`fast-track schedule.'''
<p>
   ``If you agree, Mr. President, I can assure that it will have an
exceedingly positive effect on my making certain that the
administration positions on all foreign policy matters during the
104th Congress will be considered fully and fairly,'' wrote Helms,
a conservative Republican who often raises questions about U.S.
international involvements.
<p>
   Republicans swept to majorities in both the Senate and the House
of Representatives in U.S. midterm elections last week. The new
Congress convenes Jan. 1, leaving sessions until then in ``lame
duck'' limbo.
<p>
   Votes on GATT are scheduled Nov. 29 in the House and Dec. 1 in
the Senate. Clinton has called on Republicans to support the pact,
for which negotiations started during the Reagan presidency, as
evidence of their willingness to cooperate with his administration.
<p>
   Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will. Sen. Bob
Dole, the soon-to-be majority leader of the Senate, has said he is
predisposed to support the accord but wants Clinton to endorse
separate legislation early next year that will strengthen the U.S.
ability to withdraw from it.
<p>
   GATT supporters fear postponement would doom the accord because
special ``fast track'' rules for quick passage that protect it from
being amended by Congress expire at the end of this year.
<p>
   A prominent investment banker cautioned Congress that rejection
of GATT  &MD;  or even postponement of congressional votes  &MD;  would shake
world financial markets and send interest rates higher.
<p>
   ``Financial markets are now totally committed to open trade and
investment. Any signal that carries with it a threat to
international cooperation is bound to have serious consequences,''
Felix G. Rohatyn told the Senate Commerce Committee.
<p>
   Rohatyn, a senior partner with Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. and an early
supporter of Clinton, said rejection of GATT would further pressure
a dollar already trading near record lows against the Japanese yen
and German mark.
<p>
   ``This not only could mean a lower dollar and a lower stock
market, but higher mortgage rates, higher auto loan rates and lower
home equity values,'' he said. ``This is not a risk I would care to
run.''
<p>
   Rohatyn's testimony came Tuesday during the eighth and last
hearing on GATT conducted by an ardent Democratic Party opponent of
the pact, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings.
<p>
   Hollings, who in early October used his chairmanship of the
Commerce Committee to delay the Senate vote on GATT, charged
predictions about the consequences of rejecting the pact were
alarmist.

Autopsy Says Drowning of Tito Jackson's Ex-Wife Was Suspicious
Eds: Updates with coronor's briefing, family no comment
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  The death of Michael Jackson's former
sister-in-law was suspicious and another person may have been
involved in her drowning, the coroner's office said Tuesday.
<p>
   Delores Jackson, 39, died Aug. 27 of ``asphyxia due to drowning,
alcohol intake and blunt force traumatic injuries,'' said Scott
Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office.
<p>
   The report did not determine how Ms. Jackson, former wife of
Jackson's older brother Tito, drowned or was injured, Carrier said.
<p>
   Ms. Jackson's body was pulled from a pool by boyfriend Donald
Bohana. Bohana said he was swimming with Ms. Jackson in the wee
hours when he got out of the water and left briefly, investigators
said. When he returned, she was at the bottom of the pool, he said.
<p>
   The autopsy report noted lip, tongue and ear cuts as well as
hemorrhaging in the neck. There was also a notation that the
injuries ``favor a non-accidental origin'' and support the
possibility of ``assisted drowning.''
<p>
   Some of Ms. Jackson's cuts and bruises were not consistent with
drowning, and investigators do not rule out she was beaten, Carrier
said.
<p>
   ``This lady had a torn earlobe; an earring had come loose in her
ear,'' Carrier said.
<p>
   ``The mode of death is undetermined,'' he added.
<p>
   Ms. Jackson's blood alcohol content was almost 2 1/2 times the
legal limit of 0.08 percent, Carrier said.
<p>
   No arrests have been made. Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the
district attorney's office, would not say whether the case was
being handled as a murder.
<p>
   Ms. Jackson divorced Toriano ``Tito'' Jackson in 1988 after 16
years of marriage. The couple had two children.
<p>
   Jackson family spokesman John McLaughlin said he had not been in
touch with the family concerning the coroner's report and could not
comment.

Patrick Dean, Britain's US Ambassador During Vietnam War, Is Dead
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Sir Patrick Dean, Britain's U.S. Ambassador from
1965-1969 when relations between Lyndon Johnson and prime minister
Harold Wilson were strained over the Vietnam War, has died aged 85.
<p>
   Dean's family said he died at Kingston 10 miles (16 km)
southwest of central London on Nov. 5. No cause of death was
stated. His body was cremated at a private family service.
<p>
   Dean, a career diplomat, was Britain's representative at the
United Nations from 1960 to 1964.
<p>
   The following year, he was appointed his country's ambassador to
Washington by Wilson's government at a sometimes difficult period
in relations between the two countries.
<p>
   Wilson offered the United States moral support in its conduct of
the Vietnam War. But the socialist prime minister's occasional
reservations about U.S. bombing, his determination not to commit
British troops to the war and his attempt at one stage to broker a
peace settlement left President Johnson far from satisfied.
<p>
   The result was a testing four years for the British Ambassador.
<p>
   On the positive side, Dean proved a tireless advocate on behalf
of his country's economic interests, traveling extensively in the
United States to promote British imports.
<p>
   Dean retired from the diplomatic service in 1969 and took up a
series of business consultancies and company directorships. He was
chairman of the English-Speaking Union which promotes British-U.S.
ties from 1973 to 1983.
<p>
   He is survived by his wife Patricia and their two sons.

Radical Group Urges Muslims to Punish Taslima Nasrin
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)  &MD;  A radical Islamic group Wednesday
repeated its death threat to exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima
Nasrin for calling the Koran a mere historical book.
<p>
   Nasrin's latest criticism of the Islamic holy book came in a
television interview broadcast last weekend on an Australian
network.
<p>
   ``The infidel writer has once again insulted the Koran and hurt
the sentiments of Muslims. We shall not let her go unpunished,''
said Fazlul Huq Amini, a spokesman for the Combined Action
Committee, a coalition of 13 radical groups.
<p>
   Amini called on the Muslims in Sweden to rise against the
32-year-old writer and punish her. Ms. Nasrin left Bangladesh after
a court granted her bail and she now lives in Sweden.
<p>
   The coalition has planned mass demonstrations in Dhaka next
month to bring the author back home.
<p>
   In the television interview, Ms. Nasrin said the Koran is out of
place today and should be kept as a historical book.

Prime Minister: Japan Should Play Organizing Role at Next APEC
Meet
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said Wednesday
that Japan will strive to play an organizing role among nations of
the Asia-Pacific region as they try to cooperate on controversial
on trade liberalization plans.
<p>
   Murayama, who returned home earlier in the day from Jakarta,
Indonesia, where leaders of the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group met, made his remarks during an upper house
committee session of Japanese Parliament.
<p>
   ``Japan's role will be how to create conditions for member
nations to cooperate among themselves (at next year's APEC meeting
in Osaka),'' Murayama said.
<p>
   He added that in the Osaka meeting, ministers from the 18 APEC
nations will ``map out a blueprint on concrete issues'' raised by
the implementation of a free trade agreement.
<p>
   APEC leaders pledged Tuesday to achieve ``free and fair trade
and investment'' throughout the region within 25 years. The
Asia-Pacific is a dynamic economic region, but many of its nations
maintain heavy trade barriers.
<p>
   He pointed out that Japan's heavily protected agricultural
markets are among the problems that will need to be resolved before
the free trade deadline.

<p>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A drenching Tropical Storm Gordon
swept the southern tip of Florida on Tuesday, spawning at least one
tornado and grounding a 506-foot (152-meter) freighter just off the
beach. At least two people were killed.
<p>
   The tornado touched down in Barefoot Bay, a retirement community
of about 7,000 people, killing one person and damaging or
destroying at least 500 mobile homes, officials said.
<p>
   Rescuers said six people were taken to hospitals and at least 29
others were treated at the scene. Two people were in critical
condition.
<p>
   Mangled metal hung from trees like huge strips of tinsel and
debris was strewn everywhere.
<p>
   ``Frames of houses, siding, sheds, washers, dryers, a boat
overturned, fiberglass insulation, anything that's in a house was
all over the lawns and the streets,'' freelance photographer Jeff
Cross said.
<p>
   It wasn't clear how many people were left homeless.
<p>
   Elswhere in Florida, Elena Quicano, 36, was killed Monday when
she was thrown from her vehicle in a three-car collision and run
over by a pickup at a traffic light broken by the storm, police
said. She was seven months pregnant.
<p>
   Gordon moved into the Gulf of Mexico off Key West with 50 mph
(80 kmph) -winds and was expected to slow down for a day or so
after dumping up to 8 1/2 inches (22 cms) of rain on South Florida.
<p>
   The storm knocked out power to 397,000 homes and businesses, and
about 26,000 customers remained without power by late afternoon,
Florida Power and Light said.
<p>
   At 7 p.m. (2400 GMT) Tuesday, Gordon was about 100 miles (160
kilometers) northwest of Key West and 120 miles (192 kilometers)
south of Sarasota. It was creeping northwest at 8 mph (13 kmph) in
the Gulf of Mexico.
<p>
   At least 100 people were confirmed killed in Haiti, and the
independent Radio Signal FM on Tuesday reported the death toll was
at least 400.
<p>
   Two each died in Jamaica and Cuba as the deadliest tropical
storm of the season spun through the Caribbean.
<p>
   Between thundershowers Tuesday, the sight of the grounded
Turkish freighter Firat just yards from shore in Fort Lauderdale
awed tourists and beachgoers.
<p>
   The ship, carrying 2,640 tons of steel, was anchored a mile from
the beach, just off the entrance to Port Everglades with a crew of
29 aboard when high winds shoved it beachward before dawn, Coast
Guard spokeswoman Lori Rheaume said.
<p>
   Broward County employee Stephen Higgins said the three-day storm
had caused worse beach erosion than the fast-moving Hurricane
Andrew two years ago.
<p>
   The oceanfront Highway A1A near the grounded ship was lined with
sand drifts.
<p>
   Among the flotsam thrown up on Florida's beaches were five
packages of cocaine. Bricks of about two pounds (0.9 kilograms)
each were found in the St. Augustine area in North Florida.

Seiko Epson Develops Software Bridge Between NEC, IBM Computers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  A Japanese computer maker said Wednesday it has
developed a product that will allow the same software to run on
computers made by Japanese market leader NEC Corp. and
IBM-compatible machines.
<p>
   Katsuyuki Kanuma, spokesman for Seiko Epson Corp., said the new
``98/V'' software program enables application software designed for
NEC's popular ``98 series'' models to run on IBM compatibles.
<p>
   About half the personal computers sold in Japan use a
proprietary design developed by NEC and are not directly compatible
with the IBM standard adopted in most countries.
<p>
   Although long-dominated by the NEC design, Japan's PC market has
begun shifting away from it, with IBM compatibles and Apple
Computer's Macintosh gaining in popularity.
<p>
   In August, NEC said it would introduce some IBM-compatible
computers in Japan in a reversal of its own previous policy.
<p>
   Others also have been shifting toward the IBM standard because
of its worldwide acceptance.
<p>
   Last week, Seiko Epson said it will begin selling IBM
compatibles, ending its past NEC-only strategy.
<p>
   In trials of 150 software programs designed for NEC models, 80
percent ran normally on IBM-compatible models with the help of the
new product, Kanuma said.
<p>
   He would not disclose other details, but the major nationwide
Asahi newspaper said Epson plans to sell the new software bridge at
about 15,000 yen (dlrs 153) starting in January.
<p>
   The economic daily Nihon Keizai reported that IBM plans to
market the new software, but an official at IBM Japan Ltd. said
that hasn't been decided.
<p>
   Seiko Epson sold 200,000 personal computers, all NEC
compatibles, in fiscal 1993, taking a 7 percent share of Japan's PC
market. Kanuma said the company expects to sell 280,000 personal
computers this year.

University in East Timor Closed To Quell Unrest
Eds: One name only for Suharto.
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DILI, East Timor (AP)  &MD;  East Timor University has been closed
until next week in a bid to quell anti-Indonesian protests by
students, professors said Wednesday.
<p>
   Classes at the 2,100-student campus were suspended because a
peaceful student demonstration Sunday was followed by violent
clashes between riot police and a mob of indigenous East Timorese.
<p>
   They were reportedly angered by long-running ethnic tensions
with newcomers from other parts of Indonesia.
<p>
   The closure was extended after students staged more protests
Monday and Tuesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, another 29 East Timorese students continued a sit-in
in the parking lot of the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Jakarta,
1,500 miles (2,500 kilometers) to the west.
<p>
   They scrambled over a fence into the embassy grounds Saturday to
seek U.S. support for self-determination for East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the
following year as its 27th province.
<p>
   The incidents in both cities coincided with bilateral talks
Wednesday between President Bill Clinton and Indonesia's President
Suharto.
<p>
   Clinton, who attended the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit on Tuesday, was expected to raise U.S. concerns
about human rights in Indonesia.
<p>
   ``We decided it was best to call off all studies at the
university until after Sunday,'' said Armindo Maia, vice rector of
the university, which was established by the Indonesian government
after the invasion. Maia said the decision was made in consultation
with the police and the military, which in the past have cracked
down hard on dissent.
<p>
   Uniformed members of the university's own student regiment, an
unarmed cadet corps, were patrolling the perimeter of the campus
and warning students to keep away.
<p>
   ``As a university we believe in free expression but on the other
hand we have to abide by the law,'' Maia said.
<p>
   About 100 people are known to have been arrested since Sunday,
and police say most were released after questioning.
<p>
   Unconfirmed claims by residents of Dili said many more have been
rounded up and that police have been searching door-to-door for
alleged troublemakers.
<p>
   Many stores and offices in the center of Dili, where Sunday's
riot took place, remained shut Wednesday.
<p>
   Few police were seen on the streets and the general mood
appeared calm.
<p>
   Police said the melee was triggered by the alleged murder of an
East Timorese man by another from the province of Suluwesi on
Saturday night.

Radical Group Urges Muslims to Punish Bangladeshi Author
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)  &MD;  A radical Islamic group Wednesday
repeated its threat to kill exiled Bangladeshi writer Taslima
Nasrin for calling the Koran merely a historical book.
<p>
   Nasrin's latest criticism of the Islamic holy book came in a
television interview broadcast last weekend on an Australian
network.
<p>
   In the television interview, Ms. Nasrin said the Koran is out of
place today and should be regarded as a historical book.
<p>
   ``The infidel writer has once again insulted the Koran and hurt
the sentiments of Muslims. We shall not let her go unpunished,''
said Fazlul Huq Amini, a spokesman for the Combined Action
Committee, a coalition of 13 radical groups.
<p>
   Ms. Nasrin left Bangladesh after a court granted her bail, and
she now lives in Sweden. Amini called on Muslims in Sweden to rise
against the 32-year-old writer and punish her.
<p>
   The coalition has planned mass demonstrations in Dhaka next
month to call for her return to Bangladesh.

Shootings Target City, Corporate Officials' Homes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  In the latest outburst of gun violence in Japan, an
unknown attacker shot at the home of a mayor early Wednesday,
police said. No injuries were reported.
<p>
   The incident in the town of Shingu, about 1,000 kilometers (625
miles) southwest of Tokyo, was the latest in a series of shootings
in Japan, where crimes involving firearms were rare until several
years ago.
<p>
   Police later found bullets or bullet holes at the residences of
Mayor Teruhiko Iura, 70, Deputy Mayor Hitoshi Tominaga, 63, and
Hideo Fujita, 47, president of Fujita-gumi Construction Co., who
were also apparently targeted during the predawn hours.
<p>
   Police said it was not known immediately if the incident had any
connection with public works projects in the town of 14,000 on the
southernmost main island of Kyushu.
<p>
   Since Sept. 1, 18 other shooting incidents have been reported in
northern Kyushu. Police officials said they believe organized crime
groups are responsible for most of the cases.
<p>
   In a recent spate of other shootings, a 36-year-old man shot his
doctor in Tokyo on Oct. 25 following a dispute over his hernia
operation. Police arrested him three days later.
<p>
   Shootings related to turf wars among Japan's organized crime
syndicates have increased in recent years in part because of
anti-gang legislation of 1992 that has forced gangs to seek new
sources of income.
<p>
   Twenty of the shootings in the last two years have targeted
executives and small businesses who never had any explicit
involvement with gangs.

Dollar Firms, Stocks Fall
Eds: UPDATES with closing dollar, stock indexes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen
Wednesday despite profit-taking following a U.S. interest rate
increase. Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell amid a lack of
incentives.
<p>
   The dollar finished at 98.62 yen, up 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
Tokyo close but below its overnight New York finish of 98.76 yen.
<p>
   After opening at 98.61 yen, the dollar ranged between 98.55 yen
and 98.73 yen.
<p>
   The U.S. currency strengthened overnight in New York after the
Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates by 0.75
percentage point.
<p>
   A higher U.S. interest rate supports the dollar by making
dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors.
<p>
   ``The dollar remained weaker than its overnight levels in New
York due to selling pressure from (Japanese) exporters at around
98.70 yen,'' said Satoshi Soda, a foreign exchange specialist with
Sakura Bank.
<p>
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
85.02 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 19,306.66. On Tuesday,
the benchmark index had gained 130.23 points, or 0.68 percent, to
19,391.68.
<p>
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 3.14 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,525.50. It had
risen 10.82 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,528.64 on Tuesday.
<p>
   Amid a lack of market-affecting news, profit-taking and
arbitrage-linked selling pushed down prices, traders said.
<p>
   The price of the benchmark No. 164 10-year Japanese government
bonds stood at 95.94 yen as of 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 0.15 yen
from Tuesday's close. Their yield rose to 4.740 percent from 4.715
percent.

Micronesian Senator Accuses Asians of Bribing Fishery Officials
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   POHNPEI, Federated States of Micronesia (AP)  &MD;  Amid complaints
of unfair competition from Asian fishermen, a state lawmaker has
accused Micronesia's fishing officials of accepting gifts from
foreign companies seeking fishing permits.
<p>
   Pohnpei State Sen. Wagner Lawrence said the officials accepted
foreign trips from Asian companies seeking to exploit the country's
vast ocean resources.
<p>
   Fishing and fishing licence fees are one of the main sources of
revenue for Micronesia, which comprises hundreds of islands divided
into four states.
<p>
   The allegations follow growing hostility in Micronesia toward
Taiwanese and Chinese fishing companies operating in the Pacific
nation's waters.
<p>
   Chinese fishermen have been assaulted by Micronesians who
believe foreign boats are guilty of overfishing and wasting
unwanted fish that could be supplied to locals.
<p>
   Lawrence, in a speech this week to the National Congress, called
for the resignation of the board of the Micronesian Maritime
Authority for allegedly accepting gifts, which he said violated the
law.
<p>
   He also accused the Authority's board members of acting as a
lobby ``on behalf of foreign boat companies'' rather than trying to
help Micronesia get the best deal from its fishing resources.
<p>
   Lawrence said the Authority had once negotiated fishing deals in
Micronesia's favor, but that a ``clear change of attitude'' on the
part of the board had coincided with offers of foreign trips.
<p>
   His attack followed congressional approval of a new deal with
the Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Boat Owners and Exporters Association.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Lawrence called for an investigation of
Taiwanese company Ting Hong Oceanic Enterprises, which he accused
of bribing government officials. Ting Hong denied any wrongdoing.
<p>
   Concern is growing among Pacific nations that they are not
earning a fair return from fishing agreements with foreign
companies.
<p>
   Prime Minister Paul Keating, speaking at this year's South
Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane, accused Asian fishing and
logging companies of environmental piracy in the region.
<p>
   Local fishermen in Micronesia's neighbour, the Marshall Islands,
complained early this year their catches had dropped 50 percent
because they could not compete with Chinese long-line tuna boats.

Stock Investors, Film Stars Among Richest Chinese
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Senior leader Deng Xiaoping has declared that
``to get rich is glorious,'' and growing numbers of Chinese
apparently are taking those words to heart after decades of
Communist-decreed egalitarianism.
<p>
   Stock investors, private entrepreneurs and film stars head the
list of China's most well-to-do, according to an official report
from the State Statistical Bureau published Wednesday.
<p>
   Some investors savvy, or lucky, enough to be making money out of
China's volatile stock markets have incomes of more than 1 million
yuan (dlrs 120,000) a year, the newspaper China Business Times
reported.
<p>
   It said the richest private entrepreneurs generally were making
more than 100,000 yuan (dlrs 11,746) a year, as were top-class
chefs.
<p>
   Film stars took in only about 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,176), although
some earned much more.
<p>
   Managers of foreign-funded companies make 12,000-40,000 yuan
(dlrs 1,412-4,700), but taxi drivers do even better on average  &MD; 
taking home 25,000-40,000 yuan (dlrs 2,940-4,700), the report said.
<p>
   The report did not provide details about its survey, or names of
wealthy individual Chinese, a handful of whom have become
multimillionaires under their nation's policy of market-oriented
reforms.
<p>
   Until the 1980s, Chinese peasants shared their communes' incomes
and urban workers were almost all employed by the government or
state-owned enterprises, which paid similar salaries to all.
<p>
   The average annual income in China now is about dlrs 265.

Navratilova's Career Ends With Loss to Sabatini
Eds: UPDATES with Navratilova's age in 4th graf.
By STEVE WILSTEIN
AP Tennis Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  All the flashes of brilliance that stamped
Martina Navratilova's career for more than two decades  &MD;  the
darting volleys, the leaping overheads, the chip-and-charge
backhands  &MD;  were on display one last time.
<p>
   And in the end they just weren't nearly enough.
<p>
   Navratilova's storied career, 22 years marked by a record 167
singles titles, came to a close with a 6-4, 6-2 loss to Gabriela
Sabatini on Tuesday night in the first round of the Virginia Slims
Championships.
<p>
   Neither the gift of eight double-faults by Sabatini, nor the
nonstop cheers of Navratilova's fans at Madison Square Garden
affected the outcome. At 38, she could muster only moments that
recalled her greatness, and too often she couldn't reach the
perfect lobs and sizzling passes of Sabatini.
<p>
   For the history books, Navratilova's last shot was a backhand
that drifted wide crosscourt.
<p>
   ``I got blown off the court tonight by someone who was playing
in another zone,'' Navratilova said. ``If I have to lose my last
match to anyone, I'd want to lose it to Gabriela Sabatini because
she's a very, very nice human being besides being a hell of a
tennis player.''
<p>
   Navratilova began this most emotional night all smiles and ended
it, predictably, in tears, flowers in one hand, tissues in the
other during the post-match ceremony.
<p>
   ``This is a schizophrenic moment,'' Navratilova said. ``I don't
know whether to cry or laugh. ... I'm ready for my new life.''
<p>
   Navratilova hugged Sabatini at the net when the match ended and
was overwhelmed by a ceremony that included a red banner with a
yellow tennis ball raised in her honor  &MD;  the first such tribute at
the Garden for any woman and appropriate for the most successful
tennis player, man or woman, in history.
<p>
   A videotape of Navratilova's reminded fans that her career was
more than merely victories on court. It was a journey from
Communism in Czechoslovakia to freedom in the United States, where
she gained American citizenship. Her legacy is not only nine
Wimbledon championships, but years of honesty regarding her
politics and lesbian lifestyle.
<p>
   Typically, in her last match, she wore a patch with a red ribbon
on her blouse in support of the fight against AIDS.
<p>
   ``Most athletes don't get controversial because you don't get
endorsements,'' she said. ``It's like taking a cut in pay by being
honest.''
<p>
   She defined her own idea of her legacy to sport as ``being a
consummate professional, giving it everything I had on court and
off court, and striving for excellence.''
<p>
   It wasn't all sadness for Navratilova, though. She jumped up and
down like a kid when she was given a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as
a going-away gift, the song ``Born To Be Wild'' blaring as it was
rolled out. Navratilova quickly hopped aboard, as if ready to ride
off into the sunset.
<p>
   ``It's too early to be relieved,'' Navratilova said moments
later at a news conference. ``I'm too ticked off about losing. I
wanted this week to last. I'm playing good tennis. I could have
played some more, but this is the right time for me. I'm glad to go
out on my own terms. I'm glad my body didn't give out on me. There
were a lot of emotions going on in my head and my heart.''
<p>
   In the end, it was Sabatini's lobs and passes that cost her the
match.
<p>
   ``I was too busy backpedaling to get emotional until it was
match point,'' Navratilova said. ``Then I said, `OK, this is the
last point I'll ever play.'''
<p>
   Asked what she'll miss most, Navratilova said, ``playing against
the best, playing against champions, that's the treat.''
<p>
   Sabatini was one of those champions and she had mixed emotions
about being the player to send Navratilova into retirement.
<p>
   ``On the side I didn't want to be the one to beat her,''
Sabatini said. ``On the other side, I was thinking, well, this is a
great honor for me to play Martina in her last tournament.''
<p>
   When they hugged at the end, Sabatini said, ``I'm sorry I won.''
<p>
   It was a night that belonged to Navratilova, and no one else
seemed to matter to the crowd. Not No. 1 Steffi Graf, who finished
the evening with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Brenda Schultz, nor No. 4
Jana Novotna, who opened the show with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 victory over
17-year-old Iva Majoli.
<p>
   Novotna's match served as a prelude to the pulsating, standing
ovation that greeted Navratilova when she stepped onto the blue
carpeted court to play Sabatini after the singing of the national
anthem by Navratilova's friend, Grammy award winner Melissa
Etheridge.
<p>
   Navratilova, wearing Wimbledon white, tried to peak at Etheridge
from behind a phalanx of security guards. Then when she strode to
midcourt with a smile and a wave to the crowd of 17,131, more than
two dozen photographers leaned over the net to get a shot of
Navratilova as she began pursuit of one more singles crown.
Navratilova responded to the ovation by patting her heart with hand
and looking up at her family and friends in the stands.

   Shaquille O'Neal dominated at both ends of the court, getting 29
points and 13 rebounds as the Orlando Magic beat the Washington
Bullets 122-102 on Tuesday night in Orlando, Florida.
<p>
   O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer, also blocked five shots and
had six assists. Horace Grant added 21 points and 13 rebounds to
help the Magic avenge a season-opening loss to the Bullets.
<p>
   Rex Chapman, who beat the Magic with a shot at the buzzer in the
opener, led Washington with 17 points.
<p>
   Nick Anderson and Donald Royal had 18 points apiece and Anfernee
Hardaway 16 for Orlando. Scott Skiles, who had 11 assists, and
Kevin Duckworth scored 16 points each for the Bullets, who at 4-2
are off to their best start in five years. &QL; 
<p>
   In Atlanta, Stacey Augmon scored 27 points and Ken Norman added
19 points as the Atlanta Hawks routed the Boston Celtics and former
teammate Dominique Wilkins.
<p>
   Wilkins, the former Hawk now wearing Celtics green, managed only
16 points on 8-of-20 shooting as Atlanta, with five players in
double figures, never trailed after a 14-0 run gave the Hawks a
24-11 lead 7:36 into the game.
<p>
   Atlanta's biggest lead  &MD;  24 points  &MD;  was 78-54 when Jon Koncak
hit a three-point basket with 3:20 left in the third period. &QL; 
<p>
   In Miami, the Miami Heat, behind Harold Miner's 23 points,
earned their first victory of the season by beating Dallas.
<p>
   The win came after an 0-4 start, Miami's worst since its
inaugural season in 1988.
<p>
   Kevin Willis matched his season high with 24 points for Miami.
Glen Rice added 16.
<p>
   Jamal Mashburn, who scored 50 points Saturday against the
Chicago Bulls, had to settle for 24 against Miami. Jim Jackson had
25 for the Mavericks. &QL; 
<p>
   In Auburn Hills, Michigan, Joe Dumars scored seven of his 20
points in the final five minutes, and the Detroit Pistons hung on
to beat the Philadelphia 76ers.
<p>
   Detroit won despite missing three of eight free throws in the
final three minutes.
<p>
   Grant Hill led the Pistons with 22 points, and was followed by
Dumars. Willie Burton, who had six 3-pointers, came off the bench
to score 27, one short of his career high, and Clarence
Weatherspoon added 25. &QL; 
<p>
   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Derrick Coleman broke out of a
slump by hitting seven of his first eight shots and scoring 16 of
his 25 points in the first quarter to lead the New Jersey Nets past
the Seattle SuperSonics.
<p>
   Armon Gilliam added 19 points and Kevin Edwards 18 as New Jersey
opened a 20-point halftime lead in winning for only the second time
in seven games under new coach Butch Beard.
<p>
   The Sonics were hurt by 16 Nets' blocks, an NBA season-high.
Shawn Kemp led Seattle with 26 points and 13 rebounds. &QL; 
<p>
   In Cleveland, Chris Mills hit a desperate 3-pointer at the
buzzer in regulation and Tyrone Hill sank the go-ahead jumper in
overtime as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Charlotte Hornets
89-86 Tuesday night.
<p>
   Cleveland trailed by eight with three minutes left in regulation
and appeared all but out of it after Muggsy Bogues sank two foul
shots that put Charlotte ahead 78-75 with three seconds to go.
<p>
   After Mills sent the game into overtime, Hill's jumper with 37
seconds left gave Cleveland an 87-86 lead it never relinquished.
Hill led Cleveland with 22 points and his second consecutive
16-rebound game. Mills had 19 points and Mark Price scored 15.
<p>
   Alonzo Mourning scored 23 and Kenny Gattison 16 for the
Hornets. &QL; 
<p>
   In Denver, Robert Pack scored a career-high 30 points and the
Denver Nuggets held off a rally by the San Antonio Spurs to win
their fourth straight.
<p>
   Reserve forward Tom Hammonds scored 22 points, including 12 in
the fourth quarter. He hit his first six shots in the final period
after the Spurs had drawn within two points, 81-79, on Terry
Cummings' 16-footer barely a minute into the quarter.
<p>
   The Spurs, who saw their three-game winning streak end in their
first road game of the season, lost despite getting 33 points and
20 rebounds from David Robinson. &QL; 
<p>
   In Milwaukee, Glenn Robinson had his best night as a pro,
scoring 18 points as Milwaukee survived a second-half collapse to
edge Indiana.
<p>
   Todd Day blocked Byron Scott's desperation shot at the buzzer
after the Bucks turned the ball over with less than a second
remaining when Marty Conlon fumbled away an inbounds pass.
<p>
   Vin Baker and Day added 15 points each for the Bucks, who led by
as many as 26 points in the first half.
<p>
   Reggie Miller led Indiana with 17 points, but he missed a layup
with 30 seconds left that would have given the Pacers their first
lead of the game. &QL; 
<p>
   In Houston, Hakeem Olajuwon scored 28 points, helping the
Houston Rockets hold off Sacramento and extending their
season-opening winning streak to seven games.
<p>
   The Kings recovered from a slow start to take a 23-22 lead at
the end of the first quarter. Sacramento also led 47-45 at the half
and 76-75 going into the final quarter.
<p>
   Mitch Richmond, who averaged 24 points against the Rockets last
season, scored 31 points for the Kings, including 14 in the third
quarter. &QL; 
<p>
   In Portland, Oregon, Danny Manning scored 10 points in the
fourth quarter and Elliott Perry four in the final 44 seconds as
the injury-depleted Phoenix Suns came from 15 points down in the
second half to spoil the Portland Trail Blazers' home opener.
<p>
   Manning scored eight during a 17-3 run that put Phoenix ahead
90-85 with 3:44 to play. Dan Majerle, who led the Suns with 21
points, had consecutive 3-pointers during the surge.
<p>
   Clyde Drexler had 26 points, Clifford Robinson 22 and Rod
Strickland 19 for the Blazers. &QL; 
<p>
   In Los Angeles, Vlade Divac and Cedric Ceballos each scored 24
points as the Lakers staged a fourth-quarter comeback, keeping the
Los Angeles Clippers winless.
<p>
   The Clippers lost their sixth straight and are within one game
of equaling their worst start since an 0-7 beginning to the 1982-83
season in San Diego.
<p>
   The Lakers began the final quarter trailing 80-71 before
outscoring the Clippers 31-12 in the period.
<p>
   Terry Dehere led the Clippers with 15 points. Loy Vaught added
14 and Tony Massenburg and Harold Ellis had 13 each. &QL; 
<p>
   In Oakland, California, Isaiah Rider had a career-high 35 points
as the Minnesota Timberwolves broke a 16-game losing streak by
beating the previously undefeated Golden State Warriors.
<p>
   Spurred by three straight 3-pointers from 7-foot-7 Manute Bol,
the Warriors cut a 17-point deficit to one point with 19 seconds
left. But Rider hit a free throw with seven seconds left, and Chris
Gatling missed two potentially tying free throws for the Warriors
with less than a second left.
<p>
   Latrell Sprewell had 24 points for Golden State.

BC-Singapore-Valentine's Day
Romantic Couples Rush to Tie the Knot on Lovers' Day
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  Hundreds of couples camped outside a government
office, playing cards, munching biscuits and swatting mosquitos.
Some snoozed on straw mats.
<p>
   All this to get married on Valentine's Day.
<p>
   A record 306 couples queued up Tuesday at the Registry of
Marriages to give the mandatory three-month notice so that they
could tie the knot on Feb. 14, 1995, news reports said Wednesday.
<p>
   Although Valentine's Day always is popular for weddings, the
rush was greater this year because it will coincide with an
auspicious day in the Chinese calendar  &MD;  the 15th day of the Lunar
New Year.
<p>
   Chinese believe this full-moon day belongs to lovers and
signifies completeness. A majority of Singapore's 3 million people
are ethnic Chinese, who are Buddhists as well as Christians.
<p>
   To meet the greater demand, the registrar will solemnize 130
weddings on Feb. 14 compared with the 100 on usual Valentine's
Days. The remaining 176 couples are expected to be wedded by
justices of the peace or in churches or to pick another date.
<p>
   Normally, about 66 weddings are performed each weekday and 72 on
Saturdays, a registry spokesman said.
<p>
   Xie Wenxian and his fiancee, Cai Xiaohui, waited overnight for
12 hours to be the first to register when the office opened at 8
a.m.
<p>
   When Wu Laitian and Huang Aiming reached the gates at 3:15 a.m.,
they found a queue already in place. So the couple passed around a
set of poker cards and spent the night chatting and slapping away
mosquitos, the newspaper Straits Times reported.
<p>
   ``When we needed to relieve ourselves, some used the toilets at
the Hotel Excelsior, while other guys .. well you know, found
alternative means,'' said Raymond Tan.
<p>
   On Feb. 14, the Registry of Marriages will use two rooms to
perform marriages without a break, even for lunch, ``until the
130th couple has tied the knot,'' said the registry spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   ``We will have to discourage staff from taking leave on
Valentine's Day,'' he said.

Communists Take Early Lead in Nepal Polls
By BINAYA GURUACHARYA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  Communists took an early lead over the
governing Nepali Congress party as counting began Wednesday in the
country's second parliamentary poll in three years.
<p>
   Krishna Gopal Shresta of the Communist Party of Nepal won the
first seat for his party, defeating his Congress rival by about
11,000 votes in the capital, Katmandu.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
to become the figurehead in Nepal's new democracy.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's government and forced early
elections. His government was discredited because of the lack of
economic progress and intra-party disputes.
<p>
   Sandwiched between the world's two most populous countries,
India and China, Nepal's 20 million people survive on agriculture.
The communists' promise of land reforms and breaking up large
holdings has wide appeal in this poor mountainous country.
<p>
   The prime minister was trailing behind his communist rival by a
few hundred votes in the southeastern constituency of Sunsari.
Details of the counting were not immediately available from Morang,
his other constituency.
<p>
   Trends available from 36 of 205 constituencies, showed the
communists leading in 28 places and the Congress in five, said
Election Commission spokesman Tek Bahadur Thapa. Small political
groups are leading in the other places.
<p>
   Thapa said 58 percent of 12 million voters took part in
Tuesday's balloting, held 18 months ahead of schedule.
<p>
   The election commission has ordered voting to be held again at
64 polling stations in 33 constituencies because of electoral
irregularities.

Stranded Japanese Scientist, Three Filipinos Rescued

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CALAPAN, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  A search helicopter on Wednesday
rescued a Japanese scientist and three Filipino guides trapped on a
mountain by landslides unleashed by an earthquake.
<p>
   Yuji Murata, a 41-year-old Tokyo scientist studying orchids for
the Japanese government, and the three Filipinos were picked up
from a clearing on the 5,000-foot (1,515-meter) Mount Bugnay, about
120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
<p>
   The four sought shelter near a Mangyan tribal settlement after
Tuesday's predawn earthquake, which killed 48 people on Mindoro
Island and four others on nearby Batangas province on the main
Luzon Island.
<p>
   Murata told reporters the tribe shared its food, mostly potatoes
and root crops, with the visitors.
<p>
   Murata was taking photographs of the area's profusion of orchids
when the earthquake struck. He had been on the mountain on Mindoro
since Monday.

Serbs and Muslims Battle Near Bihac; NATO Considering Exclusion
Zone
AP Photo VIT102, 103 of Nov. 15
By SNJEZANA VUKIC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina  &MD;  Fighting has exploded along
northern front lines, as dug-in government troops tried to keep
Bosnian Serbs from overrunning the Bihac region and gaining back
other lands.
<p>
   NATO was under pressure to respond to the fighting around Bihac,
a U.N.-protected safe zone in northwestern Bosnia, and to U.N.
charges that Serbs in neighboring Croatia were helping Bosnian
Serbs by providing artillery cover.
<p>
   The mostly-Muslim Bihac region, home to 170,000 people, is
sandwiched between Bosnian Serb forces to the south and east and
Croatian Serbs to the north and west.
<p>
   ``It is unclear who actually is ahead of the game up there at
the moment,'' said Lt. Col. Tim Spicer, a U.N. spokesman. ``There's
quite intense fighting going on ... We can't get close to it.''
<p>
   However, Spicer said there was no indication government forces
were retreating, despite previous U.N. reports that said Bosnian
Serbs had regained most of the territory taken recently by troops
of the Muslim-led government.
<p>
   According to Bosnian radio, 11 people have been killed and 26
wounded in government-held territory around Bihac since Monday.
<p>
   In Washington, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon
told reporters Tuesday that NATO is considering establishing a
heavy weapons exclusion zone around Bihac.
<p>
   A 12.5-mile exclusion zone imposed around Sarajevo in February
largely freed the Bosnian capital from intense Serb bombardment.
The ban on heavy weapons has been backed up by NATO air strikes.
<p>
   NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes is flying to the United
States today for meetings with President Clinton and other
administration officials.
<p>
   NATO officials met Tuesday with Croatian government officials to
discuss a possible air response to Croatian Serb interference in
Bosnia's war. The Serbs deny providing artillery cover.
<p>
   NATO has launched air strikes on Bosnian Serb targets five times
because of violations involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or
attacks on U.N. personnel. The alliance wants to extend its
mandate, currently limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from
Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   ``We would like to see NATO have the ability to respond by full
means to such (cross-border) attacks,'' said Paul Risley, a senior
U.N. spokesman.
<p>
   Bosnian Serb Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, in charge of the Bihac
assault, shrugged off any NATO threat.
<p>
   ``We are ready for a NATO air strike,'' he told the Vecernje
Novosti newspaper in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. ``I personally think
that the safe areas no longer exist.''
<p>
   Serbs and Muslims also were fighting in the Majevica hills in
northeastern Bosnia, and near Mostar on the southwest front. Serbs
claimed gains in both regions, but U.N. officials said the
government army appeared to have the upper hand.
<p>
   Bosnian Serbs also shelled Tuzla, another so-called U.N. ``safe
area'' in northern Bosnia, for a second straight day Tuesday,
killing one resident and wounding three.
<p>
   Bosnia's war began in April 1992, when its Serb minority
rebelled against the republic's decision to secede from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. More than 200,000 people have been
killed or are missing in the fighting.

Australian Businessman on Trial in High-Profile Case

<TEXT>
<p>
   SHENZHEN, China (AP)  &MD;  An Australian businessman whose case has
dramatized the perils of trading in China went on trial on
corruption charges Wednesday, after more than a year in detention.
<p>
   James Peng's case has illustrated the vagaries of China's legal
system. Australian officials, meanwhile, have been accused of not
doing enough to help Chinese-born Peng because he is an immigrant.
<p>
   Peng, 35, was seized last October by police in the Portuguese
colony of Macao and spirited to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese
boomtown that is a cradle of China's economic reforms.
<p>
   He has been detained ever since. Such long detentions are
illegal, but not unusual in China.
<p>
   Peng, in handcuffs and wearing a jacket and trousers, was led by
police into a noisy courtroom at the Intermediate People's Court in
Shenzhen. Bystanders crowded outside to glimpse the proceedings,
attended by about 100 people.
<p>
   A court statement said Peng was accused of embezzling 1.1
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 143,000) from a loan granted
by a state bank in 1989 to Champaign Industrial Co. Ltd., a highly
successful company that Peng had established.
<p>
   Prosecutors said Peng used some of the money to buy watches and
pay his sister's study fees in Australia.
<p>
   Peng faces a second charge of using 290,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs
33,700) in 1992 to repay gambling debts, the statement said. It did
not say where the money came from.
<p>
   One of five presiding judges read out evidence against Peng, who
sat reading documents and taking notes.
<p>
   Asked to comment, Peng denied most of the evidence or said he
wasn't aware of the details. He said documents produced in court
did not carry his signature and argued that the charges were based
only on evidence given by his former business associates.
<p>
   ``I don't understand why they say these things,'' he said. He
looked healthy and sounded calm.
<p>
   The Australian government pressured successfully for Peng to be
allowed to choose his lawyers and for an open trial. It was unclear
how long the trial would last or when a verdict could be expected.
<p>
   Chinese authorities took the extremely unusual step of allowing
a handful of reporters, including one from The Associated Press, to
attend the trial.
<p>
   Photographers and TV crews were banned from the court. But a
uniformed court official took snaps of Peng in court and offered
them for 100 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 13) each.
<p>
   Peng's mother also attended, but his wife did not for fear that
she too could be detained if she came to China.
<p>
   Lina Peng believes her husband was detained because Chinese
officials envied his success. Peng built a reputation by buying
money-losing state-owned textile factories and establishing
Champaign, the first foreign joint venture to be listed on
Shenzhen's stock exchange
<p>
   This July, Shenzhen prosecutors said Peng would be charged with
embezzling U.S. dlrs 1.4 million in loans from a Chinese government
bank.
<p>
   The court considered the case for a month, then returned it to
prosecutors.
<p>
   Lina Peng argues that during the period of the alleged crimes,
Champaign was a private company, 83 percent owned by her husband.

Government Plans Offensive Against Khmer Rouge-Held Temple
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Government troops have been sent to
northwestern Cambodia for an offensive next month to wrest an
ancient temple from Khmer Rouge guerrillas, officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Government spokesman Sieng Lapress said the troops would move
against the Khmer Rouge base around the temple of Preah Vihear
along the Thai-Cambodian border.
<p>
   ``We have plans to liberate it,'' the spokesman told journalists
at a weekly press briefing.
<p>
   Nheuk Bunchay, the armed forces deputy commander, told The
Associated Press that the offensive would start next month and
continue into 1995.
<p>
   About 4,000 government soldiers have been deployed to encircle
the base, which is defended by about 600 guerrillas, he said.
<p>
   For fear of damaging the 9th century temple, artillery would not
be used, he said. Instead, there will be a gradual encirclement and
efforts to persuade the defenders to defect.
<p>
   Both the spokesman and military officer said Phnom Penh would
seek ``cooperation'' from Thailand during the offensive.
<p>
   Cambodia has accused the Thais of aiding Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
including those holding the temple. Thailand has denied it helps
the outlawed group, which brutalized the country during the
mid-1970s.
<p>
   Last week, Co-Premier Norodom Ranariddh said his government had
no plans for a dry-season offensive, but would rid the country of
the Khmer Rouge scourge by developing rural areas.
<p>
   But Sieng Lapress said the planned strike did not contract
Ranariddh's statement because at the time he spoke the government
had no plans for an offensive.
<p>
   ``As long as the Khmer Rouge are alive you cannot say we are not
going to stage offensives,'' the spokesman said.

Azerbaijani Parliament Ratifies Major International Oil Deal
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP)  &MD;  The Azerbaijani parliament has ratified
a $9 billion deal with foreign companies for Caspian Sea oil, one
of the largest contracts ever signed in the former Soviet Union.
<p>
   The 30-year deal, described as the ``contract of the century''
in the Azerbaijani press, was approved Tuesday on a vote of 34-1.
<p>
   The consortium will develop three oil fields that hold an
estimated 3.6 billion barrels of oil. It expects to start pumping
oil in about four years and eventually produce about 600,000
barrels of oil a day.
<p>
   Azerbaijan hopes the oil deal will help mend an economy badly
battered by six years of war with neighboring Armenia over the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
<p>
   The contract was signed in September with a consortium that
includes British Petroleum PLC, Amoco Corp., Pennzoil Co., Ramco
Oil Services Inc., Unocal Corp., McDermott International Inc.,
Turkish Petroleum Co. and Norway's Statoil AS.
<p>
   The Russian company Lukoil and the Azerbaijani state oil company
were also participants.
<p>
   The contract gave Azerbaijan a 20 percent share in the project.
Last week, Azerbaijan traded a quarter of its share to Iran, one of
five nations on the Caspian, in exchange for financing.

``No'' Side Maintains Lead in Norwegian EU Polls
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  Opponents of EU membership held a stable
lead in polls published Wednesday, despite predictions that Swedish
voters's approval of membership Sunday would sway many Norwegians
towards a ``Yes.''
<p>
   Backers of European Union membership had made strong gains in
polls published Tuesday, leading to hopes in their camp that
Norwegians would vote for joining the Union in a Nov. 28 national
referendum.
<p>
   But polls published Wednesday said that a majority of Norwegians
still planned to vote ``no'' while the ``yes'' side remained the
same or lost slightly.
<p>
   In an opinion poll conducted for the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet,
57 percent of those who had made up their minds planned to vote
``no,'' an increase of one percentage point from the newspapers
poll on Monday. The MMI institute said 43 percent planned to vote
``yes''
<p>
   The Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang said its poll, by the Scan-Fact
institute, indicated a closer vote, with 52 percent saying they
would vote against membership and 48 percent saying they would vote
``,yes.'
<p>
   Both newspapers said their figures did not include undecided
voters, still a substantial bloc in Norway.
<p>
   A Norsk Gallup poll  &MD;  released by the TV-2 network on Tuesday  &MD; 
said 37 percent were for membership, 47 percent were against and 16
percent were undecided.
<p>
   In Norwegian EU polls, the survey institutes generally ask about
1,000 people by telephone, which gives a margin of error of three
percentage points.

Baseball Owners Finish Labor Proposal Without Salary Caps
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HERNDON, Va. (AP)  &MD;  U.S. Major League baseball owners were
putting the finishing touches on a new labor proposal Wednesday
before renewed talks with striking players.
<p>
   The owners' new proposal, which asks for a tax on payrolls and
revenues instead of a cap on team salaries, will be presented to
players on Thursday  &MD;  Day 98 of the strike.
<p>
   Mediator W.J. Usery, appointed by President Clinton, told both
sides to ``be prepared to remain in negotiations over several days,
if necessary.''
<p>
   The first joint meeting between players and owners was scheduled
for Thursday at a hotel outside Washington.
<p>
   ``We're going to finalize our plans,'' negotiator Richard
Ravitch said.
<p>
   Owners spent Monday and Tuesday meeting on conference calls,
working out the details of their new tax proposal  &MD;  their first new
offer since June 14.
<p>
   The players union expects the new proposal to be complicated,
and it could take a day or two for them to fully review it.
<p>
   A payroll and revenue tax has been proposed by NHL owners in
their 6-week-old labor dispute with players. The payroll tax in
that plan would rise as high as 122 percent on teams whose payrolls
were substantially above the league average.
<p>
   Baseball management officials have given no indication of how
high their tax would go, but the union would certainly reject a tax
that would inhibit clubs from spending freely.
<p>
   Union officials refused to comment on management's abandonment
of the salary cap plan, saying they wanted to see the offer before
talking about it.
<p>
   Usery, who has mediated several contentious labor disputes in a
variety of businesses, has drawn praise from both sides for getting
them back to the bargaining table  &MD;  and keeping them there.
<p>
   Acting commissioner Bud Selig said he was uncertain if he would
show up at the talks.
<p>
   ``We'll play it as it comes. Hopefully the place to solve this
is at the bargaining table. It's the only place to have a
satisfactory, long term agreement worked out.
<p>
   ``Obviously we'd like to make a deal, but it has to be a fair
deal,'' Selig said.
<p>
   Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington, the new lead
negotiator for the owners, has offered no specific details of
management's new offer.
<p>
   ``It's not a salary cap in the strictest terms,'' he said. ``A
tax concept can look like a salary cap, and any tax plan is meant
to put some controls on labor costs.
<p>
   ``All payrolls would be taxed at a low percentage. All clubs
would be affected above a certain level.''
<p>
   A tax plan was discussed by owners and players during informal
talks in early September. The players offered a plan whereby the
top 16 revenue-producing clubs would pay a 1.6 percent of their
income into a fund to be distributed to small-market clubs with
lower revenues.
<p>
   A similar tax on the top 16 payrolls also would be
redistributed.
<p>
   Selig rejected the plan, saying the tax rate would be
insignificant.

New Zealand Prime Minister Begins Visit to Thailand
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  &MD;  New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger
arrived in Thailand Wednesday for a three-day state visit that will
focus on trade and other economic issues.
<p>
   Bolger is to inspect his government's aid projects in Thailand
and meet with his counterpart Chuan Leekpai and constitutional
monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
<p>
   The two countries enjoy sound political relations and increasing
trade, which is currently in New Zealand's favor.
<p>
   The Thai Foreign Ministry said Bolger, who is accompanied by his
wife, will visit three sites in northeastern Thailand where New
Zealand provides aid or expertise
<p>
   On Friday, he is to meet Chuan and have an audience with the
king and Queen Sirikit. Bolger departs Saturday.
<p>
   The ministry said Bolger and Chuan would discuss ways to
stimulate joint ventures and overcome remaining obstacles to trade
between the two countries. Problems include the quality of some
Thai exports to New Zealand and accusations that Thailand
subsidizes its dairy exports to the Pacific nation.
<p>
   Over the past five years, two-way trade has increased from 2
billion to 5 billion baht (dlrs 80 million to dlrs 200 million),
with Thailand suffering a 1.9 billion baht (dlrs 76 million)
deficit last year.
<p>
   Thailand's largest export item to New Zealand is seafood,
followed by sugar and chemicals. The most important imports to
Thailand are dairy products, fish, paper and wood.

Dollar Firms, Stocks Fall
Eds: Wraps up with closing bonds
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the
sixth consecutive session Wednesday despite profit-taking following
a U.S. interest rate increase. Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell.
<p>
   The dollar finished at 98.62 yen, up 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
Tokyo close but below its overnight New York finish of 98.76 yen.
It now has gained 1.39 yen over six trading days.
<p>
   After opening at 98.61 yen, the dollar ranged between 98.55 yen
and 98.73 yen.
<p>
   Spot trading totaled dlrs 4.4510 billion, down slightly from
dlrs 4.767 billion Tuesday.
<p>
   The U.S. currency strengthened overnight in New York after the
Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates by 0.75
percentage point.
<p>
   A higher U.S. interest rate supports the dollar by making
dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors.
<p>
   ``The dollar remained weaker than its overnight levels in New
York due to selling pressure from (Japanese) exporters at around
98.70 yen,'' said Satoshi Soda, a foreign exchange specialist with
Sakura Bank. ``Profit-taking was another factor.''
<p>
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
85.02 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 19,306.66. On Tuesday,
the benchmark index had gained 130.23 points, or 0.68 percent, to
19,391.68.
<p>
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 3.14 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,525.50. It had
risen 10.82 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,528.64 on Tuesday.
<p>
   Amid a lack of market-affecting news, profit-taking and
arbitrage-linked selling pushed down prices, traders said.
<p>
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 240 million shares,
up from Tuesday's 218 million.
<p>
   Declines led gains 502 to 446, with 216 issues unchanged.
<p>
   The price of the benchmark No. 164 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 95.94 yen, down 0.15 yen from Tuesday's close.
Their yield rose to 4.740 percent from 4.715 percent.
<p>
   Dealers said bond prices fell back in the wake of the yen's
decline against the dollar.

New Tajik President Inaugurated As Border Clashes Continue
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP)  &MD;  Tajikistan's new president was
inaugurated on Wednesday, and he promised to pursue peace even as
fighting continued on the country's war-torn border with
Afghanistan.
<p>
   Emomali Rakhmonov, Tajikistan's leader since late 1992, was
elected Nov. 6 with 60 percent of the vote in the impoverished
former Soviet republic.
<p>
   His only challenger, Tajik ambassador to Moscow Abdulmalik
Abdulladjanov, got 35 percent of the vote.
<p>
   ``As the president I swear to defend the constitution and ...
protect the territorial integrity of Tajikistan,'' Rakhmonov said
during his swearing in Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
<p>
   Voters also endorsed Tajikistan's first post-Soviet
constitution, which declares the president as head of parliament.
<p>
   Rakhmonov came to power during a bloody civil war following the
1991 Soviet breakup which claimed 20,000 lives and turned at least
500,000 people into refugees.
<p>
   Meanwhile, new fighting broke out on the Tajik-Afghan border
Tuesday night, after two groups of Tajik opposition fighters
crossed the border and opened fire on Russian guards.
<p>
   No casualties were reported in the clash, the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday.
<p>
   Despite the latest cease-fire forged at U.N.-backed negotiations
in Pakistan two weeks ago, fighting between government troops and
opposition fighters has continued in the Central Asian region.
<p>
   The rebels are backed by Islamic mujahedeen in Afghanistan,
while government troops have been supported by Russian forces.

Weighty Problem For Pace Bowler Hughes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HOBART, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Pugnacious pace bowler Merv Hughes has
weighty problem as he fights to regain his place in the Australian
cricket team to face England in the upcoming Ashes series.
<p>
   Hughes, who admits to being heavier than he would like, wants
the Australian selectors to consider his Test record, rather than
his weight, when they weigh up their options for the five-Test
series.
<p>
   Hughes is bidding for a Test recall after missing Australia's
recent tour of Pakistan and will have a chance to further push his
claims from Friday, when an Australian XI faces England in a
four-day match at Bellerive Oval.
<p>
   Hughes, 33, has been troubled not only by excess kilos (pounds)
but by persistent knee injuries over the past 12 months.
<p>
   He said Wednesday that he hopes the selectors take into account
his 212 Test wickets, rather than his 106-kilogram (235 pounds)
frame.
<p>
   ``I'm carrying a bit of weight and I have been for a couple of
years, but I'm getting through the games OK,'' he said.
<p>
   ``A lot of people are worried my weight will affect my knees
long term, but I'm doing the job now and that's all I'm worried
about.
<p>
   ``If you're fit and ready to go, then that's it.''
<p>
   Throughout his 53-Test career, Hughes has always been ready to
bowl 25 overs in a day.
<p>
   Former national captain Allan Border said Tuesday that he
believes the selectors should gamble on Hughes, while England
skipper Mike Atherton said a series without Hughes would lack
personality.
<p>
   ``It was good of AB (Border) and Atherton to say what they did,
but the first Test is a long way off,'' Hughes said. ``I can't read
too much into it. I have to play this game and hope to take a few
wickets.
<p>
   ``I'm getting through the overs OK and the incentive and the
motivation has been there to work pretty hard.''
<p>
   The first Test against England begins in Brisbane on Nov.25,
giving Hughes just this match to make his claim.

US Close to Full Diplomatic Ties with Vietnam, Senator Says
AP Photos HAN101,102

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  The United States is close to establishing
full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, but its former enemy still
must do more to clear up the fates of missing American servicemen,
a U.S. senator said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vietnamese must try harder to resolve the remaining 55 cases
of U.S. soldiers and airmen last seen alive in the Vietnam War,
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. Hanoi also must provide more
documents that would help locate other missing, he added.
<p>
   Most of the 1,624 Americans unaccounted for in Vietnam are known
to be dead but the United States hopes to recover their remains.
<p>
   ``I think we're very close,'' said Kerry, co-chairman of the now
defunct Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA Affairs.
<p>
   If Vietnam intensifies its already strong cooperation on the MIA
issue, full relations could come next year, he told reporters as he
neared the end of a two-day visit.
<p>
   Kerry said the newly elected Republican majorities in both
houses of Congress probably would not impede the rapprochement.
Some Republican congressmen also advocate normalized relations, he
said.
<p>
   Kerry and six other U.S. senators on a separate visit met
Wednesday with members of the Hanoi chapter of the unofficial
American Chamber of Commerce of Vietnam.
<p>
   ``A stronger relationship with Vietnam is not merely a matter of
business,'' Kerry said. ``Vietnam can be, and I predict will be, a
very important player and even an ally in the issue of maintaining
stability in this region.''
<p>
   Hanoi could serve American interests by helping the government
of neighboring Cambodia overcome the threat from extremist Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, he said. Vietnam could help integrate
isolationist Burma into the regional economy and also play a role
in U.S. relations with China, Kerry added.
<p>
   Fellow Democrat Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia echoed Kerry's
assessment of Vietnam's overall cooperation on MIAs but expressed a
more cautious approach to normalization.
<p>
   ``We've taken one step,'' he told reporters, referring to the
two countries' agreement in May to open liaison offices in each
other's capitals. ``I think we ought to decide how this does for a
while, then decide where to go from here.''
<p>
   Kerry said he had extensive talks about human rights Tuesday
with Do Muoi, Vietnam's Communist Party leader, raising specific
cases of jailed dissidents.
<p>
   Human rights conditions are improving gradually, he said, and he
advocated greater involvement by Western countries to help the
process along. But he stressed that human rights are not an
obstacle to the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations.
<p>
   ``It hasn't been linked, and it shouldn't be linked now,'' Kerry
said.

Australia Doubles In Size As It Gains New Ocean Territory
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Australia has suddenly doubled its
size.
<p>
   From the Antarctic territories and islands, the remote Christmas
and Cocos Island groups in the Indian Ocean, and Norfolk and Lord
Howe Islands in the Pacific to the Southern Ocean coastline,
Australia's legal boundary now extends 200 nautical miles (223
miles, 360 km) from the coast.
<p>
   The boundary in some places extends even further, to the edge of
the continental shelf, under the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, which went into force on Wednesday.
<p>
   The convention gives Australia legal control of the seas, their
contents, and the undersea mineral wealth of the new Economic
Exclusion Zone.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the convention grants
navigation rights, the protection of the marine environment, marine
resource management, maritime boundaries, maritime zones and mining
of the deep seabed.
<p>
   But the new 5.6-million-square-mile (14-million-square-km)
region ``brings with it enormous responsibilities  &MD; 
responsibilities to explore, to develop, to preserve and to
protect.
<p>
   ``As the custodians of one of the world's largest economic
exclusion zones in the world, Australia's responsibilities are
particularly onerous,'' he said.
<p>
   Greenpeace Australia spokesman Ian Fry said the benefits flowing
from the new treaty were substantial, but that the convention also
established a duty for all countries to protect and preserve the
marine environment and to conserve marine living species.
<p>
   Environmental groups have asked the federal government to
establish a national marine management authority modeled on the
body that manages the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
<p>
   With increasing stresses on oceans and ocean life around
Australia, such an authority would be expected to end outdated
ideas of the oceans as a waste bin, unsustainable fishing practices
and ill-considered offshore oil and gas drilling or seabed mining,
Fry said.

Government To Decide Fate Of VOA Broadcasting Station
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  The fate of a Voice of America
broadcasting station in northwestern Sri Lanka that some villagers
believe could be used for military purposes will be decided by a
government committee, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   Construction was suspended in October after a fisherman was
killed when police opened fired at protesters outside the site in
Iranawila, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Colombo.
<p>
   Ever since construction began in May 1993, villagers and the
Catholic church have opposed the dlrs 60 million station fearing it
will be used for military purposes. Some residents fear the station
will emit harmful levels of radiation.
<p>
   ``The committee will speak with United States embassy officials
and those opposing the station before deciding,'' Dharmasiri
Senanayake, the information minister told reporters.
<p>
   The U.S. embassy says the station's three 500-kilowatt
transmitters will improve the quality of broadcasts to East Africa,
East Asia, the Middle East, Russia and China. It will replace a
40-year-old relay station near Colombo.
<p>
   The committee, comprising the ministers of culture, foreign
affairs and industrial development was appointed by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga on Wednesday. The VOA station was scheduled
to begin transmission mid-1995.

Le Roux Launches Legal Appeal Against Suspension
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP)  &MD;  South African rugby union prop
forward Johan le Roux is taking legal action in a bid to reverse a
19-month suspension imposed on him for biting New Zealand captain
Sean Fitzpatrick on the ear.
<p>
   Le Roux still hopes to represent the Springboks in next year's
World Cup tournament in South Africa, his lawyer said Wednesday.
<p>
   Earlier in the day, Le Roux asked the New Zealand High Court for
a judicial review of his ban.
<p>
   A New Zealand Rugby Football Union judicial committee suspended
him from all rugby for 19 months following an incident during the
second test against the All Blacks in Wellington on July 23.
<p>
   He was found guilty of biting the ear of Fitzpatrick and was
sent home in disgrace by Springbok team management. A New Zealand
Rugby Football Union appeals committee turned down his appeal
against the length of the suspension.
<p>
   The Johannesburg metal broker hopes a High Court hearing in
February will pave the way for his inclusion in the Springbok team
for the World Cup, said lawyer Garth Galloway.
<p>
   South African Rugby Football Union president Louis Luyt and
current Springbok coach Kitch Christie were among Le Roux's most
vociferous critics at the time of the incident.
<p>
   Luyt said Le Roux should be banned for life.
<p>
   ``My instructions from Johan are that the attitudes of Mr.
Christie and Dr. Luyt have changed,'' Galloway said.
<p>
   ``He understands that if the judicial review proceedings are
successful and the sentence was quashed or referred back to the
(NZRFU) appeals committee and the sentence reduced, then providing
his form is good enough he would be eligible for selection for
South Africa.
<p>
   ``We hope for a hearing in February 1995 so he can play the
South African domestic season which starts in March.
<p>
   ``In order to be available for the World Cup starting on May 24,
he will need to play rugby before then.''
<p>
   Galloway said his client's High Court action was based on two
main grounds: that the appeals committee took into account
irrelevant factors and failed to take into account relevant
factors, and that the committee's decision was unreasonable.
<p>
   Galloway declined to identify the factors of relevance or
irrelevance on which le Roux was basing his action, saying it was a
matter for the court to consider.
<p>
   The High Court cannot reduce the penalty imposed on Le Roux. It
can quash the ban altogether, or refer the matter back to the
NZRFU's appeals committee for reconsideration, Galloway said.

Alert For Ship Carrying Explosives For Tamil Rebels
Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with navy and air force on alert for
rebel ship carrying explosives, government comment
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Reports that a ship is heading for Sri
Lanka with explosives for Tamil separatists sent the navy and air
force on alert, military officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   Details of the ship were not immediately known, but the vessel
apparently began its journey from a Black Sea port 10 days ago,
officials said quoting intelligence reports.
<p>
   The military fears the rebels will transfer the 10 tons of
explosives on to small boats after meeting the ship in the high
seas.
<p>
   The navies of neighboring countries have been alerted of the
rebel supply operation, the state-owned Observer newspaper reported
Wednesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, government troops shot dead two Tamil rebels in
separate confrontations, but the guerrilla's unilateral cease-fire
was holding in Sri Lanka, military officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The rebels were killed during cordon and search operations by
the military in eastern Batticaloa district Tuesday. Troops also
recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives and hand grenades,
officials said.
<p>
   Rebels have not launched any attack since Saturday when military
intelligence intercepted messages from Tiger chief Velupillai
Prabhakaran ordering rebels to retaliate only if attacked.
<p>
   Information Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake said the government
had not been informed by the rebels of the cessation of
hostilities. ``We are trying to find out whether it is true,'' he
told reporters.
<p>
   No reason was given for the cease-fire, but Prabhakaran's order
came hours after Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in as president.
Mrs. Kumaratunga polled an overwhelming 62 percent of the vote on a
pledge to end the war.
<p>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga is the first woman to be president in Sri
Lanka. The 11-year-old war has claimed 34,000 lives.
<p>
   Tamils make up about 3 million of the country's 17 million
people and accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination. The
rebels want a separate nation in the north and east.

Canadian Prime Minister Promotes Business with Vietnam
AP Photo planned of 0830 GMT welcome ceremony
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
began a business-promotion visit to Vietnam Wednesday, accompanied
by dozens of Canadian corporate executives.
<p>
   The trip, the first ever by a Canadian prime minister to
Vietnam, follows closely on Chretien's visit to China, where he
presided over the signing of more than 8.6 billion Canadian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 6.3 billion) worth of business deals.
<p>
   Expectations in Vietnam are much lower. Canadian Trade Minister
Roy MacLaren, who opened a Canadian trade office Tuesday in Ho Chi
Minh City in southern Vietnam, said Canadian companies plan to sign
about 50 million Canadian dollars (U.S. dlrs 37 million) worth of
contracts during Chretien's visit.
<p>
   Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet held a welcome ceremony for
Chretien shortly after his arrival, followed by talks.
<p>
   The two governments plan to sign a trade memorandum and renew an
existing textile agreement. MacLaren said in Ho Chi Minh City that
the renewal agreement doubles the size of Vietnam's textile export
quota to Canada, but did not give figures. Vietnam remains a much
smaller source of textiles for Canada than Thailand and China.
<p>
   Canada also plans to pledge 36 million Canadian dollars (dlrs
26.7 million) in new development assistance, he said. Already
pledged development aid averages about 12 million Canadian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 8.9 million) annually.
<p>
   Canadian businessmen traveling with Chretien are scheduled to
sign their contracts on Thursday.
<p>
   Chretien also will preside over the opening of a new Canadian
Embassy in Hanoi, yet another sign of Canada's increased interest
in developing ties with Vietnam. Canada opened diplomatic relations
with Hanoi in 1973 but placed an ambassador here only this year.
<p>
   Vietnam exported 27 million Canadian dollars (dlrs 20 million)
worth of goods to Canada in 1993, while importing just 12 million
Canadian dollars (dlrs 8.9 million) in goods in return. Canadian
companies have invested a total of 132 million Canadian dollars
(dlrs 97.8 million) in Vietnam since 1988.

<p>
   ST. KITTS: Missing Couple Declared Presumed Dead; Brothers
Possible Suspects; Father Resigns Cabinet Posts:
<p>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP)  &MD;  A son of the deputy prime minister
and his girlfriend who vanished October 1 have been declared
presumed dead after medical evidence showed that two skeletons
found matched their sexes and ages.
<p>
   Also Tuesday, Scotland Yard reversed itself and said the
minister's two other sons are possible suspects in the deaths of
36-year-old Vincent Morris and 35-year-old Joan Walsh. The deaths
have been linked to large-scale drug trafficking in this tiny
former British colony.
<p>
   Scotland Yard Superintendent Alec Ross declined to elaborate. He
said after the arrest of Dean and Dave Morris last week that he had
no evidence they killed the couple.
<p>
   Late Tuesday, 59-year-old Sidney Morris resigned his various
government posts: deputy prime minister and minister of education,
youth and social affairs and communications, works and public
utilities. But he will keep his parliament seat.
<p>
   Morris had vowed a day earlier to stay on.
<p>
   His resignation followed mounting pressure from opposition
parties and several business leaders for him to step down. They
said it would be a conflict of interest for Morris to participate
in any cabinet decision about the deaths and ensuing arrests.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  The U-N secretary-general arrived
to discuss taking over peacekeeping from U-S troops, and named an
American general to head up the successor force.
<p>
   U-N chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali came Tuesday to determine how
close the U-S Army is to establishing the ``secure and stable
environment'' required by a Security Council resolution before a
6,000-member U-N force is to take over.
<p>
   In a statement, he said he proposed to President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide that U-S Army Lieutenant General Daniel R. Schroeder lead
the U-N force. He said Aristide accepted.
<p>
   The choice of a U-S officer had been expected for several weeks.
<p>
   Aristide warmly welcomed Boutros-Ghali in a ceremony at the
chalk-white National Palace. Palace guards stood at attention as
Aristide came down the front steps to shake hands with
Boutros-Ghali.
<p>
   At a luncheon at Aristide's home, Boutros-Ghali complimented
Aristide for ``having succeeded in stimulating a powerful current
of national reconciliation.''
<p>
   Aristide, ousted by the army three years ago, returned from
exile October 15 after a U-S-led intervention.
<p>
   The 56-year-old Schroeder would serve an 18-month stint in the
peacekeeping post.

   HAITI STORM: Cleanup Starts After Storm Kills At Least 100:
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  Weary Haitians scooped water out of
flooded shacks in the capital's slums as cleanup began following
Tropical Storm Gordon, which killed at least 100 people and left
thousands homeless.
<p>
   Twenty-seven-year-old Edith Philias said Tuesday, ``We have
hardly anything left.'' Her concrete home in the waterfront slum of
Cite Soleil was waist-high in water at the height of heavy rains
Monday.
<p>
   Philias said she sold some of her few remaining possessions,
including cooking pots and a bathtub, to a pawn shop so she could
pay people to empty the muddy water from her home.
<p>
   Navy Captain Mike Caldwell, a U-S military spokesman, said U-S
Army helicopters carrying relief workers and government ministers
flew over the impoverished Caribbean nation to assess the damage.
The sky was clear but flooding cut off roads to some hard-hit
areas.
<p>
   Prime Minister Smarck Michel declared a state of emergency and
said his government would provide 3 million dollars to help clean
up from the season's deadliest storm.
<p>
   Michel said Haiti, emerging from three years of military rule,
was already unstable and struggling to get on its feet. ``With
Tropical Storm Gordon, we have another emergency on top of it.''
<p>
   CUBA: Economic Crisis Forcing Cubans To Eat Cats:
<p>
   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP)  &MD;  Cuba's economic crisis is so severe
that people are reduced to eating cats.
<p>
   Nora Garcia, head of the Cuban Association for the Protection of
Animals, said Monday, ``You won't see cats in gardens and is very
hard to find stray cats roaming the streets because people are
hunting them for human consumption.''
<p>
   She added, ``The few cats that are left must be placed in cages
or locked up inside homes.''
<p>
   Garcia said th cat shortage has led to proliferation of rats in
Havana, the Cuban capital, causing health problems.
<p>
   Garcia and Maria Ruiz, another association official, traveled
from Cuba to attend the 14th Symposium of the Animal Protection
Federation held in Ponce, on Puerto Rico's south coast.
<p>
   In recent years, meat consumption among ordinary Cubans has been
rare in the Caribbean nation, which is going through its worst
economic crisis since a revolution brought Fidel Castro to power in
1959. Castro's government blames a 33-year old U-S economic embargo
against for its troubles.

   PUERTO RICO: Two Puerto Ricans Named To American League Gold
Glove Team:
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Two Puerto Ricans were among the nine players

Devon White and second baseman Roberto Alomar, a Puerto Rican.
First baseman Don Mattingly and third baseman Wade Boggs were
picked from the Yankees.
<p>
   Also chosen for the American League squad were outfielder Ken

U.N. Urges Western Sahara Referendum
By DONALD W. SWINTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  For years, the people of the Western
Sahara have been promised the chance to choose between independence
and union with Morocco. The U.N. Security Council has made a fresh
appeal to both sides in the dispute to get on with it.
<p>
   After three years of planning and little to show for it, the
council on Tuesday urged Morocco and independence-seekers to allow
``no further undue delays'' for a proposed U.N.-organized
referendum.
<p>
   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is to visit the area
this month to try to coax the two sides into some progress.
<p>
   At stake is the future of the phosphate-rich Atlantic coastal
territory south of Morocco, formerly known as the Spanish Sahara.
Spain ruled the territory until February 1976. Two months later,
Morocco occupied two-thirds of the 288,000-square kilometer
(115,000-square mile) land.
<p>
   Guerrillas of the Marxist Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi
Arab Democratic Republic and began a guerrilla war for
independence. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1991.
<p>
   The referendum has been bogged down by disputes over who should
be allowed to vote. The stalemate has favored Morocco, which has
largely defeated the guerrillas. Originally scheduled for 1992, the
vote now is set for February.
<p>
   A 323-member U.N. mission, including peacekeepers, has
registered less than percent of possible voters at a cost of about
dlrs 40 million annually, according to U.N. officials and
documents.
<p>
   Polisario wants voter eligibility to be based on the 1974
Spanish census, which estimated the population at about 74,000
people. Morocco insists on a count of the estimated 140,000 people
now in the territory.
<p>
   ``Morocco is trying to introduce as many Moroccan citizens as
possible'' to steal the election, Polisario spokesman Radhi Salek
said Tuesday.
<p>
   Salek said the United Nations had received 233,000 voting
applications  &MD;  suspiciously greater than originally anticipated.
U.N. officials have approved only 5,575 of those voters.
<p>
   Morocco's U.N. ambassador, Ahmed Snoussi, attributed the delay
in part to the fact that there are only two registration centers. A
lack of roads makes it difficult to reach and register people, many
of whom are nomads, he said.

Taiwan Bends Rules to Allow Official to Visit Brother in China
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  John Chang, a Cabinet-level minister, left
Wednesday to visit his sick brother in Beijing, a trip that would
make him the most senior Taiwanese official to visit China in five
years.
<p>
   Taiwan's Cabinet waived a ban on high-level officials going to
China to allow Chang to visit his twin, Winston, 53, who has been
in a Beijing hospital since Monday after a brain hemorrhage.
<p>
   Chang heads the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He is the
highest official to visit China since 1989, when former Finance
Minister Shirley Kuo attended a meeting of the Asian Development
Bank in Beijing.
<p>
   Taiwan, seat of the ruling Nationalists who fled to the island
in 1949 after losing a civil war to China's Communists, usually
bans high officials from going to China for private visits. But the
Cabinet decided Tuesday to allow Chang to go on humanitarian
grounds.
<p>
   But Chang still had to travel to Beijing via the British colony
of Hong Kong because Taiwan bans direct air links with the
mainland.
<p>
   Sobbing before his departure Wednesday morning, Chang said he
wanted ``to help my brother, who grew up with me, weather through
this misfortune.''
<p>
   The twins are illegitimate sons of Taiwan's former President
Chiang Ching-kuo and grandsons of Nationalist leader Chiang
Kai-shek.
<p>
   The twins, who take their mother's name, waited until their
father's death in 1988 before confirming they were his sons.
<p>
   Winston Chang is president of Taiwan's Soochow University. He
arrived in Beijing Sunday for a seminar on international law as a
guest of Beijing University.
<p>
   His wife, Chao Shen-teh, and son, Chin-sung, arrived in Beijing
Tuesday.

Germany Beaten in World Cup Warm-up
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  &MD;  Olympic champion Germany was beaten
2-0 by an Australian Institute of Sport field hockey squad
Wednesday  &MD;  a blow to its preparations for the upcoming World Cup.
<p>
   Germany was unable to capitalize on a series of penalty corners
and failed to create field goal opportunities against a tenacious
defense.
<p>
   Glen Kingston netted in the 51st minute and Darren Duff scored
in the 60th minute for the Institute.
<p>
   ``The AIS was a good team, with good tactics, good players, good
coaching,'' said German coach Paul Lissek.
<p>
   ``They would have a chance to beat half the teams in the World
Cup, but we played too slowly out of defense, which gave their
defense time to regroup.''
<p>
   England defeated South Africa 3-1 in another pre-World Cup match
played Wednesday.
<p>
   Robert Pullen shot South Africa ahead with a field goal, but
England responded with second-half goals from Nick Thompson, who
converted a penalty corner, Jason Laslett and Russell Garcia.
<p>
   The 12-nation World Cup begins Nov. 23 at the State Sports
Center in Sydney. The top two teams in each of two groups will
advance to the semifinals. The Netherlands is the defending
champion.

First Lady Demonstrates Support For US Aid Abroad
With Clinton-Asia
By SHEILA McNULTY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  With Republicans threatening deep cuts
in foreign aid, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton viewed a
muddy, smelly slum today to promote the merits of sending money
abroad.
<p>
   ``It's good for the people in the United States,'' she said.
``If you have our government helping people to get better
educations  &MD;  to be healthier, to have better living conditions  &MD; 
then you've got fewer problems that will impact on our foreign
affairs around the world.''
<p>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, who stands to become chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee with Republicans taking over Congress,
has pledged to seek drastic cuts in foreign aid.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton said it was too early to tell whether Helms would
get his way. ``We'll just have to wait and see,'' she said.
<p>
   The first lady made the remarks while standing on the other side
of a foul-smelling river from a slum, with its ramshackle wooden
huts on stilts, laundry hanging on bamboo poles, chickens pecking
at the embankment, and children standing barefoot in the mud.
<p>
   ``This particular settlement is one of the most densely
populated in all of Asia,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``So when you are
looking at this, you are seeing not only the challenges in Jakarta,
but the challenges in much of Asia.''
<p>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development has supported
Indonesia's efforts to revitalize its neighborhoods since 1988 by
guaranteeing dlrs 120 million in loans. The agency has agreed to
provide dlrs 125 million in additional aid over the next five
years.
<p>
   William Frej, director of agency's regional housing and urban
development office for East Asia, said only 30 percent of the urban
population in Indonesia has access to clean water and only 2
percent to a sanitation system.
<p>
   ``This is a program that I think the American public should look
at closely. I think we're having a major impact in developing
countries,'' he said. ``We, hopefully, will be continuing to have
this impact.''
<p>
   He took Mrs. Clinton to a second neighborhood; this one had been
cleaned up under the Indonesian program to build roads, paths,
drainage, sanitation facilities and water supplies in slums.
<p>
   The neighborhood of green and yellow homes, with birds chirping
on front porches, was clean and sanitary. Children waved tiny,
paper American and Indonesian flags at the first lady.
<p>
   ``It's one of the real success stories that we can demonstrate
about development,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   ``With a lot of assistance from our government, and with the
local and national governments here, we've been able to make
tremendous strides in sanitation, in drinking water, in housing and
in a lot of the other changes that we've just seen,'' Mrs. Clinton
said.
<p>
   Ongky Sukasah Hardjakusumah, head of Jakarta's Housing
Department, said U.S. aid has helped in a nation where 60 percent
of the capital's residence live in slums. ``We thank the American
taxpayers,'' he said.

late institutional buying.
<p>

Alert For Ship Carrying Explosives For Tamil Rebels
Eds: UPDATES throughout with navy and air force on alert for rebel
ship carrying explosives, government comment.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  &MD;  Navy and air force units were placed
on alert after receiving reports that a ship carrying explosives
for Tamil separatists was heading for Sri Lanka, military officials
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Details of the ship's course were not immediately known, but the
vessel apparently began its journey from a Black Sea port 10 days
ago, according to officials who cited intelligence reports.
<p>
   The military fears the rebels will transfer an estimated 10 tons
of explosives to small boats that could more easily evade capture.
<p>
   The navies of neighboring countries have been alerted of the
rebel supply operation, the state-owned Observer newspaper reported
Wednesday.
<p>
   Despite the report, the guerrillas' unilateral cease-fire, which
was begun Saturday, was holding on Wednesday even after government
troops shot dead two Tamil rebels in separate confrontations,
military officials said.
<p>
   The rebels were killed on Tuesday during search operations by
the military in eastern Batticaloa district. Troops also recovered
weapons, ammunition, explosives and hand grenades, officials said.
<p>
   Rebels have not launched any attack since Saturday when military
intelligence intercepted messages from Tiger chief Velupillai
Prabhakaran ordering rebels to retaliate only if attacked.
<p>
   Information Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake said the government
had not been informed by the rebels of a truce. ``We are trying to
find out whether it is true,'' he told reporters.
<p>
   No reason was given for the cease-fire, but Prabhakaran's order
came hours after Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in as president.
Mrs. Kumaratunga received 62 percent of the vote on a pledge to end
the war.
<p>
   Mrs. Kumaratunga is the first woman to be president in Sri
Lanka. The 11-year-old war has claimed 34,000 lives.
<p>
   Tamils make up about 3 million of the country's 17 million
people and accuse the majority Sinhalese of discrimination. The
rebels want a separate nation in the north and east.

No Full Privatization As 1.1 Million Subscribe to Renault Shares
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  The French state has no immediate plans to fully
privatize the automaker Renault SA, officials said Wednesday,
though 1.1 million individuals subscribed for shares in a partial
sell-off.
<p>
   The French state is lowering its stake in Renault to just over
50 percent from 79 percent. The public offering of some 37 million
shares priced at 165 francs (dlrs 31) each is expected to bring 8
billion francs (dlrs 1.4 billion) to the government.
<p>
   The individual investors, who placed their orders during a
one-week period ending last Thursday, will receive up to 40 shares
for every 60 requested.
<p>
   The automaker, nationalized after collaborating with the Nazis
during World War II, is the latest to fall under conservative
Premier Edouard Balladur's program to sell 23 large, state-owned
firms.
<p>
   At a news conference Wednesday announcing the results of the
share offering, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said that
Renault's full privatization ``isn't on the agenda.''
<p>
   Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer noted that the company
wouldn't be able to go to the market for additional capital before
a full privatization.
<p>
   Even a small capital increase would tip the state's stake under
50 percent, an emotionally charged issue with labor unions Balladur
can't afford to alienate before his expected presidential bid next
spring.
<p>
   Renault is interested in developing partnerships with other
automakers but has no plans for a full merger, Schweitzer said.
<p>
   Sweden's AB Volvo still holds 11.5 percent in Renault due to an
earlier merger bid. It fell through when Volvo shareholders
rejected an arrangement that left controlling interest of Renault
in the hands of the French government.
<p>
   Schweitzer said Volvo has no intention of becoming a core
shareholder: ``It's clear that Volvo intends to manage this as a
financial investment.''
<p>
   The ministry reported that it will not exercise a 15 percent
clawback of shares from the institutional tranche of the placement
to meet individual demand.
<p>
   Meanwhile, 75,000 Renault employees have also applied to become
shareholders, oversubscribing by about 1.5 times. That placement of
shares hasn't yet been completed.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A drenching Tropical Storm Gordon
swept the southern tip of Florida, spawning a tornado that ripped
through a mobile home park and destroyed at least 50 homes while
damaging 500 more.
<p>
   The storm claimed at least two lives in Florida and grounded a
506-foot (152-meter) freighter near the coast.
<p>
   One person died when the tornado touched down Tuesday in
Barefoot Bay, a retirement community of about 7,000 people,
officials said. Rescuers said six people were taken to hospitals
and at least 29 others were treated at the scene. Two people were
in critical condition.
<p>
   Most of the destroyed homes were of elderly people, said fire
rescue worker Mark Francesconi. About 150 people took refuge in
shelters, he said.
<p>
   Mangled metal hung from trees like huge strips of tinsel and
debris was strewn everywhere.
<p>
   ``Frames of houses, siding, sheds, washers, dryers, a boat
overturned, fiberglass insulation, anything that's in a house was
all over the lawns and the streets,'' freelance photographer Jeff
Cross said.
<p>
   Elswhere in Florida, Elena Quicano, 36, was killed Monday when
she was thrown from her vehicle in a three-car collision and run
over by a pickup at a traffic light broken by the storm, police
said. She was seven months pregnant.

   Gordon moved into the Gulf of Mexico off Key West with 50 mph
(80 kmph) -winds and was expected to slow down for a day or so
after dumping up to 8 1/2 inches (22 cms) of rain on South Florida.
<p>
   Power was restored Tuesday to most of the 397,000 homes and
businesses that were cut off by the storm.
<p>
   At least 100 people were confirmed killed in Haiti, and the
independent Radio Signal FM on Tuesday reported the death toll was
at least 400. Two each died in Jamaica and Cuba as the deadliest
tropical storm of the season spun through the Caribbean.
<p>
   Between thundershowers Tuesday, the sight of the grounded
Turkish freighter Firat just yards from shore in Fort Lauderdale
awed tourists and beachgoers.
<p>
   The ship, carrying 2,640 tons of steel, was anchored a mile (1.6
km) from the beach with a crew of 29 aboard when high winds shoved
it beachward before dawn, Coast Guard spokeswoman Lori Rheaume
said.
<p>
   Broward County employee Stephen Higgins said the three-day storm
had caused worse beach erosion than the fast-moving Hurricane
Andrew two years ago.
<p>
   An oceanfront highway near the grounded ship was lined with sand
drifts.
<p>
   Among the flotsam thrown up on Florida's beaches were five
packages of cocaine. Bricks of about two pounds (0.9 kilograms)
each were found in the St. Augustine area in North Florida.

Earthquake Survivors Look at Grim Future

<p>
   CALAPAN, Philippines (AP) - Mercy Morales' family had been eking
out a simple existence in the central Philippines when Tuesday's
earthquake and tidal wave swept their fishing village. Now four of
their eight children are gone, along with all their material
possessions.
<p>
   ``Not a plate, not a ladle or cloth was left with us. Nothing
remained of our belongings,'' Mrs. Morales said at a government
shelter two kilometers (1.25 miles) from their former village of
Malaylay. ``We do not know where to go now.''
<p>
   Her husband, Celestino, said his small wooden canoe and their
thatch hut were ripped apart by the tidal wave that followed the
predawn quake.
<p>
   The 5-foot (1.5-meter)-high tidal wave also swept away 32 of the
34 bamboo huts in what used to be the Morales' neighborhood. A
jumble of bamboo splints, palm fronds and pieces of clothing were
among the debris of the former village of about 200 people.
<p>
   The bodies of the Morales' four dead children were recovered
several meters away from where their house had stood in Malaylay
village, just west of Calapan on Mindoro Island, about 120
kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
<p>
   The earthquake and the tidal wave killed 48 people on Mindoro
and four others in nearby Batangas province on the main Luzon
Island, disaster relief officials said. At least 135 people were
injured and 10 others were missing.
<p>
   In Mindoro neighborhoods aside from the Morales', the earthquake
and tidal wave destroyed 611 houses and damaged 2,345 others.
<p>
   Danilo Aceveda, a Calapan councillor, said the local government
plans a mass burial Thursday for the local earthquake victims.
<p>
   ``The reason for the mass burial is not only to economize but to
also bring dead relatives together,'' Aceveda added.
<p>
   The local government is helping villagers by giving 10,000 pesos
(dlrs 416) for each family member killed and 5,000 pesos (dlrs 208)
for those injured.
<p>
   Alfonso Umali, the province's administrator, said panic buying,
especially of fuel, has been reported in several towns that were
cut off from the capital town of Calapan.
<p>
   Umali said the local government was studying the possibility of
relocating people whose homes were destroyed by the tidal wave.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, a search helicopter rescued a Japanese scientist
and three Filipino guides trapped on a mountain by landslides
unleashed by the earthquake.
<p>
   Yuji Murata, a 41-year-old Tokyo scientist studying orchids for
the Japanese government, and the three Filipinos were picked up
from a clearing on the 5,000-foot (1,515-meter) Mount Bugnay, near
Malaylay.
<p>
   More than 1,448 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Tuesday and
Wednesday, scientists reported.
<p>
   The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro and
destroyed many of its water mains.
<p>
   The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered six miles (10
kilometers) north of the island. A magnitude of 7 indicates a major
quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
<p>
   The Philippines, a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous
islands, sits on at least four major faults. An earthquake in 1990
killed nearly 2,000 people on Luzon Island.

U.S.-Based Expert on Indian Civilization Dies
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  &MD;  Frederic Spiegelberg, a German-born pioneer
in comparative religious studies who sought out spiritual teachers
in several Asian countries, has died. He was 97.
<p>
   Spiegelberg died Thursday from complications of abdominal
surgery.
<p>
   A professor for more than two decades at Stanford University
near San Francisco, he lectured on the religions of India, the
psychology of Buddhism and the spiritual common ground of the
world's religions. He had visited spiritual teachers in India,
Tibet, China, Japan and Siam and Ceylon  &MD;  today's Thailand and Sri
Lanka.
<p>
   Spiegelberg gained public attention in 1949 when he returned
from India and Tibet with predictions about the coming ``black
ages'' by Nagarjuna, a Buddhist philosopher. The predictions were
contained in a 200-year-old reproduction of a 1st-century
manuscript.
<p>
   In 1955, Spiegelberg compiled the first complete collection of
Tibetan ghost-traps known to be taken out of Asia. The traps are
spindle-like devices wound with colored yarns and mounted on roofs
to catch ghosts.
<p>
   Born in Hamburg, Germany, Spiegelberg earned a doctorate at the
University of Tuebingen in 1922 and later a theological degree from
the Lutheran Church in Germany.
<p>
   While in Europe, he studied with theologians Rudolf Otto and
Paul Tillich, philosopher Martin Heidegger and psychologist Carl
Jung. In 1937, Tillich helped Spiegelberg and his wife escape Nazi
Germany. He joined Stanford in 1941 and retired in 1963.
<p>
   In 1951, he helped found the American Academy of Asian Studies
in San Francisco.
<p>
   Spiegelberg is survived by two daughters and a son. Memorial
services were pending.

Takanohana Remains Unbeaten
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP)  &MD;  Ozeki (champion) Takanohana remained
unbeaten and with a two-victory lead Wednesday with four days left
in the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.
<p>
   American ozeki Musashimaru, with a 9-2 record, was his closest
rival as he sought to clinch a second consecutive tournament title
and likely promotion to sumo's highest rank, yokozuna (grand
champion).
<p>
   At 8-3 were American Akebono, the sport's only active yokozuna;
ozeki Takanonami and No. 13 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Kitakachidoki.
<p>
   Wrestling before a capacity crowd of 10,000, Takanohana fought
off No. 7 maegashira (senior wrestler) Tochinowaka's arm throw and
pushing attempts and forced him out, handing Tochinowaka his fifth
defeat against six victories.
<p>
   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani of Hawaii, charged Takanonami
with hand thrusts and quickly slapped him down.
<p>
   Akebono, or Chad Rowan of Hawaii, grabbed No. 2 maegashira
Kotonowaka's belt, drove him to the ring's edge and threw him down.
Kotonowaka is 5-6.
<p>
   Kitakachidoki pulled down No. 15 maegashira Naminohana (7-4).
<p>
   No. 3 maegashira Daizen, who beat Akebono on the fifth day, sent
out ozeki Wakanohana with hand thrusts for his fourth victory
against seven defeats. Wakanohana is 7-4.
<p>
   No. 5 maegashira Konishiki, or Salevaa Fuauli Atisanoe from
Hawaii, pushed out No. 4 maegashira Kotobeppu for his fifth victory
against six defeats. Kotobeppu is 4-7.
<p>
   In the 26-member juryo division, No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu, or
Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, pulled down No. 5-ranked Tochinofuji
(5-6), and No. 12-ranked Sentoryu, or American Henry Armstrong
Miller, pushed out No. 11-ranked Tatsuhikari (5-6). Both winners
were 7-4.
<p>
   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 4-ranked Ryudo, or
Brazilian Lewis Go Ikemori, drove out No. 4-ranked Kototenko for
his fourth victory against two defeats.
<p>
   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Clinton Presses Suharto on Human Rights, Wraps Up Asia Trip
Eds: UPDATES and revises throughout with Clinton speech delivered,
other details; changes byline.
By TOM RAUM
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  President Clinton pressed Indonesian
President Suharto for more progress on human rights Wednesday,
promising not to sacrifice principles for expanded trade with Asia.
<p>
   ``We cannot turn away from that cause and we will not,'' Clinton
declared.
<p>
   Wrapping up a five-day Asian trip, Clinton told Suharto he would
take him at his word not to move against student independence
protesters once he and his entourage leave, aides said.
<p>
   Clinton made the direct appeal as 29 East Timorese students
continued a sit-in on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy. The students
are protesting Indonesian occupation of the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor.
<p>
   What was Suharto's response? ``He stated he believes the
Indonesian government is dealing with the issue squarely,'' said a
senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition
of anonymity.
<p>
   Some critics have accused Clinton of ignoring human rights for
the sake of increased trade.
<p>
   Clinton was headed next to Hawaii for several days of rest
before returning to deal with tough political challenges at home.
<p>
   As he prepared to leave Asia, Clinton reached out to Republicans
 &MD;  urging them to support both his market-opening moves with Asia
and, more immediately, a new set of global trade-liberalization
rules up for a vote next month in Congress.
<p>
   ``Only a few decisions by Congress have had the same capacity to
show what we stand for and show where we are heading,'' Clinton
told the business group.
<p>
   Some Republicans have urged that the vote on tariff-lowering
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) legislation be
postponed until next year, when they will gain control of both
chambers.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Clinton applauded contracts signed this week between
U.S. businesses and Asian concerns  &MD;  including contracts signed
today in Indonesia worth over dlrs 40 billion, timed to coincide
with the president's visit.
<p>
   These ranged from an Exxon contract with the country's national
oil company to develop an off-shore natural gas field to joint
ventures in telecommunications, power transmission and
environmental cleanup.
<p>
   ``We're grateful for the business,'' Clinton said. ``The most
important thing for me is these contracts will support jobs,
thousands of them, back home.''
<p>
   Human rights was a key item on the agenda as Clinton met with
Suharto in the opulent Jakarta Palace, also the site for a state
dinner that Clinton was attending tonight.
<p>
   In an airy meeting room with elaborate chandeliers and decorated
with huge tropical fish tanks in carved wooden cabinets, Clinton
``raised the subject (of human rights) in firm and forceful
terms,'' Secretary of State Warren Christopher said.
<p>
   The secretary met separately with the government-appointed
Indonesian Human Rights Commission to further press U.S. concerns
about government steps against dissidents, labor leaders and
residents of East Timor.
<p>
   ``The relationship between the United States and Indonesia can
never reach its highest levels unless the people of the United
States have confidence that there is an effort here to respect the
human rights of all the citizens,'' Christopher said.
<p>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, and annexed it a year
later.
<p>
   Clinton's decision to focus on human rights issues appeared to
be an effort to answer human rights activists who accuse him of
ignoring such concerns here and in China for the sake of expanding
trade and commerce in the fast-growing region.
<p>
   He later told the business group: ``Even as we nurture trade and
investment with Asia, we will continue to promote human rights with
conviction, and without apology. At a time when America is strong
and we inspire others around the world, we cannot, we must not, and
we will not turn away from that cause.''
<p>
   His meetings with Suharto wrapped up a three-day visit in
Indonesia, where leaders of 18 Asian and Pacific leaders pledged on
Tuesday to achieve ``free and open trade'' in the economically
booming region by the year 2020.
<p>
   Clinton earlier visited the Philippines.

U.S. Warns Indonesia Relations Will Suffer Over Human Rights
By MARCUS ELIASON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  President Clinton told Indonesian
President Suharto on Wednesday that their two countries could do
great things together, but that Indonesia`s human rights record may
stand in the way.
<p>
   The statement was related by Secretary of State Warren
Christopher after the two presidents met. Secretary of Commerce Ron
Brown said much of the meeting was devoted to human rights.
<p>
   The two were speaking to reporters at the start of a meeting
with members of the National Human Rights Commission, a
government-appointed body set up last year to assuage critics of
Indonesia's conduct.
<p>
   Christopher said Clinton told Suharto that together, their two
large, populous countries could ``provide world leadership.''
<p>
   ``But he also made it clear that the criticism in the human
rights field could be a limiting factor in the exercise of that
leadership.''
<p>
   He said the relationship ``can never reach its highest level''
unless Americans are shown that Indonesia is trying to uphold the
rights of its 180 million people.
<p>
   Brown said Clinton raised human rights at the meeting with
Suharto, and that the 73-year-old Indonesian leader spent most of
the meeting talking about it. He did not indicate what Suharto
said.
<p>
   Indonesia and other Asian countries maintain that Western-style
rights are a luxury in societies that need firm leadership to
achieve more basic rights, such as freedom from hunger, disease and
joblessness.
<p>
   Having spent Tuesday at a summit of the 18-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, which dealt with trade, the Americans
turned their attention to human rights on the last day of Clinton's
stay in Indonesia.
<p>
   Christopher and Brown met the government human rights commission
at the U.S. ambassador's residence, and lower-ranking U.S.
officials later had lunch with other, unofficial human rights
groups.
<p>
   But 20 of the 33 invited refused, saying they wanted a formal,
high-level meeting. Among the decliners was the Indonesian Legal
Aid Foundation, one of the country's best known human rights
advocates.
<p>
   Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had talks
with Indonesian labor authorities, who then published a series of
promises to improve workers' rights, a particular source of
U.S.-Indonesian friction.
<p>
   But this success was eclipsed by protests over East Timor, the
remote province that was a Portuguese colony until Indonesia
annexed it in 1976.
<p>
   On Saturday, 29 East Timorese students climbed over a fence and
camped on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy, demanding independence
and human rights for the territory and a meeting with Clinton or
Christopher.
<p>
   They were still there six days later. And on Sunday, a crowd
rioted in East Timor's capital a day after the third anniversary of
a massacre there by Indonesian government troops.
<p>
   State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the students in the
embassy would not get to see U.S. leaders, because ``you don't
force a meeting with the president or the secretary of state by
scaling the wall of the U.S. Embassy.''
<p>
   Christopher did not indicate how the dispute might be resolved,
but said he had been assured by high-level Indonesian officials
that the students would suffer no retaliation if they left the
embassy.
<p>
   ``We take them (the assurances) seriously and we expect them to
be followed,'' he said.
<p>
   McCurry said Christopher and Brown attended the meeting together
to demonstrate that human rights and trade went hand in hand, and
that no government should imagine it could use a
``divide-and-conquer strategy'' against the United States.

Enbattled Interior Minister Addresses Hostile Parliament

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's embattled interior minister went before a
hostile parliament Wednesday and conceded that police have failed
to keep up with the explosive growth of organized crime in the past
year.
<p>
   Viktor Yerin, who has been criticized by every faction in
parliament, also admitted that more than 500 policemen had been
arrested on corruption charges so far this year.
<p>
   ``I recognize that we haven't yet taken all the neccessary steps
to fight organized crime, corruption and drug trafficking,'' Yerin
told members of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
<p>
   ``The crime situation in Russia remains tense,'' he said, in a
report that outlined his ministry's crime-fighting successes and
failures.
<p>
   Yerin said the overall number of crimes had dropped 4 percent
compared with last year, but that violent crimes had increased.
<p>
   ``Blatant crimes such as terrorist acts, hostage taking and
contract killings have become more frequent,'' he said, adding that
criminal groups are focusing their efforts on the banking and
financial spheres.
<p>
   Last year, there were 650 bomb explosions in which 116 people
were killed, according to Interior Ministry statistics cited by the
ITAR-Tass news agency. In Moscow alone, there are 40 bomb blasts
each month, and half of all contract killings in Russia are carried
out in the capital.
<p>
   Despite a greater threat from organized crime, police have been
forced to make cutbacks because of budget problems, Yerin
complained. Nearly 25 percent of the money promised by the
government this year was never delivered.
<p>
   ``Seventy percent of the money we got was earmarked for wages,
and only 9 percent was assigned for buying weapons and equipment,''
he said. ``As a result, this year we had to cut the purchases of
cars, weapons and protection means.''
<p>
   Despite the problems, there have been some gains, Yerin said.
<p>
   Police this year arrested 25 percent more leaders and members of
criminal groups, and eliminated 255 gangs altogether, he said. They
also seized 9,000 weapons and 4,800 kilograms (10,500 pounds) of
explosives.
<p>
   Yerin also discussed progress in two murder investigations
closely followed by Russian lawmakers: the cases of Duma deputies
killed earlier this year.
<p>
   Andrei Aidzerdzis, a businessman turned lawmaker, was shot in
April on the doorstep of his home in a slaying fellow deputies
blamed on organized crime. Valentin Martemyanov, a Communist Party
deputy, died Nov. 5, five days after being beaten and robbed near
his home.
<p>
   ``We have identified the man who killed deputy Aidzerdzis and we
are searching for him,'' Yerin said. ``We have detained a group of
suspects in connection with Martemyanov's killing and we have
evidence of their implication in this crime.''
<p>
   Some lawmakers were not impressed by Yerin's speech, and
criticized his ministry for protecting the wealthy at the expense
of ordinary Russians.
<p>
   ``There will be no real fight against crime unless the Interior
Ministry's best forces stop guarding banks and private businesses
instead of performing their direct duties,'' said Isa Kostoyev,
chairman of the parliament committee on legal affairs.

   Despite the problems, there have been some gains, Yerin said.
<p>
   Police this year arrested 25 percent more leaders and members of
criminal groups, and eliminated 255 gangs altogether, he said. They
also seized 9,000 weapons and 4,800 kilograms (10,500 pounds) of
explosives.
<p>
   Yerin also discussed progress in two murder investigations
closely followed by Russian lawmakers: the cases of Duma deputies
killed earlier this year.
<p>
   Andrei Aidzerdzis, a businessman turned lawmaker, was shot in
April on the doorstep of his home in a slaying fellow deputies
blamed on organized crime. Valentin Martemyanov, a Communist Party
deputy, died Nov. 5, five days after being beaten and robbed near
his home.
<p>
   ``We have identified the man who killed deputy Aidzerdzis and we
are searching for him,'' Yerin said. ``We have detained a group of
suspects in connection with Martemyanov's killing and we have
evidence of their implication in this crime.''
<p>
   Some lawmakers were not impressed by Yerin's speech, and
criticized his ministry for protecting the wealthy at the expense
of ordinary Russians.
<p>
   ``There will be no real fight against crime unless the Interior
Ministry's best forces stop guarding banks and private businesses
instead of performing their direct duties,'' said Isa Kostoyev,
chairman of the parliament committee on legal affairs.

Grenades Fall Off Back of Army Truck
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Funny what falls off the back of a truck in
Israel.
<p>
   Two crates of hand grenades were found on the main Tel
Aviv-Haifa highway Wednesday morning.
<p>
   Police promptly shut the road, fearing a possible attack,
backing up traffic for miles (kilometers). Demolition experts were
rushed in to make sure none of the explosives would go off. None
did, and nobody was hurt, police said.
<p>
   It turned out that the crates had fallen off the back of an army
truck, said Yuval Sela, spokesman for district police in the
northern port city of Haifa. The military opened an investigation.
<p>
   ``We have a large army and a small country. This happens all the
time,'' Sela said.

Giscard d'Estaing May Join Presidential Race in February
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Beaten his last two tries and no longer considered
a contender, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing on Wednesday
said he'd announce in February whether he'll run for president.
<p>
   That could give him time to see if the two leading right-wing
rivals, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac and Premier Edouard Balladur,
bloody each other too badly for either to win the two-round voting
April 23 and May 7.
<p>
   The election will determine who succeeds Francois Mitterrand, a
Socialist who snatched the presidency from Giscard d'Estaing in
1981, the first left-wing victory since the Fifth Republic was
founded in 1958.
<p>
   Giscard d'Estaing tried a comeback in 1988, but lost the right's
mantle to then-premier Chirac, who was also defeated by Mitterrand.
<p>
   ``The elections we lost, we lost because of long campaigns,''
Giscard told Europe-1 radio. He characterized his strengths as his
age  &MD;  68  &MD;  and presidential experience from 1974-81.
<p>
   If he runs, he'll declare his candidacy in February. The
decision will depend on how the French view ``the very deteriorated
situation in our country.''
<p>
   ``If they expect big reforms, big changes, then perhaps
experience will be useful and I'll see,'' Giscard said. ``If, on
the contrary and for various reasons, they prefer the current
situation, then frankly my experience will serve nothing.''
<p>
   The right hopes to capitalize on its crushing victory over the
Socialists in legislative elections in 1993. But the current
infighting raises the specter of past divisions and defeats.
<p>
   Polls show Jacques Delors, the Socialist president of the
European Union's executive commission, could beat Chirac or
Balladur. He has no serious opposition on the left.
<p>
   Chirac and Giscard head the two largest right-wing parties,
though Balladur, a member of Chirac's Rally for the Republic, has
strong support in Giscard's slightly smaller Union for French
Democracy.
<p>
   Charles Millon, head of the Union for French Democracy's caucus
in the National Assembly, has said that he will run on the party's
ticket if Giscard d'Estaing doesn't.

China's Jobless Rate Up in First Three Quarters of 1994
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  China's urban unemployment rate in the first
three quarters of this year crept up to 2.7 percent, an official
report said Wednesday.
<p>
   That means that 4.36 million urban residents were out of work as
of September, up 160,000 from the beginning of the year, the Xinhua
News Agency said.
<p>
   The unemployment rate was up from last year's 2.6 percent, even
though the number of urban residents with jobs rose by 710,000 in
that period to 148.08 million.
<p>
   Nationwide, the number of employed people rose by 8 million to
653.5 million. The report did not give a nationwide unemployment
rate.
<p>
   China's unemployment rates do not accurately reflect the job
situation because they do not count the millions of redundant
workers kept on payrolls at state-owned enterprises or the millions
of rural residents who have left the land and are without work.
<p>
   The report also said the expenditure on wages in the first three
months jumped 31.7 percent to 41.52 billion yuan (dlrs 4.88
billion), the largest increase in 15 years.
<p>
   It said economists are worried that the huge jump could
contribute to inflationary pressures, which already have pushed the
annual inflation rate past 20 percent nationwide.

Eds: UPDATES with talks between military delegations resuming in
Lusaka; fighting reported around northern city of Uige, news of
truce not yet reached field commanders in Angola
Warring Factions in Angola Sign Truce
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  &MD;  In a ray of hope for a bleeding country,
leaders of Angola's rival armies have promised to put down their
guns at 8 p.m. (1900 gmt) Wednesday after 19 years of civil war.
<p>
   In the hours leading up to the deadline, fighting continued
without pause around the northern city of Uige, the last provincial
capital still in rebel hands, according to army spokesmen in
Luanda, Angola's capital.
<p>
   And some commanders in the field contacted by The Associated
Press said they had not even heard about the truce. A nationwide
announcement was expected later in the day on government radio.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka after a
six-hour round of talks, is the first for Angola since May 15,
1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold. Throughout the
war that began on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975,
peace overtures and treaties have repeatedly failed to stop the
fighting.
<p>
   The truce is meant as the first step in disengaging the warring
sides: the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the
Movement for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, led by Jonas
Savimbi
<p>
   The opposing delegations resumed meetings Wednesday in Lusaka to
nail down remaining details of a permanent accord, scheduled to be
signed Sunday by the two leaders in the presence of U.N. officials
and African heads of state.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is take effect Nov. 22, two days after
the signing.
<p>
   One key issue remaining is how many security guards and weapons
Savimbi will be allowed to retain under the cease-fire. According
to diplomatic sources, the UNITA leader is concerned about the
possibility of assassination.
<p>
   Another issue not fully resolved is how to incorporate UNITA
forces into a new unified defense force.
<p>
   But the fine print did not deter the chief U.N. mediator from
declaring an end to Angola's two decades of conflict.
<p>
   ``There should be no more hostilities in Angolan territory,''
said Alioune Blondin Beye, the U.N. special envoy to Angola who
mediated a year of peace talks in Lusaka.
<p>
   ``The Angolan people have suffered for 20 years,'' he said.
``There is going to be no more killing in Angola.''
<p>
   Although the government has been doing well on the battlefield,
it came under international pressure to agree to the truce Tuesday
to ensure that Savimbi would sign the peace pact Sunday.
<p>
   Political dynamics have changed in recent months with Savimbi's
rebels losing virtually all foreign support  &MD;  including that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime  &MD;  and
government victories on the battlefield.
<p>
   The war began as Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975. More than a half-million people have died and millions are
threatened by starvation and disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, aided by mercenaries who include
retired South African army officers, launched a counterattack last
fall.

Defense Minister Apologizes for Series of Military Lapses
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  &MD;  Taiwan's defense minister apologized
Wednesday for a series of military lapses, including the shelling
Monday of a village in southeast China that injured four people.
<p>
   Sun Chen also expressed regret to the Legislature over the
arrest Tuesday of a lieutenant who allegedly stole grenades to sell
them and over a navy commander who killed himself last week,
apparently because he feared he would be held responsible for a
financial discrepancy in the accounts of his military base.
<p>
   Rear Adm. Li Kai, 45, was found dead in his room at the Wuchiu
military base near the island of Quemoy.
<p>
   On Tuesday, China protested the shelling of Tatou village in
Fujian province as ``a vicious incident that sabotaged the peaceful
atmosphere across the Taiwan Straits'' separating Taiwan and China.
<p>
   Taiwan said the shelling was an accident.
<p>
   Ting Yu-chou, chief of the Army General Staff, told legislators
Wednesday that officers involved in Monday's shelling will be
punished.
<p>
   He blamed the accident on a battalion leader who ordered that
the guns be turned west toward China to avoid hitting civilian
aircraft.
<p>
   The military believes some shells may have failed to explode in
the air as planned and fallen into Chinese territory, just 2.3
kilometers (1.4 miles) away from Quemoy.
<p>
   In another exercise on Quemoy Monday, a shot from a soldier's
rifle accidentally triggered a mine on the coast, shattering
windows and doors of 29 houses, the China Times reported from
Quemoy. The paper quoted residents as saying they thought that
Communist China was shelling the islet again.
<p>
   In 1958, the Communists shelled Quemoy for 44 days, killing some
600 people.
<p>
   Since 1987, there has been a trend toward reconciliation between
China and Taiwan, with a gradual opening of trade and tourism. But
they still maintain strong coastal defenses on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
<p>
   Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province of China and demands
that nations with which it has diplomatic ties sever formal links
with Taipei.

Police Arrest Taiwanese for Alleged Drug Pushing
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP)  &MD;  Police arrested a Taiwanese man after
he handed over illegal drugs to a government agent in a buy bust
operation in a Manila suburb, officers said Wednesday.
<p>
   Wang Hsiu, 40, a frequent Manila visitor, was arrested Tuesday
inside his rented apartment in suburban San Juan town, said Chief
Superintendent Ramsey Ocampo, head of the police Narcotics Command
office.
<p>
   Ocampo said Hsiu handed over a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of shabu,
or methamphetamine hydrochloride crystal, worth 1 million pesos
(dlrs 41,666) to a police agent who posed as a drugs buyer.
<p>
   Appropriate charges are being readied against him, Ocampo said.
Under Philippine law, trafficking in that amount of drugs could be
punishable by death.

Old Owner Wins Privatization Bid for Banco Pinto Sotto Mayor
By TONY SMITH
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP)  &MD;  Old-monied capitalist Antonio
Champalimaud Wednesday bought back from the government an 80
percent share in his old bank Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor for 37.2
billion escudos, outbidding investment bank Finantia.
<p>
   Champalimaud, bidding through his Mundial Confianca insurance
company offered 1,528 escudos for each of the 24.4 million shares
on the block. Finantia offered 1,300 escudos per share.
<p>
   The sealed bids were opened at a public session at Lisbon Stock
Exchange. The government had set a reserve share price of 1,050
escudos on the bank, which was nationalized after Portugal's
leftist 1974 revolution.
<p>
   Before the revolution, Champalimaud owned the bank, Portugal's
sixth largest in terms of deposits and ranked seventh in assets.
<p>
   But market analysts said whoever bought the bank would end up
paying considerably more to cover an undetermined amount of bad
debt, doubtful loans and extra provisions for a pension fund
covering its older-than-average workforce.
<p>
   The government last year rejected a bid of less than 14 billion
escudos for BPSM by Banco Comercial Portugues, saying it was far
too low.
<p>
   BCP, one of the country's more dynamic banks, said it could bid
more without performing a proper audit focussing on bad debt and
the pension fund.
<p>
   Champalimaud had apparently put in a ''safely high'' bid to
ensure he won the bid in the first round, market sources said.
<p>
   If the difference between the two bids Wednesday had been less
than 5 percent, the government had ruled both would have been given
20 minutes to revise their offers.
<p>
   The remaining 20 percent of the bank's shares are to be sold off
at a later date to small investors and employees.
<p>
   The old money of a small group of powerful capitalists who held
sway over the economy before the revolution is gradually filtering
back into Portugal. It is pitted against new financial groups.
<p>
   Champalimaud fled to Brazil after the revolution and rebuilt his
financial empire around the cement business. He later returned and
has gradually expanded business interests here.
<p>
   Finantia's consortium included Swiss bank Corp. and Portuguese
groups, including relatives of BPSM's founding Sotto Mayor family.

Car Prices Fall in Singapore After Touching Record High
By VIJAY JOSHI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE (AP)  &MD;  The cost of buying most types of cars fell
Wednesday after reaching a record high last month that sparked a
national debate on luxury versus need.
<p>
   Still, the drops  &MD;  ranging from dlrs 790 to dlrs 8,000  &MD; 
generally were a relatively small proportion of the final price
tags, which continue to hover around tens of thousands of dollars,
even for family sedans.
<p>
   Under regulations to prevent traffic congestion, car buyers in
Singapore must bid at monthly auctions for the right to own cars.
The prices of these licenses, known as ``certificates of
entitlement,'' in the past few years have typically been several
times ex-factory car costs.
<p>
   High import duties, registration fees and road taxes also have
helped make car prices in Singapore the highest in the world.
<p>
   When the COE was introduced in May 1990, its price fluctuated
with demand. But in October this year, the already inflated prices
reached exorbitant heights.
<p>
   As public frustration became evident against paying through the
nose for what is seen as a basic necessity, the government
announced it would study other methods to increase the number of
car owners and still keep traffic manageable.
<p>
   At the height of the debate, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had
told reporters jokingly: ``It is worrying me most because I have to
face elections.''
<p>
   Singapore has maintained that artificially steep costs are
necessary to avoid turning this land-scarce city state into one
large parking lot.
<p>
   At the auction for December COEs, the only bid that exceeded
last month's was for 2000cc and bigger capacity cars  &MD;  up by about
8,500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 5,800) to 110,500 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 76,200).
<p>
   All other cars would cost less, the biggest saving being 11,600
Singapore dollars (dlrs 8,000) for 1,001cc to 2,000cc cars. But
with the new COE price of 83,500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 57,586), a
new Mitsubishi Space Wagon would cost 186,400 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 128,551).
<p>
   In comparison, a Cadillac DeVille Concours in the United States
is priced at dlrs 37,000.
<p>
   It was not clear what caused the slump, but car dealers said the
prices may have hit a peak.
<p>
   ``A lot of people were getting scared. We hope the COE comes
down further in the new year,'' said one dealer, Lee Gim Meng.
<p>
   In the last few years, the number of vehicles in Singapore has
increased at a annual rate of 3.1 percent, including cars at a rate
of 6.5 percent. There are about 300,000 cars among Singapore's 3.3
million residents, or one for every 10 people.

``Free Willy'' Campaign On For Whale Trapped in Australian River
AP Photo SYD101
By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  &MD;  For 92 days, ``Willy the Whale'' has
been up a river, blocked from freedom in the Pacific Ocean by a
sandbar, and conservationists who've tried to free him say Willy
may be running out of time. The uncooperative whale has repeatedly
broken through nets and defied efforts to herd it out to sea using
boats and pontoons. Now rescuers are worried it is losing weight
and weakening, from hunger or illness.
<p>
   The 30-foot (nine-meter), 10-ton, rare tropical Brydes whale is
stranded in the Manning River near Taree, a town on the New South
Wales coast about 140 miles (230 kms) north of Sydney. It
apparently slipped over the sandbar during a high tide, and now
can't find its way back.
<p>
   ``Willy,'' as the whale has been dubbed by tourists, even though
its gender is unknown, is attracting an outpouring of public
sympathy and affection.
<p>
   The ``Willy'' nickname is lifted from a Disney movie ``Free
Willy,'' about a boy who helps a domesticated killer whale gain its
freedom from captivity.
<p>
   The tabloid Telegraph Mirror newspaper runs a ``Willy Watch''
column daily, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service has been
deluged with questions about the whale's welfare and suggestions
for ways to free it.
<p>
   People want to know why Willy cannot be lifted out with a
helicopter, and why the sand bar cannot be dredged to create a
channel to allow the whale to swim out to sea.
<p>
   Others suggest simply feeding the whale, or wooing it to sea
with recordings of whale courting songs.
<p>
   But Alistair Howard, the executive director of the Parks
Service, says the ideas were impractical. For starters, no
helicopter in Australia is capable of lifting 10 tons.
<p>
   ``To lift it out with a helicopter we'd have to catch it first
and that's what's proving to be the hard task, and anyway the
helicopter noise would probably scare it to death,'' Howard said.
<p>
   The Park Service had investigated dredging the sandbar at the
mouth of the river, but the sand would likely shift within 48
hours. Experts say the channel would have to stay open for weeks so
the whale could discover the dredged opening and find the way out.
<p>
   ``As for feeding the animal 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of live
fish a day  &MD;  that's just impossible,'' Howard said. ``For one
thing, how would you deliver it to the whale?''
<p>
   Willy is gobbling plenty of fish, and there may not be enough in
the river to sustain him much longer. The Taree Fishing Cooperative
of professional anglers estimates that fish stocks in the river
have dropped by 85 percent. They blame it on Willy.
<p>
   ``As for whale courting songs, the tropical whale is so rare,
we've not been able to find any recordings of it communicating,''
Howard said.
<p>
   More than dlrs 20,000 (U.S. dlrs 15,000) and hundreds of hours
had been spent on rescue attempts since September. The Parks
Service has joined forces with Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney, Pet
Porpoise Pools, Sea World and ORRCA, the Organization for the
Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia, to free the whale.
<p>
   ``We don't want him to be domesticated or a tourist
attraction,'' a Parks Service spokeswoman said Wednesday ``It's a
wild animal.''

National Assembly Approves Mandela Pay Cut
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  President Nelson Mandela's pay
has been cut by 17 percent, and the money saved passed on to social
and economic programs.
<p>
   The cut was approved by the National Assembly Tuesday.
<p>
   ``The point of the cuts is to reduce state consumption and to
focus on the people,'' said Joel Netshitenzhe, Mandela's spokesman.
``Mandela has always had a modest lifestyle. He wanted this.''
<p>
   Mandela's salary of 575,000 rand (dlrs 164,285) will be cut to
460,000 rand (dlrs 131,428). His personal allowance will be cut
from 115,000 rand (dlrs 32,857) to 92,000 rand (dlrs 26,285).
<p>
   Salaries of other public officials have already been cut and
senior public servants' salaries have been frozen.
<p>
   Mandela won the presidency in the first all-race election in
April. He has since pledged to redistribute the country's wealth
and improve living conditions of South Africa's disadvantaged.

China's Annual Beer Output Hits 14.5 Million Tons
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  China's annual output of 14.5 million tons of
beer ranks it second in the world in quantity, an official report
said Tuesday.
<p>
   The official Xinhua News Agency did not say whether the figure
refers to this year's output or present annual output capacity.
China produced 12.25 million tons of beer in 1993, making it the
world's second-largest beer brewer behind the United States.
<p>
   However, with China's population of 1.2 billion, per capita
consumption is only 10 liters (10.6 quarts) annually, or less than
half the world average of 22 liters (23.32 quarts). That compares
with 145 liters (153.7 quarts) in Germany and 120 liters (127.2
quarts) in the United States.
<p>
   Therefore, Qi Zhidao, president of the China Brewers'
Association, predicted a bright future for China's beer industry.
He added that beer prices are low in China, about one-third the
world average.
<p>
   Qi said there is much room for expansion of production. Only 3
percent of China's nearly 600 breweries have annual output
capacities of 100,000 tons. Capacity for most is less than 30,000
tons.

Unemployment Soars in Russian Far East
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP)  &MD;  Unemployment in Russia's Maritime
region has doubled in the past year, as cuts in defense spending
take their toll on local industries, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Wednesday.
<p>
   In the Pacific coast city of Vladivostok alone, about 30
state-owned industries have had mass layoffs in the past year,
officials at the Maritime Employment Center said.
<p>
   The job shortages are especially hurting women, the news agency
said.
<p>
   Unofficial unemployment  &MD;  which includes people listed as
working shortened shifts or on long-term unpaid vacation  &MD;  has
risen four to five times since 1993, the employment officials said.
<p>
   Regional authorities expect unemployment to continue growing at
least for the next few months, as other enterprises close or reduce
production.
<p>
   Unemployment throughout Russia has been rising steadily since
1992. Figures vary widely, but the Federal Employment Service said
that about 5 million people were actively looking for work as of
September, for a national unemployment rate of roughly 6 percent to
7 percent.
<p>
   Employment figures in Russia are controversial, mainly because
of the high level of unofficial employment and the country's
growing informal sector.

Government's Fate Rides on No-Confidence Motion
EDS: UPDATES with Parliament to start an hour late at Reynolds'
request, graf 3
By ROBERT BARR
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  One vote could seal the fate of Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds' government Wednesday, and it's all down
to one man.
<p>
   Dick Spring, deputy prime minister and leader of the Labor
Party, will decide for his party whether Reynolds' speech to
Parliament Tuesday did enough to heal the rift in the two-year-old
coalition.
<p>
   Parliament delayed a crucial no-confidence debate for an hour
Wednesday morning after Reynolds requested time to arrange the
day's business.
<p>
   Reynolds on Tuesday had promised a shakeup of the attorney
general's office following uproar over its failure to deal with an
extradition request for a priest accused of child sexual abuse. But
Reynolds continued to defend the promotion of Attorney General
Harry Whelehan to president of the High Court.
<p>
   ``I believe the national interest requires continuity (of
government) at this time,'' Reynolds told the Dail, the lower house
of Parliament, Tuesday.
<p>
   But several Labor lawmakers said Tuesday they thought Reynolds
hadn't done enough, though all stressed that Spring would decide
whether the party remains in government.
<p>
   John Mulvihill, a Labor lawmaker from Cork, said: ``I don't
think there was enough ... to satisfy the Labor Party.''
<p>
   Derek McDowell, a Labor lawmaker from Dublin, said ``My gut
feeling is that this particular administration is at an end.''
<p>
   Spring said nothing following Reynolds' speech, and Ruairi
Quinn, Labor's deputy leader, said Tuesday: ``It's simply
impossible to predict what's going to happen.''
<p>
   If Reynolds loses the no-confidence vote, he is expected to ask
President Mary Robinson to dissolve Parliament and call an
election. However, she could refuse and give other parties a chance
to form a government.
<p>
   Reynolds staked his defense in part on the budding peace process
in Northern Ireland, following the Irish Republican Army cease-fire
10 weeks ago. He praised Spring for his contribution as forign
minister.
<p>
   Reynolds told the Dail Tuesday: ``It will be a great pity if a
government that is achieving rapid economic progress, that has
achieved the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in over 25
years, and that has a fine legislative program, should be placed in
jeopardy over misunderstandings surrounding a single judicial
appointment.''
<p>
   Sinn Fein, the party allied to the IRA, has urged Spring and
Reynolds to resolve their differences. But Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel (cq) McLaughlin said Tuesday the party was prepared to work
with any party in government.
<p>
   ``The peace process is in no danger from a change of
government,'' said Mary Harney, leader of the small Progressive
Democratic party. She said all parties were committed to promoting
peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
<p>
   The breaking point for the coalition came last Friday when
Reynolds pushed ahead with Whelehan's appointment, after Labor
walked out of a Cabinet meeting. Reynolds said he regretted any
offense caused but said it was ``inadvertent.'
<p>
   John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, said he believed Reynolds
deliberately snubbed Labor.

BC-Egypt-Suez Canal
Chairman: No Change In Tolls For 1995
SALAH NASRAWI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISMALIYA, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  The chairman of Suez Canal Authority said
Wednesday that despite a decline in revenue in 1994, there will be
no change in tolls for next year.
<p>
   The chairman, Mohammed Ezzat Adel, spoke with reporters on the
eve of the 125th anniversary of the canal. The 195 kilometer (121
mile) canal was opened for international navigation on Nov. 17,
1869.
<p>
   Adel disclosed that canal revenue would total about dlrs 1.87
billion this year, down 4 percent from dlrs 1.95 billion in 1993.
He said he expected income to return to the dlrs 1.95 billion level
in 1995.
<p>
   Still, he said, ``the level of tolls in 1995 will be kept
unchanged.''
<p>
   He blamed this year's decline on sluggish economic performance
in Europe and changes in international trade patterns, including a
reduction in the number of Japanese cars shipped to the West
because of quotas and other restrictions.
<p>
   Adel acknowledged, too, that the canal faces rising competition
from pipelines, including a new gas line feeding Europe via
Algeria.
<p>
   Canal officials ``are flexible to face up to the changes'' in
the market, he added.
<p>
   Adel said that to be more competitive, the canal was offering
discounts of up to 35 percent for tankers carrying liquefied
natural gas from the Persian Gulf.
<p>
   He said that a tanker carrying gas from the United Arab Emirates
to Europe had gotten a discount this month.
<p>
   The canal, which had been limited to ships with a maximum
draught of 53 feet, has been widened and now can accommodate a
draught of up to 56 feet.
<p>
   The next phase of the project will widen and deepen the channel
so that by October 1996, ships of up to 59 feet in draught can use
it.
<p>
   The Suez Canal, which is owned by the government, is one of
Egypt's largest earners of foreign currency, along with tourism and
money sent home by nationals working abroad.
<p>
   Adel said that there are no plans to privatize the canal,
although the government may sell some of its affiliates, such as
shipyards and ship servicing companies.

Singapore Firm Reported Licensed to Make Cigarettes in Vietnam
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  British American Tobacco Co. has obtained
a license to begin making cigarettes in Vietnam, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The Singapore-based company will manufacture its 555 brand
cigarettes in cooperation with the Vietnam Tobacco General Corp.,
the Saigon Newsreader reported.
<p>
   BAT is one of three foreign cigarette makers so far to win
approval to operate in Vietnam. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International
Inc., based in the United States, and Rothmans of Pall Mall Pte.
Ltd., of Singapore, are licensed as well.
<p>
   Foreign cigarettes enjoy strong popularity among Vietnamese
smokers, most of whom are men.
<p>
   British American Tobacco received a license to operate a plant
with its partner in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's biggest city, the
paper said. It gave no details about the size of BAT's investment,
its share in the project or its production plans.
<p>
   Representatives of the two companies could not be reached for
immediate comment. It was unclear whether the State Committee for
Cooperation and Investment  &MD;  Vietnam's regulatory agency for
foreign investment  &MD;  has given final approval for the project.
<p>
   R.J. Reynolds became the first U.S. company to form a venture to
produce cigarettes in Vietnam when it signed a dlrs 21.2 million
joint-venture agreement last week. It plans to make 165 million
packages of Camel, Salem, Winston and More brand cigarettes here
each year.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Vietnam authorized Rothmans to make Dunhill
brand cigarettes. Rothmans plans to produce 24 million packages of
Dunhill in 1994 alone, according to the most recent issue of the
Vietnam Investment Review.

Berlusconi Government, Unions in Growing Clash
Eds: UPDATES with debate begins, exact time of vote uncertain but
not expected before 1400 GMT
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  The Northern League on Wednesday assured its support
for the government in a confidence vote called by Premier Silvio
Berlusconi in an effort to push forward with his austerity budget.
<p>
   But the League, often a reluctant partner in the conservative
governing coalition, also promised to promote negotiations with
labor unions, which have called a general strike to protest
proposed cutbacks in Italy's generous pension system.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's
position as debate began in the Chamber of Deputies, said the
League ''recognized the need for the country to be governed.''
Berlusconi would have to resign if he lost the vote.
<p>
   The vote was expected later in the day, delayed by opposition
promises to filibuster to slow approval of the budget.
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   ``It's a sign of serious arrogance, but also weakness in the
government,'' Massimo D'Alema, leader of the leftist opposition
Democratic Party of the Left, said Tuesday.
<p>
   At the same time, Berlusconi says he wants to meet with the
nationwide labor federations next week. And government officials
met Tuesday night with opposition legislators to hear their request
to slice away the pension cuts from the budget package.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
gelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome. They
were given three hours of live coverage on RAI state television's
third channel, long under left-wing influence and hostile to
Berlusconi.
<p>
   The unions hardened their stance Tuesday, calling for an
eight-hour general strike Dec. 2.
<p>
   ``The declaration of war is accepted,'' said Fabio Mussi, a
lawmaker with the Democratic Party of the Left.
<p>
   Berlusconi said the government must stick to its plan to send a
message to international financial markets that it was serious
about cutting a dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   The government won a confidence vote in the Chamber Monday
night, 321-131, on a proposed amnesty on illegal construction
expected to bring in dlrs 3.3 billion from back taxes and fines.
<p>
   But things won't be so easy when the budget plan reaches the
Senate. There, the coalition government of the federalist Northern
League, right-wing National Alliance and Berlusconi-formed Forza
Italia (Let's Go, Italy) falls short of a majority.
<p>
   The budget must be passed by Dec. 31.

EU Economics Chief: US Interest Rate Hike Will Not Affect Europe's
Recovery
By ELIZABETH D. WISE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  The European Union's economics chief
said Wednesday that the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates will
not damage Europe's economic recovery.
<p>
   ``The recovery in the European Union will go on. It will not be
affected by what happened in the United States,'' said Economics
Commission Henning Christophersen.
<p>
   He said the U.S. Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to raise
short-term interest rates by 0.75 percent will have less impact on
Europe than future directions in Washington's fiscal policy.
<p>
   ``The decision has short-term implications only,'' he said.
``More important is what happens in U.S. fiscal policy.''
<p>
   The 1995-1996 U.S. budget deficit will rise unless Washington
takes further steps to narrow it, Christophersen predicted.
<p>
   Interest rates in some European countries may still have room to
fall, despite the U.S. tightening, Christophersen said.
<p>
   ``I don't think you can exclude that'' he said.
<p>
   Economies in EU member states are not all at the same level, he
added. ``Some have high growth, but others could have more room for
manoeuver.''
<p>
   Christophersen also said there are no signs of inflationary
pressures in Europe's largest economies.
<p>
   Most EU economies, including France and Germany, are still in
the early stages of recovery, when inflation is unlikely to appear.
Even in Britain, where the recovery is most advanced,
Christophersen said there is no evidence of real inflation.
<p>
   ``We do not see real inflationary pressures for the time
being,'' he said.
<p>
   Christophersen said he wasn't surprised by the U.S. discount
rate rise to 4.75 percent.
<p>
   Despite the rise, Christophersen said EU governments do not have
to tie their interest rates to those set by Washington.
<p>
   ``There can't be a complete separation, but that (decoupling) is
possible if we behave in an orderly way,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Governments in member states should send clear signals to the
financial markets to improve fiscal policy,'' he added.
<p>
   Christophersen declined to comment on whether the EU should help
prop up the dollar, which strengthened on the news of the U.S.
interest rate hike.
<p>
   But he added, ``The position of the dollar is important for us.
It has a direct and immediate impact on our competitiveness.''

Peruvians Wait As Miami Court Considers Their Claim on Wanted
Financier

<TEXT>
<p>
   LIMA, Peru (AP)  &MD;  Depending on who's talking, Carlos Manrique is
Peru's biggest sinner or its next saint. All agree, however, that
he's its most wanted man.
<p>
   Once Peru's businessman of the year, Manrique, 58, is now in
prison in Miami, awaiting extradition in the biggest embezzlement
case in Peru's modern history.
<p>
   Prosecutors say Manrique devised an elaborate pyramid scheme
that bilked 160,000 people out of dlrs 350 million. The case has
come to highlight the desperation of Peruvians trapped by poverty
and economic stagnation.
<p>
   It also punched holes in President Alberto Fujimori's celebrated
campaign to stamp out corruption. Despite a warrant for his arrest,
Manrique slipped out of the country with an illegal passport.
<p>
   Manrique is charged with defrauding depositors who invested in
his quasi-bank at the height of Peru's recession. The collapse of
Centro Latinamericano de Asesoria Empresarial, known by its acronym
CLAE, left many penniless.
<p>
   ``He's an intelligent crook,'' said Toribio Roque, one of about
800 people who queued up last week to register a claim in hopes of
eventually recovering money.
<p>
   ``That money was the product of our hard work. Along came that
trickster and now we have nothing,'' said Nelly Velasco, who lost
dlrs 5,000.
<p>
   Not every depositor blames Manrique, a short, dark-skinned man
from Cuzco who didn't fit the mold of Peru's white business elite.
<p>
   ``For me, Mr. Manrique is not a swindler. The swindler is the
government,'' said retiree Antonio Cardenas, who lost his life
savings.
<p>
   In its heyday in 1991 and 1992, CLAE was seen by many Peruvians
as a way out of poverty.
<p>
   Tens of thousands who lost their jobs as the government trimmed
bureaucracy and pared state companies for privatization invested
their severance pay in CLAE.
<p>
   While conventional banks paid interest of around 6 percent, CLAE
was paying up to 20 percent. Many people lived off that interest.
<p>
   The government intervened in CLAE in April 1993, saying the
unregulated financial company was insolvent. It backed off when
100,000 people turned out at a downtown plaza to support Manrique.
<p>
   The government gave CLAE time to straighten out its affairs and
register with regulators. Manrique, meanwhile, assured depositors
that CLAE would cover its debts. It never did.
<p>
   ``The intervention in CLAE was done in the worst possible
manner,'' said political analyst Fernando Rospigliosi. ``The
consequences are clear: CLAE closed (and) the money it had
disappeared.''
<p>
   Authorities finally ordered Manrique's arrest in February when
he couldn't show what CLAE had done with deposits. Investigators
who seized the company's offices found only a few thousand moldy
U.S. dollars in a safe.
<p>
   Manrique was arrested Oct. 31 in Miami and, claiming he is the
victim of a vendetta by Fujimori, is seeking political asylum in
the United States. An extradition hearing is set for Dec. 30.
<p>
   Rospigliosi said the CLAE scandal could come back to haunt
Fujimori, who is running for re-election in April.
<p>
   ``Most CLAE depositors feel that one way or another the
government toppled CLAE,'' said Mario Escobar, a teacher who lost
dlrs 2,000. ``Whether they put Manrique in prison or not is not the
issue. They just want their money back.''

No Change In Suez Canal Tolls For 1995
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISMALIYA, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  Despite declining revenues, the Suez
Canal will not raise tolls in 1995, the chairman of Suez Canal
Authority said Wednesday.
<p>
   Mohammed Ezzat Adel said he expected income next year to return
to the 1993 level of dlrs 1.95 billion, after a 4 percent drop this
year. He spoke with reporters on the eve of the 125th anniversary
of the canal. The 195-kilometer (121-mile) canal was opened for
international navigation on Nov. 17, 1869.
<p>
   Adel blamed this year's decline on sluggish economic performance
in Europe and changes in international trade patterns, including a
reduction in the number of Japanese cars shipped to the West
because of quotas and other restrictions.
<p>
   Adel acknowledged that the canal faces rising competition from
pipelines, including a new gas line feeding Europe via Algeria.
<p>
   Adel said that to be more competitive, the canal was offering
discounts of up to 35 percent for tankers carrying liquefied
natural gas from the Persian Gulf.

Latest in New York Nightlife: Theme Bar for Twins

<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Seeing double is normal at this bar.
<p>
   In a city where bars themes' range from lunar landscapes to
California beaches, the Manhattan nightspot Twins offers a new
perspective. Every job  &MD;  bartenders, hostesses, waiters and doormen
 &MD;  has been filled with identical twins, each pair wearing the same
clothes and working the same shifts.
<p>
   And it's run, of course, by identical twins.
<p>
   ``It's a natural thing for us, having twins here,'' said Lisa
Ganz, who greeted customers on opening night Tuesday with her
co-owner and sister, Debra, both in matching red pantsuits. ``I
guess we're a little like a freak show, in a way.''
<p>
   In the dimly lighted interior, twin televisions are perched
above a row of twin barstools. There are double doorknobs and
mirrored plates, and the kitchen's version of Mexican food is Twin
Peaks Nachos. Behind the bar rises a tile-covered model of the
World Trade Center's twin towers, a New York landmark.
<p>
   But the real attention-getters are the live twins.
<p>
   ``It's got such a cachet to it,'' said customer Tracey Ferry.
``It's not your regular, everyday bar. It's entertainment.''
<p>
   Ganz and her sister were working separate jobs in the restaurant
business when they began planning Twins two years ago. They hired
employees through newspaper ads and word of mouth.
<p>
   But hiring siblings has its problems. When one twin gets sick,
neither can work and they must find another set to fill their
shift.
<p>
   Maria Milano and her sister, Trisha, jumped at the chance to
work at Twins when they read about the restaurant in a newspaper
ad. They'd worked together before, as waitresses and in a rock
video.
<p>
   ``It's great to see so many twins,'' said Maria Milano, who was
wearing a long black dress like her sister and a name tag that said
``Maria not Trisha.''
<p>
   She smiled and added, ``We don't think we look alike at all.''

EU Economics Chief: US Interest Rate Hike Will Not Affect Europe's
Recovery
EDS: Adds EU economic statistics, definition of discount rate. No

   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  The European Union's economics chief
said Wednesday that the rise in U.S. short-term interest rates will

   ``I don't think you can exclude that'' he said.
<p>
   Economies in EU member states are not all at the same level, he
added. ``Some have high growth, but others could have more room for
manoeuver.''
<p>
   The U.S. move brought its discount rate to 4.75 percent from 4
percent. In comparison, Germany's discount rate, as set by its
Bundesbank, is 4.5 percent.
<p>
   The discount rate is the rate at which the fed or central bank
makes emergency loans to commercial banks.
<p>
   Christophersen also said there are no signs of inflationary
pressures in Europe's largest economies.
<p>
   Most EU economies, including France and Germany, are still in

interest rate hike.
<p>
   But he added, ``The position of the dollar is important for us.
It has a direct and immediate impact on our competitiveness.''
<p>
   In June, the EU's executive commission projected 1.6 percent
growth in the trade bloc's gross domestic product in 1994 and 2.5
percent in 1995, compared to a contraction of 0.5 percent in 1993.
<p>
   The commission projected average EU inflation would slip to 3.3
percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1995, down from 3.9 percent
last year.

World's Largest McDonald's Fights Pressure to Move

<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  The golden arches on the corner of Beijing's
busiest shopping street  &MD;  now one of the city's modern landmarks  &MD; 
could face the wrecking ball if an influential Hong Kong developer
gets his way.
<p>
   The McDonald's on the corner of Beijing's Wangfujing Street and
the Avenue of Eternal Peace, just two blocks from Tiananmen Square,
now sits amid the rubble of buildings already torn down to make way
for a huge real estate project.
<p>
   The 108,000-square-meter (1.2-million square-foot) site
surrounding the McDonald's outlet reportedly is destined to become
the Oriental Plaza, a commercial, office and residential complex
planned by Hong Kong developer Li Ka-shing.
<p>
   Most of the vast block already has been cleared. Other
Wangfujing landmarks, such as the 45-year-old Xinhua Bookstore,
have closed and begun moving out.
<p>
   McDonald's says it has not been approached by the developers of
the planned commercial complex. But it also says it has no
intention of vacating the site of its biggest restaurant in the
world.
<p>
   ``McDonald's believes it has the legal right to be there,''
company spokeswoman Lucy Chen told The Associated Press Wednesday.
<p>
   ``We do not want to leave right now,'' Chen said of the
2,520-square-meter (28,000-square-foot), two-story restaurant,
which opened only two years ago.
<p>
   Staffers in charge of the Oriental Plaza development did not
return phone calls and were not available for comment.
<p>
   The Hong Kong newspaper Eastern Express reported Wednesday that
McDonald's had refused to relocate in the new commercial complex,
which is already under construction.
<p>
   The standoff could prove to be a case study in Beijing's power
politics.
<p>
   Beijing city officials granted McDonald's the right to use the
Wangfujing site  &MD;  one of Beijing's choicest pieces of real estate  &MD; 
during the aftermath of the army's crackdown on Tiananmen
pro-democracy protests in 1989.
<p>
   Then, most foreigners were suspending or backing away from their
Beijing investments and when McDonald's said it wanted that corner,
the city was glad to oblige.
<p>
   ``We obtained the lease through the help of the municipal
government, which gave us a very good location,'' Chen said.
<p>
   Five years ago, competition for space was decidedly less
intense. Now, a construction boom has made all of central Beijing
prime property, and practically all of Wangfujing has been
committed to projects financed by Hong Kong developers.
<p>
   Among several Hong Kong financiers with strong ties to the
mainland, Li is one of the most influential.
<p>
   He is Hong Kong's richest man and appears to have good
connections with Chinese officials. The Beijing government has made
him one of its advisors on Hong Kong affairs.

After Indiana Crash, French Officials Issue Warning on Planes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  After a crash in Indiana that killed 68 people,
France on Wednesday urged air crews worldwide flying ATR-42 and 72
commuter planes not to fly on automatic pilot during ice build-up
or severe turbulence.
<p>
   France's General Direction of Civil Aviation announced in a
communique that its request ``was imperative while awaiting the
results of the investigation'' into the accident. The U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration issued a similar warning a week ago.
<p>
   The ATR-72 owned by American Eagle crashed into a soybean field
on its way to Chicago's O'Hare Airport while fighting gusts and
rain. Everyone on board died. Initial evidence suggests that ice
built up on the plane's wings, destabilizing it.
<p>
   The French authorities said that the automatic pilot should
immediately be turned off when ``lateral unbalance of the flight
controls are observed'' or during ``abnormal behavior.'' It can be
turned on again once the aircraft's steadies out manually.
<p>
   The 62 companies worldwide flying the aircraft were urged to put
the warnings, to be distributed by ATR in about two weeks, in their
flight manuals.
<p>
   There are 269 ATR-42s in service and 129 larger ATR-72s. Both
are light, twin-turboprops built by Avions de Transport Regional, a
consortium of French and Italian aircraft manufacturers.
<p>
   The aviation authorities meanwhile reported that investigation
into the near-crash of an Airbus A310 belonging to Romania's Tarom
airlines with 182 people aboard during a landing approach at Orly
airport in Paris has shown no evidence of mechanical failure.
<p>
   A preliminary report confirmed that the plane's pilot, who
reported that the plane had suddenly gained altitude as he came in,
then went into a dive, had been flying on manual as he claimed.
<p>
   The pilot had complained of technical problems, but the report
said that none had been discovered so far.
<p>
   The full investigation and analysis will continue many months.

U.S. Seeks to Stem Drug Flow From Asia
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP)  &MD;  Alarmed that narcotics from Asian
nations is turning more and more Americans into drug users, the
U.S. administration would like to nip the problem at the source, a
Clinton Administration official said Wednesday.
<p>
   Nearly 70 percent of the illegal drugs sold in the U.S. come
from Asian nations, particularly Southeast Asia, said Lee Brown,
director of the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control.
<p>
   Brown is trying to persuade Asian governments to tighten drug
enforcement, pass laws to prevent money laundering and to study how
the U.S. could help fight smuggling of narcotics.
<p>
   More than 14 million Americans use illegal drugs and the number
of addicts of heroin and cocaine is increasing, Brown told a news
conference during his 5-day visit to India.
<p>
   With American interest in Afghanistan declining after the end of
the Soviet-backed regime, drug smuggling has boomed in the region.
Much of the drugs pass through Pakistan and India, arch enemies
that refuse to discuss drug control measures because of political
problems.
<p>
   Brown, who met with officials in Pakistan before heading to New
Delhi, said he would like the extradition to the U.S. of eight
persons who have been indicted for causing drug trafficking to
North America. The suspects have not been arrested or tried in a
court of law.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a court in New Delhi sentenced an Afghan national on
Wednesday to 12 years in jail and fined him 200,000 rupees (dlrs
6,450) on charges of smuggling heroin into India.
<p>
   Kamaluddin, who uses only one name, was convicted on charges of
smuggling 260 kilograms (570 pounds) of heroin from Afghanistan,
judge S.P. Sabharwal said in his judgment, Press Trust of India
news agency reported.

Authorities Investigating Blackmail over Power Plant
By JAN DUNGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Authorities on Wednesday were checking
claims that a ``mafia'' group was trying to blackmail Swedish and
Lithuanian governments by threatening to blow up a nuclear power
plant.
<p>
   A Lithuanian man, Kestutis Mazuika, 52, was detained last week
after he walked into the Swedish prime minister's office and
threatened to blow up Lithuania's Ignalina plant unless he was paid
dlrs 8 million.
<p>
   While in custody, Mazuika insisted he was forced to convey the
threat on behalf of a criminal organization in Lithuania, Swedish
authorities said.
<p>
   ``We are still investigating his information,'' chief prosecutor
Jan Danielsson said Wednesday, according to the news agency TT.
<p>
   Mazuika was being held on suspicion of attempted blackmail,
although no charges have been filed, TT said.
<p>
   Danielsson says that Swedish security police, in cooperation
with Lithuanian collegues, have been scrutinizing Mazuikas
background and claims.
<p>
   ``He has a mixed background, but I would not say it is
criminal,'' Danielsson added.
<p>
   After his arrest, authorities in Lithuania received more
terrorist threats, so they shut down both nuclear reactors at
Ignalina to search for explosives at the facility, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) from Vilnius.
<p>
   No bombs have been found so far.
<p>
   Mazuika claimed that the criminal organisation has its people
among the 5,000 employees at the power plant and that they are
ready to carry out the sabotage.
<p>
   The Baltic News Service has reported that the threats were made
after a crime boss, Boris Dekanidze, was sentenced to death by a
local court.
<p>
   Dekanidze's group reportedly threatened to target Ignalina in
reprisal for the sentence. The man's father has denied his son had
anything to do with the threat.
<p>
   Mazuika was arrested as he walked into the prime minister's
office, which is open to the public under laws guaranteeing free
access to most government buildings.
<p>
   Authorities were ready to arrest the man because he already had
sent them letter announcing his intention to arrive for the money,
they said.

Warring Factions in Angola Sign Truce

<TEXT>
<p>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  &MD;  In a ray of hope for a bleeding country,
leaders of Angola's rival armies have promised to put down their
guns at 8 p.m. (1900 gmt) Wednesday after 19 years of civil war.
<p>
   In the hours leading up to the deadline, fighting continued
without pause around the northern city of Uige, the last provincial
capital still in rebel hands, according to army spokesmen in
Luanda, Angola's capital.
<p>
   And some commanders in the field contacted by The Associated
Press said they had not even heard about the truce. A nationwide
announcement was expected later in the day on government radio.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka after a
six-hour round of talks, is the first for Angola since May 15,
1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold. Throughout the
war that began on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975,
peace overtures and treaties have repeatedly failed to stop the
fighting.
<p>
   The truce is meant as the first step in disengaging the warring
sides: the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, led by
Jonas Savimbi
<p>
   The opposing delegations resumed meetings Wednesday in Lusaka to
nail down remaining details of a permanent accord, scheduled to be
signed Sunday by the two leaders in the presence of U.N. officials
and African heads of state.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is take effect Nov. 22, two days after
the signing.
<p>
   One key issue remaining is how many security guards and weapons
Savimbi will be allowed to retain under the cease-fire. According
to diplomatic sources, the UNITA leader is concerned about the
possibility of assassination.
<p>
   Another issue not fully resolved is how to incorporate UNITA
forces into a new unified defense force.
<p>
   But the fine print did not deter the chief U.N. mediator from
declaring an end to Angola's two decades of conflict.
<p>
   ``There should be no more hostilities in Angolan territory,''
said Alioune Blondin Beye, the U.N. special envoy to Angola who
mediated a year of peace talks in Lusaka.
<p>
   ``The Angolan people have suffered for 20 years,'' he said.
``There is going to be no more killing in Angola.''
<p>
   Although the government has been doing well on the battlefield,
it came under international pressure to agree to the truce Tuesday
to ensure that Savimbi would sign the peace pact Sunday.
<p>
   Political dynamics have changed in recent months with Savimbi's
rebels losing virtually all foreign support  &MD;  including that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime  &MD;  and
government victories on the battlefield.
<p>
   The war began as Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975. More than a half-million people have died and millions are
threatened by starvation and disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, aided by mercenaries who include
retired South African army officers, launched a counterattack last
fall.

Canadian Prime Minister Promotes Business with Vietnam

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  Canada and Vietnam signed agreements
Wednesday that allow Vietnam to double its textile exports to
Canada and pledge Canadian help in government and legal reforms.
<p>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien clinked wine glasses with
his Vietnamese counterpart, Vo Van Kiet, at a brief signing
ceremony in the main government building.
<p>
   ``I appreciate the fact that I am the first prime minister from
America to visit Vietnam, and I hope this will help your country in
getting better recognition in our continent,'' Chretien told Kiet
when they met before the signing.
<p>
   The two sides finished negotiating a comprehensive trade
agreement shortly before Chretien's arrival Wednesday but postponed
signing it until the text can be reviewed back in Ottowa, a senior
Canadian official said. Instead, the two countries' trade ministers
signed a memorandum of intent to eventually sign the trade pact.
<p>
   Under the pact, the two sides would exchange most-favored-nation
treatment, entitling each to the other's lowest tariff rates.
<p>
   The textile agreement allows Vietnam to export 2 million pieces
of finished clothing to Canada each year, up from the current 1
million. Canadian officials estimated this could mean an additional
5 million Canadian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.7 million) worth of sales
for Vietnam.
<p>
   Canada also pledged 36 million Canadian dollars (U.S. dlrs 26.7
million) worth of assistance over the next five years to develop
Vietnam's environmental management, information technology and
administrative and legal systems.
<p>
   The senior Canadian official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the aid was intended to help Vietnam's
bureaucracies plan better.
<p>
   The signings gave a festive atmosphere to the start of
Chretien's three-day visit, which will focus on promoting trade and
business. The prime minister, who arrived from a summit of Pacific
Rim countries in Indonesia, is accompanied by dozens of corporate
executives.
<p>
   Chretien is the first Canadian prime minister to visit Vietnam,
but Kiet called him an old friend and thanked him for Canada's
support toward restoring Vietnam's relations with international
financial institutions and the United States in recent years.
<p>
   At the signing ceremony, Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren
repeated his government's support for Vietnamese entry to the main
world and regional trade groups.
<p>
   In China last week, Chretien presided over the signing of more
than 8.6 billion Canadian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.3 billion) worth of
business deals.
<p>
   Expectations in Vietnam are much lower. Canadian companies plan
to sign about 50 million Canadian dollars (U.S. dlrs 37 million)
worth of contracts on Thursday.
<p>
   Canada opened a trade office in southern Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh
City on Tuesday, and Chretien will preside over the opening of a
new Canadian Embassy in Hanoi. Canada opened diplomatic relations
with Hanoi in 1973 but placed an ambassador here only this year.
<p>
   Vietnam exported 27 million Canadian dollars (dlrs 20 million)
worth of goods to Canada in 1993, while importing just 12 million
Canadian dollars (dlrs 8.9 million) in goods in return. Canadian
companies have invested a total of 132 million Canadian dollars
(dlrs 97.8 million) in Vietnam since 1988.

Communists Take Early Lead in Nepal Polls

<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A communist alliance Wednesday was racing
ahead of the centrist party which governed Nepal for more than
three years in a parliamentary election, according to early returns
Wednesday.
<p>
   Of the 11 results announced so far, eight have gone to the
left-wing parties. A pro-monarchy party won three seats.
<p>
   Trends from 78 constituencies showed that the communists were
leading in 35 and the centrist Nepali Congress in 15, said a top
official of the election commission. Smaller political groups were
leading in the other places.
<p>
   ``We are hopeful of a comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar,
secretary-general of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxist-Leninist), the largest of the four leftist parties.
<p>
   About 2,000 communist supporters shouting slogans against Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala marched through Katmandu's seats in
anticipation of a majority in the 205-seat Parliament.
<p>
   Koirala, who is contesting from two constituencies, was leading
in one and trailing behind a communist rival in the other.
<p>
   The communists' promise of land reforms and breaking up large
holdings has wide appeal in this poor mountainous country.
<p>
   Prime Minister Koirala's government was discredited because of
Nepal's poor economic performance.
<p>
   Sandwiched between the world's two most populous countries,
India and China, Nepal's 20 million people survive on agriculture.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
after a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Prime Minister Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months
ahead of schedule.

<p>
   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  &MD;  Just hours before an expected truce was to
take effect, fighting raged around the northern Angolan city of
Uige, the last provincial capital still in rebel hands. In a ray of
hope for a bleeding country, leaders of Angola's rival armies
promised to put down their guns at 1900 GMT Wednesday after 19
years of civil war. But some commanders in the field contacted by
The Associated Press said they had not even heard about the truce.
A nationwide announcement was expected later in the day on
government radio. The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in
Lusaka after a six-hour round of talks, is the first for Angola
since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  President Clinton pressed Indonesian
President Suharto for more progress on human rights Wednesday,
promising not to sacrifice principles for expanded trade with Asia.
A senior U.S. administration official said Suharto responded by
saying his government was dealing with the issue squarely. Wrapping
up a five-day Asian trip, Clinton told Suharto he would take him at
his word not to move against student independence protesters once
he and his entourage leave, aides said. Clinton made the direct
appeal as 29 East Timorese students continued a sit-in on the
grounds of the U.S. Embassy. The students are protesting Indonesian
occupation of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's embattled interior minister went before a
hostile parliament Wednesday and conceded that police have failed
to keep up with the explosive growth of organized crime in the past
year. Viktor Yerin, who has been criticized by every faction in
parliament, also admitted that more than 500 policemen had been
arrested on corruption charges so far this year. Yerin said the
overall number of crimes had dropped 4 percent compared with last
year, but that violent crimes had increased. ``Blatant crimes such
as terrorist acts, hostage taking and contract killings have become
more frequent,'' he said, adding that criminal groups are focusing
their efforts on the banking and financial spheres.
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Italy's Northern League on Wednesday assured its
support for the government in a confidence vote called by Premier
Silvio Berlusconi in an effort to push forward with his austerity
budget. But the League, often a reluctant partner in the
conservative governing coalition, also promised to promote
negotiations with labor unions, which have called a general strike
to protest proposed cutbacks in Italy's generous pension system.
League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's position
as debate began in the Chamber of Deputies, said the League
``recognized the need for the country to be governed.'' Berlusconi
would have to resign if he lost the vote.
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  One vote could seal the fate of Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds' government Wednesday, and it's all down
to one man. Dick Spring, deputy prime minister and leader of the
Labor Party, will decide for his party whether Reynolds' speech to
Parliament Tuesday did enough to heal the rift in the two-year-old
coalition. Parliament delayed a crucial no-confidence debate for an
hour Wednesday morning. Reynolds on Tuesday had promised a shakeup
of the attorney general's office following uproar over its failure
to deal with an extradition request for a priest accused of child
sexual abuse. But Reynolds continued to defend the promotion of
Attorney General Harry Whelehan to president of the High Court.

Police Arrest Man Accused of Raping 70 Girls in Two Years

<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  After a two-year manhunt, police have arrested a
man accused of raping 70 girls and robbing their homes, a dramatic
example of China's growing crime problem.
<p>
   Thousands of police in Beijing and the nearby city of Tianjin
worked on the case before arresting Ma Hongyan last week, the
Beijing Youth News reported Wednesday.
<p>
   Ma, 28 and unemployed, is suspected of following the girls  &MD; 
latchkey children  &MD;  home from school, talking his way into their
homes, raping them and then robbing the apartments.
<p>
   Unlike in the West, the cases received no publicity before Ma's
arrest. In China, crimes are generally not reported until an arrest
is made lest the public realize how many crimes go unsolved. In the
case of the serial rapist, authorities probably also feared
inciting widespread panic if the case were publicized.
<p>
   Even without Western-style reporting or detailed crime
statistics, it is clear that crime is becoming a serious problem.
City residents regularly trade stories about muggings, murders and
armed robberies. Many are now afraid to allow workers and repairmen
into their homes, and most have installed iron doors and window
grates.
<p>
   In recent weeks, the police presence in Beijing has increased
noticeably, with armed and helmeted officers at major intersections
stopping cars late at night.
<p>
   A Hong Kong newspaper reported that the strengthened security
was in response to a series of unsolved serious crimes since
mid-October.
<p>
   The first involved a fugitive who had killed a police
superintendent in northeast China. He evaded checkpoints all over
the city and police believe he is still in the capital, Hong Kong's
independent Ming Pao said last Friday.
<p>
   In another case in late October, several people intercepted a
car belonging to China's top prosecutor's office, killed the driver
and wounded several police who were escorting serious criminals.
The culprits seized the police firearms and fled. They also remain
at large.
<p>
   On Oct. 30, police were told that several murderers likely had
entered Beijing, but roadblocks at main intersections failed to
detect them.
<p>
   While nothing has appeared in China's government-controlled
media about any of those cases, the Beijing Youth News carried a
detailed account of the serial rapist case.
<p>
   Ma, a gambler, lived in Langfang, Hebei province, about halfway
between Beijing and the port city of Tianjin, it said. Whenever he
lost money gambling, he would go to one of the cities to rape and
steal, and he struck 60 times in Beijing, it added.
<p>
   Police confiscated 200,000 yuan (dlrs 23,529) worth of watches,
gold and silver jewelry, stereo systems, movie cameras, video
cassette recorders, cameras and foreign currency from him, the
paper said.
<p>
   The report quoted a grammar school administrator as saying,
``They should sentence him to death by a thousand slices and let
every victim ... take a hack.''

Earthquake Survivors Look at Grim Future

<p>
   CALAPAN, Philippines (AP) - Mercy Morales' family had been eking
out a simple existence in the central Philippines when Tuesday's
earthquake and tidal wave swept their fishing village. Now four of
their eight children are gone, along with all their material
possessions.
<p>
   ``Not a plate, not a ladle or cloth was left with us. Nothing
remained of our belongings,'' Mrs. Morales said at a government
shelter two kilometers (1.25 miles) from their former village of
Malaylay. ``We do not know where to go now.''
<p>
   Her husband, Celestino, said his small wooden canoe and their
thatch hut were ripped apart by the tidal wave that followed the
predawn quake.
<p>
   The 5-foot (1.5-meter)-high tidal wave also swept away 32 of the
34 bamboo huts in what used to be the Morales' neighborhood. A
jumble of bamboo splints, palm fronds and pieces of clothing were
among the debris of the former village of about 200 people.
<p>
   The bodies of the Morales' four dead children were recovered
several meters away from where their house had stood in Malaylay
village, just west of Calapan on Mindoro Island, about 120
kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
<p>
   The earthquake and the tidal wave killed 48 people on Mindoro
and four others in nearby Batangas province on the main Luzon
Island, disaster relief officials said. At least 135 people were
injured and 10 others were missing.
<p>
   In Mindoro neighborhoods aside from the Morales', the earthquake
and tidal wave destroyed 611 houses and damaged 2,345 others.
<p>
   President Fidel Ramos, who was in Indonesia for an Asian
economic summit meeting, cut his visit short by a day and planned
to return Thursday to visit the Mindoro victims, his office said.
<p>
   He would preside over a meeting of disaster relief officials in
Mindoro to determine how the ease the situation, it added.
<p>
   Danilo Aceveda, a Calapan councillor, said the local government
plans a mass burial Thursday for the local earthquake victims.
<p>
   ``The reason for the mass burial is not only to economize but to
also bring dead relatives together,'' Aceveda added.
<p>
   The local government is helping villagers by giving 10,000 pesos
(dlrs 416) for each family member killed and 5,000 pesos (dlrs 208)
for those injured.
<p>
   Alfonso Umali, the province's administrator, said panic buying,
especially of fuel, has been reported in several towns that were
cut off from the capital town of Calapan.
<p>
   Umali said the local government was studying the possibility of
relocating people whose homes were destroyed by the tidal wave.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, a search helicopter rescued a Japanese scientist
and three Filipino guides trapped on a mountain by landslides
unleashed by the earthquake.
<p>
   Yuji Murata, a 41-year-old Tokyo scientist studying orchids for
the Japanese government, and the three Filipinos were picked up
from a clearing on the 5,000-foot (1,515-meter) Mount Bugnay, near
Malaylay.
<p>
   More than 1,448 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Tuesday and
Wednesday, scientists reported.
<p>
   The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro and
destroyed many of its water mains.
<p>
   The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered six miles (10
kilometers) north of the island. A magnitude of 7 indicates a major
quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
<p>
   The Philippines, a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous
islands, sits on at least four major faults. An earthquake in 1990
killed nearly 2,000 people on Luzon Island.

On Tuesday, the index had gained 186 points.
<p>

risen 10.82 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,528.64 on Tuesday.
<p>
   Profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling pushed down prices
amid a lack of market-moving news, traders said.
<p>
   The dollar finished at 98.62 yen, up 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
Tokyo close but below its overnight New York finish of 98.76 yen.
It now has gained 1.39 yen in Tokyo over six trading days.

30-share Straits Times Industrials Index rose 5.32 points to

profit-taking following the rise in U.S. interest rates. The KLSE
Composite Index fell 6.59 points to 1,063.15.
<p>
   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower in thin trading because
of profit-taking. The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index fell 7.70
points to 1,489.15.

Two Vans Torched Before Athens Polytechnic Anniversary
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  Two vans belonging to Greek radio stations
were torched by self-proclaimed anarchists Wednesday, one day
before an annual protest march to the American embassy here. There
were no injuries.
<p>
   The vans were destroyed outside the Athens Polytechnic
University, which has been celebrating the anniversary of a bloody
1973 student uprising against the 1967-74 military junta.
<p>
   The anniversary is often marred by clashes between anarchists
and riot police. It is marked with a to embassy, which many here
think supported the junta.

Dutch Merchant Bank Buys Stake In U.S. Asset Management Group
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Dutch merchant bank MeesPierson
Wednesday announced it has acquired a 25 percent stake in 1838
Investment Advisors, a Philadelphia-based asset management group.
<p>
   The expansion is a strategic move to help MeesPierson target
U.S. institutional investors, who are increasingly looking for
foreign investment opportunities.
<p>
   MeesPierson, a subsidiary of the Netherlands' largest bank ABN
Amro Holding NV, declined to give financial details of the deal
which was closed last month.
<p>
   The remaining 75 percent stake in 1838 Investment Advisors will
remain with its management, a MeesPierson spokesman said.
<p>
   MeesPierson's 10 asset managers in Philadelphia will join 1838
Investment Advisors' 24-strong team of investment experts.
<p>
   The two companies have set up a joint venture which will market
their activities under the name MeesPierson 1838 Investment
Advisors.
<p>
   ``For MeesPierson this is a strategic step. We're a medium sized
player in international asset management and we want to grow in
that kind of business across the world,'' the spokesman said.
<p>
   The bank currently manages 10 billion dollars of assets in Asia,
Europe and the United States while 1838 Investment Advisors manages
some 4 billion dollars worth of assets.
<p>
   The spokesman declined to specify how much of that total is
currently held in the United States.
<p>
   The U.S. venture will enable 1838 Investment Advisors' clients
to invest in Europe and Asia via MeesPierson and MeesPierson's
European and Asian clients to invest in the U.S. via the 1838
Investment Advisors.

<p>
   Here is a summary of late financial news from The Associated
Press. Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the
items below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   HONG KONG (AP)  &MD;  Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Wednesday, but share prices rose in Hong Kong for the third
straight day. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key
indicator of blue chips, rose 26.58 points, or 0.2 percent, closing
at 9,592.24. Brokers said prices fell in the morning after
Tuesday's larger-than-expected 0.75 percentage point boost in
short-term interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board but
rebounded in late institutional buying. In Japan, share prices

225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 85.02 points, or 0.44 percent,
closing at 19,306.66. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section was down 3.14 points, or 0.21 percent,
to 1,525.50.
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  As he prepared to leave Asia,
President Clinton reached out to Republicans  &MD;  urging them to
support both his market-opening moves with Asia and, more
immediately, a new set of global trade-liberalization rules up for
a vote next month in Congress. Some Republicans have urged that the
vote on tariff-lowering General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) legislation be postponed until next year, when they will
gain control of both chambers. Clinton applauded contracts signed
this week between U.S. businesses and Asian concerns  &MD;  including
contracts signed Wednesday in Indonesia worth over dlrs 40 billion,
timed to coincide with the president's visit.
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  The French state has no immediate plans to fully
privatize the automaker Renault SA, officials said Wednesday,
though 1.1 million individuals subscribed for shares in a partial
sell-off. The French state is lowering its stake in Renault to just
over 50 percent from 79 percent. The public offering of some 37
million shares priced at 165 francs (dlrs 31) each is expected to
bring 8 billion francs (dlrs 1.4 billion) to the government.
Individual investors will receive up to 40 shares for every 60
requested. The nationalized automaker is the latest to fall under
conservative Premier Edouard Balladur's program to sell 23 large,
state-owned firms.
<p>
   SHENZHEN, China (AP)  &MD;  An Australian businessman whose case has
dramatized the perils of trading in China went on trial on
corruption charges Wednesday, after more than a year in detention.
James Peng's case has illustrated the vagaries of China's legal
system. Australian officials, meanwhile, have been accused of not
doing enough to help Chinese-born Peng because he is an immigrant.
Peng, 35, was seized last October by police in the Portuguese
colony of Macao and spirited to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese
boomtown. A court statement said Peng was accused of embezzling 1.1
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 143,000) from a loan granted
by a state bank in 1989 to Champaign Industrial Co. Ltd., a highly
successful company that Peng had established.
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  The golden arches on the corner of Beijing's
busiest shopping street  &MD;  now one of the city's modern landmarks  &MD; 
could face the wrecking ball if an influential Hong Kong developer
gets his way. The McDonald's on the corner of Beijing's Wangfujing
Street and the Avenue of Eternal Peace, just two blocks from
Tiananmen Square, now sits amid the rubble of buildings already
torn down to make way for a huge real estate project. McDonald's
says it has not been approached by the developers of the planned
commercial complex. But it also says it has no intention of
vacating the site of its biggest restaurant in the world.

Australian Businessman on Trial in High-Profile Case

<p>
   SHENZHEN, China (AP)  &MD;  An Australian businessman whose case has
dramatized the perils of trading in China went on trial on
corruption charges Wednesday, after more than a year in detention.
<p>
   James Peng's case has illustrated the vagaries of China's legal
system. Australian officials, meanwhile, have been accused of not
doing enough to help Chinese-born Peng because he is an immigrant.
<p>
   Peng, 35, was seized last October by police in the Portuguese
colony of Macao and spirited to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese
boomtown that is a cradle of China's economic reforms.
<p>
   He has been detained ever since. Such long detentions are
illegal, but not unusual in China.
<p>
   Peng, in handcuffs and wearing a jacket and trousers, was led by
police into a noisy courtroom at the Intermediate People's Court in
Shenzhen.
<p>
   Bystanders crowded outside to glimpse the proceedings, attended
by about 100 people.
<p>
   A court statement said Peng was accused of embezzling 1.1
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 143,000) from a loan granted
by a state bank in 1989 to Champaign Industrial Co. Ltd., a highly
successful company that Peng established.
<p>
   Prosecutors said Peng used some of the money to buy watches and
pay his sister's study fees in Australia.
<p>
   Peng faces a second charge of using 290,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs
33,700) from Champaign in 1992 to repay gambling debts, a judge
said.
<p>
   Four of the five presiding judges took turns reading out
evidence against Peng, who sat reading documents and taking notes.
<p>
   Asked to comment, Peng denied most of the evidence or said he
wasn't clear about the details. He said documents produced in court
did not carry his signature and argued that the charges were based
only on evidence given by his former business associates.
<p>
   ``I don't understand why they say these things,'' he said. He
looked healthy and sounded calm.
<p>
   Peng's lawyers said evidence gathered by prosecutors was invalid
and argued that Peng should never have been charged. They protested
the length of his detention and said authorities should by law
apply to China's parliament if they want to keep Peng in detention.
<p>
   The court's head judge concluded the day's proceedings by
declaring that a verdict would be given at a date to be announced.
<p>
   The Australian government pressured successfully for Peng to be
allowed to choose his lawyers and for an open trial. Australian
officials from nearby Canton and from Beijing attended the trial.
<p>
   Chinese authorities took the extremely unusual step of allowing
a handful of reporters, including one from The Associated Press, to
attend.
<p>
   Photographers and TV crews were barred. But a uniformed court
official took snaps of Peng and offered them for 100 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 13) each.
<p>
   Peng's mother also attended, but his wife did not for fear she
too could be detained if she came to China.
<p>
   Lina Peng believes her husband was detained because Chinese
officials envied his success. Peng built a reputation by buying
money-losing state-owned textile factories and establishing
Champaign, the first foreign joint venture to be listed on
Shenzhen's stock exchange.

Bhutto Says Fighting In Parliament Will Be Banned
By GREG MYRE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
responding to free-for-all brawl in Parliament this week, said
Wednesday she would introduce a law banning any member who slaps,
punches or kicks a political opponent.
<p>
   In Pakistan's rough-and-tumble political climate, almost
anything goes. But even cynical observers were a bit shocked Monday
when members of the National Assembly began pushing, shoving and
throwing punches during the state-of-the-nation address by
President Farooq Leghari.
<p>
   ``We cannot allow a group of violent thugs to beat up members,
thrown them out and paralyze the functioning of the Parliament,''
Ms. Bhutto said. ``We are examining the present law to take
action.''
<p>
   Ms. Bhutto accused the conservative Pakistan Muslim League, the
main opposition group, of instigating the brawl. But members of her
governing Pakistan People's Party were also seen throwing punches.
<p>
   ``If there is violence, we should fight against it with the
power of law,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
<p>
   Ms. Bhutto also lashed out at PML leader Nawaz Sharif, the
former prime minister. She said the Sharif family had resorted to
fraud and corruption to build its business empire, one of the
largest in Pakistan.
<p>
   Sharif and his followers have been trying to bring down Ms.
Bhutto's coalition government with a series of protests.
<p>
   They were particularly upset Sunday when Ms. Bhutto's government
arrested Sharif's 75-year-old father, Mohammed Sharif, on charges
of tax evasion. The elder Sharif has since been hospitalized with
heart trouble, but he remains in custody.

Mahathir Accuses U.N. of Torturing Iraqis
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
known for his outspoken ways, accused the United Nations Wednesday
of torturing Iraqis by maintaining an economic embargo against
Baghdad.
<p>
   He said the West may feel that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
is oppressing his people. But the United Nations also is
``oppressing, forcing and torturing'' the Iraqis just because the
West has been unable to bring down the Iraqi Government, he added.
<p>
   ``To torture the Iraqis until they bring down Saddam is to be
most unfair because probably the Iraqis are too afraid of Saddam
that they dare not take any action,'' he told reporters.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council decided to renew sanctions
against Iraq even though Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
handed over a document on Iraq's official recognition of Kuwait to
the United States' ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright.
<p>
   The recognition of Kuwait was a key condition for the lifting of
the embargo imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded and briefly occupied
Kuwait.
<p>
   ``Why must Iraqis suffer and be tortured? To me this
(maintaining sanctions) is the same as killing the Iraqis,''
Mahathir said.

New Multibillion-Dollar Price Tag to Close Nuclear Plant
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Ukranian officials say it will now cost up
to $12 billion to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of
the world's worst nuclear accident.
<p>
   The spiraling cost, quoted Tuesday by the new foreign minister,
is three times higher than previous estimates. The minister,
Hennadi Udovenko, offered no explanation and did not elaborate.
<p>
   A fire and subsequent explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in 1986 destroyed one of its four reactors, spewing a cloud
of radioactive particles over several European nations.
<p>
   Environmental groups claim several thousand people have died
from fallout from the blast.
<p>
   The United States and the European Union, concerned by recurring
accidents and reports of growing fissures in the concrete
sarcophagus feeding the destroyed reactor, have repeatedly urged
Ukraine to close the plant.
<p>
   ``The European Union demands we close down the plant as soon as
possible, but this would cost between $10 billion and 12 billion,''
Udovenko told reporters.
<p>
   Asked about potential European Union aid to Ukraine, Udovenko
responded: ``This would be the best investment.''
<p>
   Cash-strapped Ukraine needs the electricity generated by the two
still-functioning reactors, which produce about 7 percent of the
nation's energy.

Maveric General: Parliament Should Control Military
By NATASHA ALOVA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's most outspoken general criticized the
country's military and political leaders for allowing the armed
forces to decay and said parliament should have a greater say in
military issues.
<p>
   ``All problems of the armed forces (cannot be decided) by the
president alone,'' Gen. Alexander Lebed said in an article
published Wednesday in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
<p>
   ``We have an army  &MD;  but is it an army?'' Lebed asked. ``If
things are left as they are, ... this vastly huge organism will
decompose.''
<p>
   Lebed, who has said he'd like to be defense minister someday,
published his remarks two days before Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev is scheduled to appear before the parliament's defense
committee.
<p>
   Grachev, long-rumored to be on his way out, has been blamed by
his troops for defense budget cuts and has been accused of failing
to stamp out high-level corruption. He also is unpopular among
hard-liners for having supported President Boris Yeltsin during
last year's political violence.
<p>
   Yeltsin has consistently backed Grachev, but he criticized
military leaders on Monday for the troops' inadequate training and
discipline.
<p>
   In his article, Lebed complained that Russia's army is inferior
to the rival armed forces of NATO, China and the Islamic world.
Russian military leaders have hidden the true state of the army's
woes from the government, the parliament and the public, he wrote.
<p>
   The hasty withdrawal from Germany and the Baltic states left the
army in disarray and its officers demoralized, Lebed said. Troops
have been relocated to unsuitable locations; units that need modern
aircraft have been left with obsolete ground vehicles.
<p>
   According to Lebed, decision-making is hampered by ``personal
relations'' and lack of public control.
<p>
   Political leaders have failed to define Russia's national
interests for the military, while army leaders have failed to
reshape the armed forces, he said.
<p>
   Lebed suggested that parliament take greater control over the
armed forces, overseeing both budget and policy. While doing so,
lawmakers can gain experience that would allow one of them to
eventually become Russia's first civilian defense minister.
<p>
   The general's comments touched a sensitive nerve: Yeltsin has
frequently battled with lawmakers over control of the armed forces.
A stalemate was reached with last year's adoption of the new
constitution, which names the president as Russia's
commander-in-chief, while giving parliament control over the
defense budget and the appointment of defense minister.
<p>
   Despite Lebed's popularity among his fellow soldiers, lawmakers
seem in no hurry to make him defense minister.
<p>
   That would be ``unrealistic and inexpedient,'' said Alexander
Piskunov, the parliament's Defense Committee deputy head.
<p>
   ``A defense minister's position requires profound military,
political and economic background. A cavalry attack is
unsuitable,'' he said.

Minister Claims Fundamentalists Killed Inmates; Paper Closed

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP)  &MD;  Islamic fundamentalist prisoners
reportedly cut the throats of eight common criminals during a
failed prison breakout crushed by security forces.
<p>
   Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia, in an interview published
Wednesday with the daily newspaper El Moudjahid, reported the
deaths but gave no total figure of other prisoners killed or
injured.
<p>
   Security forces reported Tuesday ``a few injured and a few
dead'' among the prisoners, along with three guards hurt. Informed
sources said at least 30 inmates were killed.
<p>
   The attempted breakout at the Berrouaghia prison, 120 kms (75
miles) south of the capital, erupted Sunday when 20 inmates using
knives, forks and other sharpened objects attacked guards.
<p>
   Teguia blamed Islamic fundamentalists inmates, who make up 800
of the 3,000-strong prison population. During the 40 hours of talks
between riot leaders and authorities, Teguia claimed,
fundamentalist prisoners terrorized ordinary criminals.
<p>
   Security forces put down the rebellion Monday, Teguia told the
newspaper, organ of Algeria's former ruling Marxist party. He
provided no other details.
<p>
   Thousands of militants have been jailed since the
military-backed government canceled January 1992 elections the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was winning.
<p>
   More than 11,000 people have died in the resulting insurgency.
The government launched an unprecedented offensive this month after
negotiations with jailed Salvation Front leaders broke down.
<p>
   The French newspaper Liberation cited the Salvation Front's
exiled leadership as estimating that more than 1,000 people were
killed Nov. 1-9, mostly ``innocent civilians savagely massacred.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, Algeria's largest newspaper, the independent
Arab-language El Habar, was shut down Wednesday by the security
forces, according to editor-in-chief Omar Ourtilane.
<p>
   Ourtilane said that he was not informed of the motives for the
shutdown, the fourth against an Algerian paper in eight days.
<p>
   The government has vowed to strictly apply laws to stop the
press from giving Islamic terrorists a ``publicity podium.''

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  &MD;  McDonnell-Douglas Corp., a leading
aerospace and defense company, will move its regional headquarters
from Singapore to Malaysia by the end of this year, its chairman
said Wednesday.
<p>
   McDonnell, a company that ``builds almost anything that flies,''
was attracted by the business-friendly environment and government

<p>
   The Kuala Lumpur head office, manned by a handful of top
professionals, would be the ``brains'' for the company in this
region, he said.
<p>
   Phil Edsall, Mcdonnell-Douglas' vice president of sales in the
Asia-Pacific, will head the office.
<p>
   McDonnell-Douglas, which makes F/A-18 jet fighters, has sold
eight of them to the Malaysian air force for dlrs 500 million. They
are expected to be delivered in February 1997.

<p>
   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Two German magazines must print on
their covers a retraction of a false cover story about Princess
Caroline of Monaco, Germany's highest appeals court has ruled.
<p>
   The Federal Court of Justice on Tuesday confirmed a lower
court's ruling that requires the Burda Verlag publishing house to
make prominent retractions of cover stories on the princess that
appeared in the Burda magazines Bunte and Gluecks-Revue.
<p>
   The appeals court ordered the lower court to reconsider the
damages of 30,000 marks (dlrs 19,500) awarded to Caroline and raise
the sum to correspond to the increased circulation won by the false
cover stories.
<p>
   The monetary damages should serve as a counterbalance to prevent
violations of privacy for commercial gain, the court said.
<p>
   While the retraction must appear on the magazines' covers, it
need not take up the entire cover, so that the publications may
still indicate what is in the issues, the court ruled.
<p>
   Burda said in a statement issued in Munich it regretted the
verdict.

Japan Takes Charge of Changing APEC
Eds: One name only for Suharto
By KENNETH L. WHITING
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Japan's image as a fence-sitter in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum may change now that it has
taken over as chairman of the group.
<p>
   When he arrived home from APEC's summit in Indonesia on
Wedesday, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was quoted as saying
that his country would strive to play an organizing role in the
18-member forum.
<p>
   Tokyo replaced Jakarta as chairman for a one-year term at the
end of APEC's annual meeting, and the next summit is scheduled for
Osaka.
<p>
   Japan takes over at a major turning point in the short history
of APEC. Founded five years ago as a loose consultative forum, it
decided on Tuesday to aim for free and open trade in the Pacific
basin by the year 2020. Japan and other developed members are
supposed to lift trade barriers by 2010.
<p>
   The date was about the only concrete announcement before the
one-day summit adjourned. The leaders didn't even bother to define
what they mean by ``free and open'' trade.
<p>
   Cabinet ministers and other underlings were told to build a
working model of the vision ``soon.''
<p>
   Tokyo takes the chair when adroit leadership is needed to
achieve consensus in such a populous and diverse region.
<p>
   Before he left Jakarta, Murayama told a news conference that
Japan would ``take a positive approach in the creation of an action
agenda.''
<p>
   That would be a big change for Tokyo in APEC, where it seemed
forever timid lest someone be offended. In the past, it never
exhibited the leadership expected of the world's second-largest
economy.
<p>
   China was another fence-sitter, tending to go along with the
consensus on most issues, but Beijing started to play a more active
role at Jakarta.
<p>
   Japan and China occupied the middle ground among APEC members
and  &MD;  in the past  &MD;  carried little weight in deliberations because
of their passivity.
<p>
   The more cautious states, mostly developing lands in Southeast
Asia, form another cluster. They can see the value in consulting
and coordinating with others, but become uneasy when the pace
quickens, fearing they might be disadvantaged by more advanced
members.
<p>
   A third camp is occupied by the activists, including Australia,
the United States, Singapore and Indonesia. They provide the ideas
and favor pushing ahead with regional cooperation.
<p>
   Australia initiated APEC and suggested a summit, an idea that
was picked up by President Clinton last year at Seattle. The
meeting of presidents and prime ministers now looks like a fixture.
<p>
   ``At our next meeting in Osaka, I hope we will be able to agree
on a comprehensive action plan for achieving the free trade goal,''
said Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating.
<p>
   Indonesia was a late convert to activist ranks, but President
Suharto can take much credit for the timetable approach and the
2020 target.
<p>
   APEC includes three of the world's largest economies: the United
States Japan and China. Trade among the 18 accounts for two-thirds
of their total trade, a higher degree of regional interdependence
than among the members of the European Union despite much closer
physical proximity and three decades of integration efforts in
Europe.
<p>
   APEC does not discuss security, but its promise to build the
world's largest area for free trade and investment carries
significant political implications.

   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance is surging ahead of
the centrist party that has governed Nepal for the past three
years, according to early returns Wednesday from parliamentary
election.
<p>
   Of the 11 seats for which results have been announced in
Tuesday's vote, eight have gone to left-wing parties. A
pro-monarchy party won three seats.
<p>
   Trends from 78 constituencies showed the Communists leading in
35 and the centrist Nepali Congress in 15, said a top official of
the election commission. Smaller political groups were leading in
the other districts.
<p>
   ``We are hopeful of a comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar,
secretary-general of the Communist Party of Nepal, the largest of
the four leftist parties.
<p>
   The Communists' promise to institute land reforms and break up
large holdings has wide appeal in this mountainous agricultural
country sandwiched between India and China.
<p>
   The government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was
discredited because of Nepal's weak economy.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority of the 205 parliamentary
seats in 1991 elections, the first vote in 31 years after King
Birendra relinquished absolute power following a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers brought down
Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months ahead of
schedule.

<p>
   CALAPAN, Philippines (AP) - Mercy Morales' family had been eking
out a simple existence in the central Philippines when Tuesday's
earthquake and tidal wave swept their fishing village. Now four of
their eight children are gone, along with all their material
possessions.
<p>
   ``Not a plate, not a ladle or cloth was left with us. Nothing
remained of our belongings,'' Mrs. Morales said at a government
shelter two kilometers (1.25 miles) from their former village of
Malaylay. ``We do not know where to go now.''
<p>
   Her husband, Celestino, said his small wooden canoe and their
thatch hut were ripped apart by the tidal wave that followed the
predawn quake.
<p>
   The 5-foot (1.5-meter)-high tidal wave also swept away 32 of the
34 bamboo huts in what used to be the Morales' neighborhood. A
jumble of bamboo splints, palm fronds and pieces of clothing were
among the debris of the former village of about 200 people.
<p>
   The bodies of the Morales' four children were recovered 100
meters (yards) away from where their house had stood in Malaylay
village, just west of Calapan on Mindoro Island, about 120
kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
<p>
   The earthquake and the tidal wave killed 63 people on Mindoro
and four others in nearby Batangas province on the main Luzon
Island, disaster relief officials said. At least 135 people were
injured and 10 others were missing.
<p>
   In Mindoro neighborhoods aside from the Morales', the earthquake
and tidal wave destroyed 611 houses and damaged 2,345 others.
<p>
   President Fidel Ramos, who was in Indonesia for an Asian
economic summit meeting, cut his visit short by a day and planned
to return Thursday to visit the Mindoro victims, his office said.
<p>
   He would preside over a meeting of disaster relief officials in
Mindoro to determine how the ease the situation, it added.
<p>
   Danilo Aceveda, a Calapan councillor, said the local government
plans a mass burial Thursday for the local earthquake victims.
<p>
   ``The reason for the mass burial is not only to economize but to
also bring dead relatives together,'' Aceveda added.
<p>
   The local government is helping villagers by giving 10,000 pesos
(dlrs 416) for each family member killed and 5,000 pesos (dlrs 208)
for those injured.
<p>
   Alfonso Umali, the province's administrator, said panic buying,
especially of fuel, has been reported in several towns that were
cut off from the capital town of Calapan.
<p>
   Umali said the local government was studying the possibility of
relocating people whose homes were destroyed by the tidal wave.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, a search helicopter rescued a Japanese scientist
and three Filipino guides trapped on a mountain by landslides
unleashed by the earthquake.
<p>
   Yuji Murata, a 41-year-old Tokyo scientist studying orchids for
the Japanese government, and the three Filipinos were picked up
from a clearing on the 5,000-foot (1,515-meter) Mount Bugnay, near
Malaylay.
<p>
   More than 1,448 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Tuesday and
Wednesday, scientists reported.
<p>
   The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro and
destroyed many of its water mains.
<p>
   The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered six miles (10
kilometers) north of the island. A magnitude of 7 indicates a major
quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
<p>
   The Philippines, a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous
islands, sits on at least four major faults. An earthquake in 1990
killed nearly 2,000 people on Luzon Island.

Embattled Interior Minister Addresses Hostile Parliament

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's embattled interior minister went before a
hostile parliament Wednesday and conceded that police have failed
to keep up with the explosive growth of organized crime in the past
year.
<p>
   Viktor Yerin, who has been criticized by every faction in
parliament, also admitted that more than 500 policemen had been
arrested on corruption charges so far this year.
<p>
   ``I recognize that we haven't yet taken all the neccessary steps
to fight organized crime, corruption and drug trafficking,'' Yerin
told members of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
<p>
   ``The crime situation in Russia remains tense,'' he said, in a
report that outlined his ministry's crime-fighting successes and
failures.
<p>
   Yerin said the overall number of crimes had dropped 4 percent
compared with last year, but that violent crimes had increased.
<p>
   ``Blatant crimes such as terrorist acts, hostage taking and
contract killings have become more frequent,'' he said, adding that
criminal groups are concentrating on the banking and financial
spheres.
<p>
   Last year, there were 650 bomb explosions in which 116 people
were killed, according to Interior Ministry statistics cited by the
ITAR-Tass news agency. In Moscow alone, there are 40 bomb blasts
each month, and half of all contract killings in Russia occur in
the capital.
<p>
   During a Duma debate on Yerin's address, ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky caused an uproar with a harsh attack on
police.
<p>
   ``All officers of the Interior troops are drunk in the morning,
they take bribes in the morning and get drunk at night,''
Zhirinovsky said. ``Instead of opening criminal cases they open
bottles.''
<p>
   In response, Yerin and his aides walked out of the session,
along with members of the largest reformist faction in parliament.
<p>
   Zhirinovsky has often accused law enforcement authorities of
harassing and spying on his party.
<p>
   In his address, Yerin complained that police have been forced to
make cutbacks because of budget problems. Nearly 25 percent of the
money promised by the government this year was never paid.
<p>
   ``As a result, this year we had to cut the purchases of cars,
weapons and protection means,'' he said.
<p>
   Despite the problems, there have been some gains, Yerin said.
<p>
   Police this year arrested 25 percent more leaders and members of
criminal groups, and eliminated 255 gangs altogether, he said. They
also seized 9,000 weapons and 4,800 kilograms (10,500 pounds) of
explosives.
<p>
   Yerin discussed progress in two murder investigations closely
followed by Russian lawmakers: the cases of Duma deputies killed
earlier this year.
<p>
   Andrei Aidzerdzis, a businessman turned lawmaker, was shot in
April outside his home in a slaying fellow deputies blamed on
organized crime. Valentin Martemyanov, a Communist Party deputy,
died Nov. 5, five days after being beaten and robbed near his home.
<p>
   ``We have identified the man who killed deputy Aidzerdzis and we
are searching for him,'' Yerin said. ``We have detained a group of
suspects in connection with Martemyanov's killing and we have
evidence of their implication in this crime.''
<p>
   Some lawmakers criticized Yerin's ministry for protecting the
wealthy at the expense of ordinary Russians.
<p>
   ``There will be no real fight against crime unless the Interior
Ministry's best forces stop guarding banks and private businesses
instead of performing their direct duties,'' said Isa Kostoyev,
chairman of the parliament committee on legal affairs.

Russia Blasts Baltic Demand for Demilitarized Kaliningrad
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia said Wednesday that a Baltic demand for the
withdrawal of its troops from Kaliningrad is ``outright
interference'' in Russia's internal affairs.
<p>
   The Baltic Assembly, made up of parliamentary representatives
from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, adopted a resolution Sunday
urging demilitarization of Kaliningrad, a Russian-run territory
bordering Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast.
<p>
   In an angry statement Wednesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry
criticized ``those who masterminded this irresponsible idea,'' and
condemned the ``anti-Russian sentiment of Baltic parliament
members.''
<p>
   ``Kaliningrad is, was, and will be part of the Russian
Federation. Any further encroachments upon Russia's sovereignty
will be met by a serious rebuff,'' said the statement, carried by
Russian news agencies.
<p>
   The Russian military presence in Kaliningrad has emerged as a
security concern for the three Baltic nations, which broke from the
Soviet Union in 1991. The last Russian soldiers withdrew from the
three former republics earlier this year after nearly 50 years of
military occupation.
<p>
   Kaliningrad was the capital of East Prussia until the Soviet
Union took it during World War II. The Baltic resolution also
called for restoration of Kaliningrad's German name, Konigsberg.
<p>
   Baltic sources have estimated the number of Russian troops in
Kaliningrad at between 100,000 and 500,000, while Western estimates
are about 200,000. The Russian government has not given an exact
number.
<p>
   The Baltic Assembly called for an international conference on
Kaliningrad.
<p>
   ``This is a potential security problem not only for the Baltic
states but for all countries in the region,'' John Eichmanis, chief
policy adviser to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, told The
Associated Press.
<p>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry responded that the Baltic
countries' efforts to turn Kaliningrad into an international issue
shows they have ``lost all sense of reality.''
<p>
   Russia and Lithuania have also been quarreling over Russian
access to Kaliningrad. Russia and Kaliningrad do not share a common
border, but Lithuanian nationalists oppose allowing Russians to get
to Kaliningrad through their country, saying that would make
Lithuania a de facto ally of Russia.

Government Troops Bogging Down in Logistical Problems

<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said Tuesday
that government forces appeared to be bogging down in logistical
problems as they sought to stretch Bosnian Serb lines before winter
sets in.
<p>
   Combat continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia, where
Serbs have retaken territory captured by government troops in
recent weeks, and other hots spots of northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   But front lines appeared to have changed little.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said government
attacks that began late last month may have run their course for
the time being.
<p>
   Such ambitious plans that are not well coordinated may face a
shortage of ammunition and other supplies, he said. ``What we are
seeing now is a general slowing of military activity,'' he said.
<p>
   ``It may resurge, it may not,'' Spicer said.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   They captured hundreds of square kilometers of territory in
northwest Bosnia, and in a coordinated attack with Croat allies,
took the Serb-held town of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government troops still are trying to make gains in those
areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as ``tense
and unstable,'' but there appeared to be little change in the
frontline.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
totally surrounded throughout the 2 1/2-year-old war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Bosnia radio reiterated charges Tuesday that Serbs in Croatia
also were attacking government forces in Bihac.
<p>
   But it said the new government lines were ``steady and
unbreakable.''
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to
Bosnia, to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Prime Minister Promises Fresh Disclosures Which May Save
Government
EDS: UPDATES with Reynolds statement to house; session to resume
after 1600 GMT

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  Fighting for the life of his government
on a confidence vote, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds on Wednesday
hinted at new disclosures on ``a very serious matter.''
<p>
   ``I will have that information, but I haven't got it to lead off
this debate,'' said Reynolds. Parliament then adjourned until later
in the afternoon.
<p>
   News reports suggested that the government may have some new
disclosures regarding the appointment of the former attorney
general, Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. That is
the issue which has fractured the coalition between Reynolds'
Fianna Fail party and the Labor Party led by Deputy Prime Minister
Dick Spring.
<p>
   Opposition leaders were furious at rumors that the two parties
were nearing a deal to keep the government in office.
<p>
   ``It seems to me we are dealing with one of the most sleazy
events in Irish political history,'' said Proinsias de Rossa,
leader of the small Democratic Left party.
<p>
   John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party,
said he was in position to lead off the debate because ``it is
clear that the (prime minister) is going to make quite a bizarre
speech.''
<p>
   Reynolds said the new information would be in response to a
query from the Fine Gael party's chief whip, Enda Kenny. Kenny
asked Reynolds how he could have assured the House on Tuesday that
there had been no outside pressure in handling the case of Rev.
Brendan Smyth, a Catholic priest wanted for child sexual abuse in
Northern Ireland.
<p>
   The government had appeared doomed on Tuesday after Labor
lawmakers said they had not been satisfied with Reynolds
explanation of why the attorney general's office had taken no
action on the request for seven months.
<p>
   Reynolds promised a shakeup of the attorney general's office but
he said Whelehan was not personally guilty of any wrongdoing. Labor
walked out of the Cabinet on Friday when Reynolds forced the
appointment through, and Whelehan was sworn in on Tuesday.
<p>
   Reynolds had feared he could lose a vote of no confidence in his
government Wednesday.
<p>
   It was not clear how the vote would be affected by his latest
statement to the Dail.
<p>
   The prime minister has staked his defense in part on the budding
peace process in Northern Ireland, following the Irish Republican
Army cease-fire 10 weeks ago. He praised Spring for his
contribution as foreign minister.
<p>
   Reynolds told the Dail Tuesday: ``It will be a great pity if a
government that is achieving rapid economic progress, that has
achieved the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in over 25
years, and that has a fine legislative program, should be placed in
jeopardy over misunderstandings surrounding a single judicial
appointment.''
<p>
   Sinn Fein, the party allied to the IRA, has urged Spring and
Reynolds to resolve their differences. But Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel (cq) McLaughlin said Tuesday the party was prepared to work
with any party in government.
<p>
   ``The peace process is in no danger from a change of
government,'' said Mary Harney, leader of the small Progressive
Democratic party. She said all parties were committed to promoting
peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
<p>
   Reynolds said Tuesday he regretted any offense caused by
Whelehan's appointment but said it was ``inadvertent.'
<p>
   Bruton said he believed Reynolds deliberately snubbed Labor.

October Bankruptcies Set Year's High for Debts
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Japanese corporations that went bankrupt in October
left the largest debts of any month so far this year, suggesting
that Japan's economy is still sluggish, a private credit research
organization said Wednesday.
<p>
   The number of bankruptcies by companies with liabilities of more
than 10 million yen (dlrs 100,000) each was 1,226 in October, down
2.5 percent from a year earlier, but this year's second largest
number, said Teikoku Data Bank Ltd.
<p>
   The companies that went bankrupt in October left 845.01 billion
yen (dlrs 8.45 billion) in liabilities, up 101.9 percent from
October last year and the seventh-largest monthly figure ever,
Teikoku Data Bank said.
<p>
   It attributed the large increase in October to the bankruptcy of
Nippon Mortgage Co. with liabilities of 518.5 billion yen (dlrs
5.19 billion).
<p>
   The Economic Planning Agency said on Sept. 9 that figures on
such things as consumer spending and industrial production
indicated that Japan's economy was out of the doldrums that began
in 1991.
<p>
   But Teikoku Data Bank said that because of the yen's strength
against the U.S. dollar, small and medium-size companies remain
cautious.
<p>
   The stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and less
competitive abroad, while reducing exporters' foreign earnings when
their dollars are turned into yen.
<p>
   The dollar, which started the year trading at 113 yen, closed
Wednesday at 98.62 yen.
<p>
   Teikoku Data Bank said 11,524 bankruptcies were reported in this
year's first 10 months, and the number will reach about 14,000 by
the end of this year, compared with 14,041 for all of 1993.

BC &MD; Britain-Parliament Opens
Queen Unveils Plan to Increase Britain's EU Commitment
By SUE LEEMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister John Major, trailing badly in
public opinion polls, appeared to stake his job Wednesday on
increasing Britain's funding for the European Union.
<p>
   Rebellious lawmakers in his governing Conservative Party, who
oppose closer British integration with Europe, said they will fight
Major's plan to increase Britain's payments to Brussels by 250
million pounds (dlrs 400 million) a year by 2000.
<p>
   Queen Elizabeth II outlined Major's proposal to beef up support
for the EU to bring Britain in line with an agreement reached in
December 1992 to increase Brussels' levy on member states.
<p>
   British monarchs, long stripped of political power,
traditionally open Parliament sessions by reading a speech written
by the prime minister. The queen, in an ermine-trimmed robe and
diamond crown, peered through glasses to read the short speech.
<p>
   Rebel Conservatives say they cannot approve any increase while
the EU is losing millions through fraud and waste. The EU Court of
Auditors revealed Tuesday that losses from misuse of funds top the
equivalent of 740 million dollars.
<p>
   As a reassurance to the rebels, the queen promised Wednesday
that ``my government ... will promote budgetary discipline in the
(European) Union and combat fraud.''
<p>
   The 13 bills outlined in this year's address contained few
surprises.
<p>
   The opposition Labor Party said the lackluster legislative
program is evidence the government has run out of steam.
<p>
   Major was forced earlier this month to abandon the Tories' most
dramatic initiative, a plan to privatize the Royal Mail, after
dissident Tory lawmakers threatened to humiliate the prime minister
by voting down the measure in Parliament.
<p>
   Trailing Labor by more than 30 points in opinion polls and with
a majority of just 13 in the 361-seat House of Commons, the
government has little leeway for maneuver.
<p>
   Senior Tory lawmaker Sir Marcus Fox warned rebels Wednesday that
a vote against the European Community Finance Bill could
destabilize Major's government.
<p>
   His comments were seen as an indication that Major views the
issue as a test of support for his leadership.
<p>
   But rebel Conservative lawmaker Teresa Gorman said Wednesday
legislators ``are not poodles.''
<p>
   ``I can't believe that anyone in Parliament thinks it is in the
interests of their voters to give more money to an organization
which we are told by its own auditors is thoroughly corrupt,'' she
told BBC radio.
<p>
   Britain gave 1.7 billion pounds (dlrs 2.72 billion) to the EU in
1993-94.
<p>
   The government's legislative package also includes tightening
the management of pension schemes after millions of pounds
(dollars) were looted from the pension funds of companies belonging
to the late publisher Robert Maxwell.
<p>
   There also is legislation to establish a common retirement age
for men and women at 65. Women currently retire at 60.
<p>
   The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill provides for construction of a
67-mile (107-km) high speed railway linking London to the Channel
Tunnel at Folkstone.
<p>
   Regular passenger rail services through the tunnel began this
week between London and Paris and Brussels. In France, the trains
already run on high-speed tracks.
<p>
   Other draft bills would streamline payment of welfare benefits
to the jobless and increase the rights of the disabled.

Ending Boycott of Israel is a Matter of Time, Says Minister
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KUWAIT (AP)  &MD;  Kuwait's information minister says an end to the
Arab boycott of Israel is in the offing.
<p>
   ``I want to make it clear that lifting the boycott of Israel has
become a matter of time after the bilateral recognitions between
Israel and the Arab parties in the struggle,'' Sheik Saud al-Sabah
told the pro-government paper Al-Anba.
<p>
   The Arab League boycott, in force since Israel was created in
1948, prohibits trade with Israel and firms that do business with
the Jewish state.
<p>
   Kuwait and five other Gulf states have stopped blacklisting
foreign firms that do business with Israel. But they have said they
will continue to prohibit direct dealings with Israel until it
makes peace with Syria and Lebanon.
<p>
   Sheik Saud's remarks, published Wednesday, indicated that Kuwait
did not plan to wait indefinitely before taking other steps to help
end Israel's political and commercial isolation in the Middle East.
<p>
   The United States and some of its Western allies have pushed the
Arabs to abandon the embargo to help push forward the peace
process.

   PUERTO DEL ROSARIO, Canary Islands (AP)  &MD;  At least seven Spanish
soldiers died on Wednesday when their helicopter crashed in the
Canary Islands after flying into high voltage power lines.
<p>
   It was not immediately known how many people were aboard the
helicopter when it went down near Puerto del Rosario on
Fuerteventura island, off northwest Africa. A spokesman for the
island's provincial government said the death toll could rise.
<p>
   There was no information available on the identity or rank of
those killed nor on the type of helicopter, which was based on the
island of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

New Soccer League to Announce Plans
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Organizers of a planned U.S. professional soccer
league were expected to announce Wednesday that play will begin in
April 1996, a year later than originally hoped.
<p>
   The New York Times and USA Today reported Wednesday that Major
League Soccer officials would formally announce the 1996 start and
introduce charter investors and team operators. The newspapers said
the investors would include Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and
Metromedia chairman John Kluge.
<p>
   The league, which awarded seven franchises in June, was expected
to also announce additional teams from among Chicago; Denver;
Indianapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Tampa, Florida; and Seattle.
The sites previously announced are Northern New Jersey; Long
Island, New York; Washington; Los Angeles; Boston; San Jose,
California; and Columbus, Ohio.
<p>
   USA Today said Long Island is no longer being considered for the
first season, but will be added when a suitable stadium is
constructed.
<p>
   An announcement also was expected on plans for teams
representing the league to play exhibition games in 1995.

Party That Triggered Japanese Upheaval to Dissolve Itself
AP Photo TOK101
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The party that triggered Japan's first change of
government in 38 years a month after it was formed last year
formally decided Wednesday to dissolve itself and merge into a
united opposition party.
<p>
   The decision by the Japan Renewal Party was the latest step in a
politcal realignment that many analysts believe will fuse Japan's
many parties into two major blocs, both of generally conservative
views.
<p>
   The Renewal Party was formed in June 1993 by defectors from the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party. It scored major successes in
elections the next month by denouncing LDP corruption and promising
economic reforms.
<p>
   In August 1993, a coalition led by the Renewal Party ousted the
LDP for the first time since 1955. But after passing modest
political reforms, the coalition bogged down in internal disputes.
<p>
   It split in April and fell in June to a coalition uniting the
LDP and a former Renewal Party ally, the Socialists.
<p>
   The Renewal Party and its allies in the opposition have agreed
to unite as one party Dec. 10 to oppose the LDP, and one by one the
opposition parties have been announcing their dissolution and
intent to join the united party.
<p>
   A meeting Wednesday of national Renewal Party delegates approved
the party's dissolution. Party leader Tsutomu Hata, who was prime
minister from April to June, told the delegates he will work ``like
a mad dog to restore this country's vitality and change its
political system.''
<p>
   Opposition leaders accuse the LDP of foot-dragging on reforms to
streamline government and open Japan's markets wider. They say a
two-party system is good because it will offer Japanese voters a
clear choice between two policies.
<p>
   Critics of the two-party alignment say the parties won't differ
much on policy so candidates will try to buy votes with pork-barrel
projects and personal favors, much as in past elections.
<p>
   One of the recent reforms sought to solve that problem by
replacing multimember legislative districts with single-member
districts. In the large districts, members of the same party ended
up running against each other, so that policy was not an issue.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said Tuesday
that government forces appeared to be bogging down in logistical
problems as they sought to stretch Bosnian Serb lines before winter
sets in.
<p>
   Combat continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia, where
Serbs have retaken territory captured by government troops in
recent weeks, and other hots spots of northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   But front lines appeared to have changed little.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said government
attacks that began late last month may have run their course for
the time being.
<p>
   Such ambitious plans that are not well coordinated may face a
shortage of ammunition and other supplies, he said. ``What we are
seeing now is a general slowing of military activity,'' he said.
<p>
   ``It may resurge, it may not,'' Spicer said.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   They captured hundreds of square kilometers of territory in
northwest Bosnia, and in a coordinated attack with Croat allies,
took the Serb-held town of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government troops still are trying to make gains in those
areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as ``tense
and unstable,'' but there appeared to be little change in the
frontline.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
totally surrounded throughout the 2 1/2-year-old war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Bosnia radio reiterated charges Tuesday that Serbs in Croatia
also were attacking government forces in Bihac.
<p>
   But it said the new government lines were ``steady and
unbreakable.''
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to
Bosnia, to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Gordon Spawns Deadly, Destructive Tornadoes in Florida

scene.

<p>
   BAREFOOT BAY, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A tornado spawned by Tropical Storm
Gordon ripped through this retirement community, killing at least
one person and turning hundreds of mobile homes into hulks of
mangled aluminum and asbestos.
<p>
   The deaths of two more people in Florida, including that of a
16-year-old surfer, were blamed on the tropical storm that left at
least 100 dead when it smashed through the Caribbean.
<p>
   In Barefoot Bay, an Atlantic Coast town of 7,000 people about
145 miles (235 kms) north of Miami, metal hung from trees like huge
strips of tinsel and debris was strewn everywhere.
<p>
   The twister bounced across a two-mile (three-kilometer) stretch
just after 7 p.m. Tuesday, destroying as many as 100 mobile homes
and damaging 500 more. Forty people were injured; authorities did
not know the identity of the person killed.
<p>
   ``Frames of houses, siding, sheds, washers, dryers, a boat
overturned, fiberglass insulation, anything that's in a house was
all over the lawns and the streets,'' freelance photographer Jeff
Cross told Florida Today.
<p>
   Police and rescuers went door-to-door Tuesday night, using
flashlights to search for more victims in the dark, rainy weather.
``It's pure hell out there,'' said sheriff's Officer Dallas Durr.
<p>
   About 150 people took refuge at two shelters.
<p>
   The National Hurricane Center also reported tornadoes about 100
miles (170 kms) south in Lake Worth, Delray Beach and near Jupiter
Inlet. No serious injuries were reported. Downed power lines cut
off electricity to about 2,000 people in Lake Worth.
<p>
   Gordon also whipped up winds that grounded a 506-foot
(152-meter) freighter just yards (meters) from shore in Port
Everglades early Tuesday, and caused a traffic accident that killed
a pregnant woman Monday. Other storm-related deaths Tuesday include
a 16-year-old surfer who drowned in Bal Harbour and a man who died
in a multi-vehicle accident in Fort Pierce.
<p>
   The storm was nearly stationary in the Gulf of Mexico early
Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph). The
center was about 115 miles (185 kms) south of Sarasota.
<p>
   The deadliest tropical storm of the season hit Florida after
wreaking havoc in the Caribbean. At least 100 people were confirmed
killed in Haiti, and the independent Radio Signal FM reported the
death toll was at least 400. The president of the Red Cross in
Haiti, Dr. William Fougere, refused to give a figure. Two people
died in Jamaica and two in Cuba.
<p>
   More than 8 1/2 inches (21.6 cms) of rain fell in Homestead,
which supplies half of the nation's winter vegetables. Winds
scarred eggplant, squash and peppers.
<p>
   About 26,000 south Florida customers remained without power late
Tuesday, according to Florida Power and Light. About 367,000 had
been blacked out.
<p>
   Among the flotsam thrown up on Florida's beaches were five
packages of cocaine. Bricks of about two pounds (one kg) each were
found in the St. Augustine area in north Florida.

Government Troops Bogging Down Before Winter Sets In

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said Tuesday

U.N. Urges Western Sahara Referendum
Eds: RESTORES percentage figure in 7th graf.
By DONALD W. SWINTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  For years, the people of the Western
Sahara have been promised the chance to choose between independence
and union with Morocco. The U.N. Security Council has made a fresh
appeal to both sides in the dispute to get on with it.
<p>
   After three years of planning and little to show for it, the
council on Tuesday urged Morocco and independence-seekers to allow
``no further undue delays'' for a proposed U.N.-organized
referendum.
<p>
   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is to visit the area
this month to try to coax the two sides into some progress.
<p>
   At stake is the future of the phosphate-rich Atlantic coastal
territory south of Morocco, formerly known as the Spanish Sahara.
Spain ruled the territory until February 1976. Two months later,
Morocco occupied two-thirds of the 288,000-square kilometer
(115,000-square mile) land.
<p>
   Guerrillas of the Marxist Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi
Arab Democratic Republic and began a guerrilla war for
independence. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1991.
<p>
   The referendum has been bogged down by disputes over who should
be allowed to vote. The stalemate has favored Morocco, which has
largely defeated the guerrillas. Originally scheduled for 1992, the
vote now is set for February.
<p>
   A 323-member U.N. mission, including peacekeepers, has
registered less than 3 percent of possible voters at a cost of
about dlrs 40 million annually, according to U.N. officials and
documents.
<p>
   Polisario wants voter eligibility to be based on the 1974
Spanish census, which estimated the population at about 74,000
people. Morocco insists on a count of the estimated 140,000 people
now in the territory.
<p>
   ``Morocco is trying to introduce as many Moroccan citizens as
possible'' to steal the election, Polisario spokesman Radhi Salek
said Tuesday.
<p>
   Salek said the United Nations had received 233,000 voting
applications  &MD;  suspiciously greater than originally anticipated.
U.N. officials have approved only 5,575 of those voters.
<p>
   Morocco's U.N. ambassador, Ahmed Snoussi, attributed the delay
in part to the fact that there are only two registration centers. A
lack of roads makes it difficult to reach and register people, many
of whom are nomads, he said.

Vatican Confirms Major Asian Pilgrimage by Pope
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VATICAN CITY (AP)  &MD;  The Vatican confirmed Wednesday that Pope
John Paul II will make an 11-day trip to Asia in January, an
announcement intended to show the pope is physically prepared to
resume grueling foreign travel.
<p>
   The trip to the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Australia and Sri
Lanka will be the pope's first foreign tour since he canceled last
month's visit to the United States.
<p>
   The Vatican said the trip was scrubbed because of a slow
recovery from hip replacement surgery April 29 and denied
persistent rumors that John Paul was seriously ill.
<p>
   John Paul, during a trip to Sicily 12 days ago, said he planned
to travel to Manila, where he will mark the Church's World Youth
Day. He didn't mention the other stops on the trip.
<p>
   The Vatican said he will fly to Manila Jan. 11.
<p>
   He will go onto Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Jan. 16, Sydney,
Australia, Jan. 18, and Colombo, Sri Lanka, Jan. 20, conducting
beatification ceremonies in each country.
<p>
   The 74-year-old pope has been beset by medical problems the past
two years and has looked frail in recent months. He now walks with
a cane.
<p>
   The Asian tour will be John Paul's first abroad since a weekend
stop in Zagreb, Croatia, Sept. 10-11, a few days before he canceled
the U.S. trip.

Georgia Crushes Wales 5-0 in European Championship
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP)  &MD;  Georgia romped to a 5-0 crushing of
Wales in a European Championship qualifying game Wednesday, handing
the Welsh their most humiliating defeat ever.
<p>
   Georgia gained its first goals and points in the competition and
piled more misery on a Welsh team that also lost to Moldova last
month.
<p>
   Temoliz Ketsbaia netted twice and more goals came from Georgi
Kinkladze, Gocha Gogrichiani and Shota Arveladze as the Georgians
played some sparkling soccer to over-run the Welsh.
<p>
   Although Wales could not call opon Manchester United winger Ryan
Giggs, who missed the game through injury, its strikeforce had
another United star, Mark Hughes, as well as Liverpool's Ian Rush
and Dean Saunders of Aston Villa, some of Europe's most feared
strikers.
<p>
   But it was the Welsh defense that was repeatedly torn apart by
Georgia's swift forwards. After surviving a half hour of pressure
from the home team, Wales conceded two goals in nine minutes before
half time.
<p>
   Ketsbaia fired the first in the 30th minute and Kinkladze slid
home the second in the 39th.
<p>
   Ketsbaia hit the third soon after the halftime break with a
curling shot past veteran Welsh goalkeeper Neville Southall and
Gogrichiani hit the fourth into an empty net soon after hitting the
post.
<p>
   Arveladze scored the fifth goal in the 66th minute as the Welsh
fell to their worst defeat since losing 6-1 to a strong French team
in 1953.
<p>
   The result means that both teams have three points from three
games but now Georgia is above Wales in the standings because of a
better goals differential.

Church, Government Sources: Aristide To Resign His Priesthood
By MICHAEL NORTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
whose championship of the poor alienated the Roman Catholic church
hierarchy, will resign his priesthood, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vatican, which has long been at odds with the populist
preacher, pressured Aristide to resign, a church source said. A
government official, who also requested anonymity, confirmed that
Aristide would leave the priesthood.
<p>
   Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years of exile following a
September 1991 military coup. Thousands of U.S. soldiers came to
the Caribbean nation to help restore his elected government.
<p>
   The church official said Aristide will send a letter of
resignation to the Vatican, but he did not say when. Aristide
decided it would be better for Haiti if he resigned because the
Vatican is so influential, the official said.
<p>
   The president was in a closed meeting with Haitian business
leaders in the national palace Wednesday morning and not
immediately available for comment.
<p>
   Aristide gained prominence years ago as a pulpit orator,
criticizing the former Duvalier family dictatorship and subsequent
military-backed governments. In 1988, he was expelled from the
Salesian order, which said he fomented class hatred.
<p>
   Aristide has appeared more moderate since returning to Haiti,
repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   Although Aristide draws support with his mystique as a priest,
some of his backers said Wednesday they were not concerned.
<p>
   ``Aristide is a statesman. The most important dimension of the
man today is not the religious, it is the political,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, a leader of the grass-roots Lavalas political
organization, which is loyal to Aristide.
<p>
   ``One less role to play,'' said Jean Frederick, 41, a resident
of the capital who is unemployed. ``In any case, the people will
always call him `Father Aristide.'''

Students Demonstrate Again Against Turkish Occupation

<TEXT>
<p>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  &MD;  Greek Cypriot students clashed with
policemen and U.N. soldiers who blocked their attempt Wednesday to
cross into a Turkish-occupied enclave to protest the abduction of
five of their peers the day before.
<p>
   Waving Greek and Cypriot flags, demonstrators thronged to the
180-kilometer-long (122-mile) Green Line that splits the island
into Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sectors.
<p>
   The largest gathering was in Nicosia. Rejecting police orders to
stop, thousands of students pushed through barbed wire barricades
into a buffer zone patrolled by United Nations troops.
<p>
   They overpowered the peacekeepers, overran their observation
post and smashed its windows. Then they replaced the U.N. flag with
a Greek one.
<p>
   Scuffles ensued as Cypriot policemen and the peacekeepers teamed
up to push the demonstrators back. The students finally dispersed
two hours later after the international peacekeepers fired tear gas
at them.
<p>
   On Tuesday, demonstrators protesting the 11th anniversary of the
proclamation of a breakaway state in northern Cyprus clashed with
Turkish troops on the Green Line.
<p>
   Twelve Greek Cypriots, 10 Turkish Cypriots and two U.N.
peacekeepers were injured in the stone-throwing exchanges. Five
students were arrested after advancing to the Turkish lines.
<p>
   U.N. troops were trying to obtain their release Wednesday, when
the new demonstrations turned violent.
<p>
   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkey invaded
and seized the northern third of the island in July 1974 in the
wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
<p>
   The Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their independence Nov. 15,
1983, but only Turkey has recognized their state.

<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  The decomposed bodies of two Arab men were
found in a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem
on Wednesday, and police suspected they were drug addicts.
<p>
   Police spokesman Avi Zelba said the two bodies were found in an
abandoned building in the Shuafat refugee camp.
<p>
   ``They are two young Arab men and have been dead for some while.
In all probability they died from an overdose,'' Zelba said.

New Multibillion-Dollar Price Tag to Close Nuclear Plant

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Ukranian officials say it will now cost up
to $12 billion to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of
the world's worst nuclear accident.
<p>
   The spiraling cost, quoted Tuesday by the new foreign minister,
is three times higher than previous estimates. The minister,
Hennadi Udovenko, offered no explanation and did not elaborate.
<p>
   A fire and subsequent explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in 1986 destroyed one of its four reactors, spewing a cloud
of radioactive particles over several European nations.
<p>
   Environmental groups claim several thousand people have died
from fallout from the blast.
<p>
   The United States and the European Union, concerned by recurring
accidents and reports of growing fissures in the concrete
sarcophagus encasing the destroyed reactor, have repeatedly urged
Ukraine to close the plant.
<p>
   ``The European Union demands we close down the plant as soon as
possible, but this would cost between $10 billion and 12 billion,''
Udovenko told reporters.
<p>
   Asked about potential European Union aid to Ukraine, Udovenko
responded: ``This would be the best investment.''
<p>
   Cash-strapped Ukraine needs the electricity generated by the two
still-functioning reactors, which produce about 7 percent of the
nation's energy.

Armenia Announces Tough Economic Reform Plan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP)  &MD;  Armenia announced an ambitious
market-reform plan Wednesday aimed at reining in inflation,
slashing the deficit and freeing prices.
<p>
   The country, one of the poorest of the former Soviet republics,
is hoping to meet requirements for international loans. Central
Bank head Bagrat Asatrian told a news conference the plan will
create conditions ``for implementing a program here resembling the
Marshall Plan in post-World War II Europe.''
<p>
   Armenia's average monthly salary is only about dlrs 5.30, and it
has suffered from an economic blockade imposed by Azerbaijan as
part of a six-year war over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Armenia's only source of energy is a natural-gas pipeline from
Georgia that has been repeatedly bombed.
<p>
   The reform plan aims to cut inflation from the current 8 percent
to 9 percent a month to 1 percent by the end of next year, Asatrian
said.
<p>
   Prices would be deregulated starting next month, he said, and
the government hopes to ease the impact by doubling wages and
increasing aid to the poor. Bread prices are expected to rise 11
times, he said, from 6 drams (about 0.6 cents) to 66 drams (6.3
cents) a kilogram (or about 2 pounds).
<p>
   The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and some Western
countries have promised loans, Asatrian said, and he hoped that at
a meeting in Paris this week they will discuss giving dlrs 250-300
million in credits to Armenia over the next year.
<p>
   To ease the energy crunch, Armenia has also announced plans to
build an oil refinery and is negotiating to get oil from Russia. It
also plans to reopen a nuclear power plant shut down after the
December 1987 earthquake.

Amnesty Concerned About Increased Executions In Syria
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  &MD;  Amnesty International expressed concern
Wednesday about an apparent increase in executions in Syria and a
lack of fair trials in death-penalty cases.
<p>
   The group, in a news release, also reiterated its longstanding
concern about the cases of thousands of political prisoners in
Syrian prisons, some of them jailed more than 20 years.
<p>
   The statement came after the first visit to Syria by a
delegation from the Nobel Prize-winning group for talks about human
rights with high-level officials. Amnesty staff who visited the
country in the past usually met with lower-level dignitaries.
<p>
   At least 14 people were reported executed in 1993, said
Amnesty's Kamal Samari. Of these, nine were convicted of rape or
murder and five were executed for setting fire to a prison in March
1993, killing 57 inmates.
<p>
   There were two executions in 1992. So far in 1994, two
executions have been reported, Amnesty said. Some executions go
unreported or are not known until later.
<p>
   In the prison-arson case, ``We think the speed with which the
five were tried and executed may have undermined the international
safeguards required in the these cases,'' Samari told The
Associated Press.
<p>
   State news media said at the time that the five were hanged
after being convicted on charges of torching the prison in a vain
effort to cover up a drug-distribution ring they ran inside the
facility, which houses common criminals.
<p>
   Executions in Syria are usually carried out by hanging.
<p>
   Syria also has introduced a new law extending the death penalty
to first-time drug offenders, Amnesty pointed out in its news
release, which coincided with the 24th anniversary Wednesday of
President Hafez Assad's rise to power.
<p>
   ``Amnesty International is greatly concerned about the new law,
the apparent increase in the number of executions in 1993, and the
lack of fair trial in capital cases,'' the organization said.
<p>
   During its trip to Syria last month, the Amnesty delegation held
the ``first-ever substantive talks with Syrian authorities covering
all its human rights concerns'' and called for ``ending violations
in the country.''
<p>
   Amnesty described as ``positive'' Assad's release of thousands
of political prisoners since 1991, but said there had been little
progress made in reviewing the cases of others, some of whom have
been jailed for more than two decades.
<p>
   Amnesty said during its visit, the delegation raised the cases
of more than 1,000 people, including prisoners detained without
trial, those held even after expiration of their sentence, torture
allegations and cases of people who simply ``disappeared.''
<p>
   The number of political prisoners in Syria runs in the
thousands, Amnesty says, conceding that an exact figure is
impossible to obtain under current circumstances.
<p>
   Some of the longest-standing political prisoners in Syria are
top politicians who were jailed after Assad's bloodless coup in
1970. He has gradually been ordering their release, often for
health reasons.

Betselem Calls On Government To Ban Mistreatment Of Detainees
By GWEN ACKERMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  An Israeli human rights organization demanded
Wednesday that the government ban mistreatment of Palestinians
under interrogation and warned that the abuse would breed more
violence.
<p>
   The Betselem group said in a report that despite the Israel-PLO
peace accord, Israel's Shin Bet security service systematically
abused Palestinian detainees to extract confessions.
<p>
   Betselem also protested reported plans by the government to ease
restrictions on Shin Bet interrogators to help block bombing and
suicide attacks by Muslim militants. Since October, 24 Israeli
civilians and five soldiers were killed in such violence.
<p>
   ``The government is actually asking to get a legal umbrella ...
this is unusually dangerous because it opens a crack that will
widen and no one can say where it will stop,'' Betselem director
Yizhar Beer told a news conference Wednesday.
<p>
   Under existing rules, Shin Bet interrogators are already allowed
``moderate use of force,'' though the list of permissible method
was never made public.
<p>
   Citing testimonies from nine former Palestinian detainees and
protocols from four court hearings, Betselem outlined the abuse at
the hands of the Shin Bet.
<p>
   Interrogators prevent detainees from washing, deprive them of
food, drink and sleep; shout insults and abuse, beat them, tie them
to low chairs and keep them in small closet-like cells, Betselem
said.
<p>
   Betselem said such abuse also took place in army lockups in the
West Bank, though the bulk of interrogations is carried out by the
Shin Bet.
<p>
   An army spokesman said in a statement that ``there is a total
ban on use of violence, threats of violence, degradation, or
brutality against the person being questioned.''
<p>
   The secret Shin Bet has no spokesman, and reports directly to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was in the United States on
Wednesday. His two spokesman traveled with him, and could also not
be reached for comment.
<p>
   Fawzi Mujahed, a 21-year-old Arab journalist from east
Jerusalem, told the news conference that he was held by the Shin
Bet and the army twice since August.
<p>
   ``They put a sack on my head, and took me somewhere, I don't
know exactly where. They put me on a chair 30 centimeters high and
tied me to the chair with handcuffs. The chair was connected to the
floor so it wouldn't move,'' said Mujahed.
<p>
   The interrogators left Mujahed cuffed to the chair for seven
days, then beat his shoulders ``until they were blue.'' They then
forced him to sit on his knees in an arched position, with wrists
and ankles tied to together, he said.
<p>
   Mujahed finally confessed to writing anti-Israeli slogans about
five years ago and now faces trial.
<p>
   The ``ticking bomb'' theory -- that information needs to be
elicited quickly to prevent a bloody attack-- is often cited as a
defense for the use of force.
<p>
   Beer said in a few cases this did apply, but that ``in the
decisive majority we are far from such a reality.''
<p>
   Six of the Palestinians who detailed abuse at the hands of the
Shin Bet in the Betselem report were later released without being
charged.
<p>
   Yuval Ginbar, author of the report, said Shin Bet violence could
also spur terror attacks, rather than prevent them.
<p>
   He said two Palestinians questioned by security agents and
released without charges carried out bloody attacks this year.
<p>
   Riyad Zakarneh died in April while exploding a car bomb at a bus
stop in the northern Israeli town of Afula, killing eight Israelis.
Abdul-Munim Abu Hmeid was responsible for the February drive-by
killing of his Shin Bet recruiter.
<p>
   ``Innocent people arrested for long weeks and tortured harshly
go out with a lot of bitterness and anger,'' said Ginbar. ``When
you torture people the benefit is not unequivocal.''
<p>
   ``We, ourselves, are turning into terrorists. A decision to
allow more torture by the Shin Bet is another step on the dangerous
path that surrenders to terrorism,'' said Ginbar.

Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  In a major boost for worldwide nuclear arms
reduction, Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved the
long-stalled nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The vote, which carried 301-8 with 20 abstentions, follows
months of intense diplomatic lobbying by the international
community, and the United States in particular.
<p>
   ``Obstacles halting accession to the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty have been removed,'' Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told
legislators, outlining a package of security guarantees and
increased financial aid obtained from the United States, Britain,
Russia and France.
<p>
   Ukraine, the world's third-largest nuclear power, inherited an
arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and about 1,800 nuclear warheads
when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   Both President Leonid Kuchma and the United States were pushing
for the treaty to be accepted by legislators before his state visit
to Washington next week.
<p>
   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic
of 52 million million to attain nuclear-free status by about the
turn of the century.
<p>
   Ukraine's formal signing of the treaty will take place in early
December at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma said.

Verdy Captures Second-Stage Championship with One Game Left
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Nobuhiro Takeda scored twice as Verdy Kawasaki beat
the Urawa Red Diamonds 2-1 Wednesday and clinched the Japanese
Professional Soccer League's second-stage championship with one
game left.
<p>
   Its closest pursuer, Bellmare Hiratsuka, lost 3-1 to the Kashima
Antlers and fell two games behind.
<p>
   It was Verdy's 17th victory against four defeats, while Bellmare
has a 15-6 record, making their season-ending game on Saturday a
formality.
<p>
   Verdy, J-League's inaugural season champion in 1993, will play
1994 first-stage champion Sanfrecce Hiroshima in a home and away
series Nov. 26 and 30 to decide this season's overall champion.
<p>
   More than 52,000 spectators at Tokyo's National Stadium saw
Takeda fire a cross from the left side of the goal in the 30th
minute. He scored again 12 minutes later with a volley from just
outside the goal area.
<p>
   Before 15,457 spectators at Kashima, northeast of Tokyo,
Tadatoshi Masuda scored the first of the Antlers' three first-half
goals in the 6th minute.
<p>
   After a scoreless tie in the 90-minute regulation time and two
15-minute extra periods, Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat Jubilo Iwata 7-6
in a penalty shootout at Hiroshima. After its first-stage triumph,
Sanfrecce has slipped to a 12-9 record so far in the second stage.
<p>
   Argentine player Bisconti scored one goal in each period,
powering the Yokohama Marinos to a 2-0 triumph over the Yokohama
Flugels before 13,102 spectators.
<p>

goal in the 19th minute of the second half as the Shimizu S-Pulse
beat Gamba Osaka 1-0 before 17,090 spectators at Kusanagi,
southwest of Tokyo, for its third straight victory.
<p>

second-half substitute Shoji Jo gave JEF United Ichihara a 2-0
victory over the Nagoya Grampus Eight before 14,106 at Ichihara,
southeast of Tokyo.

Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  In a major boost for worldwide nuclear arms
reduction, Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved the
long-stalled nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The vote, which carried 301-8 with 20 abstentions, follows
months of intense diplomatic lobbying by the international
community, and the United States in particular.
<p>
   ``Obstacles halting accession to the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty have been removed,'' Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told
legislators, outlining a package of security guarantees and
increased financial aid obtained from the United States, Britain,
Russia and France.
<p>
   Ukraine, the world's third-largest nuclear power, inherited an
arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and about 1,800 nuclear warheads
when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   Both President Leonid Kuchma and the United States were pushing
for the treaty to be accepted by legislators before his state visit
to Washington next week.
<p>
   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic
of 52 million million to attain nuclear-free status by about the
turn of the century.
<p>
   Ukraine's formal signing of the treaty will take place in early
December at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma said.

   LEEDS, England (AP)  &MD;  Inspirational fullback Jonathan Davies
will miss Sunday's decisive third rugby league Test against
Australia because of the shoulder injury he sustained a month ago
in Britain's 8-4 victory at Wembley.
<p>
   Former Welsh rugby union star Davies scored Britain's try in the
game at Wembley but suffered the shoulder injury in a tackle
shortly after.
<p>
   He missed the second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which the
Australians won convincingly 38-8, and his absence Sunday is a big
blow to Britain's chances of winning the Ashes for the first time
in 24 years.

Church, Government Sources: Aristide To Resign His Priesthood
By MICHAEL NORTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
whose championship of the poor alienated the Roman Catholic church
hierarchy, will resign his priesthood, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vatican, which has long been at odds with the populist
leader, pressured Aristide to resign, a church source said. A
government official, who also requested anonymity, confirmed that
Aristide would leave the priesthood.
<p>
   Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years of exile following a
September 1991 military coup. Thousands of U.S. soldiers came to
the Caribbean nation to help restore his elected government.
<p>
   The church official said Aristide will send a letter of
resignation to the Vatican, but he did not say when. Aristide
decided it would be better for Haiti if he resigned because the
Vatican is so influential, the official said.
<p>
   The president was in a closed meeting with Haitian business
leaders in the national palace Wednesday morning and not
immediately available for comment.
<p>
   Aristide gained prominence years ago as a pulpit orator,
criticizing the former Duvalier family dictatorship and subsequent
military-backed governments. In 1988, he was expelled from the
Salesian order, which said he fomented class hatred.
<p>
   Aristide has appeared more moderate since returning to Haiti,
repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   Although Aristide draws support with his mystique as a priest,
some of his backers said Wednesday they were not concerned.
<p>
   ``Aristide is a statesman. The most important dimension of the
man today is not the religious, it is the political,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, a leader of the grass-roots Lavalas political
organization, which is loyal to Aristide.
<p>
   ``One less role to play,'' said Jean Frederick, a resident of
the capital who is unemployed. ``In any case, the people will
always call him `Father Aristide.'''

U.N. Agency Sees Link Between AIDS and Economic Hardship
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  A U.N. document says the AIDS epidemic has become so
serious in Africa and other developing regions that it is
threatening to hurt agricultural production and lead to food
shortages.
<p>
   The report presented this week to a meeting of the Rome-based
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization underlined that the spread
of AIDS can cause labor shortages and place enormous economic
burdens on poor societies.
<p>
   Among the countries most at risk of an AIDS-induced economic
slowdown are those in sub-Saharan Africa.
<p>
   Other areas affected include some countries in Latin America,
the Caribbean and Asia, especially Thailand, the report said.
<p>
   ``It is clear that sub-Saharan Africa may be the global
epicenter of death from AIDS, both from the disease itself and from
its effects on livelihoods,'' said the document.
<p>
   AIDS is primarily transmitted by sexual contact, the report
noted, adding:
<p>
   ''The sexually active sector of society is also the most
economically productive -- roughly 15 to 45 years of age.''
<p>
   According to the World Health Organization, approximately 14 to
15 million people have been infected with the AIDS virus worldwide
and the figure will rise to 40 or 50 million in the next five
years. Ninety percent of these cases will be in developing
countries.
<p>
   The report said that in Uganda agriculture currently accounts
for 90 percent of all employment, and ``it is estimated that half
of the population over 15 years of age is HIV-positive.''
<p>
   The report predicts that health care costs for AIDS patients
will skyrocket, possibly jeopardizing a nation's ability to deal
with other pressing health problems and forcing it to divert
resources from productive investments in other sectors.
<p>
   ``In several African cities, more than 50 percent of hospital
beds are now occupied by AIDS patients,'' it said.

BC-Egypt-Mubarak Interview
Mubarak Sees `New Afghanistan' Without Aid to Palestinians
Photo CAI-101
By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  President Hosni Mubarak predicted Wednesday
that Gaza and the West Bank could turn into ``a new, tougher
Afghanistan'' unless international aid quickly reaches the
autonomous Palestinian territories.
<p>
   In an interview with The Associated Press and Associated Press
Television, Mubarak also said the violence would spread to Europe
if the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ``don't start
feeling the results of peace.''
<p>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The AP on Tuesday that
only a trickle  &MD;  about 6 percent  &MD;  of the dlrs 690 million promised
by donors for the year starting in May had been received so far.
<p>
   Mubarak said the dlrs 2.2 billion in aid pledged overall to the
Palestinians is ``nonsense when you compare it with the money
spent'' in the Middle East in nearly 50 years of warfare.
<p>
   In other comments Mubarak said it is not yet time to lift U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and said that most Arab leaders do not trust
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
<p>
   He expressed hope that peace between Israel and Syria will be
reached by June of next year, and said so-called Islamic
fundamentalists ``have no idea about'' Islam and use it as an
excuse for common crime.
<p>
   Mubarak said delays in aid to Palestinians made the West Bank
and Gaza ``fertile ground for Hamas and the Jihad,'' two of the
main Islamic radical groups.
<p>
   Speaking in an ornate reception room of Ittihadiya Palace,
Mubarak blamed bureaucracy by Western donor nations for the delay
in aid to the Palestinians.
<p>
   He said that if lack of aid prevents development in the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip and West Bank ``it will be a
failure to the whole (peace) process in the Middle East.''
<p>
   ``Terrorism will be violent. It will be tough. Palestine will be
a new, tougher Afghanistan,'' he said. ``The whole area, including
the Europeans, the Arabs, everyone will be affected.''
<p>
   Mubarak said that President Hafez Assad of Syria ``wants to
conclude a peace agreement'' but that Assad must lay the groundwork
for peace since ``even in Syria, public opinion counts.''
<p>
   ``I hope something could be concluded before June next year,''
he said, ``before the campaigns for the elections in Israel and the
United States.''
<p>
   ``I think they will,'' he added.
<p>
   In discussing Iraq, Mubarak said the Iraqi people were the main
victims of economic sanctions and said ``we have to find a way or a
formula to help the people. ... They are suffering, they are
crying. We should find relief for them.''
<p>
   But he added the time was not right for lifting the sanctions
until Iraq implements all U.N. Security Council demands that grew
out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
<p>
   ``Just promises or signatures or papers are not sufficient,'' he
said, referring to Iraq's statement last week recognizing the
borders of Kuwait.
<p>
   ``The Gulf countries and other Arabs don't trust Saddam. They
will never believe him,'' he said. He added, however, that most
Arab nations did not want to see Iraq fall apart because that would
leave Iran as the main power in the Gulf.
<p>
   He stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow, saying that
was a decision for the Iraqi people.
<p>
   ``It is the will of the people,'' he said. ``If the will of the
people is that Saddam will stay and (they) keep suffering, it's
their way.''
<p>
   Mubarak said Egyptian fundamentalists are being funded from
abroad. He said rich Iranian businessmen were among those supplying
money. He also said funds for Islamic causes are being collected in
mosques in the United States but that there is no proof the money
is used for terrorism.
<p>
   He said terrorists use Islam as ``an excuse'' because ``it is a
very good source to collect money.''
<p>
   He said ``those who are committing crimes have no idea about
Islam. ... Some of them have never prayed.'' He said Islam does not
call for violence but ``like any other religion'' it encourages
cooperation and love.
<p>
   Speaking of Egypt's economy, Mubarak said the government was
moving forward with a plan to sell off its vast business empire but
has to move cautiously.
<p>
   ``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did. ... It would be
a collapse,'' he said.
<p>
   He also resisted pressure by the International Monetary Fund for
devaluation of the Egyptian pound. He said the pound's value  &MD; 
about 3.37 to the U.S. dollar  &MD;  is based on market value.
<p>
   ``Don't ask me to devalue by 30 per cent. ... Prices will jump
70 or 80 percent overnight,'' he said.

Government Troops Bogging Down Before Winter Sets In

<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said
Wednesday that government forces appeared to be bogging down as
they sought to stretch Bosnian Serb combat lines before winter sets
in.
<p>
   Fighting continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia,
where Serbs have retaken territory captured by government soldiers
in recent weeks, and elsewhere in northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   But front lines appeared little changed.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said government
attacks that began late last month may have run their course for
the time being.
<p>
   Plans that are not well-coordinated may face a shortage of
ammunition and other supplies, he said. ``What we are seeing now is
a general slowing of military activity,'' Spicer said.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which already is felt in parts of hilly Bosnia. Government
soldiers apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold throughout winter and use as a springboard for attacks in the
spring.
<p>
   They captured hundreds of square kilometers of territory in
northwest Bosnia, and in a coordinated attack with Croat allies,
took the Serb-held town of Kupres about 100 kilometers northwest of
Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government soldiers. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government soldiers still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as fluid.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, in the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has
been totally surrounded throughout the 31-month war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
<p>
   NATO wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast, and
on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia. There,
the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that would
allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in the
fighting.

Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent in October
Eds: RECASTS throughout with consumer price report
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
AP Economics Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in
October as falling energy prices and moderation in food costs
combined to give the United States its best inflation performance
in six months.
<p>
   The small increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, was
better than expected. Many analysts had been forecasting that
October's increase would match a 0.2 percent September gain.
<p>
   Wednesday's report was certain to provide ammunition to critics
of the Federal Reserve who contend that the central bank is engaged
in monetary overkill, boosting interest rates even though there is
no evidence of escalating inflation.
<p>
   The latest Fed rate hike occurred Tuesday when the central bank
boosted two key rates by three-quarters of a point. It was the
biggest increase in the Fed's discount rate, the interest it
charges on bank loans, since May 1981.
<p>
   Major banks immediately followed suit by pushing their prime
rate up by a similar three-quarters of a point to 8.5 percent,
meaning that borrowing costs will be rising for millions of
Americans.
<p>
   So far this year, inflation at the consumer level is rising at
an annual rate of 2.6 percent, even better than last year's 2.7
percent increase. Critics contend that the central bank has no
business slowing the economy and running the risk of a recession in
the face of such an outstanding inflation performance.
<p>
   But the Fed and its supporters contend that the economy is
growing too rapidly at this stage of the economic expansion and
must be slowed or there is a great risk the economy will overheat
and force even sharper rate hikes next year.
<p>
   The government announced with Wednesday's report that it was
changing the way it calculated some key components of the inflation
report  &MD;  housing costs, food and drug prices.
<p>
   The changes are being made to meet complaints that the CPI was
overstating inflation. The government has estimated the impact of
these changes could shave about 0.1 percentage point off the annual
inflation rate.
<p>
   For October, energy prices fell by 0.7 percent. Food costs were
unchanged in October, the best showing since a 0.3 percent decline
last February. Outside the volatile food and energy sectors,
inflation was docile as well. The so-called core inflation rate
rose just 0.2 percent in October, the same as September.
<p>
   One of the biggest declines outside food and energy was a 0.5
percent drop in clothing, the fourth consecutive monthly decline as
price increases for the fall and winter clothing lines continue to
be lower than in previous years.
<p>
   Medical care costs were up 0.6 percent, the biggest increase
since April. Car financing costs were up 1 percent, reflecting the
impact of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
<p>
   The Fed's rate increase Tuesday was the sixth this year and came
despite the fact that critics staged a protest rally outside the
Fed as policy-makers were meeting. The increase was attacked by
Democratic members of Congress.
<p>
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez complained that
the Fed's prime motive in the latest increase was to halt a
precipitous fall in the value of the dollar, which was threatening
to cause a stampede of foreign investors out of U.S. stocks and
bonds.

   The tragic trajectory of Sidney Morris and his family followed a
stolen shipment of Colombian cocaine to this former British colony.
Scotland Yard was called in after the slaying of a top St. Kitts
policeman who was investigating the disappearance Oct. 1 of Vincent
Morris and his girlfriend.
<p>
   ``Mr. (Sidney) Morris and his family have suffered through great
emotional pain and disappointment,'' Prime Minister Kennedy
Simmonds said in a nationwide broadcast late Tuesday in which he
accepted Morris' resignation. ``Our prayers go out to them.''
<p>
   The events have underscored the fragility of small Caribbean
states before powerful drug traffickers, who see the area as a
conduit for Colombian cocaine to the United States and Europe. St.
Kitts and Nevis, with a population of about 40,000, is the smallest
nation in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
   Morris, 59, resigned his various government posts: deputy prime
minister and minister of education, youth and social affairs and
communications, works and public utilities. But he will keep his
parliament seat.
<p>
   His resignation followed mounting pressure from opposition
parties and several business leaders for him to step down. They
said it would be a conflict of interest for Morris to participate
in any Cabinet decision about the deaths and ensuing arrests.
<p>
   Hours ealier Tuesday, Scotland Yard said Vincent Morris, 36, and
girlfiend Joan Walsh, 35, were presumed dead after forensic
evidence showed that two skeletons found matched their sexes and
ages.
<p>
   Also Tuesday, Scotland Yard reversed itself and said the
minister's two other sons, Dean and Dave Morris, are possible
suspects in the deaths. Scotland Yard Superintendent Alec Ross
declined to elaborate.
<p>
   Local police and Scotland Yard detectives found some of the
cocaine shipment in the home that the three Morris brothers shared,
some hidden in a nearby beach and some buried on a nearby farm.
<p>
   The release on bail of the Morris brothers last week prompted a
prison riot in which the jail was burned down, the inmates escaped,
and police and troops from several neighboring Caribbean nations
were called in to restore order.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said
Wednesday that government forces appeared to be bogging down as
they sought to stretch Bosnian Serb combat lines before winter sets
in.
<p>
   Fighting continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia,
where Serbs have retaken territory captured by government soldiers
in recent weeks, and elsewhere in northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   But front lines appeared little changed.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said government
attacks that began late last month may have run their course for
the time being.
<p>
   Plans that are not well-coordinated may face a shortage of
ammunition and other supplies, he said. ``What we are seeing now is
a general slowing of military activity,'' Spicer said.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which already is felt in parts of hilly Bosnia. Government
soldiers apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold throughout winter and use as a springboard for attacks in the
spring.
<p>
   They captured hundreds of square kilometers of territory in
northwest Bosnia, and in a coordinated attack with Croat allies,
took the Serb-held town of Kupres about 100 kilometers northwest of
Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government soldiers. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government soldiers still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as fluid.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, in the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has
been totally surrounded throughout the 31-month war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
<p>
   NATO wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast, and
on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia. There,
the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that would
allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in the
fighting.

   MILAN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Italy's No.1 woman skier Deborah Compagnoni,
suffering from consequences of a bad flu, stayed home Wednesday as
her teammates flew to the United States for the opening World Cup
races in Park City, Utah.
<p>
   A spokesman for the Italian ski Federation (FISI) said that the
Olympic giant slalom champion would join the Italian Alpine team
later this week, after completing medical examinations and tests in
Milan.
<p>
   ``We expect Deborah to start in both races at Park City,'' the
spokesman, Claudio Baldessarri, said.
<p>
   A slalom and a giant slalom are scheduled in the U.S. resort on
Nov. 26-27. Men's races begin in Sestriere, Italy, over the same
weekend.
<p>
   The first events of the 1994-95 World Cup season, scheduled on a
Swiss glacier last week, were canceled due to bad weather.

<p>
   CALAPAN, Philippines (AP) - Mercy Morales' family had been eking
out a simple existence in the central Philippines when Tuesday's
earthquake and tidal wave swept their fishing village. Now four of
their eight children are gone, along with all their material
possessions.
<p>
   She and her husband, Celestino, stared blankly and wiped away
tears as they talked to reporters in a funeral parlor where dead
children were lying in coffins made of plywood donated by the
government.
<p>
   Earlier, as the bodies were being recovered, she caressed a dead
daughter's face and hair and kissed her. The last of the four,
6-year-old Mirasol, had been missing for hours before neighbors
found her behind the two-room village school house, which had been
turned into a makeshift morgue.
<p>
   ``Not a plate, not a ladle or cloth was left with us. Nothing
remained of our belongings,'' said Mrs. Morales, who was staying at
a government shelter two kilometers (1.25 miles) from their former
village of Malaylay. ``We do not know where to go now.''
<p>
   Her husband said his small wooden canoe and their thatch hut
were ripped apart by the tidal wave that followed the predawn
quake.
<p>
   The 5-foot (1.5-meter)-high tidal wave also swept away 32 of the
34 bamboo huts in what used to be the Morales' neighborhood. A
jumble of bamboo splints, palm fronds and pieces of clothing were
among the debris of the former village of about 200 people.
<p>
   The bodies of the Morales' four children were recovered 100
meters (yards) away from where their house had stood in Malaylay
village, just west of Calapan on Mindoro Island, about 120
kilometers (75 miles) south of Manila.
<p>
   The earthquake and the tidal wave killed 67 people: 63 people on
Mindoro and four others in nearby Batangas province on the main
Luzon Island, disaster relief officials said. At least 135 people
were injured and 10 others were missing.
<p>
   In Mindoro neighborhoods aside from the Morales', the earthquake
and tidal wave destroyed 611 houses and damaged 2,345 others.
<p>
   President Fidel Ramos, who was in Indonesia for an Asian
economic summit meeting, cut his visit short by a day and planned
to return Thursday to visit the Mindoro victims, his office said.
<p>
   He would preside over a meeting of disaster relief officials in
Mindoro to determine how the ease the situation, it added.
<p>
   Danilo Aceveda, a Calapan councillor, said the local government
plans a mass burial Thursday for the local earthquake victims.
<p>
   ``The reason for the mass burial is not only to economize but to
also bring dead relatives together,'' Aceveda added.
<p>
   The local government is helping villagers by giving 10,000 pesos
(dlrs 416) for each family member killed and 5,000 pesos (dlrs 208)
for those injured.
<p>
   Alfonso Umali, the province's administrator, said panic buying,
especially of fuel, has been reported in several towns that were
cut off from the capital town of Calapan.
<p>
   Umali said the local government was studying the possibility of
relocating people whose homes were destroyed by the tidal wave.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, a search helicopter rescued a Japanese scientist
and three Filipino guides trapped on a mountain by landslides
unleashed by the earthquake.
<p>
   Yuji Murata, a 41-year-old Tokyo scientist studying orchids for
the Japanese government, and the three Filipinos were picked up
from a clearing on the 5,000-foot (1,515-meter) Mount Bugnay, near
Malaylay.
<p>
   More than 1,448 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Tuesday and
Wednesday, scientists reported.
<p>
   The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro and
destroyed many of its water mains.
<p>
   The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered six miles (10
kilometers) north of the island. A magnitude of 7 indicates a major
quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
<p>
   The Philippines, a Pacific archipelago of 7,100 mountainous
islands, sits on at least four major faults. An earthquake in 1990
killed nearly 2,000 people on Luzon Island.

Father Upset by Disclosure Of Possible Extended Deadline
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  An Islamic militant involved in the abduction
and murder of Israeli-American soldier Nachshon Waxman has said
that kidnappers would have kept him alive for 10 days while
negotiating demands for Palestinian prisoner releases.
<p>
   Yehuda Waxman, the slain soldier's father, said Wednesday he was
upset by the disclosure in Israeli newspapers because it suggested
that an aborted rescue, staged five days after his son's
kidnapping, may have been too hasty.
<p>
   The dailies Yedioth Ahronoth and Maariv published testimony from
Jihad Yaghmour, 27, of east Jerusalem, a Palestinian accomplice of
Waxman's three kidnappers from the Muslim fundamentalist Hamas
movement.
<p>
   Yaghmour was arrested a day before the Oct. 14 attempt to free
Waxman and information he provided was reportedly crucial to the
operation. The three kidnappers were killed in the raid.
<p>
   The transcript was released after state prosecutors used it
Tuesday to fight a Supreme Court appeal against an army order to
seal the homes of the kidnappers' families.
<p>
   The Justice Ministry confirmed the transcript published in the
newspapers was correct.
<p>
   The Waxman case attracted world attention since he was a dual
U.S.-Israeli national. President Clinton met the family when he was
in Israel on Oct. 27.
<p>
   Yaghmour reportedly said that the kidnappers, who he allegedly
helped by renting a van for the Oct. 9 abduction, ``told me that
they had intended to drag out the negotiations for 10 days. If
their conditions were met, they would release the soldier.''
<p>
   ``Their plan was for me to take the soldier to a central road
and then contact police and tell them where to find them,'' once
prisoners were freed, he added.
<p>
   Hamas wanted Israel to release key movement leaders and dozens
of other activists in exchange for Waxman, notably the
wheelchair-bound spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin, who is serving a
life sentence for ordering Arab collaborators killed.
<p>
   Yaghmour's claims conflicted with the rationale given by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin for ordering the raid. Rabin had said he
acted within hours of a deadline set by kidnappers to kill Waxman.
<p>
   Waxman's father told Army radio that what Yaghmour is quoted as
saying, ``definitely means they wanted to negotiate. And if this
was known before the action, that they wanted to drag the
negotiations on for 10 days, there are a lot of questions to ask.''
<p>
   Waxman said that a reporter who published the transcript said it
was dated Oct. 15, the day after the aborted rescue, but that it
was unclear whether he had divulged the information beforehand.

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: Will be led after sales 2200 GMT

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, is
expected to fetch up to 6.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5 million)
at auction Wednesday.
<p>
   Auctioneers Christie's hope the Winter Egg, which the czar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, will
fetch the highest price ever paid for an imperial egg.
<p>
   Nicolas Romanov, a great-great-nephew of the czar, and Tatiana
Faberge, a great-niece of the famed jeweler, planned to attend the
sale at a luxury Geneva hotel.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's put
a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the biggest flawless
heart-shaped diamond sold at auction.
<p>
   David Bennett, Sotheby's European director for jewelry sales,
said he expected it would be bought by a Middle Eastern buyer. The
62.42-carat diamond is newly cut and is classed as D-category  &MD;  the
clearest and purest.
<p>
   The two big auction houses regard Geneva as the most important
international jewelry sales center because it is easily accessible
for Middle and Far Eastern buyers who want to make their purchases
in more discretion than is offered by New York or London.
<p>
   The catalog sales price for the egg is 3.5 - 6.5 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 2.7 - 5.0 million). The record was set by the Love
Trophy Egg, sold in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Czar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and is meant to symbolize the transition from winter
to spring.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the Czar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   ``Large egg made of white topaz (high quality rock-crystal)
decorated with frost motives set with 1,308 rose diamonds and
incrusted in the topaz, with borders set with 360 brilliants, on a
topaz base shaped as a rock of ice with icicles set with rose
diamonds,'' wrote Faberge in his invoice.
<p>
   Unlike many of the eggs that are covered with gold and colored
enamel, the the Winter Egg relies on frosting in the colorless
crystal to hide the traditional surprise.
<p>
   ``Inside the egg is a small platinum basket decorated with 1,378
rose-diamonds, in it anemones of white quartz with nephrite
leaves,'' Faberge added.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, the jeweler fled to
Switzerland and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known
to exist, 10 of them are in Moscow's Kremlin Armory Museum and a
further 11 belong to the Forbes Magazine Collection in New York.
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II owns three. The rest are divided among
museums and private collections in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's has stayed tight-lipped about the seller of the
Winter Egg, merely saying that it is a private individual.

Deputy Premier of Caribbean Nation Quits Over Family Tragedy

<p>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP)  &MD;  The deputy prime minister of this
Caribbean nation quit, just hours after Scotland Yard determined
one of his sons had been killed and two siblings are suspects in
his death.
<p>
   The tragic story of Sidney Morris and his family followed a
stolen shipment of Colombian cocaine to this former British colony.
Scotland Yard was called in after the slaying of a top St. Kitts

British Couple Freed in Baby Smugggling Case
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  A British couple convicted of
attempting to smuggle a baby out of the country on Wednesday were
set free and may leave Romania later this month.
<p>
   Acting on an appeal from Adrian Mooney, 42, and his 40-year-old
wife Bernadette, a Bucharest court, overturning an early prison
sentence, passed a suspended sentence and ordered them out of the
country.
<p>
   Judge Viorel Ros of Bucharest's municipal court told the couple
to leave Romania unless an appeal is lodged within ten working
days. Such an appeal is unlikely after President Ion Iliescu had
announced earlier that the Mooneys would be freed.
<p>
   Bernadette Mooney, a 40-year-old computer operator dressed in a
pink windbreaker and navy trousers, smiled as she climbed into a
British embassy bus waiting outside the court.
<p>
   Scores of cameramen and photographers jostled to get shots of
the couple, who declined to speak to the press after their earlier
prison sentence was overturned.
<p>
   In July, the Mooneys were arrested as they tried to smuggle
Monica Baiaram, a 5-month-old baby, across the Romanian-Hungarian
border.
<p>
   On Oct. 14, a court convicted them of attempted illegal adoption
and sentenced them to 28 months jail.
<p>
   A diplomatic wrangle between Romanian and British officials
followed, Iliescu promised to pardon the couple on a visit to
Britain earlier this month.
<p>
   ``It is obvioulsy very good news for the Mooneys. They seemed to
be very relieved,'' said British Embassy spokesman Laurie Bristow.
<p>
   ``If the prosescution is not going to appeal the sentence they
will be expelled from the country and excluded from Romania for the
next four years,'' he said.

Journalists Charge Newsprint Shortage Politically Motivated
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  Journalists from a wide range of
newspapers warned Wednesday they would soon be unable to publish
because of a paper shortage they charged was politically motivated.
<p>
   The dispute reflected persistent animosities between the
government, which is unaccustomed to criticism, and the free press
which often blurs the distinction between fact and fancy.
<p>
   Journalists from 16 publications signed a petition to the
government demanding that it reduce prohibitive import taxes on
paper or force the only factory producing newsprint to cut exports.
They warned paper supplies would run out in three days.
<p>
   ``This is an offensive by the government against the free
press,'' sai Ion Cristoiu, editor of Romania's best-selling daily
Evenimentul Zilei. He said dwindling supplies had forced the paper
to reduce its print run by half to 150,000.
<p>
   However, Virgil Mireanu, commercial director at the state-run
paper factory in Bacau in northeastern Romania, said newspapers
were short of paper because they had failed to pay their debts.
<p>
   Both houses of parliament have given preliminary approval to
draft legislation that would send journalists to jail for ``insult,
calumny or threatening a public official.''
<p>
   The speaker of the lower chamber of deputies, Adrian Nastase,
earlier this week accused the free press of practicing ``the law of
the jungle and inventing information.'' President Ion Iliescu is

Guerrillas Kill 17 in Two Attacks, Report Says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP)  &MD;  Suspected Khmer Rouge guerrillas
killed 17 people and wounded 33 in two separate attacks on people
celebrating seasonal rites at Buddhist temples, a local newspaper
reported Wednesday.
<p>
   About 30 attackers opened fire and threw hand grenades at a
crowd last Saturday in Borset district of Kompong Speu province,
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Phnom Penh, said the
newspaper Reaksmey Kampuchea. They killed 15 and wounded 23, it
added.
<p>
   Two people were killed and 10 wounded by a hand grenade thrown
into another crowd in the province's Kong Pisey district, the paper
said.
<p>
   There was no immediate official confirmation.
<p>
   The paper also said Khmer Rouge guerrillas entered a village
Sunday in the northwestern province of Battambang and kidnapped 10
villagers.
<p>
   The government reported earlier that guerrillas kidnapped more
than 300 people last week in two northwestern provinces.
<p>
   On Tuesday, government spokesman Ieng Mouly charged that the
Khmer Rouge massacred 50 civilians in Battambang last month after
accusing them of spying for the government.
<p>
   The Khmer Rouge, blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths
during its brutal reign in the 1970s, has been fighting the
Cambodian government elected in U.N.-supervised polls last year.

Balladur Urges Shorter Presidential Term, Anti-Corruption Reforms
Eds: Updates throughout with Balladur proposing sweeping changes.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Sounding like the candidate that he technically
isn't, Premier Edouard Balladur on Wednesday proposed shortening
France's presidential term and urged a moratorium on business
contributions to political campaigns for three years.
<p>
   Balladur, who has refused to declare his candidacy for next
spring's presidential elections until January, wrote what amounted
to a campaign platform in a front-page essay in the center-left
daily Le Monde.
<p>
   The article enabled Balladur to take up the challenge by his
right-wing rival for the presidency, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac,
and ``debate ideas'' without actually getting on the stump and
looking like a candidate.
<p>
   Responding to public disenchantment with France's renewable
seven-year presidential mandates, Balladur proposed cutting the
term to five years or limiting it to a one-off seven years.
<p>
   President Francois Mitterrand proposed such reforms when he was
Socialist opposition leader, but never implemented them after his
election in 1981.
<p>
   Two days after his third Cabinet minister was forced to resign
in a corruption scandal, Balladur proposed changes in the way
French justice operates and political parties do business.
<p>
   The most drastic would be a three-year experiment barring
businesses from contributing to political parties. He also proposed
capping campaign costs and requiring financial disclosures.
<p>
   Payoffs to parties in exchange for public works contracts have
been the major source of corruption scandals that brought down the
Socialists in 1993 and are now chipping at Balladur's popularity.
<p>
   Balladur also offered a radical overhaul of the judicial system.
But such reforms risk looking self-serving at a time ordinary
Frenchmen view most of their politicians as corrupt.
<p>
   For example, Balladur suggested doing away with preventative
detention for first-time suspects. Former communications minister
Alain Carignon, forced to resign over a corruption scandal, is
currently locked up to prevent evidence tampering before he goes to
trial.
<p>
   Chirac has been gaining ground on Balladur on the right since
declaring his candidacy two weeks ago.
<p>
   On the left, polls show the undeclared, unchallenged
front-runner, Jacques Delors, president of the European Union's
executive commission, easily beating Chirac and neck-and-neck with
Balladur.
<p>
   Beaten his last two tries, former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing told Europe-1 radio that he'd decide in February whether
he'll run, based on whether his experience could help the country.
<p>
   Giscard d'Estaing, 68, lost to Mitterrand in 1981 after one
term. He fared worse in 1988, losing the right's mantle to Chirac.
<p>
   The two-round elections will be held April 23 and May 7.

Betselem Calls On Government To Ban Mistreatment Of Detainees
Eds: updates with government spokesman reaction
By GWEN ACKERMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  An Israeli human rights organization demanded
Wednesday that the government ban mistreatment of Palestinians
under interrogation and warned that the abuse would breed more
violence.
<p>
   The Betselem group said in a report that despite the Israel-PLO
peace accord, Israel's Shin Bet security service systematically
abused Palestinian detainees to extract confessions.
<p>
   Betselem also protested reported plans by the government to ease
restrictions on Shin Bet interrogators to help block bombing and
suicide attacks by Muslim militants. Since October, 24 Israeli
civilians and five soldiers were killed in such violence.
<p>
   ``The government is actually asking to get a legal umbrella ...
this is unusually dangerous because it opens a crack that will
widen and no one can say where it will stop,'' Betselem director
Yizhar Beer told a news conference Wednesday.
<p>
   Under existing rules, Shin Bet interrogators are already allowed
``moderate use of force,'' though the list of permissible method
was never made public.
<p>
   Citing testimonies from nine former Palestinian detainees and
protocols from four court hearings, Betselem outlined the abuse at
the hands of the Shin Bet.
<p>
   Interrogators prevent detainees from washing, deprive them of
food, drink and sleep; shout insults and abuse, beat them, tie them
to low chairs and keep them in small closet-like cells, Betselem
said.
<p>
   Betselem said such abuse also took place in army lockups in the
West Bank, though the bulk of interrogations is carried out by the
Shin Bet.
<p>
   Government spokesman Uri Dromi denied allegations of systematic
abuse and unnecessary use of force, adding that the security
services use moderate force only in special instances.
<p>
   ``The use of force is not only legitimate in certain cases but
is also essential in the cases known as the ticking bomb, when we
are sure that getting the information from a terrorist might save
the lives of innocent people,'' Dromi said.
<p>
   Dromi also denied that the regulations for interrogations had
been broadened.
<p>
   An army spokesman said in a statement that ``there is a total
ban on use of violence, threats of violence, degradation, or
brutality against the person being questioned.''
<p>
   Fawzi Mujahed, a 21-year-old Arab journalist from east
Jerusalem, told the news conference that he was held by the Shin
Bet and the army twice since August.
<p>
   ``They put a sack on my head, and took me somewhere, I don't
know exactly where. They put me on a chair 30 centimeters high and
tied me to the chair with handcuffs. The chair was connected to the
floor so it wouldn't move,'' said Mujahed.
<p>
   The interrogators left Mujahed cuffed to the chair for seven
days, then beat his shoulders ``until they were blue.'' They then
forced him to sit on his knees in an arched position, with wrists
and ankles tied to together, he said.
<p>
   Mujahed finally confessed to writing anti-Israeli slogans about
five years ago and now faces trial.
<p>
   Betselem also refuted the ``ticking bomb'' theory presented by
Dromi.
<p>
   Beer said in a few cases this did apply, but that ``in the
decisive majority we are far from such a reality.''
<p>
   Six of the Palestinians who detailed abuse at the hands of the
Shin Bet in the Betselem report were later released without being
charged.
<p>
   Yuval Ginbar, author of the report, said Shin Bet violence could
also spur terror attacks, rather than prevent them.
<p>
   He said two Palestinians questioned by security agents and
released without charges carried out bloody attacks this year.
<p>
   Riyad Zakarneh died in April while exploding a car bomb at a bus
stop in the northern Israeli town of Afula, killing eight Israelis.
Abdul-Munim Abu Hmeid was responsible for the February drive-by
killing of his Shin Bet recruiter.
<p>
   ``Innocent people arrested for long weeks and tortured harshly
go out with a lot of bitterness and anger,'' said Ginbar. ``When
you torture people the benefit is not unequivocal.''
<p>
   ``We, ourselves, are turning into terrorists. A decision to
allow more torture by the Shin Bet is another step on the dangerous
path that surrenders to terrorism,'' said Ginbar.

Former Chicago Seven Anti-War Activist Critically Injured by Car
Eds: UPDATES with Rubin in critical condition Tuesday.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  Jerry Rubin, the former anti-war activist,
remained in critical condition Wednesday with injuries suffered
when he was hit by a car while jaywalking.
<p>
   Rubin, 56, underwent extensive surgery at the University of
California Los Angeles Medical Center, hospital spokesman Angel
Bracamontes said.
<p>
   Rubin, 56, was crossing Wilshire Boulevard Monday evening when
he was struck, police Officer Sandra Castello said. The car's
driver won't be charged, she said.
<p>
   The former radical was among the Chicago Seven, tried for
conspiring to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National Convention,
which turned into a bloody battle between anti-war protesters and
police.
<p>
   Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and three others were convicted of crossing
state lines with intent to riot. The convictions were overturned by
an appeals court, which cited errors made by the judge. They were
acquitted of conspiracy charges.
<p>
   Rubin was a leader of the Yippies  &MD;  the Youth International
Party  &MD;  a loosely knit group of radicals who protested the
government and the Vietnam War.
<p>
   Rubin turned to spiritualism in the 1970s and then became a Wall
Street networker.
<p>
   He moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to sell his line of bee pollen
and ginseng-based nutritional drinks.

Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent in October
Eds: UPDATES with analysts' reaction and further details of CPI
revisions.
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
AP Economics Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in
October as falling energy prices and moderation in food costs
combined to give the United States its best inflation performance
in six months.
<p>
   The small increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, was
better than expected. Many analysts had been forecasting that
October's increase would match a 0.2 percent September gain.
<p>
   Wednesday's report was certain to provide ammunition to critics
of the Federal Reserve who contend that the central bank is engaged
in monetary overkill, boosting interest rates even though there is
no evidence of escalating inflation.
<p>
   The latest Fed rate hike occurred Tuesday when the central bank
boosted two key rates by three-quarters of a point. It was the
biggest increase in the Fed's discount rate, the interest it
charges on bank loans, since May 1981.
<p>
   Major banks immediately followed suit by pushing their prime
rate up by a similar three-quarters of a point to 8.5 percent,
meaning that borrowing costs will be rising for millions of
Americans.
<p>
   So far this year, inflation at the consumer level is rising at
an annual rate of 2.6 percent, even better than last year's 2.7
percent increase. Critics contend that the central bank has no
business slowing the economy and running the risk of a recession in
the face of such an outstanding inflation performance.
<p>
   But the Fed and its supporters contend that the economy is
growing too rapidly at this stage of the economic expansion and
must be slowed or there is a great risk the economy will overheat
and force even sharper rate hikes next year.
<p>
   ``The Fed would say that the low inflation increases show that
its policy is working,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``This report shows that inflation
continues to be tomorrow's problem, not today's.''
<p>
   The government announced in Wednesday's report that it was
changing the way it calculated some key components of the inflation
report  &MD;  housing costs, food and drug prices.
<p>
   The changes, which will take effect at the start of next year,
are being made to meet complaints that the CPI was overstating
inflation. The government has estimated the impact of these changes
could shave about 0.1 percentage point off the annual inflation
rate.
<p>
   For October, energy prices fell by 0.7 percent. Food costs were
unchanged in October, the best showing since a 0.3 percent decline
last February. Outside the volatile food and energy sectors,
inflation was docile as well. The so-called core inflation rate
rose just 0.2 percent in October, the same as September.
<p>
   One of the biggest declines outside food and energy was a 0.5
percent drop in clothing, the fourth consecutive monthly decline as
price increases for the fall and winter clothing lines continue to
be lower than in previous years.
<p>
   Medical care costs were up 0.6 percent, the biggest increase
since April. Car financing costs were up 1 percent, reflecting the
impact of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
<p>
   The Fed's rate increase Tuesday was the sixth this year and came
despite the fact that critics staged a protest rally outside the
Fed as policy-makers were meeting. The increase was attacked by
Democratic members of Congress.
<p>
   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez complained that
the Fed's prime motive in the latest increase was to halt a
precipitous fall in the value of the dollar, which was threatening
to cause a stampede of foreign investors out of U.S. stocks and
bonds.

Italian Commercial Vehicle Sales Up 7.8 Percent In October
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TURIN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Sales of small commercial vehicles in Italy
rose 7.8 percent in October from a year earlier and were up 2.3
percent in the first ten months of 1994.
<p>
   The national association of cars makers (Anfia), which released
the figures on Wednesday, said that a total of 11,112 commercial
vehicles were sold in October, compared with 10,308 in October
1993. Commercial vehicles sold in ten months amounted to 94,613
compared to 92,487 in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Commercial vehicles are small trucks and buses with a weight of
up to 3.5 metric tons.
<p>
   Anfia also said that domestic manufacturers, including Fiat and
Iveco, controlled 54.70 percent of the domestic market in October,
up from 52.92 percent in the same month of 1993. Their market share
totaled 51.20 percent in the first ten months of 1994, up from
49.73 percent in the like year-earlier period.
<p>
   Ford Motor Co. was the biggest seller among the foreign brands,
with 14.07 percent of the market in October, though down from 15.47
percent in October 1993.

Mubarak Sees `New Afghanistan' Without Aid to Palestinians
AP Photo CAI101
By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  President Hosni Mubarak predicted Wednesday
that Gaza and the West Bank could turn into ``a new, tougher
Afghanistan'' unless international aid quickly reaches the
autonomous Palestinian territories.
<p>
   In an interview with The Associated Press and Associated Press
Television, Mubarak also said the violence could spread to Europe
if the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ``don't start
feeling the results of peace.''
<p>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The AP on Tuesday that
only about 6 percent of the dlrs 690 million promised by donors for
the year starting in May had been received.
<p>
   Mubarak said the dlrs 2.2 billion in aid pledged overall to the
Palestinians is ``nonsense when you compare it with the money
spent'' in the Middle East in nearly 50 years of warfare.
<p>
   In other comments Mubarak said it is not yet time to lift U.N.
sanctions on Iraq and that most Arab leaders do not trust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
<p>
   He expressed hope that peace between Israel and Syria will be
reached by June, and said so-called Islamic fundamentalists ``have
no idea about'' Islam and use it as an excuse for common crime.
<p>
   Mubarak said delays in aid to Palestinians made the West Bank
and Gaza ``fertile ground for Hamas and the Jihad,'' two of the
main Islamic radical groups.
<p>
   Speaking in an ornate reception room of Ittihadiya Palace,
Mubarak blamed bureaucracy by Western donor nations for the delay
in aid to the Palestinians.
<p>
   He said that if lack of aid prevents development in the
Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip and West Bank ``it will be a
failure to the whole (peace) process in the Middle East.''
<p>
   ``Terrorism will be violent. It will be tough. Palestine will be
a new, tougher Afghanistan,'' he said. ``The whole area, including
the Europeans, the Arabs, everyone will be affected.''
<p>
   Mubarak said President Hafez Assad of Syria ``wants to conclude
a peace agreement'' but that Assad must lay the groundwork for
peace since ``even in Syria, public opinion counts.''
<p>
   ``I hope something could be concluded before June next year,''
he said, ``before the campaigns for the elections in Israel and the
United States.''
<p>
   In discussing Iraq, Mubarak said the Iraqi people were the main
victims of economic sanctions: ``We have to find a way or a formula
to help the people. ... They are suffering, they are crying.''
<p>
   But he added the time was not right for lifting the sanctions
until Iraq implements all U.N. Security Council demands that grew
out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
<p>
   ``Just promises or signatures or papers are not sufficient,'' he
said, referring to Iraq's statement last week recognizing the
borders of Kuwait.
<p>
   ``The Gulf countries and other Arabs don't trust Saddam. They
will never believe him,'' he said. He added, however, that most
Arab nations did not want to see Iraq fall apart because that would
leave Iran as the main power in the Gulf.
<p>
   He stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow, saying that
was a decision for the Iraqi people.
<p>
   ``It is the will of the people,'' he said. ``If the will of the
people is that Saddam will stay and (they) keep suffering, it's
their way.''
<p>
   Mubarak said Egyptian fundamentalists are being funded from
abroad. He said Iranian businessmen were among those supplying
money. He also said funds for Islamic causes are being collected in
mosques in the United States but that there is no proof the money
is used for terrorism.
<p>
   He said terrorists use Islam as ``an excuse'' because ``it is a
very good source to collect money.''
<p>
   He said ``those who are committing crimes have no idea about
Islam. ... Some of them have never prayed.''
<p>
   Mubarak also said his government was moving cautiously forward
with a plan to sell off its vast business empire.
<p>
   ``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did. ... It would be
a collapse,'' he said.

Yeltsin Vows to Defend Church Property Rights
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  President Boris Yeltsin promised Wednesday to help
the Russian Orthodox Church regain property seized or destroyed by
the Soviet state.
<p>
   Yeltsin met with the church's leader, Patriarch Alexy II, in the
Kremlin to discuss government support for church restoration, the
president's office said. They also considered giving the church
rights to some former properties that now belong to the state.
<p>
   After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, many churches were turned
into museums, clubs, warehouses, even sports facilities, as part of
the communist campaign against religion.
<p>
   The buildings are still considered state property, and in many
cases their current managers are trying to get rights to them under
Russia's privatization program.
<p>
   ``The President proposed announcing a moratorium on such
privatization to take into account the church's interests,''
Yeltsin spokesman Vladimir Alexandrov said.

Bishops Seek Moral Revolution Transcending Politics of Division
Eds: Statements on violence in U.S. and women in church scheduled
before 1700 GMT; lead expected.
By DAVID BRIGGS
AP Religion Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  A pastoral message proposed by U.S. Catholic
bishops' urges the nation's 59 million Catholics to oppose both
euthanasia and the death penalty, economic inequality and the
proliferation of assault weapons, abortion and violent protests at
clinics.
<p>
   ``Fundamentally, our society needs a moral revolution to replace
a culture of violence with a renewed ethic of justice,
responsibility and community,'' the bishops' Domestic Policy
Committee said.
<p>
   The full National Conference of Catholic Bishops was scheduled
to vote on Wednesday, the third day of their annual four-day
meeting, on the statement, ``Confronting a Culture of Violence: A
Catholic Framework for Action.''
<p>
   The bishops also planned to vote on a document that commits the
church to combat sexism and to explore new ways women can share
authority at all levels of church life.
<p>
   Pope John Paul II has ruled out female priests, but women should
take their place in the top ranks of church theologians,
administrators and activists on social issues, the bishops'
Committee on Women in Society and in the Church said in its
proposed statement.
<p>
   In particular, the proposal called on the all-male Catholic
hierarchy to reject authoritarian conduct, establish structures to
respond to the concerns of women and encourage women to pursue
studies in the fields of scripture, theology and canon law.
<p>
   ``In no way should these commitments be construed as `ecclesial
political correctness,''' the bishops said. ``They are
theologically correct.''
<p>
   In their statement on violence, the bishops sought a new
civility in public policy debates that would replace
confrontational politics.
<p>
   ``In the face of so much violence, fear and polarization in our
land, we call for a moral revolution, which begins with a
fundamental respect for human life, which recovers a sense of right
and wrong (and) rejects vengeance in the face of violence,'' said
Bishop John H. Ricard.
<p>
   The bishops said they support stronger gun control measures and
community policing efforts. At the same time they called on
Catholics to address ``the slow motion violence of discrimination
and poverty, hunger and hopelessness, addiction and
self-destructive behavior.''
<p>
   The bishops specifically reject what they call ``bumper-sticker
solutions'' to welfare reform, such as ``one more child and your
benefits are cut.''

Exxon Inks Deal With Indonesia Worth Up To dlrs 40 Billion
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   IRVING, Texas (AP)  &MD;  Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has struck a
deal with the government of Indonesia to spend some dlrs 40 billion
to develop the Natuna natural gas field in the South China Sea.
<p>
   The agreement signed in Jakarta between Exxon affiliate Esso
Exploration and Production Natuna Inc. and Indonesia's national oil
company, Pertamina, clears the way for the partners to seek buyers
of liquefied natural gas in Asia.
<p>
   Exxon said the project will be developed in stages over years to
keep pace with market demand. When demand is high enough, the
project could require 18 offshore platforms and more than 200
production wells.
<p>
   The Natuna field has enough reserves to produce about 2 billion
cubic feet (60 million cubic meters) of gas each day for more than
30 years, the company said.
<p>
   ``Development of Natuna, the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon
resource in southeast Asia and one of the largest in the world,
symbolizes the growth of the Asian energy market ...,'' Exxon
chairman Lee Raymond said in a statement from Jakarta, where he
attended the signing ceremony.
<p>
   ``Exxon is pleased that its affiliate will be a participant and
the operator in this historic undertaking, which will become a
major long-term supplier of LNG to the Asia Pacific market,''
Raymond said.
<p>
   Planning has been under way for many years to develop the remote
field, which was discovered in 1973. Natuna is located 800 miles
(1,290 kms) north of Jakarta in 470 feet (140 meters) of water. The
deep water means platforms must reach 60 stories above the sea
floor.

Contact Group to Meet on Bosnia, NATO Chief Heads For U.S.
By PAUL AMES
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  &MD;  The major powers involved in
negotiating an end to Bosnia's civil war will meet early next month
to try to overcome their differences and relaunch stalled peace
efforts, European officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   Foreign ministers from the so-called Contact Group  &MD;  the United
States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany  &MD;  will hold talks Dec.
2-3 in Brussels, said Hans van den Broek, foreign affairs chief of
the European Union.
<p>
   The five powers drafted a peace plan that the Bosnian Serbs
rejected last summer. Since then, splits have emerged within the
Contact Group over how best to find peace.
<p>
   NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes headed to the United States
on Wednesday hoping to heal a rift between the Washington and its
European allies over the U.S. decision last week to stop enforcing
the international arms embargo on the Bosnian government.
<p>
   He will meet President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and other senior administration officials. He wants to
try to keep the United States from carrying out a threat to drop
the embargo altogether, a move strongly opposed by Russia and West
European nations.
<p>
   Claes also will meet in New York with U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. They are expected to discuss northwest
Bosnia where Serb forces are closing in on the U.N. ``safe area''
round the town of Bihac.
<p>
   NATO and the United Nations are considering declaring an
exclusion zone around Bihac, threatening all heavy weapons in the
area with air strikes.
<p>
   But because NATO warplanes can strike only at targets within
Bosnia, Serb forces shelling Bihac from territory they hold in
neighboring Croatia would be exempt.
<p>
   Extending the air strike threat to Croatian territory would need
a U.N. Security Council resolution and permission from the Croatian
government, said diplomats at the headquarters of the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
<p>
   To avoid civilian casualties, the alliance also would need to
place specialists on the ground in Bihac with equipment to guide
planes to their targets, said the diplomats, who demanded
anonymity.
<p>
   NATO also is worried about the safety of its pilots because
Serbs in the Bihac area are armed with SAM-2 ground-to-air
missiles.
<p>
   Bihac lies less than 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) from Bosnia's
border with the Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   The EU's Van den Broek said the December meeting would aim to
resolve differences among the members of the Contact Group.
<p>
   ``We should not let divisions get in the way. (That) would
weaken our pressure on the Bosnian Serbs,'' he told the Associated
Press on the margins of a meeting of the EU's assembly in
Strasbourg, France.

Ukrainian Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
Eds: UPDATES with details, quotes, other new material throughout;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  In a major boost for worldwide nuclear arms
reduction efforts, Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday approved the
long-stalled nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The vote, which carried 301-8 with 20 abstentions, followed
months of intense diplomatic lobbying by the international
community, particularly the United States. It is a significant step
in strengthening ties between the West and Ukraine, the world's
third-largest nuclear power.
<p>
   ``By this action, we have proved our intention to proceed toward
complete nuclear disarmament,'' said Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader
of the main nationalist party Rukh.
<p>
   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and around
1,800 nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   Although Ukraine has begun dismantling a significant number of
its intercontinental missiles as part of a U.S.-funded three-way
agreement among Washington, Moscow and Kiev, it had hesitated in
ratifying the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   Officials had cited insufficient financial compensation and a
lack of security guarantees from Russia and other states.
<p>
   ``Obstacles halting accession to the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty have been overcome,'' Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told
legislators Wednesday.
<p>
   He said satisfactory guarantees in the form of a multinational
memorandum signed by the United States, Britain and Russia had,
after months of negotiations, been received just hours earlier. A
similar security assurance will be issued by France, Udovenko
assured legislators.
<p>
   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for
Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He stressed that
they included assurances against Ukraine being attacked by both
nuclear and conventional weapons together with substantial
financial support from the West.
<p>
   President Leonid Kuchma, elected last July, has staked a great
deal of his political credibility on steering the treaty through an
often recalcitrant parliament.
<p>
   The former missile plant director has portrayed possession of
the weapons, which Ukraine has no capability to launch, as a
profound liability.
<p>
   ``Experts estimate it will cost 10 billion to 30 billion dollars
a year to keep nuclear weapons,'' Kuchma told legislators. ``It
means we have to sell all our possessions to keep them.''
<p>
   ``Delay (in approval) will only jeopardize our nation's
sovereignty and security,'' he said.
<p>
   Both President Leonid Kuchma and the United States were pushing
for the treaty to be accepted by legislators before his state visit
to Washington next week.
<p>
   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic
of 52 million people to attain nuclear-free status by about the
turn of the century.
<p>
   Washington has strongly backed Ukraine's new economic reforms
under Kuchma this year, spurring Kiev to proceed with its
denuclearization program.
<p>
   Around dlrs 350 million of dlrs 700 million in U.S. aid for
Ukraine in 1994 was targeted at dismantling Ukraine's nuclear
stockpile.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as
``a major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed
by the new nations.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S.
export restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic
equipment and remove a Russian condition for its implementation of
the START-1 treaty.
<p>
   Ukraine's formal signing of the treaty will take place Dec. 5 or
6 at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma said.

   TIRANA, Albania (AP)  &MD;  Goals from strikers Juergen Klinsmann and
Ulf Kirsten gave Germany a 2-1 victory over Albania in its opening
European Championship qualifying match Wednesday.
<p>
   Klinsmann struck in the 18th minute, Hysen Zmijani equalized for
Albania in the 33rd and Kirsten clinched the winner in the 46th.
<p>
   Albania hit the post in the closing seconds, and dropped to 0-2
in the group. In another Group 7 match earlier Wednesday, Georgia
crushed Wales 5-0.
<p>
   Of the 11 Albanian starters, none plays at home. They are
scattered over a half-dozen countries, from Scotland to Saudi
Arabia.
<p>
   The Germans had won seven of the eight previous matches against
Albania, but the only draw, 0-0 in 1967, eliminated Germany from
the following year's European Championship finals, the only time
Germany failed to qualify for a major tournament.
<p>
   Trying to erase the memory of losing the World Cup title with a
quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria this summer, Germany began the match
strongly, although it was missing midfielder Thomas Haessler.
<p>
   Haessler is still recovering from recent tooth surgery and was
replaced by Dieter Eilts.
<p>
   Klinsmann shot the Germans ahead after a brilliant move by the
former world champions. Matthias Sammer fed Stefan Reuter on the
right and the fast midfielder sped down the wing, sending a sharp
cross from the run.
<p>
   The ball found Klinsmann at the far post, about 8 meters (yards)
out. The Tottenham striker headed the ball into the opposite corner
for the 1-0 lead.
<p>
   The Germans allowed the Albanians to recover from the shock and
the home team began to threaten the German goal.
<p>
   The equalizer came form a free kick, after Juergen Kohler had
fouled Arthur Lekbello just outside the area.
<p>
   Zmijani, who plays in Saudi Arabia, curled the free kick through
the badly-placed German wall, with the ball passing by Thomas
Berthold and finding the low left corner.
<p>
   Germany came out after the interval with Thomas Strunz for
Sammer.
<p>
   Just 25 seconds into the second half, the Germans were back in
the lead. Ulf Kirsten pounced on a loose ball in the area after the
Albanians failed to clear and beat goalkeeper Foto Strakosha with a
low shot.
<p>
   Germany then controlled the pace, keeping possession and
allowing little room for Albanian forwards.
<p>
   The best opportunity for the Germans came late in the game,
after a controversial decision by Ukrainian referee Vasily
Melnichuk, who ruled an Albanian clearing attempt as a backpass to
goalkeeper and awarded an indirect free kick to the Germans from
some seven meters (yards).
<p>
   The ball was rolled to German captain Lothar Matthaeus, playing
his 120th international, but Strakosha got his hand on the shot and
the ball bounced off the post.
<p>
   In the dying seconds, Ledio Pano hit the post with another free
kick.
<p>
   A sell-out crowd of 23,000 watched the game on a sunny afternoon
in the Quemal Stafa stadium, while scores of fans scaled the
outside walls to see the game.
<p>
   Albania: Foto Strakosha; Rudi Vata, Arthur Lekbello, Arjan

   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic
of 52 million people to attain nuclear-free status by about the
turn of the century.
<p>
   Washington has strongly backed Ukraine's new economic reforms
under Kuchma this year, spurring Kiev to proceed with its
denuclearization program.
<p>
   Around dlrs 350 million of dlrs 700 million in U.S. aid for
Ukraine in 1994 was targeted at dismantling Ukraine's nuclear
stockpile.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as
``a major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed
by the new nations.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S.
export restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic
equipment and remove a Russian condition for its implementation of
the START-1 treaty.
<p>
   Ukraine's formal signing of the treaty will take place Dec. 5 or
6 at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma said.

World Wildlife Delegates Reject Proposals to Lift Whale, Elephant
Meat Bans
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A South African proposal to harvest
elephants was withdrawn during a world wildlife conference after it
failed to gain support from neighboring African nations, the United
States and Europe.
<p>
   Fears that South Africa might resume trading ivory, which was
banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species in 1989, caused negative reaction to the proposal Tuesday
from other African countries.
<p>
   But South Africa does not intend to re-enter the ivory market,
Simon Stuart, director of the Species Survival Program for the
World Conservation Union (IUCN), said Tuesday.
<p>
   ``There is a fear, and misinformation, that the skin trade could
lead to an outbreak of poaching elephants. But that is not the
case,'' Stuart said.
<p>
   ``Taking the skin off an elephant is a skilled business. It's
not like killing the elephant and cutting off the tusks,'' he said.
<p>
   South Africa made the proposal because it has a highly
successful elephant management program, Stuart said.
<p>
   Of South Africa's 9,000 elephants, 7,500 live in the Kruger
National Park.
<p>
   Conservation has been so successful in South Africa that 300-350
elephants must be killed each year to maintain the habitat,
according to IUCN statistics.
<p>
   South Africa sought the proposal to allow the selling of meat
and skins from these elephants to benefit the elephant conservation
program, Stuart said.
<p>
   Ivory collected from these elephants is stockpiled by the
government.
<p>
   ``Ivory is kept under lock and key in South Africa,'' Stuart
said, referring to the ban on trading elephant tusks.
<p>
   Many northern African countries do not have successful
conservation programs in place, resulting in a continuing increase
in reports of poaching, Stuart said.
<p>
   These differences posed the major stumbling block between the
African nations at the meeting, he said.
<p>
   ``The good news out of this is that we established a mechanism
for resolving the differences of opinion,'' Stuart said.
<p>
   The African delegations agreed to have a series of meetings in
Africa to further discuss South Africa's proposal. The meetings
will be backed by the IUCN and supported by the United States.
<p>
   ``After this conference has ended  &MD;  regardless of how the
elephant issue is finally resolved  &MD;  there will remain a critical
need for elephant range states to forge a common approach towards
the long-term conservation of the species,'' said Mollie Battie,
head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
<p>
   ``We believe that this kind of dialogue among African elephant
range states should continue, and we are prepared to provide
whatever assistance we can  &MD;  financial or otherwise.''
<p>
   Also Tuesday, a proposal by Norway seeking to lift a ban on
trade in whale meat was overwhelmingly rejected.
<p>
   While the Minke Whale of the northeast Atlantic is the most
numerous of the great whale species, CITES placed it on the
endangered list in 1986 after the International Convention for
Regulation of Whaling called for a moratorium on commercial
whaling.
<p>
   The International Whaling Commission, which meets in Dublin next
May, has the official voice in any decision to lift the moratorium.
Only after the moratorium is lifted would CITES consider the
separate issue of whether to re-open trade in whale meat.
<p>
   The United States and most European nations were among those
voting against Norway's proposal, which was rejected 48-16.
<p>
   Unless the moratorium is lifted, the Minke Whale will remain on
CITES endangered species list, which bans international trade.

With Egypt-Mubarak Interview
President Urges `Gradual' Privatization of Egyptian Economy
By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday that
the Egyptian economy would be badly damaged if the country were to
rush its privatization program.
<p>
   He called for a ``gradual pace,'' despite urging from the
International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions to
speed up the process.
<p>
   Mubarak also said in an interview with AP-Dow Jones that Egypt
would resist pressure from the IMF and the World bank to devalue
the Egyptian pound.
<p>
   His remarks came as the IMF was preparing to send a new team to
the country before the end of November to discuss economic reforms.
<p>
   Egypt has been at loggerheads with the IMF over the slow pace of
privatization of its socialized economy and the value of the pound.
The IMF's displeasure has blocked a decision by the so-called
``Paris Club'' of Western nations to write off some dlrs 4 billion
in Egyptian debts.
<p>
   ``We cannot do like the former Soviet Union did,'' Mubarak said
in the interview. ``It would be a collapse.''
<p>
   On the pound, he said: ``Don't ask me to devalue by 30 percent.
... Prices will jump 70 or 80 percent overnight.''
<p>
   He said deficits would increase and exports would decline.
<p>
   Mubarak argued that the value of the pound was set by market
forces, as international institutions wanted, and that he would
refuse to intervene to change the current exchange rate of about
3.37 pounds to the dollar.
<p>
   Analysts here say, however, that the strength of the pound has
been maintained through the use of artificially high interest
rates, which have drawn speculative deposits from abroad. At the
same time, the high rates have slowed economic growth.
<p>
   Mubarak said that if privatization is carried out through
``quick measures'' it ``may create problems.''
<p>
   But he said he does not think privatization will create
large-scale unemployment. He said the private sector would absorb
workers displaced from the public sector.

Students Demonstrate Again Against Turkish Occupation

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  &MD;  Greek Cypriot students clashed with
policemen and U.N. soldiers who blocked their attempt Wednesday to
cross into a Turkish-occupied enclave to protest the detention of
five of their peers the day before.
<p>
   Waving Greek and Cypriot flags, demonstrators thronged to the
180-kilometer-long (122-mile) Green Line that splits the island
into Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sectors.
<p>
   The largest gathering was in Nicosia. Rejecting police orders to
stop, thousands of students pushed through barbed wire barricades
into a buffer zone patrolled by United Nations troops.
<p>
   They overpowered the peacekeepers, overran their observation
post and smashed its windows. Then they replaced the U.N. flag with
a Greek one.
<p>
   Scuffles ensued as Cypriot policemen and the peacekeepers teamed
up to push the demonstrators back. The students finally dispersed
two hours later after the international peacekeepers fired tear gas
at them.
<p>
   On Tuesday, demonstrators protesting the 11th anniversary of the
proclamation of a breakaway state in northern Cyprus clashed with
Turkish troops on the Green Line.
<p>
   Twelve Greek Cypriots, 10 Turkish Cypriots and two U.N.
peacekeepers were injured. Five Greek Cypriot students were
arrested by the Turkish Cypriot authorities after they advanced to
the dividing line.
<p>
   U.N. troops were trying to obtain their release Wednesday, when
the new demonstrations turned violent.
<p>
   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkey invaded
and seized the northern third of the island in July 1974 in the
wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
<p>
   The Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their independence Nov. 15,
1983, but only Turkey has recognized their state.

British Couple Freed in Baby Smugggling Case
Eds: UPDATES with duration of suspended sentence, other details,
background.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  A British couple convicted of
attempting to smuggle a baby out of the country on Wednesday were
set free and may leave Romania later this month.
<p>
   Acting on an appeal from Adrian Mooney, 42, and his 40-year-old
wife Bernadette, a Bucharest court, overturning an early prison
sentence, sentenced them to two years each, suspended for four
years, and ordered them out of the country.
<p>
   Judge Viorel Ros of Bucharest's municipal court told the couple
to leave Romania unless an appeal is lodged within ten working
days. Such an appeal is unlikely after President Ion Iliescu had
announced earlier that the Mooneys would be freed.
<p>
   Bernadette Mooney, a 40-year-old computer operator dressed in a
pink windbreaker and navy trousers, smiled as she climbed into a
British embassy bus waiting outside the court.
<p>
   Scores of cameramen and photographers jostled to get shots of
the couple, who declined to speak to the press after their earlier
prison sentence was overturned.
<p>
   In July, the Mooneys were arrested as they tried to smuggle
Monica Baiaram, a 5-month-old baby, across the Romanian-Hungarian
border.
<p>
   On Oct. 14, a court convicted them of attempted illegal adoption
and sentenced them to 28 months jail.
<p>
   A diplomatic wrangle between Romanian and British officials
followed. Iliescu promised to pardon the couple on a visit to
Britain earlier this month.
<p>
   ``It is obvioulsy very good news for the Mooneys. They seemed to
be very relieved,'' said British Embassy spokesman Laurie Bristow.
<p>
   ``If the prosescution is not going to appeal the sentence they
will be expelled from the country and excluded from Romania for the
next four years,'' he said.
<p>
   The Mooneys paid dlrs 6,000 to their middlemen and the baby's
17-year-old natural parents, whose earlier prison term was also
commuted to a suspended sentence. The parents had been handed a
one-year prison term to start when they reach age 18.
<p>
   The three middlemen earlier had been sentenced to 32 months in
jail. The head of the gang, Ioan Batrana, had his sentence reduced
to 24 months, his two accomplices to 18 months.
<p>
   The Mooneys have been staying in a rented apartment in Bucharest
with their three-year-old legally adopted Romanian daughter Grace
since their trial began on Sept. 2.
<p>
   Thousands of prospective adopters flocked to Romania after the
December 1989 revolution, which revealed more than 100,000 unwanted
infants. These children were the result of dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's bid to increase the population by strictly curbing
abortion and birth control.
<p>
   In 1991, Romania tightended its adoption laws to crack down on
widespread baby racketeering.

Ivory Coast Star Jailed For Beating Son
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ANGERS, France (AP)  &MD;  A member of Ivory Coast's national soccer
squad was sentenced on appeal Wednesday to nine years in prison for
nearly beating his six-year-old son to death.
<p>
   Oumar Ben Salah, who plays for the French club Le Mans, was
arrested last year for beating his son, Mohammed, who was
hospitalized for several weeks with severe injuries.
<p>
   Salah admitted to abusing his son for months and was sentenced
by the trial court to seven years imprisonment. The appellate court
added two more years for being an unfit father.
<p>
   Salah's French wife, Marie-Laure, who is not the child's natural
mother, is serving a three-year prison term for failing to assist a
person in danger. She did not appeal.

   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP)  &MD;  The World Bank said Wednesday it had
granted dlrs 40 million in aid to drought-stricken Malawi.
<p>
   The bank said in a statement that a large portion of the aid
would be used to import 100,000 tons of maize to help feed
Malawians.
<p>
   Luke Banda, head of Malawi's Disaster Preparedness Commission,
said earlier this year that more than 3 million Malawians were
threatened by hunger because of the drought's effect on harvests.
<p>
   The World Bank said another portion of its credit was to be used
to support economic reforms, including bolstering the Malawi
currency, the kwacha. The kwacha, which stood at 4.45 to the dollar
when is was allowed to float in February, has plummeted to 15 to
the dollar.

Heavy Fighting Reported in the Northern Breakaway Republic
By PAULINE JELINEK
Associated Pesss Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP)  &MD;  Heavy fighting by rival clans shook the
capital of Somalia's breakaway Somaliland Republic on Wednesday,
forcing the evacuation of foreign aid workers.
<p>
   More than 20 foreign workers for U.N. and private aid groups in
Hargeisa were taken to safety, said Yukiko Hadena, spokeswoman in
Nairobi for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
<p>
   Hundreds of civilians fled under the fire of mortars,
anti-aircraft guns and small arms.
<p>
   A faction allied with warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid claimed it
had captured the capital, Hargeisa, killing 70 and arresting 200
Somaliland troops, but none of those details could be confirmed.
<p>
   The battle in Hargeisa is the first serious interclan fighting
in northwest Somalia in more than a year. It comes as the United
Nations prepares to withdraw its 16,500 peacekeepers from southern
Somalia and the country's warlords jockey for power in the ensuing
vacuum.
<p>
   The Republic of Somaliland seceeded from the Horn of Africa
nation three years ago but has never been recognized nationally or
internationally. It's president, Mohamed Hagi Egal, last week
invited all of Somalia's faction leaders to attend a reconciliation
conference but vowed not to renounce the secession.
<p>
   The fighting between Egal's troops and militiamen of the Somali
National Movement began Monday, said Movement spokesman Ismail
Mohamed Buubas. Movement chairman Abduraman Ahmed Ali renounced the
secession in April, split with Egal and moved over to the Aidid
camp.
<p>
   Ali is attending a reconciliation conference of Aidid supporters
under way in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and it was suspected
Wednesday that Aidid was behind the attack on Hargeisa.
<p>
   Aidid's conference, aimed at establishing a new government, has
excluded Egal and chief Aidid rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who controls
the northern half of Mogadishu.
<p>
   Aidid controls the southern half of Mogadishu and most of the
rest of southern Somalia. If he were to overthrow the Somaliland
Republic, he would have only to defeat Ali Mahdi for control of the
country.
<p>
   Hargeisa, once a city of 250,000 people, was virtually leveled
in 1988 in bombing ordered by former dictator Mohammed Siad Barre
to quell unrest in northern Somalia.
<p>
   Somaliland seceded right after Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 and
was spared the clan fighting that erupted in Mogadishu and caused
the 1992 famine in which 300,000 pepole died.

Fashanu Fined for Comments About Cantona
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Aston Villa striker John Fashanu was fined 6,000
pounds (dlrs 9,600) Wednesday by the English Football Association
for making derogatory comments about French and Manchester United
forward Eric Cantona.
<p>
   In his weekly newspaper column in the Sept. 20 edition of the
Sun newspaper, Fashanu accused Cantona of ``malicious'' and
``cowardly'' play, and said the Frenchman was ``in need of urgent
help.''
<p>
   The comments were prompted by a tackle Cantona made against
Liverpool's Neil Ruddock in a Premier League match.
<p>
   Manchester United lodged an official complaint.
<p>
   ``Fashanu didn't ask for a personal hearing and the case was
dealt with on correspondence,'' FA spokesman Mike Parry said. ``We
wrote to Fashanu, he wrote back and now we have found him guilty of
misconduct.''

   The six were the first people charged under the Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act after it was signed into law by
President Clinton in May. Each was convicted of a misdemeanor for a
first-time nonviolent offense.
<p>
   Last month, Paul Hill became the first person convicted under
the new law in the fatal shooting of an abortion doctor and his
escort in Pensacola, Fla. Earlier this month, a jury recommended
the death penalty for Hill after his state court trial on murder
charges.
<p>
   Evidence in the Milwaukee trial included a videotape of the June
protest during which the defendants used cars, chains and concrete
to block access to Affiliated Medical Services.
<p>
   Demonstrators blocked the entrance and closed the building for
about 90 minutes before police and firefighters pried them loose.
<p>
   ``There's no question from the ... evidence that this was a very
intentional and deliberate attempt to close Affiliated Medical
Services,'' said U.S. District Judge J.P. Stadtmueller, who heard
the case without a jury because the offenses were misdemeanors.
<p>
   The law prohibits blockades, violence or threats against
abortion clinics, workers and clients, with tougher penalties for
acts of violence.
<p>
   ``We knew children were scheduled to die that day,'' one
defendant, 20-year-old Michael Suhy, said in his closing statement
Tuesday. ``If I wanted to protest abortion, I'd write to my
senators and congressmen  &MD;  I was there to save lives.''
<p>
   At least four of the six said they would appeal, arguing the law
violates their First Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution to
peaceful protest.
<p>
   Each of the Milwaukee defendants faces up to six months in
prison and a dlrs 10,000 fine at sentencing Feb. 13. Subsequent
offenses are felonies and provide tougher penalties for violent
actions.
<p>
   Hill could get life in prison on his federal conviction at
sentencing Dec. 9.
<p>
   Those convicted in Milwaukee were Ronald D. Brock, 56; Dale
Pultz, 33; and James Soderna, 32, all of Milwaukee; Suhy, of
Canton, Mich.; Marilyn R. Hatch, 44, Seattle; and Colin L. Hudson,
47, Weaverville, N.C.
<p>
   The six, and two other protesters from the same demonstration,
face a lawsuit by the clinic, which wants dlrs 5,000 from each as
well as punitive damages set by a jury.
<p>
   Compensatory damages cover financial loss; punitive damages are
meant to punish and deter wrongdoing.
<p>
   The federal law was prompted by the 1993 murder of abortion
doctor David Gunn at a different Pensacola clinic during an
abortion protest. Michael Griffin is serving life in prison for the
killing.

Bishops Seek Moral Revolution Transcending Politics of Division
EDS: UPDATES throughout with vote on violence; vote on women in
church also scheduled.
By DAVID BRIGGS
AP Religion Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  A pastoral message adopted by U.S. Catholic
bishops' on Wednesday urged the nation's 59 million Catholics to
oppose both euthanasia and the death penalty, economic inequality
and the proliferation of assault weapons, abortion and violent
protests at clinics.
<p>
   ``This is not about politics and policies but life and death,''
Auxiliary Bishop John H. Ricard of Baltimore said. ``Our entire
nation is slipping into an acceptance of violence  &MD;  in our policies
of abortion on demand and increasing executions, in our high rates
of crime and our exploitation of violence in entertainment.''
<p>
   In their unanimously adopted statement, ``Confronting a Culture
of Violence: A Catholic Framework for Action,'' the bishops sought
a new civility in public policy debates that would replace
confrontational politics with concern for the common good.
<p>
   ``In the face of so much violence, fear and polarization in our
land, we call for a moral revolution, which begins with a
fundamental respect for human life, which recovers a sense of right
and wrong, rejects vengeance in the face of violence,'' said
Ricard, chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee.
<p>
   The bishops said they support stronger gun control measures and
community policing efforts. At the same time they called on
Catholics to address ``the slow motion violence of discrimination
and poverty, hunger and hopelessness, addiction and
self-destructive behavior.''
<p>
   The bishops specifically reject what they call ``bumper-sticker
solutions'' to welfare reform, such as ``one more child and your
benefits are cut.''
<p>
   The bishops also planned to vote on Wednesday, the third day of
their annual four-day meeting, on a statement that commits the
church to combat sexism and to explore new ways women can share
authority at all levels of church life short of the priesthood.
<p>
   Pope John Paul II has ruled out female priests, but women should
take their place in the top ranks of church theologians,
administrators and activists on social issues, the bishops'
Committee on Women in Society and in the Church says in its
proposed statement.
<p>
   In particular, the proposal called on the all-male Catholic
hierarchy to reject authoritarian conduct, establish structures to
respond to the concerns of women and encourage women to pursue
studies in the fields of scripture, theology and canon law,
traditionally dominated by the clergy.
<p>
   ``In no way should these commitments be construed as `ecclesial
political correctness,''' the bishops said. ``They are
theologically correct.''

Navratilova Leaves Near Unreachable Legacy
By BOB GREENE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Martina Navratilova's exploits during her 21
years in women's tennis will fill many pages in the record book,
including most match victories, 1,438, and most tournament titles,
167.
<p>
   Her final singles match Tuesday night at the Virginia Slims
Championships ended in a 6-4, 6-2 defeat to Gabriela Sabatini, only
the 212th loss of her career.
<p>
   Navratilova's career, however, was not just about winning
tournaments.
<p>
   ``I'm going to start with what she meant to all of us,'' said
Steffi Graf, who replaced Navratilova as the world's top-ranked
player. ``I think by just being here tonight you could see what she
means to tennis, to the spectators, to all the players, and that
doesn't happen very often, I think, in any sport, that all the
players show so much respect to a person.
<p>
   ``She had such a long career and at such a high level. There are
not many athletes you can find around in any sport who competed at
a certain level like that.
<p>
   ``She gave a lot to the sport,'' Graf noted. ``She was always
there with her whole heart, and I think that all that together has
made her so special.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   ``She was always special to me.'' Graf said. ``I have a lot of
memories of a lot of things that happened between us, and always
some great matches. We had a lot of things that we liked the same.
For example, our passion toward Wimbledon or about competing, just
playing tennis. I think we are similar in this way.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   After the final point in their match, Sabatini and Navratilova
met at the net and embraced.
<p>
   ``I said, `I'm sorry I won,' but she said, `If you play like
that, you can beat everybody. That's the way to play,''' Sabatini
said.
<p>
   ``But it was really hard. On one side I didn't want to be the
one to beat her. And on the other side, I was thinking, `Well, this
is a great honor for me to get to play Martina in her last
tournament.'''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   ``She brought fresh new honesty to the game,'' said Chris Evert,
who played Navratilova 84 times and wound up on the losing end of a
45-39 record. ``She wore her heart on her sleeve and she was never
afraid to speak out and say what she felt.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   ``She has brought women's tennis to another level,'' Jana
Novotna said. ``She was the first player to get into fitness and
work out with weights, she played a different kind of game than
anybody else, and she was so good and in such great shape. All the
other players had to become better in order to compete.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   Asked what she felt was her greatest gift to tennis, Navratilova
said:
<p>
   ``I think beging the constant professional, giving everything I
have on the court and off the court, always trying to do my best,
striving for excellence. And apparently that's rubbed off on a lot
of people, so I think that's the best part that I take, that I have
influenced people who are not even tennis players. That's pretty
amazing what you can do when you hit the tennis ball pretty well.''
<p>
   Asked if she thought she was the greatest women's player,
Navratilova quickly replied no.
<p>
   ``There are too many. Many whose careers have been much shorter
for whatever reasons,'' she said. ``You know, the great tennis
player may be Monica Seles. I don't know, but she only was at it
for three years. Maybe she'll come back and blow us all away.
<p>
   ``You can't measure the greatest by longevity or one great year.
It is a combination of a lot of things.
<p>
   ``I have the numbers because I've played for such a long time,
but there are other people that certainly are in that catelory,
like Suzanne Lenglen, Helen Moody, Alice Marble, Maureen Connolly,
Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, Margaret Court. It's nice to be in
that company.
<p>
   ``I think the thing I will miss the most is playing against top
players like Gaby. I won't miss getting passed all those times, but
being on the court against the best: Steffi Graf, Chris Evert,
Monica Seles, Evonne Goolagong, Billie Jean King and Margaret Court
<p>
   ``For me, those were the real moments  &MD;  Virginia Wade, as well  &MD; 
playing against players that are champions. That's a treat.''

Berlusconi Government, Unions in Growing Clash
Eds: UPDATES with marches in several cities to protest vote and
cuts. Confidence vote in progress but not expected to be completed
before about 1600 GMT
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  The Northern League on Wednesday assured its support
for the government in a confidence vote called by Premier Silvio
Berlusconi in an effort to push forward with his austerity budget.
<p>
   The confidence vote was under way in late afternoon.
<p>
   But the League, often a reluctant partner in the conservative
governing coalition, also promised to promote negotiations with
labor unions, which have called a general strike to protest
proposed cutbacks in Italy's generous pension system.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's
position as debate began in the Chamber of Deputies, said the
League ''recognized the need for the country to be governed.''
Berlusconi would have to resign if he lost the vote.
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   ``It's a sign of serious arrogance, but also weakness in the
government,'' Massimo D'Alema, leader of the leftist opposition
Democratic Party of the Left, said Tuesday.
<p>
   At the same time, Berlusconi says he wants to meet with the
nationwide labor federations next week. And government officials
met Tuesday night with opposition legislators to hear their request
to slice away the pension cuts from the budget package.
<p>
   ``The declaration of war is accepted,'' said Fabio Mussi, a
lawmaker with the Democratic Party of the Left.
<p>
   The unions hardened their stance Tuesday, calling for an
eight-hour general strike Dec. 2.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
jelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome. They
were given three hours of live coverage on RAI state television's
third channel, long under left-wing influence and hostile to
Berlusconi.
<p>
   On Thursday, tens of thousands of retirees, workers and students
joined marches in Milan, Bologna and other cities to protest cuts.
In Genoa, demonstrators occupied the port city's two main train
stations, delaying rail traffic.
<p>
   Berlusconi said the government must stick to its plan to send a
message to international financial markets that it was serious
about cutting a dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   The government won a confidence vote in the Chamber Monday
night, 321-131, on a proposed amnesty on illegal construction
expected to bring in dlrs 3.3 billion from back taxes and fines.
<p>
   But things won't be so easy when the budget plan reaches the
Senate. There, the coalition government of the federalist Northern
League, right-wing National Alliance and Berlusconi-formed Forza
Italia (Let's Go, Italy) falls short of a majority.
<p>
   The budget must be passed by Dec. 31.

Betselem Calls On Government To Ban Mistreatment Of Detainees
Eds: updates with reaction of Shin Bet officer; edits to trim
By GWEN ACKERMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  An Israeli human rights organization demanded
Wednesday that the government ban mistreatment of Palestinians
under interrogation and warned that the abuse would breed more
violence.
<p>
   The Betselem group said in a report that despite the Israel-PLO
peace accord, Israel's Shin Bet security service systematically
abused Palestinian detainees to extract confessions.
<p>
   Betselem also protested reported plans by the government to ease
restrictions on Shin Bet interrogators to help block bombing and
suicide attacks by Muslim militants. Since October, 24 Israeli
civilians and five soldiers were killed in such violence.
<p>
   ``The government is actually asking to get a legal umbrella ...
this is unusually dangerous because it opens a crack that will
widen and no one can say where it will stop,'' Betselem director
Yizhar Beer told a news conference Wednesday.
<p>
   Under existing rules, Shin Bet interrogators are already allowed
``moderate use of force,'' though the list of permissible method
was never made public.
<p>
   Citing testimonies from nine former Palestinian detainees and
protocols from four court hearings, Betselem outlined the abuse at
the hands of the Shin Bet.
<p>
   Interrogators prevent detainees from washing, deprive them of
food, drink and sleep; shout insults and abuse, beat them, tie them
to low chairs and keep them in small closet-like cells, Betselem
said.
<p>
   A senior Shin Bet officer said force was used only in specific
cases. ``We do not deal in torture, but it is understandable that
when we deal with Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who hold
hostages or know where a time bomb or car bomb are ticking, we
would not be so gentle,'' he told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Government spokesman Uri Dromi denied allegations of systematic
abuse and said security services use moderate force only in special
instances.
<p>
   ``The use of force is not only legitimate in certain cases but
is also essential in the cases known as the ticking bomb, when we
are sure that getting the information from a terrorist might save
the lives of innocent people,'' Dromi said.
<p>
   Dromi also denied that the regulations for interrogations had
been broadened.
<p>
   Betselem dismissed the ``ticking bomb'' theory presented by
Dromi. Beer said in a few cases this did apply, but that ``in the
decisive majority we are far from such a reality.''
<p>
   Six of the Palestinians who detailed abuse at the hands of the
Shin Bet in the Betselem report were later released without being
charged, he said.
<p>
   Fawzi Mujahed, a 21-year-old Arab journalist from east
Jerusalem, told the news conference that he was held by the Shin
Bet and the army twice since August.
<p>
   ``They put a sack on my head, and took me somewhere, I don't
know exactly where. They put me on a chair 30 centimeters high and
tied me to the chair with handcuffs. The chair was connected to the
floor so it wouldn't move,'' said Mujahed.
<p>
   The interrogators left Mujahed cuffed to the chair for seven
days, then beat his shoulders ``until they were blue.'' They then
forced him to sit on his knees in an arched position, with wrists
and ankles tied to together, he said.
<p>
   Mujahed finally confessed to writing anti-Israeli slogans about
five years ago and now faces trial.
<p>
   Yuval Ginbar, author of the report, said Shin Bet violence could
also spur terror attacks, rather than prevent them.
<p>
   He said two Palestinians questioned by security agents and
released without charges carried out bloody attacks this year.
<p>
   Riyad Zakarneh died in April while exploding a car bomb at a bus
stop in the northern Israeli town of Afula, killing eight Israelis.
Abdul-Munim Abu Hmeid was responsible for the February drive-by
killing of his Shin Bet recruiter.
<p>
   ``Innocent people arrested for long weeks and tortured harshly
go out with a lot of bitterness and anger,'' said Ginbar. ``When
you torture people the benefit is not unequivocal.''
<p>
   ``We, ourselves, are turning into terrorists. A decision to
allow more torture by the Shin Bet is another step on the dangerous
path that surrenders to terrorism,'' said Ginbar.

BC-Children At War
Report: Children More Likely To Be Killed In War Than Soldiers
With BC-Children-Facts
With AP Photo
By EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Children are more likely to be killed in wars than
soldiers, according to a report Thursday by the British relief
agency Save The Children.
<p>
   In the past decade, more than 1.5 million children met violent
deaths and 4 million sustained permanent injuries as a result of
bombs, bullets, land mines, chemical weapons and even machete
attacks, it said.
<p>
   The 25-page report, ``Children at War,'' documents how the
rights of children, supposedly guaranteed by a U.N. convention
which has been ratified by 162 countries, are continually being
undermined by an increasing number of conflicts around the world.
<p>
   ``The new world order has proved to be a world of disorder for
civilians  &MD;  and particularly children,'' said Mike Aaronson, Save
The Children's overseas director.
<p>
   ``Nine out of 10 casualties of war are civilians,'' he said.
``Children are very often the main casualties  &MD;  and they are indeed
much more likely to be casualties of war than are soldiers.''
<p>
   According to the report, 10 million children  &MD;  one child in
every 200 worldwide  &MD;  have been traumatized by the effects of war,
12 million children have lost their homes and 5 million have been
forced to live in refugee camps in the last decade.
<p>
   A video released with the report showed chilling scenes of
children who had been burned, maimed, orphaned and traumatized in
civil wars in Afghanistan, Africa and former Yugoslavia. A
machine-gun toting boy in Rwanda told interviewers he had killed
two enemy soldiers.
<p>
   Some 200,000 children have been recruited to become soldiers or
take an active part in war, according to the report.
<p>
   Former Beirut hostage Terry Waite, who helped launch the report,
said ``the real problem which faces us is how to effectively deal
with the problem where children  &MD;  innocent victims of this warfare
 &MD;  are suffering and suffering daily.''
<p>
   Save The Children, which was founded after World War I to help
young victims of war, now operates in 25 conflict areas providing
counseling for children suffering emotional distress and attempting
to reunite families or find suitable homes for orphaned children.
Other relief agencies also help children of war.
<p>
   But in the long-term, the report said the best way to help
children is to get the international community to work together
``to find political solutions to prevent war'' and to give more
development aid to countries fighting over scarce resources.
<p>
   The report also called on richer countries to stop supplying the
weapons ``which make these wars `against children' possible.''
<p>
   Waite said children are often victims of land mines, which cost
about dlrs 3 apiece and are sometimes disguised as toys. ``I would
call for a ban by treaty on that kind of weapon,'' he said.
<p>
   Without ``preventive diplomacy'' and long-term development in
conflict-prone countries, Aaronson warned, ``we're always going to
be managing crises  &MD;  we're always going to be coming and trying to
do too little, too late.''

Warring Factions in Angola Sign Truce
Eds: UPDATES with UNITA statement from Lisbon, background in grafs
9-11
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  &MD;  In a ray of hope for a bleeding country,
leaders of Angola's rival armies have promised to put down their
guns at 8 p.m. (1900 gmt) Wednesday after 19 years of civil war.
<p>
   In the hours leading up to the deadline, fighting continued
without pause around the northern city of Uige, the last provincial
capital still in rebel hands, according to army spokesmen in
Luanda, Angola's capital.
<p>
   And some commanders in the field contacted by The Associated
Press said they had not even heard about the truce. A nationwide
announcement was expected later in the day on government radio.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka after a
six-hour round of talks, was the first for Angola since May 15,
1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold. Throughout the
war that began on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975,
peace overtures and treaties have repeatedly failed to stop the
fighting.
<p>
   The truce was meant as the first step in disengaging the warring
sides: the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, led by
Jonas Savimbi
<p>
   The opposing delegations resumed meetings Wednesday in Lusaka to
nail down remaining details of the peace accord, scheduled to be
signed Sunday by the two leaders in the presence of U.N. officials
and African heads of state.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire take effect Nov. 22, two days after the
signing.
<p>
   UNITA complained Wednesday the truce it signed Tuesday night in
Lusaka, the Zambian capital, was meaningless without United Nations
monitors checking for compliance. Most of the recent fighting has
been a government offensive that captured key rebel strongholds,
including the central city of Huambo.
<p>
   ``There no guarantee the government, through its generals and
its mercenaries, will order the attacks halted,'' said a UNITA
statement issued in Lisbon, Portugal.
<p>
   U.N. monitors and police would start deploying in Angola only
after the start of the formal cease-fire two days after the signing
of the peace accord Sunday, said U.N. special representative
Alioune Blondin Beye. Once convinced the cease-fire would hold, the
U.N. would send several thousand troops to Angola to provide
security under the peace accord, Beye said.
<p>
   One key issue remaining in the talks prior to Sunday's scheduled
signing was how many security guards and weapons Savimbi would be
allowed to retain under the cease-fire. According to diplomatic
sources, the UNITA leader concerned about the possibility of
assassination.
<p>
   Another issue not fully resolved how to incorporate UNITA forces
into a new unified defense force.
<p>
   But the fine print did not deter Beye and others from declaring
an end to Angola's two decades of conflict.
<p>
   ``There should be no more hostilities in Angolan territory,''
said Beye, who mediated a year of peace talks in Lusaka. ``The
Angolan people have suffered for 20 years. There going to be no
more killing in Angola.''
<p>
   Although the government has been doing well on the battlefield,
it came under international pressure to agree to the truce Tuesday
to ensure that Savimbi would sign the peace pact Sunday.
<p>
   Political dynamics have changed in recent months with Savimbi's
rebels losing virtually all foreign support  &MD;  including that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime  &MD;  and
government victories on the battlefield.
<p>
   The war began as Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975. More than a half-million people have died and millions are
threatened by starvation and disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, aided by mercenaries who include
retired South African army officers, launched a counterattack last
fall.

Government Troops Bogging Down in Logistical Problems

Eds: UPDATES with rebel Muslims crossing back into Bosnia to help
Serbs; CORRECTS day in lead.

<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said
Wednesday that government forces appeared to be bogging down in
logistical problems as they sought to stretch Bosnian Serb lines
before winter sets in.
<p>
   Combat continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia, where
Serbs have retaken territory captured by government troops in
recent weeks, and other hots spots of northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   Front lines appeared to have changed little. But the United
Nations reported that a new element appeared to be shaping up in
the fighting, with 15 to 20 truckloads of rebel Muslim troops
crossing into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia, likely as backup
for the Serb fighters.
<p>
   Government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after topping
rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic in August, sending his supporters
fleeing into Serb-held parts of Croatia. Abdic has Bosnian Serb
support.
<p>
   U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim Spicer in Sarajevo said government
attacks that began late last month may have run their course for
the time being.
<p>
   Such ambitious plans that are not well coordinated may face a
shortage of ammunition and other supplies, he said. ``What we are
seeing now is a general slowing of military activity,'' he said.
<p>
   ``It may resurge, it may not,'' Spicer said.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   They captured hundreds of square kilometers of territory in
northwest Bosnia, and in a coordinated attack with Croat allies,
took the Serb-held town of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government troops still are trying to make gains in those
areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as ``tense
and unstable,'' but there appeared to be little change in the
frontline.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
totally surrounded throughout the 2 1/2-year-old war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Bosnia radio reiterated charges Tuesday that Serbs in Croatia
also were attacking government forces in Bihac.
<p>
   But it said the new government lines were ``steady and
unbreakable.''
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to
Bosnia, to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Berlusconi Wins Another Confidence Vote on Cuts
Eds: UPDATES with vote passing; second confidence vote on more
pensions reforms expected late, not before 2230 gmt

<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Silvio Berlusconi won a key victory
Wednesday in his battle against Italy's huge deficit when the
Chamber of Deputies approved pension cuts put to a confidence vote.
<p>
   The measure, by a vote of 346 to 208, passed with the backing of
conservative coalition's sometimes troublesome ally, the Northern
League, which still wants the government to begin negotiations with
the unions. A second confidence vote Wednesday on more pension
reform was expected late in the evening.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Incensed by both the cuts and the government's resorting to a
confidence vote, union leaders have called out the latest protest
-- a general strike Dec. 2.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's
position as debate began in the Chamber of Deputies, said the
League ''recognized the need for the country to be governed.''
Berlusconi would have to resign if he lost the vote.
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   ``It's a sign of serious arrogance, but also weakness in the
government,'' Massimo D'Alema, leader of the leftist opposition
Democratic Party of the Left, said Tuesday.
<p>
   At the same time, Berlusconi says he wants to meet with the
nationwide labor federations next week. And government officials
met Tuesday night with opposition legislators to hear their request
to slice away the pension cuts from the budget package.
<p>
   On Thursday, tens of thousands of retirees, workers and students
joined marches in Milan, Bologna and other cities to protest cuts.
In Genoa, demonstrators occupied the port city's two main train
stations, delaying rail traffic.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
jelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome. They
were given three hours of live coverage on RAI state television's
third channel, long under left-wing influence and hostile to
Berlusconi.
<p>
   Berlusconi said the government must stick to its plan to send a
message to international financial markets that it was serious
about cutting a dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   The government won a confidence vote in the Chamber Monday
night, 321-131, on a proposed amnesty on illegal construction
expected to bring in dlrs 3.3 billion from back taxes and fines.
<p>
   But things won't be so easy when the budget plan reaches the
Senate. There, the coalition government of the federalist Northern
League, right-wing National Alliance and Berlusconi-formed Forza
Italia (Let's Go, Italy) falls short of a majority.
<p>
   The budget must be passed by Dec. 31.

Ukrainian Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
By LIAM McDOWALL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  In a boost for worldwide nuclear arms
reduction efforts, Ukraine's parliament today approved joining the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The vote, which carried 301-8 with 20 abstentions, followed
months of intense lobbying by the international community,
particularly the United States. It is a significant step in
strengthening ties between the West and Ukraine, the world's
third-largest nuclear power.
<p>
   ``By this action, we have proved our intention to proceed toward
complete nuclear disarmament,'' said Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader
of the main nationalist party Rukh.
<p>
   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and about
1,800 nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   Although Ukraine began dismantling its intercontinental missiles
as part of an agreement with Washington and Moscow, it had
hesitated to ratify the Non-Proliferation Treaty, demanding
security guarantees from Russia and other states.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Hennadi Udovenko said guarantees were received
hours before the vote in a memorandum signed by the United States,
Russia and Britain. A similar guarantee will be issued by France,
he told legislators.
<p>
   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for
Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He said they
included assurances against Ukraine being attacked by either
nuclear or conventional weapons, as well as promises of substantial
financial support from the West.
<p>
   President Leonid Kuchma, elected in July, has staked his
political credibility on steering the treaty through an often
recalcitrant parliament.
<p>
   Kuchma, a former missile plant director, portrayed possession of
the weapons, which Ukraine has no capability to launch, as a major
liability.
<p>
   ``Experts estimate it will cost $10 billion to $30 billion a
year to keep nuclear weapons,'' Kuchma told legislators. ``It means
we have to sell all our possessions to keep them.''
<p>
   Ukraine's accession further commits the former Soviet republic
of 52 million people to nuclear-free status by about the turn of
the century.
<p>
   Washington has strongly backed Kuchma's economic reforms as a
way of encouraging Kiev to go ahead with denuclearization. About
half the $700 million in U.S. aid for Ukraine in 1994 was targeted
at dismantling the nuclear stockpile.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described today's decision as ``a
major step in the post-Cold War order.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will allow the
lifting U.S. export restrictions on high-technology, space and
aeronautic equipment and remove a Russian condition for
implementing the START-1 nuclear weapons reduction treaty.
<p>
   Ukraine's formal signing of the non-proliferation treaty will
take place Dec. 5 or 6 at a meeting of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma said.

Stock Market Opens Mixed
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Stocks were mixed as bonds fluctuated
uncertainly following a benign reading on consumer price inflation.
<p>
   After 30 minutes of trading the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks was up 6.40 points but by 10.30 a.m. EST (1530
GMT) it had turned lower to show a 4.04-point loss at 3822.33 one
hour into the session.
<p>
   Bonds were slightly firmer earlier in the morning but started to
slide at mid-morning. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down about
dlrs 2.50 per dlrs 1,000 face value.
<p>
   Advancing issues led decliners by about 8 to 7 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 37.53 million shares.
<p>
   Broad-market indexes were higher. The NYSE composite index was
up 0.23 at 254.75 in the first 30 minutes. The American Stock
Exchange's market value index was unchanged at 448.61. The Nasdaq
composite was up 1.82 at 770.84.
<p>
   U.S. consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in October as
falling energy prices and moderation in food costs combined to give
the country its best inflation performance in six months.
<p>
   The so-called ``core'' rate of consuemer inflation, minus
volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent.
<p>
   Analysts had expected a 0.2-percent increase in the overall rate
and a 0.3-percent jump in the core rate.
<p>
   The market was settling down after swinging wildly on Tuesday,
following a 0.75-percentage point increase in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve.
<p>
   ``The market is beginnning to calm a bit after yesterday's
volatility,'' said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ``The three-quarter-point
tightening was the maximum acceptable pain threshold for the
market.''
<p>
   Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei index fell 0.4
percent, but in London, the FT-SE 100 was firmer. Frankfurt markets
were closed for a holiday.

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  U.N. officials said

Man Accused of Murdering Wife Blames Sleep Disorder
By ALYSSA GABBAY
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUTLER, Pa. (AP)  &MD;  Can a man kill in his sleep?
<p>
   The question is being debated in court, where Michael Ricksgers
admits he shot his wife to death but claims that the disorder sleep
apnea caused him to do it as he slept.
<p>
   ``It's a little like sleepwalking, or talking in your sleep, in
which you do involuntary things but in a much more exaggerated
form,'' defense attorney Lou Ceraso said in opening statements
Tuesday.
<p>
   Ceraso said Ricksgers, a 37-year-old welder, was unconscious
when he fired the shot that killed his wife, Janet, the morning
after Christmas last year.
<p>
   But Assistant District Attorney David Hepting said Mrs.
Ricksgers had planned to leave her husband after the holiday and
insisted the killing was intentional.
<p>
   ``The timing is just a little too convenient,'' Heptig said.
<p>
   Both sides intend to call experts to testify about sleep apnea,
a disorder that one recent study in the New England Journal of
Medicine found afflicts millions of people. Sleep apnea occurs when
the breathing passages relax so much they squeeze shut, causing a
person's breathing to stop for up to a minute. The sleeper
typically snorts, gasps for air and may engage in abnormal
behavior.
<p>
   A Canadian man who stabbed his mother-in-law to death and
seriously wounded his father-in-law in 1987 was acquitted after
sleep-disorder experts testified the acts occurred during a
sleepwalking episode.
<p>
   Ricksgers told investigators he was awakened by a bang about 2
a.m. and found he was holding the .357-caliber Magnum that his wife
kept under her pillow for protection.
<p>
   A bullet struck his wife in the back and ruptured her aorta, the
main artery that carries blood from the heart. Ricksgers later told
police he thought he might have been dreaming someone was trying to
break into his house.
<p>
   But relatives and co-workers of Mrs. Ricksgers testified that
the couple's marriage was falling apart.
<p>
   When police searched the couple's mobile home, they found a note
in Mrs. Ricksgers' purse telling her husband she was leaving him,
Hepting said. A 1988 receipt for a divorce attorney's retainer also
was found in the purse.

where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government soldiers. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   While government soldiers still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared safe area, in a counter-attack.
<p>
   Fighting continued on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac on
Tuesday. Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as fluid.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, in the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has
been totally surrounded throughout the 31-month war by Serb rebels
in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch airstrikes, has been
under pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket. NATO
has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of violations
involving U.N.-decreed ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel.
<p>
   NATO wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb land into Bosnia.
<p>
   Spicer reported that fighting for high ground around Kupres was
going slowly and that a government offensive to the south around
the city of Mostar appeared to have died out.
<p>
   Fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast, and
on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia. There,
the gong broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in the
fighting.

Heavy Fighting Reported in the Northern Breakaway Republic
Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to say most evacuees taken to town 100
kilometers away.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP)  &MD;  Heavy fighting by rival clans shook the
capital of Somalia's breakaway Somaliland Republic on Wednesday,
forcing the evacuation of foreign aid workers.
<p>
   More than 20 foreign workers for U.N. and private aid groups in
Hargeisa were taken to safety, mostly to Boramo, a town 100
kilometers away, said Yukiko Hadena, spokeswoman in Nairobi for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
<p>
   Hundreds of civilians fled under the fire of mortars,
anti-aircraft guns and small arms.
<p>
   A faction allied with warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid claimed it
had captured the capital, Hargeisa, killing 70 and arresting 200
Somaliland troops, but none of those details could be confirmed.
<p>
   The battle in Hargeisa is the first serious interclan fighting
in northwest Somalia in more than a year. It comes as the United
Nations prepares to withdraw its 16,500 peacekeepers from southern
Somalia and the country's warlords jockey for power in the ensuing
vacuum.
<p>
   The Republic of Somaliland seceeded from the Horn of Africa
nation three years ago but has never been recognized nationally or
internationally. It's president, Mohamed Hagi Egal, last week
invited all of Somalia's faction leaders to attend a reconciliation
conference but vowed not to renounce the secession.
<p>
   The fighting between Egal's troops and militiamen of the Somali
National Movement began Monday, said Movement spokesman Ismail
Mohamed Buubas. Movement chairman Abduraman Ahmed Ali renounced the
secession in April, split with Egal and moved over to the Aidid
camp.
<p>
   Ali is attending a reconciliation conference of Aidid supporters
under way in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and it was suspected
Wednesday that Aidid was behind the attack on Hargeisa.
<p>
   Aidid's conference, aimed at establishing a new government, has
excluded Egal and chief Aidid rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who controls
the northern half of Mogadishu.
<p>
   Aidid controls the southern half of Mogadishu and most of the
rest of southern Somalia. If he were to overthrow the Somaliland
Republic, he would have only to defeat Ali Mahdi for control of the
country.
<p>
   Hargeisa, once a city of 250,000 people, was virtually leveled
in 1988 in bombing ordered by former dictator Mohammed Siad Barre
to quell unrest in northern Somalia.
<p>
   Somaliland seceded right after Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 and
was spared the clan fighting that erupted in Mogadishu and caused
the 1992 famine in which 300,000 pepole died.

Chang Beats Berasategui to Even Record
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Michael Chang bounced back from an
opening-round loss and evened his record at the IBM/ATP Tour World
Championship by crushing Alberto Berasategui 6-1, 6-0 Wednesday.
<p>
   Chang lost to another Spaniard, Sergi Bruguera, Tuesday, but he
had no problems against Berasategui, who has won three games in two
matches so far.
<p>
   He was beaten by Andre Agassi 6-2, 6-0 Tuesday in 45 minutes,
and lost to Chang in 47. Chang is now 1-1 in the round-robin
portion of the tournament.
<p>
   Agassi questioned the ranking system, which allowed Berasategui,
who normally plays only clay-court tournaments, to qualify for the
tour-ending event.
<p>
   Winner of seven clay-court titles this year, Berasategui is No.
7 in the world.
<p>
   In other matches Wednesday, Boris Becker faced Pete Sampras and
Goran Ivanisevic played Stefan Edberg.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Agassi gave a lesson in indoor-surface tennis to
Berasategui, Becker outlasted Ivanisevic 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 after
surviving 26 aces by the hard-hitting Croatian, while Bruguera beat
Chang 7-5, 7-5.
<p>
   The dlrs 3-million event pits the top eight players in the
world, who are split into two round-robin groups. The top two from
each group advance to the semifinals.
<p>
   Becker, who won the tour-ending event in 1992 but failed to
qualify last year, needed one hour, 53 minutes to outlast
Ivanisevic, who double-faulted to give Becker a match point.
<p>
   The German converted it with a volley and received a standing
ovation from the crowd in Frankfurt's Festhalle.
<p>
   ``His serve really started to click in the third set, he was
hitting two aces a game,'' said Becker, who has won a tour-record
13 indoor titles since 1990.
<p>
   ``But he gave me a couple of second serves in the tiebreak. It
was just a question of one point,'' said the German, who is No. 5
in the world.
<p>
   Ivanisevic, No. 4, also lost to Becker in a decisive tiebreak in
the 1992 semifinals here and suggested that Becker was a better
player on big points. The German agreed.
<p>
   ``He has to beat me, I don't give him much,'' said Becker, who
lost to Ivanisevic in the Wimbledon semifinal this summer but holds
a 8-4 career edge over the Croat.
<p>
   Bruguera is the French Open champion and No. 3 in the world,
mainly due to his skill on slow clay. Unlike previous years,
however, he's been enjoying some success indoor as well this
season.
<p>
   ``I've been playing well the last few month. I think I served
well today when it was important,'' Bruguera said.
<p>
   ``Sergi has improved his serve a lot more,'' said Chang, No. 6
in the world who had beaten Bruguera in both of their previous two
encounters.

Business Inventories Up 0.5 Percent
With US-Economy
By JAMES H. RUBIN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  U.S. business inventories rose 0.5 percent in
September, the sixth straight increase but a more moderate advance
than the previous month.
<p>
   The Commerce Department also said Wednesday that sales, which
surged 3.3 percent in August, declined for the first time since
July, dipping 0.2 percent in September.
<p>
   The inventory buildup is larger than many analysts expected and
comes a day after the Federal Reserve raised two key interest rates
by 0.75 percentage points each to slow the economy and head off
inflation.
<p>
   The Commerce Department said inventories totaled a seasonally
adjusted dlrs 907.2 billion, up from dlrs 902.5 billion in August.
<p>
   Inventories climbed 0.9 percent in August, revised down from a
previous 1 percent estimate.
<p>
   Analysts predicted the September increase would be 0.2 percent.
Stockpiles have now risen in eight of the last nine months,
slipping in March by 0.2 percent for their only decline this year.
<p>
   The drop in sales was the first since they fell 0.4 percent in
July. Sales in September were at a seasonally adjusted dlrs 649.9
billion, down from dlrs 651.2 billion.
<p>
   As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.40  &MD;  up from
its historic low of 1.39 in August. That means it would take 1.40
months to exhaust stockpiles at the September sales rate. The ratio
was 1.42 in July.
<p>
   Such ratios are considered positive signs for the economy, with
further growth in sales likely to lead to new orders to replenish
shelves and backlots.
<p>
   While inventories have been accumulating at a rapid pace for
much of the year, they remain at historically low levels and sales
have continued strong.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the government said retail sales in October surged
1.1 percent and are expected to continue the solid advance through
the just-beginning holiday season.
<p>
   Retail inventories rose to dlrs 292.5 billion in September from
dlrs 287.9 billion. Stockpiles at the wholesale level were up to
dlrs 228.4 billion from dlrs 227.6 billion. Manufacturers'
inventories declined to dlrs 386.3 billion from dlrs 387 billion.
<p>
   Business sales in September at the retail level were at dlrs 189
billion, up from dlrs 188 billion. At the wholesale level, they
slipped to dlrs 174.7 billion from dlrs 175.2 billion. Factory
sales were down to dlrs 286.3 billion from dlrs 288.1 billion.

U.S. Bidder Buys Burne-Jones Tapestries
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  An anonymous New York buyer paid a record 842,000
pounds (dlrs 1.34 million) for four antique tapestries showing
episodes from the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail, auctioneers
Christie's said Wednesday.
<p>
   The panels, inspired by Sir Thomas Malory's epic poem ``Le Morte
D'Arthur,'' were designed by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Sir Edward
Burne-Jones and woven in 1890.
<p>
   The woven scenes of Arthur and his knights' epic search for the
Holy Grail fetched more than five times their pre-sale estimate.
<p>
   The works ``represent one of the most remarkable and beautiful
creations of the arts and crafts movement,'' said Nicola Redway,
head of Christie's 20th Century Decorative Arts Department.
<p>
   ``We are very pleased to see them sell to one buyer, which will
ensure they are kept together.''
<p>
   The buyer requested anonymity.
<p>
   Burne-Jones and fellow writer, William Morris, developed a love
for ``Le Morte D'Arthur''  &MD;  which describes events leading to the
death of England's fabled King Arthur  &MD;  while they were
undergraduates at Oxford University in 1855.
<p>
   A larger set of the Quest of the Holy Grail tapestries was
originally designed and woven for Stanmore Hall, a stately home in
north London belonging to Australian mining millionaire William
Knox D'Arcy.
<p>
   Those sold on Wednesday were part of the only other full set in
existence, made for D'Arcy's friend, the businessman George
McCulloch, in 1898.
<p>
   The tapestries are the work of weavers at Merton Abbey in south
London.
<p>
   One of the works, ``The Attainment of the Holy Grail by Sir
Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival,'' fetched a record 331,000
pounds (dlrs 530,000).
<p>
   Another, ``The Arming and Departure of the Knights,'' which
shows Arthur's troops taking leave of their families, sold for
210,000 pounds (dlrs 336,000).
<p>
   ``The Failure of Sir Lancelot,'' showing the famous knight
asleep outside the closed door to the Temple of the Holy Grail,
fetched 139,000 (dlrs 222,000).
<p>
   The legendary King Arthur was probably a Romano-British leader
who fought against the pagan Saxon invaders of the 6th century.
<p>
   The story of the quest for the Holy Grail and the Round Table
for the knights of his court at Camelot was developed in the 12th
century by the nobleman Geoffrey of Monmouth.

New African Export-Import Bank Opens To Encourage Trade
By KHALED DAWOUD
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)  &MD;  African governments and financial
institutions on Wednesday inaugurated the African Export-Import
Bank to try to raise the continent's 2 percent share of world
trade.
<p>
   The bank, which also has private investors, will underwrite
international trade as well as transactions among African nations.
<p>
   Officers said the bank will provide short-term financing to
exporters and importers. It also will fund imports needed for
production by exporting companies.
<p>
   The bank has a capital base of dlrs 750 million and has at its
disposal cash resources of about dlrs 100 million, said Christopher
Edordu, a Nigerian who has been named the bank's first president.
<p>
   The bank, to be headquartered in Cairo, has a total of 127
shareholders, bank officials said.
<p>
   Its African investors include 13 governments, 17 central banks
and 30 other financial institutions. There also are 10 banks or
private investors from Brazil, China, France, India, Europe and the
United States.
<p>
   The African Development Bank, one of the continent's oldest
financial institutions established by African governments, is also
a major shareholders.
<p>
   To meet its goals, the bank will have to overcome endemic
African problems of political instability, high debts and stagnant
exports, officials told the inauguration ceremony.
<p>
   Gidado Idris, chairman of the Bank's shareholders assembly, said
the bank's goals must include increasing inter-African trade, which
today is just 5 percent of the total.
<p>
   ``Africa is in a hurry to develop, and the key to success is
expansion in trade,'' Idris said.
<p>
   Babacar Ndiaya, president of the African Development Bank, urged
the private sector to play a more effective role in promoting
exports.
<p>
   He described the opening of the export-import bank as a ``dream
which has now turned into a reality.''
<p>
   Atef Obeid, the Egyptian minister responsible for the nation's
privatization program, urged more African cooperation, noting that
the European Union and other trade groupings were growing because
they were successful.
<p>
   Edordu said the bank already has started operations with two
syndications in West Africa valued at dlrs 6.5 million and 10.2
million to encourage the export of export of cacao and cotton.
<p>
   A third transaction will soon be completed for South Africa, he
said. The export-import bank plans its first branch office there,
he added.

Malfunction at Troubled Plant
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP)  &MD;  A malfunction in the electrical system of
a safety pump Wednesday hit the trouble-plagued Kozlodui nuclear
plant, but the reactor unit involved was not shut down, state radio
reported.
<p>
   The report said that the pump is part of the reactor's safety
system, but according to plant officials it poses no danger of a
radiation leak.
<p>
   A backup pump had to be switched on, but the 440-megawatt
reactor was not stopped.
<p>
   The unit where the problem occurred is is one of four outdated
pressurized-water reactors without encasement at the Kozlodui
plant. There also are two newer 1,000-megawatt reactors. All six
units are Soviet-designed.
<p>
   The plant normally generates 40 percent of Bulgaria's power
needs, but malfunctions often force technicians to shut down
reactors and curtail electricity supplies.

<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Here are some facts about children caught up in
war from a report by the British relief agency Save The Children
which was released Thursday. All figures refer to the last decade:
    &MD;  More than 1.5 million children have been killed in wars
worldwide.
    &MD;  Ten million children  &MD;  one child in every 200 throughout the
world  &MD;  have been traumatized by the effects of war and need help
to overcome emotional distress.
    &MD;  More than 4 million children have been disabled, maimed,
blinded and brain-damaged.
    &MD;  More than 12 million children have lost their homes.
    &MD;  More than 10 million children are refuges, and more than five
million children have been forced to live in refugee camps.
    &MD;  More than one million children are separated from their
families, including an estimated 100,000 in Rwanda.
    &MD;  One million people have been killed by land mines, many of
them children. Cambodia has 35,000 amputees and Angola has 20,000
amputees, many of them children.

Skiers Oppose Disclaim Document
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MILAN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  World Cup skiers are strongly opposing a
disclaim document prepared by the International Federation and
intended to protect race organizers from legal actions prompted by
the athletes or their relatives.
<p>
   Italian downhill star Peter Runggaldier said Wednesday that
speed skiers from all Alpine teams may boycott the initial races of
the forthcoming season if the Federation does not reconsider its
decision.
<p>
   Earlier this year the companion of Ulrike Maier sued organizers
of the Garmisch downhill race for the fatal spill suffered by the
Austrian skier during a World Cup race in the German resort.
<p>
   German officials have recently renounced the organization of two
downhill races scheduled in Garmisch in January. The men's speed
race was rescheduled in Crans Montana, Switzerland. The women's
downhill was switched to Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy.
<p>
   A spokesman for the Italian ski Federation (FISI) said Wednesday
that men and women skiers of the Italian Alpine team refused to
sign the document.
<p>
   ``We know that skiers of other World Cup teams also did not
sign. The wording of the document is questionable,'' said Claudio
Baldessarri, an Italian Federation official.
<p>
   He said that representatives of national ski federations are
scheduled to meet next week to discuss, and possibly solve, the
dispute.
<p>
   The International federation entrusted national authorities with
the responsibility to have the skiers signing the disclaimer.
<p>
   The 1994-95 World Cup season is scheduled to begin at Park City,
Utah, and Sestriere, Italy, on Nov. 26-27.

After Indiana Crash, French Officials Issue Warning on Planes
Eds: Updates with ATR cancelling ceremony for delivery of new plane
to American Eagle, 7th graf
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  After a crash in Indiana that killed 68 people,
France on Wednesday urged air crews worldwide flying ATR-42 and 72
commuter planes not to fly on automatic pilot during ice build-up
or severe turbulence.
<p>
   France's General Direction of Civil Aviation announced in a
communique that its request ``was imperative while awaiting the
results of the investigation'' into the accident. The U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration issued a similar warning a week ago.
<p>
   The ATR-72 owned by American Eagle crashed into a soybean field
on its way to Chicago's O'Hare Airport while fighting gusts and
rain. Everyone on board died. Initial evidence suggests that ice
built up on the plane's wings, destabilizing it.
<p>
   The French authorities said that the automatic pilot should
immediately be turned off when ``lateral unbalance of the flight
controls are observed'' or during ``abnormal behavior.'' It can be
turned on again once the aircraft's steadies out manually.
<p>
   The 62 companies worldwide flying the aircraft were urged to put
the warnings, to be distributed by ATR in about two weeks, in their
flight manuals.
<p>
   There are 269 ATR-42s in service and 129 larger ATR-72s. Both
are light, twin-turboprops built by Avions de Transport Regional, a
consortium of French and Italian aircraft manufacturers.
<p>
   ATR canceled a ceremony Wednesday at its headquarters in
Toulouse to deliver a previously ordered plane to American Eagle,
saying in a communique it was ``taking the circumstances into
account.''
<p>
   The aviation authorities meanwhile reported that investigation
into the near-crash of an Airbus A310 belonging to Romania's Tarom
airlines with 182 people aboard during a landing approach at Orly
airport in Paris has shown no evidence of mechanical failure.
<p>
   A preliminary report confirmed that the plane's pilot, who
reported that the plane had suddenly gained altitude as he came in,
then went into a dive, had been flying on manual as he claimed.
<p>
   The pilot had complained of technical problems, but the report
said that none had been discovered so far.
<p>
   The full investigation and analysis will continue many months.

International Donors, Impressed By Reforms, Pledge Dlrs 2 Billion

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Vietnam received a resounding vote of confidence
Tuesday from foreign aid donors, winning pledges of dlrs 2 billion
to help it shift to a market economy and ease still-widespread
poverty.
<p>
   The new grants and loans, an addition to dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago, represent an endorsement of economic reforms
that have slashed inflation, trimmed a bloated public sector and
fueled growth rates of 8.1 percent last year and 8.5 percent this
year.
<p>
   ``Vietnam is on the right track,'' said Callisto Madavo, a
director of the World Bank's East Asia department. ``It has the
right vision and it is producing results. It has the potential to
be a real success story.''
<p>
   The aid was promised by Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada,
Singapore and 10 Western European nations during two days of
negotiations sponsored by the World Bank.
<p>
   The United States, which lifted its trade embargo against last
year, participated only as an observer and made no bilateral
pledges.
<p>
   Le Van Chau, deputy director of Vietnam's State Bank, said U.S.
companies still seemed cautious about moving into Vietnam,
apparently awaiting a final decision from Washington on
reestablishing diplomatic relations severed since the Vietnam War.
<p>
   Madavo said Vietnam needs to overcome bureaucratic shortcomings
and other ``teething problems'' in order to handle aid more
efficiently. Less than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago has been disbursed.
<p>
   ``This is the first time Vietnam has received foreign
assistance,'' Chau said. ``We lack a lot of experience.''
<p>
   Vietnam embarked on its reform program in 1989, well before any
foreign aid was assured. It has cut inflation from 67.5 percent in
1991 to 5.2 percent last year, and predicts it can sustain an
annual growth rate of 8 or 9 percent at least through the year
2000.
<p>
   Per capita income is below dlrs 200, and 51 percent of the 72
million people are classified as poor. But Madavo said Vietnamese
officials were realistic in predicting per capita income could
double by the end of the decade.
<p>
   ``Vietnam remains a very poor country, and several strong years
of growth mark the beginning, not the end, of the reform process,''
he said. ``But clearly, Vietnam has, in a short time, earned the
respect of the international community.''
<p>
   Of the aid pledged Tuesday, 80 percent will be provided as loans
and 20 percent as grants.
<p>
   Vietnamese officials said their priorities for 1995 including
further reforms of a public sector already trimmed from 12,000 to
7,000 enterprises, reform of the financial system, further
overtures to foreign investors, and rural development. About 80
percent of the population lives in the countryside.

BC-Sports-Soccer-European Roundup
Wales Suffers Humiliating Blow to Euro Hopes
Eds: will be UPDATED with late games
By JOSEPH WHITE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Wales suffered the most humiliating soccer defeat
in its history Wednesday, losing 5-0 to first-time entrant Georgia
in qualifying for the 1996 European Championship.
<p>
   The loss, coupled with a 3-2 defeat last month in another former
Soviet republic, Moldova, all but closed the door on Welsh hopes
for qualifying for the finals. Though it's still early in the
tournament, Wales must play four of its seven remaining games
against group favorites Germany and Bulgaria.
<p>
   ``The players and myself are ashamed,'' Wales manager Mike Smith
said. ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum
up a game like that? They were far better than us.''
<p>
   In numerical terms, it was Wales' biggest defeat since a 6-1
loss to France in 1953. Georgia, which is playing in the Europeans
for the first time since gaining independence, scored its first
goals and earned its first points in the competition. The team
previously lost to Moldova and Bulgaria.
<p>
   Although Smith could not call upon Manchester United winger Ryan
Giggs, who missed the game through injury, his strikeforce had
another United star, Mark Hughes, as well as Liverpool's Ian Rush
and Dean Saunders of Aston Villa, some of Europe's most feared
strikers.
<p>
   But it was the Welsh defense that was repeatedly torn apart by
Georgia's swift forwards. Temoliz Ketsbaia netted twice, and other
goals came from Georgi Kinkladze, Gocha Gogrichiani and Shota
Arveladze in front of the joyous 25,000 fans at Dynamo Stadium in
Tbilisi.
<p>
   Also in Group 7, Germany opened its qualifying campaign with a
2-1 victory over Albania in front of a sellout crowd of 23,000 in
Tirana. Strikers Juergen Klinsmann and Ulf Kirsten scored for
Germany, which has never lost to the Balkan country in nine
meetings.
<p>
   Hysen Zmijani netted for Albania, and Ledio Pano nearly tied it
in the dying seconds when his free kick hit the post. The Albanians
have lost both their qualifying matches.
<p>
   The top two teams in the group, Moldova and Bulgaria, played
later Wednesday.
<p>
   Thirty other teams were also in action later Wednesday in the
eight qualifying groups. Defending champion Denmark visited Spain,
while World Cup finalist Italy hosted Croatia in the headline
matches. In an exhibition game, England hosted Nigeria at Wembley.

Report: Rockefeller Group Lacks Cash for Rockefeller Center
Mortgage
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  The Japanese-controlled owner of Rockefeller
Center is short on cash to pay its mortgage and may be close to
defaulting on its loan, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The Times cited government filings by the investment trust that
holds the dlrs 1.3 billion mortgage on the property.
<p>
   The center's owner is The Rockefeller Group, which is 80 percent
owned by Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co., one of the world's largest
real estate companies. The Rockefeller family owns 20 percent.
<p>
   Its sale to the Rockefeller Group in 1989 was one of the most
prominent Japanese investments in the United States.
<p>
   Rockefeller Center has 12 landmark buildings housing NBC
television and Radio City Music Hall among others. Its outdoor ice
rink is a major tourist attraction.
<p>
   Heirs to John D. Rockefeller Jr. sold a controlling interest in
the property to the Mitsubishi Estate just before the real estate
market in New York City collapsed and office vacancies surged.
<p>
   If Mitsubishi Estate defaults, ownership of Rockefeller Center
goes to the mortgage holder, a real estate investment trust called
Rockefeller Center Properties, which was set up to finance the
mortgage via stocks and bonds.
<p>
   Mitsubishi Estate could also try to renegotiate the mortgage to
reduce the principal amount it owes.
<p>
   Calls to Rockefeller Center Properties and Rockefeller Group
were not immediately returned Wednesday.
<p>
   It said Masaaki Kono of the Mitsubishi Estate said in Tokyo,
``Rockefeller Group is in charge and it is not appropriate for us
to comment now.''
<p>
   The Times said Mitsubishi Estate has been forced to subsidize
its share of the dlrs 460 million gap between Rockefeller Center's
rental income and its mortgage payments during the last nine years.
<p>
   In quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on Monday, The Times said, Rockefeller Center Properties said the
Rockefeller Group's ``cash shortfalls raise substantial doubt about
the borrower's ability to continue as a going concern.''
<p>
   The paper said Rockefeller Center lost dlrs 39 million in the
first nine months of this year, about the same amount it lost last
year.
<p>
   It said Rockefeller Center is worth between dlrs 900 million and
dlrs 1.15 billion, less than its mortgage.

Cowboy's Battling as Smith Struggles to Regain Form
By DENNE H. FREEMAN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   IRVING, Texas (AP)  &MD;  The Dallas Cowboys found out last year what
it's like to play without Emmitt Smith. They lost the first two
games as Smith battled owner Jerry Jones in a contract dispute.
<p>
   Smith was quickly signed by Jones after the 0-2 start, and the
Cowboys went on to win the Super Bowl.
<p>
   This season, Smith's production is down, proving the Cowboys are
vulnerable in their bid to win an unprecedented three consecutive
Super Bowls.
<p>
   Smith's average per carry has dropped from last year's 5.3 to
4.0. Opponents also are doing a better job against him on pass
defense, cutting his gain per catch from 7.3 yards to 5.6.
<p>
   Coach Barry Switzer is worried.
<p>
   ``We're a rushing football team and we've got to be able to
run,'' Switzer said. ``Everything comes off the run. You've got to
run the football to have success in the passing game. We can't be
in second-and-8 or third-and-8 all day. We've got to get it down
where it's third down and 5 yards or less.''
<p>
   Smith gained only 78 yards rushing in a 21-14 loss to the San
Francisco 49ers on Sunday. Dallas is 32-2 when Smith gains at least
100 yards rushing.
<p>
   His last nine carries netted him only 10 yards. In the third
quarter, Smith lost one yard on three carries with the Cowboys'
best play, the lead draw.
<p>
   Against the 49ers, Dallas faced third-and-5 or more 11 times.
San Francisco had good luck guessing when the Cowboys were going to
run to the 49ers' right.
<p>
   ``San Francisco played pretty good run defense,'' Switzer said.
``They did a good job of stopping us in the second half.''
<p>
   There are several factors at play in the Cowboys declining rush
yardage. Dallas lost its best offensive lineman, Erik Williams, to
a knee injury suffered in a car accident. Most of the other linemen
are nursing injuries.
<p>
   Smith has been playing hurt with a nagging hamstring injury and
sore shoulders.
<p>
   ``Emmitt hasn't been at his full, 100-percent potential this
year,'' Switzer said. ``His shoulder bothers him and that concerns
me. We need to get him into battering-ram shape for the last half
of the season.''
<p>
   There is no competent backup to Smith to rest him. Lincoln
Coleman has proved ineffective and worries coaches with his
fumbles. Derrick Lassic was injured in training camp.
<p>
   Switzer said Lassic hadn't progressed much in his
rehabilitation.
<p>
   ``We don't think he'll return this season,'' Switzer said.
<p>
   The Washington Redskins, who have trouble stopping the run,
appear to be coming along on the Dallas schedule just in time.
<p>
   Smith has averaged 5.1 yards and scored nine touchdowns in eight
games against the Redskins. He's had five 100-yard days and has
caught 25 passes for 111 yards against them.
<p>
   Smith, seeking a fourth consecutive rushing title, has 989 yards
and is second behind Detroit's Barry Sanders, who has 1,319 yards.
Smith is the NFL leader in touchdowns with 13.
<p>
   ``We've got to get our running game cranking,'' Switzer said.
``We win when we can run.''

Executive Testified in Industrial Diamond Price-Fixing Trial
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  &MD;  A GE Superabrasives executive has
testified he was concerned that obtaining a price list from rival
industrial diamond maker De Beers would create the impression the
two companies were trying to coordinate a price increase.
<p>
   Steven Palovchik, testifying Tuesday in U.S. District Court
under immunity from prosecution, also said he worried that Peter
Frenz, a GE Superabrasives salesman, was passing information about
GE's planned price increase to De Beers through a Belgian
businessman.
<p>
   Palovchik raised the issue after Frenz sent Palovchik a price
list showing a planned increase for De Beers' industrial diamonds.
<p>
   ``In a general sense, without making specific allegations
because I had no proof, I asked him if he was doing anything wrong,
and told him that if he was, that a price increase wasn't worth
it,'' said Palovchik, who was international sales manager for the
Worthington-based GE company at the time. ``His answer was that he
was not.''
<p>
   Palovchik, GE's general manager of industrial products,
testified in a criminal price-fixing trial against General
Electric, the parent company of Superabrasives. GE and De Beers are
accused of violating antitrust laws by conspiring to increase the
prices of industrial diamonds worldwide.
<p>
   The companies control at least 80 percent of the world market in
the tiny, mostly synthetic stones that are used in oil drilling and
industrial cutting and polishing tools.
<p>
   GE is the only defendant on trial but the indictment also listed
De Beers, Frenz and Belgian businessman Phillipe Liotier. They are
not on trial because officials have been unable to serve them with
warrants.
<p>
   Palovchik said GE decided independently to raise prices on
top-grade diamonds in the summer of 1991. On Dec. 16, however,
before the price increase was announced, he received the
information from Frenz, with a letter that read, in part:
<p>
   ``Liotier ... informs me about planned price increases of De
Beers early in 1992. ... Liotier is supporting a price increase and
would like to know by Dec. 18'' whether GE Superabrasives would
follow.
<p>
   Liotier was managing director of Diamant Boart, a diamond tool
manufacturer in Belgium. The company, a customer of De Beers and
GE, is owned by another Belgian company with ownership ties to De
Beers.
<p>
   Palovchik said it is common for GE to get information about
competitors from its customers, but the timing and Frenz's request
for a quick response were ``highly unusual.''

U.S. Bidder Buys Burne-Jones Tapestries
Eds: Clarifies in grafs 8, 9 that there are six tapestries in each
of the two full sets in existence
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  An anonymous New York buyer paid a record 842,000
pounds (dlrs 1.34 million) for four antique tapestries showing
episodes from the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail, auctioneers
Christie's said Wednesday.
<p>
   The panels, inspired by Sir Thomas Malory's epic poem ``Le Morte
D'Arthur,'' were designed by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Sir Edward
Burne-Jones and woven in 1890.
<p>
   The woven scenes of Arthur and his knights' epic search for the
Holy Grail fetched more than five times their pre-sale estimate.
<p>
   The works ``represent one of the most remarkable and beautiful
creations of the arts and crafts movement,'' said Nicola Redway,
head of Christie's 20th Century Decorative Arts Department.
<p>
   ``We are very pleased to see them sell to one buyer, which will
ensure they are kept together.''
<p>
   The buyer requested anonymity.
<p>
   Burne-Jones and fellow writer, William Morris, developed a love
for ``Le Morte D'Arthur''  &MD;  which describes events leading to the
death of England's fabled King Arthur  &MD;  while they were
undergraduates at Oxford University in 1855.
<p>
   Six Quest of the Holy Grail tapestries were originally designed
and woven for Stanmore Hall, a stately home in north London
belonging to Australian mining millionaire William Knox D'Arcy.
<p>
   The four sold on Wednesday were part of the only other full set
in existence, made for D'Arcy's friend, the businessman George
McCulloch, in 1898.
<p>
   The tapestries are the work of weavers at Merton Abbey in south
London.
<p>
   One of the works, ``The Attainment of the Holy Grail by Sir
Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival,'' fetched a record 331,000
pounds (dlrs 530,000).
<p>
   Another, ``The Arming and Departure of the Knights,'' which
shows Arthur's troops taking leave of their families, sold for
210,000 pounds (dlrs 336,000).
<p>
   ``The Failure of Sir Lancelot,'' showing the famous knight
asleep outside the closed door to the Temple of the Holy Grail,
fetched 139,000 (dlrs 222,000).
<p>
   The legendary King Arthur was probably a Romano-British leader
who fought against the pagan Saxon invaders of the 6th century.
<p>
   The story of the quest for the Holy Grail and the Round Table
for the knights of his court at Camelot was developed in the 12th
century by the nobleman Geoffrey of Monmouth.

BC-Children At War
Report: Children More Likely To Be Killed In War Than Soldiers
Eds: CORRECTS nationality of child in video in graf 7
With BC-Children-Facts

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Children are more likely to be killed in wars than
soldiers, according to a report Thursday by the British relief
agency Save The Children.
<p>
   In the past decade, more than 1.5 million children met violent
deaths and 4 million sustained permanent injuries as a result of
bombs, bullets, land mines, chemical weapons and even machete
attacks, it said.
<p>
   The 25-page report, ``Children at War,'' documents how the
rights of children, supposedly guaranteed by a U.N. convention
which has been ratified by 162 countries, are continually being
undermined by an increasing number of conflicts around the world.
<p>
   ``The new world order has proved to be a world of disorder for
civilians  &MD;  and particularly children,'' said Mike Aaronson, Save
The Children's overseas director.
<p>
   ``Nine out of 10 casualties of war are civilians,'' he said.
``Children are very often the main casualties  &MD;  and they are indeed
much more likely to be casualties of war than are soldiers.''
<p>
   According to the report, 10 million children  &MD;  one child in
every 200 worldwide  &MD;  have been traumatized by the effects of war,
12 million children have lost their homes and 5 million have been
forced to live in refugee camps in the last decade.
<p>
   A video released with the report showed chilling scenes of
children who had been burned, maimed, orphaned and traumatized in
civil wars in Afghanistan, Africa and former Yugoslavia. A
machine-gun toting boy in Liberia told interviewers he had killed
two enemy soldiers.
<p>
   Some 200,000 children have been recruited to become soldiers or
take an active part in war, according to the report.
<p>
   Former Beirut hostage Terry Waite, who helped launch the report,
said ``the real problem which faces us is how to effectively deal
with the problem where children  &MD;  innocent victims of this warfare
 &MD;  are suffering and suffering daily.''
<p>
   Save The Children, which was founded after World War I to help
young victims of war, now operates in 25 conflict areas providing
counseling for children suffering emotional distress and attempting
to reunite families or find suitable homes for orphaned children.
Other relief agencies also help children of war.
<p>
   But in the long-term, the report said the best way to help
children is to get the international community to work together
``to find political solutions to prevent war'' and to give more
development aid to countries fighting over scarce resources.
<p>
   The report also called on richer countries to stop supplying the
weapons ``which make these wars `against children' possible.''
<p>
   Waite said children are often victims of land mines, which cost
about dlrs 3 apiece and are sometimes disguised as toys. ``I would
call for a ban by treaty on that kind of weapon,'' he said.
<p>
   Without ``preventive diplomacy'' and long-term development in
conflict-prone countries, Aaronson warned, ``we're always going to
be managing crises  &MD;  we're always going to be coming and trying to
do too little, too late.''

Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent  &MD;  Best Inflation Report in Months
EDs: UPDATES with with reports on real earnings and business sales
and market reaction
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
AP Economics Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  U.S. consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent
in October as falling energy prices and moderation in food costs
combined to give the country its best inflation performance in six
months.
<p>
   The small increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, was
better than expected. Many analysts had been forecasting that
October's increase would match a 0.2 percent September gain.
<p>
   In other economic news Wednesday, the government said that
Americans' weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation increased
1.5 percent in October, the biggest monthly gain in more than 12
years. The advance reflected increases in average hourly earnings
and the number of hours worked.
<p>
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said that business
inventories were up 0.5 percent in September, the sixth straight
advance, but business sales fell during the month, declining by 0.2
percent after a big surge in August.
<p>
   Financial markets rallied initially on the good inflation news
but then receded. The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than
5 points in early trading and then retreated to show a 4-poijt
loss. A rally in bond prices sent the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond down below 8 percent for a brief period of time.
<p>
   Wednesday's CPI report was certain to provide ammunition to
critics of the Federal Reserve who contend that the central bank is
engaged in monetary overkill, boosting interest rates even though
there is no evidence of escalating inflation.
<p>
   The latest Fed rate increase occurred Tuesday when the central
bank boosted two key rates by three-quarters of a point. It was the
biggest increase in the Fed's discount rate, the interest it
charges on bank loans, since May 1981.
<p>
   Major banks immediately followed suit by pushing their prime
rate up by a similar three-quarters of a point to 8.5 percent,
meaning that borrowing costs will be rising for millions of
Americans.
<p>
   So far this year, inflation at the consumer level is rising at
an annual rate of 2.6 percent, even better than last year's 2.7
percent increase. Critics contend that the central bank has no
business slowing the economy and running the risk of a recession in
the face of such an outstanding inflation performance.
<p>
   But the Fed and its supporters contend that the economy is
growing too rapidly at this stage of the economic expansion and
must be slowed or there is a great risk the economy will overheat
and force even sharper rate hikes next year.
<p>
   ``The Fed would say that the low inflation increases show that
its policy is working,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``This report shows that inflation
continues to be tomorrow's problem, not today's.''
<p>
   The government announced in Wednesday's report that it was
changing the way it calculated some key components of the inflation
report  &MD;  housing costs, food and drug prices.
<p>
   The changes, which will take effect at the start of next year,
are being made to meet complaints that the CPI was overstating
inflation. The government has estimated the impact of these changes
could shave about 0.1 percentage point off the annual inflation
rate.
<p>
   For October, energy prices fell by 0.7 percent, matching a
similar September decline as gasoline pump prices dropped 1.1
percent, home heating oil costs were down 2.3 percent and natural
gas prices dropped 1.2 percent.
<p>
   Food costs were unchanged in October, the best showing since a
0.3 percent decline last February.
<p>
   Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, inflation was
docile as well. The so-called core inflation rate rose just 0.2
percent in October, the same as September.
<p>
   The Fed's rate increase Tuesday was the sixth this year and came
despite the fact that critics staged a protest rally outside the
Fed as policy-makers were meeting. The increase was attacked by
Democratic members of Congress.
<p>
   But the Clinton administration refrained from criticizing the
Fed's actions, with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen saying that
the ``administration and the Federal Reserve share a common goal of
steady growth with low inflation.''

WBC Calls Boycott to Protest State's Immigrant Measure
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEXICO CITY (AP)  &MD;  The World Boxing Council is boycotting all
world title fights in California for four months to protest the
recently approved state initiative that would bar public aid to
illegal immigrants.
<p>
   The boycott will be in effect from Nov. 22 through March 30, WBC
president Jose Sulaiman said.
<p>
   In making his announcement Tuesday, Sulaiman also said any
Mexican boxer who fights in California during that period will be
barred from WBC matches for two years. Mexican immigrants are
expected to be hurt most by Proposition 187, which will bar illegal
immigrants from state health, education and other social services.
<p>
   The WBC is based in Mexico City.
<p>
   ``The boycott is against the governor of California, for
promoting a racist and inhumane law,'' not against the people of
California, said Sulaiman. He complained that children will be
those who suffer most.
<p>
   He said 35 boxing commissions in Mexico were joining the
boycott, including those in Mexico City, Tamaulipas, Ciudad Juarez,
Tijuana, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Merida.
<p>
   This is the second time the WBC has taken such action. It
earlier boycotted South Africa to protest apartheid.

International Donors, Impressed By Reforms, Pledge Dlrs 2 Billion

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Vietnam received a resounding vote of confidence
Wednesday from foreign aid donors, winning pledges of dlrs 2
billion to help it shift to a market economy and ease
still-widespread poverty.
<p>
   The new grants and loans, an addition to dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago, represent an endorsement of economic reforms
that have slashed inflation, trimmed a bloated public sector and
fueled growth rates of 8.1 percent last year and 8.5 percent this
year.
<p>
   ``Vietnam is on the right track,'' said Callisto Madavo, a
director of the World Bank's East Asia department. ``It has the
right vision and it is producing results. It has the potential to
be a real success story.''
<p>
   The aid was promised by Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada,
Singapore and 10 Western European nations during two days of
negotiations sponsored by the World Bank.
<p>
   The United States, which lifted its trade embargo against last
year, participated only as an observer and made no bilateral
pledges.
<p>
   Le Van Chau, deputy director of Vietnam's State Bank, said U.S.
companies still seemed cautious about moving into Vietnam,
apparently awaiting a final decision from Washington on
reestablishing diplomatic relations severed since the Vietnam War.
<p>
   Madavo said Vietnam needs to overcome bureaucratic shortcomings
and other ``teething problems'' in order to handle aid more
efficiently. Less than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago has been disbursed.
<p>
   ``This is the first time Vietnam has received foreign
assistance,'' Chau said. ``We lack a lot of experience.''
<p>
   Vietnam embarked on its reform program in 1989, well before any
foreign aid was assured. It has cut inflation from 67.5 percent in
1991 to 5.2 percent last year, and predicts it can sustain an
annual growth rate of 8 or 9 percent at least through the year
2000.
<p>
   Per capita income is below dlrs 200, and 51 percent of the 72
million people are classified as poor. But Madavo said Vietnamese
officials were realistic in predicting per capita income could
double by the end of the decade.
<p>
   ``Vietnam remains a very poor country, and several strong years
of growth mark the beginning, not the end, of the reform process,''
he said. ``But clearly, Vietnam has, in a short time, earned the
respect of the international community.''
<p>
   Of the aid pledged Wednesday, 80 percent will be provided as
loans and 20 percent as grants.
<p>
   Vietnamese officials said their priorities for 1995 including
further reforms of a public sector already trimmed from 12,000 to
7,000 enterprises, reform of the financial system, further
overtures to foreign investors, and rural development. About 80
percent of the population lives in the countryside.

Police Arrest Suspect In Ax Murder of Orthodox Priest
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Investigators have arrested a suspect in the 1990
ax murder of a prominent Russian Orthodox priest, officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Alexander Menn, a writer who was persecuted for his evangelical
activities, was bludgeoned to death with an ax while on his way to
church in September 1990.
<p>
   Russia's Interior Ministry will not release any more details on
the suspect until after further investigation, ministry spokesman
Alexander Tatsitov said Wednesday.
<p>
   The renewed interest in the case was prompted by a recent string
of high-profile slayings which have refocused attention on the
country's growing crime problems.
<p>
   President Boris Yeltsin last week ordered the Interior Ministry
to investigate several prominent unsolved murders, including
Menn's.
<p>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had demanded a strict
and thorough investigation at the time of the murder. The case has
remained unsolved for over four years, however, Tatsitov said.
<p>
   Menn's murder has been surrounded by controversy. Several people
 &MD;  including Menn's brother, who is also a priest  &MD;  blamed the KGB
for the killing.
<p>
   In Soviet times, Menn had been detained by authorities for
questioning on several occasions for his religious activities, but
was never held for long periods.
<p>
   In 1988, with the easing of restrictions on religious activites,
Menn was one of the first priests to be invited to visit schools
and talk to children about the church.

Former Beauty Queen Goes on Trial for Attempted Murder of Romantic
Rival

<p>
   LEWISBURG, W.Va. (AP)  &MD;  Tracy Lippard, a statuesque blonde from
Virginia, crowned her successor as Miss Williamsburg and sang two
songs on stage. Then, with pistol, butcher knife and lighter fluid,
the beauty queen drove 250 miles (400 kms) on an alleged mission to
snuff out her romantic rival.
<p>
   The attempt in February was foiled by her target's father, a
former Secret Service agent who put her in a headlock and wrestled
her to the ground, police said.
<p>
   Lippard, a 23-year-old dentist's daughter with a dazzling smile,
went on trial Wednesday on attempted murder and weapons charges.
<p>
   ``I guess she was going to kill us all and burn the house
down,'' said Rodney Weikle, the father of Lippard's rival, Melissa
Scott.
<p>
   Defense attorney Paul Detch says Lippard is innocent. He refused
to elaborate and declined to allow Lippard to be interviewed.
<p>
   Lippard smiled at reporters but said nothing as she and a female
companion arrived at the courthouse this morning for the start of
jury selection.
<p>
   Lippard, a Miss Virginia runner-up in 1993, faces up to 39 years
in prison if convicted on all charges.
<p>
   At the time of the attack, Mrs. Scott, 24, was eight months
pregnant by a man Lippard had dated. Mrs. Scott and the boyfriend,
Todd Scott, 26, married in August.
<p>
   On the night of Feb. 26, wearing a black sequin dress with her
hair swept to one side, the 6-foot (1.83-meter tall) Lippard sang
the pageant theme song, Whitney Houston's ``I'm Every Woman.''
<p>
   ``She was in a very good mood that whole weekend,'' Kristen
Dutton, entry chairman for the pageant, told The Washington Post.
<p>
   Early the following morning, Lippard left Williamsburg, near her
hometown of Newport News, Va., for Lewisburg, where Mrs. Scott
lived with her parents.
<p>
   Along the way to West Virginia, police said, Lippard switched
license plates on her red Toyota, putting on stolen New York tags
after she received a ticket in Virginia for going 80 mph (135 kph)
in a 65 mph (106 kph) zone.
<p>
   Lippard, ``wearing a blazer and looking collegiately dressed,''
knocked on the door of the Weikle home, saying her car had broken
down, Greenbrier County Prosecutor Richard Lorensen said. Weikle
told her where a nearby service station was, but she declined the
help and said she would try to get the car started, Lorensen said.
<p>
   Lorensen said she returned to the door several minutes later in
an overcoat, concealing a 9mm pistol allegedly stolen from a
friend, a knife and a hammer.
<p>
   Lippard asked to use the telephone and Weikle offered her a
glass of water while they waited for the phone to be free, Lorensen
said. Weikle led Lippard into the kitchen, where she pulled out the
hammer and struck him twice in the head, the prosecutor said.
<p>
   ``Although I hadn't been in that situation for 20 years, it
didn't take me long to react,'' said Weikle, 51, who teaches high
school math and coaches baseball. ``I twirled her around and put
her in a headlock.''
<p>
   Weikle's wife, Carlynn, then walked into the kitchen as Lippard
pulled a gun from her coat pocket, Weikle said.
<p>
   ``I got my hand on the gun to turn it away from where my wife
was and took her down on the ground with one arm on her neck and
one hand on the gun,'' Weikle said. ``My wife got the other hand
and we held her on the ground.''
<p>
   Police who arrested Lippard found lighter fluid, matches and the
knife with her. They also found a list of questions in her car that
she apparently prepared to ask Scott: ``Are you in love with
Melissa? How long did you date her? If she were not pregnant, would
you still be thinking of her?''
<p>
   Scott said he met Lippard in November 1993 in Newport News,
where she had studied political science at Christopher Newport
University, and dated her just two or three times.
<p>
   Lorensen, however, said Scott was a ``Don Juan'' and Lippard his
``weekend girlfriend.'' Lippard and Scott had a ``blow-up
argument'' 11 days before the attack, Lorensen said.
<p>
   Scott, a construction worker, said he dated Mrs. Scott before
meeting Lippard and found out soon after he started seeing Lippard
that Mrs. Scott was five months pregnant.
<p>
   ``She knew the facts,'' Scott said of Lippard. ``I talked about
the baby all the time.''
<p>
   The Scotts and their 7-month-old daughter live with the Weikles
in Lewisburg.
<p>
   Lippard, who is free on bond, is charged with three counts of
attempted murder, carrying concealed weapons, malicious wounding
and other offenses.

Balladur Urges Shorter Presidential Term, Anti-Corruption Reforms
Eds: Updates with Balladur comments to National Assembly, Pasqua
accusations against Delors, grafs 10,14
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Sounding like the candidate that he technically
isn't, Premier Edouard Balladur on Wednesday proposed shortening
France's presidential term and urged a moratorium on business
contributions to political campaigns for three years.
<p>
   Balladur, who has refused to declare his candidacy for next
spring's presidential elections until January, wrote what amounted
to a campaign platform in a front-page essay in the center-left
daily Le Monde.
<p>
   The article enabled Balladur to take up the challenge by his
right-wing rival for the presidency, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac,
and ``debate ideas'' without actually getting on the stump and
looking like a candidate.
<p>
   Responding to public disenchantment with France's renewable
seven-year presidential mandates, Balladur proposed cutting the
term to five years or limiting it to a one-off seven years.
<p>
   President Francois Mitterrand proposed such reforms when he was
Socialist opposition leader, but never implemented them after his
election in 1981.
<p>
   Two days after his third Cabinet minister was forced to resign
in a corruption scandal, Balladur proposed changes in the way
French justice operates and political parties do business.
<p>
   The most drastic would be a three-year experiment barring
businesses from contributing to political parties. He also proposed
capping campaign costs and requiring financial disclosures.
<p>
   Payoffs to parties in exchange for public works contracts have
been the major source of corruption scandals that brought down the
Socialists in 1993 and are now chipping at Balladur's popularity.
<p>
   Balladur also offered a radical overhaul of the judicial system.
But such reforms risk looking self-serving at a time ordinary
Frenchmen view most of their politicians as corrupt.
<p>
   For example, Balladur suggested doing away with preventative
detention for first-time suspects. Former communications minister
Alain Carignon, forced to resign over a corruption scandal, is
currently locked up to prevent evidence tampering before he goes to
trial.
<p>
   Taking questions from the National Assembly later Wednesday,
Balladur said that he favored a new anti-corruption law in the near
future and would not reshuffle his cabinet based on ``new rumors.''
<p>
   Chirac has been gaining ground on Balladur on the right since
declaring his candidacy two weeks ago.
<p>
   On the left, polls show the undeclared, unchallenged
front-runner, Jacques Delors, president of the European Union's
executive commission, easily beating Chirac and neck-and-neck with
Balladur.
<p>
   The right's hard-nosed interior minister, Charles Pasqua,
accused Delors in a retort to a Socialist lawmaker Wednesday of
``using European funds for his campaign.''
<p>
   Pasqua offered no proof. He was responding to a query on how
much a lavish Balladur reception for 1,000 mayors had cost.
<p>
   Beaten his last two tries, former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing told Europe-1 radio that he'd decide in February whether
he'll run, based on whether his experience could help the country.
<p>
   Giscard d'Estaing, 68, lost to Mitterrand in 1981 after one
term. He fared worse in 1988, losing the right's mantle to Chirac.
<p>
   The two-round elections will be held April 23 and May 7.

<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Vietnam received a resounding vote of confidence
Wednesday from foreign aid donors, winning pledges of dlrs 2
billion to help it shift to a market economy and ease
still-widespread poverty.
<p>
   The new grants and loans, an addition to dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago, represent an endorsement of economic reforms
that have slashed inflation, trimmed a bloated public sector and
fueled growth rates of 8.1 percent last year and 8.5 percent this
year.
<p>
   ``Vietnam is on the right track,'' said Callisto Madavo, a
director of the World Bank's East Asia department. ``It has the
right vision and it is producing results. It has the potential to
be a real success story.''
<p>
   The aid was promised by Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada,
Singapore and 10 Western European nations during two days of
negotiations sponsored by the World Bank. Japan was the largest
donor, but no breakdown was given.
<p>
   The United States, which lifted its trade embargo against
Vietnam early this year, participated only as an observer and made
no bilateral pledges.
<p>
   Le Van Chau, deputy director of Vietnam's State Bank, said U.S.
companies still seemed cautious about moving into Vietnam,
apparently awaiting a final decision from Washington on
reestablishing diplomatic relations severed since the Vietnam War.
<p>
   Madavo said Vietnam needs to overcome bureaucratic shortcomings
and other ``teething problems'' in order to handle aid more
efficiently. Less than dlrs 400 million of the dlrs 1.8 billion
pledged a year ago has been disbursed.
<p>
   ``This is the first time Vietnam has received foreign
assistance,'' Chau said. ``We lack a lot of experience.''
<p>
   Vietnam embarked on its reform program in 1989, well before any
foreign aid was assured. It has cut inflation from 67.5 percent in
1991 to 5.2 percent last year, and predicts it can sustain an
annual growth rate of 8 or 9 percent at least through the year
2000.
<p>
   Per capita income is below dlrs 200, and 51 percent of the 72
million people are classified as poor. But Madavo said Vietnamese
officials were realistic in predicting per capita income could
double by the end of the decade.
<p>
   ``Vietnam remains a very poor country, and several strong years
of growth mark the beginning, not the end, of the reform process,''
he said. ``But clearly, Vietnam has, in a short time, earned the
respect of the international community.''
<p>
   Of the aid pledged Wednesday, 80 percent will be provided as
loans and 20 percent as grants.
<p>
   Vietnamese officials said their priorities for 1995 including
further reforms of a public sector already trimmed from 12,000 to
7,000 enterprises, reform of the financial system, further
overtures to foreign investors, and rural development. About 80
percent of the population lives in the countryside.

   U.S. Virgin Islands Broadcast News Summary
<p>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP)  &MD;  Construction of a
twenty-million dollar condominium project at Lindqvist Beach should
start by September 1995, the Virgin Islands Daily News says today.
<p>
   The seven-point-five acres of land are owned by French actress
Leslie Caron and her brother, Aimery Caron. German investors have
also contributed to European Vacation Villas.
<p>
   The Coastal Zone Management Commission approved the plans for
seventy-five beachfront villas, a bar, a restaurant, and a swimming
pool on Tuesday.
<p>
   The resort will be on St. Thomas' East End.
<p>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP)  &MD;  Kittians living in
St. Thomas say they are concerned about their homeland's growing
drug trade.
<p>
   The Virgin Islands Daily News says today that many Kittians said
the drug problems of that former British colony in the Caribbean
are caused by outsiders.
<p>
   Simon Rawlins says the news about the recent drug-related deaths
of Vincent Morris and Joan Walsh and Friday's riot and fire at Her
Majesty's Prison will hurt tourism.
<p>
   Morris is the son of former Deputy Prime Minister Sidney Morris,
who resigned Tuesday. His other two sons, Dean and Dave Morris,
were arrested for drugs and weapons charges in connection with the
deaths of their brother and his girlfriend. They were released on
bail.
<p>
   Thousands of Kittians live in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
<p>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP)  &MD;  Noted calypsonian
Chalkdust will hold a Calypso workshop Wednesday from 7 p-m to 9
p-m at the University of the Virgin Islands cafeteria.
<p>
   He also will discuss the impact of Calypso and Reggae on
Caribbean societies at a noon luncheon Thursday at the school's St.
Thomas campus.
<p>
   Virgin Islands culturist Hectitio Francis will also speak on the
same topic.
<p>
   Chalkdust, a Trinidadian whose real name is Hollis Liverpool,
will also perform Friday night at a student variety show called De
Hardest.
<p>
   The 8 p-m event honors the student, usually a male freshman,
with the highest opinion of himself.

<p>
   In Soviet times, Menn had been detained by authorities for
questioning on several occasions for his religious activities, but
was never held for long periods.
<p>
   In 1988, with the easing of restrictions on religious activites,
Menn was one of the first priests to be invited to visit schools
and talk to children about the church.

Journalists Charge Newsprint Shortage Politically Motivated
Eds: UPDATES with businessman offering to finance imports of
newsprint.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  &MD;  Journalists from a wide range of
newspapers warned Wednesday they would soon be unable to publish
because of a paper shortage they charged was politically motivated.
<p>
   The dispute reflected persistent animosities between the
government, which is unaccustomed to criticism, and the free press
which often blurs the distinction between fact and fancy.
<p>
   Journalists from 16 publications signed a petition to the
government demanding that it reduce prohibitive import taxes on
paper or force the only factory producing newsprint to cut exports.
They warned paper supplies would run out in three days.
<p>
   ``This is an offensive by the government against the free
press,'' sai Ion Cristoiu, editor of Romania's best-selling daily
Evenimentul Zilei. He said dwindling supplies had forced the paper
to reduce its print run by half to 150,000.
<p>
   However, Virgil Mireanu, commercial director at the state-run
paper factory in Bacau in northeastern Romania, said newspapers
were short of paper because they had failed to pay their debts.
<p>
   At a later news conference, Romania's wealthiest businessman,
Viorel Catarama, offered to finance the import of newsprint to
``help save the independent press.''
<p>
   Both houses of parliament have given preliminary approval to
draft legislation that would send journalists to jail for ``insult,
calumny or threatening a public official.''
<p>
   The speaker of the lower chamber of deputies, Adrian Nastase,
earlier this week accused the free press of practicing ``the law of
the jungle and inventing information.'' President Ion Iliescu is
known for his disdain of Romania's sometimes scurrilous press.

EU Economics Chief Announces New Rail Projects
By ELIZABETH D. WISE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  Two rail projects have been added to
an ambitious European Union plan to upgrade transportation links
among the dozen nations, the EU's economics chief said Wednesday.
<p>
   Henning Christophersen said the additions were a high-speed
railway linking the Scottish city of Glasgow with southern England,
and another linking Ireland with continental Europe via the tunnel
beneath the English Channel.
<p>
   Fourteen projects have now been given high priority by the EU's
executive agency for financing as part of a massive public works
scheme designed to create 15 million new jobs by the end of the
decade.
<p>
   Christophersen said he hoped the dozen EU leaders would approve
blueprints for the projects when they meet at a summit in the
German town of Essen Dec. 8-9.
<p>
   The leaders endorsed plans for 11 road and rail links during a
June summit in Corfu, Greece. The accompanying price tag was set at
75 billion European currency units (dlrs 94 billion).
<p>
   Christophersen did not have an estimate for the total cost of
the 14 projects.
<p>
   Last week, he announced a rail and highway triangle that would
link Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark.
Sweden and Norway are expected to join the EU Jan. 1.
<p>
   Christophersen, attending a meeting of the EU assembly in
Strasbourg, said financing plans have been worked out for ``a
majority'' of the projects.
<p>
   But another official, demanding anonymity, said some governments
have asked the EU for 2 billion Ecus (dlrs 2.5 billion) to help
finance three of the projects.
<p>
   Finance ministers meeting in Brussels last week made little
progress in agreeing on ways to fund the projects. Some ministers
dismissed appeals by the EU executive agency, the European
Commission, for more money.
<p>
   Christophersen also wants EU leaders to approve a host of other
projects, including rail and road links to Eastern Europe and
Russia; energy distribution plans; and a common European air
traffic control system to replace the nations' 55 different,
outdated schemes.

Georgia Crushes Wales 5-0 in European Championship
EDS: Adds lineups, quotes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP)  &MD;  Georgia romped to a 5-0 crushing of
Wales in a European Championship qualifying game Wednesday, handing
the Welsh their most humiliating defeat ever.
<p>
   Georgia gained its first goals and points in the competition and
piled more misery on a Welsh team that also lost to Moldova last
month.
<p>
   ``The players and myself are ashamed,'' Welsh manager Mike Smith
said.
<p>
   ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum up a
game like that? They were far better than us.
<p>
   ``I thought we would be able to come here and get a win but we
just could not cope with their speed and attacking ability,'' Smith
said.
<p>
   Temoliz Ketsbaia netted twice and more goals came from Georgi
Kinkladze, Gocha Gogrichiani and Shota Arveladze as the Georgians
played some sparkling soccer to over-run the Welsh.
<p>
   Although Wales could not call opon Manchester United winger Ryan
Giggs, who missed the game through injury, its strikeforce had
another United star, Mark Hughes, as well as Liverpool's Ian Rush
and Dean Saunders of Aston Villa, some of Europe's most feared
strikers.
<p>
   But it was the Welsh defense that was repeatedly torn apart by
Georgia's swift forwards. After surviving a half hour of pressure
from the home team, Wales conceded two goals in nine minutes before
half time.
<p>
   Ketsbaia fired the first in the 30th minute and Kinkladze slid
home the second in the 39th.
<p>
   Ketsbaia hit the third soon after the halftime break with a
curling shot past veteran Welsh goalkeeper Neville Southall and
Gogrichiani hit the fourth into an empty net soon after hitting the
post.
<p>
   Arveladze scored the fifth goal in the 66th minute as the Welsh
fell to their worst defeat since losing 6-1 to a strong French team
in 1953.
<p>
   The result means that both teams have three points from three
games but now Georgia is above Wales in the standings because of a
better goals differential.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Georgia  &MD;  Dimitar Devadze, Zaza Revichvili, Kahaber Tskhadadze,
Murtaz Chelia, Georgi Chikhradze, Kahaber Gogichaichvili, Georgi
Nemsadze, Gocha Gogrichiani, Temoliz Ketsbaia, Georgi Kinkladze,
Shota Arveladze.
<p>
   Wales  &MD;  Neville Southall, Alan Neilson, Mark Bowen, Andy
Melville, Chris Coleman, David Phillips, Barry Horne, Dean
Saunders, Ian Rush, Mark Hughes, Gary Speed.

Report: Chinese Swimming Tests Positive For Steroids
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHICAGO (AP)  &MD;  A Chinese swimming world champion tested positive
for steroids and several teammates have shown traces of the drug,
the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The paper, quoting anonymous sources, said Yang Aihua, the world
champion in the women's 400-meter freestyle, was found with
steroids in her system during random testing before last month's
Asian Games.
<p>
   It said the ratio of Yang's testosterone, a male hormone, was 50
percent higher than the level required for a man to record a
positive test.
<p>
   The Tribune also said that several of Yang's teammates who were
tested at the same time showed traces of a variety of steroids in
their urine samples but it was uncertain if these resulted from
doping or natural body production.
<p>
   FINA, the international swimming federation, has not announced
Yang's test results for ``political reasons,'' the Tribune quoted
sources as saying. That appeared to be a reference to statements
last month by International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch that he was sure Chinese swimmers were drug-free.
<p>
   At FINA's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, secretary
Gunnar Werner would say only that random tests had been conucted on
about 29 athletes at the Asian Games but ``we don't have the final
results yet.'' He said they were expected ``any day now'' and would
be announced ``as soon as it is official.''
<p>
   Drug tests usually take 4-5 days to complete and analyze. The
Asian Games ended a month ago.
<p>
   The Chinese swimming program has been dogged by rumors of drug
use since it started rolling up gold medals and world records in
1988. In recent years, Chinese women have dominated the sport, and
at the last world championships in Rome in September Yang and her
teammates won 12 of 16 titles and set five world records.
<p>
   The rout was so thorough that coaches and team directors from
the United States and 17 other nations signed a petition asking
FINA to tighten doping controls.
<p>
   Chinese coaches and officials have steadfastly denied using
illegal drugs in their programs, saying the astounding results have
been produced by innovative training in a group of top athletes
plucked from a population of more than one billion people.
<p>
   But Yang would be the fifth Chinese woman swimmer to flunk a
FINA drug test in the past two years  &MD;  matching the total of
swimmers from other countries that have been found positive in
doping tests by the federation in the last 22 years.
<p>
   Yang also would be the fourth Chinese woman to test positive for
steroids, which help build muscle bulk and allow the body to
rebound faster from workouts and injury.
<p>
   The Tribune said the level of testosterone related to
epitestosterone in Yang's body was 9-1. For a man to test positive,
the ratio must be 6-1.
<p>
   If Yang is declared positive for steroids, she would be
suspended for two years, knocking her out of the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta.

Berlusconi Wins Another Confidence Vote on Cuts
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Berlusconi quotes, combines previous,
corrects day of week to Wednesday for latest protest, changes
byline
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Silvio Berlusconi won a key victory
Wednesday in his battle against Italy's huge deficit when the
Chamber of Deputies approved pension cuts put to a confidence vote.
<p>
   The measure, by a vote of 346 to 208 with one abstension, passed
with the backing of conservative coalition's sometimes troublesome
ally, the Northern League. The League still wants the government to
begin negotiations with unions which have vowed to keep up strikes
unless Berlusconi backs down.
<p>
   A second confidence vote Wednesday on additional pension
measures was expected late in the evening in the Chamber, where the
coalition has a solid majority.
<p>
   But Berlusconi will face a tougher time in the Senate when the
upper chamber gets its crack at the entire austerity package to
deal with the dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   There, the coalition of the Northern League, the right-wing
National Alliance and Berlusconi's Forza Italia party falls just
short of a majority.
<p>
   On Wednesday, tens of thousands of retirees, workers and
students joined marches in Milan, Bologna and other cities to
protest cuts. In Genoa, demonstrators occupied the port city's two
main train stations, delaying rail traffic.
<p>
   Incensed by both the cuts and the government's resorting to a
confidence vote, union leaders have called a general strike Dec. 2,
the second in six weeks.
<p>
   With the Senate battle looming, some Northern League leaders had
suggested that the government go ahead with the rest of its budget
proposal while separating pension reform so the government could
reconsider how to revamp pensions together with the unions.
<p>
   But Berlusconi, shortly before Wednesday's first vote, scoffed
at that suggestion.
<p>
   ``Separating pensions from the economic measures would make us
lose credibility abroad and make us look ridiculous,'' Berlusconi
told reporters. He suggested that if he lost his budget battle, he
would have ''no choice but to go back to the voters.''
<p>
   Berlusconi would have to resign in any case if he lost a
confidence vote.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's support
before the vote, said the League ``recognized the need for the
country to be governed.''
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
jelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome.
<p>
   The budget must be passed by Dec. 31.

Election Results Delayed Until Friday
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP)  &MD;  Mozambique's National Elections
Commission was still struggling Wednesday to compile results from
last month's election.
<p>
   The commission released provisional results after counting more
than 95 percent of the ballots cast in the Oct. 27-29 election, but
said a final count would not be available before Friday.
<p>
   The provisional results show President Joaquim Chissano and his
ruling Mozambique Liberation Front, known as FRELIMO, leading in
the presidential and parliamentary races.
<p>
   Under electoral law, the commission should have released final
results Tuesday. Instead, it issued a statement saying it had been
delayed by the need to review more than 500,000 spoiled ballots and
allegations of irregularities.
<p>
   The entire counting process had been delayed by problems getting
ballots to commission headquarters in Maputo from more than 7,000
polling stations. Roads and telecommunications are poor, and recent
bad weather further slowed transportation of the ballots.
<p>
   The process was also bogged down in allegations of
irregularities and fraud.
<p>
   Final results were unlikely to differ substantially from the
latest provisional count, which gave Chissano 55 percent of the
vote in the presidential race, and FRELIMO 46 percent of the vote
in the separate parliamentary race.
<p>
   Former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama was second in the
presidential race with 33 percent of the vote. His Mozambique
National Resistance, known as RENAMO, had 37 percent of the vote in
the parliamentary race.
<p>
   The Democratic Union, a rightist opposition, hovered around 5
percent, the threshold needed for representation in the 250-seat
parliament.
<p>
   The vote came two years after FRELIMO and RENAMO signed a treaty
ending 15 years of civil war. The war, which broke out soon after
independence from Portugal in 1975, killed 600,000 people and left
the southeast African nation dependent on foreign money for most of
its budget.

Becker Beats Sampras, Chang Routs Berasategui
Eds: UPDATES with Becker's victory over Sampras
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Boris Becker beat No. 1 Pete Sampras
7-5, 7-5 Wednesday and raised his record at the IBM/ATP Tour World
Championship to 2-0.
<p>
   Becker needed one hour, 43 minutes to beat Sampras for the
second time in three weeks. He also beat the American en route to
winning the Stockholm Open the last week of October.
<p>
   The German broke Sampras for decisive 6-5 leads in each set and
never dropped his own serve. Sampras is now 0-1.
<p>
   Becker hit two aces in the last game with second serves, the
last one giving him three match points. He missed the first serve
but clinched the match when Sampras returned his second serve to
the net.
<p>
   Earlier, Michael Chang bounced back from an opening-round loss
and evened his record at 1-1 by crushing Alberto Berasategui 6-1,
6-0.
<p>
   In the last match of the day, Goran Ivanisevic played Stefan
Edberg.
<p>
   Becker, No. 5 in the world, became the first player to notch two
victories. Because of the round-robin format, none of the losers
have yet been eliminated.
<p>
   The dlrs 3-million event pits the top eight players in the
world, who are split into two round-robin groups. The top two from
each group advance to the semifinals.
<p>
   Chang lost to another Spaniard, Sergi Bruguera, Tuesday, but he
had no problems against Berasategui, who has won three games in two
matches so far.
<p>
   He was beaten by Andre Agassi 6-2, 6-0 Tuesday in 45 minutes,
and lost to Chang in 47. Chang is now 1-1 in the round-robin
portion of the tournament.
<p>
   Berasategui blamed a wrist injury for his poor performance.
``Maybe Michael would have beaten me, but I don't think it would
have been 6-1, 6-0,'' he said.
<p>
   Agassi questioned the ranking system, which allowed Berasategui,
who normally plays only clay-court tournaments, to qualify for the
tour-ending event.
<p>
   Winner of seven clay-court titles this year, Berasategui is No.
7 in the world.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Agassi gave a lesson in indoor-surface tennis to
Berasategui, Becker outlasted Ivanisevic 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 after
surviving 26 aces by the hard-hitting Croatian, while Bruguera beat
Chang 7-5, 7-5.
<p>
   Becker, who won the tour-ending event in 1992 but failed to
qualify last year, needed one hour, 53 minutes to outlast
Ivanisevic, who double-faulted to give Becker a match point.
<p>
   The German converted it with a volley and received a standing
ovation from the crowd in Frankfurt's Festhalle.
<p>
   ``His serve really started to click in the third set, he was
hitting two aces a game,'' said Becker, who has won a tour-record
13 indoor titles since 1990.
<p>
   ``But he gave me a couple of second serves in the tiebreak. It
was just a question of one point,'' said the German, who is No. 5
in the world.
<p>
   Ivanisevic, No. 4, also lost to Becker in a decisive tiebreak in
the 1992 semifinals here and suggested that Becker was a better
player on big points. The German agreed.
<p>
   ``He has to beat me, I don't give him much,'' said Becker, who
lost to Ivanisevic in the Wimbledon semifinal this summer but holds
a 8-4 career edge over the Croat.
<p>
   Bruguera is the French Open champion and No. 3 in the world,
mainly due to his skill on slow clay. Unlike previous years,
however, he's been enjoying some success indoor as well this
season.
<p>
   ``I've been playing well the last few month. I think I served
well today when it was important,'' Bruguera said.
<p>
   ``Sergi has improved his serve a lot more,'' said Chang, No. 6
in the world who had beaten Bruguera in both of their previous two
encounters.

Exxon Inks Deal With Indonesia Worth Up To dlrs 40 Billion
Eds: UPDATES thruout with additional detail.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   IRVING, Texas (AP)  &MD;  Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has struck a
deal with the government of Indonesia for the two to spend some
dlrs 40 billion to develop the Natuna natural gas field in the
South China Sea.
<p>
   The agreement signed in Jakarta between Exxon affiliate Esso
Exploration and Production Natuna Inc. and Indonesia's national oil
company, Pertamina, calls for the two to be 50-50 partners in the
project.
<p>
   Pertamina, the world's largest seller of liquefied natural gas,
will market the product in the Far East, with support from Exxon,
the project operator. Fritz Voigt, vice president-gas for Exxon Co.
International, said the company expects primary markets to be
Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
<p>
   Once the two obtain market agreements, it will be about eight
years to startup, Voigt said.
<p>
   Exxon also said the project will be developed in stages over
years, to keep pace with market demand. When demand is high enough,
the project could require 18 offshore platforms and more than 200
production wells.
<p>
   The Natuna field has enough reserves to produce about 2 billion
cubic feet of gas each day for more than 30 years, the company
said.
<p>
   ``Development of Natuna, the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon
resource in southeast Asia and one of the largest in the world,
symbolizes the growth of the Asian energy market ...,'' Exxon
chairman Lee Raymond said in a statement from Jakarta, where he
attended the signing ceremony.
<p>
   Natuna is located 800 miles (1300 kilometers) north of Jakarta
in 470 feet (140 meters) of water. The remoteness and deep water
mean the project will be complex, with platforms reaching 60
stories above the sea floor.
<p>
   Planning and negotiations have been under way for many years to
develop the field, which was discovered in 1973.
<p>
   ``The most significant issue in every negotiation of this kind
is the division of revenue,'' Voigt said.
<p>
   He would not comment on the profit split between Exxon and
Pertamina, or on rumors about which companies will become involved
in the project later, although he said, ``I know that our technical
people have had contacts in industry.''
<p>
   ``Really the marketing stage has to go along first before any
call for bids could happen,'' Voigt said.
<p>
   Exxon's minimum level of investment likely would be around dlrs
6 billion, he said.

Bettman Says Time Running Out to Save NHL Season
Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday's comments, edits to conform
By JIMMY GOLEN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TORONTO (AP)  &MD;  National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman
said Wednesday that layoffs in the league office shouldn't be taken
as a sign that he has given up hope of saving the hockey season.
<p>
   ``I'm not going to be in a position where we cancel the season
in mid-December and have to give people 24 hours notice,'' he said.
``If we get going and people can be brought back, we will do it.''
<p>
   Fifteen to 20 members of the league staff were laid off on
Tuesday, with everyone else, Bettman included, taking a 10 percent
pay cut. The commissioner, who is believed to make dlrs 1 million,
would take a dlrs 100,000 hit.
<p>
   Bettman said he will meet with union chief Bob Goodenow on
Thursday. He would not say where, except that it is not New York.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, league vice president Brian Burke said he
expects another round of double-digit game cancellations later in
the week. Officially, the league has cut 14 games from each team's
schedule.
<p>
   Speaking after the induction ceremonies for the Hockey Hall of
Fame on Tuesday night, Bettman said hockey owners likely will
cancel the season if they can't reach a labor agreement in time to
salvage a 50-game schedule.
<p>
   There has been speculation among team officials that
mid-December might be the date, but Bettman's comments were the
strongest statement yet from the league.
<p>
   Still, he refused to set an absolute deadline.
<p>
   ``Obviously, the time is coming short. We're not there yet, but
it's coming,'' he said. ``We wouldn't like to have a season with
less than 50 games. And we'd like to have one with more.
<p>
   ``What's clear,'' he added today, ``is that if we're not playing
in January there's not going to be a season. As we approach
December, the stakes will rise Bettman met with the league's
general managers earlier Tuesday to update them on negotiations to
end hockey's longest work stoppage, which has lasted through 46
days and 253 games. Officially, the league has cut 14 games from
each teams' schedule. More cuts are expected soon.
<p>
   At that time, The Canadian Press reported, the league will
present a counter-proposal focusing on rookie pay and salary
arbitration, but will not address the focal issue of a payroll tax.
<p>
   Goodenow, who was also at the induction ceremony, would not say
whether he was expecting a response to the proposal that owners
rejected last week.
<p>
   ``It only took two seconds to discuss their offer,'' Buffalo
Sabres coach and general manager John Muckler said. He said there
was no movement from ownership during the GM's meeting.
<p>
   ``We will do everything possible to work out a settlement,''
Muckler said. ``The ownership and management is very strong. I
guess the players association will tell you the same thing.''

BC-US-Tourist Murder, 1st Ld-Writethru,0575
Informant Testifies in British Tourist Slaying
Eds: UPDATES with Wednesday testimony.
By ADAM YEOMANS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MONTICELLO, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A key state witness testified Wednesday
that a teen-ager admitted he was involved in the slaying of a
British tourist last year at a North Florida highway rest stop.
<p>
   ``I asked him if he knew anything about it. He laughed and said
yes,'' said Thaddeus Crumitie, a distant cousin of the defendant,
17-year-old John ``Billy Joe'' Crumitie, and an informant for the
state.
<p>
   John Crumitie and three other teen-agers were charged in the
Sept. 14, 1993, slaying of 34-year-old Gary Colley in a case that
damaged Florida's tourism business and spurred major reforms in the
state's juvenile justice system.
<p>
   Thaddeus Crumitie, 19, said he gave his cousin and two other
teen-agers accused in the killing a ride the same night that Colley
was slain at a rest stop on Interstate 10 near Monticello. Colley's
longtime companion, Margaret Jagger, was wounded.
<p>
   The witness testified that the three youths said they were
``going on a mission'' to steal a car and commit an armed robbery.
Thaddeus Crumitie said he asked his cousin about the killing the
next day, when talk of the crime filled the low-income housing
project where they lived.
<p>
   ``He said he shot the lady. Aundra (Akins) shot the man,''
Thaddeus Crumitie testified.
<p>
   Prosecutors don't have any physical evidence linking John
Crumitie with the stolen car or the murder. They are relying on the
testimony of informants and a co-defendant to make their case.
<p>
   Two of the defendants have pleaded guilty to lesser charges and
are awaiting sentencing. Crumitie and Akins, 15, are charged with
first-degree murder and attempted murder.
<p>
   John Crumitie's lawyer, Dwight Wells, questioned the credibility
of his client's cousin and other informants because they had cut
their own deals with authorities for unrelated crimes they had
committed.
<p>
   Thaddeus Crumitie is serving a four-year prison term for robbery
<p>
   `I was afraid if he got in trouble, I would get in trouble for
giving him a ride,'' said Thaddeus Crumitie.
<p>
   Jagger testified Tuesday that said she and Colley were napping
in their rental car at a rest stop when they were startled by a
tapping on the window.
<p>
   Two men, brandishing handguns, were standing on either side of
the car, shouting at the British couple.
<p>
   When Colley tried to back up the car to flee, the gunmen opened
fire, killing Colley and wounding Jagger.
<p>
   Jagger, 36, said the couple were on vacation from their home in
West Yorkshire, England, and were driving from New Orleans to St.
Petersburg.
<p>
   After the shots were fired, the assailants fled, she said. She
tried to prop up Colley to help him breathe but knew it was too
late.
<p>
   Jagger acknowledged she hadn't been able to identify Crumitie in
police lineups, but she has identified Akins. Akins' trial date has
not been set.
<p>
   Donald Spivey, 36, an attendant at the highway rest stop,
testified Tuesday and identified Crumitie as being at the rest
area.
<p>
   Crumitie faces a life sentence with a mandatory 25 years without
parole if convicted of the murder charge.
<p>
   Colley's murder prompted lawmakers to post 24-hour guards at
interstate highway rest stops and beef up the state's juvenile
justice system. Colley was the ninth foreign visitor killed in
Florida within a year.

IOC Chief Begins South African Visit
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch arrived Wednesday for a three-day
visit to Cape Town, the South African city bidding to host the 2004
Games.
<p>
   Samaranch had promised a visit when he was unable to attend the
May 10 inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the first black president,
and his trip was officially unrelated to the Cape Town bid.
<p>
   But Samaranch is known to want an African nation to host the
Games for the first time, and organizers in Cape Town believe he
favors South Africa.
<p>
   They cited the end of apartheid in the nation's first all-race
election in April and Mandela's personal stature as a former
political prisoner turned world statesman as reasons.
<p>
   ``It's like the phoenix rising from the ashes of apartheid,''
said businessman Raymond Ackerman, co-chairman of the group leading
the Olympic bidding effort. ``I think we'll ignite the flame a
little bit stronger than Sydney or London or Paris would because of
these symbolic reasons.''
<p>
   South African Olympic officials chose Cape Town as the city to
bid for the Games after a fierce competition with Johannesburg and
Durban, the other two major urban areas in the country.
<p>
   Ackerman acknowledged South Africa lacked the infrastructure,
competitiveness and experience of other potential host countries,
which he blamed on years of international isolation because of
apartheid.
<p>
   In particular, he cited Cape Town's lack of a strong public
transport network and lodging as key shortcomings. A task force to
study the transportation problem has been appointed, he noted.
<p>
   The major mode of public transportation in the mountain city on
the southwest coast is the minibus taxi, used mostly by
impoverished blacks who travel from their settlments to work in the
city. Turf wars between rival operators have included almost daily
shootings and attacks on the taxi vans.
<p>
   Ackerman said more hotels would be built in upcoming years to
deal with a certain increase in tourism after apartheid, and that
universities and schools in the area would close during the
Olympics to allow the use of their buildings for housing.
<p>
   In addition, 27 ocean liners would dock at Cape Town harbor to
serve as temporary housing in an idea borrowed from the 1992
Barcelona Games, he said.
<p>
   Organizers expect about 30 percent of the sports and lodging
facilities to be in place by 1997, when the IOC will choose the
host for the 2004 Games.

EU Divided Over Telecoms Deregulation Timetable
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  &MD;  European Union nations are deeply
divided over a proposed timetable for deregulating
telecommunication networks, diplomats and EU officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   The dispute is expected to dominate a meeting Thursday of
telecommunication ministers from the 12 EU nations.
<p>
   Failure to resolve the quarrel could prompt the EU's executive
body, the European Commission, to use its monopoly-busting powers
to force open networks, said the officials who asked to remain
anonymous.
<p>
   EU nations decided last year that ordinary telephone calls
should be exposed to free competition before Jan. 1, 1998. But they
did not agree a timetable for ending state monopolies in other
services such as data transmission, mobile communications and
corporate phone networks.
<p>
   As an interim step, the EU commission last month proposed
allowing companies operating television cables, railway telephone
lines and other ``alternative'' network to supply a restricted
number of telecom services from next year.
<p>
   Only France, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands were backing
the commission proposal, the officials said.
<p>
   They said Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, who were given
an extra five years until 2003 to open up telephone calls to full
competition, are seeking similar delays in opening up other
services.

EU Economics Chief Announces New Rail Projects
By ELIZABETH D. WISE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRASBOURG, France (AP)  &MD;  Two rail projects have been added to
an ambitious European Union plan to upgrade transportation links
among the dozen nations, the EU's economics chief said Wednesday.
<p>
   Henning Christophersen said the additions were a high-speed
railway linking the Scottish city of Glasgow with southern England,
and another linking Ireland with continental Europe via the tunnel
beneath the English Channel.
<p>
   Fourteen projects have now been given high priority by the EU's
executive agency for financing as part of a massive public works
scheme designed to create 15 million new jobs by the end of the
decade.
<p>
   Christophersen said he hoped the dozen EU leaders would approve
blueprints for the projects when they meet at a summit in the
German town of Essen Dec. 8-9.
<p>
   The leaders endorsed plans for 11 road and rail links during a
June summit in Corfu, Greece. The accompanying price tag was set at
75 billion European currency units (dlrs 94 billion).
<p>
   Christophersen did not have an estimate for the total cost of
the 14 projects.
<p>
   Last week, he announced a rail and highway triangle that would
link Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark.
Sweden and Norway are expected to join the EU Jan. 1.
<p>
   Christophersen, attending a meeting of the EU assembly in
Strasbourg, said financing plans have been worked out for ``a
majority'' of the projects.
<p>
   But another official, demanding anonymity, said some governments
have asked the EU for 2 billion Ecus (dlrs 2.5 billion) to help
finance three of the projects.
<p>
   Finance ministers meeting in Brussels last week made little
progress in agreeing on ways to fund the projects. Some ministers
dismissed appeals by the EU executive agency, the European
Commission, for more money.
<p>
   Christophersen also wants EU leaders to approve a host of other
projects, including rail and road links to Eastern Europe and
Russia; energy distribution plans; and a common European air
traffic control system to replace the nations' 55 different,
outdated schemes.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian government forces,
trying to solidify battlefield gains before winter sets in, appear
to be running out of ammunition and other supplies, a U.N. official
said today.
<p>
   Fighting continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia,
where Serbs have retaken territory captured by Muslim-led
government troops in recent weeks, and in other flashpoints in
northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   Front lines appeared to have changed little. U.N. spokesman Lt.
Col. Tim Spicer said government attacks that began late last month
may have run their course for now. Lack of coordination may have
resulted in temporary shortages of ammunition and other supplies,
he said.
<p>
   ``What we are seeing now is a general slowing of military
activity,'' he said from Sarajevo. ``It may resurge, it may not.''
<p>
   Cold and snow limit military movements during winter, fast
approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government troops apparently are
trying to spread Serb forces thin, capturing positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   The major powers trying to negotiate an end to Bosnia's civil
war, meanwhile, will meet early next month to try to overcome
differences and restart stalled peace efforts.
<p>
   The United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany drafted a
peace plan that the Bosnian Serbs rejected last summer. Since then,
the five nations have divided over how to proceed, but their
foreign ministers will try to revive the peace process in talks
Dec. 2-3 in Brussels, said Hans van den Broek, the European Union
foreign affairs chief.
<p>
   Government forces captured hundreds of square miles of territory
in northwest Bosnia late last month and, in a coordinated attack
with Croat allies two weeks ago, took the Serb-held town of Kupres,
60 miles northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres and in northeast Bosnia,
where a platoon of 30 to 40 Bosnian Serbs apparently is trapped by
government troops. Battles also were reported around an important
road leading to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   But while government troops still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared ``safe area,'' in a counterattack.
<p>
   The United Nations reported today that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwest Bosnia from Croatia,
apparently to back up Serb fighters.
<p>
   The rebels had gone to Serb-held parts of Croatia after
government soldiers toppled their leader, Fikret Abdic, in August
and took control of the Bihac area. Abdic has Serb support.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
surrounded throughout the 2{-year-old war by Serb rebels in Bosnia
and neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Bosnia radio reiterated Tuesday charges that Serbs in Croatia
also were attacking government forces in Bihac. But it said the new
government lines were ``steady and unbreakable.''
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch air strikes in
retaliation for attacks on the U.N. ``safe area,'' has been under
pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket.
<p>
   NATO has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of
violations of ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel. The
alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb territory into Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.
<p>
   The major powers involved in negotiating an end to Bosnia's
civil war will meet early next month to try to overcome their
differences and relaunch stalled peace efforts, European officials
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Foreign ministers from the so-called Contact Group  &MD;  the United
States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany  &MD;  will hold talks Dec.
2-3 in Brussels, said Hans van den Broek, foreign affairs chief of
the European Union.
<p>
   The five powers drafted a peace plan that the Bosnian Serbs
rejected last summer. Since then, splits have emerged within the
Contact Group over how best to find peace.

Prime Minister Promises Disclosures Which May Save Government
EDS:UPDATES with Reynolds says he has no new information. Session
resumption delayed to 1730 gmt
By ROBERT BARR
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  Fighting for the life of his government
on a confidence vote, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds on Wednesday
hinted at new disclosures on ``a very serious matter.''
<p>
   But he returned to the house Wednesday afternoon to say that no
new information had been found.
<p>
   Debate on a confidence motion was again postponed with the
future of Reynolds' 2-year-old government still in the balance.
<p>
   Reynolds earlier told Parliament, ``I will have that
information, but I haven't got it to lead off this debate.''
Parliament then adjourned until later in the afternoon.
<p>
   News reports suggested the government may have some new
disclosures regarding the appointment of the former attorney
general, Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. That is
the issue which has fractured the coalition between Reynolds'
Fianna Fail party and the Labor Party led by Deputy Prime Minister
Dick Spring.
<p>
   Opposition leaders were furious at rumors that the two parties
were nearing a deal to keep the government in office.
<p>
   ``It seems to me we are dealing with one of the most sleazy
events in Irish political history,'' said Proinsias de Rossa,
leader of the small Democratic Left party.
<p>
   John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party,
said he was in position to lead off the debate because ``it is
clear that the (prime minister) is going to make quite a bizarre
speech.''
<p>
   Reynolds had said the new information would be in response to a
query from the Fine Gael party's chief whip, Enda Kenny. Kenny
asked Reynolds how he could have assured the House on Tuesday that
there had been no outside pressure in handling the case of the Rev.
Brendan Smyth, a Catholic priest wanted for child sexual abuse in
Northern Ireland.
<p>
   The government had appeared doomed on Tuesday after Labor
lawmakers said they had not been satisfied with Reynolds'
explanation of why the attorney general's office had taken no
action on the request for seven months.
<p>
   Reynolds promised a shakeup of the attorney general's office but
he said Whelehan was not personally guilty of any wrongdoing. Labor
walked out of the Cabinet on Friday when Reynolds forced the
appointment through, and Whelehan was sworn in on Tuesday.
<p>
   Reynolds had feared he could lose a vote of no confidence in his
government Wednesday.
<p>
   It was not clear how the vote would be affected by his latest
statement to the Dail.
<p>
   The prime minister has staked his defense in part on the budding
peace process in Northern Ireland, following the Irish Republican
Army cease-fire 10 weeks ago. He praised Spring for his
contribution as foreign minister.
<p>
   Reynolds told the Dail Tuesday: ``It will be a great pity if a
government that is achieving rapid economic progress, that has
achieved the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in over 25
years, and that has a fine legislative program, should be placed in
jeopardy over misunderstandings surrounding a single judicial
appointment.''
<p>
   Sinn Fein, the party allied to the IRA, has urged Spring and
Reynolds to resolve their differences. But Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel (cq) McLaughlin said Tuesday the party was prepared to work
with any party in government.
<p>
   ``The peace process is in no danger from a change of
government,'' said Mary Harney, leader of the small Progressive
Democratic party. She said all parties were committed to promoting
peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
<p>
   Reynolds said Tuesday he regretted any offense caused by
Whelehan's appointment but said it was ``inadvertent.'
<p>
   Bruton said he believed Reynolds deliberately snubbed Labor.

Aristide Reportedly Will Resign His Priesthood
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with no official response from
Vatican, some saying it would be unusual to force a priest to quit,
ADDS background, details.
By MICHAEL NORTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
whose championship of the poor alienated the Roman Catholic church
hierarchy, will resign his priesthood, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vatican, which has long been at odds with the populist
leader, pressured Aristide to resign, a church source said. A
government official, who also requested anonymity, confirmed
Aristide would leave the priesthood.
<p>
   There was no official response from the Vatican, but some church
sources said it would be unusual for the Vatican to force a priest
to quit. A senior Vatican official said it was unlikely the Vatican
would demand Aristide leave the church at such a sensitive moment
in Haiti.
<p>
   Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years of exile following a
September 1991 military coup. Thousands of U.S. soldiers came to
the Caribbean nation to help restore his elected government.
<p>
   The church official said Aristide will send a letter of
resignation to the Vatican, but he did not say when. Aristide
decided it would be better for Haiti if he resigned because the
Vatican is so influential, the official said.
<p>
   The president was in a closed meeting with Haitian business
leaders in the national palace Wednesday morning and not
immediately available for comment.
<p>
   Aristide gained prominence years ago as a pulpit orator,
criticizing the former Duvalier family dictatorship and subsequent
military-backed governments.
<p>
   The Haitian church hierarchy aligned itself with the country's
dictatorial rulers and repeatedly castigated Aristide for his open
opposition to the Duvaliers and their successors.
<p>
   The Vatican informed Aristide years ago that involvement in
politics was ``incompatible'' with the priesthood, a policy
enforced worldwide under Pope John Paul II.
<p>
   In 1988, Aristide was expelled from the Salesian order, which
said he fomented class hatred. The expulsion meant he could not
perform duties such as Mass, but did not strip him of his
priesthood.
<p>
   Aristide continued speaking at Masses, but only at services
where another priest officiated.
<p>
   Aristide has appeared more moderate since returning to Haiti,
repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   Although Aristide draws support with his mystique as a priest,
some of his backers said Wednesday they were not concerned.
<p>
   ``Aristide is a statesman. The most important dimension of the
man today is not the religious, it is the political,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, a leader of the grass-roots Lavalas political
organization, which is loyal to Aristide.
<p>
   ``One less role to play,'' said Jean Frederick, a resident of
the capital who is unemployed. ``In any case, the people will
always call him `Father Aristide.'''

Registrar To Leave War Crimes Tribunal
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal
Registrar Theo van Boven has told the U.N. court he's leaving his
post by the end of the year, a Tribunal spokesman said Wednesday.
<p>
   Van Boven has a six-month contract and will not be renewing it,
spokesman Christian Chartier said.
<p>
   Word of Van Boven's departure came only a week after the
Tribunal issued its first indictment and months before the first
defendant is expected in its rented courtroom in an insurance
company office building here.
<p>
   ``I can confirm that this is (for) purely personal reasons,''
Chartier said. ``There's no question of a conflict with the
Tribunal or with the U.N.''
<p>
   Van Boven was appointed last January, took up his post in
February, and signed a six-month contract this summer.
<p>
   Van Boven wasn't available for comment, Chartier said.
<p>
   His replacement will be appointed by U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali after consultation with the Tribunal's
President.
<p>
   Last Monday, it was Van Boven who named alleged camp commander
Dragan Nikolic, a Bosnian Serb, as the subject of the Tribunal's
first indictment.
<p>
   Van Boven also was involved in the Tribunal's historic first
public sitting the next day when the court requested jurisdiction
in the case of notorious war crimes suspect Dusan Tadic who's being
held by German authorities.
<p>
   Van Boven, 60, was director of the U.N.'s Human Rights Division
from 1977 to 1982 and is a professor at the Netherlands' Limburg
University.

<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Members of the huge roster of House Republican
first-termers pledged loyalty to their conservative campaign agenda
Wednesday, vowing to cut spending and change the way government
works.
<p>
   ``We intend to do what we said we intend to do,'' Rep.-elect
Susan Myrick of North Carolina said as she and seven other members
of the 73-member group sat down with veteran lawmakers planning the
transition to a Republican-controlled House.
<p>
   Rep.-elect Mike Forbes of New York said the voters told him over
and over this fall of their frustration ``with Washington and the
bureaucracy in Congress.''
<p>
   Forbes and others got their first taste of closed-door meetings
in Congress as Rep. Newt Gingrich, in line to become Speaker in
January, said the new Republican majorities may be able to reach
accommodation swiftly with the White House on legislation to
enhance the president's ability to cut individual items from
overall spending bills.
<p>
   He said he, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and White House
chief of Staff Leon Panetta had a ``very, very good meeting'' on
Tuesday.
<p>
   Gingrich also announced that Rep. Gerald Solomon, just elected
to his ninth term from New York, would become chairman of the Rules
Committee. The panel must approve the terms for debating each bill,
and thus is critical to a party's ability to maintain control over
the House.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Gingrich left the Capitol long enough to appear
before the a group of conservatives, where he said he was ``pretty
cheerful about cutting spending,'' and adamantly opposed to so much
as a discussion about raising taxes.
<p>
   ``That issue is over. It's gone. It's finished,'' he said to
applause Tuesday during an enthusiastically received appearance at
a conference of the conservative Heritage Foundation.
<p>
   The Republican who will head the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee in the new Congress echoed Gingrich.
<p>
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas said Republican tax relief will not be
as costly as Democrats allege, ``and whatever we do is going to be
paid for by spending cuts.''
<p>
   Archer suggested that dlrs 50 billion could be saved over five
years in welfare reform alone. ``In addition, we are going to talk
about welfare benefits for illegal aliens,'' he said.
<p>
   In his remarks, Gingrich blended the challenge confronting the
Republican, 104th Congress with a critique of American society.
<p>
   ``It is impossible to maintain a civilization where 12-year-olds
are having babies, where 15-year-olds are killing each other, where
17-year-olds are dying of AIDS and where 18-year-olds are receiving
diplomas they can't even read,'' he said.
<p>
   Gingrich said the House would vote on Jan. 19 on a
constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.

Norwegian Peace Broker Meets Cuban Sides
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  A Norwegian diplomat who helped lead secret
Middle East peace talks last year has visited Havana and Miami to
meet Cuban officials and exiles, a spokesman said Wednesday.
<p>
   Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egeland was in Florida in the first
half of last week, then was in Cuba on Thursday and Friday, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen.
<p>
   The spokesman denied that Norway was seeking to open a new,
back-door channel between the Cuban sides, as it had for Israel and
the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
<p>
   ``There was nothing secret about the trip. We just didn't see
any need to broadcast it,'' Havnen said.
<p>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks had been held in Norwegian country
mansions, private homes and sealed-off hotel suites in what became
known as ``The Oslo Channel.''
<p>
   ``We haven't tried to open a new `Oslo channel','' Havnen said
about the visit by Egeland and Arne Aasheim, the Norwegian Foreign
Ministry's adviser on Latin America.
<p>
   In Florida, the officials met Cuban exiles leading the
opposition to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. In Cuba, they met with
Cuba's foreign minister and other government officials, as well as
dissidents, Havnen said.
<p>
   ``They discussed human rights, and democracy and of course the
tense situation about refugees,'' Havnen said.
<p>
   About 24,000 Cuba refugees are living at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay
Naval Base in Cuba. Another 8,000 are at U.S. military facilities
in Panama.
<p>
   U.S. President Clinton in August sought to deflect a mass exodus
of Cuban boat people by ordering all rescued at sea be sent to the
the bases.
<p>
   The Norwegian spokesman said Egeland did not plan another trip
to the area. He called the trip a normal visit between officials of
countries which have normal diplomatic relations.
<p>
   Havnen said he did not know the names of the exiles Egeland met
in Miami.
<p>
   Norway's Egeland was part of a tight-knit Norwegian team that
brokered months of secret talks in and near Oslo between the PLO
and Israel. They led to an agreement on limited Palestinian
self-rule last year.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Norwegian diplomats again helped Israeli and
Palestinian leaders iron out complications in the peace process.

   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP)  &MD;  Swedish and Lithuanian experts
completed a search for explosives at Lithuania's main power plant
on Wednesday without finding any evidence of sabotage, the Baltic
News Service reported.
<p>
   The emergency inspection followed two threats to blow up the
Ignalina facility. Both reactors at the plant, 160 kilometers (100
miles) from Vilnius, were shut down in an action expected to cost
the nation hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<p>
   Experts reportedly did find some weak points that could be
targeted by terrorists, the news service reported.
<p>
   Povilas Vaisnys, director of the Lithuanian Atomic Energy Safety
Inspectorate, said the inspectors' report will not be made public
because it reveals Ignalina's weak points and discusses possible
attacks.
<p>
   The plant's reactors may come back on line by the end of the
week, the official was quoted as saying.
<p>
   Ignalina usually supplies 80 percent of Lithuania's energy
needs. Besides bringing in the Swedish experts, the government
tripled the number of troops guarding the sprawling plant.
<p>
   The latest threat on the plant came Friday after a Vilnius court
handed down a death sentence to crime boss Boris Dekanidze. The
gang Dekanidze heads reportedly threatened to target Ignalina in
reprisal for the death sentence.
<p>
   Earlier, Kestutis Mazuika was arrested in Stockholm, Sweden,
after he walked into the prime minister's office and threatened to
blow up Ignalina unless he was paid dlrs 8 million.

Leading Greek Politician Resigns From Parliament
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  A leading politician and founding member
of the main conservative opposition party Wednesday announced his
resignation from Parliament after denouncing what he described as
the ``sick'' state of Greek politics.
<p>
   Andreas Andreanopoulos, a former industry minister and ex-mayor
of the Athens port city of Piraeus, criticized both the ruling
Socialist party and his own New Democracy party as being
anachronistic and dependent on vested interests. He will be
replaced by another conservative.
<p>
   ``I don't want to have further contact with the sad phenomenon
that is called politics in Greece...(my resignation) is a
denunciation of our sick political system,,'' Andreanopoulos told
reporters.
<p>
   His resignation comes at a time of wide popular dissatisfaction
with the two established parties and their leaderships.
<p>
   Andreanopoulos also accused both parties of allowing his
indictment by Parliament in mid-September for breach of faith in
the sale of Greek cement giant AGET Herakles. Deputies from both
parties later described his indictment as a mistake.
<p>
   Andreanopoulos, 48, was a 20-year Parliament veteran and leading
proponent of privatization, an unfettered free market and radical
liberalism.

PGA European Tour Opposes Proposed New Tour
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP)  &MD;  The PGA European Tour has joined
the U.S. PGA in opposing the formation of a new golf tour organized
by Fox Broadcasting.
<p>
   ``There has to be serious concern over any attempt to undermine
the essential elements of Tour jurisdiction,'' Ken Schofield,
executive director of the European tour, said Wednesday.
<p>
   Schofield said he agrees with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem
that the Fox project ``would have a negative impact on existing
events and result in fewer playing opportunities for Tour
members.''
<p>
   Finchem said Tuesday that PGA professionals won't be allowed to
play on the new tour.
<p>
   Fox, in conjunction with Executive Sports, plans to organize
about eight tournaments of 30 to 40 players. The tournaments would
conflict some weekends with PGA Tour events.
<p>
   In the idea comes to fruition, it would give the Fox network its
third major sports property. Fox outbid CBS for the rights to NFC
football games and plans to regularly broadcast NHL games when  &MD; 
and if  &MD;  the hockey season begins.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of Yugoslav army
involvement. Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would
draw harsh international reaction, particularly after the United
Nations eased sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing
in August to stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other
war material.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that rebel Muslims, who have
backed Bosnian Serbs before, had crossed over into Bosnia, likely
to help their Serb allies.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Jadranko Prlic, defense minister of a federation of Bosnian
Croats and Muslims, said the mostly Muslim government army and
Bosnian Croat militias were capable of holding the lines around
Bihac.
<p>
   But he demanded the United Nations permit Croatia to act against
any attacks from Serb-held territory on the defenders of Bihac.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Reporting on a new element in the fighting Wednesday, the United
Nations said 15 to 20 truckloads of rebel Muslim troops crossed
into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
<p>
   Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket
after toppling rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic in August, sending
his supporters fleeing into Serb-held parts of Croatia. Abdic has
Bosnian Serb support.
<p>
   Sketchy U.N. reports described the situation as ``tense and
unstable.'' Izetbegovic asserted more cross border aid to the
Serbs, saying rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter attack
on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian Prime
Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, Abdic's earlier stronghold on
the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Izetbegovic told reporters in Sarajevo he planned to ask
Madeline Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for
help in pushing for U.N. action to stop the Bihac assault.
<p>
   He criticized both the United Nations, which has declared the
Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and NATO, which has
conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia at U.N. behest,
for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a government-held northern
city that is also a ``safe zone'' was shelled for the third
straight day Wednesday. One person died in the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region followed gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. And in
a coordinated attack with Croat allies, they took the Serb-held
town of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

<p>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP)  &MD;  Swedish and Lithuanian experts
completed a search for explosives at Lithuania's main power plant
on Wednesday without finding any evidence of sabotage, the Baltic
News Service reported.
<p>
   The emergency inspection followed two threats to blow up the
Ignalina facility.
<p>
   Both reactors at the plant, 160 kilometers (100 miles) from
Vilnius, were shut down. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said
the shutdown would cost the country an estimated dlrs 10 million.
<p>
   Regardless who was responsible for the act of ``nuclear
blackmail  &MD;  internal or external enemies  &MD;  it was a major threat
and caused a destabilizing influence,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
<p>
   Experts reportedly did find some weak points that could be

Gonzalez Denies Any Wrongdoing In Case Of Brother-In-Law
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, speaking on
the issue for the first time in parliament, emphatically denied any
wrongdoing Wednesday in a controversy alleging he gave favored
treatment to a company that employed his brother-in-law.
<p>
   ``I can assure you... I have never given favored treatment to
family members or others,'' Gonzalez said. ``If somebody says I
have done so  &MD;  let them prove it. If not, correct the error.''
<p>
   Speaking in response to vigorous questions from opposition
leaders, Gonzalez minced few words in his replies.
<p>
   The anti-government daily ``El Mundo'' for several weeks has run
articles alleging that Gonzalez's Socialist government awarded
major contracts to a firm that employed his brother-in-law.
<p>
   Gonzalez said his administration had investigated the charges
and found no substance in them. He accused those who charged
otherwise of ``lying.''
<p>
   Rosa Aguilar, a deputy for the leftist coalition IU, was the
most outspoken in attacking Gonzalez. She called the prime minister
the ``president of unemployment, of scandal, of irregularities, of
shady dealings, of a lack of openness... and overall the corruption
president... It's time for you to go.''
<p>
   The so-called ``Palomino Affair''  &MD;  named for Gonzalez's
brother-in-law Francisco Palomino  &MD;  is the latest in almost two
years of scandals involving politicians and businessmen close to
the government.
<p>
   Gonzalez has not been linked directly to any of the scandals.
<p>
   The prime minister said previous corruption cases, that he
admitted were serious, had created an atmosphere that allowed false
accusations to flourish.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Mario Conde  &MD;  the former head of the bank Banesto
was accused of criminal fraud in a Madrid high court.
<p>
   Other cases include the disappearance in May of Luis Roldan, the
former head of Spain's paramilitary guard. He remains at large and
is accused of stealing thousands from public funds.
<p>
   The same month, former Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio was
arrested and accused with insider trading and filing false tax
returns.
<p>
   Last month, businessman Javier de la Rosa was jailed for
misappropriating large sums of money for a company he ran.

Lithuania dlrs 10 million
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP)  &MD;  Swedish and Lithuanian experts
completed a search for explosives at Lithuania's main power plant
on Wednesday without finding any evidence of sabotage, the Baltic
News Service reported.
<p>
   The emergency inspection followed two threats to blow up the
Ignalina facility.
<p>
   Both reactors at the plant, 160 kilometers (100 miles) from
Vilnius, were shut down. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said
the shutdown would cost the country an estimated dlrs 10 million.
<p>
   Regardless who was responsible for the act of ``nuclear
blackmail  &MD;  internal or external enemies  &MD;  it was a major threat
and caused a destabilizing influence,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted him as saying.
<p>
   Experts reportedly did find some weak points that could be
targeted by terrorists, the Baltic News Service reported.
<p>
   Povilas Vaisnys, director of the Lithuanian Atomic Energy Safety
Inspectorate, said the inspectors' report will not be made public
because it reveals Ignalina's weak points and discusses possible
attacks.
<p>
   The plant's reactors may come back on line by the end of the
week, the official was quoted as saying.
<p>
   Ignalina usually supplies 80 percent of Lithuania's energy
needs. Besides bringing in the Swedish experts, the government
tripled the number of troops guarding the sprawling plant.
<p>
   The latest threat on the plant came Friday after a Vilnius court
handed down a death sentence to crime boss Boris Dekanidze. The
gang Dekanidze heads reportedly threatened to target Ignalina in
reprisal for the death sentence.
<p>
   Earlier, Kestutis Mazuika was arrested in Stockholm, Sweden,
after he walked into the prime minister's office and threatened to
blow up Ignalina unless he was paid dlrs 8 million.

Solemn Holiday in Germany Is Defended As It Fades Out
By LARRY THORSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BERLIN (AP)  &MD;  A holiday devoted to repentance was dwindling down
to its last national observance in Germany Wednesday with
resistance from church-goers and some politicians.
<p>
   People signed petitions in some Protestant churches at
mid-morning services urging the holiday be kept rather than give it
up to help finance a new health-care plan.
<p>
   Schools and businesses were closed throughout the country, and
traffic was light on streets and highways that normally would throb
with commercial life on a Wednesday. Gambling casinos, pinball
parlors and nightclubs were legally required to close for Buss- und
Bettag  &MD;  Repentance and Prayer Day.
<p>
   The holiday derives from early Christian practices and is a
cousin of the Jewish Yom Kipper, or Day of Atonement, when people
are supposed to repent their sins. Ancient rulers in Europe,
blaming sinful people for calamities and plagues, would order days
of repentance to fend off catastrophe and war.
<p>
   During the late 19th century, the holiday in Germany settled on
the Wednesday before the last Sunday of the church year, and is
largely a Protestant observance.
<p>
   But Roman Catholic clerics have joined Protestants in objecting
to striking off the holiday. A Catholic holiday may be the next to
fall to finance long-term nursing care under a new health insurance
plan.
<p>
   The government, after a long debate, decided to add nursing care
for the elderly and chronically ill to Germany's generous health
insurance program  &MD;  but without adding to employers' contributions
for health insurance.
<p>
   Instead, each of the 16 states was told to eliminate a paid
holiday in 1995, and Repentance Day has been chosen in all the
states except Saxony in the east and Baden-Wuerttemberg in the
southwest. The latter state is cutting the Monday after Pentecost,
but Saxony refused to cut any holiday at all. Employees in Saxony
will have to give up larger payroll deductions for nursing-care
insurance than workers in other states, and the national labor
federation declared that would put Saxons at a disadvantage.
<p>
   A second holiday is to be eliminated later when nursing-care
coverage is gradually expanded.
<p>
   In the southern state of Hesse, Protestant church-goers in at
least 100 parishes signed petitions Wednesday to retain the
holiday, and protest marches were held.
<p>
   Hesse Governor Hans Eichel said in a Deutschland Radio interview
he now believed the government should reconsider striking the
holiday.
<p>
   At the main Protestant church in Hamburg, St. Michael's, pews
reserved for legislators were draped with cloths last Sunday to
protest the city-state's government decision to eliminate
Repentance Day.
<p>
   The Catholic church in the eastern state of Thuringia issued a
statement saying that striking the holiday to finance health care
was wrong in view of the cultural and religious importance of the
day.
<p>
   Cutting Repentance Day will leave Germans with at least 11 paid
holidays a year. The number varies in each state, with Berlin the
lowest and Bavaria's 14 at the top of the ranking.

Communists Take An Early Lead in Nepal Polls

<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance established an early
lead in parliamentary elections over the centrist party which has
governed the country for three and a half years, bagging 20 of the
29 seats for which results had been declared Wednesday.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress, which was in power, had won five seats, and
a pro-monarchy group three. The remaining seat went to an
independent.
<p>
   The Communists' promise to institute land reforms and break up
large holdings has wide appeal in this mountainous agricultural
country sandwiched between India and China.
<p>
   The government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was
discredited because of Nepal's weak economy.
<p>
   Trends from 80 constituencies showed the four left-wing parties
were leading in 35 places and the Nepali Congress in 15, said a top
official of the election commission. The monarchist party and
smaller groups were leading in the remaining constituencies.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who is contesting from two
constituencies, is leading in one and trailing behind a communist
rival in the other by a few hundred votes.
<p>
   ``It's a positive trend. We are hopeful that we will have a
comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar, secretary-general of the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninst).
<p>
   Some 2,000 jubilant Communist supporters chanting anti-Koirala
slogans marched through the capital celebrating the victory of all
their seven candidates in Katmandu. The victors included the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) chairman, Manmohan
Adhikari.
<p>
   Final results of the elections would not be declared until a
week because the election commission had ordered a repoll in 64
polling stations in 33 constituencies, where Tuesday's voting was
marred by violence.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
following a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's government and forced
elections 18 months ahead of schedule.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress is contesting all the 205 seats in the House
of Representatives as against 196 by Communists.

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction

<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, is
expected to be sold for up to 6.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5
million) Wednesday.
<p>
   Auctioneers Christie's hope the Winter Egg, which the czar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, will
fetch the highest price ever paid for an imperial egg.
<p>
   Nicolas Romanov, a great-great-nephew of the czar, and Tatiana
Faberge, a great-niece of the famed jeweler, planned to attend the
sale at a luxury Geneva hotel.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's put
a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the biggest flawless
heart-shaped diamond sold at auction.
<p>
   David Bennett, Sotheby's European director for jewelry sales,
said he expected it would be bought by a Middle Eastern buyer. The
62.42-carat diamond is newly cut and is classed as D-category  &MD;  the
clearest and purest.
<p>
   The two big auction houses regard Geneva as the most important
international jewelry sales center because it is easily accessible
for Middle and Far Eastern buyers who want to make their purchases
in more discretion than is offered by New York or London.
<p>
   The catalog sales price for the egg is 3.5-6.5 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 2.7-5.0 million). The record was set by the Love
Trophy Egg, sold in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian imperial family from 1885 to 1917.
<p>
   Czar Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to
his wife each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift
to both his wife, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs, with more than 1,300 rose-diamonds and topaz.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, the jeweler fled to
Switzerland and died in Lausanne in 1920.
<p>
   Of the eggs still known to exist, 10 of them are in Moscow's
Kremlin Armory Museum and a further 11 belong to the Forbes
Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II owns
three. The rest are divided among museums and private collections
in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's has stayed tight-lipped about the seller of the
Winter Egg, merely saying that it is a private individual.

<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  Two vans belonging to Greek radio stations
were torched by self-proclaimed anarchists Wednesday, one day
before an annual protest march to the American embassy here. There
were no injuries.
<p>
   The vans were destroyed outside the Athens Polytechnic
University, which has been celebrating the anniversary of a bloody
1973 student uprising against the 1967-74 military junta.
<p>
   A group of anarchists later set a trolley, bus, van and shop
ablaze with gasoline bombs. No one was hurt.
<p>
   Nearby riot squads did not intervene as the anarchists sought
asylum in the Polytechnic, where police may not enter without
university permission. In a similar incident two years ago,
anarchists caused dlrs millions in damage and nearly burned down
the entire Polytechnic when police tried to oust them.
<p>
   The anniversary is often marred by clashes between anarchists
and riot police. It is marked with a march to embassy, which many
here think supported the junta.

   BAREFOOT BAY, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  Dogs nosed through the wreckage of
mobile homes Wednesday in a search for survivors of a tornado
spawned by Tropical Storm Gordon that turned a retirement community
into splintered trash. One person was killed.
<p>
   The deaths of two other people in Florida on Tuesday, including
that of a 16-year-old surfer, were also blamed on the storm that
left more than 100 dead when it smashed through the Caribbean.
<p>
   The tornado touched down in Barefoot Bay, then ripped a path
southeast through Snug Harbor Lakes, another retirement community.
Fifty houses were destroyed and 100 others were damaged in the two
clusters of mobile homes.
<p>
   ``I was going out to the kitchen and all of a sudden the lights
went off. The ceiling started falling on me and then the windows
blew out. There was glass all over the floor,'' said 71-year-old
Eileen Sheehan of Snug Harbor, one of about 80 people staying in a
Red Cross shelter.
<p>
   The deadliest tropical storm of the season hit Florida after
wreaking havoc in the Caribbean. At least 100 people were confirmed
killed in Haiti, and the independent Radio Signal FM reported the
death toll was at least 400. Two people died in Jamaica and two in
Cuba. A Florida woman died Monday when she was ejected from her car
and run over.
<p>
   Gordon had turned back across Florida by 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT),
moving ashore just south of Fort Myers and traveling northeast at 5
mph (8 kph). The storm's maximum sustained winds remained at 50 mph
(80 kph).
<p>
   The tornado bounced across a two-mile (three-kilometer) stretch
of the state Tuesday evening.
<p>
   In Barefoot Bay, an Atlantic Coast town of 7,000 people about
145 miles (230 kilometers) north of Miami, strips of siding hung
from trees like Christmas tinsel Wednesday and fluffy insulation
and other debris were strewn everywhere.
<p>
   Officers and dogs searched Snug Harbor and Barefoot Bay
Wednesday morning for people who may be trapped or dead, although
everyone seems to be accounted for, sheriff's department
spokeswoman Joan Heller said.
<p>
   More than 40 people were injured by the tornado. Six were in
serious condition and two were in critical condition, Heller said.
<p>
   Neighbors identified the dead man as 74-year-old Jack Fuller.
Doug Harrod said he found the man's crushed body as he heard
Fuller's wife calling for help.
<p>
   Tuesday's other storm-related deaths included the surfer who
drowned in Bal Harbour and a man who died in a multi-vehicle
accident in Fort Pierce.
<p>
   Gordon whipped up winds that grounded a 506-foot (152-meter)
freighter yards (meters) from the beach in Port Everglades early
Tuesday.
<p>
   More than 8 1/2 inches (21.5 cms) of rain fell in Homestead,
which supplies half of the nation's winter vegetables. Wind scarred
eggplant, squash and pepper plants.
<p>
   About 15,000 South Florida customers remained without power
Wednesday morning, the Florida Power and Light Co. said. Since the
storm hit Monday, the power company said outages have hit 482,000
homes and businesses.

first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
following a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's government and forced
elections 18 months ahead of schedule.

Defense Minister Warns Of Peacekeeper Pullout If Embargo Weakened
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  France will withdraw its peacekeepers from Bosnia
``if another step is taken'' toward lifting the arms embargo,
Defense Minister Francois Leotard said Wednesday.
<p>
   The conservative government has said previously it would
withdraw its peacekeepers  &MD;  the biggest foreign contingent in
Bosnia  &MD;  if the embargo were lifted.
<p>
   But Leotard's comments to the National Assembly made clear
France was ready to order a pullout even before a total collapse of
the embargo.
<p>
   He described the recent U.S. decision to halt enforcement of the
embargo as ``a total rupture'' with U.N. and NATO decisions.
<p>
   ``It is a decision which, in allowing the possible delivery of
heavy arms to Bosnian territory, could put the U.N. peackeeping
contingents in jeopardy,'' he said.
<p>
   ``If another step is taken in the direction of lifting the
embargo, a direction which the American Congress seemingly wishes
to follow, France will draw the conclusions with its European
partners and withdraw the peacekeeping troops which thus find
themselves threatened,'' he said.
<p>
   Bosnia was one the main topics on the agenda of Russian Foreign
Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who is on a four-day visit to Paris. He
declined to give any details of Bosnia-related discussions during
brief comments to reporters after meeting President Francois
Mitterrand on Tuesday.

EU Adopts New Rules On Airline Subsidies; Iberia Could Gain
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  &MD;  The European Union's executive body
Wednesday set new guidelines for state subsidies to airlines, which
could open the way for troubled Spanish carrier Iberia to receive
an injection of up to dlrs 1 billion.
<p>
   The new rules, drafted by EU Transport Commissioner Marcelino
Oreja, will allow second helpings of state aid if ``exceptional
circumstances'' harmed an airline's business.
<p>
   They could include events such as the Gulf War or a major
currency devaluation, Oreja told a news conference in Strasbourg,
France.
<p>
   In recent years, the European Commission, the EU's executive
agency, has conditioned approval of airline subsidies on
``one-time, last-time'' commitments by governments to end such
payments.
<p>
   The new rules will enable the commission to be more flexible.
<p>
   The Spanish peseta has depreciated by 27 percent since 1992,
when Iberia last received government aid of 120 billion pesetas
(dlrs 937 million). That assistance was part of a restructuring
program set to last until 1996.
<p>
   The commission conditioned its approval then on a Spanish
commitment that the money would be the government's last for the
duration of the restructuring program.
<p>
   Oreja, who is Spanish, declined to comment on Iberia or other
specific cases.
<p>
   After losses of 69 billion pesetas (dlrs 560 million) last year,
Iberia is expected to lose more than 40 billion pesetas (dlrs 300
million) this year.
<p>
   In an effort to ease the financial pressure, Iberia is expected
to present a restructuring plan that calls for about dlrs 1 billion
in fresh subsidies in return for selling stakes in other airlines
and shedding 2,100 jobs.
<p>
   Besides dropping the ``one-time, last-time'' rule, the EU
guidelines stipulate that:
<p>
   - Subsidies should be part of a restructuring plan that includes
cutting flights, if needed;
<p>
   - Subsidies shouldn't be used to increase flights in a way that
hurts rival airlines;
<p>
   - Subsidies should not be used to acquire stakes in other
carriers;
<p>
   - Subsidies must be publicly disclosed and monitored;
<p>
   - Governments must not interfere in airline management.

<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  Bosnia's president appealed to the United
Nations on Wednesday to take immediate action to halt a ``massive
attack'' on the Bihac area in nothern Bosnia by Serb forces from
U.N.-protected zones in Croatia.

Saudi Arabia Captures Gulf Cup Soccer Tourney
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Saudi Arabia on Wednesday
clinched the Gulf Cup soccer championship with a 2-0 victory over
Kuwait.
<p>
   The Saudis won the tourney for the first time ever with four
wins and one draw for nine points.
<p>
   United Arab Emirates, the tourney host and the Saudi's nearest
rival, face winless Oman later Wednesday in the tournament finale.
But UAE with two wins and two draws cannot catch the Saudis
regardless of the outcome.
<p>
   The Arab world's premier soccer tournament, held every other
year, began in 1970.
<p>
   Kuwait, with nine players suspended, failed to convert despite
several scoring opportunities.
<p>
   Fahd Muhallil scored the Saudis' first goal in the 36th minute
after a swift counterattack.
<p>
   Midfielder Fuad Anwar wrapped up the match with an explosive
goal in the 81st minute, a 25-meter drive that was one of the
finest in this 14-day tournament.
<p>
   Saudi midfielder Khalil Muwald, who set up the first goal,
picked up the dlrs 3,000 Man of the Match award.
<p>
   After the victory, the new champions raced to the 5,000-strong
Saudi crowd to accept the applause.
<p>
   The Saudi team can expect both glory and a cash windfall when it
returns home after a successful season that included the first
appearance by a Gulf team in the second of the World Cup.
<p>
   Seven-time champion Kuwait, on the other hand, leaves in virtual
disgrace following four life bans and five suspensions in addition
to finishing fourth out of five with one win, one draw and three
losses. The Kuwaitis were favored by many to defeat the Saudis.
<p>
   The Kuwait Football Federation did not give reasons for the
suspensions.
<p>
   But according to sources and press reports in Abu Dhabi and
Kuwait, eight of the players had traveled to neighboring Dubai and
spent the night there after Sunday's drab 0-0 draw with Oman.
<p>
   In Kuwait a press campaign against the players already began
Wednesday with daily Al-Qabas lashing out at what it termed ``a
moral farce that shook the national team.''
<p>
   Kuwait, traditionally a football powerhouse in the Arab world,
was the first team from the Gulf to qualify for the World Cup
finals in 1982.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian government forces,
trying to solidify battlefield gains before winter sets in, appear
to be running out of ammunition and other supplies, a U.N. official
said today.
<p>
   Fighting continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia,
where Serbs have retaken territory captured by Muslim-led
government troops in recent weeks, and in other flashpoints in
northern and central Bosnia.
<p>
   Front lines appeared to have changed little. U.N. spokesman Lt.
Col. Tim Spicer said government attacks that began late last month
may have run their course for now. Lack of coordination may have
resulted in temporary shortages of ammunition and other supplies,
he said.
<p>
   ``What we are seeing now is a general slowing of military
activity,'' he said from Sarajevo. ``It may resurge, it may not.''
<p>
   Cold and snow limit military movements during winter, fast
approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government troops apparently are
trying to spread Serb forces thin, capturing positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   The major powers trying to negotiate an end to Bosnia's civil
war, meanwhile, will meet early next month to try to overcome
differences and restart stalled peace efforts.
<p>
   The United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany drafted a
peace plan that the Bosnian Serbs rejected last summer. Since then,
the five nations have divided over how to proceed, but their
foreign ministers will try to revive the peace process in talks
Dec. 2-3 in Brussels, said Hans van den Broek, the European Union
foreign affairs chief.
<p>
   Government forces captured hundreds of square miles of territory
in northwest Bosnia late last month and, in a coordinated attack
with Croat allies two weeks ago, took the Serb-held town of Kupres,
60 miles northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres and in northeast Bosnia,
where a platoon of 30 to 40 Bosnian Serbs apparently is trapped by
government troops. Battles also were reported around an important
road leading to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   But while government troops still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared ``safe area,'' in a counterattack.
<p>
   Bosnia's president, Alija Izetbegovic, appealed to the United
Nations for action today against what he described as a ``massive
attack'' on the Bihac area by Croatian Serbs in U.N.-protected
zones in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Izetbegovic made the plea in a telephone call to the president
of the Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, a U.N.
official said.
<p>
   Bosnian Serb fighters apparently were also being backed up by 15
to 20 truckloads of rebel Muslim troops, who crossed into northwest
Bosnia from Serb-held parts of Croatia, the United Nations
reported.
<p>
   The rebels had gone to Serb-held parts of Croatia after
government soldiers toppled their leader, Fikret Abdic, in August
and took control of the Bihac area. Abdic has Serb support.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
surrounded throughout the 2{-year-old war by Serb rebels in Bosnia
and neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Bosnian radio on Tuesday reiterated charges that Serbs in
Croatia also were attacking government forces in Bihac. But it said
the new government lines were ``steady and unbreakable.''
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch air strikes in
retaliation for attacks on the U.N. ``safe area,'' has been under
pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac pocket.
<p>
   NATO has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of
violations of ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel. The
alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb territory into Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Gingrich Worried About GATT Passage in Senate
EDs: UPDATES throughout with Gingrich, Panetta comments, edits to
trim.
By DAVE SKIDMORE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on
Wednesday he is ``very, very concerned'' about the prospects of the
lame-duck Democratic Senate passing a new world trade accord.
<p>
   Gingrich told reporters he remains personally committed to
passing the pact but that the White House ``needs to agree'' to
concerns expressed by Sen. Bob Dole.
<p>
   Dole, the soon-to-be majority leader, has said he favors steps
to make sure the new World Trade Organization, which would referee
trade disputes, wouldn't amount to a surrender of U.S. sovereignty.
<p>
   He has said he is predisposed to support the accord, but wants
Clinton to endorse separate legislation early next year that will
strengthen the United States ability to withdraw from it if U.S.
sovereignty becomes compromised.
<p>
   Gingrich's remarks came a day after Sen. Jesse Helms, incoming
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hinted he will
hinder the administration's foreign policy initiatives unless
President Clinton agrees to postpone a vote on the accord,
negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<p>
   White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was asked Wednesday if
he was worried that Helms would block action on GATT and said,
``No, not at all. He's opposed trade agreements in the past ... I
don't suspect that this threat is going to change any votes.''
<p>
   Panetta also said the administration had made it clear ``that
any delay kills the GATT'' and indicated the administration
intended to press forward.
<p>
   In a letter to the president released Tuesday, Helms, said the
GATT pact does not have to be ``raced through a lame-duck session
of the U.S. Senate on a very unwise `fast-track schedule.'''
<p>
   Votes on GATT are scheduled Nov. 29 in the House and Dec. 1 in
the Senate. Clinton has called on Republicans to support the pact,
initiated during the Reagan presidency, as evidence of their
willingness to cooperate with his administration.
<p>
   GATT supporters fear postponement would doom the accord because
special fast-track rules that protect it from being amended expire
at the end of this year.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a prominent investment banker cautioned Congress that
rejection of GATT  &MD;  or even postponement of congressional votes  &MD; 
would shake world financial markets and send interest rates higher.
<p>
   ``Financial markets are now totally committed to open trade and
investment. Any signal that carries with it a threat to
international cooperation is bound to have serious consequences,''
Felix G. Rohatyn told the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday.
<p>
   Rohatyn said rejection of GATT would further pressure a dollar
already trading near record lows against the Japanese yen and
German mark.
<p>
   ``This not only could mean a lower dollar and a lower stock
market, but higher mortgage rates, higher auto loan rates and lower
home equity values,'' he said.
<p>
   Rohatyn's testimony came during the eighth and last hearing on
GATT conducted by an ardent opponent of the pact, Democratic Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings.
<p>
   Hollings used his chairmanship of the Commerce Committee in
October to delay the Senate vote on GATT.

PGA Head Pulls Away From New Golf Tour
EDS: UPDATES with European PGA reaction
By BOB GREEN
AP Golf Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Even before FOX-TV's new golf tour is officially announced, U.S.
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem has made a move to oppose it.
<p>
   Finchem said Tuesday that U.S. PGA Tour members won't be allowed
to play on the new tour, which is being put together by Fox
Broadcasting and Executive Sports.
<p>
   The new tour would consist of about eight tournaments of 30 to
40 players each and would conflict some weekends with PGA Tour
events.
<p>
   ``Over the past few years, the PGA Tour has had discussions with
other golf organizations about a series of events that could be
scheduled in addition to the various international tour
schedules,'' Finchem said.
<p>
   However, he said any project aimed at boosting international
play must benefit golf, have the support of all golf organizations
and produce a ``positive impact'' on the current tours.
<p>
   ``In our view,'' Finchem said, ``the proposal from Fox and
Executive Sports as we understand it, fails to meet any of these
criteria.''
<p>
   The PGA European Tour Wednesday also announced its opposition to
the proposed tour.
<p>
   ``There has to be serious concern over any attempt to undermine
the essential elements of Tour jurisdiction,'' Ken Schofield,
executive director of the European tour, said in Virginia Water,
England.
<p>
   Schofield said he agrees with Finchem that the Fox project
``would have a negative impact on existing events and result in
fewer playing opportunities for Tour members.''
<p>
   Fox Sports media director Vince Wladika said, ``We are in
discussion with Executive Sports regarding a new golf proposal that
was brought to us by Executive Sports.''
<p>
   Officials of Executive Sports, a long-established Delray Beach,
Fla., organization that manages and produces a number of
tournaments on the regular, senior and ladies' tours, were
unavailable for comment.
<p>
   In the idea comes to fruition, it would give the Fox network its
third major sports property. Fox outbid CBS for the rights to
National Football Conference games and plans to regularly broadcast
National Hockey League games when  &MD;  and if  &MD;  the hockey season
begins.
<p>
   Greg Norman, long an outspoken proponent of a world tour for
golf's leading players, reportedly met with Executive Sports
officials Tuesday in Thousand Oaks, Calif., where his Shark
Shootout tournament will be held this weekend.
<p>
   The Australian star did not immediately return a phone call from
The Associated Press.

Communists Take Early Lead in Nepal Parliamentary Vote
Eds: UPDATES with prime minister winning, other race results.

<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance took an early lead
in parliamentary elections over the centrist party that has
governed the country since 1991, winning 20 of the 30 seats whose
results were announced Wednesday.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala won from Sunsari, 180
kilometers southeast of Katmandu, defeating his Communist rival by
nearly 9,000 votes. He was also leading in a second constituency.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress, which was in power, won six of the seats,
and a pro-monarchy group three. The remaining seat went to an
independent.
<p>
   The Communists' promise to institute land reforms and break up
large holdings has wide appeal in this mountainous agricultural
country sandwiched between India and China.
<p>
   The prime minister's government has been discredited because of
Nepal's weak economy, playing into the Communists' hopes to come to
power in parliament.
<p>
   ``It's a positive trend. We are hopeful that we will have a
comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar, secretary-general of the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist).
<p>
   Some 2,000 jubilant Communist supporters chanting anti-Koirala
slogans marched through the capital celebrating the victory of all
their seven candidates in Katmandu. The victors included the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) chairman, Manmohan
Adhikari.
<p>
   Final results of the elections will not be declared for a week
because the election commission had ordered a recount in 64 polling
stations in 33 constituencies after Tuesday's voting was marred by
violence.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
following a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months ahead of
schedule.

Himalayas May Hold Key to Natural Control of Dutch Elm Disease
Eds: For release at at 2300 GMT.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  A natural method for keeping Dutch elm disease
in check may be lurking in remote valleys of the Himalayas, a
researcher says.
<p>
   Clive Brasier said he found in two valleys an aggressive and
previously unknown species of the fungus that causes the
tree-killing disease. Yet trees in the area show no sign of
infection, he said.
<p>
   So something appears to be controlling the disease, he said. It
could be parasites or viruses attacking either the fungus or the
bark beetle that carries the fungus from tree to tree, he said.
<p>
   If this natural brake on the disease can be found, it might be
useful in controlling epidemics elsewhere, said Brasier, a forest
pathologist at Alice Holt Lodge, a research institute in England.
<p>
   He reports the fungus discovery in the Nov. 17 issue of the
journal Nature.

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Angolan army ordering units to cease fire,
UNITA urging urgent deployment of U.N. monitors
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Close to military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement broadcast on
state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns at 8 p.m.
(1900GMT) and respect the truce ''scrupulously.''
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   In the hours leading up to Wednesday's deadline, fighting raged
on around the northern city of Uige, the last provincial capital
still in rebel hands, military officials said.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions in the northern
enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka was the
first for Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold, although all
previous efforts to stop the war that erupted on the eve of
independence from Portugal in 1975 have failed.
<p>
   UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
-- said the government's orders to hold fire were meaningless
unless the United Nations could guarantee the guns would remain
silent.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
the central highlands around Huambo, the rebel base seized in a
massive government assault last week.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ''to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   The United Nations has promised to start deploying monitors and
police shortly after the treaty is signed but will only dispatch a
peacekeeping contingent once a cease-fire is holding.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is to take effect two days after the
signing.
<p>
   The truce was to be the first step in disengaging the warring
armies. Rebel and government delegations were meeting in Lusaka to
finalize last details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, could be assassinated if he were to
return to Luanda.
<p>
   The government is anxious to limit the size of Savimbi's
personal bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the
capital with a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed at
the start of the latest government offensive were dispelled last
month after U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with
the rebel leader in Huambo.
<p>
   But still he has not appeared in public.
<p>
   The UNITA delegation arrived in Lusaka from Zaire and there has
been widespread speculation that Savimbi had also fled Huambo for
refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen. Eugenio
Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, said: ``In
Angola.'' Responding to further questions whether Savimbi was in
Huambo or Jamba, he only smiled and repeated: ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically over the
past year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA
has lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

Police Arrest Suspect In Ax Murder of Orthodox Priest
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Investigators have arrested a suspect in the 1990
ax murder of a prominent Russian Orthodox priest, officials said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Father Alexander Menn, a writer persecuted for his evangelical
activities, was bludgeoned to death on his way to church in
September 1990.
<p>
   Russia's Interior Ministry would not release more details on the
suspect until after further investigation, ministry spokesman
Alexander Tatsitov said.
<p>
   The renewed interest in the case was prompted by a recent string
of high-profile slayings that have refocused attention on the
country's growing crime problems.
<p>
   President Boris Yeltsin last week ordered the Interior Ministry
to investigate several prominent unsolved murders, including
Menn's.
<p>
   Menn was murdered in Zagorsk, a city 30 miles north of Moscow
famed for its monastery.
<p>
   In Soviet times, Menn had been detained by authorities for
questioning on several occasions for his religious activities.

42 Countries to Attend Political Summit on AIDS
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  High-ranking officials from 42 countries will
gather in Paris on Dec. 1 to discuss political measures to halt the
spread of AIDS, organizers said Wednesday.
<p>
   The conference, billed as the first international political
summit against AIDS, will deal with government action to complement
advances on the medical front.
<p>
   France will donate 100 million francs (dlrs 19 million) to
international agencies to fight AIDS in developing nations, said
Health and Social Affairs Minister Simone Veil.
<p>
   ``The epidemic spares no continent and all countries are
concerned, either because they have already been cruelly hit... or
because they are the main lender countries and must extend a hand
to the most destitute,'' Veil said at a news conference.
<p>
   Among the topics at the summit will be freedom of movement for
people with the AIDS virus. The United States and Japan restrict
access for HIV-positive travellers, and Russian lawmakers are
advocating mandatory AIDS tests for visiting foreigners.

Iranian Parliament Ratifies 5-Year Development Plan
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP)  &MD;  The Iranian parliament has ratified the
country's second five-year development plan, which has been delayed
for a year, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The agency said the plan, which will go into effect March 22,
the start of the new Iranian year, envisaged government spending at
dlrs 100 billion.
<p>
   Oil revenues, which account for the bulk of the country's
earnings, are projected at dlrs 73 billion, said IRNA, adding that
remaining revenues would come from non-oil exports.
<p>
   The English-language Tehran Times quoted Majlis deputy Qorbanali
Dorri-Najafabadi as saying non-oil exports were estimated at dlrs
25 billion.
<p>
   The report was due to appear in the paper's Thursday editions,
but an advance copy was obtained by The Associated Press.
<p>
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the plan was unanimously
approved Tuesday by all 195 deputies present in the 270 member
Majlis, or parliament.
<p>
   It gave no reason for the large number of absentees.
<p>
   The plan has now been forwarded to the Council of Guardians,
which acts as the parliament's upper house.
<p>
   The 12-member council will scrutinize the plan to ensure its
conformity with Islamic law and the constitution. If no changes are
called for, the plan will be ready for implementation once the
council is finished with it.
<p>
   The second Five-year Economic Social and Cultural Development
Plan was to go into effect when the first one ended last March.
<p>
   But it was stalled by a Majlis which objected to key points in
the original draft.
<p>
   The Majlis refused President Hashemi Rafsanjani's demand that
state subsidies be abolished, but agreed to substantial cuts.
<p>
   Rafsanjani argued that his cash-strapped government no longer
could afford the dlrs 11 billion in state subsidies paid out each
year to cushion the largely impoverished 60 million population from
backbreaking inflation unofficially estimated at more than 60
percent a year.
<p>
   Subsidies on medicine, certain foods such as wheat, rice, oil,
sugar and cheese  &MD;  costing an estimated dlrs 1.5 billion per year  &MD; 
are to remain.
<p>
   The parliament also agreed after much debate to double domestic
gasoline prices to 100 rials (5 cents) per liter (0.26 gallons)
starting in March.

Uruguay Extradites Nice's Mayor To France To Face Corruption
Charges
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP)  &MD;  Former Nice Mayor Jacques Medecin,
who says he is the object of a political witchhunt, was extradited
to France on Wednesday to face corruption charges.
<p>
   Escorted by three police officers and a doctor, the flamboyant
former mayor smiled at photographers as he was driven to the
airport where he boarded an Air France flight.
<p>
   Medecin, 66, fled to Uruguay in 1990 to escape charges that he
accepted dlrs 725,000 in bribes and embezzled city funds during his
25 years in office.
<p>
   He was arrested 11 months ago in the Atlantic resort of Punta
del Este, 140 kilometers east of Montevideo, after French
authorities and Interpol requested his detention.
<p>
   A minor celebrity in Uruguay where he lived with his 12-year-old
daughter in a mansion by the coast, Medecin has said he is being
punished by the French Socialists for defeats he inflicted upon
them while mayor.
<p>
   Uruguay's Supreme Court last month ruled that Medecin be
extradited to stand trial in France. The government later rejected
a last-ditch appeal for political asylum when Medecin's lawyers
said his life would be in danger if extradited to France.

Cow Cell Implants Relieve Chronic Pain, Swiss Study Finds
Eds: For release at 2030 GMT.
By MALCOLM RITTER
AP Science Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  People suffering from chronic pain gained
substantial relief from cow cell implants that pumped out natural
painkillers, a small, preliminary study by a Swiss researcher
found.
<p>
   The study involved nine patients, eight of whom had cancer.
Seven patients gained relief.
<p>
   One patient who had not been helped by standard painkillers has
now been pain-free for a year, Dr. Patrick Aebischer said. Two
others whose pain had not responded to standard painkillers
reported their pain had been cut at least in half, and most
patients who were taking morphine cut their dosages by at least
half, he said.
<p>
   Some or all of the relief may have come from just the
psychological boost of being treated, Aebischer acknowledged.
Researchers have begun a more rigorous 30-patient experiment to
check on this placebo effect by giving some patients dummy
implants.
<p>
   If further study bears out the initial promise, such implants
might be useful for treating many kinds of chronic pain that resist
treatment, said Aebischer, a professor of surgery at the Lausanne
University Medical School in Switzerland.
<p>
   Aebischer did the work with scientists from CytoTherapeutics
Inc. of Providence, R.I. He discussed the results before describing
them Wednesday in Miami Beach, Fla., at the annual meeting of the
Society for Neuroscience.
<p>
   Dr. Gavril Pasternak, a professor of neurology at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, called the approach
intriguing.
<p>
   While its usefulness for treating chronic pain in general
remains to be determined, it may prove valuable for some patients,
he said.
<p>
   The painkilling implants contained cells from the adrenal gland,
which sits atop the kidney.
<p>
   Scientists wanted to show that animal cells can work in people
without the use of drugs to prevent rejection of the cells,
Aebischer said. Animal cells eliminate the problem of limited
supply from human donors, he said.
<p>
   To avoid the need for anti-rejection drugs, scientists packed
the calf cells into white plastic tubes about 2 inches long and
about the width of a pencil lead.
<p>
   The tubes contained tiny pores that were big enough to let
painkilling substances called enkephalins and endorphins leak out
but small enough to keep proteins of the immune system from getting
in. So the immune system did not reject the implants, Aebischer
said.
<p>
   Most patients had one tube implanted under local anesthesia in
the lower back, intthe space that contains the liquid surrounding
the spinal cord. Two patients' tubes were inserted into the brain
because they were suffering from facial and neck pain.
<p>
   One of those who gained pain relief is still living; the others
reported relief lasting until their deaths from cancer, up to five
months after they received the implants.
<p>
   The implants produced no serious side effects, Aebischer said.

Clinton Nudges Suharto on Human Rights, Ends Asian Trip
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Helms suggestion on Gatt, more Clinton
comments, recasts, changes byline.
By TERENCE HUNT
AP White House Correspondent
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  In a nation notorious for human rights
violations, President Clinton issued a call Wednesday ``to break
down chains of oppression'' and pledged the United States will not
ignore abuses for the sake of increased trade.
<p>
   Clinton discussed human rights at length with President Suharto
and urged him to make more progress, officials said. Clinton
welcomed Suharto's assurances that he would not punish students who
occupied the U.S. Embassy to demand independence for East Timor,
the former Portuguese colony seized in 1975.
<p>
   The Indonesian leader said his government is dealing fairly with
East Timor, a senior administration official said.
<p>
   Between diplomatic meetings, Clinton shopped for 45 minutes at a
Jakarta flea market, browsing at stalls offering antiques, carved
masks, wind chimes, copper ware and other goods.
<p>
   Indonesia was Clinton's last stop in three weeks of grueling
travel that began with a journey to the Middle East and then picked
up steam with a frenetic campaign tour in the United States before
he set o to the Far East last week.
<p>
   From Jakarta, the president and his wife, Hillary, flew to
Hawaii for a few days rest before returning to Washington to
confront the bitter realities of the Republican election landslide.
<p>
   In a speech to U.S. business leaders here, Clinton reached out
to Republicans, urging them to join with Democrats to pass a global
trade agreement to slash tariffs. Congress is returning this month
in a lame-duck session to vote on the accord, known as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
<p>
   Invoking the name of a legendary Republican who once headed the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Clinton recalled the admonition
of the late Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan that ``partisanship
should stop at the water's edge.''
<p>
   Explaining Vandenberg's exhortation, Clinton said, ``That used
to apply to national security defined in military terms. Today, it
applies to national security defined in economic terms.''
<p>
   In advance of Clinton's speech, Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, the
incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, suggested he
might hinder Clinton's foreign policy initiatives unless the
president agreed to postpone the GATT vote until early next year.
<p>
   Asia is the fastest growing economic region of the world and the
market for one-third of all American exports. Clinton said U.S.
economic strategy must be revised to make Indonesia, Thailand,
China, India and others a larger part of the equation.
<p>
   ``We remain convinced that strengthening the ties of trade among
nations can help to break down chains of repression, that as
societies become more open economically, they also become more open
politically,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   Addressing criticism of his administration, Clinton said, ``We
reject the notion that increasing economic ties in trade and
partnerships undermine our human rights agenda.''
<p>
   Clinton said the United States plays a major role in the
struggle for democracy and freedom around the world, adding, ``We
cannot turn away from that cause and we will not.''
<p>
   With a chuckle, the president made a passing reference to his
own political woes. People everywhere aspire to have a say in
choosing their leaders, he said, adding, ``We permit it on a
regular basis in the United States  &MD;  even when we don't like the
results.''
<p>
   Indonesia is the subject of both praise and criticism from the
United States.
<p>
   Under Suharto's 27-year autocratic rule, Indonesia stands
accused of military brutality, persecution of dissidents,
violations of labor rights and press censorship. Human rights
groups say abuses are particularly harsh in East Timor.
<p>
   On the other hand, Indonesia, with 185 million inhabitants, is
an unmistakable economic success story, boasting one of the best
growth rates in the developing world.
<p>
   Over the last quarter century, the percentage of Indonesia's
population in dire poverty has plummeted from 60 percent to 14
percent.
<p>
   Clinton applauded business contracts signed this week in
Indonesia worth over dlrs 40 billion, timed to coincide with the
president's visit.
<p>
   These ranged from an Exxon contract with the country's national
oil company to develop an offshore natural gas field to joint
ventures in telecommunications, power transmission and
environmental cleanup.
<p>
   ``We're grateful for the business,'' Clinton said. ``The most
important thing for me is these contracts will support jobs,
thousands of them, back home.''

Major Stakes Job on Increasing Funding For European Union
Eds: Updates with Major vowing to make increased funding an issue
of confidence in government, Changes headline, Trims
By SUE LEEMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister John Major, trailing badly in
public opinion polls, staked his job Wednesday on increasing
Britain's funding for the European Union.
<p>
   Rebellious lawmakers in his governing Conservative Party, who
oppose closer British integration with Europe, said they will fight
Major's plan to increase Britain's payments to Brussels by 250
million pounds (dlrs 400 million) a year by 2000.
<p>
   At Wednesday morning's opening of Parliament, Queen Elizabeth II
outlined Major's proposal to beef up support for the EU to bring
Britain in line with an agreement reached in December 1992 to
increase Brussels' levy on member states.
<p>
   ``There's no room for compromise on this bill,'' Major told the
House of Commons Wednesday night, vowing to make its early passage
an issue of confidence in the government.
<p>
   That means defeat of the bill would oblige Major's government to
resign, forcing a general election. The ultimatum appeared aimed at
bringing rebellious Tories into line behind the bill, or face a
likely defeat at the polls.
<p>
   The Tories are trailing Labor by more than 30 points in opinion
polls, and with a majority of 13 in the 361-seat House of Commons,
the government has little leeway for maneuver.
<p>
   Major said the European Community Finance Bill's ``successful
passage  &MD;  in all its essentials  &MD;  is inescapably a matter of
confidence because of the agreements reached with our European
partners.''
<p>
   Opposition Labor Party leader Tony Blair had earlier stepped up
pressure on Major, warning that if he intended to regard the EU
finance bill as a confidence issue, which could lead to an
election, then the government's problems would become ``much more
difficult.''
<p>
   If the Labor Party decided to vote against the finance bill, and
enough Conservatives rebelled against Major, the bill could be
defeated.
<p>
   Rebel Conservatives say they cannot approve any increase while
the EU is losing millions through fraud and waste. The EU Court of
Auditors revealed Tuesday that losses from misuse of funds top the
equivalent of 740 million dollars.
<p>
   As a reassurance to the rebels, the queen promised Wednesday
that ``my government ... will promote budgetary discipline in the
(European) Union and combat fraud.''
<p>
   British monarchs, long stripped of political power,
traditionally open Parliament sessions by reading a speech written
by the prime minister. The queen, in an ermine-trimmed robe and
diamond crown, peered through glasses to read the short speech
outlining the government's legislative program.
<p>
   The 13 bills outlined in this year's address contained few
surprises. Labor said the lackluster program is evidence the
government has run out of steam.
<p>
   Major was forced earlier this month to abandon the Tories' most
dramatic initiative, a plan to privatize the Royal Mail, after
dissident Tory lawmakers threatened to humiliate the prime minister
by voting down the measure in Parliament.
<p>
   Senior Tory lawmaker Sir Marcus Fox warned rebels that a vote
against the EU finance bill could destabilize Major's government.
<p>
   But rebel Conservative lawmaker Teresa Gorman said legislators
``are not poodles.''
<p>
   ``I can't believe that anyone in Parliament thinks it is in the
interests of their voters to give more money to an organization
which we are told by its own auditors is thoroughly corrupt,'' she
told BBC radio.
<p>
   Britain gave 1.7 billion pounds (dlrs 2.72 billion) to the EU in
1993-94.

Government Troops Bogging Down Before Winter Sets In

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian government forces,
trying to solidify battlefield gains before winter sets in, appear
to be running out of ammunition, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   Fighting continued in the Bihac region of northwest Bosnia,
where Serbs have retaken territory captured by Muslim-led
government soldiers in recent weeks.
<p>
   Front lines appeared little changed. U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Tim
Spicer said government attacks that began late last month may have
run their course for now. Lack of coordination may have resulted in
temporary shortages of ammunition and other supplies, he said.
<p>
   ``What we are seeing now is a general slowing of military
activity,'' he said from Sarajevo. ``It may resurge, it may not.''
<p>
   Cold and snow limit military movements during winter, already
being felt in parts of hilly Bosnia. Government troops apparently
are trying to spread Serb forces thin, capturing positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   The major powers trying to negotiate an end to Bosnia's civil
war, meanwhile, will meet early next month to try to overcome
differences and restart stalled peace efforts.
<p>
   The United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany drafted a
peace plan that the Bosnian Serbs rejected last summer. Since then,
the five nations have divided over how to proceed, but their
foreign ministers will try to revive the peace process in talks
Dec. 2-3 in Brussels.
<p>
   Government forces captured hundreds of square kilometers of
territory in northwest Bosnia late last month and, in a coordinated
attack with Croat allies two weeks ago, took the Serb-held town of
Kupres northwest of Sarajevo in central Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting is continuing north of Kupres and in northeast Bosnia,
where a platoon of 30 to 40 Bosnian Serbs apparently is trapped by
government troops. Battles also were reported around an important
road leading to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   But while government troops still are trying to make gains in
those areas, they have been unable to hold what they took in the
northwest. Serbs have rolled government forces back toward Bihac, a
U.N.-declared ``safe area,'' in a counterattack.
<p>
   Bosnia's president, Alija Izetbegovic, appealed to the United
Nations for action Wednesday against what he described as a
``massive attack'' on the Bihac area by Croatian Serbs in
U.N.-protected zones in neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   Izetbegovic made the plea in a telephone call to the president
of the Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, a U.N.
official said.
<p>
   Bosnian Serb fighters apparently were also being backed up by 15
to 20 truckloads of rebel Muslim troops, who crossed into northwest
Bosnia from Serb-held parts of Croatia, the United Nations
reported.
<p>
   The rebels had gone to Serb-held parts of Croatia after
government soldiers toppled their leader, Fikret Abdic, in August
and took control of the Bihac area. Abdic has Serb support.
<p>
   The Bihac pocket, the far northwest corner of Bosnia, has been
surrounded throughout the 2{-year-old war by Serb rebels in Bosnia
and neighboring Croatia.
<p>
   NATO, which could be called in to launch air strikes in
retaliation for attacks on the U.N. ``safe area,'' has been under
pressure to respond to the fighting in the Bihac region.
<p>
   NATO has struck Bosnian Serb targets five times because of
violations of ``safe areas'' or attacks on U.N. personnel. The
alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently limited to Bosnia,
to cover shelling from Croatian Serb territory into Bosnia.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Organic Farmers From Maryland Help Set Up ``County Fair'' In
Russia
Eds: Also moved in advance.

<TEXT>
<p>
   KNOXVILLE, Md. (AP)  &MD;  Maryland organic farmers Sylvia and Walter
Ehrhardt went to Russia this fall to help private farmers in the
former Soviet Union hold a down-home, American-style county fair.
<p>
   ``We say `market and free enterprise' and it's as if we said `Go
to the moon,''' said Sylvia Ehrhardt, who worked as assistant to
the deputy press secretary in the Carter White House before
starting an organic farm here in 1979.
<p>
   It was the third trip to Russia for Sylvia and her husband,
Walter, whose 30-year career in government included 20 years with
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>
   The two got involved in helping the Russian farmers through the
San Francisco-based Center for Citizen Initiatives, formerly the
Center for US-USSR Initiatives.
<p>
   The Ehrhardts also were among 10 Americans from Maryland and six
other states who went to Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1993 to teach
Russians how to set up backyard, rooftop and community gardens to
cope with food shortages and rampant inflation.
<p>
   This time, the couple went to Sergiev Posad, 75 miles northeast
of Moscow, to share farming and marketing experience. They ended up
helping organize a county fair, which was proposed during an
earlier visit by Wayne Vandre, a horticulture specialist at the
University of Alaska extension service in Anchorage.
<p>
   In limbo between the old system and the free market system, the
Russian farmers have little idea about marketing crops. This became
especially critical in 1993 when farmers in the region learned that
government officials in the Moscow region decided to buy potatoes
from Poland, Walter Ehrhardt said.
<p>
   Without the ability to transport the potatoes to another region,
hundreds of thousands of pounds of potatoes rotted in the fields,
he said.
<p>
   ``They just left these Russian farmers high and dry,'' he said.
``We talked to one farmer who had just destroyed 200 tons of
potatoes.''
<p>
   After the ``potato fiasco,'' an estimated 200 of the 300 farmers
in the region went out of business, said Will Easton, coordinator
of center's agricultural initiative in Russia.
<p>
   About 20 or 30 farmers participated in the county fair, which
the Russians called an ``exhibition.'' There were displays of
poultry, fruits, vegetables, livestock grains, herbs and honey. The
farmers invited commercial buyers to view their products and
discuss contracts for their 1995 crops.
<p>
   ``There have been big exhibitions for all of Russia before, but
never for the regions,'' Easton said. ``Because of the poor
infrastructure, local economic development has to be the driving
engine. It's the county fairs that need to happen all over
Russia.''
<p>
   This Russian version of a rural American tradition was meant to
primarily support the private farmers, a struggling new group
created after the break up of thousands of huge collective and
state farms throughout Russia.
<p>
   The Ehrhardts and others publicized the fair through the Russian
and foreign press; invited food distributors and wholesalers from
Moscow; and notified the embassies, which are interested in buying
pesticide-free food.
<p>
   The 17 farmers who exhibited at the fair sold their 1994 harvest
and received contracts for their 1995 crops. The food was purchased
by a Holland-owned food processor in Russia, foreign embassies and
local institutions, including a food processing plant that supplies
food to children's orphanages and hospitals.
<p>
   ``The exhibition went very impressively,'' Natalya Andreeva, an
instructor at the All-Russian Agricultural College wrote to the
Ehrhardts on Oct. 17. ``All farmers who participated have been
contracted not just for this year's crop, but moreover for the next
season. They didn't expect that and now are full of gratitude to
CCI and you personally.''
<p>
   Earlier this year, the center sent five instructors to Sergiev
Posad to the All-Russian Agricultural College, the center of
agricultural education in the former Soviet Union. The Americans,
including Vandre, worked with instructors to restructure the
curriculum to include information on sustainable agriculture, the
idea of growing crops in concert with the environment, society and
the local economy.
<p>
   Sustainable agriculture does not preclude pesticides or tillage
practices, but it insures that the land will be productive in the
future, Vandre said.
<p>
   ``They want to incorporate organic farming. Just the cost of
fertilizer and pesticides is a big factor,'' Vandre said. ``And the
other part is that in talking with them, especially the ones from
the collective farms, their experience with pesticides has not been
good.''

Embattled Interior Minister Addresses Hostile Parliament
By LARRY RYCKMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Russia's embattled interior minister went before a
hostile parliament Wednesday and conceded that police have failed
to keep up with the explosive growth of organized crime in the past
year.
<p>
   Viktor Yerin, who has been criticized by every faction in
parliament, also said more than 500 policemen had been arrested on
corruption charges so far this year.
<p>
   ``I recognize that we haven't yet taken all the necessary steps
to fight organized crime, corruption and drug trafficking,'' Yerin
told members of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, in a
report that outlined his ministry's crime-fighting successes and
failures.
<p>
   Yerin said the overall number of crimes had dropped 4 percent
from last year, but that violent crimes had increased.
<p>
   ``Blatant crimes such as terrorist acts, hostage-taking and
contract killings have become more frequent,'' he said.
<p>
   Last year, there were 650 bomb explosions that killed 116
people, according to Interior Ministry statistics cited by the
ITAR-Tass news agency. In Moscow alone, there are 40 bomb blasts
each month, and half of all contract killings in Russia are carried
out in the capital.
<p>
   Some lawmakers were not impressed by Yerin's speech, and
criticized his ministry for protecting the wealthy at the expense
of ordinary Russians.
<p>
   ``There will be no real fight against crime unless the Interior
Ministry's best forces stop guarding banks and private businesses
instead of performing their direct duties,'' said Isa Kostoyev,
chairman of the parliament committee on legal affairs.
<p>
   Yerin blamed part of the problem on a lack of money. He said
nearly 25 percent of the money promised by the government this year
was never delivered, and police were forced to make cutbacks.
<p>
   Despite the problems, there have been some gains, Yerin said.
<p>
   Police this year arrested 25 percent more leaders and members of
criminal groups, and eliminated 255 gangs altogether, he said. They
also seized 9,000 weapons and 10,500 pounds of explosives.
<p>
   Yerin also said progress had been made in two murder
investigations closely followed by Russian lawmakers: the cases of
Duma deputies killed earlier this year.
<p>
   Andrei Aidzerdzis, a businessman turned lawmaker, was shot in
April on the doorstep of his home in a slaying fellow deputies
blamed on organized crime. Valentin Martemyanov, a Communist Party
deputy, died Nov. 5, five days after being beaten and robbed near
his home.
<p>
   The number of murders in Russia rose 10.2 percent in the first
10 months of 1994, according to Interior Ministry figures.
<p>
   In Moscow, with a population of 10 million, than 1,500 people
have been murdered so far this year, said Viktor Golovin, deputy
chief of criminal investigations in the capital.
<p>
   That is a lower rate than in the most violent U.S. cities, but
far higher than Moscow's rate under the tight control of the Soviet
years.

Bosnia Appeals For U.N. Action To Halt Serb Offensive
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details on safe areas, Bosnian
justification for launching past attacks from safe zone.

<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  Bosnia's president appealed to the
Security Council on Wednesday to take immediate action to halt a
``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb forces on the Bihac area in
northern Bosnia from U.N.-protected zones in Croatia.
<p>
   President Alija Izetbegovic made the plea in an 11:30 a.m. (1630
GMT) telephone call to the president of the Security Council, U.S.
Ambassador Madeleine Albright, a U.N. official said.
<p>
   There must be some consequences to the Serbs for the attacks,
the U.N. official quoted Izetbegovic as saying.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles) and supporting their offensive with at
least 30 tanks, heavy artillery, helicopters and infantry, the
official said.
<p>
   Izetbegovic asked the Security Council to take immediate action,
according to the U.N. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
<p>
   Bihac is among six ``safe areas'' in Bosnia declared by the
United Nations.
<p>
   While Izetbegovic did not deny that Bosnian government forces
have used the Bihac area to launch their own attacks, the Bosnian
president said ``the area had been encircled and cut off from
humanitarian assistance for months,'' according to the official.
<p>
   ``He claimed ... that the (Bihac) population is exposed to
extreme starvation conditions, therefore the attacks from the safe
zones to relieve the humanitarian crisis were justified ...'' said
the U.N. official, reading from a statement that Albright had
delivered to the council moments earlier.
<p>
   In the Bihac region, Serbs have retaken territory captured by
soldiers of the Muslim-led government in recent weeks.

<p>
   President Alija Izetbegovic made the plea in an 11:30 a.m. (1630
GMT) telephone call to the president of the Security Council, U.S.
Ambassador Madeleine Albright, a U.N. official said.
<p>
   There must be some consequences to the Serbs for the attacks,
the U.N. official quoted Izetbegovic as saying.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles) and supporting their offensive with at
least 30 tanks, heavy artillery, helicopters and infantry, the
official said.
<p>
   Izetbegovic asked the Security Council to take immediate action,
according to the U.N. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
<p>
   Bihac is among six ``safe areas'' in Bosnia declared by the
United Nations.
<p>
   While Izetbegovic did not deny that Bosnian government forces
have used the Bihac area to launch their own attacks, the Bosnian
president said ``the area had been encircled and cut off from
humanitarian assistance for months,'' according to the official.
<p>
   ``He claimed ... that the (Bihac) population is exposed to
extreme starvation conditions, therefore the attacks from the safe
zones to relieve the humanitarian crisis were justified ...'' said
the U.N. official, reading from a statement that Albright had
delivered to the council moments earlier.
<p>
   In the Bihac region, Serbs have retaken territory captured by
soldiers of the Muslim-led government in recent weeks.

Organic Farmers From Maryland Help Set Up ``County Fair'' In
Russia

<TEXT>
<p>
   KNOXVILLE, Md. (AP)  &MD;  Maryland organic farmers Sylvia and Walter
Ehrhardt went to Russia this fall to help private farmers in the
former Soviet Union hold a down-home, American-style county fair.
<p>
   ``We say `market and free enterprise' and it's as if we said `Go
to the moon,''' said Sylvia Ehrhardt, who worked as assistant to
the deputy press secretary in the Carter White House before
starting an organic farm here in 1979.
<p>
   It was the third trip to Russia for Sylvia and her husband,
Walter, whose 30-year career in government included 20 years with
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>
   The two got involved in helping the Russian farmers through the
San Francisco-based Center for Citizen Initiatives, formerly the
Center for US-USSR Initiatives.
<p>
   The Ehrhardts also were among 10 Americans from Maryland and six
other states who went to Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1993 to teach
Russians how to set up backyard, rooftop and community gardens to
cope with food shortages and rampant inflation.
<p>
   This time, the couple went to Sergiev Posad, 75 miles northeast
of Moscow, to share farming and marketing experience. They ended up
helping organize a county fair, which was proposed during an
earlier visit by Wayne Vandre, a horticulture specialist at the
University of Alaska extension service in Anchorage.
<p>
   In limbo between the old system and the free market system, the
Russian farmers have little idea about marketing crops. This became
especially critical in 1993 when farmers in the region learned that
government officials in the Moscow region decided to buy potatoes
from Poland, Walter Ehrhardt said.
<p>
   Without the ability to transport the potatoes to another region,
hundreds of thousands of pounds of potatoes rotted in the fields,
he said.
<p>
   ``They just left these Russian farmers high and dry,'' he said.
``We talked to one farmer who had just destroyed 200 tons of
potatoes.''
<p>
   After the ``potato fiasco,'' an estimated 200 of the 300 farmers
in the region went out of business, said Will Easton, coordinator
of center's agricultural initiative in Russia.
<p>
   About 20 or 30 farmers participated in the county fair, which
the Russians called an ``exhibition.'' There were displays of
poultry, fruits, vegetables, livestock grains, herbs and honey. The
farmers invited commercial buyers to view their products and
discuss contracts for their 1995 crops.
<p>
   ``There have been big exhibitions for all of Russia before, but
never for the regions,'' Easton said. ``Because of the poor
infrastructure, local economic development has to be the driving
engine. It's the county fairs that need to happen all over
Russia.''
<p>
   This Russian version of a rural American tradition was meant to
primarily support the private farmers, a struggling new group
created after the break up of thousands of huge collective and
state farms throughout Russia.
<p>
   The Ehrhardts and others publicized the fair through the Russian
and foreign press; invited food distributors and wholesalers from
Moscow; and notified the embassies, which are interested in buying
pesticide-free food.
<p>
   The 17 farmers who exhibited at the fair sold their 1994 harvest
and received contracts for their 1995 crops. The food was purchased
by a Holland-owned food processor in Russia, foreign embassies and
local institutions, including a food processing plant that supplies
food to children's orphanages and hospitals.
<p>
   ``The exhibition went very impressively,'' Natalya Andreeva, an
instructor at the All-Russian Agricultural College wrote to the
Ehrhardts on Oct. 17. ``All farmers who participated have been
contracted not just for this year's crop, but moreover for the next
season. They didn't expect that and now are full of gratitude to
CCI and you personally.''
<p>
   Earlier this year, the center sent five instructors to Sergiev
Posad to the All-Russian Agricultural College, the center of
agricultural education in the former Soviet Union. The Americans,
including Vandre, worked with instructors to restructure the
curriculum to include information on sustainable agriculture, the
idea of growing crops in concert with the environment, society and
the local economy.
<p>
   Sustainable agriculture does not preclude pesticides or tillage
practices, but it insures that the land will be productive in the
future, Vandre said.
<p>
   ``They want to incorporate organic farming. Just the cost of
fertilizer and pesticides is a big factor,'' Vandre said. ``And the
other part is that in talking with them, especially the ones from
the collective farms, their experience with pesticides has not been
good.''

Bishops Urge Greater Role for Women in Church
EDS: UPDATES throughout with vote on women in church, trims.
By DAVID BRIGGS
AP Religion Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Women should be encouraged to move into the
top ranks of church theologians and administrators, U.S. Catholic
bishops said in a major policy statement Wednesday.
<p>
   The bishops called on the all-male Catholic hierarchy to reject
authoritarian conduct, use gender-neutral language in religious
education materials and explore alternatives for women to share
authority in the church short of the priesthood.
<p>
   ``We are presented with a graced moment to restore our belief in
the equality of men and women,'' said Bishop John J. Snyder,
chairman of the Committee on Women in Society and in the Church.
<p>
   The bishops approved the statement 228-10.
<p>
   Also on the third day of their annual meeting, the prelates
unanimously approved a pastoral message urging the nation's 59
million Catholics to work with Americans of all faiths to oppose
both euthanasia and the death penalty, budget cuts affecting the
poor and the proliferation of assault weapons, abortion and violent
protests at clinics.
<p>
   The ban on women priests  &MD;  affirmed by Rome in the church's new
universal catechism and in a papal letter earlier this year  &MD;  has
been at the forefront of debates on the role of women in the
church. Disagreement over the issue caused the U.S. bishops in 1992
to abandon a pastoral letter on women after nine years of work.
<p>
   The bishops' new statement invites the nation's Catholics to
continue to work for greater roles for women in the church although
the pope has spoken on the ordination question.
<p>
   ``We need to look at alternative ways in which women can
exercise leadership in the church. We welcome this leadership,
which in some ways is already a reality, and we commit ourselves to
enhancing the participation of women in every possible aspect of
church life,'' the bishops said.
<p>
   The bishops especially encouraged women to make inroads into the
fields of biblical studies, theology and canon law.
<p>
   ``In no way should these commitments be construed as `ecclesial
political correctness,''' the bishops said. ``They are
theologically correct.''
<p>
   In a specific recommendation addressing an area of concern to
U.S. women, the bishops said although the universal catechism does
not use gender-neutral language, in this country the church should
avoid using terms such as ``man'' or ``men'' when referring to all
of humanity.
<p>
   In their statement ``Confronting a Culture of Violence: A
Catholic Framework for Action,'' the bishops sought a new civility
in public policy debates that would replace confrontational
politics with concern for the common good.
<p>
   ``In the face of so much violence, fear and polarization in our
land, we call for a moral revolution, which begins with a
fundamental respect for human life, which recovers a sense of right
and wrong, rejects vengeance in the face of violence,'' said Bishop
John H. Ricard.
<p>
   The bishops said they support stronger gun control measures and
called on Catholics to address ``the slow motion violence of
discrimination and poverty, hunger and hopelessness, addiction and
self-destructive behavior.''
<p>
   ``Our entire nation is slipping into an acceptance of violence  &MD; 
in our policies of abortion on demand and increasing executions, in
our high rates of crime and our exploitation of violence in
entertainment,'' Ricard said.

Minister Claims Fundamentalists Killed Inmates; Newspapers Closed
EDs: UPDATES with two more newspapers suspended.

<TEXT>
<p>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP)  &MD;  Islamic fundamentalist prisoners
reportedly cut the throats of eight common criminals during a
failed prison breakout crushed by security forces.
<p>
   Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia, in an interview published
Wednesday in the daily El Moudjahid, reported the deaths but gave
no overall total of prisoners killed or injured.
<p>
   Security forces reported Tuesday ``a few injured and a few
dead'' among the prisoners, along with three guards hurt. Informed
sources said at least 30 inmates were killed.
<p>
   The attempted breakout at Berrouaghia prison, 120 kms (75 miles)
south of Algiers, began Sunday when 20 inmates using knives, forks
and other sharpened objects attacked guards.
<p>
   Teguia blamed Islamic fundamentalists inmates, who make up 800
of the 3,000-strong prison population. During 40 hours of talks
between riot leaders and authorities, fundamentalists terrorized
ordinary criminals, Teguia claimed,.
<p>
   Security forces put down the rebellion Monday, Teguia told the
newspaper, organ of Algeria's former ruling Marxist party. He
provided no other details.
<p>
   Thousands of militants have been jailed since the
military-backed government canceled January 1992 elections the
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was winning.
<p>
   More than 11,000 people have died in the resulting insurgency.
The government launched an unprecedented offensive this month after
negotiations with jailed Salvation Front leaders broke down.
<p>
   The French newspaper Liberation cited the Salvation Front's
exiled leadership as estimating that more than 1,000 people were
killed Nov. 1-9, mostly ``innocent civilians savagely massacred.''
<p>
   Algeria's largest newspaper, the independent Arab-language El
Habar, was shut down Wednesday by the security forces, according to
editor-in-chief Omar Ourtilane. He said that he was not informed of
the motives for the shutdown.
<p>
   Authorities also suspended publication of two other dailies  &MD; 
the Arab-language El Hiwar for six months and the French-language
El Watan for two weeks. Authorities said they acted in the interest
of national security, but did not cite specific articles which
troubled them.
<p>
   The government has vowed to strictly apply laws to stop the
press from giving Islamic terrorists a ``publicity podium.''

Norwegian Peace Broker Meets Cuban Sides
Eds; CORRECTS name of Palestine in 3rd graf, ADDS background on
past Cuba talks, name of Cuban foreign minister.
By DOUG MELLGREN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  A Norwegian diplomat who helped lead secret
Middle East peace talks last year has visited Havana and Miami to
meet Cuban officials and exiles, a spokesman said Wednesday.
<p>
   Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egeland was in Florida in the first
half of last week, then in Cuba on Thursday and Friday, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen.
<p>
   The spokesman denied that Norway was seeking to open a new,
back-door channel between the Cuban sides, as it had for Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
<p>
   ``There was nothing secret about the trip. We just didn't see
any need to broadcast it,'' Havnen said.
<p>
   U.S. officials, however, said they see the trip as an extension
of Norway's peacemaking in the Middle East and in Guatemala's civil
war, in which Oslo has hosted talks.
<p>
   The Norwegian-broked Middle East talks had been held in
Norwegian country mansions, private homes and sealed-off hotel
suites in what became known as ``The Oslo Channel.''
<p>
   ``We haven't tried to open a new `Oslo channel','' Havnen said.
<p>
   Egeland visited the Cuban officials and exiles along with Arne
Aasheim, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry's adviser on Latin America,
Havnen said.
<p>
   In Florida, the Norwegians met Cuban exiles opposed to Cuban
leader Fidel Castro. In Cuba, they met with Cuba's Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina and other government officials, as well as
dissidents, Havnen said.
<p>
   ``They discussed human rights, and democracy and of course the
tense situation about refugees,'' Havnen said.
<p>
   About 24,000 Cuba refugees are living at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay
Naval Base in Cuba. Another 8,000 are at U.S. military facilities
in Panama.
<p>
   U.S. President Clinton in August sought to deflect a mass exodus
of Cuban boat people by ordering all rescued at sea be sent to the
the bases.
<p>
   In September, Cuba's foreign minister, Robaina, met with
moderate Cuba exiles in Madrid. But Cuban officials have made clear
since then that the meeting was not part of a process leading
toward a political opening.
<p>
   The Norwegian spokesman said Egeland did not plan another trip
to the area. He called the trip a normal visit between officials of
countries which have normal diplomatic relations.
<p>
   Havnen said he did not know the names of the exiles Egeland met
in Miami.
<p>
   Norway's Egeland was part of a tight-knit Norwegian team that
brokered months of secret talks in and near Oslo between the PLO
and Israel. They led to an agreement on limited Palestinian
self-rule last year.
<p>
   Earlier this year, Norwegian diplomats again helped Israeli and
Palestinian leaders iron out complications in the peace process.

Kinkel Remains German Foreign Minister
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BONN, Germany (AP)  &MD;  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will keep his
post in the new government being formed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
but Kinkel's weakened party is losing two Cabinet seats.
<p>
   The centrist Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's
coalition. announced after a leadership meeting in Bonn Wednesday
that party leader Kinkel will remain foreign minister, Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger will continue as justice minister and
Guenter Rexrodt will hold onto the economics portfolio.
<p>
   Kohl is to announce his Cabinet lineup on Thursday. He's
expected to cut two ministries from the current 18, and the Free
Democrats will take all the cuts after their poor showing in the
Oct. 16 national elections. The party slumped from 79 seats won in
the 1990 election to only 47 in the 672-seat lower house of
parliament.
<p>
   The Free Democrats' losses mean the end of Cabinet careers for
Education Minister Karl-Hans Laermann and Construction Minister

U.S., Allies Would Ban Trade in Some Land Mines
By CARL HARTMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Representatives of the United States and 22
other governments have tentatively agreed to ban trade in
anti-personnel land mines, Deputy Director Ralph Earle II of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said Wednesday.
<p>
   ``They're not addressing tank-killers, they're addressing
baby-killers,'' he said.
<p>
   Approval of a U.S. proposal came without dissent, he added.
Millions of such mines are still in the ground throughout the world
after the forces that planted them have left, like the troops of
the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
<p>
   Earle spoke at a conference on holding down the international
traffic in arms, sponsored by the U.S. Center for Defense
Information.
<p>
   He said the accord on mines was reached without dissent at a
meeting in New York Tuesday. Participants were working on a
successor to COCOM, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls. COCOM was the international body formed to prevent
strategic goods reaching the armed forces of the Soviet Union and
China.
<p>
   It was dissolved as a result of the break-up of the Soviet
Union. Earle said the new system would in effect halt shipments to
what he called ``pariah'' states, such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and
North Korea.
<p>
   ``It's as far as I know the only current prospect for a global
conventional arms regime,'' he said. ``It will not be an embargo,
as it was in the past, but a list of items whose exports will be
controlled by national policy.''
<p>
   He said negotiations are going on among the COCOM members,
largely the members of NATO and Japan, and six others: Finland,
Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland and New Zealand. Earle added
that Russia, the world's biggest arms exporter after the United
States, is also interested, as are some other governments.
<p>
   Negotiations are being held as President Clinton's
administration considers a new policy on arms sales. Earle said it
would be several months before it is completed and announced.
<p>
   The new policy is expected to emphasize the role of U.S. arms
sales in preserving jobs and keeping arms industries alive and
prosperous.

   MILAN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on
Wednesday urged nuclear powers to ban production, test and sales of
weapons for fear of possible criminal use.
<p>
   ``The hidden proliferation of nuclear arms can generate the
problem of nuclear blackmail. The nuclear danger is hardly

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: UPDATES with Angolan army ordering units to cease fire, UNITA
urging deployment of U.N. monitors
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army ordered its soldiers to hold fire Wednesday
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement broadcast on
state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns at 8 p.m.
(1900GMT) and respect the truce ``scrupulously.''
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   In the hours leading up to Wednesday's deadline, fighting raged
around the northern city of Uige, the last provincial capital still
in rebel hands, military officials said.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions in the northern
enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night, was the first for
Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold, although all
previous efforts to stop the war that erupted on the eve of
independence from Portugal in 1975 have failed.
<p>
   UNITA  &MD;  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
 &MD;  said the government's orders to hold fire were meaningless unless
the United Nations could guarantee the guns would remain silent.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
the central highlands around Huambo, the rebel base seized in a
government assault last week.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ``to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   The United Nations has promised to start deploying monitors and
police shortly after the treaty is signed.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is to take effect two days after the
signing.
<p>
   The truce was to be the first step in disengaging the warring
armies. Rebel and government delegations were meeting in Lusaka to
finalize details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, could be assassinated if he were to
return to Luanda.
<p>
   The government is anxious to limit the size of Savimbi's
personal bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the
capital with a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed
during the government offensive were dispelled last month after
U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with the rebel
leader in Huambo.
<p>
   There has been widespread speculation that Savimbi also fled
Huambo for refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zaire President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen. Eugenio
Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, said: ``In
Angola.'' Responding to further prodders, he only smiled and
repeated: ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically the past
year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA has
lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

Betselem Calls On Government To Ban Mistreatment Of Detainees
By GWEN ACKERMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  An Israeli human rights organization demanded
on Wednesday that the government ban mistreatment of Palestinians
under questioning and warned that the abuse would breed more
violence.
<p>
   The Betselem group said in a report that despite the Israel-PLO
peace accord, Israel's Shin Bet security service systematically
abused Palestinian detainees to force confessions.
<p>
   Betselem also protested reported plans by the government to ease
restrictions on Shin Bet interrogators to help block bombing and
suicide attacks by Muslim militants.
<p>
   Since October, 24 Israeli civilians and five soldiers have been
killed in such violence.
<p>
   ``The government is actually asking to get a legal umbrella ...
this is unusually dangerous because it opens a crack that will
widen and no one can say where it will stop,'' Betselem director
Yizhar Beer told reporters Wednesday.
<p>
   Under existing rules, Shin Bet interrogators are already allowed
``moderate use of force,'' though the list of permissible methods
was never made public.
<p>
   Citing testimonies from nine former Palestinian detainees and
protocols from four court hearings, Betselem outlined the abuse at
the hands of the Shin Bet.
<p>
   Interrogators prevent detainees from washing; deprive them of
food, drink and sleep; shout insults and abuse; beat them; tie them
to low chairs; and keep them in small closet-like cells, Betselem
said.
<p>
   A senior Shin Bet officer said force was used only in specific
cases.
<p>
   ``We do not deal in torture,'' he told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, ``but it is understandable that when we
deal with Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who hold hostages or
know where a time bomb or car bomb are ticking, we would not be so
gentle.''
<p>
   Government spokesman Uri Dromi denied allegations of systematic
abuse and said security services use moderate force only in special
instances.
<p>
   ``The use of force is not only legitimate in certain cases but
is also essential in the cases known as the ticking bomb, when we
are sure that getting the information from a terrorist might save
the lives of innocent people,'' Dromi said.
<p>
   Dromi also denied that the regulations for interrogations had
been broadened.

BC-US-Tourist Murder, 2nd Ld-Writethru,0682
Accomplice Testifies in British Tourist Slaying
By ADAM YEOMANS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MONTICELLO, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A teen-ager charged in the murder of a
British tourist in North Florida testified Wednesday that he and
his friends decided to steal a car and rob someone because they
needed some money.
<p>
   But the robbery went awry when the victim, Gary Colley, tried to
get away from the youths at a rest stop on Interstate 10, said
Deron Spear, the 18-year-old driver of the getaway car.
<p>
   ``The man tried to back up and he ran into our car,'' said
Spear, who testified for the prosecution. ``That's when everybody
started firing.''
<p>
   One of the bullets hit Colley, 34, in the neck, killing him. His
longtime companion, Margaret Jagger, was wounded.
<p>
   The killing  &MD;  the ninth foreign visitor killed in Florida within
a year  &MD;  damaged the state's dlrs 31 billion tourism business. It
spurred authorities to post 24-hour guards at highway rest stops
and make major reforms in the state's juvenile justice system.
<p>
   Spear testified against 17-year-old John ``Billy Joe'' Crumitie,
as part of a plea bargain. Crumitie is charged with first-degree
murder and first-degree attempted murder.
<p>
   Spear said he, Crumitie and Aundra Akins were sitting around in
September 1993 when they decided to commit a robbery.
<p>
   ``We was just talking we had no money and stuff,'' said Spear.
``We been talking we need to rob somebody.''
<p>
   Spear said he and Akins, 15, got handguns they had and the three
youths stole a car. They then drove to the highway rest area near
Monticello where they found Colley and Jagger in the early morning
hours of Sept. 14, 1993.
<p>
   When Colley tried to back up the couple's rental car to escape,
Crumitie and Akins began firing their guns, Spear said.
<p>
   Spear said they fled in their stolen car and eventually ditched
it in a muddy area near the low-income apartment complex where they
lived.
<p>
   Spear's testimony concluded the prosecution's case against
Crumitie.
<p>
   Another key prosecution witness testified that Crumitie admitted
he was involved in the slaying.
<p>
   ``I asked him if he knew anything about it. He laughed and said
yes,'' said Thaddeus Crumitie, a distant cousin of the defendant.
<p>
   Thaddeus Crumitie, 19, said he gave his cousin, Akins and Spear
a ride the same night that Colley was slain.
<p>
   The witness testified that the three youths said they were
``going on a mission'' to steal a car and rob someone. Thaddeus
Crumitie said his cousin admitted the killing the next day.
<p>
   Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of
informants. They don't have any physical evidence linking John
Crumitie with the stolen car or the murder.
<p>
   John Crumitie's lawyer, Dwight Wells, questioned the credibility
of Spear and the other informants because they had cut their own
deals with authorities for crimes they had been charged with.
<p>
   Thaddeus Crumitie is serving a four-year prison term for an
unrelated robbery.
<p>
   Spear, Akins and another youth also were charged with
first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. Spear and
his half-brother, 14-year-old Cedrick Green, have pleaded to lesser
charges and are awaiting sentencing.
<p>
   Green was not present during the robbery attempt, Spear said.
Green pleaded no contest to a charge of accessory after the fact.
<p>
   Spear pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to commit armed
robbery and accessory after the fact. He faces a maximum of 10
years in prison under the plea bargain.
<p>
   Jagger testified Tuesday that she hadn't been able to identify
Crumitie in police lineups, but she has identified Akins. His trial
date has not been set.
<p>
   Jagger, 36, said the couple were on vacation from their home in
West Yorkshire, England, and were driving from New Orleans to St.
Petersburg. They had stopped for a brief nap shortly after 1 a.m.
when the gunmen approached their car.
<p>
   If convicted on the murder charge, John Crumitie faces a life
sentence with a mandatory 25 years without parole.

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  Acknowledging that authorities are not winning the
war against organized crime, Russia's top law enforcement official
told a hostile parliament Wednesday that police need more
resources.
<p>
   Interior Minister Viktor Yerin also disclosed that 500 officers
were arrested on corruption charges this year.
<p>
   Yerin said police have made some headway against crime, noting
the 4 percent decline in the overall crime rate so far this year.
But he said violent crime is up and criminals are more likely to
turn their fire on police.
<p>
   ``Blatant crimes such as terrorist acts, hostage-taking and
contract killings have become more frequent,'' Yerin told the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament.
<p>
   Yerin came under increasing criticism from parliament this month
after a lawmaker was fatally beaten and robbed, the second Duma
deputy killed this year. Some deputies have called for his
resignation.
<p>
   Russians consistently rank soaring crime as one of their top
worries.
<p>
   ``I recognize that we haven't yet taken all the necessary steps
to fight organized crime, corruption and drug trafficking,'' Yerin
told the lawmakers. ``The crime situation in Russia remains
tense.''
<p>
   After Yerin's speech, lawmakers approved a first reading of an
anti-crime bill by a 235-43 vote. Similar to a decree issued by
President Boris Yeltsin in June, the bill would give police broader
powers, including detaining suspects for 30 days without charges.
<p>
   Yerin said law enforcement agencies are trying to police
themselves, noting the arrests of 500 officers.
<p>
   But he cautioned: ``The same black paint should not be used to
smear all police officers.''
<p>
   He said officers struggle with funding shortages and the lack of
a new criminal code. Nearly 25 percent of the money allocated by
the government this year was not paid, Yerin said.
<p>
   ``As a result, this year we had to cut the purchases of cars,
weapons and protection means,'' he said.
<p>
   After Yerin's address, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky
caused an uproar with a tirade against police.
<p>
   ``All officers of the Interior troops are drunk in the morning.
They take bribes in the morning and get drunk at night,''
Zhirinovsky said. ``Instead of opening criminal cases they open
bottles.''
<p>
   Yerin and his aides responded by walking out, along with members
of the largest reformist faction in parliament.
<p>
   Yerin did report progress in investigations into the two Duma
deputies' deaths. He said police have identified and are looking
for the killer of Andrei Aizderdzis, who was shot in April outside
his home.
<p>
   And suspects have been detained in the beating death of
Communist deputy Valentin Martemyanov, who died Nov. 5, five days
after an attack and robbery near his home, Yerin said.

California Senator to Be Extradited Back to United States
By CARLOS A. SANDI
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP)  &MD;  Former California Sen. Paul
Carpenter has exhausted his last legal appeal to stay in this
Central American nation and will be extradited back to the United
States, authorities said Wednesday.
<p>
   No date has been set for the former state lawmaker's return to
his homeland, where he faces sentencing on political corruption
charges, said Isabel Hernandez, court spokeswoman.
<p>
   ``He could be extradited any minute, but the judge believes it
will be at the beginning of next week,'' Hernandez said.
<p>
   A Costa Rican judge on Tuesday issued the last in a series of
denials of Carpenter's appeal to stop extradition proceedings
against him.
<p>
   Carpenter has been jailed in Costa Rica since April 14, when he
was arrested by Costa Rican and U.S. agents and American
authorities began trying to extradite him to face sentencing in
California.
<p>
   Carpenter, now 66, fled to Costa Rica early this year, saying he
was going to seek treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
<p>
   ``In the present instance I find my drive for survival stronger
than my sense of obligation to your legal system,'' Carpenter said
in a letter to U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia. ``So I tender my
apology for my absence in your court ... ''
<p>
   Carpenter was scheduled to be sentenced in February along with
former lobbyist Clay Jackson. They were convicted on Dec. 1 of
engaging in a complicated bribery plot with another former senator,
Alan Robbins.
<p>
   Carpenter continues to maintain he is innocent.
<p>
   The Orange County Democrat spent 12 years in the Legislature and
four on the state Board of Equalization before his conviction and
removal from office in 1990.

Court Rules Against UEFA in TV Rights Struggle
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  European soccer's governing body UEFA
on Wednesday suffered a setback in its bid for total control over
television rights of Champions League matches.
<p>
   A Bern appeals court upheld an earlier ruling by Bern's judicial
office in favor of a Swiss-based company, CWL Telesport. CWL had
filed a complaint that UEFA's claim to be the exclusive owner of
commercial rights to the Champions League violated Swiss laws on
unfair competition and cartels.
<p>
   UEFA said it would now pursue the case through the civil courts.
<p>
   Under the existing system, UEFA is in charge of television
contracts on the broadcast of every match in the Champions League  &MD; 
the most prestigious and lucrative of all the European soccer
tournaments. UEFA uses part of the revenue to help poorer soccer
clubs, mostly in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
<p>
   The court ruling found that CWL Telesport, based in the Swiss
town of Kreuzlingen, had a valid marketing contract with Steaua
Bucharest, and UEFA had no claim to television transmission rights
outside of Romania for Steaua's home matches. The Bucharest club is
in group C of the Champions league.
<p>
   In effect, it means that UEFA is unable to gain any revenue from
broadcasts in other countries of Steaua's home matches, and can't
exploit rights on stadium advertising boards for those games.
<p>
   ``The policy pursued by UEFA of creating a financial balance,
which takes into account the interests of those who are less strong
in financial terms, is in serious danger,'' said a UEFA statement
responding to Wednesday's decision.
<p>
   The statement said UEFA had received the support of the 16
Champions League teams for its marketing arrangements. The
statement added that UEFA would consult with its member
associations on the consequences of the decision.

Former Workers Of Banned Magazine Start New Venture
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  Former employees of a banned
publication Wednesday started another magazine with cooperation
from one of Indonesia's business conglomerates.
<p>
   The employees had worked for Tempo, the country's leading news
magazine, until the government accused the magazine of running
stories endangering ``national stability'' and revoked its license
in June.
<p>
   The new magazine, Gatra, is published by P.T. Era Media
Informasi, established by the workers' cooperative and Muhamad
(Bob) Hasan, a well-known Indonesian businessman.
<p>
   Some of the former Tempo workers refused to join Hasan, arguing
that such collaboration could infringe on their editorial
independence. They are waiting for a license to start their own
magazine, called Berita.
<p>
   The June banning of Tempo triggered protests in Jakarta and
several other cities by journalists, students and human rights
activists.

Seventeen To Stand Trial In Kickback Scandal
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NAPLES, Italy (AP)  &MD;  A judge Wednesday ordered the former head
of Napoli, a major league soccer team, and 16 other Neapolitan
businessmen and politicians to stand trial Dec. 22 for alleged
kickbacks for 1990 World Cup construction.
<p>
   The ex-club owner and president, Corrado Ferlaino, was
investigated in connection as his role as a leading Naples area
builder.
<p>
   Ferlaino and the others are charged with either corruption or
extortion. Prosecutors alleged that kickbacks totaling about 700
million lire (dlrs 450,000) were paid by some constructors to local
politicians to win contracts to prepare Naples' San Paolo stadium
for the World Cup.
<p>
   Ferlaino headed Napoli during the golden period of Argentine
star Diego Maradona, from 1985-1990, when the Neapolitan team won
two League titles and the UEFA Cup.

Rabin Conditions Palestinian Elections on Changing PLO Charter
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Wednesday he
would not agree to Palestinian elections until the PLO has changed
clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction, media
reports said.
<p>
   Rabin spoke to Israeli reporters accompanying him on a flight to
the United States where he plans to meet with American leaders to
discuss the peace process and U.S. aid to Israel.
<p>
   Rabin was apparently upset by a statement reportedly made by PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat in a speech Tuesday. Arafat, quoting from a
1974 PLO decision to make a point, referred to Israel as an
``enemy.''
<p>
   Rabin told reporters on his plane the PLO would have to stick to
the September 1993 Israel-PLO accord and change the PLO charter, as
promised, before Israel would agree to elections, according to
reports by Israel radio and Israel army radio.
<p>
   In the accord, Israel and the PLO agreed to hold general
elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by July 1994. Balloting
was delayed because Israel and the PLO still haven't reached
agreement on troop redeployment in the West Bank which is to
precede the elections. The two sides also disagree on the nature of
the self-rule council to be elected.
<p>
   A new round of negotiations on elections and redeployment is
scheduled for later this month.

Becker Beats Sampras, Chang Routs Berasategui
Eds: AMs; UPDATES with details, quotes, edits throughout
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a clash of past champions, Boris
Becker produced one of the best matches of his already impressive
year and frustrated top-ranked Pete Sampras with a 7-5, 7-5 victory
Wednesday at the IBM/ATP Tour World Championship.
<p>
   Becker posted his second straight win over the No. 1 in the
world and raised his round-robin record at the dlrs 3-million
tournament to 2-0.
<p>
   ``He was just too good, that's the best I've seen him play
against me,'' Sampras said after his loss in one hour, 43 minutes.
<p>
   ``I really didn't have any chances.''
<p>
   Earlier, Michael Chang crushed Alberto Berasategui 6-1, 6-0.
Berasategui, who has won three games in two matches, said he was
suffering from a wrist injury and only played to protect his
ranking.
<p>
   In the last match of the day, Goran Ivanisevic played Stefan
Edberg.
<p>
   Becker also beat Sampras en route to lifting the Stockholm Open
in the last week of October and is now 5-5 against the American in
his career.
<p>
   ``I don't know if it was my best match against him, but it was
definitely one of my best of the year for me,'' said the German,
who outaced Sampras 15-11.
<p>
   Becker won the tour-ending championship of the top eight players
in the world in 1992, but failed to qualify last year after
dropping out of the top 10.
<p>
   He is back at No. 5 now, after winning four titles this year.
<p>
   ``I would say 1992 was the last year when I was able to play
well against top players all the year,'' said Becker, who beat
Ivanisevic Tuesday.
<p>
   He is in his element in Frankfurt's Festhalle, where he
celebrated his 25th birthday on the day he won the 1992 title and
where he is cheered by 9,000 adoring fans every time he plays.
<p>
   ``It is definitely something that makes even more eager to play,
it makes me try just a little harder because they support me so
much and they expect so much of me and I don't want to let them
down,'' Becker said.
<p>
   With 13 indoor titles since its inception in 1990, Becker leads
the ATP Tour.
<p>
   ``He is a much better player indoor,'' said Sampras, who leads
the tour with nine titles this year. An ankle injury slowed him in
the summer, but he came into the tournament straight form winning
in Antwerp.
<p>
   Becker broke Sampras for decisive 6-5 leads in each set and
never dropped his own serve.
<p>
   Becker hit two aces in the last game with second serves, the
last one giving him three match points. He missed the first serve
but clinched the match when Sampras returned his second serve to
the net.
<p>
   ``He was hitting his second serves as hard as his first. I had
two break points (in the entire match) and I didn't get a racket in
his serve, he hit two aces,'' Sampras said.
<p>
   ``I'm not out of it, but it's not a good start, I'll have to win
the other two matches,'' said Sampras, who won here in 1991.
<p>
   The eight players are split into two round-robin groups, with
the top two from each advancing to the semifinals.
<p>
   Becker, Sampras, Ivanisevic and Edberg are in one group, while
Chang, Berasategui, Andre Agassi and Sergi Bruguera are in the
other. Agassi and Bruguera, who are both 1-0, were idle Wednesday.
<p>
   Chang, the No. 6 who lost to Bruguera Tuesday, needed only 47
minutes to beat Berasategui and even his record to 1-1.
<p>
   The Spaniard blamed the wrist injury for his poor performance.
``Maybe Michael would have beaten me, but I don't think it would
have been 6-1, 6-0.''
<p>
   Berasategui said he played only because he was worried about
losing his ranking.
<p>
   Winner of seven clay-court titles this year, Berasategui is No.
7 in the world, although he usually skips other surfaces.
<p>
   Had he pulled out, Michael Stich, who is No. 9 in the world,
would have replaced him and, under new rules, might have earned
enough points to vault over Berasategui in the rankings.
<p>
   Under old rules, alternate players did not earn points if they
were asked to replace a sick or injured player once the tournament
had started.
<p>
   Agassi beat Berasategui 6-2, 6-0 Tuesday in 45 minutes and later
criticized the ranking system that allows one-surface players to
accumulate enough points to qualify for the finale.

Defense Chief Asks For Aid To House Retired Troops
By BARRY SCHWEID
AP Diplomatic Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Ukraine's defense minister appealed to the
Clinton administration for $50 million to build 2,500 homes for
retired Army troops. ``It is not a big price for better security,''
Valeri Shmarov said Wednesday.
<p>
   The first civilian to head a former Soviet republic's defense
ministry, he briefed reporters on next week's visit of President
Leonid Kuchma as Ukraine's parliament ratified a treaty that will
make the country nuclear-free around the end of the century.
<p>
   Shmarov said assurances President Clinton gave Ukraine in
January that its sovereignty and borders would be protected led to
approval of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Congress has
pledged $177 million to help Ukraine deactivate its missiles and
ship the 1,800 nuclear warheads to Russia.
<p>
   Some 400 have been sent so far, Shmarov said. ``We are within
the schedule.'' But he said bureaucratic obstacles in Washington
had kept some of the money from reaching Kiev. The defense minister
said Ukrainians were bearing most of the cost of the nation
becoming nuclear-free.
<p>
   His appeal for another $50 million for Army housing is likely to
be reinforced by Kuchma when he meets next week with Clinton.
Shmarov said the homes would be part of a ``safety net'' and added:
``We need to have good allies in the military.''
<p>
   Kuchma, a former director of a missile plant, has staked his
political future on eliminating the nuclear weapons Ukraine
inherited from the Soviet Union. He told Kiev legislators that
keeping them would cost the economically beset country $10 billion
to $20 billion a year.
<p>
   About half the $700 million in U.S. aid for Ukraine this year
was targeted at dismantling the nuclear stockpile. The $177 million
comes out of a special fund approved by Congress. Additionally,
under a deal arranged by Clinton, Ukraine stands to gain $1 billion
when the uranium is extracted and sold.
<p>
   Persuading Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal has been one
of the United States' principal foreign policy goals since the
breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia assisted by promising
in January to deliver oil at bargain prices.
<p>
   Clinton has called nuclear arms in the former Soviet Union ''the
most important proliferation challenge facing the world.''
<p>
   Asked if the Republican takeover of Congress, and the historic
GOP distaste for foreign aid, would hurt Ukraine, the defense
minister responded tactfully; ``We are being assured by the
administration that on security issues we should not expect any
drastic change.''

Country Road Doesn't Take Pilot Home
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  An air force fighter pilot fell
slightly off course Wednesday and mistakenly landed on a country
road, then took off again with few people noticing.
<p>
   ``It's not good when this occurs,'' Maj. Torsten Paulsson told
the national news agency TT. ``It could have ended far worse.''
<p>
   The pilot, who was not identified, mistook the empty road for
the runway, which runs parallel not far away, Paulsson said. The
road is one of several in the country that were specially widened
for emergency war-time use.
<p>
   The pilot put down his J-37 Viggen jet, made by the Swedish
automaker Saab, without incident on the highway.
<p>
   He quickly detected his error once on the ground, turned around
the compact, delta-winged jet and took off again, again without
incident, Paulsson said.
<p>
   No cars were on the road at the time and nobody on the ground
appeared to notice.
<p>
   The air force will conduct an investigation into the incident,
which occurred at Bylunda, southern Sweden, not far from the F-10
air force base at Angelholm.
<p>
   The pilot is normally based at the F-16 Uppsala air force base,
almost 70 kilometers (43 miles) north of Stockholm, TT reported.

Saudi Arabia Captures Gulf Cup Soccer Tourney
Eds: UPDATES with tourney finale; ADDS byline.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  &MD;  Saudi Arabia on Wednesday
clinched the Gulf Cup soccer championship with a 2-0 victory over
Kuwait.
<p>
   The Saudis won the tourney for the first time ever with four
wins and one draw for nine points.
<p>
   Second place with eight points was host team United Arab
Emirates, which defeated winless Oman 2-0 in the tourney finale.
<p>
   The Arab world's premier soccer tournament, held every other
year, began in 1970.
<p>
   Kuwait, with nine players suspended, failed to convert despite
several scoring opportunities.
<p>
   Fahd Muhallil scored the Saudis' first goal in the 36th minute
after a swift counterattack.
<p>
   Midfielder Fuad Anwar wrapped up the match with an explosive
goal in the 81st minute, a 25-meter drive that was one of the
finest in this 14-day tournament.
<p>
   Saudi midfielder Khalil Muwald, who set up the first goal,
picked up the dlrs 3,000 Man of the Match award.
<p>
   After the victory, the new champions raced to the 5,000-strong
Saudi crowd to accept the applause.
<p>
   The Saudi team can expect both glory and a cash windfall when it
returns home after a successful season that included the first
appearance by a Gulf team in the second of the World Cup.
<p>
   Seven-time champion Kuwait, on the other hand, leaves in virtual
disgrace following four life bans and five suspensions in addition
to finishing fourth out of five with one win, one draw and three
losses. The Kuwaitis were favored by many to defeat the Saudis.
<p>
   The Kuwait Football Federation did not give reasons for the
suspensions.
<p>
   But according to sources and press reports in Abu Dhabi and
Kuwait, eight of the players had traveled to neighboring Dubai and
spent the night there after Sunday's drab 0-0 draw with Oman.
<p>
   In Kuwait a press campaign against the players already began
Wednesday with daily Al-Qabas lashing out at what it termed ``a
moral farce that shook the national team.''
<p>
   Kuwait, traditionally a football powerhouse in the Arab world,
was the first team from the Gulf to qualify for the World Cup
finals in 1982.

U.N. Responds to Iraq's ``Significant'' Recognition of Kuwait
By DONALD W. SWINTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday
said Iraq had taken ``a significant step'' by recognizing Kuwait.
<p>
   Last week, Iraq recognized Kuwait's sovereignty and its borders,
meeting a key condition set by the United Nations for lifting the
crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi troops invaded the
oil-rich emirate in August 1990.
<p>
   On Monday, the Security Council rejected an Iraqi request to
lift the sanctions, saying Iraq had not met other conditions set
under the cease-fire resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf War.
<p>
   After three days of discussion, the 15-member council on
Wednesday approved a statement to Iraq calling the political and
territorial recognition of Kuwait ``a significant step in the
direction towards implementation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions ...''
<p>
   The council president, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, said
in her letter to Iraq that ``the members of the Security Council
will follow closely Iraq's implementation of its decision ...''
<p>
   Iraq's recognition of Kuwait is a fundamental step toward
lifting the oil embargo and other economic sanctions, said New
Zealand Ambassador Colin Keating.
<p>
   The most important remaining issues are the release of Kuwaiti
prisoners still held in Iraq and satisfying U.N. inspectors that
all weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
<p>
   Keating predicted that the U.N. Special Commission monitoring
Iraq's weapons programs could conceivably report by March that Iraq
had met the disarmament requirements for lifting the sanctions.
Under the cease-fire terms, Iraq must eliminate its nuclear,
chemical, biological and long-range missile weapons programs.
<p>
   Political recognition will allow Iraq and Kuwait to talk
directly, potentially clearing up the issues of prisoners and
property plundered during the Iraqi occupation.

PGA Head Pulls Away From New Golf Tour
EDS: UPDATES with Golf Sponsors reaction

<p>
   Even before FOX-TV's new golf tour is officially announced, U.S.
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem has made a move to oppose it.
<p>
   Finchem said Tuesday that U.S. PGA Tour members won't be allowed
to play on the new tour, which is being put together by Fox
Broadcasting and Executive Sports.
<p>
   The new tour would consist of about eight tournaments of 30 to
40 players each and would conflict some weekends with PGA Tour
events.
<p>
   ``Over the past few years, the PGA Tour has had discussions with
other golf organizations about a series of events that could be
scheduled in addition to the various international tour
schedules,'' Finchem said.
<p>
   However, he said any project aimed at boosting international
play must benefit golf, have the support of all golf organizations
and produce a ``positive impact'' on the current tours.
<p>
   ``In our view,'' Finchem said, ``the proposal from Fox and
Executive Sports as we understand it, fails to meet any of these
criteria.''
<p>
   The PGA European Tour Wednesday also announced its opposition to
the proposed tour.
<p>
   ``There has to be serious concern over any attempt to undermine
the essential elements of Tour jurisdiction,'' Ken Schofield,
executive director of the European tour, said in Virginia Water,
England.
<p>
   Schofield said he agrees with Finchem that the Fox project
``would have a negative impact on existing events and result in
fewer playing opportunities for Tour members.''
<p>
   The American Golf Sponsors issued a statement calling the
proposed series ``antithetical to the spirit of competition'' and
said it was ``an attempt to buy the players through minimum
guarantees which serves as appearance fees.''
<p>
   ``We expect the PGA Tour and its policy board to take every
action to fulfill their contractual obligations to our constituents
to provide a representative field at every PGA Tour event,'' the
statement said.
<p>
   Fox Sports media director Vince Wladika said, ``We are in
discussion with Executive Sports regarding a new golf proposal that
was brought to us by Executive Sports.''
<p>
   Officials of Executive Sports, a long-established Delray Beach,
Fla., organization that manages and produces a number of
tournaments on the regular, senior and ladies' tours, were
unavailable for comment.
<p>
   In the idea comes to fruition, it would give the Fox network its
third major sports property. Fox outbid CBS for the rights to
National Football Conference games and plans to regularly broadcast
National Hockey League games when  &MD;  and if  &MD;  the hockey season
begins.
<p>
   Greg Norman, long an outspoken proponent of a world tour for
golf's leading players, reportedly met with Executive Sports
officials Tuesday in Thousand Oaks, Calif., where his Shark
Shootout tournament will be held this weekend.
<p>
   The Australian star did not immediately return a phone call from
The Associated Press.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would draw harsh
international reaction, particularly after the United Nations eased
sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing in August to
stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other war material.
<p>
   Izetbegovic said rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter
attack on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, former stronghold of rebel
Muslim leader Fikret Abdic on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Yugoslav news media said Bosnian Serbs and Abdic troops had
entered Velika Kladusa, but there was no independent confirmation.
<p>
   The United Nations expressed scepticism about assertions of
Yugoslav involvement and major helicopter and tank assaults. Maj.
Koos Sol, a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said U.N. peacekeepers
``have nothing'' that would support massive intervention either by
Croatian Serbs or the Yugoslav army.
<p>
   Government statements of cross border involvement appeared
calculated to pressure the international community to act against
the Serb assaults.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after
toppling Abdic in August, sending his supporters fleeing into
Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Izetbegovic appealed to the Security Council on Wednesday to
take immediate action to halt a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb
forces on the Bihac area.
<p>
   He made the plea in a telephone call to the president of the
Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles).
<p>
   In Sarajevo, Izetbegovic criticized both the United Nations,
which has declared the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and
NATO, which has conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia
at U.N. behest, for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a
government-held northern city that is also a ``safe zone'' was
shelled for the third straight day Wednesday. One person died in
the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   Two missiles, apparently fired by Serbs, landed near Bangladeshi
peacekeepers in Cazin, within the pocket, and NATO warplanes flew
over the area but took no further action.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region nullified gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. But
gains remained elsewhere  &MD;  in a coordinated attack with Croat
allies two weeks ago, the government army took the Serb-held town
of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Congressional Delay Would Kill Trade Treaty, Gore Says
Eds: UPDATES with Gore comments.
By DAVE SKIDMORE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Putting off until next year a vote on a new
world trade accord would mean ``a death sentence for the biggest
tax cut in the history of the world,'' Vice President Al Gore said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Gore, at a news conference on Capitol Hill, urged Congress to
act this year on the trade pact under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), saying it was a ``critical vote for U.S.
leadership in the world and a critical vote for the health of the
U.S. economy.''
<p>
   He said putting off a vote until next year, as some in Congress
have proposed, would result in dlrs 70 billion in lost economic
growth and ``would mean the death of the GATT, pure and simple.''
<p>
   Gore said the reduction of tariffs worldwide was the equivalent
of a dlrs 744 billion tax cut.
<p>
   White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said delay would be
fatal to passage because fast track legislation that requires
Congress to vote on the agreement without amendments ends this
year, and putting off debate until next year would open the door
for legislative obstacles.
<p>
   Earlier Wednesday, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he
is ``very, very concerned'' about the prospects of the lame-duck
Democratic Senate passing a new world trade accord.
<p>
   Gingrich told reporters he remains personally committed to
passing the pact but that the White House ``needs to agree'' to
concerns expressed by Sen. Bob Dole.
<p>
   Dole, the soon-to-be majority leader, has said he favors steps
to make sure the new World Trade Organization, which would referee
trade disputes, wouldn't amount to a surrender of U.S. sovereignty.
<p>
   He has said he is predisposed to support the accord, but wants
Clinton to endorse separate legislation early next year that will
strengthen the United States ability to withdraw from it if U.S.
sovereignty becomes compromised.
<p>
   Gingrich's remarks came a day after Republican Sen. Jesse Helms,
incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hinted
he will hinder the administration's foreign policy initiatives
unless President Clinton agrees to postpone a vote on the accord,
negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<p>
   Panetta was asked Wednesday if he was worried that Helms would
block action on GATT and said, ``No, not at all. He's opposed trade
agreements in the past ... I don't suspect that this threat is
going to change any votes.''
<p>
   In a letter to the president released Tuesday, Helms, said the
GATT pact does not have to be ``raced through a lame-duck session
of the U.S. Senate on a very unwise `fast-track schedule.'''
<p>
   Votes on GATT are scheduled Nov. 29 in the House and Dec. 1 in
the Senate. Clinton has called on Republicans to support the pact,
initiated during the Reagan presidency, as evidence of their
willingness to cooperate with his administration.
<p>
   GATT supporters fear postponement would doom the accord because
special fast-track rules that protect it from being amended expire
at the end of this year.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a prominent investment banker cautioned Congress that
rejection of GATT  &MD;  or even postponement of congressional votes  &MD; 
would shake world financial markets and send interest rates higher.
<p>
   ``Financial markets are now totally committed to open trade and
investment. Any signal that carries with it a threat to
international cooperation is bound to have serious consequences,''
Felix G. Rohatyn told the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday.
<p>
   Rohatyn said rejection of GATT would further pressure a dollar
already trading near record lows against the Japanese yen and
German mark.
<p>
   ``This not only could mean a lower dollar and a lower stock
market, but higher mortgage rates, higher auto loan rates and lower
home equity values,'' he said.
<p>
   Rohatyn's testimony came during the eighth and last hearing on
GATT conducted by an ardent opponent of the pact, Democratic Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings.
<p>
   Hollings used his chairmanship of the Commerce Committee in
October to delay the Senate vote on GATT.

Conscript and His Dog Pack Kicked Out Of Army
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  Norwegian conscript Olaf Lingjaerde's
military career went to the dogs. Literally.
<p>
   The 22-year-old and his eight sled dogs were kicked out the army
after 93 days, after defense officials decided they couldn't afford
to feed the pack anymore, the military magazine Defense Forum
reported Wednesday.
<p>
   When Lingjaerde was called in for his compulsory military
service, he tried to get a deferment to take care of his
dependents: eight sled-racing Huskies.
<p>
   The draft board had no sympathy.
<p>
   ``In fact, I was advised to put my dogs to sleep,'' he told the
magazine.
<p>
   But one army base, in Norway's arctic Sor-Varanger County,
offered to take on Lingjaerde and his pals, even promising to build
a kennel and help care for the animals, the report said.
<p>
   In exchange, the new private was to give fellow recruits rides
all winter.
<p>
   When Lingjaerde couldn't afford to feed the dogs on his meager
military stipend, the Sor-Varanger Garrison took over and ended up
paying 50,000 kroner (dlrs 7,500) on the kennel, supplies and food,
Defense Forum reported.
<p>
   Trying to cut back, the army first told Lingjaerde to put his
dogs on a diet, with little success.
<p>
   Finally, the magazine said, the Norwegian Supreme Defense
Command decided enough was enough. It discharged the whole lot  &MD; 
man and dogs  &MD;  as of this autumn.

Report: Chinese Swimming Tests Positive For Steroids
Eds: UPDATES with FINA official confirming positive test, edits
throughout; Adds byline
By LARRY SIDDONS
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  A Chinese swimming world champion tested
positive for steroids and several teammates have shown traces of
drugs, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   Yang Aihua, who won the women's 400-meter freestyle at the World
Swimming Championships last September, flunked a random drug test
administered by FINA, swimming's international governing body,
according to Dr. Alan Richardson, a member of the federation's
medical commission.
<p>
   ``We did out-of-competition testing and Yang Aihua tested
positive for steroids,'' Richardson said in a telephone interview
from his Honolulu office. ``We have recommended that FINA impose
the appropriate sanctions.''
<p>
   Yang would be banned for two years, knocking her out of the
Atlanta Olympics.
<p>
   Richardson said Yang was among about 30 swimmers from several
nations tested on short notice just before the Asian Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, last month.
<p>
   He confirmed that urine samples of several other Chinese
swimmers also detected drugs. But he said authorities were not sure
whether these ``were banned substances or occurred naturally,'' and
were not prepared to declare them positive tests.
<p>
   Yang's positive test result and the presense of drugs in the
samples of other swimmers were first reported in Wednesday's
Chicago Tribune, which quoted anonymous sources.
<p>
   Richardson said Yang's sample showed greatly elevated levels of
testosterone, a male hormone.
<p>
   ``Some measurements show the level of 9-1, but others show it
15-1,'' he said. ``Either one is well above the limit. I don't
there's a question that it's positive.''
<p>
   A man must produce a testosterone-epitestoserone ratio or 6-1 or
higher to be declared positive for steroids.
<p>
   FINA officials said they had not received the test results and
would not comment until they were in hand.
<p>
   FINA, the international swimming federation, has not announced
Yang's test results for ``political reasons,'' the Tribune quoted
sources as saying. That appeared to be a reference to statements
last month by International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch that he was sure Chinese swimmers were drug-free.
<p>
   Gunnar Werner, FINA's secretary, said from Karlstadt, Sweden,
that the results were expected ``any day now'' and would be
announced ``as soon as it is official.''
<p>
   Drug tests usually take 4-5 days to complete and analyze. The
Asian Games ended a month ago. Richardson said the tests were
delayed until a Chinese official could be present for the second
portion of the two-part process but still said the lab in Tokyo was
``dragging its feet'' in getting the final results out.
<p>
   The Chinese swimming program has been dogged by rumors of drug
use since it started rolling up gold medals and world records in
1988. In recent years, Chinese women have dominated the sport, and
at the last world championships in Rome in September Yang and her
teammates won 12 of 16 titles and set five world records. All of
the winner passed drug tests in Rome.
<p>
   The rout was so thorough that coaches and team directors from
the United States and 17 other nations signed a petition asking
FINA to tighten doping controls. It was then that the random
testing began.
<p>
   Chinese coaches and officials have steadfastly denied using
illegal drugs in their programs, saying the astounding results have
been produced by innovative training in a group of top athletes
plucked from a population of more than one billion people.
<p>
   Yang is the fifth Chinese woman swimmer to flunk a FINA drug
test in the past two years  &MD;  matching the total of swimmers from
other countries that have been found positive in doping tests by
the federation in the last 22 years.
<p>
   Yang is the fourth Chinese woman to test positive for steroids,
which help build muscle bulk and allow the body to rebound faster
from workouts and injury.

Communists Take Early Lead in Nepal Parliamentary Vote
Eds: LEADS with seven grafs to UPDATE with ruling party in danger
of losing governing role in parliament, prime minister to come from
majority party.
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance took an early lead
in parliamentary elections over the centrist party that has
governed the country since 1991, winning 20 of the 30 seats whose
results were announced Wednesday.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala won from Sunsari, 180
kilometers southeast of Katmandu, defeating his Communist rival by
nearly 9,000 votes. He was also leading in a second constituency
but his party is in danger of losing its governing role in
Parliament.
<p>
   Of the partial results released Wednesday, Koirala's Nepali
Congress won just six of the seats, and a pro-monarchy group three.
The remaining seat went to an independent.
<p>
   The Communists' promise to institute land reforms and break up
large holdings has wide appeal in this mountainous agricultural
country sandwiched between India and China.
<p>
   The prime minister's government has been discredited because of
Nepal's weak economy, playing into the Communists' hopes to come to
power in parliament.
<p>
   ``It's a positive trend. We are hopeful that we will have a
comfortable majority (in parliament),'' said Madhav Kumar,
secretary-general of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxist-Leninist).
<p>
   If so, the winning party will select a new prime minister to
replace Koirala.
<p>
   Some 2,000 jubilant Communist supporters chanting anti-Koirala
slogans marched through the capital celebrating the victory of all
their seven candidates in Katmandu. The victors included the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) chairman, Manmohan
Adhikari.
<p>
   Final results of the elections will not be declared for a week
because the election commission had ordered a recount in 64 polling
stations in 33 constituencies after Tuesday's voting was marred by
violence.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
following a popular uprising.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months ahead of
schedule.

<TEXT>
<p>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP)  &MD;  Bulgaria defeated Moldova 4-1 (1-0) in an
European Championship qualifying game Wednesday.
<p>
   It took the Bulgarians, supported by 40,000 fans, almost 45
minutes to open the score.
<p>
   Despite their clear domination they spoiled nearly a dozen of
scoring chances in the first half-time.
<p>
   It was Barcelona's star forward Hristo Stoichkov who opened the
score in the 45th minute. He shot from the left corner of the
penalty area and from the foot of defender Valeriu Pogorelov the
ball went into the net.
<p>
   The equalizer came in the 59th minute, when Moldova's best
player Sergiu Cleschenco took advantage of the only mistake of
goalie Mihailov and pushed the ball in the empty goal.
<p>
   Krasimir Balakov gave the Bulgarians a 2-1 lead with a free kick
from 16 meters.
<p>
   Hristo Stoichkov took the ball in the 85th minute almost from
the center of the field and scored from some 8 meters (yards) to
3-1.
<p>
   Emil Kostadinov came on in the 87th minute for Bulgaria. Showing
his brilliant technique, he lifted the ball over goalie Vasile
Coshelev to set the 4-1 final score.
<p>
   The visitors had some good chances in the last minutes to reduce
the gap but couldn't capitalize.
<p>
   Bulgaria's coach, Dimitar Penev, deployed most of the same
players he led to fourth place in the World Cup.
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
<p>
   Bulgaria: Borislav Mihailov, Ilian Kiryakov, Trifon Ivanov,
Tsanko Tsvetanov, Petar Hubchev, Ivailo Yordanov, Yordan Lechkov
(Stanimir Stoilov, 86th minute), Emil Kostadinov, Hristo Stoichkov,
Lyuboslav Penev (Nasko Sirakov, 80th minute), Krasimir Balakov.
<p>
   Moldova: Vasile Coselev, Serghei Stroenco, Sergiu Secu, Sergiu
Nani, Valeriu Pogorelov, Sergei Belous, Radu Rebeja, Sandu Curtianu

BC-US-Tourist Murder, 3rd Ld-Writethru,0739
Teen-Ager Denies Killing British Tourist
By ADAM YEOMANS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MONTICELLO, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  A teen-ager accused of murdering a
British tourist last year in North Florida testified Wednesday that
he was asleep at home when the crime occurred.
<p>
   John ``Billy Joe'' Crumitie, 17, took the stand to counter
testimony from prosecution witnesses who said he was one of the
gunmen in a robbery attempt that went awry and resulted in the
fatal shooting of Gary Colley on Sept. 14, 1993.
<p>
   The killing of Colley  &MD;  the ninth foreign visitor killed in
Florida within a year  &MD;  damaged the state's dlrs 31 billion tourism
business. It spurred authorities to post 24-hour guards at highway
rest stops and make major reforms in the state's juvenile justice
system.
<p>
   When asked by defense lawyer Mina Morgan whether he shot anyone
or tried to rob anyone that night, Crumitie said, ``No ma'am.''
<p>
   Crumitie was the only witness to testify for the defense.
Closing arguments from both sides were set for Thursday.
<p>
   Another youth charged in the crime testified earlier Wednesday
that he and his friends decided to steal a car and rob someone
because they needed some money.
<p>
   But the plan fell apart when Colley tried to get away from the
youths at a rest stop on Interstate 10 near Monticello, said Deron
Spear, the 18-year-old driver of the getaway car.
<p>
   ``The man tried to back up and he ran into our car,'' said
Spear, who testified for the prosecution. ``That's when everybody
started firing.''
<p>
   One of the bullets hit Colley, 34, in the neck, killing him. His
longtime companion, Margaret Jagger, was wounded.
<p>
   Spear testified against Crumitie under a plea bargain agreement.
Crumitie is charged with first-degree murder and first-degree
attempted murder.
<p>
   Spear said he, Crumitie and Aundra Akins were sitting around in
September 1993 when they decided to commit a robbery.
<p>
   ``We was just talking we had no money and stuff,'' said Spear.
``We been talking we need to rob somebody.''
<p>
   Spear said he and Akins, 15, got handguns they had and the three
youths stole a car. They then drove to the highway rest area near
Monticello where they found Colley and Jagger in the early morning
hours of Sept. 14, 1993.
<p>
   When Colley tried to back up the couple's rental car to escape,
Crumitie and Akins began firing their guns, Spear said.
<p>
   Spear said they fled in their stolen car and eventually ditched
it in a muddy area near the low-income apartment complex where they
lived.
<p>
   Spear's testimony concluded the prosecution's case.
<p>
   Another key prosecution witness testified that Crumitie admitted
he was involved in the slaying.
<p>
   ``I asked him if he knew anything about it. He laughed and said
yes,'' said Thaddeus Crumitie, a distant cousin of the defendant.
<p>
   Thaddeus Crumitie, 19, who is serving a four-year prison term
for an unrelated robbery, said he gave his cousin, Akins and Spear
a ride the same night that Colley was slain.
<p>
   The witness testified that the three youths said they were
``going on a mission'' to steal a car and rob someone.
<p>
   John Crumitie's lawyer, Dwight Wells, questioned the credibility
of Spear and the other informants because they had cut their own
deals with authorities for crimes they had been charged with.
<p>
   Prosecutors did not present any physical evidence linking John
Crumitie with the stolen car or the murder.
<p>
   Spear, Akins and another youth also were charged with
first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder. Spear and
his half-brother, 14-year-old Cedrick Green, have pleaded to lesser
charges and are awaiting sentencing.
<p>
   Green was not present during the robbery attempt, Spear said.
Green pleaded no contest to a charge of accessory after the fact.
<p>
   Spear pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy to commit armed
robbery and accessory after the fact. He faces a maximum of 10
years in prison under the plea bargain. Akins' trial date has not
been set.
<p>
   Jagger, 36, testified Tuesday that the couple were on vacation
from their home in West Yorkshire, England, and were driving from
New Orleans to St. Petersburg. They had stopped for a brief nap
shortly after 1 a.m. when the gunmen approached their car.
<p>
   If convicted of murder, John Crumitie faces a life sentence with
a mandatory 25 years without parole.

Becker, Chang, Edberg Post Victories
Eds: UPDATES with Edberg's victory over Ivanisevic
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  &MD;  In a clash of past champions, Boris
Becker produced one of the best matches of his already impressive
year and frustrated top-ranked Pete Sampras with a 7-5, 7-5 victory
Wednesday at the IBM/ATP Tour World Championship.
<p>
   Becker posted his second straight win over the No. 1 in the
world and raised his round-robin record at the dlrs 3-million
tournament to 2-0.
<p>
   ``He was just too good, that's the best I've seen him play
against me,'' Sampras said after his loss in one hour, 43 minutes.
<p>
   ``I really didn't have any chances.''
<p>
   Earlier, Michael Chang crushed Alberto Berasategui 6-1, 6-0.
Berasategui, who has won three games in two matches, said he was
suffering from a wrist injury and only played to protect his
ranking.
<p>
   Stefan Edberg, No. 8, made a successful start by beating
fourth-ranked Goran Ivanisevic 6-3, 6-4.
<p>
   Sampras now has to beat Edberg Thursday to stay alive.
Ivanisevic, 0-2, a semifinalist the last two years, was eliminated.
<p>
   Ivanisevic had 26 aces in losing to Becker Tuesday, but he
managed only 6 against Edberg. The Swede had only 3, but also made
a lot less errors in the 57-minute match.
<p>
   Becker also beat Sampras en route to lifting the Stockholm Open
in the last week of October and is now 5-5 against the American in
his career.
<p>
   ``I don't know if it was my best match against him, but it was
definitely one of my best of the year for me,'' said the German,
who outaced Sampras 15-11.
<p>
   Becker won the tour-ending championship of the top eight players
in the world in 1992, but failed to qualify last year after
dropping out of the top 10.
<p>
   He is back at No. 5 now, after winning four titles this year.
<p>
   ``I would say 1992 was the last year when I was able to play
well against top players all the year,'' said Becker, who beat
Ivanisevic Tuesday.
<p>
   He is in his element in Frankfurt's Festhalle, where he
celebrated his 25th birthday on the day he won the 1992 title and
where he is cheered by 9,000 adoring fans every time he plays.
<p>
   ``It is definitely something that makes even more eager to play,
it makes me try just a little harder because they support me so
much and they expect so much of me and I don't want to let them
down,'' Becker said.
<p>
   With 13 indoor titles since its inception in 1990, Becker leads
the ATP Tour.
<p>
   ``He is a much better player indoor,'' said Sampras, who leads
the tour with nine titles this year. An ankle injury slowed him in
the summer, but he came into the tournament straight form winning
in Antwerp.
<p>
   Becker broke Sampras for decisive 6-5 leads in each set and
never dropped his own serve.
<p>
   Becker hit two aces in the last game with second serves, the
last one giving him three match points. He missed the first serve
but clinched the match when Sampras returned his second serve to
the net.
<p>
   ``He was hitting his second serves as hard as his first. I had
two break points (in the entire match) and I didn't get a racket in
his serve, he hit two aces,'' Sampras said.
<p>
   ``I'm not out of it, but it's not a good start, I'll have to win
the other two matches,'' said Sampras, who won here in 1991.
<p>
   The eight players are split into two round-robin groups, with
the top two from each advancing to the semifinals.
<p>
   Becker, Sampras, Ivanisevic and Edberg are in one group, while
Chang, Berasategui, Andre Agassi and Sergi Bruguera are in the
other. Agassi and Bruguera, who are both 1-0, were idle Wednesday.
<p>
   Chang, the No. 6 who lost to Bruguera Tuesday, needed only 47
minutes to beat Berasategui and even his record to 1-1.
<p>
   The Spaniard blamed the wrist injury for his poor performance.
``Maybe Michael would have beaten me, but I don't think it would
have been 6-1, 6-0.''
<p>
   Berasategui said he played only because he was worried about
losing his ranking.
<p>
   Winner of seven clay-court titles this year, Berasategui is No.
7 in the world, although he usually skips other surfaces.
<p>
   Had he pulled out, Michael Stich, who is No. 9 in the world,
would have replaced him and, under new rules, might have earned
enough points to vault over Berasategui in the rankings.
<p>
   Under old rules, alternate players did not earn points if they
were asked to replace a sick or injured player once the tournament
had started.
<p>
   Agassi beat Berasategui 6-2, 6-0 Tuesday in 45 minutes and later
criticized the ranking system that allows one-surface players to
accumulate enough points to qualify for the finale.
<p>
   In other matches Thursday, Agassi plays Chang and Bruguera meets
Berasategui.

Irish Coalition Partner Pulling Out of Government
EDS: AMs UPDATES with Labor pulling out of coalition, Reynolds
regrets appointment and accuses Whelehan of misrepresentation
By ROBERT BARR
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  The Irish government neared collapse
Wednesday as the junior partner in the coalition announced it was
pulling out.
<p>
   ``Neither I nor any of my colleagues can vote confidence in this
government,'' said Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister, foreign
minister and leader of the Labor Party.
<p>
   Spring said he was resigning from his government post
immediately and so were the other Labor ministers.
<p>
   Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was expected to seek a national
election following a confidence vote scheduled for Thursday night,
which would leave him without a majority, shorn of Labor's support.
But President Mary Robinson could give other parties the chance to
form a new government, rather than call an election.
<p>
   Reynolds earlier said he regretted a controversial judicial
appointment that led to Labor's walkout from the Cabinet on Friday.
<p>
   Reynolds said he had recieved new information that Harry
Whelehan, a former attorney general who was appointed president of
the High Court, had misled the Cabinet about an extradition case.
Had he known last week, Reynolds said, he would not have pressed
ahead with Whelehan's appointment.
<p>
   Spring said he decided to vote against Reynolds on the
confidence motion after he learned this morning that Reynolds had
been informed of the discrepancies on Monday but had not mentioned
them in his speech to Parliament on Tuesday.
<p>
   Reynolds had indicated that he had been informed of the matter
by the new attorney general but had not had time to comprehend the
implications before addressing the Parliament.
<p>
   Labor lawmakers were not satisfied last week with Reynolds'
explanation of why the attorney general's office had taken no
action for seven months the case of the Rev. Brendan Smyth, a
Catholic priest wanted for child sexual abuse in Northern Ireland.
<p>
   Opening a debate on a motion of confidence on Wednesday,
Reynolds said Whelehan had been incorrect in telling the Cabinet
that a request for Smyth's extradition had been the first test of a
new provision in the extradition law. Whelehan reportedly said it
took a long time to process the extradition because it was the
first time the department had had to deal with this provision.
<p>
   As amended in 1987, the law bars extradition if there has been a
long delay since the time of the offense. The charges against the
priest involved cases as long ago as the 1960s, but as recently as
1988.
<p>
   Reynolds said he learned only this week that there has been a
case involving the same issue. He said Whelehan explained that he
had forgotten that case.
<p>
   Reynolds' speech followed an afternoon of delays and
increasingly wild rumors about new information that had been
discovered. It reached such a pitch that Cardinal Cahal Daley
issued a statement denying that he was in any way involved in the
extradition case.
<p>
   There were rumors that the church had exerted pressure in the
extradition case, an allegation vigorously denied Daley.
<p>
   Asked whether anyone in his office had made any approach to the
government, the Cardinal said in an interveiw with RTE, the state
broadcasting service, that it was ``utterly absurd, and it's a
total fabrication.''
<p>
   Reynolds had earlier hinted at new disclosures on ``a very
serious matter,'' but returned to the house in the afternoon to say
that no new information had been found.
<p>
   The prime minister has defended himself in part with the the
budding peace process in Northern Ireland, following the Irish
Republican Army cease-fire 10 weeks ago.
<p>
   He praised Spring for his contribution as foreign minister, and
told the Dail on Tuesday: ``It will be a great pity if a government
that is achieving rapid economic progress, that has achieved the
biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in over 25 years, and that
has a fine legislative program, should be placed in jeopardy over
misunderstandings surrounding a single judicial appointment.''
<p>
   Sinn Fein, the party allied to the IRA, has urged Spring and
Reynolds to resolve their differences. But Sinn Fein chairman
Mitchel (cq) McLaughlin said Tuesday the party was prepared to work
with any party in government.
<p>
   ``The peace process is in no danger from a change of
government,'' said Mary Harney, leader of the small Progressive
Democratic party. She said all parties were committed to promoting
peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

Finland Wins 5-0 In European Championship Qualifier
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP)  &MD;  Jari Litmanen and Mika-Matti
Paatelainen scored two goals each as Finland beat the Faeroe
Islands 5-0 (1-0) Wednesday in a Group 8 European soccer
championship qualifier. 
<p>
   Finland took its first points while the Faeroes lost their
third game in a row.
<p>
   Striker Antti Sumiala, of Ikast, Denmark, scored the opener
after 36 minutes, receiving a pass outside the penalty area and
firing into the far corner.
<p>
   At 52 minutes, Litmanen converted a penalty after Tummas Eli
Hansen handled the ball on a header by Paatelainen. Hansen was
ejected for the foul.
<p>
   Litmanen, the Ajax Amsterdam star, scored the third goal in the
72nd, racing through on the left and shooting accurately into the
far side.
<p>
   Two minutes later, Paatelainen made it 4-0 with a hard dipping
shot with his left from 20 meters. The Bolton Wanderers striker
added another goal from close range at 85 minutes.
<p>
   Finland dominated the game, but had a scare in the beginning as
Magni Jarnskor headed from close-in, but keeper Kari Laukkanen
tipped the ball over the crossbar. Laukkanen, who plays for Waldhof
Mannheim in the German second division, also blocked a solo run
from Henning Jarnskor 10 minutes into the second half.
<p>
   Finland: Kari Laukkanen - Markku Kanerva - Janne Makela, Anders
Eriksson - Petri Helin, Kari Ukkonen, Jari Litmanen, Ari Hjelm,
Janne Lindberg (Marko Rajamaki, 78th minute) - Antti Sumiala (Jukka
Ruhanen, 92nd), Mika-Matti Paatelainen.
<p>
   Faeroe Islands: Jens Martin Knudsen - Oli Johannesen - Janus
Rasmussen, Tummas Eli Hansen (Jens Erik Rasmussen, 81st), Ossur
Hansen - Kurt Morkore, Henning Jarnskor, Magni Jarnskor, Djoni N.

Ukrainian Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new quotes, separate statement attached,
background, other new material; trims.

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Progress in worldwide nuclear arms
reduction got a major boost Wednesday with the Ukrainian
parliament's long-awaited approval of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The action, on a 301-8 vote, puts the world's third-largest
nuclear power firmly on the road to total disarmament. The former
Soviet republic of 52 million people now must be nuclear-free by
around the turn of the century.
<p>
   Coming after months of intense lobbying by the international
community, especially the United States, it also is a significant
step in strengthening ties with the West.
<p>
   New President Leonid Kuchma, spurred on by Western support for
his economic reforms program, had staked a great deal of his
political credibility on steering the treaty through an often
recalcitrant parliament.
<p>
   ``It's the first time in history that a state that owns nuclear
weapons is voluntarily giving them up,'' Kuchma said after the
vote.
<p>
   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and around
1,800 nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   The nation has dismantled an estimated 400 of the warheads and
sent them to Russia as part of an agreement among Washington,
Moscow and Kiev. But it had hesitated in ratifying the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Officials cited insufficient financial
compensation and a lack of security guarantees.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told legislators before the
vote, however, that after months of negotiations the United States,
Britain and Russia had provided satisfactory guarantees hours
earlier. France will provide a similar assurance later, he said.
<p>
   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for
Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He stressed that
they included assurances against Ukraine being attacked by both
nuclear and conventional weapons together with substantial
financial support from the West.
<p>
   Kuchma, a former missile plant director, has portrayed
possession of the weapons  &MD;  which Ukraine has no capability to
launch  &MD;  as a profound liability.
<p>
   ``Experts estimate it will cost 10 billion to 30 billion dollars
a year to keep nuclear weapons,'' he told legislators. ``It means
we have to sell all our possessions to keep them.''
<p>
   Despite the one-sided vote, parliament attached a statement
insisting on special conditions for Ukraine, such as the right to
reuse equipment from dismantled missiles for civilian purposes.
<p>
   Oleh Vitovich, an ultranationalist who voted against the pact,
said: ``The decision has erased any future prospect of Ukraine
being a great nation.''
<p>
   A number of lawmakers voiced concern about the delicate
post-Soviet relationship between Ukraine and its powerful Eastern
neighbor, Russia.
<p>
   ``How do we can we trust Russia when it lays claim to (the
Ukrainian port of) Sevastopol?'' legislators shouted during the
debate.
<p>
   Responding, Udovenko read a short statement from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin which contained security guarantees
``recognizing the inviolability of Ukraine's territorial
integrity.''
<p>
   Both Kuchma and the United States were pushing for the treaty to
be accepted by legislators before his visit to Washington next
week.
<p>
   In Washington, where he's helping prepare for Kuchma's trip,
Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeri Shmarov said the vote was made
possible by assurances President Clinton gave Kiev last January
that its sovereignty and borders would be safeguarded.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as
``a major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed
by the new nations.'' He also said it clears the way for Ukraine to
have ``normal, strengthened relations with the U.S.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S.
export restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic
equipment and remove a Russian condition for its implementation of
the START-1 strategic nuclear treaty.
<p>
   Final adoption will take place Dec. 5 or 6 at a meeting of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma
said. It becomes official when the four signatories of the
memorandum on Ukraine's security guarantees will exchange documents
with Ukrainian officials.

Jewish Settlers Holding On Tight Despite Government Pressure

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP)  &MD;  Hostile eyes followed Jewish settler
Noam Federman as he pushed the double stroller with his two
toddlers past the Palestinian vegetable market.
<p>
   Federman, a leader of the anti-Arab Kach group that seeks to
drive Arabs from the West Bank, said he'd never leave Hebron even
though he claims Palestinian militants have taken a contract out on
him.
<p>
   ``God will take care of us,'' said his wife, Elisheva, walking
beside him.
<p>
   But perhaps Israel's government no longer will.
<p>
   The 450 settlers are a major source of friction in the Arab city
of 80,000 and a key obstacle to expanding Palestinian self-rule in
the West Bank.
<p>
   A majority is emerging in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Cabinet
for dismantling isolated and difficult-to-protect settlements soon.
<p>
   That just makes the settlers dig in deeper.
<p>
   They believe they are fulfilling God's will by living near the
Tomb of the Patriarchs where tradition holds Abraham, Sarah, Issac
and Jacob were buried.
<p>
   They see themselves as the last bulwark against handing the
biblical Land of Israel to the Palestinians, who under the
Israel-PLO accord are slated to gain autonomy here once elections
are held for a self-rule council.
<p>
   ``We are Jews, and this is our place,'' said the Wisconsin-born
Mrs. Federman, 22, as she nursed her 2-month-old son, David. ``We
are doing what God expects us to do, even if it's not always
comfortable.''
<p>
   Mrs. Federman lives at Beit Hadassah with 25 families in one of
a half-dozen outposts in Hebron. Wire mesh covers her windows to
keep out stones and bottles thrown by Palestinians. Army guards
with assault rifles are posted on her doorstep.
<p>
   Hebron settlers claim that since the Feb. 25 mosque massacre  &MD; 
in which U.S. immigrant settler Baruch Goldstein killed 29 Muslim
worshipers  &MD;  Israeli troops have tried to weaken their resolve to
stay in Hebron.
<p>
   A photograph of Goldstein, a member of Kach who was clubbed to
death after his ammunition ran out, takes up the place of honor on
the TV set in Mrs. Federman's living room.
<p>
   ``He was a man we had very high esteem for,'' explained Mrs.
Federman.
<p>
   Settlers defending Goldstein claim he sowed fear among
Palestinians and thus deterred further attacks on Jews.
<p>
   On a recent morning, the Federmans, pushing the stroller with
David and their 2-year-old daughter Sapir, walked from Beit
Hadassah to the Avraham Avinu compound some 500 yards (meters) down
the road to attend a Brit Mila, or ritual circumcision for boys
when they are eight days old.
<p>
   Dozens of guests mingled in the courtyard. Men were dressed in
white shirts and black pants. Women wore hats and ankle-length
dresses.
<p>
   When Kach leader Baruch Marzel arrived, carrying a baby in a
basket, he was slapped on his back and greeted warmly.
<p>
   ``I'm on my way to the dentist,'' Marzel joked. Like Federman,
he is fresh out of jail and confined by authorities to his trailer
home except for special occasions such as medical treatment.
<p>
   Anat Cohen, 33, who was detained a month ago on charges of
insulting a police officer, said Rabin's government is persecuting
the settlers.
<p>
   ``The police commanders are trying to indoctrinate their men
that the Arabs are the friends, and we are the enemies,'' Mrs.
Cohen said.
<p>
   Settlers fear the government will try to evacuate them and vow
to resist, although they are vague on whether they would actually
fight fellow Israelis.
<p>
   ``They might have to kill me first. They would take away my
soul, not only my house,'' said Einat Noked, 23, who lives in a
three-room apartment at Beit Hadassah, a former hospital built by
Jewish philanthropists at the turn of the century.
<p>
   Beit Hadassah and much of the Hebron Jewish community was
evacuated after the 1929 riots in which Arabs killed 67 Jews. In
1979, 12 years after Israel captured the West Bank, about a dozen
women moved back to Beit Hadassah.
<p>
   Inside the enclave, life seems ordinary.
<p>
   The smell of cooked cabbage wafted through the entry hall where
a bulletin board offered evening classes in Torah, martial arts,
folk dancing and drawing.
<p>
   ``We have something special here that I didn't find in any other
place,'' said Noked. ``There is a great tranquility here.''
<p>
   But the violence of the Arab-Jewish conflict is never far.
<p>
   Last month, Mrs. Federman's 3-year-old daughter Yiska witnessed
how a Palestinian tried to stab a settler and was shot to death by
soldiers.
<p>
   ``It is part of her life. She always hears that people are
stabbed and killed.''

New Study Says Exercise Is Like Money  &MD;  The More You Get, the
Better

<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS (AP)  &MD;  It's true that a regular stroll in the park can
make your heart healthier. But the latest evidence suggests that
exercise is like money  &MD;  the more you get, the better.
<p>
   In the first study of the heart-disease risks of a large group
of serious runners, researchers found that the benefits of exercise
continue to climb even at the most intense levels of exercise.
<p>
   Runners who logged 40 miles (64 kilometers) a week, for example,
had a lower heart disease risk than runners who covered 30 miles
(48 kilometers) a week.
<p>
   Current U.S. government regulations emphasize moderate exercise
for sedentary people but don't emphasize the continued benefits for
more serious exercise enthusiasts.
<p>
   As a result, some serious exercisers may be discouraged from
continuing, believing they are not getting any additional benefits,
said the study's author, Paul Williams, a researcher at the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.
<p>
   He discussed the findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the
American Heart Association.
<p>
   Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
sports-medicine specialists recommended that every American get 30
minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.
<p>
   Williams said that's an excellent suggestion for the 78 percent
of Americans who engage in little or no physical activity. But the
statement seemed to suggest that more intense exercise had little
benefit.
<p>
   Peter Wood of Stanford University, another authority on exercise
and heart disease, agreed with Williams that that's simply not
true.
<p>
   Many of the risk factors for heart disease  &MD;  including body fat,
cholesterol, blood pressure and triglycerides  &MD;  continue to improve
with more intense exercise, Wood said.
<p>
   ``Certainly we don't want to dissuade people who do nothing from
doing something,'' Wood said. ``But we don't want to shortchange
people who do a lot.''
<p>
   In a study of nearly 7,000 male runners recruited from the
readers of Runner's World magazine, Williams found, for example,
that 12 percent of runners who covered less than 10 miles (16
kilometers) per week had dangerously low levels of good
cholesterol. But that was true of only 2 percent of runners who ran
40 to 49 miles (64 to 78 kilometers) per week.
<p>
   Levels of good cholesterol climbed in a direct relationship with
the number of miles that runners covered each week, he found. Total
cholesterol also dropped with increasing mileage. And an indicator
of body weight likewise declined.
<p>
   ``People ask how much is enough,'' Wood said. ``I always say
it's like money: The more, the better.''
<p>
   The study included no women, and it would be hard to translate
the results to females because of the physical differences between
the sexes, Williams said. A study of women is expected to be
finished next year.

Ukrainian Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new quotes, separate statement attached,
background, other new material; trims.

<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Progress in worldwide nuclear arms
reduction got a major boost Wednesday with the Ukrainian
parliament's long-awaited approval of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The action, on a 301-8 vote, puts the world's third-largest
nuclear power firmly on the road to total disarmament. The former
Soviet republic of 52 million people now must be nuclear-free by
around the turn of the century.
<p>
   Coming after months of intense lobbying by the international
community, especially the United States, it also is a significant
step in strengthening ties with the West.
<p>
   New President Leonid Kuchma, spurred on by Western support for
his economic reforms program, had staked a great deal of his
political credibility on steering the treaty through an often
recalcitrant parliament.
<p>
   ``It's the first time in history that a state that owns nuclear
weapons is voluntarily giving them up,'' Kuchma said after the
vote.
<p>
   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and around
1,800 nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   The nation has dismantled an estimated 400 of the warheads and
sent them to Russia as part of an agreement among Washington,
Moscow and Kiev. But it had hesitated in ratifying the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Officials cited insufficient financial
compensation and a lack of security guarantees.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told legislators before the
vote, however, that after months of negotiations the United States,
Britain and Russia had provided satisfactory guarantees hours
earlier. France will provide a similar assurance later, he said.
<p>
   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for
Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He stressed that
they included assurances against Ukraine being attacked by both
nuclear and conventional weapons together with substantial
financial support from the West.
<p>
   Kuchma, a former missile plant director, has portrayed
possession of the weapons  &MD;  which Ukraine has no capability to
launch  &MD;  as a profound liability.
<p>
   ``Experts estimate it will cost 10 billion to 30 billion dollars
a year to keep nuclear weapons,'' he told legislators. ``It means
we have to sell all our possessions to keep them.''
<p>
   Despite the one-sided vote, parliament attached a statement
insisting on special conditions for Ukraine, such as the right to
reuse equipment from dismantled missiles for civilian purposes.
<p>
   Oleh Vitovich, an ultranationalist who voted against the pact,
said: ``The decision has erased any future prospect of Ukraine
being a great nation.''
<p>
   A number of lawmakers voiced concern about the delicate
post-Soviet relationship between Ukraine and its powerful Eastern
neighbor, Russia.
<p>
   ``How do we can we trust Russia when it lays claim to (the
Ukrainian port of) Sevastopol?'' legislators shouted during the
debate.
<p>
   Responding, Udovenko read a short statement from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin which contained security guarantees
``recognizing the inviolability of Ukraine's territorial
integrity.''
<p>
   Both Kuchma and the United States were pushing for the treaty to
be accepted by legislators before his visit to Washington next
week.
<p>
   In Washington, where he's helping prepare for Kuchma's trip,
Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeri Shmarov said the vote was made
possible by assurances President Clinton gave Kiev last January
that its sovereignty and borders would be safeguarded.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as
``a major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed
by the new nations.'' He also said it clears the way for Ukraine to
have ``normal, strengthened relations with the U.S.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S.
export restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic
equipment and remove a Russian condition for its implementation of
the START-1 strategic nuclear treaty.
<p>
   Final adoption will take place Dec. 5 or 6 at a meeting of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Budapest, Hungary, Kuchma
said. It becomes official when the four signatories of the
memorandum on Ukraine's security guarantees will exchange documents
with Ukrainian officials.

Iranian Singer's Paris Concert Banned; She Vows Defiance
EDs: one name for Marzieh is cq.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  The Interior Ministry on Wednesday banned a concert
planned next month by an Iranian singer, contending she was being
used by an opposition group. The singer vowed to defy the ban.
<p>
   The singer, Marzieh, left Iran for France earlier this year,
complaining that her country's Islamic rulers had prohibited her
from performing since 1979 for political reasons.
<p>
   In a statement, she expressed shock at the Interior Ministry ban
and suggested it was issued under pressure from Iran.
<p>
   ``I cannot cancel a concert that was announced a month ago,''
she said. ``I call on France and all advocates of liberty and
freedom of artists not to allow the mullahs' wishes to come true.''
<p>
   The Interior Ministry said the concert, scheduled for Dec. 4 at
the Palais des Congress auditorium, was ``in reality a rally in
support of the Mujahedeen of the People''  &MD;  an Iranian opposition
group with armed units based in Iraq.
<p>
   The concern ``presents a threat to public order,'' the ministry
said.
<p>
   The Mujahedeen have an office in the Paris area. But Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua, elaborating on the ban, said political
exiles nonetheless have a duty to exercise restraint.
<p>
   Marzieh's associates in France said Iranian authorities have
attempted to put pressure on her by placing her daughter under
tight police controls. This allegation could not be confirmed.

Islamic Jihad: We Have 50 Willing To Die In Suicide Attacks
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM (AP)  &MD;  The militant Islamic Jihad faction has
recruited more than 50 volunteers to carry out suicide attacks ``in
any place in which there are Jews,'' a member of the group said
Wednesday.
<p>
   The group which calls itself the ``body bag gang,'' said the
Islamic Jihad member, who spoke to Israel TV's Second Channel in
the PLO-ruled Gaza Strip.
<p>
   He wore a white satin robe and hood reminiscent of Ku Klux Klan
outfits, and was flanked by three others dressed the same way.
<p>
   ``There is a group of more than 50 men who have sworn to fight,
even at the price of their lives,'' he said. ``Every...school or
hospital inside Israel, any place in which there are Jews, is a
target for a suicide action.''
<p>
   An Islamic Jihad follower last week bicycled into an army post
in the Gaza Strip and set off 10 kilos of explosives, killing
himself and three Israeli officers.
<p>
   On Wednesday, 45 Islamic Jihad followers were released from a
Gaza City jail after Palestinian police said they were not linked
to the group's military wing and Friday's suicide bombing.
<p>
   Police had rounded up scores of Islamic Jihad followers to find
those responsible for planning the attack. Some 115 remained in
jail Wednesday, though most of the group's leaders are at large,
including chief ideologue Abdallah Shami.
<p>
   In a statement sent to news agencies Wednesday, Islamic Jihad
said it would take revenge if its leaders were hurt.
<p>
   ``If any of our figures in the movement are harmed, the response
will be severe and so powerful that no one will expect it,'' the
statement said.
<p>
   It said Shami was not involved in Friday's bombing attack.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Israeli officials sharply criticized the Palestinian
self-rule government over a graduation ceremony held Tuesday for 60
recruits for the Palestinian security service in the autonomous
West Bank town of Jericho.
<p>
   Israeli media said 10 of the graduates were fugitives wanted by
Israel, most of them for killing suspected Palestinian
collaborators.
<p>
   During the ceremony, the commander of the recruits, Abu Fahed,
said that ``the struggle will continue until Jerusalem, Haifa and
Beisan (Beit Shean) are liberated.'' All three are towns in Israel.
<p>
   Other speakers called for ``armed struggle'' against Israel.
<p>
   Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of
the Sept. 13, 1994 Israel-PLO accord, said the remarks were grave
and could not be ignored.
<p>
   ``This is definitely not in keeping with our agreement and we
must warn about this and hold in-depth discussions with the
Palestinian authority,'' Beilin told Israel army radio.
<p>
   But Jibril Rajoub, the West Bank's Palestinian security chief,
said it was time to let go of the past.
<p>
   He said all graduates were members of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction. ``All Fatah people were fugitives (at one time) and now we
are starting a new page,'' he told Israel radio.

Yeltsin, Solzhenitsyn Meet
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  President Boris Yeltsin met Alexander Solzhenitsyn
on Wednesday for the first time since the former dissident writer
returned to Russia nearly six months ago.
<p>
   The meeting was at Yeltsin's home outside Moscow. The
president's office said the men first met alone for an informal,
``eye to eye'' talk, and then were joined by their wives.
<p>
   ``They talked tete-a-tete for more than two hours,''
Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, told the ITAR-Tass news agency about
her husband and Yeltsin. She said they had ``an intensive exchange
of opinions on a number of questions.''
<p>
   Solzhenitsyn, who was exiled by the Soviet Union 20 years ago
and returned to Russia in May, has been a frequent critic of the
government, blaming it for the hardships brought by market reforms.
But he has not criticized Yeltsin personally.
<p>
   The Nobel laureate is best known for such books as ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago.''

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Angolan army announcing fall of Uige before
truce deadline passed, President requesting Frontline summit,
cease-fire call broadcast hourly.
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing a military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement repeated
hourly on state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns
at 8 p.m. (1900GMT) and respect the truce ''scrupulously.''
<p>
   As the deadline passed, there were no immediate reports of
fighting. But just before 8 p.m., military officials claimed that
the northern city of Uige, the last provincial capital under UNITA
control, had fallen to government forces.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions at Tando-Zinze in
the northern enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled, the
officials told The Associated Press.
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka, was the
first for Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold, although all
previous efforts to stop the war that erupted on the eve of
independence from Portugal in 1975 have failed.
<p>
   UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
-- said the government's orders to hold fire were meaningless
unless the United Nations could guarantee the guns would remain
silent.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of the government claims
Uige had fallen. The city had been hotly contested since the
government last week seized UNITA headquarters at Huambo.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
Huambo.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ''to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   The United Nations has promised to start deploying monitors and
police shortly after the treaty is signed but will only dispatch a
peacekeeping contingent once a cease-fire is holding.
<p>
   Dos Santos' spokesman Ademiro Vaz de Conceicao said the
president had called for a summit of the Frontline states to be
held Saturday, the eve of the signing, in Lusaka.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is to take effect two days after the
signing.
<p>
   The truce was to be the first step in disengaging the warring
armies. Rebel and government delegations were meeting in Lusaka to
finalize last details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, faces possible assassination if he
returns to Luanda.
<p>
   The government wants to limit the size of Savimbi's personal
bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the capital with
a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed at
the start of the latest government offensive were dispelled last
month after U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with
the rebel leader in Huambo.
<p>
   But still he has not appeared in public.
<p>
   The UNITA delegation arrived in Lusaka from Zaire and there has
been widespread speculation that Savimbi had also fled Huambo for
refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen. Eugenio
Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, said: ``In
Angola.'' Responding to further questions whether Savimbi was in
Huambo or Jamba, he only smiled and repeated: ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically over the
past year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA
has lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

Fighting Surges in Bihac pocket, Rebel Muslims Join In
Eds: UPDATES with U.N. saying Velika Kladusa quiet.

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would draw harsh
international reaction, particularly after the United Nations eased
sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing in August to
stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other war material.
<p>
   Izetbegovic said rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter
attack on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, former stronghold of rebel
Muslim leader Fikret Abdic on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Yugoslav news media said Bosnian Serbs and Abdic troops had
entered Velika Kladusa. But a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Koos Sol, said
the town was quiet, although there was some shelling nearby.
<p>
   The United Nations expressed scepticism about assertions of
Yugoslav involvement and major helicopter and tank assaults. Sol, a
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said U.N. peacekeepers ``have nothing''
that would support massive intervention either by Croatian Serbs or
the Yugoslav army.
<p>
   Government statements of cross border involvement appeared
calculated to pressure the international community to act against
the Serb assaults.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after
toppling Abdic in August, sending his supporters fleeing into
Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Izetbegovic appealed to the Security Council on Wednesday to
take immediate action to halt a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb
forces on the Bihac area.
<p>
   He made the plea in a telephone call to the president of the
Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles).
<p>
   In Sarajevo, Izetbegovic criticized both the United Nations,
which has declared the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and
NATO, which has conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia
at U.N. behest, for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a
government-held northern city that is also a ``safe zone'' was
shelled for the third straight day Wednesday. One person died in
the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   Two missiles, apparently fired by Serbs, landed near Bangladeshi
peacekeepers in Cazin, within the pocket, and NATO warplanes flew
over the area but took no further action.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region nullified gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. But
gains remained elsewhere  &MD;  in a coordinated attack with Croat
allies two weeks ago, the government army took the Serb-held town
of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres, and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Yeltsin, Solzhenitsyn Meet
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  President Boris Yeltsin met Alexander Solzhenitsyn
on Wednesday for the first time since the former dissident writer
returned to Russia nearly six months ago.
<p>
   The meeting was at Yeltsin's home outside Moscow. The
president's office said the men first met alone for an informal,
``eye to eye'' talk, and then were joined by their wives.
<p>
   ``They talked tete-a-tete for more than two hours,''
Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, told the ITAR-Tass news agency about
her husband and Yeltsin. She said they had ``an intensive exchange
of opinions on a number of questions.''
<p>
   Solzhenitsyn, who was exiled by the Soviet Union 20 years ago
and returned to Russia in May, has been a frequent critic of the
government, blaming it for the hardships brought by market reforms.
But he has not criticized Yeltsin personally.
<p>
   The Nobel laureate is best known for such books as ``One Day in
the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago.''

Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent  &MD;  Best Inflation Report in Months
Eds: UPDATES to include Panetta comments on Fed rate hike and
further market reaction.
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
AP Economics Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  A day after the Federal Reserve raised
interest rates to cool off the economy, the government's most
closely watched inflation gauge showed a consumer-price rise of
only 0.1 percent for October.
<p>
   While Wednesday's Consumer Price Index report was certain to
provide ammunition to critics who are accusing the central bank of
monetary overkill, the Clinton administration continued to be
restrained in its comments.
<p>
   Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, told a gathering that
``we try not to presume or tell the Federal Reserve what they
should or should not do.''
<p>
   But Panetta indicated that the White House believed the economy
could withstand the rate hikes and continue to turn in a solid
performance.
<p>
   ``I think we can still have an economy that has strong growth,
low inflation and high investment,'' he said.
<p>
   The small 0.1 percent rise in the CPI, which matched a similar
rise last April, was better than expected. It followed a 0.2
percent September gain.
<p>
   In other economic news Wednesday, the government said that
Americans' weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation increased
1.5 percent in October, the biggest monthly gain in more than 12
years. The advance reflected increases in average hourly earnings
and the number of hours worked.
<p>
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said that business
inventories were up 0.5 percent in September, the sixth straight
advance, but business sales fell during the month, declining by 0.2
percent after a big surge in August.
<p>
   Financial markets rallied on the good inflation news. The Dow
Jones industrial average was up more than 5 points in early
afternoon trading while a rally in bond prices sent the yield on
the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond down below 8 percent for a
brief period of time.
<p>
   The latest Fed rate increase occurred Tuesday when the central
bank boosted two key rates by three-quarters of a point. It was the
biggest increase in the Fed's discount rate, the interest it
charges on bank loans, since May 1981.
<p>
   Major banks immediately followed suit by pushing their prime
rate up by a similar three-quarters of a point to 8.5 percent,
meaning that borrowing costs will be rising for millions of
Americans.
<p>
   So far this year, inflation at the consumer level is rising at
an annual rate of 2.6 percent, even better than last year's 2.7
percent increase. Critics contend that the central bank has no
business slowing the economy and running the risk of a recession in
the face of such an outstanding inflation performance.
<p>
   But the Fed and its supporters contend that the economy is
growing too rapidly at this stage of the economic expansion and
must be slowed or there is a great risk the economy will overheat
and force even sharper rate hikes next year.
<p>
   ``The Fed would say that the low inflation increases show that
its policy is working,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``This report shows that inflation
continues to be tomorrow's problem, not today's.''
<p>
   The government announced in Wednesday's report that it was
changing the way it calculated some key components of the inflation
report  &MD;  housing costs, food and drug prices.
<p>
   The changes, which will take effect at the start of next year,
are being made to meet complaints that the CPI was overstating
inflation. The government has estimated the impact of these changes
could shave about 0.1 percentage point off the annual inflation
rate.
<p>
   For October, energy prices fell by 0.7 percent, matching a
similar September decline as gasoline pump prices dropped 1.1
percent, home heating oil costs were down 2.3 percent and natural
gas prices dropped 1.2 percent.
<p>
   Food costs were unchanged in October, the best showing since a
0.3 percent decline last February.
<p>
   Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, inflation was
docile as well. The so-called core inflation rate rose just 0.2
percent in October, the same as September.
<p>
   The Fed's rate increase Tuesday was the sixth this year and came
despite the fact that critics staged a protest rally outside the
Fed as policy-makers were meeting. The increase was attacked by
Democratic members of Congress.
<p>
   But the Clinton administration refrained from criticizing the
Fed's actions, with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen saying that
the ``administration and the Federal Reserve share a common goal of
steady growth with low inflation.''

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with U.S. State Department ''encouraged'' by
truce.
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing a military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement repeated
hourly on state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns
at 8 p.m. (1900GMT) and respect the truce ''scrupulously.''
<p>
   As the deadline passed, there were no immediate reports of
fighting. But just before 8 p.m., military officials claimed that
the northern city of Uige, the last provincial capital under UNITA
control, had fallen to government forces.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions at Tando-Zinze in
the northern enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled, the
officials told The Associated Press.
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka, was the
first for Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold, although all
previous efforts to stop the war that erupted on the eve of
independence from Portugal in 1975 have failed.
<p>
   UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
-- said the government's orders to hold fire were meaningless
unless the United Nations could guarantee the guns would remain
silent.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of the government claims
Uige had fallen. The city had been hotly contested since the
government last week seized UNITA headquarters at Huambo.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
Huambo.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ''to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   But the U.S. State Department praised both sides.
<p>
   Deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States was
''encouraged'' by the truce and that Angolans and the world would
''accept no less'' than a lasting peace.

Wales Suffers Humiliating Blow to Euro Hopes
Eds: UPDATES with Bulgaria victory, France-Poland draw, other
results; will be UPDATED with late games

<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Wales suffered the most humiliating soccer defeat
in its history Wednesday, losing 5-0 to first-time entrant Georgia
in qualifying for the 1996 European Championship.
<p>
   The loss, coupled with a 3-2 defeat last month in another former
Soviet republic, Moldova, all but closed the door on Welsh hopes
for qualifying for the finals. Though it's still early in the
tournament, Wales must play four of its seven remaining games
against group favorites Germany and Bulgaria.
<p>
   ``The players and myself are ashamed,'' Wales manager Mike Smith
said. ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum
up a game like that? They were far better than us.''
<p>
   In numerical terms, it was Wales' biggest defeat since a 6-1
loss to France in 1953. Georgia, which is playing in the Europeans
for the first time since gaining independence, scored its first
goals and earned its first points in the competition. The team
previously lost to Moldova and Bulgaria.
<p>
   Although Smith could not call upon Manchester United winger Ryan
Giggs, who missed the game through injury, his strikeforce had
another United star, Mark Hughes, as well as Liverpool's Ian Rush
and Dean Saunders of Aston Villa, some of Europe's most feared
strikers.
<p>
   But it was the Welsh defense that was repeatedly torn apart by
Georgia's swift forwards. Temoliz Ketsbaia netted twice, and other
goals came from Georgi Kinkladze, Gocha Gogrichiani and Shota
Arveladze in front of the joyous 25,000 fans at Dynamo Stadium in
Tbilisi.
<p>
   Also in Group 7, Germany opened its qualifying campaign with a
2-1 victory over Albania in front of a sellout crowd of 23,000 in
Tirana. Strikers Juergen Klinsmann and Ulf Kirsten scored for
Germany, which has never lost to the Balkan country in nine
meetings.
<p>
   Hysen Zmijani netted for Albania, and Ledio Pano nearly tied it
in the dying seconds when his free kick hit the post. The Albanians
have lost both their qualifying matches.
<p>
   World Cup semifinalist Bulgaria moved into first place in the
group, beating Moldova 4-1 on two goals from Barcelona forward
Hristo Stoichkov.
<p>
   A total of 36 teams were in action Wednesday in the eight
qualifying groups. Defending champion Denmark visited Spain, while
World Cup finalist Italy hosted Croatia in later headline matches.
In an exhibition game, England hosted Nigeria at Wembley.
 &UR; Group 1 &QC; 
 &UR; Poland 0, France 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Zabrze, Poland, France played to a scoreless draw for the
third time in three qualifying matches.
<p>
   Poland remained third in the group with four points in three
matches. France moved up to fourth with three points in three
games.
 &UR; Azerbaijan 0, Israel 2 &QC; 
<p>
   In the rain at Trabzon, Turkey, Israel kept second place after
goals from Ronen Harazi, in the 30th minute, and Ronnie Rosenthal,
in the 51st. Israel has six points from three games, one point
behind idle Romania. Azerbaijan has lost its three matches and has
yet to score.
<p>
   European governing body UEFA ordered the match played at a
neutral site because of civil unrest in the former Soviet republic.
Some 5,000 Azeri fans made the trip.
 &UR; Group 7 &QC; 
 &UR; Georgia 5, Wales 0 &QC; 
<p>
   Ketsbaia scored in 30th and 49th minutes, Kinkladze in the 39th,
Gogrichiani in the 59th and Arveladze in the 66th.
 &UR; Albania 1, Germany 2 &QC; 
<p>
   Klinsmann struck in the 18th minute, Zmijani equalized for
Albania in the 33rd and Kirsten scored the winner in the 46th.
 &UR; Bulgaria 4, Moldova 1 &QC; 
<p>
   In a battle for first place before 40,000 at Sofia, Stoichkov
scored in the 45th and 85th minutes, Krasimir Balakov in the 64th,
and substitute Emil Kostadinov in the 87th for Bulgaria. Sergiu
Cleschenco scored for Moldova in the 59th.
<p>
   Bulgaria moved into the group lead with a perfect tally of six
points from two games. Moldova, with two victories and a loss, fell
to second place on goal differential.
 &UR; Group 8 &QC; 
 &UR; Finland 5, Faeroe Islands 0 &QC; 
<p>
   Before 2,420 at Helsinki, Finland won its first game and scored
its first goals in the tournament against the perennial strugglers
from the North Atlantic. Ajax Amsterdam striker Jari Litmanen and
Mika-Matti Paatelainen of English club Bolton scored two goals each
after Antti Sumiala's opening score.
<p>
   Finland has three points in three games, while the Faeroes have
lost all three matches, allowing 15 goals and scoring just two.

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful

   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing a military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the

without a cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka, was the

<p>
   Optimism was guarded that the truce would hold, although all
previous efforts to stop the war that erupted on the eve of
independence from Portugal in 1975 have failed.
<p>
   UNITA  &MD;  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
 &MD;  said the government's orders to hold fire were meaningless unless
the United Nations could guarantee the guns would remain silent.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of the government claims
Uige had fallen. The city had been hotly contested since the
government last week seized UNITA headquarters at Huambo.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
Huambo.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ``to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   The United Nations has promised to start deploying monitors and
police shortly after the treaty is signed, but will only dispatch a
peacekeeping contingent once a cease-fire is holding.
<p>
   Dos Santos' spokesman, Ademiro Vaz de Conceicao, said the
president had called for a summit of the Frontline states to be
held Saturday, the eve of the signing, in Lusaka.
<p>
   A permanent cease-fire is to take effect two days after the
signing.
<p>
   The truce was to be the first step in disengaging the warring
armies. Rebel and government delegations were meeting in Lusaka to
finalize last details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, faces possible assassination if he
returns to Luanda.
<p>
   The government wants to limit the size of Savimbi's personal
bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the capital with
a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed at
the start of the latest government offensive were dispelled last
month after U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with
the rebel leader in Huambo.
<p>
   But still he has not appeared in public.
<p>
   The UNITA delegation arrived in Lusaka from Zaire and there has
been widespread speculation that Savimbi had also fled Huambo for
refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen. Eugenio
Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, said: ``In
Angola.'' Responding to further questions whether Savimbi was in
Huambo or Jamba, he only smiled and repeated: ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically over the
past year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA
has lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

Spot Shortages of Cleaner Gasoline Seen
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  There could be gasoline shortages and
temporary price spikes next January when motorists have to begin
using a new blend in cities with serious air pollution, the Energy
Department said Wednesday.
<p>
   But the department's Energy Information Administration said that
in general, there is expected to be enough of the new gasoline to
meet the estimated demand of 105 million gallons a day.
<p>
   ``Very localized shortages and temporary price run-ups are
possibilities,'' the agency cautioned, however, in its energy
forecast for early next year. It said that on average nationwide,
the new gasoline will cost four to six cents more than conventional
fuel because of increased production and distribution costs.
<p>
   The ``reformulated'' gasoline, which must contain a certain
amount of oxygen additive to allow it to burn more cleanly, is
being required by the Environmental Protection Agency in nine
cities with the worst smog problems as well as in parts of 14
states, mostly in the Northeast.
<p>
   The cities are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego,
Baltimore, Milwaukee, Houston, Philadelphia and Hartford, Conn.
<p>
   Meanwhile the EIA, which is the Energy Department's
statistic-gathering arm, predicted crude-oil prices likely will
rise slowly next year, perhaps reaching dlrs 18 a 42-gallon barrel
by the end of 1995. Crude prices recently have averaged dlrs 13 to
dlrs 16 a barrel.
<p>
   World oil demand, meanwhile, is expected to continue to increase
next year by about 900,000 barrels a day, or about 1.3 percent,
according to the agency. It said growth in demand will be
particularly strong in Asia and strong in Europe, while easing off
in the United States.
<p>
   This year, U.S. petroleum demand was expected to increase 2.5
percent over 1993 because of robust economic growth, lower oil
prices and the extreme winter weather during the first two months
of the year, said the agency.
<p>
   Slower economic growth, firm prices and an expectation of more
normal winter weather patterns are likely to keep oil demand down
in 1995 with expected growth likely to be only about 60,000 barrels
a day. Demand grew by 430,000 barrels a day in 1994.
<p>
   Heating-oil prices are expected to increase because of higher
crude prices, although demand is likely to be down compared to last
winter when much of the nation had particularly harsh weather.
<p>
   Electricity demand was expected to continue to rise steadily
this year and next. Demand during the first six months of 1994
exceeded expectations, said the agency.
<p>
   The increased demand for electricity caused greater use of coal
and natural gas during 1994, and coal consumption is expected to
increase by 2.2 percent this year and natural gas consumption by 8
percent.

   ZABRZE, Poland (AP)  &MD;  France and Poland played to a scoreless
draw in a European Championship qualifier on Wednesday, a pouring
rain preventing the French from capitalizing on superior speed and
technical skills.
<p>
   It was the third goalless tie for France after draws with
Slovakia and Romania in Group One matches.
<p>
   The Poles offered tough resistance on the muddy field near
Katowice, prompting plenty of foul play by frustrated Frenchmen.
<p>
   The referee sent Christian Karembeu off the field with a red
card in the 49th minute after he brought down Poland's charging
striker Roman Kosecki.
<p>
   A colorless first half saw few shots on goal, although French
striker Nicolas Ouedec made several skilled charges, one ending in
a narrow miss from the right-hand side of the penalty box.
<p>
   Poland's best opportunity came in the 13th minute, when Kosecki
took a pass 15 meters (45 feet) away only to sail a powerful shot
over the bar.
<p>
   Marek Kozminski also made several dangerous charges on the
French goal from the left wing, but had to be carried off the field
in the 29th minute after a foul by Karembeu.
<p>
   The French had more chances in the second half, but goalie Jozef
Wandzik equaled the challenge, showing off his best on a 16-meter
(48 feet) shot from midfielder Youri Djorkaeff.
<p>
   Poland gained steam in the waning minutes, with Krzysztof
Warzycha narrowly missing a header at 72 minutes. Striker Andrzej
Juskowiak dribbled past two French defenders in the final minute
and passed to Warzycha, who failed under pressure to find a way to
the net.

With BC-Yugoslavia
Croats, Serbs Reach Tentative Economic Agreement
By BRANKA KOSTOVSKA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)  &MD;  International efforts bringing the
Croatian government and rebel Serbs closer together showed signs of
progress early Wednesday when the two sides reached tentative
agreement on economic cooperation.
<p>
   ``This is a significant step forward in the peace process,''
U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith said after more than 11 hours of
negotiations.
<p>
   The agreement, which would effectively rebuild war-shattered
economic ties, still has to be signed following its review by
leaders of the respective sides.
<p>
   An economic agreement could anchor international efforts to
reach a political settlement in Croatia, where rebel Serbs hold
one-third of Croatian territory which they captured in a six-month
war in 1991.
<p>
   But previous efforts have repeatedly broken down over seemingly
irreconcileable differences. The Serbs, who have proclaimed their
own state on the territory they control, refuse to submit to
Croatian government authority. The Croatian government has
threatened to retake the Serb-held territories by force if
necessary.
<p>
   U.N. resolutions and the United States insist on the territorial
integrity of Croatia and the eventual reintegration of Serb-held
territories.
<p>
   The agreement, to be implemented one month after it is signed by
both parties, would restore water and electricity to a dozen
communities, and reopen oil pipelines. It would also reopen the
highway linking the Croatian capital Zagreb with Belgrade, capital
of Serbia and what remains of Yugoslavia.
<p>
   Diplomats maintain that reestablishing economic links could
facilitate future negotiations on an overall political settlement.
<p>
   ``The agreement requires good will on both sides,'' Galbraith
said. ``But we have to expect that each side sees it as earnest...
in order to escape hostilities in which both sides would be
losers.''
<p>
   Galbraith is a member of an international mediating team that
also includes Russian Ambassador Leonid Kerestedijanc and European
Union negotiators Kai Eide and Geert Ahrens.
<p>
   The head of the Serb delegation, Borislav Mikelic, insisted that
there be no political references whatsoever in the economic
agreement. That he said, was the condition for Serbs to sign. The
agreement is to be reviewed by the Serbs' self-style parliament.
<p>
   Hrvoje Sarinic, Croatia's head negotiator, said Croatia would
probably sign the agreement next week, but emphasized it must be
understood in the context of U.N. resolutions on Croatian
sovereignty.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources indicated, however, that the Croatian
government may be willing to drop its previous insistence that
reference to such U.N. resolutions be made in any accord signed.
That would open the door to Serb agreement.

Ukraine Reactor Closed After Cooling Flaws Found
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Flaws in the cooling system forced the
shutdown of a reactor at a nuclear power plant in central Ukraine
on Wednesday, a news report said.
<p>
   No radiation was released and repairs were under way, according
to the report by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
<p>
   It said the malfunction was discovered shortly after 11 a.m. at
the Khmelnitsky nuclear plant, 250 kilometers (150 miles) west of
Kiev. The reactor was shut down a few minutes later.
<p>
   Ukraine, site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, remains heavily
dependent on nuclear power. Its five plants have had frequent
troubles in recent years.
<p>
   In 1991, the Khmelnitsky plant closed for two weeks because of
technical malfunctions, and in March of this year, fire shut the
reactor. In August, officials said they had shut down the reactor
for routine maintenance, but news reports at the time cited
problems with the safety system.

   TRABZON, Turkey (AP)  &MD;  Ronen Harazi and Ronnie Rosenthal scored
a goal each to lead Israel to a 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan in a
European Championship qualifying game Wednesday.
<p>
   Harazi netted a header in the 30th minute, and Rosenthal scored
the clincher in the 51st after a superb individual effort to evade
the Azeri defense.
<p>
   The victory kept Israel in second place in Group 1 in the
qualifying tournament. The Israelis, with six points from three
games, trail idle Romania by one point. Azerbaijan has lost all
three of its qualifying games and has yet to score a goal.
<p>
   The game was played in Trabzon after European governing body
UEFA ordered that Azerbaijan play its home qualifying matches at a
neutral site because of civil unrest in the former Soviet republic.
Virtually the entire crowd of 5,000 was made up of Azeris who made
the trip to the Black Sea fishing village.

New Tajik President Inaugurated As Border Clashes Continue
Eds: UPDATES with new quotes, upgraded attribution
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP)  &MD;  Tajikistan's new president pledged
on Wednesday to crush the armed opposition to his authority and
improve living conditions in the impoverished, war-torn nation of 5
million.
<p>
   ``It is necessary to stop the cult of brutal armed force and
take the strictest measures to disarm underground military units of
any orientation,'' Emomali Rakhmonov told the Tajik parliament in
his inaugural address.
<p>
   Fighting between government troops and opposition fighters has
continued despite the latest cease-fire signed at U.N.-backed
negotiations in Pakistan two weeks ago.
<p>
   On Tuesday night, two groups of Tajik opposition fighters
crossed the Tajik-Afghan border and opened fire on Russian guards.
<p>
   No casualties were reported in the clash, the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The rebels are backed by Islamic mujahedeen in Afghanistan,
while government troops have been supported by Russian forces.
<p>
   Rakhmonov, 42, came to power in 1992 at the height of the civil
war which claimed 20,000 lives and turned at least 500,000 people
into refugees.
<p>
   On Nov. 6, he was elected president with 60 percent of the vote.
<p>
   His only challenger, Tajik ambassador to Moscow Abdumalik
Abdulladjanov, got 35 percent. Abdulladjanov accused the
presidential team of obstructing his election campaign and rigging
the final poll results.
<p>
   ``I appeal to all Tajik people to forget previous offenses and
pool efforts to unite our motherland and build a bright future for
our country and bring happiness to our children,'' Rakhmonov said.
<p>
   ``As the president I swear to defend the constitution and ...
protect the territorial integrity of Tajikistan,'' Rakhmonov said,
his hand on a copy of Tajikistan's new constitution.
<p>
   In the elections, voters also endorsed Tajikistan's first
post-Soviet constitution, which declares the president as head of
parliament.

Ghanian Students Protest Lecturers' Strike
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) - Hundreds of students from Ghana's three main
universities marched through the streets of the capital Wednesday
to demand the government and professors resolve a pay dispute that
has delayed the start of classes.
<p>
   Students from the University of Ghana, the University of Science
and Technology, and the University of Cape Coast presented a letter
to the education minister and Parliament speaker.
<p>
   University professors and lecturers went on strike Oct. 1, just
before the start of the academic year, to demand higher salaries.
The government says their union's demand for an annual salary of
6.4 million cedis (dlrs 6,400) is too high. They currently earn
about dlrs 3,160 per year.
<p>
   Students say they'll have to repeat the year if universities
don't reopen by the end of the month.
<p>
   The government has been strict on wage increases, saying they
will lead to disparities in the salary structures of civil
servants. The Parliament speaker earns about dlrs 5,400 per year.

Someone Ran Up Tab On Top Prosecutor's `Secret' Number
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MILAN, Italy (AP)  &MD;  Dial ``m'' for mystery -- or is it
magistrate?
<p>
   Police are trying to learn who got hold of the secret telephone
number of one of Italy's most heavily guarded men, anti-corruption
prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro.
<p>
   Magistrate Di Pietro, whose probes over the last two years
convulsed the nation's political and business world, thought his
cellular phone was having problems and had it checked by the state
phone company, Italian news reports said Wednesday.
<p>
   The check found that despite having a ``supersecret'' number, as
the Italian news agency AGI put it, someone had apparently rigged
another phone to make calls as if they were being dialed from Di
Pietro's portable. The calls were being charged to the secret
number.
<p>
   Police are trying to discover if someone was also tapping into
and monitoring the calls Di Pietro made.
<p>
   News of the telephone mystery came the same day as word that one
of Di Pietro's fellow prosecutors, Gerardo D'Ambrosio, was visited
by burglars over the weekend.
<p>
   RAI state TV said that D'Ambrosio and his family were sleeping
in the house when thieves entered through a window, made off with
the stereo, silverware and diplomas of D'Ambrosio and his wire and
left through the front door. It said the thieves later sent back
the diplomas.
<p>
   RAI said the occupants might have been drugged by the burglars
so they wouldn't wake up and hear the intruders. Spraying a
sleep-inducing substance is a common trick of thieves in Italy,
especially on overnight train runs.
<p>
   The report said it was unclear how, in a country where escorts
and guards are routine for many officials, there was no guard
posted at the house of one of the investigators behind the
sensitive Clean Hands probes.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would draw harsh
international reaction, particularly after the United Nations eased
sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing in August to
stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other war material.
<p>
   Izetbegovic said rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter
attack on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, former stronghold of rebel
Muslim leader Fikret Abdic on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Yugoslav news media said Bosnian Serbs and Abdic troops had
entered Velika Kladusa. But a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Koos Sol, said
the town was quiet, although there was some shelling nearby.
<p>
   The United Nations expressed skepticism about assertions of
Yugoslav involvement and major helicopter and tank assaults. Sol, a
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said U.N. peacekeepers ``have nothing''
that would support massive intervention either by Croatian Serbs or
the Yugoslav army.
<p>
   Government statements of cross-border involvement appeared
calculated to pressure the international community to act against
the Serb assaults.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after
toppling Abdic in August, sending his supporters fleeing into
Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Izetbegovic appealed to the Security Council on Wednesday to
take immediate action to halt a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb
forces on the Bihac area.
<p>
   He made the plea in a telephone call to the president of the
Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles).
<p>
   In Sarajevo, Izetbegovic criticized both the United Nations,
which has declared the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and
NATO, which has conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia
at U.N. behest, for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a
government-held northern city that is also a ``safe zone'' was
shelled for the third straight day Wednesday. One person died in
the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   Two missiles, apparently fired by Serbs, landed near Bangladeshi
peacekeepers in Cazin, within the pocket, and NATO warplanes flew
over the area but took no further action.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region nullified gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. But
gains remained elsewhere  &MD;  in a coordinated attack with Croat
allies two weeks ago, the government army took the Serb-held town
of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

How Much Alcohol Is Too Much? More than a Drink a Day
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
AP Science Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS (AP)  &MD;  Doctors have some sobering news for those who
think a little alcohol is good for their health: Anything more than
a drink a day may be too much of a good thing.
<p>
   Men who had two to four drinks a week had the lowest rate of
death from all causes during an 11-year study, the researchers said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Many studies over the past 20 years have shown that people who
drink moderately reduce their risk of dying from heart disease by
about 40 percent. The evidence has become so convincing that some
heart specialists have cautiously recommended moderate drinking for
good health.
<p>
   But some fear that alcohol's benefits for the heart could be
offset by its other hazards, such as cancer and accidents.
<p>
   To sort this out, researchers from Harvard Medical School
examined the effects of drinking on all causes of death, not just
heart disease, in 22,071 male doctors. Over an 11-year period, they
compared the risk of death in the drinkers with that of people who
seldom or never drank.
<p>
   They found that men who had two to four drinks a week had the
lowest death rate  &MD;  about 22 percent lower than those who shunned
alcohol. Men who had up to six drinks a week also ran a lower risk
than the nondrinkers.
<p>
   But by the time the men averaged one drink a day, the benefits
of alcohol were wiped out. Their risk of dying was identical to
that of those who did not drink at all.
<p>
   Beyond a drink a day, the risk went up sharply. Those who
averaged two or more drinks a day had a death rate that was 63
percent higher than that of the nondrinkers.
<p>
   The researchers found that the lower risk of dying from heart
disease was offset by an increase in cancer in those who had more
than a drink a day. Most of the increase was in throat, gastric,
urinary tract and brain cancer.
<p>
   Moderate drinking is often defined as one to three drinks a day.
But the new study suggests that healthy moderation is probably
considerably lower.
<p>
   ``Alcohol has complex health effects, with health benefits and
hazards even for moderate drinkers,'' said Harvard's Dr. Carlos A.
Camargo Jr., who directed the analysis. ``Clearly people should
drink less than two drinks a day and probably less than one a
day.''
<p>
   Camargo described the results Wednesday at a meeting of the
American Heart Association.
<p>
   The study was conducted only on men, so the researchers cannot
say for sure how much drinking is safe for women.
<p>
   But Camargo said other studies suggest that women can safely
drink only about half as much as men. So if two to six drinks a
week is the ideal amount for men, one to three drinks may be a safe
limit for women.
<p>
   One surprise was the relationship between drinking and traumatic
deaths. While heavy drinking clearly raises the risk of dying in
car accidents and other violent events, the study found that
moderate drinking actually seemed to reduce the chances of dying
this way.
<p>
   Those who took less than one drink a day had a 31 percent lower
risk of dying from violence or suicide, compared with the
nondrinkers.
<p>
   One criticism of the study is that it was conducted on an
especially healthy, clean-living group of men. Dr. Gary Fraser of
Loma Linda University cautioned that light drinking might not be so
benign for more ordinary people.

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would draw harsh
international reaction, particularly after the United Nations eased
sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing in August to
stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other war material.
<p>
   Izetbegovic said rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter
attack on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, former stronghold of rebel
Muslim leader Fikret Abdic on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Yugoslav news media said Bosnian Serbs and Abdic troops had
entered Velika Kladusa. But a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Koos Sol, said
the town was quiet, although there was some shelling nearby.
<p>
   The United Nations expressed skepticism about assertions of
Yugoslav involvement and major helicopter and tank assaults. Sol, a
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said U.N. peacekeepers ``have nothing''
that would support massive intervention either by Croatian Serbs or
the Yugoslav army.
<p>
   Government statements of cross-border involvement appeared
calculated to pressure the international community to act against
the Serb assaults.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after
toppling Abdic in August, sending his supporters fleeing into
Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Izetbegovic appealed to the Security Council on Wednesday to
take immediate action to halt a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb
forces on the Bihac area.
<p>
   He made the plea in a telephone call to the president of the
Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles).
<p>
   In Sarajevo, Izetbegovic criticized both the United Nations,
which has declared the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and
NATO, which has conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia
at U.N. behest, for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a
government-held northern city that is also a ``safe zone'' was
shelled for the third straight day Wednesday. One person died in
the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   Two missiles, apparently fired by Serbs, landed near Bangladeshi
peacekeepers in Cazin, within the pocket, and NATO warplanes flew
over the area but took no further action.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region nullified gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. But
gains remained elsewhere  &MD;  in a coordinated attack with Croat
allies two weeks ago, the government army took the Serb-held town
of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres and in northeast Bosnia
where a platoon of 30-40 Bosnian Serbs apparently have been trapped
by government troops. Battles also were reported around an
important road to the heart of government-held territory in
north-central Bosnia.
<p>
   Heavy fighting continued around Mount Majevica in the northeast,
and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in north-central Bosnia.
There, the government is hoping to gain control of a good road that
would allow better access to government territory farther north.
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with gov't commander saying observing truce.
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing a military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement repeated
hourly on state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns
at 8 p.m. (1900GMT) and respect the truce ''scrupulously.''
<p>
   As the deadline passed, the government commander of the main,
southern front, said his men were holding fire as ordered.
<p>
   ``We are maintaining our positions and not advancing,'' said
Brig. Macedo Amarel. He said there was no sign of rebel troop
movements but warned ''we are on our guard.''
<p>
   Just before 8 p.m., military officials claimed that the northern
city of Uige, the last provincial capital under UNITA control, had
fallen to government forces. There was no independent confirmation.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions at Tando-Zinze in
the northern enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled, the
officials told The Associated Press.
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka, was the
first for Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded. All previous efforts to stop the war that
erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 have
failed.
<p>
   UNITA -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
-- said the truce was meaningless unless the United Nations could
guarantee the guns would remain silent.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
Huambo, rebel headquarters taken by the government last week.
<p>
   UNITA charged the government was trying ''to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   U.N monitors and police are to fan out shortly after the signing
but a peacekeeping contingent will come only once a permanent
cease-fire, to take effect two days after the signing, is in place.
<p>
   The U.S. State Department praised both sides.
<p>
   Deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States was
''encouraged'' by the truce and that Angolans and the world would
''accept no less'' than a lasting peace.
<p>
   Dos Santos' spokesman Ademiro Vaz de Conceicao said the
president had called for a summit of the Frontline states to be
held Saturday, the eve of the signing, in Lusaka.
<p>
   Rebel and government delegations met in Lusaka to finalize
details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, faces possible assassination if he
returns to Luanda.
<p>
   The government wants to limit the size of Savimbi's personal
bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the capital with
a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed at
the start of the latest government offensive were dispelled last
month after U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with
the rebel leader in Huambo.
<p>
   But still he has not appeared in public.
<p>
   The UNITA delegation arrived in Lusaka from Zaire and there has
been widespread speculation that Savimbi had also fled Huambo for
refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked repeatedly by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen.
Eugenio Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, would
only say : ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically over the
past year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA
has lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

   MINSK, Belarus (AP)  &MD;  Norway overpowered Belarus 4-0 Wednesday
night in a Group 5 qualifier for the 1996 European Championship.
<p>
   The Norwegians, who won 1-0 when the two teams played in Oslo on
Sept. 7, scored two goals in each half, all from different players.
<p>
   Henning Berg opened the scoring in the 35th minute with a
beautiful header. The Blackburn Rovers defender intercepted a
header by Belarussian defender Andrei Zygmantovich off a corner
kick by Lars Bohinen, and drove it into the net.
<p>
   Onvald Leonhardsen scored the second goal in the 39th minute.
<p>
   The pace got quicker in the second half despite the slippery
pitch, soaked by two days of rain and sleet. Belarus launched
several attacks but failed to finish them off.
<p>
   Norway got goals from Bohinen in the 52nd minute and Chechiel
Rakdal in the 83rd.
<p>
   Norway, with two wins and one loss, has seven points in Group 5.
Belarus, with a win and two defeats, has three points.

Roman Catholic Churches to Shelter Men Avoiding Draft
By FREDDY CUEVAS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP)  &MD;  Roman Catholic churches in this
Central American nation's capital will provide refuge to young men
who want to avoid the military draft, the archbishop of Tegucigalpa
said Wednesday.
<p>
   ``This is nothing extraordinary,'' Msgr. Oscar Andres Rodriguez
told journalists. ``Catholic churches traditionally have been
places of respect and refuge for the persecuted.
<p>
   ``Young men who do not want to take part in military service
will be safe there ... and we will gladly shelter them,'' Rodriguez
said.
<p>
   Leaders of popular organizations on Tuesday called on Catholic
churches to provide asylum to young men seeking to avoid the draft.
<p>
   The call by the Christian Civic Movement, a coalition of some 50
popular groups, is part of a campaign to force President Roberto
Reina to abolish conscription and head off a huge military draft
planned for next week.
<p>
   There was no immediate response from military leaders.
<p>
   Every year, the army recruits  &MD;  often by force  &MD;  more than 7,000
men between the ages of 18 and 30 to serve two years' military
service.
<p>
   The legislature in May modified the law to allow young men to
opt to provide social work rather than military service. But that
law doesn't go into effect until next year.
<p>
   In anticipation of the change, the armed forces has planned a
huge public lottery for Saturday to draft some 9,000 young men into
military service from a list of 174,000.
<p>
   In the past, the military also has used press gangs to forcibly
detain young men at bus stations and even pull them from taxis or
their own homes.
<p>
   At least 150 conscripts have died under cloudy circumstances
during military training.
<p>
   Even the chief of the armed forces, Gen. Luis Alonso Discua, has
publicly admitted that ``the obligatory military service in
Honduras is inhumane and violates all human rights.''
<p>
   The military ruled Honduras from 1963 to 1981. The draft has
been in effect since 1980.

Brolin Stars In Swedish 2-0 Win; Leaves Game With Injury
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)  &MD;  Tomas Brolin scored one goal and set up
Martin Dahlin for another as World Cup bronze medalists Sweden beat
Hungary 2-0 in a Group 3 European soccer qualifier Wednesday.
<p>
   Brolin, the only Swede named to the World Cup All Star team last
summer, left the game in the 70th minute after sustaining a
left-ankle injury. He was replaced by Stefan Rehgn in midfield.
<p>
   Brolin, 24, was brought to hospital for X-rays after he was
examined by team doctor Jan Ekstrand in the lockerroom.
<p>
   ``It appears to be a fracture,'' Ekstrand said. ``Tomas told me
it was very painful. After X-rays we'll decide if surgery is
needed.''
<p>
   Brolin, who also plays for Parma in the Italian league, was
injured when he set up Dahlin for the go ahead goal with a cross
from the left 20 minutes from time.
<p>
   ``Tomas' injury was a sad end to a great game,'' Swedish coach
Tommy Svensson said. ``I'm very sorry for him. I hope he gets well
soon.''
<p>
   Sweden, playing its first European qualifier at home after the
successful World Cup campaign, dominated heavily throughout the
first half and Hungarian defenders twice cleared the ball on the
goalline before Brolin connected in the 44th minute.
<p>
   Brolin, who beat goalkeeper Szolt Petry with a right-foot drive
from 15 meters, now has scored 24 goals in 41 national team
appearances.
<p>
   The victory before a near-sellout crowd of 27,571 at Rasunda
Stadium moved the Swedes to six points in the standings. The Swedes
beat Iceland 1-0 and lost to Switzerland 4-2 in the first two
games.
<p>
   Thomas Ravelli, perhaps Sweden's biggest hero in the World Cup
finals, made two sparkling saves off free kicks from Lajos Detari
in the second half to earn the shutout. Ravelli played his 121st
game for Sweden and is now only four games short of the world
record held by England's retired keeper Peter Shilton.
<p>
   Referee Mario van der Ende of the Netherlands booked three
Hungarians, Geza Meszloy (39th minute), Florian Urban, (50th) and
Peter Lipcsei (52nd).
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Sweden: Thomas Ravelli - Roland Nilsson, Patrik Andersson,
Joachim Bjorklund, Pontus Kamark  &MD;  Tomas Brolin (Stefan Rehn, 70th
minute), Jonas Thern, Stefan Schwarz  &MD;  Martin Dahlin, Kennet
Andersson, Henrik Larsson.

Wheat Falls To 11-Week Lows; Corn, Soybeans Also Dip
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHICAGO (AP) - Wheat futures prices tumbled to 11-week lows
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a murky export
picture. Corn and soybeans futures prices also sank.
<p>
   Wheat futures prices have been steadily losing ground in recent
days as the Agriculture Department remains silent about new tenders
for the crop. A widely anticipated announcement of new subsidies
for Egypt has not materialized, making some traders believe Egypt
may look elsewhere.
<p>
   China also is said to be seeking wheat, and an announcement to
that effect could help maintain wheat through a key psychological
support level Thursday, said Steve Freed, director of research for
ADM Investor Services Inc.
<p>
   Corn futures closed mostly lower, with the nearby contract
ending unchanged on South Korean buying and news that Spain also is
on the market for the crop.
<p>
   Soybeans futures closed moderately lower amid some profit-taking
from recent strong gains. Strong overseas demand for vegetable oils
has pushed soybean oil futures prices higher and taken soybeans
futures with them. Traders became nervous Wednesday that the gains
were excessive.
<p>
   Prices also were pressured by rain in northern Brazil, which is
relieving water-starved crops there.
<p>
   Wheat for December delivery fell 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.73 3-4 a
bushel; December corn was unchanged at dlrs 2.16 3-4 a bushel;
December oats were 1 3-4 cents lower at dlrs 1.23 1-2 a bushel;
November soybeans fell 1 1-2 cents to dlrs 5.58 3-4 a bushel.

Church, Government Sources: Aristide To Resign His Priesthood

<TEXT>
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the slum priest whose championship of the poor pitted him against
dictators and his Roman Catholic superiors, is leaving the
priesthood, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vatican, which has long been at odds with the populist
preacher, pressured Aristide to resign, a church source said. Two
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed
Aristide's departure.
<p>
   There was no immediate word from Aristide or reason given for
giving up the priesthood. He spent the day with Haitian business
leaders and Oscar Arias Sanchez, the former president of Costa
Rica.
<p>
   The Vatican had no immediate comment, but some church sources
said it would be unusual for the Vatican to force a priest to quit.
A senior Vatican official said it was unlikely the Vatican would
demand Aristide leave the church at such a sensitive time in Haiti.
<p>
   Aristide's withdrawal from the priesthood, however, is not
likely to hurt his support among Haiti's poor, many of whom
associated the church with the old military regime.
<p>
   Aristide spokesman Yvon Neptune acknowledged there had recently
been friction with the church.
<p>
   ``The Catholic hierarchy ... was uncomfortable with the
president being a lay authority and at the same time a priest who
should be working for the Holy See,'' Neptune said.
<p>
   The Salesian order expelled Aristide in 1988, saying his
liberation theology teachings were inciting class war. The Vatican
never formally defrocked him, but sources say Aristide is now being
pressured by Rome to relinquish his collar.
<p>
   Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after being overthrown in September
1991 and spending three years in exile. Thousands of U.S. soldiers
helped restore his government.
<p>
   The church official who requested anonymity said Aristide will
send a letter of resignation to the Vatican, but he did not say
when. Aristide decided it would be better for Haiti if he resigned
because the Vatican is so influential, the official said.
<p>
   Years ago, Aristide attacked the Catholic hierarchy as part of
the privileged class that had misruled Haiti, calling most of the
bishops ``Macoutes'' in a reference to the Duvalier dynasty's
deadly militia.
<p>
   In a radio talk in November 1988, he showed his contempt for the
church hierarchy by saying bitterly:
<p>
   ``What luck for the Haitian church,
<p>
   ``Rich, thanks to the poor,
<p>
   ``In a country that is poor because of the rich.''
<p>
   Aristide has appeared more moderate since returning to Haiti,
repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   At a public appearance last week to Cap Haitien, the country's
second-largest city, Aristide embraced and shook hands with Bishop
Francois Gayot, a prominent clergyman who was hostile to his
return. Some in the crowd booed, unhappy with the idea of
reconciliation.
<p>
   Although Aristide's priestly mystique has gained him support,
some of his backers said they would not be troubled by his
resignation from the priesthood.
<p>
   ``Aristide is a statesman. The most important dimension of the
man today is not the religious, it is the political,'' said Gerard
Pierre-Charles, a leader of the grass-roots Lavalas political
organization, which is loyal to Aristide.
<p>
   ``One less role to play,'' said Jean Frederick, 41, an
unemployed resident of the capital. ``In any case, the people will
always call him `Father Aristide.'''
<p>
   Aristide, whose relations with the business community were once
strained by his populist approach, got a warm reception Wednesday
from hundreds of business executives.
<p>
   ``Without you, it means failure. With you, success,'' Aristide
told the gathering of well-dressed men and women in the pillared
main hall of the national palace.
<p>
   Jacques Deschamps, head of the chamber of commerce, promised to
cooperate in the economic reconstruction of impoverished Haiti.
Aristide embraced Deschamps to loud applause.
<p>
   At a news conference, Arias urged Haitians to follow his
country's example and abolish the army. Haitian soldiers have been
blamed for condoning thousands of political killings in the last
three years.
<p>
   ``I believe that the abolition of the Haitian army is an idea
whose time has come,'' said Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize. Costa Rica, the most stable country in Central America,
disbanded its armed forces in 1948.

Croats, Serbs Reach Tentative Economic Agreement
Eds: UPDATES with comments by U.N. negotiator.
By BRANKA KOSTOVSKA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)  &MD;  International efforts bringing the
Croatian government and rebel Serbs closer together showed signs of
progress early Wednesday when the two sides reached tentative
agreement on economic cooperation.
<p>
   ``This is a significant step forward in the peace process,''
U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith said after more than 11 hours of
negotiations.
<p>
   The agreement, which would effectively rebuild war-shattered
economic ties, still has to be signed following its review by
leaders of the respective sides.
<p>
   An economic agreement could anchor international efforts to
reach a political settlement in Croatia, where rebel Serbs hold
one-third of Croatian territory which they captured in a six-month
war in 1991.
<p>
   But previous efforts have repeatedly broken down over seemingly
irreconcileable differences. The Serbs, who have proclaimed their
own state on the territory they control, refuse to submit to
Croatian government authority. The Croatian government has
threatened to retake the Serb-held territories by force if
necessary.
<p>
   U.N. resolutions and the United States insist on the territorial
integrity of Croatia and the eventual reintegration of Serb-held
territories.
<p>
   The agreement, to be implemented one month after it is signed by
both parties, would restore water and electricity to a dozen
communities, and reopen oil pipelines. It would also reopen the
highway linking the Croatian capital Zagreb with Belgrade, capital
of Serbia and what remains of Yugoslavia.
<p>
   Diplomats maintain that reestablishing economic links could
facilitate future negotiations on an overall political settlement.
<p>
   ``The agreement requires good will on both sides,'' Galbraith
said. ``But we have to expect that each side sees it as earnest...
in order to escape hostilities in which both sides would be
losers.''
<p>
   Galbraith is a member of an international mediating team that
also includes Russian Ambassador Leonid Kerestediants and European
Union negotiators Kai Eide and Geert Ahrens.
<p>
   The head of the Serb delegation, Borislav Mikelic, insisted that
there be no political references whatsoever in the economic
agreement. That he said, was the condition for Serbs to sign. The
agreement is to be reviewed by the Serbs' self-style parliament.
<p>
   Hrvoje Sarinic, Croatia's head negotiator, said Croatia would
probably sign the agreement next week, but emphasized it must be
understood in the context of U.N. resolutions on Croatian
sovereignty.
<p>
   ``These are declarations the parties are making based on their
need to make a political statement,'' the U.N. negotiator for
former Yugoslavia, Thorvald Stoltenberg, said on returning to Oslo,
Norway from Zagreb. But the economic agreement does not refer to
them, he said.

U.N. Responds to Iraq's ``Significant'' Recognition of Kuwait
Eds: UPDATES with French comment, background.
By DONALD W. SWINTON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  &MD;  The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday
said Iraq had taken ``a significant step'' by recognizing Kuwait.
<p>
   Last week, Iraq recognized Kuwait's sovereignty and its borders,
meeting a key condition set by the United Nations for lifting the
crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi troops invaded the
oil-rich emirate in August 1990.
<p>
   On Monday, the Security Council rejected an Iraqi request to
lift the sanctions, saying Iraq had not met other conditions set
under the cease-fire resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf War.
<p>
   After three days of discussion, the 15-member council on
Wednesday approved a statement to Iraq calling the political and
territorial recognition of Kuwait ``a significant step in the
direction towards implementation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions ...''
<p>
   The council president, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, said
in her letter to Iraq that ``the members of the Security Council
will follow closely Iraq's implementation of its decision ...''
<p>
   Iraq's recognition of Kuwait is a fundamental step toward
lifting the oil embargo and other economic sanctions, New Zealand
Ambassador Colin Keating said outside the council chamber.
<p>
   The most important remaining issues are the release of Kuwaiti
prisoners still held in Iraq and satisfying U.N. inspectors that
all weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
<p>
   Keating predicted that the U.N. Special Commission monitoring
Iraq's weapons programs could conceivably report by March that Iraq
had met the disarmament requirements for lifting the sanctions.
Under the cease-fire terms, Iraq must eliminate its nuclear,
chemical, biological and long-range missile weapons programs.
<p>
   Political recognition will allow Iraq and Kuwait to talk
directly, potentially clearing up the issues of prisoners and
property plundered during the Iraqi occupation.
<p>
   Iraq abandoned its longstanding territorial claims to Kuwait a
week ago, hoping to win an end to the 4-year-old trade sanctions
that have strangled its economy.
<p>
   The sanctions were imposed after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
ordered the Aug. 2, 1990, invasion of Kuwait. The crisis  &MD; 
involving the region with most of the world's oil reserves  &MD; 
sparked the 1991 Gulf War, in which a U.S.-led multinational force
drove Iraq out of Kuwait.
<p>
   Saddam's decision to recognize Kuwait came immediately after he
ordered large numbers of military units toward the Kuwaiti border.
The United States immediately responded by sending thousands of
troops to Kuwait.
<p>
   French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee noted this during council
consultations earlier this week.
<p>
   ``It is a pity that the decisive step forward should have been
preceded last month by military posturing which brought back the
unhappy memories of August 1990,'' a diplomat at the session quoted
him as saying in French.
<p>
   Merimee called Iraq's recognition of Kuwait ``cause for
satisfaction and trust. We are approaching the time when we shall
be able to modify the sanctions regime,'' the same diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful
Eds: UPDATES with government commander saying observing truce, U.S.
State Department comment. Stands for 5th Ld to some points.
By CASIMIRO SIONA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Nearing a military victory over UNITA
rebels, Angola's army on Wednesday ordered its troops to hold fire
so a peace treaty could be signed to end 19 years of war.
<p>
   But with their forces pressed in the war-torn north, the
mistrustful rebels appealed for a rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the truce.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a statement repeated
hourly on state radio, called on his troops to lay down their guns
at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) and respect the truce ``scrupulously.''
<p>
   As the deadline passed, the government commander of the main,
southern front, said his men were holding fire as ordered.
<p>
   ``We are maintaining our positions and not advancing,'' said
Brig. Macedo Amarel. He said there was no sign of rebel troop
movements but warned ``we are on our guard.''
<p>
   Just before 8 p.m., military officials claimed that the northern
city of Uige, the last provincial capital under UNITA control, had
fallen to government forces. There was no independent confirmation.
<p>
   UNITA had occupied some government positions at Tando-Zinze in
the northern enclave of Cabinda but later were repelled, the
officials told The Associated Press.
<p>
   The cease-fire was called to allow President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos and rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to sign a formal peace treaty
Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels had threatened not to sign
without a cease-fire.
<p>
   The truce agreement, reached Tuesday night in Lusaka, was the
first for Angola since May 15, 1991.
<p>
   Optimism was guarded. All previous efforts to stop the war that
erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 have
failed.
<p>
   UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, said the truce was meaningless unless the United Nations
could guarantee the guns would remain silent.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged the rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to hot spots such as Uige and
Huambo, rebel headquarters taken by the government last week.
<p>
   UNITA charged the government was trying ``to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   U.N monitors and police are to fan out shortly after the signing
but a peacekeeping contingent will come only once a permanent
cease-fire, to take effect two days after the signing, is in place.
<p>
   The U.S. State Department praised both sides.
<p>
   Deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States was
``encouraged'' by the truce and that Angolans and the world would
``accept no less'' than a lasting peace.
<p>
   Dos Santos' spokesman, Ademiro Vaz de Conceicao, said the
president had called for a summit of the Frontline states to be
held Saturday, the eve of the signing, in Lusaka.
<p>
   Rebel and government delegations met in Lusaka to finalize
details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
out of sight in the bush, faces possible assassination if he
returns to Luanda.
<p>
   The government wants to limit the size of Savimbi's personal
bodyguard. After the 1991 peace deal he arrived in the capital with
a mini-army and stockpiled arms in UNITA offices.
<p>
   With just days to go before the signing, Savimbi's whereabouts
were unknown.
<p>
   Rumors that the rebel chief had been wounded or even killed at
the start of the latest government offensive were dispelled last
month after U.N. mediator Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with
the rebel leader in Huambo.
<p>
   But still he has not appeared in public.
<p>
   The UNITA delegation arrived in Lusaka from Zaire and there has
been widespread speculation that Savimbi had also fled Huambo for
refuge granted by his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
<p>
   Diplomatic sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the
rebels' southern Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Asked repeatedly by reporters about Savimbi's whereabouts, Gen.
Eugenio Manuvakola heading the UNITA delegation to Lusaka, would
only say: ``In Angola.''
<p>
   Savimbi has been weakened militarily and politically over the
past year. In addition to government battlefield successes, UNITA
has lost virtually all foreign support  &MD;  most importantly that of
Washington and South Africa's former white-minority regime.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than a half-million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   A 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

Biography: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Had an Affair With Robert
Kennedy
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and her
brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy became lovers after President
Kennedy's assassination, according to an author whose sensational
biographies have been criticized as inaccurate.
<p>
   In an updated edition of his 1989 ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' C.
David Heymann describes her relationship with Robert Kennedy as an
``on-again, off-again affair.''
<p>
   It began after Robert Kennedy moved from Washington to New York
the year after his brother's slaying in 1963 and lasted until his
own assassination in 1968, the book says.
<p>
   During that time, Robert Kennedy was married. The president's
widow married Aristotle Onassis in October 1968, four months after
Robert Kennedy's death.
<p>
   The books cites as sources Robert Kennedy's chauffeur, a woman
who said she saw the pair emerging from a hotel room in 1965 and a
socialite who nodded ``yes'' to whether the two spent nights
together at her home in Jamaica in 1966. None of the sources were
identified by name.
<p>
   Heymann also suggests that Mrs. Onassis hastened her own death
with morphine and Seconal rather than continue fighting an
untreatable cancer.
<p>
   Mrs. Onassis, who died at home May 19, had signed a living will
asking that no extraordinary measures be taken to extend her life.
<p>
   Nancy Tuckerman, a friend who frequently spoke for Mrs. Onassis,
declined to comment Wednesday on the book.
<p>
   The New York Post, which first reported the book's contents,
quoted Tuckerman as calling the claim about her death
``unbelievable.'' Robert Kennedy Jr. was quoted as calling the
claim ``really sick.''
<p>
   The original version of the book in 1989 generated accusations
that Heymann had changed the content or context of quotes and
hadn't spoken to people he said he had interviewed.

   Heymann's 1983 ``Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life and Legend of
Barbara Hutton'' was recalled by its publisher in 1984 because of
factual errors, including an assertion that excessive amounts of
drugs were prescribed for Hutton by a doctor who would have been 14
years old at the time.
<p>
   Heymann was not available for comment Wednesday, said Kent
Holland, spokesman for his publisher, Birch Lane.

Greece Beats San Marino 2-0 in European Championship Qualifier
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  &MD;  Nikos Mahlas scored one goal and Costas
Frantzeskos added another on Wednesday to give Greece a 2-0 victory
over San Marino in a Group Eight qualifying game for the European
Championship.
<p>
   The result gives Greece nine points and an 11-1 goals tally from
three victories. Scotland, Russia, Finland and the Faeroe Islands
are the other teams in the group.
<p>
   Greece's victory was rarely in doubt throughout the 90 minutes
of the game as the Greeks constantly kept the pressure on San
Marino players.
<p>
   Indicative of the Greek domination was the fact that goalie
Ilias Atmatzidis touched the ball for the first time in the 25th
minute, while the visitors' first attack was made in the 33rd.
<p>
   San Marino's goaltender Pierluigi Benedettini made a series
stunning saves throughout the game. He is definitely the player who
kept the score so low.
<p>
   Benedettini, however, was beaten by Mahlas whose backward
scissors shot in the 31st minute gave Greece a 1-0 lead.
<p>
   The visitors were more aggressive in the second half but they
never threatened Atmatzidis' goalmouth.
<p>
   Greece's Vassilis Tsartas hit twice Benedettini's bars, the
first after a penalty kick in the 46th minute and the second with a
lob in the 77th when he spied the goalie was out of position.
<p>
   The second goal came off a free kick by Frantzeskos six minutes
before the end of the game.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Greece: Ilias Atmatzidis, Stratos Apostolakis, Michalis Kasapis,
Yiannis Kalintzakis, Nicholas Dabitzas, Theodoros Zagorakis, Nikos
Mahlas, Vassilis Tsartas, Spyros Marangos (Costas Frantzeskos,
46th), Giorgos Toursounidis, Zissis Vrizas (Daniel Batista, 70th).
<p>
   San Marino: Pierluigi Benedettini, Luca Gobbi, Mirco Gennari
(Claudio Canti, 46th), Pier Domenico Della Valle (Brian Gasperoni,
77th) Mauro Valentini, William Guerra, Angelo Manzaroli, Fabio
Francini, Nicola Bacciocchi, Massimo Bonini, Davide Gualtieri.

New Study Says Exercise Is Like Money  &MD;  The More You Get, the
Better
Eds: CORRECTS in 4th graf to read guidelines, sted regulations.
By PAUL RAEBURN
AP Science Editor
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS (AP)  &MD;  It's true that a regular stroll in the park can
make your heart healthier. But the latest evidence suggests that
exercise is like money  &MD;  the more you get, the better.
<p>
   In the first study of the heart-disease risks of a large group
of serious runners, researchers found that the benefits of exercise
continue to climb even at the most intense levels of exercise.
<p>
   Runners who logged 40 miles (64 kilometers) a week, for example,
had a lower heart disease risk than runners who covered 30 miles
(48 kilometers) a week.
<p>
   Current U.S. government guidelines emphasize moderate exercise
for sedentary people but don't emphasize the continued benefits for
more serious exercise enthusiasts.
<p>
   As a result, some serious exercisers may be discouraged from
continuing, believing they are not getting any additional benefits,
said the study's author, Paul Williams, a researcher at the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.
<p>
   He discussed the findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the
American Heart Association.
<p>
   Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
sports-medicine specialists recommended that every American get 30
minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.
<p>
   Williams said that's an excellent suggestion for the 78 percent
of Americans who engage in little or no physical activity. But the
statement seemed to suggest that more intense exercise had little
benefit.
<p>
   Peter Wood of Stanford University, another authority on exercise
and heart disease, agreed with Williams that that's simply not
true.
<p>
   Many of the risk factors for heart disease  &MD;  including body fat,
cholesterol, blood pressure and triglycerides  &MD;  continue to improve
with more intense exercise, Wood said.
<p>
   ``Certainly we don't want to dissuade people who do nothing from
doing something,'' Wood said. ``But we don't want to shortchange
people who do a lot.''
<p>
   In a study of nearly 7,000 male runners recruited from the
readers of Runner's World magazine, Williams found, for example,
that 12 percent of runners who covered less than 10 miles (16
kilometers) per week had dangerously low levels of good
cholesterol. But that was true of only 2 percent of runners who ran
40 to 49 miles (64 to 78 kilometers) per week.
<p>
   Levels of good cholesterol climbed in a direct relationship with
the number of miles that runners covered each week, he found. Total
cholesterol also dropped with increasing mileage. And an indicator
of body weight likewise declined.
<p>
   ``People ask how much is enough,'' Wood said. ``I always say
it's like money: The more, the better.''
<p>
   The study included no women, and it would be hard to translate
the results to females because of the physical differences between
the sexes, Williams said. A study of women is expected to be
finished next year.

Toyota Expects '94 Sales to Top 1 Million, May Sell 50,000 Avalons
in '95
By MIKE McKESSON
AP Auto Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DETROIT (AP)  &MD;  Toyota expects to sell up to 50,000 of the
Japanese automaker's new Kentucky-built Avalon sedans in this
country next year without hurting sales of the Camry sedan on which
it was based.
<p>
   ``We basically consider it as additional volume,'' Toyota Motor
Sales vice president Robert D. Weldon said Tuesday at a Detroit
preview of the Avalon and the 1995 Tercel subcompact.
<p>
   An additional 14,000 Avalons will be exported to Japan, Taiwan,
Puerto Rico, Canada and the Middle East. ``At this point in time,
Europe is not on the export list,'' Weldon said.
<p>
   The Avalon was designed for the U.S. market and is being built
at the company's Georgetown, Ky., plant, which recently underwent
an dlrs 800 million expansion. Shipments to dealers began last
week.
<p>
   Classified as a full-size car based on interior passenger space,
the Avalon is aimed at buyers who are moving up from sedans such as
Toyota's Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and Mazda 626, Weldon
said. Other comparable cars might be Chrysler Corp.'s LH sedans and
Buick LeSabre.
<p>
   ``But our buyer for the Avalon is going to be an import-oriented
type buyer,'' Weldon said.
<p>
   Based on the Camry platform, the Avalon is 4 inches longer, 24
pounds heavier and can be equipped with a front bench seat so it
can carry six people. Prices range from about dlrs 23,000 to dlrs
30,000.
<p>
   Weldon said he expects one group of buyers will be the devotees
of the Cressida, Toyota's flagship sedan that was phased out after
the 1991 model year.
<p>
   Robert C. Maling Jr., another Toyota Motor Sales vice president,
said the company expects to sell about 80,000 Tercels in 1995. The
car comes in two-door and four-door versions. Prices start at about
dlrs 10,000.
<p>
   Weldon said calendar-year sales of Toyotas in the United States
probably will surpass 1 million for the first time this year, not
counting Toyota's luxury Lexus line.
<p>
   About half the Toyotas sold here are built in North America. By
1997, the company expects to be able to build 900,000 vehicles a
year in North America.

Roman Catholic Bishop Dies
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP)  &MD;  Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Barni,
an Italian-born prelate who spent much of his life in this Central
American nation, has died, church officials said Wednesday. He was
80.
<p>
   Barni died Tuesday night in the western city of Leon, Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo said Wednesday. The retired bishop had been
suffering from heart problems.
<p>
   Funeral services were pending, but church officials said Barni
would be buried in the provincial capital of Matagalpa, about 130
kilometers (80 miles) north of Managua.
<p>
   Barni was born in Monza, Italy, on Nov. 2, 1914, and was
ordained in 1941.
<p>
   He arrived in Nicaragua in 1951 and moved up through the church
hierarchy, eventually serving as the bishop of the dioceses of
Esteli, Matagalpa, and Leon. He settled in Matagalpa when he
retired three years ago.

Fighting Surges in Bihac pocket, Rebel Muslims Join In
Eds: UPDATES with Serb general calling on government troops to
surrender; trims.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Government troops protecting
the gateway to a U.N. declared safe area strained Wednesday under
the weight of a fierce assault by Bosnian Serbs, reinforced by
rebel Muslim fighters.
<p>
   With the Serb push in its 15th day and showing little sign of
abating, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic toned down his earlier
optimism, saying the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was
``extremely difficult.'' He and other senior government figures
accused rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia and regular troops of
the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army of backing the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Any involvement by regular Yugoslav army troops would draw harsh
international reaction, particularly after the United Nations eased
sanctions on Serb-dominated Yugoslavia for agreeing in August to
stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs with fuel and other war material.
<p>
   Izetbegovic said rebel Serbs in Croatia launched a helicopter
attack on Bihac, backing up a 30-tank assault on the town. Bosnian
Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic alleged three Yugoslav army missile
brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade were helping Bosnian
Serbs in attacks on Velika Kladusa, former stronghold of rebel
Muslim leader Fikret Abdic on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   Yugoslav news media said Bosnian Serbs and Abdic troops had
entered Velika Kladusa. But a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Koos Sol, said
the town was quiet, although there was some shelling nearby.
<p>
   The United Nations expressed scepticism about assertions of
Yugoslav involvement and major helicopter and tank assaults. Sol, a
U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, said U.N. peacekeepers ``have nothing''
that would support massive intervention either by Croatian Serbs or
the Yugoslav army.
<p>
   Government statements of cross-border involvement appeared
calculated to pressure the international community to act against
the Serb assaults.
<p>
   But the United Nations confirmed that 15 to 20 truckloads of
rebel Muslim troops crossed into northwestern Bosnia from Croatia.
Muslim-led government troops took control of the Bihac pocket after
toppling Abdic in August, sending his supporters fleeing into
Serb-held parts of Croatia.
<p>
   Most of the fighting focused on the Grabez plateau east of
Bihac, where the Serbs appeared to be testing well-dug in
government positions protecting Bihac and other government-held
towns sandwiched between the front-line and Serb-held parts of
Croatia to the west and north.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by rebel Serbs on the
Croatian side of the border against Bosnian government troops, and
suggested it would act unless the international community does so
first.
<p>
   Bosnian Serb Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic said his troops had no
intention of going into the ``safe zone'' of Bihac itself unless
government troops sought cover there. If they do, ``we have ... the
right to defeat them even in Bihac proper,'' he told Bosnian Serb
television. ``This is a last call for surrender.''
<p>
   Izetbegovic appealed to the Security Council on Wednesday to
take immediate action to halt a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serb
forces on the Bihac area.
<p>
   He made the plea in a telephone call to the president of the
Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright.
<p>
   Izetbegovic reported the Serbs were attacking along a front of
100 kilometers (60 miles).
<p>
   In Sarajevo, Izetbegovic criticized both the United Nations,
which has declared the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones'' and
NATO, which has conducted five air raids on Serb targets in Bosnia
at U.N. behest, for failing to protect Bihac. Tuzla, a
government-held northern city that is also a ``safe zone'' was
shelled for the third straight day Wednesday. One person died in
the barrage.
<p>
   NATO has been under pressure to respond to the fighting in the
Bihac pocket. The alliance wants to extend its mandate, currently
limited to Bosnia, to cover shelling from Serb-held lands in
Croatia into Bosnia.
<p>
   Two missiles, apparently fired by Serbs, landed near Bangladeshi
peacekeepers in Cazin, within the pocket, and NATO warplanes flew
over the area but took no further action.
<p>
   The prolonged Serb push in the Bihac region nullified gains by
government forces in the area where they captured hundreds of
square kilometers (more than 100 square miles) of territory. But
land wins remained elsewhere  &MD;  in a coordinated attack with Croat
allies two weeks ago, the government army took the Serb-held town
of Kupres about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Sarajevo in
central Bosnia.
<p>
   Cold and snow are likely to limit military movements during
winter, which is fast approaching in hilly Bosnia. Government
troops apparently have been trying to capture positions they can
hold during the winter and use as a springboard for new attacks in
the spring.
<p>
   Fighting was continuing north of Kupres, around Mount Majevica
in the northeast, and on the south edge of Mount Ozren in
north-central
 &TL; 
<p>
   Fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992 when minority Serbs
rebelled against a vote by Croats and Muslims to leave Serb-led
Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in
fighting that has left about 70 percent of the republic in Serb
hands.

Government Announces Economic Goals
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  President Ernesto Samper presented
Wednesday an economic plan to lower inflation, speed the
devaluation of the Colombian peso, and spur on economic growth.
<p>
   Samper's plan predicts 18 percent inflation for 1995, a four
percentage point reduction from this year's inflation rate. The
government hopes inflation will fall gradually to 10 percent by
1998.
<p>
   Samper said he hopes to bring the devaluation of the Colombian
peso against the U.S. dollar to 18 percent next year in an effort
to match expected inflation. This year the peso has only devalued
by 2.5 percent while inflation will top 22 percent, making
Colombian exports more expensive.
<p>
   The government is predicting economic growth of 6.3 percent in
1995. Increased oil exports should keep economic growth high for
the next four years, but Samper said economic growth in 1998 should
not top 6.3 percent.
<p>
   Samper said the primary objective of the plan, called the
``Social Jump,'' would be to raise the standard of living of the 12
million Colombians  &MD;  one-third of the population  &MD;  living in
absolute poverty.

Without a Baseball Commissioner to Hear his Case, Rose Waits
By HAL BOCK
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Baseball legend Pete Rose is a patient guy. He's
waited this long to get back into baseball. He can wait a little
longer. Or a lot longer, if that's what it takes.
<p>
   The deal, when Rose was barred from U.S. Major League Baseball
for life in 1989, was that he could apply to the commissioner for
reinstatement after one year. He was otherwise occupied the next
year, in prison for tax evasion. Now that he's available to apply,
there is no commissioner. You don't write a letter like that
beginning: ``To whom it may concern.''
<p>
   ``Our philosophy is to let baseball get its house back in
order,'' Rose said Wednesday, referring to the continuing labor
dispute that ended the season prematurely this year. Acting
commissioner ``Bud Selig's got more on his mind than getting a
letter from me.''
<p>
   Rose knows that reinstatement would mean almost certain
induction into the Hall of Fame. He views that as his just due.
``Without sounding arrogant,'' he said, ``I know the player I was
and you know the player I was. I was the biggest thing in baseball.
I sold the game for 25 years.''
<p>
   His 4,256 hits  &MD;  more than any player in history  &MD;  are eloquent
testimony to his accomplishment. The suspension for gambling is a
cloud that hangs permanently over the record.
<p>
   Rose said his betting was exaggerated. ``I paid a lot more in
lawyer fees then I ever lost in gambling,'' he said.
<p>
   Rose figures time is on his side.
<p>
   ``Every day that goes by is a plus for me,'' he said. ``When
Bart Giamatti suspended me he said I had to reconfigure my life.
I've complied with his wishes. All I can do is live life the way
you would want me to.
<p>
   ``I think today I am the best ambassador baseball has. The
people who run baseball don't want me around, but I've got a
nightly forum for two hours. I don't badmouth the game. The game
has been good to me. I love the game.''
<p>
   The forum is the Pete Rose Show, a radio sportstalk program
broadcast from Rose's restaurant in Boca Raton, Fla. The program
has just been picked up by SportsFan Radio Network, meaning it is
available for 140 markets including 43 of the country's top 50. He
co-hosts with Michelle Oaks. ``We disagree about everything,'' Rose
cracked. ``You'd think we were married.''
<p>
   Rose wonders about his chances with the next league
commissioner, a position that has been vacant for over two years.
``Will the next commissioner have the authority to reinstate me?''
he said. ``We don't know.
<p>
   ``The pessimists say anybody in history who was suspended for
life was ever reinstated. But what they don't say is nobody ever
applied for reinstatement.
<p>
   ``I intend to apply some day.''

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: UPDATES throughout with record for egg, will be led with
diamond sale

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Tsar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, fetched a
record 7.3 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.6 million) Wednesday.
<p>
   The price paid for the so-called Winter Egg, which the tsar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, was
dlrs 2 million more than the previous high for an imperial egg and
exceeded the expectations of auctioneers Christie's.
<p>
   ``The market is very strong for great objects,'' said Anthony
Phillips, senior Vice-President of Christie's New York. ``A
wonderful rare piece unseen for years attracts great interest,'' he
said.
<p>
   The Winter Egg was last seen in public in London in 1949 when it
sold for dlrs 1,870  &MD;  about dlrs 45,000 at today's prices adjusted
for inflation.
<p>
   It is made of finely carved, transparent rock crystal, engraved
and set with over 3,000 diamonds to simulate ice crystal. It is
meant to symbolize the passage from winter to spring and opens up
to contain a basket of delicate flowers fashioned from platinum,
diamonds and quartz.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Tsar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and was crafted to mark the tricentenary of the
Romanov dynasty.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the tsar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, Faberge fled to Switzerland
and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known to exist, ten
of them are in Moscow's state museum and a further 11 belong to the
Forbes Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II owns three. The rest are divided between museums and private
collections in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's did not reveal the identity of the seller.
<p>
   The tense auction room, crowded with Russian potential buyers,
erupted in applause when the final bid of 6.6 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million). Christie's adds 10 percent to the sale price in
commission.
<p>
   The catalog sales price was is 3.5 - 6.5 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 2.7 - 5.0 million). The existing record was set by the Love
Trophy Egg, sold in New York in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's put
a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the biggest flawless
heart-shaped diamond sold at auction.
<p>
   Sotheby's sales director David Bennett said he expected it would
be bought by a Middle Eastern buyer. The 62.42 carat diamond is
newly cut and is classed as D-category  &MD;  the clearest and purest.
<p>
   The two big auction houses regard Geneva as the most important
international jewelry sales center because it is easily accessible
for Middle and Far Eastern buyers who want to make their purchases
in more discretion than is offered by New York or London.

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: UPDATES throughout with record for egg
By CLARE NULLIS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Tsar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, fetched a
record 7.3 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.6 million) Wednesday.
<p>
   The price paid for the so-called Winter Egg, which the tsar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, was
dlrs 2 million more than the previous high for an imperial egg and
exceeded the expectations of auctioneers Christie's.
<p>
   ``The market is very strong for great objects,'' said Anthony
Phillips, senior Vice-President of Christie's New York. ``A
wonderful rare piece unseen for years attracts great interest,'' he
said.
<p>
   The Winter Egg was last seen in public in London in 1949 when it
sold for dlrs 1,870  &MD;  about dlrs 45,000 at today's prices adjusted
for inflation.
<p>
   It is made of finely carved, transparent rock crystal, engraved
and set with over 3,000 diamonds to simulate ice crystal. It is
meant to symbolize the passage from winter to spring and opens up
to contain a basket of delicate flowers fashioned from platinum,
diamonds and quartz.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Tsar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and was crafted to mark the tricentenary of the
Romanov dynasty.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the tsar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, Faberge fled to Switzerland
and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known to exist, ten
are in Moscow's state museum and a further 11 belong to the Forbes
Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II owns
three. The rest are divided between museums and private collections
in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's did not reveal the identity of the seller.
<p>
   The tense auction room, crowded with Russian potential buyers,
erupted in applause when the final bid of 6.6 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million). Christie's adds 10 percent to the sale price in
commission.
<p>
   The catalog sales price was 3.5 - 6.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
2.7 - 5.0 million). The existing record was set by the Love Trophy
Egg, sold in New York in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's put
a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the biggest flawless
heart-shaped diamond sold at auction.

U.S. Couple Gets Waiver To Bring Adopted Son Home From Panama
By KATHARINE WEBSTER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON (AP)  &MD;  Army Sgt. Fred Cain wouldn't have left Panama
without his adopted 2-year-old son, Cameron. Now, thanks to a
last-minute humanitarian parole, he can bring Cameron with the rest
of his family to his new posting in Florida.
<p>
   Cain and his wife, Sandy, spent 18 months trying to adopt the
Panamanian boy, who has been living with them since he was 6 months
old. The adoption was completed Oct. 10.
<p>
   The next day, the Cains found out a new immigration rule imposed
a two-year waiting period before their son could get a visa to
enter the United States. But Cain was due for transfer to Florida
on Nov. 21.
<p>
   ``I never would have left him here  &MD;  I wouldn't allow that to
happen,'' Cain, a Brockton, Mass., native, said Wednesday from
Panama. He would have sought another extension of his Panama duty,
he said.
<p>
   But happily, the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service
approved the humanitarian waiver last week. The family plans to fly
to South Carolina on Monday and spend the Thanksgiving holiday next
week with family in Brockton.
<p>
   The Cains have two biological and two adopted children.
<p>
   Cain still doesn't know why the INS made it so difficult for him
to bring his son to the United States.
<p>
   The new rule concerns countries such as Panama and Romania that
do not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate births. As
of Oct. 1, the United States considers all births in those
countries to be legitimate, meaning both parents can be accounted
for.
<p>
   But that means Americans trying to adopt babies from those
countries must get approval from both parents, or proof that one or
both of the parents have died or abandoned the child. Often, in
reality, no one knows who both the parents are.
<p>
   Cameron's natural mother is a poor Panamanian Indian, who gave
the Cains permission to adopt her son, but didn't know where his
father was.
<p>
   Cain gave his sister, Eileen Cain of Brockton, the credit for
hounding the INS and the State Department on the family's behalf.
<p>
   ``She's not obnoxious or anything, but she doesn't take no for
an answer,'' he said, laughing.
<p>
   Eileen said the humanitarian parole came through after she
crashed a breakfast party at Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's campaign
headquarters Nov. 9, the day after he won re-election.
<p>
   ``I handed to his wife Vicki, who was awesome to me, all the
(newspaper) articles ... a letter begging for his help, asking him
to contact the head of INS on our behalf,'' she said. ``I was
crying and she was hugging me and I said, `Help me and my
family.'''
<p>
   Although earlier in the day INS officials had told her it would
be weeks before they could make a decision on the humanitarian
parole, they called back that afternoon and told her it had been
granted, she said.
<p>
   The Cains still want the rule changed, however.
<p>
   ``I think of the parents who are in the (United) States trying
to adopt, and their child has to stay in foster care for two years
before they can bring them home,'' Sandy Cain said.
<p>
   Eileen Cain is giving those other parents, many of whom have
called her, some advice:
<p>
   ``Kick up a storm and make them figure out what they're going to
do about this regulation that's tearing up these families,'' she
said. ``Children will die, because nobody will go through the
expense to adopt a poor child.''

Switzerland Defeats Iceland 1-0
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP)  &MD;  Switzerland defeated underdogs
Iceland 1-0 in a European Championship qualifier to gain a maximum
six points from both its group three encounters.
<p>
   Thomas Bickel netted a brilliant free kick in the 45th minute,
and Alain Sutter hit the goalpost with a blistering shot in the
second half. But the squad was frustrated by an unexpectedly strong
Icelandic defense.
<p>
   ``In the first half we played really well, but just for one
goal. We didn't have the luck we wanted, but we got the three
points,'' said English trainer Roy Hodgson.
<p>
   Switzerland, which advanced to the second round of this summer's
World Cup finals thanks to a strong core of Bundesliga stars like
Sutter, had hoped for a more convincing win.
<p>
   The team defeated Sweden 4-2 in its opening European
Championship qualifier. It next faces Turkey Dec. 14.
<p>
   A sellout crowd of 16,000 watched the match. Switzerland easily
defeated Iceland on the two previous meetings.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Switzerland: Marco Pascolo, Marc Hottiger, Stephane Henchoz,
Alain Geiger, Pascal Thueler, Christophe Ohrel, Ciriaco Sforza,
Thomas Bickel, Alain Sutter, Stephane Chapuisat, Marco
Grassi/Kubilay Tuerkilmaz (68th minute).
<p>
   Iceland: Birkir Kristinsson; Guoni Bergsson, Kristjan Jonsson,
Daoi Dervic; Runar Kristinsson, Arnar Gretarsson/Bjarki
Gunnlaugsson (64th minute), Hlynur Stefansson, Sigursteinn
Gislason/Haraldur Ingolfsson (84th minute), Thorvaldur Orlygsson;
Eyjolfur Sverrisson, Arnar Gunnlaugsson.

Preud'homme's Error Gives Macedonia 1-1 Draw With Belgium
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  &MD;  Top goalie Michel Preud'homme made a
beginner's error to hand Macedonia an upset 1-1 draw against
Belgium in their European Championship qualifying match Wednesday.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The poor home result leaves the Belgians struggling to keep up
with Spain and Denmark in the race for the top places in Group Two.
<p>
   Before the game, Belgian coach Paul van Himst predicted the
Macedonians would dig-in at the back and strike with rapid
counter-offense. He was proved
<p>
   just right.
<p>
   After a first half with nothing to do, Preud'homme was caught
cold just five minutes after the break.
<p>
   The man voted best 'keeper in last summer's World Cup, came out
to meet a long, looping ball from Vujadin Stanojkovic. But he
fumbled his catch and the balled bounced clear to striker Zoran
Boskovski.
<p>
   With the finest of touches, Boskovski flicked the ball with his
right foot and it trickled over the line for a 51st-minute
equalizer that stunned the 18,000 crowd.
<p>
   Until then, Macedonia had doggedly defended against relentless
Belgian pressure.
<p>
   The Belgians found a gap in the 30th minute, but even then
needed three chances to hit the net.
<p>
   Marc Degryse floated in a high ball that struck the crossbar.
Luc Nilis pounced on the rebound, but his angled shot was headed
wide before Gert Verheyen dashed forward to deflect the ball home
for 1-0.
<p>
   Boskovski's goal knocked the fight out of the home team.
Macedonia fell back to their earlier task of stubborn defense and
the Belgians only once came to close to scoring, when PSV Eindhoven
striker Luc Nilis grazed the goal post with a hard, low,
60th-minute shot.
<p>
   The Macedonian's greeted the final whistle with glee to
celebrate a hard-earned point in the first ever competitive match
away from home for the team from the former Yugoslavia.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Belgium  &MD;  Michel Preud'homme, Regis Genaux, Bertrand Crasson,
Danny Boffin, Rudy Smidts, Lorenzo Staelens, Franky van der Elst,
Johan Walem (Gilles de Bilde, 72nd min), Marc Degryse, Luc Nilis,
Gert Verheyen.
<p>
   Macedonia  &MD;  Danco Celeski, Vujadin Stanojkovic, Zoran
Jovanovski, Ilija Najdovski, Cede Janevski, Ljupco Markovski, Toni
Micevski, Bosko Djurovski, Zoran Boskovski (Dragan Kanatlarovski
87th) , Milko Djurovski (Zarko Serafimovski 81th), Marjan

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  President Ernesto Samper is to announce
a plan to end more than 30 years of guerrilla warfare this week,
but the presidential palace said Wednesday not to expect
face-to-face talks or government conciliation any time soon.
<p>
   Samper, who will announce the plan Thursday, said his
administration will work to end all forms of organized violence,
whether perpetrated by leftist guerrillas or semi-official
paramilitary groups.
<p>
   Paramilitary groups, sometimes including members of the armed
forces, have independently combated the guerrillas and drug
traffickers for years. Samper said several paramilitary groups told
the government they would disarm themselves.
<p>
   The president would not reveal the details of his plan on the
record, but reaffirmed his commitment to peace.
<p>
   ``I said from the start my government would search for peace,
not only with armed rebels, but also with ... the paramilitary
groups,'' he said.
<p>
   Guerrilla groups, like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, and the National Liberation Army, have stepped up attacks
in recent months to pressure the government to negotiate peace on
their terms.
<p>
   Samper said he would fight the powerful Cali cartel, which
supplies 80 percent of the world's cocaine, but emphasized he would
not allow the United States or other Western governments to force
Colombia into a war against the drug kingpins.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   MEXICO CITY (AP)  &MD;  Diana Laura Colosio, widow of slain
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, remained hospitalized
Wednesday in delicate condition with pancreatic cancer, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
<p>
   Mrs. Colosio has been in delicate condition since Monday, when
she took a turn for the worse, said the spokeswoman at Hospital
Medica Sur in Mexico City, who declined to give her name.
<p>
   Mexican newspapers have reported for months that Mrs. Colosio
has suffered from terminal cancer, but the family has neither
confirmed nor denied the reports. She has been hospitalized for 1
1/2 months.
<p>
   Luis Donaldo Colosio, the original presidential candidate of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, was gunned down March 23
at a campaign rally in Tijuana.
<p>
   Mrs. Colosio later traveled to Europe to promote a program
dedicated to her husband's memory and was received by Pope John
Paul II, and the king and queen of Spain.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QL; 
<p>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  &MD;  President Ernesto Samper presented
Wednesday an economic plan to lower inflation, speed the
devaluation of the Colombian peso, and spur on economic growth.
<p>
   Samper's plan predicts 18 percent inflation for 1995, a four
percentage point reduction from this year's inflation rate. The
government hopes inflation will fall gradually to 10 percent by
1998.
<p>
   Samper said he hopes to bring the devaluation of the Colombian
peso against the U.S. dollar to 18 percent next year in an effort
to match expected inflation. This year the peso has only devalued
by 2.5 percent while inflation will top 22 percent, making
Colombian exports more expensive.
<p>
   The government is predicting economic growth of 6.3 percent in
1995. Increased oil exports should keep economic growth high for
the next four years, but Samper said economic growth in 1998 should
not top 6.3 percent.

   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP)  &MD;  Missing its first-choice striker
Dennis Bergkamp through injury, the Netherlands was unable to break
through the Czech Republic's defense in a 0-0 draw here Wednesday.
<p>
   Substitute Patrick Kluivert should have scored shortly after
replacing Jouri Mulder in the 75th minute but fired wildly over the
bar from close range with the goal at his mercy.
<p>
   Kluivert, 18, the Dutch league's top scorer with 10 goals this
season, hung his head in despair after the miss.
<p>
   The Czechs nearly stole the match a minute into injury time when
substitute Petr Samec, brought on as a time-consuming exercise,
clipped the Dutch bar with a header.
<p>
   After a slow first half, the Netherlands injected more urgency
into its game after the rest but could not find a way to crack open
the Czech defense.
<p>
   Wingers Peter van Vossen and Gaston Taument both made good runs,
but as the Dutch pressed forward the Czechs looked threatening on
the counter attack.
<p>
   The Netherlands came close to breaking the deadlock after only
three minutes through defender Frank de Boer who headed against the
cross bar after a Wim Jonk free kick.
<p>
   Mulder headed the rebound wide.
<p>
   Two minutes later De Boer headed just over the bar as the
Netherlands continued to attack the Czechs from the air.
<p>
   The best Czech chance of the first half came after 16 minutes
when a clearance punch by Dutch goalkeeper Ed de Goey bounced off
Wim Jonk to Jiri Nemec whose right foot shot flew just wide.
 &UR; Lineups: &QL; 
<p>
   Netherlands: Ed de Goey; Stan Valckx; Danny Blind; Frank de
Boer; Rob Witschge (replaced by Arthur Numan 78th minute); Aron
Winter; Bryan Roy; Wim Jonk; Peter van Vossen; Jouri Mulder
(replaced by Patrick Kluivert 70th minute); Gaston Taument.

Prince Andrew Unveils Statue To George Canning Amid Tight Security
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  &MD;  Amid tight security, Britain's
Prince Andrew on Wednesday unveiled a statue to British statesman
George Canning on the second day of a visit marred by violent
protests on his arrival in the country.
<p>
   The statue was erected near the British embassy, the scene of
violent disturbances Tuesday night as police clashed with left-wing
youths protesting the visit of the prince who served as a
helicopter pilot in the 1982 Falklands War.
<p>
   Police said 27 people were arrested in the melee as protesters
burned British and U.S. flags and attempted to break through a
police barricade around the embassy compound where Andrew was
attending a reception.
<p>
   The prince, flanked by Argentine officials, said the statue was
testimony to the improved relations between the two countries which
resumed diplomatic ties in 1990.
<p>
   The statue, which once stood in a downtown plaza, was unveiled
12 years after being toppled by an angry mob who damaged its hands
and threw it into the River Plate.
<p>
   ``The restoration of Canning's statue is an important and
symbolic event ... because of the Argentine government's decision
to repair and re-erect his statue here,'' the prince said.
<p>
   The statue shows Canning draped in a cloak, holding a scroll in
his left hand and gesticulating with his right.
<p>
   Earlier this month, Britain's Prince Philip unveiled a statue to
Argentine independence hero Gen. Jose de San Martin in London.
<p>
   Canning, Britain's foreign minister between 1922 and 1927, is
recognized for his role in helping newly-independent Latin American
nations gain recognition from European governments.
<p>
   As a sign of anti-British sentiment after the 1982 conflict, the
government renamed a street and a subway station in Buenos Aires
which had formerly been named in his honor.
<p>
   Until 1983, the statue stood in the Plaza Britanica (British
square) which has since been named Air Force Square in honor of
pilots who fought in the Falklands conflict.
<p>
   During the ceremony only muted protests were heard as a
passer-by stopped his car and shouted ``Traitors'' moments before
the prince was due to speak.
<p>
   War veterans and left-wing groups have said the prince's visit
serves no purpose and that he symbolizes war crimes allegedly
committed by British troops during the conflict.
<p>
   Almost 1,000 people died in the 1982 Falklands War. Argentina
claims it inherited sovereignty over the islands upon gaining
independence from Spain in 1816, and accuses Britain of usurping
the archipelago in 1833.

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: CORRECTS spelling to ``czar,'' sted ``tsar.''
By CLARE NULLIS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, fetched a
record 7.3 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.6 million) Wednesday.
<p>
   The price paid for the so-called Winter Egg, which the czar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, was
dlrs 2 million more than the previous high for an imperial egg and
exceeded the expectations of auctioneers Christie's.
<p>
   ``The market is very strong for great objects,'' said Anthony
Phillips, senior Vice-President of Christie's New York. ``A
wonderful rare piece unseen for years attracts great interest,'' he
said.
<p>
   The Winter Egg was last seen in public in London in 1949 when it
sold for dlrs 1,870  &MD;  about dlrs 45,000 at today's prices adjusted
for inflation.
<p>
   It is made of finely carved, transparent rock crystal, engraved
and set with over 3,000 diamonds to simulate ice crystal. It is
meant to symbolize the passage from winter to spring and opens up
to contain a basket of delicate flowers fashioned from platinum,
diamonds and quartz.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Czar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and was crafted to mark the tricentenary of the
Romanov dynasty.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the czar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, Faberge fled to Switzerland
and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known to exist, ten
are in Moscow's state museum and a further 11 belong to the Forbes
Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II owns
three. The rest are divided between museums and private collections
in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's did not reveal the identity of the seller.
<p>
   The tense auction room, crowded with Russian potential buyers,
erupted in applause when the final bid of 6.6 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million). Christie's adds 10 percent to the sale price in
commission.
<p>
   The catalog sales price was 3.5 - 6.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
2.7 -5.0 million). The existing record was set by the Love Trophy
Egg, sold in New York in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.

Bishops Urge Expanded Roles for Women in Church
Eds: UPDATES throughout with reactions to pastoral messages,
recasts.

<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  The nation's Catholic bishops voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to make way for women to move up to the
top ranks of church theologians, administrators and canon lawyers.
<p>
   In a major policy statement on women in the church, the bishops
also pledged to reject authoritarian conduct, use gender-neutral
language in religious education materials and explore alternatives
for women to share power in the church  &MD;  short of the priesthood.
<p>
   And for the first time, the bishops confessed to their 59
million-member flock that the U.S. church is itself guilty of the
sins of sexism.
<p>
   ``We have listened to the sounds of injustice, and now come to
strengthen the bonds of peace,'' said Bishop Eugene J. Gerber.
<p>
   In other action on the third day of their annual meeting, the
bishops unanimously approved a policy statement on violence asking
Catholics to oppose both euthanasia and the death penalty, violent
protests at abortion clinics as well as abortion itself, budget
cuts affecting the poor and the proliferation of assault weapons.
<p>
   In past years, the ban on female priests  &MD;  affirmed by Rome in
the church's new universal catechism and in a papal letter earlier
this year  &MD;  has been at the forefront of debates on the role of
women in the church.
<p>
   In their new statement  &MD;  ``Towards Strengthening the Bonds of
Peace''  &MD;  the bishops said now that the pope has spoken
definitively against women's ordination the U.S. church needs to
look at alternatives.
<p>
   ``We commit ourselves to enhancing the participation of women in
every possible aspect of church life,'' the bishops said in the
statement, approved 228-10.
<p>
   They especially encouraged women to make inroads into the
traditionally clergy-dominated fields of biblical studies, theology
and canon law.
<p>
   ``In no way should these commitments be construed as `ecclesial
political correctness,''' the bishops said. ``They are
theologically correct.''
<p>
   In a specific recommendation addressing an area of concern to
U.S. women, the bishops said although the universal catechism does
not use gender-neutral language, in this country the church should
avoid using terms such as ``man'' or ``men'' when referring to all
of humanity.
<p>
   According to the bishops' statement, a National Pastoral Life
Center study found that women now hold 85 percent of parish
ministry positions open to non-clergy. But they have been slow to
move into high-ranking jobs such as diocesan chancellors, canon
lawyers or marriage tribunal members, and in some dioceses only
priests hold those positions.
<p>
   ``We are presented with a graced moment to restore our belief in
the equality of men and women,'' said Bishop John J. Snyder.
<p>
   Some prominent Catholic women embraced the statement Wednesday.
<p>
   Annette Kane, executive director of the National Council of
Catholic Women, a federation of 7,000 Catholic women's
organizations, said she hopes the statement will change some hearts
and minds in dioceses where women are excluded from leadership
roles.
<p>
   But Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice,
said promises of a greater role for women in the church ``are
beginning to ring hollow.'' A survey by her organization found that
women in 1993 held 19 percent of the top 5,400 positions open to
non-clergy. In 1988, women held 16 percent of the top positions,
according to the organization, which is not affiliated with the
church.
<p>
   In their other statement approved Wednesday the bishops sought a
new civility in public policy debates with concern for the common
good.
<p>
   The bishops said they support stronger gun control measures. At
the same time they called on Catholics to address ``the slow motion
violence of discrimination and poverty, hunger and hopelessness,
addiction and self-destructive behavior.''

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: UPDATES with diamond sale, FIXES spelling of Czar to conform

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, fetched a
record 7.3 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.6 million) Wednesday.
<p>
   In a second auction, the biggest flawless heart-shaped diamond
ever sold publicly went for 6.8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.2
million).
<p>
   Both sales in luxury Geneva lakeside hotels exceeded the
expectations of auctioneers Christie's and Sotheby's.
<p>
   The price paid for the so-called Winter Egg, which the czar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, was
dlrs 2 million more than the previous high for an imperial egg.
<p>
   ``The market is very strong for great objects,'' said Anthony
Phillips, senior Vice-President of Christie's New York. ``A
wonderful rare piece unseen for years attracts great interest,'' he
said.
<p>
   The Winter Egg was last seen in public in London in 1949 when it
sold for dlrs 1,870  &MD;  about dlrs 45,000 at today's prices adjusted
for inflation.
<p>
   It is made of finely carved, transparent rock crystal, engraved
and set with over 3,000 diamonds to simulate ice crystal. It is
meant to symbolize the passage from winter to spring and opens up
to contain a basket of delicate flowers fashioned from platinum,
diamonds and quartz.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Czar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and was crafted to mark the tricentenary of the
Romanov dynasty.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the czar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, Faberge fled to Switzerland
and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known to exist, ten
of them are in Moscow's state museum and a further 11 belong to the
Forbes Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II owns three. The rest are divided between museums and private
collections in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's did not reveal the identity of the seller.
<p>
   The tense auction room, crowded with Russian potential buyers,
erupted in applause when the final bid of 6.6 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million). Christie's adds 10 percent to the sale price in
commission.
<p>
   The catalog sales price was is 3.5 - 6.5 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 2.7 - 5.0 million). The existing record was set by the Love
Trophy Egg, sold in New York in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's had
put a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the 62.42 carat
diamond. It is newly cut and classed as D-category  &MD;  the clearest
and purest.
<p>
   The two big auction houses regard Geneva as the most important
international jewelry sales center because it is easily accessible
for Middle and Far Eastern buyers who want to make their purchases
in more discretion than is offered by New York or London.

BC-Bermuda-Taxes,
Bermudan Parties Reject Call for Income Tax
By PAUL EGAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP)  &MD;  A former Cabinet Minister and longtime
businessman says this British colony in the Atlantic needs an
income tax but both of the island's political parties are rejecting
the idea.
<p>
   Sir John Plowman, who was the governing United Bermuda Party's
leader in the Senate from 1968 to 1982, said imposing an income tax
would help the struggling tourism industry and assure a stable
society.
<p>
   If the island introduces a 20 percent flat rate income tax
similar to that in the Channel Island of Jersey, it can cut Customs
duties by 60 percent and eliminate the $15 tax paid by departing
visitors, he said.
<p>
   Plowman, 86, said he fears Bermuda is rapidly creating ``a
substantial group of second-class citizens who see no prospect of
having any share of the otherwise general prosperity.''
<p>
   ``Unless something is done, and done soon, we will all pay a
heavy price,'' he said.
<p>
   Nearly half of the $350 million government money was collected
last year came from Customs duties. Merchants have said the duties
translate into high prices for residents and tourists.
<p>
   But David Saul, finance minister in the UBP Government, said a
Canadian consultant just completed a review of Bermuda's tax system
that did not include an income tax.
<p>
   Income tax was once part of the platform of the Opposition
Progressive Labor Party but Eugene Cox, the PLP's finance
spokesman, says his party no longer favors it.
<p>
   Plowman is chairman of the Bermuda car dealership Holmes,
Williams, and Purvey Ltd.

World Law Of The Sea, Long Opposed By US, Quietly Goes Into Effect
By LLOYD WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP)  &MD;  A law that governs international use of
the world's oceans went into effect Wednesday as representatives of
more than 60 countries convened a three-day maritime conference.
<p>
   ``The dream of a comprehensive law for the oceans is an old one.
Turning this dream into a reality has been one of the greatest
achievements of this century ... It will be one of our most
enduring legacies,'' U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
told 500 delegates at the convention's opening ceremony.
<p>
   The International Law of the Sea, in negotiations since 1973,
regulates the use of the world's ocean resources in everything from
deep-sea fishing to seabed mining.
<p>
   The delegates, including ministers from the 13-member Caribbean
Community, were here to inaugurate the International Seabed
Authority, one of the agencies created by the new law.
<p>
   The authority will monitor and manage the use of resources of
the seabed beyond the areas that fall on national jurisdictions. It
is receiving $2.5 million in U.N. funds to finance its first year
of operations.
<p>
   Jamaica was chosen over Fiji and Malta in 1981 to host the
authority headquarters during a U.N. Conference on the Law of the
Sea in Geneva.
<p>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said the entry into force of the
Law of the Sea marks a unique event in Jamaica's history.
<p>
   ``A small island-state, for the first time, enjoys the singular
honor of being endorsed as the headquarters of a body intended to
serve the entire international community,'' he said.
<p>
   The U.N. General Assembly ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty
with the support of 60 countries after approving on July amendments
that eliminated provisions the United States and other
industrialized nations saw as violating free-market principles.
<p>
   Industrialized nations and the United States opposed provisions
in a 1982 version of the treaty that required mining companies to
pay huge fees before commercial mining or exploration and to share
their seabed technology with developing nations.
<p>
   The treaty needed the approval of key industrialized nations to
be effective.

Stock Market Closes Higher

<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Stocks rose, even as bonds and the dollar lost
ground in reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate
increase on Tuesday.
<p>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted moderate gains for most
of the day, boosted by big runups in four components: Eastman
Kodak, Boeing, Procter and Gamble, and United Technologies.
<p>
   The broader market underperformed the blue chip gauge throughout
the session until a big burst of buying in the last 30 minutes of
trading propelled stock indexes decisively higher.
<p>
   The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down dlrs 6.25 per dlrs 1,000
face value and yielding 8.08 percent. The dollar was slightly
weaker, trading at 98.38 Japanese yen and just over 1.55 Deutsche
marks.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve raised two key short-term
interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, prompting banks to
increase their prime lending rate to their best customers.
<p>
   While the stock market gave the news a mixed reaction on
Tuesday, on Wednesday they worried that higher rates could cut into
economic growth and compromise corporate earnings, said Peter
Canelo, market strategist at NatWest Securities.
<p>
   Higher rates also make fixed-income investments, such as bonds,
more attractive than stocks as an investment, Canelo noted. ``As
long as bond yields remain above 8 percent, it's very hard for the
stock market to rally and sustain a rally.''
<p>
   Bonds initially rose after the Labor Department reported that
consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in October, and that the
so-called ``core'' rate of consumer inflation, minus volatile food
and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent.
<p>
   Analysts had expected a 0.2-percent increase in the overall rate
and a 0.3-percentage point jump in the core rate.
<p>
   But bonds headed lower after the government said that Americans'
weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 1.5 percent in
October. That was the biggest monthly gain in more than 12 years.
<p>
   Also pressuring bonds was a Commerce Department report that
business inventories rose 0.5 percent in September, the sixth
straight advance. But business sales fell during the month,
declining by 0.2 percent after a big surge in August.
<p>
   In addition, some analysts and traders questioned whether Fed
moved aggressively enough or soon enough to forestall inflation.
<p>
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 18.84 to
3,845.20.
<p>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 6 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,040 up, 1,206 down and 679
unchanged.
<p>
   Big Board volume totaled 296.98 million shares as of 4 p.m.
(2100 GMT), against 336.34 million in the previous session.
<p>
   The NYSE's composite index rose 0.19 at 254.71. Standard and
Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.59 to 465.62.
<p>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.09 to 768.93. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.23 at 448.38.

Croatia Upsets Italy 2-1
EDS: will be UPDATED with details, quotes
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PALERMO, Sicily (AP)  &MD;  Striker Davor Suker scored one goal in
each half to give Croatia a 2-1 upset victory against Italy in an
European Championship qualifying match Wednesday night.
<p>
   The victory on the road gave Croatia an undisputed lead in
Group-Four standings, with nine points out of a perfect record of
three wins in as many games.
<p>
   Italy's first defeat of the tournament, in the game marking the
comeback of star-forward Roberto Baggio, left the ``Azzurri'' (Blue
Team) with four points  &MD;  their qualification chances in jeopardy.
<p>
   Suker, who plays with Seville in Spain, kicked in the first goal
in the 32nd minute, with a left drive from five meters (yards).
Italian goalie GianLuca Pagliuca touched the ball but could not
stop it.
<p>
   The Croat forward made it two in the 58th, with a perfect header
as the Italian defense proved unusually erratic and hesitant
following the retirement of longtime captain-sweeper Franco Baresi.
<p>
   Dino Baggio, the strongly-built midfielder who plays with Parma,
headed in Italy's only and useless goal in injury time - the 92th.
<p>
   Italian players, who lost the World Cup final to Brazil in
Pasadena last July, left the field among whistles and jeers of the
fans who had initially supported the home team with enthusiasm at
the Favorita stadium of Palermo.
<p>
   Italy takes on Estonia next while Croatia plays Ukraine in the
six-team qualifying group.

World Law of The Sea, Long Opposed By U.S., Quietly Goes Into
Effect
By LLOYD WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP)  &MD;  A law that governs international use of
the world's oceans went into effect Wednesday as representatives of
more than 60 countries convened a three-day maritime conference.
<p>
   ``The dream of a comprehensive law for the oceans is an old one.
Turning this dream into a reality has been one of the greatest
achievements of this century ... It will be one of our most
enduring legacies,'' U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
told 500 delegates at the convention's opening ceremony.
<p>
   The International Law of the Sea, in negotiations since 1973,
regulates the use of the world's ocean resources in everything from
deep-sea fishing to seabed mining.
<p>
   The delegates, including ministers from the 13-member Caribbean
Community, were in Kingston to inaugurate the International Seabed
Authority, one of the agencies created by the new law.
<p>
   The authority will monitor and manage the use of resources of
the seabed beyond the areas that fall on national jurisdictions. It
is receiving dlrs 2.5 million in U.N. funds to finance its first
year of operations.
<p>
   Jamaica was chosen over Fiji and Malta in 1981 to host the
authority headquarters during a U.N. Conference on the Law of the
Sea in Geneva.
<p>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said the entry into force of the
Law of the Sea marks a unique event in Jamaica's history.
<p>
   ``A small island-state, for the first time, enjoys the singular
honor of being endorsed as the headquarters of a body intended to
serve the entire international community,'' he said.
<p>
   The U.N. General Assembly ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty
with the support of 60 countries after approving in July amendments
that eliminated provisions the United States and other
industrialized nations saw as violating free-market principles.
<p>
   Industrialized nations and the United States opposed provisions
in a 1982 version of the treaty that required mining companies to
pay huge fees before commercial mining or exploration and to share
their seabed technology with developing nations.
<p>
   The treaty needed the approval of key industrialized nations to
be effective.

<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  Haiti should abolish its army just
as Costa Rica did decades ago, the former president of the Central
American country said Wednesday.
<p>
   ``I believe that the abolition of the Haitian army is an idea
whose time has come,'' said Oscar Arias Sanchez, winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to bring peace to Central
America.
<p>
   Arias said the military has been the greatest source of
instability in Haiti and throughout Latin America.
<p>
   Army leaders toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a 1991
coup and ruled by force until U.S. troops arrived two months ago.
The army, which worked in tandem with police, has been blamed for
thousands of political killings during those three years.
<p>
   Aristide has announced plans to separate the two, retraining the
police force and slashing the size of the army.
<p>
   The Haitian president, who appeared with Arias at the National
Palace news conference, at first declined to comment on the
proposal, but when pressed, said, ``The country is a symphony and
we have to hear all the voices.''
<p>
   Arias said the president made no promises but told him most
Haitians favor abolishing the army. The measure would require a
Constitutional amendment.
<p>
   Costa Rica, the most stable country in Central America,
disbanded its armed forces in 1948.
<p>
   In August, Panama's General Assembly approved a measure that
would ban a standing army in favor of a police force that answers
to a civilian president and is prohibited from political activity.
<p>
   Arias expressed skepticism about U.S.-led retraining of the
Haitian police force, recommending officers be drawn strictly from
the civilian population and not from among former officers.
<p>
   ``What we need is a civilian mentality,'' he said.
<p>
   U.S. officials declined to comment, but a Haitian politician
expressed vehement opposition.
<p>
   ``Costa Rica is not Haiti,'' said former Chamber of Deputies
President Antoine Joseph. ``We have an old dispute with the
Dominican Republic, which still dreams of occupying us. We need an
army to defend our territory.''
<p>
   He also said it would take years to change the Constitution.
<p>
   Arias acknowledged his idea might sound naive, but said many
people hadn't believed his Central American peace plan could work.
<p>
   ``There is no better way to consolidate and strengthen
democratic institutions than to abolish the armed forces,'' he
said.

Berlusconi Wins Another Confidence Vote on Cuts
Eds: UPDATES with 2nd confidence vote under way. Not expected to be
completed before about 2230 gmt, ADDS Fini running out of patience
on Bossi, deputy expelled
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Silvio Berlusconi won a key victory
Wednesday in his battle against Italy's huge deficit when the
Chamber of Deputies approved pension cuts put to a confidence vote,
but tension in his coalition kept rising.
<p>
   The measure, by a vote of 346 to 208 with one abstension, passed
with the backing of conservative coalition's sometimes troublesome
ally, the Northern League. The League still wants the government to
begin negotiations with unions which have vowed to keep up strikes
unless Berlusconi backs down.
<p>
   A second confidence vote Wednesday on additional pension
measures began late in the evening in the Chamber, where the
coalition has a solid majority.
<p>
   But Berlusconi will face a tougher time in the Senate when the
upper chamber gets its crack at the entire austerity package to
deal with the dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   There, the coalition of the Northern League, the right-wing
National Alliance and Berlusconi's Forza Italia party falls just
short of a majority.
<p>
   On Wednesday, tens of thousands of retirees, workers and
students joined marches in Milan, Bologna and other cities to
protest cuts. In Genoa, demonstrators occupied the port city's two
main train stations, delaying rail traffic.
<p>
   Incensed by both the cuts and the government's resorting to a
confidence vote, union leaders have called a general strike Dec. 2,
the second in six weeks.
<p>
   With the Senate battle looming, some Northern League leaders had
suggested that the government go ahead with the rest of its budget
proposal while separating pension reform so the government could
reconsider how to revamp pensions together with the unions.
<p>
   But Berlusconi, shortly before Wednesday's first vote, scoffed
at that suggestion, saying that would ``make us lose credibility
abroad and make us look ridiculous.''
<p>
   Berlusconi suggested that if he lost his budget battle, he would
have ''no choice but to go back to the voters.'' The premier would
have to resign in any case if he lost a confidence vote.
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's support
before the vote, said the League ``recognized the need for the
country to be governed.''
<p>
   But the League's proposal to modify the pension plan angered
Gianfranco Fini, National Alliance's leader, who took out his anger
on the League's No. 1, Umberto Bossi.
<p>
   ``If the attitude of the League's leader doesn't change, then
there really will be a crisis'' in the coalition, said Fini, who
has made clear the budget must first get passed before the allies
sit down and hash out their repeated differences.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
jelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome.

FBI Arrests Trenton Man Convicted of 1970 Rape, Murder of Girl in
Turkey
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP)  &MD;  A 57-year-old man convicted in Turkey of
the 1970 rape and murder of a young girl was arrested early
Wednesday by the FBI in connection with an extradition request from
the Turkish government, authorities said.
<p>
   U.S. Attorney Faith S. Hochberg said Mehmet Semih Sidali was
convicted by the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals, according to an
Oct. 31, 1994 complaint filed by her office.
<p>
   Sidali, who managed a Trenton apartment building where he also
lived, was arrested there.
<p>
   At an initial appearance Wednesday morning, U.S. Magistrate John
J. Hughes ordered Sidali held until another hearing on Friday. That
hearing will determine whether Sidali can be granted bail pending
the magistrate's eventual ruling on whether the suspect should be
extradited to Turkey, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew O.
Schiff.
<p>
   Schiff said Sidali originally was found innocent on a 2-1 vote
by a three-judge panel in Turkey. But after the prosecution
appealed  &MD;  a procedure not allowed in the United States after an
acquittal  &MD;  Sidali was convicted on a 24-8 vote by the Turkish high
court, Schiff said.
<p>
   A warrant was issued in March 1977 for the arrest of Sidali, who
was free at the time of his conviction.
<p>
   Schiff said the Turkish government has sent a diplomatic note to
the U.S. State Department seeking Sidali's return to Turkey under
the extradition treaty between the two countries.
<p>
   Schiff would not say how authorities became aware of Sidali's
whereabouts or the details surrounding his arrest.

Toney-Jones to Fight for Cable Television Viewers
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
AP Boxing Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LAS VEGAS (AP)  &MD;  Roy Jones Jr., who failed to cash in on Olympic
controversy, hopes to cash in on sheer talent against James Toney.
<p>
   The two will fight without guaranteed purses for Toney's
International Boxing Federation super middleweight champions Friday
night at the MGM Grand casino and hotel.
<p>
   If everybody who appreciates an action match between two
skilled, hard-punching boxers buys the fight offered on a
pay-per-view basis through cable television, Toney and Jones should
make a lot of money, and the winner should get a big boost in
popularity.
<p>
   Toney is guaranteed 45 percent and Jones 35 percent of all
revenues after expenses, which promoter Bob Arum said will be dlrs
1 million off the top.
<p>
   Although unbeaten, Jones is less known to the general public now
than he was when he lost the 156-pound (70.5-kilogram) final to
South Korean Park Si-hun on an outrageous decision at the 1988
Seoul Olympics.
<p>
   That cast Jones in the ever-popular role of uncrowned champion.
<p>
   It was a role that Evander Holyfield quickly cashed in on after
his controversial disqualification in the 178-pound (80.5-kilogram)
semifinals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Holyfield became a
cruiserweight champion in his 12th pro fight.
<p>
   ``I should have taken advantage of it, but my father didn't,''
said Jones, who turned pro under his father's management.
<p>
   Jones made a couple of early television appearances, but of his
first 20 fights, 15 of them were in his hometown of Pensacola, Fla.
<p>
   He won all 20 fights, 19 by knockout, but was hardly the
household name he had been after the Olympics.
<p>
   ``I wanted a title fight a little quicker,'' Jones said
Wednesday. ``I sat back and waited to see what my father's plans
were. Finally after four years of waiting, I took charge of my
career.''
<p>
   The 25-year-old Jones split with his father in 1992. It was just
one of many father-son relations in boxing to go sour.
<p>
   Of such relationships, Jones said, ``They deteriorate because of
jealousy and because the two people are too close.''
<p>
   Jones' career now is guided Square Ring, comprised of Stan
Levin, his brother Fred and a few other people, but it is Jones who
has the final say.
<p>
   ``Roy Jones Jr. owns Roy Jones Jr.,'' Stan Levin said.
<p>
   In his second fight, May 22, 1993, Jones outpointed Bernard
Hopkins and won the IBF middleweight title made vacant when Toney
moved up to the super middleweight division.
<p>
   Jones defended the 160-pound (72.5-kilogram) title once with a
one-punch, second-round knockout of Thomas Tate last May 27. He
relinquished the title because the IBF said it would strip him if
he moved up to challenge Toney.
<p>
   ``I don't think I've been able to show all my talent yet,''
Jones said. ``I mean, who have I fought who could bring that out of
me. Maybe Toney will ... if he can stand up to it.''
<p>
   ``I don't need him,'' Toney said. ``He needs me.''
<p>
   Toney will be making his third and what he says will be his last
168-pound (76-kilogram) title defense before moving up to the
175-pound (79.5-kilogram) light heavyweight division.
<p>
   The 26-year-old Toney has a 44-0-2 record, with 29 knockouts.
Jones' record is 26-0, with 23 knockouts.

U.S., Allies Would Ban Trade in Some Land Mines
Eds: Corrects to show agreement reached in U.N., not negotiating
group.
By CARL HARTMAN
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Members of the United Nations have have agreed
that there should be a ban on trade in anti-personnel land mines,
Deputy Director Ralph Earle II of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency said Wednesday.
<p>
   Approval of a U.S. proposal came without dissent in the U.N.
General Assembly's First Committee, which deals with security
matters, he said. Millions of such mines are still in the ground
throughout the world after the forces that planted them have left,
like the troops of the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
<p>
   ``They're not addressing tank-killers, they're addressing
baby-killers,'' he said.
<p>
   Earle spoke at a conference on holding down the international
traffic in arms, sponsored by the U.S. Center for Defense
Information.
<p>
   He said the accord on mines was reached without dissent at a
meeting in New York Tuesday. Participants were working on a
successor to COCOM, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls. COCOM was the international body formed to prevent
strategic goods reaching the armed forces of the Soviet Union and
China.
<p>
   It was dissolved as a result of the break-up of the Soviet
Union. Earle said the new system would in effect halt shipments to
what he called ``pariah'' states, such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and
North Korea.
<p>
   ``It's as far as I know the only current prospect for a global
conventional arms regime,'' he said. ``It will not be an embargo,
as it was in the past, but a list of items whose exports will be
controlled by national policy.''
<p>
   He said negotiations are going on among the COCOM members,
largely the members of NATO and Japan, and six others: Finland,
Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland and New Zealand. Earle added
that Russia, the world's biggest arms exporter after the United
States, is also interested, as are some other governments.
<p>
   Negotiations are being held as President Clinton's
administration considers a new policy on arms sales. Earle said it
would be several months before it is completed and announced.
<p>
   The new policy is expected to emphasize the role of U.S. arms
sales in preserving jobs and keeping arms industries alive and
prosperous.

Ukrainian Parliament Approves Key Nuclear Treaty
By LIAM McDOWALL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Progress in worldwide nuclear arms
reduction got a major boost Wednesday with the Ukrainian
parliament's long-awaited approval of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
   The action, on a 301-8 vote, puts the world's third-largest
nuclear power firmly on the road to total nuclear disarmament. The
former Soviet republic of 52 million people now is obliged to get
rid of its nuclear weapons by about the turn of the century.
<p>
   Coming after months of intense lobbying by the international
community, especially the United States, it also is a significant
step in strengthening ties with the West.
<p>
   President Leonid Kuchma, spurred on by Western support for his
economic reforms program, had staked a great deal of his political
credibility on steering the treaty through an often recalcitrant
parliament.
<p>
   ``It's the first time in history that a state that owns nuclear
weapons is voluntarily giving them up,'' Kuchma said after the
vote.
<p>
   Ukraine inherited an arsenal of 176 nuclear missiles and around
1,800 nuclear warheads when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
<p>
   The nation has dismantled an estimated 400 of the warheads and
sent them to Russia as part of an agreement among Washington,
Moscow and Kiev. But it had hesitated in ratifying the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Officials cited insufficient financial
compensation and a lack of security guarantees.
<p>
   Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told legislators before the
vote, however, that after months of negotiations, the United
States, Britain and Russia had provided satisfactory guarantees
hours earlier. France will provide a similar assurance later, he
said.
<p>
   Udovenko heralded the security pledges as a ``triumph for
Ukrainian diplomacy and Ukrainian independence.'' He stressed that
they included assurances against Ukraine being attacked by both
nuclear and conventional weapons together with substantial
financial support from the West.
<p>
   Kuchma, a former missile plant director, has portrayed
possession of the weapons  &MD;  which Ukraine has no capability to
launch  &MD;  as a profound liability.
<p>
   ``Experts estimate it will cost $10 billion to $30 billion a
year to keep nuclear weapons,'' he told legislators. ``It means we
have to sell all our possessions to keep them.''
<p>
   Oleh Vitovich, an ultranationalist who voted against the pact,
said: ``The decision has erased any future prospect of Ukraine
being a great nation.''
<p>
   A number of lawmakers voiced concern about the delicate
post-Soviet relationship between Russia and Ukraine, which is
struggling with ethnic Russian secessionists in Crimea.
<p>
   Responding, Udovenko read a short statement from Russian
President Boris Yeltsin which contained security guarantees
``recognizing the inviolability of Ukraine's territorial
integrity.''
<p>
   Both Kuchma and the United States were pushing for the treaty to
be accepted by legislators before his visit to Washington next
week.
<p>
   U.S. Ambassador William Miller described Wednesday's decision as
``a major step in the post-Cold War order that is being constructed
by the new nations.'' He also said it clears the way for Ukraine to
have ``normal, strengthened relations with the U.S.''
<p>
   Ukraine's participation in the global treaty will lift U.S.
export restrictions on high-technology, space and aeronautic
equipment and remove a Russian condition for its implementation of
the START-1 strategic nuclear treaty.
<p>
   Under the nonproliferation treaty, non-nuclear states foreswear
acquiring nuclear arms in exchange for aid from the nuclear powers
to develop peaceful nuclear energy. Ukraine, because it did not
develop its arsenal but inherited it, is defined as a non-nuclear
state.

New Government Harnesses Power of Television

By DONNA BRYSON
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)  &MD;  When South Africans switch on
their television sets, they'll see more black faces, hear more
African languages and be challenged by programs that reflect their
country's harsh realities.
<p>
   The South African Broadcast Corp. hopes to shape a vision of a
new multiracial nation.
<p>
   Television must cast an independent, critical eye on government
and society, says Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, chairwoman of SABC's
board. She is the black woman newly in charge of an institution
whose leadership was once unofficially restricted to white, male
conservatives.
<p>
   ``To provoke people to think  &MD;  that's exactly the role of
television,'' she said.
<p>
   South Africa's white leaders never doubted television had the
power to transform society. That's why they banned it entirely
until 1976 and then used it as a propaganda tool to reinforce
apartheid.
<p>
   The new government's goals may be more politically palatable,
but critics worry it will fall back on the old regime's tactics.
<p>
   Zwelakhe Sisulu, who in August took over as head of daily
operations at SABC, is the son of Walter Sisulu, the African
National Congress's deputy president and one of Nelson Mandela's
closest associates for 50 years.
<p>
   ``If you keep yourself in the mold of supporting the government,
you lose your independence, you lose your ability to criticize when
necessary, and in the process you lose your ability to inform the
public,'' said Olifile Tshweu of the Media Monitoring Project.
<p>
   The ANC ousted the white party associated with apartheid in
April, and promised to improve the lives of the black majority. It
also promised a more open society where media freedom is guaranteed
and government is accountable.
<p>
   But Matsepe-Casaburri, chairwoman of SABC's board, acknowledged
many staffers have found it difficult to embrace the new spirit
after years of surviving by pleasing the bosses of the day. Like
the rest of the civil service, many of the SABC's 5,000 employees
are black, but whites have dominated decision-making positions.
<p>
   Whites at SABC wonder if their jobs are secure under a black-led
government. White conservatives have pointed to proposals to change
the languages SABC speaks as proof blacks want to eradicate white
culture.
<p>
   The SABC's flagship station, TV1, now divides programming
between English and Afrikaans, the language of Afrikaners. The
African languages commonly spoken by blacks were relegated to two
other SABC stations that were started in 1981.
<p>
   SABC officials proposed last month that in the future all 11
official languages be given equal time on two stations devoted to
educational and information programs, and English would dominate a
third station run for profit and entertainment.
<p>
   Matsepe-Casaburri said it is simply a question of fairness  &MD; 
some African languages will be spoken on television for the first
time.
<p>
   Under apartheid, the SABC separated stations by race and devoted
most of its air time and resources to programming for the white
minority.
<p>
   In 1987, a telephone call from President P.W. Botha during an
evening news broadcast was enough to get the SABC to revise a
report on his ouster of a mixed-race Cabinet minister.
<p>
   SABC began to take on the look of the new South Africa even
before change was made official with April's vote. Beginning in the
late 1980s, viewers used to getting only the government's side of
the story began seeing and hearing black anti-apartheid leaders.
The SABC was praised for its evenhanded coverage of the election
campaign.
<p>
   Matsepe-Casaburri envisions a TV schedule that portrays the
sweep of South African culture. But the dramatic miniseries, ``The
Line,'' showed how difficult that may be.
<p>
   Inkatha Freedom Party supporters complained that the show blamed
the Zulu-nationalist party for the war between the ANC and Inkatha.
<p>
   SABC announced it would cease the three-part series after the
first episode was broadcast in July. Officials later reversed
themselves and presented the entire program, despite threats on the
lives of its producers and actors.

Faberge Egg and Heart-Shaped Diamond Highlights of Auction
Eds: UPDATES with diamond sale.

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA (AP)  &MD;  An intricate diamond-studded egg created by Carl
Faberge for Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last royal ruler, fetched a
record 7.3 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.6 million) Wednesday.
<p>
   In a second auction, the biggest flawless heart-shaped diamond
ever sold publicly went for 6.8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.2
million).
<p>
   Both sales in luxury Geneva lakeside hotels exceeded the
expectations of auctioneers Christie's and Sotheby's.
<p>
   The price paid for the so-called Winter Egg, which the czar
commissioned for his mother Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1913, was
dlrs 2 million more than the previous high for an imperial egg.
<p>
   ``The market is very strong for great objects,'' said Anthony
Phillips, senior Vice-President of Christie's New York. ``A
wonderful rare piece unseen for years attracts great interest,'' he
said.
<p>
   The Winter Egg was last seen in public in London in 1949 when it
sold for dlrs 1,870  &MD;  about dlrs 45,000 at today's prices adjusted
for inflation.
<p>
   It is made of finely carved, transparent rock crystal, engraved
and set with over 3,000 diamonds to simulate ice crystal. It is
meant to symbolize the passage from winter to spring and opens up
to contain a basket of delicate flowers fashioned from platinum,
diamonds and quartz.
<p>
   Faberge, known for his exquisite workmanship, created 56 eggs
for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1917. Czar
Alexander II started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife
each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to both
his wife, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and his mother.
<p>
   The first egg was the modestly named Hen-Egg, but the themes
gradually became more elaborate to include the Trans-Siberian
Railway Egg and the Alexander Palace Egg.
<p>
   The Winter Egg is one of the most ornate of the 47 known
surviving eggs and was crafted to mark the tricentenary of the
Romanov dynasty.
<p>
   According to a bill found in the Russian state archives, Faberge
charged the czar 24,600 rubles  &MD;  the highest price ever for an
imperial egg.
<p>
   With the outbreak of the revolution, Faberge fled to Switzerland
and died in Lausanne in 1920. Of the eggs still known to exist, ten
of them are in Moscow's state museum and a further 11 belong to the
Forbes Magazine Collection in New York. Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II owns three. The rest are divided between museums and private
collections in the United States and Europe.
<p>
   Christie's did not reveal the identity of the seller.
<p>
   The tense auction room, crowded with Russian potential buyers,
erupted in applause when the final bid of 6.6 million francs (dlrs
5.1 million). Christie's adds 10 percent to the sale price in
commission.
<p>
   The catalog sales price was 3.5 to 6.5 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 2.7 to 5 million). The existing record was set by the Love
Trophy Egg, sold in New York in 1992 for dlrs 3.2 million.
<p>
   In the other highlight of the Geneva autumn sales, Sotheby's had
put a price tag of more than dlrs 5 million on the 62.42 carat
diamond. It is newly cut and classed as D-category  &MD;  the clearest
and purest.
<p>
   The two big auction houses regard Geneva as the most important
international jewelry sales center because it is easily accessible
for Middle and Far Eastern buyers who want to make their purchases
in more discretion than is offered by New York or London.

U.S. Soccer League Won't Arrive Until 1996, At Earliest
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  In the wake of the World Cup's overwhelming
success, a premier league in the United States seems like a good
idea.
<p>
   It's an idea, however, whose time won't come at least until
1996.
<p>
   Alan Rothenberg, who put together the 1994 World Cup tournament
that was the most profitable in soccer history, said Wednesday that
Major League Soccer won't get under way until 1996.
<p>
   The delay is the second for the fledgling outdoor professional
league whose development was mandated by FIFA when it granted the
'94 World Cup to the United States. Original plans called for MLS
to start in 1995, although FIFA originally wanted a league in place
before the World Cup.
<p>
   ``Really, we had no choice but move it to April 1996, to make
sure we get off to a flying start, and I am confident that we
will,'' said Rothenberg, who also is chairman of MLS. ``From the
beginning we have all said it is far more important that we launch
Major League Soccer right than we do it on any particular ordained
timetable.
<p>
   ``Our steadfast goal is to do it right and we are not going to
be rushed into doing anything that we will regret later.''
<p>
   The cautious approach in lining up investors, stadiums, players
and team staff before taking the field has the blessing of FIFA,
Rothenberg said.
<p>
   ``They are fully supportive of what we are doing,'' Rothenberg
said. ``They, like we, want it to succeed.''
<p>
   Demonstrating FIFA's backing, league officials presented a
letter from the organization's general secretary, Joseph Blatter,
to Rothenberg.
<p>
   ``FIFA is less concerned with when MLS can get started than with
the quality of the product itself,'' Blatter wrote. ``Thus we fully
support the idea of the MLS delaying its start until 1996.''
<p>
   Rothenberg contends that only now, after having staged a hugely
successful World Cup this summer, are conditions right to raise the
dlrs 50 million minimum needed to start the league.
<p>
   ``All I know is that several weeks before the World Cup there
were still skeptics that we could have a successful World Cup, and
if you think in that same environment we could have been raising
tons of money, you are wrong,'' said Rothenberg, who received dlrs
7 million in compensation for his duties as head of the World Cup
organizing committee.
<p>
   ``We first had to silence the skeptics that this works.''
<p>
   Where it will work is also being finalized, with eight of the
proposed 10 franchises cities in place.
<p>
   Tampa and Chicago were added to the list of Boston; Columbus,
Ohio; Los Angeles; East Rutherford, New Jersey (Giants Stadium);
San Jose; and Washington, which were announced in June.
<p>
   A ninth team, Long Island (N.Y.), announced in the summer, will
not begin play until 1997 at the earliest because of stadium
problems.
<p>
   Though MLS  &MD;  and FIFA  &MD;  standards include grass fields,
Rothenberg is optimistic a solution will be found to keep the
league at Giants Stadium, which has artifical turf. ``We have had
serious discussions with people at Giants Stadium, and the move to
a 1996 start is also encouraging on that,'' Rothenberg said.
<p>
   Rothenberg promised that pro soccer in the United States will
not disappear in the interim. A series of international exhibition
games featuring the U.S. team and other national teams, as well as
top club teams from around the world, will be held in the league's
cities.

Berlusconi Wins Another Confidence Vote on Cuts
Eds: UPDATES with 2nd confidence vote winning
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Silvio Berlusconi won a key victory
Wednesday in his battle against Italy's huge deficit when the
Chamber of Deputies approved pension cuts put to a confidence vote,
but tension in his coalition kept rising.
<p>
   The measure, by a vote of 346 to 208 with one abstension, passed
with the backing of conservative coalition's sometimes troublesome
ally, the Northern League. The League still wants the government to
begin negotiations with unions which have vowed to keep up strikes
unless Berlusconi backs down.
<p>
   A second confidence vote late Wednesday night on additional
pension measures also won by an easy, 321-189 margin in the
Chamber, where the coalition has a solid majority. Again, there was
one abstension.

Dollar Softens on Profit Taking, Bond Market Weakness
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. dollar weakened Wednesday as
foreign-exchange traders took profits from a surge the previous
day, when the American currency derived strength from the Federal
Reserve's sharper-than-expected interest-rate increase.
<p>
   A sell-off in the U.S. Treasury bond market, despite new
evidence that inflation remains subdued, also hurt the U.S.
currency, analysts said. Currency dealers closely track the
American securities markets to gauge demand for dollars. Bond
prices have weakened substantially this year, while stocks have
stagnated.
<p>
   Still, currency market participants said the dip Wednesday
didn't portend a reversal of the dollar's recovery from a series of
two-year lows against the German mark and postwar lows vs. the
Japanese yen in mid-to-late October.
<p>
   The dollar has gained about 4 percent against the mark in the
past three weeks.
<p>
   ``It's no big surprise that the dollar came off today,'' said
Michael Faust, foreign exchange strategist at Bailard, Biehl and

   ``We had a good move yesterday, some people who were long
dollars took profits. And there's uneasiness when you see the bond
market weaken after a Fed hike,'' he said. ``The initial response
is to sell dollars, but today's action didn't signal anything
significant.''
<p>
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5505 marks,
down from 1.5557 late Tuesday. In London, the dollar rose to 1.5510
marks from 1.5455.
<p>
   The dollar also was changing hands late in New York at 98.35
yen, down from 98.76. In London, the dollar rose to 98.35 yen from

   In its sixth attempt this year to slow the economy and pre-empt
inflation, the Fed on Tuesday boosted its target for the federal
funds rate, a benchmark for short-term rates, 0.75 percentage
points to 5.5 percent. The move surprised financial markets, which
had expected a half-point increase.
<p>
   The Treasury market and the dollar rallied on the news, which
shored up the central bank's reputation as an aggressive inflation
fighter. Inflation erodes the value of securities that pay a fixed
rate of return.
<p>
   On Wednesday, after an early uptick in prices, many bond
investors sold off, seemingly shrugging off the Commerce
Department's report that U.S. consumer prices rose a scant 0.1
percent in October.
<p>
   Rick Porter, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New
York, said currency traders remain concerned that capital still is
flowing away from the United States, which decreases investor
demand for dollars.
<p>
   ``Foreign fixed-income buyers aren't investing here and U.S.
money managers aren't very bullish on dollar-based assets yet,'' he
said. ``It's a two pronged problem for the dollar as we look toward
the last six weeks of the year.''
<p>
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.3045 Swiss francs, down from 1.3095; 5.3240 French francs, down
from 5.3410; 1,587 Italian lire, down from 1,593; and 1.3648
Canadian dollars, up from 1.3639.
<p>
   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.5715, up from dlrs
1.5710. In London, the pound fell to dlrs 1.5725 from dlrs 1.5840.
<p>
   Gold prices fell slightly. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold for current delivery settled at dlrs 386.10, down 60 cents.
Republic National Bank quoted gold at dlrs 386.10, off 20 cents, at
4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT).
<p>
   Gold closed in London at dlrs 386.30 per troy ounce, down from
dlrs 386.60 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to dlrs 386.00
from dlrs 386.60.
<p>
   On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery rose 1.3 cent
to dlrs 5.222 per troy ounce.

   But Berlusconi will face a tougher time in the Senate when the
upper chamber gets its crack at the entire austerity package to
deal with the dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   There, the coalition of the Northern League, the right-wing
National Alliance and Berlusconi's Forza Italia party falls just
short of a majority.
<p>
   On Wednesday, tens of thousands of retirees, workers and
students joined marches in Milan, Bologna and other cities to
protest cuts. In Genoa, demonstrators occupied the port city's two
main train stations, delaying rail traffic.
<p>
   Incensed by both the cuts and the government's resorting to a
confidence vote, union leaders have called a general strike Dec. 2,
the second in six weeks.
<p>
   With the Senate battle looming, some Northern League leaders had
suggested that the government go ahead with the rest of its budget
proposal while separating pension reform so the government could
reconsider how to revamp pensions together with the unions.
<p>
   But Berlusconi, shortly before Wednesday's first vote, scoffed
at that suggestion, saying that would ``make us lose credibility
abroad and make us look ridiculous.''
<p>
   Berlusconi suggested that if he lost his budget battle, he would
have ''no choice but to go back to the voters.'' The premier would
have to resign in any case if he lost a confidence vote.
<p>
   A confidence vote is used to cut short debate.
<p>
   League spokesman Giuseppe Bonomi, announcing his party's support
before the vote, said the League ``recognized the need for the
country to be governed.''
<p>
   But the League's proposal to modify the pension plan angered
Gianfranco Fini, National Alliance's leader, who took out his anger
on the League's No. 1, Umberto Bossi.
<p>
   ``If the attitude of the League's leader doesn't change, then
there really will be a crisis'' in the coalition, said Fini, who
has made clear the budget must first get passed before the allies
sit down and hash out their repeated differences.
<p>
   Fierce opposition to Berlusconi's 7-month-old government has
jelled around the pension cuts. More than 1 million people heeded a
union protest call last Saturday and demonstrated in Rome.

Croats, Serbs Reach Tentative Economic Agreement
With AM-Yugoslavia
By BRANKA KOSTOVSKA
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)  &MD;  The Croatian government and rebel Serbs
reached agreement Wednesday on economic cooperation, and
international mediators called it a step toward achieving a
political settlement for Croatia.
<p>
   The economic agreement, which would restore water and
electricity to a dozen communities and reopen pipelines, still must
be approved by leaders of the respective sides.
<p>
   ``This is a significant step forward in the peace process,''
said U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith after more than 11 hours of
negotiations.
<p>
   An economic agreement could anchor international efforts to
reach a political settlement for Croatia, where rebel Serbs hold
one-third of Croatian territory captured in a six-month war in
1991.
<p>
   But previous efforts have repeatedly broken down. The Serbs, who
proclaimed their own state on the territory they control, refuse to
submit to Croatian government authority. The Croatian government
has threatened to retake the Serb-held land by force if necessary.
<p>
   U.N. resolutions and the United States insist on the territorial
integrity of Croatia and the eventual reintegration of Serb-held
territories.
<p>
   The economic agreement, to be implemented one month after it is
signed, would also reopen the highway linking the Croatian capital
Zagreb with Belgrade, capital of Serbia and what remains of
Yugoslavia.
<p>
   Diplomats maintain that reestablishing economic links could
facilitate future negotiations on an overall political settlement.
<p>
   Galbraith belongs to an international mediating team that
includes Russian Ambassador Leonid Kerestediants and European Union
negotiators Kai Eide and Geert Ahrens.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic accused the
Croation Serbs of a ``massive attack'' on the Bihac area of Bosnia,
a U.N. safe area, and appealed Wednesday to the United Nations for
action.

Spain Defeats Denmark 3-0
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEVILLE, Spain (AP)  &MD;  Spain tripped Denmark 3-0 in a European
Championship qualifying game Wednesday, picking up the victory on
goals by Miguel Angel Nadal, Brazil-born Spaniard Donato Gama da
Silva and Luis Enrique Martinez.
<p>
   The victory kept Spain atop Group 2 with nine points in three
matches. Denmark has four points from three matches.
<p>
   Nadal gave Spain a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute on a header off a
corner from Martinez.
<p>
   The Barcelona midfielder took a high, arching corner kick and
drove a header from eight meters that Danish goalie Peter
Schmeichel stopped but failed to control. The ball bounced directly
back to Nadal who headed it high over a leaping Schmeichel.
<p>
   Gama da Silva, in first international match, scored in the 56th
minute on a left-footed shot from 20 meters (yards) that bounced
just in front of the Manchester United keeper as he was dropping to
his knees to trap it.
<p>
   Schmeichel seemed to be fooled by the shot, which was deflected
slightly by a Danish defender.
<p>
   Martinez made it 3-0 in the 87th minute on a shot from 15 meters
(yards) that beat Schmeichel to his left.
<p>
   Spain controlled the early part of the match and had the first
three serious scoring chances. The most dramatic came in the 24th
minute when Gama da Silva struck a driving shot from 25 meters
(yards) that struck Schmeichel squarely in the face.
<p>
   Denmark got its first serious scoring chance in the 33rd minute
when Brian Laudrup shot just wide from 20 meters (yards). Moments
later, Mark Strudal had another clear chance from 15 meters
(yards).
<p>
   Denmark's best scoring chance in the second half probably came
in the first minute when Thomas Helweg's header from six meters
(yards) was stopped by the quick reflexes of Spanish keeper Andoni
Zubizarreta. The Danes took charge in the first few minutes, but
the pressure lessened after Gama da Silva's goal.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Spain  &MD;  Andoni Zubizarreta, Albert Ferrer, Alberto Belsue,
Rafael Alkorta, Abelardo Fernandez, Miguel Angel Nadal, Luis
Enrique Martinez, Jose Luis Caminero, Julio Salinas, Donato Gama da
Silva, Sergi Barjuan.
<p>
   Denmark  &MD;  Peter Schmeichel, Thomas Helweg, Marc Rieper, Lars
Olsen, Jens Risager, Jakob Friis Hansen, Brian Steen Nielsen, Kim
Vilfort, Mark Strudal, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup.

   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP)  &MD;  Dimitri Radchenko's equalizer canceled
out Scott Booth's opening goal as Scotland and Russia played to a
1-1 draw Wednesday in a European Championship qualifying match.
<p>
   The victory kept Scotland in second place in the tournament's
Group 8 with seven points in three games. Greece leads the group
with nine points in three matches, and Russia remained third with
four points from two games.
<p>
   Before 31,254 at Hampden Park, Booth gave Scotland the lead in
the 19th minute with his third goal in his seventh international
appearance.
<p>
   John McGinlay flicked on a pass from Alan McLaren, and captain
Gary McAllister threaded the ball into the box for Aberdeen striker
Booth to slot past goalkeeper Stanislav Cherchesov.
<p>
   Radchenko tied it six minutes later. After receiving the ball
from Igor Shalimov on the left, the striker ran through a
spread-out Scottish defense and rounded goalkeeper Andy Goram for
the score.
<p>
   Goram had to pull off two tough saves against last-minute
starter Vladislav Radimov to preserve the draw. In the 29th, Goram
stopped a Radimov header, then tipped over the crossbar a fine shot
by the midfielder in the closing seconds.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Scotland &MD; Andy Goram; Stuart McKimmie, Tom Boyd, Stuart McCall,

New House Republicans Vow to Cut Spending, Change Government
Eds: UPDATES with Panetta comments.
By DAVID ESPO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Members of the huge roster of House Republican
first-termers pledged loyalty to their conservative campaign agenda
Wednesday, vowing to cut spending and change the way government
works.
<p>
   ``We intend to do what we said we intend to do,'' Rep.-elect
Susan Myrick of North Carolina said as she and seven other members
of the 73-member group sat down with veteran lawmakers planning the
transition to a Republican-controlled House.
<p>
   Rep.-elect Mike Forbes of New York said the voters told him over
and over this fall of their frustration ``with Washington and the
bureaucracy in Congress.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, the White House was drawing a line against compromise
on Republican proposals it says could hinder progress on cutting
the deficit.
<p>
   ``The worst thing we could do now is to retreat from the
accomplishments that we've made so far,'' Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta told a business group Wednesday. ``If we start retreating
... we will erode the strength of the recovery that we now have in
place.''
<p>
   The Republicans have proposed that the House would vote on Jan.
19 on a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.
<p>
   Forbes and others got their first taste of closed-door meetings
in Congress as Rep. Newt Gingrich, in line to become Speaker in
January, said the new Republican majorities may be able to reach
accommodation swiftly with the White House on legislation to
enhance the president's ability to cut individual items from
overall spending bills.
<p>
   He said he, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and White House
chief of Staff Leon Panetta had a ``very, very good meeting'' on
Tuesday.
<p>
   ``If there is any effort to try to pull any piece of the
(Clinton) economic plan out that we think is important to the
progress we've made with regards to deficit reduction, we will
oppose that,'' Panetta commented after the meeting.
<p>
   Gingrich announced that Rep. Gerald Solomon, just elected to his
ninth term from New York, would become chairman of the Rules
Committee. The panel must approve the terms for debating each bill,
and thus is critical to a party's ability to maintain control over
the House.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Gingrich left the Capitol long enough to appear
before the a group of conservatives, where he said he was ``pretty
cheerful about cutting spending,'' and adamantly opposed to so much
as a discussion about raising taxes.
<p>
   ``That issue is over. It's gone. It's finished,'' he said to
applause Tuesday during an enthusiastically received appearance at
a conference of the conservative Heritage Foundation.
<p>
   House Republicans have proposed nearly dlrs 200 billion worth of
tax cuts, and the balanced-budget amendment would require an
additional dlrs 500 billion to dlrs 700 billion in cuts over about
five years.
<p>
   The Republican who will head the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee in the new Congress echoed Gingrich.
<p>
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas said Republican tax relief will not be
as costly as Democrats allege, ``and whatever we do is going to be
paid for by spending cuts.''
<p>
   Archer suggested that dlrs 50 billion could be saved over five
years in welfare reform alone. ``In addition, we are going to talk
about welfare benefits for illegal aliens,'' he said.
<p>
   In his remarks, Gingrich blended the challenge confronting the
Republican, 104th Congress with a critique of American society.
<p>
   ``It is impossible to maintain a civilization where 12-year-olds
are having babies, where 15-year-olds are killing each other, where
17-year-olds are dying of AIDS and where 18-year-olds are receiving
diplomas they can't even read,'' he said.

Berlusconi Wins Another Confidence Vote on Cuts
Eds: COMBINES urgent series
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ROME (AP)  &MD;  Premier Silvio Berlusconi won a key victory
Wednesday in his battle against Italy's huge deficit when the
Chamber of Deputies approved pension cuts put to a confidence vote,
but tension in his coalition kept rising.
<p>
   The measure, by a vote of 346 to 208 with one abstension, passed
with the backing of the conservative coalition's sometimes
troublesome ally, the Northern League. The League still wants the
government to begin negotiations with unions which have vowed to
keep up strikes unless Berlusconi backs down.
<p>
   A second confidence vote late Wednesday night on additional
pension measures also won by an easy margin in the Chamber, where
the coalition has a solid majority. That vote was 321-189, and
again there was one abstension. Both times many leftist deputies
walked out to protest the confidence manuever.
<p>
   But Berlusconi will face a tougher time in the Senate when the
upper chamber gets its crack at the entire austerity package to
deal with the dlrs 100 billion deficit.
<p>
   There, the coalition of the Northern League, the right-wing
National Alliance and Berlusconi's Forza Italia party falls just

Platt's Goal Wins it for England but Nigeria Impresses Again
By ROBERT MILLWARD
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WEMBLEY, England (AP)  &MD;  David Platt's first half header gave
England a 1-0 victory. But Nigeria provided more proof at the home
of English soccer Wednesday that it is a rising star and a strong
contender for the next World Cup in 1998.
<p>
   The African champion delighted its noisy, drum-banging fans at
Wembley by showing England, one of soccer's traditionalists, that
its brand of free-flowing, imaginative play may be the soccer of
the future.
<p>
   They didn't have a goal to show for it, but the 1994 World Cup
team at times gave England the runaround on its own soil.
<p>
   Platt's strike, his 24th for England in his 50th appearance,
came five minuted before half time when he headed in a free kick.
<p>
   England also had other chances, but its defense often got
repeatedly pulled apart by the Nigerians for whom midfielder Austin
Okacha had a standout game with ball control that sometimes
embarrassed the English.
<p>
   England, now unbeaten in six games under coach Terry Venables,
could have gone ahead after only 42 seconds.
<p>
   Alan Shearer collected a rebounded clearance and shot
left-footed towards goal only for Nigerian 'keeper Peter Rufai to
make a diving save.
<p>
   After that, most of the attempts on goal were at the other end
as Nigeria repeatedly sliced through England's midfield.
<p>
   In the ninth minute, Emmanuel Amunike floated over a cross from
the left to Rashidi Yekini, whose first time sliding effort beat
'keeper Tim Flowers but stayed out of goal.
<p>
   Daniel Amokachi, who plays in England for struggling Everton,
then nearly surprised Flowers by shooting from 25 yards (meters)
and the Blackburn goalkeeper scrambled the ball behind for a
corner.
<p>
   In the 18th minute, Yekini took advantage of indecision by three
English defenders to drift through the center without being tackled
but again Flowers saved.
<p>
   England, one of the world's oldest soccer playing nations,
sometimes was made to look like a beginner by a team regarded as
one of the emerging nations. But the home team produced two chances
within a minute to give its fans in the half empty stadium
something to cheer.
<p>
   Dennis Wise curled a center towards Shearer and goalkeeper Rufai
got enough of a finger tip to the ball to deflect it over the
striker's head. Then Robert Lee fired too high after a good header
down by Shearer.
<p>
   In the 35th minute, the Nigerians again caught out the English
defense with a swift break from the back. The ball was moved
quickly via Yekini to the impressive Okacha, who fooled two English
defenders into allowing him shooting space. Flowers was beaten this
time but the ball rolled across the face of the goal.
<p>
   England's first half goal seemed a little fortunate because the
challenge by Austin Eguaveon on Graeme Le Saux didn't appear to be
a foul.
<p>
   But Wise floated the free kick from wide of the left and Platt
beat team-mate Neil Ruddock to the cross to headed powerfully home
from six yards.
<p>
   Three minutes into the second half it was nearly 2-0 when Peter
Beardsley met a center from substitute Steve McManaman but his
glancing header was just too high.
<p>
   The Nigerians again linked up neatly going forward caused and
England some panics at the back. But England started to look just
as dangerous going forward.
<p>
   Wise sent a diving header just wide of the post and Shearer had
a similar effort saved by Rufai. Then John Barnes, playing in a
deep role in midfield, looped a long forward pass that caught out
the Nigerian offside trap in the 70th minute.
<p>
   The pass put Shearer clear of the Nigerian defense but the
striker shot wide of the far post with only Rufai to beat.
<p>
   Fifteen minutes from the end, Flowers produced the save of the
match to preserve England's lead.
<p>
   Mutiu Adepoju collected a headed clearance from the English
defense and launched a left-footed drive from 25 yards. The ball
appeared headed towards the inside of the left post but Flowers
took off, dived full length to his left and fisted the ball to
safety.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   England  &MD;  Tim Flowers, Rob Jones, Steve Howey, Neil Ruddock,
Graeme Le Saux, Dennis Wise, Robert Lee (substitute Steve
McManaman, 25th minute), David Platt, John Barnes, Peter Beardsley
(Matthew Le Tissier, 78th minute), Alan Shearer (Teddy Sheringham,
78th minute).

<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Stocks rose, even as bonds and the dollar lost
ground in reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate
increase on Tuesday.
<p>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted moderate gains for most
of the day, boosted by big runups in four components: Eastman
Kodak, Boeing, Procter and Gamble, and United Technologies.
<p>
   The broader market underperformed the blue chip gauge throughout
the session until a big burst of buying in the last 30 minutes of
trading propelled stock indexes decisively higher.
<p>
   The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down dlrs 6.25 per dlrs 1,000
face value and yielding 8.08 percent. The dollar was slightly
weaker, trading at 98.38 Japanese yen and just over 1.55 Deutsche
marks.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve raised two key short-term
interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, prompting banks to
increase their prime lending rate to their best customers.
<p>
   While the stock market gave the news a mixed reaction on
Tuesday, on Wednesday they worried that higher rates could cut into
economic growth and compromise corporate earnings, said Peter
Canelo, market strategist at NatWest Securities.
<p>
   Higher rates also make fixed-income investments, such as bonds,
more attractive than stocks as an investment, Canelo noted. ``As
long as bond yields remain above 8 percent, it's very hard for the
stock market to rally and sustain a rally.''
<p>
   Bonds initially rose after the Labor Department reported that
consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent in October, and that the
so-called ``core'' rate of consumer inflation, minus volatile food
and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent.
<p>
   Analysts had expected a 0.2-percent increase in the overall rate
and a 0.3-percentage point jump in the core rate.
<p>
   But bonds headed lower after the government said that Americans'
weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 1.5 percent in
October. That was the biggest monthly gain in more than 12 years.
<p>
   Also pressuring bonds was a Commerce Department report that
business inventories rose 0.5 percent in September, the sixth
straight advance. But business sales fell during the month,
declining by 0.2 percent after a big surge in August.
<p>
   In addition, some analysts and traders questioned whether Fed
moved aggressively enough or soon enough to forestall inflation.
<p>
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 18.84 to
3,845.20.
<p>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 6 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,040 up, 1,206 down and 679
unchanged.
<p>
   Big Board volume totaled 296.98 million shares as of 4 p.m.
(2100 GMT), against 336.34 million in the previous session.
<p>
   The NYSE's composite index rose 0.19 at 254.71. Standard and
Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.59 to 465.62.
<p>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.09 to 768.93. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.22 tot 448.39.

Croatia Upsets Italy 2-1
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PALERMO, Sicily (AP)  &MD;  Croatia, a newly-born soccer power,
overwhelmed the deputy world champions and sank favorite Italy 2-1
in a qualifying game of the European Championships Wednesday night.
<p>
   Striker Davor Suker scored one goal in each half for an upset
victory on the road which lifted Croatia to an undisputed first
place in Group-Four standings.
<p>
   The Croat team piled up nine points out of a perfect record of
three wins in as many games.
<p>
   Italy was left with four points out of one win, one draw and one
loss  &MD;  its qualification chances in jeopardy.
<p>
   Italian players, who left the field amidst whistles and jeers of
nearly 40,000 disappointed fans, appeared stunned.
<p>
   The ``Azzurri'' (Blue Team) were dominated throughout and could
score a useless goal only in injury time  &MD;  in the 92nd minute.
<p>
   Midfielder Dino Baggio, of Parma, headed in Italy's goal from a
few meters (yards) on a rare mistake by the Croat defense.
<p>
   ``It was a bad night for us, and a lucky one for Croatia which
scored a decisive goal on its first offensive action,'' said
star-forward Roberto Baggio, whose comeback to the national team,
after a long injury, was spoiled by Italy's first defeat in the
tournament.
<p>
   Roberto Baggio, voted as the best world player for 1993, plays
with Juventus of Turin and is not related to Dino.
<p>
   The return of Roberto Baggio, who missed a decisive penalty in
the World Cup shootout with Brazil, was expected to boost Italy's
offense.
<p>
   Instead Italian attacks produced few opportunities as Pierluigi
Casiraghi, Attilio Lombardo and Baggio were shutout by Croat
defenders.
<p>
   Baggio made his only sparkling move of the game in the 80th
minute. However his shot from a few meters was cleared from the net
line by Nikola Jerkan.
<p>
   ``They played definitely better and deserved victory,'' said
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi. ``Croatia was stronger physically and
technically tonight. I'm especially sorry for the fans, who
deserved a better game from our side.''
<p>
   Sicilian fans initially supported the home team with enthusiasm
at the Favorita stadium of Palermo. They expressed their discontent
with whistles and insults after Croatia's second goal.
<p>
   Suker, who plays with Seville in Spain, made it two in the 58th
minute with a perfect header on a cross from teammate Igor Stimac.
<p>
   He opened the score in the 32nd minute, with a diagonal shot
from five meters (yards). Italian goalie GianLuca Pagliuca, of
Inter, touched the ball but could not stop it.
<p>
   Croatia had its best scoring chances in the second half as Italy
pressed for the equalizer and left wide room for Croatia's fast
counterattacks, paced by Zvonimir Boban.
<p>
   Defense, once Italy's almost unbeatable sector, was unusually
erratic and hesitant, following the retirement of longtime
captain-sweeper Franco Baresi.
<p>
   In fact Suker, who was known to be Croatia's most dangerous
forward, was left unmarked in the penalty area in occasion of both
goals.
<p>
   Tomislav Ivic, the Croat coach in absence of suspended Miroslav
Blazevic, said Wednesday's victory ``is a historical result for our
team and our country.''
<p>
   ``We are overjoyed. We dedicate this victory to our land,'' Ivic
said.
<p>
   French referee Joel Quiniou, on his last international
appearance, booked Boban, Stimac and Robert Jarni on the Croat side
and Italy's Alessandro Costacurta.
<p>
   In the next qualifying games of Group-Four, scheduled in March,
Italy takes on Estonia. Croatia plays Ukraine. The two other teams
in the group are Slovenia and Lithuania.
<p>
   The lineups:
<p>
   Italy - GianLuca Pagliuca, Paolo Negro, Christian Panucci,
Demetrio Albertini (Roberto Di Matteo 55th), Alessandro Costacurta,
Paolo Maldini, Attilio Lombardo, Dino Baggio, PierLuigi Casiraghi,
Roberto Baggio, Roberto Rambaudi (Roberto Donadoni 46th).
<p>
   Croatia - Drazen Ladic, Elvis Brajkovic, Roberti Jarni, Igor
Stimac, Nikola Jerkan, Slaven Bilic, Aljosa Asanovic, Robert
Prosinecki (Mladen Vladenovic 57th), Davor Suker, Zvonimir Boban,
Nikola Jurcevic (Ardijan Kosniku 91st).
<p>
   Attendance: 38,000.

Irish Roll Over Outclassed Northern Rivals 4-0
Eds: optional lead planned
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)  &MD;  Ireland triumphed in hostile
territory Wednesday with a 4-0 victory over outplayed and
overpowered Northern Ireland.
<p>
   The one-sided win  &MD;  Ireland's first ever in Belfast, and
Northern Ireland's worst defeat at home in 15 years  &MD;  put Jack
Charlton's squad in first place in Group 6 the early running for
the 1996 European Championship finals.
<p>
   John Aldridge and Roy Keane swept past Northern Ireland's
confused back four for goals in the sixth and 11th minutes,
stunning the 10,500 northern fans at Belfast's sold-out Windsor
Park.
<p>
   Seven minutes before halftime, John Sheridan, taking a flick
pass from striker Niall Quinn, hit Ireland's third goal past
Northern Ireland hard-luck goalkeeper Paul Kee.
<p>
   Midfielder Andy Townsend, sprinting up the middle in the 53rd
minute, drove the ball under Kee's outstretched left hand for a
fourth goal, and the Dublin visitors coasted from there.
<p>
   ``We gave up two terrible goals at the start and it was downhill
after that,'' said Northern Ireland manager Bryan Hamilton, who saw
his young team fall to two wins, two losses in the group. ``It was
a disappointing evening and the players played badly. They know
that.''
<p>
   The match took place in an air of relative peace rare to
Belfast, thanks to back-to-back truces since September by the IRA
and its rival pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups.
<p>
   It contrasted sharply with the air of intimidation that hung
over Windsor Park last November, when Ireland and Northern Ireland
last played.
<p>
   That contest  &MD;  a 1-1 tie that secured Ireland's place in the
World Cup  &MD;  came in the immediate aftermath of 23 killings by the
IRA and pro-British ``loyalists,'' and hundreds of police were on
guard again lest the park's predominantly loyalist fans attacked
Irish supporters.
<p>
   Drunken Protestant fans from Northern Ireland shouted abuse at
the few huddled Irish fans, who celebrated quietly in the southwest
corner of the stands, but police intervened to prevent fisticuffs.
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Northern Ireland &MD; Paul Kee, Gary Fleming, Nigel Worthington,
Gerry Taggart, Stephen Morrow, Michael O'Neill (Darren Patterson,
45th), Keith Gillespie (Danny Wilson, 62nd), Jim Magilton, Iain
Dowie, Phillip Gray, Michael Hughes.
<p>
   Ireland &MD; Alan Kelly, Gary Kelly, Denis Irwin, Philip Babb, Paul
McGrath, Roy Keane (Jason McAteer, 45th), Andy Townsend, Jon
Aldridge (Tommy Coyne, 80th), Niall Quinn, John Sheridan, Steve
Staunton.

Brolin Stars In Swedish 2-0 Win; Leaves Game With Injury
Eds: UPDATES with Brolin surgery; CORRECTS spelling of substitute
Rehn
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Tomas Brolin scored one goal and set up
another before his fall season ended with a fractured left ankle as
World Cup bronze medalists Sweden beat Hungary 2-0 in a Group 3
European soccer qualifier Wednesday.
<p>
   Brolin, the only Swede named to the World Cup All Star team, was
injured when he crossed the ball for striker Martin Dahlin's go
ahead goal from close range with 20 minutes left.
<p>
   The 24-year-old midfield star was carried off the field on a
stretcher. He was examined by team doctor Jan Ekstrand in the
lockerroom before he was brought to the Karolinska hospital for
surgery.
<p>
   ``He will be sidelined at least three months,'' Ekstrand said.
``The operation went just fine. It was not complicated. These
injuries are quite common in soccer.''
<p>
   Brolin, who has been one of the top players during Parma's
successful fall campaing in the Italian first division, will remain
in hospital ``for several days'', Ekstrand said.
<p>
   ``Tomas' injury was a sad end to a great game,'' said Swedish
coach Tommy Svensson, who sent on Stefan Rehn to replace Brolin.
<p>
   ``Tomas showed world class again tonight. He's been our key
player all season long. He has played as well before, but never
better. I'm very sorry for him.''
<p>
   Sweden, playing its first European qualifier at home after the
World Cup, dominated heavily throughout the first half and
Hungarian defenders twice cleared the ball on the goalline before
Brolin connected in the 44th minute.
<p>
   Brolin, who beat goalkeeper Szolt Petry with a right-foot drive
from 15 meters, now has scored 24 goals in 41 national team
appearances, including a team-leading nine goals this season.
<p>
   The Swedes kept the pressure on in the second half against an
Hungarian team that relied on counter-attacks. Hungary has yet to
win a qualifier, having tied Turkey 2-2 in the first game.
<p>
   For Dahlin, it was the 22nd goal in 37 games for Sweden.
<p>
   The victory before a near-sellout crowd of 27,571 at Rasunda
Stadium moved the Swedes to six points and second place in the
standings. The Swedes beat Iceland 1-0 and lost to Switzerland 4-2
in the first two games.
<p>
   Switzerland, which beat Iceland 1-0 Wednesday, also has six
points from only two games but a better goal differential than the
Swedes.
<p>
   Goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, perhaps Sweden's biggest hero in the
World Cup finals, made two sparkling saves off free kicks from
Lajos Detari in the second half to earn the shutout. Ravelli played
his 121st game for Sweden and is now only four games short of the
world record held by England's retired keeper Peter Shilton.
<p>
   Referee Mario van der Ende of the Netherlands booked three
Hungarians, Geza Meszloy (39th minute), Florian Urban, (50th) and
Peter Lipcsei (52nd).
<p>
   Lineups:
<p>
   Sweden: Thomas Ravelli - Roland Nilsson, Patrik Andersson,
Joachim Bjorklund, Pontus Kamark  &MD;  Tomas Brolin (Stefan Rehn, 70th
minute), Jonas Thern, Stefan Schwarz  &MD;  Martin Dahlin, Kennet
Andersson, Henrik Larsson.
<p>
   Hungary: Zsolt Petry  &MD;  Janos Banfi  &MD;  Geza Meszloy, Emil Lorincz
 &MD;  Istvan Kozma, Peter Lipcsei (Gabor Halmai, 58th), Florian Urban,
Lajos Detari, Jozsef Duro (Kalman Kovacs, 75th), Jozsef Kiprich,

Romania Overtakes U.S. At Gymnastics World Team Championships
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DORTMUND, Germany (AP)  &MD;  No one was surprised when Romania and
the United States battled to a one-two finish Wednesday at the
Gymnastics World Team Championships after the women's compulsories.
<p>
   What was surprising was the big .862-point lead the American
women held over Romania going into the final event.
<p>
   But then the European champions rallied on the vault, while
three gymnasts on the experienced American team made costly errors
on the uneven parallel bars.
<p>
   ``It was a nightmare for me. I think I'm going to wake up in a
cold sweat tonight,'' said U.S. coach Steve Nunno. ``We hadn't had
a missed routine in two events.''
<p>
   Larissa Fontaine and Kerri Strug fell for the Americans. Even
Shannon Miller, the two-time world champion, struggled with her
dismount. Her resulting score of 9.535 was considered too high by
the crowd of 500 which booed.
<p>
   Romania finished at 192.720, shading the Americans at 192.682.
China was third at 192.321, followed by Russia and Ukraine.
<p>
   Romania was led by Lavinia Milosovici, an Olympic gold medalist
in the uneven bars. They were missing Nadia Hategan due to a torn
ligament.
<p>
   Milosovici turned in a score of 38.949, topped only by Lilia
Podkopayeva of Ukraine at 39.161 points. Not all gymnasts, however,
competed in all four events.
<p>
   After Friday's optionals, the six top women's teams will advance
to the finals Sunday. The event boasts most of the world's top men
and women gymnasts from 39 countries.
<p>
   ``I thought today went great,'' said gymnast Amanda Borden of
the U.S. team. ``We've been training our whole season for this
meet. And I kept telling myself `be confident.' ''
<p>
   Amy Chow, the first American competitor, missed an opening
dismount on the compulsory beam. Afterwards she and her teammates
turned in near-flawless performances on the floor exercises and
vaults.
<p>
   Miller turned in a dazzling 9.887 performance on the compulsory
beam, while Bordon scored a 9.800 on the floor exercises.
<p>
   Germany was the surprise leader after the men's compulsories
Tuesday. The optionals are scheduled for Thursday.

Lloyd Webber Foundation Buys Burne-Jones Tapestries
Eds: Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation was buyer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  The Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber Art Foundation paid
842,000 pounds (dlrs 1.34 million) for four antique tapestries
showing episodes from the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
<p>
   The purchase at Christie's auction house earlier in the day was
made by telephone from New York, where Webber's musical, ``Sunset
Boulevard'' was opening. At the time the buyer's identity was not
revealed.
<p>
   Later Wednesday, foundation spokesman Sir Tim Bell said the
tapestries would not leave Britain. They are to be restored then
displayed, but the exhibition place had not yet been determined.
<p>
   The panels, inspired by Sir Thomas Malory's epic poem ``Le Morte
D'Arthur,'' were designed by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Sir Edward
Burne-Jones and woven in 1890.
<p>
   The woven scenes of Arthur and his knights' epic search for the
Holy Grail fetched more than five times their pre-sale estimate.
<p>
   The works ``represent one of the most remarkable and beautiful
creations of the arts and crafts movement,'' said Nicola Redway,
head of Christie's 20th Century Decorative Arts Department.
<p>
   ``We are very pleased to see them sell to one buyer, which will
ensure they are kept together.''
<p>
   Burne-Jones and fellow writer, William Morris, developed a love
for ``Le Morte D'Arthur''  &MD;  which describes events leading to the
death of England's fabled King Arthur  &MD;  while they were
undergraduates at Oxford University in 1855.
<p>
   Six Quest of the Holy Grail tapestries were originally designed
and woven for Stanmore Hall, a stately home in north London
belonging to Australian mining millionaire William Knox D'Arcy.
<p>
   The four sold on Wednesday were part of the only other full set
in existence, made for D'Arcy's friend, the businessman George
McCulloch, in 1898.
<p>
   The tapestries are the work of weavers at Merton Abbey in south
London.
<p>
   One of the works, ``The Attainment of the Holy Grail by Sir
Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival,'' fetched a record 331,000
pounds (dlrs 530,000).
<p>
   Another, ``The Arming and Departure of the Knights,'' which
shows Arthur's troops taking leave of their families, sold for
210,000 pounds (dlrs 336,000).
<p>
   ``The Failure of Sir Lancelot,'' showing the famous knight
asleep outside the closed door to the Temple of the Holy Grail,
fetched 139,000 (dlrs 222,000).
<p>
   The legendary King Arthur was probably a Romano-British leader
who fought against the pagan Saxon invaders of the 6th century.
<p>
   The story of the quest for the Holy Grail and the Round Table
for the knights of his court at Camelot was developed in the 12th
century by the nobleman Geoffrey of Monmouth.

Croatia Stuns Italy
Eds: UPDATES to lead with Croatia beating Italy; ADDS other
results, details; trims
By JOSEPH WHITE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Seville striker Davor Suker scored two goals as
Croatia stunned World Cup finalist Italy 2-1 Wednesday in
qualifying for the European Championship.
<p>
   It was the second embarrassing result in the tournament for
Italy against a team from the former Yugoslavia. The Italians were
held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia in September, and are now in
jeopardy of missing the 1996 finals in England.
<p>
   Suker scored with a left-footed drive in the 32nd minute, and
nailed a perfect header in the 58th past an Italian defense that
has been unusually erratic and hesitant following the retirement of
longtime captain-sweeper Franco Baresi. Suker, Croatia's most
dangerous forward, was left unmarked in the penalty area for both
goals.
<p>
   The defeat spoiled the return of star-forward Roberto Baggio,
back from a lengthy injury layoff. His presence, however, failed to
inspire his Italian teammates.
<p>
   ``It was a bad night for us,'' Baggio said, ``and a lucky one
for Croatia.''
<p>
   The Italian players, who lost the World Cup final to Brazil in
Pasadena in July, left the field among the whistles and jeers of
the fans at the Favorita stadium in Palermo, Sicily. Their only
goal came from Dino Baggio in second-half injury time.
<p>
   ``(Croatia) played definitely better and deserved victory,''
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi said. ``Croatia was stronger physically
and technically tonight. I'm especially sorry for the fans, who
deserved a better game from our side.''
<p>
   Italy, with one win, one loss and one draw, dropped to third
place in Group 4 with four points. Croatia, making its debut in the
Europeans, has a perfect nine points after three games. Lithuania
moved up to second place in the group with six points after a 2-1
victory over Slovenia.
<p>
   Elsewhere, defending champion Denmark was shut out 3-0 in Spain,
Germany opened its campaign with a 2-1 victory over Albania, and
Wales suffered the most humiliating defeat in its history against
another first-time entrant, losing 5-0 to Georgia in Group 7.
<p>
   The Welsh loss, coupled with a 3-2 defeat last month in another
former Soviet republic, Moldova, all but closed the door on the
star-studded Welsh team's hopes for qualifying for the finals.
<p>
   ``The players and myself are ashamed,'' Wales manager Mike Smith
said. ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum
up a game like that? They were far better than us.''
<p>
   Georgia, playing in the Europeans for the first time since
gaining independence, scored its first goals and earned its first
points in the competition.
<p>
   World Cup semifinalist Bulgaria moved into first place in the
group, beating Moldova 4-1 on two goals from Barcelona forward
Hristo Stoichkov.
<p>
   Other highlights among the 18 qualifying games Wednesday
included Cyprus' first Euro victory in 26 years, and a third
consecutive scoreless draw for France.
 &UR; Group 1 &QC; 
 &UR; Azerbaijan 0, Israel 2 &QC; 
<p>
   In rain at Trabzon, Turkey, Israel kept second place in the
group after goals from Ronen Harazi, in the 30th minute, and Ronnie
Rosenthal, in the 51st. Israel has six points from three games, one
point behind idle Romania. Azerbaijan has yet to score in the
tournament.
<p>
   European governing body UEFA ordered the match played at a
neutral site because of civil unrest in the former Soviet republic.
 &UR; Poland 0, France 0 &QC; 
<p>
   In pouring rain at Zabrze, Poland, a frustrated French had to
play with 10 men after Nantes midfielder Christian Karembeu was
sent off in the 49th minute for a tackle on Poland striker Roman
Kosecki.
 &UR; Group 2 &QC; 
 &UR; Spain 3, Denmark 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Seville, Spain kept its perfect record with goals from Miguel
Angel Nadal in the 41st, Brazil-born Spaniard Donato Gama da Silva
in the 56th and Luis Enrique Martinez in the 87th. Spain leads the
group with a perfect nine points from three matches, while Denmark,
which won the title last time by qualifying only after Yugoslavia
was expelled, dropped to fourth place.
 &UR; Cyprus 2, Armenia 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Limassol, the semi-professionals of Cyprus took only the
second Euro qualifying victory in their history. The Mediterranean
island nation beat Switzerland 2-0 in 1968.
<p>
   Andreas Soteriou, in the seventh minute, and substitute Costas
Fasouliotis, in the 87th, scored the goals the Cypriots
surprisingly moved into second place in the group.
 &UR; Belgium 1, Macedonia 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Brussels, Macedonia continued its stunning run in its Euro
debut, with Zoran Boskovski's goal in the 50th minute giving the
former Yugoslav republic the draw. Gert Verheyen scored in the 30th
for Belgium.
<p>
   Macedonia drew with Denmark in its opening match in September.
 &UR; Group 3 &QC; 
 &UR; Switzerland 1, Iceland 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Lausanne, Switzerland had a tougher-than-expected time
against a stubborn Iceland defense, with Thomas Bickel's free kick
accounting for the lone goal in the final minute of the first half.
<p>
   Switzerland, with a maximum six points from two games, is tied
with Sweden atop the group, although the Swedes have played one
extra game.
 &UR; Sweden 2, Hungary 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Stockholm, World Cup star Tomas Brolin scored a goal in the
44th minute, then left the game with a broken ankle suffered when
setting up Martin Dahlin for the second score in the 70th. He'll be
out at least three weeks.
 &UR; Group 4 &QC; 
 &UR; Slovenia 1, Lithuania 2 &QC; 
<p>
   At Maribor, Slovenia, Audrius Zuta scored the winning goal with
three minutes to play, shortly after Lithuania was reduced to 10
men when Vytautas Apanavicius was sent off for a second yellow
card.
<p>
   Zlatko Zahovic gave Slovenia the lead in the 55th minute, and
Viaceslavas Sukristovas tied it for Lithuania it in the 64th.
 &UR; Group 5 &QC; 
 &UR; Belarus 0, Norway 4 &QC; 
<p>
   At Minsk, Norway improved to first place in the group with seven
points in three games. Blackburn defender Henning Berg started the
rout in the 35th, followed by Oyvind Leonhardsen four minutes
later, Lars Bohinen in the 52nd and Kjetil Rekdal in the 83rd.
 &UR; Netherlands 0, Czech Republic 0 &QC; 
<p>
   The draw at Rotterdam left both teams with five points in three
games, allowing Norway to leapfrog into first.
 &UR; Group 6 &QC; 
 &UR; Northern Ireland 0, Ireland 4 &QC; 
<p>
   In contrast to last year's emotional World Cup qualifier, this
game between rival neighbors was played in an atmosphere of peace
after recent the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups
declared cease-fires.
<p>
   John Aldridge (sixth minute), Roy Keane (11th), John Sheridan
(38th) and Andy Townsend (53rd) gave Ireland its first-ever victory
in Belfast and Northern Ireland's worst defeat at home in 15 years.
Ireland leads the group with nine points in three games.
 &UR; Group 7 &QC; 
 &UR; Georgia 5, Wales 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Tbilisi, Temoliz Ketsbaia scored in 30th and 49th minutes,
Georgi Kinkladze in the 39th, Gocha Gogrichiani in the 59th and
Shota Arveladze in the 66th.
 &UR; Albania 1, Germany 2 &QC; 
<p>
   Tottenham striker Juergen Klinsmann struck in the 18th minute,
Hysen Zmijani equalized for Albania in the 33rd and Ulf Kirsten
scored the winner in the 46th.
 &UR; Bulgaria 4, Moldova 1 &QC; 
<p>
   In a battle for first place at Sofia, Stoichkov scored in the
45th and 85th minutes, Krasimir Balakov in the 64th, and substitute
Emil Kostadinov in the 87th for Bulgaria. Sergiu Cleschenco scored
for Moldova in the 59th.
<p>
   Bulgaria moved into the top spot with a perfect tally of six
points from two games. Moldova, with two victories and a loss, fell
to second place on goal differential.
 &UR; Group 8 &QC; 
 &UR; Greece 2, San Marino 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Athens, Nikos Mahlas scored in the 31st and Costas
Frantzeskos in the 84th as Greece kept its perfect record after
three games.
 &UR; Scotland 1, Russia 1 &QL; 
<p>
   At Glasgow, Dimitri Radchenko's equalizer in the 25th canceled
out Scott Booth's goal in the 19th as both teams remained unbeaten.
Scotland stayed second with seven points in three games, and Russia
remained third with four points from two games.
 &UR; Finland 5, Faeroe Islands 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Helsinki, Finland won its first game and scored its first
goals in the tournament against the perennial strugglers from the
North Atlantic. Ajax Amsterdam striker Jari Litmanen (52nd and 72nd
minutes) and Mika-Matti Paatelainen (74th and 85th) scored two
goals each after Antti Sumiala's opening score in the 36th.
 &UR; Exhibition &QC; 
 &UR; England 1, Nigeria 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Wembley, England, which qualifies automatically for the Euro
finals as host nation, beat the World Cup heroes from Africa on a
24th minute goal from David Platt, his 24th for England in his 50th
appearance.

Yeltsin Vows to Defend Church Property Rights
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW (AP)  &MD;  President Boris Yeltsin promised Wednesday to help
the Russian Orthodox Church regain property seized or destroyed by
the Soviet state.
<p>
   Yeltsin met in the Kremlin with the church's leader, Patriarch
Alexy II, to discuss government support for church restoration, the
president's office said.
<p>
   After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, a communist campaign
against religion turned many churches into museums, clubs,
warehouses, even sports facilities.
<p>
   The buildings are still considered state property, and many of
their current managers are trying to get rights to them under
Russia's privatization program.
<p>
   The President proposed a moratorium on such privatization,
Yeltsin spokesman Vladimir Alexandrov said.

<p>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)  &MD;  Britain's Prince Andrew unveiled
a restored statue of a British statesman Wednesday that was hurled
into a river during the 1982 Anglo-Argentine war over the Falkland
Islands.
<p>
   The statue of George Canning was erected near the British
embassy, the site of violent protests Tuesday by left-wing youths
protesting the arrival of the prince, who served as a helicopter
pilot in the Falklands War. Police arrested 27 people during the
protest.
<p>
   The statue stood in a downtown plaza until 1983, when it was
toppled by an angry mob that damaged its hands and threw it into
the Rio de la Plata. It was later fished out of the river and
stored until it was repaired recently.
<p>
   The prince, flanked by Argentine officials, said the resurrected
statue was testimony to the improved relations between the two
countries, which resumed diplomatic ties in 1990.
<p>
   Canning, Britain's foreign minister between 1822 and 1827,
helped newly-independent Latin American nations gain recognition
from European governments.
<p>
   A few hecklers shouted at the prince just before the ceremony
Wednesday.
<p>
   Almost 1,000 people died in the 1982 war. Argentina claims it
inherited sovereignty over the islands upon gaining independence
from Spain in 1816 and accuses Britain of usurping the archipelago
in 1833.

   The Norwegians, who won 1-0 when the two teams played in Oslo on
Sept. 7, scored two goals in each half, all from different players.
<p>
   Henning Berg opened the scoring in the 35th minute with a
beautiful header. The Blackburn Rovers defender intercepted a

kick by Lars Bohinen, and drove it into the net.
<p>
   Oyvind Leonhardsen scored the second goal in the 39th minute.
<p>
   The pace got quicker in the second half despite the slippery
pitch, soaked by two days of rain and sleet. Belarus launched
several attacks but failed to finish them off.
<p>
   Norway got goals from Bohinen in the 52nd minute and Kjetil
Rekdal in the 83rd.

Pressures Mount as Congressional Vote on Trade Pact Nears
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Gore comments
By DAVE SKIDMORE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Fearing an embarrassing defeat, Vice President
Al Gore and other senior administration officials worked feverishly
Wednesday to shore up wavering Republican support for the GATT
trade accord.
<p>
   Their efforts came a day after Jesse Helms, chairman-to-be of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hinted he would hinder the
administration's foreign policy initiatives if President Clinton
pressed ahead on the GATT vote, now scheduled for Dec. 1.
<p>
   Shortly before Gore spoke, Newt Gingrich, the next House speaker
and a supporter of the pact to slash world tariffs, said he was
``very very concerned'' about its prospects in the Senate.
<p>
   Gore said at a news conference organized by businesses
supporting the trade agreement, ``The Congress will decide whether
the United States will continue to lead the world in global
economic issues or not. That's really what it comes down to.''
<p>
   Gore, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen all said the pact, negotiated under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, must be approved this year
by the lame-duck Democratic Congress.
<p>
   ``It is abundantly clear that a delay of the GATT would
definitely kill the GATT ... and hurt our country immeasurably,''
Gore said.
<p>
   The vice president said delay of even six months would reduce
U.S. economic output after 10 years by dlrs 70 billion and block
creation of 25,000 jobs.
<p>
   ``I don't know why any member of Congress would want that on his
or her record,'' Gore said.
<p>
   Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, sent a letter to Clinton
repeating his commitment to work toward ``a bipartisan majority
overwhelmingly approving'' GATT in the House on Nov. 29.
<p>
   Republican Sen. Bob Dole, expected to be majority leader in the
new Senate, has said he is predisposed to support GATT and would
prefer to vote this year. But because legislation implementing the
agreement cannot be amended, he is seeking administration support
for separate legislation early next year.
<p>
   That bill would strengthen the ability of the United States to
withdraw from the accord if U.S. interests were harmed. It also
would address a controversial deal that was struck with three
communications companies to give them a discount on valuable
licenses to develop the next generation of wireless telephone
systems.
<p>
   U.S. Trade Representative Michey Kantor, who had accompanied
Clinton to Indonesia for a Pacific trade summit, said he planned to
meet with Dole. He said the GOP leader's suggestions would be
``considered carefully.''
<p>
   Helms, a North Carolina Republican, and fellow Republican Sens.
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Larry E. Craig of Idaho wrote
a letter last week urging Dole to seek delay of the accord. They
said it would cut tariff revenues by dlrs 31 billion over the next
10 years without fully replacing them.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Helms released his letter telling Clinton that
presidential support for a delay would ``have an exceedingly
positive effect on my making certain that the administration
positions on all foreign policy matters ... will be considered
fully and fairly.''
<p>
   But Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, senior Republican on the Finance
Committee, discounted the possibility that Helms' position would
sway other senators, pointing out that textile firms in North
Carolina oppose GATT because it phases out trade protections for
the industry over 10 years.

Pentagon Says Three Army Tank Divisions Aren't Ready for Combat
By JOHN DIAMOND
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Three U.S. Army tank divisions whose
assignments include reinforcing South Korea and the Persian Gulf
are not fully ready for combat, the first time in 12 years the Army
has been so rusty, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Army refused to disclose which divisions were involved,
saying the information was classified. But officials commenting
only on condition of anonymity said the 1st Infantry Division,
Mechanized, at Fort Riley, Kan., the 4th Infantry Division,
Mechanized, at Fort Carson, Colo., and the 2nd Armored Division, at
Fort Hood, Texas, all received the next-to-lowest readiness grade.
<p>
   In a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday, the Pentagon
announced that three of the 12 divisions  &MD;  a quarter of the
active-duty combat force  &MD;  got the second-lowest readiness grade
from their own commanders.
<p>
   No immediate threat to the safety of the nation looms as a
result of the problem, senior Pentagon officials said. The three
divisions are backup forces that would relieve the leading edge of
a U.S. battle force weeks or months into a conflict.
<p>
   But if a major war were to break out, the divisions could be
pressed into action quickly.
<p>
   The 1st Infantry Division was one of the units scheduled to go
to the Persian Gulf in response to the recent tension along the
Iraqi border. It was never dispatched.
<p>
   Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Wednesday the readiness of fighting units is central to the
administration strategy of being strong enough to fight two
regional wars nearly simultaneously  &MD;  in Korea and the Persian
Gulf, for example.
<p>
   ``Were we satisfied in dealing with only one regional issue at a
time, we would in fact become a regional power,'' Shalikashvili
told students after a speech at Georgetown University. ``And it
wouldn't take very long for our adversaries, like Saddam Hussein,
to understand when our hands were tied in some other part of the
world.''
<p>
   Readiness, the Clinton administration's top military priority,
refers to a unit's ability to get to a war zone quickly and to
fight effectively. The Pentagon uses a complex yardstick that
includes training levels, the state of equipment, maintenance and
the skill level of individual fighting units.
<p>
   The units are graded from a high of ``C-1'' to a low of ``C-4.''
The three armored divisions, each with 18,000 soldiers and a
complement of tanks and armored vehicles, were graded C-3. That
means the units may undertake ``many but not all wartime missions''
and they suffer ``significant decrease in flexibility and increase
in vulnerability.'' The divisions would require ``significant
compensation'' to make up their deficiencies.
<p>
   A senior Army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it was the first time in 12 years that the Army has had three
divisions rated so poorly.
<p>
   The deployment of troops to the Persian Gulf, Haiti and Rwanda
in recent months forced the Pentagon to raid accounts that were
intended to pay for major training exercises at the military's two
major training bases, the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort
Polk, La., and the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif.
<p>
   ``Commanders train or plan their training 18 months out,'' the
senior Army official said. ``So when you have to cancel a training
event, that is a lost training opportunity that you do not
recover.''

Brolin Stars In Swedish 2-0 Win; Leaves Game With Injury
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Tomas Brolin scored one goal and set up
another before his fall season ended with a fractured left ankle as
World Cup bronze medalists Sweden beat Hungary 2-0 in a Group 3
European soccer qualifier Wednesday.
<p>
   Brolin, the only Swede named to the World Cup All Star team, was
injured when he crossed the ball for striker Martin Dahlin's go
ahead goal from close range with 20 minutes left.
<p>
   The 24-year-old midfield star was carried off the field on a
stretcher. He was examined by team doctor Jan Ekstrand in the
lockerroom before he was brought to the Karolinska hospital for
surgery.
<p>
   ``He will be sidelined at least three months,'' Ekstrand said.
``The operation went just fine. It was not complicated. These
injuries are quite common in soccer.''
<p>
   Brolin, who has been one of the top players during Parma's
successful fall campaing in the Italian first division, will remain
in hospital ``for several days'', Ekstrand said.
<p>
   ``Tomas' injury was a sad end to a great game,'' said Swedish
coach Tommy Svensson, who sent on Stefan Rehn to replace Brolin.
<p>
   Sweden, playing its first European qualifier at home after the
World Cup, dominated heavily throughout the first half and
Hungarian defenders twice cleared the ball on the goalline before
Brolin connected in the 44th minute.
<p>
   Brolin, who beat goalkeeper Szolt Petry with a right-foot drive
from 15 meters, now has scored 24 goals in 41 national team
appearances, including a team-leading nine goals this season.
<p>
   The Swedes kept the pressure on in the second half against an
Hungarian team that relied on counter-attacks. Hungary has yet to
win a qualifier, having tied Turkey 2-2 in the first game.

   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian Serbs fighting the
Muslim-led government to reclaim strategic territory in
northwestern Bosnia before winter sets in got fresh help Wednesday
from rebel Muslims. The United Nations reported that 15 to 20
truckloads of rebel Muslims crossed over from Croatia to reinforce
the Bosnian Serbs. The rebels, who fled to Croatia after their
renegade Muslim commander lost control of the Bihac region in
August, have backed Bosnian Serbs before. Bosnia's Muslim
president, Alija Izetbegovic, toned down his earlier optimism and
said the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was ``extremely
difficult.'' Most fighting was on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac.
<p>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  In this nation notorious for human
rights violations, President Clinton issued a call Wednesday ``to
break down chains of oppression'' and pledged the United States
will not ignore abuses for the sake of increased trade. Clinton
discussed human rights at length with President Suharto and urged
him to make more progress, officials said. Clinton welcomed
Suharto's assurances that he would not punish students who occupied
the U.S. Embassy to demand independence for East Timor, the former
Portuguese colony seized in 1975. The Indonesian leader said his
government is dealing fairly with East Timor, a senior
administration official said.
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Angola's army, nearing military victory
over UNITA rebels, ordered a nationwide truce Wednesday to allow
the signing of a peace treaty ending 19 years of civil war.
Mistrustful UNITA rebels appealed for rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the cease-fire. Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de
Matos, in a statement broadcast on state radio, ordered his troops
to lay down their guns and respect the cease-fire ``scrupulously.''
As the cease-fire deadline passed, the government commander of the
main, southern front, said his men were holding fire as ordered.
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Progress in worldwide nuclear arms
reduction got a major boost Wednesday with the Ukrainian
parliament's long-awaited approval of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The action, on a 301-8 vote, puts the world's third-largest nuclear
power firmly on the road to total disarmament. The former Soviet
republic of 52 million people now must be nuclear-free by around
the turn of the century. Coming after months of intense lobbying by
the international community, especially the United States, it also
is a significant step in strengthening ties with the West.
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the slum priest whose championship of the poor pitted him against
dictators and his Roman Catholic superiors, is leaving the
priesthood, officials said Wednesday. The Vatican, which has long
been at odds with the populist preacher, pressured Aristide to
resign, a church source said. Two government officials speaking on
condition of anonymity confirmed Aristide's departure. There was no
immediate word from Aristide or reason given for giving up the
priesthood. He spent the day with Haitian business leaders and
Oscar Arias Sanchez, the former president of Costa Rica.

Press. Stories carried ``f'' or ``i'' category codes. Some of the
items below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Stocks rose, even as bonds and the dollar lost
ground in reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate
increase on Tuesday. The broader market underperformed the blue
chip gauge throughout the session until a big burst of buying in
the last 30 minutes of trading propelled stock indexes decisively
higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 18.84 to
3,845.20.
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  A day after the Federal Reserve raised
interest rates to cool off the economy, the government's most
closely watched inflation gauge showed a consumer-price rise of
only 0.1 percent for October. While Wednesday's Consumer Price
Index report was certain to provide ammunition to critics who are
accusing the central bank of monetary overkill, the Clinton
administration continued to be restrained in its comments.
<p>
   IRVING, Texas (AP)  &MD;  Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has struck a
deal with the government of Indonesia for the two to spend some
dlrs 40 billion to develop the Natuna natural gas field in the
South China Sea. The agreement signed in Jakarta between Exxon
affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Natuna Inc. and
Indonesia's national oil company, Pertamina, calls for the two to
be 50-50 partners in the project.
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Putting off until next year a vote on a new
world trade accord would mean ``a death sentence for the biggest
tax cut in the history of the world,'' Vice President Al Gore said
Wednesday. Gore, at a news conference on Capitol Hill, urged
Congress to act this year on the trade pact under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), saying it was a ``critical
vote for U.S. leadership in the world and a critical vote for the
health of the U.S. economy.''
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Representatives of the United States and 22
other governments have tentatively agreed to ban trade in
anti-personnel land mines, Deputy Director Ralph Earle II of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said Wednesday. Millions
of such mines are still in the ground throughout the world after
the forces that planted them have left, like the troops of the
former Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Vietnam received a resounding vote of confidence
Wednesday from foreign aid donors, winning pledges of dlrs 2
billion to help it shift to a market economy and ease
still-widespread poverty. The new grants and loans, an addition to
dlrs 1.8 billion pledged a year ago, represent an endorsement of
economic reforms that have slashed inflation, trimmed a bloated
public sector and fueled growth rates of 8.1 percent last year and
8.5 percent this year.
<p>
   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP)  &MD;  Armenia announced an ambitious
market-reform plan Wednesday aimed at reining in inflation,
slashing the deficit and freeing prices. The country, one of the
poorest of the former Soviet republics, is hoping to meet
requirements for international loans.

   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Janis Joplin, Frank Zappa and Duane Allman will
be inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with
several other acts, including Neil Young and Al Green.
<p>
   Surviving members of Led Zeppelin, Martha and the Vandellas and
the Allman Brothers Band will also be inducted Jan. 12 during the
annual ceremony.
<p>
   The new members were announced Tuesday.
<p>
   The Hall of Fame is under construction in Cleveland and is
scheduled to open late next year.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP)  &MD;  A former partner in the Whitewater
investment deal will stand trial on charges of embezzling more than
dlrs 150,000 from conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife.
<p>
   Susan McDougal is accused of forging checks and making
unauthorized credit card purchases while she was the bookkeeper and
assistant to Mehta's wife, Nancy.
<p>
   Ms. McDougal and her ex-husband, James McDougal, were partners
with President and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater real estate
venture in Arkansas. The project is at the center of a federal
investigation into whether depositors' money from McDougal's failed
savings and loan benefited the Clintons.
<p>
   Ms. McDougal's attorney, Leonard Levine, denied she did anything
illegal. She was ordered Monday to stand trial.
<p>
   ``All expenses were for the Mehtas' benefit and are with their
approval,'' Levine said.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Musician Quincy Jones, TV talk show host Geraldo
Rivera and ``Soul Train'' TV show host and producer Don Cornelius
have formed a minority-controlled broadcasting business and are
buying two TV stations.
<p>
   Investors also include the Tribune Co. of Chicago and football
Hall of Famer Willie Davis.
<p>
   The new company, Qwest Broadcasting, has agreed to buy WATL in
Atlanta from Fox Broadcasting for dlrs 150 million and WNOL in New
Orleans for dlrs 17 million. WNOL already is partially owned by
Jones.
<p>
   The deals are subject to approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.
<p>
   The new company ``is setting out on a mission to create a viable
alternative to what is currently on television,'' Jones said
Wednesday.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   PARIS (AP)  &MD;  Jacques Mouclier, a major player in France's
high-profile luxury industries, is more than just a follower of
fashion. On Wednesday, he was dubbed a commander.
<p>
   Mouclier, 70, president of the French Couture and Ready-to-Wear
Federation, was promoted from officer to commander of the Legion of
Honor by a government grateful for his luxury industry leadership.
<p>
   Chief executive of the professional fashion guild since 1973,
Mouclier was instrumental in bringing major changes in the
industry.
<p>
   His most notable recent achievement is the huge fashion complex
of four auditoriums near the newly renovated Louvre Museum, used
four times a year by major designers.
<p>
   Mouclier is president and board member of several guilds,
including the French Confederation of Professional Artisans and the
Federation of Crystal and Hand-Cut Glass Makers.
<p>
   A French trade emissary since 1964, Mouclier has held lower
ranks in the Legion of Honor  &MD;  France's highest category of awards
 &MD;  and is a commander of the National Order of Merit.
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
<p>
   OSLO, Norway (AP)  &MD;  Sit, boy! Speak! Get me out of the army!
Olaf Lingjaerde's dogs can do all those tricks.
<p>
   When the 22-year-old Lingjaerde was called up for his compulsory
military service, he tried to get a deferment to take care of his
dependents: eight sled-racing huskies, the military magazine
Defense Forum reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The draft board had no sympathy.
<p>
   ``In fact, I was advised to put my dogs to sleep,'' he told the
magazine.
<p>
   But one army base, in Norway's arctic Sor-Varanger County,
offered to take on Lingjaerde and his pals, even promising to build
a kennel and help care for the animals, the report said.
<p>
   In exchange, the new private was to give his fellow recruits
sled rides all winter.
<p>
   When Lingjaerde couldn't afford to feed the dogs on his meager
military stipend, the Sor-Varanger Garrison took over and ended up
paying dlrs 7,500 on the kennel, supplies and food, Defense Forum
reported.
<p>
   Trying to cut back, the army first told Lingjaerde to put his
dogs on a diet, with little success.
<p>
   Finally, the magazine said, the Norwegian Supreme Defense
Command decided enough was enough. It discharged the whole lot  &MD; 
man and dogs  &MD;  as of this autumn.

Republicans Determined To Avoid Divisive Fights on Social Issues
AP Graphic GINGRICH GOALS
By JOHN KING
AP Political Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  Mindful of the damage President Clinton
suffered in the debate over homosexuals in the military, Republican
leaders are determined to avoid fights over abortion and other
divisive social issues.
<p>
   Their caution reflects a desire to solidify the party's newfound
support among white women, to avoid overreaching the mandate of
their midterm gains, and to deny Democrats an early opening to
re-energize their despondent base.
<p>
   Much of this approach stems from the Republican Party analysis
of Democrat Clinton's early efforts to allow homosexuals to serve
openly in the military. The effort sent Clinton's support among
white men, and across the South, into a tailspin from which the
president has yet to recover.
<p>
   And it invigorated conservative groups, particularly the
Christian Coalition and other religious conservative groups, and
these organizations were significant players in the Republican
midterm sweep. In historic elections last week, the Republicans
took control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
<p>
   Now, if Republicans rush forward with a controversial social
agenda, ``it could excite our forces and help us organize for the
next elections,'' said Ann Lewis, a veteran Democratic strategist
and a senior official at Planned Parenthood, a liberal group that
vigorously promotes abortion rights.
<p>
   So far, Rep. Newt Gingrich, who will become House speaker in
January, has kept his focus mostly on economic and reform issues.
<p>
   Gingrich has offered vague criticisms of liberal housing and
education programs but with the exception of school prayer and
welfare reform, two popular ideas, has spoken sparingly about
social issues.
<p>
   ``We cannot replace the social engineering by the left with a
social engineering of the right,'' Gingrich said Tuesday night.
<p>
   The House Republican agenda does include social policies certain
to prove controversial. But in picking these battles, Gingrich and
his allies were careful to put reform items first and then choose
social issues that enjoy substantial if not overwhelming support in
public opinion polls  &MD;  though vehemently opposed by liberals.
<p>
   Gingrich, for example, wants the House to vote by early July on
a constitutional amendment allowing organized school prayer.
Liberal groups oppose the amendment but President Clinton said
Tuesday he is open to the idea, suggesting there will be no unified
Democratic opposition.
<p>
   As for abortion, Republicans expect some conservatives to push
for restoration of the ``gag rule'' prohibiting clinics that
receive federal funding from advising pregnant women about
abortion.
<p>
   But Gingrich's leadership team, according to aides, has made it
clear in meetings that it does not favor such moves, at least in
the short term.
<p>
   ``It's a sensitive subject in our caucus,'' said one leadership
aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We won't know for sure
until everyone is back in Washington but we think people understand
the need to proceed carefully here.''
<p>
   Still, Democrats believe Gingrich ultimately will find big
social-policy fights irresistible, or be unable to prevent more
socially conservative members from provoking them. And conservative
groups that backed Republican candidates may demand actions if the
result could hurt the Republican Party with moderate
constituencies.

Croatia Stuns Italy
Eds: RECAPS sty from previous cycle to CORRECT Israel's points
total; UPDATES with Brolin out three months, sted three weeks
By JOSEPH WHITE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  Seville striker Davor Suker scored two goals as
Croatia stunned World Cup finalist Italy 2-1 Wednesday in
qualifying for the European Championship.
<p>
   It was the second embarrassing result in the tournament for
Italy against a team from the former Yugoslavia. The Italians were
held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia in September, and are now in
jeopardy of missing the 1996 finals in England.
<p>
   Suker scored with a left-footed drive in the 32nd minute, and
nailed a perfect header in the 58th past an Italian defense that
has been unusually erratic and hesitant following the retirement of
longtime captain-sweeper Franco Baresi. Suker, Croatia's most
dangerous forward, was left unmarked in the penalty area for both
goals.
<p>
   The defeat spoiled the return of star-forward Roberto Baggio,
back from a lengthy injury layoff. His presence, however, failed to
inspire his Italian teammates.
<p>
   ``It was a bad night for us,'' Baggio said, ``and a lucky one
for Croatia.''
<p>
   The Italian players, who lost the World Cup final to Brazil in
Pasadena in July, left the field among the whistles and jeers of
the fans at the Favorita stadium in Palermo, Sicily. Their only
goal came from Dino Baggio in second-half injury time.
<p>
   ``(Croatia) played definitely better and deserved victory,''
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi said. ``Croatia was stronger physically
and technically tonight. I'm especially sorry for the fans, who
deserved a better game from our side.''
<p>
   Italy, with one win, one loss and one draw, dropped to third
place in Group 4 with four points. Croatia, making its debut in the
Europeans, has a perfect nine points after three games. Lithuania
moved up to second place in the group with six points after a 2-1
victory over Slovenia.
<p>
   Elsewhere, defending champion Denmark was shut out 3-0 in Spain,
Germany opened its campaign with a 2-1 victory over Albania, and
Wales suffered the most humiliating defeat in its history against
another first-time entrant, losing 5-0 to Georgia in Group 7.
<p>
   The Welsh loss, coupled with a 3-2 defeat last month in another
former Soviet republic, Moldova, all but closed the door on the
star-studded Welsh team's hopes for qualifying for the finals.
<p>
   ``The players and myself are ashamed,'' Wales manager Mike Smith
said. ``We should have done a lot better than that. How can I sum
up a game like that? They were far better than us.''
<p>
   Georgia, playing in the Europeans for the first time since
gaining independence, scored its first goals and earned its first
points in the competition.
<p>
   World Cup semifinalist Bulgaria moved into first place in the
group, beating Moldova 4-1 on two goals from Barcelona forward
Hristo Stoichkov.
<p>
   Other highlights among the 18 qualifying games Wednesday
included Cyprus' first Euro victory in 26 years, and a third
consecutive scoreless draw for France.
 &UR; Group 1 &QC; 
 &UR; Azerbaijan 0, Israel 2 &QC; 
<p>
   In rain at Trabzon, Turkey, Israel kept second place in the
group after goals from Ronen Harazi, in the 30th minute, and Ronnie
Rosenthal, in the 51st. Israel has seven points from three games,
behind idle Romania on goal differential. Azerbaijan has yet to
score in the tournament.
<p>
   European governing body UEFA ordered the match played at a
neutral site because of civil unrest in the former Soviet republic.
 &UR; Poland 0, France 0 &QC; 
<p>
   In pouring rain at Zabrze, Poland, a frustrated French had to
play with 10 men after Nantes midfielder Christian Karembeu was
sent off in the 49th minute for a tackle on Poland striker Roman
Kosecki.
 &UR; Group 2 &QC; 
 &UR; Spain 3, Denmark 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Seville, Spain kept its perfect record with goals from Miguel
Angel Nadal in the 41st, Brazil-born Spaniard Donato Gama da Silva
in the 56th and Luis Enrique Martinez in the 87th. Spain leads the
group with a perfect nine points from three matches, while Denmark,
which won the title last time by qualifying only after Yugoslavia
was expelled, dropped to fourth place.
 &UR; Cyprus 2, Armenia 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Limassol, the semi-professionals of Cyprus took only the
second Euro qualifying victory in their history. The Mediterranean
island nation beat Switzerland 2-0 in 1968.
<p>
   Andreas Soteriou, in the seventh minute, and substitute Costas
Fasouliotis, in the 87th, scored the goals the Cypriots
surprisingly moved into second place in the group.
 &UR; Belgium 1, Macedonia 1 &QC; 
<p>
   At Brussels, Macedonia continued its stunning run in its Euro
debut, with Zoran Boskovski's goal in the 50th minute giving the
former Yugoslav republic the draw. Gert Verheyen scored in the 30th
for Belgium.
<p>
   Macedonia drew with Denmark in its opening match in September.
 &UR; Group 3 &QC; 
 &UR; Switzerland 1, Iceland 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Lausanne, Switzerland had a tougher-than-expected time
against a stubborn Iceland defense, with Thomas Bickel's free kick
accounting for the lone goal in the final minute of the first half.
<p>
   Switzerland, with a maximum six points from two games, is tied
with Sweden atop the group, although the Swedes have played one
extra game.
 &UR; Sweden 2, Hungary 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Stockholm, World Cup star Tomas Brolin scored a goal in the
44th minute, then left the game with a broken ankle suffered when
setting up Martin Dahlin for the second score in the 70th. He'll be
out at least three months.
 &UR; Group 4 &QC; 
 &UR; Slovenia 1, Lithuania 2 &QC; 
<p>
   At Maribor, Slovenia, Audrius Zuta scored the winning goal with
three minutes to play, shortly after Lithuania was reduced to 10
men when Vytautas Apanavicius was sent off for a second yellow
card.
<p>
   Zlatko Zahovic gave Slovenia the lead in the 55th minute, and
Viaceslavas Sukristovas tied it for Lithuania it in the 64th.
 &UR; Group 5 &QC; 
 &UR; Belarus 0, Norway 4 &QC; 
<p>
   At Minsk, Norway improved to first place in the group with seven
points in three games. Blackburn defender Henning Berg started the
rout in the 35th, followed by Oyvind Leonhardsen four minutes
later, Lars Bohinen in the 52nd and Kjetil Rekdal in the 83rd.
 &UR; Netherlands 0, Czech Republic 0 &QC; 
<p>
   The draw at Rotterdam left both teams with five points in three
games, allowing Norway to leapfrog into first.
 &UR; Group 6 &QC; 
 &UR; Northern Ireland 0, Ireland 4 &QC; 
<p>
   In contrast to last year's emotional World Cup qualifier, this
game between rival neighbors was played in an atmosphere of peace
after recent the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups
declared cease-fires.
<p>
   John Aldridge (sixth minute), Roy Keane (11th), John Sheridan
(38th) and Andy Townsend (53rd) gave Ireland its first-ever victory
in Belfast and Northern Ireland's worst defeat at home in 15 years.
Ireland leads the group with nine points in three games.
 &UR; Group 7 &QC; 
 &UR; Georgia 5, Wales 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Tbilisi, Temoliz Ketsbaia scored in 30th and 49th minutes,
Georgi Kinkladze in the 39th, Gocha Gogrichiani in the 59th and
Shota Arveladze in the 66th.
 &UR; Albania 1, Germany 2 &QC; 
<p>
   Tottenham striker Juergen Klinsmann struck in the 18th minute,
Hysen Zmijani equalized for Albania in the 33rd and Ulf Kirsten
scored the winner in the 46th.
 &UR; Bulgaria 4, Moldova 1 &QC; 
<p>
   In a battle for first place at Sofia, Stoichkov scored in the
45th and 85th minutes, Krasimir Balakov in the 64th, and substitute
Emil Kostadinov in the 87th for Bulgaria. Sergiu Cleschenco scored
for Moldova in the 59th.
<p>
   Bulgaria moved into the top spot with a perfect tally of six
points from two games. Moldova, with two victories and a loss, fell
to second place on goal differential.
 &UR; Group 8 &QC; 
 &UR; Greece 2, San Marino 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Athens, Nikos Mahlas scored in the 31st and Costas
Frantzeskos in the 84th as Greece kept its perfect record after
three games.
 &UR; Scotland 1, Russia 1 &QL; 
<p>
   At Glasgow, Dimitri Radchenko's equalizer in the 25th canceled
out Scott Booth's goal in the 19th as both teams remained unbeaten.
Scotland stayed second with seven points in three games, and Russia
remained third with four points from two games.
 &UR; Finland 5, Faeroe Islands 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Helsinki, Finland won its first game and scored its first
goals in the tournament against the perennial strugglers from the
North Atlantic. Ajax Amsterdam striker Jari Litmanen (52nd and 72nd
minutes) and Mika-Matti Paatelainen (74th and 85th) scored two
goals each after Antti Sumiala's opening score in the 36th.
 &UR; Exhibition &QC; 
 &UR; England 1, Nigeria 0 &QC; 
<p>
   At Wembley, England, which qualifies automatically for the Euro
finals as host nation, beat the World Cup heroes from Africa on a
24th minute goal from David Platt, his 24th for England in his 50th
appearance.

Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  Bosnian Serbs fighting the
Muslim-led government to reclaim strategic territory in
northwestern Bosnia before winter sets in got fresh help Wednesday
from rebel Muslims. The United Nations reported that 15 to 20
truckloads of rebel Muslims crossed over from Croatia to reinforce
the Bosnian Serbs. The rebels, who fled to Croatia after their
renegade Muslim commander lost control of the Bihac region in
August, have backed Bosnian Serbs before. Bosnia's Muslim
president, Alija Izetbegovic, toned down his earlier optimism and
said the situation on the Bihac pocket front line was ``extremely
difficult.'' Most fighting was on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  In this nation notorious for human
rights violations, President Clinton issued a call Wednesday ``to
break down chains of oppression'' and pledged the United States
will not ignore abuses for the sake of increased trade. Clinton
discussed human rights at length with President Suharto and urged
him to make more progress, officials said. Clinton welcomed
Suharto's assurances that he would not punish students who occupied
the U.S. Embassy to demand independence for East Timor, the former
Portuguese colony seized in 1975. The Indonesian leader said his
government is dealing fairly with East Timor, a senior
administration official said.
<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Angola's army, nearing military victory
over UNITA rebels, ordered a nationwide truce Wednesday to allow
the signing of a peace treaty ending 19 years of civil war.
Mistrustful UNITA rebels appealed for rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the cease-fire. Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de
Matos, in a statement broadcast on state radio, ordered his troops
to lay down their guns and respect the cease-fire ``scrupulously.''
As the cease-fire deadline passed, the government commander of the
main, southern front, said his men were holding fire as ordered.
<p>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  &MD;  Progress in worldwide nuclear arms
reduction got a major boost Wednesday with the Ukrainian
parliament's long-awaited approval of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The action, on a 301-8 vote, puts the world's third-largest nuclear
power firmly on the road to total disarmament. The former Soviet
republic of 52 million people now must be nuclear-free by around
the turn of the century. Coming after months of intense lobbying by
the international community, especially the United States, it also
is a significant step in strengthening ties with the West.
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the slum priest whose championship of the poor pitted him against
dictators and his Roman Catholic superiors, is leaving the
priesthood, officials said Wednesday. The Vatican, which has long
been at odds with the populist preacher, pressured Aristide to
resign, a church source said. Two government officials speaking on
condition of anonymity confirmed Aristide's departure. There was no
immediate word from Aristide or reason given for giving up the
priesthood. He spent the day with Haitian business leaders and
Oscar Arias Sanchez, the former president of Costa Rica.

Irish Coalition Partner Pulling Out of Government

<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  The Irish government, proud of its
contribution to peace in Northern Ireland, fell apart with
recriminations and belated regrets over a controversial judicial
appointment.
<p>
   ``Neither I nor any of my colleagues can vote confidence in this
government,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring, head of the
Labor Party, announcing his immediate resignation Wednesday night
along with the five other ministers from the junior coalition
party.
<p>
   But Spring, who was also foreign minister, said he was confident
the Northern Ireland peace process could withstand the Irish
political crisis.
<p>
   ``I believe there is no leader in this house who would not be
willing to carry on the work started by the Taoiseach (Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds) in the spirit in which he started that
work, if the necessity arose,'' Spring said.
<p>
   The Sinn Fein party, political supporters of the Irish
Republican Army, said it regretted the coalition breakup.
<p>
   But party vice-president Pat Doherty said: ``Sinn Fein
reiterates our commitment to pursuing with renewed determination
the securing of a just and lasting peace in Ireland. We will
continue to work with all parties towards this goal.''
<p>
   Reynolds was expected to seek a national election following a
confidence vote scheduled for Thursday. Shorn of Labor's support,
that would leave him without a majority.
<p>
   But President Mary Robinson could give other parties the chance
to form a new government, rather than call an election.
<p>
   Mrs. Robinson, visiting Belfast on Wednesday, said the peace
process had wide support in the south.
<p>
   ``There is not only support for but appreciation of the
importance of the peace process that is shared across the political
spectrum,'' she said.
<p>
   Earlier Wednesday, Reynolds had told Parliament he regretted a
controversial judicial appointment that led to Labor's walkout from
the Cabinet on Friday.
<p>
   Reynolds said he had recieved new information that Harry
Whelehan, a former attorney general who was appointed president of
the High Court, had misled the Cabinet about an extradition case.
Had he known last week, Reynolds said, he would not have pressed
ahead with Whelehan's appointment.
<p>
   Spring said he decided to vote against Reynolds on the
confidence motion after he learned Wednesday morning that Reynolds
had been informed of the discrepancies on Monday but had not
mentioned them in his speech to Parliament on Tuesday.
<p>
   Reynolds indicated that he had been informed of the matter by
the new attorney general but had not had time to comprehend the
implications before addressing the Parliament.
<p>
   Labor lawmakers were not satisfied last week with Reynolds'
explanation of why the attorney general's office had taken no
action for seven months the case of the Rev. Brendan Smyth, a
Catholic priest wanted for child sexual abuse in Northern Ireland.

Angolan Government Orders Cease-fire, Rebels Doubtful

<p>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP)  &MD;  Angola's army was expected to strengthen
Thursday a nationwide truce reached in its victorious war with
UNITA rebels to allow the signing of a peace treaty ending 19 years
of civil war.
<p>
   Mistrustful UNITA rebels appealed for rapid deployment of U.N.
observers to monitor the cease-fire.
<p>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Joao de Matos, in a Wednesday statement
broadcast on state radio, ordered his troops to lay down their guns
and respect the cease-fire ``scrupulously.''
<p>
   As the cease-fire deadline passed, the government commander of
the main, southern front, said his men were holding fire as
ordered.
<p>
   ``We are maintaining our positions and not advancing,'' said
Brig. Macedo Amarel. He said there was no sign of rebel troop
movements but warned ``we are on our guard.''
<p>
   The truce was the first step in disengaging the warring armies.
Rebel and government delegations were meeting in Lusaka to finalize
details before Sunday's signing.
<p>
   The cease-fire agreement was reached Tuesday night. President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi are to sign
the treaty Sunday in Lusaka, Zambia.
<p>
   Meanwhile, military officials said the northern city of Uige,
the last provincial capital under UNITA control, had fallen to
government forces Wednesday. There was no independent confirmation.
<p>
   Fighting had raged around Uige in the hours before the truce.
<p>
   Observers have been guarded about whether the truce will hold.
Previous efforts have failed to stop the war, which erupted on the
eve of independence from Portugal in 1975.
<p>
   UNITA, the Portugese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, said the government cease-fire order
was meaningless unless the United Nations guarantees the guns
remain silent.
<p>
   A rebel statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, urged rapid
deployment of U.N. military observers to Uige and the central
highlands around Huambo, the rebel base seized in a massive
government assault last week.
<p>
   UNITA accused the government of trying ``to deceive the world
and attain a military victory while speaking of peace and
democracy.''
<p>
   The United Nations has promised to deploy monitors and police
once a treaty is signed, but will only dispatch peacekeepers if the
cease-fire holds. A permanent cease-fire is supposed to take effect
two days after the signing.
<p>
   The thorniest issue is likely to be how to guarantee Savimbi's
safety. The rebels fear their leader, who has spent much of the war
in hiding in the bush, could be assassinated if he returns to
Luanda.
<p>
   Savimbi's whereabouts remained unknown Wednesday. Rumors that
the rebel chief was wounded or even killed during the latest
government offensive were dispelled last month when U.N. mediator
Alioune Blondin Beye said he had met with the rebel leader in
Huambo.
<p>
   There has been speculation that Savimbi was granted refuge by
his longtime ally, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. Diplomatic
sources said Savimbi could be in Zaire or in the rebels' southern
Angolan base of Jamba, near the Namibian border.
<p>
   Since Angola's war began in 1975, more than half a million
people have died. Millions more are threatened by starvation and
disease.
<p>
   The 1991 accord brought a brief peace, but UNITA lost 1992
elections and returned to war, seizing two-thirds of the country.
<p>
   Rearmed government troops, backed by former South African
soldiers who once fought alongside UNITA, launched a counterattack
last fall.

   The Following Is A Package Of Caribbean News Briefs By The
Associated Press
<p>
   UNITED NATIONS:World Law of The Sea, Long Opposed By U.S.,
Quietly Goes Into Effect:
<p>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP)  &MD;  A law that governs international use of
the world's oceans went into effect Wednesday as representatives of
more than 60 countries convened a three-day maritime conference.
<p>
   ``The dream of a comprehensive law for the oceans is an old one.
Turning this dream into a reality has been one of the greatest
achievements of this century ... It will be one of our most
enduring legacies,'' U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
told 500 delegates at the convention's opening ceremony.
<p>
   The International Law of the Sea, in negotiations since 1973,
regulates the use of the world's ocean resources in everything from
deep-sea fishing to seabed mining.
<p>
   The delegates, including ministers from the 13-member Caribbean
Community, were in Kingston to inaugurate the International Seabed
Authority, one of the agencies created by the new law.
<p>
   The authority will monitor and manage the use of resources of
the seabed beyond the areas that fall on national jurisdictions. It
is receiving dlrs 2.5 million in U.N. funds to finance its first
year of operations.
<p>
   Jamaica was chosen over Fiji and Malta in 1981 to host the
authority headquarters during a U.N. Conference on the Law of the
Sea in Geneva.
<p>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said the entry into force of the
Law of the Sea marks a unique event in Jamaica's history.
<p>
   HAITI: Church, Government Sources: Aristide To Resign His
Priesthood:
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the slum priest whose championship of the poor pitted him against
dictators and his Roman Catholic superiors, is leaving the
priesthood, officials said Wednesday.
<p>
   The Vatican, which has long been at odds with the populist
preacher, pressured Aristide to resign, a church source said. Two
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed
Aristide's departure.
<p>
   There was no immediate word from Aristide or reason given for
giving up the priesthood. He spent the day with Haitian business
leaders and Oscar Arias Sanchez, the former president of Costa
Rica.
<p>
   The Vatican had no immediate comment, but some church sources
said it would be unusual for the Vatican to force a priest to quit.
A senior Vatican official said it was unlikely the Vatican would
demand Aristide leave the church at such a sensitive time in Haiti.
<p>
   Aristide's withdrawal from the priesthood, however, is not
likely to hurt his support among Haiti's poor, many of whom
associated the church with the old military regime.
<p>
   Aristide spokesman Yvon Neptune acknowledged there had recently
been friction with the church.
<p>
   ST. KITTS: Deputy Prime Minister Quits:
<p>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP)  &MD;  The deputy prime minister of this
Caribbean nation quit, just hours after Scotland Yard determined
one of his sons had been killed and two others are suspects in his
death.
<p>
   The tragic trajectory of Sidney Morris and his family followed a
stolen shipment of Colombian cocaine to this former British colony.
Scotland Yard was called in after the slaying of a top St. Kitts
policeman who was investigating the disappearance Oct. 1 of Vincent
Morris and his girlfriend.
<p>
   ``Mr. (Sidney) Morris and his family have suffered through great
emotional pain and disappointment,'' Prime Minister Kennedy
Simmonds said in a nationwide broadcast late Tuesday in which he
accepted Morris' resignation. ``Our prayers go out to them.''
<p>
   The events have underscored the fragility of small Caribbean
states before powerful drug traffickers, who see the area as a
conduit for Colombian cocaine to the United States and Europe. St.
Kitts and Nevis, with a population of about 40,000, is the smallest
nation in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
   Morris, 59, resigned his various government posts: deputy prime
minister and minister of education, youth and social affairs and
communications, works and public utilities. But he will keep his
parliament seat.
<p>
   BERMUDA: Bermudan Parties Reject Call for Income Tax:
<p>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP)  &MD;  A former Cabinet Minister and longtime
businessman says this British colony in the Atlantic needs an
income tax. But both of the island's political parties are
rejecting the idea.
<p>
   Sir John Plowman, who was the governing United Bermuda Party's
leader in the Senate from 1968 to 1982, said imposing an income tax
would help the struggling tourism industry and assure a stable
society.
<p>
   If the island introduces a 20 percent flat rate income tax
similar to that in the Channel Island of Jersey, it can cut Customs
duties by 60 percent and eliminate the $15 tax paid by departing
visitors, he said.
<p>
   Plowman, 86, said he fears Bermuda is rapidly creating ``a
substantial group of second-class citizens who see no prospect of
having any share of the otherwise general prosperity.''
<p>
   ``Unless something is done, and done soon, we will all pay a
heavy price,'' he said.
<p>
   Nearly half of the $350 million government money was collected
last year came from Customs duties. Merchants have said the duties
translate into high prices for residents and tourists.
<p>
   But David Saul, finance minister in the UBP Government, said a
Canadian consultant just completed a review of Bermuda's tax system
that did not include an income tax.

Fighting Surges in Bihac Pocket, Rebel Muslims Join In

<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  &MD;  The government's Muslim-led
troops fought not only Bosnian Serbs but other Muslims as the army
tried to hold onto newly captured territory in the northwest.
<p>
   The Serb rebels, who are intent on retaking the territory before
the severe Balkan winter makes offensives difficult, were
reinforced by 15 to 20 truckloads of rebel Muslims who crossed over
from Croatia, the United Nations reported Wednesday.
<p>
   The fighting in the strategically important area around Bihac is
some of the most ethnically complex in Bosnia's 2 1/2-year-long
war. It pits the Muslim-led government's troops, who are loosely
allied with Bosnian Croats, against Bosnian Serbs, Croatian Serbs
and rebel Muslims who had fled to Croatia after their commander
lost control of the Bihac region in August.
<p>
   Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, toned down his
earlier optimism and said the situation on the ``Bihac pocket''
front line was ``extremely difficult.''
<p>
   But government statements about involvement of Croatian Serbs
and Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in the fighting appeared calculated
to pressure the international community to act against the Serb
assaults.
<p>
   The United Nations has accused Croatian Serb rebels, who occupy
a third of Croatia, of providing artillery cover to Bosnian Serbs
in Bihac, but there was no independent confirmation of Yugoslav
army involvement.
<p>
   Yugoslav intervention would likely draw a harsh international
response, particularly after the United Nations eased sanctions on
Yugoslavia for cutting off supplies of fuel and other war material
to the Bosnian Serbs.
<p>
   Yugoslavia has been blamed for the upheavals in Bosnia and
Croatia by supporting rebel Serbs in those countries after they
seceded from Yugoslavia, now comprised only of Serbia and
Montenegro.
<p>
   Most fighting was on the Grabez plateau east of Bihac. Bosnian
Serbs there appeared to be testing government positions outside
Bihac and other government-held towns sandwiched between the front
line and parts of Croatia held by Croatian Serbs.
<p>
   Jadranko Prlic, defense minister of a new federation of Bosnian
Croats and Muslims, said the Muslim-led Bosnian government army and
Bosnian Croat militias could hold the lines around Bihac.
<p>
   But he demanded the United Nations allow allied Croatia to
retaliate against any attacks from Serb-held territory on the Bihac
defenders.
<p>
   Croatia has condemned artillery attacks by Croatian Serbs
against Bosnian government troops, and suggested it would retaliate
if the international community does not.
<p>
   Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, called the president of the
U.N. Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, on
Wednesday to appeal for U.N. intercession against what he described
as a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serbs on the Bihac pocket.
<p>
   Izetbegovic claimed Croatian Serbs launched a helicopter attack
on Bihac city to back up a 30-tank assault on the town.
<p>
   The United Nations said there was no evidence of any such
attack.
<p>
   The Bosnian prime minister, Haris Siljadzic, alleged that three
Yugoslav army missile brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade
were helping Bosnian Serbs attack Velika Kladusa, the former
stronghold of Muslim rebels on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of intervention by the
Yugoslav army, whose support permitted the Bosnian Serbs to overrun
70 percent of Bosnia.
<p>
   Izetbegovic criticized the United Nations, which has declared
the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones,'' and NATO, which has the
power to punish combatants for violating the zones, for failing to
protect Bihac.
<p>
   Bosnian Serbs began their push in the Bihac region after
Muslim-led government forces captured hundreds of square kilometers
(miles) of territory in the northwest late last month.

Owners Working on New Plan But Striking Players Skeptical
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HERNDON, Va. (AP)  &MD;  Owners of U.S. Major League Baseball teams
worked on their new ``tax'' plan Wednesday, a proposal that already
has created doubts among the striking players.
<p>
   Talks between the two sides are to resume Thursday under
mediator W.J. Usery at a hotel in suburban Washington.
<p>
   The owners will put forth their first new proposal in five
months. It asks for a so-called tax on team payrolls above a
certain level and a tax on the teams with the highest revenues. The
money would be used to subsidize small-market teams.
<p>
   Player representative Orel Hershiser of the Los Angeles Dodgers
gave a hint of the players' concerns.
<p>
   ``If a club's payroll level is at ``X'' and ``X plus 1''
triggers a tax, a player that is trying to sign with that team will
hear about it, whereas the players that were signed when the team
was below ``X'' didn't have to hear about it. That could make
things biased.''
<p>
   At the center of the longest work stoppage in league history is
the concern among players that owners want to limit their salaries
through a cap. Players went out on strike August 12 and owners
responded by canceling season. It was the first time in 89 years
that the championship World Series was not played.
<p>
   Eight owners and management officials met for several hours with
their lawyers and accountants in a windowless conference room
trying to figure out the specific tax rates and thresholds.
<p>
   It is believed that a payroll level would be set, dlrs 25
million for instance, and any contracts that were signed after that
would be subject to a tax.
<p>
   A revenue tax, sometimes referred to as a luxury tax, would be
assessed on teams bringing in an above-average amount of money.
They would pay a percentage into a central fund.
<p>
   ``We have to select from various alternatives, find out which
one would be the most acceptable to the most teams,'' said Boston
Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington, the lead
negotiator for management.
<p>
   ``We'll have something to present to the players on Thursay, and
we'll present it in the best way possible.''
<p>
   Players made a tax proposal in September whereby 1.6 percent of
revenue from the richest 16 teams and 1.6 percent of the 16 highest
payrolls would be redistributed.
<p>
   ``Our proposal started at dollar one,'' Hershiser said. ``I
thought that was fairer.''

against Bosnian government troops, and suggested it would retaliate
if the international community does not.
<p>
   Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, called the president of the
U.N. Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, on
Wednesday to appeal for U.N. intercession against what he described
as a ``massive attack'' by Croatian Serbs on the Bihac pocket.
<p>
   Izetbegovic claimed Croatian Serbs launched a helicopter attack
on Bihac city to back up a 30-tank assault on the town.
<p>
   The United Nations said there was no evidence of any such
attack.
<p>
   The Bosnian prime minister, Haris Siljadzic, alleged that three
Yugoslav army missile brigades and one Yugoslav parachute brigade
were helping Bosnian Serbs attack Velika Kladusa, the former
stronghold of Muslim rebels on the Bosnia-Croatia border.
<p>
   There was no independent confirmation of intervention by the
Yugoslav army, whose support permitted the Bosnian Serbs to overrun
70 percent of Bosnia.
<p>
   Izetbegovic criticized the United Nations, which has declared
the Bihac pocket one of six ``safe zones,'' and NATO, which has the
power to punish combatants for violating the zones, for failing to
protect Bihac.
<p>
   Bosnian Serbs began their push in the Bihac region after
Muslim-led government forces captured hundreds of square kilometers
(miles) of territory in the northwest late last month.

Libyan-backed Lockerbie Film Gets Special Parliament Screening
By RON KAMPEAS
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON (AP)  &MD;  The British Parliament hosted an extraordinary
screening of a film challenging the official version of events of
the Lockerbie disaster on Wednesday, but the survivors of one of
the victims dismissed the movie as a Libyan ``propaganda ploy.''
<p>
   The film, ``The Maltese Double Cross,'' revives allegations that
arose soon after a Pan Am jumbo exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland
in December 1988 killed 270 people, that a Syrian-backed
Palestinian terror group was behind the blast, and not Libya.
<p>
   The film was partly funded by Libyan money.
<p>
   The producer of the film. Allan Francovich, said the film had
been banned from the London Film Festival, where it was due to
screen on Nov. 20, because of American and British pressure.
<p>
   ``There was an organized campaign to stop our film,'' Francovich
said.
<p>
   Instead the film was screened for the press, diplomats and
bereaved families in a parliamentary chamber, under the sponsorship
of Labor legislator Tam Dalyell, who represents the area in
Scotland that includes Lockerbie.
<p>
   The film asserts that the United States sought to cover up an
alleged Syrian connection to Lockerbie. The reason, the film
suggests, was partly because U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officials
may have known about plans for the attack beforehand but did
nothing to thwart them because of the agency officials' own ties
with Palestinian terror groups.
<p>
   American and British law enforcement officials have charged two
Libyan nationals, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fimah, with being behind the blast, which they claim was in
retaliation for a 1986 American air raid on Libya. Libyan refusal
to hand over the men has resulted in a series of United Nations
sanctions.
<p>
   A retired DEA agent, Michael Hurley, is already suing Penguin
Books for publishing a book, ``Trail of the Octopus,'' which makes
the same claim as the movie. The London Film Festival said it
wanted to wait until the suit was settled before screening the
film.
<p>
   Dalyell noted that speech in parliament is generally immune from
libel laws. ``If you can't have free speech in the House of
Commons, where can you have it?'' he said.
<p>
   Susan and Daniel Cohen, whose daughter Theodora died in the
blast, dismissed the film as Libyan whitewash.
<p>
   ``It is funded by the Libyans, it's job is to clear the
Libyans,'' Susan Cohen told The Associated Press in a phone
interview from her Cape May Court House, N.J. home.
<p>
   Reports last year said that Hemar, a Caribbean shell company set
up by the Libyans and British magnate Tiny Rowland, was backing the
film for 633,000 pounds (dlrs one million).
<p>
   Francovich denied there was Libyan money behind the film, but
his own publicity kit acknowledged the link, saying instead that
Francovich was ``mindful'' of the Libyans but insisted on
``complete editorial control.''
<p>
   The 165-minute presents sympathetic interviews with al-Megrahi
and Fimah, and digresses for about 20 minutes into Libyan history
and lore. It ignores copious evidence presented in the successful
suit brought by the bereaved families against Pan Am.
<p>
   Pan Am sought to shift responsibility to the U.S. government by
arguing that a Malta-Germany-U.S. drug run operated by DEA agents
to sting American drug dealers was exploited by the Palestinian
terrorists who carried out the attack.
<p>
   According to Pan Am's case, the DEA agents did not want to risk
exposing the sting and their own ties with the terrorists, so they
let the blast go ahead. Several appeals courts have rejected the
claim, and the case is now in the stage of settlement.
<p>
   The Cohens say that two of Francovich's main sources  &MD;  a former
low-level DEA informer named Lester Coleman and a private
investigator named Yuval Aviv  &MD;  were acknowledged by Pan Am lawyers
in court papers to be in their pay. That is not mentioned in the
film.
<p>
   ``This is simply a bunch of people making money from our
tragedy,'' Susan Cohen said
<p>
   Other families of survivors acknowledged the Libyan link, but
said the film raised important questions.
<p>
   Pam Dix, whose brother Peter Dix died on Pan Am Flight 103,
said, ``Even if Libyan money has been used to make the film, it
does not presuppose that the film is not telling the truth.''
<p>
   Daniel Cohen said he agreed that Syria still had questions to
answer, but the film only hurt the families' cause. ``We find
ourselves trying to raise questions, instead this film gets us
lumped in with the lunatics,'' he said.

Hockey General Managers Accuse Union of Bad Faith Bargaining
By JIMMY GOLEN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TORONTO (AP)  &MD;  A day after meeting with commissioner Gary
Bettman for an update on the North American National Hockey League
lockout, the general managers said at a news conference they are
becoming increasingly frustrated with what they consider bad-faith
negotiating by union head Bob Goodenow.
<p>
   ``He thinks we're all going to fall down,'' Edmonton general
manager Glen Sather said Wednesday. ``We can't. We're already
down.''
<p>
   Edmonton is one of the small-market clubs that would benefit
most from the controlled salary system owners are demanding, so
Sather's position was not surprising. He was joined by two
hard-liners, Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins and Lou Lamoriello
of the New Jersey Devils.
<p>
   The stalled talks and heated rhetoric have even made a pessimist
of moderates like Neil Smith, whose defending Stanley Cup champion
New York Rangers probably have the most to lose in a lost season.
<p>
   ``Yesterday's meeting killed all my optimism,'' he said. ``I
more intently listened to the real issues, and realized that we are
dead in the water.''
<p>
   The general managers said they are frustrated with Goodenow's
refusal to engage in give-and-take during bargaining. Lamoriello
said owners have made proposals that were open to negotiation,
``and the only reaction to it was, `No.'''
<p>
   Sinden said the league has offered to guarantee the players
their current 60 percent of revenues. When that was rejected, they
asked Goodenow to pick a number  &MD;  70 percent, even 100 percent of
revenues  &MD;  that would be fair to the players, just to get the
discussion going.
<p>
   ``His answer was, `Well, that would still be a cap,''' Sinden
said. ``Now you tell me how you can negotiate with that?
<p>
   ``He told us (during the 1992 players' strike), `When you're
down on your knees, then I might talk to you about some salaries
tied to a revenue plan,'' Sinden said. ``And we're not there yet.
Only half of us are on our knees.''
<p>
   Bettman and Goodenow are planning to meet Thursday at an
undisclosed location  &MD;  the first meeting in a week. Sources told
The Associated Press that it will be in Toronto.
<p>
   At the meeting, owners are expected to present a counter-offer
to the player proposal on two-way contracts and arbitration for
rookies. That offer, Sinden said, included concessions in areas
that had never been considered problems.
<p>
   The source told the AP that the league proposal Thursday will
focus on rookie pay and salary arbitration, but will not address a
payroll tax. The payroll tax has not been brought up in the last
two meetings, Lamoriello said.
<p>
   The lockout has lasted 47 days, resulting in 14 games canceled
from each team's schedule. The league expects another round of
double-digit cancellations this week.

Chinese Swimmer Flunks Drug Test
Eds: RECAPS from previous cycle
By LARRY SIDDONS
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Another Chinese swimmer has flunked a drug test,
this time a world champion who had almost three times the legal
level of steroids in her system.
<p>
   A doctor who helped administer the tests said he was not
surprised by the results, which cast further doubt on Chinese
assertions that their growing bunch of record-setters were trained
drug-free.
<p>
   ``Our job is to be suspicious of anyone who is a real good
swimmer,'' said Dr. Alan Richardson, a member of the medical
commission of the swimming federation FINA.
<p>
   Yang Aihua was the fifth member of China's powerful women's
teams to test positive for drugs since last year, and by far the
biggest name. She won the women's 400-meter freestyle at the World
Swimming Championships in September, with a time of 4 minutes, 9.64
seconds.
<p>
   Although she passed a drug test there, Yang was caught a short
while later in a random sampling conducted by FINA before the Asian
Games in Hiroshima, Japan. FINA started those tests after the
United States and 17 other nations called for a drug crackdown in
the wake of China's domination of the world championships.
<p>
   ``We did out-of-competition testing and Yang Aihua tested
positive for steroids,'' Richardson said. ``We have recommended
that FINA impose the appropriate sanctions.''
<p>
   Yang would be banned for two years, knocking her out of the
Atlanta Olympics. She also would have to return the silver medal
from the Asian Games 400, although she probably will be allowed to
keep the 400 gold from the world championships since FINA does not
impose penalties retroactively.
<p>
   The silver medal in the 400 in Rome went to Cristina Teuscher of
the United States, who finished .57 seconds behind in 4:10.21. The
world record of 4:03.85 is held by America's Janet Evans.
<p>
   ``No one would refuse a gold medal, but I wouldn't feel like it
was a gold medal under those circumstances,'' Teuscher, 16, from
New Rochelle, N.Y., said. ``My time was second place.''
<p>
   Richardson also said that five other members of the Chinese team
were found with drugs in their systems during the random tests. But
the results were inconclusive on whether the substances were
illegal drugs or naturally occurring elements and would not be
listed as positive tests pending further laboratory results, the
doctor said in a telephone interview from his Honolulu office.
<p>
   ``We are still trying to reach absolute certainty on those,''
Richardson said. ``But this (Yang's test) is a positive.''
<p>
   Steroids add to muscle bulk and help athletes recover from
injuries and the wear and tear of practice. They are banned by the
International Olympic Committee and virtually every other sports
body in the world.
<p>
   Yang tested positive for testosterone, a hormone that occurs
natutally in men but not in women. To flunk a testosterone test, a
man must show a ratio of at least 6-1 for testosterone and
epitestosterone, a chemical indicator. The ratio for Yang was at
least 9-1 and as high as 15-1, according to Richardson.
<p>
   The tests were taken in mid-October and the results of the first
part of the two-stage test were available within 10 days,
Richardson said. ``It took a little while longer for the `B' sample
because we had to wait for a Chinese team representative to be
present,'' he said.
<p>
   But there was no general word of Yang's positive test until
Wednesday, when a story quoting anonymous sources appeared in the
Chicago Tribune.
<p>
   The Chinese swimming program has been plagued by rumors of drug
use since it started rolling up gold medals and world records in
1988. In recent years, Chinese women have dominated the sport, and
at the last world championships in Rome Yang and her teammates won
12 of 16 titles and set five world records. All of the winner
passed drug tests in Rome.
<p>
   The rout was so thorough that coaches and team directors from
the United States and 17 other nations signed a petition asking
FINA to tighten drug controls. It was then that the random testing
began.
<p>
   Chinese coaches and officials have steadfastly denied using
illegal drugs in their programs, saying the astounding results have
been produced by innovative training in a group of top athletes
plucked from a population of more than 1 billion.

Davenport Ousts Huber in Slims Championships
By BOB GREENE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  With Martina Navratilova into her first day of
retirement, baseline slugging highlighted women's tennis Wednesday,
with Lindsay Davenport ousting Anke Huber from the Virginia Slims
Championships.
<p>
   Davenport, the No. 7 seed, captured the first-round match at
Madison Square Garden 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 and will next face No. 4 Jana
Novotna.
<p>
   The first round of this dlrs 3.5 million, season-ending
tournament was completed later Wednesday night when No. 5 Mary
Pierce played South Africa's Amanda Coetzer and No. 3 Conchita
Martinez took on Natalia Zvereva of Belarus.
<p>
   Where Navratilova roamed the entire court, using a sliced
backhand to work her way to the net for a volley, Davenport and
Huber were content to stand at the baseline and see who could belt
shots past the other.
<p>
   There was no disguising tactics: hit hard, harder and hardest.
The only diversion was an occasional moon ball to allow the players
to get back into position for another barrage of heavy
groundstrokes.
<p>
   While Davenport is the higher ranked of the two, and thus was
seeded in this elite 16-player field, Huber has been one of the
hottest players on the WTA Tour in the last two months.
<p>
   The German had entered this tournament coming off a victory at
the Virginia Slims of Philadelphia, where she defeated Pierce in
the final. She also beat Pierce to capture a title in Filderstadt,
Germany, last month.
<p>
   Huber earned dlrs 14,000 for the first-round loss, pushing her
1994 earnings to nearly dlrs 450,000.

Landmark Study Shows Cholesterol-Lowering Drug Saves Lives
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
AP Science Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS (AP)  &MD;  A new study shows for the first time that powerful
cholesterol-lowering drugs can sharply reduce the risk of death in
people with heart disease.
<p>
   The study found that the drug simvastatin lowered the chance of
dying by 30 percent during five years of treatment following heart
attacks and angina chest pain.
<p>
   Experts said the work could have a profound effect on the way
doctors treat heart trouble.
<p>
   ``This is a landmark study in the history of medicine,'' said
Dr. Joseph Goldstein of the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, who shared the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1985 for
cholesterol research.
<p>
   Four similar cholesterol-lowering drugs are available. But many
physicians are reluctant to prescribe them because there had been
no clear proof until now that they help people live longer.
<p>
   The latest evidence that they work comes from a study conducted
in Nordic countries. It was released Wednesday at a meeting of the
American Heart Association and is to be published in the British
journal Lancet.
<p>
   The study does not answer the larger question about the use of
these medicines in outwardly healthy people. Some doctors prescribe
them to people who have high cholesterol levels but no signs of
heart disease, and there is still no evidence that the medicine
helps them live longer.
<p>
   The study was conducted on 4,444 men and women at 94 hospitals
in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It was financed by
Merck and Co., the drug company that makes simvastatin.
<p>
   The volunteers were randomly assigned to take simvastatin or
dummy pills. Among the key findings after five years of follow-up:
    &MD; The overall risk of death was 30 percent lower in the group
that took simvastatin, and their risk of dying from heart disease
was 42 percent lower.
    &MD; 256 patients in the placebo group died, compared with 182 in
the simvastatin group.
    &MD; The need for coronary bypass operations and angioplasty was 37
percent lower in the treated group.
<p>
   ``Cholesterol lowering with this powerful drug prolongs life,''
said Dr. Terje R. Pedersen of Aker Hospital in Oslo, Norway, the
study's director.
<p>
   When the study began, the patients' cholesterol levels were
mildly elevated. They ranged from 212 to 309. After taking the
drug, their cholesterol fell by 25 percent. However, their levels
of HDL, the good form of cholesterol that protects against heart
disease, rose 8 percent.
<p>
   Currently, about one-quarter of heart patients in the United
States are taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Several experts said
they expect this to increase substantially as the result of the
latest study.
<p>
   Dr. K. Lance Gould of the University of Texas Medical School in
Houston said he would recommend cholesterol-lowering drugs to all
his heart patients with elevated cholesterol.
<p>
   He predicted that treatment this way could reduce the need for
bypass surgery and angioplasty.
<p>
   ``This could have a tremendous economic impact,'' he said.
<p>
   Treatment with simvastatin and similar drugs costs between dlrs
1,000 and dlrs 2,000 per year, depending on the brand and dose
used.
<p>
   Worldwide, heart disease causes about one-fourth of all deaths,
about 12 million per year.

Judge Expresses Regret for Granting Hyped TV Interview
By LINDA DEUTSCH
AP Special Correspondent
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  The judge in the O.J. Simpson trial expressed
regret Wednesday for granting a heavily hyped, five-part television
interview.
<p>
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito was questioning an alternate
juror prospect who saw a full-page newspaper ad on his KCBS
television station interview.
<p>
   ``I kind of flipped the page quickly,'' said the woman, who is
under orders from Ito to avoid media coverage of the case.
<p>
   ``So did I,'' the judge responded. ``If I had known that they
were going to do that, I wouldn't have done that'' interview.
<p>
   The woman was passed the in-depth phase of questioning as the
search for 15 alternate jurors continued.
<p>
   Ito's interview, which began airing Sunday, has puzzled legal
observers. Although it wasn't unethical, they said, it was unusual
for a judge to grant such an interview, particularly one who has
relentlessly criticized media coverage of the case.
<p>
   Simpson, a former football great, television sports commentator
and movie star, has been charged with murder in the June 12
slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her
friend Ronald Goldman.
<p>
   The U.S. media has covered the case intently and segments of the
public have been kept rapt as it unfolded.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Simpson's attorney Robert Shapiro said Ito's wife,
police Capt. Peggy York, agreed to appear at a hearing to explore
whether she once helped investigate a detective who found a bloody
glove on Simpson's estate.
<p>
   Shapiro informed Ito that the hearing, before a different judge,
was scheduled for Monday. Shapiro didn't elaborate in court but
told reporters outside the courtroom: ``There may be some conflict
of interest.''
<p>
   York may have been involved in an investigation of detective
Mark Fuhrman, Shapiro said, adding, ``The emphasis is on the word
`may.'''
<p>
   The Simpson defense has accused Fuhrman of racism. Shapiro said
the defense isn't attempting to disqualify Ito from the case, but
will explore ``how much we'll be able to ask Detective Fuhrman''
when he testifies at the trial.
<p>
   Also, ``If there's a possibility she could be a witness, we want
to know those things before trial, so no one will be embarrassed,''
Shapiro said.
<p>
   Fuhrman, who is white, was portrayed by defense lawyers as a
racist who might have planted the glove to implicate Simpson, who
is black.
<p>
   This summer, Ito rejected a defense bid to examine Fuhrman's
personnel and military records.
<p>
   Four of six people questioned Wednesday were kept, bringing the
number of people in the pool of possible alternate jurors to 22.
The alternates will replace any jurors drop out during the trial.

Former Costa Rican President Urges Haiti To Abolish Army

Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)  &MD;  The former president of Costa Rica
says Haiti should follow his country's model and disband its army.
<p>
   ``There is no better way to consolidate and strengthen
democratic institutions than to abolish the armed forces,'' said
Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his
efforts to bring peace to Central America.
<p>
   President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who held a press conference at
the national palace with Arias on Wednesday, declined to comment on
the proposal. Pressed for a response, Aristide said only: ``The
country is a symphony and we have to hear all the voices.''
<p>
   Army leaders toppled Aristide in a 1991 coup and ruled by force
until U.S. troops arrived two months ago. The army, which worked in
tandem with police, has been blamed for thousands of political
killings during those three years.
<p>
   Arias said the military has been the greatest source of
instability throughout Latin America, and that Haiti only needs a
police force to combat crime.
<p>
   Costa Rica, the most stable country in Central America,
disbanded its armed forces in 1948.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, two government officials confirmed that
Aristide, whose championship of the poor alienated the Roman
Catholic church hierarchy, is leaving the priesthood.
<p>
   The Vatican, long at odds with the populist priest, pressured
Aristide to resign, said a church source who requested anonymity.
The source said Aristide will send a letter of resignation to the
Vatican, but he did not say when.
<p>
   A senior Vatican official, however, said it was unlikely the
Vatican would provoke a confrontation with Aristide at such a
sensitive moment in Haiti.
<p>
   Aristide, who swept U.N.-supervised elections four years ago,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years in exile. Thousands
of U.S. soldiers came to the Caribbean nation to help restore his
government.
<p>
   Aristide spokesman Yvon Neptune acknowledged there had been
friction with the church.
<p>
   ``The Catholic hierarchy ... was uncomfortable with the
president being a lay authority and at the same time a priest who
should be working for the Holy See,'' Neptune said.
<p>
   Aristide's withdrawal from the priesthood is not likely to hurt
his support among Haiti's poor, many of whom associated the
conservative church hierarchy with the old military regime.
<p>
   The Salesian order expelled Aristide in 1988, saying his
liberation theology teachings were inciting class war. The Vatican
never formally defrocked him.
<p>
   The president has appeared more moderate since returning to
Haiti, repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   Aristide, who did not comment on the priesthood issue, got a
warm reception Wednesday from hundreds of business executives
before he met with Arias.
<p>
   ``Without you, it means failure. With you, success,'' Aristide
told the gathering of business leaders at the palace. Aristide's
relations with the business community were once strained by his
leftist ideology.
<p>
   On a different topic, the death toll from Tropical Storm Gordon,
which lashed Haiti with heavy rains and flooding early Monday,
continued to rise. Radio Signal FM reported 400 dead overall,
although government officials said they had no overall count
because of poor communications.

Hockey General Managers Accuse Union of Bad Faith Bargaining
Eds: UPDATES with site of Thursday's negotiations in Boston
By JIMMY GOLEN
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TORONTO (AP)  &MD;  A day after meeting with commissioner Gary
Bettman for an update on the North American National Hockey League
lockout, the general managers said at a news conference they are
becoming increasingly frustrated with what they consider bad-faith
negotiating by union head Bob Goodenow.
<p>
   ``He thinks we're all going to fall down,'' Edmonton general
manager Glen Sather said Wednesday. ``We can't. We're already
down.''
<p>
   Edmonton is one of the small-market clubs that would benefit
most from the controlled salary system owners are demanding, so
Sather's position was not surprising. He was joined by two
hard-liners, Harry Sinden of the Boston Bruins and Lou Lamoriello
of the New Jersey Devils.
<p>
   The stalled talks and heated rhetoric have even made a pessimist
of moderates like Neil Smith, whose defending Stanley Cup champion
New York Rangers probably have the most to lose in a lost season.
<p>
   ``Yesterday's meeting killed all my optimism,'' he said. ``I
more intently listened to the real issues, and realized that we are
dead in the water.''
<p>
   The general managers said they are frustrated with Goodenow's
refusal to engage in give-and-take during bargaining. Lamoriello
said owners have made proposals that were open to negotiation,
``and the only reaction to it was, `No.'''
<p>
   Sinden said the league has offered to guarantee the players
their current 60 percent of revenues. When that was rejected, they
asked Goodenow to pick a number  &MD;  70 percent, even 100 percent of
revenues  &MD;  that would be fair to the players, just to get the
discussion going.
<p>
   ``His answer was, `Well, that would still be a cap,''' Sinden
said. ``Now you tell me how you can negotiate with that?
<p>
   ``He told us (during the 1992 players' strike), `When you're
down on your knees, then I might talk to you about some salaries
tied to a revenue plan,'' Sinden said. ``And we're not there yet.
Only half of us are on our knees.''
<p>
   Bettman and Goodenow are planning to meet Thursday at an
undisclosed location  &MD;  the first meeting in a week. Sources told
The Associated Press that it will be in Boston.
<p>
   At the meeting, owners are expected to present a counter-offer
to the player proposal on two-way contracts and arbitration for
rookies. That offer, Sinden said, included concessions in areas
that had never been considered problems.
<p>
   The source told the AP that the league proposal Thursday will
focus on rookie pay and salary arbitration, but will not address a
payroll tax. The payroll tax has not been brought up in the last
two meetings, Lamoriello said.
<p>
   The lockout has lasted 47 days, resulting in 14 games canceled
from each team's schedule. The league expects another round of
double-digit cancellations this week.

St. Kitts' Inmates Riot In New Jail Facility,
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP)  &MD;  About 80 inmates on Wednesday
protested against the physical conditions of their new prison
facility, five days after a riot and fire destroyed this
Caribbean's island only jail.
<p>
   The inmates were moved from the burned out prison compound to
temporary quarters in a reconverted electronics factory on east
Bassetere Tuesday.
<p>
   Inmates broke windows of the new facility in Wednesday's protest
and threw objects outside as armed police and troops from the
Barbados-based Regional Security Forces guarded the facility.
<p>
   No incidents were reported.
<p>
   The inmates were complaining about the lack of ventilation in
the factory. They are living together in a huge hallway which has
one main entrance.
<p>
   This is the second riot since Friday when prisoners protested
the release on bail for drugs and weapons charges of the two sons
of Sidney Morris, who resigned Tuesday as deputy prime minister.
<p>
   The Morris brothers' arrest was linked to the Oct. 1
disappearance and deaths of another brother, Vincent, and his
girlfriend, Joan Walsh and to the Oct. 13 killing of the top police
official searching for them.
<p>
   Some of the inmates escaped after the prison was burned down in
Friday's riot and police and troops from several neighboring
Caribbean nations were called in to restore order.
<p>
   One prisoner remained at large after the mass jail break. He was
identified as Lissue Watkins of St. Thomas, who is charged with
murder.

Dollar Opens Lower, Stocks Slip Back in Early Trading
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The U.S. dollar opened lower against the Japanese
yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market Thursday, while prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange slipped back in early trading.
<p>
   The dollar started trading at 98.25 yen, down 0.37 yen from
Wednesday's close and also below its overnight New York finish at
98.25 yen.
<p>
   The dollar's low open followed its weakness in New York on
Wednesday due to profit taking on a surge that followed a cut in
interest rates by the U.S. central bank Tuesday.
<p>
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average inched
down 4.40 points, a statistically insignificant amount, to
19,302.26 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the
average shed 85.02 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 19,306.66.
<p>
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 2.01 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,523.49. The
TOPIX closed at 1,525.50 on Wednesday, down 3.14 points, or 0.21
percent.
<p>
   Trading remained slow as many investors remained sidelined
because of a lack of fresh market-affecting news.
<p>
   As of 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), the price of the benchmark No. 164
10-year Japanese government bonds was 96.00 yen, up 0.06 yen from
Wednesday's close. Their yield fell by 0.010 percentage point to
4.730 percent.

Father Found Guilty of Killing Disabled Daughter
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BATTLEFORD, Saskatchewan (AP)  &MD;  A father who spent years
spoon-feeding his disabled daughter before venting exhaust fumes to
end her life was found guilty Wednesday of second-degree murder.
<p>
   Justice Ross Wimmer of Saskatchewan Court sentenced Robert
Latimer to the minimum sentence  &MD;  life in prison without
eligibility for parole for 10 years.
<p>
   Latimer, 41, had pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of
his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, in October 1993. She suffered from
a severe form of cerebral palsy, a disorder of the central nervous
system usually marked by spastic paralysis.
<p>
   ``I still feel I did what was right,'' Latimer told the court.
``I don't think you people are being human.''
<p>
   The jury of six women and five men who convicted him was not in
court for sentencing.
<p>
   ``It's not a crime to stick a feeding tube into her stomach?''
he asked Wimmer, referring to one of the measures Tracy had to
endure to survive.
<p>
   ``There is no joy in this for anyone,'' the judge said.
``Criminal law is unremitting when it comes to taking a life.''
<p>
   Life was not kind to Tracy, Wimmer said, but ``it was Tracy's
life to make of it what she could.''
<p>
   Latimer's attorney, Mark Brayford, plans to appeal the ruling.
<p>
   A farmer from nearby Wilkie in central Saskatchewan, Latimer was
accused of had been accused of piping exhaust into a truck to kill
Tracy.
<p>
   He confessed to police about killing Tracy on the family farm
and said he planned to stop the engine if Tracy started crying.
<p>
   ``She just fell asleep,'' Latimer told police 11 days after the
October 1993 death.
<p>
   ``My priority was to put her out of her pain.''

the national palace with Arias on Wednesday, declined to comment on
the proposal. Pressed for a response, Aristide said only: ``The
country is a symphony and we have to hear all the voices.''
<p>
   Army leaders toppled Aristide in a 1991 coup and ruled by force
until U.S. troops arrived two months ago. The army, which worked in
tandem with police, has been blamed for thousands of political
killings during those three years.
<p>
   Arias said the military has been the greatest source of
instability throughout Latin America, and that Haiti only needs a
police force to combat crime.
<p>
   Costa Rica, the most stable country in Central America,
disbanded its armed forces in 1948.
<p>
   Also Wednesday, two government officials confirmed that
Aristide, whose championship of the poor alienated the Roman
Catholic church hierarchy, is leaving the priesthood.
<p>
   The Vatican, long at odds with the populist priest, pressured
Aristide to resign, said a church source who requested anonymity.
The source said Aristide will send a letter of resignation to the
Vatican, but he did not say when.
<p>
   A senior Vatican official, however, said it was unlikely the
Vatican would provoke a confrontation with Aristide at such a
sensitive moment in Haiti.
<p>
   Aristide, who swept U.N.-supervised elections four years ago,
returned to Haiti on Oct. 15 after three years in exile. Thousands
of U.S. soldiers came to the Caribbean nation to help restore his
government.
<p>
   Aristide spokesman Yvon Neptune acknowledged there had been
friction with the church.
<p>
   ``The Catholic hierarchy ... was uncomfortable with the
president being a lay authority and at the same time a priest who
should be working for the Holy See,'' Neptune said.
<p>
   Aristide's withdrawal from the priesthood is not likely to hurt
his support among Haiti's poor, many of whom associated the
conservative church hierarchy with the old military regime.
<p>
   The Salesian order expelled Aristide in 1988, saying his
liberation theology teachings were inciting class war. The Vatican
never formally defrocked him.
<p>
   The president has appeared more moderate since returning to
Haiti, repeatedly calling for unity and reconciliation.
<p>
   Aristide, who did not comment on the priesthood issue, got a
warm reception Wednesday from hundreds of business executives
before he met with Arias.
<p>
   ``Without you, it means failure. With you, success,'' Aristide
told the gathering of business leaders at the palace. Aristide's
relations with the business community were once strained by his
leftist ideology.
<p>
   On a different topic, the death toll from Tropical Storm Gordon,
which lashed Haiti with heavy rains and flooding early Monday,
continued to rise. Radio Signal FM reported 400 dead overall,
although government officials said they had no overall count
because of poor communications.

Federal Judge Issues Temporary Restraining Order Against
Proposition 187
By MICHAEL WHITE
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  A federal judge issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the state from implementing most
provisions of Proposition 187, the voter-approved measure that
would deny public services to illegal immigrants.
<p>
   The 10-day order applies to sections that would prohibit
undocumented immigrants from receiving educational, social and
non-emergency medical services. It does not apply to sections that
pertain to the creation and use of false immigration papers,
already a felony under federal law.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. said Wednesday there were
``serious questions'' as to whether the sections under the
temporary restraining order would violate immigrants' rights to due
process because the measure makes no provision for hearings to
determine whether the denial was justly applied.
<p>
   He said there was also the possibility that it infringes upon
federal immigration law by requiring educators, police officers and
others to do the job of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers.
<p>
   In arguments before the judge, American Civil Liberties Union
attorney Mark Rosenbaum said the measure's worst impact would fall
upon the sick and young children who have no control over their
legal status.
<p>
   He said that it already was keeping some immigrants away from
hospitals and clinics, raising the possibility of immediate damage
to their health.
<p>
   ``People in this community, large numbers, have stopped using
services,'' he said.
<p>
   Attorneys for the state asked Byrne to wait until regulations to
implement the measure were written.
<p>
   ``The court has a responsibility, if possible, to find an
interpretation of the statute that saves it,'' said Deputy Attorney
General John Ichinaga.
<p>
   Questioned by Byrne, Ichinaga said that a memo already had been
drafted  &MD;  but not distributed  &MD;  authorizing police to ask for
residency documents when dealing with people whom they suspect to
be in the country illegally.
<p>
   Ichinaga also said that regulations would provide for a hearing
process for those denied state services, but Byrne said he could
not take that into consideration because the regulations had not
been drafted and he had no way of knowing for certain that hearings
would be provided.
<p>
   Proposition 187 was overwhelmingly approved by California voters
on Nov. 8.
<p>
   A state court judge in San Francisco last week blocked
enforcement of the education aspects of the measure, which wasn't
scheduled to take effect until Jan. 1.
<p>
   Superior Court Judge Stuart Pollak barred enforcement of
Proposition 187's requirement that undocumented immigrants be
kicked out of the state's public schools, as well as public
colleges and universities.
<p>
   Pollak noted that the proposition, approved by nearly 6 in 10
voters, conflicts with a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling requiring
states to provide a public education to all residents.
<p>
   Analysts said the provision banning illegal immigrants from
attending public schools is the most vulnerable, at least
temporarily, because the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar
Texas law in a 1982 case called Plyler vs. Doe.

Exxon, Union Carbide Among Nation's Worst Polluters
By MAGGIE JACKSON
AP Business Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Exxon and Union Carbide, two companies notorious
for brutal environmental disasters, were among eight businesses
listed Wednesday as the nation's worst corporate polluters.
<p>
   Exxon Corp., which was cited for the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and
Union Carbide Corp., for its ``deplorable'' record of chemical
spills, joined six others on the third annual list compiled by the
New York-based Council on Economic Priorities.
<p>
   General Electric Co., however, won praise for a campaign to
promote more energy efficient light bulbs. It was one of six
companies to improve its record so much that it won removal from
last year's list.
<p>
   Such improvements help show the growing pressure that American
consumers are putting on U.S. companies to shape up their
environmental records, the group said.
<p>
   ``There's been an enormous increase in the last few years in the
degree to which consumers have begun to think about casting their
economic vote conscientiously and making environmental choices when
they shop,'' said Alice Tepper Marlin, founder of the Council.
<p>
   In compiling its list of the worst polluters, the Council
studies more than 100 companies in ``environmentally risky''
industries for toxic releases, air pollution, and environmental
clean-up efforts, among other barometers.
<p>
   Nine independent judges  &MD;  from professors to analysts to
environmental activists  &MD;  then review the data and name the worst
polluters. The Council also recommends steps that companies can
take to mend their ways.
<p>
   Other offenders to make this year's list were: International
Paper Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Southern Co., Texaco Inc.,
Westvaco Corp. and Maxxam Inc. All eight companies, which were not
ranked, responded by defending their records and criticizing the
council's work.
<p>
   Exxon was cited for a second year for the 1989 Valdez spill and
for its ``long history of problems,'' including government health
and safety violations, at its Baton Rouge refinery.
<p>
   G.L. Graves, Exxon's vice president of environment and safety,
said the company ``completely rejects'' the council's findings,
calling them ``unsubstantiated, unfair and inaccurate.''
<p>
   Graves said Exxon has made constant efforts to improve its
environmental record, including reducing its releases of U.S. toxic
chemicals for six years.
<p>
   Union Carbide won a spot on the list for its ``deplorable
performance'' in terms of chemical spills and for a poor worker
accident record.
<p>
   The Council also chastized Union Carbide for failing to build a
promised hospital for victims of the company's December 1984 gas
leak in India. That disaster has killed more than 4,000 people, the
Indian government says.

Don't Abuse Your Powers, Indian Security Forces Are Told
AP Photos DEL101-102

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TEKANPUR, India (AP)  &MD;  Deep inside bandit country, Indian
paramilitary troops were told what they normally don't hear  &MD; 
respect human rights.
<p>
   In the first face-to-face effort to curb abuses by troops, the
International Committee of the Red Cross met Wednesday with
commanders of the Indian Border Security Force.
<p>
   BSF soldiers, who are battling Muslim secessionists in Kashmir
and quelling a half-dozen insurgencies around India, have been
widely criticized for firing on unarmed civilians, raping women
during searches and treating prisoners shabbily.
<p>
   The Red Cross sent a former British police officer and a Swiss
army major to Tekanpur, the BSF's main training center, for a
three-day human rights workshop for the 22 commanders of some
171,000 BSF troops.
<p>
   Stung by international criticism of its human rights record, the
Indian government in the past year began allowing Western diplomats
to visit trouble spots in an attempt to appear more open. The
government also said it created a national human rights commission
to punish abusive troops.
<p>
   They have been implicated in widespread rights abuses:
    &MD; In Kashmir, troops have been accused of executing prisoners,
torture and unwarranted killings in trying to suppress a rebellion
by Muslim separatists. Jammu-Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority
state in mainly Hindu India. More than 9,500 people, mostly
civilians, have been killed since the insurgency began in 1989.
    &MD; In Punjab state, 18,000 people have been killed since 1982,
when Sikh rebels began fighting to set up an independent homeland.
The death toll dropped drastically in 1994, but there are frequent
reports of human rights violations. Rights groups say captured
rebels were executed in custody without trial, and many more were
shot during gun battles in villages and fields.
    &MD; In southern India, there have been allegations of human rights
abuses in Andhra Pradesh state. There, rights activists are
investigating claims that 496 alleged members of the outlawed
leftist Peoples' War Group were killed in staged confrontations
between 1991 and 1994.
    &MD; In the remote northeast, Indian troops fighting three other
separatist campaigns have been accused of various human rights
violations.
<p>
   Amnesty International welcomed the new human rights thrust but
cautioned that talk alone won't solve the problem.
<p>
   ``The training of security forces personnel will have little or
no effect unless it is matched by decisive measures to halt human
rights violations, and this the government has failed to do,'' the
London-based group said in a statement.
<p>
   But Ralph Crawshaw, the Red Cross rights trainer from Britain,
called it ``a very important interaction for safeguarding human
rights.''
<p>
   ``At least we are talking, and I must say I am impressed by the
interest shown by the BSF to ensure that its reputation as a
fighting force is not tarnished,'' Crawshaw said.
<p>
   As he spoke, BSF officers sat in a circle in a castle built by
the former rulers of Gwalior state on the shore of a lake used to
breed crocodiles. Some officers munched cashew nuts and debated
what the seminar is all about.
<p>
   ``I tell my men that we have to demonstrate that we have the
power to crush militancy but with a human face,'' said BSF chief
Daya Kishore Arya.
<p>
   The Red Cross said it plans to hold rights workshops in other
parts of India.
<p>
   ``I hope this is the beginning,'' said David Delapraz, South
Asia chief for the Red Cross.

Comet Fragment Creates Fireball Hotter than Sun's Surface

AP Science Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP)  &MD;  One of the comet fragments that smashed
into Jupiter's surface last summer created a 5-mile-wide
(8-kilometer-wide) fireball hotter than the surface of the sun,
according to space scientists.
<p>
   Fragment G was one of 21 from the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet that
exploded in Jupiter's atmosphere between July 16 and July 22.
<p>
   When instruments aboard NASA's Galileo spacecraft first detected
it on July 18, the fragment G fireball was 5 miles (8 kilometers)
across and had a temperature of at least 14,000 degrees Fahrenheit
(7,760 degrees C). The sun's temperature is 9,927 degrees
Fahrenheit (5,497 degrees C).
<p>
   The spacecraft then recorded the expansion of the fireball
within about a minute and a half to hundreds of miles (kilometers)
across and a drop in temperature to 260 degrees Fahrenheit (127
degrees C).
<p>
   ``Very simply, it looks to us like an expanding, cooling bubble
of hot gas,'' said Robert Carlson, the principal infrared
investigator at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory here. ``But obviously, it will take more
complicated models to explain the data.''
<p>
   By combining readings from three instruments, which can detect
light and heat from parts of the spectrum not visible to the eye,
the Galileo scientists ``have characterized a comet impact directly
for the first time in history,'' said Galileo Project scientist
Torrence V. Johnson.
<p>
   The spacecraft at the time was 150 million miles (240 million
kilometers) from Jupiter and uniquely positioned at an angle to
record information that could not be gathered from Earth.
<p>
   ``Having a spacecraft sitting out in front of Jupiter ready to
do this was a big stroke of luck,'' said Robert T. Mitchell,
science and sequence manager for Galileo at JPL. ``It's not
something we planned to do at the time Galileo was designed and
launched. It was very serendipitous.''
<p>
   Previously, scientists had images from the Hubble Space
Telescope that they believed showed them the cloud that rose after
the impact.
<p>
   ``When the comet first hits the atmosphere, there is just a
flash of light, analogous to a meteorite you would see at Earth,''
Mitchell explained. ``But whereas in Earth, the thing just burns up
in the atmosphere, and nothing is left but dust and particles, here
because of total energy involved, there's immediately an explosion
that wells back up into atmosphere and creates a fireball of gases
rising above the atmosphere.''
<p>
   The analysis of six impacts, including that of fragment G, was
presented Oct. 31 at the annual meeting of the Division of
Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. The
impacts are expected to generate a treasure trove of new
information about Jupiter and its atmosphere.
<p>
   Scientists estimate that fragment G had the explosive power of 6
million megatons of TNT. The impact sent black plumes the size of
Earth into the gaseous clouds that rise above Jupiter, a planet 11
times the diameter of Earth.
<p>
   Galileo provided ``the only opportunity we have had to have
elements of Jupiter's atmosphere get blown back up where we can see
effects from it,'' Mitchell said. Scientists hope to construct a
detailed profile of the heat and energy released by the impacts and
get a better sense of the composition of the comet and Jupiter's
atmosphere.
<p>
   However, they are puzzled that the Hubble and Earth-based
observatories were able to see some of the impacts beyond the curve
of the planet at the same time as Galileo did.
<p>
   ``There's a bit of a mystery here,'' Mitchell said. ``We think
people on Earth shouldn't have seen it until it had time to rise
above the horizon. The safest thing to say about it is, we just
haven't figured it out yet.''

   BAREFOOT BAY, Fla. (AP)  &MD;  Pink insulation hung from broken
branches like strips of confetti. The crumpled remains of mobile
homes littered the streets. Drenched furniture lay buried under
crushed metal and wooden beams.
<p>
   ``I said, `What is that noise?' and everything blew,'' Seline
Harrod recalled. ``I laid my face down on the floor and my husband
laid on top of me.''
<p>
   Harrod and her neighbors told tales of terror Wednesday, the
morning after Tropical Storm Gordon sent a tornado through this
tight-knit retirement community, where people socialize over
shuffleboard and fire auxiliary chicken dinners.
<p>
   The storm generated other tornadoes and thunderstorms on a
200-mile (320-kilometer) path across Florida after devastating
Haiti. Radio reports put the death toll in Haiti at up to 400.
<p>
   In Florida, which has gotten 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain
since Sunday, six people died, scores were injured and dozens of
homes destroyed. The storm zigzagged around Cuba and south of the
Florida Keys, then churned into the Gulf of Mexico and came ashore
with wind near 50 mph (80 kph) on the state's west coast between
Naples and Fort Myers.
<p>
   The weakened storm spun out into the Atlantic late Wednesday
with winds down to 45 mph (72 kph). All tropical storm warnings
were discontinued for Florida as Gordon moved northeast at 15 mph
(24 kph), a path it was expected to continue through Thursday.
<p>
   In Barefoot Bay and Snug Harbor Lakes, an adjacent mobile home
retirement community along the Atlantic Coast, the tornado
destroyed 68 mobile homes, damaged more than 380, killed one man
and injured 40, including two critically.
<p>
   Rescuers used trained dogs in driving rain to pull apart pieces
of mangled aluminum and insulation and make sure no one was
trapped. No others were found.
<p>
   After the tornado damaged the Harrods' trailer home, Mrs.
Harrod's husband, Doug, pried open the door, sat his wife in their
car and went to check on neighbors. He forced open 71-year-old
Eileen Sheehan's door and got her out.
<p>
   ``I was going out to the kitchen and all of a sudden the lights
went off, the ceiling started falling in and the windows blew out.
There was glass all over the floor,'' Sheehan said.
<p>
   Emergency crews worked to restore power to homes that escaped
severe damage. The Red Cross opened two shelters for people left
homeless, but many were taken in by neighbors.
<p>
   Brevard County sheriff's deputies kept most people out of the
area because of the danger of flying debris. ``We're trying to get
rid of sightseers, and aluminum sales people especially,'' said
sheriff's spokeswoman Joan Heller.
<p>
   A pizza delivery man took orders from sightseers gawking at a
506-foot (154-meter) Turkish freighter that ran aground just off
the beach at Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday.
<p>
   The storms' other Florida victims either drowned or were killed
in car accidents.

Pioneering Aquarium Celebrates 10th Anniversary, Undergoes

<p>
   MONTEREY, Calif. (AP)  &MD;  Kelp rises from the sandy bottom, waving
gracefully with the pulse of the sea. Sardines are merely a gray
smudge in the water  &MD;  until they turn and the dim light transforms
them into a shimmering silver cloud.
<p>
   Sea otters play and snooze on the rocks nearby, as stilts look
for worms in the damp sand between the reeds and the surf.
<p>
   Such realistic displays have made the Monterey Bay Aquarium a
model since its opening a decade ago, and the 17.5 million visitors
it has attracted thus far make it the most popular aquarium in the
nation, too.
<p>
   ``It is certainly the finest aquarium in the country, without
question,'' says Raymond Chavez, a film producer for the San
Francisco-based Marine Mammal Fund. ``They've really found a
balance between education and entertainment.''
<p>
   The aquarium, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San
Francisco, at once teaches and enchants by taking visitors through
the many worlds along and beneath the waves.
<p>
   More than 100 exhibits and galleries display some 500 different
plant and animal species that inhabit the shore, wharves, deep
reefs and sea floor. A huge new wing under construction will offer
glimpses at the bay's outer waters and the deep sea beyond.
<p>
   Even on weekdays, visitors crowd around the sea otter exhibit,
oohing and ahhing over the young animals that were rescued and will
be returned to the sea. They gingerly pet bat rays that glide
through a shallow sandy pool or try to catch giant octopuses
changing color.
<p>
   They wonder at the three-story-high kelp forest  &MD;  the world's
tallest aquarium exhibit  &MD;  then stroll along an aviary that
reproduces a sandy beach. Then, they can watch live television
programs broadcast from a research submarine exploring the depths
of the bay.
<p>
   ``I love it. I just like to see all the big fish,'' 9-year-old
Russell Hall of Piedmont, Calif., says as he admires foot-long
(30-centimeter-long) steelhead trout in an indoor-outdoor exhibit
that reproduces a coastal stream.
<p>
   ``I like the trout best,'' he says. ``And I like the rays  &MD;  they
feel slippery.''
<p>
   Visitors come from all over the world, and nearly 100,000
individuals and households are members of the nonprofit,
self-supporting institution.
<p>
   ``I don't think it dawned on us even the day it opened that it
would be so successful,'' says Steve Webster, a marine biologist
who heads the aquarium's education programs.
<p>
   The whole thing sprang from an idea Webster and three colleagues
had in 1977. The four marine biologists, who were conducting
research in Monterey at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine
Center, realized that a closed-down sardine-packing factory on
nearby Cannery Row was a good place for an aquarium.
<p>
   One of the scientists was Nancy Burnett, daughter of Silicon
Valley pioneer and philanthropist David Packard. And Packard had
just happened to ask his family to find a worthy project they could
make their own.
<p>
   Packard and his wife, Lucille, formed a foundation that paid
dlrs 55 million to build the aquarium, intended to foster public
interest in investigating and protecting the sea.
<p>
   An additional dlrs 13 million went into the creation of the
aquarium's sister institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute.
<p>
   Now 82, Packard has helped develop exhibits and is still
president of the aquarium's board. Another daughter, Julie Packard
 &MD;  also a marine biologist  &MD;  is the aquarium's director.
<p>
   Monterey Bay was an ideal place for such an ambitious project.
The region already was a magnet for tourists, and nutrients welling
up from the cold depths of a huge offshore canyon give the region
an amazing variety of marine life.
<p>
   The bay's relatively clean waters also offered an unusual
opportunity. The museum pumps up to 3 million gallons (11.4 million
liters) of sea water a day through its exhibits, including the kelp
forest in its 335,000-gallon (1.25-million-liter) tank.
<p>
   The unfiltered water carries the spores of algae and larvae of
invertebrates, completing the virtually natural environments in the
displays.
<p>
   As impressive as the exhibits are, Webster and other aquarium
officials are proudest of its educational accomplishments  &MD; 
fostering knowledge and love of the bay and the ocean beyond.

Pennsylvania Naturalist Earns Worldwide Reputation
By AMY SANCETTA
Associated Press Photographer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   KEMPTON, Pa. (AP)  &MD;  From the jagged outcropping of rock known as
Owl's Head, the lush farmland wedged between the ridges of the
Kittatinny Mountains stretches out hundreds of feet below.
<p>
   Occasionally, a red-tailed hawk catches an air current and
glides noiselessly past at eye level.
<p>
   Jim Brett rests against a rock and scowls out at the scenery.
The curator of Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in central Pennsylvania
explains his weekly trips to Owl's Head.
<p>
   ``Nobody's supposed to come out here, but they do sometimes.
Camp sometimes. Mess it up. ... So I try to get out here and check
it every Monday.''
<p>
   Then he grins, ``And it's a good way to start a week.''
<p>
   Brett, who oversees the 2,225-acre (900-hectare) raptor
sanctuary, is a character  &MD;  not to mention conservationist,
adventurer and mentor.
<p>
   A former biology teacher in nearby York County, Brett also spent
some time as a research biologist, writing impact statements for
nuclear power stations. He was about to enter Cornell University to
work on his Ph.D. in nature interpretation when he took the Hawk
Mountain job 24 years ago.
<p>
   During migration season, from August through December, Brett,
54, spends at least a few days a week perched for hours at a time
on the sanctuary's North Lookout, counting raptors, keeping records
and chatting with the regulars.
<p>
   Brett also does research, organizes programs and acts as teacher
to the young interns he recruits from Pottstown, Pa., to Tanzania.
<p>
   ``We're cutting edge,'' he says proudly of his internship
program. ``We have two black interns from Africa, one Hispanic from
Ecuador and Annette.''
<p>
   Annette Edwards of Trinidad was hired by Brett recently to
coordinate the sanctuary's internship program. He had met Edwards
on his travels, liked her and pursued her until she accepted the
job.
<p>
   She returns the admiration. ``He's such an inspiration ... he's
wonderful,'' says Edwards.
<p>
   Several seasonal interns also are accepted from the United
States, including three this fall from New Hampshire, Massachusetts
and Michigan. Brett works as hard to recruit those students as he
does the foreign interns. As a result, the program has become known
worldwide.
<p>
   For Brett, there are no days off. His work on and off the
mountain is more a lifestyle than a career.
<p>
   To keep himself fresh, he leaves the mountains of Pennsylvania
for up to 12 weeks a year and travels around the world.
<p>
   In 1995, he has trips planned for Panama, Israel, India and
Africa. He's been invited to attend the first Jordanian Hawk Watch
next fall.
<p>
   Officially, Brett's travels to Tanzania, South America, the
Middle East and Asia are for finding possible interns and speakers,
leading what he calls ``eco-tours,'' planning exhibits and raising
money for Hawk Mountain.
<p>
   Unofficially, he says, ``If I don't go away every once in
awhile, I go whammy.''
<p>
   Last March, Brett met the Dalai Lama in the Sinai Desert with a
group from the Society for the Protection of Nature.
<p>
   ``We talked about mutual understanding of the planet,'' he says
with uncharacteristic reverence. ``It was so provocative. ... It
was the aura. I don't get turned on by that stuff usually, but that
did something to me. Sitting high above the Red Sea, and the wind
was blowing, and behind this holy man was this huge flock of black
storks, and he said, `This is what we need to protect.'
<p>
   ``The whole moment transcended that particular time and place,''
he said.
<p>
   Brett pauses briefly, then puts his binoculars up to his eyes
and scans the valley.
<p>
   ``I'd like to get him here. I'm working on that,'' he adds
simply.

Telling Patients Their Medical Future
With FEATURE-US-Genetic Testing
By A.J. HOSTETLER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA (AP)  &MD;  Telling people their futures used to be a
carnival trick, full of hocus-pocus and based on a fortune-teller's
insight into human nature.
<p>
   Now, genetic counselors can read patients' medical futures from
their genes  &MD;  and tell them whether they will suffer a fatal
disease because of a mutation passed down through generations or
whether they have been spared.
<p>
   ``They see their destiny in a different fashion, and now can
make some life decisions,'' said Betsy Gettig, a genetic counselor
at the University of Pittsburgh. ``It gives people a sense of
appreciation of life.''
<p>
   According to the National Center for Human Genome Research, more
and more people will need the guidance and advice of genetic
counselors to make decisions about treatment, lifestyle changes to
avoid disease, or even about reproduction.
<p>
   Until recently, members of families with a history of genetic
illness didn't know if the disease would strike them.
<p>
   Now, scientists have pinpointed the genetic causes of a handful
of illnesses, such as Huntington's and Lou Gehrig's diseases.
Genetic links to Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, breast cancer and
even osteoarthritis also have been found.
<p>
   Patients are guided by counselors trained in either psychology
or biology, with master's degrees in genetic counseling, according
to Bea Leopold, executive director of the National Society of
Genetic Counselors. The 15-year-old association, based in suburban
Philadelphia, has about 1,200 members in North America.
<p>
   The process starts with a physician's referral for genetic
testing. But before any blood is drawn for the laboratory test,
counselors help patients determine if they REALLY want to be
tested.
<p>
   Recognizing that the outcome can be disturbing, even
devastating, counselor Barbara Bowles Biesecker of the National
Center for Human Genome Research rehearses with patients how she'll
tell them their results.
<p>
   ``I ask them, `Can you imagine the worst-case scenario? How will
you feel six months down the road?' Or, `Can you imagine sitting
down with your sister and you find out she doesn't carry (the gene)
and you do? How will you feel about her?'''
<p>
   Such questions help give patients a sense of at least some
control in a volatile situation, Biesecker said.
<p>
   Counselors also teach patients about the genetic mutation they
may carry, a lesson made more difficult by the emotional strain of
the process.
<p>
   ``Usually the patient  &MD;  mentally and emotionally  &MD;  is under the
assumption they have it from the start,'' Gettig said. ``You have
to go over the information several times before it sinks in. If
they get one out of every three words, you're doing well.''
<p>
   While awaiting the lab test, which can take several weeks,
patients undergo physical exams to rule out other diseases and
develop a portrait of how the suspected illness has affected their
families' past three generations.
<p>
   Often, the visit in which the results are delivered is the last
counseling session. Patients frequently want to struggle on their
own to deal with the outcome, leaving counselors to hope their
lessons got through.
<p>
   ``People are not interested in post-test counseling,'' Biesecker
said.

Administration Sued Over New Cuba Immigration Policy
By CASSANDRA BURRELL
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON (AP)  &MD;  An advocacy group sued the government
Wednesday, claiming the Clinton administration violated immigration
law when it signed the agreement that ended this summer's exodus of
boat people from Cuba.
<p>
   The Sept. 9 agreement also is likely to contribute to an upsurge
in immigration that is overcrowding the Miami area, the Federation
for American Immigration Reform  &MD;  or FAIR  &MD;  said.
<p>
   Because of the increase, legal residents ``suffer greater school
overcrowding, decreased access to public medical facilities,
reduced police protection and diminished employment
opportunities,'' the group said in a suit filed in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
<p>
   In negotiating the accord, Attorney General Janet Reno and
others exceeded their authority ``to defeat legal immigration
limits set by Congress,'' the group said.
<p>
   ``This suit raises critical issues about the balance of power in
this country and about who makes immigration policy  &MD;  the Congress
or the attorney general,'' FAIR Executive Director David Stein
said. ``This accord sets a very dangerous precedent. Congress sets
the immigration quotas and laws, not the attorney general.''
<p>
   The organization said it sued on behalf of 1,400 members in the
Miami and Dade County area. FAIR, which was founded in 1978, has
55,000 members nationwide.
<p>
   The group said it studies economic, environmental and social
consequences of immigration into the United States. It spoke out in
favor of California's Proposition 187 initiative to deny social
services to illegal immigrants.
<p>
   Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, were named as defendants in the suit, which
asks the court to revoke the agreement and pay the group's
attorneys fees.
<p>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Ana Cobian declined to comment on
the suit, saying officials had not yet seen it.
<p>
   ``What I can say is that the exercise of the attorney general's
parole authority is clearly within the broad delegation of
authority in the Constitution and the statutes of the United
States,'' Cobian said.
<p>
   After U.S. and Cuban officials signed the accord, the number of
Cubans fleeing their homeland by boats and rafts decreased to a
trickle. The Coast Guard plucked only three Cubans from waters off
the cost of Florida this month, Petty Officer Mark Mackowiak said
Wednesday.
<p>
   By the time the agreement was reached, more than 35,000 Cubans
had been picked up by Coast Guard cutters, an average of nearly
1,000 a day.
<p>
   After negotiations with Cuban officials in New York, the United
States agreed to admit a minimum of 20,000 Cubans a year, excluding
immediate relatives of Cuban exiles who are U.S. citizens. Before
the agreement, the 20,000 figure was an upper limit instead of a
minimum.
<p>
   An additional 4,000 to 6,000 Cubans who were on the visa waiting
list at the time were allowed to enter the United States.
<p>
   The agreement also expanded the government's ability to
``parole'' or to admit aliens into the country on humanitarian
grounds.
<p>
   At the time, American officials said the thousands of Cuban
refugees housed at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba
would have a choice of remaining there, moving on to a shelter
elsewhere in the Caribbean or returning to Cuba proper.
<p>
   Resettlement in the United States was ruled out. However, the
administration is now considering a plan that would allow U.S.
entry to up to 8,000 of the 32,000 Cubans given sanctuary at
Guantanamo and at U.S. military facilities in the Panama Canal
Zone.

One Woman Struggles Against Biological Clock for Normal Life
With FEATURE-US-Genetic Counselors
By A.J. HOSTETLER
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA (AP)  &MD;  When Susan Caldwell decided to learn if she
carried the gene for Huntington's disease, she also bought a house
and got a dog.
<p>
   She named the dog Lucky, not so much to express her optimism
over the testing, but as a ``hope for the future.''
<p>
   Susan, a 27-year-old software programmer, is one of almost two
dozen people who have undergone genetic testing at the Georgia
Mental Health Institute for Huntington's, which causes the
deterioration of the brain's neurons and is one of the few
genetically linked diseases receptive to a predictive test.
<p>
   But while the test has about 98 percent accuracy, she refuses to
let her positive diagnosis dictate her life.
<p>
   ``I'm not resigned to it,'' Susan says. ``It's frightening. But
I'm very aware that a lot of things before then could determine my
fate.''
<p>
   Now, she grabs whatever control she can over her health. She
doesn't smoke, and she rarely drinks  &MD;  ``I can't spare the
neurons,'' she jokes.
<p>
   But her ultimate act of gaining control was the decision to find
out if she carried the renegade Huntington's gene, which derails
the mental and physical functions of its victims  &MD;  and previously
claimed the lives of her uncle and maternal grandfather.
<p>
   Susan never knew the grandfather, who died of Huntington's at
age 54. Apparently, the family didn't then understand the
implications of the illness. It took her uncle's mind and then his
life, also at age 54, before Susan's mother realized the same
disease could strike her family.
<p>
   In her early 20s, Susan watched her mother fight what appeared
to be symptoms of early Huntington's  &MD;  the odd, puppet-like
movements, the behavior changes.
<p>
   The discovery of a tumor in her mother's brain at first gave
Susan a weird sense of relief, but a visit after its removal in
November 1991 left her in no doubt. Her mother had Huntington's;
Susan, too, was at risk.
<p>
   ``I was struggling with the knowledge that she had the disease,
and the knowledge of the 50 percent possibility that I was at
risk,'' she recalls.
<p>
   After her mother's official diagnosis in July 1992, Susan
learned of a test that could tell her if she were likely to develop
Huntington's. She contacted genetic counselor Randi Jones at the
Georgia Mental Health Institute, but couldn't bring herself to
follow through.
<p>
   ``It was `life and death' for awhile, then I'd have to drop
it,'' she says. ``As much as I thought I wanted to know, I had to
break from it.'' She would schedule appointments with Jones, only
to cancel them.
<p>
   Susan confronted her own mortality. At first, she considered
moving out West and living a ``no roots'' life. She gave up her
apartment, packed most of her belongings and cut off many of her
friends.
<p>
   ``I just had this overwhelming fear of missing life,'' she says.
<p>
   But over a six-month period, something changed. She felt a need
to commit to the future, to her future.
<p>
   In January 1993, after searching for a new apartment, the
self-described ``nest-builder'' bought a townhouse in suburban
Atlanta, complete with a 30-year mortgage. She planted flowers and
grass, taking satisfaction from digging in the earth and watching
seeds take root.
<p>
   Finally, she decided she was ready for the testing.
<p>
   ``I had to know, no matter what the test results were,'' she
says.
<p>
   But then came another delay. In March 1993, researchers
announced a breakthrough  &MD;  they had found the Huntington's gene. A
new test  &MD;  one that ould predict with almost certainty  &MD;  would be
available soon in Atlanta.
<p>
   Susan waited another nine months, but the time simply
strengthened her decision.
<p>
   Before she was allowed to undergo the necessary blood tests in
February of this year, she had been required to participate in a
process called genetic counseling, which involves helping patients
decide whether they want to be tested and then how to cope with the
result.
<p>
   For Huntington's, it also involves extensive neurological and
psychological tests, to see if the patient has any symptoms of the
disease.
<p>
   Five weeks after giving two blood samples, on March 17, Susan
learned her results. She ``cried some,'' she says, but felt relief
that her worst fear  &MD;  an inconclusive result  &MD;  didn't come true.
<p>
   ``I don't think the decision to test is right for everyone,''
she says. ``But I had to have an answer. I'm a real black-and-white
kind of person.''
<p>
   The deterioration generally starts when the sufferer is in his
or her 40s and, so far, Susan doesn't have any symptoms. She
sometimes worries and suffers insomnia, but denies being obsessed.
<p>
   ``If I do something clumsy, I'll think about it. ... It'll
always be there,'' she says of knowing she has the gene.
<p>
   But the waiting is over. Susan doesn't count her days, and she
looks forward to her future. She now dates, and worries about her
yardwork and plants.
<p>
   ``Life is playing with my dog, cutting my grass, talking with my
neighbors,'' she says. ``I'm really lucky. I wouldn't ask for the
experience, but I've been fortunate. Life doesn't stop.''

Japanese-Controlled Group Gives More Than It Gets On Rock Center
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  A Japanese-controlled group that owns
Rockefeller Center may default on their mortgage payments since its
rental income is so low, documents show.
<p>
   Since 1989, when Mitsubishi Estate first bought a 51 percent
chunk of the landmark property, expenses  &MD;  including mortgage
payments  &MD;  have exceeded revenue for the property by roughly dlrs
300 million.
<p>
   Mitsubishi, which now owns 80 percent of the Center, and the
Rockefeller family, which owns 20 percent, have had to subsidize
the shortfall with their own money.
<p>
   ``These conditions raise substantial concern about the
borrower's ability to continue,'' according to a quarterly filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the company that
holds the mortgage, known as Rockefeller Center Properties Inc.
<p>
   A cash flow shortfall has been in existence since the property
went public in 1985, and was projected to continue well into the
1990s at the time Mitsubishi bought in, according to Stephanie
Young, a spokeswoman for the mortgage-holder.
<p>
   But the SEC filing indicates concern by the mortgage holder that
Mitsubishi is on the verge of withdrawing its subsidy, which could
lead it to default on the property. If that were to happen, the
mortgage holder would gain control of the property and could resell
it.
<p>
   If Mitsubishi chose not to default, it could also try to
renegotiate the mortgage to reduce the principal amount it owes.
<p>
   The Rockefeller Group, which represents Mitsubishi and the
remaining interest owned by the Rockefeller family, said Wednesday
that it ``remains committed to maintaining Rockefeller Center as
the premier commercial property in the world. ... The borrower is
current on its commitments.''
<p>
   Mitsubishi's initial purchase of a 51 percent stake in the
mid-Manhattan complex of 19 buildings  &MD;  home to the NBC television
network, Time-Life, The Associated Press, Radio City Music Hall,
the Rainbow Room and a world-famous skating rink  &MD;  was one of the
most prominent Japanese investments ever in the United States.
<p>
   Noting that the dlrs 1.4 billion paid to the Rockefeller family
is more than Rockefeller Center's current estimated value of
between dlrs 900 million and dlrs 1.15 billion, The New York Times
said the sale to the Japanese ``may have been one of the best-timed
real estate transactions in all of history.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  &MD;  The United States will not ignore
human rights abuses for the sake of increased trade, President
Clinton said in a call ``to break down chains of repression''
throughout Asia.
<p>
   On a visit Wednesday to this nation notorious for human rights
violations, Clinton discussed the issue at length with President
Suharto and urged him to make more progress, officials said.
<p>
   Clinton welcomed Suharto's assurances that he would not punish
students who occupied the U.S. Embassy to demand independence for
East Timor, the former Portuguese colony seized in 1975.
<p>
   The Indonesian leader said his government is dealing fairly with
East Timor, a senior administration official said.
<p>
   Indonesia was Clinton's last stop in three weeks of grueling
travel that began with a journey to the Middle East and then picked
up steam with a frenetic campaign tour in the United States before
he set out to the Far East last week.
<p>
   From Jakarta, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, flew to Hawaii for
a few days rest before returning to Washington to confront the
bitter realities of the Republican election landslide.
<p>
   Hoping to make the best of a bad situation, the Democratic
president plans to meet next week with Republican leaders who will
run both houses of Congress for the first time in four decades.
<p>
   In a speech to U.S. business leaders here, Clinton reached out
to his opposition, urging Republicans to join with Democrats to
pass a global trade agreement to slash tariffs. Congress is
returning this month in a lame-duck session to vote on the accord,
known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
<p>
   In advance of Clinton's speech, Sen. Jesse Helms, the incoming
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, suggested he might
hinder Clinton's foreign policy initiatives unless the president
agreed to postpone the GATT vote until early next year, when the
Republicans are in charge.
<p>
   Asia is the fastest growing economic region of the world and the
market for one-third of all American exports. Clinton said U.S.
economic strategy must be revised to make Indonesia, Thailand,
China, India and others a larger part of the equation.
<p>
   ``We remain convinced that strengthening the ties of trade among
nations can help to break down chains of repression, that as
societies become more open economically, they also become more open
politically,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   Addressing criticism of his administration, Clinton said, ``We
reject the notion that increasing economic ties in trade and
partnerships undermine our human rights agenda.''
<p>
   Clinton said the United States plays a major role in the
struggle for democracy and freedom around the world, adding, ``We
cannot turn away from that cause and we will not.''
<p>
   Indonesia is the subject of both praise and criticism from the
United States.
<p>
   Under Suharto's 27-year autocratic rule, Indonesia stands
accused of military brutality, persecution of dissidents,
violations of labor rights and press censorship. Human rights
groups say abuses are particularly harsh in East Timor.
<p>
   On the other hand, Indonesia, with 185 million inhabitants, is
an unmistakable economic success story, boasting one of the best
growth rates in the developing world  &MD;  six percent a year or better
since the early 1970s.

Wedding Plans Altered After Australia Refuses Iroquois Passport
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP)  &MD;  Getting hitched had a hitch Tammy Rahr
didn't count on. She says the Australian government rejected her
Iroquois Indian passport the week before she was to fly there to
get married.
<p>
   Rahr, a beadwork artist who works as an educator for the state
Museum of Indian Arts and Culture here, had planned to go to
Australia Nov. 11 to marry fellow artist Lawrence Nilsen, an
Australian aborigine.
<p>
   She said she was told Nov. 2 that the Australian Consulate in
New York City had granted her visa but rejected her passport.
<p>
   ``It's an outrage,'' she said Wednesday.
<p>
   She said she scrambled until Nov. 8 trying to get the
Australians to change their minds and sought help from U.S. Rep.
Bill Richardson of New Mexico.
<p>
   When she began planning her trip in July, she said,
Haudenosaunee tribal officials assured her there should be no
passport problem. The Haudenosaunee are a confederacy of six tribes
also known as the Iroquois. Tribal officials said their passport
had been accepted previously by Australia.
<p>
   The tribe also advised against getting a backup U.S. passport
``because that would damage our diplomatic relationship,'' she
said.
<p>
   ``This is something that we (the Iroquois) have been working on
since the 1970s,'' she said. ``It's not a new thing.''
<p>
   Iroquois passports look like U.S. passports but are written in
Onondaga, an Iroquois language, as well as English.
<p>
   Rahr said she believes the Australian government may have
changed its position on American Indian passports because honoring
them eventually could have implications for political issues
regarding Australian aborigines.
<p>
   She could get a U.S. passport if she wanted one, she said, but
``that would mean I am not willing to stand up and say who I am,
and I am Iroquois first.''
<p>
   As for the wedding, Nilsen is flying into Albuquerque on Dec. 8
and the couple will be married Dec. 24.

Governor Says Colony Will Prosper Under China

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  &MD;  Hong Kong's governor won't make any
promises about the British colony's prosperity once it reverts to
Chinese control in mid-1997.
<p>
   ``My assurances last until midnight of the 30th of June, 1997.
You'll want to ask someone else after that,'' Gov. Chris Patten
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Patten said he is optimistic about Hong Kong's economic future
and believes China will live up to the spirit of the Joint
Declaration Britain and China signed in 1991.
<p>
   But the closer the changeover comes, the less Patten said he is
able to calm the concerns of the city's business community.
<p>
   The majority of Hong Kong's 6 million residents don't have the
option of leaving the country before the changeover. They are
counting on continuing negotiations between China and Britain to
maintain their way of life, Patten said.
<p>
   ``The reassurance in their bottom drawers isn't a passport, but
the Joint Declaration,'' said Patten.
<p>
   China has agreed to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling capitalist
system and separate political institutions for 50 years. But the
Chinese have threatened to dismantle political reforms Patten
introduced to broaden representative democracy.
<p>
   Patten spoke Wednesday to a combined audience from the
Commonwealth Club of California, the Hong Kong Association of
Northern California and the World Affairs Council of Northern
California.
<p>
   The San Francisco speech was the second of three on his first
West Coast visit to the United States since being appointed
governor of Hong Kong two years ago. Patten spoke first in Los
Angeles and travels next to Seattle.

Baseline Sluggers Pierce, Davenport Win at Slims
EDs: UPDATES with Pierce-Coetzer match
By BOB GREENE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Two baseline sluggers, fifth-seeded Mary Pierce
and No. 7 Lindsay Davenport, powered their way into the
quarterfinals of the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships on
Wednesday.
<p>
   Davenport had too much firepower for Anke Huber, defeating the
German 6-2, 6-3. Pierce overcame her own mistakes in time to oust
South African Amanda Coetzer 5-7, 6-3, 6-3.
<p>
   The first round of the dlrs 3.5 million season-ending tournament
was completed Wednesday night when third-seeded Conchita Martinez
took on Natalia Zvereva of Belarus.
<p>
   With Martina Navratilova into her first day of retirement, the
power game replaced the spins, placements and angles that she had
used in winning a record 167 towere
content to stand at the baseline and try to belt shots past each
other.
<p>
   There was no disguising tactics: hit hard, harder and hardest.
The only diversion was an occasional moon ball to allow the players
to get back into position for another barrage of heavy
groundstrokes.
<p>
   The Pierce-Coetzer battle had a bit more variety, but just a
little. Pierce has some of the hardest groundstrokes in women's
tennis.
<p>
   But where Davenport and Huber stayed back, Pierce and Coetzer
roamed the court, using a short ball to come to the net.
<p>
   Pierce, who has reached five finals in 1994 but hasn't yet won,
raced to a 5-2 first-set lead. But Coetzer captured the next five
games to win the opening set, then had a break point against Pierce
in the first game of the second set.
<p>
   Pierce held service, broke Coetzer, then held again for a 3-0
advantage. Although she captured the second set, Pierce sprayed
shots all over the Garden, most of them landing in the court.
<p>
   In the third game of the final set, Pierce was given a warning
for taking too much time between points. She responded by breaking
Coetzer for a 2-1 lead, an advantage she never lost as she moved
into a quarterfinal meeting against top-seeded Steffi Graf.
<p>
   Davenport will next take on fourth-seeded Jana Novotna.
<p>
   While Davenport is the higher ranked of the two, and thus was
seeded in this elite 16-player field, Huber has been one of the
hottest players on the tour the last two months. She beat Pierce in
finals at Philadelphia and Filderstadt, Germany.
<p>
   Huber earned dlrs 14,000 for the first-round loss, pushing her
1994 earnings to nearly dlrs 450,000.

Webber Finally Re-Signs with Golden State Warriors
By ROB GLOSTER
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP)  &MD;  Chris Webber, last year's rookie of the
year who has yet to play this season, re-signed Wednesday night
with the Golden State Warriors.
<p>
   The signing was announced by the team and ends a bitter contract
dispute that had led coach Don Nelson to say he would resign if
such a move would facilitate signing Webber.
<p>
   Webber, whose agents were investigating possible trades during
the stalemate, was angered at Nelson for making such a suggestion.
<p>
   The 6-foot-10 (2.08-meter) forward has missed the team's first
six games of this season. He is expected to join the team Friday or
Saturday. The Warriors are 5-1 without Webber.
<p>
   No terms of the agreement were announced.
<p>
   Webber's agents had said the holdup in his signing was Webber's
desire for an early escape clause in any long-term contract. It was
unclear whether the contract signed Wednesday included such a
clause.
<p>
   Webber exercised his option to terminate his 15-year, dlrs 74
million contract in the offseason and became a free agent. That
touched off speculation surrounding his future with Golden State.
<p>
   By signing Webber, the Warriors now would be able to trade him.
They could not have traded Webber, or even negotiated with other
teams about a trade, while he reamined an unsigned free agent.
<p>
   The Warriors made room for Webber on their 12-man active roster
by requesting waivers on forward Rod Higgins. The Warriors also
said they expect to rehire Higgins as an assistant coach later this
week if he clears waivers.

Lower Tensions But No Cease-Fire at North-South Soccer Showdown
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)  &MD;  The sign behind the goal said
it all: ``No ceasefire at Windsor Park.''
<p>
   Despite back-to-back truces since September from the Irish
Republican Army and pro-British paramilitary groups, Belfast's
international soccer stadium on Wednesday night proved a menacing
pit for the few hundred Irish fans who watched their team trounce
the home Northern Ireland side 4-0.
<p>
   Cowering in the southwest end of the stadium under the watchful
eye of about 50 policemen, most of the Catholic visitors from the
south did what comes naturally when faced with more than 10,000
frustrated northern Protestants: Cheer in silence.
<p>
   The hard-line anti-Irish fans who turn up at Northern Ireland
matches whenever the team plays the Republic of Ireland vented
their frustrations on Dublin visitors, a few of whom were unwise
enough to stand and shout after each of their side's four goals.
<p>
   Only the intervention of policemen prevented violence from
northern spectators, many of them drunk from pre-game celebrations.
Police bluntly told those shouting anti-Catholic abuse at Irish
fans to shut up or face arrest, but the one-way trade of taunts and
insults continued.
<p>
   Forward John Aldridge and midfielder Roy Keane swept past
confused Northern Ireland defenders for two goals in the first 11
minutes, punishing goalkeeper Paul Kee and stunning the 10,500
northern fans in the sold-out stadium.
<p>
   As halftime approached Ireland midfielder John Sheridan took a
flick pass from striker Niall Quinn, skipped past a sliding Morrow
and drove the ball past Kee for a third score. In the 53rd minute,
midfielder Andy Townsend sprinted through the middle of another
broken Northern Ireland defense to score the final goal.
<p>
   The win was Ireland's first in Belfast in five tries, and
Northern Ireland's worst home defeat in 15 years. It put Ireland
securely alongside Portugal atop Group 6 in the early running for
the 1996 European Cup, while Northern Ireland fell to 2-2 in the
division.
<p>
   Wednesday's atmosphere seemed idyllic in comparison with the
previous Ireland-Northern Ireland contest at Windsor Park, a 1-1
tie in November 1993 that secured the Republic's berth in the World
Cup.
<p>
   That game came in the immediate aftermath of 23 killings by the
IRA and pro-British ``loyalists,'' one of the worst spasms of
violence ever experienced in Northern Ireland. The Irish side had
threatened to boycott Belfast, fearful of attacks on its fans or
players. Hundreds of police provided security for that game and
blocked off every approach road with armored cars.
<p>
   Earlier this year, the Irish Republican Army declared a
cease-fire in its war to reunite the north with Ireland so that
negotiations could progress. Protestant groups loyal to Britain and
its occupation of the north followed suit.
<p>
   Some Protestants on Wednesday extended the hand of friendship to
southern visitors  &MD;  before the game, anyway.
<p>
   Belfast Lord Mayor Hugh Smyth invited the Irish team for tea at
city hall, an unprecedented gesture.
<p>
   Irish manager Jack Charlton turned down the offer because he
wanted his players to focus on the game, and to stay in Northern
Ireland as short a time as possible. After winning they drove
straight back to Dublin 100 miles (160 kms) away.
<p>
   Elsewhere, 16 southerners invited by a Northern Ireland soccer
supporters club enjoyed midday pints of beer in the hard-line
Protestant Shankill district.
<p>
   ``Obviously we were more nervous about coming up last time,''
said Declan Cummins, an Irish fan from Dublin, who traveled to both
Belfast matches to reunite with Protestant fans he met at an
Ireland-Northern Ireland match in Dublin two years ago. ``This time
Belfast is a less threatening place.''
    &MD;  &MD;  &MD;  &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups: &QL; 
<p>
   Northern Ireland &MD; Paul Kee, Gary Fleming, Nigel Worthington,
Gerry Taggart, Stephen Morrow, Michael O'Neill (Darren Patterson,

Dowie, Phillip Gray, Michael Hughes.

Irish Government, A Main Peace Process Player, Falls Apart
EDS: PMS
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP)  &MD;  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds'
government, a main player in the Northern Ireland peace process,
unraveled Wednesday night in an unrelated row on a judicial post.
<p>
   Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring, head of the Labor Party,
announced the immediate resignation of himself and his party's six
other ministers in Reynolds' coalition Cabinet.
<p>
   Spring, who held the post of Foreign Minister together with the
deputy premiership in the Cabinet, told the Dail, the lower house
of Parliament, he was confident the Northern Ireland peace process
could withstand the political crisis.
<p>
   Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political ally, said it
regretted the coalition breakup. But Sinn Fein vice president Pat
Doherty said: ``We will continue to work with all parties'' toward
peace.
<p>
   Announcing Labor's departure, Spring told the Dail: ``Neither I
nor any of my colleagues can vote confidence in this government.''
<p>
   The withdrawal of the junior partner from the 22-month-old
Fianna Fail-Labor Party coalition leaves Reynolds facing the
prospect of defeat in a Dail vote expected Thursday night on a
confidence motion.
<p>
   What happens then is uncertain. Reynolds could ask President
Mary Robinson to dissolve the Dail and order a national election.
<p>
   But Mrs. Robinson could refuse a dissolution, allowing
opposition parties time to try to put together a new coalition.
<p>
   A third possibility is that Fianna Fail ministers could replace
Reynolds with somebody who would be acceptable as prime minister to
Spring. News reports spoke of Finance Minister Bertie Ahern as a
possible replacement.
<p>
   British Prime Minister John Major, Reynolds' partner in the Dec.
15 Northern Ireland peace initiative, made no public comment on the
Irish government crisis.
<p>
   But the liberal London newspaper The Guardian quoted an unnamed
senior British ministerial source as saying Reynolds was the man
best placed to deliver Sinn Fein to the peace process. That was
because he is the political leader either side of the border most
trusted by the IRA's ally, the source was quoted as saying.
<p>
   The joint declaration announced by Reynolds and Major Dec. 15
offered Sinn Fein a place at round-table talks on the future of
Northern Ireland in exchange for an end to the IRA's bomb and
bullet war against British rule in the province.
<p>
   The IRA responded by declaring an open-ended cease-fire on Aug.
31. Protestant ``loyalist'' paramilitaries followed suit, declaring
a cease-fire Oct. 13.
<p>
   Exploratory talks between British officials and Sinn Fein are
scheduled to start sometime before Christmas.
<p>
   The government crisis stems from the appointment of Harry
Whelehan, a former attorney general, as president of the High
Court. Whelehan has been accused of taking no action for seven
months in the case of a Catholic priest wanted for child sexual
abuse in Northern Ireland.

No. 16 Michigan 94, Poland 80

<p>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP)  &MD;  Jimmy King scored 22 points and the No.
16 Wolverines defeated the Polish National Team 94-80 in an
exhibition Wednesday night.
<p>
   Jerod Ward, the only freshman to start, had 16 points and a
game-high seven rebounds for Michigan. But all five freshmen on the
squad scored for the Wolverines, who led all the way.
<p>
   ``I saw some sparks from all our new kids,'' Michigan coach
Steve Fisher said. ``We're going to get better.''
<p>
   Adam Wojcik led Poland with 19 points. Bartimiej Tomaszewski and
Tomasz Jankowski each scored 16 for the touring Polish team which
was scheduled to play another exhibition Thursday night at Michigan
State.
<p>
   Poland made 49 percent of its shots, but was hurt by a scoring
drought of five minutes, 30 seconds early in the game. Michigan
scored 16 unanswered points during Poland's cold spell to take a
39-26 lead.
<p>
   The Wolverines had their largest lead at 89-70 with 3:19 left in
the game. Tomaszewski scored four of Poland's next five baskets,
cutting the deficit to 91-80 with 55 seconds remaining. A 3-pointer
by Michigan's Dugan Fife closed out the scoring.

Judge Expresses Regret for Granting Hyped TV Interview
Eds: UPDATES with description of advertisement
By LINDA DEUTSCH
AP Special Correspondent
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  The judge in the O.J. Simpson trial expressed
regret Wednesday for granting a heavily hyped, five-part television
interview.
<p>
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito was questioning an alternate
juror prospect who saw a full-page newspaper ad on his KCBS
television station interview.
<p>
   ``I kind of flipped the page quickly,'' said the woman, who is
under orders from Ito to avoid media coverage of the case.
<p>
   ``So did I,'' the judge responded. ``If I had known that they
were going to do that, I wouldn't have done that'' interview.
<p>
   The woman passed the in-depth phase of questioning as the search
for 15 alternate jurors continued.
<p>
   Ito's interview, which began airing Sunday, has puzzled legal
observers. Although it wasn't unethical, they said, it was unusual
for a judge to grant such an interview, particularly one who has
relentlessly criticized media coverage of the case.
<p>
   A full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times promised such highlights
as: ``Living in the spotlight of the trial of the century'' and
``What does the future hold? Will the pressures of a big trial
change his career?''
<p>
   Simpson, a former football great, television sports commentator
and movie star, has been charged with murder in the June 12
slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her
friend Ronald Goldman.
<p>
   The U.S. media has covered the case intently and segments of the
public have been kept rapt as it unfolded.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Simpson's attorney Robert Shapiro said Ito's wife,
police Capt. Peggy York, agreed to appear at a hearing to explore
whether she once helped investigate a detective who found a bloody
glove on Simpson's estate.
<p>
   Shapiro informed Ito that the hearing, before a different judge,
was scheduled for Monday. Shapiro didn't elaborate in court but
told reporters outside the courtroom: ``There may be some conflict
of interest.''
<p>
   York may have been involved in an investigation of detective
Mark Fuhrman, Shapiro said, adding, ``The emphasis is on the word
`may.'''
<p>
   The Simpson defense has accused Fuhrman of racism. Shapiro said
the defense isn't attempting to disqualify Ito from the case, but
will explore ``how much we'll be able to ask Detective Fuhrman''
when he testifies at the trial.
<p>
   Also, ``If there's a possibility she could be a witness, we want
to know those things before trial, so no one will be embarrassed,''
Shapiro said.
<p>
   Fuhrman, who is white, was portrayed by defense lawyers as a
racist who might have planted the glove to implicate Simpson, who
is black.
<p>
   This summer, Ito rejected a defense bid to examine Fuhrman's
personnel and military records.
<p>
   Four of six people questioned Wednesday were kept, bringing the
number of people in the pool of possible alternate jurors to 22.
The alternates will replace any jurors drop out during the trial.

Dollar Slips, Stocks Rebound

<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo trading Thursday morning, while stock prices rebounded
slightly.
<p>
   The dollar was changing hands at 98.07 yen at late morning after
opening at 98.25 yen, down 0.37 yen from Wednesday's close. It had
closed overnight in New York at 98.25 yen.
<p>
   The dollar remained weaker following profit-taking from a surge
in New York on the heels of a 0.75-percentage point increase in a
key interest rate Tuesday, said Satoshi Tanase, a Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank dealer.
<p>
   But most Japanese players were sitting on the sidelines ahead of
the release Friday of U.S. trade figures for September, Tanase
said.
<p>
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
40.61 points, or 0.21 percent, to end the morning session at
19,347.27. On Wednesday, the average shed 85.02 points, or 0.44
percent, closing at 19,306.66.
<p>
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 1.62 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,527.12. The TOPIX
closed at 1,525.50 on Wednesday, down 3.14 points, or 0.21 percent.
<p>
   Prices rose only slightly in the absence of strong buying
incentives, traders said.
<p>
   At 11:05 a.m. (0205 GMT), benchmark No. 164 10-year Japanese
government bonds stood at 96.00 yen, up 0.06 yen from Wednesday's
finish. Their yield fell by 0.010 percentage point to 4.730
percent.

Communists Maintain Lead in Nepal Polls

<TEXT>
<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance was doing better
than expected in Nepal's parliamentary elections, surprising
pandits, as more than one-fourth of votes were counted Thursday.
<p>
   Of the 63 results announced so far, the alliance bagged 38 and
governing Nepali Congress 16 seats in 205-member House of
Representatives.
<p>
   A pro-monarchy party won seven seats independents won the
remaining two.
<p>
   The Communists made a clean sweep of all the seven seats in
capital, Katmandu.
<p>
   Trends from 76 other constituencies showed the Communist
alliance of four parties were leading in 36 places and the Congress
25. Smaller political groups are ahead in other places, a top
election commission official said..
<p>
   The left parties promise of land reforms and breaking up large
holdings appears to have gone well with the poor people of this
mountainous country. Most of Nepal's 20 million people survive on
agriculture.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala won both his seats,
defeating communist rivals by a margin of less than 10,000 votes.
<p>
   The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) chairman,
Manmohan Adhikari, won from the capital.
<p>
   ``It's a positive trend. We are hopeful that we will have a
comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar, secretary-general of the
party.
<p>
   Final results of elections would not be declared until a week
because the election commission has ordered a repoll in 64 polling
stations in 33 constituencies, where Tuesday's voting was marred by
violence.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
to become the figurehead in Nepal's new democracy.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months ahead of
schedule.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress is fighting for all the 205 seats as against
196 by communists.
<p>
   Prime Minister Koirala's government was discredited because of
the lack of performance in the economic field and intra-party
dissension.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  &MD;  Hong Kong's governor won't make any
promises about the British colony's prosperity once it reverts to
Chinese control in mid-1997.
<p>
   ``My assurances last until midnight of the 30th of June, 1997.
You'll want to ask someone else after that,'' Gov. Chris Patten
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Patten said he is optimistic about Hong Kong's economic future
and believes China will live up to the spirit of the Joint
Declaration Britain and China signed in 1984.
<p>
   But the closer the changeover comes, the less Patten said he is
able to calm the concerns of the city's business community.
<p>
   The majority of Hong Kong's 6 million residents don't have the
option of leaving the country before the changeover. They are
counting on continuing negotiations between China and Britain to
maintain their way of life, Patten said.
<p>
   ``The reassurance in their bottom drawers isn't a passport, but
the Joint Declaration,'' said Patten.
<p>
   China has agreed to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling capitalist
system and separate political institutions for 50 years. But the
Chinese have threatened to dismantle political reforms Patten
introduced to broaden representative democracy.
<p>
   Patten spoke Wednesday to a combined audience from the
Commonwealth Club of California, the Hong Kong Association of
Northern California and the World Affairs Council of Northern
California.
<p>
   The San Francisco speech was the second of three on his first
West Coast visit to the United States since being appointed
governor of Hong Kong two years ago. Patten spoke first in Los
Angeles and travels next to Seattle.

Woman Testifies She Gave Fleiss Dlrs 600 For Arranging Meeting

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES (AP)  &MD;  A woman purportedly working as a prostitute
for a reputed Hollywood madam testified Wednesday that Heidi Fleiss
sent her to a Beverly Hills hotel suite to perform sex for dlrs
1,500.
<p>
   Samantha Burdette, appearing under immunity as a prosecution
witness, said she was sent by Fleiss to meet Sammy Lee, an
undercover policeman posing as a wealthy businessman.
<p>
   ``Heidi asked me if I wanted to go to'' the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, Burdette testified. ``She asked me if I wanted to meet a guy
there. She said I would meet him and he would give me dlrs 1,500.''
<p>
   Burdette said Fleiss' share was 40 percent, according to their
agreement.
<p>
   Under cross-examination by Fleiss' attorney, Donald Marks,
Burdette said she did not know she was being secretly recorded in
the hotel room and found Lee oddly insistent about paying her. Lee
has said police operatives arranged to call his hotel room as soon
as Burdette removed her clothes.
<p>
   Prosecutors say Fleiss, 28, ran a sophisticated operation
catering to the rich and famous. Her lawyers say she was entrapped
by police. Fleiss faces 11 years in prison if convicted on the
pandering and narcotics charges.
<p>
   Several of Fleiss' alleged prostitutes have revealed the names
of their clients during secret grand jury hearings.
<p>
   Earlier Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne agreed
with an objection raised by a prosecutor Tuesday that the clients'
names were irrelevant in the pandering trial.
<p>
   Lawyers wanted to bring the clients into the case to show that
police knew who they were and did not charge them, and selectively
prosecuted Fleiss.

Plague Reports Fabricated, Official Says
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Reports in foreign media saying there had been an
outbreak of the plague in China were a ``fabrication,'' although
seven cases of the disease have been detected since June, an
official report said Thursday.
<p>
   Xinhua News Agency, quoting an unnamed official in the Ministry
of Public Health, said that the disease was immediately brought
under control after the seven cases were detected in remote regions
of Tibet and Qinghai Province, in southwestern China.
<p>
   The report said that China had experienced an average of 10
cases of the plague a year since the 1960s, having brought the
disease under control in 1955.
<p>
   ``Saying that the plague has spread to 216 cities'' is ``sheer
fabrication,'' the official was quoted as saying.
<p>
   South Korea ordered sanitation checks of passengers and
fumigation of ships and planes arriving from China following
unconfirmed reports in the local media that there had been an
outbreak of the disease.
<p>
   The plague reports in the Korean-language press cited China's
official health newspaper, Jiankang Bao, but a Jiankang Bao report
Nov. 2 merely warned about the possibility of a plague outbreak.
<p>
   A plague epidemic killed more than 60 people in India in
September.

92-71 lead. Boston's lead was 19 to 31 points thereafter.

   Dino Radja added 28 points and 15 rebounds.
<p>
   Seattle was led by Detlef Schrempf with 19 points. &QL;

third quarter, leading Philadelphia to only its second victory in
eight games.
<p>
   Malone led the 76ers on a 16-4 spurt late in the third quarter

run, and Dana Barros' 35-foot jumper at the buzzer made it 88-75
entering the final period.

never trailed.
<p>
   Glen Rice led depleted Miami (1-5) with 24 points, and John
Salley had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Injuries denied the Heat the
use of forwards Kevin Willis and Billy Owens, and starting center
Matt Geiger. &QL;

<p>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP)  &MD;  A Communist alliance was doing better
than expected in Nepal's parliamentary elections, surprising
pundits, as more than one-fourth of votes were counted Thursday.
<p>
   Of the 63 results announced so far, the alliance bagged 38 and
governing Nepali Congress 16 seats in 205-member House of
Representatives.
<p>
   A pro-monarchy party won seven seats independents won the
remaining two.
<p>
   The Communists made a clean sweep of all the seven seats in
capital, Katmandu.
<p>
   Trends from 76 other constituencies showed the Communist
alliance of four parties were leading in 36 places and the Congress
25. Smaller political groups are ahead in other places, a top
election commission official said..
<p>
   The left parties promise of land reforms and breaking up large
holdings appears to have gone well with the poor people of this
mountainous country. Most of Nepal's 20 million people survive on
agriculture.
<p>
   Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala won both his seats,
defeating communist rivals by a margin of less than 10,000 votes.
<p>
   The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) chairman,
Manmohan Adhikari, won from the capital.
<p>
   ``It's a positive trend. We are hopeful that we will have a
comfortable majority,'' said Madhav Kumar, secretary-general of the
party.
<p>
   Final results of elections would not be declared until a week
because the election commission has ordered a repoll in 64 polling
stations in 33 constituencies, where Tuesday's voting was marred by
violence.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress won a majority in the 1991 elections, the
first in 31 years after King Birendra relinquished absolute power
to become the figurehead in Nepal's new democracy.
<p>
   But a rebellion by 36 governing party lawmakers pulled down
Koirala's government and forced elections 18 months ahead of
schedule.
<p>
   The Nepali Congress is fighting for all the 205 seats as against
196 by communists.
<p>
   Prime Minister Koirala's government was discredited because of
the lack of performance in the economic field and intra-party
dissension.

Ozaki Leads Money List, Hawaiian Ishii Fifth
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO (AP)  &MD;  Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki led the Japan PGA's money
list with more than 188 million yen (dlrs 1.918 million) with four
tournaments remaining this season. Hawaiian David Ishii was
currently ranked fifth on the list.
<p>
   Ozaki won six out of 18 tournaments he contested and collected
188.468 million yen (dlrs 1.923 million) this season.
<p>
   The 47-year-old Ozaki is Japan's winningest male golfer with 68
victories on the Japanese tour. Ozaki topped the money list seven
times since 1973.
<p>
   American Brian Watts was second on the money list with 128.492
million yen (dlrs 1.311 million). The 28-year-old Watts, the 1987
U.S. collegiate champion, won five tournaments this season that
included the two consecutive victories at the Bridgestone Open and
the ABC Lark Cup in October.
<p>
   Japan's Tsuneyuki Nakajima, Ozaki's archrival, was third with
106.291 million yen (dlrs 1.085 million) with three victories.
<p>
   Ishii collected 77.303 million yen (dlrs 788,806) with two
victories. Ishii earned the most money in 1987 and was third in
1988. Ishii has won the Maruman Open in August and the Suntory Open
in September for his 14th career victory in Japan.
<p>
   The 200 million yen (dlrs 2.041 million) Dunlop Phoenix Golf
Tournament started Thursday.

Stolen Dutch Master's Painting Reportedly Returned to Polish
Government
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  A Dutch Old Master painting stolen from a Polish
museum by Nazis during World War II has been bought for the Polish
government, The New York Times reported Thursday.
<p>
   Some art experts said the sale was akin to ransom.
<p>
   The 17th-century Gabriel Metsu painting, ``The Washerwoman,''
was flown to Warsaw from New York on Tuesday after payment of about
dlrs 65,000 to an anonymous collector. Two years ago the collector
consigned it to Sotheby's auction house for sale.
<p>
   The painting was bought by a Polish arts charity in New York
with money from a Polish-American businessman who's entitled to a
federal tax deduction for the contribution. Sotheby's also paid for
part of the repurchase, people familiar with the settlement told
the newspaper.
<p>
   A lawyer for Sotheby's told the Times that a confidentiality
agreement prevented her from discussing the deal. Calls by The
Associated Press to a Sotheby's spokeswoman were not returned
Wednesday night.
<p>
   ``We created precedents for the next cases of stolen artwork,
that they are not returned to the owner, but he must pay,''
Polish-born art conservator and restorer Richard P. Boncza told the
newspaper.
<p>
   After Boncza raised questions about the scheduled auction of the
painting at Sotheby's in January 1993, the auction house withdrew
the painting.
<p>
   He said he accepted the settlement as a compromise to avert a
lawsuit.
<p>
   Art investigator Willi Korte told the Times that the arrangement
verged on ransom ``if buying your own property is paying ransom  &MD; 
or somebody paying on your behalf.''
<p>
   The painting is one of several recovered recently since the war,
when thousands of treasures were looted by the Nazis and at times
by Allied forces.

Chinese Citizens Suing Government, and Sometimes Winning
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BEIJING (AP)  &MD;  Chinese increasingly are taking their complaints
against the government to the courts, and occasionally they win,
according to an official report published Thursday.
<p>
   By the end of 1993, some 27,000 lawsuits had been filed against
the government by Chinese citizens, the newspaper China Daily
reported.
<p>
   Government agencies have lost in about 20 percent of the cases,
while in another 10 percent previous verdicts were overturned and
the plaintiffs withdrew their cases, legal expert Shan Changzong
was quoted as saying.
<p>
   Most of the cases involved economic administrative decisions
about businesses or real estate, Shan said.
<p>
   Chinese generally have tended to shy away from confrontations in
court, fearing the consequences of accusing powerful government
officials of wrongdoing could be worse than putting up with
whatever injustice they may have been dealt.
<p>
   The report said the number of lawsuits filed against the
government has increased by about 30 percent a year since the an
Administrative Procedure Law went into effect four years ago.

Canadian Firm Signs Oil Exploration Deal In Vietnam
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  &MD;  Oxy Petroleum of Canada has signed a
contract to explore for oil and gas off the southern coast of
Vietnam, official newspapers said Thursday.
<p>
   The company signed a production sharing contract Wednesday with
the government-owned Vietnam Oil and Gas Corp., also known as
PetroVietnam, the state-run Vietnam News reported.
<p>
   Oxy Petroleum will take over a block formerly leased to
PetroCanada, which withdrew from the area after failing to make a
commercial discovery. The block, designated 12-W, lies 300
kilometers (180 miles) southwest of the port of Vung Tau, the Quan
Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) daily reported.
<p>
   Bernard Isautier, Oxy's executive director, and Ho Si Thoang,
chairman of PetroVietnam, signed the agreement for their companies,
it said.
<p>
   Oxy Petroleum of Canada is the 28th foreign oil company to reach
a production sharing contract with PetroVietnam. Another Canadian
firm, Dusty Mac Oil &AMP; Gas Ltd., signed an agreement earlier this
month that it expects to lead to an exploration contract with
PetroVietnam.
<p>
   Crude oil is Vietnam's most valuable export, and earned the
country dlrs 861 million in 1993.

Baseline Sluggers Pierce, Davenport Win at Slims
EDs: UPDATES with Martinez-Zvereva match, quotes
By BOB GREENE
AP Sports Writer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK (AP)  &MD;  Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez and two
young baseline sluggers captured the final three quarterfinal
berths Wednesday at the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships.
<p>
   Martinez, seeded third in this 16-player field at Madison Square
Garden, eliminated Natalia Zvereva of Belarus 2-6, 6-2, 6-4; No. 5
Mary Pierce overcame her own mistakes in time to oust South
Africa's Amanda Coetzer 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 and No. 7 Lindsay Davenport
defeated Anke Huber of Germany 6-2, 6-3.
<p>
   With Martina Navratilova into her first day of retirement, heavy
groundstrokes replaced the spins, placements and angles she had
used in winning a record 167 tournaments. At least until Martinez
and Zvereva took to the court.
<p>
   While Martinez and Zvereva spend most of their time on the
baseline, neither is adverse to coming to the net when spotting an
opening, read to pressure an opponent. Late in the match, Zvereva
repeatedly came to the net to rally from a 5-1 deficit to put the
final set back on serve at 4-5.
<p>
   It made no difference, however, as she lost her serve at love in
the 10th game to close the best match of the day.
<p>
   Where Martinez and Zvereva varied their long-range shots,
Davenport and Huber were content to stand at the baseline and try
to belt the ball past each other.
<p>
   There was no disguising tactics: just hit hard, harder and
hardest. The only diversion was an occasional moon ball to allow
the players to get back into position for another barrage of
groundstrokes.
<p>
   ``We played a couple weeks ago in Oakland and I played better
tennis,'' Davenport said. ``We play kind of similar games and the
last two times I've just been able to  &MD;  I don't know if it's
overpower  &MD;  but make her go for shots she's not comforable with and
miss a lot.''
<p>
   The Pierce-Coetzer match had a bit more variety, but just a
little. Pierce has some of the hardest groundstrokes in women's
tennis, but she and Coetzer roamed the court, using a short ball to
come to the net.
<p>
   Pierce, who has reached five finals in 1994 but hasn't yet won,
raced to a 5-2 first-set lead. Coetzer captured the next five game
to win the opening set, then had a break point against Pierce in
the first game of the second set.
<p>
   Pierce held service, broke Coetzer, then held again for a 3-0
advantage. Although she captured the second set, Pierce sprayed
shots all over the Garden, most of them landing in the court.
<p>
   ``I felt like I had chances early in the second set,'' Coetzer
said. ``I just was too anxious and I didn't take my opportunities.
... I really felt today that I was in the match.''

   In the third game of the final set, Pierce was given a warning
for taking too much time between points. She responded by breaking

Pierce upset during her surprising run to the French Open title
match.

   ``I'm very excited,'' Pierce said about the opportunity to play

players on the tour the last two months.
