 &UR; Zedillo Inaugurates New Democratic Era in Mexico (Mexico City) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEXICO CITY  &MD;  President Ernesto Zedillo inaugurated a new, more
democratic era in Mexican politics Monday with a passionate appeal to
ascendant opposition parties not to derail the country's free-market
economic revolution.
<p>
   ``For the first time in our history, we can achieve healthy,
durable economic growth, along with a full, pluralistic and harmonious
democracy,'' the president declared in his State of the Union Address.
``This is the opportunity of our generation.''
<p>
   The president's appeal reflected the unprecedented challenges to
his power as Mexico moves from an authoritarian, one-party system to
democracy.
<p>
   In midterm elections in July, the ruling party lost its control of
Congress for the first time in seven decades. While the president's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, still maintains a
commanding presence in the legislature, the Mexican leader suddenly
must fight to preserve his policies.
<p>
   Perhaps as much as his words, the ceremony surrounding the
president's most important speech of the year reflected the historic
change in Mexico.
<p>
   For the first time, an opposition politician, leftist firebrand
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, responded to the address.
<p>
   ``From today, we hope that forevermore in Mexico no power will be
subordinated to another,'' he declared.
<p>
   A ceremony that in the past featured all the pomp of a U.S.
presidential inauguration became a simple event, without the parades
and adoring crowds of business and political leaders so common before.
<p>
   ``This is like seeing one of the most momentous presidential
symbols we had for a century just deflate,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a
Mexican historian.
<p>
   The new Congress' independent spirit was so strong there almost
wasn't a State of the Union speech. The PRI balked last week at
demands by opposition parties for important posts in the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house of Congress. When the opposition went ahead
and installed the lower house Saturday, the PRI boycotted
<p>
    &MD;  and threatened a walkout Monday that would have forced the
president to postpone his speech. The party backed off Sunday night.
<p>
   Before and after Zedillo's speech Monday, the opposition warned him
that the days of a pliant Congress that rubber-stamped presidential
decisions were over.
<p>
   ``We will have parliamentary battle,'' declared a gleeful Pablo
Gomez, a deputy from the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, in a speech before the president arrived for his address.
<p>
   Later, Munoz Ledo warned Zedillo in strong terms that he would have
to share power.
<p>
   ``Knowing how to govern is also knowing how to listen, and knowing
how to correct mistakes,'' Munoz Ledo, who was elected president of
the lower house Saturday, infuriating the PRI, said in his response to
the president.
<p>
   ``Certainly, the democratic exercise of power means ruling while at
the same time obeying,'' Munoz Ledo said.
<p>
   He was greeted with more applause than the president received.
Zedillo sat stone-faced during the speech.
<p>
   Before Monday, a PRI member had always held the presidency of the
lower house and had responded to the president's speech in a virtual
paean to the leader. In the wake of the July elections, the four
opposition parties together hold a 261-seat majority in the 500-seat
Chamber of Deputies.
<p>
   Still, Zedillo and his party aren't about to be steamrollered.
Deeply divided on ideology  &MD;  the coalition ranges across the political
spectrum  &MD;  members of the opposition alliance could split. In
addition, most legislation must be approved by the Senate, the upper
house  &MD;  where the PRI continues to hold a majority.
<p>
   But the opposition has vowed to work together to challenge certain
aspects of economic policy, vowing to cut the 15 percent sales tax
that is a key source of government revenue and oppose the bailout of
troubled banks and construction companies.
<p>
   Even in his own party, the president could run into trouble
maintaining unpopular economic policies. The country's recession was
believed to be a major factor in the PRI's poor showing at the polls
in July.
<p>
   In his speech Monday night, Zedillo pledged to cooperate with the
new Congress, which was opening a three-year term.
<p>
   But he appealed to legislators not to return to populist economic
policies of the past. He maintained the country had to focus on
generating economic growth of at least 5 percent a year to create
badly needed jobs.
<p>
   ``Any new mirages, any new decisions that affect conditions for
(economic) growth ... will cause a great reverse,'' warned the
president, a Yale-educated economist.
<p>
   ``If we reached agreements to establish democracy, we must reach
accords about the foundation of our economic policy,'' declared
Zedillo, a driving force behind reforms that have produced Mexico's
most democratic elections ever.
<p>
   Zedillo noted that while Mexico's economy began to rebound last
year from the recession, many citizens complain that they still don't
feel improvement. He appealed to them to keep supporting tight-money,
balanced-budget policies that have reduced inflation and encouraged a
renewed flood of foreign investment.
<p>
   One of Zedillo's principal goals is to end the cyclical economic
crises that have plagued Mexico for the last 20 years. Most have
coincided with the political uncertainty surrounding the end of a
president's term. The next presidential election is in 2000.

   (Early) FRONTINGS FOR TUESDAY, SEPT. 2, 1997 &QL; 
<p>
    &QL; 4-col lede w/foto of
flowers in front of Buckingham Palace and sidebar: SWARDSON/PARIS--The
driver of the Mercedes sedan carrying Princess Diana was legally drunk
when he crashed in a roadway tunnel here early Sunday, killing Diana,
companion Dodi Fayed and himself, the Paris prosecutor's office said
today. The announcement did not specify his blood alcohol level, but
news agencies quoted official sources as saying it was three times the
legal limit for driving in France.  &QL;  &QL; 3-col sidebar: BALZ/London--As
thousands of mourners paid
their last respects today to Diana, Princess of Wales, officials at
Buckingham Palace prepared for a funeral on Saturday that will combine
royal ritual with less formal touches designed to reflect the
extraordinary role Diana played in the life of the nation. Palace
officials described the service, which will be held at Westminster
Abbey, as ``a unique funeral for a unique person.'' The arrangement
appeared devised to accommodate Diana's complex social position as the
divorced wife of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, as well as
her popularity among Britons and around the world. &HT;     &QL; 1-col off-led w/ foto of AIDS educator. third of five articles
in AIDS series (with apologies. this story was in sept. 1 frontings,
but, in fact, ran in sept. 2 paper. diana-mania is to blame):
Okie/Florence, S.C.--Aggressive HIV prevention efforts proposed in the
early years of the epidemic-such as widespread condom distribution,
clean-needle giveaways to drug addicts and frank sex education in
schools-triggered intense controversy and enormous political
opposition in many more conservative parts of the country. Moreover,
some public health experts argued that money spent on national media
campaigns could be more effective if focused on those at greatest risk
of contracting the virus. So three years ago, the federal government
revamped the country's prevention strategy, abandoning a single
national effort in favor of locally tailored efforts that it hoped
would be both more acceptable and more effective. &HT;     &QL; 1-col at fold: AIDS sidebar: Goldstein--differences in theme
and tone of the literature supplied by Whitman-Walker, the largest
provider of AIDS services locally, attest to the divergent
sensibilities even within the Washington area about how communities
should try to prevent the spread of the disease. Only in the District
and in Alexandria, for example, can high school students pick up
condoms at school. And only in the District do AIDS workers visit
street corners where illegal drugs are sold, offering clean needles to
intravenous drug users. In the three years since the federal
government decentralized the nation's approach to AIDS prevention, the
increased local control has created a trade-off for metropolitan
Washington: More money is being devoted to niches in the population
that are especially vulnerable to HIV, but the effectiveness of local
efforts has in some cases been questionable, according to AIDS
experts. &HT;    
<p>
    &QL; 1-col below fold: HOCKSTADER/Sarajevo, Bosnia--Hurling stones
and swinging clubs, several hundred Bosnian Serbs attacked nearly 300
heavily armed U.S. troops today in an attempt to take back control of
a key television transmitter seized last week by the Americans. The
troops fended off the assault with tear gas, neither taking nor
inflicting casualties, but they remained locked in a tense standoff
with the crowd as darkness settled over the remote hillside near the
town of Udrigova in northeastern Bosnia. &HT;     &QL; 3-col below fold w/foto of plebe and upper classman:
Argetsinger--At the U.S. Naval Academy and other military colleges,
the people responsible for indoctrinating each incoming class are
themselves relative newcomers to the rigors of military life-not
battle-hardened sergeants, but young fellow students. It's a crucial
role, especially at Annapolis, where many say the most honorable
traditions, as well as the worst habits, are passed from one class to
the next. &QL;  &QL; 3-col bottom: Allen and Hsu/Buena Vista,
Va.--Waking up a Virginia governor's race so far tranquilized by
cautious candidates with sound-alike platforms, Democrat Donald S.
Beyer Jr. charged today that Republican James S. Gilmore III sides
with extremists who would undermine public education, while Gilmore
said Beyer keeps waffling on important issues. The exchanges before a
Labor Day crowd at the foot of the Blue Ridge, where sunny pep talks
usually kick off the Old Dominion's fall campaigns, marked a change in
direction for the candidates, who have been even in the polls for
months. Each showed a steely side that is expected to be on view in a
nasty advertising war through the Nov. 4 election. &HT;     &QL; WORLD FRONT: &QL;  &QL; MOORE AND ANDERSON/Mexico City--Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo, after a weekend of intense political
clashes between his ruling party and the opposition, appealed tonight
to the first divided Congress in modern Mexican history to establish a
``mature, constructive relationship'' with his office to battle the
double scourges of drug trafficking and corruption in Mexico. But, for
the first time in the modern Mexican Congress, the president was
forced to share the podium on opening day with an opposition leader
who delivered a forceful counterpoint to the ruling PRI, which once
dominated the actions of a rubber-stamp legislative branch. &HT;     &QL;  &QL; JORDAN/Tokyo--Many Japanese believe crime here has grown
faster than the nation's ability to cope with it. Critics say Japan's
criminal laws were written for a more peaceful time and that its
police practices are better suited for a farming village than a
modern, urban society. Many people are frustrated about what they see
as outdated laws that are too forgiving of criminals, such as the
15-year statute of limitations on murder and the laws that allow
murderers under 16 to be set free after three years in juvenile
detention. &QL;  &QL; AP/Tel Aviv--Israel eased its closure of the
West Bank and Gaza today to allow in a few thousand Palestinians-a
move Palestinian leaders dismissed as a token gesture that does little
to help their stymied economy. The United States, meanwhile,
reportedly is working on a compromise to get peace talks
restarted. &QL;  &QL; INSIDE: &QL;  &QL; ROBINSON AND SPOLAR/London--Britain's raucous
tabloid newspapers were uncharacteristically quiet today, as reports
that pursuing photographers might have contributed to Princess Diana's
death led to talk of tough new privacy laws, curbs on electronic
eavesdropping and other strictures on the prying press. Usually
blustery and bellicose, many tabloids opted for lyrical, subdued
language this morning. Perhaps more significant, however, the tabloids
had nothing to say today regarding the allegation that their hunger
for photos of Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed set the stage for
Sunday's tragic accident. &QL;  &QL; LONDON
NOTEBOOK--mourning at Harrods, newspapers selling out, no flag at
Buckingham Palace (queen is away) and moment of silence at land mines
meeting in Oslo. &QL;  &QL; Reuter/Beijing--tidal wave hits N.
Korea. &QL;  &QL; FOREIGN ROUNDUP:
<p>
   AP/Moscow--yeltsin says he won't run for third term.
Reuter/Moscow--Mir spacewalk set for saturday. AP/jerusalem--Netanyahu
says Israel-Egypt ties will survive dispute over trial.
REuter/Prague--Albright and members of her family visit her parents'
birthplace. Reuter/Tehran--alleged CIA spy is hanged.
<p>
   METRO: &QL;  &QL; Victoria Benning--For British citizens visiting or
living in the Washington area, Diana's death at 36 was particularly
hard felt. Many said wished they could be home grieving with their
countrymen. Instead, many found themselves glued to television-or
computer screens- trying to glean every detail about the accident that
killed Diana and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. Had they been home in
England, they surely would be gathered in the streets offering solace
to each other, many said. Absent from their homeland, Brits joined
throngs of other grief-stricken mourners outside the embassy in the
3100 block of Massachusetts Avenue NW where the steps have been turned
into a shrine to the popular princess. &HT;     &QL; STYLE: &QL;  &QL; Givhan--If Princess Diana leaves any gift to fashion,
it would be her love for it. She embraced the fashion industry in a
way that few public figures outside of Hollywood do, and with more
passion than any statesman dares. She did not live long enough to
develop an iconic style, but she had enough time to discover and
embrace the power of clothes. &HT;     &QL; Roxanne Roberts/London--On this flawless summer day, a
continuous stream of people poured onto the walkways leading to the
red-brick palace that was Princess Diana's London residence. The
grounds on the edge of Hyde Park usually close at dusk, but officials
kept the park open until 2 a.m. this morning to accommodate the tens
of thousands of mourners. When the grounds reopened three hours later,
more than 300 people were waiting to pay their respects. They were
drawn, they said, by a need to do something, anything to show Diana
how much they cared. &QL;  &QL; FINANCIAL: &QL;  &QL; AP/London--Financial markets pause
in memory of
Diana. Commerce will come to a halt for funeral Saturday.  &QL;  &QL; News
Services/Tokyo--Japan's stock market and some other Asian markets
rebounded early today after three sessions of sharp declines stemming
from investor worries about Asia's currency crisis. &HT;     &QL; Cheers,

 &UR; False Converts &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
<p>
   The tobacco companies are trying to create a new image of
themselves as repentant and in retreat when in fact they remain onthe
attack. Only the packaging has changed. When they settled the lawsuit
that Florida had filed against them the other day, the companies said
the deal was ``a concrete demonstration that the industry is prepared
to cooperate with government and the public health authorities to
emphasize that it doesn't want kids to smoke.'' They called the
settlement ``another step in a process to end the climate of
confrontation and litigation that has marked the national debate on
tobacco-related issues.''
<p>
   So they're pussycats, except that:
<p>
   (1) As part of the national deal they now want President Clinton to
bless, they've agreed to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years. Pretty
imposing. But the companies also got the Republican leadership of
Congress  &MD;  no less than House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott  &MD;  to tuck into the budget they sent the
president in July a couple of sentences forgiving them $50 billion of
this before they were even required to pay it. The $50 billion was to
compensate them for the tobacco tax increase Congress had just voted
in part to help finance a new program of children's health insurance.
No one professes to know exactly how the forgiveness made its way into
the legislation  &MD;  who suggested it, for example. But part of the
explanation, we are willing to guess, lies in the enormous campaign
contributions the tobacco companies have made to the Republicans in
recent years. (They also have given a lot, but less, to the
Democrats.) That's what these folks mean when they say they are buying
``access.'' The $368 billion figure won't endure; they'll find ways to
knock it down. The durable part of the deal, if they have their way,
will be the limits on future lawsuits that the $368 billion is meant
to buy. Surely no one would be so crass as to suggest that Congress go
back on its word on  &UR; that &LR; .
<p>
   (2) A second aspect of the deal has to do with the power of the
Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine. The companies
professed to agree that it has such power, which was nice of them,
since a court had already ruled so. Then they proposed that the power
should be exercised only if the FDA could jump through a series of
impossible and irrelevant hoops whose effect would be, as intended, to
negate the power. Meanwhile, the companies continue to appeal the
court ruling which confirmed that the authority exists.
<p>
   (3) They agreed as well to back off ads calculated to appeal to
kids, and a great show was made of the withdrawal of the Joe Camel
series. But it was withdrawn only to be replaced by another aimed at
pretty much the same market. The current behavior of the companies
demonstrates the same thing that their past behavior so amply shows:
They'll game any system that's put in place to keep them from selling
cigarettes. It's a mirage to think they're preparing to go out of
business. They simply want to buy at as low a price as possible a
steady platform from which to continue.
<p>
   Here's a rule, which the president and Congress alike should keep
in mind as try in the weeks ahead to figure out what to do about the
proposed master agreement: Almost by definition, any deal the tobacco
companies find congenial is against the public interest. It's a real
temptation to sign off on a big peace pact such as has been proposed  &MD; 
a world-class photo op, and there are in fact some substantive
features of the proposal that would be gains. Our own instinct is that
the politicians should go carefully and slowly. Among other things,
they need to see what a few more of the pending state suits, the one
in Minnesota particularly, turn up by way of evidence that the
companies knowingly put the many millions of people they hooked on
their product at risk. Which politicians want to vote for a limit on
future lawsuits and other liability in advance of that?

 &UR; Winslow Homer's Masculine Essay (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  War stamped Winslow Homer (1836-1910), and had already
done so when he decided he was ready to exhibit with the big boys in
the art world of New York.
<p>
   He was only 27. When it came to making pictures with oil paints and
brushes, he was still a green beginner, but he'd already been to
battle, at Alexandria and Yorktown  &MD;  and already he'd been seized by
that ache of male sharing and that sense of strong men dying that
would, until he died, remain central to his art.
<p>
   ``Home, Sweet Home,'' his calculated debut piece, would be
submitted to the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design
in the middle of the Civil War in 1863. War would be his subject. His
figures would be soldiers, their bivouac his setting. His themes would
be political, religious, geometrical. He would plan that little
picture, its feelings and its forms and its forces-in-reserve, as if
he were a general designing the deployments of a cavalry campaign.
<p>
   In June, ``Home, Sweet Home,'' 21 inches high, was sold at auction
at Christie's in Manhattan for $2.6 million to the National Gallery of
Art, where it is now on view.
<p>
   Evening after rain. A tented Union camp. The brass band in the
background is playing ``Home, Sweet Home,'' a pop anthem of the time.
Two bedraggled Union infantrymen  &MD;  whose true home is their
ever-so-humble pup tent, but whose thoughts are elsewhere  &MD;  are
listening intently to that sentimental air.
<p>
   And to something else as well. Somewhere in the distance, beyond
that plaintive melody, is the echo of the tomb and the rumble of the
guns. Beneath its calibrated poignance, ``Home, Sweet Home'' is
grounded on more turbulent emotions  &MD;  on a sense of endless dread, a
danger-darkned consciousness of sacrificial flesh.
<p>
   Right from the beginning, Homer had the knack of expressing in his
pictures actual duration, as if we the viewers were immersed in the
painting, like the soldiers in their reveries, only while the music
lasts.
<p>
   ``Home, Sweet Home,'' a buddy picture almost, is an essay in
masculinist absorption. It is, to use a term in vogue now in feminist
art discourse, a deeply gendered object, but it isn't feminist at all.
Homer is convinced that life is most intense, and most intensely
beautiful, in realms of male testing, in places women aren't.
<p>
   ``Home,'' one feels, couldn't be European. What most makes Homer's
canvas seem characteristically American is the quality of its
protagonists. In a French or British war painting of the mid-19th
century the warriors in the foreground would be bold aristocrats,
officers with sabers, or the peasantlike but loyal troops in their
command, not two regular guys in ill-fitting uniforms.
<p>
   Both men know they may soon die. War, they sense, has cursed them  &MD; 
or, this being Homer's world, perhaps they have been blessed.
<p>
   That courage is redemptive is a constant theme of Homer's (and
Hemingway's, and Hollywood's). His soldiers in their reveries have
been touched by special grace. Homer, in his later work, would grow a
lot more reticent, broadening his brushwork and silencing the creaking
of his symbolic machinery, but here the signs are clear. The painting,
in its details, invites us to accept that these men are kin to Christ.

   The Homer retrospective that Nicolai Cikovsky Jr. and Franklin
Kelly organized together for the National Gallery in 1995 made Homer's
towering stature evident to all. Our most accomplished brushman, our
clearest visual thinker, he is America's prime painter. Though their
museum owns six other Homer oils, including ``Right and Left'' (1909),
his last, the curators were right to urge the purchase of ``Home,
Sweet Home.'' The canvas is on display with a group of Homer's
on-the-spot battlefield sketches that were given to the museum by
Edmund Louis Gray Zalinski II.

   Want to know the name of the cheese of the decade? Torta del Casar,
from the Extremadura region of Spain. ``Its flavor will wipe you
out,'' says Steven Jenkins, the author of last year's highly praised
``Cheese Primer'' (Workman, 1996).
<p>
   Jenkins discovered Spanish cheeses about 10 years ago when he was
``smug and jaded and thought I'd ferreted out everything there was to
know about cheese.'' Now he's wild about them  &MD;  at least the regional
ones made by hand by people living on the same land where the cows and
goats and sheep graze.
<p>
   Among the others he adores: Afuega'l Pitu, Can Pujol, Garrotxa, La
Serena, Mahon and Majorero.

 &UR; Smoke Gets in Your Poultry &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Yes, we're still out here by the backyard grill, even if we do slip
back into the air conditioning when it's time to eat. And yes, we're
getting a little cranky standing here, balancing a Diet
Fill-in-the-Blanks and a chicken thigh so charred that the salmonella
marched out in protest.
<p>
   It's around now, when the coals are getting ready to cool for the
season, that a little alfresco legerdemain is in order. We're not
suggesting that you work any harder than your guests do at their
outdoor fetes, or that you fix anything particularly exotic, but what
we have in mind will make yours the outdoor dinner to remember next
February, when we're looking back (fondly) on the humidity.
<p>
   Lightly smoked. Unbelievably moist. Does that sound like chicken to
you? Probably not. It doesn't sound like turkey either. Or Cornish
game hen.
<p>
   But that's exactly what they  &UR; can &LR;  be. And bronzed to almost a
mahogany veneer. Norman Rockwell poultry  &MD;  the kind that will make you
glad that a whole bird should sit for a few minutes  &MD;  on a platter on
the buffet table, maybe, you little show-off?  &MD;  before you carve and
serve it.
<p>
   The method that achieves this is no secret: It's indirect cooking.
You see, the reason chickens end up charred is a combination of hot
charcoal fires and that layer of fat beneath the bird's skin, some
chickens being more egregiously fattened than others. Over coals, the
dripping melted fat causes flare-ups and, eventually, char.
<p>
   Some of us enjoy the deep taste of skin-charred chicken, but the
health implications of that are not great. Also, such a taste is very
much a personal idiosyncrasy, on a par with burned popcorn. Yet some
who wouldn't dream of serving a shriveled bird and burned vegetables
during the rest of the year seem to think the rules of good cooking
are suspended at grillside (mea culpa).
<p>
   LIGHTLY SMOKED CHICKEN (6 to 8 servings)
<p>
   Once you get the technique down, you'll always want to cook chicken
this way. It's  &UR; that &LR;  good. The chickens cook to a beautiful mahogany
color, and the meat is lightly smoky and very moist.
<p>
   This recipe was perfected by Kate Davidson of Arlington, Va.
Although she makes her own vinaigrettes for salads, Davidson uses
bottled dressing to marinate her chickens. We agree that her method
makes chickens that are delicious and easy.
<p>
   2 fryer chickens, about 3 pounds each
<p>
   2 cups Italian-style dressing, bottled or homemade
<p>
   Salt and pepper to taste
<p>
   1½ cups pecan or hickory chips
<p>
   Rinse the chicken with cold water. Tuck the wing tips under the
bird and tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Put each chicken
into a resealable plastic bag, pour ¾ cup of the Italian dressing into
each bag and seal (keep the remaining ¼ cup of dressing refrigerated
separately). Let the chickens marinate in the refrigerator for at
least 3 hours but not more than 24.
<p>
   Prepare the grill.
<p>
   Remove the chickens from the marinade and discard the bag and the
marinade. Salt and pepper to taste. Place the chickens, breast-side
up, on the grill directly above the drip pan. Cover the grill. After
15 minutes, remove the cover and turn the chickens over so the
breast-side is down.
<p>
   Brush with the reserved dressing and cover the grill. Repeat every
15 minutes. If the coals start to die down, remove the lid, add 7 or 8
coals to each side and leave the cover off for 5 or 6 minutes to
rejuvenate the fire. After a total of 45 minutes, add the remaining 2
wood-chip packets to the coals and start checking the temperature of
the chickens with an instant-read thermometer.
<p>
   The chickens are done when the thigh meat registers 170 degrees and
the breast meat registers 180. This can take anywhere from 45 to 75
minutes, depending on the heat of the fire. When done, remove the
chickens from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting
into serving pieces.

<p>
   LEMON-ROSEMARY CORNISH GAME HENS (6 servings)
<p>
   It's easiest to serve game hens cut in half. This can be done with
a sharp knife or, better yet, with poultry shears. If you don't
already own them, consider buying some. They make cutting up chickens
and other poultry a snap.
<p>
   1 teaspoon salt
<p>
   ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
<p>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 2 whole lemons, quartered
<p>
   1 tablespoon chopped rosemary, plus 3 whole sprigs rosemary
<p>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
<p>
   3 Cornish game hens, about 1¼ pounds each
<p>
   1½ cups wood chips
<p>
   Combine the salt, pepper, lemon zest, rosemary and 1 tablespoon of
the oil to make a lemon-rosemary paste. Set aside.
<p>
   Rinse the game hens under cold water. With your fingers, gently
loosen the skin over the breasts and legs. Using 1/3 of the
lemon-rosemary paste, spread the paste on one of the hens between the
meat and the skin over the breast and legs. Repeat with the other two
hens. Place the hens in resealable plastic bags or wrap in plastic and
refrigerate for at least 6 hours but not more than 24. Prepare the
grill.
<p>
   Stuff 2 or 3 lemon quarters and a sprig of rosemary inside the
cavity of each hen and brush the hens with the remaining 1 tablespoon
of oil. Place the hens, breast-side up, on the grill directly over the
drip pan. Cover.
<p>
   Turn the game hens over every 15 minutes. Add the remaining 2
wood-chip packets and start checking the temperature of the game hens
with an instant-read thermometer after 30 minutes. The game hens are
done when the thigh meat registers 170 degrees and the breast meat
registers 180. This can take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, depending
on the heat of the fire. When they are done, remove the game hens from
the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut each game hen in half,
discard the lemon quarters and rosemary sprigs, and serve immediately.

<p>
   GINGER-PLUM-GLAZED CHICKEN (8 servings)
<p>
   Unless you have a very large grill, you'll probably be able to cook
only half this recipe at a time. Cook the dark meat first: It takes
the longest (up to 45 minutes). The breast quarters will be done in 25
to 30 minutes. Cover the cooked pieces with aluminum foil to keep warm
until you're ready to serve.
<p>
   You don't have to use the indirect cooking method here, but it's so
much better. The sauce beautifully glazes the lightly smoked chicken.
<p>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
<p>
   1 cup diced onion
<p>
   2 tablespoons chopped garlic
<p>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger root
<p>
   2 cups tomato puree
<p>
   ½ cup plum jam or preserves
<p>
   1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco
<p>
   1 teaspoon salt, plus additional to taste
<p>
   ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus additional to taste
<p>
   8 chicken quarters (about 6 pounds), or any similar combination of
parts
<p>
   1½ cups wood chips
<p>
   Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small saute pan over medium heat.
Add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the onion starts to
soften. Add the chopped garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes.
<p>
   In a blender, combine the onion mixture with the tomato puree, plum
jam, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper and blend until smooth.
Refrigerate until ready to use. Prepare the grill.
<p>
   Salt and pepper the chicken quarters and brush with the remaining
oil. Place the chicken quarters, meat-side down, on the grill directly
over the drip pan. Cover. After 10 minutes, turn the quarters
meat-side up and, using a portion of the reserved ginger-plum barbecue
sauce, baste the chicken.
<p>
   Cover the grill and let the chicken cook, basting again and turning
the pieces every 5 minutes. After a total of 20 minutes, start
checking the temperature of the chicken with an instant-read
thermometer. Breast quarters are done at 180 degrees. Thighs and legs
at 170 degrees, or when the juices run clear. If cooking the chicken
in two batches, add more coals and the remaining wood-chip packets
between batches and give the coals about 10 minutes, uncovered, to
rejuvenate.
<p>
   Serve the chicken with the reserved ginger-plum barbecue sauce.

 &UR; When the Smoke Clears: A Question of Gas vs. Charcoal &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   This subject is guaranteed to spark debate. On the gas-grill side,
you have something that's a breeze for even a novice to use. On the
charcoal-grill side, you have a method that requires knowing how to
build a fire using charcoal, through which you get flavors that can't
be duplicated by gas heating elements.
<p>
   It comes down to just what you want and how much trouble you're
willing to go to get it. If you're cooking items that are done in 25
minutes or less, and you don't want to fuss with charcoal, choose gas.
Gas grills heat up quickly, with controls similar to those on an oven
or stove.
<p>
   But if you want foods with a truly smoky flavor, there is only one
choice  &MD;  a traditional charcoal grill. Nothing replicates the flavors
imparted by charcoal, whether you're cooking a hamburger or lightly
smoking a turkey. And for that turkey, the charcoal grill's a
necessity. In fact, anything that needs to cook for more than 25
minutes should be cooked using indirect heat (otherwise you risk the
food's becoming charred on the outside long before it's done on the
inside).
<p>
   With the indirect method, coals are banked on opposite sides of the
grill's interior cavity, and food is placed in the middle of the grill
over a drip pan set between the two banks of charcoal. Soaked wood
chips are placed on top of the coals, and the grill is covered. Such
cooking produces items that have a light smoky flavor, moist meat and
a beautiful even color.
<p>
   You will find instructions for simulating indirect cooking in the
booklet that came with your gas grill, but, unfortunately, the results
are just not the same.

<p>
   At least 30 minutes before cooking the poultry, soak the wood chips
in water; set aside.
<p>
   Pile at least 20 pieces of charcoal or briquettes on one side of
the grill and an equal number on the opposite side, leaving space in
the middle for a drip pan to catch any juices or fat. When the coals
are covered with light gray ash, the fire is ready.
<p>
   Drain the wood chips. Using aluminum foil, form 6 packets of wood
chips. With the tip of a knife, make three 1-inch gashes in each
packet so the smoke can escape. Place 2 packets on each side of the
grill, on top of the coals (the rest will be added later). Place the
rack on the grill with the handles positioned over the coals (this
will allow you to add coals to the fire through the handle openings
without removing the rack).

 &UR; Putting Hostas Where They'll Do Best (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Not all the setbacks in the garden this year can be
laid at the foot of the drought.
<p>
   If your well-watered hostas and ferns have leaves curling up and
withering around the edges, they overdosed on sunlight.
<p>
   But if your lilies and daylilies, yuccas and yarrows, cannas and
black-eyed Susans offered puny blooms or only a few of them, they did
not receive enough sun. Transplanting may be in order; a switch of
locations seems to be called for, and you can prepare for the move
now.
<p>
   Getting shade-light requirements correct the first time is an
elusive skill even for practiced hands. That's because some shade
plants do best bathed in sunlight early or late in the day. Similarly,
plants listed for full sun may crave every sunbeam in Connecticut but
elsewhere they are happier if shielded from the hottest sunshine of
the day.
<p>
   Some hosta plants, those hardworking perennials for the shade
garden, look better when they get a few hours of sun. This applies
especially to those with gold or deep-green leaves, such as the
cultivars Sum and Substance, Green Fountain and Green Edge.
<p>
   Frequently, the malaise facing a new plant rests not with sun or
shade but age. The showiest hostas with the popular flaring leaves and
others with the much-admired wide and irregular margins in contrasting
colors take several years to give their best performance. And they may
never look precisely the same as catalog photographs because of
critical divergences in soil conditions and rainfall, nutrients and
temperature, as well as the quality of the light.
<p>
   When it comes to hosta clumps, remember the slogan of Paul Aden,
eminent hosta breeder and writer: ``The older the better.''
<p>
   But the extended periods of intense heat may be too much for many
of them, and those that look the most battered should be transplanted
where there is more shade. The same applies to ferns and astilbes,
Virginia bluebells and forget-me-nots.
<p>
   Once the heat breaks  &MD;  and relief is expected to last  &MD;  you can
transplant sunburnt shade-lovers into locations offering more shade.
For sun-lovers needing a new place out of the shade, wait until the
garden has cooled markedly in late September. The principal rule of
successful transplanting is that the new location should offer better
soil than the old.
<p>
   Putting plants in a small mound amended with compost or other humus
is pampering that pays dividends in better performance for years to
come. The transplants should be dug with as much soil around their
roots as possible and then moved carefully to the new location so the
soil does not break up. Do not lift the plant by its stem.
<p>
   After the rootball is embedded in the new, high-quality, porous
soil, a thorough soak is required: Keep the soil moist to touch for
about a week. A blanket of mulch is mandatory. In case of sun-lovers,
be extra careful; covering the plant with a white cloth for a week
provides the additional protection from the sun that the plant may
need.
<p>
   Bold spirits may decide to use the opportunity of a transplant to
break up clumps that have gotten too large. Hostas, astilbes and
daylilies in particular are famous for root systems that become too
dense and eventually compete for nutrients in such a way that leaf and
bloom production declines significantly.
<p>
   A razor-sharp straight-edged spade is the right tool for whacking
the roots in two, four or even eight equal parts. The cut should be
strong and decisive: brought down on the plant without any hesitation.
(A good saw or serrated kitchen knife also may work.)
<p>
   Some roots inevitably will be damaged and some tubers sliced, but
enough tissue will remain to start new lives in a new place, to spread
out and to spread joy.

 &UR; Sweet Potatoes That Live Up to Their Name (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Long forgotten in the home garden, sweet potatoes are
an ideal addition to the domestic plot: A few go a long way. With
sweet potatoes, a patch of 12 to 25 plants will produce enough for a
dozen meals, with a few extra for storing or planting out again next
year.
<p>
   There is a myth that these slow-to-mature, sun-loving plants must
have the 10-month growing season and heavy heat of the deep South to
produce their delicious tubers. The same is said of growing okra.
<p>
   In fact, both grow eagerly at more northerly latitudes, and not
just in the Washington area: Some, like Georgia Jet, thrive as far
north as Vermont.
<p>
   Garden-grown sweets are sweeter and more flavorful than those found
in supermarkets. To find out just how good they can be, sample some
first from a farmer's market. The first harvest will be coming in
shortly.
<p>
   When lifted and steamed lightly the same day, the young potatoes
reveal a gentle but unmistakable sweetness, undertones of buttery
nuttiness that recall hazelnut, and a texture that is flaky but never
doughy.
<p>
   When used immediately after harvest, the sugars have not yet turned
starchy, the texture is still very crunchy and moist. Freshly
harvested sweet potatoes always should be served alone  &MD;  don't even
think about candying these. Adding raisins or nuts or other
traditional sweet-potato accompaniments simply detracts from the pure
and delicate flavor. Later, in full maturity or after they have been
stored, sweet potatoes will take rougher treatment in the kitchen. But
with home-grown sweets, even the larger, mature tubers have greater
complexity of flavor than the store-bought versions and should be
served as ungarnished as possible.
<p>
   Sweet potatoes, though they may resemble their white Irish or Idaho
counterparts, are not related to the more-traditional tubers. Potatoes
are members of the nightshade family, which includes tomatoes,
eggplant and tobacco.
<p>
   Sweet potatoes actually are tropical morning glories. As such, they
are beautiful to grow. Their foliage is heart-shaped, ranging from
blue-green to burgundy and purple; flowers are trumpet-shaped and
generally pale pink or lilac.
<p>
   Sweet potatoes make a great ground cover. Growers with small
gardens should try bush-type varieties: Look for Vardaman and Bush
Porto Rico, which take three square feet per plant. They would look
attractive rolling down a hill or filling wide spaces between newly
planted perennials. I grew Centennial one year and loved the tubers
but found the plants to be as riotous as pumpkins.
<p>
   With hot summers, sweet potatoes grow luxuriantly, with few pests.
Japanese beetles enjoy them, but there's not much that Japanese
beetles won't go after. Spray foliage with a pyrethrum insecticide to
quell the beetles, but avoid spraying the flowers.
<p>
   Apart from these beetles, I never have had any other pest problems.
I grow sweets in organic-rich soil, almost pure leaf compost, to which
I add wood ash in the spring. They should not get too much nitrogen
but benefit from potassium and potash for root development.
<p>
   ``Slips,'' small sprouts taken from mature potatoes, are available
from garden centers in the spring and through mail-order catalogs.
They should be planted singly in warm ground  &MD;  mid-May in my rural
Virginia garden  &MD;  and spaced two feet apart.
<p>
   Although plants will thrive even with scant water, tubers will be
skimpy and the flesh less full-flavored if they are deprived of water.
This summer, I watered my sweets every 10 days and kept them heavily
mulched in between. The mulching is especially important because the
thick-stemmed vines, as they trail along the ground, send out small
rootlets to gather more moisture and nutrients.
<p>
   Tubers can be lifted 90 to 100 days after the slips went in. They
must be removed completely before the first frost. Frost can ruin the
flavor and texture of delicate sweets.
<p>
   Use nicked tubers first; store the rest in a dry place at room
temperature. Next year, make room for twice as many: You will want a
good deal more once you have tried them fresh from the garden.

   Leaf blight on English ivy can be controlled by thinning overgrown
vines, removing dead leaves and spraying with a basic copper spray.
<p>
   Die-back in vinca is probably caused by phomopsis blight, says
Maryland Home and Garden Information Center's David Clement. Remove
dead growth.

 &UR; One Piece Or Two? Other Questions Await `Miss America' &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Questions. There are so many questions. Really? Like what?
<p>
   Seldom in the 77-year history of the Miss America pageant have
questions loomed as such a large part of the proceedings.
<p>
   When the producers of Saturday's pageant (on ABC) looked for ways
to distinguish this year's ceremonies from those of the past, they
decided to give contestants a swimsuit-style option (one piece or
two?) and to have the interviews of the five finalists conducted by a
journalist rather than the hosts.
<p>
   Suddenly, many questions were in order.
<p>
   First of all, who would ask the questions?
<p>
   Pageant officials decided on Nancy Glass. Well, why Nancy Glass?
<p>
   ``They didn't say why they'd picked me,'' said Glass. ``They just
called and asked.''
<p>
   And she said yes, resolving one question. Then came another: What
should she ask? She gets to ask two questions of each of the final
five.
<p>
   To answer that question, Glass launched a world-wide search for
good questions.
<p>
   Naturally, that involved a Web site. And an old-fashioned radio
show.
<p>
   ``I asked for suggestions on my radio program,'' said Glass.
<p>
   So, what was the worst suggestion called in by a radio listener?
<p>
   ``Somebody suggested that I ask them whether they believe in
UFOs,'' said Glass. ``The radio-caller believed in them and said that
if a contestant didn't believe in them, she shouldn't be Miss
America.''
<p>
   So she won't be asking the fab five about UFOs. What will she be
asking?
<p>
   That's not a question. That's a secret.
<p>
   ``I have had some good suggestions,'' said Glass. ``I've heard some
I may use.''
<p>
   By the way, who is Nancy Glass?
<p>
   Until the syndicated ``American Journal'' went to a brother-sister
host team (Charles Perez and Michele Dabney-Perez), she had hosted the
program and been its senior correspondent since 1993. Before that, she
was the weekend anchor and senior correspondent for ``Weekend
Edition.''
<p>
   Her background in TV magazine shows also has included stints as
writer-host for ``This Evening,'' co-host of ``Attitudes'' on Lifetime
cable and host of PBS' ``Sneak Previews.''
<p>
   Her radio call-in program, ``The Nancy Glass Show,'' is broadcast
from Philadelphia on Saturday mornings.
<p>
   She and her husband, periodontist Mark Snyder, have two children,
Max and Sloane. In her spare time, Glass likes to scull on the
Schuylkill River. She is 39.
<p>
   In the course of her career, Glass has interviewed a ton of
celebrities and the likes of Marife Torres Nichols, wife of Oklahoma
City bombing defendant Terry Nichols, and serial killer Jeffrey
Dahmer.
<p>
   So, interviewing pageant finalists should be no problem. Glass said
she's already ruled out certain kinds of questions.
<p>
   Like what?
<p>
   ``I won't ask about a specific issue,'' she said. ``They are all
trained and have memorized answers when it comes to issues.''
<p>
   Glass said she's thinking in terms of one fun question and one
serious one.
<p>
   ``I have to ask hardball-softball questions designed to reveal who
they are rather than what they've managed to memorize,'' she said.
``That's hard. And I have to do it within a finite amount of time. And
the questions have to be equally hard for each contestant.''
<p>
   She will have two hours to zero in on the five finalists after
husband-wife co-hosts John Callahan and Eva LaRue Callahan of ``All My
Children'' have announced the cutdown from 10.
<p>
   Glass has other questions on her mind, too  &MD;  such as, what to wear
to Convention Hall on the biggest night in Atlantic City.
<p>
   ``No gown, no tiara,'' said Glass. ``They want me to dress in a
professional manner, not like a contestant.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, anyone with question suggestions can drop them by the
Web site, www.abc.com/missamerica

 &UR; In `Story of Painting,' Sister Wendy Explains It All for You &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Sister Wendy Beckett prefers to be alone. The now-familiar ``art
nun'' who lives in a trailer on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery
in Norfolk, England, wakes at 3 in the morning, prays seven hours a
day, then turns her attention to art for two more.
<p>
   She has combined her devotion to God with her passion for art since
1980, after a decade translating medieval Latin in her limited free
time. Before that, as a Sister of Notre Dame, she taught until
epilepsy forced her to stop.
<p>
   But Sister Wendy's routine has been interrupted more and more,
culminating in Sunday's ``Story of Painting,'' a five-part series on
PBS.
<p>
   In it, the South African-born, Oxford-educated 67 year old reveals
her passion for Western painting, from prehistoric cave art to Andy
Warhol, to encourage people to respond to art.
<p>
   The effort took more than 100 days of shooting on locations that
spanned 30,000 flying miles in 12 countries.
<p>
   But how does a nun go from writing about art in a trailer to
hosting her own globe-trotting television series?
<p>
   Well, first Sister Wendy landed a book contract on contemporary
women artists (the first of 15 she's written). She also became a
contributor to British art magazines, reviewing shows from her trailer
using postcard reproductions.
<p>
   BBC television producer Nicholas Rossiter took note, and in 1991
invited her to do a documentary on Britain's National Gallery, which
he thought would be fascinating considering she'd be gazing at
masterpieces she'd never seen  &MD;  but long studied.
<p>
   That led to ``Sister Wendy's Odyssey,'' six 10-minute films on her
rendezvous with art treasures around Britain  &MD;  which lucky American
viewers would catch if a PBS show, such as ``House of Eliott,'' ended
10 minutes before the hour. These ``Odyssey'' snippets attracted a lot
of attention, despite the fact that their short length prevented them
from being put on television schedules. They air still.
<p>
   Thankfully, another series, ``Sister Wendy's Grand Tour,'' and a
special, ``Pains of Glass,'' both aired here in late 1995, making her
easier to find. These took her to museums and churches all over
Europe. And now Sunday night is the first episode of the sweeping
``Sister Wendy's Story of Painting,'' told with her characteristic
insight, wit and total lack of shyness even when discussing nudes.
<p>
   A self-taught art scholar, Sister Wendy often brings an irreverent
attitude toward her subject. When she saw the sphinxes at the Temple
of Luxor in Egypt, she said, ``They look like garden gnomes.'' And at
Monet's garden at Giverny, France, she said, ``Much like any other
garden. We could have filmed this at Kew.''
<p>
   Sister Wendy reduces art theory to language as simple as her life.
Unwilling to use a telephone for an interview, she instead typed
answers to a reporter's questions, which were faxed to America.
<p>
   For example, on why humans express themselves through art: ``For
the artist, I suspect it is a need to create, to make visible a
vision, whatever the consequences. For the viewer, it is a sharing in
that vision which illuminates one's own truth,'' she wrote. ``But that
is a by-product, not the goal. I never think motives matter very much,
because we are so easily deceived by what we think they are. What
matters is the result, which can be judged.''
<p>
   Sister Wendy encourages her audience to take a good look before
judging. Even better, to grasp a context  &MD;  for which we have her
``Story of Painting.'' Each of the five episodes contains two
segments:
<p>
   Episode 1 begins with the roots of Western painting at prehistoric
caves in France, then stops at Pompeii and Iona, an island off the
coast of Scotland where the Book of Kells was discovered. Then she
travels to Italy to examine Giotto's earth-shaking works, done around
1300.
<p>
   Episode 2 covers the Renaissance through the 16th century.
<p>
   Episode 3 examines the Baroque movement throughout Europe in the
17th century.
<p>
   Episode 4 begins with how the French Revolution and the Industrial
Revolution influenced artists of the time; and continues with the
Impressionists in Paris and their descendants.
<p>
   Episode 5 follows modernism, which ``dared to be ugly,'' says
Sister Wendy, with a look at Cezanne and Picasso and Matisse. The
series wraps up with a trip to the United States to look at Pop Art
and Minimalism, then back to London to check out England's
contemporaries.
<p>
   Asked if the current attempts at expression could be considered
part of a low or a high period, Sister Wendy was cautious.
<p>
   ``The contemporaries of the Impressionists thought that they were
in a low period creatively. It took time to make it clear that this
was, on the contrary, a high. So it is too soon to be pessimistic
about the present artistic scene, I think. It may be better than it
seems!''
<p>
   Sister Wendy wants more people to have a brush with art, no matter
where they begin learning.
<p>
   ``I am a great lover of the chronological, and would always like to
begin at the beginning, which for painting, effectively, is Giotto,''
she said. ``But the timorous newcomer might feel more at home with the
Renaissance, and work backwards and forwards from it, or even the
Impressionists, which everybody responds happily to.''
<p>
   Her zest for explaining paintings seems endless, despite her
preference to live and work alone. She also shrinks from watching
herself on camera. ``When I've been forced to, because the producers
really wanted input, then I have watched and offered my opinion,'' she
said.
<p>
   But before she can return to her quiet life, Sister Wendy has more
art to explain.
<p>
   ``Paradoxically, the more painting I saw the more I yearned to do
something on sculpture, so yes: if I do `another project' (I am old
and tired, remember) it would be sculpture.''
<p>
   Until then, she'll live the quiet life.
<p>
   ``I came to solitude to live wholly for God. If I am now asked to
spend brief periods in non-solitude, it would be selfish to resist on
the grounds that I do not want to! So it fits in well with the ethos
of being a nun: not taking much notice of one's personal desire. Yet
since my deepest personal desire is to love God, this little sacrifice
fits in well!''

<p>
   PBS viewers get three documentaries by Ken Burns this season, one
of them tracing the journey of explorers Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark; a three-hour biography of Harry S. Truman; a search for
improved ways to protect the environment; and the return of veteran
series such as ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' ``Mystery,'' ``American
Masters,'' ``Frontline'' and ``Nova.''
<p>
   Aside from all that, PBS steps out with an unusual choice, ``Sister
Wendy's Story of Painting'' (Sunday) featuring the bespectacled,
Oxford-educated nun from Norfolk, England, who had rarely seen
television before the BBC sent her and a TV crew 30,000 miles through
12 countries to visit more than 40 galleries, churches, studios and
collections of paintings. She'll tell you all about them over five
weeks.
<p>
    &MD;  On Monday, three-hour ``Planet Neighborhood'' looks at ideas for
a better environment. William McDonough hosts.
<p>
    &MD;  On Sept. 15 is Michael Palin's third travel series, ``Full
Circle,'' a 10-parter visiting the countries of the Pacific Rim.
<p>
    &MD;  On Sept. 17, ``American Masters'' begins with a biography of poet
Allen Ginsberg (``Howl,'' ``Kaddish'').
<p>
    &MD;  On Sept. 22, ``The American Experience'' begins profiling
20th-century presidents, reprising ``TR, the Story of Theodore
Roosevelt,'' Sept. 22 and 23; ``FDR'' on Sept. 24 and 25; ``Ike''
Sept. 29, and offering a new ``Truman'' on Oct. 5 and 6.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Mystery!'' begins its 18th season Sept. 28 with ``Into the
Blue,'' starring John Thaw as Harry Barnett, a character created by
novelist Robert Goddard. He'll be followed by four stories featuring
Patricia Routledge as investigator Hetty Wainthropp.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Masterpiece Theatre'' returns Oct. 12 with ``The Mill on the
Floss,'' a two-hour story starring Emily Watson, and follows with Ann
Bronte's ``The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' (Oct. 19 and 26) and starring
Tara Fitzgerald and Rupert Graves.
<p>
    &MD;  Ken Burns' ``Divided Highways: The Interstates and Transformation
of American Life'' on Oct. 22, traces the ideals, motives and methods
of the Interstate Highway system.
<p>
    &MD;  Burns' ``Lewis &AMP; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery,''
airing Nov. 4 and 5 and based on Stephen Ambrose's best-selling
``Undaunted Courage.'' Over four years, Burns and company covered the
same route that Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson's personal
secretary, and William Clark took when they left Virginia on May 14,
1804, to map and explore Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase.
<p>
    &MD;  Donna Murphy, Roger Rees, Campbell Scott and others star in
``Liberty! The American Revolution,'' a six-hour documentary beginning
Nov. 23.
<p>
    &MD;  In early 1998: Burns' film on architect Frank Lloyd Wright; the
four-part series ``Cancer Wars''; and ``The Face of Russia,'' a
digital production hosted by James H. Billington, the U.S. Librarian
of Congress, about art and architecture.

   Cumulative trauma disorders, also known as repeated trauma
disorders or repetitive stress illnesses, have grown dramatically as a
cause of workers' compensation claims and absenteeism in the last
decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<p>
   These disorders, which range from carpal tunnel syndrome and
tendinitis to lower-back strain, are ``the biggest workplace health
problem today,'' according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
<p>
   Alan Couturier of the American College of Occupational and
Environmental Medicine says these injuries can be reduced by making
workstations more flexible, allowing workers appropriately timed rest
breaks and rotating tasks. Workers can help by getting proper
nutrition, exercise and sleep.

 &UR; Good Feeling Fades Fast After Vacation, &QL; 
 &UR; Researchers Find &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   How long does it take for vacation afterglow to fade?
<p>
   Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel examined that
question in a study of 76 clerks at an electronics firm in central
Israel. Stress levels and feelings of job burnout were measured by
questionnaires twice before a two-week company shutdown for vacation,
once during the vacation and twice after the vacation.
<p>
   Results from the study, which appeared in the August issue of the
Journal of Applied Psychology, suggest that a vacation's good feeling
was already beginning to fade just three days after the study
participants returned to work. By three weeks after, stress levels and
feelings of burnout had returned to pre-vacation levels for all
participants.
<p>
   Women benefited most from vacations, the study found. And the
beneficial effects of a vacation faded more gradually for people who
reported enjoying their vacation the most.
<p>
   There may be a lesson in that.

 &UR; Mouth Piercing Can Lead to Problems, Dentists Say &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   With the growing popularity of body-piercing, dentists are becoming
concerned about complications that can occur when people have had
jewelry or metal devices placed in the tongue and other parts of the
mouth.
<p>
   Such piercing is done by unlicensed, self-trained operators,
without anesthesia. Pain and swelling are frequent, but other side
effects can include prolonged bleeding, chipped teeth, scarring and
infections, according to an article in the July issue of the Journal
of the American Dental Association.
<p>
   Shelia S. Price and Maurice W. Lewis of the West Virginia
University School of Dentistry described the case of a 20-year-old
patient, treated in their clinic for an unrelated wisdom-tooth
problem, who had pierced his tongue, lip and uvula (the pink tag of
tissue that hangs down in the back of the throat).
<p>
   He subsequently swallowed the uvula ornament when it accidentally
came out, but he still wore the barbell-shaped tongue ornament. Price
warned that such jewelry can fall out and obstruct the patient's
airway, can damage teeth during chewing, and can prevent dentists from
getting a good look at the teeth on dental X-rays. It may also impede
speech and increase the flow of saliva. Ornaments in the tongue (the
most common site for piercing in the mouth) can collect food debris
and other foreign material, increasing the risk of infection.
<p>
   Although there are no reliable statistics on the prevalence of
mouth-piercing, Price said dentists at the Morgantown clinic are
seeing an increasing number of patients with piercing of the tongue,
lips or cheeks, and wanted to alert colleagues to the risks, ``just in
the event that a patient who may be contemplating having piercing done
comes to seek the guidance of his or her dentist.''

 &UR; Even Toddlers on Trikes Benefit from Helmets, Study Suggests &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Preschool cyclists, even those on tricycles, benefit from wearing
helmets as much as older children, a national study suggests.
<p>
   ``Even young children who do not ride cycles in the street sustain
severe injuries and need protection from head injury,'' researchers
concluded. Although children under age 5 account for a small
percentage of bike-riding injuries, the new study found, their
injuries are comparable in severity to those of older children.
<p>
   The study is based on a nationwide database of pediatric trauma
cases, including 4,041 children hospitalized for bicycle-related
injuries. About 5 percent of the injured children  &MD;  219 in all  &MD;  were
under age 5; the rest were 5 to 14 years old. Tricycle-related
injuries were counted as bicycle injuries in the database.
<p>
   Almost none of the injured children  &MD;  less than 3 percent of the
preschoolers and about 3 percent of those aged 5 to 14  &MD;  wore a helmet
at the time of their injury. Head trauma was the most common serious
injury among both older and younger children hospitalized after
bicycling mishaps.
<p>
   While most injury-prevention efforts are aimed at school-age
children and adolescents, researchers said the wear-a-helmet message
should target preschoolers as well. An estimated 200,000 to 300,000
bicycles for preschool-age children are sold each year in the United
States.
<p>
   ``Helmet use by young children would likely prevent most head
injuries (in cyclists) and might help form habits that would result in
improved helmet use rates as these young cyclists grow older,''
researchers concluded.
<p>
   The study was conducted by a team from Children's Memorial Hospital
and Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago and Tufts-New
England Medical Center in Boston. The results were published in this
month's Annals of Emergency Medicine.
<p>
   Aside from the severity, which was similar, researchers found a
slightly different pattern of injuries in very young cyclists,
compared with older ones. Preschool riders are more likely than older
ones to be injured in the driveway or yard, and less likely to be hurt
in the street. They were also less likely than older riders to be
involved in crashes with motor vehicles.

 &UR; Vaccine for Poultry Takes Aim at Salmonella &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A new vaccine for poultry may soon be able to prevent many of the
more than 45,000 reported cases of food poisoning caused annually by
salmonella bacteria.
<p>
   Chickens are frequent carriers of  &UR; Salmonella enteritidis &LR; , a type
of bacteria that doesn't make the birds sick but can cause cramps,
fever and diarrhea in people. Raw or undercooked eggs (often used in
mayonnaise or salad dressing) are the most frequent source of
infection.
<p>
   Contaminated chicken or turkey also can produce the illness, which
is particularly dangerous for children, the elderly or people with
weakened immune systems. Because most cases of salmonella food
poisoning are undiagnosed, the number of Americans who suffer from it
annually may be as many as 4 million.
<p>
   Roy Curtiss III, a professor of biology at Washington University at
St. Louis, developed an oral vaccine for poultry that makes use of a
weakened strain of a related bacterium,  &UR; Salmonella typhimurium &LR; . The
vaccine strain is missing two genes that the bacteria need in order to
cause serious illness in birds.
<p>
   When given the vaccine, adult chickens develop lifelong immunity to
salmonella (including the strains that cause food poisoning in humans)
and pass on this immunity to their eggs and to their chicks.
<p>
   Curtiss presented results of initial trials of the vaccine in July
at the International Veterinary Vaccines and Diagnostics Conference in
Madison, Wis. Scientists at Megan Health Inc., a St. Louis company
that will produce the vaccine, are awaiting approval from the
Department of Agriculture to conduct larger field trials, involving
thousands of birds. If those studies are successful, the USDA could
license the vaccine next year.

   HOLLYWOOD  &MD;  Nazi biker chicks and senior citizens married to
Generation Xers will not be appearing on any of the four syndicated
daytime series premiering Monday  &MD;  unless, perhaps, they're sharing
cooking tips or doing a comedy routine.
<p>
   Thanks to the enormous success of ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,''
dysfunctional daytime TV seems to be out and good clean fun,
entertainment and information are in.
<p>
   ``Rosie has clearly shown that there is room for clean TV,'' says
Gayle King, Emmy Award-winning news anchor and Oprah Winfrey's good
friend. She appears on the daytime scene as host of ``The Gayle King
Show.''
<p>
   ``Variety and talk are very appealing,'' says Los Angeles sports
anchor Fred Roggin, who hosts the talk-variety series ``The Arthel &AMP;
Fred Show'' with Arthel Neville, late of ``Extra.''
<p>
   ``People who run TV stations want to have a certain image,'' Roggin
says. ``It's a kinder, gentler time, and the people who program the TV
stations want to have a good feeling about their TV stations. I think
that's why these shows are coming back.''
<p>
   Joining ``Arthel &AMP; Fred'' and ``The Gayle King Show'' this week are
``The Home Team With Terry Bradshaw'' and ``Martha Stewart Living.''
(Two other new daytime shows already have a jump-start. Last month,
ABC added Barbara Walters' talk series ``View'' to its lineup, and
Fox's hip but struggling ``Fox After Breakfast'' morning show was
rechristened ``The Vicki Lawrence Show.'')
<p>
   Having fun is the main objective of ``Arthel &AMP; Fred.'' The hourlong
series will feature a live band, celebrity guests and field pieces.
<p>
   ``Because we are both broadcasters, we are of the mind you have to
get out there with people,'' Neville explains. ``We work well with
people.''
<p>
   ``We really want our guests to have fun,'' offers Roggin, who is
continuing his sports duties on NBC's L.A. affiliate, KNBC. ``We are
two people who enjoy having fun. We want people to be relaxed and want
them to be part of the party.''
<p>
   Martha Stewart, queen of ``how-to'' TV and publishing, has adapted
her former weekend series to weekdays. The daily version ``is truly
alternative television,'' she says. ``It's an alternative to talk.
It's an alternative to junk. That's my objective.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   ``Martha Stewart Living'' will be similar to her old series but
will make some adaptations on the theory that the available viewing
audience will be much more dominated by women. The daily version,
Stewart says, will feature such new segments as tool of the week,
cookie of the week and cake of the month. She also is introducing an
interactive Web site on the program, so viewers can print out recipes
and information while watching the show.
<p>
   ``I'm trying to fill every single minute with information that is
valuable and desirable,'' says Stewart, who built a state-of-the-art
studio in Connecticut to produce the series. ``The motto of the show
is, `You learn something new every day.' ''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   ``The Gayle King Show'' will be following Stewart in most markets .
``The thinking is that Martha does stuff for your house and Gayle does
stuff for the people in your house,'' says King, who will continue to
anchor the 5:30 p.m. newscast at WFSB-TV in Hartford, Conn.
<p>
   Unlike ``Arthel &AMP; Fred,'' King's talk show is not celebrity-driven.
``I'm convinced you can do a show about normal people,'' says King,
who tapes the program in Hartford. ``There aren't any new topics.
Every damn thing has been done, so our challenge is presenting it in a
way that people will not mind seeing it again.''
<p>
   King will explore a new topic each day. ``I'm fascinated by
relationships and shows that are oriented toward kids,'' says the
divorced mother of two children. ``What I hope is that you will feel
comfortable watching it.''
<p>
   Terry Bradshaw, famed Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback and Fox ``NFL
Sunday'' broadcaster, describes his new series as ``viewer-friendly.
We're noncombative with our guests. Hopefully, when the show is over,
the viewer at home has a smile on their face.''
<p>
   The hourlong ``Home Team'' combines celebrity interviews with
informational segments on cooking, health, fitness, home repair and
stories of human interest. ``Home Team'' members include ``Ms. Fix
It'' Kim Gordon and roving reporter Eric Tunney. Bradshaw will also
chat, a la Art Linkletter, with kids.
<p>
   Bradshaw, who acknowledges he's still trying to find a
``comfortable range'' as host, says he could never have done a tabloid
daytime show. ``I see life through the eyes of a child,'' he says. ``I
see nothing but the fun of life.''

 &UR; Dieters' Persistence Can Pay Off, Study Finds &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Yo-yo dieters take heart. Just when it seemed that successful
weight loss could be as elusive as an icy day in summer, a team of
University of Pittsburgh researchers has found evidence suggesting
otherwise.
<p>
   In an attempt to better understand successful long-term weight
loss, the team has studied nearly 800 people who shed a minimum of 30
pounds and kept the weight off for nearly six years.
<p>
   These were not simply lucky first-time dieters. The participants in
the study were hard-core, weight-gaining recidivists who had lost an
average total of 270 pounds each during their lives. Nearly half of
the participants, whose average age was 45, had been overweight since
early childhood, and another 25 percent had put on unwanted pounds
from age 12 to 18.
<p>
   Through the years ``they had done a lot of weight cycling,'' said
Mary Lou Klem, senior research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine and lead author of the ongoing study, which was
reported in the August issue of the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition.
<p>
   Unlike the majority of dieters who usually regain their lost pounds
and often add more, the study found that these people ``have tried a
lot of things to lose weight and finally found a combination that
worked for them,'' Klem said.
<p>
   Some weight-loss experts said the findings parallel work from other
addiction fields, such as smoking cessation.
<p>
   ``Most people who quit smoking successfully do it on their own, and
we have learned that it takes four or five tries,'' said psychiatrist
Albert Stunkard, a weight-loss researcher at the University of
Pennsylvania. The weight registry study ``shows that persistence pays
off (in dieting),'' Stunkard said. ``It's a wonderful, optimistic
message and would be very nice to counter the terrible pessimistic
message that people can't lose weight.''
<p>
   ``This is a superb study,'' Stunkard said. ``It confirms earlier
smaller studies in a very dramatic way with this large sample size.''
<p>
   People in the study were recruited from national advertisements in
newspapers and magazines for people who had successfully lost weight
and kept it off. The researchers then confirmed the weight loss in a
variety of ways, including documentation from participants'
physicians, interviews with family members or friends and photographs.
<p>
   The majority of participants in the survey came from families that
had a tendency to be overweight, a fact that placed them at higher
risk of becoming heavy themselves.
<p>
   All the people in the study were veteran dieters who had attempted
nearly everything to shed unwanted pounds.
<p>
   ``Let me count the ways I've tried to lose weight,'' said Johari
Rashad, who works at the Department of Labor and has successfully
trimmed more than 67 pounds from her 5-foot-3-inch frame. She tried a
commercial weight-loss program that helped at first but then lost its
effect. ``I've done a modified fast that didn't work ... and in one of
my really crazy days, I took liquid protein that really didn't work
and was dangerous besides.''
<p>
   Yet it was often these failures to control their weight that helped
participants in the registry manage to figure out how to successfully
shed pounds and keep them off.
<p>
   Nearly all participants  &MD;  some 77 percent  &MD;  said they had a strong
impetus for launching their weight-reduction course. For about a third
of the participants, the trigger was a relatively minor health
problem, such as varicose veins, sleep apnea, low-back pain, aching
legs or simply fatigue caused by their extra pounds.
<p>
   Dieters often search for the perfect way to lose weight and keep it
off. But the study found that there was no one successful route to
shedding pounds. ``It's further condemnation of the faddish diet
books,'' said Kelly Brownell, a professor of psychology who studies
weight loss at Yale University.
<p>
   Each of their failed attempts, however, appeared to teach valuable
lessons about past diet mistakes and to familiarize the dieters with
weight-loss techniques that ultimately worked more effectively. No one
found any ``miracle method'' to lose weight.
<p>
   ``This may go back to the theory that when you're trying to change
behavior, you will try and fail, but if you try long enough you will
ultimately be successful,'' Klem said, noting that for this group ``it
took them until their 40s (and older) to get successful.''
<p>
   Nearly half of those in the registry lost weight on their own.
Slightly more than half the participants said they either consulted a
physician for help or joined organized weight-loss programs such as
Overeaters Anonymous, a 12-step program for compulsive eaters
patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous, and Weight Watchers, the
well-known commercial weight-loss system.
<p>
   Most simply did what diet experts have been advising for years:
They reduced the amount of calories that they ate and increased their
physical activity. Nearly all restricted their intake of certain types
or classes of foods, such as high-fat, high-calorie meals.
<p>
   Counting calories was important to about 40 percent of those who
succeeded in losing weight. So was keeping track of fat grams, a
technique employed by about 25 percent of those in the registry. About
20 percent used liquid diets to help curb their weight, but only 4
percent relied on any diet drugs, most of which were not available
when participants lost their unwanted pounds. The prescription weight
loss drug Redux, for example, was only approved for use last year by
the Food and Drug Administration.
<p>
   There was also a strong commitment to regular exercise, something
that other studies have found is key to successful weight loss as
well. People in the registry reported doing one to two activities
nearly every day and also made lifestyle changes such as walking
stairs rather than taking the elevator.
<p>
   One of the surprising results of the study was that a large
minority of the people in the registry found that maintaining weight
loss was easier than researchers expected. Slightly more than 40
percent of people in the weight registry said keeping off the pounds
was easier than actually shedding weight.

 &UR; Snore-Free Sleeping &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Physicians from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and
Neck Surgery, warn that snoring is not a condition to joke about.
Twenty-five percent of adults snore on a regular basis; 45 percent of
adults snore off and on.
<p>
   These noisy sounds signal that the sleeper may suffer from
excessive bulkiness of throat tissue or obstructed nasal passages, a
problem that could be life-threatening if not treated. For the light
snorer, physicians recommend sleeping on the side, avoiding alcohol
and heavy food for a few hours before bedtime and maintaining regular
sleep patterns.

<p>
   HARTFORD, Conn.  &MD;  Chef Billy Grant recently ran a cod special at
his Restaurant Bricco in West Hartford. He recommends buying
Prosciutto di Parma at specialty stores.
<p>
    &UR; RESTAURANT BRICCO'S COD FISH WRAPPED WITH PROSCIUTTO di PARMA
BEANS
<p>
   1½ cups flageolet or white beans
<p>
   Water
<p>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
<p>
   1 clove garlic, smashed
<p>
   1 onion, finely diced
<p>
   2 medium carrots, diced
<p>
   1 rib celery, diced
<p>
   1 leek, trimmed, washed and sliced thin
<p>
   Fresh thyme
<p>
   1 cup Chardonnay
<p>
   Extra virgin olive oil (if needed)
<p>
   6 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced
<p>
   6 basil leaves, finely sliced
<p>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
<p>
   FISH
<p>
   6 8-ounce cod fish fillets (center cut, from the thickest part of
the
<p>
   fillet, or ``captain's cut'' are best)
<p>
   Freshly cracked black pepper
<p>
   Kosher salt
<p>
   Fresh thyme
<p>
   Fresh sage
<p>
   About 9 paper-thin slices of Prosciutto di Parma
<p>
   Olive oil
<p>
   SAUCE:
<p>
   1 shallot, diced
<p>
   1½ cups Chardonnay
<p>
   ¼ cup bean broth
<p>
   ¼ cup reserved bean broth
<p>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
<p>
   Rinse and wash beans; remove any stones. Soak beans overnight in a
large pot with water to cover by 1 inch, changing water once or twice.
<p>
   The next day, drain the beans. In a large saute pan, heat 3
tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Saute the garlic and onion
until onion is almost translucent. Add carrots, celery, leeks and
about 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme (leaves only). Saute until
vegetables are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add Chardonnay,
beans and enough water to cover all. Simmer the mixture until beans
are cooked through. (They should not be ``al dente,'' but quite tender
to the bite.) Drain the bean and vegetable mix, reserving the bean
broth. (This may be done 1 day ahead of serving. Store the beans and
liquid separately in the refrigerator overnight.
<p>
   Drizzle the beans with some olive oil so they won't dry out. Next
day, reheat beans on low heat before serving, and thin with some bean
broth if they look dry.)
<p>
   To serve the beans: Heat the bean mixture with ½ cup of reserved
bean broth. Add tomatoes and fresh basil, and cook over low heat until
broth is evaporated or absorbed. Add butter and stir to combine.
<p>
   To prepare the fish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season each
fillet with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with fresh thyme and sage.
Wrap each cod fillet in prosciutto, wrapping it tightly to keep it
secure.
<p>
   Set a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of
olive oil. When oil is hot but not smoking, add cod fillets, sealed
side down, and brown, about 2 minutes on each side. (Do not crowd them
or they will not brown. Cook in batches if necessary.) Transfer
fillets to an oven-proof pan, and place pan in oven. Roast until cod
is just cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of
the fillets.
<p>
   While fish is roasting, make the sauce: Drain oil from the skillet
and add diced shallot and cook 1 minute. Deglaze the pan by adding 1½
cups Chardonnay. Reduce the liquid to ¼ cup. Add ¼ cup of reserved
bean broth, and reduce a bit. Whisk in butter, and season with salt
and pepper.
<p>
   To serve: Spoon a mound of bean stew on each of 6 plates. Set a cod
fillet atop each one, and drizzle with Chardonnay sauce. Serve
immediately. Serves 6.
<p>
   Chef Patty Queen at the Cottage Restaurant in Plainville provided
this recipe. ``Classic New England chowder is not thickened. You can
leave out the flour and butter or add more depending on your personal
tastes,'' she says.
<p>
    &UR; THE COTTAGE'S COD &AMP; CORN CHOWDER
<p>
   1/4 pound bacon or salt pork, diced small
<p>
   2 medium onions, cut into ½-inch dice
<p>
   2 bay leaves
<p>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
<p>
   ½ cup butter
<p>
   1/3 cup flour
<p>
   3 cups clam broth or juice, or chicken or fish stock
<p>
   5 potatoes, cut into ½-inch cubes
<p>
   6 ears fresh corn, kernels removed
<p>
   2 cups heavy cream
<p>
   2 pounds cod fillet, cut into 2-inch pieces
<p>
   Salt
<p>
   Freshly ground pepper
<p>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
<p>
   In a large soup kettle, saute the bacon or salt pork over medium
heat until slightly crisp and fat is rendered. Do not brown.
<p>
   Add the onion, bay leaves, thyme and butter and saute until onion
is translucent. Add flour, stirring constantly, and cook until flour
is well incorporated, about 3 minutes.
<p>
   Add broth or stock slowly, stirring constantly to prevent lumps
from forming. Add potatoes and corn and simmer until potatoes are
tender, about 12 minutes.
<p>
   Add the cod pieces and heavy cream, simmering until cod flakes
apart. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with
parsley. Serves 6.
<p>
   Apricots chef Jeff Gantkin took a fusion approach with delicious
results.
<p>
    &UR; APRICOTS PAN-FRIED COD WITH LIGHT EGG BATTER AND SOY-GINGER
<p>
   DIPPING SAUCE
<p>
   1 pound cod, cut into 2 fillets
<p>
   1 egg
<p>
   ¼ cup flour
<p>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
<p>
   SAUCE:
<p>
   1 tablespoon ginger, cut into matchstick pieces
<p>
   1 teaspoon chopped garlic
<p>
   1 tablespoon sugar
<p>
   1 tablespoon white wine
<p>
   2 scallions, chopped
<p>
   ¼ cup good quality soy sauce
<p>
   ¼ cup rice wine vinegar
<p>
   ¼ cup water
<p>
   Pinch crushed red pepper flakes
<p>
   Combine the sauce ingredients, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
Set aside.
<p>
   Dredge fish fillets in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg.
<p>
   Set a skillet over medium heat and add canola oil. When oil is hot
but not smoking, add fillets and cook until browned on both sides.
Cook until fish is done to your liking. Serve cod with stir-fried
vegetables and rice. Serves 2.

   David E. Curtis, chef at Pika Tapas Cafe in New Haven, Conn., uses
salt cod to create the restaurant's codfish croquettes and
``piquillo'' peppers stuffed with cod.
<p>
    &UR; PIKA TAPAS CAFE'S CODFISH CROQUETTES WITH ALIOLI
<p>
   (CROQUETAS DE BACALAO CON ALIOLI)
<p>
   1 cup mayonnaise
<p>
   4 cloves garlic
<p>
   Juice of ½ lemon
<p>
   Pinch salt
<p>
   ¼ teaspoon Tabasco
<p>
   4 sprigs parsley, washed and coarsely chopped
<p>
   CROQUETTES
<p>
   3 pounds salt cod
<p>
   ½ pound butter
<p>
   ¾ pound flour
<p>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
<p>
   1 onion, diced
<p>
   6 cloves garlic, sliced
<p>
   ½ cup white wine
<p>
   1 quart milk
<p>
   Salt and white pepper, to taste
<p>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (leaves only)
<p>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
<p>
   FOR FRYING
<p>
   Flour, for dredging
<p>
   3 eggs, beaten
<p>
   Bread crumbs
<p>
   Canola or vegetable oil, for frying
<p>
   Making the alioli:
<p>
   Place all ingredients in a food processor and pulse to combine
until garlic and parsley are finely pureed. Keep refrigerated until
ready to use.
<p>
   Soak cod in cool water for 24 to 36 hours, changing the water 3 or
4 times. Remove cod and drain. Remove skin and bones, and cut into
small strips. Set aside.
<p>
   In a saute pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add flour,
stirring to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
until mixture is light brown. Remove from heat and let cool.
<p>
   Set a saucepan over medium heat, and add olive oil, onion and
garlic. Cook until onions are translucent. Do not brown. Add wine, and
cook until volume is reduced by three-quarters. Add milk and bring
mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer (if the milk separates,
don't be concerned). Whisk in the butter-and-flour mixture, a heaping
spoonful at a time, until you have a very thick paste. Simmer for 10
to 15 minutes.
<p>
   Fold in the codfish strips, and remove mixture from heat. Transfer
mixture in batches to the bowl of a food processor or an electric
mixer, and process until somewhat smooth (do not puree it entirely).
Season mixture with salt and white pepper to taste. Add herbs, and mix
to combine.
<p>
   Transfer mixture to a cookie sheet and let cool in the
refrigerator. When mixture is cool enough to handle, roll it into
1-inch balls.
<p>
   When ready to cook, dredge croquettes in flour, dip in beaten eggs
and roll in bread crumbs. Set a skillet or deep fryer over medium heat
and add enough olive oil to make it about 1-inch deep. When oil is
hot, fry the croquettes until golden on all sides. (Do this in
batches, and do not crowd the croquettes or they will not brown.)
Drain on paper towels, and serve with alioli.
<p>
   Makes about 50 pieces. Serve 8 pieces with a dollop of alioli as an
appetizer serving.

 &UR; Pity the Poor, Misunderstood Cod (Hartford) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HARTFORD, Conn.  &MD;  Mention cod and grown-ups clamp their lips shut
like little children.
<p>
   Their mental movie theaters flashes a montage of horrors: cod liver
oil, smelly slabs of dry salt cod, a mother standing with a fork
poised before tightly pursed lips.
<p>
   Poor cod has been misunderstood, misjudged and needlessly maligned.
<p>
   Perhaps if it weren't so inexpensive and common, cod would be
elevated to higher stature.
<p>
   Champions of the great North Atlantic white fish range from Julia
Child to Connecticut's Mark Bittman, author of the encyclopedic
``Fish,'' as well as many of the area's top chefs.
<p>
   ``If cod were rare, it would be a luxury item, treasured for its
snow white, delicate flesh and subtle but far from characterless
flavor,'' writes Bittman, whose book includes 16 recipes for cod
dishes.
<p>
   ``It's not that cod is a humble fish, it's just been neglected,''
opined Child in a recent TV Food Network appearance.
<p>
   Cod is the largest of a family of fish that includes pollock,
haddock, whiting and hake. It is a round fish with a tan- or
khaki-colored back, small yellow-brown spots, a white belly and a
telltale barbel under its chin. It can grow to a length of 3 to 4 feet
and weigh up to 100 pounds.
<p>
   The modern aversion to cod is a remarkable display of mankind's
disregard for history. The fish played a crucial role in the survival
of early settlers, and the cod fishing industry spawned economic
development in the nations bordering the Atlantic.
<p>
   But the truth is in the taste, and here, the lowly cod deserves the
highest heraldry.
<p>
   ``It's a really versatile fish,'' says David E. Curtis, chef at New
Haven's Pika Tapas Cafe. ``It's not an oily fish by any stretch, it's
not got a really strong fishy flavor on it. It's a basic fish so you
don't have to get real elaborate and try to overpower it.''
<p>
   Bittman calls cod ``the pig of the sea,'' noting that almost every
part of it  &MD;  from the pristine fillets to the air bladders, cheeks and
tongues  &MD;  can be consumed (and are consumed in less finicky cultures).
<p>
   Cod is equally delicious fried, sauteed, poached, baked, stuffed or
roasted (grilling is a bit tricky as the fish tends to flake apart).
In England, it is synonymous with the national dish of fish and chips;
in France, it is the backbone of ``brandade,'' that comforting mound
of fish and mashed potatoes; in Spain, salt cod is used to make
``croquetas'' or it is pureed and stuffed inside tangy piquillo
peppers; in Portugal, cod is served with fried potatoes, or it is
scrambled with eggs and onions.
<p>
   When buying fresh cod for home cooking, most chefs recommend
starting at a good fish market. From there, freshness can be assessed
by the appearance of the fish or fillet. If you see a whole fish, ``it
should have really clear eyes and red gills, says Curtis. ``Any touch
of brownness or spottiness shouldn't be acceptable.'' If you are
buying fillets, the fish should be glistening white with no grayness
or dryness at the edges. Buyers also should avoid dull, watery looking
cuts. ``If you can press the meat and there's a lot of water, it means
they've soaked it to get the smell off,'' Curtis warns.
<p>
   Salt cod is available in some ethnic stores, but generally is
harder to come by. ``The good thing is it lasts forever,'' Curtis
jokes.

   It wasn't your everyday picnic. Instead of shorts and jeans, some
of the women wore sarongs. Tables were covered with exotic Asian
fabrics. And the food was even more exotic  &MD;  chicken smothered in
spices, noodle salad with mango dressing, jasmine rice flavored with
coconut and served in an antique silver bowl from northern Thailand.
<p>
   Although the look and the flavors were tropical, the location was
Southern California, the home of Molly Kellogg and her husband, Mark
Brownstein.
<p>
   This was a Myanmar party, a potluck dinner staged by the newly
formed Myanmar Arts Council of the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena.
The music, most of the guests and most of the food were Burmese.
<p>
   Betty Wiechec and her husband Don, who regularly travel to Myanmar
to take photographs for a book on the country. They brought the
mango-dressed noodle salad. ``We had something similar in Bagan at a
wonderful place named River View that overlooks the Irrawady (now
Ayeyarwaddy River),'' says Betty Wiechec. ``We ate there every day and
every night that we were in Bagan.''
<p>
   Leilei Thein, who was about to leave for Myanmar, prepared chicken
curry in the style of Mawlamyine, (formerly Moulmein), where she grew
up. The chicken was juicy with ground onion and yogurt. ``In Burma,
chickens are not soft, like here,'' she says. ``Marinating with yogurt
makes the chicken tastier and more tender.''
<p>
   A raft of spices, including an awesome amount of cumin, goes into
this dish. Nevertheless, the flavor is mellow, not dominated by
spices, and the yogurt adds a pleasing tang. Thein brought tea from
Shan state for after dinner.
<p>
   Nilar Bellas, who performed a folk dance from her home city,
Yangon, brought rice seasoned with cinnamon sticks, cinnamon tree
leaves (similar to bay leaves) and barely detectable amounts of curry
powder, cumin and sugar. The effect was subtle, perfumed, intriguing.
<p>
   Such rice is a festival dish in Myanmar, she says, and is presented
as an offering to monks. Bellas prepares it in typical Asian fashion,
measuring liquid levels with a finger joint and adding sprinkles of
water until the rice attains proper consistency.
<p>
   Other contributions included chicken red with hot spices and a
salad that combined homemade fish cake with cabbage, fried onions,
fried garlic and chiles. There were a few interlopers, such as Thai
fish cakes and a Japanese red bean dessert. But Malaysian noodles were
pure Myanmar, having been acquired long ago from Malays living on the
southern coast around Mergui (now called Bak) and incorporated into
Burmese cuisine.
<p>
   An expert at cooking as well as gardening, Brownstein provided
desserts: a spiced apple cranberry crumble, a crust-free lemon-lime
pie and coconut pudding. Were these Burmese? Of course not, but nobody
seemed to mind as they wiped the dishes clean.

   Here are easy recipes kids should like. The first two are from the
American Heart Association.
<p>
    &UR; PEANUT BUTTER KISSES &QL; 
<p>
   1/3 cup peanut butter
<p>
   1/3 cup honey
<p>
   1 cup nonfat dry milk powder
<p>
   Mix ingredients and roll into one-inch balls. If too sticky,
increase powdered milk. Serves 12.
<p>
    &UR; STRAWBERRY-BANANA SMOOTHIE &QL; 
<p>
   1 medium banana, peeled and frozen
<p>
   1 cup strawberries, fresh or frozen
<p>
   1 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt
<p>
   Blend ingredients on high speed in blender of food processor. Keep
chilled. Serves one.
<p>
    &UR; EASY CHEESY ROLL-UPS &QL; 
<p>
   2 tablespoons reduced fat cream cheese
<p>
   1 whole wheat tortilla
<p>
   1½ tablespoons crushed pineapple
<p>
   1½ tablespoons chopped walnuts, almonds or cashews
<p>
   leaf lettuce
<p>
   4 slices thinly sliced honey ham
<p>
   Spread cream cheese on tortilla. Sprinkle with pineapple and nuts.
Layer with lettuce and ham. Roll up tortilla. Cut in half or into
bite-sized pieces. Serves one.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Prepare and freeze meat and cheese sandwiches ahead of time. Remove
from your freezer as necessary. They'll thaw by lunchtime.
<p>
   Have breakfast for lunch. Fortified cereal bars, like Kellogg's
NutriGrain, and mini-boxes of cereal, or cereal in a sandwich bag,
pair nicely with milk in a kid's lunch box.
<p>
   Keep small pop top cans of fruit on hand to toss into lunches when
you run out of fresh fruits.
<p>
   If you have the energy, pack lunch while you're making dinner.
You're already in the kitchen.
<p>
   Stow juice boxes in your freezer. As the juice box thaws, it'll
keep perishables chilled all morning. (Thawing time is roughly four
hours.)

 &UR; Kids' Lunches Can Be Appealing and Healthy &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The moment I spotted that first back-to-school lunch box display in
July, my dread became palpable. What on earth would I pack in my kids'
lunch boxes this year? I averted my eyes and hurried on to the
sale-priced sunscreen.
<p>
   Now that my three have boarded the school bus again, I'm faced with
a second-grader who hates sandwiches and a third-grader who rejects
pretzels and wants Pringles. (``All my friends get to have them,'' he
argues.) Only my kindergartner accepts the contents of her new
Winnie-the-Pooh lunch box without complaints, and I predict her
attitude won't last past the first teacher workday.
<p>
   Help. I need new lunch ideas. No cutesy foods, like mini-pizzas
sporting zucchini noses and bell pepper smiles, and no sandwiches
shaped like footballs or gingerbread men. Give me kid appeal, but make
it something healthy that I can put together without calamity before
our 8:15 a.m. bolt to the bus stop.
<p>
   For inspiration, I turned to some licensed dietitians in the area,
the Internet, school-aged kids on my block and a family magazine.
<p>
   From the dietitians, I culled some healthy ground rules.
<p>
   Lunch ought to include a protein, a couple of servings of
carbohydrate, some fruit, and a dairy product, says Kelly O'Connor,
chief clinical dietitian at Greater Baltimore Medical Center.
Together, they'll quell hunger, boost energy levels and keep minds
alert through the afternoon.
<p>
   Yes, a peanut butter sandwich, a box of raisins and a carton of
milk fill the bill, she says, recalling the lunch her mom packed
incessantly when she was a kid. But to prevent boredom, try a
snacklike meal of air-popped popcorn, cheese cubes, ready-peeled baby
carrots, and fruit juice. Or try pairing milk with a soft pretzel and
fruit or trail mix made with cereal, pretzel sticks, peanuts, dried
fruit and a few M&AMP;Ms.
<p>
   It's smart to include some treats with the healthy stuff, says
Denise Schuffman, a dietitian. She doesn't forbid any food outright.
In fact, she says things like potato chips or chocolate chip cookies  &MD; 
in moderation  &MD;  belong in a child's lunch.
<p>
   ``If kids don't get them in their own lunch box, they'll get them
from someone else's or at a friend's house after school,'' Schuffman
says. ``If you provide them, your child won't feel deprived or want to
sneak things.''
<p>
   Susan Hunter Schulze, a consulting dietitian at GBMC who also
teaches nutrition at Towson University, is blessed with children
who'll eat strips of green pepper and carrots at lunch. She's too busy
for cookie cutter sandwiches or lunches with a theme, but she
confesses to preparing and freezing homebaked blueberry muffins for
her son.
<p>
   ``It sends that he-knows-that-I-care message,'' she says.
<p>
   If Hunter Schulze has a mantra, it's this: Know the nutrition
content of what you pack. For example, she says, there isn't any
vitamin C in Capri Sun, there's no milk in a YooHoo, and Oscar Mayer
Lunchables are loaded with fat. Those are treats and should be
limited, she says. For the majority of your kids' lunches, stick with
100 percent fruit juice, make your own chocolate milk, and assemble
your own lunch kit. You'll control fat, sugar and preservatives.
<p>
   Kids get too much of that stuff, says Roxanne Moore, the community
dietitian at St. Joseph's Medical Center. They need more whole-grained
foods, she says, so build lunches around different breads, muffins,
low-sugar cereals, rice cakes, baked tortillas, pretzels, fig bars,
graham crackers and animal crackers. Wraps are in, she notes, so fill
a baked tortilla with meat, cheese or a dab of peanut butter and
raisins. Then, roll your child a healthy lunch.
<p>
   My on-line search netted similar ideas. Using key words ``lunch box
ideas kids,'' I reached a Seattle hospital's newsletter, which
recommended packing small servings of different types of foods. That
way, a kid is less likely to toss or trade away a whole food group.
<p>
   An American Dietetic Association's ``Hot Topics'' page suggested
that parents get their kids involved in lunch food choices. That's
supposed to encourage them to eat a variety of foods. Use a grocery
expedition to teach your children about the food pyramid, the page
suggests. For more nutrition information from the ADA, call
800-366-1655.
<p>
   Finally, from the neighborhood kids, I gleaned what I consider the
fundamentals of good lunch box packing: Know what they like, and stick
with it.
<p>
   Joy, the second-grader across the street, definitely wants that
same old mustard and American cheese sandwich with a container of
applesauce every day until winter break. Come Valentine's Day, she'll
be ready to switch to a ham sandwich. Rebecca, the seasoned
fourth-grader next door, is open to a variety of healthy selections,
so long as they don't include a turkey sandwich. Her advice to those
stuffing lunch bags this morning?
<p>
   ``Ask your kids what they want. Maybe break it down into ... fruit,
dessert and sandwiches.''
<p>
   That's precisely one of the suggestions from Family Fun Magazine.
In a spread featuring readers' suggestions, the September issue
showcases a chart from Liz Ruff of West Chester, Pa. It's displayed
prominently in her kitchen and is written on a chalkboard so it can be
easily changed to suit a child's fickle tastes.

 &UR; Things Were Cooking at This Summer Camp &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   When Steve Taylor remembers summer camp, he doesn't recall poison
ivy, archery or square knots. He thinks about making challah bread and
blueberry pie for 300 people.
<p>
   As a 13-year-old at the Episcopal Church camp his father directed
in Charlton Depot, Mass., Taylor passed up canoeing lessons and took
to hanging around in the camp's kitchen, where as an ``underchef'' he
first learned that quality is better than quantity.
<p>
   He's been dedicated to serving outstanding food ever since.
<p>
   ``Quality and consistency are the hallmark of excellence,'' he says
firmly.
<p>
   Now, with 24 years of cooking experience under his belt, including
classical training at the Culinary Institute of America and chef's
positions at various four-star restaurants around the country, this
Fallston, Md.-based basement waterproofing entrepreneur and father of
four knows what it takes to cook something delicious.
<p>
   That's why his renovated farmhouse kitchen has a six-burner gas
range, double ovens and tons of counter space. He saves his commercial
kitchen, which he built into one of his barns, for parties, weddings
and major events.
<p>
   ``I like to cook dinner,'' says Taylor, who describes his style as
``Continental with a Swiss flair.'' He admits that he uses a lot of
butter in his sauces, but doesn't seem to care. This chef, attentive
to every detail and nuance of flavor, won't serve anything that
doesn't taste good  &MD;  healthful or not  &MD;  although he refrains from
making cream sauces too often. What does he hate? He quotes a former
mentor: ``a steak that is battleship gray.''
<p>
   He likes to prepare salmon or fresh Maine lobster dishes with
vegetables and has concocted a wedding cake or two. His favorite
wedding-cake recipe is a filled chocolate sauvignon cake.
<p>
   His children, 8, 7, 5, and 3 years old, gobble up his
fresh-vegetable pasta, which he developed as a ``refrigerator
cleaner.'' He makes it by topping off bow-tie pasta with carrots, corn
and broccoli, which he disguises in a tasty beef sauce. Here is
Taylor's recipe:
<p>
    &UR; PASTA RENWICK &QL; 
<p>
   1 pound package bow-tie pasta
<p>
   1 cup diced carrots
<p>
   1 cup broccoli florets
<p>
   12-ounce can of corn
<p>
   4 ounces diced or shredded cooked chicken
<p>
   4 ounces crab meat or shrimp
<p>
   2 garlic cloves, mashed
<p>
   2 tablespoons maple syrup
<p>
   ½ cup beef bouillon or beef stock
<p>
   a pinch of leaf thyme
<p>
   a pinch of leaf marjoram
<p>
   Cook pasta in boiling salted water, drain and rinse, dry well and
coat with 3-4 tablespoons olive oil, then set aside.
<p>
   Blanch carrots and broccoli (separately) in salted water, then
saute briefly (separately) in 1-2 tablespoons of butter.
<p>
   Add maple syrup, thyme and marjoram to carrots, and toss. Steam
broccoli with beef stock, and season to taste with salt, pepper and
sugar, then set aside.
<p>
   Saute the crab meat or shrimp in 1-2 tablespoons of butter over
medium heat, being careful not to brown. Season with salt and white
pepper and set aside.
<p>
   Heat corn in a small pan, season with white pepper and set aside.
Be sure to keep the pans hot and the food moving.
<p>
   Heat large saute pan with 2-4 tablespoons of olive oil and saute
pasta until hot, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
<p>
   Add fresh garlic and toss, and then add the carrots, broccoli,
corn, chicken and seafood (strain all liquid, except the carrots,
before adding).
<p>
   Saute until hot. Season sparingly, to taste.

   GOT HEARTBURN? The California Milk Processors Board, the ``Got
Milk?'' people, claim there's scientific evidence that casein, the
principal protein in milk, removes the hot chemical in chiles from the
mouth, thus providing immediate relief. Hmm, since one touch of that
hot chemical (actually, it's five related chemicals known as
capsaicinoids) causes pain nerves to send distress signals for six
minutes, this is a little hard to believe. Still, with a mouth full of
habaneros, you have to believe in something.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Baylor College of Medicine reports that drinking milk to
soothe heartburn might provide temporary relief but can actually
worsen the problem. Heartburn is an upwelling of acidic gastric juices
from the stomach into the esophagus, and yes, milk will wash the acid
back down into the stomach. But down there it will cause more acid,
and you'll get another heartburn.
<p>
   Not wanting to seem to hard on milk, the college also warns that
peppermints are no cure for heartburn. They can neutralize the acid in
the esophagus and stimulate salivation, which also helps clear acid
from the esophagus, but it turns out that peppermints weaken the
valve-like sphincter muscle at the base of the esophagus that serves
as a lid on the stomach. Then, oops: heartburn.

 &UR; VINTAGE POINT: Hungary's Dessert Nectar Making a Comeback &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   For more than 40 years, Tokaji Aszu was a great wine in chains.
When Hungary came under Communist rule after World War II, the
individual wine estates that produced one of the world's classic
dessert wines were absorbed into a vast state monopoly.
<p>
   Competition ceased, and standards plunged. Winemaking decisions
were made by bureaucrats rather than artisans. Tokaji Aszu  &MD;  known in
English-speaking countries as Tokay  &MD;  all but disappeared from the
world's finest tables.
<p>
   But the 1989 collapse of the Berlin Wall sent ripples through every
wine cask in the ancient wine-growing region of Tokaji. The
post-Communist government has moved boldly to dismantle the monopoly
and open its wine industry to foreign investment and ideas.
<p>
   Now, to taste Tokay is to taste freedom itself. Seldom has a type
of wine changed so dramatically for the better in the space of a few
vintages.
<p>
   In its decades under Communist rule, Tokay had taken on a highly
unusual character. A high level of oxidation  &MD;  comparable to some
sherries  &MD;  had become part of its identity. The wines were rough and
harsh, but still oddly fascinating.
<p>
   The new dessert wines of Tokay are noticeably different, even
before the cork is pulled. Gone is the deep copper color of the state
monopoly's Tokays. In its place is a deep golden nectar. Traces of
oxidation remain, but the dominant flavors come from the fresh,
honeyed fruit.
<p>
   Tokaji Aszu is a white dessert wine produced primarily from two
traditional Hungarian grapes, the furmint and the harslevelu. Like
Sauternes and the top dessert wines of Germany, its sweetness and
flavors are intensified by the use of grapes shriveled by the ``noble
rot'' botrytis.
<p>
   Dessert tokay is graded by its sweetness  &MD;  from three to six
puttonyos (an ancient measure of how many nobly rotten grapes are
included in the blend). There is also a supersweet version called
Tokaji Aszu Escenzia, a great rarity, and an even sweeter nectar
called Essence  &MD;  more legend than commercial reality.
<p>
   The prospect of participating in the renaissance of one of the
world's legendary wines has attracted wine-industry stars, including
Michael Rolland, a celebrated Bordeaux enologist, at Chateau Megyer,
and Jean-Michel Cazes, owner of Chateau Lynch-Bages, at Disznoko.
<p>
   The challenge is daunting: to bring Tokay back into the mainstream
of the world's great wines without sacrificing its unique character.
Judging by the results at Megyer and Disznoko, they are succeeding
admirably.
<p>
   The difference is dramatic when one tastes an old-style Tokay
beside one of the new versions.
<p>
   The 1984 Tokaji Aszu 4 Puttonyos from the old monopoly producer
Hungarovin ($17) displays aggressive burnt-caramel flavors that
dominate the nuances of orange, orange peel and spice. There's still
something compelling about the wine, though the finish is thin and the
remaining sweetness isn't enough to balance out the screeching
acidity.
<p>
   By contrast, the 1992 Disznoko Tokaji Aszu 4 Puttonyos ($21) offers
a fresh and lively blend of orange, peach, apricot, honey and spice
flavors, with just the merest hint of oxidation. The
characteristically high acidity is balanced admirably by medium-sweet
fruit. (Tokay, old and new, is generally sold in 500-milliliter
bottles, two-thirds the size of the standard wine bottle.)
<p>
   Less sweet but a shade more complex is the 1990 Chateau Megyer
Tokaji Aszu 3 Puttonyos ($16). The flavors are quite similar to the
Disznoko, but are more vibrant and persistent  &MD;  perhaps a result of
the extra bottle age.
<p>
   The 1988 Chateau Megyer Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos ($23) shows a fiery
quality that is quite distinctive. Apricot and honey flavors blend
with lemon and tropical spice to achieve an impressive complexity.
<p>
   The 1992 Disznoko 5 Puttonyos ($27) is brilliantly structured but
will need a decade in the bottle to let its flavors come together.
<p>
   The crowning glory of the tasting was the 1993 Disznoko 6 Puttonyos
($32). This luscious, honeyed wine is jampacked with flavors of
apricot, peach, spices, honey and caramel. The other new-style Tokays
are encouraging signs, but this is a complex, layered, fully realized
nectar that proves post-Communist Hungary is on its way back as a
wine-producing nation.

<p>
   You'll want to put poached pears in your ``light, lovely, delicious
and easy-to-make'' file.
<p>
   Jean Beecher of Walla Walla, Wash., wrote that she has been looking
for a poached-pear recipe for some time now, and she would surely
appreciate help.

   Chef Kent Rigby chose recipes from Virginia S. Hodges and Jo Ann M.
Nuetzel, both of Baltimore.

<p>
   1 cup sugar
<p>
   8 or 9 whole cloves
<p>
   Peel pears, leaving whole with stems intact. Press a whole clove in
each pear bottom. Simmer wine, water and sugar in a saucepan, stirring
until combined. Stand pears in liquid and poach covered for about 30
minutes or until tender. Chill pears in liquid, drain and serve with
zabaglione sauce.

   Hodges notes that the Bosc pears, ``which I get at the Giant  &MD;  they

they are firmer than the Bartlett pear. Also, I sometimes slice the
pears in half and poach cut side down in the liquid.''

   Shirley McCoy of Crystal Lake, Ill., writes that she wants a
homemade soft caramel candy recipe. ``A man from our church made big
batches of them to sell at our church fair. You could chew them
without losing a tooth, and they had the greatest caramel, buttery
flavor, and he wrapped each piece in wax paper. He recently passed
away, and I'd like to carry on for him here but cannot find a recipe.
Would surely appreciate your help.''
<p>
   V. Wilcox of Lacey, Wash., wants help with a crumb base for a
dessert. ``In the '60s, Betty Crocker had a boxed date-bar mix which
this dessert called for, and it is no longer available. As I recall,
we baked the cookie base and crumbled it for the bottom and top of
this dessert and added some whipped cream and instant coffee for the
filling. It was layered and could be frozen. I'm stumped. Do you think
anyone would have a recipe for a dessert like this and the crumb
base?''
<p>
   Ann S. Bish of Fallston, Md. writes that she'd like to find a good
recipe for making green tomato pickle, ``or even a store which sells
them already processed.''

 &UR; RUSH HOUR REMEDY: Campbell's Restaurant Soup a Pricey Wannabe &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Item: Campbell's Restaurant Soup
<p>
   What you get: 7 to 8 servings or 28 to 32 ounces, depending on
variety
<p>
   Cost: $6.49
<p>
   Time to prepare: 20-30 minutes stovetop or 12 to 20 minutes
microwave (depending on variety of soup)
<p>
   Review: I think Campbell's ought to rethink this one. The display
in my grocer's frozen food section promised restaurant taste from
flavors like New England clam chowder and tomato pasta Florentine. But
I found these frozen soups on a par with condensed soup from a can,
and I certainly didn't want to buy seven or eight servings at once.
Avoid this pricey and inconvenient wannabe (12 to 20 minutes, even in
the microwave?), and reach for a can of Campbell's canned chunky soup
when you need a break from tomato or chicken noodle.

 &UR; FORKLORE: French Lesson: It's Batter Up for the Pancake &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Fifteen years ago, a French tourist guidebook expressed shock at
the American idea of breakfast: ``Their crepes are over a centimeter
thick!'' This was almost more horrifying to the writer than what we
put on our ``crepes,'' a syrup made from tree sap.
<p>
   The French writer should really get out more. Many of the world's
pancakes are thicker and, well, more cake-like than a French crepe.
Crepe-like pancakes are mostly used for wrapping stuff in; pancakes
eaten by themselves tend to be thick.
<p>
   Pancakes are made from batter, rather than from a kneaded dough
with a good gluten structure, so they often have eggs mixed in to keep
them from falling apart as they fry. Possibly because eggs didn't
often come their way, medieval Central Asian nomads made a pancake
called chalpak by kneading dough and then laboriously mixing in more
water to get a sort of glutinous batter.
<p>
   Thicker pancakes have usually been made with yeasted batter. The
Gold Rush miners who lived on bacon, coffee and sourdough flapjacks
were following an old tradition.
<p>
   However, Americans always have been impatient, and about 200 years
ago we invented baking soda for instant leavening. Hence the
buttermilk pancake; buttermilk provided the acidity to make the baking
soda work.
<p>
   But even that was too inconvenient, so we invented baking powder.
The first flour sold with baking powder already mixed in appeared in
1889 under the brand name Aunt Jemima. A woman named Nancy Green was
hired to be Aunt Jemima (making her possibly the world's first
spokesmodel) and served more than a million pancakes to visitors to
the Chicago World's Fair. She toured the country for the next 30
years.
<p>
   By the way, the reason foreign pancakes never taste quite right to
us is that we Americans are the only people who always put a dash of
corn meal in our pancake batter. &QL;

 &UR; ROSENBERG ON TV: This Time, `Defenders' Will Hold Court on Showtime &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   From ``Marty,'' ``Days of Wine and Roses'' and ``Dragnet'' to
``Mission: Impossible'' and the just-released ``Leave It to Beaver,''
theatrical movies have been doing television for decades.
<p>
   So it's only appropriate that TV should copy TV too.
<p>
   In a sense, it's done just that, cannibalizing itself through the
years like no other entertainment medium. ``The Fugitive,'' starring
Harrison Ford, for example, was a successful feature-film remake of
Quinn Martin's ABC hit of the 1960s that itself became a prototype for
scores of man-on-the-lam series.
<p>
   Now it's Showtime, in association with Paramount, making some of us
happy by again drawing on the past with a series of movies reinventing
that scintillating old CBS legal series, ``The Defenders''  &MD;  with E.G.
Marshall, now 87, reprising the idealistic attorney he introduced in
1961. This time, though, no love interest.
<p>
   ``The Fugitive'' gave life to a concept that will surely resonate
on TV into the next millennium. How curious that Reginald Rose's ``The
Defenders,'' which arrived as a regular series just two years before
``The Fugitive,'' resonated so fleetingly. And no one quite knows why.
<p>
   Although widely celebrated, and enormously bold and cutting-edge on
legal and moral issues for its time, ``The Defenders'' seems to have
quietly vanished from the U.S. airwaves after ending its prime-time
run in 1965.
<p>
   ``These 132 hours of television were sitting in the vaults back
East some place,'' said Stan Rogow, executive producer for the
Showtime ``Defenders'' movies  &MD;  the first of which airs Oct. 12. A
second one has also been shot, Rogow said, and scripts are being
written for two more.
<p>
   An attorney himself, Rogow said that ``The Defenders'' is ``the
show that made me go to law school.'' He had been asking for years,
``Why can't we make `The Defenders?''' only to be told there was a
``rights problem.'' As it turned out, Paramount, where Rogow had a TV
development deal, held three-sevenths of the TV rights, he said, with
Rose, the show's creator, retaining the balance.
<p>
   Rose, who lives in Connecticut, is no stranger to Showtime: A
successful new version of his durable play, ``12 Angry Men,'' ran on
the pay-cable network two weeks ago. He is listed as a co-writer and
consultant for Showtime's ``The Defenders.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Although Showtime liked the notion of ``The Defenders'' as a sort
of TV-movie franchise, Rogow said he was turned down by the major
networks when he pitched it to them as a new series. Still in their
minds, apparently, were the O.J. Simpson case and lingering public
attitudes about the law and defense attorneys.
<p>
   ``No one was interested because it was about a defense lawyer,''
said Rogow. ``It was the networks' perception that the public wanted
to see shows about people being put behind bars.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   What has the United States been missing all these years? When it
comes to ``The Defenders'' series, something special.
<p>
   It began as a Rose-written play on ``Studio One'' in 1957, and,
when turned into a series four years later, still retained an aura
recalling TV anthologies of that era. ``The writers and the actors
were all people in New York at that time doing `Studio One' and
`Playhouse 90,''' said Rogow. ``It had a stature and tone to it, and
nothing like that is done anymore.''
<p>
   Not quite like that, anyway, even though today's prime time has no
shortage of quality legal series, led by NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order.''
<p>
   ``The Defenders,'' though, was about a small law firm consisting of
the widowed veteran Lawrence Preston (Marshall) and his son, Kenneth,
a recent law school graduate, played by Robert Reed. With Reed now
dead, Beau Bridges assumes second chair in the Showtime movies as
Preston's younger son, and Martha Plimpton is the firm's third member,
playing Kenneth's daughter, a former prosecutor.
<p>
   They have a lot to live up to. There were no shiny suits in the
original. Instead, both Prestons wore their ethics proudly and had
high principles.
<p>
   The casts often included actors who went on to become big stars,
and the scripts were personalized and intimate. In addition, what
distinguished ``The Defenders'' was its courage in embracing a range
of controversial topics  &MD;  from abortion, mercy killing and political
blacklisting  &MD;  rarely addressed by the timid TV entertainment of that
age. What's more, their cases sometimes ended as ambiguously as issues
do in life. And unlike Perry Mason, the Prestons were fallible in the
courtroom, losing on more than one occasion.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   ``I remember one episode,'' said Rogow, ``that started with Dustin
Hoffman throwing a ball against a wall. There was a racket upstairs,
and the camera pans up there, where Ruth Roman has gotten into an
argument with her husband. She shoots him, and the Prestons defend
her. They tried the abuse excuse  &MD;  this was only 1961  &MD;  and they lost.
At the end of the show, she goes to the gas chamber.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Controversy typifies the Showtime movies, too. ``The Defenders:
Payback'' finds the Prestons defending a father, played by John
Larroquette, who shoots down a man who assaulted his daughter. The
second movie has a cop killing a suspect, raising the question of
whether the shooting was police brutality or self-defense.
<p>
   In addition to substance, ``The Defenders'' still has Rose, who
reads every script, Rogow said, and knows better than anyone what the
Prestons are about. Rogow recalls hearing from Rose about a line of
dialogue that he didn't like. ``He said, `Lawrence Preston wouldn't
say that.''' How did Rogow respond? ``I said, `OK.'''

<TEXT>
<p>
   If symbols define politics, then India's Independence Day
celebrations in Washington on Aug. 15 spoke volumes about the changing
profile of U.S.-lndian relations. Flanked by Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced to about 1,300 assembled Indian
Americans that President Clinton soon would visit the subcontinent.
For a region notably absent from official travel schedules, the
president's trip  &MD;  and, separately, those of Albright, Daley and a
raft of deputies  &MD;  suggests renewed interest in a country whose
relations with the United States have often been testy.
<p>
   India's rising estimate in the United States probably illustrates
more about America than about India. Mercantilism now tints U.S.
diplomacy, and the bigger the trading market, the brighter our
diplomatic colors. Even if current figures are exaggerated  &MD;  India
claims its growing middle class is close to 200 million people  &MD; 
consumer potential is enormous. Moreover, educated, prosperous Indians
have become significant business partners: Since serious economic
reform began 10 years ago, foreign partnerships have extended and
diversified across the business community. India not only trades but
also produces  &MD;  for the West, as well as Asia and Africa.
<p>
   To Indians, this is no surprise: The increasing world interest
simply vindicates their long-term (if occasionally changeable)
policies and plans. Since independence 50 years ago, India has worked
doggedly to create a place for itself in the world. Its leaders,
regardless of political stripe, consistently have sought to anchor
India's economy and security in an international setting. Its
ambitions are no less than a great power's: a seat at the table when
the world's affairs  &MD;  money, development, war, weapons  &MD;  are
discussed.
<p>
   But these aspirations accompany serious liabilities, for India, its
interlocutors and its partners. India represents bundles of
contradictions, as most travelers quickly note: half a billion poor
living alongside the nascent rich; an agricultural economy that can
feed most of its population but no longer supports its farmers; far
more trained job-seekers than jobs, creating a labor market that feeds
exasperation and political extremism; a cumbersome bureaucracy that
often stifles the same entrepreneurs whose efforts should ground
economic prosperity, and a highly militarized state whose value is, in
an era of prospective peace, contestable.
<p>
   The old India  &MD;  impoverished, famine stricken, sharply assertive  &MD; 
slowly is being replaced by a new India with more rounded edges. The
distinction is never fully clear, however; no development process is
completed overnight. It is a changing India  &MD;  neither new India nor
old, neither black not white, but the India of contradictions and
many, many gray areas  &MD;  that compels our attention. For in its
contradictions lies the success or failure of renewed U.S. engagement.
<p>
   Washington has not really been listening to the complexities that
compose India, and its deafness is dangerously selective. When the
United States responds to India's bywords of democratic secularism, it
willingly ignores resolute class problems that pervade its society and
economy. When the United States gleefully embraces businessmen who
speak the language of Wall Street, it assumes the old socialism is
dead and the detritus of the centralized state soon will wither away.
Not so. Centralism has played a critical role in India's development,
and until the state's constituencies can be satisfied differently,
India's unique mixture of money and militarism almost undoubtedly will
continue.
<p>
   First, the ideology of the old India was socialism, and with it
came a large state and concentrated central power. This structure
outlived its usefulness and created industrial behemoths that still
resist change as much as India's bureaucracy. But ideology doesn't die
with the first breaths of reform. Indeed, the enduring legacy of old
India is not the fact of socialism, but its promise of equity.
<p>
   For the vast army of the poor whose sheer numbers can sink future
profit centers, this promise is sacrosanct  &MD;  even if they have given
up on corrupt politicians who rarely deliver on familiar slogans.
Disputatious politicians and dominating bureaucrats still know the
pulse of the poor, who understandably fear the indifference of
unfettered capitalism. Until this unevenness is leveled, old
ideologies will endure, the promise of profit will be limited and the
bureaucratic state will surely survive.
<p>
   Second, India's large, modern and assumedly nuclearized military,
whose primacy rarely is contested, draws its authority from two
separate impulses: insecurity about national borders and a sense of
regional, if not international, destiny. Border insecurity gradually
is diminishing: Fears about China seem quelled for the moment;
relations with Bangladesh and Nepal, achieved by diminishing old
hegemonic impulses, seem smoother as well. The Pakistan border and the
festering sore of Kashmir, however, continue to impede regional
stability and domestic peace.
<p>
   These are the places where internal and external politics meet:
with hundreds of thousands of security forces along the Kashmir and
Pakistan borders; regular armed incidents between the Pakistani and
Indian armies, and police actions against insurgents in Kashmir.
India's profile along its northwest frontier is militaristic and, in
Kashmir, far from democratic.
<p>
   Destiny is more difficult to qualify, particularly when nuclear
weapons are involved. India's nuclear arabesque with the West
highlights fundamental incompatibilities between U.S.
nonproliferationists and India's nuclear establishment. India refuses
to curtail its program until the rest of the world, including the
United States, does too. It considers itself a member of the nuclear
club  &MD;  not a supplicant to its arbitrary rules. Washington has been
unable to resolve this stalemate  &MD;  and equally unable to arbitrate
disputes between its in-house nonproliferation advocates and its India
promoters, who envision shared profits and, perhaps in the distant
future, some form of nuclear control in the subcontinent.
<p>
   The lure of Mammon may settle this wrongheaded dispute  &MD;  Washington
is far more interested in India's economy than in repetitive nuclear
debates. But this choice entails significant cost. India is right to
dispute the rules of the nuclear game, but only if it will subject
itself to new ones  &MD;  a debatable proposition. India's future role in
Asian security will depend on establishing new trust with its
neighbors and the West, and this, too, depends on keeping its nuclear
word.
<p>
   But India's demand for greater voice  &MD;  backed by increasing
economic muscle  &MD;  nonetheless echoes our own discussions about the
responsibilities of power today. India's policies and practices remind
us that superpower politics may be evanescent and, more important,
that the club of global decision-makers must be expanded if peace is
to prevail in the next century.
<p>
   Politics remains the art of the possible  &MD;  for India's President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan as much as for Clinton. If anything has
changed in U.S.-Indian relations, it is, at least for the moment, a
new sense of possibility. But for possibility to be realized, both
sides will have to think more clearly about their long-term interests
 &MD;  by replacing lectures with more acute listening, and the simplicity
of bilateralism with nuanced internationalism. Only then can
partnership begin.

<HEADLINE>
 &UR; Welcome to the Western World &QL; 
 &UR; Piper, The Baltimore Sun's Opinion/Commentary editor, reported from &QL; 
 &UR; Eastern Europe before the fall of communism. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Time was when urban grime, shabby clothes and empty shop shelves
told you that you were behind the Iron Curtain. No longer. Young women
in platform sandals and tattoos flirt with young men with nose rings.
On sidewalks and in cars, businessmen and teen-agers are glued to
their cell phones. Buskers and beggars patrol crowded sidewalk cafes.
One Hungarian family's various members summered this year in Cancun,
Mexico; Corfu and Malta.
<p>
   Eight years after the marvelous revolutions of 1989, life in
Eastern Europe seems remarkably unremarkable  &MD;  downright normal.
<p>
   ``Well, it may appear that way to you,'' chides Andras Farago,
media assistant to the president of Hungary, ``but our
balance-of-payments crisis has mandated a wage freeze. In conjunction
with 13 percent inflation, that has meant a fall in living standards
over the last two years.''
<p>
   One really ought not to laugh at adversity, but Farago has proved
the point.
<p>
   Balance-of-payments crises and falling living standards are the
most normal of afflictions for normal countries.
<p>
   Hungarians used to worry  &MD;  has Farago forgotten?  &MD;  about their
neighbors informing on them to the secret police. About the necessity
of whispering to their children truths that contradicted the
children's school lessons. About their ``brotherly'' next-door
neighbor Russia, which claimed the right to oversee developments in
Hungary  &MD;  and backed it up with military force.
<p>
   Now Hungarians worry about living standards, unemployment and the
balance of payments. Welcome to the capitalist world, Hungary! And
Poland, East Germany, the Czech Republic.
<p>
   There is real pain in all these countries. Inflation has eroded
savings and destroyed pensions. Medical care has become unaffordable
for many. Unemployment is high in all the former Soviet satellites,
and nowhere higher (estimates range up to 30 percent) than in eastern
Germany.
<p>
   There are so many obsolete skills. Who, after all, would hire a
professor of Marxist science? Or a lathe operator, now that computers
run lathes? Or a former mid-level secret-police technician? Or the 18
waiters and waitresses who used to work in a restaurant now replaced
by a McDonald's with five employees?
<p>
   The transition from communism to capitalism has brought hardship to
many who deserved better. To others it has brought undeserved wealth.
Ridiculously often in all the old Soviet satellite countries, old
Communists effortlessly have transformed themselves into new
capitalists and carried on manipulating the system to their personal
benefit. ``In a hundred years,'' says Christopher Bobinski, a
journalist who has studied the ``privatization'' sell-offs of
state-owned property in Poland, ``you will find that most great Polish
fortunes were founded by friends or operatives of the secret police.''
<p>
   So there is plenty to complain about these sun-kissed late-summer
days  &MD;  in Eastern Europe, as everywhere else. Unless we think back to
our nightmares of just eight years ago.
<p>
   As the Communist regimes toppled like so many dominoes in the
miracle year of 1989, the world held its breath, thinking of all the
things that could go wrong:
<p>
   War might break out, either because the Soviet Union refused to
countenance the liberation of its satellites, or because the
Communists in the satellites refused to go quietly. But there was no
war, and except in Romania, almost no bloodshed at all.
<p>
   With the collapse of Soviet-style, command economies, heat,
electricity and food deliveries might fail. But they didn't. Nobody
starved or froze.
<p>
   Without the suffocating blanket of Soviet control, bitter
nationalist enmities might rekindle. But that didn't happen. Slovak
nationalists peacefully dissolved their artificial union with the
Czech lands. Elsewhere, nationalist rabble-rousers  &MD;  such as Russia's
Vladimir Zhirinovsky  &MD;  came to prominence, then faded. Nowhere in
Eastern Europe is there a rightist movement as potentially powerful as
France's National Front.
<p>
   Reunited Germany might turn its back on Europe and assert a sphere
of dominance in Eastern Europe. But it didn't. Germany is indeed the
largest investor in Eastern Europe  &MD;  directly or indirectly, it
controls up to 40 percent of the Hungarian economy, according to
Farago  &MD;  but it remains committed to the integration of Europe through
the European Union.
<p>
   And then  &MD;  in Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Hungary  &MD;  old
Communist parties, perfumed and renamed, began to return to power
through the ballot box. Would this mean a roll-back of the revolutions
of 1989? It didn't. The former Communists' success signaled the
healthiest thing that can possibly happen to emerging democracies  &MD; 
the normal, peaceful alternation of political groupings from
government to opposition and back. Life is normal again in Eastern
Europe.
<p>
   The great exception, of course, is Yugoslavia, which has dominated
the front pages with carnage, suffering and crimes against humanity.
But Yugoslavia is an exception  &MD;  a tragedy indeed, but one that should
not overshadow the extraordinary success of the rest of the formerly
Communist states in shedding their old regimes and peacefully
rejoining Europe.
<p>
   Best of all, the people who live there are starting to believe in
Eastern Europe's recovery. Economies seem to be on the upswing in
Poland and Russia, and Moscow is even reporting a modest baby boom,
after years of falling birthrates.
<p>
   Jan Zelenka, a Czech book editor, says that beyond the reflexive
pessimism endemic to Central Europe, his countrymen had to learn new
expectations.
<p>
   ``The government always took care of everybody  &MD;  badly, but it took
care of them,'' he says. Hence, when a business venture fails, people
have difficulty understanding that ``freedom to fail'' is the norm in
a free and dynamic economy  &MD;  and that there will be second, third and
fourth chances.
<p>
   Bobinski, an Anglo-Polish journalist in Warsaw, is even more
enthusiastic.
<p>
   ``This is probably the best time in this whole century to be young
and Polish,'' he says. ``The opportunities are limitless.'' He does
not make such judgments lightly, for his own two children are
teen-agers and will make their futures in Poland - or not, because
Poles can travel now.
<p>
   The younger generation, Bobinski says, knows nothing about life
before 1989, when Communist power collapsed.
<p>
   ``They have no baggage. They grew up without the double messages of
what was taught in school and what was said at home. They expect a
normal life. They can't imagine a living in a country that forbids
travel. They can't imagine a secret police. Or fearing a Russian
invasion.''
<p>
   These young people, and others like them in the rest of Central
Europe, are the future. The world may commiserate with retired people
whose pensions lost their value, or with 40-year-olds who can no
longer find work in post-Communist society, but such people represent
a shrinking reality.
<p>
   Even Hungary's Farago, an economist by training, admits: ``I am
very optimistic about things five years from now.''
<p>
   By then, he hopes that Hungary will be on its way to membership in
the European Union. Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and
Slovenia (one of the former constituents of Yugoslavia) have been put
on the fast track for admission to the continental grouping.
<p>
   Negotiations will not be easy. Poland and Hungary, in particular,
are low-cost agricultural producers that could swamp Western Europe
with cheap meat and grain products  &MD;  good news for the consumers, but
not the farmers, of France and Germany. Still, all the European
governments, east and west, seem committed to making European
integration happen.
<p>
   And the former Communists who control the Polish and Hungarian
governments are the biggest boosters of all.
<p>
   ``They've gotten more than anyone else out of the switch to
capitalism,'' explains Bobinski. ``They're the last ones who would
want to go back.''
<p>
   In its last years, it seems, communism recruited opportunists, not
ideologues. So apolitical former Communists now have the most
experience and talent for running things, whether factories or
political meetings. Their recapture of the country's wealth and power
positions is ``an aesthetic problem,'' Bobinski acknowledges, but
possibly the new regimes' best guarantee of stability. He tells a
story that has become famous in Poland.
<p>
   Poland's most famous dissident, the poet Adam Michnik, and its
current president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former Communist, became
warm friends during the months of arduous negotiations leading to the
eventual Communist surrender of power. In recent years, they have
appeared together often at forums and seminars in foreign countries,
where politicians and academics discuss and ponder the extraordinary
peaceful collapse of communism.
<p>
   After one such session, Michnik and Kwasniewski were enjoying a
nightcap in a hotel bar when the bill was presented. Michnik, ever and
still the poet-intellectual, had no money. Kwasniewski, the former
Communist reputed now to be a millionaire many times over, expansively
picked up the check and flourished his credit card.
<p>
   ``And, Adam, my dear friend,'' Kwasniewski is quoted as saying,
``may I thank you for making it possible for us Communists to travel
with credit cards.''

 &UR; JUVENILE JUSTICE: The Price We Pay for Cleaning the Slate &QL; 
 &UR; Funk is an Oxford University Ph.D. candidate in law. This article is &QL; 
 &UR; based on a piece written with Professor Dan Polsby of Northwestern. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   If there is anything approaching a truism in criminal law, it is
that violent men most likely were violent teens. This fact alone
should at least temper the contemporary optimism concerning decreases
in adult crime rates. Consider, for example, that the most recent U.S.
Justice Department statistics estimate that the juvenile arrest rate
for murder has jumped 128 percent between 1983 and 1992, and that the
juvenile arrest rate for offenses such as forcible rape and robbery
has increased by 57 percent during the same time period. As today's
teens reach majority, then, there inevitably will be a corresponding
dramatic increase in overall victimization levels.
<p>
   While some states try to grapple with this troubling reality, most
still cling to ``expungement'' statutes that allow or even mandate the
destruction or sealing of juvenile criminal records  &MD;  often including
even rape and murder convictions. In so doing, these jurisdictions
prevent the appropriate sentencing of young adult offenders, impede
effective law enforcement and hurt private business.
<p>
   An obvious implication from the unprecedented increases in juvenile
crime is that we, as a society, have a stronger interest in
determining which recidivistic and violent teens will become
tomorrow's violent and predatory adult offenders and that we therefore
must treat them differently from their peers who have merely committed
one-time acts of juvenile indiscretion. And while few would argue that
a nonviolent juvenile mistake should forever haunt a reformed adult,
expungement statutes often destroy the extensive and violent criminal
histories of chronic juvenile offenders for the sole reason that they
reach age 18, when the level of their involvement in criminal activity
is still very much on the rise.
<p>
   In addition, many states give judges unbridled discretion as to
when and what to expunge. Typically, a judge is instructed simply to
determine what is in the ``best interest of the child.'' But it is
society  &MD;  not the 17-year-old ``child''  &MD;  that may be victimized in
the future. Therefore, we all have an interest in keeping tabs on an
individual who has evidenced a willingness to break the law and to
disrespect other people's rights to property or safety. What is more,
the extremely broad and unguided discretion accorded many state courts
raises the troubling possibility of some juveniles having their
records expunged on the basis of their race or socioeconomic class
rather than on the basis of their rehabilitative potential as
evidenced by extensive crime-free periods. Because juveniles in these
jurisdictions must ``petition'' the court for expungement, those with
the financial wherewithal and legal sophistication to know that this
option is available and how to exercise it will have an advantage.
<p>
   Most state expungement schemes were drafted in the 1960s, when it
was widely believed that violent juveniles would outgrow their
delinquent tendencies.
<p>
   While this surely does happen in individual instances, most
research shows that such a metamorphosis from chronic predator to
law-abiding citizen is more an aberration than the norm. In the 1987
book ``From Boy to Man, From Delinquency to Crime,'' University of
Pennsylvania criminologist Marvin E. Wolfgang and his co-authors found
a strong correlation between juvenile delinquency and adult crime and
concluded that juvenile delinquency is the ``best predictor of adult
criminality.''
<p>
   A 1994 report on juvenile crime prepared for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
found the recidivism rate among New York juvenile offenders to be
approaching 90 percent. Similarly, a 1991 study by researchers John C.
Steiger and Cary Dizon tracked 926 males released from the Washington
state division of juvenile rehabilitation in 1982; of these, 68
percent were reconvicted within two years and 53 percent committed at
least one violent offense within that time. In short, juvenile
delinquents often turn into adult criminals, and adult criminals
almost never were crime-free as juveniles. But expungement can make it
impossible for employers to identify job applicants with histories of
theft or violence. It also can impede law enforcement efforts to
identify repeat offenders by their patterns of criminal conduct.
<p>
   Expungement merits re-examination. The monumental increases in
juvenile crime, both in numbers and severity, already have caused
states such as Pennsylvania to limit the circumstances under which it
is permitted by, for example, prohibiting the expungement of a minor's
record unless he or she has been crime-free for at least five years.
While it is appealing to view expungement statutes as benign attempts
to reduce the penalty that public opinion places on former offenders
by allowing them to enter adulthood with a clean (or cleaned) slate,
we must understand that such societal beneficence comes at a price.

 &UR; Higher Education Affirmative Action Was a Success &QL;

<p>
   These are challenging times for public law schools in California
and Texas. In the past year, our affirmative action programs for
attracting and educating minority students have been dismantled. These
programs had enabled the University of Texas Law School to overcome a
tragic legacy that, until 1950, intentionally excluded African
Americans. Although no such discrimination had existed at the
University of California, few minority students applied or were
admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, before the late
1960s.
<p>
   In the past 30 years, affirmative action programs have enabled us
to recruit diverse student bodies that brought intellectual depth to
our educational programs and produced leaders in the legal profession.
<p>
   This year, we were forced to change our educational approach to
conform to race-neutral requirements imposed in Texas by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals' Hopwood decision in 1996, and in California
by a 1995 UC Regents' resolution and subsequently by a 1996 statewide
initiative banning affirmative action. Both schools have had to adopt
race-neutral admissions policies, thus minimizing the opportunities
for all students to benefit from the perspectives of society's
traditionally marginalized groups.
<p>
   The substitution of race-neutral selection factors, such as
socioeconomic class and disadvantage, produces a different student
mix, one that is less reflective of racial conflicts in society that
pose special challenges to the administration of justice. And as one
law professor observed, ``How can you teach Brown vs. Board of
Education with no African American students in the classroom?''
<p>
   In our first year of race-neutral admissions, both schools
experienced a drop of 66 percent in the number of offers of admission
to applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups. The
successful applicants are excellent students also eagerly recruited by
private law schools with enormous financial aid resources. As a
result, of the 11 African Americans admitted at Texas, no more than
four are expected to attend; at Berkeley, all 14 African Americans are
going elsewhere, all but one to prestigious private schools.
<p>
   Some argue that the numbers show that we have been admitting
unqualified minority students. We strongly disagree. Law schools do
not admit students only by their undergraduate grade point average and
Law School Admissions Test scores. Because law students participate
actively in their educational process, law schools seek an
intellectually diverse class of students from different backgrounds
who can challenge each other's ideas. To achieve this mix, we and
other law schools have looked beyond the numbers to an applicant's
background, educational and life experience, initiative,
self-discipline, creativity, success in overcoming obstacles and
future promise as a lawyer.
<p>
   Our admissions policies utilizing affirmative action were
strikingly successful. The experiences and perspectives of these
talented minority students improved our schools. Many are now partners
in law firms, directors of public interest firms' law professors,
judges and deans.
<p>
   Some argue that it does not matter if these students are not
admitted to Texas and Berkeley since they can go elsewhere. But public
law schools have in the past served as gateways to the legal
profession for students of merit drawn from all parts of our
incredibly heterogeneous society. It is vital that major public law
schools in other states continue to play this role in providing a
first-rate legal education to a student body reflective of the society
whose laws they will administer.
<p>
   What can be done at our schools to continue to preserve diversity
while complying with the new admissions policies? We are reviewing our
admissions processes to see whether improvements are possible. Since
we can no longer take race or ethnicity into account, we cannot in the
short run hope to achieve the diversity that was once our hallmark. We
can and will call upon the private sector for help. Private
foundations have raised and awarded scholarships and financial aid to
public law school students, and these programs must be pursued more
aggressively.
<p>
   For the future, we will work on outreach efforts designed to
prepare traditionally underrepresented minority students to attend the
university and aspire to become lawyers.
<p>
   Ultimately, the issues we face are simply a reflection of the
crossroads at which America now stands. This country's past efforts to
address racial inequalities have been discarded in the public
institutions of our two states and face serious challenges nationwide.
Americans must think carefully about the long-term implications of
such change.

 &UR; RENO AT LARGE: Heavy Toll for Personal Freedom &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   I confidently predict  &MD;  and I hope to heaven I'm wrong  &MD;  that
within 10 years, E-ZPass toll devices, or some more advanced version
of them, will be mandatory on all vehicles.
<p>
   Soon, the monthly E-ZPass statement of most motorists will exceed
their telephone or electric bills.
<p>
   Let me explain why I'm not nuts.
<p>
   The E-ZPass is, of course, that small object people attach to their
windshield that allows them to cruise through busy toll plazas and be
billed later. The urban toll plaza is a late 20th-century horror.
Labor intensive, vulnerable to robbery, they increase pollution, cause
accidents, add to commuters' travel time and reduce the productivity
of commercial vehicles. They defeat the purpose of building
billion-dollar bridges, tunnels and turnpikes to speed traffic flow
because they do more to impede tra ffic flow than any other obstacle.
Their operating costs suck up much of the toll money that's supposed
to be used for maintenance and to retire bonds.
<p>
   So the E-ZPass is a technological blessing, the more so because it
will allow the tolling authorities to use imaginative pricing,
lowering tolls during off hours and raising them in rush hours in ways
that will reduce congestion.
<p>
   But the E-ZPass, much as it is a great convenience, is also one of
the most efficient revenue generators ever invented. It will most
surely become an inducement for municipalities to slap tolls on
less-used roads and crossings where manual toll collection is simply
not feasible. If unmanned toll points are vulnerable to evasion, well,
technology has already given us the hidden cameras that are used to
give out silent tickets to people who run red lights. And they can
always install menacing spikes tha t rise out of the pavement and
threaten to flatten the tires of toll beaters who try to hide their
E-ZPasses.
<p>
   With so many of the nation's bridges in a dangerous condition,
states and municipalities will be under tremendous pressure to finance
repairs and replacement with new toll systems that place costs on the
user but do not have the drawback of delaying traffic or requiring
24-hour manning. About 14 percent of urban expressways are officially
classified in poor to mediocre condition and more than a third of the
interstate highway system is in similarly rotten repair. Easily
collected tolls  &MD;  ``user fees''
<p>
   is the euphemism  &MD;  become the alternative of choice for politicians
who want to brag they never voted to raise ``taxes.''
<p>
   The cumbersome and sometimes dangerous process of hauling over
speeding motorists could be phased out just as soon as police agencies
discover computers mounted on roadside poles can identify vehicles,
spew out 1,000 tickets an hour and automatically mail them to
offenders.
<p>
   The national and state park systems, under pressure to increase
user fees, will find automatic toll systems irresistible, both as a
cheap way to collect revenues and a means of spreading park usage more
evenly during weekdays and the off-season. The National Park Service,
operating on a budget that in inflation-adjusted terms is half what it
was 20 years ago, and faced with an unfunded bill for $5 billion in
deferred maintenance, will find automatic toll collection the obvious
choice both at its most popular attractions and at less visited sites
that aren't normally manned.
<p>
   And, of course, it can't be long before the private sector
discovers the glories of automatic tolls. Congested shopping malls
will find it a neat way to finance double decking of parking lots, new
access roads or simply a way to supplement rental income. Private
tourist attractions, parking garages, automatic car washes, even I
guess, drive-through fast-food restaurants, will find this cashless
system attractive not just as a cost cutter but as a profit maximizer.
<p>
   After all, the automated teller machine, now ubiquitous in the
banking system, was developed as a way to cut labor costs. But banks
have since discovered their ATMs can be profit centers. They slap on
extra ATM fees even as they get rid of human tellers who have to be
paid wages and provided with benefits and pensions. Surely, automatic
toll collection can similarly be squeezed as a new profit source.
<p>
   But if you want to know what's really scary about automatic toll
collection, stop to think of the endless possibilities it opens up for
surveillance of private citizens. The time can't be far off when the
detailed travel records of every motorist in America are neatly stored
in data banks, available to be rummaged through by the police, the
CIA, the FBI and any hacker or snoop who's interested, subpoenaed by
congressional committees or generally misused in ways the technology
geniuses haven't even thought of yet.

 &UR; HOME WORK: Wood May Be the Problem With Caulking Cedar Siding &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Just when we thought there wasn't anything more we could say about
caulk, we get a letter from a reader in Queenstown, Md., with a
caulking question we can't answer.
<p>
   ``I have cedar siding on my home,'' he writes. ``In caulking the
drip edge, the caulk does not adhere to the cedar. It pulls away after
30 to 60 days. The siding is stained with a Cabot opaque acrylic stain
and I used DAP Acrylic Caulk Plus Silicone. Is there a particular type
or make of caulk to use that is compatible with the properties in
cedar and the stain we have applied to it?''
<p>
   Since it's taking some time for the caulk to lose its adherence,
it's probably a problem with the wood, surmised Larry Horton, vice
president and general manager of Budeke's Paint Co. of Baltimore. Any
exterior wood will expand and contract with the temperature  &MD;  cedar
especially, he said. He suggested using an elastomeric caulk, which is
designed to give a little.
<p>
   ``With silicone, the caulk will stretch only so far, then it lets
go,'' Horton said. ``You need caulking material with a little more
elasticity.''
<p>
   The only problem with the elastomeric caulks is that color
selection may be limited, he said.
<p>
   Horton also had an answer for a reader in Woodbine who has a
problem with paint adhering to a surface. ``What is the best way to
paint pressure-treated wood white? I have tried oil and water-based
paints. None works for very long.''
<p>
   The first step in getting paint to adhere to any surface is proper
preparation  &MD;  it needs to be clean, dry, patched, sanded and, in most
cases, primed.
<p>
   Horton said pressure-treated trim, such as rails and balusters,
needs a good exterior-rated oil-based primer under a good exterior
acrylic finish paint. That gives a ``breathable'' finish, he said, one
that won't crack. ``The problem with any exterior wood is that there
are so many places where moisture can get in - there are so many
cuts'' in the lumber, Horton said.
<p>
   One mistake people make is to try to paint too soon:
Pressure-treated wood needs to season for six to 12 weeks before it
can be covered, he said.
<p>
   He said customers have been happy with the look of a new
solid-color deck stain from Cabot. ``It's formulated a little
differently, but it looks like paint,'' and gives a matte finish to
the wood. However, he said, the product is so new that ``the jury is
still out on long-term performance.''

   ``Is it the Fourth?'' asked Thomas Jefferson in his final utterance

<p>
   ``Strike the tent,'' said Robert E. Lee when he kicked the bucket
in 1870.
<p>
   By the middle of this century, things had improved considerably.
Dylan Thomas, after a lethal bout of drinking in a New York bar in
1953, gasped this goodbye to the universe: ``Seventeen whiskeys. A
record, I think.''
<p>
   And in 1977, Gary Gilmore told his firing squad: ``Let's do it!''
<p>
   Today, as dusk falls on the millennium, an entirely new standard
for the ultimate farewell appears to have been set. With his death
last month at the age of 83, William S. Burroughs, grandfather of Beat
and author of the infamously obscene, infamously nonlinear novel
``Naked Lunch,'' has done to the convention of Last Words what his
life's work did to contemporary American prose  &MD;  clawed it raw and
left it oozing with hilarity and pathos and rage.
<p>
   The current issue of The New Yorker excerpts Burroughs' journal
entries (his only recent writings) from May through the eve of his
death Aug. 2. And if last words are a distillation of a person's short
stint on Earth, Burroughs' was, very simply, one blazing blow against
banality, especially that perpetrated upon the masses by politicians.
<p>
   On May 25, he begins an entry: ``All governments are built on lies.
All organizations are built on lies.''
<p>
   Less than a week later, he elaborates: ``That vile salamander
Gingrich, squeaker of the House, is slobbering about a drug-free
America by the year 2001. What a dreary prospect! Of course this does
not include alcohol and tobacco, of which the consumption will soar.
How can a drug-free state be achieved? Simple. An operation can remove
the drug receptors from the brain. Those who refuse the operation will
be deprived of all rights.''
<p>
   And after a lifetime love affair with heroin, methadone and
marijuana, Burroughs had these departing musings on cannabis and its
effect on his art: ``A few drags on the green tit and I can see
multiple ways out and beyond. So why all this heat on this harmless
and rewarding substance?''
<p>
   Burroughs isn't the first Beat to go out with a whole new concept
in deathbed profundity. When Burroughs' cohort Allen Ginsberg died in
April, Ginsberg's own last words to Burroughs were: ``I thought I
would be terrified, but I am exhilarated!''
<p>
   Timothy Leary, with whom both Ginsberg and Burroughs experimented
extensively with LSD, bid his goodbye in May 1996 with a disyllabic
synopsis of his beliefs, his religion, his personality, his politics
and his attitude toward the great unknown awaiting him: ``Why not?''
<p>
   As the baby boom lurches through the passages of middle age, and
the Xers somnambulate through their first bouts with adulthood, these
old rebels, in their dying words, say a great deal not only about
confronting the ultimate passage, but about the living that precedes
it.
<p>
   In 1994, Ginsberg was asked during a student lecture in Colorado
why the Beats were suddenly inspiring a new and expanded audience.
Listen: ``Because of the sincerity of the works of art, the passion,
the feeling of self-empowerment independent of government, media and
social conditioning, the breaking out of the plastic mass into human
flesh and blood, vulnerability and tenderness''  &MD;  all of which, he
correctly pointed out, stand in raving contrast to ``20 years of the
Reagan-Bush-Nixonian ugly spirit.''
<p>
   Conformity is a sin in the Beat bible. Wrote Burroughs on May 31:
``How good will it be to have total conformity? What will be left of
singularity? And personality? And you and me?''
<p>
   But the greatest sin, perhaps, is disinterest. A numbing of the
spirit, the psyche, the mind. The loss of the ability to feel.
<p>
   The last of Burroughs' last words, penned in a quavering scrawl, is
this: ``LOVE.''

 &UR; The Crystal Method Hopes to Make Mark for U.S. Techno (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  With their album ``Vegas,'' the Los Angeles-based duo
behind The Crystal Method has a real chance to put the West Coast
``break beat'' sound on the map.
<p>
   They seem like unlikely techno heroes. Ken Jordan and Scott
Kirkland grew up in working-class Las Vegas and as teen-agers put on
their own dance parties wherever they could, including the local
tavern.
<p>
   ``The only way you could get people to come dance in Las Vegas was
if you sold beer,'' says Kirkland, 26.
<p>
   Beer bashes were a long way from the designer drug-fueled world of
all-night raving that entranced England and the U.S. West Coast by the
turn of the decade. But in 1990, Jordan and Kirkland had moved to the
rave epicenter of Los Angeles to chase what was then a long-shot
dream: To become a techno band.
<p>
   Under the name The Crystal Method, the duo is releasing its debut
album ``Vegas'' this week. It's the most anticipated domestic techno
album of the year  &MD;  what some are billing as the American answer to
the Chemical Brothers and all that other hard-rocking, hip-hopping
U.K. electronic noise that is wooing the world. The group also
represents the best chance of the long overlooked West Coast ``break
beat'' sound going overground.
<p>
   Using synthesizers, drum machines and live guitar licks, the duo is
masterful at appropriating soul-wrenching samples (Jesse Jackson's
angry ``Keep hope alive'') and matching them with appropriately
energetic hip hop beats (also known as break beats or just ``breaks'')
and acidic synths.
<p>
   What gives The Crystal Method an edge in a music scene fast
becoming cluttered with electronic next-big-things is its ability to
play live  &MD;  and play live well. Using a minimum of backing tracks, the
group actually improvises during live shows  &MD;  all the while sweating,
jumping, even abusing its instruments in classic rock style.
<p>
   ``The music,'' says Jordan, 29, ``has traditionally been presented
as an afterthought to the rave culture.''
<p>
   Jordan and Kirkland first bonded over their love of drum machines
and samplers around 1989. Kirkland grew up on Led Zeppelin and Pink
Floyd, but found a new edge in dance music as a deejay at UNLV's
student-run radio station.
<p>
   Jordan was exposed to disco and soul as a kid and took that
heritage to the turntables as a teen. Both became music studio
engineers, which supported their act. In fact, the duo came upon the
name of their group in 1992 when they told a rapper they were assigned
to record that they were going to speed up the process and edit his
album overnight. ``Ah,'' said the emcee, referring to the slang term
for methamphetamine, ``you're going to use the crystal method.''
<p>
   These days the duo still favors beer over the exotic, sometimes
dangerous drug world that surrounds the scene. They seem down to earth
 &MD;  sporting skateboard shoes and short sideburns. They have
responsibilities now.
<p>
   Having just wrapped up the album, the group paired up with
industrial act Filter to remix ``Vegas''' first track, ``Trip Like I
Do,'' for the ``Spawn'' movie soundtrack. And now the two are on the
road with the Electric Highway Tour, an electronic answer to
Lollapalooza.
<p>
   And, in an affirmation of where their heads are at, Jordan and
Kirkland say they are just happy to be able to make and perform music
full time. ``This music out here wasn't really viable financially,''
says Kirkland.
<p>
   ``It was totally underground.''
<p>
   The West Coast sound of break beat techno has been a strong but
quiet force in the electronic pop revolution. The Chemical Brothers,
for one, admit being influenced by San Francisco's Dub Tribe, which
helped pioneer the California style in 1994 with the searing
underground single ``Mother Earth.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Today, other California groups are poised to follow The Crystal
Method into national prominence. San Francisco's Hardkiss collective,
which produced one of America's best techno records ever with 1995's
``Delusions of Grandeur,'' recently inked a deal with Columbia
Records: It will see the release of several albums from this
three-member deejay crew under such monikers as Hawke and God Within.
<p>
   The origins of the West Coast sound are mysterious, though there
are definite shades of hip hop's early-80s break-dancing genre, known
as ``electro'' (as in Afrika Bambaataa's ``Planet Rock''). While
electro was influencing a group of Detroit musicians who would later
coin the term ``techno,'' electro's funky rhythms and synthesized
melodies also took hold in California with rap acts such as the L.A.
Dream Team (home of a young Dr. Dre), Egyptian Lover and DJ Unknown.
<p>
   Where the West Coast had Egyptian Lover, the Southeast also had 2
Live Crew, a Florida group with ties to California that produced a
similarly electrified, break beat-driven sound known as ``Miami
bass.'' Today, the West Coast sound still has a Florida counterpart
under the skillful hands of such Orlando rave acts as DJ Icey and
Rabbit in the Moon.
<p>
   Until recently, the domestic break beat sound was the domain of
underground deejays such as Icey, Los Angeles's Eric Davenport and San
Francisco's DJ Dan.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   The Crystal Method have no qualms about taking the sound to an
international level. They've prepared nearly eight years to become
stage stars and they don't plan on looking back.
<p>
   ``We make a conscious effort not to deejay because we want people
to take us seriously as a band,'' Jordan says. But he stops himself
and adds: ``But we'll deejay for beer money.''

 &UR; TRAVEL DEALS: More Bang for the Buck &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The U.S. dollar has been on a better roll this summer than anytime
in the past six years against European currencies, including the
franc, mark and peseta.
<p>
   This means that Americans in Europe have been enjoying  &MD;  in the
words of the U.S. chairman of the 27-nation European Travel Commission
 &MD;  ``more champagne, sauerbraten and tapas for the buck.''
<p>
   The U.S. chairman, Jeff Hamblin  &MD;  who's also the British Tourist
Authority's executive vice president for the Americas  &MD;  continued that
``there is full expectation that the dollar will remain quite robust
for the remainder of the year.'' The dollar has even managed to avoid
losing significant ground vs. the British pound, Europe's steadiest
currency.
<p>
   With this incentive, the commission expects that 1997 American
departures to Europe  &MD;  an anticipated 9.5 million  &MD;  will set a record
for the fifth year in a row.
<p>
   If the dollar holds tough, transatlantic travelers the rest of this
year can expect greater than the usual off-season value. ``In addition
to the dollar's added buying power, fall and winter visitors will
benefit from considerably lower off-peak airfares and other seasonal
discounts,'' Hamblin said.
<p>
   Among new values are discount passes good for museums in London
($32 for a three-day individual card to $105 for a seven-day family
card), Paris ($20 for a one-day pass to $50 for a five-day pass),
Amsterdam ($25), Switzerland ($25 adult, $30 adult and children) and
the French Riviera ($15 for three days, $30 for seven days) available
from a company called Tickets To ..., which is a division of New
York-based Marketing Challenges International. The company also sells
Paris dining passes, ranging in price from $129 for three meals at
different restaurants to $299 for six meals; single restaurant deals
range from $36 to $65 for one meal. Discount transport passes include
one for Vienna at $19.50. Call (212) 529-9069.
<p>
   Rail Europe has reduced the price for travelers with Eurailpasses
and Europasses on the year-old Artesia high-speed train between France
and Italy. The Paris-Lyon-Torino-Milan route is now $11 one way for
any segment or the whole trip, whether traveled in first or second
class. For information, call (800) 4-EURAIL.
<p>
   Travelers who book fall and winter travel by various deadlines
should also find some extra deals. Norvista has taken $100 off
air-inclusive packages to Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and Russia if
booked by Sept. 30. The discounted rates start at $499 for five nights
in Prague with breakfast daily, airport transfers and city tour; with
first-class hotels, the discounted rate starts at $699. A ``Two City
Special''  &MD;  a night each in Helsinki and Stockholm and a night on a
luxury Silja line ship between the two  &MD;  starts at $599 with the
discount. Departures are Oct. 1 through March. Call (800) 526-4927.
<p>
   British Airways has a Sept. 15 deadline for three-night, shoestring
getaways to London ($399 to $509), Paris ($429 to $529) or Rome ($559
to $719). All include round-trip airfare from New York and continental
breakfast daily. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and
vary depending on date of travel. They're available Nov. 1 through
Dec. 12. Call (800) 359-8722.

 &UR; TRAVEL NOTES: Take Bug Precautions If Going to Disney World &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Travelers packing for an imminent trip to Disney World should throw
in long-sleeve shirts, long pants and plenty of bug spray.
<p>
   The Orlando resort  &MD;  and reportedly others in central Florida  &MD;  has
also curtailed some evening activities in view of a recent alert
issued by the public health unit of Orange County, Fla., concerning a
mosquito-borne virus called St. Louis encephalitis.
<p>
   ``We're stressing it's not a reason to panic, it's just a reason to
take precautions,'' said Disney World spokeswoman Diane Ledder. She
said no human cases of the disease have been reported this year in the
county.
<p>
   Mosquitos are particularly active from one hour before sundown
until an hour after sunrise, so until further notice, Disney's three
water parks and the pools at its 15 resorts are closing at 7 p.m. The
water parks usually close at 8; some hotel pools might normally remain
open as late as 11, Ledder said. Campfire programs and night hayrides
have been canceled at Disney World's heavily wooded Fort Wilderness
campground.
<p>
   But it's business as usual, Ledder said, elsewhere on the
30,000-acre Disney property  &MD;  which is treated on a nightly basis,
according to a letter being distributed to guests.
<p>
   The letter also passes along the advice from Orange County health
officials to use insect repellent containing DEET, with about 30
percent active ingredient; it continues that because in rare instances
DEET has been reported to have been linked to seizures in children, it
is prudent to use lower concentrations of 10 percent or less on them
and wash treated skin when mosquito exposure has ended.
<p>
   At week's end, Disney World didn't know how long its evening
curtailments would continue. The county ``usually requires several
weeks of clear data before lifting an alert,'' Ledder said.
<p>
   For more information, travelers can call Disney World at (407)
W-DISNEY or the Orange County Health Department at (407) 836-2664.

   ZOO NEWS: The latest attraction at the 2,200-acre San Diego Wild
Animal Park in Escondido, Calif., is a 30-acre Heart of Africa
walking-safari area that immerses visitors in varied natural habitats
where a variety of birds and animals roam free.
<p>
   As you make your way along a three-quarter-mile trail, bridges,
hidden moats, natural barriers and disguised fences keep the animals
beyond arm's length  &MD;  but not much farther. In other areas of the
wildlife park, where animals roam free within vast enclosures,
visitors tour via a five-mile monorail. The park is operated by the
non-profit Zoological Society of San Diego, which also runs the
acclaimed San Diego Zoo (where animals also roam free but species are
separated from one another).

   It is quiet along much of the former Western Front.
<p>
   From the lowlands of Flanders to the Swiss border in the
mountainous Vosges, Belgium and northern France offer panoramas of
tranquil, postcard-come-to-life scenes.
<p>
   Robust cattle graze in rich, green pastures in the Pays du Nord.
<p>
   Vineyards fill the Champagne region.
<p>
   Picturesque wooded hills and sparkling streams enrich the
Meuse-Argonne area.
<p>
   Indeed, it's hard to imagine this part of Europe gripped by the
first world war, as massed armies reduced the countryside to mud and
desolation and shellfire blasted historic towns to rubble.
<p>
   Hard to imagine, that is, unless the visitor takes a closer look.
<p>
   Along the battle lines of 1914-1918, in the many memorials and
burying grounds large and small, the Great War remains very much part
of the landscape.
<p>
   Consider the Somme field of Beaumont-Hamel, the high ridge known as
Vimy near Arras or the wooded ridges north of Verdun.
<p>
   The ground in those places, and others like them, tells a story. It
is haunting, still dangerous ground, scarred by craters, crumbling
concrete emplacements and trenches. Rusted barbed-wire posts still
protrude from the earth.
<p>
   Popular interest in those places, and the conflict that largely
shaped this century, appears to be on the rise. Superintendents of
World War I American military cemeteries report an increasing number
of visitors, including Americans.
<p>
   ``There is ... a new, renewed interest in World War I now by a lot
of people. They are coming because grandparents or great grandparents
are dying, and (survivors) are finding the old papers in the attic,''
said Phillip De La Mater, superintendent of the U.S. Military
Aisne-Marne Cemetery at the base of Belleau Wood.
<p>
   An acclaimed public television series, ``The Great War and the
Shaping of the 20th Century,'' was broadcast last November. Its Web
site is http://www.pbs.org/greatwar.
<p>
   Ypres, Belgium, just across the French border and some 20 miles
from the English Channel, is a good place to start a Western Front
tour.
<p>
   This charming town of 35,000, with its historic cathedral and famed
Cloth Hall, was devastated by major battles in 1914, 1915 and 1917.
<p>
   Nearly every building was demolished.
<p>
   The town, once a thriving medieval marketplace, was at the point of
a salient  &MD;  or bulge  &MD;  in the British lines, and British and German
forces took turns hurling masses of infantry at one another's
entrenched positions. Some 55,000 British Commonwealth troops died
defending the city, and their names are inscribed on the memorial
Menin Gate, a must-see stop for tourists, as is the rebuilt cathedral.
<p>
   An excellent museum, in the rebuilt Market Square, is devoted to
the fighting in and around the town. Photographs taken before and
after the battles provide a startling contrast to the life in the
square today.
<p>
   A few kilometers outside of Ypres is the rebuilt village of
Passchendaele, ground zero during the third and most tragic of the
Ypres battles.
<p>
   The 1917 battle  &MD;  which left a half-million British and German dead
 &MD;  became known in Britain as the ``Battle of the Mud'' because British
Cmdr. Gen. Douglas Haig ordered repeated attacks, though the mud made
it difficult to move.
<p>
   Passchendaele is the site of Tyne Cot Cemetery, the British
Commonwealth's largest military cemetery, with 12,000 graves and a
memorial containing the names of another 35,000 soldiers whose remains
were never recovered.
<p>
   Like all British cemeteries  &MD;  there are more than 2,000 British
World War I cemeteries in France alone  &MD;  it is well maintained by the
Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Individual grave sites have live
plantings, and the purple irises blooming beside stark white crosses
are memorable.
<p>
   Traveling south, crossing the French border, near the town of
Arras, is Vimy Ridge.
<p>
   Atop the ridge, dominating the countryside, towers the Canadian
National Vimy Memorial. The massive limestone monument, with its twin
white pylons and eloquent sculpted figures, commemorates the site of a
costly Canadian victory in April 1917.
<p>
   Canadian students are guides at the memorial, which includes a park
with restored trenches. Much of the area has been reforested to
prevent further erosion of the massive shell holes and craters, but
hiking in much of the park is discouraged. Bright red signs warn of
still-unexploded ordnance beneath the surface.
<p>
   The signs are no joke. It's not by chance that much of the terrain
of the former Western Front remains pastureland. Cultivation can still
be deadly and souvenir-hunting hazardous.
<p>
   South of the Arras, some 70 miles or so northeast of Paris, lies
the valley of the Somme, scene of the epic British offensive in 1916.
<p>
   It was here that British idealism died, as newly conscripted
regiments of youths were chewed up by German machine guns and
shellfire.
<p>
   On the first day of the battle, 20,000 British soldiers died,
making July 1, 1916 the costliest single day in the history of the
British Army. The battle continued for months.
<p>
   Visitors should stop by the Thiepval memorial, where British
schoolchildren today make day trips via the English Channel Tunnel to
decorate gravesites of school alumni and read the names of the dead.
<p>
   At Beaumont Hamel, a majestic caribou memorial is dedicated to a
Newfoundland regiment whose green troops charged from their trenches
that first day. More than 90 percent died.
<p>
   The trench lines here still run deep, and the grazing cattle appear
oblivious to the rusted barbed-wire posts that poke through the green
grass. And, as always, there is a cemetery.
<p>
   The Somme River marked the end of the British sector of the Western
Front. Below the Somme, running south to Compiegne and then eastward,
the trenches were manned by the French, later joined by the Americans.
<p>
   It is here, in the Marne Valley, that the German offensive failed
to win the war in August 1914. It is also the site of the decisive
campaigns of 1918.
<p>
   At Chateau-Thierry, near the highwater mark of the German 1918
summer offensive, American troops were thrown into action in a
desperate bid to stem the tide.
<p>
   The Aisne-Marne Cemetery, one of six World War I American
cemeteries in France, lies at the base of the Belleau Wood, where U.S.
Marines fought valiantly that summer. Nearly 2,300 Americans are
buried here.
<p>
   A beautiful memorial chapel contains the names of another 1,060
Americans listed as missing in action.
<p>
   Visitors are encouraged to hike through the still rugged woods to
view scenes from the conflict.
<p>
   Another point of interest is the double colonnaded Chateau-Thierry
Monument, some 4.5 miles southeast of the cemetery overlooking the
village. The vantage point provides a spectacular view of the Marne
Valley. A map on the east facade of the memorial provides
easy-to-follow orientation to World War I U.S. military operations in
the region.
<p>
   But the valley has more than cemeteries and memorials. The Marne
countryside provides mile after mile of visual delights.
<p>
   This is France's famed Champagne region, and grapes for the world's
most famous bubbly are abundant. The industry is headquartered in the
town of Epernay, where visitors are invited to sip champagne and tour
the Moet &AMP; Chandon cellars, where bottles of Dom Perignon and less
costly wines are produced in the miles of moist, cool darkness.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Other points of interest are the Verdun Memorial Museum, Fort Vaux,
the chapel at Fleury  &MD;  erected on the spot of one of nine villages
destroyed in the fighting  &MD;  and the peaceful, wooded Bois de Caurus,
site of the initial German onslaught.
<p>
   Less than 30 miles northwest of Verdun is the largest U.S. military
cemetery in Europe, where 14,246 Americans  &MD;  including 376 Connecticut
veterans  &MD;  are buried. The Meuse-Argonne Cemetery is the last resting
place of many Americans who died in the September 1918 offensive that
finally cracked the German defenses on the Western Front.
<p>
   It is a beautiful place. A recently remodeled visitors' center
overlooks an oval-shaped pool. Beyond the pool, long rows of crosses
rise toward a memorial chapel. Four Medal of Honor recipients are
buried here, including famed air ace Frank Luke Jr. and U.S. Army Cpl.
Freddie Stowers (honored by President Bush), who became the only
African American in the war so decorated.

   Tours of World War I sites are not the type of trip you'll find in
glossy brochures at most travel agencies.
<p>
   But groups that specialize in historic tours (particularly to
places associated with the two world wars) are out there, and the
World Wide Web is a good place to look. Most offer package deals, with
ground transportation, accommodations, dining and admissions included
in the base price.
<p>
    &MD; Galaxy Tours, based in Wayne, Pa., has been organizing battlefield
tours for 36 years. The business began as a way to return World War II
veterans to places such as Normandy and the Ardennes.
<p>
   In the past few years, however, combination tours of World War I
and World War II sites are becoming more and more popular, said Galaxy
Tours general manager Sue Scott.
<p>
   ``Typically, most of our tours are custom-designed for specific
groups, whether units or veterans or students. We also do a standard
tour anyone can buy into,'' she explained.
<p>
   Groups range in size from 25 to 200, with land transportation
provided in Europe by motorcoach. Galaxy is accepting reservations now
for a European World War I tour planned for April 1998. Call (800)
523-7287 or e-mail ww1 at galaxytours.com
<p>
    &MD; Holts' Tours in England, one of the premier military and historic
tour agencies in the world, offers a varied listing of tours of Great
War locales, including three- and four-day tours each month to the
British battlefields on the Western Front.
<p>
   ``That's our most popular tour,'' explained Sue Butler, Holts'
operation manager. ``We take ages 9 to 90, male or female, from all
walks of life.''
<p>
   Each Holts' tour is led by a team of guides, often a husband and
wife, who have expertise in the particular subject area. A maximum
group size is about 45.
<p>
   A four-day tour of the U.S. Great War battlefields, titled
``Doughboys in France,'' is being planned for September 1998. Holts'
can be contacted by telephone in England at 011-44-1304-612248 or
e-mail at info at holts.co.uk.
<p>
    &MD; Sal Compagno's Bell Travel in Berkeley, Calif., offered a two-week
Western Front tour in May and will have a group touring the First
World War's Italian Front sites next month.
<p>
   Compagno, who is vice president of the Great War Society, said
interest among students of history and relatives and descendants of
World War I veterans is definitely on the rise, ``largely because
World War I defined this century, and in many ways it is still doing
so.'' Compagno added that the Balkans, which featured so prominently
in the outbreak of the Great War, are again in turmoil as the century
draws to a close.
<p>
   Another Western Front tour is being planned for the spring, and a
tour of the war's Eastern Front is also under consideration.

 &UR; Ugly-Duckling Now a Beautiful Swansea (Swansea, Wales) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SWANSEA, Wales  &MD;  Dylan Thomas, the flamboyant poet and playwright
who was born and raised here, called it ``an ugly, lovely town.'' And
so it was: an ugly port city of sprawling, squalid brown dockyards, a
lovely city ringed with hills, wrapped around a sparkling blue-gray
bay.
<p>
   The dockyards are gone now. Where once ``the smoke of the tinplate
stacks'' fouled the air and seared the lungs, a bustling marina
stands, filled with sidewalk cafes and wine bars.
<p>
   In Dylan Thomas Square in the heart of the marina, the
apple-cheeked children of weekend sailors clamber merrily over the
poet's statue. This once-grimy port has become Swinging Swansea, the
heart of the Welsh Riviera.
<p>
   My wife and I arrived in Swansea on a Saturday night last August
after a three-hour train ride from London. We were carrying Thomas'
``Collected Letters,'' and we were utterly, utterly clueless. We
decided to have dinner on Wind Street, for example, because Thomas
once wrote, ``I want to have smuts in my eye on Wind Street.'' We
opened the door to La Braseria, the first pub we found, expecting to
find morbidly drunk Welshmen inside, musing about death and spitting
up blood.
<p>
   A crush of bodies trapped us at the entry and ... Hello, where are
we? Jewels and cleavage and bronzed bodies and hundreds of people
drinking white wine? This was no pub, it was a bodega, with dark
wood-beamed ceilings and black wrought ironwork cradling wooden crates
of wine. Heads turned toward us, blue eyes staring.
<p>
   ``Too bloody crowded down here,'' said a big, grinning teddy bear
of a regular named Peter Mainwaring, shaking my hand. He led us up the
stairs and introduced us to the maitre d', Maurice.
<p>
   We milled around with the crowd for a few minutes, sipping from
oversized glasses of chilled French white burgundy. Everyone, it
seemed, had been out on their boats that day . Maurice found us and
sent us over to a display case filled with beautiful cuts of beef and
lamb as well as fresh prawns, bream, salmon, mullet, haddock, halibut,
hake and lobster, all on a bed of ice and priced by the pound. We
picked out a sea bass and a rack of lamb, to be grilled by a team of
chefs. We helped ourselves to a seafood and salad bar, drank a lot
more wine and ate a whole loaf of French bread. By the time we left at
midnight, we had a pocket full of phone numbers, and we were as happy
as clams.
<p>
   Well, except for the fact that our mission was unaccomplished. We
had been fans of Dylan Thomas since the '60s and '70s, when he became
a cult figure throughout the English-speaking world, when a folk
singer named Bobby Zimmerman changed his name to Bob Dylan, when
thousands of American newborns were named Dylan, a name that was
previously rare even in Wales. Dylan Thomas himself had to tell his
teachers how to pronounce it. Just before we left for Europe, we saw
signs that the cult was alive and well: Bill Pullman, playing the
American president in ``Independence Day,'' told the world, ``Do not
go quietly into that good night,'' slightly mangling a Dylan Thomas
poem.
<p>
   In the morning, we walked to Dylan Thomas Square in the heart of
Swansea's sparkling marina. Little girls were climbing over the statue
of the poet looking much more cherubic than he did in life.
<p>
   ``A tune on an ice-cream cornet. A slap of sea and a tickle of
sand. A fanfare of sunshades opening....''
<p>
   '
<p>
    &UR;  &MD;  Dylan Thomas, describing The Mumbles &LR; 
<p>
   Yachtsmen were swabbing their decks. Under Martini &AMP; Rossi
umbrellas, young women in pastel dresses and chic shoes were drinking
cups of espresso with earnest-looking young men in tweed suits.
<p>
   Dylan Thomas wouldn't recognize the festive-looking square that
bears his name. In 1944, Nazis bombed Swansea's dock lands and left
them in ruins. When southern Wales boomed in the years after the war,
city planners decided on a mix of commercial and residential
rebuilding for a new marina, which was finished in 1981. The Swansea
Marriott was built at one of several entrances to the marina. We
stayed there, and the view from our room was spectacular.
<p>
   Later that morning, we resolved to see the real Wales. We were
going to walk to The Mumbles, a Victorian village described this way
by Thomas: ``A tune on an ice-cream cornet. A slap of sea and a tickle
of sand. A fanfare of sunshades opening. A wince and whinny of bathers
dancing into deceptive water.''
<p>
   The tram that Thomas took from Swansea to The Mumbles is in a
museum on the marina now. Its five-mile track bed has been paved over
into a wide path along Swansea Bay, with one lane for bicyclists and
another for walkers and runners, a perfect spot for our morning walk.
The locals were law-abiding. No bicyclists strayed into the walking
path. And there were no in-line skaters.
<p>
   But where was the Mermaid Bar, where Dylan Thomas learned to drink
at 16? ``Burned down just this year,'' a jolly woman at The Mumbles
Tourist Information Centre told us. The rest of the Mumbles Mile, as
the strip of bars and fish mongeries beyond the promenade from Swansea
is called, was alive and thriving, with more pubs cheek by jowl than
we had ever seen.
<p>
   Across from the downtown Swansea bus station, near the old covered
market where they sell cockles and black seaweed, we found the
Potter's Wheel Free House. Posted on the walls were photographs of Old
Swansea, not looking a 10th as good as the New Swansea. At least 200
people were drinking there, many at the 40-foot bar. Four bartenders
were on duty. Quite sure that I had found an authentic warm-beer
establishment at last, I asked one of the bartenders if by any chance
they served wine. She handed me a long wine menu, listing wines from
six countries.
<p>
   In the morning, we took the train to Carmarthen. The tracks ran
beside the gently curving shore of Carmarthen Bay.
<p>
   It was a one-car train, a one-hour morning milk run. The older male
passengers quietly sipped tea and read the rugby pages, while several
of the farm wives knit thick sweaters.
<p>
   Through this sea of calm, two Japanese women with tags from Tokyo's
Narita airport on their overnight bags ran frantically from one window
to another, videotaping the countryside.
<p>
   At Carmarthen's railway station, villagers speaking in musical
Welsh accents led us to the bus for Laugharne (pronounced LARN), where
Dylan Thomas spent his last four years and where he is buried.
<p>
   On the bus, passengers greeted each other cheerily and promised to
show us where to get off in Laugharne.
<p>
   Thomas called Laugharne ``the strangest town in Wales. Laugharne,
with a population of 400,'' he wrote in a letter, ``has a town hall, a
castle and a portreeve (an archaic word for mayor). The people speak
with a broad English accent, although on all sides they are surrounded
by hundreds of miles of Welsh country.''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   On the path to the main Boat House we paused by the converted
bicycle shed where Thomas wrote ``Under Milk Wood,'' a critically
acclaimed play in its day, shown on American television with Richard
Burton in the lead. The play made fun of the peculiar residents of a
peculiar town, and everyone believed it was Laugharne. The shed was a
dilapidated shack, but the view of the Taff River estuary was
spectacular.
<p>
   The Boat House, four rooms and a huge terrace high above the water,
was crowded with at least 40 visitors. One of the Japanese women
cornered me on the terrace, opened a volume of Thomas' poems and
pointed to one. ``I would like you to recite this,'' she said. ``I
want to videotape you with the Boat House in the background.''
<p>
   Now, Dylan Thomas was very particular about who performed his
poetry. I wondered how he would feel about having a generation of
Japanese schoolchildren learn it from a tourist from Southern
California
<p>
   in shorts.
<p>
   ``Here?'' I asked. ``In front of all these people?'' But I did it
anyway.
<p>
   ``And death shall have no dominion.
<p>
   No more may gulls cry at their ears
<p>
   Or waves break loud on the seashores;
<p>
   Where blew a flower may be a flower no more
<p>
   Lift its head to the blows of the rain.''

 &UR; EDER ON BOOKS: James Salter's Memoir Matches His Lofty Style &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Not ``Recollections.'' Not ``A Recollection.'' Simply
``Recollection,'' as a man might say, ``Death,'' ``Loss,'' ``Sorrow''
for a penitential phenomenon he grits his teeth to face. James
Salter's memoir, ``Burning the Days: Recollection'' (Random House, 365
pp., $24), is written uphill, an account delivered not to himself but,
as if concealing assets, to the autobiographical equivalent of a tax
audit.
<p>
   Remembering can be treacherous; it means launching oneself in a
raft upon a powerful current to the past. Salter's raft is equipped
with steering gear and reverse thrusters. Admittedly, this may be too
obvious an image for a novelist who spent part of his life as a
jet-fighter pilot: The point is that his memoir is not borne along but
maneuvered.
<p>
   Salter has not written a great deal, but two of his books, at
least, are classics: ``A Sport and a Pastime,'' a feverishly
compressed, exquisitely controlled story of a love affair in France,
and ``Dusk,'' a collection of short stories that seems to deserve the
word ``perfect.'' So does one section of this memoir: an account of
air warfare in Korea that stands as a masterpiece of combat writing in
this century.
<p>
   Perfection is a risky thing. It is at a polar remove from life, and
although nobody can legislate the mix of perfection and life required
for great literature, it is clear that a mix there must be. Of course
in a memoir, life demands the larger share.
<p>
   Salter's artistic credo is that of Yeats' ``Sailing to Byzantium'':
to sing not as nature's nightingale but as one fashioned of jeweled
clockwork. It is not the recipe for a great memoir. It excludes the
casual, the contingent, the uncertain and even, sometimes, a humdrum
need to explain.
<p>
   An anonymous biographical note in the Modern Library edition of ``A
Sport and a Pastime,'' for example, tells us that a long first
marriage ended in divorce, and that Salter now lives with Kay
Eldridge, a playwright. The memoir more or less veils this; not from
discretion, it seems, but from some cause at a middle distance between
Salter's literary aesthetics and his privacy.
<p>
   The reader may enter my workshop, he implies, but has no business
in my kitchen. Which, again, is not the best thing for a memoir. If
one touch of nature makes the world kin, there is not the slightest
chance that we will call Salter ``cuz.''
<p>
   We will call him a brilliant writer, engaged in a task at which his
particular talent sometimes shines and often sticks part-frozen. The
frozen parts of ``Burning the Days,'' in fact, may be the most
revealing, although not the most successful.
<p>
   The childhood section is one of the chilliest, and Salter circles
it warily. Born in 1924  &MD;  almost exactly contemporary with Norman
Mailer, which is as odd to think of as Henry James and Walt Whitman
passing each other on 14th Street  &MD;  he was brought up in New York
City. His father was a flamboyant and mostly prosperous builder. ``I
never felt the absence of his love''  &MD;  there is pain and perhaps his
entire literary future in that double negative  &MD;  ``only of his
interest.''
<p>
   A cold start; and for a while Salter fends off those early years by
avoiding the use of ``I.'' Memorizing poetry at his private school, he
writes, ``one learned the heroic language.'' Soon ``I'' is admitted
but, throughout, Salter writes of himself as a kind of third person to
whom things happen, even such things as lust, valor and anguish. The
women, who are many and beautiful, are fourth persons happening to the
third.
<p>
   On Air Force leave in Paris, ``we went upstairs with three girls
apiece''; in Morocco, an expensive prostitute walks him to the brothel
gate and gives him her address; in Rome he has an affair with the
former mistress of Egypt's King Farouk; in California (``the Coast,
the fabled Coast''), it is ``girls with hair blowing and sunburned
limbs.'' Objectified is hardly the word. The women, even one or two he
says he loved, are barely inflections of Salter's self-portrait.
<p>
   The vivid and loving portraits are of men. Life is a man's affair
in Salter's sensibility, whether enduring West Point's bleak training,
flying fighter jets in Korea, making love to women  &MD;  love is war by
other means or, in the terror and exhilaration of aerial combat, war
is love by other means  &MD;  breaking into literary life in Paris and New
York or being the father of a daughter killed in an accident. (It is
the closest he comes to intimacy. Suddenly he stops being the writer
he is but, because he can't be any other kind, he tells us: ``I reach
a certain point and can't go on.'')
<p>
   The company of men nourishes Salter, and men's heroism inspires
him. It is a special heroism that requires style, courage, grace and
artistry, whether in a fighter pilot or in a magazine editor. Success
is not important; gallant failure, preferably in a far-fetched
venture, rates higher. Like Scaramouche, his heroes are born with ``a
sense that the world was mad.''
<p>
   For several years he worked with Robert Emmett Ginna, a film
producer whose high prosperity gradually dwindled. At first, they flew
first-class to Europe, later, in the first row of economy. When the
plane braked to land, Ginna's shoes slid forward under the partition.
``At least they're in first class,'' he observed. Salter notices that
the shoes were hand-made, with a nail coming through the sole.
<p>
   If he casts a cold eye on success, he is susceptible to fame. Names
drop, not always with characters attached to them. The weaker parts of
the memoir exercise a kind of celebrity-intimacy that is entirely
worthy of Tina Brown's New Yorker, which excerpted the memoir's
film-days section. The writing goes pulpy.
<p>
   He has breakfast with Roman Polanski and the late Sharon Tate and
massages the intimacy. ``The previous night had been frenzy and
excess; the morning, freshness and reason.'' After Tate's murder, he
thinks of Polanski, ``I felt the sorrow for him that one feels for
kings.'' Which kings? the reader is tempted to mutter: Carl Gustav of
Sweden? Bhumibol of Thailand? The Hapsburg claimant? Kong?
<p>
   There are quieter, better-sketched portraits of New York literary
figures little known to the public but, like Salter himself, revered
by those acquainted with their work. There is the late Robert Phelps,
a quirky man of quicksilver particulars. Meeting him was like starting
a love affair, Salter writes. And there is Ben Sonnenberg, whose Grand
Street was the finest literary magazine of our time until, entirely
disabled by multiple sclerosis, he turned it over to a successor.
<p>
   If other sections of the memoir are a mix of superb and mannered
writing and of the author's conflicting impulses to embellish his
gilded armor and to relinquish it, the Korean portion is remarkable
without qualification.
<p>
   Salter depicts an alternate world: a battle at supersonic speeds
between adversaries using evolving techniques that make terrifying and
unpredictable demands on the pilots and that reverse the winners and
losers in an instant. Salter displays heroes as strange outside their
brief universe as medieval knights would be today. His prose is in
flight, and so are they. At 20,000 feet, he found a subject to match
his lofty style.

 &UR; ``The Mirror,'' by Lynn Freed (Crown, $21, 219 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; McAlpin is a free-lance critic. &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Heller McAlpin &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The tough, feisty narrator of Lynn Freed's novel maintains an
unusually objective perspective on herself throughout her long life.
Although no stranger to men, she prefers to see herself reflected in
mirrors rather than through the eyes of her sometimes admiring,
sometimes dominating lovers. ``The Mirror'' is an invitingly simple
narrative by an author who has written two previous novels, ``The
Bungalow'' and ``Home Ground,'' also set in her native South Africa.
It is prettily packaged as a memoir with bordered pages and old sepia
photographs and covers the life of Agnes La Grange from the time she
leaves London's East End as a beautiful 17-year-old in 1920. She heads
to Durban, South Africa, where she hopes to make something of herself
on her own unconventional terms.
<p>
   Agnes is a defiantly independent woman at a time when the principal
route for betterment open to women  &MD;  marriage  &MD;  didn't allow for
independence. She has a hearty appetite for sex, though she is loath
to use even this weapon in a woman's arsenal for gain. Agnes La Grange
is self-made right down to her name: ``La'' is from a poster she once
saw advertising ``La Boheme,'' and ``Grange'' is from her lowly
birthplace. She comes to South Africa to serve as housekeeper to a man
she refers to, in her typical confrontational manner, only as ``the
Old Jew.'' Living with him are his 12-year-old daughter, Sarah, and
his dying wife. But Agnes has higher aspirations. As she sharply puts
it, ``I hadn't come all this way to empty potties.''
<p>
   The old man seduces her in short order by playing into her
narcissistic sexuality in front of the full-length mirror he sends up
to her room. He seems to intuit that Agnes is most comfortable when
she can consider her life from a remove. It's as if the ability to
watch her own reflection as she interacts with her suitor gives her
the distance necessary to maintain her self-perspective. When she
becomes pregnant, he installs her in the Railway Hotel, which she
manages to buy by getting the old man to ``pay up ... his use'' of her
all at once.
<p>
   And there she is, gainfully employed, her own keeper, with no man
to ``bend'' her to his will, when along comes the baby, a dark,
birdlike creature who takes after her father. ``I might have known I
would not be a natural mother,'' Agnes comments unsentimentally. ``The
whole thing felt like another form of service.'' She reluctantly
accepts the parenting assistance and eventually the hand of the doting
newspaperman who occupies the room next to hers at the hotel. She
gives the child the name he suggests, Allegra, along with Leah, the
name ``the old Jew'' pronounces on his only visit to the baby. Agnes
knows this was his deceased wife's name, but she claps it on her
daughter despite her misgivings. There was no love lost between her
and her dying mistress.
<p>
   It is no surprise that Agnes is a cold and impatient mother, but
what is surprising is her candor in relaying her maternal shortcomings
with a minimum of compunction. Her story tracks the consequences of
her coldness for her musically gifted and emotionally stunted
daughter, who comes to repeat her mother's history to an alarming
degree. When Leah bears her own daughter out of wedlock with her
half-sister Sarah's husband, she abandons the child to her mother in
order to pursue her vocal career in England. Agnes discovers a new,
deep kind of love with this granddaughter, Bess, before Bess, too,
sets off to make her way in the world.
<p>
   But the deepest fulfillment in Agnes' life is neither from this
relationship nor the numerous liaisons she forms with men who are
referred to only by their professions  &MD;  the hunter, the banker. Agnes
finds her greatest satisfaction in her work  &MD;  running a succession of
hotels through the depths of the Depression and the boom years of war,
building a fortune by dint of concentrated labor and thrifty living.
<p>
   ``The Mirror'' is as much a paean to the importance of work and
independence as it is a social commentary on women's restricted
options. ``And what did I want indeed but to be mastered myself and
yet mistress of myself at the same time?'' Agnes asks when considering
the rub between her desire for excitement, adventure and love and her
unwillingness to trade her independence for security like most women.
She concludes somewhat bleakly, ``It was hopeless.'' The author
strings the reader along by starting sentence after sentence with the
word ``And,'' and the result is prose that is incantatory in its
simplicity. Freed has written an undemanding yet subtle little
feminist book about the extraordinary demands of keeping ``the heart
alive.''

 &UR; ``Men Giving Money, Women Yelling,'' By Alice Mattison &QL; 
 &UR; (William Morrow, $22, 244 pp.) &QL; 
 &UR; Reviewed by Carole Goldberg  &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``Men Giving Money, Women Yelling'' is a loosely woven, lovingly
realized novel masquerading as a collection of short stories.
<p>
   In it, Alice Mattison has created a charming, frustrating and very
believable cast of characters whose lives carom off one another's in a
Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon kind of way. They are carpenters and
teachers, shelter volunteers and frozen-yogurt entrepreneurs, lawyers
and thieves. They all live in or near New Haven, Conn., and they seem
utterly real.
<p>
   This is the sixth book by Mattison, who lives in New Haven. She
accurately captures the funky essence of big, old houses in small,
deteriorating neighborhoods and the people who inhabit them.
<p>
   She understands hard winters on narrow, snowpacked streets where
people ``save'' shoveled-out parking spaces with lawn chairs. She
knows the marshy beaches along the pewter-colored sound where families
dine on picnics while mosquitoes dine on them.
<p>
   She's equally good on the sometimes passionate, often prickly
relationships between men and women, parents and children, lovers and
friends.
<p>
   Quite a few lives intersect in this book, some in vital ways,
others in glancing encounters. As the chapters mount up and new people
are introduced, the reader's anticipation grows: Who will appear
again, and why? Which man will wind up in which woman's bed? Who will
save a dog, lose a father, foretell a murder?
<p>
   Central to the interlocking stories is Tom, who majored in English
at Southern Connecticut State University but finds more poetry in
renovating old houses than he ever did in reading Pound. He works for
his brother-in-law John, a contractor whose family includes a
querulous father, a truculent older brother and a tenderhearted
younger one. They are the Coreys, and their lives intertwine in many
of the chapters.
<p>
   Tom's great love is Ida, who is blond and bigmouthed and bighearted
and, in fact, just plain big. Mattison calls her ``magnificently
fat,'' and she is a refreshing creation. (Plus-size people everywhere
salute you, Alice!)
<p>
   Around them coalesce such people as Pekko, the white-bearded,
open-hearted proprietor of a frozen-yogurt shop; twentysomething
Denny, who is mad, bad and dangerous to know; and Daisy, a teacher in
her 40s who embraces them both.
<p>
   They in turn connect with the LoPrestis  &MD;  Charlotte LoPresti is one
of the women yelling  &MD;  and with Tabitha, whose vision is deteriorating
but whose perceptions are acute.
<p>
   Almost everyone connects, and not pleasantly, with Cameron Corey,
the angry older brother whose only real relationship in life is with
his dog.
<p>
   All the stories can stand alone, but their power is enhanced by the
linking characters and events. In some instances, Mattison plays games
 &MD;  events presented as real in one chapter become the plots of plays or
stories in others.
<p>
   Though the characters swirl about, touching each other in profound
or petty ways, one aspect of the book remains firmly grounded. That is
Mattison's delicate but masterly command of language and tone. ``Men
Giving Money, Women Yelling'' is a quiet, often whimsical book, and
all the more powerful for it.

 &UR; McCLURG ON BOOKS: `Cold Mountain' a Hot Commodity &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   How does a book become a must-read?
<p>
   Or, to take a specific example, how did ``Cold Mountain'' (Atlantic
Monthly Press, $24), a literary first novel by an unknown writer named
Charles Frazier, manage to climb to No. 1 on The New York Times
best-seller list, where it resides today?
<p>
   Word-of-mouth can be a powerful motivator. I became aware of the
buzz building around ``Cold Mountain'' back in late June, when a
co-worker asked me if I had seen the rave review in Newsweek.
<p>
   As the summer wore on, more and more people asked if I had read
``Cold Mountain.'' One person said he had heard a compelling review on
National Public Radio.
<p>
   Larry Goldstone, co-author with his wife Nancy of ``Used and Rare:
Travels in the Book World,'' said he had read ``Cold Mountain'' and
loved it. Malcolm Johnson, the Courant's film and theater critic, who
reviewed ``Cold Mountain'' for the paper, told me he thought the novel
could end up winning literary awards. Malcolm and Larry already
believe their first editions of ``Cold Mountain'' are going to be
valuable.
<p>
   It became apparent that I needed  &MD;  and wanted  &MD;  to read ``Cold
Mountain.'' Like Frank McCourt's memoir ``Angela's Ashes,'' ``Cold
Mountain'' is a book that has managed to rise above the thousands and
thousands of titles screaming for readers' attention.
<p>
   Since I read ``Cold Mountain'' a few weeks ago, it has lingered in
my mind, and periodically I find myself thinking about Ada and Inman,
the characters lovingly and meticulously created by Frazier.
<p>
   ``Cold Mountain'' is a powerful and complex piece of writing. It's
a book that demands a commitment  &MD;  of time, of careful attention. I
think people are eager to read contemporary novels that attain the
stature of literature; they want to buy books that deserve a long stay
on their shelves.
<p>
   This lovely book is about a wounded Confederate soldier, deeply
shaken by what he has witnessed in the War Between the States, who
makes a perilous journey back to the woman he loves. Frazier, in
alternate chapters, describes the woman's struggle in learning to run
a farm after her father's death.
<p>
   ``Cold Mountain'' has an epic quality; Inman's adventures as a war
deserter rival those of Odysseus. In addition to Frazier's poetic
writing, ``Cold Mountain'' has all the elements needed to appeal to a
crossover audience  &MD;  women (who buy more fiction) and men. It has a
historical setting, it's romantic and heartbreaking, it features some
wonderful writing about nature, and by the time you finish it, you
feel that you, the reader, have also completed a cathartic journey.
<p>
   The first printing of ``Cold Mountain,'' which was released in May,
was 25,000 copies. Today there are 578,000 copies in print; paperback
rights have been sold for $300,000; and movie rights have been snapped
up by UA/MGM for $1.25 million. Anthony Minghella (``The English
Patient'') will direct.
<p>
   Neither Atlantic Monthly Press, the publisher, nor the author had
any reason to expect No. 1 (or even best seller) status when ``Cold
Mountain'' was published.
<p>
   ``Everybody in the publishing industry is so amazed,'' says Judy
Hottensen, director of publicity for Grove/Atlantic. ``It's a literary
novel that has propelled itself to No. 1.''
<p>
   Hottensen called Malcolm Jones Jr. of Newsweek to alert him to the
book. Jones' June 23 review (``an astonishing debut'') was the first
salvo from major media.
<p>
   In its July 28 issue, Newsweek returned with a two-page profile of
first-time author Frazier, who lives outside Raleigh, N.C., and got
the idea for ``Cold Mountain'' from a family history. One paragraph
mentioned a great-great-uncle, W.P. Inman, whose Civil War odyssey was
the inspiration for ``Cold Mountain.''
<p>
   Readers began tuning in to the buzz surrounding ``Cold Mountain,''
a novel that booksellers like to ``handsell'' (translation: recommend
to customers).
<p>
   ``People have discovered it and told other people about it,'' says
Hottensen.
<p>
   The media bandwagon has picked up steam, too. Initially, Atlantic
Monthly Press booked Frazier for a regional tour in the South, where
the book has sold phenomenally well. Now he's about to embark on a
national tour.
<p>
   Frazier's publisher doesn't expect the onslaught of new fall books
to put the brakes on ``Cold Mountain'''s momentum.
<p>
   ``We don't see it slowing down at least until Christmas,''
Hottensen says.
<p>
   ``Cold Mountain'' has the potential to become a contemporary
classic, and that would extend its life far beyond Christmas.

 &UR; ``Resentment,'' by Gary Indiana (Doubleday, $22.95, 303 pp.) &QL;

<p>
   Oprah won't choose Gary Indiana's nasty, hilarious, scary new
novel, ``Resentment,'' for her book club, but it is an Event Novel
nevertheless, a book you can bet your smart friends will read, a big
bad tale of celebrities and media hangers-on and hustlers and
murderers that takes place mostly in Los Angeles during the Martinez
(read Menendez) murder trial, but also manages to dissect some of the
New York literary world's most well-protected names.
<p>
   While many novels in the Event genre are more fun to talk about
than to actually read, ``Resentment'' is addictive entertainment, part
Jane Austen , part raunchy, mean, Quentin Tarantino hijinks and part
fin-de-siecle morality tale.
<p>
   ``Resentment's'' main malcontent, Seth, a bitter New York
journalist who comes to Los Angeles to profile a movie star for a
Conde Nast magazine, spends his spare time attending the Martinez
murder trial, dive bars, Hollywood parties and, as he comes into close
contact with major and minor and non-celebrities, complaining about
the pecking order in Media America. Seth believes that almost all of
the famous people he's observed or interviewed are ``impelled by their
own pain to impress and dominate others with their accomplishments.''
And Seth is impressed and dominated.
<p>
   At the top are the movie stars, often rumored to be part of a
Scientology-like religious order, who ``belong to a level of endless
wealth where life becomes punishing theater.''
<p>
   Tumbling down the ladder of public accomplishment are the lesser
and has-been movie stars, their children, as well as radio talk-show
hosts, callboys, bartenders and close to the bottom, in Seth's
estimation, other writers, such as Dominick Dunne, Jamaica Kincaid and
Joan Didion, whom Indiana lampoons with malevolent good humor. (I like
to read all three of these writers, and still I was sputtering and
laughing out loud at Indiana's acid portraits.)
<p>
   In one set piece, a movie star's party, Seth encounters an old
enemy, the writer Sheraton Pyle (another devilish parody), who
``assumes a visage of utter surprise and naivete, of real delight at
seeing Seth, whom he hates, and who hates him. Seth resents Sheraton's
oh, the Marmont, I always love staying at the Marmont, it conjures a
horrible picture of Sheraton checking into the hotel and asking for
his usual room.'' Leaving the party, Seth knows that he's ``a stray
mote from the middle rungs of the New York media ladder. Insignificant
even at a party where nobody really important showed up.''
<p>
   The novel is told in merry-go-round form, with one scene dissolving
into the next as the wide array of freaked-out, sex-dazed, power-mad
Media Americans interact, sabotage and self-destruct. There are even a
couple of near-heroines, steely self-possessed women who kick butt.
<p>
   So often, acclaimed satires are boring, forbidding, academic. Not
``Resentment.'' It's as funny and sad and cautionary as any literary
wonder you'll read this year. It's reason to turn the phone and the TV
off, hide the glossy magazines, pour a stiff drink and laugh, thankful
if you have no aspirations to fame.

 &UR; ``Even the Stars Look Lonesome,'' by Maya Angelou (Random House, &QL;

 &UR; McNatt is an arts columnist at The Baltimore Sun. &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   There are three kinds of travelers, Maya Angelou tells us in this
charming collection of short essays. The first is prudent and
meticulous, the second haphazard and indolent. But the third is truly
desperate, and because of that she fascinates.
<p>
   ``She touches us with her boldness and vulnerability,'' Angelou
writes, ``for her sole preparation is the fierce determination to
leave wherever she is and her only certain destination is somewhere
other than where she has been.''
<p>
   The description could well apply to Angelou herself, whose careers
as poet, singer, dancer and teacher all have been driven by a
relentless need to reinvent herself. The 20 essays in this volume  &MD; 
most are no longer than a few pages  &MD;  comprise a sort of wit and
wisdom of Angelou, culled from a lifetime of adversity and overcoming.
<p>
   Raped as a young girl, Angelou was literally unable to speak for
several years afterward. Her first widely noted success came as the
author of ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' which recounted her
experiences. In a sense, everything that she has written since has
been an installment in the process of her recovery.
<p>
   No wonder she feels a kinship with TV talk show hostess Oprah
Winfrey, who also overcame childhood sexual abuse. Both Angelou and
Winfrey are survivors. Since the worst has already happened to them,
clear-eyed common sense and fearless determination are the only
courses of action open to them that allow for a measure of dignity.
<p>
   Angelou is a graceful writer with interesting insights into many
things: love, politics, sex, aging, marriage, parenthood, loneliness,
romance and friendship. She speaks with the benign equanimity of a
family matriarch who is convinced that whatever lessons life has
taught her are authoritative.
<p>
   From Africa, Angelou appropriates half a dozen aphorisms that
preserve the lore of survival.
<p>
   In an essay about the astonishing creativity of African peoples and
culture, for example, she invokes the beautifully transparent saying,
``Sea never dry.'' In discussing the unconcern Africans on the
continent feel for those in the diaspora, she complains, ``The ax
forgets, the tree remembers.'' She writes of the conflicts between
mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, whites and blacks with
humor, understanding and compassion.
<p>
   This is not rocket science, but fans of Angelou's work will find it
apt. She takes such evident satisfaction in her own accomplishments
that her optimism is infectious. Live to the fullest, she proclaims.
Yet she manages to pull it off without the self-righteousness of a
self-help manual. Her strategy is not to instruct but to entertain and
inspire. When she pokes fun, it's mostly at herself.
<p>
   For example, as a young woman she married a brilliant intellectual
who was hopelessly unromantic. Soon she realized the marriage was
``suffocating in the thin intellectual air that he breathed
comfortably but that could not fill my lungs.
<p>
   ``I left the marriage after it became lifeless, and I'm still
thankful for the early passion we both brought to the union,'' she
recalls. ``I am even thankful for the lesson learned. Heed the African
saying: `Be wary when a naked person offers you his shirt.' ''

<p>
   The whimsical title belies the dread that courses through this
chronicle of the transfer of power in Africa during the latter part of
this century. It is the white dread of black rule, which the author
finds depressingly well-founded.
<p>
   Graham Boynton's authority for dealing with such historic change in
his adopted continent comes not from his academic background  &MD;  he
graduated in economics  &MD;  but from recurrent personal encounters with
Africa's modern history.
<p>
   As a boy in 1960, he watched the Belgian refugees from civil war in
the Congo arrive in sorry state in his hometown of Bulawayo, Southern
Rhodesia, arousing both sympathy and consternation among the local
whites. As a youth a decade later he fled to South Africa to dodge the
draft in Rhodesia and become a journalist, only to be expelled by the
Afrikaner apartheid government for his leftist leanings; he returned
to witness the amazing 1994 transition that brought President Nelson
Mandela and the African National Congress to power.
<p>
   Taken to Africa in 1951 by his emigrating parents, lured south by
``the sunshine and cobalt-blue skies instead of overcast,
damp-to-the-marrow old Britain,'' he now considers himself ``a white
African.''
<p>
   He roots the character of white Africans in their historic
experiences. For Rhodesians he points to the imagery of the white
Shangani Patrol, their ammunition spent, standing shoulder to shoulder
singing ``God Save the Queen'' as they are slaughtered by the warriors
of King Lobengula of the Matabele tribe on Dec. 4, 1894.
<p>
   For the Afrikaners of South Africa, he delves further back to the
Dec. 16, 1838, pledge by 350 Boers of allegiance to God if he allowed
them to triumph over an army of 10,000 Zulus at what became known as
the Battle of Blood River because the waters of Ncome River ran red
with the blood of 3,000 Zulus. Not a single Boer was killed.
<p>
   It caused him to wonder, as change reached the southern tip of the
continent, how the Afrikaners would handle the final reversal of
fortune, the apparent snub from the God they had made a pact with 150
years ago.
<p>
   If Boynton is hard on the white colonialists for failing to prepare
the black majority for Africanization  &MD;  be it in the Congo or South
Africa  &MD;  he is equally hard on the black Africans for failing to use
power effectively  &MD;  be it in Kenya or Zimbabwe. ``Africa's decline has
been staggering,'' he says.
<p>
   He recounts his recent return to crime-ridden Johannesburg,
``sweating the white man's sweat' as he lies awake ``waiting wide-eyed
for my executioners to arrive,'' contrasting it with the secure
orderliness of his childhood and youth in colonial Rhodesia.
<p>
   ``Suddenly, vividly, the white African's inglorious past appeared
to me as a glorious memory,'' he confesses.
<p>
   Nevertheless, he argues, it is up to South Africa, ``liberation's
final frontier, to prove there was life after the white man and that
Africa could rule itself.'
<p>
   Clearly, Boynton is no optimist. He sees ``a negotiated
arrangement' whereby Europeans run bureaucracy and business and blacks
hold political power as ``mildly feasible.'' Hardly. South Africa's
black politicians and intellectuals are currently debating the
parameters of their brand of Africanization. The focus is on
nonracism, but there is no talk of any type of re-colonization,
however benign.
<p>
   Nevertheless, he wonders: ``Would the expats do a better job?'' His
answer: ``They could not do any worse than the black governments have
done.''

 &UR; The Long and Winding Road to `The Perfect Storm' (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  You remember in Norman Maclean's `Young Men and Fire'
when he says that the young firefighters (soon to die in a forest
fire) didn't know they owed the universe a tragedy?
<p>
   ``I felt that way until I cut my leg.''
<p>
   This is Sebastian Junger talking. He was working in suburban New
York taking down trees from the top, piece by piece, with a chain saw.
One day he forgot to bring his leather boots, so he was up in a tree
in tennis shoes. He made a mistaken move and with his saw sliced open
his lower left leg to  &MD;  but not through  &MD;  his Achilles' tendon. That
set him reflecting on men who work at dangerous jobs.
<p>
   One thing led to another and now Junger, 35, is on a national tour
promoting ``The Perfect Storm,'' his finely written, terrifying tale
of an awesomely powerful storm that struck the Northeast in October
1991 and took the lives of six men aboard a Gloucester, Mass.,
swordfishing boat that sank without a signal, leaving only some deck
gear to float to shore.
<p>
   Published in May, his book is on best-seller lists around the
country. Junger sold the movie rights to Warner Bros. for $150,000,
with another $350,000 to come if the movie gets made, and the
paperback rights to HarperCollins for $1.2 million.
<p>
   Publicity makes him look tough, gritty, macho. One story, by a
friend, said he drinks a lot of bourbon and doesn't know what
underwear is. (That's largely true. ``I've got to rub him out,''
Junger says. ``He's spoiling my carefully constructed media image.'')
Some photographs show his wiry body shirtless, sailing his new sloop,
swimming at Cape Cod. As the author of an action book, the
striking-looking Junger is a publicist's dream.
<p>
   But the man is more congenial than the image.
<p>
   On a recent visit to Los Angeles, Junger (pronounced Younger)
smiled and talked modestly about his work and himself. He was wearing
high black shoes, neat dark blue jeans, a dark open-neck shirt and an
off-white sport jacket. He has hazel-blue eyes and a tall brush cut.
Sometimes, he wears a small gold earring.
<p>
   The phone in his hotel room was ringing. ``It's been like this all
summer,'' he said apologetically. ``I was so happy before all this. I
hope it doesn't somehow change things.
<p>
   ``This is way more than I expected or even wanted. Finally, in my
30s, I made enough to live on by writing for magazines''  &MD;  including
Outside, American Heritage and Men's Journal.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Junger got his love of outdoor life from a boyhood spent partly on
Cape Cod and his vocation as a writer from the experience of writing a
senior honors thesis in cultural anthropology at Wesleyan University
in Connecticut.
<p>
   He is by ancestry Italian, Spanish, Russian and Austrian, in equal
parts. His father, Miguel, lived the World War II years in Cascais, a
little fishing village and now a big resort, on Portugal's Atlantic
coast. Later in America, as a physicist specializing in underwater
acoustics, Miguel returned to the edge of the sea and built a house in
Truro, Mass., where Sebastian and his younger sister spent much time.
Sebastian dedicated the book to his father, ``who first introduced me
to the sea.''
<p>
   The Cape ``is a place that shaped me more than anything else,'' he
said. He surfed in the Atlantic long before it was popular there.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   College got him going into what he has been doing since. He said
that he was an indifferent student, doing well in what he was
interested in, not so well otherwise. He was a good long-distance
runner, and he got the idea to write a thesis about the long-distance
Navajo runners. Like the runners of Africa and the Tarahumara Indians
of Mexico, the Navajo running tradition, he said, goes back to the
days before the horse, when the only speed was human.
<p>
   ``I would train with these guys outside Window Rock, Ariz. They
would call on supernatural powers, like the ones they would call on
for hunting and fighting.... The kids were wearing Nikes and nylons
(shorts and singlets) and red paint dabbed on their cheeks. I was just
on fire writing that thing. I would race back after dinner and work on
it.''
<p>
   Junger got a degree with honors from it, and he was captivated by
journalism. He has written about smoke-jumpers, reported from Bosnia
for radio, ridden tugboats in the Mississippi.
<p>
   He was living in Gloucester, still limping from his leg wound, when
he watched 30-foot waves from the great nor'easter crash against the
shore. He clipped the story from the paper about the loss of the
72-foot Andrea Gail, struggling against immense seas, and decided to
write a book about men in dangerous jobs. It became the book about the
storm.
<p>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' describes the convergence of several weather
systems to produce a storm that can scarcely be imagined. Junger
writes sympathetically and in great detail about the lives of the
crewmen and their families. Based on careful research, he tells what
it is like to drown trapped in a sinking steel boat. He writes of
other marine emergencies in that storm, and brave and frightening
rescue attempts at sea by the Air National Guard.
<p>
   The book has been widely and warmly praised, but not universally. A
writer for the New York Observer recently published an article
critical of Junger for errors. Irritated and hurt, Junger responded
somewhat sheepishly that yes, he had erroneously put spark plugs in a
diesel engine and had mixed up some Gloucester streets, but he
defended both his characterization of the boat and his
less-than-enthusiastic portrait of its owner.
<p>
   Most important to him, the families of the lost men like the book.
<p>
   Junger said that though he has some ideas for books, he is going to
return to writing magazine stories. And continue cutting trees, though
this time not for the money. ``As my life approached what looked like
a vertical takeoff,'' he said, ``I wanted to keep my life real.'' So
once a week or so he puts on his climbing gear and goes up.
<p>
   ``Up there, the only thing that matters is that I don't make
mistakes, that I don't hurt either myself or the tree.''
<p>
   Junger said he doesn't think he'll move from his modest apartment
in the East Village in Manhattan. He has a girlfriend but doesn't live
with her. With his new money, he bought a heavy 26-foot English
fiberglass sloop, which he keeps at Provincetown, Mass., at the tip of
Cape Cod.
<p>
   Is there anything else one should know? Well, one more tale from
the storyteller.
<p>
   When Junger was 6 months old, he had the Boston Strangler as a baby
sitter for a time. Albert DeSalvo, who was later caught and charged
with the rape and murder of 13 women, worked in construction. The
Junger family hired him to do some work in their house in Belmont,
outside Boston. The family liked him.
<p>
   One day DeSalvo came to work looking nervous and white-faced. A
friend called Sebastian's mother, Ellen, and said that the Strangler
had struck again and was thought to be in Belmont. Junger's mother
locked all the doors and told DeSalvo the news as he was up on a
ladder. She reported that he looked perturbed.

 &UR; Victim Recalls Systematic Sterilization at School (Gavle, Sweden) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GAVLE, Sweden  &MD;  In the case of Maria Nordin  &MD;  who was 17 when she
was sterilized  &MD;  she had three strikes against her: She came from a
problem family, was a poor student and had been sent to a reform
school where systematic sterilization was the norm. According to one
study, one-third of girls released from Swedish special schools
between 1937 and 1956 were sterilized.
<p>
   At the Hoghhammarskolan school in Bollna, where Nordin spent a
decade, the rules were so unbending that she was not even allowed to
go home for her mother's funeral. The mail was opened and screened.
Every girl there, Nordin said, lived with the terrifying knowledge
that her day would come. There was no question of saying no.
<p>
   To this day, Nordin, 72, remains bitter and angry about those
years. The name of the headmistress, Astrid Ekemalm, rolls spitefully
off her tongue, as does that of the physician, Dr. Ingvarsson. Both
are dead, she said, but in the 1960s she and her husband once
confronted them. ``They are lies  &MD;  `feeble-minded' and all those other
words they said about me,'' Nordin explained. ``They ruined me.''
<p>
   Ekemalm showed no remorse upon meeting Nordin two decades later,
while Ingvarsson reminded her the surgery was irreversible and
suggested she get on with her life. Neither seemed to care that Nordin
had proved them wrong: She went right from school to a foster home,
where she cared for five children for more than six years. Later, she
ran a florist's shop, managed a cafeteria and worked as a nurse's aide
in a retirement home.
<p>
   Once she got glasses, Nordin said, her life changed. She drove a
car until 1989, when her nearsightedness got so bad, even with
corrective lenses, that she gave up her license. She also has gotten
divorced and has undergone four operations for stomach cancer . Life,
once again, was unraveling. ``It was getting really hard the last few
years,'' Nordin said.
<p>
   Then one morning last year, she happened upon an article in the
local newspaper here in Gavle, about 100 miles northwest of Stockholm,
about a woman awarded compensation for having been sterilized. She
called her friend Elsie, who prepares her taxes, and said she needed
to talk to her right away.
<p>
   Maria dictated while Elsie wrote.
<p>
   ``They said that I was feeble-minded and uneducable and therefore I
should not have children,'' she told the Ministry of Health and Social
Affairs. ``That has always been my greatest sorrow. Unfortunately, so
many people ask me again and again why my husband and I didn't have
any children. I couldn't bear to answer all of those questions.''
<p>
   The ministry rejected the claim because Nordin had signed a consent
form and because damages have been awarded only to those few who have
proven that officials did not follow the law in administering the
sterilization. But her application opened her story to the public.
Suddenly, Nordin began confiding to her friends. A journalist called.
Then another. Before long, she was telling the world. Nothing has made
her happier.
<p>
   ``The biggest relief,'' she said, ``is that people finally
understand that I am the one telling the truth about me.''

 &UR; Sterilization Left Irreversible Scars on Victims (Gavle, Sweden) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GAVLE, Sweden  &MD;  No one could have known, of course. But the view
all these years from Maria Nordin's balcony has been a bittersweet
reminder of the life she so much wanted but was never allowed to have.
<p>
   The blessing is that her failing blue eyes  &MD;  at the center of her
awful story that began 54 years ago  &MD;  now prevent her from seeing more
than a few yards away. The playground five stories below, with
children dangling from tire swings and mothers trading neighborhood
gossip, mercifully is beyond her sight.
<p>
   ``Sometimes I just sit there on the balcony,'' said Nordin, 72, who
uses a magnifying glass and bifocals to fill in her favorite crossword
puzzles. ``I carry a hatred that never leaves my heart. I have tried
to let my hatred go, to melt it down. But it isn't possible for me.''
<p>
   In 1943, at age 17, Nordin had her ovaries removed on the
instructions of the headmistress and consulting physician at a reform
school for girls. In the parlance of the time, she was said to suffer
a ``genetic inferiority'' that, in the interest of the Swedish welfare
state, was best not passed on to offspring.
<p>
   A lackluster student, Nordin had fallen hopelessly behind in her
studies, and although a school report described her as ``kind and
obedient and nice in appearance,'' doctors said her family had a
history of alcoholism, promiscuity and mental illness.
<p>
   In hindsight, it seems implausible that no one bothered to check
her eyes; Nordin, who had no glasses, says she could barely see the
blackboard. Instead, the school doctor classified her as
``feeble-minded'' and ``unable to raise children.'' The National Board
of Health concurred and Nordin became one of 1,327 Swedes sterilized
that year under the country's 8-year-old sterilization program.
<p>
   She only recently came forward with her agonizing secret. Her
disclosure, coming late in life as she battles cancer and loneliness,
is part of a growing public examination in Sweden of the country's
well-documented but little-scrutinized sterilization program, which
was abandoned only in the 1970s after 62,888 state-sponsored
procedures.
<p>
   Last week, the Swedish government took the unusual step of creating
a national commission to examine the history of the program and to
devise a compensation plan for its victims, only a handful of whom
have received any damages. It is the first acknowledgment by the
government that the program, although legal, was wrong and the
admission is likely to result in an official apology to the estimated
20,000 victims still living.
<p>
   ``I'll never forget when I was called into the headmistress'
office,'' Nordin said. ``I was aware of it well before. I hid in the
basement bathroom crying all by myself. I was thinking of killing
myself, and I have been thinking of it ever since. But I never wanted
to give them the satisfaction of getting rid of me.''
<p>
   Inspired by a series of articles in Dagens Nyheter, the respected
Stockholm daily newspaper, the newfound soul-searching among
government officials and some ordinary Swedes has spread to other
countries as well.
<p>
   In the past week, sterilization programs in Austria, Switzerland,
Norway, Finland, Belgium and the Czech Republic have come under new
review, even though the policies were legal, largely noncontroversial
at the time and pursued by democratically elected governments.
<p>
   Many U.S. states also have records of similar practices, including
California, where 4,310 patients at the Sonoma State Home were
sterilized between 1919 and 1943. The first modern sterilization law
in the world was passed in 1907 in Indiana, and the first recorded
``eugenic sterilization''  &MD;  a vasectomy justified on claims of genetic
inferiority  &MD;  was performed in 1899 at the Jeffersonville State Prison
in Indiana.
<p>
   But what makes the Swedish situation different and somehow more
appalling, historians say, is that the sterilizations were not
restricted to hardened criminals or the severely mentally retarded
already confined to institutions.
<p>
   By the 1950s, the most common candidate in Sweden was a ``socially
inferior'' or ``exhausted'' woman seeking an abortion; although all
but the earliest sterilizations were required to be voluntary,
targeted men and women were often coerced into agreement. In Nordin's
case, sterilization was made a condition of her release from school.
<p>
   ``These acts were barbaric,'' said Health and Social Affairs
Minister Margot Wallstrom, who has become a leading critic of Sweden's
practices but whose ministry just last year rejected Nordin's request
for compensation. ``We should call things by their right name. Today,
of course, we strongly condemn these acts, and they can never be
defended.''
<p>
   Former Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik said recent accounts of
sterilization practices have caught the attention of political leaders
because they point to an abuse of power at a time when the Swedish
government had far-reaching authority over everyday life. The
revelations, even if not entirely new, represent a breach of trust,
she said.
<p>
   ``When you have such power, you can decide on almost any kind of
rules so long as they do not violate the constitution, but that
doesn't mean the rules are ethical or justified,'' Hellsvik said. ``Of
course, now we can say that we should have realized this earlier. But
now we are more aware of how political power affects individual
people's lives.''
<p>
   Although the sterilizations were abandoned in 1975, some critics
say the shift was more pragmatic than repentant as abortion was
legalized and effective forms of birth control replaced scalpels.
<p>
   Equally unsettling has been the realization that a vast majority of
the victims  &MD;  more than 90 percent  &MD;  were women in a society that has
prided itself on equality between the sexes.
<p>
   ``People are seeing another side of the welfare state that they
simply couldn't imagine possible,'' said Maija Runcis, who has
examined 8,000 sterilization cases as part of her doctoral research at
Stockholm University. ``When I first read the files, I was absolutely
shocked. Then I became angry.''
<p>
   Carl Bildt, an opposition leader and former Swedish prime minister
who until recently served as the international representative in
Bosnia, wrote to the government that ``Swedish society risks being
injured'' by the sterilization debate unless there is a full
accounting. ``It is of great importance that a truthful picture of
what occurred be placed on the table,'' he said.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   The promised government inquiry will have plenty of information.
Scholars and journalists have looked into this subject for years.
Technical books have been written, documentaries aired on television
and radio, and, beginning in the 1960s, an occasional objection has
been raised in Parliament, most notably by Olof Palme, who was then
education minister but rose to the job of prime minister before his
1986 assassination.
<p>
   But somehow the subject never resonated outside small circles of
experts and victims. The sterilizations, performed for 40 years and
required under two acts of Parliament, have never been mentioned in
textbooks or Swedish encyclopedias, according to research by Dagens
Nyheter.
<p>
   ``That is what is scary,'' said Hellsvik, the former justice
minister. ``In the past, we haven't discussed it. We kept it away from
us.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Public reaction has been relatively muted; Swedish media at first
showed little interest in the Dagens Nyheter series, with most
inquiries coming from news outlets abroad. Runcis, whose research
served as the basis for the newspaper stories, said she had given more
than two dozen interviews  &MD;  mostly to foreign journalists  &MD;  before
Swedish television called to question her at length last week.
<p>
   Maciej Zaremba, the main reporter of the Dagens Nyheter series, who
is of Polish origin, told a Warsaw newspaper that Swedes have been
low-key about the sterilization laws because the country's most
influential professions  &MD;  lawyers, doctors and politicians  &MD;  went
along with it. ``On this issue, everyone has a skeleton in his closet
and there are no saints,'' Zaremba said.
<p>
   Some media accounts of the Swedish program make references to
``Nazi-like'' techniques, but Swedish historians say the similarities
disappeared in the early years. The Nazi and Swedish sterilization
policies were both rooted in race, but the Swedish emphasis soon
shifted to social and economic behavior rather than creating a master
Nordic people, the historians say.
<p>
   ``It wasn't a question of race, whether you were black, white or
yellow,'' said Runcis, the doctoral student at Stockholm University.
``It was about people's quality. ... the view of the social welfare
state was that everyone has the same rights, but you have to behave
yourself and act like a `typical Swede.' ''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Runcis said medical records on sterilization include countless
judgments about social behavior that was deemed threatening because
people were difficult or unusual. As such, she said, the victims were
misfits in a collective society that cherished uniformity above all.
<p>
   She is not a good mother, the sterilization report would charge.
She looks like a prostitute. She quarrels with her husband. Her
children are dirty. She goes dancing until late. She does not know her
church lessons. Her father is a vagrant and a loafer. The whole family
is ``subnormal.''
<p>
   ``I am not a doctor, so I can't evaluate the medical claims. I can
only tell you what I've read in the records  &MD;  and I found a horrible
history that no one seems to know about,'' Runcis said.

 &UR; Bolivian Official Leaves Legacy of Justice Reform (La Paz, Bolivia) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia  &MD;  This is how the justice system used to work in
this country: Debtors were routinely locked up. Peasants could spend
decades in prison for stealing and eating a cow. Suspects languished
eight years behind bars awaiting a verdict, were found innocent, then
had to remain in prison while prosecutors appealed  &MD;  sometimes all the
way to the Supreme Court.
<p>
   Small wonder that when Rene Blattmann took the newly established
post of justice minister in 1994, Bolivia had Latin America's highest
proportion of prison inmates awaiting judgment: 91 percent. Blattmann
got to work dismantling a judicial machinery that was centuries
out-of-date and assembling a modern one.
<p>
   Soon the prison population declined sharply, leaving Bolivia with
Latin America's second-lowest percentage of untried inmates. The state
created protections that are common in other nations but were exotic
here, such as public defenders.
<p>
   Blattmann became a hero at home and a model of reform abroad.
<p>
   ``The reforms, whose promoter has been Justice Minister Blattmann,
have produced very important results,'' concluded the Andean Jurists
Commission, an organization of legal scholars in the six-nation Andean
region, in a report this year.
<p>
   Bolivia offers an incomplete but hopeful success story in the
struggle against a profound Latin American crisis: the injustices of
the justice system.
<p>
   ``The worst thing that can happen is that the law is not respected,
but only feared,'' said Blattmann, who stepped down last month when a
new president took office. ``We tried to do reasonable things that any
person with common sense would understand. ... There were absurd laws,
crazy laws. They say that if (Franz) Kafka had been born here, he
would have been considered a realist.'
<p>
   Kafka, the Austrian-Czech surrealist writer, was a principal
inspiration of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian author and
architect of the ``magical realist'' style of telling incredible
stories in a matter-of-fact tone. The justice systems south of the
U.S.-Mexico border generate everyday horror stories that rival the
fantastic visions of both authors.
<p>
   The crisis emanates from the region's authoritarian politics and
unequal economics, affecting big nations and small, modernizing and
backward.
<p>
   The cash and firepower of drug mafias overwhelm police and
prosecutors in Mexico and Colombia. Penitentiaries are squalid,
teeming caldrons in Brazil and Venezuela, where 41 people died in a
prison riot last week. In Argentina, one of the safest, wealthiest and
best-educated Latin societies, public disgust with the police and
courts dominates politics.
<p>
   As Blattmann, a spry and diminutive former law professor ,
describes the absurdities he encountered, his expression combines
disbelief and a workmanlike relish. He opens a law book to recite the
old definition of the terrorism, which encompassed ``throwing bombs''
and ``shouting to cause an uproar in public.'' The offense was
punishable by death.
<p>
   ``The laws gave a blank check to the state,'' he said. ``And all
the apparatus of the state was selectively concentrated, inversely
focused on the weak and the poor. It punished poverty more than
crime.''
<p>
   In this ponderous and labyrinthine apparatus, pretrial detention
lasted years. Bolivians used the legal system to collect debts as
minor as handymen accused of failing to complete a job. Jail cells
burst with debtors and their families. This was one of the few nations
that imprisoned debtors and allowed children to live in prison with
their parents.
<p>
   Economic despair played an aggravating role in a country whose
predominantly indigenous population of 8 million is among the
hemisphere's poorest. Many inmates could not afford to pay civil
damages that accompanied guilty verdicts for crimes such as theft and
were required before release. Some could not pay the paperwork fees
required for the formal issuance of an innocent verdict.
<p>
   Another factor: U.S. anti-drug policy. In 1988, the Bolivian
Congress enacted Law 1008, a sweeping anti-drug statute. Encouraged by
U.S. diplomats as a response to years of pervasive drug corruption,
the legislation imposed tough restrictions on courts to prevent
judicial protection of drug lords.
<p>
   Under the original law, once a prosecutor filed drug charges, the
judge had to proceed to trial regardless of the merits. After an
acquittal, the suspect remained incarcerated until the appeal reached
the Supreme Court. There was no bail.

   ``All you had to do was present a piece of paper, you could enter
your son's report card as evidence, and the case had to go trial,''
Blattmann said. ``People began to be very afraid, because the legal
mechanism was used for extortion.''
<p>
   In practice, the pawns and the innocent suffered most, while
big-time traffickers merely bribed police and prosecutors. The justice
minister will never forget the day he entered a crowded prison yard
and asked how many inmates had already been found innocent.
<p>
   ``Everyone raised their hand,'' he said. Unlike prisons elsewhere,
where even blatantly guilty convicts claim they were framed, he knew
most of them were telling the truth.

   The ensuing reform campaign had the blessing of President Gonzalo
Sanchez Lozada, who last month ended a presidency full of dynamic
reforms to decentralize government and privatize moribund state
industries.
<p>
   International financial institutions and the U.S. Agency for
International Development provided funding and expertise. Despite the
enormousness of the task and the resentment of entrenched interests,
the Justice Ministry churned out landmark laws: speedier trials,
abolition of prison for debtors, re-establishment of the presumption
of innocence, pardons for selected elderly and adolescent inmates.
<p>
   The anti-drug statute also was modified to empower judges to reject
unworthy cases. Prosecution appeals to the Supreme Court were
eliminated and bail was introduced, though suspects must still
sometimes wait years for liberty.
<p>
   In a remarkable exodus from the penal system, more than 3,200
inmates were released between 1994 and 1996. Bolivia now competes with
progressive Costa Rica for the lowest percentage of inmates awaiting
trial.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Blattman's popularity reached the point that he was drafted to run
for president; he declined.
<p>
   Still, he leaves behind a work in progress. Especially in the area
of drug enforcement, human rights experts still say justice here can
be cumbersome and repressive.
<p>
   A tangible legacy of reform are the idealistic teams of lawyers who
work as federal public defenders and human rights investigators
throughout the nation. Special roving units serve harsh and remote
rural areas.
<p>
   Before the ministry created the agencies, indigent defendants were
in the hands of overwhelmed and poorly trained court-appointed private
attorneys, said Lineth Tapia, the chief public defender in the city of
Cochabamba. ``Before, most people preferred to avoid the system at all
cost,'' Tapia said. ``Lawyers were not well-regarded. Now the citizens
are beginning to recover their faith in the system.''

 &UR; Controversy Building Over Reagan/Trade Center Complex (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In an era of government downsizing, the new Ronald
Reagan Building and International Trade Center stands out. Not only is
it gigantic, it also comes with a huge price tag: $738 million.
<p>
   The structure on Pennsylvania Avenue, between the White House and
the Capitol, is the first federal building built here in 20 years. The
L-shaped complex is the biggest federal edifice after the Pentagon,
boasting 3.1 million square feet.
<p>
   Eighty-five elevators serve its 14 floors (nine above ground and
five below.) Aside from office space  &MD;  a small portion will be rented
to commercial users  &MD;  the complex includes a 650-seat auditorium, a
980-seat food court, ballrooms and a 125-foot-high atrium.
<p>
   Its construction is the last touch in more than three decades of
effort to restore vitality to Pennsylvania Avenue  &MD;  a project launched
by President Kennedy, who, after his inaugural ride from the Capitol
to the White House in 1961, was chagrined by the number of rundown
shops on Washington's most famous boulevard.
<p>
   ``This is something to be celebrated,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., a key figure in pushing the Reagan building.
<p>
   But critics are fuming. ``This is the biggest boondoggle to come
down the pike in a long time,'' said Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Tenn.
``We're ending up with a beautifully constructed building, but the
cost is ridiculous. It's lavish.''
<p>
   Duncan is especially perturbed that in the mid-1980s, when Congress
was debating whether to approve the building, the cost was put at $362
million.
<p>
   But Robert A. Peck, an official at the General Services
Administration who oversaw the construction, said the lower estimate
was provided before Congress passed provisions that caused costs to
skyrocket. For instance, legislation required the building to resemble
other nearby federal buildings, which meant slabs of limestone were
needed from a particular quarry in Indiana. Lawmakers also voted to
add the trade center to the initial design.
<p>
   ``Even though this is a high-quality building, it will save
taxpayer money in the long run,'' Peck said. That's because most of
the federal employees it ultimately will house will be leaving leased
office space. According to government estimates, the new building will
save the government $600 million in rent over 30 years.
<p>
   Since mid-July, about 1,100 employees of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Agency for International Development have
moved into the building.
<p>
   For now, they share the space with an army of construction workers.
Once it is finished next summer, the building will house up to 7,000
federal employees, including many who work for trade agencies. Private
companies specializing in trade also will be sought as tenants,
bringing in 600 more people.
<p>
   A Los Angeles-based investment bank, Quarterdeck Investment
Partners Inc., so far is the only firm to have signed a lease. But
Brian Dacey, who will manage the trade center, said he anticipates no
problem renting the 160,000 square feet of private space, noting that
nine letters of intent have been signed by prospective tenants.

 &UR; Scaffolding in Capital Skyline to Mark Monument Overhaul (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  It is the most recognizable structure in Washington, a
555-foot high obelisk almost devoid of decoration.
<p>
   The Washington Monument is about to become even more easily
distinguished: Beginning sometime this winter, it will become a
555-foot high obelisk surrounded by scaffolding.
<p>
   Winter is when the National Park Service is scheduled to begin a
three-year, $5 million repair effort that will be the most
comprehensive overhaul of the monument since it opened to the public
in 1888.
<p>
   And think of it not as the Washington Monument, but the Washington
Monument-sponsored-by-Target, the department store chain. Target is
contributing $1 million, and it has helped raise the other $4 million.
This makes Target the ``corporate partner'' of the National Park
Service and the National Park Foundation  &MD;  which are determined to
avoid the term ``sponsorship.'' Target raised the money so quickly
that the company was ready to announce the project before the Park
Service was ready to award contracts for the work.
<p>
   It's an intimidating task, the repairing of a monument, an object
meant to symbolize memory and endurance. It seems reasonable that the
pyramids of Egypt might need maintenance, or the Pantheon in Rome. But
Americans are always being told that their country, and thus its
monuments, are young.
<p>
   For the first three to four months of renovation, the obelisk will
be closed to visitors, to allow workers to replace the elevator that
travels through the shaft.
<p>
   But the largest problems are posed by aesthetics. Since the
monument dominates Washington's skyline, the skyline will be
significantly changed by the scaffolding.
<p>
   ``It is a central focus for everyone in the region. If you go
downtown in any direction, you see it first,'' says Jane Freundel
Levey, editor of the Magazine of the Historical Society of Washington.
When the scaffolding goes up, ``It is going to be a bit of a shock.''
<p>
   To minimize the visual impact, the Park Service and Target have
hired architect Michael Graves, the designer of Cincinnati's Riverbend
Music Center and Denver's new Central Library and the winner of many
awards. He has the task of making the scaffolding somehow interesting.
And of making sure that people can still glimpse the monument through
the construction maze.
<p>
   ``Most scaffolding we've done in the past has been strictly
functional,'' says Stephen Lorenzetti, the Park Service's regional
resources manager. ``The thinking at Target has been that since the
monument was going to be covered up, they wanted it to be a little
interesting, a little more than a cultural icon hidden from view.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Americans began debating whether to build a monument to honor
George Washington  &MD;  and what form it should take  &MD;  even before
Washington's death. Congress considered the issue for 40 years without
reaching a decision. In 1833, prominent citizens of the capital
finally took charge by organizing the ``Washington National Monument
Society'' and soliciting money.
<p>
   Fifteen years later, the society had raised $87,000. President Polk
attended the ceremony for the laying of the cornerstone on July 4,
1848, and construction continued until the money ran out, in 1853.
<p>
   And there it stood for nearly 25 years  &MD;  an unfinished shaft, the
marble slowly weathering, the site perhaps reverting back to wild
grasses. In 1876, President Grant ended the embarrassment, agreeing to
have the government to take over the work. The Army Corps of Engineers
completed construction at the end of 1884.
<p>
   Total cost? $1.2 million.
<p>
   Repairs began even before the obelisk was finished. Fearful that
strong winds or an earthquake might topple the structure, engineers
decided to reinforce the base. Workers installed bars over the window
and the elevator shaft after a series of suicides in the early 1900s,
repointed the mortar in the 1930s and cleaned and polished the stone
in the 1960s.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   The stone work will begin after work on the elevator and the air
conditioning system is done. Park Service officials hope to complete
the project by 2000.
<p>
   ``These rehabilitations are larger than any one repair to go in and
fix a short circuit,'' says Earle Kittleman, a Park Service spokesman.
``It is a recognition that structures age and deteriorate with time,
and we at the Park Service are the stewards of these shrines of
American democracy.''

 &UR; Campaign Finance Panel Sets Its Sights on Gore (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  It is a political confrontation of a unique and
unusually intimate sort.
<p>
   This week, hearings on campaign fund raising, chaired by Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., are scheduled to turn the spotlight on the man
whose former Senate seat Thompson now holds: Vice President Al Gore.
<p>
   When the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee reconvenes, it will
focus on a fund-raiser Gore attended last April at a Buddhist temple
outside Los Angeles  &MD;  a site Democrats later acknowledged was
painfully inappropriate. It is unlikely Gore will be called to testify
himself, but photographs of the vice president at the temple and
questions about his role will be prominent.
<p>
   With Gore considered the front-runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination three years from now, and Thompson a potential
contender for the GOP nod, the week's proceedings may someday be seen
as a crucial early skirmish in the 2000 race for the White House. They
also mark the first collision of two ambitious and skilled Tennessee
politicians who have managed to stay almost entirely out of each
other's way throughout their careers.
<p>
   ``They never were adversaries,'' said one Gore intimate, ``because
they never had to be.''
<p>
   That all will change this week, as Thompson summons a series of
witnesses from the Hsi Lai Temple for what could prove the most
colorful, and widely televised, testimony of the hearings so far. And
though the temple affair is likely the most dramatic, it is only one
of the committee's lines of inquiry that could lead to Gore. Others
range from questions about the vice president's role in the overall
Democratic campaign fund-raising efforts, particularly solicitation
calls he made from his office, and the role of his former Senate chief
of staff in lobbying for major Democratic donors who did business with
the administration.
<p>
   ``There is substantial exposure left'' for the vice president in
the hearings, said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a member of the
investigating committee. Gore's role in the controversy, he added,
will face ``substantial questioning.''
<p>
   With Republicans pointed down that track, the investigation poses a
direct political risk for Gore. But the proceedings are proving to
contain a surprising degree of political risk as well for Thompson,
who appeared with other potential GOP presidential aspirants last
month at a party gathering in Indianapolis.
<p>
   Widely heralded as a rising GOP star after his election in 1994,
Thompson has faced second-guessing from Republicans unhappy with his
willingness to look into alleged GOP fund-raising abuses. Democrats
question his allegations that there is an ongoing Chinese plot to
``subvert'' American elections. While the hearings in July advanced
the story of the 1996 fund-raising abuses on many fronts, they have
not yet produced a blockbuster revelation to rivet the public's
attention.
<p>
   ``Presumably the hearings offered Thompson an opportunity to
catapult onto the national stage,'' said Guy Molyneux, a Democratic
pollster. ``But that opportunity is slipping away from him.''
<p>
   Thompson has done his best to discourage such analysis. On NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press'' earlier this summer, he forcefully pointed out that
he has not ``actively considered or ... done anything'' to prepare for
a possible presidential bid. And he disputes the notion that the
inquiry has taken particular aim at Gore, as many Democrats allege.
<p>
   ``I've not talked about any individual, whether it be the president
or the vice president or anybody else in terms of where they stand in
the order of things,'' Thompson said. ``I'm not going to do that, and
I don't think it would be fair.''
<p>
   Yet Thompson appears keenly aware of the drama inherent in the
implicit showdown between Tennessee's two best-known politicians:
``Never occurred to me ...,'' Thompson said  &MD;  before breaking into a
broad grin.
<p>
   Administration officials maintain that, in fact, Thompson is
gunning for Gore.
<p>
   ``The Republicans are focusing their attacks on the vice president
every chance they get, and I think it has everything to do with 2000
politics,'' said a White House official.
<p>
   While the Senate inquiry marks the first direct clash of interests
between the two men, they long have worked at cross purposes. In 1970,
for example, Thompson  &MD;  then a young attorney  &MD;  worked in the Senate
campaign of Republican Bill Brock, who unseated Gore's father, Al Gore
Sr. And in 1994, Gore campaigned for Democrat Jim Cooper, who Thompson
swept past to capture the seat Gore vacated when he was elected vice
president.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   In personal style, the two men offer a study in contrasts. Gore,
50, has always been seen as a straight arrow  &MD;  a buttoned-down
senator's son so methodical and cautious that he has jokingly compared
himself to a mechanical robot. Thompson, 54, has a shambling, even
roguish, charm that hints of a man whose idea of long-term planning is
to buy his wine by the case instead of the bottle.
<p>
   In each instance, the picture can be overly simplified: Off camera,
Gore can be bitingly funny, and beneath his easygoing manner, Thompson
has shown an eye for the brass ring in his steady rise from the tiny
Tennessee town of Lawrenceburg.
<p>
   Yet the basic portrait remains accurate: Many who know him say
Thompson isn't as single-mindedly focused on winning the presidency as
Gore  &MD;  or for that matter, the other nationally prominent politician
in Tennessee, former Republican governor and 1996 presidential
candidate Lamar Alexander. Characteristically, Alexander is already
assembling support for a second bid in 2000, which could prove a major
hurdle for Thompson should he decide to run because the two men's
bases of financial support largely overlap.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Given their personalities, it's almost ironic that it is the
circumspect vice president who finds himself accused of cutting
corners in the search for campaign cash. The hearings already have
produced one new revelation about Gore: He attended a private
Democratic National Committee dinner in 1993 whose other participants
included John Huang, who was then still at the Indonesia-based Lippo
Group, and the head of a Chinese government-owned company that is a
Lippo business partner.
<p>
   Gore finds himself in the committee's sights initially over his
appearance at the April 29, 1996, lunch at the Hsi Lai Temple in
Hacienda Heights, Calif., which raised $140,000. Democrats later
acknowledged that it was inappropriate to hold the event  &MD;  organized
by Huang and Los Angeles immigration counselor Maria L. Hsia  &MD;  in a
Buddhist temple. Eventually the party was forced to return nearly half
the money after it could not verify that the donors were legal
residents or that the individuals who made the donations were the
actual source of the funds.
<p>
   Temple officials have told reporters and investigators that the
temple reimbursed about a dozen nuns and temple devotees for their
contributions. Federal law prohibits such a reimbursement and requires
the disclosure of the true source of funds.
<p>
   When the temple fund-raiser was first disclosed, Gore said he
believed it was only a ``community event.'' Later, his staff
acknowledged that he knew the session was ``finance-related.'' But he
has continued to insist that he did not believe the event was a
fund-raiser.
<p>
   Committee Republicans have released some documents attempting to
challenge that portrayal. But in the hearings' first week, former
Democratic National Committee finance director Richard Sullivan
supported Gore's account, saying Huang had assured both he and the
vice president's staff that no one was required to make a contribution
to attend the lunch. Sullivan also testified that Gore had been
unaware money was collected at the lunch. Those attending included
people who had already donated to the DNC, potential future donors and
those who brought checks to the event itself.
<p>
   The temple event had sparked some of the most intense backstage
squabbling of the Senate investigation. Committee Democrats initially
resisted the GOP's efforts to provide immunity for several key
witnesses involved in the incident before joining the majority in
voting to do so. Republican staffers had maintained that the Democrats
were attempting to protect Gore.
<p>
   Still unresolved is whether the committee will seek testimony from
Gore  &MD;  on either the temple event or his broader role in the Clinton
financial effort, particularly the more than 75 telephone calls Gore
made from the White House to solicit campaign funds. Committee
investigators say Thompson would not take such a step lightly.

 &UR; Immigration Sweep Stirs Cloud of Controversy (Chandler, Ariz.) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHANDLER, Ariz.  &MD;  On a recent morning, while driving home from the
store, Catalina Veloz was pulled over by a Chandler police officer who
had a question. In Spanish, he asked, ``Got your papers?''
<p>
   The query puzzled the 35-year-old security guard and lifelong
Arizona resident.
<p>
   ``I said, `I've got toilet paper, writing paper and newspaper  &MD; 
what kind do you want?' '' she recalled. ``He said, `No, your
immigration papers.' ''
<p>
   The officer and his companion, a Border Patrol agent, threatened to
deport Veloz until she convinced them, in forceful English, that ``I
was born here!''
<p>
   Later the same day, a Border Patrol agent on a bicycle followed her
into a parking lot near her home and asked, ``Where's your papers?''
<p>
   ``What the hell did you ask me?'' she responded indignantly. ``I
was born here! I went to school here! I raised four kids here! Do I
have to tattoo the words `U.S. Citizen' on my forehead?''
<p>
   Veloz is among 16 Chandler residents who filed a $35 million
class-action lawsuit accusing the city of civil rights violations
during a five-day roundup of 432 undocumented workers in late July.
Adding to the outrage, local authorities conceded that the crackdown
targeted a downtown redevelopment area anchored by small businesses
catering to Latinos.
<p>
   Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods has launched an investigation
of the sweep, the largest ever in this boomtown of 165,000 people  &MD;  19
percent of whom are Latino  &MD;  just south of Phoenix. The probe aims to
determine whether some residents were harassed or treated unfairly on
the basis of their national origin, ethnicity or skin color.
<p>
   ``We have to get to the bottom of what went on there and make sure
that if people were stopped because of the color of their skin, it
never happens again in Arizona or the United States,'' Woods said.
``In my state ... to be Hispanic is to be part of our state's
heritage.''
<p>
   Still, complaints are increasing now that federal authorities are
teaming up with local police and sheriff's deputies in immigration
sweeps. Recent operations have been conducted in Denver; Tucson,
Ariz.; Flagstaff, Ariz., and Little Rock, Ark.
<p>
   Last September, police officers and federal agents in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., rounded up 150 legal and illegal Latino workers, inked numbers
on their arms and hauled them off to jail in patrol cars and a horse
trailer soiled with manure. In January, a similar sweep in Crescent
City, Fla., spawned a lawsuit alleging violations of
search-and-seizure laws.
<p>
   In most cases, these sweeps were conducted after local police had
received almost daily complaints from residents who accused
undocumented workers of public drunkenness, loitering and burglary.
<p>
   The Chandler operation was different, critics say. They contend
that the city wants to drive Latinos, whether they are legal or
illegal residents, out of the downtown redevelopment area. Officials
hope the area will one day compete with upscale civic centers in Mesa,
Tempe and Scottsdale.
<p>
   Chandler Assistant City Manager Patrick McDermott said ``the
objective of the operation between the Chandler Police Department and
the Border Patrol was to address the problems related to illegal
immigrants in the redevelopment area.''
<p>
   But Stephen Montoya, the Phoenix civil rights lawyer who filed the
lawsuit, said, ``We're suing them for racism because their primary
criterion for stopping people was skin color, a practice that is
against the law.''
<p>
   Jose Garcia, a Vietnam combat veteran and retired Mesa Police
Department lieutenant, agreed.
<p>
   Standing in front of his small video rental business in the shadow
of Chandler City Hall, Garcia said: ``The police were way out of
bounds. One of our customers was stopped four times within a single
block while on her way home on foot.
<p>
   ``They were looking for dark-skinned workers speaking Spanish,'' he
said, shaking his head. ``And they thought we'd just take it. They
were very wrong.''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Given that the city is facing a lawsuit, officials are reluctant to
discuss the sweep, let alone charges of civil rights violations.
However, Chandler Mayor Jay Tibshraeny recently told a gathering of
200 Latinos that the city will never again engage in such an
operation.
<p>
   Chandler Police Department spokesman Sgt. Ken Phillips would not go
that far. But Phillips, who denied that anyone was stopped without
probable cause, acknowledged that the operation was flawed.
<p>
   ``We concede that we could have done things to soften the
impression  &MD;  so we've learned too,'' he said. ``We are now considering
suggestions, including that we notify the Mexican consulate and
community leaders before we implement another operation.''
<p>
   Those concessions are not sufficient for Veloz.
<p>
   ``I feel degraded, like people are looking at me. I feel like the
stuff you scrape off the bottom of your shoes,'' she said.

 &UR; HELP WANTED: No Overtime for a Nurse With Beeper &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Dear Help Wanted: I am a registered nurse at a hospital and am paid
an hourly wage. I am also required to carry a beeper and be on call to
handle emergencies 24 hours days for one- to two-week periods. I don't
usually have to go to the hospital. But I often answer time-consuming
phone calls on managerial matters such as how to rearrange schedules
or find someone to assist in surgery. Yet I am not paid any overtime.
Is it legal to expect me to be on call without being compensated?
 &MD; Feeling Underpaid
<p>
   Dear Feeling: This sounds like split-personality management. Your
company treats you like you're on the clock when it pays you an hourly
wage, but it then treats you like a manager when it refuses to pay you
for all the time you worked. Your employer can't have it both ways. I
asked the feds and New York state to weigh in on this question.
<p>
   In general, registered nurses are exempt from overtime payments
because they are considered professionals, said Irv Miljoner, who
heads the U.S. Labor Department's Long Island, N.Y., office. State and
federal laws generally define workers in this overtime-exempt category
as those who fall in the professional, administrative, executive and
outside-sales categories.
<p>
   ``However, this exemption is contingent on their being salaried,''
Miljoner said. ``If they're being paid an hourly wage, it pretty much
defeats the exemption.''
<p>
   Since you earn an hourly wage, you should be paid for the time you
work, Miljoner said. And you must be paid overtime  &MD;  1½ times your
regular hourly rate  &MD;  for every hour over 40 you work in a week.
<p>
   When a beeper is involved, it's not always clear whether a worker
is entitled to overtime pay. I would check on your status. The
exempt/nonexempt categories aren't arbitrary and they have important
implications, such as overtime pay for those who are not exempt.
<p>

 &UR; As Water Sales Soar, Bottlers Try to Distinguish Their Products &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The sketch on the ocean-blue labels wrapped around bottles of
Aquafina drinking water looks just like a snowcapped mountain range.
<p>
   But the water, which is bottled by Pepsi-Cola Co. and has rocketed
up the sales charts of an industry whose overall sales are exploding,
does not come from a mountain spring at all. It's not even from a
country well or a flowing stream.
<p>
   It's filtered tap water from 11 cities across the country  &MD; 
including Houston, Wichita, Kan., and Fresno, Calif.  &MD;  whose supplies
may not spring to mind as the most pristine or refreshing.
<p>
   As the public's passion for bottled water continues to heat up, a
debate over the sources of the more than 3 million gallons sold last
year in the United States has taken center stage.
<p>
   The water merchants, ranging from Pepsi-Cola and Perrier to a
Georgia landowner who adds clove and licorice flavoring, look for ways
to make the water seem special and increase sales at the same time.
<p>
   They argue about the value and popularity of minerals, the merits
of reverse osmosis and ozonation, the advantages of having one water
source or several, and the challenges of rising production.
<p>
   Competitors complain that Pepsi-Cola is misleading consumers with
the mountain sketch on bottles of ``purified'' Aquafina. The leading
brands are also keeping a close eye on the fast growth of newcomer
Dannon, which plays up its brand name (same as the yogurt) rather than
its sources.
<p>
   Neighbors of a Great Bear spring in Pennsylvania charge that
Perrier, which owns that regional brand and several others, including
Poland Spring and Deer Park, plans to expand production so much that
their trout streams and wells could dry up.
<p>
   ``People here see this bottled water as a luxury for yuppies vs.
something they need to flush their toilets and take a shower,'' said
Jerry Centofanti, regional program manager for water supply management
at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
<p>
   Some bottlers say many of the ``natural spring waters'' are not all
that natural because the water is trucked around and then shot with
ozone and ultraviolet light to kill bacteria before it is bottled.
<p>
   The trick for bottlers is to sell their brands in a wide area  &MD; 
possibly the whole nation  &MD;  without drowning in high transportation
expenses that can far exceed the cost of the water itself, often as
little as a few cents per bottle.
<p>
   U.S. sales of bottled water, including water cooler jugs, shot up 8
percent last year to 3.1 million gallons, or 11.7 gallons a person,
according to the Beverage Marketing Corp. of New York. That includes a
nearly 25 percent jump for plastic bottles holding 1.5 liters and
less.
<p>
   ``It fits in with today's healthier lifestyles,'' said Gary
Hemphill, vice president of Beverage Marketing, adding that bottled
water has increasingly become an alternative not just to tap water but
also to soft drinks.
<p>
   The sales and per capita consumption levels for bottled water have
more than doubled over the past 10 years  &MD;  faster growth than any
other beverage category except iced teas and sports drinks. The
industry even managed to overcome the discovery in 1990 that traces of
cancer-causing benzene had been found in some bottles of Perrier
sparkling water. Perrier temporarily halted bottling at a plant in
France and launched a worldwide recall.
<p>
   Much of the growth in bottled-water sales over the past two decades
has been in non-sparkling, or non-carbonated, water, which represents
more than 85 percent of U.S. sales.
<p>
   In fact, Perrier, long identified with its bubbly water in green
bottles, has gobbled up regional brands of non-sparkling water across
the country in recent years, from Zephyrhills in Florida to Arrowhead
in California. Perrier Group of America, whose Paris-based parent
company is controlled by Nestle of Switzerland, now grabs more than 26
percent of U.S. bottled-water sales.
<p>
   But even Perrier is frustrated that it can't afford to distribute
its very popular and fast-growing Poland Spring brand much beyond the
Northeast. The brand, founded in 1845 in Poland, Maine, focuses its
marketing on its sole use of wells tapping into an underground
reservoir amid 400 wooded acres.
<p>
   ``I would love to be selling Poland Spring in California, but I
would have to sell it at a price that's higher than all of the other
domestic waters because I am bringing it 3,000 miles across the
country,'' said Jeff Caso, vice president of marketing at the Perrier
Group in Greenwich, Conn.
<p>
   In contrast, the Deer Park brand has spread from its original
source in Deer Park, Md., to springs in New Tripoli and Valley View,
Pa.; Freedom, N.H.; and Montverde, Fla.
<p>
   Critics say using more than one source is cheating.
<p>
   ``Water is a living thing, so if you are using more than one
source, it's not the same water each time,'' said Bill Mimnaugh, U.S.
managing director for Spa Monopole Corp. in Greenwich, which imports
bottled water from the town of Spa in Belgium. Spa has been exporting
water for more than 400 years.
<p>
   After complaints that images of glaciers and waterfalls on labels
were misleading consumers, the Food and Drug Administration tightened
labeling rules for bottled water last year and more clearly defined
each type, including artesian well, mineral, purified and spring
water. The FDA also expanded the list of contaminants that bottlers
must test for, to 83.
<p>
   Executives at bottling companies, who realize that image still
counts for a lot, are extremely sensitive when it comes to questions
about sources.
<p>
   A U.S. spokesman for Danone Group, the Paris-based company that
markets Evian, double-checked with executives before revealing that
another brand the company owns, Dannon, uses two sources: a spring in
Piedmont, Canada, and AquaPenn Springs in Graysville, Pa., which is
owned by an outside bottling company.
<p>
   Unlike its strategy with Evian, marketed as untreated, unfiltered
water from a legendary spring in France, Danone is depending on the
reputation of Dannon yogurts to market Dannon water.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Perrier is rolling out a brand called Oasis that will
use several spring sources across the country, and wants to make it a
national brand. Aquafina, by Pepsi-Cola, is also going national. And
it doesn't bother with springs at all.
<p>
   Bottlers say American tastes contrast sharply with those of
Europeans, who prefer bottled water with much higher levels of
minerals such as magnesium and calcium despite the stronger taste. In
Europe, Vittel, for instance, has 20 times the mineral content as
Poland Spring. The version of Vittel imported to the United States has
half the levels of the European one, though.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Spring water bottlers point out that their supplies usually come
from protected underground reservoirs, unlike the usually chlorinated
surface supplies of municipalities. Still, water bottlers have run
into some resistance as they expand.
<p>
   Perrier Group has met opposition to increased production in
Pennsylvania and Florida. Perrier recently decided to dig a well next
to its Great Bear springs to supply its bottling plant in Allentown,
Pa. The well would enable Perrier to pump out 95,000 gallons a day,
which neighbors fear could damage nearby Pigeon Creek during dry
spells.
<p>
   Similarly, some residents of Crystal Springs, Fla., said they are
worried about Perrier's plans to start drawing 10 times more spring
water for its Zephyrhills brand.
<p>
   ``We have more vested in keeping the resources plentiful than even
local folks do,'' Perrier's Caso said.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Bottled-water mania has taken some unusual twists.
<p>
   After Nancy Panoz bought 73 acres in Blairsville, Ga., she found
that the underground aquifer was a good source and opened a bottling
plant. Her twist: tiny additions of lemon, lime, tangerine, ginger,
clove and anisette flavors.
<p>
   ``It's just enough to leave a hint of taste in your mouth,'' she
said.

<p>
   The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the other passengers was
an accident caused by bad decisions and bad driving, not by the
celebrity photographers following her and not by her fans who eagerly
consume the images they produce.
<p>
   Reports Monday that the limousine driver was under the influence of
alcohol only make it more clear that it was persons inside the car who
ultimately were responsible for what happened.
<p>
   The emotional blaming of the media not only fails to recognize the
role alcohol apparently played, but also does not account for the
class-based relationships among persons in the car, which I believe
contributed to the high-speed tragedy. Beyond this, holding the media
responsible for this highly symbolic yet isolated incident
misunderstands the absolute necessity for vigorous journalism  &MD;  even
media scandals  &MD;  in democracies such as ours.
<p>
   Imagine the pressure felt by the driver of the Mercedes as he
attempted to whisk across town ``the most recognizable person in the
world'' and  &MD;  even more important  &MD;  Dodi Fayed, whose father owns the
Ritz Hotel, employer of the man behind the wheel. Though the
photographers indeed may have been chasing more than following the
limousine, some person or persons inside the car decided to take
evasive action from the annoying entourage in the rear-view mirror.
<p>
   We may never learn what really happened. But what's clear is that
whoever made the decision to race that Mercedes into the tunnel was
not a photographer. What's more, no one has alleged that the
photographers or anyone else were pursuing the princess and her
boyfriend with anything more dangerous than a 35-millimeter camera.
<p>
   Let's hope that the hysteria about the media's role in the accident
fades in the discussions that will follow. What must never be
forgotten is the indisputable requirement of a free and vigorous press
in the Western world's delicate system of checks and balances on
social power.
<p>
   The princess of Wales detested the intrusion of the media into her
private life, but at the same time she cultivated that attention and
benefited from it in many ways. So did her various humanitarian
efforts, particularly the recent attempts to get the world to notice
the harm caused by land mines in Angola, Bosnia and Cambodia.
<p>
   Putting the unglamorous land mine issue on the world's moral agenda
could only have been accomplished by combining the appeal of a
celebrity spokesperson with the technological reach and impact of mass
media.
<p>
   The underlying factor in all of this is visibility, wanted and
unwanted. When a princess or a president wants media attention, he or
she gets it. But if we allow media celebrities  &MD;  political figures,
sports heroes, movie stars, billionaire business people, pop musicians
and yes, members of the royal family  &MD;  to limit the contexts in which
they are viewed and pondered, then we would miss out on lots of
important history. We'd have a very different view, for instance, of
the late former President Nixon, O.J. Simpson, Jim Bakker, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, even Hillary Rodham Clinton, among many others.
<p>
   Media visibility holds accountable those who influence us by means
of their political, economic or cultural power, which itself often is
won through media exposure. The tragedy last Saturday night in Paris,
emotionally wrenching as it is, must finally be understood in a much
wider and more significant sense. While some revision of the rules
regulating invasion of celebrities' privacy may be appropriate, the
visibility and accountability that the news media guarantee  &MD; 
sometimes in quite unpleasant ways  &MD;  is fundamental to democracy and
must survive.

<HEADLINE>
 &UR; Mother Teresa or Mrs. Simpson: Which Was the Real Diana? &QL; 
 &UR; Hitchens is author of ``The Monarchy: A Critique.'' He wrote about &QL; 
 &UR; Princess Diana in his column in this month's Vanity Fair. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   To say that Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed by those seeking
publicity is as absurd as it is to say that she was killed by seeking
it herself. The speed limits are the same for everybody; there are
some dangers from which a bodyguard cannot protect you; if you wish to
dine incognito, then it is probably best to avoid the Paris Ritz.
<p>
   These are the few, paltry ``lessons'' of her death. It is human and
natural to attempt to invest accidents with meaning, but the urge to
do so is not always controlled by the rational faculty. Look at the
simple members of the British public, carpeting the approach to
Buckingham Palace with flowers. After all this drama and strife, they
have not grasped the salient fact that Diana no longer was a member of
the royal family; that, indeed, that family had cast her out and now,
grotesquely, becomes the proprietor of her children.
<p>
   We ought to beware of too easy a surrender to the vicarious
identification that makes us address people whom we have never met
(``Di,'' ``O.J.,'' ``Ollie'') by their first names. This synthetic
informality may mask hysterical symptoms. With one hand, we deplore
the cult of ``celebrity'' and the celebration of the nonevent; with
the other, we forward both these phenomena by our very language. This
was not, as some oafish spokesman from Buckingham Palace apparently
told CNN, ``an accident waiting to happen.'' It was just an accident,
of the sort that happens to people whether they symbolize ``life in
the fast lane'' or otherwise.
<p>
   Princess Diana had only been free of her miserable marriage for a
year and a day when she was killed, so we will never know what kind of
adult she might have become. In one incarnation, the angel of mercy in
Angola and Bosnia, she not only looked fetching but actually had the
power to alter policies and opinions. (One of her last acts was to
break with protocol and issue a stern attack on the former British
government for its blinkered policy on land mines.) In the other
incarnation, she was drawn to jet-setting, disco-minded, super-rich
sybaritism. It is a safe bet that, if she had carried on her
relationship with Dodi Fayed, son of billionaire Mohammed Fayed, she
would have been swallowed up by the world of the brittle and the
spoiled and might even have ended up in the Paris chateau--now owned
by the uncontrollably ambitious Fayed senior--in which the Duke of
Windsor and Mrs. Simpson ended their ill-spent days. Now we will never
know which aspect of her character would have emerged as the dominant
one.
<p>
   These and other speculations are enough to dispense with the stupid
call for more laws to protect the ``privacy'' of the rich and famous.
In the greater part of her public life, Princess Diana was a voluntary
member of a controversial hereditary monarchy. In pursuit of a
personal solution to an unhappy private life, she became an assiduous
leaker to the press. The first thing deserved public scrutiny and the
second one invited it.

 &UR; Diana's Death Cuts Short the Promise &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   She entered the room and brought with her a halo of light: a tall,
coltish, impossibly elegant young woman; her cheeks flushed, her skin
like English cream; a nose like that of a Greek statue; eyes the color
of sapphires and hair like a crown of shining gold.
<p>
   Dressed in a lipstick-red suit with a white shawl collar and
wearing stiletto-heeled shoes that made her long, suntanned legs  &MD;  she
wore no stockings  &MD;  seem even longer, Diana, Princess of Wales, had
the effect she always had: She stopped traffic.
<p>
   It has been a dozen years since I watched Diana, accompanied by
Prince Charles, enter the drawing room of the British Embassy
residence in Washington to have tea with a small group of selected
members of the press.
<p>
   Billed as ``an informal social occasion'' in honor of Diana's first
visit to Washington, the assembled reporters were served assorted hors
d'oeuvres on silver trays and beverages by tuxedoed embassy staffers.
<p>
   But the food and ambience were not what we'd come to see. What we
had all come to see was Diana. Reporters were just as fascinated with
her as the crowds who lined the Washington streets to cheer Diana!
Diana! Diana!
<p>
   Charming and without affectation, Diana did not disappoint as she
chatted informally about the weather  &MD;  ``Lovely!''  &MD;  and her lack of
sleep  &MD;  ``No one seems to believe that even a young person can get
very tired on such a grueling trip as this one.''
<p>
   She laughed, shyly, as she told reporters she was a fan of the
American TV show ``Dynasty'' and the cartoon strip ``Peanuts.''
Reporters laughed, too.
<p>
   But beneath the laughter, even then, there was a sadness about her.
In repose, her face often seemed shadowed with a weariness beyond her
years. And, of course, there was the way she looked at you: sideways
or with eyes downcast or half-closed.
<p>
   Perhaps such a way of seeing protected her from being overwhelmed
by the attention that followed her everywhere.
<p>
   Or perhaps it was her way of not seeing the cameras constantly
thrust into her face and the screaming headlines that stripped away
almost every vestige of a private life.
<p>
   From the first pre-marriage pictures of an unsuspecting Diana
snapped in a dress made diaphanous by sunlight to the recent tabloid
photos of her Mediterranean tryst with 41-year-old Dodi Fayed
photographers tracked her down.
<p>
   Nothing about Diana, it seems, was off-limits.
<p>
   On Saturday night, her public life ended the way it began: with
Diana running from the paparazzi.
<p>
   Now the world's most photographed woman has passed into legend. But
not before giving us a tantalizing glimpse of the woman she might have
become.
<p>
   A recent Vanity Fair cover shows a new Diana. Gone is the
bulimic-looking, overdressed and coiffed Diana. In her place we see a
healthy, toned-and-sleek Diana with minimal makeup and a wash-and-wear
hairstyle.
<p>
   Gone, too, is the downcast look. This Diana gazes openly into the
camera. She looks like a woman ready to get on with the next part of
her life.
<p>
   ``There is a kind of serenity about her,'' Gianni Versace told
Vanity Fair at the time the photograph was shot. ``It is a moment in
her life, I think, when she's found herself  &MD;  the way she wants to
live.''
<p>
   But how did Diana want to live? What could she draw on to propel
herself from the old life to a new and better one?
<p>
   After all, she had gone from a painful childhood bereft of parental
love  &MD;  her mother left the family when Diana was 6  &MD;  to a painful,
loveless marriage during which she was publicly rejected by her
husband.
<p>
   She had gone from blushing ingenue to fairy-tale princess and
mother; from a woman scorned to a single, divorced parent. Along the
way, she had starved herself and made some half-hearted suicide
attempts.
<p>
   Little help came from the Royal Family  &MD;  or ``The Firm'' as they
like to call themselves. Bred to be stiff-upper-lip and rigid in their
monarchic lifestyle, the Royals didn't seem to understand Diana.
<p>
   What were they to make of a young woman who could cry openly at the
sight of a child dying from AIDS?
<p>
   In all her life, it seems, Diana had no one to turn to.
<p>
   And yet, Diana herself was to become known and loved as a warm and
compassionate woman. Against all odds she was, at her deepest core, a
woman of strong maternal feeling.
<p>
   Battered women, AIDS patients, lepers, sick and handicapped
children, the homeless. To much of society, they were the
``untouchables.''
<p>
   Not to Diana: She was always there, touching them, stroking their
hair or holding a hand. And she used her news value to see that
photographers were there to call attention to the plight of such
people.
<p>
   In the last year of her life, things seemed to be coming together
for Diana. It appeared she had shaken off her sadness about the
breakup of her marriage and was carving out a life in which charity
projects figured prominently. In Britain she was deeply admired for
the seriousness of such efforts, particularly her recent campaign to
ban anti-personnel land mines.
<p>
   But her deepest devotion was reserved for her two young sons,
Prince William and Prince Harry. She was determined, she said, to
counteract the stiffness and rigidity of the monarchy by instilling in
her sons a sense of compassion and sympathy.
<p>
   She was determined to make them feel loved, too. She was going to
give them ``plenty of kisses and comforting, too.''
<p>
   Diana always seemed to be comforting someone. From a small girl who
lost her legs to a land mine to Elton John at the funeral of Gianni
Versace, Diana was not afraid to reach out.
<p>
   But she was still searching, it seems, for a satisfying personal
life.
<p>
   To an observer, her choice in men seemed precarious. She seemed to
be looking for a man who would offer her unconditional love and a safe
haven from an unstable world, much as Jackie Kennedy Onassis did. It
is the kind of love a child seeks from a parent; the kind of love that
if you had as a child, you don't need as an adult.
<p>
   Still, it seems clear that Diana was trying to move forward in her
life. Some say she was on the threshold of a new and better life.
<p>
   Now we will never know.
<p>
   Instead we are left to wonder about the road that Diana, Princess
of Wales, might have taken had she lived; about the influence she
might have had on Prince William, the future king of England; about
the personal happiness  &MD;  or sadness  &MD;  she might have known.
<p>
   Now that Diana is a part of history, how will we remember her?
<p>
   Some say it is her beauty and grace we will remember. Others say
her legacy lies in the compassion and love she brought to all she met.
<p>
   But perhaps we should also remember Diana, Princess of Wales, as we
remember a lost child.
<p>
   She is like the child who dies on the cusp of coming into her own;
the child whose promise is cut short, leaving us to grieve what might
have been.
<p>
   Now Diana is gone, leaving a small darkness where her light once
shone.
<p>
   How strange it feels without her.

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Fresh gold leaf gleams from onion domes, the
``wedding-cake'' Stalinscrapers are now yellow instead of gray, and
the notorious potholes of the main thoroughfares have disappeared
under new asphalt.
<p>
   As Moscow spruces up for the Sept. 5 to 7 celebration of its 850th
anniversary, this most sinister of European capitals has benefited
from a face-lift. But in keeping with the contrived nature of the
birthday bash, the key events and civic improvements are mostly

   Coming soon to a city near (some) of you: the world's tallest sand
sculpture. At least, that's what Gerry Kirk of Solana Beach, co-holder
of the current Guinness record, and other sculptors from 18 countries
hope to construct on Fiesta Island in San Diego's Mission Bay.
<p>
   The castle, begun Aug. 14 and titled ``Lost City of Atlantis,'' is
due to be finished Thursday as the centerpiece of a nearly monthlong
first annual San Diego International SandFest. There will be food
courts, crafts booths, lessons in sandcastle building and
entertainment. The site will be open daily 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. through
Sept. 30, spokeswoman Jackie Evers said.
<p>
   One-day tickets to the site will cost $8 for adults, $7 for seniors
and the military, and be free for children 6 and under. They can be
bought on site or ordered in advance through Ticketmaster (tel. (619)
220-TIXS). Information: tel. toll-free (888) 310-7263.
<p>
   Kirk and crew hope to build a castle more than 60 feet tall and 480

   The Civil War's bloodiest battle will be reenacted Sept. 12 to 14
in Maryland in what organizers say is one of the largest Civil War
restagings ever.
<p>
   As of last week about 9,400 people had signed up to recreate the
Battle of Antietam, which raged nearly 135 years ago on Sept. 17,
1862. The restaging will be near Hagerstown on the Artz Farm, about 10
miles north of the original site. Hagerstown-area hotels are mostly
booked for the event, organizers say, but the site can be visited as a
day trip from Baltimore or Washington, D.C. Daily tickets ($9 adults,
$6 students) can be bought on site. Call toll-free (888) 248-4597.

 &UR; Health Officials Launch Campaign to Determine How Widespread &QL; 
 &UR; AIDS Virus Is &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   How many Americans are infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus? Where is it spreading most rapidly? How many new infections
occur each year?
<p>
   The answer is: Nobody knows.
<p>
   Precise information about such questions would seem necessary to
plot the spreading ripples of the AIDS epidemic. But federal health
officials can only guess at how many people are infected with HIV,
because most of the available sources of national data track cases of
AIDS  &MD;  the full-blown disease  &MD;  and not cases of new or recent
infection with the virus that causes it.
<p>
   As a result, officials can't be certain whether the current decline
in AIDS deaths is matched by a similar slowing of the epidemic as a
whole.
<p>
   The most recent estimate of the number of Americans infected  &MD; 
750,000  &MD;  is only half the total that government officials used to
cite a decade ago, at a time when experts believed that as many as 1.5
million people carried the virus. (They later revised that figure,
saying that in the mid-1980s only about 450,000 people were infected.)
The official estimate of how many Americans become infected with HIV
each year  &MD;  40,000  &MD;  hasn't budged since 1991.
<p>
   Such uncertainty persists because, without some way of counting new
infections, AIDS experts have very little to go on. ``There has never
been a broad-based national ... system'' for tracking the spread of
HIV through blood testing, said Rob Janssen, acting director of the
CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention-Surveillance and Epidemiology.
``It's very hard to do and extremely expensive.''
<p>
   Since the epidemic began, the count of AIDS cases has served as an
indirect measure of the number of people infected. To arrive at the
latter figure, health officials assumed that the majority of people
who contracted the virus would develop the disease within a certain
interval  &MD;  say, 10 years. They therefore employed a technique called
``back calculation,'' using figures on AIDS cases and deaths to
estimate how many Americans were infected at any point in time.
<p>
   Such calculations, combined with periodic surveys of various
samples of the population, are the source of current government
estimates of infection rates. For instance, the CDC estimates six of
every 1,000 adult or adolescent males and one of every 1,000 adult or
adolescent females in the United States is infected with the virus.
<p>
   But with the advent of new drugs that slow the multiplication of
the virus and help keep infected people healthy, the time from
infection until the onset of illness has become much less constant and
predictable. In order to keep on top of new developments in the
epidemic  &MD;  including watching for the emergence of drug-resistant
strains of HIV  &MD;  health officials say they now need better information
on where and when new cases of infection are occurring.
<p>
   ``We've always known that AIDS (cases) did not represent the full
number of people in (medical) care, much less the number just living
with HIV,'' said John Ward, chief of the HIV/AIDS surveillance branch
at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
<p>
   ``We need to do a better job of conducting surveillance of the
whole HIV epidemic now, because AIDS (cases) will probably be
increasingly less representative of that total population, and more
representative of people who have either entered care very late or who
have failed therapy,'' he added.
<p>
   AIDS advocacy organizations concur with the need for a better way
of tracking cases of HIV infection, but say such a system should also
study how the new treatments are changing the total picture of the
epidemic.
<p>
   ``All of us recognize that the disease is different today,'' said
A. Cornelius Baker, executive director of the National Association of
People With AIDS. ``For us to understand where new infections are
occurring, what is the impact of these treatments, what is now the
natural history of the disease once treatment has been entered into  &MD; 
all of that requires us to have a monitoring system of some sort.''
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   Tracking new infections nationally would require doing regular
blood tests on a sample of people chosen to be representative of the
entire U.S. population, Janssen said. The closest approximation to
such a sample was a national survey that anonymously tested newborn
infants in order to measure infection rates in the nation's
childbearing women.
<p>
   Federal funding for that program was suspended in May 1995 after
opponents argued that because effective treatment for AIDS was
available, it was unethical to perform such tests without giving
patients the results.
<p>
   The CDC stopped monitoring the frequency of HIV infection in
hospitalized patients last year. The agency still tracks HIV infection
rates in treatment centers for drug abusers and in clinics that treat
sexually transmitted diseases. On a national scale, those rates have
remained relatively stable during the past three years, said Janssen.
<p>
   But he added that these stable figures mask ``a very dynamic
situation'' at the local level, with the virus spreading at varying
rates in different regions of the country and among various population
groups.
<p>
   To get a more-detailed and up-to-date picture of the movement of
the virus, ``we're beginning to focus more on new infections'' rather
than simply measuring what proportion of drug users or clinic patients
test positive for HIV at any particular time, Janssen said. CDC
researchers are trying to develop blood tests that could be used in
people who test positive to help determine how recently they became
infected with the virus.
<p>
   Focusing on new infections makes sense for several reasons.
<p>
   For patients, research increasingly suggests that people who begin
treatment with antiviral drugs soon after becoming infected with HIV
have a better chance of checking the reproduction of the virus and
preserving the health of their immune systems.
<p>
   For public-health officials, tracking new infections provides a
more-accurate picture of which groups within a community are at
greatest risk of contracting HIV, so that prevention programs can be
targeted to those groups.
<p>
   Newly infected individuals who don't know they're carrying the
virus may fail to take precautions against transmitting it. Research
suggests they may be a powerful force fueling the epidemic.
<p>
   ``It's thought that very early in the infection, people have very
high viral titers,'' said James Curran, the former director of the
CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention who is now dean of the Rollins
School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. That means
they have large numbers of virus particles in their bloodstream and
body fluids, making them more likely to infect others.
<p>
   Tracking cases and studying patterns of transmission have been
vital to understanding AIDS. Early in the epidemic, even before the
human immunodeficiency virus was identified, epidemiological
surveillance suggested an infectious cause and identified all of the
major routes of transmission  &MD;  by contaminated blood products or
needles, by sexual intercourse, by a pregnant woman to her infant.
Epidemiological studies also provided evidence that AIDS wasn't
transmitted by casual contact or by mosquitoes.
<p>
   If something were to happen now to alter the current dynamics of
the disease  &MD;  for example, the emergence somewhere in the country of a
strain of HIV resistant to multiple drugs  &MD;  health officials would
probably notice the change sooner if they had a means of monitoring
new cases of infection, CDC officials say.
<p>
   ``We're interested in major shifts. I think surveillance (of
infection rates) gives you information about where the epidemic is and
where it may be heading,'' said Ward.
<p>
   Because of the mounting evidence that earlier treatment may offer
an advantage, AIDS activist organizations have begun urging people at
risk to be tested to find out whether they are infected.
<p>
   CDC officials are planning a national media campaign to encourage
more widespread HIV testing for people at risk, and have begun a study
to find out what kind of approach would be most effective.
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   AIDS organizations such as NAPWA acknowledge the need for a
national HIV reporting system, but would prefer one such as
Maryland's, which doesn't link results to names, in order to guard
against breaches of confidentiality, Baker said. He added that with
more widespread HIV testing, thousands more Americans will learn they
are infected with the virus but may not be able to afford the
expensive antiviral drugs that can help keep them healthy.
<p>
   ``It would be an extreme frustration if we institute this system
where we now know that we have this magnitude of HIV cases, and we
haven't figured out a way to help people,'' he said.
<p>
   Some have suggested that HIV infection should be made reportable
under federal law. Rep. Tom A. Coburn, R-Okla., a physician, has
introduced a bill that would require states to report cases of HIV
infection, would require notification of sexual partners of infected
individuals and would allow health-care workers to refuse to treat
anyone who refuses an HIV test. States would also have to report the
names of HIV-infected people to a federal government data base. The
bill's supporters include the American Medical Association.
<p>
   But AIDS groups and some other health organizations oppose the
legislation, pointing out that federal law does not require the
reporting of any other disease and that the measure would penalize
states that fail to comply with the law without providing any new
funds to help them carry out its requirements. States are already
required to perform partner notification as a condition of receiving
federal AIDS funds, said Julie Scofield of the National Alliance of
State and Territorial AIDS Directors.
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   One of the most complex aspects of tracking the epidemic is the
question of how to monitor for the emergence of drug-resistant strains
of HIV. Many AIDS experts fear such strains may evolve as a
consequence of broader use of new drugs to treat the infection, much
as antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria have spread within the
U.S. population.
<p>
   ``The concern about resistance is that certain communities may
begin having higher rates'' of infection  &MD;  for instance, drug addicts
being treated for HIV infection, who may take their medicines
inconsistently, Ward said.
<p>
   He said CDC researchers started a pilot project last year to
collect blood samples from patients to search for drug-resistant
strains. But the detailed viral analysis required for such monitoring
is expensive, and the task is complex because the environment is
constantly changing, as doctors continue to try new drugs and drug
combinations, and as scientists develop new tests for monitoring
strains of the virus.
<p>
   Federal funding for the CDC's AIDS surveillance activities was
about $58 million this year, according to Janssen. About $50 million
of the total went to states to support their surveillance programs.
Funding increased slightly this year but has otherwise been flat
during the 1990s.
<p>
   Curran recently headed a federal panel that he said will recommend
an intensified focus on tracking HIV infections in high-risk portions
of the population, including young male homosexuals, intravenous drug
users and sexually active teen-agers.
<p>
   ``How are we going to make HIV more preventable, and life safer for
our adolescent kids?'' he asked. ``Our kids are the first generation
to enter a world with AIDS, probably the first of all future
generations.''

 &UR; Who Should Be Tested for HIV? &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   For a number of reasons, health officials are urging more Americans
to find out their HIV status by being tested.
<p>
   Testing has gotten easier. One new test uses a swab placed in the
mouth, making a needle stick unnecessary. Some clinics can provide
results in as little as two days. There is even a test you can give
yourself at home, with the results provided over the telephone.
<p>
   People who discover they're infected can take new drug combinations
that slow the multiplication of the AIDS virus and reduce or postpone
damage to the immune system. Equally important, they can also take
special care to avoid transmitting the virus to others.
<p>
   ``We would say that all sexually active people, particularly
persons who are sexually active with multiple partners  &MD;  whether gay
or straight  &MD;  should definitely know'' whether they're infected with
the virus, said Ronald O. Valdiserri, deputy director of the National
Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention at the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. ``They should definitely have antibody
testing.''
<p>
   HIV testing is most strongly recommended for people whose behavior
places them in high-risk categories, Valdiserri added. That includes
anyone who has recently had a sexually transmitted disease, including
such infections as gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes or syphilis, and
anyone who has injected drugs using equipment that's been shared with
another person.
<p>
   Women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should definitely
consider having an HIV test, Valdiserri said. Giving an infected woman
drugs during pregnancy to treat HIV reduces the chance that the virus
will be passed to her infant.
<p>
   The risk of acquiring the virus through sex depends on what
practices a couple engages in and whether they take precautions. The
highest-risk behavior is anal intercourse without the protection of a
condom. Unprotected vaginal intercourse also poses a risk of infection
for both partners, as does oral sex, said Troy Knighton, director of
HIV counseling and testing at the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington,
D.C.
<p>
   Your chances of infection also depend on your sexual partner's past
history  &MD;  and his or her resultant likelihood of carrying the virus.
People who frequently have new partners  &MD;  a common pattern among some
teen-agers and young adults  &MD;  are at significant risk of HIV
infection, even if they sleep with just one boyfriend or girlfriend at
a time.
<p>
   Couples who've been monogamous for a long time have less reason to
worry. However, Valdiserri said, ``as a general rule of thumb,
sexually active people definitely need to know their serostatus
(whether they test positive for HIV infection) and need to know their
partner's.''
<p>
   Standard HIV tests look for antibodies against the virus. These are
chemicals that the immune system of an infected person manufactures
and releases into the bloodstream and other body fluids. The
antibodies can sometimes be detected as soon as two weeks after a
person becomes infected, but they may take up to six months to appear.
The widely used blood tests and the new oral test (which uses fluid
from cheek and gum cells, not saliva) work by measuring the same kind
of antibodies.
<p>
   Most AIDS experts emphasize that everyone should be counseled
before undergoing the test and again after obtaining the result. For
this reason, many discourage using the home test, since negative
results are often communicated only via a telephone recording.
<p>
   When choosing where to be tested, you may want to ask about cost,
whether the oral test as well as the blood test is available, whether
pre-test counseling is done individually or in a group, and how long
it will take to get the results. You can also inquire whether the
results are confidential (in which a record is kept of your name and
the result) or anonymous (in which results are coded by number only).

 &UR; 27 States Require Reporting of Positive HIV Tests &QL; 
 &UR; For Adults, Adolescents to Health Departments &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Twenty-seven states now require doctors and clinics to report the
results of positive HIV tests for adults and adolescents to health
departments, including the names of infected individuals. New Mexico
plans to institute such a requirement starting next year.
<p>
   Three states (Texas, Connecticut and Oregon) require the reporting
of positive results with names only for infected children. Maryland
(and Texas, for infected adults and adolescents) require reporting of
positive HIV tests but identify the results by number rather than
requiring that infected individuals be reported by name. The states
pass on their data on positive HIV tests to the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, but not the names of infected
individuals.
<p>
   Deciding which diseases should be legally reportable is each
state's prerogative, but CDC officials say they hope additional states
will pass laws making HIV infection a reportable condition.
<p>
   ``I think that it's likely that we will see declining numbers of
AIDS cases,'' said Rob Janssen, acting director of the CDC's Division
of HIV/AIDS Prevention-Surveillance and Epidemiology. ``As that
happens, states that don't have HIV reporting or HIV surveillance now
are likely to reconsider.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  We can plan for the future, predict it, guess it, but
the truth is that it's unknowable and often irrational  &MD;  as the world
learned again this weekend with the sudden death of Diana, princess of
Wales.
<p>
   Time and chance often trump rhyme and reason. That's why I'm amused
and often irritated at stock market prognostications. ``The bull
market isn't over yet,'' wrote the chief economist for NationsBank
last week. How does he know?
<p>
   Obviously, we can't live our lives under a belief that the world is
chaotic and senseless, and, indeed, most of the time the world isn't.
We have to plan  &MD;  in our work and in our personal lives  &MD;  and we can't
survive without faith that there is some order to the future.
<p>
   But especially in the public sphere, we also need to put
forecasting and planning in their proper place  &MD;  way down the list.
Not only can they be destructive of personal liberty, they don't work.
<p>
   In a fine article in ASAP, the Forbes high-tech magazine, Virginia
Postrel, editor of Reason, resurrects a wonderful dichotomy first
posed in 1988 by the late political scientist Aaron Wildavsky. He laid
out two alternatives for dealing with risk, with the uncertainties of
the world.
<p>
   One choice, writes Postrel, is ``anticipation , the static planning
that aspires to perfect foresight.'' The other is ``resilience , the
dynamic response that relies on having many margins of adjustment.''
One alternative tries to predict the future, so we can adapt to it in
advance; the other lets it happens and tries to take advantage of its
benefits and bounce back from its adversities.
<p>
   In her piece, Postrel argues that Silicon Valley's success is built
on the paradigm of resilience: ``People do the best they can at the
moment, deal with problems as they arise and develop networks to help
them out.'' They ship software without debugging it perfectly.
<p>
   Resilience is no guarantee that companies won't fail, she writes,
``but that resources  &MD;  including human resources  &MD;  are more likely to
move to better uses more quickly, with less trauma. Indeed, the
willingness to abandon a losing project is fundamental.''
<p>
   By contrast, New England, cradle of the Harvard Business School,
``has encouraged strategies of anticipation. People try to imagine
everything that might go wrong and fix it in advance.'' And New
England trails Silicon Valley badly.
<p>
   There's no doubt where Washington stands  &MD;  on the side of
anticipation and out of tune with a world in which time and chance are
moving at frenetic speed. Look at our five-year budgets, horrendously
complicated tax code, Medicare, the Advanced Technology Program,
regulation in general. And when was the last time government abandoned
a losing project (Amtrak, the Energy Department, the public school
monopoly)?
<p>
   Anticipation is not a style that works when the world changes
rapidly. ``It encourages,'' Postrel writes, ``two types of error:
hubristic central planning and overcaution.''
<p>
   Exactly. Those are the two great diseases of our public life: (1)
the belief, held by both Democrats and Republicans, that, given enough
data and power, government can make the future secure and blissful;
and (2) the fear of entrusting that future to the imagination of
individuals and to free competition among businesses.
<p>
   Wildavsky wrote that ``incessant search by many minds . . .
produces more (and more valuable) knowledge than the attempt to
program the paths to discovery by a single one. . . . Not only markets
rely on spontaneity; science and democracy do as well.''
<p>
   But to celebrate spontaneity is not to denigrate ideals.
<p>
   On the contrary, a world in which planning is revealed as futile is
a world in which principle is elevated to its proper place. Because
the numbers inevitably will turn out to be wrong, we should feel
comfortable holding resolutely to the ideals we think are right.
That's good advice for members of Congress returning this week.
<p>
   But in concrete terms, what is public policy that looks clear-eyed
at the truth about time and chance?
<p>
   It would favor an open, risk-spreading system, like Silicon
Valley's. Conscious of the limits of planning, it would devolve
decisions to lower levels of government, leaving law enforcement,
education and welfare (to name a few) to localities. It would abandon
attempts to plan, using absurd actuarial projections, for the
retirement of tens of millions and instead allow individuals to
provide for their own. It would limit the function of the tax code to
revenue-raising. It would stop trying to regulate the daily detail of
American lives.
<p>
   In short, a public policy that understands the nature of time and
chance would respect people enough to give them back their own futures
 &MD;  and let them develop the resilience to make those futures happy and
productive, no matter what's around the next corner.

<p>
   I hate moving  &MD;  the only smart thing I've done in my last six moves
was hire a moving company this spring, saving me from my own
incompetence at stuffing my belongings into U-Hauls.
<p>
   This is a subject where I can use any help I can get. Enter
MoveQuest (http://www.movequest.com), a spinoff of the MapQuest site
(http://www.mapquest.com). It combines MapQuest's geographical data,
sometimes klutzily, with services offered by other companies at other
Web sites.
<p>
   For instance, you get moving-expense estimates and cost-of-living
comparisons from the Homebuyer's Fair site
(http://www.homefair.com/home), insurance help from Allstate
(http://www.allstate.com) and financing information from Countrywide
Home Loans (http://www.countrywide.com).
<p>
   MoveQuest can also generate a calendar of to-do reminders, starting
2½ months before moving day. (Sample event: ``Arrange ISP service.'')
When I gave it a moving date of Oct. 1, it scolded me in user-manual
English: ``Your schedule is (sic) little behind. You better hurry
up!!''

 &UR; Fashions From Another Dimension &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Vogue's annual ``Fall Fashion Blockbuster'' issue is out and it is,
as always, a delight for fashion victims, people with too much money
and aficionados of the absurd. But you wouldn't want to be a mail
carrier on a route with a lot of Vogue subscribers: The magazine is a
fat, fragrant slab of slick paper  &MD;  with 734 thick, glossy pages, it
weighs more than many of the models pictured in it.
<p>
   The theme is ``The Thrill Is Back!,'' although nobody can remember
Vogue reporting that the alleged thrill of fashion had departed.
<p>
   But you've got to suspend that kind of disbelief if you want to
enjoy Vogue. You've got to get in the properly bubble-headed frame of
mind that permits you to accept the idea that, for example, women are
actually going to paint their eyebrows with thick slashes of red
lipstick that make them look like Groucho Marx in a movie colorized by
an acid-head.
<p>
   Several women in Vogue have adopted this look, including one
wearing a $2,500 black Gucci outfit on a page where the magazine
proclaims, quite candidly, that ``fashion is more wonderfully insane
than ever.''
<p>
   There's plenty of that wonderful insanity on view in Vogue. The
pictures are like postcards from some strange planet where almost
everyone is young and female and sort of morose-looking  &MD;  probably,
judging from their emaciation, because there's not much to eat there.
<p>
   On planet Vogue, a woman advertising a cloth pocketbook has strange
thorns growing out of her naked back. On planet Vogue, a model wearing
a red see-through dress and tattoos of George Washington and Jesus
Christ poses with a model wearing a ``jewel-of-the-Nile dress made
entirely out of safety pins.'' On planet Vogue, a woman in an elegant
black gown writhes sensuously against a picture of clouds while two
disheveled men lie slumped on the floor.
<p>
   In an ad for ``gai mattiolo''  &MD;  whatever that is  &MD;  a big-haired
blonde wearing too much makeup and nothing under her plaid sport
jacket stands in a doorway marked ``Governor Suite.'' It's the kind of
photo Kenneth Starr has been hoping to find all these years.
<p>
   The ads in Vogue are wonderfully silly but the stories are even
sillier. One of them, called ``Cult of the Expert,'' proclaims
``beauty is a religion that requires devotion, sacrifice and several
guiding lights.'' The guiding lights turn out to be Art Luna, ``hair
colorist to Hollywood''; Steven Miller,``facialist to famous faces'';
Rene Diaz, ``the best blow-dryer in Manhattan''; Janea Padilha, ``the
ultimate body waxer''; and Laurie Polis, ``down-to-earth dermatologist
to the below-Fourteenth Street beautiful people.'' Polis, described as
``Earth Mother-ish,'' attracts a fanatical following: ``Peel junkies
beg for a weekly fix to keep the glow going. Pimple-phobes pop in to
get tiny imperfections obliterated.''
<p>
   The magazine isn't afraid to cover the wars in Beirut, Belfast and
Bosnia  &MD;  from its own unique perspective. In ``Armed and Glamorous,''
Vogue explains how women living in these war zones ``find strength in
stilettos, designer dresses and midnight-blue nail polish.'' Under a
photo of a Lebanese woman having her eyebrows plucked the caption
reads: ``In Lebanon, chaos reigns but brows stay neatly arched.''
<p>
   You've got to love a magazine that runs a feature on inexpensive
clothes  &MD;  ``Paint the town red without spending too much green''  &MD; 
then illustrates it with photos of a $598 dress and $965 shoes. It's a
magazine that raises important questions, like: Isn't it time to raise
taxes on the rich?
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   Let's not forget the men's mags. They, too, have annual fall
fashion features, which are at least as absurd as Vogue's.
<p>
   Esquire has a six-page feature on ``The New Fall Suit,'' which
reveals that it is a lot like the old fall suit except that: 1) it's
light gray instead of charcoal gray and 2) the corduroy cords are
horizontal instead of vertical.
<p>
   GQ gets a little more creative in its 34-page fashion package, but
the results are even more ridiculous. The magazine invents a
fictitious Italian American family that includes two brothers, Stefano
and Giulio, who have just returned from ``the old country'' with lots
of expensive new Italian clothes. In one picture, they get into a
fistfight  &MD;  Stefano in his $1,870 leather sport jacket, Giulio in his
$530 turtleneck. In another shot, Stefano stands in his $1,970 Giorgio
Armani suit talking to his father and lamenting the fact that Dad is
wearing sandals with white socks. &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Are there any companies that arrange tours for families? Everything
we've looked at so far seems designed for adults. We're especially
interested in Europe for next year.
<p>
    &MD; Patrick K. Carroll, Gaithersburg Md.
<p>
   At least two Washington area travel firms are organizing
sightseeing tours in Europe for families next year. Roots &AMP; Wings
Excursions (1-800-722-9005 and 703-834-7244) of Herndon, Va., is
offering 10-day tours of Great Britain and Italy, and Grandtravel
(1-800-247-7651 and 301-986-0790) of Chevy Chase has put together
tours of Ireland, Great Britain, Holland/Belgium, London/Paris,
France, Italy, Austria and Spain. Roots &AMP; Wings hasn't yet set a price
on its tours; a 10-day Grandtravel tour in Europe is about $4,300 for
adults (not including air fare), although prices vary.
<p>
   On a family trip, the day-to-day pacing is slowed to give families
plenty of free time to explore on their own, says Carol Goldsmith,
president of Roots &AMP; Wings. And usually special dinners for children
only are arranged, so the adults can have an evening on their own.
Lodgings with ample space for a family also are a priority.
<p>
   How can I check on whether an ad or promotion for a discount tour
package is legitimate or some kind of scam?
<p>
    &MD; Sharon Richards, Annapolis, Md.
<p>
   If an unknown travel firm is offering you a bargain that seems too
good to be true, be wary. It could be a scam. You will want to check
out any unusual offer carefully before snapping it up. And don't be
taken in by any threat that the offer will disappear if you fail to
act immediately.
<p>
   To determine if a travel firm has been the target of consumer
complaints, contact 1) the Better Business Bureau in the community in
which the firm is headquartered, 2) your local city, county or state
consumer protection office and 3) the American Society of Travel
Agents (1101 King St., Suite 200, Alexandria, Va. 22314,
703-739-8739).
<p>
   Still unsure? Check out the components of the package. Do
guidebooks cite the hotel as a dump? Can you get a better air fare on
your own? Does the package give you flexibility to travel when you
want? Also, you can ask a travel agent to help you determine the
offer's validity. An agent may even be able to get you a better deal
to the same destination.
<p>
   I understand one can fly cheaply as a courier. What can you tell me
about courier travel?
<p>
    &MD; Virginia Berton, Alexandria, Va.
<p>
   Flying as a courier can be the cheapest route to Europe and,
sometimes, to the Far East and Australia. As a courier, your duties
are minimal. In exchange for a reduced-price, round-trip ticket issued
in your name, the courier firm uses your standard luggage allotment to
send packets of mail and other documents abroad for overnight
delivery. As checked baggage, the packets pass quickly through
immigration and customs; if shipped as cargo, they might be delayed
for hours or days. You are allowed only one piece of carry-on luggage,
and usually you are responsible for a receipt or manifest for the
checked items. You hand it over at the arrival airport to a
representative of the courier firm who meets the plane. Most trips are
for seven to 10 days.
<p>
   In business for 14 years, Now Voyager (212-431-1616) in Manhattan
serves as a clearinghouse for courier flights. For a $50 annual fee,
you are offered a choice of flights year-round; not surprisingly,
winter is the easiest time to book. Flights can be booked up to two
months in advance. This summer, the firm has been offering round-trip
flights out of New York City and Newark to London for $359; Brussels,
Copenhagen and Dublin, $399; Paris, Madrid, Milan and Rome, $499.
Flights to the Far East depart from Detroit; to Australia, from Los
Angeles. You pay the cost of getting to the departure airport. Call
Now Voyager for a detailed recording of the firm's courier policies.
<p>
   My husband and I want to go to Sydney for the Summer Olympics in
2000. What can you tell us about tickets, air fares to Australia and
lodging?
<p>
    &MD; Stefanie Hutchins, Hyattsville, Md.
<p>
   The Sydney 2000 Olympics, scheduled for Sept. 15 to Oct. 1, are
still three years away, so you are a little premature in your
planning.
<p>
   Event tickets will not go on sale until 1999. At that time, about
5.5 million tickets will become available, with 80 percent of them
reserved for purchase in Australia and the rest apportioned to other
participating countries. Cartan Tours (1-800-818-1998) of Manhattan
Beach, Calif., has been designated by the U.S. Olympic Committee as
the U.S. ticket distributor. Cartan, which also will offer Sydney
lodging packages, is compiling a list of people wanting ticket and
tour order forms.
<p>
   Sydney expects about 250,000 spectators during the Games and is
taking steps to assure sufficient accommodations for everyone. Already
in the works is a Homestay/Homehost Program, which will provide rental
lodgings in private homes  &MD;  either with or without a resident host.
This year, rates at the Sydney Hilton begin at about $165 a night for
a room for two, and budget hotels go for $35 to $50 a night.
Meanwhile, Qantas and United, airlines serving Sydney, say their
computers accept reservations only up to a year in advance  &MD;  so it's
too early to book flights. Qantas is quoting a round-trip fare from
Washington via Los Angeles of $1,594 per person, with restrictions.
<p>
   To stay abreast of Olympic Games developments, keep an eye on the
Web site set up by the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games (www.sydney.olympic.org) or call the Australian Tourist
Commission's USA Aussie Help Line (847-296-4900). For a packet of
sightseeing information, call the commission's toll-free number
(1-800-333-0262).

 &UR; Senate's Lonely Laptop Lobby (Washn) &QL; 
 &UR; Gugliotta is a national reporter for The Washington Post. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Shortly after he was sworn in, freshman Sen. Mike
Enzi, R-Wyo., asked the Senate parliamentarian whether he could bring
his laptop computer onto the Senate floor. Ask the sergeant at arms,
the parliamentarian said.
<p>
   It turned out that Senate Rule IV authorizes ``mechanical devices''
in the chamber when the sergeant at arms deems them ``necessary and
proper'' to conduct official Senate business, and as long as they ``do
not in any way distract, interrupt or inconvenience'' others.
<p>
   Anyway, Sergeant at Arms Gregory S. Casey explained to Enzi that he
couldn't deem anything without guidance from the Senate, so the answer
was ``no.' In May, Enzi, a gentle-spoken former shoe store owner and
the Senate's only professional accountant, asked the Rules Committee
for permission.
<p>
   Rules asked Casey to write a report, and Casey presented it to the
committee on July 31, 1997, which might live in history as the date
the U.S. Senate saw the future and gave it a raspberry.
<p>
   The committee's ranking minority member, Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky.,
72, didn't want to be ``an old fogy,'' and said he was hip enough to
notice some of the younger senators treated laptops like legal pads.
<p>
   But if Ford was trying to encourage shy younger colleagues, he
needn't have bothered. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Tex., 54 and a
senator since 1993, had already weighed in, and she didn't like it. At
all.
<p>
   ``There's something to be said for tradition,'' she said. If
senators want to carry laptops around, put them in the cloakroom.
Laptops in the chamber would be distracting and ugly.
<p>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 64 and a senator since 1992, was
less charitable. ``It seems to me when we go to the floor, we're
supposed to know what we're saying.'' And she didn't fancy giving a
speech in front of a bunch of senators with their heads bent over.
<p>
   Next was Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., 46 and also a freshman.
He would like to see the Senate ``remain different,'' he said. Laptops
would take the freewheeling fun out of the debate, and everything
would be ``scripted.''
<p>
   Rules Committee Chairman John W. Warner, R-Va., 70 and a cagey
four-term veteran, ordered copies of the Casey report to be given to
all senators, after which the committee would meet again. Stay tuned.
<p>
   Enzi, who is 53 and so green he spent part of the August recess
unabashedly enjoying Monticello and other regional tourist
attractions, studied computers in college and has used them most of
his adult life. He has found it ``kind of a strain'' to work without
one.
<p>
   He was lucky last winter when he had to lead the debate on
accounting matters related to the balanced budget amendment, he said,
because ``there weren't any rocket science questions.'' Math in the
Senate, as he will soon discover, is whatever gets you to your
favorite number.
<p>
   Enzi said he had no plans to hook his computer (Compaq, 32
megabytes internal memory, 1.2 gigabytes hard drive) into a network,
and simply wanted to take notes, prepare speeches and keep track of
legislation  &MD;  ``to do the best job for my constituents.''
<p>
   Casey's report did not take a position, but essentially it agreed
with Enzi. As long as networking was not allowed, there ``would be no
need to wire the Senate floor,'' drill holes into 200-year-old desks
or worry about security.
<p>
   ``Large screens, obnoxious beeps or buzzers'' would be prohibited,
the report continued, so there would be no modems or ``Duke Nuke'M.''
And as far as ``necessary and proper,'' the report said, the device
must be ``used to further the legislative and constitutional function
of the Senate as a whole.''
<p>
   Which is what Enzi is trying to do.
<p>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., 79, who has spent 38 years in the
Senate, who has compiled a three-volume history of the Senate, and who
lectures newcomers of both parties on everything they need to know
about ``necessary and proper'' in the Senate, was not impressed.
<p>
   ``I will read your report eagerly,'' he told Casey. ``Then I will
cast my vote against it.''

   So, which state has the most tornadoes? If you guessed Texas,
you're in good company: Fully half the respondents to last week's
impromptu trivia quiz voted for the Lone Star state, and rightly so.
Dorothy might have been uprooted in Kansas, but Texas has far more
twisters. From 1962 through 1991, 4,174 tornadoes touched down there.
The runner-up was  &MD;  surprise  &MD;  not Oklahoma or Kansas, as most of the
rest of our respondents guessed, but Florida, with a mere 1,590.
Oklahoma came in third, and Kansas a lowly fourth.

   Serious Picasso aficionados may be interested to know that the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts' presentation of ``Picasso: The Early
Years''  &MD;  which ran at the National Gallery of Art from March 30 until
July 27  &MD;  will feature 32 pictures not seen in the Washington version
of the show. Among the works, all from the painter's experimental
period: ``Blue Roofs,'' depicting the view from Picasso's studio in
Paris; ``Seated Woman and Child,'' a Blue Period image of maternity;

   ``Some private collectors didn't want to lend to two venues,'' says
George Shackelford, the MFA's head of European painting, by way of
explaining the modified catalogue in Boston. ``And some pieces that
were available in Washington were prohibited from traveling.''
<p>
   With autumn air fares to Boston hovering near $100 one-way (not to
mention Southwest Airlines' $39 one-way fare from BWI to Providence,
R.I., less than an hour from Boston), the timing may be right for
those who can't quite get enough of the master's youth  &MD;  or who simply
missed the show in Washington.
<p>
   The Boston appearance of ``Picasso: The Early Years'' runs from
Sept. 10 to Jan. 4 at the Museum of Fine Arts, 465 Huntington Ave.
Admission is by ticket only. Tickets are available at the box office
or through Ticketmaster, 617-931-2632; the reserved-ticket price for
non-members is $15. For more information, call 617-PICASSO
(617-742-2776). Or check out the museum's Web site at

   ``When traveling in India, one generally will visit Islamic
mosques, Hindu temples, the Taj Mahal and Buddhist shrines,'' writes
tipster Papan Devnani of Arlington. ``At all these locations one must
leave shoes outside. Reeboks, Nikes and their ilk get stolen if left
unattended. Of course, there are attendants who will watch your shoes
for a fee. But this adds to the cost. So I carry a small handbag or
shoulder bag and put my shoes inside and walk into the place. It is an
acceptable practice and is not considered offensive.''

   Your tan is fading, you're wearing shoes and socks again and most
folks are planning to spend their autumn free time observing foliage
decay and harvesting fruit grown by others. But you needn't capitulate
to the season, at least not yet. You can head to North Florida, where
summer weather lingers an extra month or two  &MD;  and great seasonal
deals make it all the easier.
<p>
   Beginning this month, the state's beaches are emptying and the Gulf
of Mexico is bathwater-warm. For travelers who want to get away for a
couple of days but not part with a lot of cash, here are two spots
worth considering.
<p>
   AMELIA ISLAND: Tucked off Florida's northeastern-most Atlantic
coast, Amelia Island has 13 miles of beaches, top-notch sports
facilities, a historic district comprising 50 blocks and, should you
care about tenure in such matters, the state's oldest saloon. The
island's most interesting claim to fame is that it's the only spot in
the United States to have flown under eight different flags.
<p>
   The deal: As part of its Secret Season promotion, beginning
tomorrow, many hotels are offering visitors the third night free when
they pay for the first two. The catch: Most offer the savings only
during midweek. Information: 1-800-226-542,
<p>
   Amelia Island is about 35 minutes from downtown Jacksonville, 25
minutes from the airport.
<p>
   DESTIN-FORT WALTON AREA: Located on the state's panhandle, Destin
and environs offer plenty: 24 miles of beach, 545 holes of golf,
fishing in the ``World's Luckiest Fishing Village'' (a k a Destin) and
10 amusement areas offer everything from bumper boats to batting
cages.
<p>
   The deal: Indian Summer '97 promises discounts of up to 40 percent
on many of the 11,000 beachfront rooms on the Emerald Coast, which
includes Okaloosa Island. During the peak summer season, condo rentals
average $1,190 a week, hotels $97 per night. In the fall, rates bottom
out at $735 for condos, $57 for hotels. Information: 1-800-322-3319.
<p>
   The Destin-Fort Walton area is served by Okaloosa County Regional
Airport in Fort Walton, about 15 minutes from Destin.
<p>
   GETTING THERE: US Airways is quoting a round-trip fare of about
$170 to Jacksonville, with restrictions, from the three area airports.
Its fare to Fort Walton is about $200 from National and Dulles, though
the price drops to $162 if you fly from Dulles to Pensacola, about 45
minutes away. Car rentals vary widely; Hertz is quoting a rate of $30
per day, plus tax and airport fees.
<p>
    &UR; -0- &QC; 
<p>
   Novotel New York is offering a new 10-page ``Discount Shopping
Guide,'' authored by a pair of credentialed NYC bargain-hunters, to
guests of its renovated Times Square property. A swell idea  &MD;  until
you learn that the lowest-priced accommodations in the 474-room hotel
start at $249 per night, not quite in the range of the crowd shopping
at Loehmann's, Daffy's and Syms.

 &UR; Senate's Lonely Laptop Lobby (Washn) &QL; 
 &UR; Gugliotta is a national reporter for The Washington Post. &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Shortly after he was sworn in, freshman Sen. Mike
Enzi, R-Wyo., asked the Senate parliamentarian whether he could bring
his laptop computer onto the Senate floor. Ask the sergeant at arms,
the parliamentarian said.
<p>
   It turned out that Senate Rule IV authorizes ``mechanical devices''
in the chamber when the sergeant at arms deems them ``necessary and
proper'' to conduct official Senate business, and as long as they ``do
not in any way distract, interrupt or inconvenience'' others.
<p>
   Anyway, Sergeant at Arms Gregory S. Casey explained to Enzi that he
couldn't deem anything without guidance from the Senate, so the answer
was ``no.' In May, Enzi, a gentle-spoken former shoe store owner and
the Senate's only professional accountant, asked the Rules Committee
for permission.
<p>
   Rules asked Casey to write a report, and Casey presented it to the
committee on July 31, 1997, which might live in history as the date
the U.S. Senate saw the future and gave it a raspberry.
<p>
   The committee's ranking minority member, Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky.,
72, didn't want to be ``an old fogy,'' and said he was hip enough to
notice some of the younger senators treated laptops like legal pads.
<p>
   But if Ford was trying to encourage shy younger colleagues, he
needn't have bothered. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Tex., 54 and a
senator since 1993, had already weighed in, and she didn't like it. At
all.
<p>
   ``There's something to be said for tradition,'' she said. If
senators want to carry laptops around, put them in the cloakroom.
Laptops in the chamber would be distracting and ugly.
<p>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 64 and a senator since 1992, was
less charitable. ``It seems to me when we go to the floor, we're
supposed to know what we're saying.'' And she didn't fancy giving a
speech in front of a bunch of senators with their heads bent over.
<p>
   Next was Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., 46 and also a freshman.
He would like to see the Senate ``remain different,'' he said. Laptops
would take the freewheeling fun out of the debate, and everything
would be ``scripted.''
<p>
   Rules Committee Chairman John W. Warner, R-Va., 70 and a cagey
four-term veteran, ordered copies of the Casey report to be given to
all senators, after which the committee would meet again. Stay tuned.
<p>
   Enzi, who is 53 and so green he spent part of the August recess
unabashedly enjoying Monticello and other regional tourist
attractions, studied computers in college and has used them most of
his adult life. He has found it ``kind of a strain'' to work without
one.
<p>
   He was lucky last winter when he had to lead the debate on
accounting matters related to the balanced budget amendment, he said,
because ``there weren't any rocket science questions.'' Math in the
Senate, as he will soon discover, is whatever gets you to your
favorite number.
<p>
   Enzi said he had no plans to hook his computer (Compaq, 32
megabytes internal memory, 1.2 gigabytes hard drive) into a network,
and simply wanted to take notes, prepare speeches and keep track of
legislation  &MD;  ``to do the best job for my constituents.''
<p>
   Casey's report did not take a position, but essentially it agreed
with Enzi. As long as networking was not allowed, there ``would be no
need to wire the Senate floor,'' drill holes into 200-year-old desks
or worry about security.
<p>
   ``Large screens, obnoxious beeps or buzzers'' would be prohibited,
the report continued, so there would be no modems or ``Duke Nuke'M.''
And as far as ``necessary and proper,'' the report said, the device
must be ``used to further the legislative and constitutional function
of the Senate as a whole.''
<p>
   Which is what Enzi is trying to do.
<p>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., 79, who has spent 38 years in the
Senate, who has compiled a three-volume history of the Senate, and who
lectures newcomers of both parties on everything they need to know
about ``necessary and proper'' in the Senate, was not impressed.
<p>
   ``I will read your report eagerly,'' he told Casey. ``Then I will
cast my vote against it.''

 &UR; High-Profile Crimes Spark Criticism of Japan's Police &QL; 
 &UR; (Tokyo) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO  &MD;  Murder suspect Kazuko Fukuda spent 15 years on the run,
toying with Japanese police. She had so many plastic surgeries that
police called her ``The Woman With Seven Faces.'' She spent lavishly,
gambled conspicuously and drank heavily  &MD;  once sharing a drink with a
policeman who told her she resembled the famous fugitive Kazuko
Fukuda. Pounding her fist on the table, she dared the officer to take
her fingerprints. He didn't.
<p>
   Fukuda's luck finally ran out in July, when police arrested her in
a barroom in western Japan. She was arraigned 11 hours before the
15-year statute of limitations expired on the 1982 murder of which she
is suspected.
<p>
   Fukuda's case, along with other recent high-profile crimes, has
raised disturbing questions for many Japanese.
<p>
   Many people are frustrated about what they see as outdated laws
that are too forgiving of criminals, such as the 15-year statute of
limitations on murder and laws that allow murderers under 16 to be set
free after three years in juvenile detention. Those juvenile laws,
written in 1948, caused an uproar this year when a 14-year-old boy was
arrested on charges of beheading an 11-year-old boy and leaving the
severed head at the gate of a school.
<p>
   Certainly, Japan remains one of the world's safest societies, with
enviously low rates of violent crime. The United States has twice as
many people as Japan but 18 times as many murders.
<p>
   But there has been a recent increase in violent crimes, especially
those involving guns and young people. Japan's police, many believe,
are not equipped to respond.
<p>
   Japanese are proud of their neighborhood  &UR; kobans &LR; , or police boxes,
from which unarmed police officers patrol assigned areas on bicycles.
But now people are saying sophisticated criminals  &MD;  and suspects such
as Fukuda, who hopscotched around the country and easily changed
identities  &MD;  show the need for a better trained and equipped national
police force.
<p>
   ``The police system is outdated and doesn't fit current
realities,'' said Kenjiro Mishima, a former National Police Agency
official who is now a security consultant.
<p>
   Japan has no equivalent of the FBI. The National Police Agency is
largely a bureaucratic organization that collects statistics and
information on organized crime and violent right-wing groups. With the
exception of the Imperial Police, a branch of the agency that protects
the royal family, the National Police Agency has virtually no direct
power of investigation and arrest.
<p>
   ``The NPA is not an investigative force,'' Mishima said. ``The
country needs something like the FBI, a nerve center to collect
intelligence, analyze it. Japan needs a national force to deal with
serious crime.''
<p>
   When a terrorist group killed a dozen people and injured 6,000 more
in a poison-gas attack on the Tokyo subway system two years ago, the
Tokyo metropolitan police led the investigation. Several of the key
suspects are still at large.
<p>
   Critics say Japan's organized crime families, and, increasingly,
Chinese crime syndicates that smuggle illegal immigrants into the
country, are better armed and better organized than the authorities
responsible for dealing with them. The chief of the National Police
Agency was shot three times in broad daylight on a Tokyo street two
years ago. The crime remains unsolved.
<p>
   Japan recently marked the second anniversary of a triple murder in
a suburban Tokyo grocery store. Three store employees, two of them
high school students, were gunned down in the robbery. Police have
made no arrests in the crime.
<p>
   Some TV commentators note that crime was worse in the aftermath of
World War II than now, and the current rash of random violence might
pass, too. But in the meantime, robbers are thriving in a place where
the idea of a jewelry store having an electronic door buzzer, or of
clerks checking signatures on credit cards, is alien.
<p>
   All year, armed robberies have been front-page news in a country
where ordinary people routinely carry hundreds or thousands of dollars
in cash. Thirteen times this year, thieves have robbed armored trucks
carrying vast sums of cash  &MD;  one with $2 million. The trucks were
protected by guards who carried neither guns nor radios.
<p>
   ``Most companies are not ready for robbers with guns because they
think that kind of crime is out of the question,'' Mishima said.
``Maybe mom-and-pop shops don't have to worry about armed robbers, but
banks should.''
<p>
   Police had searched for 15 years for Fukuda, who was suspected of
strangling a 31-year-old colleague to steal her cash, furniture and
clothing. When traditional police work turned up nothing, they turned
to a practice common in other countries but unheard of here: They
offered a reward. So did a Tokyo hospital where Fukuda had undergone
plastic surgery. The president of Jujin hospital, Fumihiko Umezawa,
said in an interview that he was upset he had unwittingly helped a
fugitive and he offered a $34,000 reward on top of the $8,500 offered
by police.
<p>
   ``Anyone who did a bad thing should have to pay for it,'' Umezawa
said, showing pictures of Fukuda before and after her surgery. ``I
don't like that after a certain period of time you can get away with
it.''
<p>
   The police, too, were unhappy about the statute of limitations. For
detectives working on the case, ``15 years flies by like an arrow,''
said Kimiaki Hiraoka, spokesman for the police in Ehime Prefecture in
southern Japan, where the crime was committed.
<p>
   Of 5,000 tips police received about Fukuda over the past 15 years,
4,000 came this year  &MD;  after the reward offer. Two people who led
police to Fukuda already have come forward to claim their money. &QL;

 &UR; A Serious GOP Player, Largent Isn't Always on Team &QL; 
 &UR; (Broken Arrow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BROKEN ARROW, Okla.  &MD;  Steve Largent's constituents in this small
suburb of Tulsa are spitting bullets. But not about the fierce battle
for the soul of the Republican Party that consumed Largent in July.
This sticky August morning, the subject is mailboxes.
<p>
   The U.S. Postal Service has installed curbside boxes at the homes
of some senior citizens and they're demanding their porch service
back. The community library is packed and virtually everyone is
venting at the former football star-turned-Republican congressman.
Newt Gingrich is never mentioned.
<p>
   ``Now congressman, we hired you to solve our problems,'' pleads
Virginia Johnson. ``And we have a big problem. . . . We expect
something from you.''
<p>
   ``Well, that's a lot of pressure,'' Largent responds with a wide
smile, breaking the tension. ``I'm not going to promise results, but I
will promise 100 percent effort. Just let me get up to speed on this
and I will get answers for you.''
<p>
   Mastering the game has always been one part instinct, three parts
tireless effort for Steve Largent. A former wide receiver for the
Seattle Seahawks, he was considered too slight and too slow to succeed
in the National Football League. Friends from his football days recall
Largent spending hours studying the opposition's playbooks. He became
one of the game's greatest receiverse, a Hall of Famer who held six
NFL records when he retired from football in 1989.
<p>
   He has been just as full of surprises in his fledgling political
career.
<p>
   When he arrived in the House as a political novice in 1994, he was
privately touted by Gingrich as the future of the Republican Party, a
superstar with name recognition who could generate support for the
party agenda. He was given a coveted seat on the Budget Committee. To
Democrats, Largent was merely a celebrity right-wing beneficiary of
the 1994 GOP landslide.
<p>
   He has proven both sides wrong. In his first term, Largent was one
of handful of Republicans who embarrassed Gingrich, R-Ga., by voting
against the speaker on budget matters. This summer, he played a
leading role in the botched attempt to overthrow Gingrich. And as
Congress returns to Washington this week, Largent shows no signs of
letting up.
<p>
   ``This was not about policy issues  &MD;  it was about integrity and
leadership,'' he said the other day as he cruised from breakfast
meeting to factory tour in his district. ``We've been portrayed as the
radical right who believed we were not getting what we wanted, and
that was never the case. This is about being told that certain things
were so and they weren't.''
<p>
   Largent said when the dust settled and Gingrich survived, he asked
the speaker what he thought of him. ``He said he didn't think I was a
team player. Which I thought was a curious statement for him to make
about me. I just didn't want to play on the team he had built.''
<p>
   Largent is viewed as a serious player within the Republican Party,
someone whose fierce independence and earnest articulation of
conservative values have made him a threat to the leadership of his
party, and caused the Democrats to take notice. Largent, who turns 43
this month, also happens to be strikingly telegenic. (He was a
featured page on a gag ``Hunks of the House Calendar'' members
presented to Republican Rep. Susan Molinari of New York upon her
resignation.)
<p>
   Republicans say he has significant marquee value on the
fund-raising circuit, and willingly criss-crossed the country last
year for colleagues in more than 50 districts. It seems reasonable to
assume he could do that for himself one day.
<p>
   Many Democrats believe Largent's hard right ideology on social
issues  &MD;  he's antiabortion, anti-entitlements, and believes
homosexuality is a ``choice''  &MD;  will preclude him from generating
broad-based national support. But many also regard him as
hard-working, prepared and fair-minded. ``I don't believe we agree on
any of those (social) issues, but the ability to forge alliances
matters and he understands that,'' said Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif.
``He's much more than an aging jock.''
<p>
   So, where is Largent heading? The lawmaker wouldn't take the bait
one recent rainy morning in Tulsa.
<p>
   ``I tell people that I think I'm the freest member of Congress
because I'm not wedded to this job,'' he said. ``There's no hidden
agenda. . . . I feel that I can vote my conscience and let the chips
fall where they may.''
<p>
   During a half-dozen recent constituent events, all filled to
capacity, Largent received one question on Gingrich, but dozens on
Social Security (he favors privatization of the system) and taxes
(he's against them.) At virtually every event, at least one person
stood up and profusely thanked him for representing the district,
which encompasses most of Tulsa, a corporate city in the heart of the
Southwest's Bible belt, and home to Oral Roberts's ministry.
<p>
   ``The seat is his as long as he wants it,'' said one prominent
local Democrat.
<p>
   A Christian conservative, Largent was initially elected to fill the
House seat vacated by Republican Sen. James M. Inhofe. ``I didn't even
know what GOP stood for until after I was elected,'' he said. He
obviously got the hang of it: He received 68 percent of the vote in
1996 against token Democratic opposition.
<p>
   Largent was raised poor in a middle-class suburb of Oklahoma City.
His father abandoned the family when Largent was a boy, and his mother
remarried an abusive alcoholic.
<p>
   Largent said he embraced Christianity as a teenager to survive.
``You know my dad taking off created a vacuum, an insecurity,'' he
explained. ``That void was filled through the development of my walk
with Christ.''
<p>
   Largent's mother, Sue, tried to attend all his high school football
and baseball games, while juggling menial jobs to make ends meet for
her four children. In high school, he met his future wife, Terry,
whose family offered Largent a stable home life. They married 22 years
ago while Largent was attending the University of Tulsa on a football
scholarship; they have four children, 11 to 18, one of whom was born
with spina bifida.
<p>
   What makes Largent a potentially formidable opponent, say Democrats
and Republicans alike, is his ability to advance the right's social
policies without sounding strident. ``He conveys credibility and
conviction . . . and he's a workhorse,'' said Rep. Bill Paxon, N.Y., a
casualty of the recent GOP House wars. ``He is not lusting after
position. He leads because of what he believes.''
<p>
   When a group of 11 angry Republicans derailed a spending bill
earlier this year, Gingrich yanked all Republicans into a closed-door
meeting. He then demanded that the 11 explain themselves. Largent
jumped up first. ``You can't intimidate me,'' he told Gingrich. ``I've
had linebackers who wanted to kill me.''
<p>
   But allies and opponents alike agree that these uncompromising
principles could also be his undoing.
<p>
   Largent says he understands the process requires him to accept less
than he wants as long as ``you keep trying to move the ball up the
court.''
<p>
   ``But this idea that you better not be too vocal about the abortion
issue, or you don't want to talk about entitlement reform, and you
sure don't want to talk about Social Security reform  &MD;  I don't buy
that because it's wrong,'' he said. ``And the pro-life issue is the
issue of my heart. It's who I am.''
<p>
   Largent has said publicly that he won't stay in the House longer
than 12 years. He has not moved his family to Washington, and instead
shares a house with Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., and Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla.
<p>
   He insists he has given little thought to running for a leadership
post or higher office, but adds: ``I don't rule anything out. . . .
I'm confident that I'm where God wants me to be right now. But I don't
know about tomorrow or next year.'' &QL;

 &UR; Solar Probe Offers New, Closer Look at Everything Under the Sun &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   You might think that the weather forecast for the surface of the
sun would be a pretty dreary affair.  &UR; Hot and dry. High 10,000
Fahrenheit.
 &UR; Outlook: continued sunny with intermittent spots and flares for the
next 4
 &UR; billion years.
<p>
   But recently scientists have learned that our local star is beset
by its own kind of incendiary tempests, seasonal squalls and rogue
currents of fire. And now new instruments that can peer beneath the
outer luminous layers have revealed an utterly unexpected
meteorological feature in the form of titanic ``jet streams'' of
electrically charged gases that circle the poles, churning the
atmosphere where it was thought to be most calm.
<p>
   They also detected several mysterious ``trade wind'' bands of
high-speed plasma 40,000 miles wide that ring the solar perimeter like
the belts on Jupiter, as well as a global pattern of upper-level
current flow north and south from the equator. Many of these effects,
said Jesper Schou of Stanford University, exhibit ``motion similar to
weather patterns in the Earth's atmosphere.''
<p>
   The findings, reported last week by Schou, Craig DeForest and other
Stanford researchers using the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
spacecraft, are ``absolutely fascinating,'' said Juri Toomre, a
University of Colorado astrophysicist not involved in the
announcement. They ``herald a new era of solar meteorology,'' said
Douglas Gough of Cambridge University in England.
<p>
   Researchers are hoping that the SOHO data will help explain such
persistent enigmas as the origin and life cycle of sunspots, which
influence the torrents of solar emissions that blast toward Earth,
deranging radio communications.
<p>
   ``One of our ultimate goals,'' said John W. Harvey of the
ground-based National Solar Observatory in Tucson, ``is to learn
enough about the sun to predict activity'' accurately enough to warn
Earthlings days in advance that a solar storm is on the way. ``Any
sort of insight,'' DeForest said, ``could give us more lead time.''
<p>
   But in the short term, most solar scientists will settle for
anything that makes clearer the nature of our familiar, but
often-inscrutable, star.
<p>
   The sun, 98 percent of which is hydrogen and helium, is a perfectly
ordinary middle-aged representative of the 100 billion stars in our
galaxy. It can thus serve as ``a Rosetta stone'' for understanding
others large and small, said George Withbroe of NASA's solar-research
program.
<p>
   But first scientists need to understand its baffling quirks.
<p>
   For one, it swells and contracts at five-minute intervals, driven
by sound waves that bounce around its innards. For another, it rotates
at different speeds at different latitudes: At the equator, one
revolution takes about 25 days; at the poles, about 33. The difference
in speed between adjacent regions causes a sliding or shear force on
the intervening gas. (Imagine two boats cruising side by side. If one
is going 10 mph and the other 15, the water between them will be
jerked into turbulence.)
<p>
   Within that global pattern, the Stanford team observed half a dozen
horizontal bands in both hemispheres of the sun that are traveling
faster than adjoining areas. Solar surface activity is suspiciously
high alongside them.
<p>
   That makes sense: At the edges of those belts, where they rub
against slower-moving gas, there should be considerable shear stress.
That presumably causes kinks to form in the plasma-gas that has been
heated so much by fusion at the solar core that electrons have
detached themselves from their atoms, creating a seething incandescent
soup of negative electrons and positive nuclei.
<p>
   The plasma rises and falls in the same patterns you see in a pot of
boiling water. Hotter, less-dense material rises until it reaches the
surface, then cools and descends. This occurs in the outermost 30
percent of the sun, which is called the convection zone. Its top
surface, the photosphere, generates the sunlight we see daily.
<p>
   Because both the electrons and nuclei are electrically charged, any
motion in the plasma will produce a magnetic field, just as a moving
electric current in a wire does. When magnetic fields are induced by
the rope-like kinks, they sometimes form weird loops that protrude all
the way up through the outer surface. The magnetic field retards the
upward convective flow of hot plasma, and so the photosphere looks
darker where the fields poke through. These dark regions  &MD;  typically
twice the Earth's diameter  &MD;  are sunspots.
<p>
   Sunspots follow a strange but highly predictable pattern. Every 11
years, new batches start to form at high solar latitudes in both the
northern and southern hemispheres, and gradually move toward the
equator. Each spot in a cycle has the opposite magnetic orientation of
the spots in the previous cycle, probably because the sun itself
reverses its magnetic poles every 11 years: North becomes south and
vice versa.
<p>
   To better understand those and other solar idiosyncrasies, NASA and
the European Space Agency launched SOHO in December 1995. The two-ton,
12-by-12-foot spacecraft, positioned 930,000 miles sunward from Earth,
carries many instruments, some of which detect regional speed
differences in sound-wave pulses that propagate through the solar
gases. Such regions reveal their locations and relative velocities via
the Doppler effect: Waves moving toward an observer appear closer
together (that is, seem to have higher frequency and shorter
wavelength); those moving away appear just the opposite.
<p>
   That's how the Stanford group found the polar jet stream (invisible
on the surface) and the fast-track horizontal bands. The bands'
existence had been postulated in the 1980s, but the new data show they
extend at least 12,000 miles deep.
<p>
   Scientists also had long suspected that there was a general flow in
both hemispheres from the equator to the poles. SOHO confirmed that
the upper layer of the solar surface (down to a depth of at least
15,000 miles) drifts poleward at 50 mph. At that speed, it takes about
a year to make the trip. Apparently when it reaches the higher
latitudes, it descends and ``we assume that the flows will return at
some depth,'' Schou said, ``though we haven't observed that yet.''
<p>
   That means surface currents are heading toward the poles at the
same time that sunspot clusters are moving toward the equator.
According to present theory, those seemingly contradictory events are
possible because the big magnetic kinks that cause sunspots are
thought to originate at the bottommost boundary of the convection
layer, where currents are probably flowing toward the equator.
<p>
   ``Do we really understand'' all the patterns, Gough said at a NASA
briefing last week. ``The answer is no. But we will. That is the faith
of the scientist.''

 &UR; Clintons' Social Life Ripens (Martha's Vineyard) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass.  &MD;  The nightclub was hopping. The musicians
were playing a Patsy Cline number. And just off stage, just behind the
curtain, President Clinton stood and swayed gently, one arm draped
affectionately around singer Carly Simon and the other around her
daughter, Sally Taylor.
<p>
   It was just another night on the Vineyard vacation trail for
Clinton, another night soaking up the company of the famous, the
fetching and the fabulously wealthy. As the president schmoozed with
Simon, milling around in the crowd were television mogul Barry Diller,
author-humorist Fran Lebowitz and Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey
Weinstein.
<p>
   By the fifth year of his presidency, this has become something of a
familiar scene, the hobnobbing commander in chief clearly entranced
with the glitz and glamour of a social strata that must have seemed
beyond him during his coming-of-age days in Arkansas. But after two
years of trying to keep such images under wraps for fear of a
political backlash, Clinton has enjoyed something of a postelection
coming-out this summer, openly and unabashedly spending virtually
every evening partying with the likes of Ted Danson, Sylvester
Stallone and Norman Lear, then playing golf with tycoons, investment
bankers and executives from corporations such as General Electric and
Sony.
<p>
   Many of them are people he has known a relatively short time, such
as Richard Friedman, the Boston developer whose island home Clinton
first borrowed three years ago, and again this year. Called ``the
usual cast'' by a White House aide, many in the group travel in
different circles and don't socialize with each other apart from the
Clintons. Few of the Friends of Bill  &MD;  friends who go back as far as
college or Arkansas politics and with whom he networked throughout his
career  &MD;  are in evidence.
<p>
   To some extent, every president socializes with the rich and
famous. But few of Clinton's recent predecessors have made it such a
dominant element of their vacations.
<p>
   Clinton chose a place that, while long a bastion of quiet New
England money, has in recent years become a haven for newly minted
millionaires and baby boomers at the top of their game. Much like
himself.
<p>
   ``Maybe he has more of a need, not being from that crowd,'' George
Edwards, director of the Center for Presidential Studies in Texas,
said of Clinton. ``In Arkansas, being smart and rich is a little
different from the rest of the country. . . . Maybe he's making up for
lost time.''
<p>
   Clinton, a voracious reader and equally avid film buff, can command
the attention of those who write the books and make the movies, and
some who know him say it's the intellectual stimulation he relishes.
<p>
   ``That's fun for them,'' said Carolyn Staley, a Clinton friend
since childhood. She said she sees nothing pompous or posturing about
the Clintons' interest in celebrities. Instead, she said, ``It's like,
`Wow!' They sit back and they are fans (mingling) with people who also
look back at them and say, `Wow!' ''
<p>
   One day he's sailing with the Kennedys and dining at the old
Jacqueline Onassis estate. The next he's whiling away the hours at
author William Styron's house. Then it's off to the country club for a
soiree including Walter Cronkite, Katharine Graham, Diane Sawyer and
her husband Mike Nichols, the director whose latest project is the
movie version of ``Primary Colors,'' the barely fictionalized account
of Clinton's 1992 campaign.
<p>
   Simon, Jimmy Buffett and Carole King have crooned for him.
Weinstein flew Stallone in to perform a scene from ``Copland,'' along
with Clinton pal Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
<p>
   ``I think he really is almost captivated by the Hollywood set,''
said one prominent Vineyarder who has partied with Clinton during this
three-week vacation and did not want to be named.
<p>
   Clinton came to this resort island 12 miles off the Massachusetts
coast for his first two summer vacations as president, before
political adviser Dick Morris convinced him ``photos of him on a yacht
with Jacqueline Onassis did not help his populist image one bit,'' as
the consultant put it in his book, ``Behind the Oval Office.''
<p>
   After polling by Morris, Clinton spent the Augusts of 1995 and 1996
in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Morris failed, however, to prevent the Clintons
from attending the Vineyard wedding of Danson and actress Mary
Steenburgen, an old Arkansas friend. ``There was no way to talk
Hillary out of it,'' he wrote. ``I tried and got burned in the
process.'' &QL;

 &UR; Patrick Robinson's 1st Collection: No Gimmicks &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Designer Patrick Robinson has come to savor the sweet succinctness
of the phrase ``fix it.'' Those two little words can quickly end
unruly debates about production glitches, cut through red tape about
fabric mishaps. The phrase is like aspirin for the owner of a fashion
company that is not yet one year old. It makes the headaches go away.
<p>
   Robinson, who will celebrate his 31st birthday on Sept. 8, already
is a veteran of the garment business. He has lived in the world's
three fashion capitals, worked for a Wunderkind designer, a powerhouse
fashion house and a struggling one. And now he is heading up his first
signature collection.
<p>
   His collection for fall '97, his first, has no high-concept theme.
It is not  &UR; about &LR;  spiritualism, athleticism, power or anything else.
He simply has created beautiful garments in brushed alpaca, nubuck,
python and pony. His blazers, which fall to thigh length, have a bit
of spandex in them for added comfort. The clothes are simply tailored
without tricks or gimmicks. And while they are expensive  &MD;  $800 for a
jacket  &MD;  shoppers at least are assured that they are not investing in
a fly-by-night trend. The clothes have shelf life and relevance.
<p>
   Robinson's enterprise is self-financed at a time when large
companies dominate the business. He struck a deal with three Italian
garment manufacturers. In return for a break on production costs, he
has promised to remain loyal to their factories as his business grows.
It is a partnership based on optimism, business sense and his strong
resume.
<p>
   ``I really enjoy the business part. I enjoy it as much as I enjoy
the designing,'' he says. ``Everyone keeps saying that I understand
the first rule of business: Keep the overhead down.''
<p>
   So Robinson is working and living out of a single downtown New York
loft. It is not some dark, musty old space shared by struggling
artists. It is a beautiful environment full of warm, polished wood and
flooded with sunlight.
<p>
   Robinson was born in Memphis and grew up in Orange County, Calif.
He graduated from Parsons School of Design and then headed to Paris to
work as designer Patrick Kelly's first assistant. ``He was a pretty
amazing person,'' Robinson says. ``After talking with him for a few
minutes, you'd be willing to sweep the floor for him.''
<p>
   In the '90s, Robinson was responsible for many of the Giorgio
Armani power suits that female big shots have relied upon when
dealmaking and strong-arming. He designed Armani's Collezione
womenswear line  &MD;  or the ``white label,'' as it is casually called.
``I think at Armani, it was such a well-defined place to be. I was
successful there because I was able to capture what he wanted.''
<p>
   And then about two years ago, he was named head designer for the
Anne Klein Collection. He was brought in after Richard Tyler had tried
and failed to turn the struggling line around. Robinson designed three
collections for the house but only two made it into the stores before
the plug was pulled.
<p>
   ``At Anne Klein, I may have enjoyed it more if I had expressed more
of myself,'' Robinson says. ``It was a tough ship to try and lead back
to the right path.''
<p>
   For all of the stress at Anne Klein and the experience gained with
Armani and Kelly, Robinson emerged with a strong stomach for the
vagaries and demands of the fashion industry.
<p>
   ``I have no fear about business and production and all of that,''
he says. Working in so many cities ``made me more international. It
made me look at everything I do as not being a product made in one
country.''
<p>
   The task before him now is to give his clothes an identity in the
minds of consumers.
<p>
   ``If you can say that Ralph Lauren is about an old English
lifestyle, Calvin (Klein) is sexy, Donna (Karan), when she's really
on, is power wear; Patrick Robinson should be something about
adventure, something with lots of cultures mixed in. I'm looking not
only to America for inspiration, but the world.''
<p>
   ``I'm a black man and I love being that,'' he says. ``I love being
different than other people. That's part of it, too.'' &QL;

 &UR; Chicken Being Scared to Death Halts Rocket Test (Tokyo) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO  &MD;  The moon is the goal of a $250 million space project Japan
announced last week, but right now the biggest challenge to the
nation's space agency might be 500 dead chickens.
<p>
   Last May, when the space agency was conducting safety tests
involving its new rockets, a blast using 110 pounds of explosives
startled 500 chickens on the northern island of Hokkaido, apparently
causing them to stampede and crush themselves against a hen-house
wall.
<p>
   After months of investigation, an apologetic National Space
Development Agency told local chicken farmers and horse breeders it
will move the tests from the village of Tomakomai to another site,
possibly overseas, despite the effort and expense involved.
<p>
   ``Before conducting the tests, we couldn't imagine that this would
hurt chickens,'' agency spokesman Takashi Endo said. ``This is a very
serious problem for us. . . . We have made trouble for the people in
the chicken business.''
<p>
   In the United States, suspending multimillion-dollar space
exploration experiments over fatally panicked chickens would probably
be fodder for late night television monologues. In Japan, it's no
laughing matter. The chickens-and-space-rockets incident illustrates
both the problems of a crowded country and the lengths the Japanese
government takes to avoid being perceived as a bully.
<p>
   Japan has 126 million people living in a nation the size of
Montana. On average, that means 850 people live in every square mile
here, compared to 70 people per square mile in the United States.
<p>
   ``Americans have all this space. They have Cape Canaveral. They
probably can't understand how this problem with the chickens could
happen,'' said Mitsuru Yaku, who frequently offers humorous commentary
on television. ``They probably think: Just give the chickens earplugs
 &MD;  it's a lot cheaper.''
<p>
   Noise is a major complaint of Japanese neighbors because people
live so close together. And since there are no huge expanses of land,
like the American West, where military or space projects can be
tested, to Japanese residents, complaining about loud rocket tests is
like ``complaining about piano noise from next door,'' Yaku said.
<p>
   On May 16, Japan's space agency was conducting preliminary safety
tests involving the new H-IIA rocket. That rocket is to be part of the
Japan's plan to put Selene, an unmanned explorer, on the moon in 2004.
Selene, named after the ancient Greek goddess of the moon, is to orbit
the moon for a year before landing on it, and Japanese scientists hope
it will capture radio signals from Jupiter and Saturn.
<p>
   Endo said there is still plenty of time to find alternative sites
for the rocket safety tests so Selene can be launched on time. But, he
added, ``We don't know how much (moving the tests) will cost, because
we don't know where they will be.''
<p>
   Yoshimasa Sato, a resident of the village of Atsuma, near the May
rocket blasts, said he, like many neighbors, ``sympathized with the
chickens.'' He said he is sorry the business and investment that
accompanied the space agency will leave. And, he said, he understands
that the sparsely populated area on the northern island of Hokkaido is
``one of the last strongholds'' for the space agency. But he said,
``Horses won't have to worry now about being scared off.''
<p>
   Images of forced government land-takings raise uneasy feelings in a
country where unchecked government power led to a disastrous war
earlier this century.
<p>
   There are more than a half-million chickens within a few miles of
the test site. But when the space agency learned 500 in one hen house
had been ``shocked to death,'' as one official said, it organized the
investigating task force.
<p>
   ``We can't be positive about why the hens died, but we can assume
that the tests had an effect,'' Endo said. ``Under these
circumstances, we cannot continue our tests. We had promised people
there would be no problems.'' &QL;

 &UR; Russian Space Officials Blame Cosmonauts for Mir Accident (Moscow) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  Russian Space Agency officials Tuesday cast blame on two
weary cosmonauts for a disastrous June 25 accident on the Mir space
station and hinted they will be fined for mistakes that cost the
Russian space program millions of dollars.
<p>
   A report by the special inquiry commission set up only two weeks
ago said investigation had determined ``beyond any doubt'' that former
Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin
were culpable in the space crash that disabled the station's Spektr
research module and ruined months of experiments.
<p>
   Tsibliyev and Lazutkin remain cloistered at the Star City cosmonaut
base east of Moscow for rehabilitation after six problem-plagued
months in space. But a senior space official confirmed that the two
cosmonauts say they are being made culprits for a deteriorating
manned-space program that reflects this country's general decline.
<p>
   ``From the purely humane point of view, we feel sorry for the crew,
but there is no getting away from the facts,'' Valery Ryumin, deputy
director of the Energia Corp. and coordinator of Mir-NASA programs,
told the quasi-official Tass news agency.
<p>
   Mission Control Center spokesman Vsevolod Latyshev noted there is
precedent for fining cosmonauts deemed responsible for costly errors,
as occurred with Gennady Strekalov after his troubled 1995 flight
aboard Mir. Russian space crews work under contract with the
government and are paid on a per diem basis, with bonuses of as much
as $1,000 for particularly difficult maneuvers like dockings and
spacewalks.
<p>
   While officials declined to specify what punishment might be meted
out to the cosmonauts, one official at Mission Control observed that
``Tsibliyev and Lazutkin may well have made their last trip into
space.''
<p>
   Shortly after the accident, which occurred while Tsibliyev was
practicing a manual docking maneuver with an unmanned cargo craft,
Mission Control sources disclosed suspicions that he had failed to
take into account more than a ton of garbage that had been loaded onto
the cargo drone.
<p>
   Apparently as a result of the weight miscalculation, the supply
capsule approached the docking port with excessive speed and careened
into the hull of the Spektr module. The collision punctured and
depressurized Spektr and knocked out nearly half the space station's
power-generating capacity.
<p>
   Tsibliyev and Lazutkin returned to Earth Aug. 14 and were
immediately confronted with media accusations they had bungled their
mission.
<p>
   ``It's always easy to find a scapegoat,'' Tsibliyev told
journalists at a news conference two days later. ``But tomorrow a
similar problem may occur with another cargo capsule.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, the current crewmen aboard Mir have been practicing for
a spacewalk set for Saturday to find and possibly repair damage to
Spektr. Commander Anatoly Solovev and U.S. astronaut Michael Foale are
expected to don spacesuits and work outside the station for about five
hours.

 &UR; Experts Say Factors Made Diana Crash Inevitable (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The blood alcohol concentration present in Princess
Diana's chauffeur increased his risk of being in a fatal, single
vehicle crash 300 to 600 times above normal, according to research on
the effects of alcohol on driving safety.
<p>
   Add to that the risk that comes with driving at high velocity  &MD;  the
vehicle is reported to have been hurtling at 120 mph, or the length of
two football fields every three seconds  &MD;  and of driving in darkness,
and it is almost inevitable that the car and its occupants would meet
a tragic end, experts said.
<p>
   ``A driver at that alcohol level and in those circumstances has
atrocious hand-eye coordination, delayed reaction responses, poor
decision-making, decreased vision and hearing,'' said Matthew Robb,
director of clinical services at Grace Clinic, which administers
Washington, D.C.'s educational program for people who have been
arrested for drinking while intoxicated.
<p>
   ``At 120 miles per hour, you need superhuman driving skills even in
the best of circumstances,'' Robb said. ``And this guy was not in the
best of circumstances.''
<p>
   Driving a car is a far more complex task than many everyday drivers
appreciate, with constantly changing demands that require quick and
often subtle responses. According to experts at the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, those skills can be divided into two
categories: cognitive skills such as information processing, and
psychomotor skills, which involve eye-brain-hand coordination. Both
suffer badly under the influence of alcohol.
<p>
   Princess Diana's chauffeur had undoubtedly lost significant control
over his voluntary eye movements long before his blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) reached the level of about 0.18 grams per
deciliter detected at autopsy, according to NIAAA research. At BAC
levels as low as 0.03, or about one-sixth those found in the
chauffeur, the ability to focus briefly on an object as it passes by  &MD; 
such as a concrete pillar  &MD;  and then refocus attention on the next,
called ``tracking,'' is seriously compromised. The driver's ability to
steer precisely was also certainly undermined; studies have shown
steering errors at blood alcohol levels as low as 0.035.
<p>
   At levels of 0.04, less than one-fourth those found in Diana's
driver, the attentional field begins to narrow. Lacking the bigger
perspective, drivers are more likely to be surprised by an approaching
object, and to overcompensate by pulling the steering wheel too hard.
<p>
   The chauffeur had two things going for him that might have helped
in less extreme circumstances: He was an experienced driver and a man.
A 1989 study by the Arlington, Va.-based Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety found that younger drivers and female drivers have a
higher chance of being involved in fatal single vehicle accidents
compared to more experienced drivers and male drivers with the same
elevated alcohol levels.
<p>
   But at the extremely high alcohol levels found in the chauffeur, no
amount of experience could have helped, Robb said. ``Judgment goes, so
instead of calling off reckless activity you are much more prone to
get swept up in the emotions of the moment,'' he said. ``Years of
training go by the wayside.''

 &UR; Argentine Beef Returns to U.S. After Long Ban &QL; 
 &UR; (Buenos Aires) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BUENOS AIRES  &MD;  The cut of beef on the table in front of the
Argentine businessman is big enough to choke a Texan, but other than
size, nothing seems special about this particular piece of red meat.
At that suggestion, however, the incredulous Argentine beef exporter
turns livid.
<p>
   He flashes the universal look that says: Pathetic American fools .
``Americans will discover the difference in taste,'' said Patricio J.
Moche, manager of an Argentine beef exporting firm. ``Unless they are
satisfied eating flavorless beef that must be covered in sauces to
swallow it.''
<p>
   Put that on your plate and eat it. In fact, that is exactly what
Argentines are counting on, as the first new shipments of their fresh
beef arrived in Washington, D.C., last week, marking the return of
this country's legendary national staple after a 70-year U.S. ban.
<p>
   Argentine beef, with a far more pungent taste than its American
cousin, is suitable for export again now that ranchers here have
eradicated bovine hoof and mouth disease from their herds under an
intensive, five-year vaccination plan. Although not proven to cause
sickness in humans, the threat the disease posed to overseas herds was
great enough to lead many nations, including the United States, to
prohibit importation of Argentine beef.
<p>
   The mystique of the local steak has been a source of national pride
since the gauchos  &MD;  South American cowboys  &MD;  began corralling feral
cattle on the vast Argentine pampas. The return of Argentine beef to
the United States is being viewed as a major step toward recapturing
the glory days of the nation's beef industry.
<p>
   In hundreds of local parrillas, or steakhouses, peppering Buenos
Aires, diners are often greeted at entrances by full-size stuffed
cattle as slabs of meat roast slowly atop massive iron grills. Until
the early morning hours, customers consume impossible amounts of beef
piled high on sizzling metal plates, often for about half of what a
similar chunk would cost in the United States.
<p>
   Indeed, historically, one of the problems with Argentine beef
exports has been that the local population eats so much, leaving
little for foreigners. Although domestic consumption has decreased
over the past seven years, the Argentines eat about 70 percent of all
the beef this country can produce each year, according the Argentine
Rural Society.
<p>
   Only 20,000 tons of Argentine beef will be shipped to the United
States this year, equivalent to about half a day's production on U.S.
ranches.
<p>
   Over the next three years, however, Argentina hopes to increase
that to 200,000 tons  &MD;  which would boost their worldwide beef exports
by almost 50 percent. More importantly, Argentine agricultural
officials say, if Argentine beef is accepted again in the land of the
cowboy, it would provide a catalyst for increased international demand
 &MD;  especially in burgeoning markets of Southeast Asia.
<p>
   ``There is no reason why Argentine beef cannot conquer the United
States,'' said Argentine Ambassador Diego Guelar.
<p>
   But, experts say, that will not be easy. Argentine beef has a
distinctly different taste than Americans are used to, because cattle
here have completely different ``lifestyles.'' Argentine cattle are
free-range animals, eating grass instead of grain as is common in the
United States. This gives a stronger, almost gamy taste to the meat.
Also, as a result of grazing conditions, Argentine cattle do not
produce beef with as much internal marbling, the lacing of fat that
makes high-quality American steaks so tender. That means Argentine
steaks tend to be less tender, but also leaner and thus lower in
cholesterol, beef experts say.
<p>
   Argentine cattle also are not bulked up with growth hormones, and
export companies here intend to use their ``more natural'' product as
a selling point with U.S. consumers.
<p>
   The proof will be in the taste, and many experts say the Argentines
will have it tough. ``I don't think steak eaters in the United States
will handle the gamier stuff from Argentina,'' said Marcus Taylor,
general manager and executive chef at Washington's Blackies House of
Beef. &QL;

 &UR; Defense's Three-Layer Mix (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  When the giant Defense Department gets a cold, most
other agencies quickly get the sniffles. Even when Defense says it is
just thinking about something, other agencies stand at attention.
<p>
   Defense is often the first agency to get approval to try new
things. It led the way in offering a variety of programs to take the
sting out of downsizing. That included the first, massive use of
early-retirement and buyout offers, as well as ``stopper'' lists and
successor programs to hold and find jobs for federal workers displaced
by base closures or budget cuts.
<p>
   The department's leader-of-the-pack status is the reason other
agencies are watching a Defense concept that could lead to a brand-new
personnel system for 790,000 civilian employees of the Army, Navy and
Air Force.
<p>
   Defense officials say yesterday's column made it appear that the
plan is being studied at the highest levels of the Pentagon and might
go to Congress this year. Instead, they say, Friday's meeting is a
``working group'' of various Defense agency personnel directors and
the like. The plan has many hurdles to clear and isn't on a fast
track, officials say.
<p>
   Be that as it may, remember that Defense is very good at doing its
homework and presenting Congress with legislative proposals that fly
more often than they crash and burn.
<p>
   The proposal before Friday's working group is the response to a
request in March for the Quadrennial Defense Review to ``prepare a
legislative package placing the Department's civilian personnel system
under separate legislative authority'' from the regular civil service
system.
<p>
   As part of that proposal, Defense would  &MD;  if the plan is cleared by
the Pentagon and then approved by Congress and the White House  &MD;  set
up a three-tier personnel system.
<p>
   The first tier would be a core group of current civilian employees.
They would stay in their retirement plan (either the Civil Service
Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System). They
would be less likely to be hit by future layoffs.
<p>
   The second tier would be ``non-permanent employees hired for up to
five years, immediately eligible for health, life and thrift savings
plan coverage but with no immediate government contributions.''
Workers in that group, the working group's memo says, ``would be used
to respond to surge, cyclical or otherwise, could be converted to
permanent status noncompetitively, and therefore could be used as a
``recruitment pool' for permanent hires.'' They could also be let go
at the end of their contract period to avoid reductions in force of
the permanent work force. Although unions would be consulted on the
proposal, an official of the National Association of Government
Employees says it ``sounds like a government effort to set up the
equivalent of a giant work force of migrant labors who could be used,
then dropped, when no longer needed.''
<p>
   The third tier would not contain any federal employees. It would be
made up of ``contractor employees performing work determined to be
non-governmental in nature and more cost effective to outsource to the
private sector.''
<p>
   Defense would also get authority, under the plan, to set up its own
pay and personnel system, although it would retain certain things such
as labor-management agreements, veterans preference, affirmative
action and the right of former employees to unemployment benefits.

 &UR; Gene Finding Stirs Anxieties for Jews &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Bert Vogelstein wasn't looking for a ``Jewish'' cancer gene when he
scanned through a database at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center last
year and noticed something coincidental about two blood samples stored
there.
<p>
   In the end, however, that's what he found: A tiny genetic
alteration, present in one of every six Jews of Eastern European
ancestry and virtually absent in non-Jews, which doubles the odds of
getting colon cancer.
<p>
   The discovery, announced last week, promises a newfound ability to
identify those at risk of the nation's third deadliest cancer and to
offer them better preventive care. But the finding also stirred deep
anxieties within the Jewish community, which has watched in growing
discomfort during the past few years as research has focused on
genetic alterations especially common in Jews, including those that
cause breast and ovarian cancer, cystic fibrosis, Tay Sachs, Gaucher's
and Canavan disease.
<p>
   The news led many Jews to ask whether they really have more genetic
diseases than other groups and if so, why. Some said they are worried
that reports of such findings may have a negative impact on the image
of Jews among non-Jews.
<p>
   ``We've been receiving phone calls indicating a certain amount of
fear and confusion,'' said Amy Rutkin, director of American Affairs
for Hadassah, the nation's largest Jewish membership organization.
``People are asking, 'Is too much research focusing on the Jewish
community and are we at risk of stigmatization?'''
<p>
   It has been only a few decades, several Jewish leaders noted, since
millions perished for their purported genetic inferiority. Could new
research lead to a reawakening of those racist views?
<p>
   ``We are still living with some history, a history of
discrimination,'' said Karen Rothenberg, a University of Maryland law
professor who has studied the sociology of Jews and their genes. ``We
all hope that by finding these mutations we can find cures for cancer
that will cure everyone, but so far all we have is a lot of disturbing
stuff about Jewish people and their mutations.''
<p>
   Some experts said they consider it risky to even talk about the
subject of Jews and genes, for fear of reinvigorating antisemitic
ideas. But others in the Jewish community said it's best to discuss
the topic openly, and have faith that an honest discussion will foster
understanding.
<p>
   The essence of that understanding is complicated, both genetically
and spiritually, scientists and Jewish leaders said. But most
geneticists have concluded that any seemingabundance of inherited
mutations among Jews is an artifact born of several unrelated factors,
including the nature of genetic research and the ease with which some
people can be identified as Jewish on the basis of something as simple
as their last name.
<p>
   ``Many Jews might say, `Us again?''' when reading the latest news
about the gene for colon cancer, said Patricia Hartge, a National
Cancer Institute epidemiologist. ``But the truth is, it could have
been the Icelanders, the Finns or anyone else you might be studying.''
<p>
   The problem for Jews, and the great benefit they offer geneticists,
Hartge and others said, is that they constitute a well-defined, easily
identifiable and closely related community  &MD;  exactly the kind of
population that allows geneticists to start identifying
disease-causing genes.
<p>
   Similar links have been found between specific diseases and
similarly isolated and genetically intact populations. The Amish have
a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disease, some Native American
groups are very prone to diabetes, African Americans have sickle cell
anemia, northern Europeans have cystic fibrosis.
<p>
   Francis Collins, chief of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, has repeatedly reminded the public that ``everyone is a
mutant,'' carrying dozens of scrambled genes. If a group were
especially freighted with such errors, he said, members might be
expected to have shorter lifespans as a whole, which Jews do not.
<p>
   But for a variety of reasons  &MD;  including the Jewish community's
early entry into the genetic testing field for prenatal screening of
Tay Sachs disease (a fatal childhood disorder) and a cultural
consensus among many Jews that it is good to contribute to medical
research  &MD;  the number of findings has been notable in that population.
<p>
   No one is more sensitized to the potential for such
misunderstandings than Vogelstein himself, an Ashkenazi geneticist
whose father and father's fathers were all rabbis for 13 generations
back. ``I am aware of the potential for discrimination and
stigmatization,'' he said. ``But I also see a chance for this
information to save lives.''
<p>
   Vogelstein happened onto the colon cancer discovery when a Jewish
acquaintance who had colon cancer asked whether his cancer might be
due to a mutation in a cancer gene known as APC. Tests indicated the
man did not have the classic mutation in that gene, but he did have a
slight genetic ``misspelling'' elsewhere in the gene that Vogelstein
assumed was inconsequential.
<p>
   Later, Vogelstein came upon another case of colon cancer in someone
who had the same alteration. Looking at the name, he realized that
this person, like his friend, was probably Jewish. ``I looked at the
name and said, 'You know, maybe this is not a coincidence,'''
Vogelstein said.
<p>
   The finding of a disease gene specific to Jews should not be
surprising, Vogelstein said. The Ashkenaze population dwindled to very
low numbers about 900 years ago, and the rules of chance suggest that
several of those survivors may have carried unusual genes. Given the
historically low rates of intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews,
those genes would have remained at an unusually high frequency in
descendants today.
<p>
   Many genetically related groups no doubt have similar links to
other diseases, Hartge said, but such links are more difficult to spot
in groups that have splintered and intermarried. Avis Miller,
associate rabbi at Adas Israel congregation in the District, said the
local Jewish population has gained a relativly sophisticated
understanding of genetics, in part because of the educational program
that accompanied a recent study of inherited breast and ovarian cancer
among 5,000 Washington area Jews. ''We understand it's not that we
have so many more diseases than other groups, but that we are a
definable population that can be easily tested,'' Miller said.
<p>
   Still, Miller said, it's not easy for Jews to see stories about
their disease genes popping up in newspapers, magazines, and the
Jewish press (the topic dominates the latest issue of ``Forward,'' a
widely distributed Jewish newspaper). She said she has heard some
people who converted to Judaism say only half-jokingly that their
non-Jewish genes should help the group.
<p>
   Jews' long history of participation in genetic testing has also
contributed to the high number of findings within that group.
Thousands of blood samples are stored at medical centers around the
country, left over from the Tay Sachs tests that most Jews now take
before they have children. These samples have become a convenient
resource for scientists studying various diseases, especially if there
is any hint that the disease may be common in Jews; Vogelstein relied
on hundreds of such specimens  &MD;  some of them decades old  &MD;  to spot the
new colon gene defect. But while the samples are a boon for
scientists, it also means that it is easier to find problems in the
Jewish population than in other populations that do not have such
accessible blood collections. And it's easy for overrepresentation of
a group to become a broader misimpression, experts said.
<p>
   For example, it's still not known whether Jewish women have a
higher rate of inherited breast cancer than other women. But many have
been left with that impression because, of the hundreds of mutations
that have been identified in the so-called breast cancer gene, BRCA1,
the most studied is the one that is common in Jews.
<p>
   Current studies of Icelandic women, many of whom carry a mutation
in another breast cancer gene, BRCA2, may help demonstrate that every
group has its own particular way of getting into the same genetic
trouble.
<p>
   Others said that the particular genetic bottleneck that Jews
squeezed through centuries ago may have left them with a higher
predisposition to inherited cancers while other groups may have higher
predispositions to other diseases. But since cancer is the major focus
of genetic research today, the other groups may get less notice.
<p>
   Rothenberg said she worries as much about the impact of genetic
research on the Jewish ``soul'' as she worries about its impact on
Jewish bodies. ``What will it do to our sense of identity?'' she
asked.
<p>
   There are no simple answers to such questions, but a strong
emphasis on ethics, education and informed consent in genetic research
should help, Rothenberg said. She said current informed consent
documents that must be signed by research study participants spell out
various risks, such as the possibility of losing health insurance or
facing discrimination in the workplace on the basis of genetic
findings. ``But they don't talk about the possibility of group
stigma,'' she said.

 &UR; Czech Prejudice, TV Fuel Gypsy Migration to Canada &QL; 
 &UR; By Howard Schneider &QC; and Christine Spolar  &QC; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Karolina Bonomova was frightened when she heard that a gang of
Canadian skinheads had gathered outside the Lido Hotel near Toronto,
temporary home to some of the hundreds of Gypsies who have fled the
Czech Republic for Canada in recent months.
<p>
   She said the reminder of her homeland, which she and others left to
avoid beatings and harassment by such neo-Nazi groups, was both eerie
and in conflict with the peaceful image of Canada that has taken root
among the Romany people, as the Gypsies refer to themselves.
<p>
   But what happened next, she said, explains why so many of her
people have left their homes for Toronto. The police arrived within
minutes. They positioned themselves between the Gypsies and the
skinheads and stayed until the possibility of trouble eased. In
Prague, said the former university student, police would have watched
until the skinheads administered their ritual round of kicks and
punches.
<p>
   ``I am very hopeful that the Canadian police don't react the way
the Czech police react,'' Bonomova, 28, said through an interpreter.
The Czech police ``don't react until the skins beat us up. . . . I
hope here that I will find safety, . . . that (people) will understand
our problem so we can start a new life.''
<p>
   Bonomova arrived in Toronto in May with her daughter and other
relatives as part of a surge of Gypsy immigration that has taken
Canadian officials by surprise and embarrassed the Czech Republic's
emerging democracy.
<p>
   About 550 Gypsies have arrived in Canada this year, claiming status
as refugees from racial persecution in the Czech Republic. The numbers
are small, particularly for Canada, which accepts approximately 30,000
refugees among 200,000 annual immigrants.
<p>
   But the Gypsies have filled Toronto homeless shelters to
overflowing. Their arrival has forced Canadian immigration officials
to puzzle through a refugee wave apparently started by word of mouth
but stoked by a Czech television documentary, aired Aug. 7, that
portrayed Canada as a land of spacious housing, plentiful welfare,
jobs for the asking and trips to Niagara Falls.
<p>
   ``All you Gypsies, if you have money, jump on a plane and come
over,'' said a woman identified on the Nova TV show as Margit Bangova,
surrounded by children and speaking Czech. ``There you will be hungry
and pushed aside. And you'll always be judged. . . . Here, you will
live like kings, like the Canadians.''
<p>
   Nova reporter Josef Klima, in an interview in Prague, acknowledged
the documentary erred on the positive side in portraying Canada and
excluded comments from some Gypsies who said their main reason for
emigrating was Canada's reputation for rich social programs.
<p>
   Gypsies have been arriving steadily in Canada since it lifted its
visa requirement for Czech travelers last year. In an interview in
Toronto last week, Slovak-born lawyer George Kubes, who was featured
on the documentary and represents several hundred new arrivals, said
he thinks the migration has just begun.
<p>
   ``The flood has not even started yet,'' Kubes said. ``Whole towns
are eyeing this situation.''
<p>
   Concerned that he might be right, Canada took the unusual step of
sending a delegate from its embassy in Prague to conduct television
interviews and speak with Gypsy groups. The envoy was not spreading
the gospel that Canada heads the 1997 U.N. list of national economic
and social development. The mission, rather, was to remind potential
immigrants that it's hard to find a job if you don't speak English or
French, housing is expensive and hard to acquire and no one greets you
at the airport with a welfare check.
<p>
   ``Nobody is waiting for them with open arms. Nobody is giving them
money. There are no jobs waiting for them. That's the message we're
trying to get across,'' said Terrance Mooney, Canada's acting charge
d'affaires in Prague. ``What we've been attempting to do here is bring
some truth to the matter.''
<p>
   A nomadic people who originated in India, the Gypsies have long
been at the bottom of Europe's social and economic scale. Employment,
even restaurant service, is denied them in some areas, and they are
frequently the target of beatings and violence that some courts are
reluctant to punish.
<p>
   From that perspective, Canada looks pretty good, welfare payments
or not.
<p>
   On the other hand, the Czech Republic has taken steps, and is
pledging more. A citizenship law widely viewed as discriminatory
against Slovak-born Gypsies has been relaxed. And as the country
positions itself for NATO membership in 1999, the government is
preparing to announce a new policy to aid its approximately 300,000
Gypsies.
<p>
   ``Why don't we like it here? They won't serve us coffee in
restaurants. We're afraid to go out at night. . . . But do you know
what's interesting?'' said Helena Sivakova. ``We've been having these
problems for 40 years and nobody's cared. Only when we want to go to
Canada, all of a sudden people pay attention.'' &QL;

 &UR; Palace Officials Scramble to Deal With Mourning Crowds (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  With lines of mourners lengthening and the mounds of
flowers growing larger by the hour, officials at Buckingham Palace
grappled Tuesday with how to handle the massive crowds now expected to
assemble for Saturday's funeral services for Diana, Princess of Wales.
<p>
   The extraordinary outpouring of emotion, which appeared to catch
palace officials and even the public by surprise, seemed to intensify
Tuesday.
<p>
   Police estimated that 100,000 people a day are passing by
Kensington Palace, where Diana resided. The wait to sign the official
Book of Condolence at St. James's Palace was estimated at up to eight
hours, despite the overnight increase to 15 in the number of books
available to sign.
<p>
   Palace officials braced for an even larger gathering of people for
Saturday's funeral services, with estimates of 1 million or more
attempting to pack themselves into the relatively small area of royal
London where the events will take place.
<p>
   Some mourners complained that the processional route from St.
James's Palace, where Diana's coffin lies in private, to the funeral
site at Westminster Abbey will not accommodate all the people hoping
to pay their last respects to a woman whose death has triggered a
worldwide reaction that has been compared to the outpouring that came
after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.
<p>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend the funeral, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Sunday, but will not be representing
the U.S. government. President Clinton's attendance was ruled out,
White House officials said, because it is not a state funeral. The
First Lady's invitation came jointly from Diana's family and the
ruling Windsor family,
<p>
   Diana was killed in an automobile crash in Paris early Sunday that
also took the life of her companion, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the
car in which they were riding. A bodyguard was badly injured and
remains hospitalized and reportedly unable to speak.
<p>
   Palace officials said that, rather than extending the route of the
procession, which they consider impractical, they will attempt to
narrow the street corridors the cortege will follow to create more
room for the spectators. They also said mourners could pay respects by
lining the route that Diana's hearse will travel after the funeral as
it makes its way to the chapel on the family estate, Althorp, outside
of London, where her remains will be interred.
<p>
   Meanwhile, palace officials announced that the funeral procession
will include 500 representatives of the charities for which Diana had
worked in recent years. Many of those invited to join will be
children, while others may include AIDS patients or land-mine victims,
two causes with which the princess was closely identified in recent
years.
<p>
   At the same time, officials said a memorial fund will be
established in Diana's name to continue the charitable work she was
involved in. The fund was established after charities linked to her
were flooded with inquiries about donations. Called ``The Diana,
Princess of Wales Memorial Fund,'' the foundation will be administered
by Kensington Palace. Officials said contributions could be sent in
the name of the fund to Kensington Palace.
<p>
   Palace officials also announced that the nation will observe a
moment of silence at the end of the funeral services on Saturday, but
no other details were announced. The funeral is scheduled to begin at
11 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT) and will last about 50 minutes, according to
officials. Many businesses here will close for at least part of the
day.
<p>
   The services are being coordinated through Buckingham Palace, in
close consultation with Diana's family. Invitations to the 2,000
people who will be allowed into Westminster Abbey are being made by
telephone, officials said. The 500 charity representatives  &MD;  five from
each of roughly 100 charities  &MD;  will view the services on a large
screen outside the abbey.
<p>
   Already, however, there are complaints that the public may be
shortchanged by those planning the services. There also was criticism
over the decision not to allow Diana's coffin to lie in state. Palace
officials have said that decision was made jointly by the royal family
and Diana's family.
<p>
   Others questioned why members of the royal family have remained
silent since Diana's death, with neither Queen Elizabeth nor Diana's
ex-husband Prince Charles issuing any statement. ``I think the
reaction (of the public) has shocked the royal family,'' said Vanessa
Belton, who was waiting outside St. James's Palace with her mother,
Rose.
<p>
   The royal family remained at Balmoral in Scotland Tuesday, with
reports that Charles and his younger son Prince Harry went for a walk
in the afternoon. It was not clear when they would return to London.
<p>
   Even more disturbing to many of the thousands of mourners who came
out Tuesday was the bare flag pole over Buckingham Palace. Other flags
around the city are at half-staff, but at the palace there is no flag
at all. The absence of a flag is protocol when Queen Elizabeth is not
in residence at Buckingham Palace, but the barren pole was nonetheless
seen by many people as a symbol of insensitivity by the royal family.
<p>
   Throughout central London there was a sense that officials were
scrambling simply to keep up with the masses of people coming to pay
their respects to Diana.
<p>
   Around St. James's Palace, the lines continued to grow, and workers
had to erect new barriers along the sidewalks to allow the snaking
line to remain orderly. As other crews set up stands and platforms
along the procession route for the funeral, mourners continued to
deposit flowers anywhere they deemed appropriate.
<p>
   At Kensington Palace, the flowers covered an area estimated at 50
by 30 feet. There were more flowers as well at Harrods department
store, which is owned by Dodi Fayed's father, billionaire Egyptian
businessman Mohamed Fayed.
<p>
   The mourners represented a remarkable cross section of the
country's population. Some follow the royals' every move, and several
of them said they had attended the marriage of Charles and Diana in
1981. But others have had little interest in the royal family, other
than through Diana.
<p>
   The reports from Paris that the driver of the car in which Diana
was riding at the time of the crash had a blood alcohol level at least
three times the legal limit in France raised new questions about
security arrangements for the princess.
<p>
   Officials here noted that Diana had voluntarily given up her
security guard several years ago after she separated from Charles.
``It was no secret,'' one official said.
<p>
   Her sons continue to have protection through the palace, and
whenever Diana was with them, she was protected as well and would have
had the services of an official driver. But on her own, the officials
said, she chose a scaled-down security entourage that in Paris meant
the use of a driver from the Ritz Hotel, which is also owned by
Mohamed Fayed. &QL;

 &UR; Paris Investigating Photographers &QL; 
 &UR; For `Involuntary Homicide' (Paris) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS  &MD;  Six photographers and one of their motorcycle drivers were
placed under investigation by the Paris prosecutor Tuesday for
``involuntary homicide,'' a step toward bringing criminal charges
against them in the deaths of Princess Diana, Dodi Fayed and the
driver of the Mercedes-Benz sedan whose crash killed them.
<p>
   The seven men also will be investigated for failing to aid the
accident's victims, which is obligatory in France. Judicial sources
held out the possibility that other photographers would be named in
the criminal inquiry. Several reportedly fled the scene of the
accident before police could stop them and are being sought by law
enforcement authorities.
<p>
   The photographers and the driver were freed after being placed
under investigation, a step in the French legal system somewhat short
of being a suspect. They had been held since the accident early Sunday
morning. The prosecutor had requested that two continue to be
detained, but instead they were required to post bail and were
forbidden to work as journalists while the case is pending.
<p>
   As they were released and their handcuffs removed, the suspects
slipped out side entrances to the huge courthouse building, avoiding
the waiting banks of television and still cameras. French
photographers said they would not have taken pictures of them anyway,
out of ``solidarity.'' The seven also were said by other journalists
to have avoided the spotlight because they had sold their stories of
detention to tabloid newspapers and wanted to preserve exclusivity.
<p>
   They are: Nicola Arsov of the SIPA agency, Jacques Langevin of
Sygma, Serge Arnal of Stills, freelancer Laslo Veres, Stephane
Darmone, a driver for the Gamma agency, Romuald Rat of Gamma and
Christian Martinez of Angeli. Rat and Martinez had been recommended
for detention and posted bail instead.
<p>
   Involuntary homicide is punishable by a prison sentence of up to 15
years, failing to assist victims by up to five years' incarceration
and a fine of up to $80,600.
<p>
   Although prosecutors did not specify the evidence they had against
the paparazzi, witnesses have described a nightmarish scene of 10 to
15 photographers swarming around the crushed Mercedes, taking pictures
inches from Diana's face as she lay trapped in the back seat,
unconscious. Reports Tuesday also indicated photographers had pushed
policemen and swore at them. Diana died in the hospital less than four
hours after the crash.
<p>
   Also Tuesday, the family of Dodi Fayed and of Henri Paul, the
driver, said they would file civil suits in the case, which under
French law would allow them to participate in the actions by the
French justice system against the suspects.
<p>
   The seven men were placed under investigation as part of a criminal
inquiry that opened Tuesday under the auspices of an investigating
magistrate. The magistrate, Herve Stephan, will continue the
investigation begun by police following the auto accident early Sunday
morning in a highway tunnel on the Right Bank of the Seine River.
<p>
   William Bourdon, lawyer for Arsov, criticized what he called ``show
justice'' and said he thought the seven were being made scapegoats.
<p>
   The men were picked up following a high-speed chase from the Ritz
Hotel, where Diana and Fayed ate their last dinner, that ended when
the Mercedes S-280 rammed into a pillar in a highway tunnel at a speed
that has been reported as high as 125 miles per hour. The speed has
not been confirmed by police.
<p>
   The blood level of the driver, Paul, was more than three times the
legal limit for driving in France. Some press reports Tuesday said
Paul, the assistant director of security at the Ritz, who had been
called in because the regular chauffeur drove a decoy car to lure
photographers away, was well known at the hotel as a drinker. Those
reports could not be confirmed, and family and residents of Paul's
home town of Lorient in western France would not comment. The Ritz had
no comment Tuesday and said it would make a statement Wednesday.
<p>
    &UR; -(optional trim to end)- &QC; 
<p>
   Although police and prosecutors did not specify the results of
their investigations into the actions of the photographers that night,
a widely quoted police report Tuesday said two of them had engaged in
a scuffle with police trying to move them out of their way.
<p>
   The police report said the paparazzi were ``virulent, disgusting,
they were continuing to take pictures and were deliberately preventing
the police officer from aiding the victim,'' according to several
accounts of it. It said one photographer said: ``You are pissing me
off. Let me do my job. In Sarajevo, the cops allow us to work. Go and
get shot at and you'll see what it is like.''
<p>
   Other witnesses also have described photographers ``swarming''
around the car. A doctor who was one of the first to arrive at the
accident scene, however, said that while the photographers were
present, they did not interfere.
<p>
   Rat's lawyer, Philippe Benamou, said his client had reached into
the crashed vehicle and taken Diana's pulse while he was taking
pictures of the wreckage. ``He wanted to see if she was dead or
alive,'' the lawyer said. ``He saw that she was alive, and police were
arriving at the same time. It happened so quickly.''
<p>
   Frederic Mailliez, an emergency room physician, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday that he stopped at the accident scene about a minute
after the crash occurred. Smoke was still rising from the vehicle, he
said, and the horn was sounding from the driver's body leaning on it.
Already, photographers surrounded the car taking pictures. Mailliez
called for an ambulance but was told help was on the way.
<p>
   A volunteer firefighter was working on Trevor Rees-Jones, the
bodyguard in the front passenger seat who was to be the only survivor.
Mailliez confirmed Tuesday that Rees-Jones was the only passenger in
the Mercedes who was wearing a seat belt.
<p>
   Mailliez then turned to the only other living person, Diana. He did
not recognize her, he said, but began to administer first aid
immediately.
<p>
   As he attempted to treat her, for between five and 10 minutes, the
photographers continued taking pictures, but they did not get in the
way, he said. Asked if they assisted, he responded that they told him
the victims spoke English. Should they have done more? ``They wouldn't
have known what to do,'' he said. ``They were like any other
passersby.''
<p>
   For his part, Mailliez, who left as soon as more medical assistance
arrived, said he felt great frustration that he could not put his
skills to better use.
<p>
   ``I could not have done more without equipment,'' he said. ``But
whether it was Lady Di or a drunken bum, my feeling was great
frustration. It would have taken very specialized equipment to revive
her, and I did not have it.''
<p>
   Mailliez said that if photographers had an altercation with
authorities it was after he had left.

 &UR; The Silence of Grief Amid London's Bustle (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  The first thing you notice is the silence: The center of
London, with all its monuments and its boulevards and its palaces, is
as quiet as a church.
<p>
   The death of Princess Diana was such a profound shock for Britain
that many people, including many officials, did not know quite how to
react. On Sunday and Monday, crowds of people pouring toward the royal
palaces to express their condolences had to fight their way through
the city's normal choking traffic. The result was gridlock for
motorists and an obstacle course for pedestrians trying to lay
bouquets of flowers.
<p>
   Tuesday, as Britain settled into a routine of mourning, authorities
closed off all the streets around Buckingham and St. James's palaces
to traffic, roughly the area between Hyde Park Corner and Trafalgar
Square. The effect was to create, within this huge metropolis bustling
about its workday, a smaller London that moved to a slow, stately,
elegiac pace.
<p>
   At the circle in front of Buckingham Palace, a place usually filled
with the sound of black taxicabs honking their horns at tourists who
looked left instead of right while stepping off the curb, a policeman
cocked his ear and marveled: ``Listen to that. It's so quiet. I've
never heard it like this. Never.''
<p>
   Britons have surprised even themselves with their great outpouring
of emotion following Diana's death. The national stereotype calls for
accepting tragedy with a stiff upper lip, but Britain is obviously
shocked, and obviously unashamed to show its feelings. Anchormen
become choked up on the air. Callers to talk shows read poetry they
have written in Diana's honor. People talk of little else than her
death and her upcoming funeral.
<p>
   Tuesday, as they have done the previous two days, thousands came to
place flowers at the gates in front of Buckingham Palace, the
residence of Queen Elizabeth II. They came in silence: The perpetual
large crowd in front of the palace, hundreds of people at any given
time, makes no noise. People whisper, or do not speak at all.
<p>
   There are thousands of bouquets stretching the length of the ornate
palace gates, flowers along with teddy bears, handwritten notes,
paintings and sketches of Diana. The messages are full of unabashed
sentiment. ``The one and only Lady Diana. The one jewel in the
crown,'' reads one note, attached to a bunch of irises, slowly wilting
in the uncommonly bright sunshine.
<p>
   Walking down the Mall from Buckingham Palace toward Trafalgar
Square was like being sent back in time. With no traffic noise, and no
shouting or laughing from tourists, the only sound was the crunching
of gravel underfoot. A few mounted policemen rode past, and then a
dozen of the Queen's Guard riding tall in scarlet coats, and then
another mounted group in ceremonial green capes  &MD;  the clip-clop of
horses, sounds that echoed along the Mall 200 years ago.
<p>
   Stretching several blocks was a line of people waiting to sign the
book of condolences at St. James's Palace, where Diana's body is lying
until her funeral Saturday. Polite policemen informed them they would
have to wait several hours, but no one seemed deterred. Some people
tried to explain why they were willing to spend so much time standing
in line in Diana's memory  &MD;  ``It's just her, really, everything she
meant and stood for,'' one man said. Many others declined to try, and
some made clear they blamed the media at least in part for the
princess's death.
<p>
   A couple of miles away, on the other side of Hyde Park, lies
another oasis of quiet amid the cacophonous city  &MD;  Kensington Palace,
where Diana lived. Tuesday, adjacent Kensington Gardens were full of
the usual lunchtime strollers, frisbee throwers and rollerbladers. But
as you walked toward the palace, the moment you crossed an imaginary
line the noise ended.
<p>
   In front of the Kensington Palace gates was a large, silent crowd,
thousands strong  &MD;  a crowd disproportionately full of young people,
black and brown people, women, a crowd that said New Britain rather
than Old. Diana had a special appeal for people who felt left out of
traditional British society, and they have come to say goodbye. ``I
wouldn't do this for any of that other royal lot, not in a hundred
years,'' said a fashionably dressed young black woman who gave her
name as Tandy.
<p>
   Kensington Palace is also the site of the biggest floral display  &MD; 
tens of thousands of bouquets, with more added every minute.
<p>
   The final quiet place in central London on Tuesday was the sidewalk
in front of the Harrods department store  &MD;  the store owned by Mohamed
Fayed, whose son Dodi died with Diana in the automobile crash in Paris
early Sunday. Harrods is in a narrow, bustling, noisy part of west
London. The area is full of people at any time of the day or night,
busy people hurrying about their business.
<p>
   Yet when people passed the tables where the condolence books for
Dodi Fayed were available for signing, they fell silent. They walked
past without speaking. Some stopped and joined the line. &QL;

 &UR; U.S. Troops Relinquish TV Transmitter to Serbs (Sarajevo) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina  &MD;  Surrounded by stick-wielding Bosnian
Serbs, U.S. troops agreed Tuesday to relinquish a television
transmitter they had controlled to forces answering to war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic.
<p>
   In exchange, the Serbs, under the direction of Karadzic ally
Momcilo Krajisnik, promised to end inflammatory anti-West rhetoric and
permit opposition voices on the air.
<p>
   Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb member of the country's three-man
presidency, praised the deal as a ``wise'' step by NATO peacekeepers
to avoid conflict with the Serbs. Others wondered if the Americans had
blinked, having been embarrassed by last week's bungling of a military
operation to take over pro-Karadzic police stations.
<p>
   Adding insult to injury, the newly restored television transmission
was used Tuesday night to cancel Serbian participation in crucial
municipal elections scheduled for Sept. 13-14.
<p>
   The transmitter, on a hilltop in northeastern Bosnia, was seized by
American troops last week as part of a campaign to shore up Karadzic
foe Biljana Plavsic, president of the Bosnian Serb Republic. But the
troops soon became targets of about 200 angry, stone-hurling Serbs.
<p>
   Media and police are the two central tools in the battle to gain
and hold onto power in this part of the world. Last week, U.S.-led
NATO troops attempted to install Plavsic forces in police stations in
three cities and two towns, and to take the transmitter at Udrigovo,
near the city of Bijeljina.
<p>
   In all three cities, the operation failed and police loyal to
Karadzic and his hard-line coterie remained in charge; in one city,
Brcko, angry crowds blocked and attacked American forces in an ugly
melee broadcast the world over. And with Tuesday's agreement, the
transmitter also reverted to Karadzic's allies.
<p>
   From his village stronghold in Pale near Sarajevo, Karadzic,
indicted by an international war crimes court on genocide charges, is
locked in a power struggle with his one-time partner, Plavsic. She
accuses him and his inner circle of corruption and of enriching
themselves while most Bosnian Serbs languish in poverty.
<p>
   For the last several months, the Clinton administration has pursued
a more aggressive course of action in Bosnia, signaling a
determination to isolate Karadzic by promoting Plavsic. But in the
last week, faced with their first military challenge, U.S. efforts
have crashed  &MD;  with negative consequences on military, diplomatic and
political fronts.
<p>
   Plavsic, after making important gains in the northwestern portion
of the Bosnian Serb Republic, has lost momentum and stalled. The
American military has appeared weak to the Serbs, making future
confrontations more likely.
<p>
   And an always precarious unity within the international peacemaking
mission here has been shattered. European and other international
allies said the United States is forcing its agenda through with
little laying of political groundwork and with disregard for legal
backing.
<p>
   The Udrigovo transmitter was crucial because it controlled
television signals to key, disputed cities. With the U.S. takeover of
the tower last Thursday, hateful rhetoric that Bosnian Serb
hard-liners were using to incite violence against Western peacekeepers
could not reach those cities.
<p>
   On Monday, crowds of Bosnian Serbs, bused in and directed by men
with walkie-talkies, began surrounding the heavily armed U.S. troops,
who encircled the transmitter and built barricades. The mobs, which
swelled to around 250 people, hurled stones and insults until the
troops fired tear gas to subdue the onslaught.
<p>
   Still armed with sticks and wooden clubs, and consuming plenty of
plum brandy, the Serbs staged a kind of sit-in around the Americans
overnight and well into Tuesday morning. They finally dispersed later
Tuesday, NATO spokesmen said, after troops permitted four Bosnian Serb
policemen and three technicians from Pale television to enter the
transmitting station.
<p>
   On Tuesday night, the signal from Pale television was again on the
air in cities like Brcko and Bijeljina, which Plavsic and Karadzic
forces continue to dispute.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   International officials said the decision to first take and then
surrender the transmitter came from NATO's Supreme Commander, U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who has taken an unusually hands-on approach
to Bosnia since assuming the top NATO military post in July.
<p>
   The compromise was struck between Krajisnik and Clark's
representative in Bosnia, U.S. Army Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, in the wee
hours of Tuesday. Krajisnik promised that the Bosnian Serb television
and radio (SRT) will refrain from inflammatory language against NATO
and international peacekeepers and will give an hour a day in
programming time to opposition politicians.
<p>
   The hard-line Bosnian Serb leadership has signed and then ignored
similar agreements in the past. On Tuesday night's SRT news broadcast,
the station's director, Miroslav Toholj, congratulated the
demonstrators who confronted the American forces at the Bijeljina
transmitter, lauding their ``bravery'' and ``defense of human
rights.''
<p>
   Krajisnik, clearly relieved that pressure seemed to be abating,
said he was glad ``more calm winds'' had prevailed.
<p>
   And on the same newscast, prime minister Gojko Klickovic said
fraudulent voter registration that has allowed Muslims to outnumber
Serbs in some Serb-held cities will prevent Bosnian Serbs from
participating in Sept. 13-14 municipal elections. If this holds, it
would be a major blow to international efforts to conduct elections as
an important step in rebuilding the post-war country.
<p>
   NATO officials contend their actions in recent weeks are not
directed at supporting Plavsic but simply are meant to prevent
violence between rival factions. In a statement released late Monday
attempting to knock down numerous press reports, the NATO leadership
said its operation in Brcko was in support of U.N. police monitors'
inspections of police stations. But U.N. officials denied they had
agreed to go along with NATO's predawn raids.

 &UR; First Lady Is Slated to Attend Princess Diana's Funeral (Edgartown) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass.  &MD;  First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend
the funeral of Princess Diana in recognition of the Clintons' personal
relationship with her and their admiration for her humanitarian work,
the White House said Tuesday.
<p>
   ``She will not be representing the government officially, but she
will certainly take the condolences of her husband, the president, and
we fully expect the American people will believe that she will be
passing along the American public's condolences,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on Martha's Vineyard, where the
first family is vacationing.
<p>
   The first lady received a personal invitation Tuesday from Diana's
family, the Spencers, as well as from the British royal family,
Lockhart said.
<p>
   President Clinton was not invited to the Saturday funeral because
of the unofficial nature of the service, Lockhart said. Neither the
U.S. government nor other foreign governments will send official
delegations, because it will not be a state funeral, he said.
<p>
   The only other U.S. government official known to be attending the
service is William J. Crowe, the ambassador to Britain and former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
<p>
   The decision for Hillary Clinton to attend the funeral was made
after consultations involving the White House, the U.S. Embassy, the
royal family and the Spencer family.
<p>
   The first lady plans to arrive in London on Saturday morning and
leave soon after the funeral, which will be held at Westminster Abbey.
The president is expected to remain on Martha's Vineyard to complete
his three-week vacation.
<p>
   Lockhart said the two women's relationship was close because of the
``confluence of interests between the first lady and the late Princess
Diana,'' particularly their mutual interest in helping children and
people suffering from breast cancer and AIDS.
<p>
   In a condolence letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
President Clinton said: ``We fondly recall her last visit to the White
House in June when she met with Hillary. The British people, indeed
all of us, have lost a friend and a strong voice for those less
fortunate.''
<p>
   Other condolence letters  &MD;  which were sent by diplomatic cable to
Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and Diana's family  &MD;  were not made
public.
<p>
   Although she was no longer an official member of the royal family,
Diana had received regal treatment during visits to the White House
both earlier this summer and in September 1996.
<p>
   A year ago, Hillary Clinton hosted an elegant breakfast in the
White House East Room to launch a fund-raising drive to fight breast
cancer. Diana was honorary chairwoman of the effort.
<p>
   During the event, Hillary Clinton praised the princess for her
humanitarian efforts. ``She is a woman who has had a tireless
commitment to the homeless, AIDS, cancer, leprosy and other health
issues, and we are so pleased that she is lending her support to this
continuing fight against breast cancer,'' the first lady said.
<p>
   On her latest trip to Washington, on June 18, Diana met privately
with Hillary Clinton during a visit to the White House. She was in
Washington to endorse an effort to bring about a worldwide ban on land
mines and heighten public awareness of the devastation they cause.

   TUZLA, Bosnia  &MD;  U.S. troops ended a tense standoff and relinquished
control of a key television tower near here Tuesday after Bosnian Serb
hard-liners agreed to halt anti-Western broadcasts and open the
airwaves to one hour daily of differing views.

   The effect of the move was to return control of the facility  &MD;  and
of the airwaves in eastern part of the Bosnian Serb Republic  &MD;  to
allies of Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war crimes suspect who
Washington says is the main stumbling block to implementing the
U.S.-brokered 1995 peace plan for Bosnia. Government-controlled
television is a critical pillar of political power for Karadzic and
his supporters, who are fiercely opposed to the integrated,
multiethnic Bosnia laid out in the peace plan.
<p>
   The nearly 300 American troops, who seized control of the
transmission relay tower Thursday, withdrew at daybreak after being
harassed by a mob of Serbs for about 20 hours. The withdrawal came
several hours after a U.S. military spokesman said the Americans would
not be dislodged until it was determined which political faction in
the Serb half of Bosnia  &MD;  Karadzic's or that of his rival, Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic  &MD;  had the rightful claim to the
facility.
<p>
   That determination was never made. Instead, Western officials
acknowledged, they returned the TV tower to Karadzic's camp to defuse
as quickly as possible a potentially dangerous confrontation.
<p>
   The deal they struck overnight, approved Tuesday morning by the
supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S. Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark, was
immediately controversial.
<p>
   Some Western officials and other observers called the U.S.
withdrawal a sign of weakness and a victory for Karadzic. They said
they doubted the Serbs would fulfill the spirit of the accord and
refashion their broadcasts along pluralist lines, and expressed worry
that the deal would undercut Plavsic. Plavsic, who supports the peace
plan, has been gaining power in the western part of the Serb Republic
with help from Washington and its European allies; Karadzic and his
allies have their power base in the republic's eastern half.
<p>
   ``What (the NATO-led force) has actually done is to give back the
means of indoctrination in a very key region'' to Karadzic, said Chris
Bennett, a political analyst with the International Crisis Group, a
private research organization here. ``We've done Plavsic no favors in
this agreement.''
<p>
   Others defended the deal, saying it calmed a touchy situation and
was the best the West could do short of shutting down the tower, a
move that many regarded as akin to censorship.
<p>
   They said the accord could give the West added leverage over Serb
broadcasts, noting that if the Serbs do not live up to it, U.S. troops
in the area are prepared to seize control of the tower again. NATO's
policymaking body, the North Atlantic Council, agreed Saturday to
authorize peacekeepers in Bosnia ``to go ahead and take actions that
are necessary to, as it says, suspend or curtail programming that is
hostile to the spirit of the Dayton accords,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kevin Bacon said in Washington.
<p>
   The Serbs ``agreed on something, and we can use it to our
advantage,'' said Ambassador Gert Wagner, a top deputy at the Office
of the High Representative, which is charged with implementing the
civilian parts of the peace plan brokered in Dayton, Ohio, nearly two
years ago. ``We'll have influence on their programming in a way we've
never had before.''
<p>
   Said a Western official preparing for municipal elections in Bosnia
scheduled for this month: ``The alternative was to do something much
more radical''  &MD;  such as shutting down the tower or jamming
transmissions  &MD;  ``that could have had a very negative effect on the
elections.''
<p>
   The official added that an attempt by NATO to close TV studios and
transmission facilities would likely be opposed by Karadzic's
hard-liners. ``We could have had people killed,'' she said. ``I don't
know this is the time we want body bags going home.''
<p>
   Karadzic's allies  &MD;  based in the village of Pale, the seat of the
Bosnian Serb government  &MD;  threatened to boycott the local elections,
which have already been scheduled and postponed twice.
<p>
   Most Western officials want to see Plavsic in control of all
broadcasting in the Serb Republic; she currently holds sway only in
the western half. But awarding her control of the transmitter seized
by U.S. troops last week near the town of Udrigova was not a realistic
option. Since police in the area remain loyal to Karadzic, she could
not have held it.
<p>
   Tuesday's agreement was negotiated in late-night telephone
bargaining between Jacques Klein, a retired U.S. Air Force general and
a senior Western mediator for Bosnia, and Momcilo Krajisnik, a top
Karadzic aide who is the Serbs' representative on Bosnia's collective
federal presidency.
<p>
   The hard-line Serb media agreed not to air ``inflammatory''
anti-Western reports and to devote one hour daily in prime time to
``other political views.'' Such views were not defined.
<p>
   The Serbs also agreed to grant Carlos Westendorp, the chief Western
mediator for Bosnia, a half-hour of air time in the coming days,
without cuts or commentary, to explain recent clashes between NATO
forces and demonstrators. &QL;

 &UR; Sotheby's Postpones Auction of Duke of Windsor Items &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   It was expected to be the sale of the century  &MD;  Sotheby's auction
next week of the contents of the Paris residence of the duke of
Windsor (for 11 months, he was Edward VIII, king of England) and
Wallis Warfield Simpson (the twice-divorced American for whom he gave
up the throne on Dec. 10, 1936). But Sotheby's announced Tuesday that,
following the weekend deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed, the
auction is being postponed.
<p>
   The connection: Fayed's father, Mohammed Fayed, owner of Harrods in
London and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, also owns the contents of the
Windsors' Bois de Boulogne residence. It was Mohammed Fayed who had
decided last year to sell the 40,000 items  &MD;  the proceeds were to have
gone to charity  &MD;  and it was Fayed who, along with Sotheby's
officials, decided this was not a moment for commerce.
<p>
   ``I will never be able to reconcile myself to the needless and
cruel deaths of two people who were so vibrant, generous and full of
life: God took their souls to live together in paradise. Now they have
peace,'' Fayed said in a statement issued through Sotheby's. ``As a
mark of respect, I believe there should be an appropriate interval
before the auction takes place.''
<p>
   Fayed has made no other public statement on the death of his oldest
son. He bought the Windsor home from the Pasteur Institute, which had
inherited the mansion from the duchess upon her death in 1986.
<p>
   The collection, which includes 10,000 photos of the royal family
dating back to 1860, is valued at between $5 million and $7 million.
<p>
   Although no date has been set, Sotheby's has a full fall auction
schedule, which means the Windsor sale will likely be delayed until
early 1998.

 &UR; Mourners Fill Condolence Books With Thoughts of Diana (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  Carl Davies brought memories, a message  &MD;  and pain killers
 &MD;  to make his mark on British history. Doreen King came with a single
red rose and a poem. Linda McAdam brought two pre-schoolers and tears
she couldn't staunch.
<p>
   Across Britain, along country lanes and in the palace where she
lies guarded by a single Redcoat in a bearskin hat, an astonishing
national lament swelled Tuesday for Diana, princess of Wales.
<p>
   Even the British themselves seemed surprised to discover the depth
and the scope of their emotions. The character-defining stiff upper
lip seemed suddenly as dated as the empire.
<p>
   At Kensington Palace, where Diana lived, more than 100,000 people
came again Tuesday, adding to an ocean of blossoms that spilled along
nearby pathways.
<p>
   At St. James Palace, the number of condolence books overseen by
ushers in top hats was increased from four to 15. The palace is open
around the clock; no matter.
<p>
   Overnight Monday, Julian McLean joined the line at 1:30 a.m. and
walked into the Long Corridor at the palace to sign his name at 7 a.m.
``It was very cold and very subdued throughout the night. I did it
because I will never get a chance to do this again,'' McLean said.
<p>
   Nonplussed planners now believe that as many as 2 million people
will jam into the restricted area of London through which Diana's
coffin will be carried to Westminster Abbey for her funeral at 11 a.m.
Saturday. After the service, her casket will be driven under escort to
her family's home about 80 miles northwest of London.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Most shops, restaurants and museums will be closed Saturday, and
the country will officially observe a minute of silence when the
service ends around 11:45.
<p>
   Queen Elizabeth and her family, including Diana's sons Prince
William, 15, and Prince Harry, 12, will travel to London for the
funeral from their vacation home at Balmoral Castle in the Scottish
Highlands, where they have remained in seclusion.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the Palace announced that a foundation will be
established to accept gifts in Diana's honor and distribute them among
charities that she supported.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Until the funeral, Diana's body will continue to lie in a
flag-draped coffin before the altar in the Chapel Royal at the
turreted palace that was the London home of Britain's rulers until
they moved to Buckingham Palace.
<p>
   In the low, stone Palace of St. James, built in the 16th century by
Henry VIII, the long wait ends for mourners when they are ushered
through a side door and into a solemn and still room where blank-paged
notebooks sit on on tables covered by black cloths.
<p>
   Mourners may write as much as they like. They stay as long as they
need to in the long room. About 300 people sign every hour, a palace
spokesman said. Eventually, the books will go to the palace, and then
for preservation in national archives.
<p>
   After about two hours in line with as much still to endure, Carl
Davies, 62, leaned heavily on a sturdy wooden cane. His arthritis was
killing him, but it was a familiar devil, and he had brought pills.
<p>
   It was memory that impelled him uncomfortably out into the crowd,
said Davies, a memory from the '80s when Diana was newly married and
he was director of a psychiatric hospital in Epsom.
<p>
   ``I shook her hand and she was charming, but it was the patients
she was most concerned with. That's what struck me,'' Davies
remembered. ``She was wearing green that day, and there was a woman in
a wheelchair who said to her `That's my favorite color,' and Diana
replied, bending down to speak at the level of the woman `I wore it
just for you.' And when a patient admired her bouquet, she plucked a
flower from it and gave it to her. Some of the patients had never
known such joy and comfort.''
<p>
   At last reaching a book of condolence, Davies wrote, ``You will
always be `Her Royal Highness' to me.'' Diana officially lost the
title when she divorced Prince Charles last year.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Biochemist Doreen King carried a single red rose and inscribed in
the palace book a poem she had carefully typed out before leaving home
in Essex:
<p>
    &UR; Diana &LR; 
<p>
   Oh Princess Diana
<p>
   Now we have lost you.
<p>
   You shone like the sun
<p>
   In establishment's power.
<p>
   In our hearts we still see you
<p>
   In the Twentieth century  &MD; 
<p>
   The People's Queen  &MD;  you'll still be.
<p>
   ``She did so much good work. She stood for us, not just in Britain
but in all the world,'' King said.
<p>
   Linda McAdam emerged in tears from the palace pushing a 2 year old
in a stroller and holding the hand of 5-year-old Rikki. ``I'm afraid I
don't remember clearly what I wrote. I feel drained. The wait wasn't
bad; the kids were good. Diana was such a lovely person I felt I had
to come and ask why,'' she said.

 &UR; Village Fears Change Once Diana Is Buried There (Great Brington) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GREAT BRINGTON, England  &MD;  Shortly after Princess Diana buried her
father, Earl Spencer, inside the family chapel, an intruder scaled a
wrought iron fence, broke into the crypt and wrenched off the delicate
marble hands adorning an effigy to one of her ancestors.
<p>
   For 20 generations, members of the Spencer family have been buried
beneath a private chapel tucked in the corner of a 13th-century church
in this small hillside village. On that day five years ago, villagers
recalled Tuesday, they were incensed that someone vandalized the
monument to the very first earl ever buried there.
<p>
   But now many in this small, close-knit community, where the church
is left unlocked and unattended on most days, were wondering what
awaits their village when Princess Diana is buried here Saturday.
<p>
   In fact, many villagers, who initially welcomed ``Diana's
homecoming,'' began Tuesday to dread a transformation of their
picture-postcard village, dotted with thatched-roofed homes and just
two shops  &MD;  a pub and a post office-general store  &MD;  into a world-class
tourist destination.
<p>
   ``Everybody's initial reaction was, `Yes. This is the right place
for her to be,' '' said Christine Whiley, the village postmistress and
a 20-year resident of Great Brington. ``Then you start to think, `What
is this going to do to the village?' ''
<p>
   When Diana was killed in a car wreck in Paris early Sunday, the
royal family agreed to the request of her brother, the current Earl
Spencer, that his sister be buried inside the family chapel.
<p>
   After a public procession through the streets of London Saturday
and a televised funeral in Westminster Abbey, Diana will be brought
here, 60 miles north of London, for a private burial.
<p>
   She will be laid to rest inside the church, St. Mary the Virgin,
with its Norman-style tower and prominent position overlooking acres
of rolling farmland. Mourners Tuesday crowded inside, where there is
room for only 200 worshipers, to leave flowers at the gate of the
Spencer crypt for a second day. And villagers grew increasingly
worried.
<p>
   ``We will all work together,'' the priest's wife, Jean MacPherson,
told parishioners who went to the rectory Tuesday to express concern
about the future of the community.
<p>
   ``Worst-case scenario, we'll lock it up until we can figure out
what to do,'' the vicar, David MacPherson, said.
<p>
   Diana spent most of her childhood, from 6 through 17, living in the
family compound of Althorp, a 600-acre estate that is adjacent to, but
technically not part of, Great Brington. The home she grew up in is
walled and gated, much like the palaces she lived in as an adult.
<p>
   As the daughter of an earl, third highest title in British peerage,
Diana was never, really, part of life in the village.
<p>
   ``One or two people here knew the princess personally, and they
have been devastated,'' the vicar said during the first service after
the death.
<p>
   But the Spencer family has for hundreds of years been an integral
part of life in the region. The church alone is decorated with 400
copies of the Spencer coat of arms, which reads ``Dieu Defend Le
Droit,'' or ``God Defends the Just.'' Before World War II, most of the
villagers worked on farms controlled or run by the Spencer family.
After the war, the Spencers began selling off land and the character
of the population changed.
<p>
   ``We moved from a rural community based on farming to a population
that is largely commuting, largely professional, largely middle
class,'' said Dr. Stephen Mattingly, a retired physician who recently
published a book about the history of the region.
<p>
   Still, the community where Diana will be laid to rest has retained
some of the character and feel of a place lost in time. The population
of 450 includes the residents of another village and a hamlet within
the parish.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   There also is the character of the community: A handwritten sign
posted on the church door Tuesday read: ``There will be no Sunday tea
served on September 7th due to a village trip.''
<p>
   The only public restrooms in the village, situated inside the pub,
are marked ``Farmers'' and ``Milkmaids.''
<p>
   And everyone knows everyone.
<p>
   ``It is a very quiet, lovely community,'' said Deborah Sampson, a
resident of a nearby village, as she strolled across the unmowed
cemetery behind the church Tuesday morning.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Publicly, the villagers are generally cautious not to express too
great an alarm over the future of their community. Mattingly, for
example, said they are accustomed to getting many visitors, as many as
3,000 a year, because George Washington's
great-great-great-grandfather is buried beneath the church.
<p>
   But as cars choked the single street that runs through the middle
of town Tuesday, one man just shook his head. ``These poor people,''
said Adrian Bawl, a resident of Northampton, a nearby city of about
300,000. ``The village will never be the same.''

 &UR; Seat Belts Might Have Saved Diana &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Seat belts and shoulder harnesses might have saved them.
<p>
   That is the educated guess of U.S. and European auto safety experts
examining available information on the Paris car crash that killed
Princess Diana and two others Sunday.
<p>
   The high-speed slam into a concrete pillar and walls inside a
tunnel in central Paris demolished the Mercedes-Benz S280 sedan in
which Diana was riding in the back seat with her companion, Dodi
Fayed, who died at the scene.
<p>
   Also killed was the car's driver, Henri Paul, who allegedly was
intoxicated. The lone survivor was Diana's bodyguard, Trevor
Reese-Jones.
<p>
   All of the dead reportedly were unbelted. Reese-Jones was belted
and was protected by the S280's front-passenger air bag.
<p>
   Conceding that, for the moment, their comments are based on
hunches, several auto safety experts said Tuesday that Diana and Fayed
might have lived if they had been belted.
<p>
   ``They were sitting in the back seat, farthest from the point of
the initial impact,'' said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety. ``Usually the back seat is the safest
seat  &MD;  if you are wearing seat belts.''
<p>
   French police would not confirm reports that Diana, Fayed and Paul
were unbelted. But if the reports are true, that failure probably
contributed to their deaths, O'Neill said.
<p>
   ``We know that the impact speed with the post was survivable
because the bodyguard survived,'' British road safety expert Richard
Cuerden told Reuter. ``We expect that people in the rear have as good
a chance, if not better, of making it.''
<p>
   It's a simple matter of physics, said William Boehly, an auto
safety engineer and former administrator of vehicle safety research
and development at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
<p>
   A body at rest tends to remain at rest. A body in motion tends to
remain in motion. Auto crashes are horrific stoppers of motion. And
each crash usually involves a three-in-one collision, Boehly said.
<p>
   There is the initial crash of car into object. There is the
secondary crash of occupant into objects within the car, a collision
that could be fatal if the occupant is unbelted. And there is the
collective third crash of organs banging against one another and
against bone structures within the occupant's body.
<p>
   The inner-body collision, too, is worsened by the severity of the
blows to an unbelted occupant striking structures within the car,
O'Neill and Boehly said.
<p>
   ``I'm presuming that Princess Di went flying into the back of the
front seat so hard it caused massive chest injuries,'' said O'Neill,
whose institute routinely studies such accidents.
<p>
   It's possible to design a car to withstand the reported crash speed
of 100 mph that ended Diana's life, O'Neill said.
<p>
   ``But that kind of crash is exceedingly rare. It would be foolish
to design for that kind of crash because of the trade-offs'' in costs
and safety that would accompany such a design, he said.
<p>
   New cars sold in the United States must meet a 30-mph,
fixed-barrier crash standard set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. That means unbelted occupants within the car
should be able to survive a 30-mph crash into a wall.
<p>
   That kind of crash is roughly equivalent to a car dropping head
first from a three-story building, with each story being 10 feet high,
Boehly said. By comparison, Diana's crash was ``the equivalent of a
30-story head-first drop,'' he said.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Sarah Ferguson's new ads for Weight Watchers had all
the makings of a stupendously successful campaign save one: good
timing.
<p>
   Thursday, to kick off the multimillion-dollar effort, Weight
Watchers mailed out tens of thousands of brochures featuring the
Duchess of York saying that losing weight is ``harder than outrunning
the paparazzi.''
<p>
   When the death of Princess Diana instantly made the phrase
offensive, the diet program's execs scrambled to pull television and
print ads. ``It's a tragic irony that the advertising campaign
commenced on the same day as this awful accident,'' said Jeffrey
Schneider, spokesman for the Duchess of York, the former sister-in-law
of Princess Diana. He said Ferguson was ``absolutely devastated'' by
her longtime friend's death. Howard Rubenstein, whose public relations
firm represents both the duchess and Weight Watchers, added that
Fergie is ``very, very concerned about the well-being of Princess Di's
children.''
<p>
   The duchess canceled a luncheon and news conference that were
supposed to be held Wednesday in New York's Rainbow Room and was
flying to London for Saturday's funeral. The campaign will be reworked
and relaunched ``at an appropriate time in the future,'' Schneider
said.
<p>
   Some TV ads did run, and Glamour and Self magazines went to print
with the paparazzi line in the ads, said Rubenstein.
<p>
   It's not the first time a marketing slogan has been swept away by
current events. In October 1995, after O.J. Simpson was acquitted of
murder, Mars Inc. pulled ads for its Starburst candies that declared
``the juice is loose'' and ``turn loose the juice.''
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   ``This was the ultimate Basque celebration,'' said Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., of his wedding to Rhonda Carmony. ``However, I
refused to allow sheep testicles on the menu.''
<p>
   Carmony, his campaign manager, was covered in tulle for the
noontime Catholic ceremony two weeks ago in a 12th-century stone
church in a small town in the French Pyrenees. Afterward, the
congressman donned a beret.
<p>
   The reception featured traditional Basque fare of sangria, pheasant
and wild boar and ``almost as many toasts to Ronald Reagan as to the
bride and groom,'' said one guest. The wedding cake, similar to the
French
 &UR; croquembouche &LR; , was described by the groom as tasting like ``doughnuts
filled with cream.'' Carmony has Basque relatives in both Spain and
France. Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican
Policy Committee, was one of the 60 guests.
<p>
   Carmony, 27, is not totally in the clear on felony counts of
election fraud in a Republican state assembly race. A four-week trial
held earlier this year resulted in a hung jury, and a mistrial was
declared. A new trial is scheduled for Dec. 1.
<p>
   ``She's still got some legal hurdles to jump,'' the 50-year-old
Rohrabacher said Tuesday from California. ``But we're confident that
if it goes to trial again we'll be successful.''
<p>
   For their honeymoon, the newlywed surfers tied their boards to the
top of their rental car and cruised the coasts of Spain and Portugal.
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   White House social secretary Ann Stock, who resigns this month, is
gliding on over to the Kennedy Center for a new job. ``It's an odd
title  &MD;  the vice president of institutional relations,'' she said.
``It means all of their special events, the office of protocol, board
relations and press relations. Oh, and being in charge of all the gift
shops. It takes in all the things that I am interested in, and I'm
excited.''
<p>
   KenCen President Larry Wilker said Stock will be working to raise
the national profile of the performing arts giant, which has programs
and productions in all 50 states. ``We feel very lucky and very
honored to be able to attract her.''
<p>
   Some of Stock's relationships with board members are quite well
developed: She and Chairman Jim Johnson have been close friends since
working together on Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign.
<p>
   The new gig brings more money. ``Oh, boy  &MD;  anything would be a
raise,'' Stock said. ``Remember my salary: The more you work, the less
I make. I make about 89 cents an hour.'' &QL;

 &UR; Highly Trained Security Would Have Avoided Accident, Expert Says &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Princess Diana would still be alive if she had allowed Scotland
Yard to protect her, an international security consultant said
Tuesday.
<p>
   ``The accident was completely avoidable,'' said Robert L. Oatman,
speaking from London. Oatman, whose main office is in Towson, Md.,
arrived from Paris a day before the fatal high-speed crash in a
Seine-side tunnel that killed Diana; her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed,
<p>
   and chauffeur Henri Paul, who French authorities say was drunk at
the wheel.
<p>
   Although Diana used Scotland Yard's highly trained Royalty
Protection Group when she was with her sons, Princes William, 15, and
Harry, 12, she refused it in her private capacity in her determination
to be independent from the royal family since her divorce from Prince
Charles last year.
<p>
   ``It never would have happened if she had not done that,'' Oatman
said. ``The driver would have been stone sober and he would have been
a skilled professional. The RPG is the best in the world, they're a
model to be around.
<p>
   ``The close-in protection officer would have had her interests
first in mind, he wouldn't have jeopardized her life under any
circumstances. He would have automatically requested help from French
police, who don't tolerate this (paparazzi) nonsense.''
<p>
   In the fatal accident, it appears that the private security
officers around Diana and Fayed broke the basic rules of automobile
security, said Oatman, who has been conferring with French and British
security specialists to promote his new book, ``The Art of Executive
Protection,'' which includes a chapter on automobile security.
<p>
   The area of the tunnel in central Paris where the crash occurred is
heavily policed, said Oatman, 49, who retired eight years ago as chief
of detectives in the Baltimore County Police Department to form his
executive-security agency.
<p>
   Oatman has trained more than 1,000 executive-security specialists
for such companies as Disney, General Motors, Exxon and Federal
Express.
<p>
   Scotland Yard had expressed concern at Diana's decision to abandon
its protection and members of Parliament Tuesday raised questions
about her protection.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Peter Luff, a Conservative member of Parliament, said, ``The
question that needs to be asked is how the mother of a future king was
allowed to be driven by someone over the limit. It is all very well to
protect people from the IRA, but we should be able to protect them
also from being driven by drunkards, a much more mundane but, as it
turned out, fatal threat.''
<p>
   Why didn't Diana have proper protection ``is one of those questions
which we will not get an answer to,'' said Lawrie Quinn, a Labor
member of Parliament.
<p>
   Without official protection, Oatman said, Diana was bound to find
herself eventually in the hands of people unequipped to handle such a
highly charged situation.
<p>
   The reported circumstances of the chase from the Ritz Hotel to the
crash in the tunnel make it appear that Paul was virtually challenging
the pursuing motorcycle-borne paparazzi, Oatman said.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   ``They should never have gone to the speeds they did. The security
officer in the passenger seat should have telephoned to the police
that they were being chased by motorcycles and that he had Princess
Diana in the car. The police would have been able to stop it,'' Oatman
said.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   The only survivor of the crash, Trevor Rees-Jones, another security
man, is still in intensive care in a Paris hospital with head and
internal injuries; he reportedly wore a seat belt. Rees-Jones, a
paratrooper who served two army tours in Northern Ireland, gained
experience working with military police as a close-protection guard
for VIPs who were possible terrorist targets.
<p>
   Investigators are awaiting Rees-Jones' description of events,
particularly of how a drunken man came to be at the wheel and why he
wasn't ordered to stop, or at least, to slow down.

 &UR; Editors: In 2nd graf, St. James's Palace is cq. &QL; 
 &UR; Diana's Funeral Procession Expected to Draw 1 Million (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  Buckingham Palace conceded Tuesday that it was caught off
guard by the massive and seemingly endless public display of grief for
Princess Diana.
<p>
   The first acknowledgment came in the early morning Tuesday, when
thousands of people continued to wait in line for up to seven hours to
sign five condolence books set up in the lobby of St. James's Palace.
<p>
   Before the sun rose, the queen's staff increased the number of
condolence books to 15.
<p>
   ``Obviously, we didn't anticipate this,'' said a palace spokesman.
``We would have put more books out in the first place.''
<p>
   By midday, about 300 people an hour were signing the 15 condolence
books.
<p>
   But the backpedaling by the palace continued late into the day as a
controversy erupted over the relatively short one-mile route the
cortege will take on its way to Westminster Abbey for the funeral.
When Diana and Prince Charles were married, more than 1 million people
turned out to view the two-mile procession. With officials saying
Tuesday they expect the funeral to draw a crowd as large, if not
larger, they acknowledged that the likely congestion prompted concerns
for public safety.
<p>
   After defending the length of the route, and insisting it would not
be changed, the palace pointed out that spectators could also view the
casket after the service during its 60-mile-ride to the burial site in
Great Brington.
<p>
   ``When you think about it, the procession to Westminster Abbey is
just the first part,'' said the palace spokesman. ``After that, people
can see the casket in the car.''
<p>
   Asked if the casket would be carried in an open hearse, the
spokesman said: ``That detail hasn't been worked out yet.''
<p>
   The palace also said it was considering allowing people to stand in
the street, to make even more room.
<p>
   In response to growing public pressure for some kind of national
expression of grief, the palace announced late Tuesday that
immediately after the 11 a.m. funeral, expected to last no more than
50 minutes, there will be a formal minute of silence across Britain.
<p>
   The palace also said it plans to invite 500 representatives of the
charitable groups Diana worked with to participate in the procession.
Many are expected to be children and the disabled.
<p>
   Also announced Tuesday: an official charity fund in memory of the
princess, to be distributed to charities associated with her.
Administrators said checks should be made out to: ``The Diana,
Princess of Wales Memorial Fund'' and sent to Kensington Palace,
London, W8 4PU, United Kingdom. Messages of condolence can be sent to
the same address. The law firm representing Diana, Mishcon de Reya,
said donations to the fund could also be sent to: P.O. Box 1, London,
WC1B 5HW, United Kingdom.
<p>
   To further help satisfy the intense public interest in the funeral,
officials said they will allow television cameras in the church, as
well as closed-circuit cameras to broadcast to a large screen that
will be erected outside the Abbey. Speakers also will be set up in the
street outside the service.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   The controversy over details of the funeral, most of which have
been eclipsed by the expressions of grief, began with the decision not
to give Princess Diana a state funeral, which entails a public viewing
and public burial.
<p>
   While Princess Diana was technically no longer royalty, because of
her divorce last year from Prince Charles, public sentiment was strong
for full state obsequies. Instead, the palace crafted what it called a
``unique funeral for a unique person,'' that included elements of the
state funeral.

 &UR; Walters, Downs to Co-Anchor Thursday `20/20' (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  ABC News finally got around to announcing Tuesday that
Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs will co-anchor the new Thursday edition
of ``20/20'' starting Sept. 11.
<p>
   The Friday edition starring Babs and Hugh returns for a new season
the next evening.
<p>
   The first edition of ``20/20'' premiered on a Tuesday in 1978; the
next year the show moved to Thursday and it became a Friday fixture 10
Septembers ago.
<p>
   Downs joined the program as sole anchor  &MD;  saved it, some say  &MD;  on
June 13, 1978, the week after a disastrous premiere anchored by Harold
Hayes and Robert Hughes. They were cashiered almost immediately by an
embarrassed Roone Arledge, then the new president of ABC News.
<p>
   Walters came on board as co-host in September 1984.
<p>
   ``I'm just delighted Hugh and I are both doing it,'' she said
Tuesday, adding that she and Downs ``had a warm hug'' earlier in the
day after Hugh signed, as Barbara had earlier, an extension of their
current contracts. ``I wouldn't want to do the show without him,'' she
added.
<p>
   Walters would not discuss terms of the extensions but said both she
and Downs ``hope to stay for the duration.''
<p>
   There had been some speculation that Walters/Downs might share the
second night anchor chores with others as the broadcast year went on
but that apparently isn't going to happen  &MD;  at least not this first
season as ABC News hopes to make inroads into NBC's Thursday night
audience.
<p>
   Aware that the new ``20/20'' is up against NBC's top-rated ``ER''
in the 10 o'clock timeslot, Walters said, ``We're all predicting a
long climb'' to ratings parity. She expects that ``over time there'll
be an audience for us out there.''
<p>
   She dismissed suggestion that the new lineup of ``PrimeTime Live''
on Wednesdays plus ``20/20'' on each of the next two nights was
borrowing a page from NBC News's successful package of four
``Datelines'' a week.
<p>
   `` `Dateline' was copied from us,'' she pointed out.
<p>
   Walters will co-anchor this Friday's edition of ``20/20'' from
London, where she's flying Wednesday as she and Peter Jennings prepare
to cover the funeral of Princess Diana on Saturday.
<p>
   After checking with executive producer Victor Neufeld, Walters said
next week's debut will be ``a normal show'' with, so far anyway, no
special guests to hype the premiere.
<p>
   She also said Elizabeth Vargas, who is now principally assigned to
``PrimeTime Live,'' will contribute to the Thursday edition, along
with other members of the ``20/20'' correspondents team: Bob Brown,
Arnold Diaz, Deborah Roberts, Tom Jarriel, Lynn Sherr and John
Stossel, plus chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross.
<p>
    &UR; -O- &QC; 
<p>
   Joan Lunden, who has co-hosted ABC's ``Good Morning America'' since
1980, is stepping down after Friday morning's broadcast but she isn't
sure what the farewell broadcast, sure to be stuffed with tributes,
will bring.
<p>
   ``It's somewhat of a secret,'' she said Tuesday. ``I don't really
know. There's no script and it's kind of nice to have it that way.''
<p>
   Co-host Charlie Gibson, who was in London earlier in the week
covering the Princess Diana story, will be in New York to help with
auld lang syne.
<p>
   Lunden, of course, is not saying goodbye to ABC News. She has five
prime-time specials for the network scheduled over the next 18 months
 &MD;  ``certainly a body of work to do''  &MD;  and she says, ``To be honest,
I've been incredibly consumed with planning the next leg of this
journey for me.''
<p>
   The third year of her current three-year contract, which she signed
in February, is ``theoretically'' an option year for both her and the
network and Lunden is frank to admit she's been listening.
<p>
   ``I'm not making any decisions at this time,'' she said, ``but
gratefully I've had a number of inquiries. I don't know what all I'm
going to be doing and, oh, yeah, I'm going to be taking some time
off.''
<p>
   Tacitly responding to tabloid suggestions she's been booted from
the network show, which has slipped far behind NBC's ``Today'' show in
the past 20 months, Lunden said, ``I'm in awe of the fact I've stayed
on this schedule (of 3:30 a.m. wake-up calls) for 20 years, since I
started as a substitute anchor on GMA.
<p>
   ``The schedule is grueling and in the last couple of contract
negotiations I told them I wanted to move on. But they weren't ready.
But they knew this last contract how much I needed a change.
<p>
   ``I need normalcy in my life as a mother of children 17, 14 and 10
years old; they're not going to be children much longer. I want to be
there with them when they wake up in the morning.''
<p>
   ``I love the show; it's a wonderful show, ABC and Charlie and the
staff have afforded me the most extraordinary privilege and it's with
sadness I'm leaving those I've worked with.
<p>
   ``As wonderful as it's been, I'll be frank, I'm excited and
intrigued by whatever the future may bring.''
<p>
   Responding again to the questions she's been repeatedly asked in
recent weeks, Lunden said, ``Have I been offered several sitcoms? Yes.
Have I been offered 20 magazine programs? Yes. Am I continuing those
conversations? Yes. Am I taking acting lessons? Yes. And I'm also
taking an oriental-cooking class. I'm going to go (to other career
choices) prepared. . .
<p>
   ``I'm in a rare position, I'm benefiting from years and years of
hard labor. Perhaps I'll be remaking my career. If I put my toe in the
water it's because I find that it'll be an incredible opportunity. But
whether it's going to lead anywhere I don't know.''

 &UR; Memorial for Cold War Espionage Vets &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   If Vietnam veterans have felt invisible because their war was
unpopular, Cold War espionage veterans have been invisible because
their conflict was, except for the rhetoric, fought in utter secrecy.
<p>
   Consider the aerial reconnaissance specialists who flew over the
Soviet Union and China during the 1950s, '60s and '70s: They couldn't
breathe a word of their missions to wives or loved ones, and when they
disappeared, relatives never quite knew what happened to them, whether
they were dead or alive or if their endeavors had been worth the
terrible price they paid.
<p>
   ``I continued to hope he was alive. ... I have written to every
administration since I first got the telegram, trying to get some
answers,'' said Teresa Durkin, of Levittown, Pa., whose brother,
Master Sgt. George P. Petrochilos was one of 17 crew members of a
C-130A aircraft shot down in 1958 over Soviet Armenia.
<p>
   But Durkin and other relatives of Cold War-era reconnaissance
veterans found a measure of closure and relief as they attended an
emotional ceremony Tuesday near the National Security Agency in
Maryland, dedicating the Aerial Reconnaissance Memorial and National
Vigilance Park.
<p>
   In a public gathering unusual for the highly secretive agency,
about 2,000 people gathered to watch NSA officials recognize ``those
who served in silence.''
<p>
   ``We are taking a major step to publicly recognize and remember the
sacrifices and dedication of aerial reconnaissance servicemen and
women from all branches of the armed forces,'' said Lt. Gen. Kenneth
A. Minihan, director of the NSA.
<p>
   The centerpiece of the memorial is C-130 aircraft refurbished to
resemble the C-130A, which in 1958 strayed inadvertently into Soviet
airspace and was shot down. Surrounding the memorial on Route 32, just
east of the Interstate 295 interchange in Anne Arundel County, Md.,
are 18 trees  &MD;  each symbolizing a type of reconnaissance aircraft lost
during the Cold War.
<p>
   A plaque on the grassy site pays tribute both to ``the 17 airmen
who perished that day'' and to ``their armed forces compatriots who
were killed, injured, taken prisoner or unaccounted for in other
incidents while performing a mission vital to America's security.''
<p>
   The NSA estimates that 152 intelligence specialists, from all
branches of the armed services, died during the Cold War, at least
one-third of them during aerial reconnaissance missions. It is unclear
how many others  &MD;  pilots or others supplying support services  &MD;  lost
their lives in Cold War espionage.
<p>
   Some at the ceremony wept or covered their eyes during the
emotional ceremonies, which included a mournful bagpipe dirge and a
``missing man formation'' flown by the Maryland Air National Guard's
135th Airlift Squadron.
<p>
   ``I lost my best friend, Harry Camps,'' said Lincoln Gilbert, who
was a Serbo-Croatian linguist serving in the same unit as the men who
died in the 1958 incident.
<p>
   After a speaker read the names of the 17 men on board, including
six whose bodies were never found, they were posthumously awarded the
Air Medal. Family members accepted the medals and memorial flags.
<p>
   ``These gallant warriors were engaged in Cold War intelligence
operations absolutely crucial to the security of the United States of
America and the Free World,'' their dedication read, in part.
<p>
   Like most of the other family members present, Durkin was never
quite sure what her brother was doing but guessed it might be
espionage.
<p>
   ``My husband used to tease him all the time, saying if they ever
throw you off the back of the Orient Express, don't expect us to come
get you,'' Durkin said after the ceremony, her eyes still wet. Durkin
kept all the letters and documents she ever received about her
brother's disappearance. The National Cryptologic Museum, which is
adjacent to the park, has a display that includes her nearly
40-year-old letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, saying that he
was unable to obtain any information on the 1958 incident from Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev.
<p>
    &UR; -(optional trim to end)- &QC; 
<p>
   Some family members seemed resentful that it had taken the
government this long to honor those who had fallen.
<p>
   ``How could they not be bitter?'' said Robert Byrne, who flew in
the same unit as the 17 who were lost. Others complained of the
still-unanswered questions. The Department of Defense has said that
declassified Soviet documents released by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin show that all crew members aboard perished. But even the
program for Tuesday's ceremony noted that ``the Pentagon's Office of
POW/MIA affairs is still investigating this case.''
<p>
   But even if the dedication of the park was largely a symbolic
gesture, some in attendance viewed it as a worthwhile first step.
<p>
   ``It's important symbolism  &MD;  bringing this work out into the open,
recognizing it,'' said Larry Tart, a retired Air Force sergeant and
Russian linguist who flew reconnaissance missions and was the prime
lobbyist for the memorial. Since Tart, of State College, Pa., began
researching these matters, family members have thanked him.
<p>
   ``Growing up, I thought my dad was doing something dirty,'' one
woman told him.``But now I'm proud of him; I know he was doing
something important.''

 &UR; Albert Defense Seeks Dismissal, Citing &QL; 
 &UR; Juror-Prosecutor Link &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ARLINGTON, Va.  &MD;  Lawyers for NBC sportscaster Marv Albert Tuesday
asked a judge to dismiss sexual assault charges against Albert because
one of the grand jurors who indicted him managed the 1995 election
campaign of Arlington's chief prosecutor.
<p>
   Albert's lawyers also want the judge to declare Virginia's sodomy
law an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, an attack that could have
broad consequences if it moves up through local and federal courts,
privacy experts said.
<p>
   The constitutional challenge also paves the way for the
sportscaster to argue that he had consensual sexual contact with the
woman from Vienna, Va., who says he bit her and forced her to have
oral sex in an Arlington hotel.
<p>
   Law professors and defense attorneys said Virginia and federal laws
are stacked against the Albert team's effort to get the indictment
thrown out based on an allegation of a possible conflict of interest
involving one of the six grand jurors. But some experts said the
challenge to the sodomy law could go much further because the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1986 ruling on Georgia's similar law is ripe for a
challenge.
<p>
   In motions unsealed Tuesday, Albert's lawyers, Roy Black and Peter
Greenspun, complained about Arlington's procedures for screening
potential grand jurors and about ``the obvious taint and impropriety
of including'' Amy Levine, who managed Commonwealth's Attorney Richard
E. Trodden's campaign. ``Such a close relationship . . . gives an
appearance of bias,'' they wrote.
<p>
   Levine and Margaret Levinson, another member of the grand jury that
indicted Albert on forcible sodomy and assault charges, both declined
to comment. Trodden's office also declined to comment, citing an
informal gag rule.
<p>
   But legal analysts said Virginia and federal laws make it very
difficult to get an indictment dismissed on the grounds that one juror
had a relationship with the prosecutor, in part because grand jury
decisions do not have to be unanimous.
<p>
   ``In Virginia, the grand jury is a giant rubber stamp, and a nick
in that stamp is not going to be a problem,'' defense attorney David
Baugh said.
<p>
   To succeed, Albert's lawyers ``would be required to go the
additional step and show that the relationship (between the juror and
Trodden) was responsible for the indictment,'' defense attorney Blair
Howard said. ``In small towns, there have to be grand jurors who know
prosecutors all the time.''
<p>
   The constitutional challenge to Virginia's sodomy law could be
crucial to Albert's defense if he chooses to argue that the sexual
contact was consensual. All oral sex is illegal in Virginia, and a
jury that votes against forcible sodomy still could find Albert guilty
of consensual sodomy.
<p>
   In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Georgia law, which
applies to heterosexuals and homosexuals, in Bowers vs. Hardwick, but
the written decision referred almost entirely to homosexuals, which
makes its application to heterosexual partners somewhat ambiguous,
experts said.
<p>
   ``An attack on sodomy laws . . . is not frivolous because of the
growing sensitivity to sexual privacy,'' said Rodney Smolla, a law
professor at the College of William and Mary.
<p>
   And George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley
said, ``If Virginia fought to protect the prohibition on heterosexual
sodomy . . . I believe they would not be able to eke out a 5-4
majority.''
<p>
   Of course, that's a long way off because Albert's case is still in
a local court, the analysts cautioned, but officials at the American
Civil Liberties Union's Virginia chapter said they've been looking for
a case to challenge the state sodomy law.
<p>
   The Albert team also asked Arlington Circuit Court Judge Benjamin
N.A. Kendrick to let them strike more jurors than usual and prevent
the prosecutor from running criminal checks on potential jurors.
Kendrick will hear the motions Thursday. &QL;

 &UR; Court Examines 7 Crash-Scene Photographers for Manslaughter (Paris) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS  &MD;  Photographers who snapped pictures of the dying Diana were
paraded in front of a French magistrate Tuesday and placed under
formal suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and of failing to come to
the aid of the mortally wounded princess.
<p>
   Two of the photographers, Romuald Rat of the Gamma photo agency and
Christian Martinez of Angeli, were ordered to post 100,000-franc
($16,400) bonds and were temporarily barred from exercising their
profession or leaving France.
<p>
   According to a source close to the case, Rat and Martinez were
among the first photographers to arrive after the high-speed crash of
Diana's limousine in a Paris tunnel, and instead of helping her,
``hindered the actions of rescuers.'' Prosecutors had asked the
magistrate, Investigating Judge Herve Stephan, to jail the two.
<p>
   While in custody, Rat reportedly told police he had taken the pulse
of the injured princess to see if she was dead.
<p>
   The suspects  &MD;  six photographers and an agency motorcycle driver  &MD; 
had been detained at the Palace of Justice in the heart of Paris since
Diana's death early Sunday morning. The offenses for which they are
being investigated  &MD;  ``involuntary homicide and wounding'' and
``non-assistance to a person in danger''  &MD;  both carry
three-to-five-year prison terms and large fines.
<p>
   Tuesday's decision provoked anger among many of the photographers'
colleagues and supporters, who claimed the men were only doing their
jobs by taking photos when the 36-year-old Diana's limousine hit a
concrete post, mortally wounding her and killing her rich suitor, Dodi
Fayed.
<p>
   ``If it's clear they (the suspects) don't want me to take their
pictures, I won't, out of professional solidarity,'' Aurelie Audureau,
a staff photographer for the newspaper Le Parisien, pledged as she
waited outside the Palace of Justice with 150 other journalists for
news of the detainees.
<p>
   William Bourdon, attorney for one of the suspects, Nicolas Arsov of
the Sipa agency, charged that French officials ``want to please public
opinion and the Quai d'Orsay (French Foreign Ministry).'' He said his
client and the others have become ``scapegoats'' for the sake of
``show-biz justice.''
<p>
   All seven men were freed Tuesday night after being quizzed, one by
one, by Stephan. In French legal jargon, the photographers were placed
``under examination.''
<p>
   The judge, after sifting testimony and evidence, will decide
whether to formally charge them and send them to a court for trial. It
is not clear whether the double-barreled charge submitted to the
magistrate by prosecutors applied to all seven, and there were reports
of disagreements over the charges between Stephan and prosecutors.
<p>
   The Mercedes-Benz in which Diana was riding, driven at high speed
by a Ritz Hotel security guard who official sources said Monday was
legally drunk, had been trailed by a number of photographers on
motorcycles after it left the Ritz. On Tuesday evening, the French
television channel TF1 reported that investigators had found no proof
the pursuing pack had interfered with the movements of the Mercedes.
<p>
   However, a police report leaked to the media said ``virulent''
photographers did hinder police trying to give the princess and other
passengers emergency aid after it crashed. ``You're pissing me off,''
one photographer reportedly shouted to one of the first officers to
arrive.
<p>
   The policeman, unable to ``contain the photographers and bring help
to the wounded,'' called for backup, the report said.
<p>
   Unlike the suspects examined Tuesday by Stephan, other
photographers present were able to get away with their film before
police could grab them and their cameras. Pro Sieben, a private German
television channel, said it would broadcast an interview with one of
them, a Frenchman, Wednesday. According to that photographer, who was
not identified, limo driver Henri Paul, 41, who also died in the
accident, exclaimed to photographers at one point before the crash,
``Tonight you won't catch us.''
<p>
   ``The car ran a red light at top speed and swayed several times,''
the photographer said in a summary of the interview. ``We were
following about 200 meters (yards) from the car; nobody was in
front.''
<p>
   ``When we heard the noise of the accident, we first thought of a
terrorist attack, because it sounded like the explosion of a bomb. In
the tunnel, it was a real massacre. In a state of shock, I pushed on
the button of my camera. I did not offer assistance. And then I
left.''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   The actions of some photographers have sparked intense criticism of
celebrity-chasing paparazzi in the press of France and elsewhere,
along with calls for tougher laws to protect privacy. A Danish
newspaper denounced Diana's pursuers as ``pigs,'' and Le Figaro, a
Paris daily, called them ``rats.''
<p>
   ``There are paparazzi, and there are photographers; one must not
confuse them,'' maintained Jean-Francois Leroy, director of a
photojournalism festival that opened last weekend in Perpignan, in
southern France.
<p>
   But the bosses of some of the suspects Tuesday strongly denied
their employees are money-hungry stalkers of movie stars, royals or
other celebrities. One detained photographer, Jacques Langevin, is a
photojournalist for the Sygma agency accredited to the French
presidential palace and a respected veteran of wars and unrest in
Rwanda, Zaire, and Romania, where he was wounded in 1989. Langevin
also took exclusive photos of the Chinese military crackdown on
students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
<p>
   ``He is everything but a paparazzo,'' Sygma editor-in-chief Thierry
Secretan said. After Diana and Fayed left the Ritz, Langevin went home
in his own car, coincidentally taking the same route, Secretan said.
<p>
   ``So he happened to be on the scene just as police arrived. He took
photos because that is his job, but he arrived on the scene several
minutes after the crash,'' the Sygma editor said.
<p>
   At Sipa, President Goksin Sipahioglu said Arsov was a general
assignment photographer who, six months ago, was promoted from his job
as motorcycle driver. He was not part of the mounted pack pursuing
Diana's car, Sipahioglu said, but arrived ``5-10 minutes'' after the
crash.
<p>
   ``Of course he took photos; that is his job,'' the Sipa chief said.
``We will not publish those photos, but if he had come back to the
agency and hadn't taken photos, I would have asked him why, of
course.''
<p>
   A medical source said Tuesday it could be ``many weeks'' before
Trevor Rees-Jones, the British bodyguard who was the sole survivor of
the crash, can help police or the investigating judge determine
exactly why Diana and the others died. A lawyer for Fayed's family
said Rees-Jones is now conscious and out of danger, but that his face
has been ``entirely crushed.''

 &UR; Testing of Kaczynski by Government Psychiatrist Sought (Sacramento) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif.  &MD;  Federal prosecutors contended Tuesday that a
government psychiatrist should be allowed to examine Unabomber suspect
Theodore J. Kaczynski to determine his mental condition.
<p>
   The request is in response to statements by lawyers for the former
University of California, Berkeley, mathematician, who have indicated
that they intend to seek testimony from their own experts about
Kaczynski's mental condition.
<p>
   In arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Garland E. Burrell
Jr., however, defense lawyers opposed the prosecution's request,
describing it as a violation of Kaczynski's Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
<p>
   Burrell took the arguments under submission. He did not indicate
when he will make a decision.
<p>
   Defense lawyers said they are willing to provide reports on their
client's mental condition by Nov. 3, just nine days before the trial
is scheduled to begin. Kaczynski's lawyers said they are not required
to make the material available any sooner.
<p>
   Kaczynski, 55, is charged with four bombings, including two blasts
in Sacramento  &MD;  one that killed a computer store owner in 1985 and one
that killed a timber industry executive in 1995. He has pleaded not
guilty.
<p>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Douglas Wilson told Burrell that
prosecutors do not want to wait until the eve of the trial to obtain
information about Kaczynski's mental state. He described it as ``too
late a date for us.''
<p>
   ``There is a wide range of mental disorders that could be at issue
here,'' Wilson said. ``We're asking for a simple and short statement
of the kind of disorder they seek to rely on. It doesn't have to be
detailed.''

 &UR; Gore Staff Saw Signs of Trouble Before &QL; 
 &UR; Temple Appearance (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The White House mounted a detailed defense Tuesday of
Vice President Al Gore and his appearance at a Buddhist temple
fund-raiser just two days before congressional hearings into campaign
finance improprieties enter a new stage with the spotlight focused
squarely on Gore.
<p>
   Officials released a series of internal memos, electronic messages
and briefing papers intended to prove that Gore was unaware at the
time that the 1996 luncheon at the Hsi Lai Temple in California was a
fund-raising event.
<p>
   But the documents offered ample evidence that, at a minimum, Gore's
staff ignored numerous warning signs that could have averted what has
become one of the major embarrassments of Gore's career. And one
e-mail message from Gore six weeks before the event made clear that he
expected to attend a Los Angeles fund-raiser on that date, although
aides said the temple was not the planned location at that point.
<p>
   The White House is deeply concerned about the possible effect of
this week's hearings on Gore, who is positioning himself as the heir
apparent to President Clinton. When the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee reconvenes Thursday, the featured witnesses will be two
Buddhist nuns slated to testify that they were used to launder money
to the Democratic National Committee in violation of federal law.
Although there is no evidence tying Gore to the arrangement, the
administration fears he will be linked by association because he
attended the luncheon.
<p>
   ``That's the nuclear issue,'' said one White House official. ``That
could kill his presidential campaign.'' Nationally televised testimony
from innocent-looking nuns exploited by political operatives in an
illegal fund-raising scheme, the official said, could become the
searing image that stays with the voting public.
<p>
   In providing a point-by-point briefing on the vice president's
involvement with the temple Tuesday, the White House intended to send
a warning to Senate Republicans not to try to tar Gore with the
testimony of the nuns. ``We're not going to tolerate any innuendo on
that,'' the official said.
<p>
   Gore is an inviting target for Republicans, not only because
Clinton will never again be on the ballot but because the vice
president's once-squeaky clean image has been tarnished by the temple
episode, as well as by reports about his telephone solicitations from
the White House. Wielding the gavel this week will be Sen. Fred D.
Thompson, a fellow Tennessean and possible Republican presidential
candidate in 2000.
<p>
   In addition to the nuns, the committee plans to call at least one
senior Gore aide to testify this week, either deputy chief of staff
David Strauss or scheduling director Kimberly H. Tilley. No requests
have been made for an appearance by Gore, and aides said Tuesday that
he has no intention of testifying.
<p>
   Gore's visit to the red-pillared, pagoda-style Hsi Lai Temple in
Hacienda Heights, Calif., on April 29, 1996, has emerged as one of the
most memorable moments in the multiple campaign fund-raising
investigations. Although Gore initially characterized the visit as a
``community outreach event,'' about $140,000 was raised at the
luncheon, and temple leaders reimbursed $58,000 to 12 nuns and
devotees who wrote checks to the DNC. Federal law prohibits financing
contributions in someone else's name, and the DNC has acknowledged it
was inappropriate to collect cash in a religious building.
<p>
   The nuanced account the White House provided Tuesday largely
squares with Gore's previous statements, even though aides conceded
the account did not make the vice president or his staff look good.
<p>
   While the documents produced no new evidence proving Gore knew
money would change hands at the temple, they leave little doubt that
the event was inextricably tied to the party's fund-raising campaign.
<p>
   A briefing memo prepared by DNC finance officials and given to Gore
the day of the event noted that those attending were members of an
Asian American donor council organized by DNC fund-raiser John Huang
that council members were required to pay annual membership dues of
$2,500. The memo instructed the vice president that his ``role and
contribution'' was to thank the council members for their past support
``and inspire political and fund-raising efforts among the Asian
Pacific American Community.''
<p>
   Aides contrasted that memo with briefing memos for other Gore
events that were ``formal fund-raisers,'' noting those papers
explicitly stated financial goals. They also produced talking points
prepared for Gore on the day of the temple visit that show overt
references to campaign cash at a separate fund-raiser and no such
mention at Hsi Lai.
<p>
   Others at the White House knew the temple stop was a fund-raiser,
however. On April 11, Huang wrote a memo to Tilley on the event titled
``Fund-raising lunch for Vice President Gore.'' And on April 24, John
B. Emerson, deputy director of intergovernmental affairs at the White
House, sent an electronic message outlining Gore's California schedule
that included the reference, ``DNC funder for lunch.''
<p>
   In addition, officials said one aide traveling with Gore that day,
then-press secretary Peggy Wilhide, believed at the time that the
temple event was a fund-raiser, but they said it was not her job to
brief Gore and that she never raised the matter with him.
<p>
   The confusion arose in part because at one point a full-fledged
fund-raiser was planned for Southern California that day in addition
to one in San Jose. Gore referred to these in a March 15 e-mail reply
to Tilley, who asked whether he wanted to accept another invitation.
<p>
   ``If we have already booked the fundraisers, then we have to
decline,'' Gore wrote.
<p>
   On the same day he sent that message, as it happens, Gore met with
the temple's venerable master, Hsing Yung, at Huang's request in what
aides describe as a 10-minute courtesy call. The cleric invited Gore
to visit the temple, and the vice president replied that he would like
to do that.
<p>
   Officials said Huang later canceled the other Los Angeles-area
fund-raiser for logistical reasons and suggested Gore go to the temple
instead. &QL;

 &UR; Two Mexican Mafia Members Sentenced to Life in Prison (Los Angeles) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Two members of the Mexican Mafia  &MD;  convicted in May
after a 7-month federal trial that prosecutors hailed as a serious
blow against the secretive prison gang  &MD;  were sentenced Tuesday to
life in prison without the possibility of parole.
<p>
   True to the code of silence in which members deny the
organization's very existence, Randy ``Cowboy'' Therrien, 37, of
Moreno Valley, stoically looked straight ahead and said nothing when
U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew sentenced him to life imprisonment
after a 2½-hour hearing.
<p>
   Later in the day, David ``Smilon'' Gallardo, 37, of Los Angeles,
also said nothing in his defense before sentencing. But he reiterated
a request that Lew marry him and his girlfriend. ``I ask you once
again (to conduct the marriage),'' Gallardo asked the judge. ``That's
all I have left.''
<p>
   But Lew, who has been a federal judge in Los Angeles since 1986,
rejected the marriage request, explaining he conducted one such
ceremony when he was a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 13 years ago.
``I will never do it again,'' Lew told Gallardo. ``That to me was
enough.''
<p>
   Gallardo continually smiled at his girlfriend, who was seated in
the back of the courtroom, even as he was being sentenced.
<p>
   It will be left up to officials at the federal prison, where
Gallardo is sent, to decide whether to grant his request, officials
said.
<p>
   Under federal guidelines, the severity of their crimes dictated
that Therrien and Gallardo receive life terms without the possibility
of parole although the judge added 300 months to Gallardo's sentence
because of his past criminal record and other issues.
<p>
   Attorneys for both men said they would appeal the convictions.
<p>
   Therrien and Gallardo were first of 12 Mexican Mafia members to be
sentenced after a jury convicted them of racketeering and conspiracy
charges that alleged they committed murder, extorted money from street
gangs and trafficked illegal drugs to expand the prison gang's
influence in Southern California.
<p>
   Twenty-two persons were initially indicted in 1995 in the
government's case against the Mexican Mafia. Seven pleaded guilty to
lesser charges. One person died before he could be brought to trial
and another is awaiting trial.
<p>
   One defendant was acquitted when the jury returned its verdict on
May 30.
<p>
   The others, including four Wednesday, are scheduled to be sentenced
later this week.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Therrien was convicted for his involvement in the murders of two
Mexican Mafia members who were targeted for death by the organization
 &MD;  Manuel ``Rocky'' Luna in 1993 and Charles ``Charlie Brown''
Manriquez in 1992. He was also convicted of conspiring to kill two
others and conspiring to aid and abet in the distribution of illegal
drugs.
<p>
   Gallardo was also convicted for the murders of Luna and Manriquez.
Additionally, he was found guilty for the death of Hazard gang member
Ricardo ``Rascal'' Gonzalez, trying to kill two others and conspiring
to distribute drugs.
<p>
   While Therrien has only one conviction for receiving stolen
property and served 10 days in San Bernardino County jail in 1995,
Gallardo has been in and out of state prison, where the prison gang
gets most of its members, on convictions for robbery, attempted murder
and assault. Gallardo served time at Pelican Bay, California's
toughest prison, in the early 1990s.

 &UR; Diana's Acts of Charity May Have Been Vastly Understated (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  On a raw winter night in 1994, Princess Diana dropped by a
shelter called Off the Streets to comfort 40 prostitutes, drug addicts
and other homeless Londoners.
<p>
   As they waited, a swaggering 23-year-old told Paul George, the
social worker in charge: ``I don't know about these royals. I think
the IRA should shoot them all. She comes in here, we can give her a
good one.''
<p>
   ``Then Diana walks in, and he's the first person she sees in this
big warehouse,'' George remembers. ``She walks over to him, and I'm
thinking, Oh my God, this is going to be trouble!''
<p>
   ``But then Diana says: `It's Ricky, isn't it? Didn't I meet you
when you were sleeping down in the Strand?' And he just melts. `That's
right,' he says, `I'm getting myself together now ... ''
<p>
   That story is one of many surfacing this week that suggest Diana
touched the sick and the down-and-out far more often and perhaps more
deeply than was publicized during her lifetime. ``It's an example of
how she disarms and charms,'' George said, having trouble using the
past tense.
<p>
   The death of Diana, described by the London newspaper The
Independent as ``probably the most successful fund-raiser on the
planet,'' has set off a flood of new offers to her favorite charities.
In response, Buckingham Palace Tuesday set up an official memorial
fund in her name to collect and administer them.
<p>
   While welcoming that move, Britons involved in these causes said
Diana's true legacy is not the millions she raised with celebrity
lunches and auctions of her fashionable clothes but an irreplaceable
compassion she brought directly to people she was helping.
<p>
   The British-based Leprocy Mission and the National Aids Trust
credit Diana with easing the stigma of those diseases by embracing
sufferers on camera, dispelling the myths that either can be spread by
human contact.
<p>
   She also held publicized benefits for the Centrepoint organization
for the homeless, the English National Ballet, the Great Ormond Street
Hospital for children and the Royal Mardsen NHS Trust cancer treatment
center  &MD;  the few charities she focused on after resigning from 100
others in July 1996, just before her divorce from Prince Charles.
<p>
   But Diana kept most of her work from public view so as not to spoil
its intimate nature.
<p>
   ``There was no financial benefit when she made a private visit,''
said George, whose shelter is one of 14 run by Centrepoint. ``Money is
not what it was about. She wanted to know what life was like for
people less fortunate than herself. And she wanted to make a
difference by showing that she cared.''
<p>
   Diana went incognito to the Strand to visit vagrants sleeping on
the pavement, George said, and a few months ago she brought her two
sons to help prepare a meal and meet people staying at his shelter. He
said these visits often involved elaborate security procedures, such
as changing cars, to throw photographers off her trail.
<p>
   While it was never a secret the princess conducted missions of
comfort out of the limelight, the extent of them is just starting to
become known. A wide range of ordinary Britons whose burdens she
shared now feel free to speak about friendships that, until her death,
had to be confidential.
<p>
   Philip Woolcock, a 45-year-old social worker, told the Daily
Telegraph that he and his wife had carried on a friendship with ``the
real Diana'' since 1991, when the princess first learned through her
charity work that their 18-year-old daughter Louise was dying of
cancer.
<p>
   After comforting the girl with calls and bedsides visits until her
death in 1992, Diana dropped in on the parents and confided, in tears,
that her marriage was falling apart, Woolcock said.
<p>
   ``Judy and I simply couldn't believe that here was the future queen
confiding in us,'' he told the newspaper. ``She spoke to us with such
honesty and compassion. ... That visit made us feel that life was
probably still worth living after our terrible loss.''
<p>
   Other Britons aided by Diana said in interviews that they, too,
felt her all the more empathetic because she did not hide the
suffering in her own life. ``She knows that homelessness can happen to
anyone,'' George said. ``In a sense at some point she must have felt
homeless herself.''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Among the mourners at Kensington Palace this week was Danielle
Stephenson, 8, whom the princess had visited five times after the girl
had heart surgery at London's Royal Brompton Hospital in May. Diana
had also given the child her direct phone number at the palace and
taken her calls.
<p>
   ``She gave our patients what none of us was able to give  &MD;  this
magic,'' said hospital spokeswoman Averil Slade. ``She came here as
often as three times a week. She'd bounce in unannounced, in jeans and
trainers, sit on people's beds and talk for hours.''
<p>
   Another mourner was Vincent Seabrook, 27, who showed up at the

 &UR; Dow Gets Biggest-Ever Point Gain (New York) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  The bulls are back  &MD;  but what does it mean?
<p>
   In the first day of trading after its August lull, the stock market
soared Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 257.36
points, its biggest gain ever in point terms. The previous record was
186.84 on Oct. 21, 1987, two days after the Black Monday market crash.
<p>
   In relative terms, the Dow rose 3.4 percent, the most since Jan.
17, 1991, when it surged 4.6 percent as the Allies attacked Baghdad,
Iraq, at the start of the Persian Gulf war.
<p>
   The record gain came after a dismal August in which the Dow fell
600 points, or 7.3 percent, marking the worst month since Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August 1990.
<p>
   But unlike many seismic shifts in the Dow, Tuesday's advance
stemmed from no single event, analysts said.
<p>
   Instead, there were many causes. Money managers returning from
vacations saw blue-chip bargains. Some Asian stock markets rebounded
after days of frightening falls. And the latest economic data
suggested U.S. inflation may not reach worrisome levels.
<p>
   But in one aspect, the market remained consistent, at least to
bearish analysts. As in August, stocks remained volatile, with program
traders and momentum players ready to jump on any bandwagon.
<p>
   For pessimists, that was hardly a sign of health.
<p>
   ``I find this volatility a bit unnerving and symptomatic of a
market that is detached from reality,'' said Michael Metz, chief
investment strategist at Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. in New York.
<p>
   ``The market was a bit stretched as far as pessimism was concerned.
It was entitled to a bounce,'' he said. ``It was an excessive one, but
we live in a world of excess  &MD;  socially, artistically and
financially.''
<p>
   The conditions for the rebound developed as traders in New York
were still asleep. In Southeast Asia, share prices steadied, with Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index, which had fallen 18 percent since July,
snapping a five-day losing streak.
<p>
   At the same time, some investors decided the currency turmoil that
caused the Southeast Asian declines had a good side, since weaker
Asian currencies would cut the cost of Asian goods for Americans and
hold down U.S. inflation, said Joseph Battipaglia, chief strategist at
Gruntal &AMP; Co., a brokerage in New York.
<p>
   The positive tone at the market's opening confounded traders who
had sold shares short, Battipaglia said. Short sellers bet on price
declines; they sell borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back later
at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
<p>
   When prices headed up Tuesday instead of declining, the short
sellers scrambled to ``cover'' their positions, buying back the shares
they had sold and thus pushing prices even higher, said Battipaglia.

 &UR; FDA Examines New Use for Risky Drug &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A drug that caused thousands of birth defects in the 1960s could
return in a big way if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
recommends the approval of thalidomide during special hearings
Thursday and Friday.
<p>
   The FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee will
discuss recommending approval of the drug for leprosy and macular
degeneration, a blinding disorder that primarily affects people 60 and
older.
<p>
   Next week, the National Institutes of Health will sponsor a two-day
meeting Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the benefits and risks of
using the drug for a growing list of medical disorders.
<p>
   Scientists are predicting that the drug may be recommended for a
narrow range of medical conditions and not the growing list of
disorders that includes prostate cancer and other types of tumors.
<p>
   Thalidomide, a pharmaceutical scourge from the past, has emerged in
clinical studies in recent years as a potential effective treatment
for leprosy, macular degeneration, cancer and the mouth ulcers and
physical wasting associated with AIDS.
<p>
   ``Underlying all of these conditions is a common mechanism ...
which involves the inflammatory processes,'' said Dr. Lawrence Fox of
the division of AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
<p>
   In leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, prescribing thalidomide
ends a virtual go-for-broke war in the body. Proteins known as
antigens are produced by the infecting bacteria. The body mounts an
inflammatory response by its immune-system warrior cells and proteins.
But warfare against these foreign proteins leads to nerve
inflammation, which in turn causes pain.
<p>
   ``Thalidomide doesn't attack the bacteria,'' said Aloys Cabrera,
nurse coordinator of the Hansen's disease program at Staten Island
University Hospital in New York, ``it eases the pain.'' The hospital
has used the drug in a series of clinical trials since 1989, she said.
It is administered mostly to men with leprosy and women who are past
reproductive age. When taken during the early weeks of pregnancy, the
period when limbs bud, thalidomide can retard the normal development
of arms and legs.
<p>
   Three decades ago, thalidomide caused limb defects in about 12,000
children, born primarily in Europe, where the drug was prescribed to
pregnant women as a sedative and treatment for morning sickness. It
was banned worldwide in 1962. Thalidomide was never approved in the
United States.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   But in an evolving list of medical conditions, it is proving to be
a kind of new-found wonder drug. In the wasting disease associated
with AIDS, for example, a broadly active immune-system molecule called
TNF becomes the hyperactive culprit that throws the body's ability to
use food out of balance. Malnutrition and extreme weight loss are
common in these patients.
<p>
   ``By reducing TNF,'' Fox said of administering thalidomide, ``the
wasting factor is reversed.''
<p>
   In macular degeneration and cancer, the inflammatory responses are
even more dramatic and complex, and thalidomide is said to be
effective against them.
<p>
   The drug still carries the threats it did decades ago. The
difference, said Fox, who will conduct sessions next week on
thalidomide's risks and benefits, is that pharmaceutical companies now
know how to tweak thalidomide's chemical chain to eliminate molecules
that cause fetal defects. Studies to make the drug safer, he said, are
now under way.

 &UR; Gore Donors' Funds Used as `Hard Money' (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  More than $120,000 in campaign contributions
personally solicited in 1995-96 by Vice President Gore for a ``soft
money'' account not covered by federal election regulations instead
went into a ``hard money'' account subject to federal limits.
<p>
   The money came from at least eight of 46 donors the vice president
telephoned from his White House office to ask for contributions to the
Democratic National Committee, according to records released by Gore's
office.
<p>
   The distinction is significant because Attorney General Janet Reno
has cited the absence of evidence that high-level government officials
sought hard money donations as a key reason not to recommend
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate fund-raising
activities for last year's elections.
<p>
   Soft money is defined as contributions not intended to support
individual candidates but to promote ``party-building'' and other
general campaign activities such as television advertising, and is
largely unregulated. Hard money contributions are highly valued by
campaigns because they can be used directly to benefit individual
candidates. But federal law places specific restrictions on the
solicitation, amount and use of such contributions.
<p>
   Among those restrictions, the law says that such regulated
contributions cannot be solicited on federal property. Thus, Reno has
maintained that because she has seen no evidence regulated
contributions were solicited from the White House  &MD;  or, in the words
she used in an April 14 letter, any White House area ``occupied in the
discharge of official duties''  &MD;  no independent counsel is warranted.
<p>
   A senior White House official said Tuesday that Gore did not ask
for any hard money contributions, and was unaware that money he
solicited was directed into the DNC hard money account.
<p>
   DNC spokeswoman Amy Weiss Tobe said Tuesday night that ``the Vice
President was not aware that money was being designated for the
federal (hard money) account.'' She said that it was ``routine
procedure'' to assign the first $20,000 of a large donation  &MD;  the
legal limit for a hard money contribution  &MD;  to that account and to
deposit the rest into the soft money account, and suggested that had
inadvertently happened with the contributions solicited by Gore.
<p>
   Officials said Tuesday night this practice may bring scrutiny by
the Federal Election Commission because it does not necessarily
reflect the wishes of the donors, who are supposed to designate the
use of the money. Records made available by Gore's office show that
his telephone solicitations resulted in at least $105,000 being
deposit into the DNC's hard money account within days or months after
he solicited the donors.
<p>
   The practice poses a more immediate question for Reno, however, who
has been sharply criticized by senior Republicans for declining to ask
for appointment of an independent counsel.
<p>
   Burt Brandenburg, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, said
Tuesday night that Reno would have no comment on the matter. Reno has
previously said that prosecutors assigned to a Justice Department task
force examining fund-raising activities in last year's elections would
look at any new allegations presented to them.
<p>
   The controversy about Gore's telephone solications arose ealier
this year when he was questioned about calls he made from the White
House seeking contributions for last year's reelection effort.
Although Gore originally acknowledged making a few calls from the
White House for soft-money contributions, the White House last week
acknowledged that he had made 86 calls and reached 46 potential
donors.
<p>
   A separate issue concerning the phone solicitations also arose
again last week when Gore's office said the DNC would reimburse the
U.S. Treasury on June 27 for $24.20 for calls presumably made from
official government phones. Though the sum is small, it establishes
that Gore's attorneys believed that at least 20 calls to potential
donors could not be attributed to credit cards controlled by the
Clinton-Gore campaign or the DNC and that the government therefore had
to be reimburse for the cost of the calls.
<p>
   In March, when the question of Gore's personal telephone
solicitations first became an issue, Gore said the long distance calls
had been made on a DNC credit card. Later, he said the calls were made
on a Clinton-Gore credit card. A review of the phone calls by Gore's
attorneys shows that $58.21 of the calls were billed on a Clinton-Gore
card, none to any DNC credit card and that calls totaling $24.20 were
presumably made on government phones.
<p>
   Throughout the solicitation controveersy, even while defending
themselves against specific allegations, White House officials have
said that laws relating to the use of government properties and
telephones do not apply to the President and Vice President.
<p>
   Records compiled by Gore's attorneys show that Gore was seeking
``soft money'' contributions because he was calling potential donors
for contributions of at least $25,000, which is $5,000 more than the
$20,000 hard-money maximum allowed under federal election law.
<p>
   At the time, the party was almost desperate for hard money because
it could be pumped directly into the Clinton-Gore campaign and used
for advertising and other campaign-specific activities.
<p>
   It is more difficult to raise large amounts of hard money because
of the legal limit. In addition to the $20,000 cap, corporations and
labor unions are barred from giving hard money, which must come from
individuals.
<p>
   It is not clear how the DNC decided to allocate the money raised by
Gore, but his role in soliciting the funds is clear, in some cases,
from the records. For example, on Feb. 1, 1996, the DNC prepared a
sheet for Gore recommending that he call Robert L. Johnson, the head
of Black Enterainment Television, and suggest that the Vice President
``ask him'' for $30,000 for the DNC media campaign.
<p>
   Four days later, on Feb. 5, Gore spoke with Johnson, according to a
letter Gore sent on that date. ``Thank you for your commitment to make
an additional contribution of $30,000,'' the letter said.
<p>
   Then, 11 days later on Feb. 14, the DNC deposited the $30,000 from
Johnson, splitting it into $20,000 for the federally regulated
hard-money account and $10,000 for unregulated soft-money account.
<p>
   Gore's letter raises another possible problem. He wrote that
``President Clinton and I thank you. ... We appreciate your dedication
to our Administation.'' An FEC regulation says that if a party
soliciation includes a ``reference to a federal candidate or a federal
election,'' the ``soliciation shall be subject to'' federal election
law.
<p>
    &UR; -(optional trim to end)- &QC; 
<p>
   Other Gore thank-you letters contain the same language. In another
call sheet prepared for Gore on Feb. 1, 1996, he was aked to call
William B. Dockser, head of CRI Inc., a real estate development firm
based in Rockville, Md. ``Ask him to send in $25,000 to fund the media
campaign,'' a notation on the call sheet said. The thank-you letter
was dated four days later, and it included a reference to President
Clinton, then running for reelection. The $25,000 contributed by
Dockser was split a week later, with $20,000 going to the DNC's hard
money account and $5,000 to the soft money account.
<p>
   Dockser said in an interview Tuesday that the full $25,000 was
supposed to go to the DNC's soft money account. Dockser said the Vice
President called him and that they spoke for about 10 minutes. ``He
talked about the Democratic Party and its needs to counter the
Republican party,'' Dockser said, adding that the discussion ``was
clearly focused on the reelection'' campaign of Clinton and Gore.
<p>
   Another Feb. 1, 1996, call sheet requested that Gore call George
Marcus, president of a California real estate firm, and ask him to
give $50,000. Eleven days later, the DNC split Marcus's contribution,
with the $20,000 maximum going to the hard-money account and $30,000
to the soft-money account.
<p>
   On Feb. 5, 1996, Gore placed a call to E. Blake Byrne, a former
executive at Argyle Television, according to a thank-you note Gore
sent to Byrne later that day. Fifteen days later, a contribution of
$20,000 was recorded in Byrne's name to the DNC's hard-money account
and another, for $5,000, to the soft-money account. In all, Byrne
contributed more than $74,000 to the DNC.
<p>
   In another case, Gore was asked on Nov. 22, 1995, to call Sanford
Robertson, chairman of Robertson, Stephens and Co. in San Francisco,
and request $100,000 soft-money donation. On Jan. 23, 1996,
Robertson's $100,000 was split, with $20,000 going to the hard money
account and $80,000 to the soft.
<p>
   On Apr. 22, 1996, Gore was asked to solicit Peter Angelos, the
owner of the Baltimore Orioles. A month later, on May 24, Angelos's
$100,000 was split, with $20,000 going to the hard money account and
$80,000 to the soft.
<p>
   The DNC was sufficiently concerned about the issue of Gore raising
hard money that Joseph E. Sandler, the DNC general counsel, made an
elaborate spread sheet listing nearly 50 people that Gore called or
had been requested to call. All hard money contributions were then
listed for these people, and the Sandler found that the total exceeded
$600,000. Based on the call sheets, the thank-you letters and phone
records, more than $120,000 could be directly traced after Gore's
calls, documents show.

 &UR; Stock Average Surges Record 257 Points (New York) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  A burst of stock buying pushed the Dow Jones industrial
average up a record 257.36 points Tuesday, erasing in one day nearly
half the decline suffered by the Dow last month.
<p>
   Though the Dow's gain was a record in point terms, the percentage
gain of 3.38 percent was well below the record post-World War II gain
of 10.1 percent posted Oct. 21, 1987.
<p>
   ``There was heavy money flowing into the market today,'' said
Richard Cripps, director of equity marketing at Legg Mason Inc., a
Baltimore brokerage firm.
<p>
   Tuesday's market surge confounded the fears of bearish investors
who worried that the big, multinational companies that make up the Dow
average  &MD;  which has doubled in the past three years  &MD;  were finally due
for a significant fall. The average had lost 7.71 percent of its value
since its peak Aug. 6 at 8259.31.
<p>
   But analysts said it was too soon to say if Tuesday's action
signaled the beginning of a new leg up for the bull market. Rather,
several analysts expect big-company stocks to hover in a narrow
trading range, at least until economists get a better fix on whether
Federal Reserve Board policymakers will decide to raise short-term
interest rates when they meet Sept. 30.
<p>
   One important indicator investors will be watching to gauge the
economy's strength will be the August employment report, which will be
released Friday. Bruce Steinberg, Merrill Lynch's chief economist,
said in a fax to clients today, ``If the August employment report,
released on Friday, comes out as we expect, the recent market
correction could come to an end.''
<p>
   Still, few analysts expect the large-company stocks that make up
the Dow to resume their surge of last spring and early summer. The Dow
has risen 22.2 percent since the beginning of the year. Between now
and year-end, some analysts believe smaller stocks will record bigger
gains than larger capitalization brethren.
<p>
   This surge in big-company stocks was sparked by a wave of buying
from European investors, traders said. Despite earlier signals that
the German central bank was poised to raise interest rates  &MD;  signals
that had driven down the value of the U.S. dollar versus the German
mark for the past few weeks  &MD;  the Bundesbank announced no change in
rates Tuesday. The dollar gained two pfennings against the mark,
making dollar-denominated stocks more valuable, and Europeans
stampeded into the U.S. market.
<p>
   ``Europeans had been very skittish about the U.S. market, but after
today's Bundesbank statement, at least in the short run, they see our
market as a buying opportunity,'' said John Mueller, principal and
chief economist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., a market
forecasting firm in Arlington, Va.
<p>
   Jeffrey S. Tabak, a managing partner at Miller Tabak Hirsch + Co.,
a New York institutional trading firm, agreed European buying was a
big factor Tuesday. He also noted that traders were relieved when a
survey of U.S. manufacturing strength came in weaker than expected,
easing fears that the nation's economic expansion might be
accelerating so fast that the Fed would have to raise interest rates.
<p>
   The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported that its
index of manufacturing orders, production, employment, deliveries,
inventories and prices paid for goods slipped to 56.8 in August, after
rising in July to 58.6. Any number over 50 on the index denotes growth
in manufacturing.
<p>
   ``The market has outlined the border of a trading range,'' said
Elaine Yager, chief technical analyst at Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc.,
an institutional brokerage firm in New York. ``While we're in this
range, there will be a lot of yelling, hollering and screaming as
volatility increases.''
<p>
   Yager said she does not foresee another big move on the upside for
stocks until interest rates drop substantially, the U.S. dollar
retraces its earlier highs against European and Japanese currencies,
and prices on stock market futures contracts overtake earlier levels.
<p>
   But Jack Bouroudjian, vice president for equity futures at Credit
Agricole Futures, a trading firm in Chicago, said he believes the
overall market has plenty of strength to go higher.
<p>
   ``In hindsight, it was good in August to get the froth out of the
market,'' he said. ``But the things that made it go up before August
are still there. All the smart money I talk to used this weakness as a
buying opportunity.'' &QL;

 &UR; Microbe May Be Specific to Pocomoke River (Pocomoke, Md.) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   POCOMOKE, Md.  &MD;  The Pocomoke River's singular ecology may make it
particularly vulnerable to a fish-killing microorganism that can
sicken people, a senior Maryland scientist said Tuesday, indicating
that the microbe might be less likely to strike elsewhere than
previously feared.
<p>
   Robert Magnien, who leads Maryland's efforts to monitor the health
of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, presented his hypothesis to
a panel of scientists investigating problems on the Pocomoke, where
12,000 or more fish died in two fish kills in August.
<p>
   Magnien hypothesizes that as the Pocomoke changes from a deep,
narrow waterway to one that is shallow and broad, it creates an
environment that attracts fish and nurtures Pfiesteria piscicida . The
toxin-emitting microbe has blossomed in dangerous levels on the
Eastern Shore river but not, apparently, on other Chesapeake Bay
tributaries.
<p>
   Although untested, Magnien's idea drew favorable initial reactions
from a task force of 16 scientists who work for federal and state
governments, universities and the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The task force advises state officials grappling with the Pfiesteria
problem.
<p>
   ``The set of circumstances he's describing fits really well with
our understanding of Pfiesteria 's biology and ecology,'' said JoAnn
Burkholder, a North Carolina State University researcher who first
identified the microorganism.
<p>
   Maryland officials said Magnien's hypothesis indicates that
Pfiesteria outbreaks elsewhere are not inevitable, and they expressed
relief.
<p>
   ``I think this is a very good sign that there might be several
factors isolating it to the Pocomoke,'' said Verna Harrison,
Maryland's assistant secretary of natural resources for Chesapeake Bay
and watershed programs. But, Harrison added, ``we definitely are going
to remain vigilant.''
<p>
   At a briefing on the Pocomoke River for local officials on the
Eastern Shore, scientists sought to reassure the public that the
problem doesn't extend beyond the Pocomoke.
<p>
   ``All evidence so far is these conditions remain pretty
localized,'' said Stephen Jordan, a fish pathologist and director of
the joint state-federal laboratory in Oxford, Md.
<p>
   The Pocomoke, scene of a fish kill over at least three days last
week, remained closed for a fourth straight day Tuesday, although it
appeared that no fish were dying, officials said.
<p>
   Gov. Parris N. Glendening, Democrat, ordered the closing late
Friday after doctors found brain damage and other ailments in a group
of 13 people who complained of memory loss, breathing difficulty and
skin sores after having come in contact with the river.
<p>
   Glendening said it appeared that Pfiesteria , which emits a toxin,
had harmed the 13, who included watermen, a water-skier and state
employees sent to sample the river during the first fish kill in early
August.
<p>
   Tuesday, Magnien, director of Tidewater Ecosystem Assessment for
the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, addressed the committee
of scientists.
<p>
   Few, if any, other major rivers around the bay share the
characteristics of the Pocomoke, said Donald Boesch, president of the
University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine
Studies. Magnien, speaking of pieces of a puzzle falling into place,
said the deep and dark waters of the upper Pocomoke are relatively low
in dissolved oxygen and are inhospitable to algae and fish.
<p>
   Algae normally consume nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus,
which can be washed into the river from farm fields. But with few
algae present, nutrients in the Pocomoke pass relatively intact into
the broad, shallow mouth of the river and fuel algae growth. There,
Pfiesteria and fish both prey on the algae, and the microbe transmutes
into toxic forms, which feed on the fish.
<p>
   In its search for the cause of the fish kills, the state
Agriculture Department is interviewing more than 200 farmers in the
Pocomoke River watershed. Specialists have speculated that nutrient
runoff, from poultry farms in particular, may have triggered the
release of the deadly toxin.
<p>
   Assistant Agriculture Secretary Royden Powell III said that not all
farmers in the watershed have agreed to cooperate with the survey but
that most have been receptive.
<p>
   ``Clearly,'' Powell added, ``there are issues that go beyond the
Pocomoke. There may be other watersheds in the state that could be
affected in the same way.''

 &UR; Londoners Fault Charles as Catalyst for Tragedy &QL; 
 &UR; (London) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  Not even tragedy has raised Prince Charles in the esteem
of his countrymen.
<p>
   The cool, remote Prince of Wales might be weeping over the death of
his former wife, Princess Diana, if tabloid tales are true, but the
British public appears to be oddly unmoved by his sorrow.
<p>
   Charles, whose dour demeanor, eccentric enthusiasms and affair with
a married woman have long made him the loser to Diana in the
competition for public affection, has said nothing publicly and issued
no statement since Diana was killed in an auto accident with companion
Dodi Fayed and a driver early Sunday. But, according to media
accounts, he is suffering deeply.
<p>
   He has been roaming the moors of Scotland, contemplating his sorrow
over the loss of his ex-wife, said the Daily Mail. Red-eyed and
sleepless, he is totally distraught, said the Sun.
<p>
   But many media commentators urged the heir to the throne to heed
his former wife's example, loosen up and reach out to his subjects in
the same open-hearted way she did  &MD;  or risk his future and that of the
House of Windsor.
<p>
   Among the throngs of mourners in London, few people are shedding
tears for the prince. Diana touched them in a special way, they say,
but talk of Charles turns the conversation cold. As cold, some noted,
as Charles appears to be.
<p>
   ``He's full of guilt  &MD;  and he should be,'' said Vanessa Belton, who
stood in line with thousands of others to sign a book of condolence at
St. James's Palace in memory of Diana. ``If he'd loved her  &MD;  and all
she wanted was her love returned  &MD;  this would never have happened.
She'd never have had to go elsewhere.''
<p>
   ``He's in a sad state, is he?'' harrumphed 85-year-old Morris
Regan, part of another vast assembly of mourners outside Kensington
Palace, Diana's official residence. ``Let me tell you this: I'm a
royalist. I like the royals. She was a lovely lady. A credit to
Britain. His tears? Guilt. He was a two-timer, wasn't he?''
<p>
   ``Look at all the people here,'' said Regan. ``What does the
country think of him? Well, he didn't think it would end this way. And
he never counted on this.''
<p>
   Royal watchers are debating whether Diana, even in death, will
control Charles's destiny. Britons still don't much like the woman
with whom Charles cheated on Diana, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and
analysts say Diana's death makes it less likely that Charles will be
able to formalize his relationship with her.
<p>
   ``Camilla should leave the country,'' said one woman, who echoed
the sentiments of countless mourners here Tuesday. ``Without the
mistress, none of this would've happened.''
<p>
   Many fault the prince for failing to maintain his marriage. Diana
traveled the world to fulfill royal duties, but many mourners pointed
out she would not have been in Paris that fateful night  &MD;  in the
company of boyfriend Fayed  &MD;  if her marriage had remained intact.
Others asserted that it was Charles and the Royal Family who pushed
for the divorce that ended the union last year.
<p>
   ``I think (Charles) is to blame for all of this,'' said Jean Lewis,
who waited in line at St. James's Palace to record a tribute to Diana
in the book of condolence. ``She would have been quite happy at home
with her two boys. Will he take those two boys to McDonald's (as she
did)? I don't think so.''
<p>
   Lewis, like others interviewed Tuesday, said Charles has forfeited
the right to become king and declared the next monarch should be his
and Diana's older son, Prince William, 15. ``I don't know if people
will forgive him for this,'' Lewis said. ``I know I won't. I don't
think he deserves to be king.''
<p>
   Even if the outpouring of sympathy for Diana diminishes with time,
royal watchers pointed out that Charles has a long-term public
relations problem: Diana will now remain forever young and forever
tragic and forever wronged. Can Prince Charles ever hope to compete?
<p>
   ``Perhaps the mood of the royal fans will be forgiving,'' wrote
columnist Polly Toynbee. ``Perhaps they will take pity on him in all
his contorted awkwardness, so ill at ease with everything in his life.
Perhaps they will forgive Camilla, whom Diana fingered so firmly as
the destroyer of her marriage.
<p>
   ``But,'' she added ominously, ``perhaps not.''
<p>
   ``Can Charles take the strain'' and change as so many of his
countrymen would like him to, asked the Daily Mail. ``Further erosion
and implosion of the monarchy is more likely,'' the paper opined.
<p>
   Charles will come under even greater public scrutiny in coming
weeks, if that is possible. Those more sympathetic to his plight are
calling his task ``agonizing'' and his prospective struggle to find
serenity for himself and his sons ``a sad story.'' He's undertaken his
initial duties in the wake of Diana's death admirably, supporters
note; his journey to Paris to bring her body home earned him respect
among those who mold opinion about the royals.
<p>
   Toynbee wrote that no one should view the prince now as an
``out-and-out'' villain. ``He wanted to be the right man in that
marriage and in life,'' she said. ``He just couldn't do it.'' &QL;

 &UR; Diana Had Firm Hold on America's Imagination (New York) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Clutching a strand of rosary beads and a small bouquet,
Jean Eckhoff stood weeping in the marble and terrazzo lobby of the
British consulate in Manhattan Tuesday  &MD;  one of many Americans who
responded to the death of Diana, princess of Wales, as though it were
a family tragedy, not a far-off news event.
<p>
   ``Princess Di meant a lot to me as a child,'' said Eckhoff, 27, a
Florida native who lives and works in Manhattan. ``I used to sleep
with her picture. I wrote her letters. I put her in short stories.''
Eckhoff even named the family cat ``Lady Di'' to honor the beautiful
British bride who, she said, often appeared in her girlish dreams.
<p>
   As Eckhoff struggled with her grief, other mourners who had lined
up on Third Avenue filed into the consulate to write condolences or to
add floral arrangements to the more than 2,000 received since Diana's
death Sunday, or to gaze in reverie at photographs of the young woman
they so admired.
<p>
   Cheeks flushed and eyes bright with tears, Megan Wands, 21, of
Chatham, N.J., said the news that Diana had perished in a Paris auto
wreck was a harsh introduction to the realities of adulthood. ``She
made people believe in fairy tales,'' Wands said. ``I'm never going to
believe in fairy tales again.''
<p>
   Such adoration might have been expected in Britain where Diana was
beloved despite marital woes and well-publicized spats with the royal
family, but her hold on the American imagination is proving at least
as tenacious in death as in life.
<p>
   The reasons are varied, according to experts in the fields of
psychology and pop culture, who note that Americans long have been
fascinated with the British crown  &MD;  and with celebrity everywhere.
<p>
   ``We've always been hung up on the Brits,'' said Jack Nachbar,
professor emeritus in the department of popular culture at Bowling
Green State University in Ohio. ``Though we fancy ourselves democratic
 &MD;  and fought a revolution  &MD;  we feel culturally inferior. And, in the
20th century, we are hung up on celebrities. Those two things met
perfectly in Princess Diana.''
<p>
   Beyond the American fascination with fame, fortune and royalty,
there seemed a particularly keen interest in Diana  &MD;  the fairy
princess with a common touch, the regal lady who left the impression
that, if it were possible, she would have everyone over for a couple
of brews in Buckingham's back yard.
<p>
   ``Diana exemplified the ordinary person and the princess and
carried off that dual role with grace,'' said Donald Weatherley, a
psychologist at the University of Colorado. ``We were fascinated with
a person pulled out of the masses who becomes an acceptable kind of
royalty.''
<p>
   Weatherley's words were echoed at the British Embassy in
Washington, D.C., by Camille Wahl, 28, of Rockville, Md., who, with
her sister, Stephanie, 21, had come to pay Diana last respects. ``She
gave to people and gave of herself; people like to see that. She was
royal, she was a celebrity and a real person, too.''
<p>
   It was Diana's reputation for decency that seemed to resonate
especially in the United States.
<p>
   ``Not only would she present herself as a fairy princess but she
was a good princess, too  &MD;  the good mother, the beneficent person who
worked for causes and visited hospitals,'' said Fredrick Koenig, a
social psychologist at Tulane University in New Orleans. ``Her
appearance in the living room through television provided a glow for
the day.''
<p>
   If members of British royalty often seem to Americans distant,
disdainful and intellectually arrogant, Diana seemed OK.
<p>
   ``She's never said anything important, nothing profound,'' said
Marshall Fishwick, a specialist in popular culture at Virginia
Polytechnic and State University. ``She had no real philosophy and was
almost embarrassingly open, frank and vulnerable.'' But those were
precisely the qualities that made Diana irresistible to many on these
shores. ``Americans like someone who comes in and tells it the way it
is,'' Fishwick said.
<p>
   When it came to Diana, Americans could never get enough.
<p>
   ``We've done 43 covers and three special issues on Diana, and
people were always clamoring for more,'' said Susan Toepfer, executive
editor of People magazine. ``I think it was her human quality that
endeared her to the American public  &MD;  especially women.''
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Meanwhile, Diana's followers lament her loss.
<p>
   In June, Diana met Mother Teresa at a Bronx mission house operated
by the Sisters of Mercy. Tuesday, Jeffrey Ling, the British consul
general in New York, brought a van load of bouquets from the consulate
to the mission for distribution throughout the community in Diana's
name.
<p>
   One nun, Sister John Janet, said she had been talking to
neighborhood residents who remembered Diana fondly.
<p>
   ``They told me, `She was not prejudiced. She was not afraid to come
to us,' '' said Sister John Janet. And, Sister John Janet said,
another sentiment expressed by people who remembered the princess: ``I
hope you are praying for her.''

 &UR; Gore Aides Detail Fund-Raiser at Buddhist Temple (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Seeking to pre-empt Senate hearings that resume
Thursday, aides to Vice President Al Gore Wednesday offered their most
detailed account yet of how Gore came to participate in a
controversial fund-raiser at a California Buddhist temple and what he
knew about it beforehand.
<p>
   Aides to the vice president acknowledged that several members of
his staff  &MD;  including one unnamed member of his traveling party  &MD;  knew
in advance that the 1996 luncheon was designed to raise money for the
Democrats.
<p>
   They also conceded that the vice president's files are rife with
internal documents describing the event as a fund-raiser, and that
some of those documents should have alerted senior staffers about the
true nature of the luncheon and its potential for sparking
controversy.
<p>
   But the aides, who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity,
insisted that Gore himself had no idea money would be raised at the
event and offered internal documents to support that contention. They
also asserted that Gore was completely unaware of an alleged scheme by
two organizers of the luncheon, John Huang and Maria Hsia, to jack up
the yield afterward by illegally laundering contributions through
nuns, monks and devotees of the temple.
<p>
   Some of those nuns are expected to testify under a grant of
immunity from prosecution Thursday when the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee resumes its hearings on campaign finance abuses
after a monthlong break.
<p>
   After delving into the temple fund-raiser, the committee plans to
shift its focus to an exploration of the degree to which the Clinton
White House controlled the Democratic National Committee during last
year's campaign. Former DNC Chairman Donald Fowler is scheduled to
testify next week, with the combative former White House deputy chief
of staff, Harold Ickes, likely to take the stand later in the month.
<p>
   At least one member of the vice president's staff is expected to
testify about Gore's role in the temple event after the nuns tell
their stories. But the committee has not asked Gore himself to appear,
and aides say he has no plans to request such an appearance.
<p>
   ``There is no reason for him to go up there,'' said one Gore aide.
``It would just turn into a political circus. He has nothing new to
offer.''
<p>
   Nonetheless, no single event has caused Gore more embarrassment
than his appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, a Los
Angeles suburb, on April 29, 1996. And given the strong likelihood
that Gore will run for president in three years, the affair is of far
more than historical significance.
<p>
   Gore has offered varying accounts of the luncheon and his
understanding of it. After first calling it a ``community outreach
event,'' he acknowledged that it was ``finance-related'' and that
holding it at a place of worship was therefore inappropriate. But Gore
continued to assert that he did not know in advance that contributions
would be solicited or collected at the lunch.
<p>
   Gore's aides Tuesday reiterated that account and said it would be
borne out by a detailed examination of the record. They acknowledged
that six separate documents from the vice president's files apparently
refer to the event as a fund-raiser, including one that contains a
potential range for ticket prices  &MD;  $1,000 to $5,000 per head  &MD;  and
another by Huang that was written after he had supposedly assured
Gore's chief of staff that no money would be raised at the temple.
<p>
   The aides attempted to resolve the apparent contradiction by
explaining that two events, rather than one, were originally planned
for Gore's visit to the Los Angeles area on that day. One, organized
by Huang, was to be a traditional fund-raiser at a restaurant in
Monterey Park. The second, arranged by Hsia, was the stop at Hsi Lai  &MD; 
whose leader, Hsing Yun, had met with Gore in Washington the previous
month and invited him to visit the temple.
<p>
   But the Monterey Park event was canceled, in part because it did
not appear to be generating much in the way of money commitments, the
aides said. The two events were then collapsed into one, they said,
with some Gore staffers aware of the fact that money would now be
raised at the temple, and others  &MD;  as well as Gore himself  &MD;  left in
the dark.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   ``The staff perception of the event (as a fund-raiser) was not
passed up the line to the vice president,'' said one aide.
<p>
   In support of this assertion, Gore's aides released the scheduling
documents and ``talking points'' for Gore's appearance at the temple
and two other events: a fund-raiser at a private home in Northern
California later on the same day at the temple luncheon, and a
fund-raising dinner in Washington in November 1995.
<p>
   The schedules for the latter two events contain specific references
to the amounts expected to be raised, and the ``talking points''  &MD;  an
outline of the speaker's planned remarks  &MD;  allude to the fact that
those present have paid to attend. The documents for the temple event
contain no such references.

 &UR; Di's Death Renews Interest in Books About Her (New York) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  On Sunday and Monday, many customers entering Barnes &AMP;
Noble stores around the United States were asking for books about
Princess Diana, said Bob Wietrack, the chain's senior merchandise
manager. By late morning Tuesday, Beryl Needham, director of
merchandise for the 940 Waldenbooks stores, had heard from several
publishers wanting to gauge the chain's interest in new books and
reissues about the late princess.
<p>
   Soon afterward, publishers were nailing down plans for the first
new crop of titles.
<p>
   Kitty Kelley's ``The Royals,'' an unauthorized chronicle of the
House of Windsor, already had loomed as one of the bigger books this
fall. It will go on sale as scheduled Sept. 23. ``We are staying the
course,'' said Lynn Goldberg, a publicist for the Warner book,
responding to a suggestion in the industry that ``The Royals'' would
be delayed because its explosive revelations might clash with the
mourning for Diana.
<p>
   Newsweek reports this week that Kelley, who has written sharp-edged
biographies of Frank Sinatra and Nancy Reagan, is expected to allege
that the Queen Mother is illegitimate, that Queen Elizabeth II and
Princess Margaret were conceived through artificial insemination and
that Sarah Ferguson went through detox for cocaine abuse. Warner has
announced a first printing of 1 million copies.
<p>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster anticipates strong new sales for the Diana books
in its catalog. At the end of the week, the company's Pocket Books
division plans to ship two of the more successful books about Diana,
Andrew Morton's ``Diana: Her True Story'' (1992) and ``Diana: Her New
Life'' (1994), in paperback reprintings of 500,000 and 250,000 copies
respectively.
<p>
   Morton, a British journalist whose books benefited from his access
to Diana and her inner circle of friends, also is writing a new
20-page introduction to a commemorative hardcover edition of ``Diana:
Her True Story'' from S&AMP;S that will include a 16-page color photo
section; the book's release date has not been determined. Publishing
executives said they expected any commemorative keepsake on Diana's
life to sell especially well.
<p>
   In addition, Pocket is going back to press for 100,000 copies of
Penny Thornton's ``With Love From Diana: The Princess of Wales'
Personal Astrologer Shares Her First Hand Account of Diana's Turbulent
Years'' (1995) and for 100,000 copies of Donald Spoto's ``Decline and
Fall of the House of Windsor'' (1996). Randi Reisfeld's recent
biography of the future monarch, ``Prince William: The Boy Who Would
Be King,'' also will receive a fresh printing of 50,000 copies.
<p>
   ``When something this untimely happens, no one is prepared,'' said
Wietrack of Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``But from a customer demand, publishers
were quick to react.''
<p>
   As for so-called instant books about Diana and her tragic end, a
master of the species, Pinnacle Books Executive Editor Paul Dinas,
said Tuesday that he expected none would be rushed out to compete with
existing titles. Indeed, Amazon.com, the online bookseller, Tuesday
listed 75 titles on Diana alone, of which about 15 were widely
available in bookstores before Sunday's fatal crash. ``I can't believe
anyone would be foolish to compete from scratch with all that
product,'' Dinas said.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   On newsstands, the issue of People magazine that goes on sale
Friday will be the weekly's 44th to feature Diana on the cover  &MD;  she
already holds that magazine's record for cover appearances. A
spokeswoman said Tuesday that the magazine also may publish a special
stand-alone issue on the princess like those it produced after the
deaths of Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jerry Garcia and
Selena.
<p>
   A decision to do so may be hastened by consumer response to this
week's Diana cover on Time, People's sister publication, which said
Tuesday that it was distributing 250,000 additional copies to meet
reader demand. Time's average weekly newsstand sale is 184,000.

 &UR; Politicians Seek Shutdown of Nuclear Reactor (Mineola, N.Y.) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MINEOLA, N.Y.  &MD;  In a move that scientists from across the United
States said could jeopardize research in the nation, two lawmakers
Tuesday called for the permanent shutdown of Brookhaven National
Laboratory's nuclear reactor, blaming a ``culture of arrogance'' they
charge has fueled a public health hazard and undermined the
laboratory's other work.
<p>
   ``This is the only prudent, sensible course of action if we are
going to protect the public's health,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., speaking Tuesday at a morning news conference in Mineola with
Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., on their plan to introduce legislation to
stop the reactivation of the high-flux beam reactor at the Long Island
laboratory. The reactor has been closed since December 1996 after a
pool used to store its used fuel had been found to be leaking
radioactive tritium into groundwater. The lab has maintained that
drinking water has been unaffected and that the leak has posed no
public health threat.
<p>
   ``There is little patience for any more of the revelations we've
seen almost weekly at this facility,'' said Forbes, who along with
D'Amato said the laboratory's ``public be damned'' attitude dated as
far back as 1986, when elevated levels of tritium contamination were
first discovered.
<p>
   However, Peter Bond, the laboratory's interim director, called the
proposal disheartening and the charges inaccurate, saying he had hoped
that Forbes and D'Amato would have waited until the Department of
Energy decides whether to reopen the reactor, a decision that is
expected to be made in January after extensive community input. ``I'm
obviously disappointed they've chosen to short-circuit the process,''
said Bond.
<p>
   Nearly 20 reactor employees sat silently at the conference Tuesday,
at times shaking their heads at the politicians and saying that the
proposed permanent shutdown was more about election-year politics and
would squelch immense scientific progress that has resulted from the
reactor's use.
<p>
   ``It's a national asset,'' said Terri Kneitel, an engineer at the
reactor since 1991 who also said she fears losing her job. ``I'm
shocked, appalled.''
<p>
   Forbes said he originally envisioned reopening the reactor after
assurances that health, safety, and environmental concerns would be
addressed. ``But what made me decide conclusively is related to a
series of recent events, stemming from late July when a reluctant
laboratory officials verified leaking tritium from the sewage
treatment plant into the Peconic River system.''
<p>
   Environmentalists and residents who live in the surrounding area
said they were thrilled with the announcement. ``Today, I'm breathing
a sigh of relief,'' said Sarah Nuccio, 41, of Manorville, who lives
just a few miles from the laboratory and who has been vocal about what
she terms as its unwelcome presence in the community.
<p>
   In a statement released Tuesday, the Department of Energy's
director of the Office of Energy Research said the department has not
made any decision about whether to restart the reactor.
<p>
   Since it was constructed 32 years ago, the reactor has been
involved in a range of scientific discoveries, including the
development of radioactive isotopes used to diagnose heart disease in
10 million patients each year to research on enzymes that dissolve
blood clots.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   News of the move to permanently shut down the reactor shocked the
nation's scientific community Tuesday.
<p>
   ``It's going to put us at a significant disadvantage with our
research,'' said Robert Birgeneau, dean of science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has used the reactor a
number of times to study high-temperature superconductors, and
magnetic materials. ``It's the premier research reactor.''
<p>
   Closing the reactor would mean that only two comparable reactors in
the country would remain for scientists to conduct their work: a
Department of Energy-run reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in Tennessee and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Maryland.

   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Apple Computer Inc. signaled an end to its stormy

buying the business of the largest clone maker and indicating that
licensing agreements with others will not be renewed.
<p>
   Increasingly convinced that clone makers' success has come at
Apple's expense, the struggling computer manufacturer agreed to buy
the core Macintosh-based business of Power Computing Corp. for $100
million in stock.
<p>
   Austin, Texas-based Power Computing is among a handful of companies
that have been licensed to sell computers that use Apple's Macintosh
operating system. Since the licensing program began in 1994, Power
Computing's sales have surged to nearly $400 million, accounting for
12 percent of the Macintosh market.
<p>
   But Apple, which has lost $1.5 billion over the last 18 months and
has seen its market share decline, is now backpedaling from those
licensing agreements. Apple founder and de facto leader Steve Jobs
complained Tuesday that the terms of the licensing deals  &MD;  in which
Apple collects a royalty of about $50 per machine  &MD;  have sapped the
Cupertino company's profitability.
<p>
   ``We cannot continue to subsidize the clones,'' said Jobs,
explaining that licensing revenues don't compensate for costs borne
solely by Apple, including development of Macintosh software,
marketing and maintenance of relationships with developers of
Macintosh-based programs.
<p>
   Shares of Apple closed at $22.38, up 63 cents on Nasdaq.
<p>
   Apple will honor its existing contracts with clone manufacturers,
Jobs and other executives said, but the company does not expect to
expand or extend them.
<p>
   ``I don't want to say that's not possible,'' said Fred Anderson,
Apple's chief financial officer. ``We're always open for a licensee to
agree to economic terms that would benefit Apple. ''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Analysts said the moves will strengthen Apple's financial position
by eliminating competitors that squeeze profit margins and now account
for about 21 percent of the Macintosh market.
<p>
   But some warned that Apple could face a backlash from customers and
software developers who have come to expect choices and aren't
confident of the company's ability to expand the Macintosh market
single-handedly.
<p>
   ``It's good for Apple because it will allow them to return to
profitability quicker,'' said James Staten, an analyst at Dataquest in
San Jose. ``But is it good for the overall Macintosh market? No, it
can't be.''
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   Ironically, many industry experts trace Apple's declining fortunes
back to its decisions in the 1980s not to allow others to license its
Macintosh software, then considered vastly superior to any other
operating system.
<p>
   Apple relented in 1994, but by then Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
operating system had caught up technologically, and was licensed to
computer makers that accounted for about 90 percent of the market.
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Tuesday's news appeared to be a blow to a number of companies,
including Motorola Corp. and Umax Computer Corp., that have spent
millions of dollars creating businesses around selling Macintosh
clones. Anderson and Jobs said Apple does not plan to purchase the
Macintosh business units of any other clone makers.
<p>
   Umax, a subsidiary of Umax Data Systems of Taiwan, derives
two-thirds of its sales from models priced below $2,000.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   The crux of Tuesday's deal with Power Computing is that it
<p>
   has agreed to exit the Macintosh market and turn over to Apple
exclusive rights to the clone maker's list of more than 200,000
Macintosh customers.
<p>
   Power Computing keeps its brand name, its employees and its
manufacturing operations, presumably to be used in the company's
efforts to move into the market for computers that use Intel Corp.
microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows operating system.

 &UR; Apple Buys Biggest Maker of Its `Clones' (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday moved to crimp the business of selling
``clones'' of its Macintosh computers, purchasing the largest maker of
the machines and saying it would deny new technology to other clone
manufacturers.
<p>
   The decisions effectively reverse Apple's three-year-old strategy
of encouraging other firms to make Macintosh knockoffs in an effort to
expand the Macintosh market as a whole. Although those companies have
increased the number of computers running Macintosh software, the
competition has backfired for Apple, severely cutting into its own
sales.
<p>
   ``Mac clones are dead,'' said Chris Le Tocq, an analyst with
Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose. ``Who wants to buy
a Mac that doesn't come with the latest software?''
<p>
   Analysts saw the hand of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the
strategy shift. He has largely run Apple since chief executive Gilbert
Amelio was forced to resign in July and is known to oppose the terms
of the cloning deals.
<p>
   Apple said early Tuesday that it would spend $100 million to
acquire the core assets of Power Computing Corp., the largest clone
maker. Later in the day, Fred Anderson, who is officially the
company's acting chief executive, said in a conference call with
reporters and analysts that the company would honor existing cloning
agreements but would deny other cloners rights to ship machines with
the latest Macintosh operating system software.
<p>
   ``We don't have any current plans to give them new Apple designs,''
Anderson said. He said Apple does not want to put cloners out of
business but the company has been unable to renegotiate what it now
considers to be unfair licensing agreements.
<p>
   Guerrino De Luca, Apple's vice president for marketing, said the
terms of the current licensing agreements were ``a de facto subsidy to
the tune of several hundred dollars'' per machine for clone makers.
<p>
   Other companies that make Macintosh clones are Motorola Inc. and
UMax Inc. International Business Machines Corp. has a license to make
clones but has not yet produced any.
<p>
   Apple, the company that popularized the personal computer in the
late 1970s, refused for years to license its technology to other
computer makers. IBM, Apple's early rival in the PC market, took an
opposite approach with its system hardware, which became an industry
standard running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating software.
<p>
   Faced with plummeting market share, Apple decided in 1994 to allow
clones as a way to rejuvenate the Macintosh. The hope was that clones
would pump up the overall market for Macintosh systems, meaning
greater sales for everyone.
<p>
   But by early this year, that strategy appeared to be hurting Apple.
The cloners pushed down prices  &MD;  and Apple's profit margin.
<p>
   Anderson said clone makers also were not expanding the base of
Macintosh users fast enough. ``The unfortunate reality was that the
clone vendors did not sell very many systems to new customers,'' said
Anderson, who estimated that 99 percent of the clone makers' sales
went to previous Mac owners.
<p>
   In the first half of 1996, Apple had 94 percent of the market for
desktop Macintoshes, while Power Computing had 4 percent, according to
market research firm International Data Corp. In the same period this
year, Apple's share fell to 79 percent and Power's grew to 9 percent,
IDC said. Other clone makers, including Motorola and UMax, had the
remaining 12 percent.
<p>
   In addition to shoring up market share, the purchase of Power
Computing will set up Apple to sell computers directly to the public,
as do PC giants such as Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc.
While the new sales approach could anger some retailers, it is likely
to boost Apple's profit margins, analysts said.
<p>
   Putting an end to cloning means Apple could charge higher prices
for its machines, said Eric Lewis, an IDC analyst. ``It's a very
dangerous thing,'' he said. ``We could be going back to the old days,
when Apples were significantly more expensive than comparably equipped
(Windows) PCs.''

 &UR; Double Slaying Unmasks Bounty Hunters' Lethal Trade (Denver) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DENVER  &MD;  In the wake of the deaths of a young Phoenix couple slain
during a bungled raid, law enforcement authorities are dusting off old
lawbooks and discovering that bounty hunting is the most unregulated
arm of the American justice system.
<p>
   Operating under broad powers granted by the Supreme Court more than
a century ago, the nation's estimated 2,000 bounty hunters routinely
strap on bullet-proof vests and long-barreled handguns to enter homes
and automobiles without search warrants. They are held to looser
standards than conventional law enforcement officers. And they enjoy
almost carte blanche privileges to use deadly force in self-defense
when tracking down and apprehending their prey: wanted criminals who
skipped bail.
<p>
   Never mind that there is no formal licensing process for these
pseudo-cops  &MD;  glamorized in movies such as ``The Hunter,'' starring
Steve McQueen  &MD;  in any state. With prisons overflowing, and more
people being released on bail, the bounty hunting industry is booming.
<p>
   Trouble is, their mistakes can be tragic.
<p>
   At 4 a.m. Sunday, five men calling themselves fugitive recovery
agents  &MD;  all wearing black clothes, ski masks and body armor  &MD;  broke
down the front door of the wrong house in Phoenix in search of a
California bail jumper.
<p>
   Authorities said their ostensible target  &MD;  an unidentified man who
had skipped out on a $25,000 bail  &MD;  originally had been charged with
possession of drug paraphernalia.
<p>
   Two of the masked men tied up a woman who lived in the house and
held her three children at gunpoint, authorities said. The others
kicked down a locked bedroom door, and then walked into a fierce gun
battle.
<p>
   Killed were Christopher Foote, 23, and his girlfriend, Spring
Wright, 21. There were 29 bullet holes in the wall behind the couple's
bed and an adjacent hallway.
<p>
   Foote, who was armed with a 9 mm handgun, apparently emptied his
clip in self-defense and wounded two of the bounty hunters in their
arms and legs.
<p>
   Police arrested Matthew Brackney, 20, and Michael Martin Sanders,
40  &MD;  both of Phoenix  &MD;  and charged them with two counts of
second-degree murder. Brackney's father, David, 45, who was injured in
the gun battle, was expected to face similar charges upon release from
the hospital.
<p>
   An intense manhunt continued on Tuesday for two accomplices still
at large. They are regarded by police to be armed and dangerous.
<p>
   In response to the incident, law enforcement authorities here and
across the nation were calling for legislative inquiries into the
industry  &MD;  and curbs on the powers of individual bounty hunters.
<p>
   ``There's been little change in the law since the territorial days
when bounty hunters were used by sheriffs to look for people who had
robbed stage coaches,'' said Arizona state Sen. John Kaites, a former
Maricopa County attorney.
<p>
   ``That was when law enforcement authorities were few and far
between and they accepted even crude and unsophisticated help,'' he
said. ``In 1997, we need other means to keep innocent people from
getting hurt.''
<p>
    &UR; (Begin optional trim)
<p>
   Kaites is drafting legislation that would require prospective
bounty hunters to undergo extensive background checks and a formal
permitting process. It would also require that they notify police
before entering an occupied structure.
<p>
   A similar bill that would have limited use of deadly physical force
by bounty hunters was defeated a decade ago by Arizona's Senate
Judiciary Committee. That proposal was in response to a 1987 incident
in which a 19-year-old California bounty hunter shot and killed an
unarmed fugitive in Phoenix.
<p>
    &UR; (End optional trim)
<p>
   As it stands, these guns-for-hire remain all but unregulated,
although organizations such as the 1,500-member National Association
of Bail Enforcement Agents offer their own classes, training manuals
and equipment.
<p>
   But for those wanting to bypass classwork and get right to work
nabbing so-called ``skips,'' there is a ``hunter starter kit'' on the
market that sells for about $205. It contains a black tote bag
embossed with the word ``AGENT'' in gold letters on the sides, as well
as a black jacket, black cap, black T-shirt, handcuffs, pepper spray
and leg irons.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   Phoenix bounty hunter Linda Ownbey said the industry has not done a
commendable job of policing itself.
<p>
   ``We have to change the rules regarding these free-lance cowboys in
the field,'' she said. ``Right now, there are bounty hunter classes in
which people can pay $500 for three days of instruction. Then they are
turned loose wearing ninja clothes and guns.''
<p>
   She counts suspects Matthew Brackney and his father among the
problem fringe element.
<p>
   ``They came into my office twice last year looking for work; I ran
them out both times,'' she recalled. ``They were wearing black pants,
black T-shirts and combat boots; and they had a `we're big and bad'
attitude.'' ``I took one look at them and thought: No way. These guys
are trouble.''

 &UR; Nobel Prize-Winning Chemist John Cowdery Kendrew, 80, Dies &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   John Cowdery Kendrew, British molecular chemist who shared a 1962
Nobel Prize in chemistry for detailing the intricate structure of a
major protein, has died. He was 80.
<p>
   Kendrew, who was knighted and given the Order of the British Empire
in 1963, died Aug. 23 in Cambridge, England.
<p>
   He and colleague Max Ferdinand Perutz earned the Nobel for their
work at Cambridge in cataloging elements in human blood and providing
a major insight on how proteins do their crucial work.
<p>
   Cited for their studies on globular proteins, they perfected
methods using X-rays to map the structure of the vital bodybuilding
large protein molecules. Laying bare the structure of the blood
proteins, Kendrew concentrated on myoglobin while Perutz worked on
hemoglobin.
<p>
   Among those who inspired Kendrew to conduct his work were
crystallographer J.D. Bernal, whom he encountered during his war work
in Asia, and by chemist Linus Pauling, whom he met during a trip to
California.
<p>
   Born in Oxford, England, Kendrew studied at Oxford and Cambridge
and worked in radar technology with the Ministry of Aircraft
Production during World War II.
<p>
   The department that Kendrew and Perutz created at Cambridge is now
known as the Laboratory for Molecular Biology. Kendrew served as the
department chairman until 1974.
<p>
   Kendrew then established the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
at Heidelberg, Germany, and served as director until 1982.
<p>
   He also helped set up a committee of scientists to keep tabs on
worldwide gene experiments that could be considered both beneficial
and hazardous, under the aegis of the International Council of
Scientific Unions.
<p>
   ``What we want to do is accumulate a kind of pool of wise thinking
to make sure that the use that is made of it is of a positive kind,''
Kendrew said in 1976 as secretary general of the council that
represents 18 international scientific unions and 65 academies and
research groups.
<p>
   Kendrew founded the Journal of Molecular Biology and edited it
until his retirement in 1987 as president of St. John's College at
Oxford.
<p>
   His extensive writings include the book ``The Thread of Life: An
Introduction to Molecular Biology.''
<p>
   Kendrew was not married.

 &UR; Photographer Held by French Is Known for Award-Winning Shots &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Among the photojournalists in trouble Tuesday after the death of
Princess Diana is a highly regarded photographer who spent most of his
career in war zones and the world's trouble spots.
<p>
   The decision by French authorities to press forward with their
investigation of him and six others came as the behavior of the
paparazzi continued to roil the media world and a leading American
photojournalist condemned their behavior.
<p>
   Jacques Langevin of the Sygma Agency was put under formal
investigation for suspected manslaughter by a French magistrate
Tuesday.
<p>
   Langevin received international recognition in 1989 when he
outmaneuvered Chinese authorites and made pictures of the government's
crackdown on the student uprising in Tiananmen Square. A year later,
working outside of the established press pools and military censors,
Langevin documented the human toll of the Persian Gulf war. His
horrific photographs of annihilated Iraqi troops were published in a
1991 book.
<p>
   Eliane Laffont, president of Sygma, denied that Langevin, 42, was
involved with the paparazzi chase. In a statement Tuesday, Laffont
explained that Langevin, as the shift photographer on call, had taken
photos of Diana and Dodi Fayed at the Ritz Hotel. He then got into his
car to return to dinner with friends, his route taking him past the
crash scene. ``As a professional photojournalist, Langevin took photos
of the rescue team and the wreckage of the car.''
<p>
   In an interview for Wednesday's edition of the daily Liberation,
Langevin told the publication he arrived about 10 minutes after the
crash. ``The car was surrounded by police, firemen and photographers.
Things were happening normally,'' he said.
<p>
   He said emergency services had taken out the body of Fayed and were
trying to revive him and were seeking to help the other victims. He
said he learned later that photographers had alerted the emergency
services by mobile phone.
<p>
   ``Personally, I have four or five photographs, taken about 15
meters away, under the eyes of the police who had set up a sort of
light barrier,'' he said.
<p>
   Langevin said he tried to leave but that he and other photographers
still at the scene were abruptly rounded up. ``I never thought for a
second that we would be held for questioning, far less placed under
investigation.''
<p>
   For his photos at Tiananmen Square, Langevin was given a
prestigious award in 1990 by the International Center of Photography
in New York City. ``While Chinese authorities were detaining
journalists at the Beijing Hotel, at that moment Jacques was actually
there, already in the streets,'' his citation read.
<p>
   Paradoxically, it was Cornell Capa, the founder of ICP, who Tuesday
condemned the action of the paparazzi.
<p>
   ``Photography, since its invention, serves as a mirror of life and
consciousness. Princess Di's death is beyond the threshold of
brutalization of our lives, the mirror and the medium. I feel
desperate,'' said Capa, considered the dean of photojournalists and
the brother of the legendary war photographer Robert Capa.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the sense that the media increasingly are becoming part
of the story continued to trouble the journalism establishment
Tuesday.
<p>
   ``Just one more picture of Lady Di going out to dinner is
meaningless, and stupid, and has no place in the media. But that is
where the money is, unfortunately,'' said John Morris, former photo
editor at Life magazine, The New York Times and other news
organizations. ``The problem goes back to the public, which demands
this kind of paparazzi coverage,'' said Morris, author of a
forthcoming book on photojournalism.
<p>
   ``Whether or not the paparazzi go to jail for the crash, we were,
as the press, there at the creation of Diana and at her destruction,''
said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
<p>
    &UR; (Optional add end)
<p>
   This debate over the role of the paparazzi comes when dozens of
leading journalists were already prepared to launch an inquiry to
clarify the core purposes and principles of their craft. This new
group, the Committee of Concerned Journalists, calls upon its
colleagues to sign a statement calling for a ``period of national
reflection.'' It is being led by Bill Kovach, director of the Nieman
Foundation at Harvard University, and Rosenstiel.
<p>
   Rosenstiel said Tuesday that the public's readiness to ``jump to
the conclusion that somehow the media killed Princess Diana'' is only
the most recent and most dramatic sign of the troubles in journalism.
<p>
   ``The public no longer makes that much of a distinction between
so-called paparazzi and the rest of the more serious media,''
Rosenstiel said. And perhaps the traditional press is itself
responsible for blurring the lines. ``There is a distinction between
the network news and the European paparazzi, but the network news
probably has more in common with the paparazzi than it did 15 years
ago,'' Rosenstiel said.

 &UR; Netscape to Offer Service Aimed at Business Users &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Netscape Communications Corp. plans to announce Wednesday a World
Wide Web service that will include business-related news feeds and
discussion groups as well as an electronic store for corporate
software, according to company executives.
<p>
   Buffeted by competition from Microsoft Corp., Netscape is hoping to
take advantage of what's effectively a huge captive audience. Its
popular Navigator software automatically takes users to Netscape's
corporate site when they sign onto the Web, unless they change the
settings, which many never do. The corporate site now registers about
4 million visits a day.
<p>
   The new service, which would be offered at that site for free, aims
to create a virtual community for Internet users interested in
business and professional issues. The company hopes to make money
through advertising and partnership agreements with other firms.
<p>
   ``Think of it as an (America Online) community targeted at business
users,'' said Mike Homer, Netscape's senior vice president for
marketing.
<p>
   Netscape said the service will have about 1 million members at its
outset, largely because the company will transfer memberships from a
program it already runs to send personalized news reports to users'
electronic mailboxes.
<p>
   Making money off Web sites is increasingly important to Netscape.
Sales of Web ads, content agreements and business consulting services
made up almost 30 percent of the company's revenue last year, Homer
said.
<p>
   The new service, to be called Netcenter, will include a feature
called Industry Watch that will offer business news from a variety of
media organizations. The service also will have business-related chat
rooms and bulletin-board-like discussion groups as well as help in
setting up Web pages and chat groups that can be reached only by
designated users.

   A separate issue concerning the phone solicitations also arose
again last week when Gore's office said the DNC would reimburse the
U.S. Treasury for $24.20 for calls presumably made from official
government phones. Though the sum is small, it establishes that Gore's
attorneys believed that at least 20 calls to potential donors could
not be attributed to credit cards controlled by the Clinton-Gore
campaign or the DNC and that the government therefore had to be
reimburse for the cost of the calls.

 &UR; Gore Staff Saw Signs of Trouble &QL; 
 &UR; Before Temple Appearance (Washn) &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The White House Tuesday mounted a detailed defense of
Vice President Gore and his appearance at a Buddhist temple
fund-raiser just two days before congressional hearings into campaign
finance improprieties enter a new stage with the spotlight focused
squarely on Gore.
<p>
   Officials released a series of internal memos, electronic messages
and briefing papers intended to prove that Gore was unaware at the
time that the 1996 luncheon at the Hsi Lai Temple in California was a
fund-raising event.
<p>
   But the documents offered ample evidence that, at a minimum, Gore's
staff ignored numerous warning signs that could have averted what has
become one of the major embarrassments of Gore's career. And one
e-mail message from Gore himself six weeks before the event made clear
that he expected to attend a Los Angeles fund-raiser on that date,
although aides said the temple was not the planned location at that
point.
<p>
   The White House is deeply concerned about the possible effect of
this week's hearings on Gore, who is positioning himself as the heir
apparent to President Clinton. When the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee reconvenes Thursday, the featured witnesses will be two
Buddhist nuns slated to testify that they were used to launder money
to the Democratic National Committee in violation of federal law.
Although there is no evidence tying Gore to the arrangement, the
administration fears he will be linked by association simply because
he attended the luncheon.
<p>
   ``That's the nuclear issue,'' said one White House official. ``That
could kill his presidential campaign.'' Nationally televised testimony
from innocent-looking nuns exploited by political operatives in an
illegal fund-raising scheme, the official said, could become the
searing image that stays with the voting public.
<p>
   In providing a point-by-point briefing on the vice president's
involvement with the temple Tuesday, the White House intended to send
a warning to Senate Republicans not to try to tar Gore with the
testimony of the nuns. ``This is a shot across the bow,'' the official
said. ``Anyone who suggests the slightest knowledge by Al Gore of the
illegal reimbursement schemewe will not permit to go unchallenged.''
<p>
   Gore is an inviting target for Republicans, not only because
Clinton will never again be on the ballot but because the vice
president's once-squeaky clean image has been tarnished by the temple
episode, as well as by reports about his telephone solicitations from
the White House. Wielding the gavel this week will be Sen. Fred D.
Thompson, a fellow Tennessean and possible Republican presidential
candidate in 2000.
<p>
   In addition to the nuns, the committee has told two senior Gore
aides, deputy chief of staff David Strauss and scheduling director
Kimberly H. Tilley, to be prepared to testify this week. No requests
have been made for an appearance by Gore, and aides said Tuesday that
he has no intention of testifying.
<p>
   Gore's visit to the red-pillared, pagoda-style Hsi Lai Temple in
Hacienda Heights, Calif., near Los Angeles, on April 29, 1996, has
emerged as one of the most memorable moments in the multiple campaign
fund-raising investigations. Although Gore initially characterized the
visit as a ``community outreach event,'' about $140,000 was raised at
the luncheon, and temple leaders ultimately reimbursed $58,000 to 12
nuns and devotees who wrote checks to the DNC. Federal law prohibits
financing contributions in someone else's name, and the DNC has
acknowledged that it was inappropriate to collect cash in a religious
building.
<p>
   The White House Tuesday provided a nuanced account of Gore's
attendance at the temple event that appeared aimed largely at shifting
the blame from the vice president to his own assistants. ``This is a
story of mid-level Gore staff people not communicating what they had
learned,'' one official said after the briefing.
<p>
   While Gore has disclaimed knowledge, documents make clear that his
office knew the temple stop was a fund-raiser. On April 11, DNC
fund-raiser John Huang sent Tilley a memo about the event titled
``Fund-raising lunch for Vice President Gore.'' On April 24, John B.
Emerson, deputy director of intergovernmental affairs at the White
House, sent an electronic message outlining Gore's California schedule
that included the reference, ``DNC funder for lunch.'' And an undated,
unsigned draft schedule prepared by a Gore aide cited ``DNC Luncheon
in LA/Hacienda Heights: 1000-5000 head,'' an apparent reference to how
much money each guest would give.
<p>
   In addition, officials said one aide traveling with Gore that
day-later identified as then-press secretary Peggy Wilhide-believed at
the time that the temple event was a fund-raiser. But they said it was
not her job to brief Gore and she never raised the matter with him.
<p>
   According to the documents, Gore was informed for months that he
would attend a fund-raiser in the Los Angeles area on that day. What
remains unclear from the papers is whether he knew the original plan
to have it at a restaurant had been rearranged to combine it with his
temple visit, and not simply canceled as aides say he believed.
<p>
   In a March 15 e-mail reply to Tilley, Gore said he could not attend
a New York function because he would be flying to San Jose and Los
Angeles for fund-raisers on April 29. ``If we have already booked the
fund-raisers, then we have to decline,'' Gore wrote.
<p>
   As it happens, on the same day he sent that message, Gore met in
Washington with the temple's venerable master, Hsing Yung, at Huang's
request. At the end of that 10-minute session, the cleric invited Gore
to visit the temple sometime, and the vice president replied that he
would like to do that. Officials said the timing was coincidental, but
Huang later used this as a reason to add the temple to the April
schedule.
<p>
   Another memo sent to Gore by Harold Ickes, then deputy White House
chief of staff, shows that as late as April 10 the vice president was
told he would attend a fund-raiser in Los Angeles with ``projected
revenue'' of $250,000. That memo was not among those released by the
White House Tuesday, although it has been provided to investigators.
At that time, officials said, the fund-raiser was still planned for
the restaurant, but Huang's memo to Tilley just a day later listed the
temple as the location.
<p>
   On the day of the event, Gore was given a briefing memo prepared by
DNC finance officials noting that those attending the temple luncheon
were members of a Huang-organized Asian American donor council that
required annual membership dues of $2,500. The memo instructed the
vice president that ``your role and contribution'' was to thank the
council members for their past support ``and inspire political and
fund-raising efforts among the Asian Pacific American Community.''
<p>
   Aides Tuesday contrasted that memo with briefing memos for other
Gore events that were ``formal fund-raisers,'' noting that those
papers explicitly stated financial goals, unlike the one for the Hsi
Lai luncheon. They also produced talking points prepared for Gore on
the day of the temple visit that show overt references to campaign
cash at a separate fund-raiser and no such mention at Hsi Lai.

   The Dow closed at 7879.78 in heavy trading. Though the Dow's gain

 &UR; MARKET BEAT: Putting Their Money Where Their Mouth Is &QL; 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Any mutual fund manager can load up a portfolio with hundreds of
stocks and say he's bullish. If the market goes up, he'll be lifted
with it. If the market goes down, he'll sink with it  &MD;  but he (or she)
can always hide behind the boilerplate that ``not even a diversified
portfolio can escape a bear market.''
<p>
   Uh-huh.
<p>
   And how much conviction do such managers have about the individual
stocks they own? Usually not a heck of a lot.
<p>
   If you really want to get a sense of whether there are reasonably
priced stocks left to buy in a market that is near record highs  &MD;  and
increasingly volatile, as Tuesday's 257.36-point Dow Jones surge
demonstrated  &MD;  a good place to start is with managers who run very
concentrated portfolios, often owning 50 stocks or fewer.
<p>
   When every stock has to matter, a manager is likely to be much more
thorough in choosing. That's no guarantee of success, of course, but
at some point in this bull market  &MD;  maybe now, in fact  &MD;  conviction
should begin to count for more than mere herd-following.
<p>
   Herewith, four fund managers who pass the conviction test give a
sense of how they're applying that discipline today:
<p>
    &MD; Chuck Bath, Nationwide Fund, Columbus, Ohio (phone:
(800)-848-0920): Many Wall Streeters worry that blue-chip drug stocks
are overvalued after their spectacular run since 1994. Chuck Bath's
retort: ``Compared to what?''
<p>
   His highly focused fund of about 50 stocks, up nearly 30 percent
year-to-date, is very heavily weighted with two drug stocks:
Warner-Lambert and Schering Plough, which together make up about 14
percent of the $1.35 billion portfolio.
<p>
   Isn't it time to sell, with Warner-Lambert priced at 30 times
estimated 1998 earnings per share, and Schering at 23 times, versus a
price-to-earnings ratio of about 20 for the typical blue-chip stock in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index?
<p>
   ``Not when I have so much confidence in their earnings growth,''
Bath says of his drug stocks, which he has held for many years. As
long as the market overall stays high, he believes that Warner-Lambert
and Schering deserve their current prices, and more.
<p>
   Less pricey among his major holdings is Mellon Bank, the
Pittsburgh-based banking firm, which sells for a P/E of about 15 based
on estimated 1998 earnings. Bath loves the Mellon franchise and says
of it and other high-quality bank stocks: ``People are still afraid of
the problems the banks had in the 1970s and 1980s (with bad loans),
but that's history. I think these stocks deserve to at least sell for
the market's (P/E).''
<p>
    &MD; Richard Pender, Sentinel Common Stock fund, Montpelier, Vt.
((800)-282-3863): Pender used to feel about Coca-Cola and Gillette the
way Chuck Bath feels about Warner-Lambert. But in early summer, Pender
jettisoned those stocks from his $1.6 billion fund. ``Egregiously
overvalued,'' he says of them.
<p>
   To fill their place in the fund, which is up about 20 percent this
year and which limits itself to between 50 and 60 issues, Pender has
picked up some stocks that aren't household names, but which fit his
definition of undervalued, often under-followed issues that should
post strong returns over a three- to five-year period.
<p>
   One is Canadian Pacific, which is the trans-Canada railway and a
lot more, Pender says. Little-known to many U.S. investors, the
company also is the biggest transatlantic shipping firm, owner of
major resorts, and an energy company  &MD;  all for 11 times estimated 1998
earnings.
<p>
   Pender also likes B.F. Goodrich, which long ago got out of the tire
business and has instead built a big business supplying parts to the
booming aerospace industry. ``They've got tremendous growth potential
and significantly undervalued assets,'' Pender asserts. And at a 1998
estimated P/E of 15, Goodrich is a much cheaper way to play the
aerospace boom than Boeing, Pender notes.
<p>
    &MD; Richard Meagley, Safeco Equity fund, Seattle ((800)-426-6730):
Like Pender, Meagley worries about stock price valuations in a market
that is clearly pushing the edge of the envelope by historical
standards.
<p>
   So he has tried to skew his $1.4-billion fund toward high-quality
stocks that are less likely to be dragged down should the market
suddenly develop a bad case of acrophobia, he says.
<p>
   Anheuser-Busch fills that bill, Meagley says. At 17 times estimated
1998 earnings and sporting an above-average 2.4 percent dividend
yield, he thinks Anheuser is a good way be ``defensive'' yet also play
for decent earnings growth. Ditto for supermarket chain owner American
Stores, which also is a ``cost-cutting'' story that could yield better
earnings growth than the market now expects, Meagley says.
<p>
   The 48-stock fund, up about 20 percent year-to-date, also continues
to hold such blue-chip favorites as Fannie Mae, the mortgage giant.
``I've been adding to things like that &MD; companies you really want to
own looking out five years,'' Meagley says.
<p>
    &MD; Richard Peterson, SteinRoe Special Venture fund, Chicago
((800)-338-2550): Peterson's focus is on smaller stocks, which only in
the last few months have begun to capture more investors' attention,
after lagging blue chips since 1994.
<p>
   ``I think the undervaluation (in smaller stocks) has been
extreme,'' Peterson says. If the number of investors who feel the same
continues to grow, the small-stock rally is likely to persist for some
time to come, he says. ``These kinds of (trends) don't turn off all at
once,'' Peterson says.
<p>
   His fund, up about 14 percent year-to-date, favors such names as
Zytec, a supplier of converters used in computer networking. ``All
they need is for the networking business to grow'' &MD; it doesn't matter
much which of the big networking companies leads the charge, Peterson
says.
<p>
   He also favors a few real estate-related companies, including
property-services firm CB Commercial Real Estate Services, and Spieker
Properties, a big owner of commercial and industrial properties in
California. ``I figure it's your turn out there to grow again,''
Peterson says of the California real estate market.
