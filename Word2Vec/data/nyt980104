   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Sticky.
<p>
   No other word seems to describe Saturday's semifinals of the
$3.65 million Andersen Consulting World Championship more
perfectly.
<p>
   First, favorite Ernie Els got stuck by a cholla cactus on his
way to the 14th tee at Grayhawk Golf Club. Els did manage to rid
himself of the prickly needles but not Colin Montgomerie, whose
steady play earned him a 3-and-2 victory and a spot in today's
36-hole final.
<p>
   Then, Davis Love III did a little ``sticking'' of his own.
Locked in his match with underdog Hajime Meshiai going into the
18th hole, Love hit the flag stick with his approach shot. The ball
nearly landed in the cup before it settled 25 feet away. His
resulting 2-putt birdie eeked out a 1-up win. Love also will get a
shot at the $1 million jackpot.
<p>
   Not to be left out of this sticky situation was ABC television.
Had Meshiai beaten Love, the network would have been stuck with a
mundane final, at least from an American standpoint.
<p>
   Instead, golf fans and ABC were given Montgomerie vs. Love  &MD; 
Europe vs. America. The Ryder Cup might be mentioned once or twice
during today's telecast.
<p>
   But, according to Love, that was then; this is now. Despite
``Monty'' popping off repeatedly about the Americans' chances
during that fateful week in Spain, which ended in a 14{-13{
European victory, there are no hard feelings.
<p>
   ``It was gone in my mind Sunday night,'' Love said, noting that
Montgomerie apologized to the entire American team at the Ryder Cup
banquet that night.
<p>
   Love can only hope that fortunes are reversed when the
championship match gets under way today at 7:50 a.m. Remember,
Montgomerie finished the Ryder Cup with a 3-1-1 record, which
easily could have been 4-1 had he not conceded a 12-foot putt to
Scott Hoch on the last hole. Love, on the other hand, never won a
match in four tries.
<p>
   If there is a favorite this time, it's Monty. The Scottish star
holed six birdies in his match with Els and erased at least some of
the sting of his two runner-up finishes in the U.S. Open to the big
South African.
<p>
   ``Ernie missed a couple of crucial putts, and I made a couple of
crucial putts. That was a 4-shot swing,'' Montgomerie said, citing
the 12th and 16th holes, where twice he was outside of Els and made
birdie while Els could do no better than par.
<p>
   ``I got one back on him today, but there still are a few left to
get.''
<p>
   Els, who felt up to par after his losing battle with the cactus,
said the injury affected his play slightly, ``But Monty really
played well.
<p>
   ``He got his nose up quickly and kept it there,'' said Els, who
managed four birdies of his own but suffered a costly 3-putt bogey
at the 14th.
<p>
   ``After the skirmish with the bushes and the cactuses, I got
three down and didn't have much of a chance after that.''
<p>
   Meshiai stuck like a cholla to Love throughout their encounter,
as the Japanese star led, 2 up, after making three straight birdies
beginning at the second hole.
<p>
   ``I feel like I'm fortunate to get through my first round of the
year in a do-or-die match,'' said Love, who also ended up with six
birdies but kept the Japanese star alive with bogeys at the 16th
and 17th holes. ``Everyone didn't give (Meshiai) enough credit.''
<p>
   Love's superior distance finally proved to be the difference, as
he outdrove Meshiai on the 18th by a conservative 30 yards. But the
7-iron approach from 176 yards was the shot that sealed it.
<p>
   ``(By outdriving him) I was able to cut in a high shot,'' Love
said. ``He had to hit a 4- or a 5-iron, and his came in low and
hooking (and rolled off the back of the green).''
<p>
   Love will need his power game one more time if he is to counter
Montgomerie's accuracy off the tee and pinpoint putting.
<p>
   Not surprisingly, Monty gives himself a bit of an edge in the
match-up, although the Ryder Cup has nothing to do with it, he
said.
<p>
   ``In Britain, we're brought up on more match play than the
Americans,'' he said. ``I've played 36 holes quite often in the
World Match Play (Championship), so I'm used to it.''
<p>
   Love, on the other hand, has not played a 36-hole match since he
won the North-South Amateur in 1984. But he doesn't necessarily
believe that Monty has the advantage.
<p>
   ``If he makes a lot of birdies, he does,'' Love said. ``They
were talking about that (Europeans having an edge in match play) at
the Ryder Cup. But I felt that whoever makes the most putts (would
win), and that's what it came down to.
<p>
   ``Colin is a determined individual,'' Love said. ``He turns
people off sometimes, but I've always enjoyed being around him.''
<p>
   Of course, Love never spent a whole day playing against Monty.
<p>
   ``The more we talk, the more trouble we can get in, and he does
that,'' Love said. ``So I better quit talking about Colin.''

<p>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The record is the obvious way to mark the
progress made by the Arizona State basketball program, but there
are other, more subtle indications.
<p>
   Such as this: The Sun Devils won their Pac-10 opener Saturday,
their first conference victory in nearly a year, and no one was
really happy about it.
<p>
   ``I came into the locker room, and I don't hear a peep out of
these guys,'' ASU Coach Don Newman said after the 84-81 victory
over Southern California at the University Activity Center. ``It
tells me a lot about the character of these guys. I don't think
they were satisfied with their play.''
<p>
   USC came in with a five-game losing streak, but the Trojans have
been hard hit by injuries and only now are starting to reassemble.
The Sun Devils are trying to rise above the multitude of teams that
clearly rank below UCLA, Arizona and Stanford in the Pac-10, as if
to prove the league is something other than the Big Three and the
Seven Dwarves.
<p>
   A victory over USC was necessary toward achieving that. And it
almost didn't happen. The Sun Devils (11-3) built a 12-point lead
in the first half, playing turnover-free for nearly 15 minutes
before a flurry of mistakes made it 40-35 at halftime.
<p>
   In the second half, ASU again went up by a dozen before the
Trojans (4-7, 0-1 Pac-10) chipped away. A three-point shot by
Behzad Souferian  &MD;  his first basket and second shot of the season  &MD; 
brought USC to within one with five seconds left. But Ahlon Lewis
made a pair of free throws, and Gary Johnson's 35-foot
three-pointer at the buzzer to tie bounced off the rim.
<p>
   ``We could have won this game by more,'' ASU guard Eddie House
said. ``We kept letting it slip away.''
<p>
   The Sun Devils, whose last Pac-10 victory happened Jan. 25,
1997, had just one field goal in the final 5:56. But the best
foul-shooting team in the league so far (.756) made 7 of 8 free
throws down the stretch, including the last six, to keep the
Trojans away and get the Sun Devils their fifth straight victory.
<p>
   Last year, ASU was seventh in the Pac-10 in free throw
percentage at .665.
<p>
   ``I thought we shot more free throws last year (in practice)
than we do this year,'' said guard Jeremy Veal, who had 24 points.
``We've got guys who are really concentrating in the games.''
<p>
   Guys like forward Mike Batiste, who was 10 of 12 from the line.
Overall, ASU made 24 of 31 free throws. USC was 12 of 20.
<p>
   ``You have to take care of the free-throw line,'' Newman said.
``It's all part of winning.''
<p>
   The Sun Devils, 10-0 at home, again got points from the usual
suspects. In addition to Veal, Batiste had 20, House 17 and forward
Bobby Lazor 13. Point guard Ahlon Lewis helped make it happen by
dishing 14 assists, his seventh game in double-figures.
<p>
   Lazor added a personal-best 16 rebounds and is averaging 11.4
over his past five games.
<p>
   ``I'm just focusing on going after the ball more and putting a
body on somebody,'' the 6-foot-9 junior said.
<p>
   USC Coach Henry Bibby groused about the officiating  &MD;  ``We
didn't get any calls down the stretch,'' he said  &MD;  but it was the
Sun Devils who had Veal, Batiste and House playing with four fouls
during the final minutes. All survived.
<p>
   They had to because Newman has few options, especially with
Reggie Hester suspended. Batiste played the least among the
starters, 35 minutes, and Lewis went the distance.
<p>
   ``All I can think about is to get to the second half without
getting that third foul,'' Newman said. ``I guess I'm getting
pretty good at it, but I don't like it.''

<p>
   PHOENIX Grant Marron and his juvenile pairs partner, Helen
Thomas, are working in the chill of Oceanside Ice Arena on a death
spiral that proves how fine the line is between tragedy and comedy.
<p>
   The dramatic figure skating spin, when in the learning stage, is
a funniest blooper. It's an ugly duckling that one day will become
a swan, something to laugh about with the child skaters.
<p>
   So, Hal Marron chuckles, remembering when he first tried to
muster enough strength to lower his sister, Lyndy, parallel to the
ice and spin her. He is patient and agrees to a five-minute break
when the 9-year-old Thomas sweetly asks if she and Grant, 13, can
leave the ice to warm up.
<p>
   Marron knows the sport from the entire spectrum. He reached
Olympic alternate as a competitor; was a director of the local
organizing committee that brought the 1993 U.S. Championships to
America West Arena and will seek another nationals for 2002; and is
one of fewer than 20 international-level or world judges in ice
dancing.
<p>
   Although he is not scoring at the nationals beginning today that
will qualify Americans for the Nagano Olympics, Marron is in
Philadelphia: to direct dance judges education, to lobby for the
Valley and to armchair judge, with a much more discerning eye than
the millions of experts that an Olympic year creates.
<p>
   ``With any subjective sport, people feel the judges come in with
preconceived notions,'' Marron said. ``I really don't think they
do. There is a level of skating that the top ones are going to
exude that the bottom ones aren't.''
<p>
   That level begins less with the jumps, or tricks, as Marron
calls them, than with the basic skating: the 4 minutes and 20
seconds for men that holds together the free skate between the 10
seconds spent on jumps.
<p>
   ``That's the hardest part for the general public,'' Marron said.
``The difference in the speed, the flow, the power and just the
basic edge quality. In high jumping or pole vaulting, you don't
care how they get over the bar. In skating, it's not only
completing it, but it's also how well you present what you're
doing.
<p>
   ``When a program is skated well, to the music and the jumps are
part of a harmonious presentation, that's when you sort of get
goose bumps and you really know the program has done something for
you. You're not out there just watching a tennis match where they
go from one end to the other doing jumps, but the program actually
flows together.''
<p>
   Michelle Kwan has that flow and, because of it, an edge over
Tara Lipinski in ladies singles. ``Our strong point is the artistic
side,'' said Kwan's coach, Frank Carroll, who admits the sport is
difficult to judge. ``Some judges are knowledgeable in the arts,
worldly and artistic. Others from smaller countries are not. It's a
difficult sport to pull everyone together.''
<p>
   Marron agrees to a point with Carroll, although a skater can
hurt himself by choosing music that is too esoteric.
<p>
   ``If you're passing out a libretto (words to an opera), you
missed the mark because John Q. Public is not going to know about
the strife between the Finnish farmer and the Finnish goat herder
in 1902, and they're not going to care,'' Marron said.
<p>
   ``It's not whether the judge likes the music or not, but are
they interpreting what they're doing. Sometimes they get so far
out, it's hard to determine.''
<p>
   Primarily because of her jumping, Lipinski defeated Kwan, the
1996 World champion, three times in early 1997 en route to her own
world title.
<p>
   Kwan, 17, seemed to regain dominance at Skate America in
October, but has not competed since Skate Canada in early November,
due to a stress fracture in her left foot. That allows Lipinski,
15, to take the momentum into nationals off a victory before
Christmas at the Champion Series Final.
<p>
   ``You still see normally with Tara that her second mark (for
presentation) is going to be lower than her first (for technical
merit),'' said Marron, who is national-level judge for singles and
pairs. ``She's still a lot stronger jumper,'' although judges will
be watching closely Thursday in the short program to see if
Lipinski takes off on the required back outside edge for her triple
lutz.
<p>
   The Lipinski-Kwan decision at nationals is not critical, Marron
said. Even if Kwan does not perform well because of her injury, she
is a lock to be selected for the Olympics by a U.S. Figure Skating
committee only bound to include the national champion.
<p>
   ``If I were judging that event,'' he said, ``I'd walk in
thinking we have the one and two women in the world, I can't make a
mistake. Either way, I'm right.'' The decisions should always be so
easy.
<p>
   At 1994 nationals, one of a half dozen the 42-year-old Marron
has worked, he landed on the grill for voting Karen Courtland and
Todd Reynolds ahead of Natasha Kuchiki and Rocky Marval in pairs
even though Courtland fell three times and brought Reynolds down
once.
<p>
   Four other judges on the nine-member panel scored
Courtland-Reynolds third, giving them the final U.S. berth at the
Lillehammer Olympics. One judge had them in sixth. Higher
tiebreaking presentation marks by Marron and another judge tipped
the scale.
<p>
   ``They (Courtland-Reynolds) had one big bust,'' Marron said,
``but their overall difficulty was higher. Everything Kuchiki was
doing, she was landing on two feet. It depends how that strikes
you.''
<p>
   At international competitions, like the recent Skate America in
which Marron judged dance, strict controls are in place to monitor
national bias. A judge thought to have favored a skater from his
country must write a letter of explanation that can be accepted by
the judging referee or rejected then referred to the International
Skating Union Technical Committee.
<p>
   ``The mark can't be changed,'' Marron said, ``but the judge can
either be held up from his next appointment or be suspended.''
<p>
   The ISU Council will vote in June on proposals to simplify
scoring, allowing judges to use television replays of the short
program and requiring two different free skate programs each
season.

<p>
   PHOENIX - Mike Tyson is considering a Sedona hotel as a possible
training site, according to a representative for the former
heavyweight champ and a Valley fight manager who said he was asked
to make some tentative arrangements by Tyson promoter Don King.
<p>
   A Tyson manager, either Rory Holloway or John Horne, is expected
to visit the King's Ransom hotel in Sedona today, said Latondia
Lawson, who often makes arrangements for the Tyson entourage.
<p>
   Lawson, of Las Vegas, said she also plans to visit the Sedona
site today with Steve Eisner, a longtime Valley boxing promoter and
manager.
<p>
   Lawson and Eisner said one of Tyson's managers wants to see
whether the hotel and the town are suitable for Tyson's first camp
since his Nevada boxing license was revoked for biting Evander
Holyfield in a June bout.
<p>
   ``It's exploratory,'' said Eisner, who was asked to find an
Arizona site.
<p>
   King had asked for a Valley location, but rooms already are
booked. Lawson said she never has been to Sedona. Warm weather is a
consideration. She said she was not aware of Sedona's chillier
temperatures because of altitude.
<p>
   Nevertheless, indications are that King and Tyson's management
will like Sedona for the potential benefits from altitude training.
The northern Arizona town is also far from the distractions of Las
Vegas, where Tyson has a home and has trained for most of his
recent fights.
<p>
   Neither King nor Tyson managers were available for comment.
<p>
   However, Eisner said he believed that they were close to
choosing Sedona as a camp. As of Saturday, there was an order for
several hundred pounds of boxing equipment and a ring to be shipped
to the hotel.
<p>
   It's not clear whether Tyson has done any training since the
infamous Bite Fight. He also suffered an injury to his ribs in a
motorcycle accident Oct. 29.
<p>
   It's also not clear whether he intends to box or referee pro
wrestling. Some East Coast media have reported that Tyson may
participate as a referee on March 29 in Boston in ``Wrestlemania
XIV,'' a pay-per-view event sponsored by the World Wrestling
Federation.
<p>
   Tyson cannot box in the United States until July. That's when he
can reapply for a Nevada license. Other states will honor the ban,
as required by a federal boxing bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
<p>
   Presumably, the Nevada ban also would be honored in Britain,
Germany, Mexico and other nations where pro boxing is subject to
state regulations.
<p>
   However, that would not preclude Tyson from fighting in
countries such as Japan, where there is no regulation.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Suns swingman George McCloud has been around long
enough to know that a career in the NBA can feel a lot like life
without rules.
<p>
   Even between the baselines, there are cheap calls, unpredictable
bounces, cronyism and lots of uncertainty.
<p>
   Then, there's that world on the other side of those lines. It
can be a free-for-all. Guys kind of make it up as they breeze along
from crossover dribble to fast break to slam dunk to last call.
Going coast to coast without a care or a conscience.
<p>
   It's the caring part that seems to separate McCloud from a
league increasingly known for turnovers and tantrums.
<p>
   If you're searching for a conscience, look into McCloud's dark,
unblinking eyes. Conscience looks back at you as though it were a
challenge. It stares you down.
<p>
   From McCloud, it's the look of a man with an unconditional code.
He says he never complains. And he doesn't. He reminds himself not
to when he sees kids in crowds at arenas, or alone on the street.
<p>
   And on Christmas Day, he remembered it as he never has. That's
when he read an article in ``The Arizona Republic'' about Robert
Davis, a Marcos De Niza basketball player who lost both of his
parents.
<p>
   In the article, McCloud read something about himself. In the
photo of Davis with his friend, Jay Gonzales, McCloud saw himself.
<p>
   McCloud lost both of his parents, too.
<p>
   ``In that story, I saw the day-to-day things that I go
through,'' said McCloud, who said he has contacted Jim and MaryAnn
Gonzales, Jay's parents who have been caring for Davis since his
mom died from cancer. ``My mom died of a heart attack. Two months
later, my dad committed suicide.
<p>
   ``It happened a few years ago. But it's still something I deal
with every day. I have my good moments. I have my bad. And it's not
just something that you can say, `Well, I know how you feel.'
<p>
   ``You have had to have been there. Been through it. I just think
it's something Robert, the Gonzaleses and I can talk about and help
each other. We have a lot in common.''
<p>
   For McCloud, the experience forged him into the player, the
person, he is today. The deaths happened in 1991, while McCloud, a
second-year pro, was with the Indiana Pacers.
<p>
   First, his mom, Verbena, suffered a fatal heart attack in
February, not long after Valentine's Day.
<p>
   ``I remember that I got a chance to see her on Valentine's
Day,'' said McCloud, who broke away from the Pacers on a Southern
swing to visit his mom in Daytona Beach, Fla., his hometown.
``That's strange in a way. Valentine's Day is now my favorite day,
I guess, because that's the last time I saw my mom.''
<p>
   In late March, his father, George, distraught at the loss of his
wife, took his own life.
<p>
   ``All of a sudden, nothing about the way I thought was the same
anymore,'' said McCloud. ``Here I was a young man. I was living my
life the way a lot of young guys in the NBA do. I had money and I
spent it. I had cars, clothes, the whole bit.
<p>
   ``But with my mom and dad gone, none of that mattered anymore.
If I could give up all of the money and more for the just one of
them to come back, I would.''
<p>
   During the next few years, basketball pursuits became less
important for McCloud, now 30.
<p>
   ``I learned not to live basketball, but to play it,'' he said.
<p>
   Then came the injuries. After undergoing reconstructive surgery
on a thumb and further surgery on both ankles during the 18 months
after his parents died, Indiana waived him.
<p>
   In the fall of 1993, he suddenly found himself in the Italian
League. He didn't understand Italian. He was far from home, but the
memory of his parents were hauntingly near. He missed his five
brothers and two sisters.
<p>
   A year later, he was riding a bus as a member of the Continental
Basketball Association's franchise in Rapid City, S.D. He was in
the bush leagues. But he was closer to home.
<p>
   Then he hooked on with the Dallas Mavericks. He was back in the
bigs. But he had changed. This was no ordinary journeyman.
<p>
   ``I saw something different in him than any other veteran the
day he got to Dallas,'' said Jason Kidd, a former Mavs guard who
immediately became McCloud's friend. ``I knew what had happened to
him. I've always been impressed with him. He never complained about
anything in Dallas. He never complains about anything here.
<p>
   ``He's learned there are more important things in life. He's
emotionally strong in that he understands himself. He knows who he
is. This team can draw from his kind of personal strength.''
<p>
   Not everything has gone as expected for McCloud in Phoenix.
Coach Danny Ainge's switching lineups and continuing search for
combinations often have left him feeling as though he's at the end
of a yo-yo string. He doesn't play one week; he's a starter the
next.
<p>
   At times he talks about the frustration of not having the time
to find the rhythm for his shot, an NBA record setter from the
three-point line when accurate.
<p>
   ``I'm just going to have to play well enough that I'll make
Danny Ainge play me,'' said McCloud, who, because of injuries, is
probably back in the rotation today as the Suns open a three-game
trip at Washington.
<p>
   But complain? Never.
<p>
   He has an uncompromising code to follow.
<p>
   And Robert Davis to guide.

 &UR; COACH AINGE IS JUST AS FIERY AS PLAYER AINGE &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   We've seen a lot of evidence from Suns Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge that
he is just as competitive as he was during a 14-year playing
career.
<p>
   Example: Most former Boston Celtics seem to revere the
organization and its tradition. Ainge said this year, ``They're the
enemy.''
<p>
   Example: His penchant for fiddling with his starting lineup and
not making the announcement until the final possible moment.
Strategy or gamesmanship? Ainge will look for any advantage.
<p>
   The latest example: After assistant coach  &UR; Donn Nelson decided
he would leave the Suns to spend two seasons as a Mavericks
assistant, then take over as Dallas head coach, Nelson let Ainge
know that he wanted to finish this season with the Suns.
<p>
   While Nelson and the Suns said that Nelson was given the
``opportunity'' to leave immediately, the truth is that Ainge was
not going to have an outsider in his camp for the rest of the
season.
<p>
   ``It was awkward,'' Ainge admitted. ``I just look at him
different. He's a Dallas Maverick. Once he made the decision to go
in that direction, it was best that he get on with it.''
<p>
   Nelson watched the Suns-Mavericks game Friday night after the
announcement from Section 122 in America West Arena.
<p>
   That's not to say that Ainge isn't appreciative of Nelson, whom
he inherited from  &UR; Cotton Fitzsimmons' staff.
<p>
   ``He was big for me last year,'' Ainge said. ``He saved me. I
relied on him a lot. Assistants play a big part, and I leaned on
Donnie a lot.''
<p>
   Ainge will go for now with assistants  &UR; Scott Skiles and  &UR; Frank
Johnson, but the days of an under-40 Phoenix bench likely are over.
Ainge said experience will be the top priority in his next hire. He
has a man in mind, whom he said most people won't be excited about.
<p>
   ``But I will,'' he said. ``I've always thought a lot of him as a
basketball coach.
<p>
   ``I want somebody with coaching experience, not NBA experience.
I've got plenty of NBA experience, and so do Frank and Scotty. This
isn't going to be a (public relations) hire. This is going to be
someone I trust and believe in a great deal. It's a hire for me.''
<p>
   Ainge isn't saying who it might be.
<p>
   ``I haven't talked to him yet,'' Ainge said. ``I hate to say
anything until I talk to him first.''
<p>
It's really bad
<p>
Just in case you're wondering, the Denver Nuggets are on pace to
have the worst record in league history. Going into Saturday
night's game in Minnesota, the Nuggets were 2-27, a .069 winning
percentage, and had lost 12 in a row. &HT;    At this rate, they'll finish with a 6-76 record, surpassing the
1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers for the worst record ever. Those Sixers
were 9-73, a .110 percentage.
<p>
   On the night the Nuggets celebrated their 30th anniversary, Utah
thumped them by 33 points, causing some of the club's former
luminaries to leave early.
<p>
    &UR; Dean Garrett, who signed with Denver as a free agent in the
summer, said the club is loaded with selfish players.
<p>
   ``I think too many are into that piece of paper, looking at
their stats. . . . When you get that kind of thought in your mind,
you're getting blitzed. You're getting taken out every night.''
<p>
Tick, tick, tick
<p>
It can only be a matter of time for Detroit Coach  &UR; Doug Collins,
who has lost the Pistons. &HT;    The most recent flare-up came during a game against Toronto when
outspoken center  &UR; Brian Williams twice yelled at Collins to be
quiet during a timeout. Williams said Collins was complaining that
Williams was concentrating on his personal statistics (maybe
because he's a former Nugget).
<p>
   ``I don't know where that came from,'' Williams said. ``Do I
look like I'm playing for numbers out there? Doug's got something
to say on every single play, and he's going to tell me that I'm
playing for numbers? (Expletive) that!''
<p>
   Collins said he was talking to all the Pistons, not Williams in
particular.
<p>
   Williams later apologized for taking his complaint public.
<p>
   ``It was an inter-team affair that should have stayed there,''
he said.
<p>
Frankly speaking
<p>
New York Coach  &UR; Jeff Van Gundy isn't ready to lay all of his club's
problems on a season-ending wrist injury suffered by  &UR; Patrick
Ewing. &HT;    ``I said this to the team: Frankly, we weren't very good with
Patrick, either,'' Van Gundy said. ``We were 15-11, and now we just
have less margin for error. The bottom line is that until our
commitment level changes, we won't be very good.''
<p>
Rap-ture
<p>
Former Arizona star  &UR; Damon Stoudamire is about fed up with the
Toronto Raptors. The club has gone into the tank this season, and
Stoudamire, a free agent next summer, is going to be long gone on
July 1. &HT;    ``If this was my team, I'd be changing something,'' Stoudamire
said recently. ``But I'm not running things. I don't know what's
going on at the top.''
<p>
Birds of a feather
<p>
Indiana Coach  &UR; Larry Bird got his first look at New Jersey's  &UR; Keith
Van &UR; Horn as a pro recently, but he downplayed the comparisons that
are being made between Van Horn and Bird.
<p>
   ``It's just because we're both white,'' Bird said.
<p>
   Van Horn, despite missing a month at the start of the season,
already is looking like a possible Rookie of the Year.
<p>
   ``When I came in, it was  &UR; Rick Barry all the time,'' Bird said.
``I had never really seen Barry ever play basketball, so I just
went out and tried to play my own style and make a name for
myself.''
<p>
Forget about it
<p>
Sources say that the Golden State Warriors have requested a copy of
a taped interview that the ``San Francisco Chronicle's''  &UR; David
Steele conducted with  &UR; Latrell Sprewell after he attacked Golden
State Coach &UR; P.J. Carlesimo. Apparently, the Warriors want the tape
for the arbitration hearing this month in Portland that will
determine whether Sprewell's one-year suspension and terminated
contract will stand.
<p>
   The ``Chronicle'' refused the Warriors' request.

 &UR; SHARE THE BLAME IN KILGER REFUSAL TO GO TO MINORS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB MCMANAMAN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 The Arizona Republic &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Coyotes center  &UR; Chad Kilger is making a mistake, perhaps a
career-damaging one, by refusing his assignment to the minor
leagues.
<p>
   But NHL teams are just as much to blame for pushing young
players like Kilger up the ranks and snatching them from juniors a
year or two ahead of time.
<p>
   In Kilger's case, it's not the Coyotes' fault. The Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim, who drafted him with the fourth overall pick in 1995,
threw him into the NHL at age 19 when he clearly wasn't ready.
<p>
   But, after appearing in 74 NHL games that year, Kilger obviously
has a different opinion. So do scores of other top prospects, who
are finding themselves getting sent down to the minors for more
seasoning after failing to produce at the NHL level.
<p>
   Their teams give them a false sense of security. The player
feels betrayed. In some occasions, like Kilger's, it can result in
the player threatening to sit out the season or quitting the game
altogether.
<p>
   Interestingly, the Chicago Blackhawks were prepared to send
defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney and a first-round draft pick to Phoenix
last week for the 6-foot-4 Kilger, a player they have coveted for
the past three years.
<p>
   Chicago, though, reportedly backed out of the deal at the last
minute.
<p>
   ``He's a young kid and I think he's making the wrong decision,''
Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said. ``And if he's being advised to
do this, I think it's the wrong advice. The best opportunity for
Chad Kilger to improve as a hockey player is to play hockey. And
he's taking that opportunity away from himself.''
<p>
   In the future, look for NHL clubs to take that decision-making
process out of the players' hands. General Managers, if they're
wise, will leave prospects in their respective junior leagues for
all four years, if necessary.
<p>
   It not only makes sense from a development aspect, but it also
protects the team. One or two more years in juniors is one or two
more years the club doesn't have to pay another skyrocketing
salary. It's also one or two more years that the player is kept
from being exposed to the annual waiver draft and, more
importantly, the four upcoming expansion drafts.
<p>
   Of course, there are exceptions. Sometimes, 18- and 19-year-old
phenoms are ready for the NHL.
<p>
   ``But only in very rare instances does it work,'' Coyotes GM
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith said. `` &UR; Mario Lemieux should not have been playing juniors
when he was 19 (in 1983-84). He could have scored 100 points in the
league that year.''
<p>
   The retired Pittsburgh Penguins star scored 282 points for Laval
that season (133 goals, 149 assists) in just 70 games.
<p>
   What's to become of the 21-year-old Kilger? He's supposed to
inform the Coyotes of his final decision on Monday. Either he will
report to Springfield (Mass.) or he will spend the rest of the
season pouting at home in Ontario.
<p>
The trade &HT;    The Edmonton Oilers had no choice but to trade defenseman  &UR; Bryan
 &UR; Marchment. He's simply been involved in too many questionable
knee-on-knee hits this season, including two recent ones that
sidelined  &UR; Mike Modano and  &UR; Greg Adams of Dallas.
<p>
   Tampa Bay took him, along with  &UR; Steve Kelly and draft bust
 &UR; Jason
 &UR; Bonsignore, for  &UR; Roman Hamrlik and draft choice  &UR; Paul Comrie.
<p>
   ``He was the toughest man I ever met,'' Oilers Coach  &UR; Ron Low
said, ``but he was a marked man with the NHL home office.''
<p>
   Many believe Marchment's next questionable hit will draw a
lengthy suspension.
<p>
   ``I'm going to play this way until they bury me 6 feet under,''
Marchment said, ``whether that's in a beer league or wherever.''
<p>
   Colorado's  &UR; Adam Foote said it's impossible to tell if Marchment
intentionally tries to injure opposing players.
<p>
   ``I don't know if he's trying to do it or if that's just the way
he plays,'' Foote said. ``I hope he doesn't mean to go for guys'
knees. I don't think there's too many guys in the league that do
that. There are guys who say he does go for the knees, but I don't
know. I haven't seen him do it too much, but I know he's an
open-ice hitter.''
<p>
Devil of a season &HT;     &UR; Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils has a shot to become
only the third goalie to win the Triple Crown since the NHL began
tracking save percentage in 1982-83.
<p>
   Brodeur entered the weekend leading the league in wins (23),
goals-against average (1.79), and save percentage (.925). The
others to do it: Philadelphia  &UR; Bob Froese
<p>
   (1985-86) and  &UR; Eddie Belfour, then of Chicago (in 1990-91).
<p>
   Brodeur also has a chance to threaten  &UR; Bernie Parent's 1973-74
record for wins in a season (47) and can become the first goalie in
32 years since Detroit's  &UR; Terry Sawchuk and Toronto's  &UR; Harry Lumley
to record goals-against averages under 2.00 in back-to-back years.
<p>
   And just think, Colorado's  &UR; Patrick Roy, not Brodeur, is
expected to be Team Canada's starting goalie in the Olympics next
month.
<p>
   ``I don't care what people say, I'm sure going to make their
decision as difficult as I can,'' Brodeur said.
<p>
Slap shots &HT;     &UR; Brett Hull all but made it official. The St. Louis Blues star
said he is nearly ``100 percent'' certain he will not be back with
the club next season when he becomes an unrestricted free agent.
<p>
   He'll end up where his father, Bobby, spent most of his career,
in Chicago. Count on it.
<p>
    &MD; Calgary enforcer  &UR; Mike Peluso, who gained his notoriety with
Chicago and New Jersey, on retiring last week due to a degenerative
spinal condition:
<p>
   ``The doctors said one hit could be catastrophic. One hit the
right way and I could be a quadriplegic. . . . Any contact sports
are now dangerous. You play your whole life and one day you have an
MRI and it's over.''
<p>
    &MD; New Jersey's  &UR; Doug Gilmour apparently bit Blackhawks defenseman
 &UR; Eric
 &UR; Weinrich in the right hand during a scrum that developed Tuesday
during Chicago's 6-2 rout.
<p>
   It could have been a lot worse than it was.
<p>
   ``He didn't have his teeth in,'' Weinrich said.
<p>
    &MD; Remember when Coyotes wing  &UR; Rick Tocchet said Calgary's  &UR; Theo
Fleury should win the ``best supporting actress'' award for the way
he flopped during a retaliatory hit in Phoenix, a payback for
Fleury's knee-on-knee collision with  &UR; Mike Gartner?
<p>
   ``Sure, I'll take the Oscar,'' Fleury quipped last week. ``Hey,
I might have been acting, but he tried to take out my knee.''

<p>
   PHOENIX - Steven Gluckstern and his family sat in the stands
Saturday night at America West Arena, pulling for the team he owns
to lose to the New York Islanders.
<p>
   Go figure, eh?
<p>
   Technically, Gluckstern still owns the Coyotes. But shortly into
the NHL All-Star break (Jan. 18), the league is expected to approve
his agreement with Richard Burke to sever his 50 percent ownership
of the Coyotes, then will approve his majority purchase of the
Islanders.
<p>
   ``It's a strange feeling,'' said Gluckstern, whose proposed
purchase of the Islanders was made before the season started. ``I'm
a little melancholy. I still have a lot of feeling for the Coyotes
organization and the players. My family and I poured a lot of
ourselves into the team. I'll always know I was part of starting a
great tradition in the Valley.
<p>
   ``My family likes to wear jerseys to the games, but they made a
rule about this game  &MD;  no jerseys. They told me that it's good the
Coyotes are in the Western Conference and the Islanders are in the
East, so they can continue to root for the Coyotes in all but two
games a year.''
<p>
   Gluckstern, a former teacher, hasn't taken an active role in the
daily operation of his new franchise, but he has spent a great deal
of time acquainting himself with the organization, its players and
Long Island.
<p>
   ``I'm enjoying myself, but I will even more when the deal is
finally approved,'' he said. ``The job we face is a little
different than the one we had when Richard and I brought the
Coyotes to Phoenix.
<p>
   ``We were trying to establish a new sport in a new town. But the
Islanders have a fabulous tradition. The job we face is rekindling
that tradition, and we do have a good, young team.''
<p>
   Gluckstern said with the New York Rangers struggling, the
Islanders have a perfect opportunity to regain footing, and he
plans to adopt a ``Back to the Future'' marketing approach.
<p>
   ``With the economics in today's game, we do face a stadium
challenge. The one we have (Nassau Coliseum) is 25 years old,'' he
said. ``But we have a 70-acre parcel, where our current building
is, and it is being made available for a new building.
<p>
   ``We're averaging 11,000 to 12,000 fans per game, but we can
seat 16,000. Our job is to move the franchise ahead while reviving
our tradition and remembering the early 1980s and our four Stanley
Cup championships.
<p>
   ``We have three NHL hockey teams in close proximity  &MD;  the
Rangers, Devils and Islanders  &MD;  and, like here, a number of pro
franchises in competition. But if we do our job properly, I think
the Islanders can once again become the heart and soul of Long
Islanders, as they were before.
<p>
   ``We want to make an Islanders ticket a cool ticket to have
again.''
<p>
   Gluckstern reiterated he was happy in partnership with Burke,
and the two easily reached terms on the buyout. As a native New
Yorker, when the opportunity with the Islanders arose, Gluckstern
said he and Burke agreed it made sense for each to have his own
show.
<p>
   The NHL faces some stiff economic challenges. Salaries are
escalating while television revenue remains low compared to other
sports. Unlike in the NFL and, to a degree, the NBA, the teams
don't share revenue. Also, a theory exists that the game is too
low-scoring to be television-friendly.
<p>
   ``The answers to the questions we face are long and
complicated,'' he said. ``As business people, it's important we
(owners) don't act stupidly. When expenses increase faster than
incoming revenue, eventually you're going to run out of money.
Salaries can't continue to escalate among all the players.
<p>
   ``I think you'll see a small number of elite players making
significant money, but most of the rest probably won't. I'd like to
see more scoring because it's more exciting for the fans. I'm just
as happy watching a 0-0 game. I've heard all the different ideas,
like moving the goals closer together and eliminating the center
line, but I'll leave those decisions to the hockey people.''

<p>
   It appears another Cuban pitcher will soon make his way to the
major leagues.
<p>
   The defection of  &UR; Orlando Hernandez, the half brother of Florida
Marlins star  &UR; Livan Hernandez, almost certainly means some club
will sign the older Hernandez to a contract that will put him in a
major league uniform, possibly as soon as this season.
<p>
   Talk among baseball scouts is that Orlando, or ``El Duque,'' as
he is known in Cuba, has seen his best days pass him by. He claims
he's 28, but that's the same age Cuban national team officials
listed him at five years ago.
<p>
   Orlando's lifetime record before he was barred from playing in
Cuba was 129-47. His fastball used to register in the low 90 mph
range, and he has excellent control. In all likelihood, the older
Hernandez will amount to no more than a marginal big league
pitcher.
<p>
   So, another Cuban will join the major leagues and be looked down
upon, much like  &UR; Rene Arocha and  &UR; Ariel Prieto have been since they
joined the big leagues.
<p>
   There was a time when being a Cuban-born pitcher meant
something. But that was when the likes of  &UR; Luis Tiant, Camilo
Pasqual and  &UR; Pedro Ramos were sprinkled throughout the majors. And
don't forget  &UR; Adolfo Luque, who won 193 games in 20 seasons,
including 27 in 1923 for Cincinnati.
<p>
Dodging value
<p>
   Maybe it's the holdup of the club's sale to  &UR; Rupert Murdoch and
the bunch at the FOX network. Whatever the reason, the Los Angeles
Dodgers have done virtually nothing this off-season. At the very
least, they've done less than any of the other clubs in the
National League West.
<p>
   The Dodgers only significant move was adding shortstop  &UR; Jose
Vizcaino for the retired  &UR; Greg Gagne. Otherwise, there's little to
report.
<p>
   Los Angeles' bench, a source of considerable mediocrity last
season, remains a shambles. Last season the Dodgers bench consisted
of  &UR; Eric
 &UR; Anthony, Billy Ashley, Juan Castro, Tripp Cromer, Wayne Kirby,
Nelson
 &UR; Liriano and  &UR; Tom Prince. This year's bench is expected to be the
same except for the addition of  &UR; Trinidad Hubbard and  &UR; Ricky Otero
to replace Kirby and Liriano.
<p>
   Otherwise,  &UR; Antonio Osuna, who has yet to complete a full major
league season, is the leading candidate to take over from  &UR; Todd
Worrell as the club's closer. Osuna has four career saves and there
is questions about his demeanor.
<p>
   The outfield? Other than  &UR; Raul Mondesi, Dodgers fans better
start hoping for salvation.  &UR; Roger Cedeno and  &UR; Todd Hollandsworth
are expected to take over in center and left, respectively. Both
spent solid chunks of time at Triple A Albuquerque last season. Oh,
yeah, and  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Piazza, a free agent after this season, wants a multiyear contract
worth at least $100 million.
<p>
Trouble? Call me
<p>
   Cincinnati Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, who was summoned to help the
struggling Reds after they canned  &UR; Ray Knight last summer, on how
he envisions his job with the Reds, who have given McKeon a
one-year contract:
<p>
   ``I think of myself as a corporate troubleshooter guy,'' he
said. ``If a club is screwed up, I come in and straighten it up.''
<p>
The rumor mill
<p>
   Atlanta was ready to trade either  &UR; Denny Neagle or  &UR; Ryan Klesko
to Minnesota for second baseman  &UR; Chuck Knoblauch, who has made it
clear he wants out of the Twin Cities. But with  &UR; John Smoltz's
status uncertain because of elbow surgery, the Braves held back for
now.
<p>
    &MD; Meanwhile, the Yankees remain interested, but are unwilling to
part with the players the Twins seek, a combination of two of the
following: pitchers  &UR; Ramiro Mendoza and  &UR; Milton Lewis and
outfielder
 &UR; Ricky Ledee.
<p>
    &MD; Now that pitcher  &UR; Andy Benes has dropped his pursuit of that
five-year $30 million deal with St. Louis he is officially a free
agent. The New York Mets are expected to jump in and try to sign
the pitcher with a 104-94 career record in nine seasons.
<p>
    &MD; Even though he turned down a $2.5 million option for the 1998
season, indications from Cincinnati point to  &UR; Deion Sanders
returning to the Reds as their leadoff hitter and center fielder
next season.
<p>
Extra bases
<p>
   With  &UR; Mickey Morandini now with the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia's
remaining players from the 1993 N.L. championship club are pitcher
 &UR; Curt Schilling and outfielder  &UR; Lenny Dykstra, who is attempting a
comeback.
<p>
    &MD; Six weeks before Pittsburgh opens spring training, the Pirates
have four of their five rotation spots sewn up by  &UR; Francisco
Cordova, Jon
 &UR; Lieber, Esteban Loaiza and  &UR; Jason Schmidt.
<p>
    &MD; Colorado has a pair of players in its organization with some
impressive bloodlines. First baseman  &UR; Chris Kirgan is a fourth
cousin of  &UR; Ty Cobb, and  &UR; Edgard Velasquez is the nephew of  &UR; Roberto
Clemente.
<p>
The final word
<p>
   This score just in from South Florida: The Marlins have traded
or released nine players (plus another who was taken in the
expansion draft in  &UR; Tony Saunders) from their World Series
championship club and trimmed more than $22 million in payroll. How
about a big hand for a man who has done so much for baseball in a
short time:  &UR; Wayne Huizenga, ladies and gentlemen.

   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Scotland's Colin Montgomerie walked to the
14th tee during Saturday's semifinals of the Andersen Consulting
World Championship of Golf holding a 2-up lead and promptly donned
his sweater to beat the growing cold.
<p>
   His opponent, South African Ernie Els, elected to have minor
surgery instead.
<p>
   Between the 13th green and 14th tee box at Grayhawk's Raptor
Course, Els' left hand came too close to a cholla, and the little
Sonoran fur ball jumped into the middle finger of his left hand.
<p>
   ``I didn't get into the cactus, the cactus got me,'' said Els,
who three-putted to bogey the hole to fall 3 down and eventually
lose to Montgomerie, 3 and 2. ``I'm walking from the green to the
tee, and the next thing I know, it's in my hand and I can't get it
out. A little ball with pins in it. Another guy had to get the
needles (three) out, and I looked on in observation.''
<p>
   Cholla needles have small barbs at the end, not to mention a
poisonous substance. They are not removed easily or without pain.
<p>
   ``Of course, it bothered me,'' Els said of his game from there
on. ``I was 2 down, and I certainly didn't need that. I wasn't
playing well. It just flew into my hand. Didn't help my poise,
either. Yeah, it bothered me.''
<p>
   It was the first time Els has courted cholla, even though his
native South Africa has its share of thorny flora, not to mention
deadly black mamba snakes.
<p>
   ``It was my first time out here . . . as you go on, you learn,''
he said, chuckling. ``When I came here, I was thinking about the
game. I gave the cactus a lot of room after that. They really
should cut those things out of the golf course. It could happen to
anybody. When I was getting mine removed, there was a lady nearby
who had the same thing happen.
<p>
   ``I'd rather battle the cactus (than a mamba) . . . at least,
you live after the cactus bites you.''
<p>
   Montgomerie, ranked seventh in the world, jumped to a 2-up lead
after four holes and never surrendered the lead, closing out Els
with a 40-foot birdie putt on No. 16. The Scot can't recall having
an opponent attacked by finicky foliage before in competition.
<p>
   ``No, it's the first time . . . and probably the last,'' he
said, grinning. ``We played a few practice rounds here, but we
always rode in carts. I didn't know how dangerous it is. These
courses are built for carts. The paths are small, and they really
should offer protection.
<p>
   ``I don't think it affected him too much. He hit a 320-yard
drive off that tee.''
<p>
   Don't get the idea that Els was blaming the cactus for why he'll
be meeting Japan's Hajime Meshiai, a 1-up loser to American Davis
Love, in today's consolation finals, while Love and Montgomerie
clash.
<p>
   ``No, Monty played well,'' he said. ``He got off to a good start
like I wanted. He got his nose up quickly and went from there. I
wasn't aggressive enough. Maybe I was rusty from the holidays.''
<p>
   Els, the world's No. 4-ranked player, said he thought he was
back in the match after a birdie on No. 9 brought him back to 1
down, but after hitting a solid second shot to within 12 feet at
the 10th green, Montgomerie's shot to within 4 feet covered him.
<p>
   Els missed. Monty didn't. Els was 2 down.
<p>
   Els cut Montgomery's lead to 1 up at No. 11 with a 4-foot birdie
putt. But he dropped shots at No. 12, when Montgomery dropped an
18-footer for birdie while Els missed from 17 feet, and again on
the cactus-plagued 14th, when he three-putted from 90 feet. Monty's
long snake on No. 16 sealed his fate.
<p>
   ``I thought I had a chance after my birdie on No. 9,'' Els said.
``The putt on No. 12 really got me. I missed it, and it was easy. I
thought if I could get it down to 1 down on No. 16, I was back in
it. I had a 10-footer, but he rolled in that long one.
<p>
   ``He made six birdies, and I had four birdies and two bogeys.
You don't win in match play with two bogey. Hats off to him. He
played better than I did.''

16-YEAR-OLD MAKES PITCH FOR MILLIONS &QL;

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  As it all too often is in baseball, the
speculation has been wild.
<p>
   Ricardo Aramboles will get $3 million. Maybe $5 million.
Wouldn't the Yankees pay $10 million?
<p>
   All Rob Plummer will say is this:
<p>
   ``What is a kid worth when he could be the next Pedro
Martinez?''
<p>
   We'll find out later this month.
<p>
   Plummer, the agent for 16-year-old pitcher Ricardo Aramboles,
will host a workout for the young Dominican the fourth week of
January in Tampa, Fla. Plummer has spoken with every major-league
club and all have said they will attend. He expects teams such as
the Yankees, Blue Jays and Dodgers to send multiple scouts to watch
Aramboles, a right-hander in possession of a 91-mph fastball and a
knuckle-curve.
<p>
   Plummer has Aramboles under wraps to the extent that he let
teams know if they attempted to contact his client it would be held
against them. The Dodgers made such a mistake, but Plummer forgave
them after a talk with scouting director Terry Reynolds. Aramboles
is currently with family in the Dominican Republic.
<p>
   Aramboles, who is 6-foot-4 and stocked with wiry muscles just
like Martinez, is back on the market because major-league baseball
ruled last month that in July of 1996 the Florida Marlins illegally
signed him. It was illegal because Aramboles was just 14 at the
time.
<p>
   The Philadelphia-based Plummer counts 22 Latins among his 25
clients. He and others say the practice of signing underage players
(younger than 16) is rampant in the Dominican and Venezuela.
<p>
   Whatever Aramboles gets as a result of this workout, it will be
hundreds times more than the $5,500 the Marlins signed him for in
1996.
<p>
   ``I'm not putting a money value on him,'' Plummer said. ``I'm
going to let the free market prevail. One thing I know is this kid
is very talented. I'm not going to let them tell me he's not as
good as I say.''
<p>
   Now or never? Hopefully, Don Sutton got the nine votes he was
missing last year for election into the Hall of Fame. Because if
Sutton is not in the 1998 Hall of Fame induction class, which will
be announced Monday, he may never get voted in.
<p>
   Among those eligible next year is Nolan Ryan.
<p>
   The knock on Sutton, who pitched for the Dodgers from 1966 to
'80 and again in 1988, is that it took him 23 seasons to amass his
324 victories and he had just one 20-win season.
<p>
   Yes, Sutton's winning percentage of .559 is underwhelming, but
anyone with 324 victories deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Also Monday: On the day of their first voluntary winter workout,
the Dodgers will exchange arbitration figures with Raul Mondesi and
Eric Young.
<p>
   Predictions: Mondesi will not make it to arbitration, because
the Dodgers will meet his contract demands of at least six years at
$10 million per. Young's case will go to arbitration, and he will
win a one-year contract for around $5 million.

<p>
   San Francisco  &MD;  The Minnesota Vikings cut a deal with the
Cardinals. In exchange for Arizona sunshine this week and the use
of the Tempe facility the Vikings let the Cardinals wear their
uniforms Saturday.
<p>
   The absence of a running game, and defensive breakdowns, gave
the purple-helmeted impostors away.
<p>
   ``People said all year we haven't played anybody,'' Ken Norton,
the two-fisted San Francisco linebacker, said, smiling from beneath
the brim of his cowboy hat after his team's 38-22 victory.
<p>
   The 49ers still haven't. Their defenseless opponent in this
tuneup for next Sunday's NFC championship game didn't look like a
playoff team. The Vikings made the postseason only because 12 teams
are required to participate, under the NFL's watered-down format,
whether they are deserving or not.
<p>
   The Vikings are better than the Cardinals. They proved it, too,
punishing the Cardinals, 20-19, in Tempe.
<p>
   But how did this team survive this long? The Cardinals won more
games (2) than the Vikings did (1) over the last six weeks of the
regular season. If not for an injury to Jim Harbaugh  &MD;  when the
Indianapolis backup, third-team quarterback Kelly Holcomb came into
the game the Colts committed five turnovers in 15 plays  &MD;  Minnesota
likely would have dropped its last six games and and finished 8-8,
its season over.
<p>
   But here they were, after an inspired comeback last week, or a
New York Giants collapse if you prefer, hoping to match talent
against a quality team against whom they had no chance.
This season the 49ers are unbeaten at home. Steve Young is the most
efficient quarterback in the NFL. Statistically, San Francisco's
defense is the league's best. &HT;    By comparison, the Vikings defense is dreadful. Minnesota gave
up more yards per play (5.5 yards) than any other NFL team. The
Vikes' only hope was to out-touchdown the 49ers and they couldn't
do that, although quarterback Randall Cunningham tried his best,
reaching back like a javelin thrower and going deep.
<p>
   The outcome was predictable. Young played pitch-and-catch with
his receivers. The Vikings couldn't cover them. After a slow start,
the Niners scored whenever they needed to. They didn't miss their
1,000-yard runner, Garrison Hearst (remember him?), who is injured
and didn't play.
<p>
   This was as lopsided as a lobster boil. The Niners toyed with
the Vikings. Terry Kirby ran for 120 yards, scoring twice. J.J.
Stokes extended his long arms and caught nine passes. On one
series, rather than punt on fourth-and-one, Young rolled out and
tossed a 16-yard pass for a first down to his reliable tight end,
Brent Jones. Young called the dissection ``a nice display of who we
are.''
<p>
   The game was over in the first half when the Niners scored 14
points in less than a minute. The play of the game came when safety
Tim McDonald (remember him?) blitzed, and Cunningham threw off his
back foot. Norton intercepted, ran 23 yards into the end zone and
then celebrated the 21-7 lead by striking a prize-fighter's pose
and throwing a flurry of punches at the padding that covers the
base of one goal post. The linebacker worked away  &MD;  left, right,
left right. His antics brought to mind Sylvester Stallone pounding
a side of Grade A beef in ``Rocky'' or Norton's father, Ken, a
former heavyweight champion, working on the heavy bag in the gym
during his prime.
This was a mismatch. The Vikings lacked the skill to defend
themselves. Afterward Dennis Green, the Minnesota coach, said ``My
hat's off'' to San Francisco, although he left his on his head. &HT;    It's a good bet Green soon will exchange his cap for one bearing
Oakland colors, assuming Joe Bugel (remember him?) is fired. It's a
better bet the Super Bowl champion will be identified here next
week.

O'NEAL ACTS LIKE A KID IN PRACTICE &QL;

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Practice was over, but Shaquille O'Neal still
wanted to play.
<p>
   After all, he had 22 points and nine rebounds Friday night in
his first game in six weeks and experienced no day-after soreness
in the strained abdominal muscle that forced him to miss much of
the season.
<p>
   So as he came off the court Saturday at L.A. Southwest College,
O'Neal playfully wrestled strength and conditioning coach Jim Cotta
for several minutes in front of his Lakers teammates and startled
coach Del Harris.
<p>
   ``You don't really like to see that,'' Harris said, almost
smiling. ``But he's a big kid. That's just him.''
<p>
   O'Neal briefly considered the pay-per-view potential of the
impromptu bout, then turned to more important matters. Unlike the
day after his Nov. 7 return against the New York Knicks, the
abdomen appears sound.
<p>
   ``The difference between this time and the last time is that I'm
in better shape,'' O'Neal said. ``The last time I just rested. This
time I rested and rehabbed. There is no more pain.''
<p>
   O'Neal came off the bench in Friday's 116-106 victory over
Atlanta and played 24 minutes. Team doctors don't want him to play
any more than that for now. Harris wouldn't speculate whether
O'Neal will start tonight against the lowly Philadelphia 76ers at
the Forum.
<p>
   ``I'll let the Sixers think about that for a while,'' he said.
<p>
   More Shaq: O'Neal missed his first four free throws against
Atlanta. But he showed excellent mobility all night, hitting a
10-foot jumper and going over the Lakers' bench after a loose ball.
``He has been shooting free throws well in practice,'' Harris said,
``but in the games his legs straighten out and he loses his
rhythm.''... O'Neal's comeback came with the usual trappings. After
Saturday's practice, he shot a promotional video for Pepsi with
Lisa Leslie of the WNBA's L.A. Sparks.

<p>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  &MD;  They'll meet again, the coach and the
opposing player, so entangled and entwined.
<p>
   Until Marty Schottenheimer, coach of the Kansas City Chiefs,
takes a team to the Super Bowl, he's going to be known for his
playoff failures, two created by Denver Broncos quarterback John
Elway.
<p>
   It was Elway who engineered ``The Drive'' in the 1987 AFC
Championship game to beat Schottenheimer's Cleveland Browns.
<p>
   A year later, the Broncos again beat Schottenheimer's Browns in
the AFC title game, a contest that became famous for ``The Fumble''
by Cleveland running back Earnest Byner.
<p>
   In nine seasons at Kansas City, Schottenheimer has guided the
Chiefs to the playoffs seven times but never has met Elway in the
postseason until today.
<p>
   The Chiefs, who have an AFC-best 13-3 record, play host to the
Broncos (12-4) in an AFC second-round game at Arrowhead Stadium.
<p>
   Schottenheimer once was asked whether there was anything he had
not tried to stop Elway.
<p>
   ``Yeah, a bullet,'' Schottenheimer said, laughing.
<p>
   But since 1992, Schottenheimer has beaten Elway in seven of 11
games, although the teams did split this season.
<p>
   ``The reality of it is I have the greatest admiration for
John,'' Schottenheimer said. ``I've always said the quality about
him that exceeds all others is his great competitive nature, and I
think that's the thing that has enabled him to be the great
quarterback that he has been. But, no, I don't spend a lot of time
worrying about it.''
<p>
   Each year at this time, Schottenheimer hears about his playoff
failures. He is 138-76-1 in the regular season the past 13{ years
but only 5-10 in the playoffs.
<p>
   Schottenheimer is 3-6 in the playoffs at Kansas City, including
being upset by Indianapolis in Arrowhead Stadium two years ago when
the Chiefs had the home-field advantage throughout the AFC
playoffs.
<p>
   ``Marty's a guy who's got those intangibles and knows how to win
big games,'' Elway said.
<p>
   Schottenheimer said he is not haunted by his disappointments in
the playoffs.
<p>
   ``The reality of it is that we have never had the success in the
postseason that we have had in the regular season,'' said
Schottenheimer, who is starting Elvis Grbac at quarterback even
though he missed seven of the final eight regular-season games
because of a broken collarbone.
<p>
   ``I don't think you can hide from that or deny it. But I know
this: We've given ourselves a significant number of opportunities
over the course of a number of years. We just have to find a way to
put the final pieces together in the puzzle.''
<p>
   In the 38 years the Chiefs and Broncos have been playing, this
will be the first time the AFC West rivals have met in the
playoffs. It's not a friendly rivalry.
<p>
   ``These teams just don't like each other,'' said Broncos
defensive end Neil Smith, in his first year with the Broncos after
nine seasons with the Chiefs.
<p>
   ``This (rivalry) is getting where you mark it down on the
calendar,'' said Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, who accused
Chiefs linebacker Wayne Simmons of unnecessary roughness in the
Nov. 16 game in Kansas City. ``I have a mind like an elephant. I
don't forget a whole lot. They say forgive and forget, but
forgiveness is the Lord's job, and he knows I never forget.''
<p>
   In the season opener, Chiefs free safety Jerome Woods was fined
$7,500 for hitting Elway in the ribs.
<p>
   After the NFL announced the fine, Woods said, ``When they come
here, I'm going to get my money's worth.''
<p>
   He kept his word.
<p>
   During the same week in which Chiefs center Tim Grunhard said on
his radio show that Schottenheimer offered to pay for any players
fined for breaking the jaws or knocking down any of Denver's
players, Woods was fined $10,000 for hitting Broncos wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey in the jaw in the rematch.
<p>
   ``When we played (the Broncos) up there, they thought I took a
shot at Elway's ribs intentionally, which I didn't do,'' Woods
said. ``I was just playing football, but they came back with the
fine.
<p>
   ``And then when we played them (in Kansas City), I didn't even
know about it until I got the letter saying I'd been fined for the
hit. I can't think about that, and I can't let the fines change the
way I play.''
<p>
   The Broncos, who beat Jacksonville eight days ago in the first
round of the playoffs, think the Chiefs play dirty and repeated
that many times leading up to today's game.
<p>
   ``If you want to cheap-shot, you've got to pay,'' Smith said.
``That's just the nature of the football game. Don't get fined and
then come back crying about you getting fined because you're
hitting a guy. Just pay the fine and be a man. That's all.
<p>
   ``What's the old saying? `Don't do the crime if you can't do the
time?' Well, `Don't do the crime if you can't pay the fine.' ''
<p>
   Grunhard said the Chiefs won't respond to the accusations until
today, and they will do it on the field.

 &UR; CARDS ACCEPTING BIDS ON 2ND PICK &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Maybe the Cardinals could send out invitations, let a few of
their closest 1,000 friends in the NFL know that the bidding begins
Monday for the second pick in the draft.
<p>
   It's that big, you understand, second only to the drafting of
Arizona State quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer a year ago, a move that
could save the franchise.
<p>
   The Cardinals aren't expecting just a smoking, good deal for the
rights to pick quarterbacks  &UR; Ryan Leaf of Washington State or
 &UR; Peyton
 &UR; Manning of Tennessee. They want to make history. They want the
world.
<p>
   A year ago, New York Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells swapped
first-round picks with the St. Louis Rams for the rights to the No.
1 pick overall. The Rams used that pick on Ohio State offensive
tackle
 &UR; Orlando Pace and sent the Jets third -, fourth- and seventh-round
choices in return.
<p>
   That might be a starting place in the Cardinals' negotiations,
but it won't be nearly enough to get Leaf or Manning. The price
will be much higher because of the opportunity to get a franchise
quarterback.
<p>
   Look at the teams that still were in the playoffs as of this
weekend. Green Bay has  &UR; Brett Favre, San Francisco has  &UR; Steve
Young, Denver has
 &UR; John Elway and New England has  &UR; Drew Bledsoe, four of the best
quarterbacks in the league.
<p>
   Pittsburgh has a bright, young star in  &UR; Kordell Stewart. Kansas
City went out in the off-season and brought in  &UR; Elvis Grbac,
Young's backup. Tampa Bay has  &UR; Trent Dilfer, a Pro Bowl player who
is beginning to come into his own. Minnesota had a first-year
starter in  &UR; Brad Johnson before he suffered a season-ending injury.
<p>
   Without a quarterback in the NFL, you don't have anything. Just
ask the Cardinals, who have gone through  &UR; Tom Tupa, Craig Kupp,
Stan
 &UR; Gelbaugh, Dave Krieg and many others.
<p>
   The Cardinals' pick is so valuable because Indianapolis, which
has the top pick overall, will take a quarterback and 10 other
teams could use one.
<p>
   The most desperate are  &UR; San Diego (picking third overall),
 &UR; Chicago (No. 5),  &UR; New Orleans (No. 7),  &UR; Buffalo (No. 9),
 &UR; Baltimore (No. 10) and
 &UR; Seattle (No. 15).
<p>
   Atlanta, which has the 12th pick overall, also needs a
quarterback but plans to go into next season with  &UR; Chris Chandler
as the starter.
<p>
   Many in Washington, whose team will pick 17th overall, are
beginning to wonder whether  &UR; Gus Frerotte will ever be good enough
to take the team to the playoffs.
<p>
   Parcells, who chooses 18th, is no fan of  &UR; Neil O'Donnell, and
there are a lot of question marks about  &UR; Glenn Foley. So, the Jets
could be in the market for a quarterback.
<p>
   It's no secret that Miami Coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson, picking 19th, is
not enamored with aging  &UR; Dan Marino. Johnson likes Marino's backup,
 &UR; Craig
 &UR; Erickson, but he also would like to get another young quarterback.
<p>
   If Detroit were smart and didn't have the massive cap problems
that dumping  &UR; Scott Mitchell would bring, the Lions also would go
after a quarterback.
<p>
   The Cardinals know how quarterback-poor the league is, which is
why they will have a steep asking price for the second pick
overall.
<p>
   Many in the NFL think the Cardinals could become a contender if
they make the right deal and then make good use of the picks.
<p>
   That's an awful lot of pressure on the front office, but the
hardest job already is done. Finally, the Cardinals don't have to
look for a young, franchise quarterback.
<p>
Cool customers &HT;    It's well-known that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who play a
second-round playoff game today in Green Bay, are 0-16 when the
temperature is 40 degrees or below.
<p>
   But Favre is 22-0, 4-0 in the playoffs, when the temperature is
35 degrees or colder.
<p>
   Buccaneers Coach  &UR; Tony Dungy joked last week that his team
probably would forfeit if the temperature didn't climb above the 40
mark.
<p>
   ``If he wants to forfeit, I would take that,'' Holmgren said.
``I don't think it's going to be 40 degrees. It's going to be under
40.
<p>
   ``Tony knows this, and the players know it, too, that the game
is not usually decided by the weather. It's decided by who executes
the best and plays the best. It will be colder than it is typically
in Tampa this time of year.''
<p>
   The Packers have won 26 straight games at Lambeau Field,
outscoring their past three home playoff opponents by a combined
102-47.
<p>
Toronto Broncos? &HT;    If the Denver Broncos, who play an AFC second-round game today
in Kansas City, don't get a new stadium, owner  &UR; Pat Bowlen said he
will sell the team.
<p>
   A referendum on a $180 million football stadium is scheduled for
November, but Bowlen would like to see it on the ballot in May.
<p>
   If the measure fails, ``I will not be the owner of the Broncos
for much longer,'' Bowlen said. ``Somebody else will buy this team,
they will pay me the appropriate sum, and I will maximize whatever
I can get  &MD;  not on the basis of what they're going to do in Denver,
but what they're going to do somewhere else, and it will end up in
Houston or Toronto or somewhere else.''
<p>
   He didn't rule out buying another team for Los Angeles.
<p>
   ``If I want to stay in the business, I will have another team,''
Bowlen said. ``All the people in Los Angeles want a team. If I said
I wanted to go to LA, I think I'd get the green light (from the
league). . . .''
<p>
Bound for Cleveland? &HT;    Cleveland officials want the city to get an expansion team when
pro football returns there in 1999.
<p>
   But Cincinnati's deal for a new stadium appears to be crumbling,
and team officials wouldn't hesitate to move north.
<p>
   Bengals President  &UR; Mike Brown announced recently the team will
walk away from the agreement if the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton
County can't resolve disputes over land transfers by Jan. 31.
<p>
   Bengals officials point out that Cleveland has a better stadium
deal than the one Cincinnati has given the Bengals.
<p>
   ``They have more (luxury) suites, more club seats, higher sales
price for their products, a larger preseason TV deal, a much higher
radio contract,'' said  &UR; Troy Blackburn, Bengals' director of
stadium development.
<p>
   ``It's a stronger market. . . . We're still trying to get the
deal in our hometown (Cincinnati), and we're not focusing on
moving. This is no ultimatum.''
<p>
Hot commodity &HT;    Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator  &UR; Jon Gruden has been
rumored to be headed almost everywhere even though he still is
under contract with the team.
<p>
   The Kansas City Chiefs want to talk to him about replacing
offensive coordinator  &UR; Paul Hackett, who has been hired as coach of
Southern California.
<p>
   Dallas Cowboys owner  &UR; Jerry Jones is interested in Gruden
replacing
 &UR; Barry Switzer after Switzer moves into the front office.
<p>
   Oakland Raiders owner  &UR; Al Davis was interested in hiring Gruden
as offensive coordinator two years ago and as coach last year when
he promoted  &UR; Joe Bugel.
<p>
   Davis passed on Gruden for the coaching job a year ago because
Raiders players persuaded him to go with Bugel, who could be fired
this week. The last thing Davis wants is for Gruden to wind up with
the Chiefs, AFC West rivals.
<p>
   For Gruden to wind up anywhere, he has to convince Philadelphia
officials to let him out of his deal. He tried to go to New England
a year ago and has let it be known how miserable he will be if the
Eagles force him to stay there another year.
<p>
   If Gruden gets the Kansas City job, that could have implications
on the Cardinals' vacant offensive coordinator position. Kansas
City assistant  &UR; Jimmy Raye is expected to be a candidate for the
Cardinals' job unless the Chiefs promote him to replace Hackett.
<p>
Short shots &HT;    Michigan State Coach  &UR; Nick Saban turned down the Indianapolis
job because he wants to become coach of the Browns in 1999. The
Colts will hire Buffalo defensive coordinator  &UR; Wade Phillips unless
he gets the Bills' job. They also will consider Stanford Coach
 &UR; Tyrone Willingham.
<p>
    &MD; New England running back  &UR; Keith Byars, on Miami's Johnson
blaming others for the Patriots knowing Marino's audibles a week
ago: ``Jimmy is just trying to cover his behind. . . . How could we
know everything? They huddle sometimes.''

NELSON FAMILY STARS IN NEW DALLAS SOAP OPERA &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By GARY WASHBURN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
    &LR; LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Instead of lawn bowling or bingo, this near
senior citizen has invented a new hobby.
<p>
   It's called the Dallas Mavericks. And Don Nelson has two
additional seasons to continue his human chess game with the worst
franchise in basketball.
<p>
   Each week, like an ``X-files'' episode, Nelson plays the part of
the eccentric villain who continues to toy with the minds of his
victims with devilish schemes.
<p>
   Tuesday night it was rookie Bubba Wells' turn. The real ``Man of
Steel,'' because he has steel rods in both legs, was reduced to
Styrofoam when Nelson instructed him to commit six fouls on Dennis
Rodman in less than three minutes, breaking a 40-year-old NBA
record for quickest to foul out.
<p>
   Nelson was hoping Rodman would miss the ensuing free throws, but
the usually poor foul-shooting Rodman made 9 of 12. The Mavericks
lost.
<p>
   Wells' mother, Barbara Wells, watched the game on TV and called
to ask whether her son was temporarily insane when he fouled out in
2 minutes, 35 seconds.
<p>
   ``She said, `Have you started to drink?,''' Wells said. ``She
thought I had gone crazy out there. She didn't know I was doing it
on purpose.''
<p>
   Nelson tried a slow-down game at Utah, forbidding his players
from shooting before seven seconds remained on the 24-second clock.
<p>
   The Mavericks lost.
<p>
   He has tried every possible playing rotation and resorted to
every conceivable style to win. Still, the Mavericks have lost 14
straight games before Saturday's contest with the Clippers.
<p>
   And what is Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr.'s reaction? He offers
Nelson a two-year contract extension, allowing Nelson's little mind
games to reach into the next millennium.
<p>
   Remember, Nelson, sipping on an umbrella drinks from his Maui
estate, said he wasn't interested in coaching when he took the
Mavericks general manager's job last season. Lie No. 1. He said he
fully supported former coach Jim Cleamons. Lie No. 2. He said he
would only coach for the remainder of the season. Lie No. 3.
<p>
   Nelson will receive almost $9 million for the next two seasons
for double-duty or double-trouble, whichever comes first.
<p>
   ``I'm committed to the franchise and the city,'' said Nelson,
who has traded or released all but one player from the team he
inherited last season. ``I'm going to be there. I'll do whatever
job they need me to do to help turn the thing around.''
<p>
   Friday night, Nelson outdid himself by naming his son Donn, an
assistant at Phoenix, as head coach beginning in 2001. Donn has no
pro head coaching experience and will be an advance scout for
Dallas until he becomes an assistant next season.
<p>
   Ironically, the Mavericks played at Phoenix on Friday and the
younger Nelson had the nerve to try to sit on the Phoenix bench (he
has obviously learned his tact from his father) before being booted
out by Danny Ainge, who didn't want a Dallas man coaching for
Phoenix.
<p>
   The Ewings aren't the only dysfunctional family in Dallas.
<p>
   What you don't hear about: Another NBA player who wears corn
rolls did something awfully noble this week and guess what? It
wasn't the top story on ``SportsCenter.''
<p>
   Portland forward Rasheed Wallace, last seen paying the NBA a
fine for wearing his shorts too long, returned to his native North
Carolina to pick up his young son.
<p>
   On Christmas morning, Wallace's son Ishmiel was delivered to him
in Durham, N.C. Wallace was awarded custody in June but had not
seen his son since August when the child's mother, Chiquita Bryant,
disappeared with him.
<p>
   ``When he walked through the door, I was glad to see that there
was still some type of familiar scene settings to him,'' said
Wallace, referring to Ishmiel's memory of his grandmother's house.
``He just ran in the house with a smile and started playing with my
nephew, so we felt pretty good.''
<p>
   Wallace, 22, was hesitant because he wasn't sure whether his son
would remember him.
<p>
   ``At first, we didn't know how he was going to act towards me,''
Wallace said. ``He recognized me pretty good and he recognized my
mom.''
<p>
   Wallace brought his son to Portland, where he will live with
Wallace's fiancee and their two children.
<p>
   ``He's home and he'll be watching me and that gives me
satisfaction,'' Wallace said. ``My moral to this story is what I
want. I want to be a father to my child, and that's what I am.''
<p>
   Getting his kicks: Don't think Dennis Rodman has forgotten the
poor cameraman he kicked last year in Minnesota. The Bulls visited
Minnesota for the first time since the incident nearly a year ago.
Eugene Amos no longer works at the Target Center and has endured
his problems since having a most expensive groin injury.
<p>
   Shortly after Rodman gave Amos $200,000 in an out-of-court
settlement in February, Amos made news again when his girlfriend
had him arrested for assaulting her.
<p>
   Rodman, as usual, was his (sym)pathetic self.
<p>
   ``Without my money, he'd probably still have his job,'' Rodman
said. ``After he got arrested for beating his girlfriend, he lost
his job. Like I said, what goes around comes around. All of a
sudden your girlfriend wants to split the money with you, you kick
her ass and go to jail.''
<p>
   Just let the man play: Keith Van Horn continues to impress in
his rookie season, averaging 21.5 points and 6.7 rebounds. But any
guy who scores and is white always seems to be compared to previous
white players.
<p>
   Sports Illustrated compared Van Horn to Detlef Schrempf and Tom
Gugliotta, both whom are tall, offensive-minded and, not
coincidentally, white.
<p>
   ``I was just trying to say (Sports Illustrated) took two players
who play similarly to me in Schrempf and Gugliotta and, just
because (Indiana's) Derrick McKey is black, they failed to mention
him,'' Van Horn said. ``He's another 6-foot-10, versatile forward
who's always played the three and nobody ever brings his name up. I
just thought it was interesting.''
<p>
   Larry Bird, who watched Van Horn last week for the first time as
an opposing coach, agrees with Van Horn.
<p>
   ``It's because he's white,'' Bird said about the comparisons
between he and Van Horn. ``When I came in, it was `Rick Barry' all
the time. I had never really seen Barry ever play basketball, so I
just went out and tried to play my own style and make a name for
myself. Really, the only way you can do that is by winning.''
<p>
   The Nets entered Saturday's play tied for second in the Atlantic
Division.

ARIZONA PULLS AWAY FROM UCLA &QL;

<p>
   TUCSON, Ariz.  &MD;  In the end, it was not one thing that did in the
Bruins, but everything. Too many fouls. Too many rushed shots. Too
much Arizona. And not enough J.R. Henderson.
<p>
   Henderson, the Pacific-10's leading scorer and rebounder,
managed just three points  &MD;  17 under his average  &MD;  and fouled out
with one minute left as Arizona placed the final touches on an
87-75 victory Saturday night, before 14,551 at McKale Center.
<p>
   Henderson was not alone in his struggles. Fellow senior Toby
Bailey scored 17 points but played a poor floor game. Star freshman
Baron Davis missed the final minutes as well, fouling out with five
points.
<p>
   Arizona's victory margin would have been much greater if not for
superb performances from Kris Johnson (28 points) and Jelani McCoy,
who had 16 points and 11 rebounds in his second game back from
suspension.
<p>
   With the victory, Arizona protected its homecourt and placed the
onus on UCLA to do the same when the teams meet in the season
finale in Pauley Pavilion.
<p>
   The Bruins and Wildcats have won or shared the Pac-10 title
every year since 1986, and the atmosphere in McKale Center  &MD;  equal
parts rowdy and angry  &MD;  befitted the collision of the West's
dominant programs.
<p>
   ``The rivalry hasn't changed a lot since (the days of) Steve
Kerr and Reggie Miller,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said. ``It was
the same then as it is now. If you're going to win the title, a lot
has to do with the outcome of these two games.''
<p>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin took a subdued approach a day before
tipoff  &MD;  explaining that his team, while talented, is months from
its peak because of the Jelani McCoy assimilation process.
<p>
   ``The good thing is that we'll find out in the first
(conference) game what our deficiencies are and what our strengths
are,'' Lavin said.
<p>
   ``We haven't played as good a schedule as Arizona. I'm concerned
we have a deceiving record. If we'd played the powerhouses Arizona
has, we could be 5-5.''
<p>
   Each team was skittish in the opening minutes, with errant
passes and hurried shots all around. The Wildcats were first to
find their groove, edging to a 21-13 lead with 10 minutes left in
the first half. But the Bruins did not flinch. Johnson drained a
3-pointer from the right wing, then McCoy followed a Davis miss,
and the counterpunch had found its target.
<p>
   Suddenly, the Wildcats were on their heels. McCoy converted a
wild, spinning drive that began 17 feet from the basket and ended
with a floater from the lane. Then Bailey hit a 3-pointer from the
right corner and Davis found Bailey for a breakaway jam. With 7:40
left, UCLA had snared the lead, 25-24.
<p>
   Bailey committed his third foul with five minutes left in the
half and joined Henderson (two fouls) on the bench.
<p>
   No matter  &MD;  Johnson was in a zone. He buried a 17-footer, then
converted from the low post. In all, he scored eight consecutive
points, drew the third foul on Arizona forward Gene Edgerson and
help stake the Bruins to a 41-38 halftime lead.
<p>
   It lasted 2:30 of the second half, when the Wildcats began to
wrest control. The source of UCLA's trouble was not defense, but
offense. As they have done in almost every game this season, the
Bruins endured a stretch in which they did nothing right. Turnovers
and bad shots mounted, as did the deficit.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Arizona gunners found their range. Miles Simon
struck from the lane, then Michael Dickerson from 3-point range. An
8-0 spurt ended with Mike Bibby, unguarded, connecting from long
range for a 66-54 lead.

   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  They counted as losses when the Clippers took the
Bulls and Lakers to the wire before losing. So a lackluster win
over a dismal Dallas team is as good as gold to the Clippers at
this point, especially when it was without their best player of
late.
<p>
   The Clippers picked up their third straight victory Saturday,
led by Lamond Murray's 21 points in a 97-88 win over the Mavericks
in front of 5,133 at the Sports Arena. Dallas lost its 15th
consecutive game.
<p>
   With Lorenzen Wright sidelined because of a sprained knee, the
Clippers scored the first 16 points and then held on after the
Mavericks cut it to three with 2:16 left. Seven of the Clippers'
eight wins are against the Mavericks, Kings and Warriors, which
gives the Clippers the unofficial title of the ``best bad team in
the Western Conference.''
<p>
   But after they got another dose of bad news with Wright's
injury, the Clippers got unexpected production from Keith Closs and
Stojko Vrankovic, who combined for 14 rebounds, one short of
Wright's average the last nine games.
<p>
   Brent Barry added 21 points and Eric Piatkowski, who had a
horrible 2-of-11 shooting night, saved the best time for a hoop
with a decisive 3-pointer with 1:41 left. The Clippers staved off a
furious Dallas rally led by Michael Finley, who scored 18 of his 21
points in the second half.
<p>
   Wright was injured in the third quarter of Friday night's win at
Golden State and continued to play on the knee. He called coach
Bill Fitch on Saturday morning and said it was painful.
<p>
   ``I knew when I got that call this morning that it wasn't going
to be a good day,'' Fitch said. ``It's a shame, but I would have
liked to have Lorenzen for this game. It's the pits.''
<p>
   Wright was playing the best ball of his short career, collecting
141 rebounds in the last nine games (15.7 average) and 16.4 points.
He's become the offensive leader and Fitch doesn't even run plays
for him.
<p>
   Wright continues to pick up loose balls and hit short jumpers,
raising his shooting to 46 percent despite struggling at the
beginning of the season.
<p>
   ``I hope it isn't serious,'' Fitch said. ``All we need is to
have Lorenzen out for a while. He's important to this team because
he's a flow player. He doesn't get the ball much in the post, but
he always seems to score.''
<p>
   Wright could be set for an MRI on the knee today or Monday. The
Clippers next game is Tuesday at Sacramento.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Don Nelson strolled onto the Sports Arena with his
bag on tricks and it took exactly 1 minute, 41 seconds to resort to
them. He pulled all five starters after the Clippers scored the
first eight points.
<p>
   He sent in 11 of 12 players in the first six minutes. But the
combination worked because only the Clippers would allow a 22-3
lead to melt to 26-20 in five minutes. The Clippers could have
quite possibly played their best and worst quarter in the same
time.
<p>
   The Mavericks made a 24-4 run to pass the Clippers at 27-26.
After a stretch of 10 straight misses, the Clippers ended the half
with a 13-2 run sparked by 10 points from Barry and Maurice Taylor
(15 points, nine rebounds), who will get more playing time in
Wright's absence.

<p>
   PITTSBURGH  &MD;  Chan Gailey's face was still flushed 30 minutes
after it was over.
<p>
   ``Tell you what,'' said the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive
coordinator Saturday, ``that defense is as good as there is in the
league right now. Make that great. They are great. They wouldn't
let us make any plays.''
<p>
   Except one. The ``Boot-It 9'' that sent Steeler quarterback
Kordell Stewart tiptoeing down the left sideline for 40 yards and
into the end zone for the only touchdown of the game early in the
second period.
<p>
   ``I never thought that would be all we would get or that it
would be good enough to win the game,'' said Pittsburgh coach Bill
Cowher. ``But give New England credit. They are a bunch of gutsy,
gutsy guys. They played a tremendous game out there today.''
<p>
   Cowher acknowledged that his team played a great defensive game
as well, but added quickly, ``They were without some of their (top)
people, and they still battled us all the way.''
<p>
   Neither team could do much on offense. The best unit in the game
was the Patriots' defense. The Steelers' defense caught a break
when Curtis Martin did not dress; backup Dave Meggett played little
with a sore groin; wide receiver Terry Glenn, who was having a big
day, had to leave in the third quarter with a broken clavicle; and
tight end Ben Coates followed shortly with a sprained knee.
<p>
   This left Drew Bledsoe with one weapon from his regular starting
unit, Shawn Jefferson. It was almost enough.
<p>
   Trailing, 7-6, in the fourth quarter after two Adam Vinatieri
field goals, Bledsoe, Jefferson, and Vinatieri might have pulled
out a victory, after a monumental gaffe by Cowher.
<p>
   Facing fourth and goal on the 1, Cowher decided to gamble on a
touchdown, when a field goal would have given him a 4-point lead
(10-6) and forced the Patriots to go the length of the field, with
several New England backups in the game.
<p>
   ``It was a major mistake on my part,'' said Cowher. ``I should
have never gone for it. I got caught up in the emotion of the
game.''
<p>
   Stewart was stopped short when he tried to jump over on a sneak.
<p>
   ``The Patriots made a great play on us,'' said Gailey. ``Their
linebackers played it perfectly.''
<p>
   The Patriots took over at the 1 with 3:24 to play, needing just
a field goal to take the lead. Bledsoe moved the ball out to the
New England 42 with 1:44 and two timeouts left. Plenty of time to
move the ball 20-25 more yards to set up Vinatieri.
<p>
   However, the Pittsburgh defense turned in the most important
play of the game.
<p>
   Bledsoe faded to pass. The Steelers had good coverage. He
started to drift to his right, buying time for someone to come
open, when his protection broke down. Right defensive end Mike
Vrabel, a rookie out of Ohio State, beat Bruce Armstrong wide to
the outside and started to sprint toward Bledsoe. Just about the
time the quarterback was about to come forward with the ball,
Vrabel hit him from behind. It squirted loose. Referee Walt Coleman
hesitated. Incomplete pass? Fumble? Coleman called it a fumble, and
the Patriots' real last hope was lost.
<p>
   ``I was on Vrabel during the week,'' said defensive coordinator
Jim Haslett. ``I told him a couple of times, `You haven't made a
big play in weeks. If you don't come up with some big plays, I'm
going to have to sit you down.' Look what happens. He comes up with
the biggest play of the game.''
<p>
   There is plenty of room to argue that the play should have been
called an incomplete pass, but it was really in the eye of the
beholder.
<p>
   Backup referee Tom White said later, ``It is a difficult call to
make bacause it happens in the blink of an eye. If the referee
feels the ball has started forward, and his arm was going forward,
then it is incomplete.''
<p>
   The arm was going foward, the ball went forward, but in
fairness, it is hard to separate whether it was with impetus from
Bledsoe or from getting hit from behind by Vrabel.
<p>
   ``I wish all their (offensive) guys could have played,'' said
Haslett. ``I mean it. This was a great game. Hard hitting. We had
three things we wanted to do coming in. Not let them run the ball
(the Patriots had 36 yards rushing); not give up the big play, and
beat up their receivers when they caught it. Glenn got a couple of
plays on us, but outside of that, we got the job done.''
<p>
   As did Stewart, who has yet to raise his passing to a top level
in the NFL, but who, with his running skills, is a quality player.
<p>
   On the ``Boot-It 9'' call, ``Their defense had been blitzing us
to the strong side of our formation,'' said Gailey. ``At the snap
of the ball, they were just going with (Jerome) Bettis. So we had
Stewart fake a hand-off to Bettis (going off right tackle) and then
run a bootleg back to the weak side. Our right guard (Brenden Stai)
pulls with them. Stai and our tight end Mark Bruener did a great
job of ad-libbing on the play. Their right defensive end (Willie
McGinest) surprised us by rushing outside and getting upfield
quickly.
<p>
   ``Bruener couldn't block him and this is what he was supposed to
do. But Stai, who is supposed to get in front of Stewart and block
the cornerback (Jimmy Hitchcock) saw what happend and changed his
assignment to hit (McGinest) and take him to the outside, Bruener
made a smart play, and went after (Hitchcock) and knocked him out
of bounds. This created the lane for Stewart to go right down the
sideline and into the end zone.''
<p>
   Linebacker Todd Collins had one futile attempt at Stewart, but
the Steelers had their touchdown.
<p>
   ``The New England defense was something,'' saluted Bettis.
``They're the toughest I've played against this year. They just
weren't going to let me run the ball. They kept telling me that. It
looked like they had nine guys on the line of scrimmage. They
filled every hole. I had nowhere to run. They not only have good
players, but they play smart. They made it hard for our guys to try
to block them.''
<p>
   ``We could come out over the ball,'' said Steeler offensive
tackle John Jackson, ``and there would be no one where you were
supposed to be blocking someone. They just jumped around all day.
They are very fast.''
<p>
   Gailey said he asked his offense to do three things: Not turn
the ball over (Stewart had one interception); run the ball for 130
yards or more (they had 145); and convert on third down  &MD;  ``We were
8 for 18 for 44 percent, which is just about our average.''
<p>
   The Steelers did exactly what Gailey wanted them to do, but
still could muster only 7 points.
<p>
   The Patriots turned the ball over four times, two fumbles and
two interceptions. But the only one that really hurt came when
Bledsoe fumbled with 1:44 left.
<p>
   Coming into the game, Bledsoe had fumbled the ball away to an
opponent just once.
<p>
   And prior to Saturday, the Steelers had run ``Boot-It 9'' just
once.

<p>
   MILWAUKEE  &MD;  The coach of the Celtics likes to rank his team's
victories. He calls the team's best games his ``favorites,'' as if
they were a sweet scoop of ice cream or a compelling feature-length
film. Rick Pitino will gladly tell you what wins qualify for the
Pitino Awards. But you have to ask fast. The list is growing
quickly.
<p>
   Winning the Pitino for second-best road performance? The
Celtics, for Saturday night's 106-99 win over the Bucks at the
Bradley Center. ``This was one of my favorite wins of the year,''
Pitino said. The first Pitino Fave was the win over the Lakers a
week ago Sunday in Los Angeles. That's two favorites in the same
week.
<p>
   Saturday night's award winner brought the Celtics' season record
to 16-14, two games over .500. No Celtic team has been two games
over .500 since December 1993.
<p>
   So please excuse the Celtics for jubilantly getting on a bus and
driving 80 miles to Chicago, where they play Tuesday. Please be
advised that they, too, watched the Patriots lose to the Steelers
Saturday and were hurt like the rest of New England fans. But it's
been four long years since they could smile like they did Saturday
night, so forgive them for not joining in the Patriots postmortems
this morning.
<p>
   What they did Saturday night was overcome 69 percent
first-quarter shooting by the Bucks, 35 points from Glenn Robinson
and an incredible 45 free-throw attempts by Milwaukee.
<p>
   ``I knew that a team couldn't shoot that way the entire night,''
Pervis Ellison said of the Bucks' early accuracy, ``but I was
wondering if it would ever stop.''
<p>
   That fluid shooting stopped abruptly in the fourth quarter.
That's too bad for Milwaukee, because Antoine Walker, Ron Mercer,
Walter McCarty, Dana Barros, and Ellison all were in motion. It
started with Walker.
<p>
   ``They outplayed us and it started with Walker,'' Bucks point
guard Terrell Brandon said.
<p>
   The Celtics forward had 32 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists.
And he did all that in front of a few friends and family members
who made the trip from Chicago, his hometown. Walker's definition
of a few?
<p>
   ``About 22 of 'em,'' he said.
<p>
   So 22 people began the night with their voices sounding like
chimes among the din of 16,000 Bucks fans. But by the end of the
night, even the locals were giving Walker respect.
<p>
   The Celtics trailed, 91-90, with 5:20 left. After two missed
free throws by Tyrone Hill, Walker scored on a short jumper with
4:36 remaining. Two minutes later, Ellison caught the ball on the
baseline and dunked. And 30 seconds after that, Walker got a
tip-in. That made it 96-91 with two minutes to go.
<p>
   ``We're really starting to come together,'' was the way McCarty
described it later. He finished the night with 19 points. He hit
shots in the first quarter to set the pace; he hit shots in the
fourth quarter to help the Celtics secure their fifth road win.
<p>
   And then there was Ellison.
<p>
   ``For the amount of minutes he's playing, he's playing
fantastic,'' Pitino said of the center. ``I couldn't be more happy
for a person.''
<p>
   In the final three minutes, Ellison scored, rebounded, and
blocked. The Celtics needed everything he gave, too. A 5-point lead
in the final two minutes is hardly safe against a team like the
Bucks.
<p>
   ``Pervis is making a comeback!'' Barros yelled to radio
commentator Cedric Maxwell during a break. That's a comeback
because Ellison is known in New England to be on the injured list.
But he says he feels the best he's ever felt since he's been in
Boston. That was obvious Saturday night, as he collected eight
rebounds in 18 minutes.
<p>
   Everyone in green left the building happy. The Bucks talked
about their disappointment and how they need to get over .500. That
is a given for some teams in the NBA. But the Celtics know not to
take it for granted. It took the organization four years to get
where it is today.

<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  When last we saw the Sharks, it was in the middle of
October in San Jose and the Bruins, who had never before lost to
the lowly expansion team (7-0-3), were soundly beaten, 5-2, in a
lackluster effort.
<p>
   The tide turned following that game. It proved to be a wakeup
call for Boston, serving as a springboard for the rest of the
eight-game road trip. The Bruins went on to win their next five and
came home with a 6-2-0 record.
<p>
   The Bruins are hoping Saturday night's 3-0 victory over the
Sharks at the FleetCenter will spark another run, as they ended
their winless streak at three games (0-1-2).
<p>
   It was the second shutout in a row for goalie Byron Dafoe, his
fifth of the season and sixth of his career. Dafoe made 23 saves in
winning for the first time in his last six starts. It was the first
time in his career he had back-to-back shutouts, and the first time
Boston had consecutive shutouts at home since March 1985.
<p>
   ``It's always nice to get a shutout, but it was really nice to
get a win after not getting one the other night,'' said Dafoe,
referring to Thursday's scoreless tie with Ottawa. ``The two points
are very gratifying. The shutout is just a bonus on top of it. It's
a tribute to the type of defense they play in front of me. They had
a couple of chances in the third period, but other than that, we
bottled them up pretty good.''
<p>
   Offensively, 1998 has been slow to develop for the Bruins. After
Thursday's 0-0 affair, the Bruins came into Saturday night's game
endeavoring to rev up their offense. Boston had won just one game
in its last eight, and during that 1-4-3 stretch the Bruins had
averaged less than two goals a game.
<p>
   Saturday night, they ended their scoreless string at 127 minutes
31 seconds when they took a 1-0 lead in the second period.
<p>
   After a deadly dull first period in which the Bruins outshot the
Sharks, 10-6, but generated precious little in the way of scoring
chances, Boston got on the board 2:50 into the second. Rookie left
wing Sergei Samsonov made a nice move, deking a defender, before
firing a shot from in close on Kelly Hrudey. The Sharks goalie made
the save, but right wing Anson Carter was there to pot the rebound.
It was Carter's first goal in 10 games, since scoring against
Montreal Dec. 13.
<p>
   Though the Bruins weren't setting the world on fire offensively,
at least they weren't porous at the other end. In holding San Jose
scoreless, the Bruins extended their streak of not allowing a goal
to 139:18.
<p>
   In the third period, the checking line gave the Bruins some
breathing room. Center Tim Taylor dished a pass to P.J. Axelsson,
who fired a shot that Hrudey stopped. The rebound went to right
wing Rob DiMaio, who was charging the net. DiMaio's shot glanced
off the netminder's glove, caromed off the right post, and trickled
on edge along the goal line. Hrudey threw his arm backward to try
to snag it with his glove before it completely crossed the line,
but replay officials ruled it was over, giving Boston a 2-0 lead at
8:45 and giving DiMaio his first goal in 21 games, since Nov. 17
against Ottawa.
<p>
   ``I thought it was very close to being in,'' said DiMaio, who
along with his teammates watched the replay while the Sharks argued
it was not a goal. ``I knew it was right on the line or just over.
I had a whole open net and he made an unbelieveable save on it, but
if it's in, it's in. And it was.''
<p>
   Axelsson sealed it with an empty-net goal with 26.1 seconds
left.

<p>
    MORGANTOWN, W.Va.  &MD;  They shot 8 for 25 from the field, 4 of 8
from the free throw line, and committed 11 turnovers that led to 18
first-half opposition points. They had two starters in foul
trouble, and after going 6:27 with their side of the scoreboard
stuck on 10, ended up dangerously close to setting a Big East
record for fewest points in a first half.
<p>
   It was a recipe for disaster, for all intents and purposes Al
Skinner's worst nightmare in his first year as Boston College's
basketball coach.
<p>
   A blowout loss. On the road. Against a ranked conference
opponent that was every bit as talented as it was deep.
<p>
   Undermanned and overtaxed, the Eagles were unable to climb out
of the hole they fell into after the first half Saturday night and
absorbed a 79-57 loss at the hands of the No. 22 Mountaineers
before 7,853 at West Virginia Coliseum.
<p>
   ``With their style of play and our lack of everything  &MD;  depth,
experience  &MD;  there was potential for this, particularly in the
first half,'' said Skinner, whose team dropped to 8-6 overall and
1-3 in Big East and travels to Villanova for its second game
against the Wildcats in a week Tuesday night. ``West Virginia's
always been one of the more difficult places to play and when you
put three freshmen on the floor, it makes it tough. We didn't
handle the pressure well this particular game. We just never got on
track.
<p>
   ``But I'd say the first 15 minutes of that first half, this was
definitely not the team I'd coached before,'' he said. ``In all
honesty, I have to take some responsibility, because maybe we
weren't as well prepared as I thought we were.''
<p>
   But what could possibly prepare BC for Saturday night?
<p>
   Senior guard Duane Woodward led the Eagles with 16 points on
4-for-12 shooting but had 2 assists and committed 4 of BC's 25
turnovers. Senior swingman Antonio Granger had 12 points on
4-for-16 shooting and fouled out with 6:44 to go.
<p>
   With Mickey Curley out of the lineup for the second week in a
row after severely spraining his right ankle against Holy Cross, a
frightening scene took place with 9:48 to go when junior forward
Kostas Maglos crumpled to the floor with a sprained left ankle.
``It really scared me,'' said Maglos, who sat for the rest of the
game with 11 points, 3 rebounds, and 8 turnovers, but left the
building under his own power. ``It was the same one I injured last
summer in Greece (while playing for the national team). I missed a
lot of time because of it, so it really scared me.''
<p>
   Said Skinner, ``Now I'm without a 4 and a 5, but hopefully,
he'll be ready to go (against Villanova). It's unfortunate, but
that's what happens when you're shorthanded. Clearly, it was not as
serious as Mickey's.''
<p>
   The Eagles took an 8-4 lead only to have it wrested away for
good by a 21-2 run that gave the Mountaineers a commanding 27-10
lead. Stuck on 10, the Eagles appeared on pace to break Miami's
6-year-old conference record (12 points, vs. St. John's) for fewest
first-half points. Until, that is, Granger hit a pair of free
throws with 4:39 to go. Granger then heated up in the final 1:57 by
hitting back-to-back treys to help BC cut West Virginia's lead to
16, 38-22, at intermission.
<p>
   ``This was one of my worst games that I've been involved in,
going back to my freshman year,'' said Granger. ``It was real
frustrating in the first half. You can't score and you keep making
turnover after turnover after turnover, so that you start thinking,
`When is it going to end?'''
<p>
   West Virginia senior forward Damian Owens, who was held to 2
points on 1-for-5 shooting in the first half, helped the
Mountaineers (12-2, 2-1) put the game away by scoring 19 of his
game-high 21 points in the second half. Guard Adrian Pledger
chipped in 17.
<p>
   ``I was aware there was a potential for this,'' Skinner said,
``and I guess I was concerned that maybe if I didn't bring it to
their attention, they would handle it all right. But that wasn't
the case. It was the wrong decision, and we paid a big price for it
in the first half.''

UCLA SLOWED DOWN BY ARIZONA &QL;

<p>
   TUCSON, Ariz.  &MD;  In the end, it was not one thing that did in the
Bruins, but everything. Too many fouls. Too many rushed shots. Too
many turnovers. Too much Arizona.
<p>
   And not enough J.R. Henderson.
<p>
   Arizona joined North Carolina as the only teams to contain
Henderson this season, and consequently, the only teams to defeat
UCLA.
<p>
   The Wildcats held Henderson to three points  &MD;  17 under his
average  &MD;  as they grabbed the (very) early lead in the conference
title race with an 87-75 win Saturday night, before 14,551 at
McKale Center.
<p>
   With the victory, Arizona protected its homecourt and placed the
onus on UCLA (9-2) to do the same when the teams meet in the season
finale in Pauley Pavilion. The outcome also confirmed what many,
including Bruins coach Steve Lavin, believed all along: that
Arizona, with its starting five intact from last year, is weeks
ahead of a UCLA team trying to assimilate Kris Johnson and Jelani
McCoy.
<p>
   ``I'm glad we get Arizona at our place late,'' Lavin said.
``They're definitely ahead of us.... You can't integrate (two
starters) in midseason and be hitting on all cylinders. I don't
think we'll be playing our best until early February.''
<p>
   UCLA received unexpected support from Johnson, who scored a
game-high 28, and McCoy, who had 16 points and 13 rebounds in his
second game back from suspension. During one stretch in the first
half, they accounted for 12 consecutive points.
<p>
   But they alone could not overcome the myriad problems. The
Bruins were outrebounded 41-34. They committed 18 turnovers. They
shot 36 percent in the second half  &MD;  including a seven-possession
scoreless streak that allowed Arizona to take control  &MD;  and they
were in foul trouble throughout.
<p>
   ``We didn't play as good as we should have,'' Toby Bailey said.
``You have to play almost perfect at Arizona, and we didn't do that
tonight. A couple people were out of rhythm. I was out of rhythm,
and J.R. was out of rhythm.''
<p>
   Bailey missed 9 of 16 shots and had six turnovers. Guards Baron
Davis and Earl Watson combined for three baskets. Nor could UCLA
stop Arizona's brilliant backcourt. Mike Bibby, Miles Simon and
Michael Dickerson combined for 71 points.
<p>
   But the Bruins' biggest problem was Henderson's ineffectiveness.
He committed two early fouls and spent 13 first-half minutes on the
bench. He returned for the second half but missed two early layups
and never got started.
<p>
   ``It was hard to get back out there in the second half and get
in the flow of things,'' he said. ``Plus they double-teamed me. The
ball wasn't dropping. I missed some easy shots. It was just one of
those nights.
<p>
   ``The double-team was planned. They had a certain guy come over
every time, and their rotation was perfect.''
<p>
   Arizona employed the same strategy on Henderson that it used to
shut down power forwards Raef LaFrentz (Kansas) and Antawn Jamison
(North Carolina) during the Wildcats' NCAA title charge last March.
Their low-post smother limited Henderson to six shots (he made one)
and forced passes to the perimeter instead of drives to the basket.
<p>
   ``Essentially, we have two guys playing against one,'' Wildcats
assistant Phil Johnson said. ``We have a guy in front and another
guy ready to come over (from behind) once he touches it. We played
him like a guard, because he's so good with the ball. He couldn't
get free.''
<p>
   Each team was skittish in the opening minutes, with errant
passes and hurried shots all around. The Wildcats were first to
find their groove, edging to a 21-13 lead with 10 minutes left in
the first half. But the Bruins did not flinch. Johnson drained a
3-pointer from the right wing, then McCoy followed a Davis miss,
and the counterpunch had found its target.
<p>
   Bailey committed his third foul with five minutes left in the
half and joined Henderson (two fouls) on the bench. No matter  &MD; 
Johnson was in a zone. He buried a 17-footer, then converted from
the low post. In all, he scored eight consecutive points, drew the
third foul on Arizona forward Gene Edgerson and helped stake the
Bruins to a 41-38 halftime lead.
<p>
   It lasted 2:30 of the second half, when the Wildcats began to
wrest control. The source of UCLA's trouble was not defense, but
offense. As they have done in almost every game this season, the
Bruins endured a stretch in which they did nothing right. Turnovers
and bad shots mounted, as did the deficit.
<p>
   ``In the first 8-12 minutes of the second half, Arizona
dominated both ends of the court,'' Lavin said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Arizona gunners found their range. Simon struck
from the lane, then Dickerson from 3-point range. An 8-0 spurt
ended with Bibby, unguarded, connecting from long range for a 66-54
lead.

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  They counted as losses when the Clippers took the
Bulls and Lakers to the wire before losing. So a lackluster win
over dismal Dallas is as good as gold to the Clippers at this
point, especially when it was without their best player of late.
<p>
   The Clippers picked up their third straight victory on Saturday,
led by Lamond Murray's 21 points in a 97-88 win over the Mavericks
in front of 5,133 at the Sports Arena. Dallas lost its 15th
consecutive game.
<p>
   Even with Lorenzen Wright sidelined because of a sprained knee,
the Clippers scored the first 16 points and held on after the
Mavericks cut it to three with 2:16 left. Six of the Clippers'
eight wins are over the Mavericks, Kings and Warriors, giving the
Clippers the unofficial title of the ``best bad team in the Western
Conference.''
<p>
   But after they got another dose of bad news with Wright's
injury, the Clippers got unexpected production from Keith Closs and
Stojko Vrankovic, who combined for 14 rebounds, one short of
Wright's average the last nine games.
<p>
   And Maurice Taylor, mired in a 4-for-27 shooting slump, came off
the bench to add 15 points (his best output since Dec. 4) and nine
rebounds.
<p>
   ``The caliber of play is what builds up confidence,'' said
Clippers coach Bill Fitch, whose team has won three during a
five-game stretch against teams with losing records. ``Our guys
will learn from this. We had a good start tonight.''
<p>
   But the Clippers (8-24) had to make things interesting against a
Mavericks team (5-27) totally confused by coach Don Nelson's recent
bag of tricks.
<p>
   Brent Barry added 21 points and Eric Piatkowski, who had a
horrible (2 of 11) shooting night, contributed the decisive
3-pointer with 1:39 left. The Clippers staved off a furious Dallas
rally led by Michael Finley, who scored 18 of his 21 points in the
second half.
<p>
   Wright missed the game with an injury suffered in the third
quarter of Friday night's win over Golden State. Wright continued
to play on the knee but called Fitch on Saturday morning and said
it was painful.
<p>
   ``I knew when I got that call this morning that it wasn't going
to be a good day,'' Fitch said. ``It's a shame, but I would have
liked to have Lorenzen for this game. It's the pits.''
<p>
   Wright was playing the best ball of his short career, collecting
141 rebounds in the last nine games (15.7 average) and 16.4 points.
He's become the offensive leader and Fitch doesn't run plays for
him.
<p>
   ``I hope it isn't serious,'' Fitch said. ``All we need is to
have Lorenzen out for a while. He's important to this team because
he's a flow player. He doesn't get the ball much in the post, but
he always seems to score.''
<p>
   Wright could be set for an MRI on the knee today or Monday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Nelson strolled onto the Sports Arena and took 1
minute, 41 seconds to try something strange.
<p>
   He pulled all five starters after the Clippers scored the first
eight points. He sent in 11 of 12 players in the first six minutes.
But the combination worked  &MD;  the Clippers allowed a 22-3 lead to
melt to 26-20 within five minutes.
<p>
   The Clippers could have quite possibly played their best and
worst quarter at the same time.
<p>
   But it seems that improbable comeback win over Denver has taught
this team something about composure down the stretch. For the
second straight game, the Clippers held off a team trying to make a
charge.
<p>
   It was ugly and it was Dallas, but the Clippers will store this
one in the confidence file.
<p>
   ``I think we are playing more team ball,'' said Murray, who has
scored 37 points in the last two games, ``rather than playing as
erratic as we did in the beginning of the season.''

   Tel Aviv, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The following stories appeared
in Israeli papers this morning:
Netanyahu Will Try to Accommodate Levy; Even if Ne'eman Resigns
<p>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will try to
accommodate Foreign Minister David Levy's budgetary priorities,
even if it means the resignation of Finance Minister Yaacov
Ne'eman, said officials in Netanyahu's office. A vote on the 207.4
billion-shekel ($58.5 billion) spending plan was postponed until
Monday at 2 p.m. after Levy said on Thursday that he would vote
against the budget because it ignores the needs of the poor.
Ne'eman and Netanyahu discussed last night ways to find 300 million
shekels to fund Levy's demands. (Ha'aretz, Ma'ariv, Yediot Ahronot,
Jerusalem Post)
Netanyahu Invited to White House Meeting with Clinton
<p>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to come to the White House on Jan. 20, said officials in
Netanyahu's office after a telephone conversation between the prime
minister and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The U.S.
wants to hold the meeting before the Israeli cabinet decides on the
scope of a West Bank pullback so Netanyahu will be able to accept a
U.S.-brokered compromise with the Palestinians, a U.S. official
said. Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is expected to
attend a separate meeting with Clinton at the White House during
January. Israel is scheduled to carry out another pullback in the
West Bank under the terms of the Oslo accords. (Ha'aretz, Ma'ariv,
Yediot Ahronot, Jerusalem Post)
<p>
   Mordechai Says Israel Accepts U.N. Call for Lebanon Withdrawal
<p>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would accept a
U.N. resolution calling for an Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. Mordechai, whose statement was the first by a senior
Israeli official accepting U.N. Security Council Resolution 425,
said Israel would make its withdrawal conditional upon a portion of
the resolution which calls for Lebanon to assert its sovereignty
and ensure peace and security. Defense officials said that
Mordechai's statement didn't mean the Israeli army had altered its
security approach to southern Lebanon. (Jerusalem Post)

<p>
   Jerusalem, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli budget talks are
stalled as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks funding to
satisfy Foreign Minister David Levy, who threatened to resign on
Thursday, said a spokesman for the Prime Minister.
<p>
   Netanyahu and Levy have not met since the Foreign Minister said
he would vote against the budget and withdraw the support of his
Gesher Party's five members of parliament, said Ofir Akunis, a
spokesman for Netanyahu. The two don't have a meeting scheduled
yet, Akunis said.
<p>
   While Levy's resignation over his demand for extra social
spending would leave Netanyahu with the majority to pass the
budget, it would weaken his ruling coalition. If Netanyahu finds
the funds to meet Levy's demands, it will increase spending.
<p>
   Levy has announced he will hold a press conference at 4.00 p.m.
local time. A spokeswoman for Levy declined to comment regarding
the press conference, as did Akunis. Israel Radio said ``the budget
crisis will worsen'' after the press conference.
<p>
   ``We'll see what he has to say. For now, we hope to find the
resources to fund what he wants,'' said Akunis. ``We're checking
the possibilities with the Finance Ministry.''
<p>
   If Levy gets what he wants, the government will have to cover
the expenditure by raising taxes, selling more state assets,
redirecting spending from another ministry, or cutting the budget
across the board later in the year, analysts said.
<p>
   The parliament was supposed to have approved the 1998 budget by
Jan. 1. Instead, the government postponed until Monday a vote on
legislation that the lawmakers must pass before they can vote on
the budget, allowing officials time to negotiate with Levy.
<p>
   The daily Ha'aretz reported that Levy's demands total 1 billion
shekels ($282.8 million). The paper said that any additional
allocation to Levy without offsetting cuts would push the
government past its target budget of 207.4 billion shekels.
<p>
   Without Levy and his Gesher Party MPs, Netanyahu would maintain
a 61-to-59 majority in the Knesset.
<p>
   That would make him more vulnerable to pressure from small
parties within the coalition: the 10-member Shas Party, advocate
for ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews; the nine-member National
Religious Party, a right-wing party supporting Jewish settlers; the
seven-member Israel on the Rise Party, which represents mostly
Russian immigrants to Israel, and the four-member Third Way Party,
which calls itself a centrist party.
<p>
   Levy said Thursday the government isn't paying enough attention
to the poor. Israeli cities beyond main population centers, plagued
by unemployment, weren't ``in the eyes of those who squandered
hundreds of millions'' of shekels, he said.
<p>
   If the budget doesn't pass in days ahead, the government is
granted an extension until March 31 on the basis of 1997 spending,
stalling plans to spur new growth. If the budget still hasn't
passed by the end of March, the government collapses, the Knesset
is dissolved, and new elections are held.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had crafted a budget that aimed to reduce
the deficit target to 2.4 percent of total economic output next
year from 2.8 percent in 1997.
<p>
   The trimmer budget comes as Israel's growth has slowed to its
lowest rate since 1989, as unemployment has hit its highest rate
since 1993, and after a general strike last month paralyzed
business, shuttering the stock exchange and banks.
<p>
   None of the budget choices is simple, said analysts. Netanyahu
and Ne'eman have pledged not to raise taxes. The 1998 budget plan
already assumes the government will take in 4 billion shekels of
revenue from state-asset sales.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil could fall in coming
days on expectations that the United Nations will approve a food
and medical aid distribution plan for Iraq as soon as Monday,
allowing Baghdad to resume exporting oil.
<p>
   The Commodity Research Bureau index fell 4.45, or 1.9 percent,
to 228.91 this week; while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index fell 5.25, or 2.9 percent, to 173.29.
<p>
   Iraqi oil exports, which make up 1 percent of world supply, will
add to increased production from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which yesterday began operating under new
production targets that are almost 10 percent higher than last
year's.
<p>
   The anticipated supply increase comes at a time when demand for
heating fuel is weaker-than-normal because of unusually warm
weather in the U.S. Northeast and northern Midwest. Heating demand
is expected to be 35 percent below normal during the next seven
days, according to Weather Derivatives Co. of Belton, Missouri.
<p>
   ``We have too much oil,'' said Hugo Zagaria, an international
oil trader at Cargill Northeast Petroleum in Minneapolis. ``There
is no winter. The amount of oil is outpacing the amount of demand.
We are heading to a very weak season.''
<p>
   Crude oil for February delivery fell 77 cents, or 4.2 percent,
this week to $17.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the lowest closing price for a contract nearest to expiration since
Oct. 25, 1995.
<p>
   ``We might see oil at $16 a barrel,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick, an
energy trader at ABN Amro Chicago Corp. in New York.
<p>
   Corn could fall in the days ahead amid persistent concern that
global demand is weakening, leaving unwanted supplies on the
domestic market.
<p>
   Exporters sold 347,900 metric tons of corn during the week ended
Dec. 25 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported today, the
lowest since the marketing year began Sept. 1. Corn shipments so
far in the marketing year are down 21 percent from a year earlier.
<p>
   Sales have dropped as the currencies of key Asian nations
tumbled against the U.S. dollar, making imports more expensive.
Also, nations such as China have stepped up shipments on the world
market. ``We could go to $2.50'' a bushel for corn, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in Chicago.
<p>
   Corn for March delivery this week fell 6.5 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.6275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest since Oct. 2.
<p>
   U.S. farmers this autumn harvested an estimated 9.359 billion
bushels of corn, the third-largest crop on record, according to the
USDA. Because of weak global demand, U.S. warehouses as of Aug. 31
will hold 953 million bushels of unsold corn, the USDA forecasts,
up 7.8 percent from a year earlier.
<p>
   Gold could fall toward last month's 13-year low amid lingering
concern that central banks will sell more gold reserves.
<p>
   Central banks in Australia, Argentina, Belgium and the
Netherlands all sold gold in the last two years in favor of assets
such as government bonds that pay returns.
<p>
   ``Central bank selling and lending will continue at the very
least in 1998 at the rate of 1997,'' said Roy Friedman, a trader at
Rudolf Wolff &AMP; Co. in New York. ``The price of gold could drop
another $5 or $10 (in 1998); no one would be surprised to see
that.''
<p>
   Gold for February delivery this week fell $6.80, or 2.3 percent,
to $289.40 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange. On Dec. 9, gold futures fell as low as $283.30
an ounce, their lowest since February 1985.
<p>
   Further weighing on gold are expectations that the new European
Central Bank won't need to hold as much gold as member countries
currently possess when the bank starts operating on Jan. 1, 1999.
European Union bankers are expected to decide on gold holdings in
May.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bond investors had plenty
to cheer about in 1997, and there's no sign the celebration will
end anytime soon.
<p>
   Benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds, which chalked up 16.5 percent
returns last year, are poised to keep rallying into 1998, driven by
more low inflation and hearty demand for U.S. assets from around
the world, traders and investors said.
<p>
   Several investors said they're ready to buy if yields climb to 6
percent in coming days -- a level only the most optimistic bond
bulls deemed attainable a year ago. Yields fell below that
threshold for the first time in almost two years in mid-December
and today dropped to 5.84 percent, the lowest in four years.
<p>
   ``Six percent is now seen as a good buy,'' said Eric Cheung, who
manages $2.8 billion at Wilmington Trust Corp. in Wilmington,
Delaware, and sees yields falling as low as 5.75 percent by the end
of March. ``Competition is going to keep consumer prices in check
this year and the flight to quality issue is still here.''
<p>
   Kevin McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income at Dreyfus Corp.,
said he bought bonds when yields rose earlier this week to 5.98
percent. ``It was a great buy,'' he said. The New-York based firm
manages more than $90 billion in assets.
<p>
   Likewise, Doug Rogers, who helps manage $300 million in
fixed-income securities at Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee, said
he's got about 7.5 percent of his assets in cash and is ready to
buy if 30-year yields climb back to 6 percent.
<p>
   Thirty-year bond yields fell more than half a percentage point
since late October as plunging Asian stocks and currencies prompted
investors to buy U.S. government debt.
<p>
   Some economists also expect Asia's financial crisis will crimp
U.S. growth and curb inflation in coming months. That may prove a
boon for bonds because inflation erodes the value of their
principal and fixed payments. Some see weaker Asian demand slicing
1/2 percentage point or more off U.S. growth in 1998.
<p>
   Just today, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said its manufacturing index fell more than expected in December,
to the lowest reading in 11 months.
<p>
   ``It's a concrete indication of what people expected'' for the
economy, said Dreyfus' McClintock, noting that yields could fall to
5.75 before the end of the month. Consumer prices rose at the
slowest annual pace in more than a decade in the year's first 11
months and aren't likely to accelerate anytime soon, investors
said. The government's report
on December producer prices is scheduled for release next week; the
consumer price index is due Jan. 13.
<p>
   Some traders and investors question how much Treasuries can
rally with the yield so close to 5.78 percent, the lowest since the
government began regular auctions of 30-year bonds in 1977.
<p>
   ``There is so much good news priced into the market that any
disappointment could have serious ramifications,'' said Livingston
Douglas, chief investment officer at Kiewit Investment Management
in Omaha, Nebraska. If coming economic reports indicate strength,
``the handwriting is on the wall that (yields) will go up in the
first quarter,'' he said.
<p>
   Douglas and others said a growing perception that Asian markets
are stabilizing may draw money out of Treasuries.
<p>
   Some of those funds could flow into the stock market, which has
been rattled by concern that waning demand from Asia will cut into
company profits, investors said.
<p>
   Even so, McClintock said investors who buy both stocks and bonds
are likely to allocate more to fixed-income securities than in
recent years. ``Bonds will get a larger share of the flows than
they've had in the past,'' he said.
<p>
   ``It's a bond-friendly environment,'' added William Dawson, who
oversees $76 billion in bonds at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
He said yields may fall to 5.5 percent this year and his firm also
is looking to buy -- although not quite yet. Yields are likely to
trade between 5.75 percent and 6.25 percent in coming months,
Dawson said.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 4(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks could gain as the
holiday lull ends this week and the first batch of fourth-quarter
earnings meets expectations, money managers say.
<p>
   Concern that earnings might fall short of estimates has held
stocks back from records in recent weeks.
<p>
   ``If the numbers generally come in as expected or maybe slightly
positive, then the path of least resistance is higher,'' said Ted
Bridges, a vice president at Bridges Investment Counsel in Omaha,
Nebraska, which manages $1.1 billion. ``There will be a little bit
of a sigh-of-relief rally.''
<p>
   This week's calendar includes earnings from Wall Street's Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &AMP;
Co., both due on Wednesday, and Aluminum Co. of America on
Thursday. Alcoa will be the first of the 30 Dow industrials to
report.
<p>
   Stocks rose last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained
285.73 points, or 3.7 percent, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose
4.1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is loaded with
computer stocks, climbed 4.6 percent.
<p>
   Daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange averaged about 444
million shares, below the average of 559 million for the past three
months. The market was closed yesterday for New Year's Day.
<p>
   This week's calendar also works in favor of higher prices.
Stocks typically rise in January as individual investors pour their
end-of-year bonuses into retirement accounts and professional money
managers put that money to work in the stock market.
<p>
   There's no shortage of attractive stocks.
<p>
   Since the Dow industrials tumbled 7 percent on Oct. 27, the
30-stock benchmark has traded in a 767-point range as a string of
companies warned that earnings wouldn't meet expectations. Many
companies cited as the cause lower demand from Asia, where some
nations are in a financial crisis, with slumping economies and
plunging currencies.
<p>
   Computer and other technology stocks have suffered the most. The
Morgan Stanley High Tech Index is down 14.8 percent from its high
set Sept. 23, while the S&AMP;P 500 is down only 0.8 percent from its
record set Dec. 5.
<p>
   Now, many of those stocks look like bargains. ``Over the next
couple of weeks you'll have some folks snapping them up,'' said
Jeff Buyak, who helps manage $1 billion for the Stratevest
Group in Worcester, Massachusetts.
<p>
   Buyak bought shares of Sun Microsystems Inc. in recent weeks at
about 36 a share, down from high of about 53 in August. The maker
of computer workstations gained 1 5/8 to 41 1/2 today.
<p>
   Bridges recently bought shares in some of 1997's
``disappointing'' stocks, including First Data Corp., which fell 20
percent last year, and Nike Corp., which tumbled 35 percent.
<p>
   Stocks are set for a rally partly because investors have focused
so much on the high-profile announcements of disappointing
earnings, and not enough on the beneficial effects of the crisis in
Asia, said Charles Blood, director of financial markets analysis at
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. in New York.
<p>
   Some companies will benefit from lower costs, because they buy
raw materials in Asia, where the plunging currencies have made
goods cheaper in dollars, he said.
<p>
   ``We expect the clouds of worry to lift as the stock market
moves into 1998,'' Blood said. ``The bull market should broaden
enough to take not only the blue chip indexes, but also the mid-cap
and small-cap indexes, to new highs.''
<p>
   He said he expects more companies to report surprisingly good
earnings than surprisingly bad earnings.
<p>
   Investors also expect confirmation next week that the economy is
growing steadily yet with little sign of the wage or price
inflation that could push interest rates higher. That growth will
help some companies offset any drop in sales because of the Asian
crisis, analysts say.
<p>
   Producer prices for December, due to be reported Thursday, are
expected to be unchanged, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The unemployment rate, which the Labor Department
reports Friday, probably held steady at 4.6 percent last month as
an estimated 207,000 new nonfarm jobs were added, the survey said.
<p>
   ``The domestic U.S. economy remains pretty solid, and that's
really where the saving grace is,'' Blood said.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar is poised to gain
against the yen and deutsche mark this week amid expectations the
Japanese and German economies will continue to sputter in the new
year.
<p>
   Traders are likely to sell yen on concern that Japan isn't
moving swiftly enough to spur consumer spending or keep more of its
financial institutions from going bankrupt, traders said. Moreover,
many of Japan's closest trading partners are being battered by
slowing economies and plunging currencies.
<p>
   ``The yen is really suffering a confidence problem,'' said
Stephen Flanagan, chief currency trader at Erste Bank in New York.
``People have lingering doubts about the Far East and they're
looking at the world and saying, `If I've got to be anywhere, I
prefer to be in the dollar.'''
<p>
   On Friday, the dollar rose to 132.32 yen, its highest since
reaching 133 yen on May 12, 1992. Friday's gain left it up 1.65
percent this week. Last year, the dollar rose 13 percent against
the Japanese currency, its best annual performance since 1989.
<p>
   The dollar could rise to 133 yen this week, said Robert Katz,
currency trader at MTB Bank.
<p>
   The U.S. currency also rose to a four-month high of 1.8071
marks. The dollar was quoted at 1.8025 marks from 1.7973 marks
Wednesday, bringing its weekly gain to 1.62 percent. In 1997, the
dollar gained 17 percent versus the mark, its best performance
since the dollar began trading freely in 1971.
<p>
   The dollar also is seen gaining from expectations that investors
will remain attracted to U.S. financial assets.
<p>
   ``The U.S. has a strong economy with the absence of inflation,
and that's attracting some flows into the dollar,'' said Robert
Katz, a currency trader at MTB Bank in New York.''
<p>
   With U.S. inflation at its lowest level in a decade and Asia's
economic woes likely to keep global inflation tame, U.S. bonds are
poised to rally, possibly pushing yields to record lows by the end
of the month, investors said. Stocks also are seen gaining in the
first full week of 1998. Global investors buying U.S. financial
assets need dollars to pay for them.
<p>
   The dollar is being aided by speculation that the worst isn't
over for Japan. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast that
Japan's economy will grow only 0.6 percent this year, far below the
1.9 percent growth rate expected by Japan's Ministry of Finance.
<p>
   Comparatively high U.S. interest rates also help the dollar by
luring investors. Japan's benchmark discount rate, at a record low
0.5 percent, compares with the U.S. federal funds rate of 5.5
percent.
<p>
   ``The economic picture in Japan is pretty gruesome, whereas the
U.S. is a safe haven,'' said Tony Norfield, a treasury economist at
ABN Amro Hoare Govett in London. ``The big question is, will the
dollar go to 140?''
<p>
   Adding to the yen's woes, tumbling currencies elsewhere in Asia
could put the brakes on the region's growth and sap demand for
Japanese exports. Since Asian countries are among Japan's biggest
trading rivals, weakness in their currencies versus the yen makes
their exports more competitive.
<p>
   The Indonesian rupiah plunged 9 percent, to a record low, as
traders fretted that a cut in the country's debt rating by Standard
&AMP; Poor's Corp. will make it harder for borrowers to pay back debts.
The Malaysian ringgit also tumbled to a record low.
<p>
   ``You're going to have continued interest by Japanese investors
to buy dollar-yen, mark-yen, sterling-yen, any cross against yen on
dips, given that the Ministry of Finance and other Japanese
authorities still do not get the message,'' said Callum Henderson,
managing currency analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS in Hong Kong.
``That message is that the financial system is in a state of severe
difficulty at best, crisis at worst.''
<p>
   The dollar's gains may be capped by concern that the Bank of
Japan will sell dollars for yen, as it did in recent weeks. Traders
estimate the central bank sold $10 billion last month to check the
dollar's rise. The Ministry of Finance's Eisuke Sakakibara has
warned Japanese officials won't allow their currency to weaken
further.
<p>
   Also working against the dollar, a weaker yen has made Japanese
goods cheaper in the U.S., making this country's trade deficit soar
and putting more dollars in the hands of Japanese exporters to sell
for yen when bringing profits home. The dollar's strength also has
raised the ire of U.S. exporters.
<p>
   Some traders fret that if the balance of trade keeps worsening,
U.S. officials might soften their support for the dollar's
strength.
<p>
   ``People are looking to see what's going to happen in the
U.S.,'' said Ralph DelZenero, a corporate currency salesman at
First Chicago NBD Corp. in Chicago. ``They'll want to see what the
Big Three automakers have to say'' about the trade deficit.
<p>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin last month said he shared
Japan's concern over the yen's weakness.
<p>
   Against the mark, the dollar could gain on expectation that
Germany's economy isn't emerging from a five-year slowdown fast
enough to prompt the Bundesbank to raise interest rates any time
soon.
<p>
   The Bundesbank's President Hans Tietmeyer fueled that
speculation Wednesday, suggesting German interest rates would
remain on hold for the time being.
<p>
   A report due next week is expected to show that December
unemployment remained near its highest level since World War II.
Unless signs of stronger growth emerge in German economic figures,
some analysts see the dollar rallying further.
<p>
   ``The comments from Tietmeyer indicate he's not interested in
higher rates for the time being,'' said Norfield at ABN. ``The
market is dollar-bullish and will continue to push the dollar
higher, unless there's a good reason not too.''
<p>
   The Bundesbank raised its bellwether securities repurchase rate
to 3.30 percent Oct. 9. Higher rates could worsen joblessness by
making it harder for companies to borrow, expand operations and
hire more workers.

   London, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- German and French banks were the
largest European banking lenders to South Korea in the first-half
of 1997, with French banks directing more than half of their Asian
loans there, the Bank for International Settlements said.
<p>
   French and German banks each held 10 percent of the $103.4
billion in outstanding loans to South Korea at the end of June,
about the same as U.S. banks and more than the 6 percent held by
U.K. banks. Japanese banks remained the largest lenders,
representing about 23 percent of the outstanding debt, the BIS said
in its first-half bank lending report.
<p>
   ``There was a tendency for European banks to expand their
activity in Latin America and Asia at the expense of their
traditional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa,'' the BIS said in
its report.
<p>
   The report, which cites lending figures only through June 30 of
last year, comes after foreign creditors agreed last week to extend
Korean loans through January as they work with the country to craft
a longer-term solution to its debt crisis.
<p>
   ``More than half of the increase in the Asian exposure of German
banks was accounted for by Malaysia and China, while in the case of
French banks a similar proportion was directed to South Korea,''
the BIS said.
<p>
   More than 80 German banks, led by Deutsche Bank AG, agreed on
Dec. 29 to roll over an estimated $4 billion in loans to Korean
companies for 30 days. Dutch banks, French banks, Swiss banks, and
U.K. banks also rolled over some loans.
<p>
   The Bank of France said French loans to South Korea had risen
dramatically in the second-half of 1996 and beginning of 1997. It
did not say how much debt was outstanding. Societe Generale SA and
Credit Lyonnais were among the biggest lenders, analysts said.
<p>
   The BIS said about 68 percent of new loans to South Korea in the
first half of 1997 were short-term loans, or loans for up to a
year, the highest of any Asian country. Short-term loans
represented 66 percent of all new lending to Thailand, 59 percent
in Indonesia and 56 percent in Malaysia, the BIS said.
<p>
   The loans represented 62 percent of all new lending to Asia as a
whole, about 10 percent higher than the percentage of short-term
loans made to Latin American countries, the BIS said.
<p>
   Overall new lending to South-East Asia in the first half was
about $32 billion, the BIS said. Lending rose to countries such as
India, Malaysia and Taiwan and fell overall to countries such as
South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
<p>
   New lending worldwide rose to $93.3 billion in the first half of
1997, from $76 billion in the second half of 1996 and $61.8 billion
in the first half of 1996, the BIS said.

   Cairo, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The following stories appeared in
Egyptian papers.
Banks Prepared to Give Loans to Exporters At Below Going Rate
<p>
   Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, chairman of the National Bank of Egypt, the
nation's largest bank, and head of the Egyptian Bank Federation
said banks are ready to give loans at below the going rate to
successful enterprises that want to export. He didn't elaborate. He
also said selling Egypt's state-owned banks is necessary to
separate regulation from ownership. Shares in one of Egypt's four
main state banks -- National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Bank of
Alexandria and Banque Du Caire -- are due to be sold this year. (El
Ahram)
Hotel Occupancy in Hurghada 40%; Up From 10% After Luxor Attack
<p>
   Kamal Abu Kheir, chairman of Kimidar Tourist Co., which owns the
Golden Five tourist village in Hurghada on the Red Sea, said hotel
occupancy in the resort now stands at 40 percent compared with 10
percent immediately after the killing of 58 foreign tourists by
Muslim militants Nov. 17. He said he expected occupancy to return
to normal by April at the latest because of the efforts to step up
security since the attack. Mohammed Leheta, chairman of Menaville
tourist village at Safaga near Hurghada, said work has continued on
22 tourism development projects in the area since the attack. (El
Alam El Yom)
Egypt's Stock Market Regulator Suspends Four Brokerages
<p>
   The Egyptian stock market regulator, the Capital Market
Authority, suspended four brokerage companies, Horus, El Dahabiyya,
Dynamic and Team. Ahmed Taqey El Din, chairman of Dynamic said he
was told on Dec. 24 his company would be suspended for a month
starting Jan. 4 which did not leave him time to find out the reason
for suspension, or to oppose the decision in a court. In September,
a two-month suspension of two brokerages, including one of Egypt's
largest, Intercapital Securities, was shortened after Intercapital
made a legal appeal. The accusation against Intercapital was
illegal trading involving an over-the-counter sale of shares in a
Cairo bank. (El Borsa)

<p>
   Jerusalem, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli budget talks are
stalled as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks funding to
satisfy Foreign Minister David Levy, who threatened to resign on
Thursday, said a spokesman for the prime minister.
<p>
   Netanyahu and Levy have not met since the foreign minister said
he would vote against the budget and withdraw the support of his
Gesher Party's five members of parliament, said Ofir Akunis, a
spokesman for Netanyahu. The two don't have a meeting scheduled
yet, Akunis said.
<p>
   While Levy's resignation over his demand for extra social
spending would leave Netanyahu with the majority to pass the
budget, it would weaken the ruling coalition. If Netanyahu finds
the funds to meet Levy's demands, it will increase spending.
<p>
   Levy, 60, has announced he will hold a press conference at 4.00
p.m. local time. A spokeswoman for Levy declined to comment
regarding the press conference, as did Akunis.
<p>
   Israel Radio reported sources close to Levy were saying he would
not resign. Instead, he's seen demanding a re-examination of the
entire budget, said the radio.
<p>
   ``We'll see what he has to say. For now, we hope to find the
resources to fund what he wants,'' said Akunis. ``We're checking
the possibilities with the Finance Ministry.''
<p>
   Israeli stocks fell as investors waited for Levy's press
conference, which was scheduled to begin after trading closes for
the day. The Maof Index of 25 issues dropped 0.28 percent to
305.05.
<p>
   ``A lot depends on what Levy's going to say; I can't even begin
to make predictions,'' said Daniella Finn, head of the
international department at Ilanot Batucha, a Tel Aviv investment
firm.
<p>
   ``People don't expect the government to collapse,'' she said.
Investors are aware that Levy has threatened to quit several times
in the past year without actually doing it, she added. Ministry
List
<p>
   If Levy gets what he wants, the government will have to cover
the expenditure by raising taxes, selling more state assets,
redirecting spending from another ministry, or cutting the budget
across the board later in the year, analysts said.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry presented a list of proposed substitute
budget cuts to the prime minister, said Eli Yosef, a spokesman for
the Finance Ministry. He declined to specify what the proposals
were or how much money they covered.
<p>
   ``The discussions aren't finished yet,'' Yosef said. ``The
ball's no longer in our court; we've passed our list on to the
prime minister.''
<p>
   Yosef reiterated that his ministry is opposed to both raising
taxes and increasing spending.
<p>
   The parliament was supposed to have approved the 1998 budget by
Jan. 1. Instead, the government postponed until Monday a vote on
legislation that the lawmakers must pass before they can vote on
the budget, allowing officials time to negotiate with Levy.
<p>
   The daily Ha'aretz on Friday reported that Levy's demands total
1 billion shekels ($282.8 million). The paper said that any
additional allocation to Levy without offsetting cuts would push
the government past its target budget of 207.4 billion shekels.
<p>
   Without Levy and his Gesher Party MPs, Netanyahu would maintain
a 61-to-59 majority in the Knesset.
<p>
   That would make him more vulnerable to pressure from small
parties within the coalition: the 10-member Shas Party, advocate
for ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews; the nine-member National
Religious Party, a right-wing party supporting Jewish settlers; the
seven-member Israel on the Rise Party, which represents mostly
Russian immigrants to Israel, and the four-member Third Way Party,
which calls itself a centrist party.
<p>
   Levy, a former construction worker with a high school education,
said Thursday the government isn't paying enough attention to the
poor. Israeli cities beyond main population centers, plagued by
unemployment, weren't ``in the eyes of those who squandered
hundreds of millions'' of shekels, he said.
<p>
   If the budget doesn't pass in days ahead, the government is
granted an extension until March 31 on the basis of 1997 spending,
stalling plans to spur new growth. If the budget still hasn't
passed by the end of March, the government collapses, the Knesset
is dissolved, and new elections are held.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had crafted a budget that aimed to reduce
the deficit target to 2.4 percent of total economic output next
year from 2.8 percent in 1997.
<p>
   The trimmer budget comes as Israel's growth has slowed to its
lowest rate since 1989, as unemployment has hit its highest rate
since 1993, and after a general strike last month paralyzed
business, shuttering the stock exchange and banks.
<p>
   None of the budget choices is simple, said analysts. Netanyahu
and Ne'eman have pledged not to raise taxes. The 1998 budget plan
already assumes the government will take in 4 billion shekels of
revenue from state-asset sales.

   Seoul, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Financier George Soros called on
Korea to strengthen its financial institutions and introduce new
labor laws to attract foreign investment, Korea Broadcasting System
reported. Soros had dinner Sunday with South Korean President-elect
Kim Dae Jung, and also met Kim's new economic task force to discuss
Korean financial reforms, KBS said. Soros's Quantum Emerging Market
Fund currently has approximately $500 million invested in Korea.

<p>
   Tel Aviv, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli stocks dropped as
investors watched developments in the government's effort to pass a
budget within its spending limits.
<p>
   Analysts said that the market was partially buoyed by rises on
Friday among Israeli companies traded in New York.
<p>
   The Maof Index of 25 top stocks ranked by market value dropped
0.99 percent to 302.89. The Tel Aviv 100 Index, also ranked by
market capitalization, lost 0.67 percent to 291.77. The Tel Aviv
Continuous Trading Index, reflecting shares in the bourse's
continuous trading system, declined 0.66 percent to 97.41.
<p>
   Investors were ``waiting to see what'' Foreign Minister David
Levy had ``up his sleeve,'' said Ron Weisberg, an international
trader at Israel Brokerage and Investments, before Levy announced
he was quitting at a press conference which took place after the
close of trading.
<p>
   Declining stocks included Israel's three largest banks: Bank
Hapoalim Ltd., down 1.5 percent, Bank Leumi Ltd., down 1.5 percent,
and Israel Discount Bank Ltd., down 0.3 percent. Supermarket
retailer Supersol Ltd., dropped 1.1 percent and state-run telephone
company Bezeq Ltd. lost 1.2 percent.
<p>
   Offsetting the losses were Formula Systems Ltd. up 2 percent,
drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., up 2.3 percent and
Nice Systems Ltd., up 0.8 percent.
<p>
   ``Without a doubt, the story with the budget will not influence
the market positively,'' said Idan Azoulay, a fund manager at
Impact Securities.
<p>
   Weisberg said that if government has to re-examine the entire
budget, ``the market won't like it too much.''
<p>
   Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is scheduled to vote on the
1998 budget tomorrow at 2 p.m. The vote was delayed from Thursday
night after Levy said he would oppose the proposal and resign
because the budget did not answer the needs of the poor.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry has crafted a 207.4-billion shekel ($58.5
billion) budget which lowers the deficit target to 2.4 percent of
Israel's economic growth in 1998 from a target of 2.8 percent last
year.
<p>
   Clal Trading rose 2.9 percent. Clal Israel Ltd. said in a
statement its board would meet tomorrow to consider an offer from
investor Gad Ze'evi to purchase all of subsidiary Clal Trading for
about $150 million.
<p>
   On Friday, the American depositary receipts of Teva traded in
New York rose 2.6 percent and those of Formula rose 8.2 percent.

 &UR; U.S. JOB GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN DECEMBER: U.S. ECONOMY PREVIEW &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Laura Cohn &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. job machine probably
shifted into a lower gear in December, quieting concerns that
employment growth is running too fast for ever-wary Federal Reserve
policymakers.
<p>
   Though the Labor Department is expected to report Friday that
unemployment held steady at a quarter-century low of 4.6 percent
last month, U.S. companies probably created 207,000 jobs, according
to a Bloomberg News survey. That's about half November's gain of
404,000 jobs and below last year's monthly average of about
257,000. Moreover, wages probably posted a smaller increase than in
November, the survey said.
<p>
   December's expected 0.3 percent rise in workers' average hourly
earnings in particular will reassure central bankers, who worry
that higher wages raise the risk of accelerating inflation, unless
they are accompanied by gains in productivity. In November, average
hourly earnings rose 0.6 percent.
<p>
   Even with last month's presumed slowdown, job growth still bears
watching. ``The labor market will continue to be a thorn in the
Fed's side,'' said Jerry Zukowski, an economist at PaineWebber Inc.
in New York. ``Still, the Fed won't respond to it unless inflation
picks up or the Asian impact turns out to be much more limited than
they expect.''
<p>
   For now, analysts expect a downturn in Asia's economies to
reduce U.S. exports to the region, trimming U.S. growth in turn.
This quarter, the economy should grow at an annual rate of 2.4
percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
<p>
   That puts growth at about the level Fed policymakers consider
slow enough not to spark inflation -- which last year slowed to a
decade-low pace. ``We see Asia slowing the economy and holding down
prices in the first half of the year, which will keep the Fed on
hold,'' said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
in New York.
<p>
   Fed policymakers have left U.S. borrowing costs unchanged since
March, when they decided to raise the overnight bank lending rate
by a quarter point to 5.50 percent. Their first meeting of this
year is scheduled for Feb. 3-4 and few analysts expect central
bankers to even think about raising interest rates.
<p>
   Just yesterday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested the next
battle for U.S. central bankers may be to combat the effects of
falling prices -- a signal that the Fed's next move could be to cut
rates.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider
at what point effective price stability has been reached,''
Greenspan said in a speech in Chicago to the American Economic
Association. ``Indeed, some observers have begun to question
whether deflation is now a possibility, and to assess the potential
difficulties such a development might pose for the economy.''
<p>
   December's expected jobs gain should fall below November's
increase because of smaller monthly increases across the board --in
manufacturing, services and retail trade employment, according to
analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS in Belmont, California. In
November, the economy added 44,000 manufacturing jobs, 332,000
service jobs and 105,000 retail jobs.
<p>
   Nevertheless, demand for labor remains strong.
<p>
   For example, the Conference Board's index of help-wanted
advertising in 51 newspapers across the country rose in November;
help-wanted ads are up in all of the nation's nine major regions
during the past three months. ``The labor market is ending the year
on a very strong note,'' said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist.
<p>
   Separately this week, investors should get more confirmation
that inflation is hibernating. The Labor Department's producer
price index is expected to show Thursday no change for December,

<p>
   Jerusalem, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said he will hand in his letter of resignation amid a dispute
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nation's 1998
budget.
<p>
   Levy, 60, said the government had failed to care for the poor
and the unemployed and had also failed to make progress on the
Israeli-Arab peace process. He said his Gesher party, with five out
of the 120 seats in parliament, would run independently in any
future election; in the last election. It ran previously as a
partner of Netanyahu's Likud party.
<p>
   A vote on the 1998 budget has been stalled since Thursday, when
Levy threatened to resign over demands for more funding for the
weaker sectors of Israeli society. While Levy's resignation leaves
Netanyahu with the majority to pass the budget, it weakens the
ruling coalition.
<p>
   ``I've had it,'' said Levy, known as a political moderate in the
Israeli cabinet.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Netanyahu declined to comment on Levy's
announcement, made at a press conference. Earlier in the day,
Netanyahu had been looking for ways to meet Levy's demands.
<p>
   Israeli stocks fell as investors waited for Levy's press
conference, which began after trading closed for the day. The Maof
Index of 25 issues dropped 0.99 percent to 302.89.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had presented a list of proposed substitute
budget cuts to the prime minister to attempt to satisfy Levy, said
Eli Yosef, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry. He declined to
specify what the proposals were or how much money was involved.
<p>
   Yosef reiterated that his ministry is opposed to both raising
taxes and increasing spending.
<p>
   The parliament was supposed to have approved the 1998 budget by
Jan. 1. Instead, the government postponed until Monday a vote on
legislation that the lawmakers must pass before they can vote on
the budget, which would have allowed officials time to negotiate
with Levy.
<p>
   The daily Ha'aretz on Friday reported that Levy's demands were
for programs totaling 1 billion shekels ($282.8 million). The paper
said that any additional allocation to Levy without offsetting cuts
would push the government past its target budget of 207.4 billion
shekels.
<p>
   Without Levy and his Gesher party MPs, Netanyahu would maintain
a 61-to-59 majority in the Knesset.
<p>
   That would make him more vulnerable to pressure from small
parties within the coalition: the 10-member Shas Party, advocate
for ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews; the nine-member National
Religious Party, a right-wing party supporting Jewish settlers; the
seven-member Israel on the Rise Party, which represents mostly
Russian immigrants to Israel, and the four-member Third Way Party,
which calls itself a centrist party.
<p>
   Levy, a former construction worker with a high school education,
said Thursday the government isn't paying enough attention to the
poor. Israeli cities beyond main population centers, plagued by
unemployment, weren't ``in the eyes of those who squandered
hundreds of millions'' of shekels, he said.
<p>
   If the budget doesn't pass in the days ahead, the government is
granted an extension until March 31 on the basis of 1997 spending,
stalling plans to spur new growth. If the budget still hasn't
passed by the end of March, the government collapses, the Knesset
is dissolved, and new elections are held.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had crafted a budget that aimed to reduce
the deficit target to 2.4 percent of total economic output next
year from 2.8 percent in 1997.
<p>
   The trimmer budget comes as Israel's growth has slowed to its
lowest rate since 1989, as unemployment has hit its highest rate
since 1993, and after a general strike last month paralyzed
business, shuttering the stock exchange and banks.

<p>
   Jerusalem, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy resigned Sunday amid a dispute with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over the nation's 1998 budget.
<p>
   Levy, 60, accused the government at a press conference of
failing to care for the poor and the unemployed through social
spending and of failing to make progress on Israeli-Arab peace.
<p>
   ``I've had it,'' said Levy, known as a political moderate in the
Israeli cabinet, as he also ruled out any alliance at the next
election between his Gesher party, with its five members of
parliament, and Netanyahu's Likud party.
<p>
   While Levy's resignation leaves Netanyahu with a majority in
parliament, analysts said the budget was unlikely to pass as other
members of the coalition were seen joining Levy to vote against it.
Furthermore, they said early elections were likely in the wake of
the resignation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``expressed his
sorrow'' over Levy's departure and said he hopes he will
reconsider, said a spokeswoman for the prime minister. The
resignation technically takes effect in 48 hours. Netanyahu will
hold a press conference at 8.00 p.m. local time Sunday.
<p>
   ``It's virtually certain the budget won't pass,'' said Ze'ev
Chafets, a political commentator and author of several books on
Israel. Levy's resignation is ``a bad blow for the coalition,'' he
said, and elections could be in ``a matter of weeks.''
<p>
   Israeli stocks are poised to fall tomorrow morning.
<p>
   ``The Likud's in trouble and there's a great deal of
uncertainty,'' said Izhak Amieal, a trader with Etgar Ltd., a Tel
Aviv investment firm. ``I believe there will be early elections.''
<p>
   Israeli stocks fell as investors waited for Levy's press
conference, which began after trading closed for the day. The Maof
Index of 25 issues dropped 0.99 percent to 302.89. Amieal said
stocks dropped amid speculation Levy would quit.
<p>
   Levy said that while he had received a letter promising an
additional 350 million shekels ($100 million) to meet his demands,
``we're not talking about sums. We're talking about something very
deep, in the structure of the society.''
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had presented a list of proposed substitute
budget cuts to the prime minister to attempt to satisfy Levy, said
Eli Yosef, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry. Budget Deadline

   Yosef reiterated that his ministry is opposed to both raising

widow of assassinated Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has been a
shadow power in the party since her husband's death in 1991, but
has to date refused to play a public role. But analysts say the
party -- led in the past by Rajiv's mother Indira Gandhi and her
father Jawaharlal Nehru -- is unlikely to win the elections despite
Sonia Gandhi's emergence, because of corruption scandals, and party

Greenspan Suggests Fed May Need to Combat Falling U.S. Prices
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested Saturday the
next battle for U.S. central bankers may be to combat the effects
of falling prices -- a signal that the Fed's next move could be to
cut borrowing costs. Greenspan didn't say whether he agrees with
analysts who say deflation is coming, and he refrained as usual
from any direct mention of the Fed's interest-rate policy. Instead,
he noted that deflation the prices of goods and services -- which
he defined as a momentary phenomenon triggered by ``a flight from
goods to money'' -- can be as bad for the economy as inflation. (NI

IMF's Mussa Says Japanese Tax Cut Should Boost 1998 Growth

   Japan's announcement last month that it plans to cut taxes

Fund. ``One would not expect miracles from a measure of modest
proportions, but neither should one denigrate it by saying it will
do no good at all,'' Mussa told reporters at the American Economic
Association's annual conference. ``It's worth half a percent to a

   U.S. stocks rose on the first trading day of 1998 as bond yields

U.S. Bonds Rise After Manufacturing Index Shows Drop
<p>
   U.S. bonds rallied, driving yields to the lowest level in more

Asia's financial crisis is starting to drag on the U.S. economy.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about 1 1/4, or $12.50 per

percent, the lowest since October 1993. (NI BON)
U.S. Economy: NAPM Index Down as Asia Crisis Spreads
<p>
   A closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing cooled in December

production also sagged from a month earlier. The National
Association of Purchasing Management's index declined to 52.5 last
month -- the lowest reading since January 1997 -- from 54.4 in
November. Analysts expected a December reading of 54.0. A reading
of 50 or more in the NAPM index means manufacturing is expanding,
while a reading below 50 signals a contraction. (NI USECO)

India Tax Amnesty Program Brings in 100.5 Bln Rupees

The program, which ended Wednesday, asked companies and citizens to

Justice Dept. to Appeal Court Ruling in Telecom Fight
<p>
   The U.S. government will appeal a federal court decision

in an opinion handed down New Year's Eve in Texas on a lawsuit
brought by SBC Communications Inc., said the 1996
Telecommunications Act unfairly discriminates against the Baby
Bells by keeping them out of the $70 billion-a-year long-distance
market. Other local phone companies, like GTE Corp., aren't held to
similar restrictions. (NI TLS)

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Bundesbank Chief Economist Otmar
Issing said holding official interest rates high under the European
Union's single currency could create rifts at the EU's future
European Central Bank.
<p>
   ``Some people are advising the ECB to pursue a particularly
restrictive course right from the start so as to nip any mistrust
in the bud,'' said Issing in a speech on the bank at the annual
meeting of the American Economic Association. ``Such an
uncompromising approach would inevitably give rise to tensions
within the council.''
<p>
   Sky-high rates would also be unlikely to meet the approval of
``the people of Europe, given the high level of unemployment,'' he
said.
<p>
   The ECB will set interest rates under economic and monetary
union for all countries using the euro currency from its Jan. 1,
1999 start. Issing said the bank's success hinges on the strategy
it uses for setting interest rates and the choice of key staff.
<p>
   ``Public controversies about the filling of top posts damage
credibility'' in new institutions like the bank, he said.
<p>
   Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet is vying for the top
job with European Monetary Institute President Wim Duisenberg.
Trichet's candidacy, announced by the French government in
November, came as a surprise. Most observers expected European
leaders to back a single candidate.
<p>
   Issing said that central bank personnel must withstand political
pressure from national governments if EMU is to be credible.
Inflation Fighting
<p>
   He added that a decision on the inflation-fighting strategy of
the future bank is also crucial for the credibility of Europe's
common currency.
<p>
   ``It is imperative it takes a pre-commitment to which its policy
is bound and which makes it accountable,'' he said.
<p>
   Its predecessor, the European Monetary Institute, has already
said it will use either direct inflation targeting or money supply
targeting to assess inflationary pressure. The Bundesbank watches
growth of M3 money supply when setting rates.
<p>
   Money demand in the euro area should be stable enough for
German-style money targeting, he said. Issing added, though, that
it's ``advisable to supplement the strategy of monetary targeting
pragmatically'' at the start of EMU ``including some elements of
direct inflation targeting.''
<p>
   An ``appropriate strategy'' and the right choice of top
executives will temper uncertainty at the start of the euro and
prevent government bond yields from surging, he said.

<p>
   Paris, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- French Labor Minister Martine Aubry
said the government is considering doubling the minimum allowance
for the poorest recipients of welfare aged over 55 to 5,000 francs
($833) a month.
<p>
   The government's move is the latest aimed at responding to a
12-day-old protest by the unemployed for a boost in benefits. Aubry
told the French weekly Journal du Dimanche that it was time for the
protesters to end their campaign, even as they plan nationwide
demonstrations on Wednesday.
<p>
   With 3.3 million unemployed, or 12.4 percent of its work force,
France has the highest rate of unemployment among the main
industrialized countries. Economists say France's unemployment is
largely due to high labor costs and lack of flexibility in the
labor market, making it difficult to shed workers when business
slows.
<p>
   High unemployment persists even though successive governments
have subsidized several dozen job-creation programs. France spends
about 150 billion francs -- nearly a 10th of its annual 1.6
trillion-franc budget expenditure -- on those programs.
<p>
   Jobless people and their allies are demanding an end-of-year
bonus of 3,000 francs ($500) plus a rise in the minimum welfare
allowance that people who no longer qualify for unemployment
benefits get from the state. They have occupied unemployment
offices to press their campaign.
<p>
   Aubry said her government was ``welcoming'' a Communist Party
proposal to raise the minimum welfare allowance to 5,000 francs for
people over 55, who had worked over 40 years. In 1997, the minimum
allowance was 2,400 francs for a single person, and 3,600 francs
for a couple.
<p>
   It was the third measure announced since Friday.
<p>
   Yesterday, Aubry said the state will pay 500 million francs to
help meet the cost of training programs for the unemployed.
<p>
   While, On Friday, Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said
the government would pay half the cost of fares on public transport
for the poorest unemployed in the Paris area, at a cost of 370
million francs ($61 million).
<p>
   The communist-led labor union Confederation Generale du Travail,
or CGT, said in a statement that the government's offers were
insufficient and that the protest ``must go on.'' It called on
workers, the unemployed and pensioners to demonstrate across France
on Jan. 7.
<p>
   The CGT is leading the protest along with Force Ouvriere,
another union. Their main rival is the CFDT, or Confederation
Francaise Democratique du Travail, a moderate union. Along with the

   Tel Aviv, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Clal Israel, a company involved
in businesses from computers to construction, said its board will
meet Monday to consider an offer by Israeli investor Gad Ze'evi to
buy its Clal Trading Ltd. unit.
<p>
   The bid, which includes 28.5 million shekels ($8 million) for
about 17.5 million in company bonds, puts Clal Trading shares at
about 14.9 shekels ($4.17), said Samuel Gortler, a spokesman for
Ze'evi, and values the bid at $150 million.
<p>
   Shares of Clal Trading closed at 14.7 shekels, up 2.9 percent on
the day and 30.6 percent in the last two weeks.
<p>
   ``The move, in which 40 companies will be sold, is part of the
implementation of Clal Israel's strategy to focus its activities in
a number of fundamental areas,'' said Clal Israel Chief Executive
Issac Kaul in a statement.
<p>
   About two weeks ago, Clal Israel offered to buy the 11.53
percent of Clal trading it doesn't own from the public for 61
million shekels, or at a share price of 14.86 shekels.
<p>
   Ze'evi's bid also includes a proposal to invest another 150
million shekels in the operations of Clal Trading's subsidiaries.
said Gortler.
<p>
   ``We hope that there will be full response by the public and the
company,'' to the offer, said Gortler.
<p>
   Some 11.53 percent of Clal Trading's 35.6 million shares
outstanding are held by the public and tax-exempt savings funds.
The rest are owned by Clal Israel.
<p>
   Ze'evi, who has real estate, chemical, energy and automobile
importing interests, plans to run Clal Trading as a closely-held
company, said Gortler.

<p>
   Cairo, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Egyptian stocks were mixed, with
financial companies leading the decliners along with Al Nasr
Clothing and Textile Co., known as Kabo, even as it bought a
controlling stake in Alexandria Spinning and Weaving Co.
<p>
   The EFG Index of 31 companies fell 0.05 percent, or 2.86 points,
to 5359.17. Eleven stocks on the index gained, 16 declined and four
were unchanged.
<p>
   Kabo fell 2.89 percent to 99 Egyptian pounds ($29.2) in trading
of 14,850 Egyptian pounds. Its average daily volume for the first
nine months of 1997 was 1.59 million pounds. ``This is sure to add
value to Kabo, it's good news for the company,'' said Yasser El
Darwish, a broker with El Rashad Securities, who sees the shares
rising in the days ahead. Banking stocks mostly fell.
<p>
   Commercial International Bank declined 0.61 percent to 68.46
Egyptian pounds. Misr International Bank fell 0.29 percent to 101.5
pounds. El Watany Bank fell 0.88 percent to 50.55 pounds and
Egyptian American Bank declined 0.42 percent to 104.66 pounds.
<p>
   Kabo bought about 48 percent of Alexandria Spinning from the
government-owned Holding Co. for Textile Manufacturing and Trade,
ahead of two other bidders, according to Osama Mourad, deputy
manager of asset management at Commercial International Investment
Co., or CIIC, which together with Alliance Capital manages a $130
million fund, the Nile Growth Co.
<p>
   Mourad said Kabo bought about 1.863 million shares in Alexandria
Spinning at 37 pounds a share. That means Kabo paid about 69
million Egyptian pounds for the stake.
<p>
   The Holding Co. For Textile Manufacturing, which had a 54.37
percent stake in Alexandria Spinning, also sold about 6 percent of
the company to employees at 29.06 pounds a share, Mourad said,
raising about 6.8 million Egyptian pounds. It has now sold all its
shares in the company.
<p>
   The holding company had invited bids from strategic investors on
Dec. 16. CIIC's corporate finance arm advised the holding company
on the sale.
<p>
   Individuals and institutions hold the rest of Alexandria
Spinning shares.
<p>
   Kabo, a former state-owned company now held by investors, makes
mostly men's underwear, though it also produces fabric for
underwear and other garments.
<p>
   United Arab Co. for Spinning and Weaving, which according to the
stock market weekly magazine El Borsa bid for Alexandria Spinning,
gained 4.25 percent to 25.02 Egyptian pounds. The third bidder,
according to El Borsa, was the Kuwaiti Egyptian Holding Co.
<p>
   Trading in Alexandria Spinning had been suspended while the
government decided which anchor investor to choose. It closed at
29.06 Egyptian pounds in its last day of trading, Dec. 25.
<p>
   The stock gained 27.3 percent today to close at 37 Egyptian
pounds.
<p>
   Though Kabo doesn't have a majority stake in the company, it's
now the biggest single shareholder, which gives it control, Mourad
said.
<p>
   Elsewhere, Abu Qir Fertilizers fell 0.07 percent to 84.53
Egyptian pounds.
<p>
   According to an official advertisement in El Borsa, Abu Qir will
pay a 4.67 Egyptian pounds dividend from Jan. 11.
<p>
   Cement stocks mostly gained, with Suez Cement rising 0.49
percent to 69.43 Egyptian pounds, Helwan Cement gaining 0.07
percent to 67.99 pounds and Tourah Cement gaining 0.29 percent to
77.21 pounds.

<p>
    &UR; THE UNRULY QUEEN: The Life of Queen Caroline &LR; 
<p>
   By Flora Fraser. University of California, $17.95. Diana wasn't
the only Princess of Wales to object to royal hypocrisy. In this
biography, the author shows how poorly Caroline (1768-1821) was
treated by her husband, George IV, who sought to prevent the
outspoken princess from being crowned as queen. The book is ``a
complete and well-documented account,'' David Cannadine said here
in 1996.
<p>
    &UR; THE GENTLE INSURRECTION: And Other Stories &LR; 
<p>
   By Doris Betts. Louisiana State University, $13.95. Published
when the author was still in college and now restored to print,
Betts's first collection of short fiction concerns her native
South, where the characters struggle with social mores, race
relations, and, more often than not, violence and death. As the
title implies, each of the 12 stories hinges on a small but
significant rebellion. In 1954 our reviewer, Robert Tallant, called
Betts ``already ... a master of the short story form'' and ``a
candidate for an important position among those concerned with
serious and perceptive reporting in literary form of the Southern
small town and Southern people.''
<p>
    &UR; THE LIVING AND THE DEAD: Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a
Lost War &LR; 
<p>
   By Paul Hendrickson. Vintage, $15. The former secretary of
defense, so often viewed as the chief architect of the Vietnam War,
emerges in this book as a deeply conflicted man who argued
forcefully for continuing the fighting even though he doubted the
wisdom of it as early as 1965. The author also gives portraits of
people McNamara's policies affected, from a Quaker who enacted a
suicidal war protest to a former Army nurse. Hendrickson ``has
produced a work that approaches Shakespearean tragedy,'' Nicholas
Proffitt wrote in these pages in 1996. The presidential perspective
on the conflict is explored in  &UR; PAY ANY PRICE: Lyndon Johnson and
the Wars for Vietnam &LR; , by Lloyd C. Gardner (Ivan R. Dee, $18.95).
The author maintains that Johnson's commitment to the war was
fueled in part by his New Deal politics. In 1995 one critic
described the book as ``an unusually lucid and even gripping work
of scholarship.'' In  &UR; LYNDON JOHNSON'S WAR: America's Cold War
Crusade in Vietnam, 1945-1968 &LR; , by Michael H. Hunt (Hill &AMP;
Wang/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11), the author shows how the United
States failed to consider the French experience in Vietnam. The
book is ``immensely valuable,'' one reviewer wrote in 1996.
 &UR; VIETNAM 1945: The Quest for Power &LR; , by David G. Marr (Philip E.
Lilienthal/University of California, $24.95), analyzes one pivotal
year, when the Japanese withdrawal and the challenge to French rule
set the stage for future battles. In 1995 a critic referred to the
book as ``an indispensable document on understanding the roots of
American involvement in Vietnam.''
<p>
    &UR; DON'T CALL IT NIGHT &LR; 
<p>
   By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange. Harvest/Harcourt,
Brace, $11. Not surprisingly, the author's latest novel is set in
his native Israel, but it is not a landscape of political turmoil
and terrorism that he surveys, but one of discordant domesticity
between two middle-aged lovers. The narrative is ``vivid,
convincing, and haunting,'' Lorrie Moore said in the Book Review in
1996.
<p>
    &UR; CHASING GRACE: Reflections of a Catholic Girl, Grown Up &LR; 
<p>
   By Martha Manning. HarperSanFrancisco, $10. Organized in
sections whose titles are the sacraments of the Roman Catholic
Church, this memoir explores how a childhood religion has
influenced and affected an adult search for spiritual meaning.
Manning ``gives the reader the truthfulness of hard-won wisdom,''
Sharon O'Brien wrote here in 1996.
<p>
    &UR; DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN &LR; 
<p>
   By Thomas Mallon. Picador USA, $14. In 1948 Owosso, Mich., is an
important place: the hometown of Thomas E. Dewey. And just as
America is deciding between presidential candidates, Anne Macmurray
is being wooed by two men: a Republican lawyer and a union
organizer. Last year our reviewer, Jay Parini, said: ``Like one of
Shakespeare's summery comedies, the novel is about love's
madness.''
<p>
    &UR; FATHER AND SON &LR; 
<p>
   By Larry Brown. Owl/Holt, $13. Glen, a young man just released
from prison, returns to his Mississippi town in the summer of 1968
to unresolved hatreds. Taking place over just five days, this novel
``is an engrossing tale, and nicely detailed,'' Anthony Quinn wrote
in these pages in 1996.
<p>
    &UR; THE WOMAN AND THE APE &LR; 
<p>
   By Peter Hoeg. Translated by Barbara Haveland. Penguin, $12.95.
In this novel by the author of ``Smilla's Sense of Snow,'' Madelene
Burden, the unhappy Danish wife of a British zoologist, liberates a
talking ape and ends up falling in love with it. Although in 1996
our reviewer, Joe Queenan, found the story somewhat workmanlike, he
said ``Hoeg's writing ... can still be quite dazzling.''
<p>
    &UR; THE VERY AIR &LR; 
<p>
   By Douglas Bauer. Owl/Holt, $14. Luther Matthias is a radio
huckster who tries to make a fortune on baboon gonads and win the
heart of a former starlet. Their fictional travails in 1930s Texas
make ``a very funny book,'' Robert Houston wrote in the Book Review
in 1993.

<TEXT>
<p>
   ``At least 50 percent of all non-hard-sciences research on
American campuses is a lot of foolishness!'' declared the speaker,
thumping his lectern. The audience of 200 responded with laughter
and applause.
<p>
   This wasn't a revival meeting somewhere in the Bible Belt. It
was a smartly dressed gathering of the Greater Boston Chamber of
Commerce at Le Meridien Hotel in the heart of Boston's financial
district.
<p>
   The speaker was James F. Carlin, a successful insurance
executive who serves as chairman of the Massachusetts Board of
Higher Education. This hitherto inconspicuous body, which
supervises the state's 29 public colleges, served as a platform for
Carlin to attack some of the very foundations of academia: faculty
rule, research, publications, tenure and sabbaticals.
<p>
   Carlin's remark was unusual only for the scathing tone in which
it was delivered. Across the country this winter, governors,
legislators, congressmen, business leaders, university trustees and
even some faculty and students seem to have declared open season on
professors.
<p>
   ``Faculty bashing is on the rise,'' said Arthur Levine, the
well-traveled president of Columbia University's Teachers College.
``It used to be a whisper, but now people speak it loudly.''
<p>
   James E. Perley, a professor of biology at the College of
Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, and president of the 45,000-member
American Association of University Professors, confessed with no
little bewilderment that he is denounced almost everywhere he goes.
``It's 360-degree bashing,'' he said. ``All around us, people are
throwing things. I've been a teacher for 33 years, and I can tell
you it's never been this bad.''
<p>
   The main complaints are that faculties have usurped control of
educational institutions and run them chiefly for their own
benefit, not the student's; that they are accountable to no one,
and that colleges have failed to increase productivity and that
they cost too much.
<p>
   The critics also contend that all too often, students are unable
to graduate in four years because faculty members are off pursuing
hobbies masquerading as scholarship or research, and not teaching
enough sections of required courses. And, they say, as a final slap
to the taxpayers who finance public institutions, professors have
created an inflexible tenure system that guarantees them lifelong
employment at a time when almost no one but federal judges and
Supreme Court justices enjoys that privilege.
<p>
   These attacks, often heard in statehouses scrutinizing state
education budgets, have gained momentum as Congress approaches the
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, a $40-billion package
of loans, tuition tax deductions, financial aid and institutional
grants that is the single most significant piece of federal
assistance to students, colleges and universities. Behind the
complaints is the undeniable fact that most faculty members lean to
the left politically, whereas their critics are largely
conservative. There is also a natural tension between thinkers and
doers, between scholars and businessmen. And then, there is the
difficulty of measuring and evaluating what professors accomplish.
What, after all, is the love of knowledge? And how is it
communicated?
<p>
   In his speech last November, Carlin took delight in describing
the cushy life of the tenured professor, which, in his view,
includes long summer vacations, paid sabbaticals, the service of
teaching assistants, free time for outside consulting, and ``every
fringe benefit God ever invented.'' Claude Hendon, an expert who
advises the Florida state Legislature on education policy, says he
has heard similar words before from state legislators. He
illustrates the point with an image he has frequently heard in
their remarks.
<p>
   ``It is Friday morning,'' he said. ``The rest of us are headed
for a day's toil at the shop or the office. But the professor is
out there mowing his lawn. His weekend starts early.''
<p>
   Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the
States, a nonpartisan research organization in Denver, has not
hesitated to criticize faculty members for resisting change, but he
acknowledged that the current climate is ``at least a little bit of
scapegoating.''
<p>
   He said: ``Faculty get unfairly blamed when the public asks for
more than the schools can deliver. The perception used to be that
it was nice to have Princeton and the others out there. They were
helpful, but they weren't essential. Today, a college education is
seen as essential and the institutions are seen as not doing a very
good job.''

 &LR;  &HT;    And Hendon conceded that some of the attacks are unfair, given
academia's promotion system, which depends on publications, not
teaching.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``The reward system for faculty is not aligned with the
priorities of the states,'' he said. ``And that leads to great
misunderstanding.''
<p>
   Still, faculties have left themselves vulnerable by resisting
demands for accountability, in the view of Charles S. Lenth, the
director of higher education policy studies of the Education
Commission of the States.
<p>
   ``The universities have not gone through the stress of
downsizing or increasing productivity,'' Lenth said, ``so people
are asking why are professors protected from all this when the rest
of the world is not?''
<p>
   Forewarned that Carlin would attack the professoriate, members
of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, the faculty union,
filled three tables at the Chamber of Commerce lunch. Among them
was Jenny Spencer, who teaches English at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. ``I don't think Mr. Carlin understands
the essential connection between teaching and research,'' she said.
``I'm an editor of a journal called Theater Topics. That requires a
lot of very hard, interdisciplinary work, but how can I explain
that to him?''
<p>
   The professors had good reason to fear Carlin since his board
has the power to approve presidential appointments, set admissions
policies, approve academic programs, and make budget requests for
the state's 15 community colleges and 9 four-year state colleges.
The five campuses of the University of Massachusetts are more
independent.
<p>
   When Carlin called for questions, up jumped another professor,
Conor Johnston, 54, a tall man in rumpled corduroy with a shaggy
beard. An English teacher at Massasoit Community College in
Brockton, Mass., he has devoted much of his career to the study of
the Irish novels of Anthony Trollope and to organizing poetry
readings in Brockton. He challenged Carlin's assertion that faculty
members are overpaid: ``After 24 years of teaching, my annual
salary is a miserable $40,500.'' Carlin, 57, a millionaire several
times over, replied in the blunt, sometimes abrasive, language of
the board room. He said that many professors work only 12 hours a
week.
<p>
   Johnston said: ``That's like saying a professional football
player works only three hours a week because you exclude that he
was practicing for five days earlier in the week.''
<p>
   Carlin complained that faculty committees have seized authority
from college and university presidents. ``That's like telling
General Motors that the president can't get involved in making
cars,'' he said. Johnston responded by recalling the revered
university tradition of faculty governance.
<p>
   Finally, Carlin landed his heaviest punch. ``Since the end of
World War II, there has been enormous change,'' he said. ``People
moved from cities to suburbs, the interstate highways
revolutionized transportation, telecommunications has gone through
the roof, and there's been a major revolution in health care. Now
there's going to be a revolution in higher education. Whether you
like it or not, it's going to be broken apart and put back together
differently. It won't be the same. Why should it be? Why should
everything change except for higher education?''
<p>
   Whomever one blames for rising college costs, the problem is
real. Fifteen years ago, a home mortgage was the largest financial
obligation a middle-class family would undertake. Today, the cost
of post-secondary education for children, especially for families
who choose private institutions, can be an equal or greater
financial burden.
<p>
   According to estimates by the National Commission on the Cost of
Higher Education, an independent group established last spring by
Congress, the total annual cost at four-year public institutions
rose over the last decade from an average $7,107 to $10,759, up 51
percent. The total cost at private colleges has gone from an
average $15,049 annually to $20,003, up 33 percent.
<p>
   Needless to say, the statistics can be manipulated to advantage
by both those who contend that tuition continues to rise unchecked
and those who say it is rapidly coming under control.
<p>
   Some have argued that the costs have grown even more rapidly
than the National Commission's figures indicate. Testifying before
the commission at a hearing last October, Rep. Michael N. Castle, a
Delaware Republican, said that between 1984 and 1994, the cost of
transportation was up 34.3 percent, the price of sirloin steak was
up 37.5 percent, medical care leaped by 111 percent, and college
tuition soared by roughly 150 percent.
<p>
   Those figures, he said, suggest an urgent need for colleges and
universities to create more efficient structures, narrow the focus
of their teaching or otherwise downsize.

UNDATED: otherwise downsize. &QL; 
 &LR;  &HT;    Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, a former adviser to President Ronald
Reagan, and the most outspoken conservative on the commission, used
information provided by the Department of Education to describe the
situation quite differently. While the cost of attending public
universities grew by 37 percent from 1987 to 1990, and by 40
percent from 1990 to 1993, Anderson said, preliminary data from the
federal government shows that between 1993 and 1996, that cost
increased by only 3 percent.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The numbers seem to indicate, Anderson said, that ``colleges
have been quietly responding over the last four or five years to
the bad publicity they have been bombarded with on the cost of
college.''
<p>
   Whatever set of numbers one chooses, the faculty tends to catch
the blame.
<p>
   And some faculty members believe that they themselves should
bear some responsibility for the increased costs. Jacques Barzun,
the Columbia University philosopher and historian, said: ``College
faculties and administrators have exacerbated the present cost
problem by losing sight of their priorities. We have to strip
higher education down to the basics  &MD;  students, teachers, and
blackboards. Cut out all these counseling programs, opportunities
for acting, student periodicals, and guest lecturers. These things
are in themselves valuable, but if we can't afford them, they are
the things that should go, together with the personnel that operate
them.''
<p>
   In some communities, grass-roots frustration with higher
education has led elected officials to go well beyond the reforms
proposed by Carlin. Two years ago, John A. Lawless, a Republican
representative in the Pennsylvania state Legislature, held a set of
hearings around his state that struck fear into the hearts of the
faculty at state-supported colleges and universities. He concluded
that many college professors work less than full time and should
have their pay reduced accordingly. ``When are faculty going to
learn that they have to live like the rest of us?'' he demanded.
<p>
   Lawless also believes that sabbaticals are mostly junkets, and
drew laughs at one hearing when he remarked: ``Now I know why
there's a professor on Gilligan's Island. Professors travel all the
time!''
<p>
   He argues that royalties from work done on sabbatical should be
paid to the state, not the professor, and that faculty and staff
should not be handed tuition and fee discounts for their children
at state-supported schools.
<p>
   While his proposals died in committee, Lawless savored small
victories, like the state legislation he supported last year that
requires professors requesting sabbaticals to spell out the
academic purposes of any travel they propose. He said greater
success is inevitable, given increasing public support for his
ideas.
<p>
   ``Now I'm on the Internet, getting questions from people all
across the country,'' he said. ``My constituents love what I'm
doing. They don't want me to stop.''
<p>
   Last May, the National Commission on Higher Education was
established when two Republican congressmen known for fiscal
conservatism, Rep. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania and Howard P.
McKeon of California, sensing public anxiety over the cost of
college, authorized $650,000 to create the commission. It was
designed as a national forum to investigate the cost of higher
education and suggest remedies from legislation to recommendations
for the United States Education Department. The commission is an
11-member bipartisan group of college and university presidents and
others knowledgeable about higher education.
<p>
   Some members were bent on exploring the suspicion that low
faculty workloads and undeservedly high faculty salaries had been
responsible for driving up college costs. Last fall, the commission
traveled throughout the country, asking provocative, if not openly
hostile, questions like, ``Are faculties paid too much?'' and ``Do
professors work hard enough?''
<p>
   The questions raised the ire of Perley and fellow members of the
AAUP, who soon found support in an unexpected quarter. In November,
Anderson of the Hoover Institution, well known as a sharp faculty
critic, and the author of ``Impostors in the Temple: A Blueprint
for Improving Higher Education'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), said: ``There
is a lot wrong with higher education  &MD;  I even wrote a book about it
 &MD;  but the one thing that colleges can't be accused of is gouging
the public.''
<p>
   And many members of the commission appear to be siding with
Anderson, so troubling Reps. Goodling and McKeon that in December
they issued a news release angrily declaring that ``any suggestion
that we don't have a crisis flies in the face of common sense.''
<p>
   The commission was so sharply divided last month that its
chairman, William Troutt, president of Belmont University in
Nashville, Tenn., twice postponed the final report. He said the
committee had reached agreement on some measures, like a
recommendation that colleges disclose more financial information to
help prospective students and their parents better understand
college costs and financial aid.

 &LR;  &HT;    But on the central issue, Anderson is not backing down. Last
month, he said in an interview: ``Statistics indicate that these
institutions are doing a reasonably good job. The only thing that
is sure to make matters worse would be to have the federal
government leap in and try to micromanage.''
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Optimistic faculty members may think that they won a round with
the commission, but Congress is not through with them.
<p>
   House and Senate Republicans are taking a skeptical look at
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which provides federal
grants and loans for college students, tax deductions for
tuition-related expenses and aid to colleges.
<p>
   One proposal under discussion is a carrot-and-stick approach, in
which colleges that reduce tuition or increase faculty workloads
would get federal grants for their students, and those that did not
would see their aid cut.
<p>
   David Longanecker, the Department of Education's assistant
secretary for post-secondary education, said the administration
strongly opposes any such action. ``Price is a federal concern but
not a federal responsibility,'' he said.
<p>
   But a Republican staff member said that Congress may act anyway.
``People down here are sufficiently concerned about runaway college
costs that they are actually speaking of price controls,'' he said.
``That's not what we prefer, but if people in this industry  &MD;  if
you can call it an industry  &MD;  can't police themselves, we may have
to do the job for them.''
<p>
   And the faculty's role? ``Let's just say faculty are not part of
the solution,'' he added.
<p>
   College and university faculties also came under siege last year
when Congress considered phasing out Section 117 of the tax code,
which allows these institutions to offer tuition reduction benefits
for faculty, faculty dependents, graduate students and other
college and university employees as tax-free income. Section 117
also granted tax-exempt status to the TIAA-CREF retirement fund,
the major pension fund in which faculty members participate.
<p>
   Last spring, Rep. William Archer, a Texas Republican who leads
the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed taxing the tuition and
retirement benefits. Taking aim at the tuition benefit, he and
others in Congress asked why middle-class and working-class
families must struggle largely without federal assistance to meet
increasing college costs, while many tenured professors enjoy this
significant tax break.
<p>
   Faculty members said they deserved the benefit, because they had
chosen a relatively low-paying profession and performed a public
service.
<p>
   Reacting to Archer's proposal, the higher-education community
blasted Congress with thousands of letters and telegrams. In the
end, the retirement benefit lost out, while the tuition tax break
survived, at least for now.
<p>
   Open season on faculty is also generating pressure to modify or
eliminate tenure. Only a few years ago, the subject was taboo, but
today there is sharp criticism in state legislatures and in
publications like the Johns Hopkins Magazine, which recently ran a
cover story on ``the once sacred institution of tenure.''
<p>
   The effort gained momentum from a federal law that took effect
in January 1994 and prohibits mandatory retirement on the basis of
age for tenured professors. As a result, many are continuing to
teach after the age of 70, leading to warnings of a graying faculty
lecturing from yellowing notes. Levine, of Teachers College, said
that the new federal law eliminating mandatory retirement has
caused tenure to be perceived as ``a real threat to modernity.''
<p>
   As he explained it: ``Tenure is no longer a 30-year arrangement
but a 50-year arrangement, and that has people worried.``
<p>
   One result, Levine continued, has been to inspire talk about
tenure buyouts, post-tenure review (which would subject tenured
faculty to peer review after a set period of time) and similar
plans.
<p>
   One of the most explosive of the post-tenure review proposals
was promoted two years ago by William Ratliff, a Republican in the
Texas Senate who then chaired its Education Committee. Playing to
his largely rural constituency, Ratliff proposed a post-tenure
review, including the possibility of dismissal for cause, for all
faculty at publicly supported colleges and universities in the
state. ``My idea was to assess them in terms of productivity,
effectiveness and so forth, to see if we were getting our fair
share for the taxpayers' money.
<p>
   ``My proposal, which some people thought too prescriptive,'' he
continued, ``was that if you flunked the post-tenure review two
years in a row, you would lose the protection of tenure.''
<p>
   To the great relief of many Texas academicians, Ratliff moved
from the Education to the Finance Committee last year. One result
was that in May 1997, the Texas Legislature adopted a relatively
mild plan that calls for post-tenure review, but leaves it to each
institution to decide how to carry it out.

UNDATED: it out. &QL; 
 &LR;  &HT;    Sylvia Manning, vice president for academic affairs at the
University of Illinois, said that her institution, like several
others around the country under pressure from their state
legislatures, recently established a task force to draft a policy
on post-tenure review.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Meanwhile, the AAUP, among other faculty organizations, has been
fighting the spread of these reviews. Perley, for example, argues
that post-tenure review programs are useless and wasteful because
wherever they have been adopted, only 1 percent of the faculty
reviewed gets poor marks. ``So why create a whole new program to do
something that really doesn't need to be done?'' he concludes.
<p>
   Other critics argue that while most professors are liberals
intent on changing society, they dig in their heels when it comes
to their own profession and oppose anything new. A case in point,
according to Newman, is what happened at the University of Maine
three years ago.
<p>
   J. Michael Orenduff, then chancellor of the University of Maine,
decided to expand the university's reach by creating an eighth
branch consisting only of two-way television classes. The plan was
enthusiastically approved by the university's 16-member board of
trustees, but faculty members on all seven campuses rebelled and
forced Orenduff to resign.
<p>
   ``What's the message?'' Newman asked. ``It's that the faculty is
in charge, and if you try to make changes and force the issue, you
talk yourself out of a job.''
<p>
   A university official who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said: ``Give them anything new  &MD;  anything  &MD;  and they immediately
say no. I'm not just talking about the young, untenured people who
understand that promotions and tenure come through departmental
chairs rather than from interdisciplinary committees, but the most
bitter opponents of change are the older faculty who have things
the way they like them, and the world be damned.''
<p>
   Perley, president of the AAUP, testified before the National
Commission and gives speeches in defense of faculty wherever he
can, but he conceded that it's uphill work.
<p>
   ``The bottom line,'' he concluded, ``is that we have to refocus
the debate on the positive things we do. That's difficult. We've
lost touch with the public.''

<p>
   With welfare reform and the budget deficit defused as issues,
public education is shaping up as the next point of contention
between Democrats and Republicans. The debate will require fancy
footwork, given that educational financing and policy are local
matters in which the federal government plays only a minuscule
role. The shift will be especially awkward for Republicans, who
have generally viewed ``local control'' as the be-all and end-all
and have denounced even enlightened federal initiatives as preludes
to a government takeover.
<p>
   Hints of change were evident in the last Congress, when the
Republican leadership generated several school choice proposals,
all of which failed, though not before exposing the most retrograde
features of the Democratic party line on education. The most
controversial proposal set aside $7 million to pay 2,000 private
and parochial school scholarships for children trapped in the
abysmal schools of Washington.
<p>
   As a dysfunctional city run by Democrats, Washington is a
frequent target for Republicans who wish to embarrass the
opposition and grandstand for the folks back home. But the
horrendous failure of Washington's schools made the city a
legitimate target for the voucher plan. The severity of the problem
came through in a recent report from the financial control board
overseeing city affairs. The report, titled ``Children in Crisis,''
said that the city had failed ``in virtually every area and for
every grade level ... to provide our children with a quality
education and a safe environment in which to learn.''
<p>
   The study described a system that was mired in graft and
violence and had failed to determine basic information, like how
many people it employed or how many children it served. Nearly 80
percent of students could not read at even the basic level  &MD;  almost
twice the national figure. The longer these children remained in
the system, the worse they performed. The school system's chief
academic officer, Arlene Ackerman, recently described the process
as ``educational genocide.''
<p>
   The same Republicans who had sworn by ``local control'' sounded
like activist liberals, saying that vouchers would allow at least
some of Washington's children to go on to college rather than jail.
Democrats who had made careers as champions of the poor opposed the
plan, arguing that a solution that did not save every child was
unacceptable. The Democrats got the worst of the exchange. They
seemed more interested in preserving the public school monopoly
than in saving at least some children's lives.
<p>
   During the debate, an African-American father in the District
spoke for millions of others, saying he didn't care if relief came
from ``Democrats, Republicans or chickens,'' just as long as it
helped his child. The comment conveys the potency of the voucher
issue among African-Americans, who are overwhelmingly confined to
the country's worst schools and favor vouchers in far greater
numbers than do whites.
<p>
   The GOP hopes to exploit African-American discontent by
portraying itself as an advocate of choice for the poor and by
casting the Clinton administration and the teachers' unions as part
of the horrendous status quo. Given these politics, the expansion
of programs that offer private education at public expense is
inevitable, if only in inner cities, where letting the poorest
students flee to private schools is the only moral thing to do.
<p>
   But despite its popularity as a political tool, the voucher
strategy amounts to no more than tinkering at the margins of an
enormous problem. Among the millions of children trapped in
inner-city schools, not even 10 percent could find private school
placements if they were given vouchers tomorrow. One survey in
Washington found that the city's private and parochial schools
would have trouble absorbing even 2,000 voucher students, in part
because the proposed scholarships fell far short of tuition costs.
<p>
   If Congress wants to improve American schools, it will need to
wade into issues like school construction, teacher training and,
most crucially, national standards establishing what children need
to know and when. If Congress bypasses these issues  &MD;  and history
suggests that it will  &MD;  the coming debate will consist mainly of
noise and empty irrelevancies.
<p>
   The voucher idea originated 40 years ago with the free-market
economist Milton Friedman. Friedman argued that students should be
permitted to transfer from failing public schools to successful
private schools, taking public dollars with them. This strategy, he
predicted, would force the worst schools to close and mediocre ones
to shape up. His critics countered that a voucher system would skim
off the brightest students, promote white flight and leave
inner-city schools black, poor and bereft of a viable tax base.
This happened, anyway  &MD;  not through vouchers, but through
middle-class flight brought on by worsening schools.
<p>
   Friedman's proposal died shortly after birth, but was recently
resurrected in the form of scholarships aimed at the poorest of the
poor. Three-fifths of the states have choice programs that allow
movement among public schools; several others are considering plans
that would allow low-income families to escape the worst inner-city
schools for private schools and  &MD;  if the courts allow  &MD;  parochial
schools as well. The congressional plan was modeled on publicly
funded voucher programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland. The two
programs, which have fewer than 5,000 students between them, have
come under heavy attack from the educational establishment. The
record shows in grim detail how difficult it is to break a
public-school monopoly.
<p>
   That the Milwaukee program has survived is something of a
miracle. The scholarships are limited to $3,000  &MD;  less than half
what the public schools spend per pupil  &MD;  insuring that many
students would enroll in schools that lacked financial stability.
The schools were forced to accept children at random, to insure
that there would be no skimming for the best and brightest.
Enrollment was limited to 1.5 percent of the student body, making
certain that thousands of children would remain in failing schools
that graduate almost no one. Yet, despite the obstacles, recent
studies have shown measurable improvements in test scores for
students who were lucky enough to get the vouchers.

<p>
   The Cleveland program was just as penuriously financed, but
somewhat better organized. Unlike the Milwaukee program, it allowed
families to choose not only private but also parochial schools,
thus greatly expanding the options. The program now includes 3,000
children, who receive up to $2,500 each and attend 55 private and
parochial schools. A recent study by the Harvard Program on
Educational Policy and Governance examined test scores for about
one-fifth of the voucher students and found that since leaving
public schools, most had made measurable gains in English and
dramatic gains in math.
<p>
   Critics argued that private schools would reject the poorest and
most difficult students. But of the children who use the voucher
program in Cleveland, 75 percent are poor and two-thirds are black.
Critics also suggested that poor parents would be incapable of
choosing private schools and would do so on irrational grounds.
<p>
   The Cleveland parents, however, were as rational as they come.
About 85 percent said they took part in the voucher program for
academic reasons, with close to 80 percent citing safety as an
additional concern. The Harvard study found that two-thirds of the
voucher parents were ``very satisfied'' with the academic quality
of the school, compared to fewer than 30 percent of the parents of
students who remained in public schools.
<p>
   Teachers' unions and other groups challenged Cleveland's program
on constitutional grounds, arguing that it violated the separation
of church and state. But this is a thin reed, growing thinner all
the time. An Ohio state judge rejected this argument, allowing the
program to continue, pending rulings in a higher court.
<p>
   In an intriguing decision, the Ohio judge, Lisa L. Sadler, found
that the voucher scholarships were not subsidizing religion. On the
contrary, the judge seemed to argue that the voucher students were
no different from college students who are allowed by law to use
federal grants and scholarships at religious colleges.
<p>
   Enemies of the Cleveland program can expect little solace from
the U.S. Supreme Court, which has signaled in several cases its
readiness to weaken church-state barriers in education. The most
recent signal was Agostini vs. Felton, in which New York City was
permitted to deliver federally mandated remedial services to
children on parochial school grounds instead of in trailers just
off parochial school property.
<p>
   The teachers' unions are understandably worried.
<p>
   But in carrying the fight, some union activists are advancing
disturbing and even sinister arguments about inner-city children.
The most common is that vouchers should be disallowed because they
benefit the few while leaving out the many.
<p>
   The unions also argue that data showing improvement among the
voucher students has been cooked and can't possibly be real. In
essence, these critics are making a claim that no parent would
accept: that orderly, well run private schools can't possibly be
better than horrendously run public schools. Taken to their logical
conclusions, these arguments assert that inner-city schools are
doing the best they can with what they are given.
<p>
   What this means is that the teachers' unions have lower
expectations for African-American children than for whites.
Inner-city parents are caught between cynical Republicans, who use
them to bludgeon Democrats, and cynical Democrats, who patronize
them and sacrifice their children to the vagaries of politics.
<p>
   But surveys and focus groups show quite clearly that
African-Americans want out of the decrepit and unsafe city schools.
Recent survey data from David Bositis of the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization
that specializes in racial issues, show that African-Americans have
a dimmer view by far of public education than whites.
<p>
   A solid majority of whites view their schools as either good or
excellent, but only about a third of African-Americans and 40
percent of Latinos are satisfied with their schools. Nearly 80
percent of blacks and more than 85 percent of Latinos say the
government spends too little on education, as opposed to about 60
percent of whites.
<p>
   Whites are evenly split on the issue of whether to issue
vouchers for use in public, private and parochial schools. But
African-Americans and Latinos are heavily in favor of such a
system. Among African-Americans ages 26 to 35, 86.5 percent favor
vouchers.
<p>
   In addition, Bositis' studies show that black support for
vouchers jumped by about 19 percent in a single year, from 1996 to
1997. These numbers spell trouble for the Democrats, who have been
trying to persuade African-Americans to keep the faith with schools
that destroy their children's futures. The same congressmen who
stood tall for a voucher program that would have reached only 2,000
children in Washington cowered when it came to reform that would
have benefited every school child in the country.
<p>
   The issue in the last Congress was the Clinton plan for a
voluntary national test that would allow parents to know exactly
where their children stood with respect to state, national and even
world standards.
<p>
   The current patchwork of tests includes vague scoring statements
that allow school districts to obscure how badly they are doing.
The only way to clarify things is through clear, standards-based
tests that permit local, national and international comparisons.
Congress lacked the courage even for this.
<p>
   Republicans argued that a national test would erode local
authority and lead to a government takeover of the schools. Black
and Hispanic Democrats complained that such a test would further
stigmatize minority students, who would inevitably perform worse
than whites.
<p>
   What really scared Congress was the prospect that parents would
find out exactly where their schools stood  &MD;  and hold lawmakers and
school officials accountable as never before. On the whole,
American schools are far better than most critics wish to admit,
particularly at the high end, where they easily rival the best that
Japan and Western Europe have to offer.

<p>
   The problems lie at the low end, with inner-city schools at the
bottom of the heap. The obvious thing to do is to apply standards
used at the very best schools to all the rest, while providing the
resources and roadmaps to make the new standards achievable.
<p>
   But having balked at a national test, Congress seems to have no
appetite for going where no American has gone before. American
education was hobbled from the start by the twin presumptions that
mediocrity is acceptable and that excellence is available only to
the privileged few.
<p>
   The story of how this happened can be found in the philosopher
Richard Hofstadter's book ``Anti-Intellectualism in American Life''
(Alfred A. Knopf), which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964. In the
mid-1890s, a prestigious national task force called The Committee
of Ten called for a strong academic curriculum for all high school
students  &MD;  whether or not they planned to attend college.
<p>
   The Ten decried the ``feeble and scrappy'' courses offered in
American schools and advocated a rigorous regime that included four
years each of foreign language, English and literature, three to
four years of science and math, and two to four years of history.
The committee said that a strong academic curriculum was especially
important for students not bound for college, to prepare them to
participate knowledgeably in democracy.
<p>
   If all this sounds familiar, it's because it is. In 1983, the
National Commission on Excellence in Education sounded the same
themes in its report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' which warned against a
``rising tide of mediocrity'' and pointed out that American
children were losing ground compared with their peers in Europe and
Japan. Echoing The Ten, ``A Nation at Risk'' insisted on extensive
education in English, math, science, social studies and computer
science  &MD;  for every high schooler, regardless of background or
vocational interest.
<p>
   The national standards movement that grew out of that report
started in the right direction, but was burned up during the
culture wars, when the subject of standards became highly
politicized. Things are pretty much where The Ten left them in
1894. Back then, bureaucrats subverted the committee's plan,
arguing that it was too demanding and that rigor would be lost on
the poor and especially women, who were destined to be housewives,
anyway.
<p>
   Science and math became ``industrial arts'' and ``household
science.'' The result was a tracking system that sorted students in
terms of ``ability groups'' that were often proxies for race,
gender or class. Hofstadter called this the most antidemocratic
moment in the history of American education. The Boston University
educator Paul Gagnon describes the process as triage for the
masses, noting that 80 percent of the population is consigned to
the nonacademic scrap heap by junior high school.
<p>
   As a consequence, a disadvantaged child has a better chance at a
rigorous education in Paris, Copenhagen or Tokyo than in New York,
Chicago or Cleveland. West Germany and Scandinavia have much to
teach us, as do Singapore, South Korea and especially Japan, whose
schools are ranked in international studies as the best in the
world. But even if Americans copied Japanese techniques, the view
of human potential that makes them work would be far more difficult
to acquire.
<p>
   Japanese push their children to achieve because they see
excellence as the product of hard work. Americans tacitly accept
failure because they view it as the product of diminished ``native
intelligence.'' Voucher programs and charter schools are logical
parts of a broad educational mix. But in terms of what ails us
nationally, they are no more than pop guns deployed against a
battle ship. At the barest minimum, Americans need to reach a
national consensus about standards  &MD;  and about what children need
to learn and when they need to learn it.
<p>
   A Congress that fears even voluntary national testing is
unlikely to embark on so politically charged a mission in the
absence of strong, bipartisan leadership. Unless that leadership
arises very soon, the debate on school reform will be sound and
fury, signifying nothing.

<p>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.  &MD;  Getting in to see John Casteen III is no
easy matter. As president of the University of Virginia, one of the
nation's premier colleges, he is often on the road, raising money
for a $750 million capital fund drive that does not end until the
year 2000. When he is on campus, he is tightly scheduled. Early in
the morning, appointments begin to back up in the elegant waiting
room outside his Madison Hall office. Alumni, faculty,
undergraduates, doctoral candidates, state legislators, bankers,
the student reporter from The Cavalier Daily Q  &MD;  they all want a
few minutes.
<p>
   But one afternoon in early December, the busy president abruptly
canceled his appointments and drove two hours from the
Charlottesville campus to Reston in northern Virginia, to visit the
parents of Leslie Baltz, an honors student in the Class of '98.
<p>
   Casteen makes these visits once or twice a year, though he is
never sure if the parents will want to see him, given the
circumstances. That previous weekend, Ms. Baltz, a 21-year-old
senior who was on the dean's list every semester, was drinking
heavily. There are some who believe she was doing her ``fourth-year
fifth,'' the longstanding practice of University of Virginia
seniors to consume a fifth of liquor for the last home football
game.
<p>
   Seeing how drunk she was that Saturday afternoon, her
girlfriends left her on a couch upstairs at one of their
apartments, then went to the game against Virginia Tech. When the
friends returned at 9:30 that evening, they opened the apartment
door and there was Ms. Baltz at the foot of the stairs,
unconscious, face up, her legs slanting up the stairway. The
friends called 911, and she was rushed to the university medical
center.
<p>
   This is not a rare occurrence. Every weekend, between 3 and 10
University of Virginia students arrive in the emergency room with
alcohol poisoning or an alcohol-related injury. That same day,
another student had such severe poisoning from bingeing on bourbon
at a tailgating party that he stopped breathing and was placed on a
respirator in the same intensive care unit as Leslie Baltz.
<p>
   A blood sample showed Ms. Baltz's alcohol level was .27  &MD;  more
than three times the state limit for intoxication. From the
internal injuries to her brain, authorities surmised that the
honors student had risen from the upstairs couch at some point,
then fallen down the apartment stairs, head first.
<p>
   ``Generally speaking, the families don't want to see me, but
some do,'' Casteen said. ``One comes into the family's life as an
invader. You go in the family's home, and what you're dealing with
is their awareness it will never be the same again. A child who was
a treasure, who was precious, and you see the physical leavings are
all over the family's lives. All the remnants of their achievements
in grade school, their clothing, their awards, their photographs  &MD; 
sometimes an automobile  &MD;  they're all there. A family is dealing
with that lost child and you know that it will never be the same.
<p>
   ``In my family,'' continued Casteen, the father of two
teen-agers, ``the way we deal with grief or joy is through
religious practices, but that's not part of what we can do; this is
a public institution. The culture is very secular. What I can say
is, I feel sorrow. I offer whatever help. Mostly what I do is
listen, often for a couple of hours.''
<p>
   On Nov. 30, Leslie Baltz became the fifth Virginia college
student to die in a month's time in alcohol-related accidents.
<p>
   Three  &MD;  from Virginia Tech, Virginia Commonwealth and Radford
University  &MD;  were killed in drunk driving crashes. Another, an
18-year-old Virginia Tech freshman who was sleeping off a night of
heavy partying, rolled off her bed, out her dorm window and fell
eight stories.
<p>
   This string of death followed the much publicized drinking
deaths earlier in 1997 at MIT and Louisiana State University, and
numerous less publicized ones at Fordham University; Hartwick
College in Oneonta, N.Y.; Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y.; St.
Mary's University in Winona, Minn.; the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst; Pennsylvania State University; the State University
College at Cortland, N.Y.
<p>
   Virginia officials were spurred to take action: they convened a
daunting number of task force committees and subcommittees on ways
to curb binge drinking by students. State Attorney General Richard
Cullen led the way, assembling a 38-member task force that includes
14 of Virginia's college presidents.
<p>
   But while there is no shortage of alcohol task forces across
America  &MD;  like tombstones, they tend to appear wherever a student
dies  &MD;  there is a noticeable shortage of solutions. It is not even
clear whether more college students are dying from alcohol these
days, or if it's a matter of the media paying more attention to the
issue lately because of a few sensational cases. Several public
health experts say they know of no long-term national statistics on
college alcohol fatalities.
<p>
   Indeed, in some respects it appears that a substantial number of
today's students have a more conservative attitude toward alcohol
than the previous generation.
<p>
   In 1980, 9.5 percent of college students nationwide said they
abstained from alcohol; by 1996, 17 percent did, according to an
annual survey by Professor Lloyd Johnston of the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
<p>
   In 1980, 6.5 percent reported drinking daily; today, 3.2 percent
do. Even the number of binge drinkers may be declining: in 1980, 44
percent reported binge drinking; today, 38 percent do.
<p>
   At the University of Virginia, which has a reputation as a
hard-working, hard-partying school (one of the unofficial mascots
is the wahoo, a tropical fish that can drink twice its weight), the
administration appears to have made some headway. During the 1980s,
it got rid of Easters, the massive, weekend-long drunken fraternity
block party that was held on Rugby Road each spring and attracted
wahoos from all over the East Coast.
<p>
   As Chris Jeffries, the head of the Inter-Fraternity Council, put
it: ``I really do believe it's calmed down some. You don't see kegs
flying through the windows any more.''
<p>
   The university has a substance abuse center, a program to train
bartenders how to keep drinking under control, classes in alcohol
abuse, an alcohol awareness week, a free taxi program so drunken
students don't have to drive, nonalcoholic social events and
student alcohol patrols.

<p>
   Each year, Virginia runs national conferences to teach other
universities how to handle substance abuse in their athletic
programs. Indeed, a 1996 report, ``Promising Practices: Campus
Alcohol Strategies,'' by David Anderson, an associate research
professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., singles out
the University of Virginia as having one of the dozen best campus
programs in the country.
<p>
   Still, Ms. Baltz died in November, and Lumsford McGowan died in
a drinking accident the year before, and Brian Cook the year before
that.
<p>
   What university officials here and across the country fear they
are seeing is a substantial number of students who drink
excessively and dangerously, and don't seem reachable. The most
recent survey at the University of Virginia reports that of
students who drink, 25 percent were binge drinking three or more
times in the previous two weeks.
<p>
   ``It's one thing to drink a little to get buzzed,'' said Cheryl
Battles, a senior, ``but I'm amazed at how many people here drink
to get wasted  &MD;  `Oh man, you were bombed last night, you were
hysterical, you were throwing up all over the place.' ''
<p>
   Dr. James Turner, head of the university's student health
services, said that while the number of drinkers may be down,
``we're seeing more serious problems in our emergency room.'' He
said a generation ago, a significant number of students wanting to
get high used marijuana, while today it is mainly alcohol.
<p>
   ``Now, please don't make it sound like I'm endorsing
marijuana,'' he said. ``I'm not. But the problems of marijuana are
different. They're not as severe. You don't have the violent
behavior; you don't have the sexual aggression; you don't have the
poisoning.''
<p>
   As part of their training, upper-class students who are chosen
to supervise dorms as resident assistants are taught how to keep
very drunk students alive. ``We have an ER doctor teach them how to
lie the drunk students on their side and hold their heads up, so
they don't choke on their own vomit,'' Turner said.
<p>
   When adults hear that 3 to 10 drunken students at one of the
finest universities in America wind up in the emergency room each
weekend, they are shocked, but it does not make much of an
impression on the young.
<p>
   ``We have 18,000 students on campus,'' Turner said. ``If 40
percent are bingeing, that's thousands and thousands, so to them,
the risk is low. Fear-based education  &MD;  getting up in their faces
and saying, `You're going to die''  &MD;  isn't going to work. They
don't believe it.''
<p>
   When it comes to alcohol, educators have found that every
solution is accompanied by a fresh set of problems. To control
drinking on campus, Louisiana State University banned liquor at
fraternities and campus events. Then, in August, 20-year-old
Benjamin Wynne drank himself to death at an off-campus fraternity
party at a local bar. Suddenly, LSU officials found themselves
wondering if it might be better to allow drinking on campus again,
so they would at least have some say in regulating it.
<p>
   The 21-year-old drinking age is a major headache for college
administrators. In the mid-1980s, the federal government threatened
to cut off highway funds to any state that did not raise the
drinking age from 18 to 21; by 1988, all 50 states had complied.
That policy has measurable benefits: the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration estimates that the older drinking age saves
the lives of 800 18- to 20-year-olds each year.
<p>
   On the other hand, a drinking age of 21 makes it very hard for
administrators to teach students to drink moderately, when
three-quarters of the campus is not supposed to be drinking at all.
At colleges across America, the legal drinking age may be a joke,
but it is not a joke that university administrations can
participate in.
<p>
   At the University of Virginia, the most recent health survey
indicated that over 75 percent of under-age students drank, and
over half of the under-age students had been intoxicated in the
previous two weeks. Turner said 70 percent of the drunken students
they see in the emergency room are under age.
<p>
   As a parent, University of Iowa president Mary Sue Coleman let
her son, Jonathan, now 26, drink at home when he was under age.
<p>
   ``We didn't want him to think alcohol was a totally forbidden
substance,'' she said. ``We'd have a glass of wine or beer with
dinner. Always in moderation.''
<p>
   Would President Coleman say this to her 18,000 undergraduates at
Iowa? ``Oh no,'' she said. ``I'm not going to tell students I
expect you to drink if you're under 21. I don't want them to get
the message that we're winking at state law.''
<p>
   Students mock the hypocrisy of their elders, as administrators
try to figure out where to draw the line on alcohol. At Iowa and
Virginia, the campus police do not enforce drinking rules at
tailgate parties before football games, but are aggressive about
limiting alcohol in the stadiums.
<p>
   ``The students see all our efforts to control the flow of liquor
into the stadium,'' Casteen said, ``which seems comical in light of
all the tailgate drinking in the parking lots. They see a place
where we control things and where we don't.''
<p>
   The students also see pervasive, often dangerous under-age
drinking at the private, off-campus fraternities being ignored by
the administration, but what they rarely see these days is a
responsible professor or administrator taking a casual drink at a
social event.
<p>
   ``We don't have sherries,'' Casteen says. ``It's orange juice
and bottled water.''
<p>
   One of the last vestiges of a social drink together, the
architecture department's Friday afternoon beer gathering with
students, was ended in 1995.
<p>
   Robert Canevari, the dean of students at the University of
Virginia, said when the drinking age was 18, his staff would keep
beer in the office refrigerator and on Fridays, and at the end of
the work day, sit with students and have a drink. Now, he said: ``I
try to avoid all occasions where undergrads have alcohol. I don't
want to see it.''
<p>
   Casteen added: ``I'm not the funniest character in town. But I
don't even joke about drinking any more.''
<p>
   In forming the statewide task force, Attorney General Cullen, a
Republican, had suggested exploring whether it would make sense to
lower the drinking age.
<p>
   ``It's worth at least asking if more problems aren't being
created by the forbidden-fruit mentality,'' he said.
<p>
   But before he could even fax assignments to all his
subcommittees, newspapers across the state were carrying articles
quoting outraged legislators who were dead set against any change
in the drinking age. A headline in The Cavalier Daily summed up the
prospects succinctly: ``Not gonna happen.''
<p>
   The university formed its own task force after the Baltz death,
and one of its focuses is the fraternities, which even fraternity
brothers acknowledge are the biggest source of under-age binge
drinking. For years, the college has generally taken a hands-off
approach, reasoning that fraternities are private, off-campus
residences.

<p>
   But lately, there have been signs that attitude is changing.
Faculty senate president Jahan Ramazani has proposed moving the
fraternity rush from the first semester of freshman year to
sophomore year, so incoming 18-year-olds have a chance to know more
about college life before committing to a social system so steeped
in alcohol. He also believes that raiding the fraternities once in
a while might be useful.
<p>
   ``No one thinks of venturing into a frat house,'' he said.
``There's this mystical quality of not crossing that line. If cops
went in a couple of times and made arrests, it could change the
pattern of behavior.''
<p>
   Indeed, less than a week after Ms. Baltz's death, state agents
raided a Virginia Commonwealth fraternity, arresting 52 students in
a crackdown on under-age drinking.
<p>
   But ax-wielding policemen did not stop liquor from flowing
during Prohibition in the 1920s, and hauling all the frat brothers
off to jail isn't likely to, either. The two most recent alcohol
fatalities at the University of Virginia have involved seniors who
were over 21, drinking at off-campus apartments.
<p>
   Changing the binge drinking culture, public health officials
say, is a long, slow process that requires a good deal of resources
for education and advertising at a time when the federal commitment
is near zero.
<p>
   In 1987, the Reagan administration provided $8 million in seed
money to start substance abuse institutes on 100 campuses. By the
end of the Bush administration, funding had climbed to $14 million,
but this year, under President Clinton, just $1.7 million in grants
was awarded to seven colleges.
<p>
   Today, schools like Virginia, which have kept their programs
going with private funding, are the exception, says Anderson of
George Mason. In a few cases, foundations have provided grants,
although they have not nearly made up for the loss of government
funds.
<p>
   This year, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave about
$700,000 apiece over a five-year period to Lehigh University and
the universities of Iowa, Vermont, Colorado, Wisconsin and
Delaware, to develop coalitions with their local communities, aimed
at curbing high-risk drinking.
<p>
   Finances are tight at the University of Virginia: the state has
cut its fiscal appropriation to the university by 30 percent in the
last decade. So there is little money available for campus
officials trying to put together a new publicity campaign aimed at
teaching students to drink moderately.
<p>
   ``You need a budget for shiny posters, advertising, a video
campaign,'' said Susan Tate, who will oversee the Virginia effort.
``If I had 1 percent of the millions Budweiser has to advertise, I
might be able to make a dent. But with what we have  &MD;  we'll just
have to see what we can do.''
<p>
   Researchers consider a person who has had five drinks on one
occasion during the previous two weeks to be a binge drinker. By
that definition, Ryan Dabbieri, a 22-year-old University of
Virginia senior, was a binger, although he did not think of himself
that way. ``I didn't drink a lot,'' said Ryan, an electrical
engineering major. ``Maybe once a week, I'd do five, maybe six or
seven drinks in two hours. What I drank was pretty typical.''
<p>
   He was looking forward to the Nov. 29 Virginia Tech game, the
season finale. At a tailgating party that Saturday afternoon, Ryan
drank bourbon with several friends. ``I was pouring and I was very
excited about the game and, apparently, I was pouring two or three
times as big shots for myself as everyone else,'' he recalled. ``I
didn't realize it. I remember maybe three shots, I can't remember
after that, but my friends said I actually drank 5 or 6 big shots
in 10, 15 minutes.''
<p>
   Police did not bother tailgaters, but as fans poured into the
stadium, there was security everywhere, looking for alcohol. `` was
pretty out of it,'' Ryan said. ``One of my friends said, `You'll
have to sober up to get in.' I tightened up to get through, then
once I was in, I sort of fell apart.''
<p>
   He doesn't remember the rest, but has since pieced it together
from friends and doctors.
<p>
   When he began throwing up in the stands, the two women he was
with decided they had better get him out of there. It was a lot of
work lugging him back to the car  &MD;  6 feet, 1 inch and 165 pounds of
dead weight. As they passed, people made sly comments about ``doing
your fourth-year fifth.'' His friends planned to drive him home and
put him to bed, but one of them was a lifeguard trained in first
aid, and when Ryan didn't come to, they took him to the hospital as
a precaution. At the emergency room, they got a wheelchair and
rolled him in, and about then, he stopped breathing. When doctors
realized it, they raced to put him on a respirator. They estimated
his breathing had stopped for four minutes and did a brain scan to
check for damage.
<p>
   His blood alcohol level was .25.
<p>
   He came to the next morning in the intensive care unit, but was
still so drunk that he didn't realize why he was in the hospital.
When he tried to talk, the tube in his throat prevented him, and on
a piece of paper he wrote, ``What happened?'' That evening, he
said: ``I woke up and my Dad was standing there. He'd come in from
Atlanta. My parents are divorced, and I don't see him often, so it
was a big shock to me  &MD;  that's when I realized I'd almost died.''
<p>
   He says the experience was hardest for his friends, who saved
his life. ``They were by my side the whole time, scared to death I
would die,'' he said. ``Being unconscious, I missed all the emotion
of it.
<p>
   ``I don't see myself drinking again,'' he added. ``I'm lucky not
to be dead.''
<p>
   On Monday, Dec. 1, at 3 in the afternoon, less than 48 hours
after he had stopped breathing, Ryan Dabbieri walked out of the
hospital, returning to finish the semester and prepare for exams.
<p>
   Leslie Baltz lived through that same Saturday night in the same
intensive care unit, but the next morning, when a brain scan showed
no activity, her parents made the decision to have life support
withdrawn. She was pronounced dead at 10:15 Sunday morning. The
Baltzes donated her organs, and later that week she was cremated.
<p>
   Neither the Baltzes nor their daughter's friends have talked to
the press, and the Charlottesville police have released only basic
information, saying the family has suffered enough.
<p>
   On campus, the biggest unanswered question is why friends left
her alone in that condition. The health service has since run a
full-page ad in the The Cavalier Daily with a list of things to do
when students pass out drunk, including making sure someone stays
with the unconscious person.

   Det. Richard Hudson handled the Baltz investigation,
interviewing the friends, including one of the girlfriends who
found her. ``As you talk to them,'' he said, ``you can see them
begin to recognize their mortality. They tell you, `It's not
possible, I just saw her.' ''
<p>
   During his 11 years as a detective, he has handled ``six or
eight'' college drinking deaths. ``All these kids are nice, and
their families are nice people,'' he said. ``You get the sobbing
people, they want to know what happened; it's awful, all these nice
people sobbing.
<p>
   ``Tomorrow morning,'' Hudson said, ``at the memorial service,
there'll be all these sobbing people. And by evening, a lot will be
drinking again. Some of them won't, but if I were to hazard a
guess, I'd say more will be drinking than not.''
<p>
   Friday, Dec. 5, was a brilliant sunny morning with a crisp blue
sky and a late fall chill in the air. By 10:30, the main gallery at
the university's Bayley Art Museum was filled to overflowing with
about 200 people, mostly students: young women in tasteful, dark
wool outfits and young men in conservative suits, there for Leslie
Baltz's memorial service.
<p>
   In an hour's time, two dozen people spoke, ranging from the head
of the art department to a friend who had spent nine summers with
Leslie at overnight camp. Leslie was a double major in studio art
and art history, and one of her paintings was placed on an easel,
by the podium.
<p>
   Her professors recalled an excellent student, with a 3.92
average out of 4.0 in art and a 3.67 overall. They mentioned the
semester she spent abroad, in Florence, and the senior essay she
was preparing on Polish-born sculptor Elie Nadelman. ``I can say it
really was promising work,'' said Prof. Matthew Affron.
<p>
   Christy Ullrich, a friend, described visiting Leslie in Rome,
and recalled how, late at night, when they needed to get home and
did not have a transit pass, Leslie decided they would just jump on
a bus. ``She said, `Oh forget it, let's just hop on. If any men in
red suits get on, just jump out the back door.''
<p>
   Friends mentioned her piercing green eyes, and how beautiful she
could look at a party, dancing in a dress with no shoes.
<p>
   Michelle Mandolia, a roommate, said that when she and Leslie
couldn't get all their studying done at night, they would set their
alarms for early morning, put on coffee and work in the predawn
darkness. She said when she thinks of Leslie, she sees her studying
in a heavy sweater, curled up on the couch with wool socks. She
recalled how Leslie liked eating chocolate chips by the handful
straight out of the bag and picking marshmallows out of her Lucky
Charms. She described how Leslie would come home at night from her
part-time job at the university's music library, announce she would
be up for several more hours, studying, then immediately fall
asleep in her clothes. And she remembered the time Leslie baked a
tuna casserole in the oven with the Saran Wrap still on the top.
<p>
   Hudson was right: the memorial service was full of all these
nice people sobbing. And he was right again: that night, the
fraternities along Rugby Road and the bars on The Corner were
crammed to capacity with glassy-eyed students drinking all kinds of
concoctions from paper cups.
<p>
   Turner, of student health services, called it ``a pretty typical
weekend  &MD;  three or four alcohol cases in the emergency room.''

<p>
   DETROIT  &MD;  The nation's automakers and car dealers will probably
find themselves working harder this year just to sell the same
number of cars and trucks that they sold last year. For shoppers,
that could mean lower prices.
<p>
   Why? Partly because trends in the global economy have filtered
back to car dealers on Main Street. The weak Japanese yen has made
it painless for Toyota and Honda to lower prices, and the Big Three
American automakers have been forced to try to follow suit.
<p>
   Because automakers around the world continue to build factories,
there are more than enough cars to meet demand. And with economists
predicting that the U.S. economy will slow slightly from last year,
automakers expect demand to ease a bit.
<p>
   ``The competition is clearly going to heat up,'' said Thomas T.
Stallkamp, president of the Chrysler Corp.
<p>
   For the car makers, that could mean pressure to cut costs
further if they are to maintain the profit growth of the last few
years. Shoppers, however, may wind up with a rare bit of good
fortune: Some vehicles carry lower sticker prices than last year's
models, and most come with offers of generous rebates or discounted
financing or lease rates.
<p>
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis, predicts sales of 15 million cars, sport utility
vehicles, pickup trucks, minivans and heavier trucks this year,
about 300,000 fewer than last year.
<p>
   Economists for the Big Three automakers are somewhat more
optimistic, because they do not expect the economy to deviate from
its path of modest but steady growth. These economists predict that
customers will buy 15 million to 15.5 million cars and trucks in
the United States this year, as they have for the last four years.
Last year, shoppers were expected to have bought 15.4 million new
vehicles  &MD;  final tallies will be released by Wednesday.
<p>
   ``There is no reason why the U.S. economy can't continue to grow
at a steady pace'' of 2.5 to 3 percent this year, said G. Mustafa
Mohatarem, chief economist for General Motors Corp. ``There is no
reason why consumers can't keep spending.''
<p>
   His counterpart at Chrysler Corp., W. Van Bussmann, said that
the difference between his sales prediction last year and his
prediction for this year is that last year he expected sales closer
to 15.5 million than to 15 million.
<p>
   Ford Motor Co.'s projection is also for healthy, if not
spectacular, sales to continue. ``It certainly can go on,'' said
Martin B. Zimmerman, executive director of government relations and
corporate economics at Ford.
<p>
   Those sales will be driven in part by flat or lower prices. As
recently as mid-1995, vehicle prices were rising faster than
inflation. Since then, prices for new cars and trucks have
increased more slowly than overall inflation. In the last two
months, prices even began to decrease.
<p>
   Of course, bargains can't be found on every new car or truck on
dealers' lots. While many cars, particularly small ones, are
expected to be relative bargains this year, the outlook for truck
prices is mixed. Minivans and medium-sized sport utility vehicles
like the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee are likely to carry
rebates and other discounts, but some of the largest and newest
sport utility vehicles  &MD;  like the Lincoln Navigator and the
Mercedes ML320  &MD;  are selling at full sticker prices.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   In part, the pressure on prices is caused by the strength of the
dollar, which may help Japanese and European automakers win market
share from the Big Three this year.
<p>
   Another factor in the expectation of flat or lower prices is
simple supply and demand, which has been thrown off-kilter lately
because the world's automakers have been racing to build new
factories, particularly in Asia and South America, where
projections of further rapid growth now look highly questionable.
``There is a lot of excess capacity in the industry, and there is a
lot of capacity going in,'' Zimmerman said. ``Our task is to make
sure that the excess capacity is not ours.''
<p>
   To that end, automakers have been cutting costs at the same time
that they hold the line on prices, which has enabled them to
continue earning strong profits. And while 1998 should be a good
year for consumers, the expected decline in sales is not expected
to be as large as some of the cyclical swings of the past.
<p>
   Wall Street expects that earnings for GM and Chrysler will
increase slightly this year compared with last year. While analysts
generally expect profits at Ford to edge down slightly from healthy
levels last year, Ford's top executive has a slightly more
optimistic view.
<p>
   ``If the industry can deliver another 15.5 million new cars and
trucks, I think we can aspire to do as well in 1998 as in 1997,''
said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman, president and chief executive.

<TEXT>
<p>
   An underpinning of the economic boom of the 1990s has been the
relative steadiness of oil prices. While big oil-producing
countries have been frustrated by an inability to raise prices,
American drivers, and hence the whole economy, have benefited from
steady costs at the pump.
<p>
   But the surge in economic growth in recent years has led to
increasing demand for oil, a trend that is expected to gain
strength this year. In the face of tight supplies, that might be
expected to push up prices  &MD;  or at least to keep them firm  &MD; 
possibly setting off alarms about higher inflation.
<p>
   The wild card remains the big oil producers, particularly the
Persian Gulf nations that dominate the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which are expected to play an even greater
role than usual in determining supply and prices.
<p>
   In November, OPEC members agreed to raise their overall
production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels a day, from 25 million
barrels. The increase will not really add supply, however, because
some countries have already been cheating on their production
quotas.
<p>
   The amount of oil that will actually be available will depend
much on Middle East politics, and particularly on Saudi Arabia,
whose production quota has increased the most. Saudi Arabia will
now be allowed to pump up to 800,000 more barrels of oil a day to
help meet the 75 million to 76 million barrels a day that are
expected to be needed this year  &MD;  up about 2 million barrels a day
from 1997.
<p>
   Saudi Arabia, which has the capacity to pump even more oil than
it is allowed to, will be in a position to watch whether demand
will be as strong and whether production from other sources like
the North Sea will be greater than expected. If the last few years
are a guide, the Saudis will seek to add production only if demand
can absorb it  &MD;  seeking to keep up prices.
<p>
   Other factors, too, point to the possibility of higher prices.
These include the industry's inability to make substantial
additions to its reserves and growing shortages of increasingly
costly drilling equipment.
<p>
   Meantime, demand for gasoline has increased  &MD;  particularly in
the United States, where gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles are
highly popular  &MD;  and has generally been underestimated by experts.
<p>
   All bets about the course of oil prices are off, however, if
another big producer  &MD;  Iraq  &MD;  is allowed to return fully to the
world market by the United Nations. And despite the relative
steadiness of prices recently, day-to-day volatility has not been
eliminated entirely. On the Monday after OPEC decided to increase
its production quotas, for instance, the active crude oil futures
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell sharply. The
price, above $25 a barrel in early 1997, ended the year at $17.64.
<p>
   Constantinos Fliakos, an oil analyst for Merrill Lynch, while
saying that he expected oil prices to be held down by
quota-cheating OPEC members and the possibility of lower demand in
Asia, acknowledged that predicting oil prices was often simply a
game of hunches like these. ``Poker is easier,'' he said.

 &UR; TRAVELERS SHOULD EXPECT COSTS TO RISE AGAIN &LR;  &QL; 
(gh) &QL;

<p>
   Because of the strength of the U.S. economy, travelers have been
filling airplanes and hotel rooms to levels not seen in years. With
no immediate end to the boom in sight, experts generally expect
travel costs to rise by as much as 7 percent in 1998, several
percentage points more than the current general inflation rate.
<p>
   American Express forecasts that overall business travel prices
in 1998 will rise 6 to 7 percent in the United States. That would
match what American Express predicted for 1997, an increase it now
projects at 12 percent, largely because of a rise in air fares. It
says American companies spent an estimated $156 billion on travel
last year  &MD;  42 percent of it on air fares, 21 percent on lodging,
14 percent on meals, 8 percent each on car rentals and
entertainment, 5 percent on communication and 2 percent on taxis,
tips, tolls and other expenses.
<p>
   Other forecasters  &MD;  Runzheimer International, Rosenbluth
International and Travel One  &MD;  generally agree with American
Express on the overall increase in costs. Still, the companies
differ on the areas in which they think the increases will come and
on the reasons.
<p>
   American Express and Runzheimer, the management consulting firm
based in Rochester, Wis., generally agree that air fares  &MD;  which in
1997 cost the typical business traveler an estimated $850 for a
full-fare economy class roundtrip ticket  &MD;  will rise about 5
percent in 1998.
<p>
   But while Runzheimer says that increased fuel costs could force
fares up and predicts that some discounts for seven-day and 14-day
advance purchase will disappear, American Express cites wage
demands by airline unions as putting upward pressure on air fares.
<p>
   Rosenbluth International, the travel management giant in
Philadelphia, says that air fare increases could vary considerably
around the country. Even though they could be held to as little as
2 percent in most of the United States, it says, they could reach 9
percent for flights into or out of some key markets, including New
York.
<p>
   Travel One, another big management company, forecasts 1998 fare
increases of 6 percent on domestic flights and 7.5 percent on
international fares. It says the increases are enough that
corporations will investigate such air travel alternatives as
charter flights and full or partial ownership of corporate
aircraft.
<p>
   Travel One, which is based in Mount Laurel, N.J., also expects
hotel rates to soar 10 percent in 1998 because of continuing high
demand. Consequently, it says, companies will consider making
corporate housing available in cities frequently visited by their
employees, or they may buy blocks of hotel rooms at discounted
rates.
<p>
   American Express sees sharp increases in corporate hotel rates,
which it estimates averaged $127 a night in 1997. It expects
increases of 13 to 15 percent, largely because it predicts that the
occupancy rate will dip slightly from 1997 and that more rooms will
be added. Runzheimer forecasts a 6 percent increase in room rates.
<p>
   Increases in car rental costs are expected to range from 4 to 8
percent in 1998. Runzheimer said that car rental companies, having
trimmed costs by not buying and maintaining fleets big enough to
accommodate 100 percent of demand at peak periods, can now raise
prices enough to produce modest profits. Rosenbluth, said that
higher car rental rates will result largely from higher taxes and
insurance costs, as well as from less competition because of the
consolidation of the industry.
<p>
   The big bargain in 1998 travel, if the forecasters prove
correct, will be meals and entertainment, whose prices they expect
to rise by only 2 to 3 percent.
<p>
   All of the predictions assume, of course, that the economy keeps
rolling and that Americans' wanderlust continues. As Rolfe
Shellenberger, Runzheimer's senior travel consultant, noted,
``Travel demand expectations could be thrown off by such events as
war and terrorism, economic catastrophe such as stock market
crashes, or political retrogression to planned economies''
overseas.

<p>
   The 1997 movie ``The Ice Storm'' gave Americans a bleak view
backward to the early '70s and, as a vivid aside, reminded them how
far many consumer products have come since then.
<p>
   Feuding patterns in shirts and ties were the least of it. Irons
back then were known to lose control of their heating mechanisms,
leading to melted messes in at least one safety test. People mowing
the lawn had to deal with the worry that the mower blades would
keep whirring even if they let go of the machine, cutting up
whatever azalea, pet or small child got in the way. Childproof
containers for over-the-counter drugs were a thing of the future.
<p>
   Stereo equipment ranged all over the map in terms of sound
quality. Automatic-changer compact-disk players didn't exist; there
was, however, that short-lived medium called the eight-track tape.
Disposable diapers were expensive and soon to be labeled socially
irresponsible. Cars had so many flaws that consumers actually
expected problems.
<p>
   But then came consumer advocates and the government, calling for
better standards that, in many cases, have arrived. In addition, as
shoppers flocked to products made abroad, U.S. captains of industry
were forced to pay attention and compete. Terms like ``planned
obsolescence'' became politically incorrect. Now, if you are going
to make a household appliance (hold the harvest-gold color scheme),
the quality has to be better.
<p>
   Take the refrigerator. ``Refrigerators have gotten a little
smaller on the outside but still give you the same dimensions
inside,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director for Consumers
Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, in Yonkers, N.Y. ``Their
compressors are quieter and cost less to run, thanks in large part
to the government's requirements on energy-efficiency labeling.''
<p>
   Color television is also on a higher plane, even before the
arrival of digital TV, thanks mostly to competition among
manufacturers, many of them from overseas. And hair dryers, once
known to cause many electric-shock deaths, have become far safer.
Those made in the last few years must have mechanisms that shut the
dryers off if they fall into, say, a bathtub. ``Now, when they are
dropped in water, they shut off and nobody is killed,'' Pittle
said. And lawn mowers are required to have devices that
automatically shut them off if the operator lets go.
<p>
   Of course, concerns remain about other products, on quality or
safety issues. ``In summer 1995, we tested a group of child-safety
seats and three out of 25 were unacceptably dangerous because they
came apart on impact,'' Pittle said. Two of the three companies
recalled their child seats; the third did not, because the
government did not force it to, he added. ``Part of their argument
was that they didn't have any complaints,'' he said.
<p>
   Overall car quality has gone up sharply over the last decade,
mainly in response to competition from Japanese imports. ``There
were days when, after you bought a new car, you'd keep a pad of
paper on the front seat to jot down every problem you had,'' said
Robert Schnorbus, director of automotive analysis for J.D. Power &AMP;
Associates. ``You almost expected to have to take the vehicle
back.'' Now, he estimates, there are half the complaints there were
10 years ago.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The same trend is apparent in cars more than 5 years old,
Schnorbus said, heightening the demand for used cars. People are
still replacing their old cars, but not always with new models
fresh from the factory. ``This is part of the reason we have seen
new-vehicle sales flatten out,'' he said. ``Because fewer new cars
are needed to replace scrapped vehicles, used vehicles are getting
a greater share of total sales.''
<p>
   Not that all is rosy on the automotive front. Safety experts are
particularly troubled by the popularity of sport utility vehicles,
which, because they are heavier and have higher bumpers, can do a
lot of damage when they collide with standard cars. Pittle is also
concerned about the higher center of gravity on such vehicles,
which makes it easier for them to roll.
<p>
   ``The SUVs have replaced the station wagon as the family car,''
he said, ``and they should perform as safely as any other product
used as a family car.''
<p>
   Most evolutions in car design  &MD;  like air bags, anti-lock brakes
and daytime running lights  &MD;  are intended to keep people safer.
While air bags have come under attack for causing deaths of small
children in the front passenger seat, the lives they save far
outnumber those deaths. But innovations in brakes and lights have
yet to become standard equipment on all vehicles.
<p>
   Some things, of course, are every bit as vulnerable as they ever
were. Paper bags still break. Eggshells crack. Light bulbs have to
be replaced. And, as was true in the era ``The Ice Storm''
depicted, marital bliss still doesn't come in a can.

   HOMESPUN SUITOR WINS FIGHT FOR MCI
<p>
   It seemed like the perfect marriage for a decade of
globalization: MCI and British Telecommunications, which already
had an international alliance, would form a trans-Atlantic
colossus. But after it appeared that MCI's dowry might not be as
large as anticipated  &MD;  MCI disclosed unexpectedly high costs in its
effort to move into the local telephone business  &MD;  the British
company and its shareholders turned cool. That opened the door to
two United States rivals: GTE and a young suitor, Worldcom, with a
more humble background but ambitious plans. In the end, Worldcom
swept MCI and Wall Street off their feet with a $36.5 billion
winning bid.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T'S MISSED CONNECTIONS
<p>
   Not to be outdone, AT&AMP;T entertained merger thoughts of its own,
talking with one of its offspring, SBC Communications. But the
negotiations fell apart, in part because federal regulators
indicated that they would frown on such a linkup. The failed talks
were one factor in the ouster of AT&AMP;T's president, John Walter, who
had been brought in only nine months earlier as the heir apparent
to the chairman, Robert Allen, but failed to perform up to
expectations. Making matters worse, Allen and Walter did not get
along. When, after Walter left, AT&AMP;T offered the top job to C.
Michael Armstrong of Hughes Electronics, he insisted that there be
no chance of such a conflict; Allen, who had been criticized for
the rough transition of leadership, had to agree to leave first.
<p>
   STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
<p>
   The long-running soap opera ``As Apple Computer Turns'' kicked
out the stops, with plot twists including the dumping of one chief
executive, the return of another, even a deal with the Devil.
First, Gilbert F. Amelio, who replaced Michael Spindler in 1995,
was forced out after 17 months as chairman, as Apple's market share
continued to dwindle. Amelio's departure hastened the return to
power of Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, who had come back as a
consultant months before and who proclaimed his reluctance to run
the company again even as he took steps to purge the board and
spoke of Apple as his ``first love.'' But some of the Apple
faithful felt jilted after Jobs persuaded Bill Gates, their Great
Satan, to have Microsoft invest $150 million in Apple  &MD;  chump
change, perhaps, for America's richest man, but potentially Apple's
last hope against the grim slide into irrelevance.
<p>
   TAKING AIM AT MICROSOFT
<p>
   Microsoft may have made peace with Apple, but it still faced
attack from many sides. The Justice Department accused it of
violating a 1995 consent decree on marketing practices in bundling
its browser program, Internet Explorer, with its Windows 95
operating system. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction
and ordered Microsoft to offer Windows without Explorer while the
suit progressed. Meanwhile, rivals assembled behind Sun
Microsystems as it tried to lift Microsoft's iron grip on software.
Sun filed suit, contending that even as it was trying to make its
``write once, run everywhere'' Internet programming language, Java,
an industry standard, Microsoft, a licensee, was trying to
undermine its effort by shipping a version of it that would work
only with Microsoft products.

   MAN VS. MACHINE, 1997
<p>
   Forget the Millennium Virus. To some, the defeat of Garry
Kasparov, the world chess champion, at the hands (chips?) of Deep
Blue  &MD;  more formally, IBM's RS/6000 SP computer  &MD;  was the truly
apocalyptic vision of a future run by machines. Kasparov had beaten
a ``younger'' version of Deep Blue only a year earlier, and seemed
in control against the twice-as-swift new model, winning the first
game of the match. Then a loss and three draws followed, and in the
sixth and final game, Kasparov crumbled after just 19 moves. His
defeat sent shivers through much of the Luddite world, which saw it
as the intellectual equivalent of John Henry's valiant but hopeless
struggle against a steam drill.

 &UR; BANKS UNDER SEIGE IN 1997 &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Bankers used to inhabit a staid, predictable world, one marked
by a golf-course-like serenity that was occasionally interrupted by
their proclivity for making extraordinarily bad loans. While bad
lending habits persist, banking is no longer a chummy stroll around
the links.
<p>
   Banks are now under siege from a host of new competitors as the
borders that once separated traditional banking from more exotic
financial services continue to dissolve. The banking world was
roiled in 1997 by huge domestic mergers and economic turmoil
abroad, and the landscape promises to be equally challenging in
1998, with more mergers, rising credit problems and slowing revenue
growth.
<p>
   All of this should make it harder to ring up the fat profits
that made many banks stock market darlings over the last few years.
<p>
   ``In 1998, there will be many more banks that fall short of
their earnings targets than in 1997,'' said Thomas Brown, an
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
<p>
   To be sure, many banks, particularly Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan, have rebounded smartly from the type of lending problems
of a decade ago that are now bedeviling foreign-owned banks in such
regions as Southeast Asia. Many other banks have responded to
competitive pressures by becoming more efficient operators and
savvier marketers, lessons that large foreign banks are trying to
emulate. These changes will continue to benefit all banks in 1998
and beyond  &MD;  it's just that the game is growing more complicated.
<p>
   Though banks are not threatened with insolvency by huge losses
from bad real estate and emerging market loans like those of the
1980s, they have still been buffeted by sloppy trading practices
abroad and indiscriminate credit card lending at home.
<p>
   On the merger front, more big bank takeovers are expected, but
perhaps at more reasonable prices. In 1997, First Union agreed to
acquire Corestates Financial for $17.1 billion and Nationsbank
agreed to acquire Barnett Banks for $15.5 billion. The deals were
the two richest mergers in banking history, carrying eye-popping
valuations. While the lofty prices may come back to haunt the
acquirers, they are also the reason many banks are willing to sell.
<p>
   ``We're in the midst of putting together national franchises,''
said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, ``and a
lot of banks are looking at the prices being paid and are saying,
`If not now, when?'''
<p>
   Bank advisers say that 1998 may witness big acquisitions by such
giants as Chase Manhattan and BankAmerica, but that many smaller
banks waiting to be picked off will be ignored because they do not
offer attractive franchises and require too much expensive
retooling.
<p>
   Foremost among the issues that need to be tackled at smaller
banks is the technological problem that threatens to cripple
computer systems when the new millennium arrives. Analysts say many
small, regional banks have yet to overhaul their computer systems
to make sure that customers' accounts are not thrown into confusion
when 2000 dawns. These banks are assuming it is not worth their
while to spend millions of dollars fixing outdated technology if
buyers will come along and foot the bill  &MD;  an approach that could
prove foolhardy if no suitors come calling.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   As the Year 2000 problem ticks loudly in the ears of small
banks, larger banks with overseas operations have been buffeted by
the rapid and brutal downturn in Southeast Asia and financial
troubles in such large Latin American countries as Brazil.
<p>
   Regulators and bankers are still working to stem the fallout,
but banks of all sizes are sure to feel more pain as the wrenching
events from overseas contribute to what many analysts expect to be
a slowdown in the U.S. economy in 1998. A softer economy translates
into weaker loan demand and a greater likelihood that consumers and
corporate borrowers will have more difficulty paying off their
debts.
<p>
   ``I think there are risks from credit exposures abroad and a
slowdown in corporate profits domestically,'' said Judah Kraushaar,
an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Then the question becomes,
how careful have the banks been in structuring corporate loans?''
<p>
   Ascertaining exactly where big banks stand internationally is a
tricky matter. The country's largest banks  &MD;  including Chase
Manhattan, Citicorp, BankAmerica, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust  &MD; 
have large operations abroad but tend to disclose very little about
the nature of their exposure to volatile emerging markets.
<p>
   Also on the radar screen for every banker in 1998 is Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who controls the Fed's
interest-rate switch. Though interest rate increases might still
have been in order as recently as last summer, few analysts think
the Fed chairman is planning to raise rates to cool off the economy
in 1998. Southeast Asia's travails have taken care of that for
him.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Bundesbank Chief Economist Otmar
Issing said holding official interest rates high under the European
Union's single currency could create rifts at the EU's future
European Central Bank.
<p>
   ``Some people are advising the ECB to pursue a particularly
restrictive course right from the start so as to nip any mistrust
in the bud,'' said Issing in a speech on the bank at the annual
meeting of the American Economic Association. ``Such an
uncompromising approach would inevitably give rise to tensions
within the council.''
<p>
   Sky-high rates would also be unlikely to meet the approval of
``the people of Europe, given the high level of unemployment,'' he
said.
<p>
   The ECB will set interest rates under economic and monetary
union for all countries using the euro currency from its Jan. 1,
1999 start. Issing said the bank's success hinges on the strategy
it uses for setting interest rates and the choice of key staff.
<p>
   ``Public controversies about the filling of top posts damage
credibility'' in new institutions like the bank, he said.
<p>
   Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet is vying for the top
job with European Monetary Institute President Wim Duisenberg.
Trichet's candidacy, announced by the French government in
November, came as a surprise. Most observers expected European
leaders to back a single candidate.
<p>
   Issing said that central bank personnel must withstand political
pressure from national governments if EMU is to be credible.
Inflation Fighting
<p>
   He added that a decision on the inflation-fighting strategy of
the future bank is also crucial for the credibility of Europe's
common currency.
<p>
   ``It is imperative it takes a pre-commitment to which its policy
is bound and which makes it accountable,'' he said.
<p>
   Its predecessor, the European Monetary Institute, has already
said it will use either direct inflation targeting or money supply
targeting to assess inflationary pressure. The Bundesbank watches
growth of M3 money supply when setting rates.
<p>
   Money demand in the euro area should be stable enough for
German-style money targeting, Issing said. He added, though, that
it's ``advisable to supplement the strategy of monetary targeting
pragmatically'' at the start of EMU ``including some elements of
direct inflation targeting.''
<p>
   An ``appropriate strategy'' and the right choice of top
executives will temper uncertainty at the start of the euro and
prevent government bond yields from surging, he said.
<p>
   In comments after the speech, Issing said, ``all were surprised
by the dimension'' of the ongoing Asia economic crisis. Even so, he
said, the crisis will have ``no immediate consequences'' on the
introduction of the euro.
<p>
   If anything, he suggested, an increase in global competition as
an outgrowth of Asian countries trying to right their economies
could provide a benefit. That competition could help offset
inflationary pressures that might otherwise crop up under the
single currency, Issing suggested.

<p>
   For several years, technological doomsayers have bleated a dark
prophecy of computerized chaos to be brought on by the inability of
many computers to interpret dates after 1999. Repair your programs
now, they intoned, or be prepared for your systems to freeze in
millennial ice.
<p>
   Though it has been hard to know how seriously to take these
predictions, with less than two years to go, clues are emerging.
Much of the evidence supports the view that the year 2000 problem
is, indeed, a big deal, and computer users are slowly coming to
this realization. By all accounts, the activity devoted to the
problem will substantially pick up this year.
<p>
   A recent survey of 108 technology managers and big companies by
Cap Gemini, the huge French consulting firm, found that four out of
five had initially underestimated the cost of fixing the problem.
And 7 percent have already had computer failures related to the
problem.
<p>
   ``A lot of companies, when they found out how big the problem
was, just went into a catatonic state,'' said Jim Woodward, the
head of Cap Gemini's year 2000 practice.
<p>
   Cap Gemini and many other companies that had hoped to profit
from selling year 2000 repair services have found business to be
slower than they had predicted. ``1997 was a missed opportunity for
many companies to have their work done at a lower cost,'' Woodward
said.
<p>
   Such warnings have been issued before. Another attending plague
that was warned of  &MD;  a scarcity of programmers skilled in adjusting
software to fix the problem  &MD;  has yet to materialize.
<p>
   ``You can read this two ways,'' said Edward Yardeni, the chief
economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, who has warned of a global
economic slowdown from compounded computer errors. ``Either there
hasn't been enough recognition of the problem, or it's not really
such a big deal. I pick door No. 1.''
<p>
   That is not to say that even some big companies aren't worried.
BankAmerica, the huge San Francisco bank, has established two bonus
pools: $30 million to be shared by those among its 600 computer
experts who stay with the company and see the millennium through,
and $50 million that is open to all other employees who help spot
impending bugs.
<p>
   The typical multinational company has estimated the total cost
of dealing with the problem at several hundred million dollars.
<p>
   While many companies devoted last year to planning how to deal
with the problem, they generally expect to do most of the actual
reprogramming this year, leaving themselves 1999 to test their
systems.
<p>
   Meanwhile, there is nothing like the dawning of an absolute and
unalterable deadline to focus the attention of procrastinators,
including smaller businesses, those in developing countries and
many government agencies everywhere.
<p>
   ``In 1998, the panic level will go up, and that's good,''
Yardeni said. Signs of it are appearing in many parts of the world.
<p>
    &MD;  In Washington, a recent assessment by the Office of Management
and Budget found that only eight of 24 Cabinet agencies had the
year 2000 problem under control. Seven other agencies have made
insufficient progress, the report said.
<p>
    &MD;  Several airlines, including American and KLM, are monitoring
whether air traffic control systems have been properly upgraded,
and have said that in 2000 they may not fly to certain destinations
until it becomes clear that safety can be maintained.
<p>
    &MD;  A study by the British government found that hospitals had
made so little progress in reprogramming their systems that in
January 2000 they could be forced to close to all but emergency
cases, risking as many as 1,500 unnecessary deaths.
<p>
    &MD;  American Express has a team of 40 people traveling the world
with test cards that expire in 2000. The cards are choking so many
merchants' credit validation systems, including those of some
airlines, that American Express has yet to issue customers cards
that expire after 1999.
<p>
   If programmers have been a little less busy than expected, one
group has already found profitable work, well before the dawn of
the millennium: lawyers.
<p>
   Some have negotiated contracts between computer companies and
corporate customers that detail who will be responsible for
mistakes caused by the year 2000 problem. Other lawyers who have
made money in securities class-action lawsuits have leapt on the
year 2000 issue as a potential gold mine. One group of customers
filed suit last month accusing a software company of trying to fix
the year 2000 problem by requiring users to buy a costly program
upgrade.
<p>
   ``I didn't expect the extent to which lwyers who previously did
not specialize in information technology have looked on the year
2000 as an opportunity,'' said Barry Weiss, a partner at Gordon &AMP;
Glickson, a technology law firm in Chicago.
<p>
   That, cynics might say, is the best indicator yet of the size of
the problem that looms.

<p>
   There was a time when following the telecommunications industry
meant following the actual business of telecommunications. Those
days, like rotary telephones, are long gone. In 1997, takeovers
became almost as important to this industry as dial tones.
<p>
   Clearly beating out the year's No. 2 telecommunications story  &MD; 
the failure of any regional Bell company to offer long-distance
service  &MD;  mergers, proposed and actual, became the biggest story in
one of the nation's most dynamic industries (notwithstanding a
federal judge's bombshell ruling six hours before the year's end
that invalidated broad swaths of the Telecommunications Act of
1996).
<p>
   And 1998 promises more of the same, at least on the merger
front.
<p>
   The deals this year might not be as wild as Worldcom's breaking
up the merger agreement between British Telecommunications and MCI
Communications and then sweeping MCI away with a $36.5 billion
offer  &MD;  all while warding off a third suitor, GTE. And the failures
might not claim victims as visible as John R. Walter, the erstwhile
printing executive who lost his chance to run AT&AMP;T after making the
wrong moves during AT&AMP;T's botched merger talks with SBC
Communications.
<p>
   But of the three forces pushing combinations  &MD;  deregulation, the
desire to offer more services and surging financial markets  &MD;  the
first two are sure to hold up, setting the stage for a 1998 that
could make the deals of 1997 seem positively normal.
<p>
   ``There will be an unprecedented number of large telecom deals
in 1998,'' said Robert A. Kindler, a partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP;
Moore, which advised Worldcom in its bid for MCI. ``By the end of
next year, we likely will see significant transactions by AT&AMP;T,
GTE, BT and several of the regional Bell operating companies.''
<p>
   As prosaic as it may seem, the biggest dampers on the pace of
acquisitions could be a weaker economy and, far more important,
weaker financial markets.
<p>
   The remarkably robust markets of 1997 put currency in the form
of more valuable stock into the hands of acquisitive executives. As
a company's shares become more valuable, it becomes easier to issue
new shares to acquire a rival.
<p>
   Of course, a bull market also lifts the prices of targets. But
in a strong market, the shares of companies with successful
acquisition records are sometimes valued far higher than those of
potential targets.
<p>
   ``The market's a huge factor,'' said Eric Strumingher, an
analyst for Paine Webber. ``Worldcom would never have been able to
pull off a deal like MCI if it weren't for the bull markets we've
had.''
<p>
   The shares of Worldcom, which was built on dozens of stock-based
acquisitions, trade at more than 75 times estimated 1998 earnings,
compared with multiples of about 20 for most big telecommunications
carriers  &MD;  MCI's was about 25 before the Worldcom bid. So if the
stock market had taken a beating last year, Worldcom shares would
most likely have fallen far more than MCI's, simply because they
had further to fall. That might have made Bernard J. Ebbers,
Worldcom's chairman, less likely to pursue such a large stock-based
acquisition, because he would have had to issue more shares.
<p>
   Companies often choose to use stock rather than cash when it
allows them to use accounting rules to avoid big expenses. The
mergers last year between SBC and the Pacific Telesis Group and
between Bell Atlantic and Nynex, involving a total of more than $40
billion, cost less because they were all-stock deals. But Worldcom,
despite using stock, will not be able to avoid large
merger-associated expenses, in part because it also had to pay
about $7 billion in cash to British Telecommunications.
<p>
   Debt markets also play a role. Many of the investors who bought
billions of dollars in zero coupon bonds from fledgling wireless
communications carriers in 1995 and 1996 are still around and
willing to lend. GTE planned to finance its bid for MCI with $28
billion in borrowed cash. GTE is hardly a start-up, but Wall
Street's confidence that GTE could easily raise the money is a sign
of how loose credit is.
<p>
   So if the party continues on Wall Street, telecommunications
companies will have the financial backing to make deals. Then, the
factors that actually have to do with the workings of the industry
can take over.
<p>
   Foremost among them is fear  &MD;  fear that companies that do not
offer nearly every service imaginable will not thrive, and fear of
passing up the chance to gain a financial edge by combining with a
rival and cutting costs.
<p>
   The first fear gets more attention.
<p>
   ``You compare the U.S. market to anywhere else in the world and
it is a very highly fragmented market, where the industry structure
does not reflect how customers would like to buy services,'' said
Frank Governali, head telecommunications analyst for Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``In other places, people can buy the service they
want from single entities. But here you can't do that.''
<p>
   While corporate executives would most like to pull off vertical
acquisitions, those involving companies in complementary but not
identical businesses, federal regulators so far have allowed only
the biggest horizontal mergers.
<p>
   Thus, companies that offer similar service  &MD;  like Bell Atlantic
and Nynex, or Worldcom and MCI  &MD;  have been allowed to merge, while
proposed deals between local and long-distance operators have
received sharp denunciations from regulators.
<p>
   There is a huge pent-up desire among both the Bells and the
long-distance carriers to link with one another. But the Federal
Communications Commission and the antitrust division of the Justice
Department have made it clear they will not allow that until the
Bell companies sufficiently open their local markets to
competitors.
<p>
   So for now, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which
deregulated much of the industry, continues to foster horizontal
deals, and vertical deals on the margins.
<p>
   Last Wednesday, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the
regulatory hoops that the Bells must jump through before they may
offer long-distance service are unconstitutional. If the ruling
withstands the government's appeals, the decision would completely
change the telecommunications landscape by allowing the Bells to
offer long-distance service almost immediately.
<p>
   That could add even more fuel to the deal-making fire because
the long-distance carriers, especially AT&AMP;T, would come under
intense pressure as the Bells attacked the very core of their
business  &MD;  residential long-distance customers. Rather than see
their shares of the market slashed, companies like AT&AMP;T could
decide to merge with their potential competitors.
<p>
   But alternative local carriers, which generally compete against
the Bells only for business customers, are perhaps the hottest
commodity; since the passage of the act, Worldcom, the No. 4
long-distance carrier, has acquired two of the biggest, MFS
Communications and Brooks Fiber Properties.
<p>
   The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that the best way for
AT&AMP;T, the largest long-distance carrier, to get a start in local
markets would be to buy one of the few remaining big competitive
local carriers, most likely Teleport Communications.
<p>
   But as the Bells move into the long-distance market  &MD;  even if
last week's ruling is overturned, they will probably convince the
FCC at some point that their local networks are open to competitors
 &MD;  look for at least one to seek a blockbuster merger with a large
long-distance carrier. If such a deal materializes, MCI-Worldcom
may not look so wild after all.

<p>
   Surveys of newspaper readers often show that they think papers
are run by sourpusses who live only to print bad news. Those
readers might be surprised to see how downright cheerful and sunny
most editors and publishers have been lately about their industry's
money-making performance.
<p>
   For the first three quarters of 1997, certainly, the industry's
performance was the strongest it has been in this decade. The cost
of newsprint remained moderate and predictable, advertising sales
figures seemed drawn from the days before competition from
television, and even a long downward trend in circulation at some
of the biggest papers showed signs of turning around, if only a
little.
<p>
   Industry analysts estimate that newspaper earnings per share
will finish the year about 19 percent ahead of last year's
earnings. And the total amount of advertising space sold increased
in the first three quarters by 5.3 percent over the corresponding
period last year, despite the industry's aggressive increases in ad
rates.
<p>
   Finally, advertising spending in newspapers rose 8.9 percent
over the first nine months of 1997 compared with the year before,
the Newspaper Association of America announced. The study suggested
that newspapers might have actually regained some of the
advertising share they lost to television in recent years.
<p>
   ``The economics of the newspaper business are as good as they
have been in a long time,'' said David M. Cole, publisher of two
industry newsletters.
<p>
   Newspaper executives who took part in a Paine Webber media
conference in mid-December spoke of a 1998 that could be as good as
1997, if the economy remains strong and inflation stays down.
<p>
   The executives said they expected newsprint prices, which can
account for a quarter of the costs at a big paper, to increase by
10 to 15 percent, circulation to remain flat or go up slightly, and
the amount of advertising space sold to increase by as much as 4
percent.
<p>
   But this outlook is clouded by uncertainty about the direction
of the economy and by fourth-quarter results for the industry. One
omen was that the rate of increase in earnings slowed during each
quarter of last year, compared with a year earlier.
<p>
   To John Morton of Morton Research Inc., who made the
year-to-year comparisons, the challenge to keep profits increasing
solidly could be hard to meet.
<p>
   ``It's fairly likely that newsprint costs are going to go up on
the order of 10 to 12 percent,'' Morton said. Moreover, the
industry will have a tough job trying to match the 1997 growth in
advertising, he said. ``So, if volume is flat and newsprint costs
are up, it could put a squeeze on earnings.''
<p>
   Helped by the companies' strong financial performance, many
newspaper stocks performed well last year. The economic instability
in Asia may have also helped these stocks, at least in the short
run, as investors moved their money to stocks of companies, like
those in the newspaper industry, whose fortunes are largely tied to
local, rather than global, events.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Although some newspapers saw declines in circulations slow or
turn around slightly last year, it is unclear whether a
decades-long erosion has been stopped. But given the strong
financial performance recently of many newspaper companies, the
long-term significance of the loss of readers is a matter of
debate.
<p>
   ``The revenue picture is masking some serious problems,'' Cole
said, ``and until publishers come to grips with the notion that
they have to measure their business in ways that also take
readership and circulation into account, they are cruisin' for a
bruisin,' as my mother used to say.''
<p>
   But Malcolm A. Borg, chief executive of Macromedia Inc., a
cluster of New Jersey dailies, including The Record in Bergen
County, whose sales slipped slightly in the most recent reporting
period, maintained that circulation figures should be judged paper
by paper, not industry-wide.
<p>
   ``Sure, the readership is off, but so is television
viewership,'' said Borg, who also owns three CBS-affiliated
television stations. ``It's the same thing. Maybe a lot of
newspapers have lost some of the sense of relevancy to their
readers, but I think many others are doing a damned good job.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   Jerusalem, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy resigned Sunday amid a dispute with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over the nation's 1998 budget.
<p>
   Levy, 60, accused the government at a press conference of
failing to care for the poor and the unemployed through social
spending and of failing to make progress on Israeli-Arab peace.
<p>
   ``I've had it,'' said Levy, known as a political moderate in the
Israeli cabinet, as he also ruled out any alliance at the next
election between his Gesher party, with its five members of
parliament, and Netanyahu's Likud party.
<p>
   Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he was sorry Levy had quit,
and hoped he would retract the decision. Netanyahu said he would
present the 1998 budget to the Knesset for approval Monday and that
his ruling coalition would continue to govern without Levy.
<p>
   ``I believe our coalition partners don't want the government to
collapse and a leftist government to take over, which would return
the country to Israel's 1967 borders,'' Netanyahu said at a press
conference in Jerusalem. The prime minister added that he would
assume the Foreign Ministry portfolio for the time being.
<p>
   While Levy's resignation leaves Netanyahu with a majority in
parliament, analysts said the budget was unlikely to pass as other
members of the coalition were seen joining Levy to vote against it.
Furthermore, they said early elections were likely in the wake of
the resignation.
<p>
   The resignation technically takes effect in 48 hours.
<p>
   ``It's virtually certain the budget won't pass,'' said Ze'ev
Chafets, a political commentator and author of several books on
Israel. Levy's resignation is ``a bad blow for the coalition,'' he
said, and elections could be in ``a matter of weeks.''
<p>
   Israeli stocks are poised to fall tomorrow morning.
<p>
   ``The Likud's in trouble and there's a great deal of
uncertainty,'' said Izhak Amieal, a trader with Etgar Ltd., a Tel
Aviv investment firm. ``I believe there will be early elections.''
<p>
   Israeli stocks fell as investors waited for Levy's press
conference, which began after trading closed for the day. The Maof
Index of 25 issues dropped 0.99 percent to 302.89. Amieal said
stocks dropped amid speculation Levy would quit.
<p>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, another minister regarded as
a moderate in the right-wing government, also later called on Levy
to retract his decision.
<p>
   Levy had said that while he received a letter promising an
additional 350 million shekels ($100 million) to meet his demands,
``we're not talking about sums. We're talking about something very
deep, in the structure of the society.''
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had presented a list of proposed substitute
budget cuts to the prime minister to attempt to satisfy Levy, said
Eli Yosef, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry. Budget Deadline
<p>
   Yosef reiterated that his ministry is opposed to both raising
taxes and increasing spending.
<p>
   The parliament was supposed to have approved the 1998 budget by
Jan. 1. Instead, the government postponed until Monday a vote on
legislation that the lawmakers must pass before they can vote on
the budget, which would have allowed officials time to negotiate
with Levy.
<p>
   The daily Ha'aretz on Friday reported that Levy's demands were
for programs totaling 1 billion shekels ($282.8 million). The paper
said that any additional allocation to Levy without offsetting cuts
would push the government past its target budget of 207.4 billion
shekels.
<p>
   Levy, a former construction worker with a high school education,
said Thursday the government isn't paying enough attention to the
poor. Israeli cities beyond main population centers, plagued by
unemployment, weren't ``in the eyes of those who squandered
hundreds of millions'' of shekels, he said.
<p>
   If the budget doesn't pass in the days ahead, the government is
granted an extension until March 31 on the basis of 1997 spending,
stalling plans to spur new growth. If the budget still hasn't
passed by the end of March, the government collapses, the Knesset
is dissolved, and new elections are held.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry had crafted a budget that aimed to reduce
the deficit target to 2.4 percent of total economic output next
year from 2.8 percent in 1997.
<p>
   The trimmer budget comes as Israel's growth has slowed to its
lowest rate since 1989, as unemployment has hit its highest rate
since 1993, and after a general strike last month paralyzed
business, shuttering the stock exchange and banks.

<p>
   FRANKFURT, Germany  &MD;  Absent a huge political or economic
calamity, the European single currency, the euro, will make its
debut on Jan. 1, 1999. Banks have begun overhauling their computer
systems, and many big companies are already making plans for the
switch. But the magnitude of the transformation is only beginning
to sink in.
<p>
   To be sure, European leaders still face a few big decisions in
1998, and consumers will not start to use euro bills and coins,
which have already been designed, until 2002. But as of 1999, at
least 10 and probably 11 countries are expected officially to
surrender their own monetary policies and hand power to a new
European Central Bank here in Frankfurt.
<p>
   From Day One, transactions between banks will be processed in a
new double-entry format, for both euros and a national currency.
Corporations like Daimler-Benz and Siemens say they will carry out
all their paper transactions in euros before the end of 1999.
<p>
   In any case, they will have to make the switch by July 1, 2002,
the deadline by which national currencies are to be abolished.
Between now and then, almost anything that has to do with money is
likely to be affected:
<p>
    &MD;  Manufacturers of everything from cars to clothing will have to
smooth out what are often substantial differences in the prices
they charge in different countries. Germans now pay more for a
Mercedes in their homeland than they would in Italy, an opportunity
that has already stimulated a lively arbitrage business among
``gray market'' auto dealers that buy German cars in Italy and
resell them in Germany at lower prices.
<p>
    &MD;  Governments must reckon with tax differences. Germany's sales
tax will be 16 percent next year, but consumers next door in France
pay 22 percent. And income tax rates vary even more widely. Because
the single currency makes all costs easier to compare, countries
with higher taxes are likely to lose business.
<p>
    &MD;  Banks, corporations and government agencies will have to
overhaul computer systems. Invoices, tax calculations and bank
statements will have to be changed from marks or francs to euros.
By some estimates, the conversion could cost private industry as
much as $80 billion.
<p>
   ``Everything that is related in one way or another to the
Deutsche mark will change,'' said Dieter Bock, financial director
at Puma A.G., the athletic shoe manufacturer in Herzogenaurach,
Germany. Consider the problem of a shoe that costs 149 marks. Like
companies everywhere, Puma sets prices that end with a 9 because
149 sounds lower than 150. But 149 marks would convert to something
like 75 euro, which creates a pricing problem that could be
ticklish to resolve. ``The question is, where is the new price for
this article?'' Bock asked. ``Will it tend more toward 79 or 69
euro?''
<p>
   But where medium-sized companies like Puma face difficult
questions, multinational giants like Siemens and Daimler-Benz see
opportunity. The elimination of currency fluctuations should make
planning, pricing and billing simpler for companies like these,
which send many of their exports to other European Union countries.
<p>
   Indeed, the advent of the euro has already unleashed a flurry of
mergers as companies that until now were seen as largely French,
Italian or German, for example, seek to grow into pan-European
groups. Analysts expect these combinations to continue, redrawing
the business map of the Continent.
<p>
   Frankfurt will feel some of the most direct effects of the
conversion. Though this city is the heart of Germany's huge banking
system, and will be home to the European Central Bank, the
financial sector here could end up a loser.
<p>
   The euro is hastening the ascent of London, not Frankfurt, as
the financial capital of Europe, even though Britain does not plan
to adopt the single currency immediately. As financial institutions
increasingly organize themselves into pan-European enterprises,
even big German banks like Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank are
moving key operations to London, which has a much deeper reserve of
traders, brokers and sheer technical infrastructure.
<p>
   Once the euro becomes fully established, it will wipe out a
large component of financial activity  &MD;  the exchange trading
between European currencies. Europe's huge bond market will also be
transformed. Until now, bonds sold by different countries have
always offered different interest rates, reflecting the varying
strength of currencies.
<p>
   But all that will disappear with the euro. Once the European
Central Bank takes over, there will be only a single set of
European interest rates because there will be only one currency.
Indeed, interest rates have already been converging across Europe,
partly because countries had to bring their rates in line with core
countries like Germany and partly because traders have been betting
that Italian bonds, for example, will soon simply be euro bonds.
<p>
   On down the line, almost nothing will escape the transformation.
The vast majority of parking lots in European cities will have to
adjust the automated machines they use to take money and dispense
tickets. Most telephones accept calling cards that must be
recalibrated. And then there are the untold millions of computer
keyboards now in use that do not have the E-shaped euro symbol.

<p>
   Americans have long complained about abuses by the Internal
Revenue Service. Taking aim at an easy target, in 1997 Washington
finally did something about the complaints: With the reluctant
support of President Clinton, the House passed, 426-4, a ``Taxpayer
Bill of Rights,'' setting the stage for what is likely to be an
equally lopsided vote in the Senate in 1998.
<p>
   By most accounts this ritual slaying of Big Brother is
symptomatic of a broader revolt against intrusive government that
has been gaining momentum since Jimmy Carter unleashed
``supersaver'' airline fares. And there is plenty of evidence  &MD; 
everything from revised welfare laws to the current drive to
deregulate electricity  &MD;  to buttress the idea that Americans have
lower expectations of what government can accomplish and less
tolerance of its abuses.
<p>
   Look closer, though, and the picture clouds. The impact of
apparently popular environmental regulation on daily life is
growing by leaps and bounds. Efforts to contain the cost of
Medicare guarantee that Uncle Sam will be a party to the most
private interactions of patients and doctors. And even the
cathartic attack on the tax collector could have unintended
consequences. ``Taking the IRS down a peg may lead to more exacting
record-keeping and reporting standards for taxpayers,'' argued Joel
Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's Business
School.
<p>
   The nation's always tumultuous relationship with New Deal-style
government has been on the rocks at least since the 1970s.
Washington, once seen as the champion of the weak and a catalyst
for economic and social progress, has come to be reviled as the
agent of special interests.
<p>
   Elaborate regulations governing the airline, trucking, railroad,
long-distance telephone, natural gas and oil industries were
dismantled over the last two decades, while the burden shifted to
government to show whether or why corporate mergers and aggressive
business practices restrained commerce. Big tax cuts, followed by a
decade of budget deficits, ended the era in which Washington was
inclined to define aspirations  &MD;  eliminating poverty, moving the
disabled into the mainstream, saving family farms, assuring the
survival of passenger trains  &MD;  and throw money at them.
<p>
   An ideologically driven Republican Congress beat back the
Clinton administration's effort to provide universal health
insurance, and it ended welfare as millions of single mothers knew
it. Emboldened by deepening skepticism about the welfare state,
mainstream research organizations and advisory commissions have
broached the idea of taming Social Security deficits by privatizing
the system. Even ambivalent Democrats are talking the talk, calling
for tax simplification and revisions in entitlement spending and
emphasizing the need to use market incentives to ease the burden of
regulation.
<p>
   But the opposition to big government is less tidy than it might
first appear. For starters, a tsunami of environmental regulation
is still building momentum. If Congress agrees, the United States
could be forced to double energy prices in the next decade to meet
its commitment at the recent conference in Japan on cutting
greenhouse gases.
<p>
   Even without new legislation, big changes are coming. Open-ended
mandates in the Clean Air Act require the Environmental Protection
Agency to identify hazardous pollutants and then set standards that
eliminate health effects. And despite protests from White House and
Treasury economists, the EPA has just reduced tolerances for ozone
and fine soot particles to levels that would almost certainly
require wrenching changes in transportation, energy use and the
details of daily life.
<p>
   ``People don't yet realize the new standards will affect
everything from gasoline lawn mowers to the way the neighborhood
bakeries vent their pastry ovens,'' said Lester Lave, an economist
at Carnegie Mellon University.
<p>
   Or consider medical care. Congress brushed aside White House
plans for broadening medical insurance coverage and heavily
regulating delivery of services. But what a difference a few years
can make: In equally high dudgeon, legislators last year rushed to
the defense of the mothers of newborns, whose insurers had refused
to pay for an extra day in the hospital.
<p>
   The inclination by Congress to micro-manage private health care
may be beaten back, in part by heftier campaign contributions from
the insurance lobby. But paradoxically, Washington's determination
to cut federal spending leaves little doubt that older Americans
will have to jump through new hoops to get government-financed
medical care.
<p>
   Under the accord reached last year, fully half of the federal
budget savings over the next decade will come from slowing the
inevitable growth in Medicare spending. This will require the
ratcheting down of both the costs of individual services and the
volume of services delivered  &MD;  all of which translates into a
larger say by both government and insurance company bureaucrats
into who gets what treatment.
<p>
   ``With unconstrained fee-for-service insurance, no one stands
between doctor and patient,'' said Robert Reischauer, former
director of the Congressional Budget Office. But with tightly
constrained managed care, he added, the government will surely be
sucked into the dialogue as both the gatekeeper to access and as a
defender of patients' rights.
<p>
   By the same token, Judy Gueron, president of the Manpower
Development Research Corp. in New York, suggested that extracting
Washington from its traditional welfare-state role might well mean
a greater government presence in maintaining the remnants of the
social safety net. The least intrusive public assistance program,
after all, is a monthly check or a book of food stamps in the mail.
By contrast, successful welfare reform will probably turn on the
states' willingness to push, plead and train people off the dole  &MD; 
and then provide child care and medical insurance as supplements.
<p>
   And then there is the aforementioned Taxpayer Bill of Rights,
evidence that Washington is listening to the pleas of citizens to
get government off their backs. Should the bill become law, the
burden of proof in tax disputes that reach Tax Court would shift
from the taxpayer to the IRS But in becoming obliged to prove that
taxpayers have cheated, the IRS must fall back on greater
disclosure to deter fraud. A likely result will be demands that
honest taxpayers keep better records and file more forms.
<p>
   Tax policy is a perfect example of Americans' deep ambivalence
about the proper role of government. Shortly before the House voted
on the IRS bill, Congress passed legislation that includes tax
credits for college tuition. And Slemrod notes that with the new
benefits will come  &MD;  you guessed it  &MD;  bigger government in the form
of new tax reporting requirements for both beneficiaries and
colleges.

<p>
   Tel Aviv, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Israeli stocks are seen falling
in the days ahead, analysts said, even as Foreign Minister David
Levy resigned in a cabinet dispute over spending in the 1998
budget.
<p>
   The Maof Index of 25 stocks ranked by market value dropped 0.99
percent to 302.89. The Tel Aviv 100 Index, also ranked by market
capitalization, lost 0.67 percent to 291.77. The Tel Aviv
Continuous Trading Index, reflecting shares in the bourse's
continuous trading system, declined 0.66 percent to 97.41.
<p>
   Investors were ``waiting to see what'' Foreign Minister David
Levy had ``up his sleeve'' today said Ron Weisberg, an
international trader at Israel Brokerage and Investments, before
Levy announced he was quitting at a press conference which took
place after the close of trading.
<p>
   Stocks are poised to continuing falling Monday after the
uncertainty about the future of the governing coalition caused by
the resignation, analysts said.
<p>
   Declining stocks included Israel's three largest banks: Bank
Hapoalim Ltd., down 1.5 percent to 8.37 shekels ($2.36); Bank Leumi
Ltd., down 1.5 percent to 5.86; and Israel Discount Bank Ltd., down
0.3 percent to 3.69.
<p>
   Supermarket retailer Supersol Ltd., dropped 1.1 percent to 10.04
and state-run telephone company Bezeq Ltd. lost 1.2 percent to
9.69. Gainers
<p>
   Offsetting the losses were software house Formula Systems Ltd.,
up 2 percent to 116.2; drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd., up 2.3 percent to 172.2; and maker of digital voice-logging
software Nice Systems Ltd., up 0.8 percent to 152.3.
<p>
   ``Without a doubt, the story with the budget will not influence
the market positively,'' said Idan Azoulay, a fund manager at
Impact Securities.
<p>
   Weisberg said that if government has to re-examine the entire
budget, ``the market won't like it too much.''
<p>
   Across the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, 127.1 million shekels ($35.8
million) of shares were traded. More than three shares rose for
every two that declined.
<p>
   Bank Leumi was the most active share, with 8.4 million shekels
in transactions.
<p>
   Clal Trading rose 2.9 percent to 14.7. Clal Israel Ltd., a
holding company with interests in computers, construction and
utilities, said in a statement its board would meet tomorrow to
consider an offer from investor Gad Ze'evi to purchase all of
subsidiary Clal Trading for about $150 million.
<p>
   Clal Israel shares dropped 1.8 percent to 1.05 shekels.
Affiliate Clal Electronics Industries Ltd. sank 2.3 percent to 522.
<p>
   Teva and Formula rose after American depositary receipts of the
companies rose 2.6 percent and 8.2 percent respectively. Nice
gained after its ADRs added 2.2 percent in New York. Bezeq dropped
after a report in the Financial Times said the U.K.'s Cable &AMP;
Wireless Plc plans to raise its stake in the state-run telephone
company to 13 percent from 10 percent.
<p>
   While Levy's resignation leaves Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu with a majority in parliament, analysts said the budget
was unlikely to pass as other members of the coalition were seen
joining Levy to vote against it. Furthermore, they said early
elections were likely in the wake of the resignation.
<p>
   Netanyahu later said his coalition will try and force through
the budget in the face of opposition, and pledged his government
will complete its term, even as opponents urged early elections.
<p>
   Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is scheduled to vote on the
1998 budget Monday at 2 p.m. The vote was delayed from Thursday
night after Levy said he would oppose the proposal and resign
because the budget did not answer the needs of the poor.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry has crafted a 207.4-billion shekel ($58.5
billion) budget which lowers the deficit target to 2.4 percent of
Israel's economic growth in 1998 from a target of 2.8 percent last
year.
<p>
   Analysts said that if the parliament passes a budget that sticks
to its spending target, the central bank is likely to lower
interest rates during the first quarter of 1998.
<p>
   The central bank uses higher rates to cool the economy and
combat higher prices.
<p>
   Higher rates hurt companies, which pay more for expansion,
cutting into profits. Higher rates also tend to attract investors
out of equities and into fixed-income investments and bank
deposits. That can boost demand for the shekel and strengthen the
currency against foreign currencies.
<p>
   In turn, the currency strengthening can hurt exporters because
their products become more expensive overseas. They also pay
expenses in stronger shekels and earn revenue in weaker foreign
currency.
<p>
   The shekel weakened to 3.548 against the U.S. dollar on Friday
compared with 3.536 on Wednesday. The shekel didn't trade on the
holiday of New Year's Day.

   Like consumers who vow each year to snuff out a smoking habit or
to make fewer trips to the refrigerator, manufacturers of
everything from cars to computer software have lofty goals for new
products in 1998. Some items are truly innovative while others may
be just silly enough to work.
<p>
   Pepsi has a new can. Volkswagen is bringing back the Beetle.
Microsoft is updating Windows, and men's and women's fashion
apparel is expected to lean to the classic. What is more, many
consumers will get their first look at high-definition television
sets and their first taste of fat-free snacks made with olestra,
the fat substitute from Procter &AMP; Gamble.
<p>
   Obviously, manufacturers are hoping to cash in on the upbeat
economy and high level of consumer confidence. ``If your market
research comes back and says people have disposable income, then
clearly you are more motivated to put more new products on the
market or reposition old products,'' said Milton Rosenau Jr.,
president of the Product Development and Management Association, a
trade group.
<p>
   Toy makers and retailers are doing a bit of both as they count
on the next generation of virtual pets  &MD;  those egg-shaped,
computerized toys on a key chain that ``die'' if not properly fed
and cared for  &MD;  to pull in shoppers. The latest virtual pets
combine elements of another product that has been hot for more than
a year: stuffed animals.
<p>
   Stuffed animals have been helped by the popularity of the likes
of Tickle Me Elmo, Beanie Babies and Sing and Snore Ernie. And
virtual pets are all the rage with youngsters, so much so that many
parents cannot get their children to put them down long enough to
do their homework. But warm and fuzzy they are not.
<p>
   So, toy makers hope that by combining stuffed animals with the
technology that makes pets like Tamagotchi from Bandai Co. so
appealing, they will create an even bigger frenzy for cuddly cyber
creatures. This spring, Oddzon Inc. will introduce e.Baby, an
electronic stuffed baby bear with an expressive computer-like face.
The toy, which will sell at retail for $19.99, talks, kisses,
giggles and burps and makes more than 100 other sounds and phrases.
The bear might pout, for instance, and say, ``My tummy hurts,''
until the ``parent'' responds.
<p>
   As for grown-ups, Volkswagen is counting on a hit with a car
that could play well to consumers' nostalgia. The German automaker
is revising the Beetle and introducing it this spring, 21 years
after the original version was phased out in the United States.
<p>
   Though the Beetle has been updated for the 1990s, it has a retro
feel and resembles the familiar Bug that many baby boomers drove to
proms and college campuses years ago.
<p>
   ``We have created a 21st century design that evokes that feeling
people had for the original,'' said Tony Fouladpour, a spokesman
for Volkswagen of America in Auburn Hills, Mich. ``What we want to
do is give people the sensation of driving into the future, not
into the past.''
<p>
   Indeed, under the sheet metal, this car is nothing like your
father's Bug. That extends to the price, which the company says
will be in the range of $15,000 to $16,000, compared with the
$3,600 it took to drive away with one the last year the company
sold the original model in the United States. Some features of the
new Beetle, like airbags and anti-lock brakes, were unheard of in
the first generation and reflect new technology in the auto
industry. One of the biggest differences, though, is the placement
of the engine. Remember the rear-end engine and front-end cargo
compartment? The motor for this one is under the front hood. VW
will provide the first peek at the new car  &MD;  previously only the
concept version was shown  &MD;  this week at the Detroit auto show.
<p>
   Speaking of updated technology, Microsoft is expected to
introduce Windows 98, the new version of its dominant computer
operating system software. No date has been set, however, and the
company  &MD;  following its recent pattern  &MD;  has already delayed the
planned introduction.
<p>
   Microsoft now says the release will occur in the second quarter
of this year, but a judge's preliminary ruling in December that the
company must allow computer companies to separate Microsoft's
Internet browser software from its operating system software could
cause further delay. The software had been expected to integrate
Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, more closely into
Windows.
<p>
   As for consumer electronics, the big news this year is the
expected sale of the first high-definition television sets, or
HDTV, which are to be in some stores by the summer.
<p>
   The government's decision last year to begin the transmission of
the next generation of television, the nation's first
broadcast-television standard update in more than 40 years, will
eventually render obsolete all 240 million sets now in use around
the country.
<p>
   Because the new sets will encompass the digital technology used
in computers, they will open up the possibility of more interactive
services. They will also offer a far sharper picture than can be
received today and will include ``surround-sound'' systems.
<p>
   ``It will be like having a movie theater in your home,'' said
Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association.
<p>
   The sets will not be cheap, though. Prices are expected to start
at nearly $3,000, though industry experts expect them to drop
quickly. And consumers will have several years to replace the
televisions they currently own before conventional analog
broadcasting ends.

   As for those trips to the kitchen during commercial breaks,
several food companies are rolling out new or updated products and
packaging.
<p>
   Snackers watching their waistlines will be able to nibble on
olestra products when chips containing the ingredient, to be
marketed under the name Olean, are rolled out nationally this
summer. The products include Procter &AMP; Gamble's Pringles potato
chips, Frito-Lay's Wow chips and Nabisco's Fat Free Wheat Thins and
Fat Free Ritz Crackers, although Nabisco has not yet decided
whether it will sell its snacks nationwide. All of the products are
on store shelves in Indianapolis, a favorite test market for many
companies.
<p>
   While olestra promises the taste of real munchies without the
fat and with half the calories, it can cause gastrointestinal
distress, which prompted the Food and Drug Administration to
require a warning label on every box and bag of snacks containing
it. It reads: ``Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose
stools''  &MD;  not great from a marketing standpoint. Procter, which
gained FDA approval in 1996 to use olestra in salty snacks, says
that only about 2 percent of people who consume it experience
digestive upset, which the company says is the same proportion of
people who experience problems from eating raw vegetables or
high-fiber foods.
<p>
   But the harshest critic of olestra, Michael Jacobson, executive
director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has said
that calls to his agency indicate a much higher percentage of
people experiencing problems with olestra products.
<p>
   For those who do decide to indulge in olestra products, they can
wash them down with Pepsi that is now being sold in updated cans.
The containers, which replaced the red, white and blue cans, are
bright royal blue with the word Pepsi in white lettering on the
side. The packaging is the company's first American redesign since
1991. It coincides with Pepsico's 1998 advertising campaign and is
intended to highlight blue as the theme color for the company's
100th anniversary this year and to play up the Pepsi globe logo.
<p>
   Fast-food companies, meanwhile, also plan several new products.
After two years of testing, Burger King recently introduced a
french fry that it says will be crisper than other fried spuds. The
goal is to steal as many fast-food lovers as possible from the
chain with the golden arches.
<p>
   Not to be outdone, McDonald's is taking a stab at an oval burger
that it says is meatier than traditional patties and is refining
its overall menu and will switch to a new kitchen production system
in the second quarter of this year. The maker of the Big Mac has
suffered from stiff competition, not just from other burger makers
but also from chains like Boston Market that are popular with
consumers looking for alternatives to fried foods and beef patties.
<p>
   On the fashion front, look for classic clothes to continue to be
big, whether on Fifth Avenue or Main Street.
<p>
   ``I think we've entered a period in which classics are the way
retailers make money,'' said Alan Milstein, publisher of Fashion
Network Report, a publication that caters to the garment trade.
``Things that are too way out or froufrou are really passe because
it involves too much risk.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   After a tumultuous two years of declining sales and heavy
returns of unsold titles, the book publishing industry is facing
another sluggish year with hopes that high technology electronic
sales and old-fashioned good writing will provide some relief.
<p>
   In recent months, top publishing executives from New York have
been making quiet pilgrimages to the crowded headquarters of the
electronic bookstore Amazon.com in downtown Seattle, partly out of
curiosity and partly out of the expectation that 1998 could be a
critical year for determining whether Internet commerce will become
a significant market force.
<p>
   From terra firma, Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest
bookselling chain, is also open for electronic business, and
Borders Books, the second-largest chain, is preparing to hang out
its virtual shingle in 1998.
<p>
   Late last year, the chief executive of Penguin Putnam, Michael
Lynton, predicted that Amazon.com Inc. was growing at such a rate
that in two to three years it could become one of the publisher's
largest customers.
<p>
   Over the summer, the number of Amazon.com customer accounts
increased by 54 percent, to 940,000 in September, according to the
company's third-quarter financial report.
<p>
   Some publishers remain cautious about the future of electronic
commerce. But they recognize the potential for exploring a new
frontier that offers international customers, detailed information
on readers and steady sales of books on backlists or older titles,
as well as the most coveted of reviews: word-of-mouth
recommendations.
<p>
   It also offers new opportunities to reach customers at a time
when the Association of American Publishers is reporting that sales
of hardcover books were down by almost 5 percent last year. The
decline was about 7 percent for mass market paperback books, and
sales of even one of the steadiest of titles, the Bible, were
four-tenths of a percent lower.
<p>
   Many publishing executives said they expected the market to
remain sluggish through 1998, with book prices rising to cope with
the downturn in sales.
<p>
   ``I think that the doldrums that appeared to exist in '97 will
continue into '98,'' said Jack Romanos, president of the consumer
group at Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is one of the few large publishing
companies predicting that their sales will be slightly ahead of
1996. ``I also think that publishers have gotten a lot smarter
about what they can and cannot publish.''
<p>
   Romanos was among the publishing executives who went to Seattle
to meet with Amazon founder and chairman Jeffrey P. Bezos.
<p>
   He came away marveling at the potential for the sales of titles
on backlists. ``What's more fascinating is that they know who's
buying the books and what they like,'' he said. ``And that's
incredibly valuable to us.''
<p>
   John Sargent, the chief executive of St. Martin's Press, also
took a field trip to Seattle late last year. ``I'm a believer in
on-line bookselling,'' he said. ``The interesting thing to watch
for next year is the rate of growth. How long will they be able to
maintain it?''
<p>
   His company's interest was piqued, Sargent said, when Amazon.com
customers gave rave reviews to ``Behind the Scenes at the Museum,''
a first novel that St. Martin's published, by the British author
Kate Atkinson.
<p>
   He said that on the strength of enthusiastic reader reviews,
total sales tripled for the novel's paperback version, which
revolves around the life of an eccentric family and its pet shop.
<p>
   The success of such a small literary book is heartening for
publishers who began to recognize in 1997 that good writing, if
properly marketed, could actually sell better than the so-called
celeb-lit. ``Angela's Ashes,'' ``Cold Mountain,'' ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil'' are all examples of literary books that
climbed to the top of best-seller lists in 1997.
<p>
   At Random House, the new editor in chief, Ann Godoff, quickly
made clear that this type of book was her priority.
<p>
   She was named in November to replace Harold Evans, who was
associated with celebrity books by Dick Morris, Marlon Brando,
Colin Powell and Michael Eisner. She canceled the fabled
early-morning literary breakfasts that Evans presided over at
Barneys and that were broadcast on radio.
<p>
   Ms. Godoff also started promoting what she described as ``very,
very solid books'' at the ritual conferences where sales
representatives gather for descriptions of books to be published in
the coming season.
<p>
   At the December conference, she said the sales people rallied
around ``Cold New World,'' a collection of essays by William
Finnegan, a writer at The New Yorker, about the barriers that the
young face in reaching middle-class status.
<p>
   ``We've done very well with this book, with good books,'' she
said. ``We have to counter a marketplace that's saying, `Let's get
it off the shelf' by giving them reasons to keep it on a shelf.''
<p>
   For Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove/Atlantic Press, such
talk of eschewing celebrity titles for well-written books is a
little unnerving because of the threat of keener competition.
<p>
   His independent company published a literary first novel, ``Cold
Mountain,'' to great critical and financial success in 1997. The
author, Charles Frazier, won the National Book Award for fiction in
November, and the book sold more than a million copies.
<p>
   While the large companies were preoccupied with celebrity books
and ignoring others, Entrekin said that his company could sign up
books for reasonable prices. But in general he said he considered a
shift in emphasis to quality writing a wise move.
<p>
   Entrekin said he was planning to invest some of the profits from
the success of ``Cold Mountain'' in a new category for his company:
literary sportswriting.
<p>
   ``People respond to quality,'' Entrekin said. ``I just believe
that the whole `media-zation' of the planet is making us all much
more sophisticated.''

<p>
   Ask Cameron Montgomery about his life in the 1980s, and he may
flip you a wry smile. As a stockbroker in New Orleans, Montgomery
drove a Porsche, wore expensive suits and popped down to Barbados
and Jamaica for long winter weekends.
<p>
   He does none of that anymore.
<p>
   Not only did Montgomery walk out on his country club, he also
yanked his kids out of their private schools and placed them in
public ones. His suits have been swapped for polo shirts and
khakis, and seldom does he think about stocks and bonds  &MD;  unless
they come up in one of his nightmares.
<p>
   ``I wanted a simpler life,'' said Montgomery, who now lives in
Greenville, Miss., and teaches marketing at Delta State University.
``When I was a stockbroker, I didn't like the ethics or the
pressure. The money back then was nice, but I just didn't feel like
I was helping anybody. Now I have kids, and they take a lot of my
time and money.''
<p>
   Meet the '90s consumer. Even those who are earning as much or
more than before, and generally feeling good about their financial
futures, are not exactly jumping for joy. Money that would have
gone into a new Mercedes or a Gucci gown 10 years ago is now being
poured into the stock market, as a sandbag for when the tide rolls
out.
<p>
   Still, while the '80s may have been the decade of greed,
gluttony has not disappeared. Debt levels continue to soar, as
consumers make ``sensible'' purchases  &MD;  buying a home instead of
renting, and trading in a flashy sports car for a more practical
but equally expensive sport utility vehicle. In the '90s, spending
has just taken on a more prudent veneer.
<p>
   ``The '90s is about a psychology of uncertainty that has
supplanted the affluence of the '80s,'' said Madelyn Hochstein,
president of DYG Inc., an opinion polling company in Danbury, Conn.
``The consumer view is that the economy is good now but it won't
always be that way. Therefore, you have to be practical about
money; you just can't go out and spend it.''
<p>
   No one talked much about thriftiness during Ronald Reagan's
years as president. The Great Communicator himself spoke endlessly
about putting the country on a balanced budget, but such frugality
hardly extended to the household budget, what with Nancy Reagan's
propensity to snap up Lenox china and designer gowns.
<p>
   Meanwhile, neither Reagan nor Congress backed up the talk of a
balanced budget, and the budget deficit actually almost tripled
during his presidency. With that kind of example, spending and
greed quickly became the national norms. Nowhere were they more
prevalent than on television. Couch commandos in the '80s spent
their Friday evenings gaping at the shenanigans of the oil-rich
Ewings, whose dirty deals  &MD;  and extramarital escapades  &MD;  made
``Dallas'' one of the most popular television shows of all time.
<p>
   ``A lot happened between that time in the '80s and today,'' Ms.
Hochstein said. ``The market crashed in 1987, and companies started
to downsize. Not only were companies restructured, many executives
were restructured as well. They may be working now but not in the
job they once were. People haven't forgotten any of those things
that happened to them.''
<p>
   That may explain why extravagance like that exhibited by the
first couple of ``Dallas''  &MD;  J.R., the villain, and Sue Ellen, his
saucer-eyed wife  &MD;  no longer captures the nation's fascination.
``Melrose Place'' may be the closest ``Dallas'' equivalent  &MD; 
certainly in the amount of bedroom gymnastics allotted to a single
hour  &MD;  but the characters are far from wealthy. Billy, one
fresh-faced hunk of the show's many, works in an advertising
agency. Not only does he live in a modest apartment, his only
splurge appears to be for a gym membership to perfect his chiseled
abs.
<p>
   More important to the '90s consumer, though, Billy has a job.
And he goes to it every day. The '90s are a time of careers, 401(k)
contributions, promotions and the stock options that come with
them.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The nation's low unemployment rate has given consumers a sense
of comfort  &MD;  at least for the time being  &MD;  that they haven't
experienced in decades. A University of Michigan survey of consumer
confidence in December hit its highest point since 1965.
<p>
   What is noteworthy, though, is how people are spending money
compared with the '80s. Some 66 percent of all households now own
their homes  &MD;  more than ever before  &MD;  one more statistic in the
chase for security. Once baby boomers and Generation X'ers have
families, their cash does not stray too far from the cradle.
<p>
   When an affluent couple of the '80s wanted to show off their
wealth, they bought a Mercedes or a BMW to turn a few heads at the
country club or the supermarket parking lot. Today, if that same
couple had children, they would buy a Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand
Cherokee to tool around town showing off their troop.
<p>
   With many family expenses outpacing inflation, children may now
be the ultimate status symbol. College tuition and fees, for
instance, have risen 5 percent annually for public and private
schools in the '90s, a decade in which inflation is crawling ever
closer to zero. And there is, of course, the obligatory expense of
keeping the children equipped with Gap clothes as they grow up.
<p>
   To meet these responsibilities, and others, consumers have
turned to the stock market. In the '80s, the market was the
playground for moguls like Michael Milken to get rich quick. Now
the club membership has broadened. Consumers have discovered that
investing is one way to get comfortable slowly, and they have
dumped record amounts of their disposable income into stocks.
Individuals now own some $5.7 trillion in stocks, twice the amount
they owned in 1991, according to the Federal Reserve.
<p>
   With all this income going to buy homes and stocks, consumers
certainly are not saving much cash. The personal savings rate is
now about 4 percent, compared with 5.1 percent to 5.5 percent in
the late '80s.
<p>
   They are still spending money on themselves, of course, though
perhaps in more subtle ways. The must brands of 10 years ago  &MD; 
names like Armani and Gucci  &MD;  are still around, but they have been
supplemented in wardrobes and behind the driver's seat of sport
utility vehicles by outdoor clothing from Patagonia or the North
Face.
<p>
   Outfitted like this, consumers have been choosing ever more
exotic vacations. Beach resorts like Cancun, Mexico, may have been
the hot spots of 10 years ago, but now people want vacations with
meaning  &MD;  or at least the perception of it. A survey by the
American Society of Travel Agents last summer disclosed that more
travelers were booking adventurous trips than in the past. Two of
the most popular destinations were South Africa and Costa Rica.
<p>
   One popular excursion offered by Destination World, a travel
agency in Santa Barbara, Calif., is a two-week trip each August
from Los Angeles to Tana Toraja, on a tiny island in Indonesia that
is known for its annual burial service. The price: about $6,000,
including air fare.
<p>
   While the hangover from the extravagance of the '80s may have
made many people cautious about their long-term futures, they have
not been willing to give up the instant gratification of splurges
like these  &MD;  particularly when the stock market deposits unexpected
gains in their laps.
<p>
   ``I already have more money than I thought I was going to
have,'' said Edgar A. Hatcher, a retired New York City advertising
executive. ``My wife and I have been able to take vacations and
pick up a few nice prints. But my children are having to work
harder than I did. They make more money than I ever did and still
they're not sure how they're going to make it.''

<p>
   Asking those who frequent the Internet to recall the medium's
milestone events in 1997 is likely to elicit blank stares  &MD;  or an
unnaturally long wait (up to an hour, say) for an e-mail response.
<p>
   The problem is, there have been far too many milestones. On the
Internet, virtual time flies at something approximating the pace of
digital dog years. And even under the temporal compression of
cyberspace, some data always get lost.
<p>
   Remember, for instance, ``push technology,'' that
advertiser-friendly concept that was going to revolutionize the way
information was distributed on the World Wide Web by putting stuff
in front of your face while you sat back passively? Don't worry,
neither does anyone else, even though it was all the rage in April.
<p>
   What about the Communications Decency Act, which was going to
either make the Internet safe for children or cruelly stunt the
global computer network? Sure, the Supreme Court overturned it,
saying that online speech must be accorded the highest possible
constitutional protection. But that was six whole months ago. The
preoccupation with legislation seems a bit absurd now, with all
sorts of technological ``filters'' available to block cybersmut.
<p>
   Or does it? Actually, the censorship question has already
mutated into a more complex debate over the dangers of the
``filtering'' software, which, unlike the laws of governments,
censors silently, often without the user's knowledge.
<p>
   An international group of software manufacturers is to meet in
London this month to consider adopting a filtering standard known
as the Platform for Internet Content Selection, or PICS, that will
more easily enable private groups, including businesses, to weed
out undesirable electronic material.
<p>
   ``You should be doing a month in review,'' advised Esther Dyson,
editor of a computer industry newsletter, Release 1.0, and author
of the book ``Release 2.0'' (Broadway Books, 1997). ``A year is
forever in Internet time.''
<p>
   The warped time dimension of the Internet makes the exercise of
formulating yearlong predictions particularly surreal, as most
Web-based businesses learned long ago. What could distinguish 1998
from previous eras of Internet evolution, however, is that the U.S.
government seems finally to be catching on to both accelerated time
on the Internet and the supple texture of cyberspace. At the same
time, a growing number of other nations are entering the cyberzone,
making for new clashes and alliances.
<p>
   The European Commission, for instance, is supporting the PICS
filtering technology, which the Clinton administration favors. But
it is also set to enforce a strict data protection directive that
would cut off the flow of commercial data to nations whose privacy
protections are deemed inadequate. That may well include the United
States, which has yet to establish new privacy laws despite fears
that online data bases and powerful electronic search technologies
are eroding privacy protections.
<p>
   Having announced its support for self-policing by the data
brokering industry  &MD;  the companies that sell personal information
about you  &MD;  the Federal Trade Commission is expected to report to
Congress about the sale of private data in general and more
specifically about threats to children's online privacy. In
addition, legislation has been introduced to deal with other issues
raised by the expansion of cyberspace, like encryption, copyright
and free speech. Each has been the focus of intense debate among
industry groups, civil libertarians and the government.
<p>
   What is more, with many industrialized nations vowing to
collaborate in fighting computer crime, the balance between
individual privacy and national  &MD;  even international  &MD;  security is
likely to remain a tense theme as governments seek to impose law
and order on cyberspace.
<p>
   Inevitably, laws have lagged the mushrooming development of
electronic communication. The Clinton administration last year took
a stance determinedly in favor of self-regulation in areas like
commerce and  &MD;  after the Communications Decency Act was thrown out
 &MD;  sexually explicit or violent material. In part, that stance is a
grudging acceptance of a reality that frightens governments: the
Internet's utter indifference to national borders undermines
traditional state sovereignty.
<p>
   But in addition to resigning themselves to self-regulation,
governments are collaborating to reassert more traditional forms of
authority, in many cases with a combination of law and computer
code that seeks to shape cyberspace itself.
<p>
   The Communications Decency Act, for instance, was a blunt,
old-fashioned instrument that the Court said would have violated
constitutional protections on a broad range of speech. New
legislation seeks to impose a self-rating technology to keep
children from pornographic material.
<p>
   Similarly, the FBI continues to push for laws that would give
police agencies the legal right plus the technical tools to perform
digital wiretapping.
<p>
   Mixing new laws with new computer codes strikes some experts as
potentially perilous to civil liberties.
<p>
   ``My fear is that the government is getting the idea that code
is the most efficient regulator in cyberspace,'' said Lawrence
Lessig of Harvard Law School. ``And we don't have a constitutional
tradition to resist that.''
<p>
   Lessig was interviewed last month before he was appointed
special master in the antitrust case against Microsoft Corp., an
appointment that attests to a heightened government awareness of
the growing interdependence of the codes that drive computers and
societies. He has five months to investigate the government's
charge that Microsoft is using its Windows 95 operating system to
enhance its position in the Internet browser market.

<p>
   The upbeat, bouncy television commercials set to rock music show
all-American scenes of consumerism, happy people of all walks of
life using Microsoft products. They end with the uplifting
question: ``Where do you want to go today?''
<p>
   The ads speak of unlimited horizons, so apt a sentiment coming
from Microsoft Corp. The software giant comes off another banner
year of remarkable growth and profitability, and expansion into new
fields with investments in everything from cable television to
voice-recognition software. Microsoft has $9 billion in cash, no
debt and ambitious plans. Last August, the company acknowledged the
obvious  &MD;  that the Apple Macintosh system software was no longer a
genuine rival to Windows  &MD;  and it made peace and a deal with its
longtime adversary, Apple Computer. Microsoft invested $150 million
in Apple, and the companies agreed to cooperate on several sales
and technology fronts.

   Microsoft, it seems, can go just about anywhere it wants, unless
the government stops it. The chances that the government might get
in Microsoft's way, though still uncertain, have increased lately
as antitrust officials at the Justice Department have aggressively
pursued the company in court.
<p>
   Where Microsoft decides to go, wherever it steps, has a ripple
effect across the computer industry. Its wealth and market power
are such that no start-up software company can even consider
opening its doors without first handicapping Microsoft's
intentions. Create a promising new market niche, and Microsoft may
soon follow with its armies of programmers and its marketing muscle
to crush the fledgling company. Then again, it can just as easily
be a benefactor. In truth, the goal of many start-ups is to get on
the radar screen at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., and
get bought out, at a handsome profit.
<p>
   Given the Microsoft dominance of the market for operating system
programs, the Microsoft influence is felt by every
personal-computer company and nearly everyone who uses a PC.
Competitors may complain about Microsoft, but, like it or not, they
must also cooperate with Microsoft because their programs must run
on Windows.
<p>
   Corporate and individual customers may complain about certain
program features, but they keep on buying Microsoft offerings, from
Windows NT Server to Flight Simulator, by the truck load. Which is
why Microsoft is one of the most admired companies in the world,
why it has a stock market value that is more than three times that
of General Motors and why its chairman, Bill Gates, is not only the
nation's richest person but also a national hero to many Americans.
<p>
   All of which makes competing against Microsoft an uphill
struggle.
<p>
   Eric Schmidt, one of the computer industry's more thoughtful and
articulate executives, assessed the Microsoft effect one summer
night last year in Dallas. He had recently left a job as chief
technology officer of Sun Microsystems Inc. to become chairman of
Novell Inc., and as part of his turnaround campaign at the network
software maker he was visiting with groups of Novell corporate
customers around the country. Wherever he went, Schmidt recalled,
they all talked about the same thing  &MD;  Microsoft, and how could
Novell compete against Microsoft.
<p>
   ``I've competed against Microsoft for years, but I never quite
appreciated how big Microsoft has become, not just as a company,
but as a brand and as part of the national consciousness,'' Schmidt
said. ``It's the products, the Microsoft marketing juggernaut, Bill
Gates' wealth, all those magazine cover stories. It's everything.''
<p>
   So where is Microsoft headed? Microsoft executives and industry
analysts talk of three trends.
<p>
   First, the company wants to go further into the
industrial-strength heart of corporate computing with its Windows
NT operating system and server software. The buzz phrase Microsoft
applies to this market is ``high-performance network computing,''
and it is a drive to extend Microsoft's dominant reach beyond the
desktop to the heavy-lifting computing done by hub computers
running Unix software and even by mainframe computers. The main
corporate targets are Sun Microsystems, Novell and IBM.
<p>
   Jeffrey Raikes, Microsoft's group vice president for sales and
marketing, said: ``In corporate America, the debate about switching
to Windows NT has moved from `if' to `when,' and companies are
increasingly using Windows NT for what they used to use Novell and
Unix for. That's a very positive trend for us.''

   Microsoft is also investing to extend its reach further into
American households. Conventional PCs, even with prices for some
models moving below $1,000, are still costly for a mass-market
device. The new frontier for distributing Microsoft software is
television or some future variant of television. That explains
Microsoft's purchase, for $425 million, of WebTV Networks, a
company that developed a set-top box technology for delivering
Internet services on television. Similarly, Microsoft's $1 billion
investment for a stake in Comcast, the cable company, is intended
to encourage cable companies to invest in upgrading their
high-speed networks to handle Internet services.
<p>
   ``WebTV is the terminal device, and cable television is the
connecting device  &MD;  the high-speed conduit  &MD;  for Microsoft driving
itself into every living room in the United States and later in the
world,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business
School. ``This is an expansion of Bill Gates' original vision of
Microsoft software on every desktop. Now, he's going for every home
as well.''
<p>
   The investments in cable and set-top box technology are not
expected to yield profits anytime soon. The payoff is uncertain,
especially since the cable industry is fiercely resisting any path
that would allow Microsoft to control set-top box software, as it
does PC operating-system software. But the effort by Microsoft is
part of its program of investing heavily for future growth.
<p>
   The beyond-the-PC move into the home, analysts say, is
Microsoft's effort to extend its core software business in a major
new market, just as Windows NT is taking the company deeper into
corporate computing. And Microsoft's core operating system business
is extremely lucrative. David Readerman, an analyst at Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities, estimates that operating system revenues in
1997 were $4.6 billion and produced gross profit margins of 90
percent.
<p>
   ``That is why the defense and advance of its operating system is
absolutely essential strategically to Microsoft,'' Readerman said.
<p>
   The third big trend at Microsoft seems to be a retooling of its
media strategy, after heavy losses at its MSN online service. The
emphasis, industry executives say, will now be more on online
commerce, like its popular Expedia travel site, and less on
producing online programming. ``It's a savvy move on their part and
an admission of failure  &MD;  Microsoft is not good at creating media
properties,'' said Michael Slade, chairman of Starwave Corp., a new
media company.
<p>
   In short, the new Microsoft approach will be more software and
less entertainment, or content. ``Our strength is software
platforms,'' said Raikes, the Microsoft group vice president. ``For
the most part, we don't have any unique content expertise.''
<p>
   The wild card in Microsoft's future is Washington, the
government's antitrust challenges to its marketing practices. Later
this year, a federal judge is expected to issue a final ruling on
the suit alleging that it is violating a 1995 consent decree.
Microsoft, the government charges, is using its near-monopoly on
computer operating systems to try to unfairly gain control over the
market for Internet browsing software.
<p>
   Microsoft has said it intends to push ahead with the
introduction of the next generation of its PC operating system,
Windows 98, in the second quarter of this year. It is sticking to
that plan despite the judge's temporary ruling that the company
must allow computer makers to unbundle the operating system from
the company's Internet software. Windows 98 has been expected to
more closely integrate the two.
<p>
   In addition to the Justice Department suit, several state
attorneys general are investigating Microsoft, as are antitrust
officials in Europe. So far, the scrutiny has not curbed its
product plans or marketing practices in any significant way. The
only certainty on the government front is that as long as Microsoft
retains its powerful grip in the market, the scrutiny will
continue.

<p>
   SHANGHAI, China  &MD;  The numbers look good. It's what they hide
that is not so pretty.
<p>
   China's economy is still bustling along at high speed, growing
8.8 percent in 1997 and expected to increase nearly as fast in
1998. It is almost as though China were operating in a different
hemisphere from that of its Asian neighbors who are now engulfed by
financial meltdown.
<p>
   Inflation, once the greatest cause of fear to Chinese leaders
who remember how it helped lead to widespread unrest in 1989, is
now close to zero and is expected to remain in the low single
digits. Just a few years ago, even the most optimistic government
planners did not envision such a combination of muscular growth and
low inflation.
<p>
   ``Strong economic growth will continue next year,'' said Ye
Zhen, a spokesman for China's State Statistical Bureau. ``Inflation
will remain at the lowest level in the 1990s, leaving much room to
coordinate economic growth with stable consumer products.''
<p>
   But the economy has a gritty underside: a morass of dilapidated
industry left over from state-planning days, tens of millions of
grumpy, underemployed workers and insolvent banks trying to wean
Chinese companies from an irrational system of ``loans'' that are
still effectively state handouts.
<p>
   All these factors make the 1998 economic performance highly
unpredictable. Such a deep divide separates the old, state-planned
way of allocating money and the new, market-driven methods, which
have only seeped halfway into the financial system, that it is
impossible to know where change will come smoothly and where it
will not.
<p>
   In a sense, the Asian financial crisis could not have come at a
worse time for China. In 1997, Chinese leaders essentially accepted
the inevitable by finally deciding to cut loose the bulk of
state-owned industries, once the mainstay of the socialist economy,
because they have been draining state coffers more heavily each
year.
<p>
   In the coming year, Chinese leaders hope to start engineering a
huge sell-off of the state-run sector, opening the door to the
near-certainty of even greater numbers of layoffs, with the aim of
essentially restructuring the nation's system of ownership within
three years.
<p>
   With the regional economy tumbling downward, precisely at a time
when China most needs stable income, Beijing has become vulnerable
to falling foreign investment and increased competition for its
exports. Asian investors, in particular, are expected to back away
from sinking new money into China.
<p>
   Though farmers still make up the vast majority of China's
population of more than a billion, the urban work force is up to
120 million, mostly employed by state-run industry. Many are
underemployed  &MD;  not working, but still officially on the payroll at
salaries as low as $10 a month in some cases  &MD;  and the
restructuring is expected to lead to widespread layoffs.
<p>
   A largely unknowable factor is how many of those workers and
their families are already surviving on China's enormous
underground economy. The combination of high taxes and poor
enforcement is a powerful incentive to many businessmen to keep
their entire operations off the books. No one has any reasonable
estimates for the size of China's black economy.
<p>
   Perhaps the greatest uncertainty is what new form of ownership
will emerge as the sell-off of government-run companies takes
shape. Economists have resisted the term ``privatization,'' because
even as local governments seek buyers, they are expected to oppose
the concentration of economic power in the hands of any one
individual.
<p>
   ``I think it will look more like South Korea, less like
Russia,'' said an economist who studies China for Standard
Chartered Securities in Hong Kong but refused to be identified.
``They are going to be much more comfortable with large
government-backed conglomerates than with sprawling empires run by
private entrepreneurs.''
<p>
   In any case, there are still sharp limits on the opportunities
for foreign investors. And actual foreign investment, after
reaching $44 billion in 1997 as a number of contracts signed in
previous years came to fruition, is expected to fall sharply in
1998.
<p>
   Exports, going gangbusters with 20 percent growth in 1997, are
expected to keep growing, but at a slower rate. Several government
economists predict an 8 percent increase for exports in 1998,
reducing China's overall trade surplus, which by Chinese statistics
reached $40 billion in 1997 and is likely to drop to $32 billion in
1998.
<p>
   Because a major portion of China's exports are goods involving
the assembly of raw materials or parts that were imported from
Southeast Asia, initial costs will fall because of the declines in
those countries' currencies, possibly making China's exports
cheaper as well.
<p>
   Slower export growth, mostly because of competition with
Southeast Asian countries whose goods are now less expensive, may
also reduce trade disputes with the United States, China's biggest
trading partner.

<p>
   Detroit, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it will
introduce by 2001 a gasoline- and electricity-powered vehicle that
gets 60 miles per gallon of fuel, becoming the latest automaker to
show off its environmentally friendly cars and trucks.
<p>
   The world's largest automaker also said it could introduce
another alternative-fuel vehicle, an electric car powered by a
hydrogen fuel cell, by 2004.
<p>
   The move follows harsh criticism of automakers at a worldwide
conference on global warming in Japan and Toyota Motor Corp.'s
introduction of a gas-electric hybrid car, the Prius, that it's
selling this year in Japan. ``Green'' technology is a major theme
at the North American International Auto Show, which opened to
media previews today in Detroit, and GM's announcement provided the
best look so far at its efforts to make fuel-efficient vehicles
practical enough for everyday use.
<p>
   ``These cars are clean, safe and fun to drive,'' said GM
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr.
<p>
   GM, like other U.S. automakers, is hoping that parading its
advanced-technology cars and trucks will discourage regulators from
enacting stricter rules about vehicle fuel consumption and
pollution.
<p>
   Environmental groups say cars and trucks are a major source of
harmful emissions that endanger the earth's atmosphere and that
carmakers aren't doing enough to change. Automakers say consumers
should decide the best fuel-efficient vehicles that meet their
needs.
<p>
   ``Regulation can divert an automaker's resources from fully
exploring the range of technologies,'' Smith said.
<p>
   The vehicle that uses the gas turbine engine, electric motor and
battery pack generates virtually no pollution and could come to
market in four years, the company said.
<p>
   GM showed a sports car that uses and electric motor and a
turbo-charged diesel engine. It gets 80 miles a gallon, about four
times the average of today's cars, and accelerates from a stop to
60 miles per hour in seven seconds.
<p>
   Fuel-cell technology shows the best chance for meeting
environmental and customer needs, the company said. Fuel cells mix
hydrogen and oxygen to create the electrical energy that powers the
car.
<p>
   The company also showed a car fueled by compressed natural gas,
as well as its EV1 electric car that uses new nickel-metal hydride
batteries to nearly double its range to 160 miles between charges.
GM began offering the EV1, the first all-new electric car ever
offered for sale to retail customers, in California and Arizona in
1996. Demand has been light for the vehicle.

<p>
   The most significant revolution in television since the medium's
creation starts this summer, when the networks begin commercial
broadcasts of digital, high-definition television and retailers
begin selling the new wide-screen sets.
<p>
   As former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt
put it last year, the transition to digital television ``is a far
more exciting and perplexing event than any in the history of
television since the invention of analog TV a few years before I
was born.''
<p>
   Later this month, almost all the world's television
manufacturers will put their first high-definition sets on display,
at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. These early models
will be big  &MD;  and expensive. The screens will be 35 inches or
larger, and the least expensive of the sets is likely to cost
almost $3,000; most will cost far more, though manufacturers
promise that prices will fall quickly in succeeding years.
<p>
   The digital televisions are the product of more than 10 years of
complex engineering work costing close to $1 billion and even more
years of tortured political drama. But one large question, perhaps
the most important of them all, remains unanswered: Will anyone
really want these new sets?
<p>
   Dozens of consultants' reports and just as many opinion surveys
have offered every possible view on this question, most of them
reflecting the political positions of the sponsors. The most
optimistic of the surveys, conducted by Northwestern University on
behalf of the consumer electronics industry last year, found that
random consumers who were given an HDTV demonstration reacted
favorably and said they would be, on average, willing to pay about
$1,200 extra  &MD;  above the cost of a comparable conventional
television  &MD;  to buy one.
<p>
   More recently, a study by the consulting wing of SRI
International conducted for 70 telecommunications companies late
last year concluded that most consumers would choose to buy a
converter box that enabled them to receive the separate digital
channels on their existing sets, rather than a digital HDTV,
because of ``the high cost of digital TV sets.''
<p>
   But buyers interested in converter boxes will find several rude
surprises. First, the boxes themselves will be expensive, ranging
in price from $400 to $800, according to most manufacturers'
estimates. That is more than the average price of a new set today.
<p>
   Because much of the digital programming will be broadcast in a
wide-screen format, when it is converted to standard resolution for
display on a conventional set it will be ``letter boxed''  &MD;  meaning
that the reduced-size picture will be sandwiched between broad
black bars at the top and the bottom of the screen. And while the
boxes will translate the digital signal, the programming will not
be in high definition.
<p>
   How quickly consumers will accept the new high-definition
televisions is unknowable. Pessimists point out that even 13 years
after color televisions went on sale in 1953, only 10 percent of
American homes had them. The transition was so slow, however,
largely because interindustry squabbles meant that for nearly 10
years, only one manufacturer, RCA, was selling color sets, and only
one network, NBC, was broadcasting color programming. When the rest
of the industry jumped into the market, prices dropped and set
sales took off.
<p>
   By contrast, though there have been plenty of disputes in the
industry during the development of digital television, every
television manufacturer will be aggressively marketing HDTVs. All
the major television networks will offer at least some
high-definition programming. And consumers will realize, if they
don't already, that sooner or later they will have to buy a digital
TV, or a converter box, because conventional, analog broadcasting
will end at some point within the next decade.
<p>
   That should make this transition quite different from the
change-over to color television.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But the skeptics also point out that in Japan  &MD;  where
high-definition programming and televisions have been available for
almost a decade  &MD;  only a few hundred thousand people have bought
the sets.
<p>
   The Japanese sets are analog, however, and the companies making
them never lowered the prices to reasonable levels; at first they
cost as much as a small car. At the same time, NHK, the public
television network  &MD;  the only network to offer high-definition
broadcasting  &MD;  was never able to offer popular programming on its
high-definition channel; the shows were not produced in high
definition.
<p>
   Then, in 1990, shortly after the high-definition service had
begun, an American company, General Instrument Corp., invented
digital high-definition television, immediately making Japan's
analog system a technological laggard  &MD;  certainly an incentive for
some prospective buyers to wait for new digital models.
<p>
   In the United States, manufacturers know that digital
televisions will not become mass-market items until prices fall to
levels that consumers consider reasonable. But what price is
reasonable?
<p>
   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association points out
that nearly 20 million households already own a television set
costing at least $2,000. About 40 percent of those buyers are
households with annual incomes no higher than $20,000  &MD;  suggesting
that many Americans are willing to borrow money to buy the
television they want.
<p>
   Still, not even the greatest enthusiasts think anyone but the
classic ``early adopter''  &MD;  someone who wants the newest, latest
thing, no matter what  &MD;  is likely to buy the expensive,
first-generation products that go on sale later this year. And only
the early adopters who live in big cities will have the
opportunity.
<p>
   Under an agreement with the government, none of the nation's
broadcasters are required to begin digital broadcasting until April
1999. But some programming will start in the summer, and the
networks made a nonbinding promise to have 26 network-owned
stations in the 10 largest cities on the air with digital
programming starting next fall  &MD;  specifically so buyers eyeing the
first HDTVs during the Christmas shopping season will have some
programming to watch.
<p>
   For buyers of the first sets, the only sure way to receive an
HDTV signal is with an over-the-air television antenna. The cable
television industry is at best ambivalent about high-definition
television. HBO, the Discovery Channel, the Madison Square Garden
network and Ted Turner's cable stations all have promised to
transmit high-definition programming. But so far, none of the
nation's major cable operators have publicly promised to carry it.
<p>
   The nation's 6 million direct-broadcast satellite customers will
find little, if any, high-definition programming available by
satellite. That is largely because satellite broadcasters would
have to knock four or five conventional channels off the air to
offer one HDTV program.
<p>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to take the bandwidth we have and
pour it into high-definition for the sake of somebody who's got a
$5,000 high-end monitor sitting in a lab someplace,'' argued Edward
W. Hartenstein, president of DirecTV, the nation's largest
satellite service.
<p>
   Only Echostar, the smallest satellite company, with about a
million subscribers, is promising to offer some high-definition
programming later this year. ``But high-definition will primarily
be for big events  &MD;  the Super Bowl, the Olympics and some
pay-per-view events,'' said Mark Jackson, director of engineering
for Echostar.

<p>
   Looking back over a year in which many high-profile executives
abruptly left their jobs, one question seems hard to shake: Can't
anybody play this game?
<p>
   Often, the answer seems to have been a resounding ``no,'' even
though some executives have been amply rewarded for playing it
badly.
<p>
   Consider some of the departures that received the most attention
in 1997:
<p>
   Barely nine months after John R. Walter was recruited to lead
AT&AMP;T, board members pushed him out of his job as president in July
after losing faith in him. Walter Y. Elisha, an AT&AMP;T director, made
the remarkably blunt comment to reporters that Walter ``lacked the
intellectual leadership to lead AT&AMP;T.'' Walter left with a
severance package of $26 million.
<p>
   Also in July, the board of Apple Computer Inc. ousted chairman
and chief executive Gilbert F. Amelio after a year and half in
which he failed to turn around the troubled company. For ending his
contract early, the board paid Amelio $9.2 million.
<p>
   In October, Waste Management Inc. chairman and chief executive
Ronald T. LeMay quit after only four months to return to his old
job as president of Sprint Corp.
<p>
   There were other departures of top executives, too, though these
were somewhat less surprising.
<p>
   The board of Delta Air Lines decided not to renew the contract
of Ronald W. Allen, chairman, chief executive and president, and
gave him a $4.5 million severance package. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp. chairman Richard Scott resigned amid a criminal investigation
of whether the company broke the law in its pursuit of profits, and
was given almost $10 million in severance. William D. Smithburg
left Quaker Oats Co. after the company's disastrous handling of its
Snapple brand  &MD;  nearly $2 million of its investment in Snapple was
wiped out every day until it sold the division in March for a
fire-sale price  &MD;  and received severance pay of $875,000.
<p>
   In all, the last year left a distinct impression of executives
and directors who made rather obvious blunders, and were often
richly compensated for their missteps.
<p>
   For example, by many accounts, Walter, who was new to the
telecommunications industry, did not immerse himself in the
mechanics of the business, and even waited months to pay a call on
the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
<p>
   The AT&AMP;T board also allowed  &MD;  mistakenly, in the eyes of many  &MD; 
chairman Robert E. Allen to continue wielding influence after
Walter was brought in to succeed him.
<p>
   When Walter disagreed with Allen on key policy issues, Allen
found more support among his longtime allies on the board. By
contrast, former Hughes Electronics chairman C. Michael Armstrong,
who was chosen to run AT&AMP;T in the wake of Walter's ouster, made
Allen's departure a condition of employment.
<p>
   The Apple board gave Amelio a package that made it attractive
for him to leave or stay, and financially rewarding whether he
succeeded or failed. The board has also created something of a
revolving-door management style that grows more expensive with each
turn. When John Sculley left in 1994, he received $3 million. His
replacement, Michael Spindler, received between $3 million and $4
million when he left.
<p>
   And in LeMay's case, he apparently found something on closer
inspection of Waste Management that made him doubt his ability to
turn the company around. Evidently the board did not communicate
clearly enough to LeMay the challenges he would face, or he did not
look closely enough before agreeing to take the job.
<p>
   The broader problem, according to experts in corporate
governance, is partly that the hero worship of chief executives is
so pervasive that many of them do not feel a need to do the kind of
homework and build the kind of alliances with board members that
the job requires.
<p>
   Directors also often consider the management skills of newly
recruited executives easily transferable among different
industries, and have high expectations that leave little room for
coaching relationships with their new hires.
<p>
   The costs of misguided maneuvers on the part of boards and chief
executives can be high. There is the cost of the severance packages
themselves, which executives can demand when they are hired, in a
tight market for talented leaders. Boards also grant rich severance
packages to help assuage the guilt they feel in making a bad
decision in the first place.
<p>
   The richest pay package to buy out a contract last year was
granted to someone who was not even being dismissed. Occidental
Petroleum Corp. chairman Ray R. Irani was given $95 million by his
board to buy out a strikingly lavish contract with one that put
more pay at risk.
<p>
   In his original contract, Irani was given $1.9 million in annual
salary, guaranteed stock options, restricted stock and bonuses. The
contract was also automatically renewed daily for a seven-year
term. The new contract lowered his salary, gave the board
discretion over bonuses and removed the automatic renewal
provision. In announcing the change, the board said that buying out
the old contract would ``extinguish significant existing
liabilities.''
<p>
   The transition to a new leader can add other expenses. There is
the cost of a signing bonus and there are relocation costs.
Typically, there is also a trickle-down effect from dismissing the
chief executive. After Leo F. Mullin was brought in to run Delta,
for instance, he dismissed chief executive Thomas J. Roeck, saying
he was not right for his team.
<p>
   Dismissing the chief executive is not a bad idea in all cases.
After all, people sometimes do not do their jobs as well as
expected. And, experts say, boards in general are at least
displaying greater unity than they were earlier in the decade, when
problems at companies like General Motors, Sears and Kmart were
allowed to drag on for years before the boards acted.
<p>
   But more often the dismissal of the chief executive, and the
attendant publicity about rich severance packages, obscures what
may be the real problem, said Nell Minow, a principal of Lens Inc.,
a Washington-based investment group that is active in shareholder
issues.
<p>
   ``If things got so bad that they had to fire the CEO,'' she
said, ``then the board needs to do an immediate self-assessment to
figure out where they went wrong and what they need to do to make
sure it doesn't happen again.''

 &UR; IS TOKYO READY, OR WILLING, TO LEAD A RESTRUCTURING OF
INDUSTRIES? &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   TOKYO  &MD;  A decade from now, 1998 may be remembered as the Year of
Reckoning for Japan.
<p>
   The financial markets, empowered by the global movement of
money, finally seem to have triumphed in their age-old battle with
the Japanese bureaucracy and are moving much faster than the
authorities to force bitter but much-needed medicine down the
throat of the ailing Japanese economy.
<p>
   ``The financial markets have upped the ante, and the bureaucrats
are being forced to bend to the pressure,'' said Andrew Shipley, an
economist at Schroders Japan Ltd.
<p>
   So it seems. In the closing weeks of last year, in an effort to
regain credibility, the Japanese government committed itself to
spending more than 20 trillion yen, or about $150 billion, to
establish safety nets for the debt-ridden financial system and the
small- and mid-sized companies that can no longer get loans from
it. The government also moved forward with an economic stimulus
plan worth nearly $40 billion.
<p>
   In short, Japan did many of the things its critics, including
the U.S. Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund,
had been nagging it to do  &MD;  yet to little avail. Investors have
remained skeptical, and private economists are stubbornly sticking
to their prediction that gross domestic product will be flat this
year or up only a few tenths of a percentage point.
<p>
   So what can Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government do?
Experts now say that it must lead a broad restructuring of
industry.
<p>
   The government spent the last seven years staving off the
inevitable retrenchment that logically should have followed the
collapse of the ``bubble'' economy. It shelled out 70 trillion yen,
or more than $500 billion, for sometimes unnecessary bridges and
tunnels and highways to keep employment chugging along. It kept
interest rates at the lowest levels in the world and, since 1995,
allowed the yen to fall against the dollar, which has made Japanese
goods more competitive internationally.
<p>
   ``In any other country, if you depreciated the currency by
almost 60 percent, allowed public-sector spending to go bananas and
drove interest rates to rock bottom, you would expect the economy
not just to recover but to explode,'' said Alexander Kinmont, a
managing director at Morgan Stanley. ``It hasn't, and the
government can now do very little. You basically have to
restructure corporate Japan.''
<p>
   Restructuring is painful in any country. In the United States,
which bit this bullet several years ago, there were plenty of
reports about laid-off engineers working at Wal-Mart and headlines
about endless rounds of job cuts at major corporations as companies
wielded hatchets to cut costs. Now Europe is going through some of
the same trauma, creating some hope that it, too, will soon enter a
period of economic prosperity like the one the United States has
recently enjoyed.
<p>
   But the notion of widespread, wrenching dislocation is still
unthinkable to most Japanese people. When Yamaichi Securities Co.
collapsed in November, its president wept in front of television
cameras as he spoke of the 7,500 workers who would be out on the
streets.
<p>
   In the United States, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate would be
greeted with cheers. In Japan, it is cause for consternation, as it
is the highest level since 1953, when the government started
compiling statistics.
<p>
   Jesper Koll, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo,
estimates that 10 percent of the workers in the securities industry
alone lost their jobs in 1997, thanks to failures like that of
Yamaichi.
<p>
   Some private economists expect the overall unemployment rate to
increase to at least 4.5 percent in 1998, as the credit crunch,
brought on by banks struggling to bring their capital ratios up to
international standards, tips more companies into bankruptcy and
forces more mergers.
<p>
   The banks recently won a reprieve when the government said it
would not immediately press them to meet the higher standards, but
the ``big bang'' deregulation of the financial services industry,
which is expected to create more competition and greater openness
for foreign firms, is still expected to get under way in earnest
this year.
<p>
   ``What's good for Japan long-term would almost certainly lead to
painful short-term restructuring like we saw in the United
States,'' said Shipley of Schroders Japan. ``The longer they wait,
the more painful it's going to be.''

<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand  &MD;  In a new ritual of Thailand's hard times,
people who call themselves the ``formerly rich'' have been
gathering every weekend in a carnival atmosphere to sell their
status symbols: expensive cars, designer clothing, thousand-dollar
watches, even a light airplane.
<p>
   One week, a former employee of a closed finance company hung a
``for sale'' sign around his own neck, advertising his availability
for work.
<p>
   This curious spectacle, held in a parking garage in downtown
Bangkok, may be an early sign of recovery: Thailand is emerging
from a crippling stage of national denial.
<p>
   In recent weeks, the other hardest-hit nations of Southeast Asia
have also begun to grapple with the downturn that over the last six
months ended a decade of sky-high growth.
<p>
   Indonesia and Malaysia have taken their first sips of the bitter
medicine of economic retrenchment, scaling back their growth plans,
halting expensive building projects and announcing austerity
measures.
<p>
   That is the good news. The bad news, analysts say, is that
recovery will take time, will cause both economic pain and social
disruptions and will call for still-untested political will among
the region's leaders.
<p>
   This year ``is going to be pretty ugly,'' said Stephen Taran,
the managing director of Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, voicing the
nearly unanimous view of economic and political analysts.
<p>
   ``They're dealing with a crushing burden of currency
depreciation,'' he said. ``They're looking at a much sharper
deceleration of growth than was previously expected.''
<p>
   In a December report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said Thailand  &MD;  perhaps the champion of Southeast
Asia's decade of rapid growth and the epicenter of its crash  &MD; 
could well slip into recession in 1998. Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines will also take years to recover their economic health,
it said.
<p>
   But by 1999, the report said, growth should begin to pick up,
mainly as a result of these same drops in the value of their
currencies, which will make their exports cheaper and more
competitive. And, of course, many of the things that fueled Asia's
economic boom in the first place  &MD;  well-educated and motivated work
forces, for example  &MD;  remain in place, providing some optimism for
the future.
<p>
   But in the nearer term, there will be pain. In a separate
report, the International Monetary Fund  &MD;  which has organized
multibillion-dollar bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea  &MD;  cut its combined growth forecast for Southeast Asia to just
1.7 percent for 1998.
<p>
   That figure marks a stunning fall for a region that over the
last decade was the fastest-growing in the world, with an annual
rate of close to 8 percent.
<p>
   The boom transformed the lives of tens of millions of people,
creating modern new city centers, fueling the growth of new
industries and giving birth to an affluent and expanding middle
class.
<p>
   But it also fostered a proliferation of poorly run financial
institutions, a rash of ill-conceived real estate and industrial
ventures and a culture of corruption in which huge sums of money
flowed like underground rivers among politicians and their friends.
<p>
   ``When economic conditions remain generally good and when
private foreign capital is flowing at a record pace and on very
attractive terms, it is easy to believe that the good times will
continue,'' the IMF said in its report.
<p>
   In July, under intense pressure from currency traders, Thailand
loosened controls on its currency, the baht, setting off a chain
reaction of devaluations throughout the region.
<p>
   ``It's been quite shocking to see the situation deteriorate to
the extent that it has,'' said Leslie Richardson, the managing
director of the Asian Equities Division for SocGen-Crosby
Securities in New York. ``It has been one of those vicious cycles
where doubts about the currency in one country lead to doubts in
another country.''
<p>
   The fall of the dominoes has been all the more striking because
of the sharp differences among the affected countries.
<p>
   Thailand had benefited the most from foreign investment as Japan
and other nations sought cheap labor for their industries. Thailand
had also extended itself the most with foreign borrowing and easy
credit, making it highly vulnerable when its bubble burst. It was
also the nation with the weakest and least capable leadership,
which allowed its problems to grow rapidly.
<p>
   But this picture changed markedly last fall when a new prime
minister, Chuan Leekpai, took office and undertook a tough economic
reform program. One foreign businessman now calls himself ``a
guarded and perhaps naive optimist on Thailand''  &MD;  which is a great
change from the tone of a few months earlier.
<p>
   Malaysia, which at first set the standard for denial, now seems
to have acknowledged its problems, paring down its growth forecasts
and putting a hold on several building projects.
<p>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who at first blamed a colorful
variety of foreign enemies for Malaysia's problems, has suddenly
become his nation's chief cheerleader for austerity.
<p>
   ``If we are prepared to make sacrifices now, God willing, our
nation's economy will recover within a short span of time,'' he
said in December. ``If we are to start accusing others, then we
will have disagreements, and this will indirectly make us weak.''
<p>
   Economists say that with this attitude, his nation may be in a
better position to recover than Thailand or Indonesia because
Malaysia's banks are mostly healthy and its businesses and
financial institutions never accumulated the huge foreign debts of
these neighbors.
<p>
   Indonesia impressed analysts by its quick move in October to
call for help from the IMF, which stepped in to provide the major
part of a $40 billion international aid package.
<p>
   But there are serious questions about the firmness of
Indonesia's commitment to deep-running reforms that would
necessarily cut into the holdings of the family and friends of
President Suharto.
<p>
   Indonesian recovery is also the most dependent on political
factors. New concerns have arisen about the health of the country's
long-serving president, just a few months before he is to be
endorsed by Parliament for a seventh five-year term.
<p>
   The Philippines, which never quite managed to join in on the
region's boom, has remained comparatively isolated from the
region's crash. Its currency and stock markets have slumped, but to
a lesser degree than those of its neighbors, and its more modest
growth has slowed. Analysts say the country, which suffered for
decades under the label ``sick man of Asia,'' could be one of the
first to recover from the region's ailments.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil  &MD;  To foreign investors, Brazil's
president became a hero in 1997 when he responded to market
turbulence by taking painful measures to bolster the nation's
fiscal soundness and to stave off a collapse of the currency.
<p>
   But the same steps that were cheered overseas are expected to
boomerang against him at home. High interest rates have slowed the
prospect of economic growth, and lagging demand is forcing some
manufacturers to consider big layoffs, especially in the automobile
and appliance industries.
<p>
   ``We're avoiding the word `recession' like the plague, but
that's what it is,'' said one consultant, who refused to be
identified. ``It's horrible.''
<p>
   While the economies of Argentina and Mexico are expected to grow
strongly in 1998, Brazil has been jolted by ripple effects from the
financial trouble in Asia, lowering expectations for South
America's biggest market, with 160 million people.
<p>
   In recent months, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is
expected to seek re-election in October, seized the sense of
looming crisis brought on by turbulence in Asia to push through
long-delayed reforms in the civil service and social security
systems.
<p>
   He also persuaded Congress to approve a package to increase
government revenues by $15 billion through a 10 percent income tax
increase, new excise taxes on beverages and vehicles and an end to
tax breaks in the Manaus industrial area, where televisions,
stereos and video cassette recorders are manufactured. He raised
central bank lending rates sharply, so far bringing them down only
gradually.
<p>
   As a result, after years of an expanding consumer market, during
which easy credit and the end of hyperinflation allowed low-wage
earners to buy refrigerators, washers, stereos and televisions for
the first time, companies are seeing demand dry up amid a
widespread fear of unemployment.
<p>
   Appliance sales, which grew by about 30 percent a year in 1995
and 1996, dropped last year by 10 percent. In November alone, sales
were 41 percent lower than in November 1996.
<p>
   Volkswagen, which opened a new bus and truck factory outside Rio
in 1997, is now talking about laying off 3,000 workers. Honda
Motor, which opened a car factory in Sumare two months ago, is
putting some 370 workers on forced leave.
<p>
   For the first time ever, the Union Force, which represents some
130,000 auto parts workers, accepted temporary cuts in salary and
hours to protect 8,000 jobs. Luis Antonio Medeiros, president of
the union, said he had agreed to the accord ``to allow the
companies to reduce their costs while the government makes some
economic adjustments.''
<p>
   Now, many other unions are being asked to make similar
sacrifices because of lagging demand, manufacturers' overstock or
restructuring
<p>
   In addition, unless interest rates come down soon, small and
medium-size businesses without ready access to foreign capital will
come under severe strains.
<p>
   Amaury de Souza, a political scientist at the Institute for the
Development of Economic and Social Studies, said the economy had
been growing at only mediocre rates in recent years, unable to
create the jobs for 1.5 million people entering the work force each
year.
<p>
   Officially, unemployment stands at 5.7 percent, with the
government predicting that it will increase to 8 percent to 10
percent. But one respected research institute in Sao Paulo that
includes discouraged workers in its survey of unemployment says the
jobless rate in the Sao Paulo region is 16.6 percent and will
likely rise to 20 percent.
<p>
   Just six months ago, predictions were for the economy to grow by
4 percent to 5 percent in 1998. Now, de Souza expects that growth
will barely reach 1 percent. Government predictions are for 1.5
percent to 2.5 percent, distributed unevenly through various
sectors.
<p>
   While the stock market has been volatile in response to the
problems in Asia, it still rose smartly for all of last year.
Barring the spread of the Asian crisis, the Brazilian market is
expected to continue to stabilize in 1998. The government also
managed to support the currency, the real, whose value is linked to
the dollar.
<p>
   In addition, direct foreign investment in factories,
infrastructure projects and privatization of government-owned
industries like telecommunications is expected to remain strong,
with some Brazilian economists urging the government to accelerate
the sale of its holdings to raise revenues.
<p>
   Roberto Campos, a congressman and former planning minister,
estimates that the government could raise more than $6 billion by
speeding up the planned sales of Telebras, the telephone holding
company, and Furnas, an electricity distribution company covering
the lucrative markets of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de
Janeiro. He would also sell off BR Distributing Co., a
government-owned petroleum distributor that is not now up for sale.
<p>
   The sales would significantly lift government revenue and
``would have no cooling effect on the economy,'' Campos said.

<p>
   The next few months may well decide the financial and legal
future of the tobacco industry.
<p>
   Congress is expected to begin deliberations in January on a
proposed $368.5 billion settlement reached last June between five
major tobacco producers and state attorneys general.
<p>
   While the debate will surely last for months, most analysts and
industry officials agree that if legislation is not passed by June
resolving a thicket of legal and regulatory issues involving
tobacco, momentum for a proposal will die as the fall political
campaign season approaches.
<p>
   In proposing the settlement, the tobacco companies are hoping to
buy legal peace from a growing number of lawsuits. But the price
they may eventually have to pay is by no means certain, and the
coming congressional debate will be the ultimate test of the
industry's remaining political strength.
<p>
   The proposed accord calls for broad changes in the way cigarette
companies do business. Among other things, producers agreed to
restrict marketing by eliminating billboards, to drop promotional
images like the Marlboro Man, to end sports sponsorships and to
limit magazine advertising to publications aimed at adults.
<p>
   The producers, which include Philip Morris Cos., the industry
giant, also agreed to pay substantial fines if tobacco use by
minors does not decline. And they agreed to allow the government
regulatory authority over tobacco and nicotine.
<p>
   In return, the companies would receive protection against most
cigarette-related lawsuits and would be shielded against punitive
damages.
<p>
   Many public health groups and President Clinton have already
rejected the June agreement as too favorable to the industry. And
while no one expects the agreement to become law, the battle lines
have formed over the extent to which it should be reshaped as it
moves through Congress.
<p>
   Tobacco producers have mounted a lobbying campaign of huge
proportion, spending more than $30 million to hire such influential
figures as George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader. But
some public health groups, state attorneys general and plaintiffs'
lawyers, who support the settlement agreement, have also hired
lobbyists, as have those seeking to extract greater concessions
from the industry.
<p>
   Along with Philip Morris, the companies involved in the June
plan include RJR Nabisco Holdings, the parent of R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco; B.A.T. Industries PLC, the parent company of Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco; Loews Corp., the parent of Lorillard Tobacco;
and UST Inc., a producer of smokeless tobacco.
<p>
   Major disputes are likely to continue to erupt over such issues
as how much cigarette prices should be raised to deter youth
smoking. In addition, the White House has said that it will not
back legislation to restrict government authority over nicotine.
Tobacco farmers, who were not included in the June proposal, are
also lobbying for compensation under any legislative plan.
<p>
   Before the legislative debate begins, however, the tobacco
industry must face two significant hurdles: state lawsuits that are
scheduled to begin this month in Texas and Minnesota.
<p>
   Many Wall Street analysts believe that tobacco company share
prices will climb if the industry settles the state cases and gets
the congressional legislation it wants.
<p>
   Resolution of the companies' legal plight may also set off
changes. Many analysts believe, for example, that RJR Nabisco will
spin off its cigarette subsidiary, R.J. Reynolds, and emerge as a
food company.

 &UR; IMF'S MUSSA SAYS ASIA'S PROBLEMS WILL LEAD TO `DISINFLATION' &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

 &UR; c.1998 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Asia's economic woes can be
expected to have a ``disinflationary effect'' on U.S. and world
prices, said Michael Mussa, director of research at the
International Monetary Fund.
<p>
   Mussa said that although inflation could be restrained as a
result of the ongoing economic difficulties in some Asian
countries, he doesn't expect a bout of deflation. ``I'm not
expecting a general decline in prices,'' he said, speaking to
reporters after a session at the American Economic Association's
annual conference.
<p>
   The U.S. economy will expand at a less rapid pace next near,
Mussa said, echoing the IMF's forecast of 2.4 percent growth next
year, down from about 3.5 percent this year. ``Undoubtedly, the
slowdown in Asia will have a negative impact on U.S. export
growth,'' Mussa said.
<p>
   Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested the
next battle for U.S. central bankers may be to combat the effects
of falling prices -- a signal that the Fed's next move could be to
cut borrowing costs.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider
at what point effective price stability has been reached,''
Greenspan said in a speech to the AEA meeting. ``Indeed, some
observers have begun to question whether deflation is now a
possibility, and to assess the potential difficulties such a
development might pose for the economy.''
<p>
   Mussa said he didn't think Greenspan was saying deflation is an
immediate worry. ``I've not heard the chairman express concern
about deflation.'' Instead, Greenspan said prices are falling in
some industries, Mussa said. ``That's deflation on a sectoral
level.''
<p>
   The last time the U.S. consumer price index declined year to
year was in the early 1950s, during the Korean War, Mussa said.
<p>
   At the same time, Mussa also repeated the view expressed in the
IMF's most recent economic outlook for the U.S. that there's little
risk of an inflationary surge in the U.S. ``There's no reason to
believe that inflation will jump out of the closet,'' he said.
<p>
   Separately, in his remarks to the AEA conference, Mussa said the
U.S. dollar probably will decline against the currencies of Europe
and Japan as the economies of the major industrialized nations move
into synch.
<p>
   ``It is reasonable to expect over the next three to four years
that we will see the now-quite strong dollar move to a somewhat
weaker position versus the euro and versus the Japanese yen,''
Mussa said.
<p>
   That won't ``be a consequence particularly of the formation'' of
a common European currency, he said. Rather it will result from the
expected strengthening of those economies relative to the U.S.
<p>
   Still, exchange rates overall shouldn't become more volatile as
a result of European Monetary Union, he said. ``I see no particular
reason to believe that the degree of exchange rate volatility
between the dollar and the euro or the yen and the euro will be
substantially different from that which we've seen in the past 24
years,'' Mussa said.
<p>
   One desirable side effect of monetary union will be the ``very
rapid'' development of ``deeper'' and more efficient financial
markets in Europe, Mussa said.
<p>
   In comments to reporters yesterday, Mussa said the Asian
financial turmoil ``hasn't settled down as one might've hoped.''
Specifically, he noted, ``the markets keep bouncing around, but
fortunately they bounce up now as well as down.''
<p>
   Still, looking at past crises -- such as the collapse of
Mexico's peso in 1994-95 -- it's clear that it takes time for such
problems to abate, Mussa said.
<p>
   Financial markets ``tend to be volatile for a while -- sort of
like an earthquake -- and then there are aftershocks and it takes a
while for things to settle,'' Mussa explained. ``Hopefully, we will
now in the initial weeks of this year begin to see some evidence
that the amplitude of these fluctuations will be coming down.''
<p>
   Last month, the IMF, along with the U.S., Japan and 11 other
nations, said they would accelerate $10 billion in new loans to
South Korea in an effort to encourage foreign banks to roll over
their loans to Korean borrowers.
<p>
   The IMF provided South Korea with $2 billion on Dec. 30 --an
added disbursement that came a week ahead of the scheduled release
of its next installment of aid. The U.S., Japan, France and other
members of the Group of Seven industrialized nations will provide
$8 billion in loans this month, the South Korean Ministry of
Finance announced Christmas Day.

<p>
   Case 1: The economy continues to expand briskly in 1998. The
unemployment rate remains low, and employers have to raise wages to
attract the workers they need to keep up with demand.
<p>
   To maintain profit margins, companies start pushing prices
higher, and before long inflation again becomes a threat to
destabilize a business expansion that is nearly seven years old.
<p>
   Case 2: Asia's economic woes continue. Manufacturers in
countries like Thailand and South Korea flood the market with goods
made cheap by their devalued currencies.
<p>
   Jolted by competition from abroad, U.S. manufacturers cut
prices. Financial markets tumble, and the economy grinds to a halt.
Soon the big threat is from a decline in the general price level  &MD; 
deflation  &MD;  a phenomenon the United States has not experienced
since the 1930s.
<p>
   What's a Federal Reserve chairman to do? Faced with such
divergent possibilities, Alan Greenspan, who has led the Fed for
more than 10 years, has chosen to sit tight for now, keeping
interest rates steady through the turmoil of the last several
months. And while Greenspan generally has been extremely vigilant
about the possibility of inflation, lately he has been talking more
about the possibility of deflation.
<p>
   The complexity of the situation has made predicting Fed policy
even more treacherous than usual. Economists are increasingly
divided over whether the next move in interest rates should be up,
to choke off inflation, or down, to head off a slowdown in growth
and avert any risk of deflation.
<p>
   ``Expect Fed thinking to evolve further in coming months,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, who has been
sounding an alarm about deflation. ``If U.S. growth slows in early
1998 and further signs of deflation emerge, as we expect, we
believe that the Fed will eventually decide to ease monetary
policy.''
<p>
   But others think Asia's problems will not dampen U.S. economic
activity enough to eliminate the inflation threat.
<p>
   ``The U.S. economy has significant momentum, and its labor
markets are very tight,'' Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. told its clients in
a recent report. ``Thus, both short- and long-term rates still
appear poised to head higher, even though the magnitude of the rise
in 1998 is likely to be more muted than we previously had
anticipated.''
<p>
   Greenspan proved willing in 1997 to keep the Fed on the
sidelines  &MD;  its only change in interest rates came in March, a
quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate  &MD;  despite a sharp
drop in unemployment and robust economic growth rates.
<p>
   Indeed, Greenspan all but repudiated the traditional framework
economists use to judge the risks of inflation, acknowledging the
argument that the economy is changing so rapidly that policy makers
can no longer rely on some of the old rules.
<p>
   The Fed's new pragmatic approach is likely to be on full display
this year. Greenspan continues to dominate policy-setting sessions
and has been challenged only occasionally by the hard-line
inflation fighters within the Fed system.
<p>
   Even those who continue to believe that low unemployment
combined with strong growth will inexorably lead to inflationary
pressures  &MD;  Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, is foremost among
them  &MD;  have been content to wait for more early warning signs of
inflation.
<p>
   And pressure from outside the Fed not to raise rates has grown
steadily, with politicians, manufacturers and many economists
saying the central bank should give the economy freer rein to
grow.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Telephone companies, regional banks, Wall Street firms, hotels
and casinos, oil and gas ventures, radio and television stations  &MD; 
the list is almost endless as a growing procession of industries is
caught up in the enthusiasm for takeovers.
<p>
   After yet another record year for mergers and acquisitions, the
trend shows little sign of abating, experts on Wall Street say.
With just the deals that are now in the pipeline, they say, 1998
will be another very active year for the merger mavens,
particularly those who specialize in telecommunications, financial,
high-technology and health care companies.
<p>
   The total value of mergers and acquisitions announced in the
United States last year was $919 billion, according to Securities
Data Co., a New Jersey statistical concern.
<p>
   Thanks to such huge deals as Worldcom's $36.5 billion offer to
acquire MCI Communications Corp., that 1997 total represents a
staggering increase of nearly 50 percent from 1996 merger volume of
$626 billion, which was itself a record.
<p>
   ``Many of the factors at work in the past year appear to be
continuing,'' said Kendrick Wilson, a vice chairman at Lazard
Freres &AMP; Co. who specializes in advising financial companies on
mergers.
<p>
   Wilson said in an interview that he expected the ferocious pace
of merger business to continue, driven by ``high stock valuations,
the continuing struggle for revenue growth, the need for
technology, pressures on expenses and the pressure of institutional
investors who are very short-term and performance-oriented.''
<p>
   Takeovers are generally the fastest way for company management
to build revenue and profits, particularly at a time when it is
easy to issue new stock.
<p>
   Some specialists sound a cautionary note, however.
<p>
   ``The merger business has always been a cyclical business,''
said Robert Kindler, a partner who specializes in mergers at the
law firm of Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore, ``and anyone who predicts with
any confidence that the merger business will continue this strong
indefinitely is going to be wrong.''
<p>
   The caveat, as at this time last year, is that any serious
threat to the stock market could dampen the merger mania of
America's boardrooms, which often rely on high-priced stock to
finance takeovers.
<p>
   The merger boom is also altering  &MD;  some critics would say
weakening  &MD;  the capital structure of many big companies as they
issue new stock or take on added debt to pay for the deals. Such
financing can dilute earnings per share and can lower the value of
shares outright.
<p>
   ``A lot of these companies that have grown fast by acquisition
may find that their currency is not as valuable as it once was,''
Kindler said.
<p>
   Those are problems for the future, however. For the moment, Wall
Street is enjoying record profits, not least because of the growing
merger business. Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.  &MD; 
itself the product of a merger last year  &MD;  led the field of
investment banks advising on mergers in 1997. Through Dec. 19, it
had worked on 282 transactions around the world, valued at $322.5
billion.
<p>
   The boom has also provided rich pickings for Wall Street's law
firms. Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett led the field in 1997, according
to Securities Data, advising on 23 percent of mergers and
acquisitions in the United States.
<p>
   The fees generated by the merger business are among the fattest
on Wall Street and have contributed to the billions of dollars in
bonuses at brokerage firms this year. So it is perhaps not
surprising that with the merger boom continuing, Wall Street firms
are being sought not only for their advice but also as acquisition
targets.
<p>
   Several of the biggest deals of 1997 involved Wall Street firms,
including Dean Witter, Discover's $10.2 billion acquisition of
Morgan Stanley in February. In September, the Travelers Group,
which already owned Smith Barney, doubled its Wall Street presence
by agreeing to buy Salomon Inc.
<p>
   Those deals were accompanied by a string of smaller ones as
banks, including Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, Nationsbank and
others, snapped up brokerage firms, particularly those that
specialize in newer growth industries such as health care and high
technology.
<p>
   Brokerage firms have also shown themselves to be eager to
acquire money management firms, in part because this can help make
their earnings more consistent, improving the value of their stocks
in the eyes of investment analysts.
<p>
   Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. have all
moved aggressively into this business. In the biggest such
transaction to date, Merrill Lynch agreed in November to pay more
than $5 billion to acquire Mercury Asset Management PLC of London.
<p>
   ``It seems that current trends remain in place, whether in the
brokerage or consumer-finance sector,'' said Leslie Nelkin,
managing director of Furman Selz LLC. ``Companies are seeing
benefits in scale and the need to offer a panoply of products, and
that's leading to consolidation.''
<p>
   ``The only thing that could stop it,'' he added, ``would be
serious concerns about the financial markets, and that does not
seem to be happening.''
<p>
   While the interest in Wall Street firms and other financial
companies accelerated last year, the busiest area for mergers and
acquisitions remained telecommunications. There was more than $90
billion of merger volume in telecommunications, or about 10 percent
of the total, according to Securities Data. Still, that was below
the level of 1996, when deals in this field topped $100 billion in
value.
<p>
   The wave of mergers and acquisitions spread through most
industries, with banking and hotels and casinos among the busiest.
Particularly in banking, acquirers were helped by the stock
market's vigorous growth, which let them issue their own, often
highly valued, shares to pay rich prices for their targets.
<p>
   Could the merger boom continue even if the stock market
registered a significant drop? Perhaps, at least for a while.
<p>
   A number of investment firms, such as the Blackstone Group,
Lehman Brothers and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., have raised
billions of dollars from institutional investors in the last year
or so as they have assembled new merchant banking funds, and they
have yet to invest most of this money.
<p>
   In the event of a market decline, however, Nelkin said this
investment capital would probably go into industrial stocks rather
than more speculative issues.

<p>
   Perhaps more important to chief executives than keeping their
jobs is maintaining their reputations. In 1998, several well-known
executives face the risk of tarnished reputations, if only because
of heightened ambitions; for other executives, both their
reputations and their jobs may be at stake.
<p>
   In some cases, executives, like Sanford I. Weill at Travelers
Group, have been so widely lauded that they will have to work hard
to live up to the expectations.
<p>
   Others, like Stephen F. Wiggins of Oxford Health Plans, face
lower expectations, but may have to perform extraordinarily to hold
on to their posts. In all cases, these executives will have to
impress an audience of investors and directors who are showing a
growing hunger for quick results.
<p>
   Many other executives could easily be added to this list, but
here are some of the better known officers in the hot seat this
year:
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   George M.C. Fisher, chairman and chief executive of Eastman
Kodak Co.
<p>
   Fisher has not worked the magic expected of him since he was
hired from Motorola Inc. in 1993. In response to investors'
impatience, Kodak announced in November that it was laying off
10,000 employees and would take a pretax reorganization charge of
at least $1 billion.
<p>
   It then raised the ante in December, saying it would cut several
thousand additional workers. In 1998, investors may start to see
whether the measures turn around the troubled imaging company.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Philip M. Condit, chairman and chief executive of Boeing Co.
<p>
   In October, shortly after Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and became the country's only manufacturer of large
commercial aircraft, it announced that it was having problems
increasing production to take advantage of a booming demand for
planes.
<p>
   The company said it would take a $1.6 billion pretax charge to
cover production problems on Boeing 737 and 747 jets. Boeing's
reputation as a premier engineering and production company, and
Condit's reputation as an affable but savvy leader, may be hurt if
the company does not recover quickly.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Christopher B. Galvin, chief executive of Motorola Inc.
<p>
   In late 1996, Galvin became chief executive of the company
founded by his grandfather in 1928. But the company has had trouble
gaining its footing as it decides what businesses it wants to be
in. If some of its big bets do not start paying off, Galvin risks
being branded a chief executive by inheritance.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Sanford I. Weill, chairman and chief executive of Travelers
Group.
<p>
   In September, Weill showed the world he had a big smile and a
healthy appetite, as Travelers announced that it planned to swallow
Salomon Inc. for more than $9 billion. But there are considerable
risks and challenges in weaving together different cultures and
businesses. And while Weill is considered a master integrator, the
expectations of him are particularly high because of the size of
Travelers' latest acquisition.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Paul Hazen, chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
<p>
   Hazen has spent a lot of time apologizing lately. And for good
reason. By all accounts, Wells Fargo has badly fumbled its $11
billion acquisition in April 1996 of First Interstate Bancorp.
Computer problems, an exodus of First Interstate managers and poor
service have left many customers angry. There has been some talk of
a possible takeover of Wells Fargo, but analysts say basic customer
service issues should be Hazen's first concern.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Stephen F. Wiggins, founder of Oxford Health Plans Inc.
<p>
   Over the last year, Oxford has attracted widespread attention
for problems that have included falling seriously behind in paying
its bills. Though Wiggins has acknowledged the problems, he tried
to deflect some of the blame to a new computer system; skeptics are
focusing increasingly on his management.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   Eric E. Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Novell Inc.
<p>
   Schmidt took over the job of trying to turn around Novell in
April after his predecessor lasted only 30 months on the job. The
company, a maker of computer networking software, has long enjoyed
big market share, but sales have stagnated and Novell is facing
increasingly stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. Schmidt's new
job was a big leap for this former chief technology officer at Sun
Microsystems Inc., and this year may tell whether it was too much
of one.

   ASIAN ECONOMIES COME DOWN TO EARTH
<p>
   For years, investors seeking growth had looked to Asia, where
economies often seemed to rise as rapidly as the shiny skylines of
the capital cities. In 1997, though, cracks started appearing in
the foundations, and the global economy  &MD;  the same force that had
laid the bricks for the furious growth  &MD;  proved that it could help
tear down what it had joined in building.
<p>
   One economy after another, starting with Thailand, stumbled
under currency devaluations and capital flight. Perhaps the hardest
hit was South Korea; along with Thailand and Indonesia, it was
forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund to help pick up
the pieces. But Japan, whose economy has been sluggish throughout
the 1990s, was still standing at year's end.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   JAPAN'S TROUBLE DEEPENS
<p>
   Japan had other headaches, though, as the crisis in its
financial services industry deepened. Nomura Securities, the
biggest Japanese securities firm, was penalized by the authorities
after it was found to have made illegal payments to a racketeer.
The gangster scandal spread to other companies, including Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank and Yamaichi Securities. Yamaichi collapsed in
November, putting thousands of employees out of work.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   NO LONGER A COLONY
<p>
   The lowering of the Union Jack in Hong Kong was expected to test
the notion that the end of the Cold War had elevated economics
above politics. After getting their hands on the former British
colony, the talk went, China's leaders might be unable to resist
imposing some of the elements of their command economy, in addition
to limiting political freedoms.
<p>
   Instead, the financial markets shrugged off the change of
leadership and continued to rise  &MD;  until the spreading Asian crisis
threatened to undermine this capitalist capital, too. But the Hong
Kong sell-off only reinforced the view that in the global economy,
the concerns of the market, not political ideology, rule.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   `FAST TRACK' IS DERAILED
<p>
   The Asian financial crisis was a handy poster child for
congressional Democrats concerned about the dangers of foreign
trade entanglements. Members of President Clinton's own party led
the fight against legislation that would have renewed his authority
to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or reject
but not alter.
<p>
   Facing defeat, the president agreed to shelve the matter,
handing a victory to organized labor, which saw a threat to
American jobs from a flood of ever-cheaper goods from Asian
countries determined to export their way out of economic trouble.
But many business executives warned that the lack of so-called
fast-track negotiating authority would prove costly to the U.S.
economy.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   DEAL MAKING, EURO-STYLE
<p>
   The United States may have been casting an increasingly wary eye
abroad, but, more and more, foreigners were adopting American ways
of doing business. Nowhere was that more apparent than in a Europe
preparing for currency union.
<p>
   Though politicians, particularly in France, may have gone along
only grudgingly, big European companies rushed to imitate their
American cousins, with a wave of deal making and consolidation
unlike anything the Continent had yet seen.
<p>
   Among the biggest combinations were Grand Metropolitan's linkup
with Guinness, bringing together two giant food and alcohol
conglomerates, and a complex deal to join the financial services
businesses of BAT of Britain and Zurich Insurance of Switzerland.
The big Swiss banks  &MD;  facing further criticism for their handling
of the Nazi gold affair  &MD;  were among the biggest deal makers, with
Union Bank and Swiss Bank agreeing to merge.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   THE GOLD BUST OF '97
<p>
   Even in a world pushing into the 21st century, room remains for
something as venerable and familiar as good old gold lust. Such was
the driving force, it seems, for all parties in the Bre-X Minerals
scandal: the Canadian company's geologists, its executives, even
its investors who lost everything when Bre-X collapsed after its
astonishing claim to have made the richest gold find in history  &MD; 
in the Busang province in Indonesia  &MD;  was found to be a fraud.

 &UR; HOT MARKET FOR INITIAL OFFERINGS TAPERS OFF &LR;  &QL; 
(th) &QL; 
 &UR; By REED ABELSON &QC;  &LR;   &QL;

<p>
   Despite a few fireworks early in the year, the market for
initial public stock offerings ended 1997 with few of the price
explosions of the previous few years.
<p>
   ``IPOs just aren't producing great returns,'' said Linda
Killian, an analyst at Renaissance Capital Corp., a research firm
in Greenwich, Conn., that specializes in initial public offerings.
<p>
   New offerings gained an average of 19 percent during the year,
according to Securities Data Co., a research concern in Newark,
N.J. That compared with nearly 23 percent for the Dow Jones
industrial average. While the 1997 returns for initial offerings
were greater than the 14 percent gain in 1996, they paled in
contrast with the much more impressive gain of 33 percent in 1995.
<p>
   Investors were ignoring stocks that might be considered bargains
under other circumstances. Take LECG Inc., a consulting company in
Emeryville, Calif. Though the company's underwriters sharply
reduced the share price from the $11 to $13 a share that they had
originally proposed, investors still refused to take notice. After
making its debut in mid-December at $9 a share, the stock closed
the year at $8.75. But it wasn't only IPOs that were ignored;
investors were shying away from small-company stocks in general
toward the end of the year.
<p>
   There were some big bangs, of course. Among the most impressive
was Rambus Inc., a semiconductor technology outfit in Mountain
View, Calif., whose shares soared from their initial price of $12
in May to more than $80 in August. The stock has since fallen
somewhat closer to earth, ending the year at $45.75.
<p>
   The year also showed a foreign flair as companies around the
world took advantage of the U.S. capital markets. Among the largest
offerings was France Telecom, which raised $7 billion as the French
government offered a roughly one-fifth stake to the public,
including shares sold in the United States. Foreign companies
accounted for roughly a quarter of the $43 billion raised in IPOs
in the United States, according to Securities Data.
<p>
   Analysts and portfolio managers hold out little hope that this
year will provide more excitement. ``We're going to have a slow
start in 1998,'' Ms. Killian predicted. As long as investors feel
defensive, they will stay away from any stock they perceive as
risky without offering the potential of high returns.
<p>
   Still, there is no shortage of companies clamoring to go public.
More than 100 have already filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. ``Clearly, there is an awful lot of paper in line to be
printed in the first quarter,'' said J. Misha Petkevich, managing
director of investment banking for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
<p>
   Among the areas that Petkevich believes will see a significant
amount of IPO activity are business service companies that provide
outside help, companies that can benefit from consolidation in
their industries and health care and technology companies,
especially those that have developed ways to apply technology to
``mundane products and processes.''
<p>
   But investors are already turning their noses up at some of the
offerings, especially if the companies going public have little in
the way of earnings history or a vague business plan.
<p>
   ``I'm not sure I'm going to pick up that much'' in 1998, said
Peter C. Schliemann, a portfolio manager for David L. Babson &AMP; Co.,
who said he thought that the quality of the deals was
``deteriorating rapidly.''
<p>
   With the overall market making investors jittery, what most
buyers want right now is the closest thing to a sure bet  &MD;  and many
have already learned that IPOs are anything but.
<p>
   Robert Natale, editor of Standard &AMP; Poor's Emerging and Special
Situations newsletter, says the real challenge for underwriters in
1998 will be to find people who have not already been burned by
buying new stocks.
<p>
   ``They have to find a new pool of ready buyers,'' he said.

<p>
   The Republicans and the Democrats have signaled that this year
they are set to repeat the performances that led to the Taxpayer
Relief Act of 1997.
<p>
   Unfortunately for taxpayers, that legislation has been described
by many experts as a badly drafted mess that, while promising
simplicity and fairness, actually adds complexity and creates
burdens for many people, especially those with modest incomes.
<p>
   The Republicans believe that by championing lower taxes and
rewards for those who save and invest, combined with attacking the
Internal Revenue Service, they can solidify their hold on both
houses of Congress and pave the way to a Republican White House in
2001.
<p>
   The Democrats remain in disarray, with no viable alternative to
the Republican agenda and with leaders who talk only vaguely of tax
reform.
<p>
   But regardless of the tone of the debate, one fact remains
unchanged: the share of the national economic pie going to taxes
continues to enlarge, despite a half century of talk by politicians
of both parties polishing their images as tax cutters.
<p>
   And as 1997 came to an end, money was pouring into the IRS, a
result of the booming economic fortunes of those citizens with the
highest incomes. While receipts collected in October 1997 for
payroll taxes like Social Security were up 7.4 percent over October
1996, individual income taxes were up 13.2 percent.
<p>
   That indicates that over all, the one in five Americans who make
more than about $66,000 annually are experiencing sharply rising
incomes. And for those making more than $250,000, the top 1 percent
of taxpayers, all indications are that the good times are really
good, contributing to the bulge in government coffers.
<p>
   ``The government is taking a larger and larger share of the pie
even with the constraints on spending'' that Congress enacted in
recent years, said Aldona Robbins, a supply-side economist with the
Institute for Policy Innovation, a Washington nonprofit
organization that does research on taxes and the economy.
<p>
   That money will cause lots of fights over how best to spend, or
give back, any surplus. But what about fundamental tax reform?
<p>
   ``You will hear all kinds of ranting and raving, but there will
not be any big changes,'' said Robert McIntyre, director of
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group that favors a
progressive income tax system.
<p>
   Here is what to look for:
<p>
   TAX CUTS: Count on them, but not necessarily for much money.
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the Ways and Means Committee,
has committed himself to an annual tax cut. Ari Fleischer, his
spokesman, said Archer ``believes the American people are entitled
to tax relief every year, that they remain overtaxed, and it ought
to be our goal to reduce the size of government so that people can
keep more of what they make.''
<p>
   COMPLEXITY: Expect more of it. The Republicans want to cut
taxes, and President Clinton has indicated a willingness to
consider cuts and changes, but the available dollars are relatively
few. A likely result will be gimmicks that give tax breaks to those
willing to run the gantlet of intersecting rules and extensive
worksheets to calculate benefits. Such measures cost less than
outright reductions in rates because many people cannot, or will
not, take advantage of them. Complexity, in turn, means higher fees
for accountants and tax preparers.
<p>
   INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS: Before 1987, the first $200 of dividends
and interest for each individual ($400 for a couple) was not taxed,
a policy that Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., a freshman who serves on
the Ways and Means Committee, wants to revive. Archer, the
committee chairman, has him out floating this trial balloon.
<p>
   ``People who put together a little nest egg, say $4,000, on
which they earn 5 percent interest, or $200, should not be
penalized for their thrift,'' Hulshof said.
<p>
   Archer and his allies say that they eventually want to end all
taxes on savings and investment income.
<p>
   CAPITAL GAINS: The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 lowered the
maximum rate on long-term capital gains. But it raised the
complexity, creating a host of new effective capital gains rates,
depending on the length of time an asset is held or a taxpayer's
bracket for ordinary income. Because of this complexity, people
with capital gains last year will not be able to file their 1997
tax returns until February, when the IRS will issue a revised
Schedule D.
<p>
   In a recent speech, Donald C. Lubick, the assistant treasury
secretary for tax policy, said that ``we have not heard the last
word'' on capital gains rates.
<p>
   ESTATE TAXES: Speaker Newt Gingrich wants to eliminate the
estate tax, which will raise about $22 billion this year, a little
more than 1 percent of government revenues. Republicans say the
estate tax penalizes savings and encourages all sorts of tax games
that create inefficiency. And the tax is hated by millions of
people, many of whom live in fear of it but do not have enough
money to be affected by it.
<p>
   Democrats can be expected to denounce ending the estate tax as
favoring the rich because only the wealthiest 1 percent of
Americans pay it. Democrats can also be expected to argue that the
tax makes up for holes in the income tax system that allow those
who own businesses to avoid paying many taxes during their
lifetime.
<p>
   ``Ending the estate tax would further reduce progressivity in
the tax structure,'' said McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice.
<p>
   MARRIAGE PENALTY: Millions of married couples pay higher taxes
than they would if they just lived together. Two single taxpayers,
for example, each with taxable income of $50,000, would be in the
28 percent bracket, but if they married and reported taxable income
of $100,000, they would be in the 31 percent bracket.
<p>
   Democrats and Republicans alike detect voter resentment at this,
but they hear no complaints from the millions of American couples
who, conversely, get a marriage bonus under the current tax laws.
(In this case, a single taxpayer with income of $125,000 would be
in the 36 percent bracket; if she married someone who had no
income, they would be in the 31 percent bracket as a couple.)
<p>
   One possible way to end the marriage penalty would be a law that
allows married people to figure their taxes twice, as a couple and
as if they were two singles, and to pay the lower amount. That,
however, adds complexity.
<p>
   THE IRS: Expect more attention to be paid to IRS abuses of
taxpayers as Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, conducts hearings to coincide with
the April 15 deadline for filing 1997 income tax returns.

<p>
   PARIS  &MD;  When European Union leaders meet on the first weekend in
May to decide which of their countries qualify to start phasing in
a common currency in 1999, they will be making a monumental
political decision as well as a monetary one.
<p>
   Politically, creating a common currency could have far-reaching
consequences, either putting Europe on the road to becoming a
superstate on a par with the United States or blocking closer unity
by widening existing European national divisions.
<p>
   Until now, all European politics has been national, even the
elections every five years to the European Parliament, whose
members are virtually all political obscurities. The decisions that
really count, about foreign and security policy, taxation and
government spending, have always been made in London, Paris, Bonn
and other national capitals, not in the European Union headquarters
at Brussels.
<p>
   Next Jan. 1, however, the countries that qualify to start using
the new currency, the euro, will surrender to an independent
European Central Bank based in Frankfurt a basic power of national
sovereignty  &MD;  to issue and regulate legal tender.
<p>
   The new euros will not actually start jingling in people's
pockets until three years later. But just as the creation of the
Bank of the United States in 1791 reinforced the power of the
federal government and led to long, bitter political battles over
states' rights, the impending arrival of the euro has been seen,
particularly by its opponents, as a key step down the road to a
centralized European state.
<p>
   Among the countries expected to adopt the euro initially, none
has been more shaken politically by the idea of giving up its
national currency than Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has
been among the firmest supporters of the euro, nevertheless likes
to point out that the Deutsche mark, which was introduced in the
western part of the country before the Federal Republic was
established or had a flag in 1949, became a symbol of German
recovery and self-respect after World War II.
<p>
   Kohl is counting on the euro to keep Germans firmly tied to the
European Union after German unification. But polls show that many
of them are skeptical about the new currency, and Kohl faces an
uphill battle to win a fifth election as chancellor next September.
The Social Democratic opposition has not made the euro much of an
issue so far, perhaps because no matter who wins the German
elections next fall, the new currency will already be cast in stone
by then.
<p>
   German insistence on a strong euro has often been expressed as
skepticism about the wisdom of including in the currency union the
``Club Med'' countries of southern Europe  &MD;  Spain and Italy are the
largest  &MD;  that have historically been less worried about inflation.
<p>
   Those countries, except Greece, are now generally expected to
join the currency union with the first round of members in 1999.
German opposition to their joining softened last year as Germany's
own economy weakened, and Italy, for instance, is doing a better
job of controlling budget deficits these days than Germany is.
<p>
   Still, even with Italy and Spain, at most 11 of the 15 current
European Union member states will be qualified or willing to join
in the first round. Not only Britain, which has long resisted
monetary union, but also Sweden and Denmark do not want the euro
just yet, and Greece cannot meet the limits on inflation and
federal budget deficits set by the treaty that established the
euro.
<p>
   While France has embraced the single currency as a way of tying
Germany firmly to Europe, there has been political fallout over the
strict fiscal policies that France has had to adopt to bring it
into line with the requirements for the common currency. The
belt-tightening has exacerbated France's traditionally high
unemployment.
<p>
   Lionel Jospin, the prime minister, has persuaded fellow European
Union leaders to hold regular political consultations among the
countries that adopt the euro to make sure that the independent
central bank thinks about fostering economic growth and jobs as
well as keeping inflation under control.
<p>
   France and Germany have not yet agreed on who the president of
the new European central bank should be. Germany supports Willem
Duisenberg of the Netherlands, and France has proposed Jean-Claude
Trichet, the president of its Banque de France. The choice will be
made in May, and there is speculation that France would support
Duisenberg if Germans and others agreed to let Trichet take over
after four years.
<p>
   Europeans coordinate a lot of things already, including foreign
aid and trade, environmental regulations and agricultural policy.
But once the common currency goes into effect, the individual
countries in it will have no choice, no more ability to play with
exchange rates or expand the money supply to stimulate job growth
than individual American states do now, under the Federal Reserve
System.
<p>
   Thrown together in the economic sphere, Europeans may eventually
also get serious about making foreign policy together and building
a European military-industrial complex that could rival that of the
United States and weaken NATO, argue critics like Martin Feldstein,
the Harvard economics professor.
<p>
   But the euro could also prove to be a divisive force inside
Europe. If Germany's economy booms while France's busts, one
monetary policy cannot make people in both countries happy. And
there will continue to be tensions between ``ins'' and ``outs'' as
long as the common European currency falls short of being the
single European currency.
<p>
   Ten formerly Communist countries in central Europe, plus Cyprus,
are all hoping to join the European Union after the new currency is
in place, and negotiations will begin with six of them in March.
Not all may qualify to have the euro even after they get in,
officials say.
<p>
   So, whether the new currency will lead to a European federal
state or accentuate European national differences instead remains
to be seen. What is indisputable is that, as Lawrence H. Summers,
the U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary, said recently, its creation
will be ``an event without precedent, either in European history or
the history of the world.''

 &UR; FORD TO SELL LOW-EMISSION 1999 SPORT UTILITIES, MINIVANS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Dearborn, Michigan, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said
each of its 1999-model sport utility vehicles and Windstar minivans
will qualify as low-emission vehicle, based on California
hydrocarbon standards that are much stricter than federal
requirements.
<p>
   The automaker also is testing lightweight body materials and
alternative powerplants, including fuel cells, that by 2004 could
begin to eliminate automobiles as a major concern in global
warming.
<p>
   Ford, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. are using the
North American International Auto Show in Detroit to showcase their
environmental research, trying to blunt both a ``green'' marketing
push by Japanese rivals and pressure for new government mandates.
The show opened to media previews yesterday.
<p>
   ``We are pursing a broad array of technologies to let consumers
decide for themselves what works for them,'' said Jacques Nasser,
president of Ford's automotive operations.
<p>
   The U.S. automakers are most concerned about new mandates on
light trucks, which have provided most of their profits in recent
years. The California Air Resources Board, for example, wants light
trucks to be regulated like cars by 2004, instead of being allowed
to generate three times more nitrous oxide and higher amounts of
other pollutants.
<p>
   On 1999-model Windstars and sport utilities, including
Explorers, Expeditions and Navigators, computers will control the
mix of fuel and air in the engine, burning the fuel more
efficiently to cut pollution. The vehicles will also have advanced
catalytic converters to trap and burn emissions. Ford didn't say
how much the new equipment will cost.
<p>
   Under federal mandates for the 1998 model year, big sport
utilities can emit no more than 0.38 grams of hydrocarbons a mile.
The 4.6-liter Expeditions now sold in California emit 0.09 grams a
mile, and Ford's plan is to reduce that to 0.07 grams for 1999,
meeting the California low-emissions standard, and sell the
vehicles nationwide.
<p>
   The 1999 sport utilities will produce only half the emissions of
competitive models and only about 4 percent of emissions from
vehicles built in the 1970s, Ford said.
<p>
   The low-emission sport utilities will also be a powerful
marketing tool. They will allow Ford to counter Honda Motor Corp.,
which is running ads saying it's selling low-emission cars because
it's concerned about the health of its customers.
<p>
   Honda will sell about 450,000 low-emission Accords and Civics in
the U.S. and Canada this year. Ford expects to sell about 800,000
low-emission sport utilities and minivans in the U.S. next year.
``I'm talking about a big impact right now, because we are
accelerating the rate of replacement of older vehicles with much
clearer ones,'' Nasser said.
<p>
   Ford also will show to the public for the first time on Saturday
a driveable prototype of an aluminum Taurus-size car weighing 2,000
pounds, compared to 3,318 pounds for a current model. It's powered
by 1.2-liter, direct-injection diesel engine. It gets 63 miles a
gallon and travels just as far and fast as today's models.
<p>
   Later this year, Ford expects to build a version of the car in
which the diesel engine is supplemented by an electric motor. By
2000, it expects to build a version powered by fuel cells, devices
that produce energy by mixing hydrogen and oxygen.
<p>
   Ross Witschonke, Ford's development director for the prototypes,
said it's too soon to tell whether gasoline-electric hybrids or
fuel cells will be the first to become commercially viable.
<p>
   The company said it's offering $2,000 rebates on twin-fuel
vehicles that run on ethanol, gasoline or any combination of the
two. Ford expects to sell about 250,000 such vehicles in the next
three to four years. By so doing, it will obtain credits that make
it easier to meet federal fuel economy guidelines, even though
sales of the Expedition, which gets about 12 miles to a gallon, are
growing faster than other models.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Asian economic crisis of 1997 started slowly,
like a typhoon lazily making its way across the Pacific.
<p>
   It hit first in Thailand, a country that Americans know more for
its beaches and its architecture than for its ill-regulated
financial markets, which had been languishing already. The
devaluation of the country's currency, the baht, began just before
the July 4 holiday, when it seemed particularly easy to dismiss the
free fall as one of those freak events that occasionally wipe out
unwary investors in faraway markets. Then the storm picked up
moisture and descended on Malaysia and Indonesia.
<p>
   To Americans, it still seemed remote. It was not until the fury
hit Hong Kong, prompted a brief but impressive sell-off in New
York, swamped South Korea and then threatened Tokyo that Americans
really woke up to the market disaster hovering across the Pacific.
<p>
   So, for 1998 one question that looms over the American markets
is: will the Asian crisis stay in Asia? Or despite months of
frantic efforts to contain the contagion, is it bound to drift
across the ocean? If Asia ultimately undoes the American markets,
it will be a cruel twist of financial fate.
<p>
   Asia was supposed to be the continent of miracles in the 90s,
the place to put one's money as a hedge against the day when the
great American bull run came to a halt. After all, as managers of
emerging market funds argued for years, Asia boasted the world's
fastest-growing middle class, buyers who had already stuffed their
shelves with Hollywood movies and were eagerly moving on to
Explorers and Pentiums. Asia, in short, was America's insurance
policy.
<p>
   As the Asian hunger for things American grew, it was easy to
draw neat lines showing how profits for American companies would
rise, feeding ever-greater expectations about earnings and stock
prices.
<p>
   But suddenly the insurance policy lapsed. And the prescriptions
written by Washington and the International Monetary Fund for what
ails Asia  &MD;  prescriptions that call for high interest rates, the
shutdown of banks and overextended businesses, and a new era of
government austerity  &MD;  portend years of hardship. Just when the
United States was looking to Asia for export growth, Asia began
looking to the United States to consume its cars and electronics,
now 50 percent cheaper than they were early in 1997.
<p>
   Whether American investors can maintain their optimism through a
prolonged Asian downturn has as much to do with market psychology
as with the monthly tally of American exports.
<p>
   How else to explain that terrifying plunge in the American
markets in October when Hong Kong stocks collapsed and investors
convinced themselves that the trouble was headed here? Or the
equally inexplicable recovery of the American markets for the rest
of the year, despite the subsequent meltdown of South Korea, one of
America's biggest trading partners?
<p>
   With the exception of the Hong Kong scare, the market psychology
of the Asian crisis has been chiefly of the it-couldn't-happen-here
variety. Time after time, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has
offered up for the cameras his reassuring patter about the ``solid
fundamentals'' of the American economy  &MD; low unemployment, factories
working at near capacity, no imminent threat of inflation. In fact,
his aides say that a flood of inexpensive Asian imports is helping
keep inflation in check.
<p>
   Rubin has plenty of logic to back up his public optimism: The
United States does not suffer from many of the maladies that led to
the Asian meltdown. Americans have not been building office towers
that no one is occupying, for example, or adding the capacity to
make 10 times the number of cars that the local markets can absorb.
<p>
   Still, Rubin has been caught in the classic bind afflicting any
finance minister: If he said publicly how concerned he was that
American markets might suffer the same fate as Asia's, he might
cause exactly the sell-off he is trying to avoid.
<p>
   But if, as a former trader himself, he was not acutely concerned
that the contagion could end up here, the Treasury Department would
not have spent the last two months putting the government on the
financial equivalent of red alert, holding meetings in the White
House situation room and flying officials around the world to try
to re-cork the bottle.
<p>
   This contrast of public confidence and the frenzied effort to
contain the Asian crisis has given these prosperous times an
acutely fragile feel. With the American markets still at dizzying
heights, people might feel that anyway. But Asia has made possible
any number of scenarios for a bursting of the balloon.
<p>
   Robert A. Johnson, the former managing director at Soros Fund
Management, wrote recently that ``the Asian downturn and the sharp
deflation of optimism have made the global pie smaller.'' Others
point to the global manufacturing overcapacity and the very real
possibility that American factories could get squeezed as Asian
nations flood the world with cheaper exports.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Dour economic historians, who always seem to keep statistics
from the 1920s at their fingertips, offer another explanation for
why angst may be in order: From 1921 to 1929 American industrial
production surged, car factories operated at record levels, and
American technology ruled  &MD;  while much of the rest of the world was
descending into currency devaluations and other forms of economic
chaos.
<p>
   These explanations all seem vaguely unsatisfying, though.
Exports matter, but the markets have already discounted the
diminished demand from Asia; market history matters, but more as a
cautionary tale of how small disasters can become large ones rather
than as a model ripe for replication. What sends markets over the
edge is a nasty surprise.
<p>
   Certainly, plenty of potential surprises could strike next.
China is perhaps the biggest source of worry. So far it has been
immune to the Asian contagion, chiefly because its currency is not
fully convertible. But Shanghai is also full of empty office
buildings, and the privatization of state-run industries will put
enormous pressure on the government to mess with the markets,
chiefly to prevent mass unemployment.
<p>
   Japan poses a threat of another kind. It has denied the depth of
its economic and structural problems for so long that investors
doubt each new government promise to clean things up. If the
Japanese stock market plunges further, it will sink many of the
banks that today are barely holding on. And each step forward  &MD; 
including a big commitment of public funds to shore up the
financial sector  &MD;  is matched by a step backward. Just a few weeks
ago, for example, the Japanese Finance Ministry said it would not
press the banks to meet higher financial reserve standards that
were to go into effect in the spring; the markets took that as
another sign that problems were still being covered up.
<p>
   And then there are the wild cards, like politics. In Indonesia,
for instance, questions abound concerning the health of President
Suharto and whether he will be chosen for a new term. Trouble could
break out again between China and Taiwan. Or South Korea could back
away from some of the commitments it made to the IMF.
<p>
   In 1997, investors bet that despite the ill winds blowing from
Asia, these things, or worse, would probably not happen. The fate
of the U.S. markets in 1998 may depend on whether such thinking
continues.

<p>
   In the 1990s, the performance of the American stock market has
been nothing short of amazing, particularly in the last three
years. Over that stretch, investors in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index have seen their money more than double. That had
never happened before in so short a period.
<p>
   Much of that performance has come from demographics, as the baby
boom reaches the age when it seems wise to invest for retirement
and surveys an investment scene characterized by interest rates far
lower than when the boomers were young and borrowing to buy homes.
<p>
   But the stock market's outstanding performance reflects more
than demographic levitation. It has had an important fundamental
support: Corporate earnings have also risen, with a consistency and
a magnitude not seen in nearly half a century.
<p>
   To be sure, stock prices have also risen rapidly, leading some
to question whether investors are overpaying when they buy stocks.
And companies do not necessarily have to have earnings to be
stock-market stars. The best performer of last year, excluding
stocks that began the year at less than $5, showed a gain of more
than 500 percent. It was an Internet company that has yet to show
an annual profit. And its name aptly summed up the attitude among
stock market investors: Yahoo. (Ranking second was another
money-losing Internet company with an appropriate name for this
market: Mindspring Enterprises.)
<p>
   Still, for most companies profits do count. And the very
persistence of rising profits has helped to convince investors that
it does not matter if you pay a bit much for a stock based on
current conditions: better days and higher profits that are coming
will more than offset that.
<p>
   For 1998, the biggest question mark on the bullish horizon may
be whether confidence in earnings growth will still prove to be
justified. While most Wall Street analysts think profits for
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 will rise for a seventh consecutive year  &MD; 
which would also be a first  &MD;  there are some who see clouds on the
horizon.
<p>
   It is a horizon that has remained remarkably clear for most of
the 1990s. Corporate profits fell in 1991, reflecting the aftermath
of a brief recession in 1990 and a slew of restructuring charges.
But they rose in 1992 and every year thereafter. Standard &AMP; Poor's
estimates that profits on the S&AMP;P 500 in 1997 were up 163 percent
from the 1992 level.
<p>
   The only better performance over a six-year stretch came in the
years 1945 through 1950, amid a postwar boom. Then profits more
than doubled, but that was off a very low base that had been held
down by wartime wage and price controls.
<p>
   The rise during this decade has come from a variety of forces
that may be running out of steam. The widespread corporate
reorganizations of the early 1990s cost jobs but made companies
more efficient. That helped them to get a rising share of profits
from exports. The threat of overseas competition helped to keep
wage costs down, and the health care revolution stemmed the rise in
employee benefit costs. One result was that corporate profits came
to take an ever bigger slice of the revenue pie while workers got
much less.
<p>
   Now, that may be changing. Wage-cost pressures seem to be
rising, though the data are ambiguous. And while the pressure of
low-cost imports, particularly from Asia, seems likely to keep
price inflation in check, the tight labor market in this country
could push wages up.
<p>
   As a result, companies might end up with higher costs from wages
without an ability to pass on the costs to customers. That would
mean lower earnings.
<p>
   On the other hand, interest rates are expected to remain low,
providing little competition for investment from investors. The
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell below 6 percent late in 1997
and is likely to remain there.
<p>
   In 1997, the S&AMP;P 500 rose 31 percent, for a total profit for
holders of the stocks in the index of 33.4 percent, including
reinvested dividends. That brought the three-year performance for
the index, which dates back to 1928, to a stunning 125 percent,
including reinvested dividends. The previous best performance for
the index over a three-year stretch came in 1933-35, when the
market was bouncing off Depression lows. In that period, investors
made a 95 percent profit, well under the most recent performance.
<p>
   To be sure, the S&AMP;P 500 figure overstates how most investors
did. The S&AMP;P 500 outperformed most other indexes by a sizable
margin last year, in part because a lot of foreign money came into
the U.S. market, fueled by worries about the crisis in Asia, and
gravitated toward the internationally known companies that dominate
the index. Still it was a remarkable performance.
<p>
   To some, the current period is most reminiscent of the
mid-1950s. Then, as now, inflation and interest rates were low.
(Lower, in fact, than they have been during this three-year run.)
And from 1954 through 1956, the S&AMP;P 500 had a total return of 88
percent, assuming annual reinvestment of dividends. Until now, that
had been the best postwar return for such a stretch.
<p>
   It is a comforting analogy. For while stock prices fell in 1957,
as the country endured a brief recession, the slide was not a deep
one. And in 1958 stock prices shot up again, with the total return
on the S&AMP;P 500 more than 40 percent.
<p>
   There are several similarities. During the 1950s run, as during
the current one, a president was re-elected by a large majority.
But the opposition party held on to control of both the House and
the Senate as the president proved to have very short coattails.
(Memo to Bill Clinton and Al Gore: At the mid-term election in
1958, the fact that the stock market was soaring did President
Dwight D. Eisenhower's party little good as the opposition
Democrats scored a landslide victory in congressional elections.
And two years later, Vice President Richard M. Nixon lost the
presidential election.)
<p>
   But before investors settle down for another comfortable period,
they should note that there is one way in which the market does not
resemble the 1950s. That is in volatility. The 1950s market was
remarkably placid. Last year's gyrations reached a peak on Oct. 27,
when the market plunged amid worldwide panic over the Asian
turmoil. But there was plenty of volatility even before that.
<p>
   For the year, 32 percent of the trading days saw the S&AMP;P 500 end
the day up or down at least 1 percent from the previous day. That
is an average of about three days every two weeks. That is more
than double the volatility of 1996 and three times that of 1995.

<p>
   Another means of measuring volatility, known formally as the
standard deviation of daily moves, shows just how widely spread out
daily moves are. By that measure, 1997 was the fourth most volatile
year of the last half century, trailing only 1987, 1982 and 1974.
All those years saw violent reversals of the market trend. The fact
that there was no such clear reversal this year could indicate that
one is about to come.
<p>
   Or, the higher volatility could be reflecting changes in the way
markets operate. In the current world of derivative securities and
huge bets placed by institutions, higher volatility may endure
until the market adjusts to new trading strategies.
<p>
   The day last fall when American stock markets were forced to
close early because a wave of selling had sent prices plunging
seems largely forgotten now, only about two months later. Unlike
the 1987 market crash, that plunge, on Oct. 27, is barely reflected
in mutual fund cash flow data. When professional investors got
scared, individual investors saw an opportunity and stabilized the
market.
<p>
   Such commitment by individuals, reflecting both demographics and
a widespread conviction that stocks are now and always will be the
best long-term investment, is the strongest thing the stock market
has going for it in 1998. If that behavior persists, even
widespread earnings disappointments might not be enough to slay the
great bull of the 1990s. &UR;

    &UR; LEVY'S RESIGNATION HURTS NETANYAHU, PEACE PROCESS EXPECTED TO
LIMP ALONG
<p>
    &UR; By LARRY KAPLOW &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c. 1998 Cox News Service &LR; 
<p>
   JERUSALEM  &MD;  As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu battled
to stay in power despite the resignation of his foreign minister
Sunday, the Middle East peace process was expected to continue at
its current faltering pace.
<p>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy announced his resignation in
a dramatic press conference Sunday, after threatening for days that
he would leave the government rather than accept a proposed Israeli
budget that he said neglected the needs of the poor.
<p>
   Netanyahu granted him the budget demands, but still Levy said he
had lost his trust in the government over the budget and continued
attempts to stall the peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
<p>
   Levy, 60, is considered a dovish member of Netanyahu's hard-line
government and heads a small political party that supports
Netanyahu. His exit gives the prime minister just a razor-thin
61-59 majority in the parliament and leaves it vulnerable to
no-confidence votes calling for new elections within months, rather
than as scheduled in the year 2000.
<p>
   In his own press conference Sunday, Netanyahu responded that he
hopes Levy changes his mind and returns to the government  &MD;  Israeli
law allows 48 hours to reconsider. But Netanyahu stressed that his
government and its tough stance in the peace talks will continue.
<p>
   ``We are about to renew the political (peace) negotiations and
here we will insist emphatically on security,'' Netanyahu said.
``Only this government can do that.''
<p>
   Netanyahu denied that his government will face new elections,
but drew campaign-like distinctions between his administration and
that of the opposition Labor Party.
<p>
   He said Labor's last government had raised Palestinian
expectations for a huge land give-away that would end up dividing
this holy city.
<p>
   His party, though, would ``stick to our guns'' and demand that
the Palestinian authorities end terrorism before they receive
Israeli-occupied land where they hope to form their own state.
<p>
   The peace talks are based on the U.S.-backed 1993 Oslo accords,
in which the Palestinians were supposed to receive land in the Gaza
Strip and West Bank that Israel has occupied since the 1967 war.
<p>
   Viewing the events, Dr. Ahmed Tibi, adviser on Israeli affairs
to Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, lamented
Levy's exit.
<p>
   ``The resignation of David Levy is leaving us with the most
radical right wing government in the history of Israel with very
little respect for implementing the peace process,'' Tibi said.
<p>
   Tibi added that he expected, ``1998 to be a year of elections in
Israel.''
<p>
   Netanyahu said his planned trip Jan. 20 to Washington to discuss
the peace process with President Bill Clinton is still on.
<p>
   ``The peace process is going to continue, but maybe in a
different way,'' said Michael Bar-Zohar, a former Labor Party
parliament member who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta.
<p>
   Levy's exit likely would make it harder for Netanyahu to win
government support for troop withdrawals the United States is
urging Netanyahu to make. Elections would freeze the process.
<p>
   ``Everything is going to be put on hold if you have a real
government crisis,'' Bar-Zohar said. ``The whim of any small party
can bring (Netanyahu) down.''
<p>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   In the long run, though, a collapse of the Netanyahu government
might lead to a Labor Party win, which would then accelerate the
peace process.
<p>
   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said Netanyahu's government had
``shamed its voters'' and predicted new elections. Even Netanyahu's
own agriculture minister called for elections.
<p>
   But Netanyahu has survived several crises, each time returning
defiant. No-confidence votes in the Israeli parliament, called the
Knesset, have become routine.
<p>
   Controversies have centered on the economy, scandals over
political appointments and the botched attempted assassination of a
terrorist leader in Jordan.
<p>
   The eight parties in Netanyahu's coalition regularly threaten to
bolt, but stick with him in order to avoid a worse fate for them  &MD; 
a Labor Party government that would leave them all powerless.
<p>
   Netanyahu and Levy have long been rivals as they rose up through
government ranks. Netanyahu is said to hold Levy responsible for
exposing infidelities in his marriage, which Levy denies.
<p>
   But Levy holds a SMALL??? parliament block that Netanyahu needed
after his CLOSE??? election to prime minister in 1996. In return,
he made Levy foreign minister.
<p>
   Some experts said Levy is still just practicing brinkmanship. He
has repeatedly threatened to resign in order to win concessions on
political issues. Nearly every day in the Israeli government, some
person or faction is threatening to resign.
<p>
   ``People yell and scream and threaten to walk out and then come
back,'' said Israeli political scientist Barry Rubin. ``It's just
like buying a carpet in the Middle East.''
<p>
   Levy could, though, decide to run against Netanyahu. Also,
moderate members of Netanyahu's own party could decide to unseat
him and lead the party in a new election.
<p>
   Contenders include moderates Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo(CQ), and hard-line Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert.

<p>
   It is a congressional election year, so more talk than action
can be expected in Washington. But when it comes to economic
issues, there will be plenty to discuss, and the debate could help
shape the nation's agenda for years to come.
<p>
   In Congress and on the campaign trail, Republicans and Democrats
will be wrangling over tax cuts and the very nature of the tax
system. The impending retirement years of the baby boom generation
are giving increasing urgency to efforts to deal with the looming
financial problems of the Social Security and Medicare programs. In
addition, Republicans are eager to give new momentum to their
deregulatory efforts, perhaps by trying to loosen controls on the
electric power industry.
<p>
   And most of all, with the federal budget moving into balance and
maybe into surplus, members of both parties will be grabbing for a
slice of what would be the first excess pool of federal money to
confront lawmakers since 1969.
<p>
   ``The central issue is the real possibility of a budget surplus
and what we should do with it,'' said Stan Collender, a federal
budget analyst at Burson-Marsteller in Washington, citing estimates
of a surplus this year that could amount to tens of billions of
dollars.
<p>
   The year is also certain to feature impassioned debate over the
ways in which the United States should engage economically with the
rest of the world. President Clinton has promised to try again to
win trade-negotiating authority from Congress so that he can
proceed with deals to open markets around the world. Late last
year, liberal Democrats and their supporters in organized labor
blocked his request  &MD;  which would have renewed his authority to
reach deals that Congress can either approve or reject but not
amend.
<p>
   With financial turmoil plaguing Asia and threatening to spill
into other regions, internationalists in both parties face a fight
to convince Congress that the United States should increase its
role in international bailout packages. And the Administration will
face a difficult fight in Congress to overcome intense industry
opposition to the proposed global treaty limiting greenhouse gas
emissions.
<p>
   Here is a guide to some key economic issues on Washington's
plate:
<p>
   THE BUDGET: The federal budget deficit last year fell to $22.6
billion, its lowest level since 1970 and $100 billion lower than
congressional and administration analysts had expected at the
beginning of the year. Officially, both Congress and the White
House are still projecting a deficit for the fiscal year that will
end in September, but they say privately that the deficit might be
eliminated, four years ahead of the schedule laid out in the
balanced budget agreement reached last year.
<p>
   The good news is a result of the economy, which continues to
grow and generate tax revenues at a rate higher than government
economists predicted. But no one in Washington is waiting for a
final tally to lay claim to any surplus. Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.,
who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, wants to
spend more on highways.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich wants to increase spending on the
Pentagon and on science. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, is urging Congress and the White House to pay down
the national debt.
<p>
   Several contingents of Republicans want any surplus allocated to
tax cuts. Democratic leaders want more spending on health and
education. The White House has not signaled its priorities; with
Clinton eager to claim as his legacy a nation restored to fiscal
health, the administration's main message has been not to spend
money that may never appear.
<p>
   ENTITLEMENT REFORM: Last year's budget deal extended the
solvency of the Medicare health insurance program for the elderly
by a few years, but it did little to address the long-term problems
of either Medicare or Social Security. As the day draws nearer when
both programs are expected to begin to face a financial crunch,
Washington is reluctantly beginning to grapple with the politically
painful choices necessary to make certain that the programs can
meet the needs of the baby boomers as they start retiring in
earnest.
<p>
   Among the most critical issues are whether to invest some of
Social Security's money in the stock market and whether to move
eventually to a system under which individuals would take full or
partial control of their government-sponsored retirement plan.
Nothing is likely to be resolved this year. Given the stakes
involved, though, the debate is sure to be lively, and Wall Street
will have an important voice.
<p>
   TRADE: The administration won a substantial trade victory last
month with an agreement under which many nations will open their
markets further to American banks, securities firms, and insurance
companies. The White House challenge now is to win from a skeptical
Congress the right to negotiate further trade deals.
<p>
   Clinton's own party blocked his request for the new ``fast
track'' negotiating authority in November, arguing that the United
States should open its markets only to countries that do not
exploit their workers and their environment to win a competitive
advantage over American workers and companies. But Clinton has
vowed to try for the authority again soon. One possible compromise
would allow further negotiations to open up markets in specific
categories of goods and services but would limit the president's
ability to agree to broad trade deals with particular nations.
<p>
   TAXES: Republicans believe that no issue resonates with voters
like taxes, and they plan to make the most of it. The size and
composition of the package of tax cuts they will seek have not been
determined. Some Republicans are looking at specific proposals like
a plan to remove the so-called marriage penalty, under which
couples filing jointly pay more in taxes than they would if they
were not married. But such a move could be prohibitively expensive.
<p>
   Clinton may propose his own package of cuts aimed at specific
groups. But much of the political debate in 1998 will be centered
on the broader questions of whether the current progressive income
tax system could be replaced by a simpler system; that, Democrats
note, would almost certainly entail shifting some of the burden
away from the wealthy and onto the middle class.

<p>
   The mutual fund industry just finished its biggest year ever. A
record amount of money flowed into long-term funds  &MD;  that is, stock
and bond funds combined. Total assets spread among stock, bond and
money market funds now top $4 trillion. Even after three straight
years of torrid growth, Americans show few signs of slowing down in
their drive to accumulate assets for retirement.
<p>
   Coupled with the strong performance of the equity market in the
last three years, however, the accumulations have skewed mutual
fund holdings heavily toward stocks  &MD;  more so than at any other
time in the last 15 years.
<p>
   While most investors show few signs of being sated in their
appetite for stock funds, the need to rebalance their portfolios
could weigh heavily on investment decisions this year.
<p>
   In the first 11 months of 1997, more than $245 billion in new
investments flowed into stock and bond funds. That topped the
previous record for a full year's cash flows, of $243 billion, set
in 1993. Data on the December cash flows will not be released by
the Investment Co. Institute, a fund trade group, until later this
month, but analysts estimate that stock and bond funds added $12
billion more last month.
<p>
   The heavy flows followed a fairly strong year in 1996, when $234
billion came into stock and bond portfolios.
<p>
   Can this volume continue? A. Michael Lipper, chief executive of
Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual fund performance,
thinks so. He said he expected the money to continue to pour in at
close to its 1997 pace, particularly in stock funds.
<p>
   Lipper noted that when the 1997 stock fund flows were measured
as a percentage of assets, rather than in dollars, they did not
approach the record level set back in 1993. In that year, the
monthly intake of new cash among stock funds measured 1.7 percent
of their assets. The 1997 flows averaged less than 1 percent a
month, and even in 1996, stock funds took in only about 1.3 percent
of assets a month.
<p>
   This year, Lipper said, ``we're looking for the flows to be
somewhat like we saw in 1997.''
<p>
   The makeup of recent cash flows has also changed. In 1993, the
incoming cash was fairly equally divided between stock and bond
funds, but the 1997 cash flows were heavily skewed toward stocks.
Through the end of November, about $209 billion had gone into stock
funds, while a mere $36 billion had headed for fixed-income funds.
<p>
   That imbalance can be traced, first of all, to the performance
of the American stock market, which gained more than 20 percent in
each of the last three years. Those generous returns kept Americans
investing in domestic stock funds despite several sharp slumps in
the market, most recently in October, and notwithstanding a
full-blown crisis in the recently popular developing stock markets
of Asia.
<p>
   Another cause of the imbalance is the lingering effects of the
1994 downturn in the bond market, which began when the Federal
Reserve Board started short-term interest rates on a yearlong
upward path. Investors withdrew $43 billion, or 5.6 percent of
their assets, from bond mutual funds in 1994, plus $4.7 billion
more in 1995. Last year, about $13 billion trickled into the funds,
most of it into high-yield funds, which often closely track the
performance of the stock market.
<p>
   A result of that imbalance is that, at the end of October, 70
percent of the $3.3 trillion in long-term mutual funds was invested
in stocks, with 30 percent in bonds. Not since 1982 has the bond
percentage been so low. At the end of 1993, just before the bond
market slumped, bond funds accounted for slightly more than half of
the total.
<p>
   When the assets invested in money market funds are added to the
equation, stock assets account for 53 percent of total assets; bond
funds register 23 percent of assets, and money market funds, which
investors increasingly use instead of traditional savings and
checking accounts, accounting for 24 percent of assets.
<p>
   That allocation is a marked contrast to the situation at the
beginning of the decade. At the end of 1990, when the latest bull
market began, mutual fund investors held only 23 percent of their
fund assets in stocks, with 30 percent in bonds and 47 percent in
money market funds.
<p>
   Recently it appears that fund investors have been shifting their
investment intentions, expressing renewed interest in bond funds of
all stripes. October marked the first month in four years in which
funds that invest primarily in Treasury bonds received net deposits
of cash. And the $8 billion that flowed into bond funds in November
was the most in a single month since January 1994.
<p>
   Still, even much of the cash that is recorded by the Investment
Co. Institute as being invested in bond funds ends up in stocks.
<p>
   The institute includes in its bond category two types of funds
that invest in all asset classes: balanced funds and flexible
funds. But recently, most of the money in both types has been in
stocks, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago data tracking
company. The average balanced fund tracked by Morningstar has about
56 percent of its portfolio in stocks, with 36 percent in bonds and
8 percent in cash and other investments.
<p>
   In recent months, the balanced and flexible fund categories have
taken in a little more than one-third of the total amount of cash
flowing into bond funds. When that money is divided among stocks,
bonds and cash, the asset allocations of mutual fund investors
appear even more skewed toward stocks.
<p>
   With those factors considered, about 57 percent of the fund
industry's assets are invested in stocks, 25 percent in cash and
only 18 percent in bonds. And when only long-term funds are
considered, fund shareholders have more than three-quarters of
their assets in stocks, with the remaining one-quarter in bonds.
<p>
   Will mutual fund shareholders devote even more money to the
stock market in 1998? Probably, unless there is a strong reversal
in the momentum of stock prices.
<p>
   And if such a reversal causes investors to withdraw money from
stocks, nobody knows what the result will be. Investors have not
made net withdrawals from stock funds since September 1990. At that
time, the assets of stock funds were about one-tenth of their
current level.

 &UR; DOLLAR'S GAINS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE &LR;  &QL;

   The collapse of Asian currencies against the dollar grabbed the
headlines last year. But against other currencies, too, the dollar
made remarkably powerful gains, and many analysts think the rise
will continue.
<p>
   Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose almost 13 percent.
Against the German mark, it rose nearly 17 percent.
<p>
   Some analysts think that the dollar will hit 140 yen at the end
of 1998, up about 7 percent, and that it will reach 1.85 marks,
which would be a jump of 3 percent. The Asian currencies that have
plunged 30 percent to 40 percent are not likely to rebound sharply
very soon.
<p>
   Ravi Bulchandani, a currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean
Witter in London, says the dollar will continue to rally for
several reasons. He expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates to slow growth in the United States, and he believes that
Europe will try to prevent any gain by the mark or other currencies
because that would make its exports less competitive and hinder the
economic rebound in Europe. He also feels, as do many strategists,
that the plan to shift to a single European currency at the
beginning of 1999 favors the dollar for the time being.
<p>
   As for the yen, Karen E. Parker, the currency strategist at
Chase Manhattan Bank, said that the sluggish Japanese economy, the
expansion of opportunities this year for Japanese investors to buy
securities abroad, the attractiveness of U.S. markets and the
weakness of the Japanese financial system all pointed to a stronger
dollar.
<p>
   The stronger dollar is generally expected to cut into corporate
earnings more than it has in recent years, but over all is bringing
mixed blessings to U.S. companies, depending on where they do most
of their business, where they manufacture their products and who
their major competitors are.
<p>
   ``The dollar is something that will be another problem in a
generally difficult environment,'' said Bruce Steinberg, the chief
economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. He said the collapse of Asian
economies and the ensuing decline in demand would have a
significant effect on earnings for U.S. companies.
<p>
   Steinberg estimates that 30 percent of corporate earnings in
this country come from foreign sales. He is forecasting that these
earnings will rise by 10 percent in 1998, half of last year's
increase, while earnings from domestic sales will increase about 7
percent, down from 10 percent. Together, he says, the two will slow
to an earnings growth rate of about 8 percent, down from 13 percent
in 1997.
<p>
   There are several ways in which the stronger dollar is expected
to undercut earnings. First, it will make American exports more
expensive and less competitive abroad. Second, when earnings from
abroad  &MD;  whether from exports or from products made and sold abroad
 &MD;  are translated back into dollars, a stronger dollar will reduce
their value. And third, a stronger dollar will make goods from
abroad cheaper in the United States. That means companies with
foreign competitors, like automakers, will face pressure on prices
at home, which could cut into earnings.
<p>
   Some of these effects could be offset for companies that
manufacture abroad  &MD; especially in Asia  &MD;  because a stronger dollar
will reduce the cost of overseas production.
<p>
   Steinberg predicts that the effects could vary considerably by
industry. At 43 percent, technology companies have the biggest
share of overseas sales of any industry, and many of these
companies have a high exposure in Asia. This means that the decline
in buying from the region could have a major effect.
<p>
   What sales and profits there are could be further reduced when
translated back into stronger dollars if the company is not hedged
against currency fluctuations.
<p>
   While technology companies that price their products in dollars
are hedged against this kind of translation loss, they are more
vulnerable to sales declines from the increased cost in their
products abroad as the value of the dollar rises. Other technology
companies will face competition from products that are made in Asia
and will now be cheaper when sold in the United States.
<p>
   Ten percent of the products bought in the United States are
produced in Asia, so competition from imports will also affect many
other industries. Import prices over all are already down more than
2 percent in the last year, and prices of goods from Asia are off
more than 4 percent and are expected to continue to fall this year.
<p>
   But international exposure will not be all negative. While
pharmaceutical companies, for example, depend heavily on foreign
sales  &MD;  36.5 percent of their total  &MD;  most of those sales are in
Europe. This makes their prospects brighter, in part because many
forecasters think that European growth will remain stable this year
 &MD;  or even pick up a little  &MD;  while the United States slows down and
the slump in Asia continues.
<p>
   For investors, this is a reason not to lump companies into one
large category, such as companies with large international
exposures. For drug companies, and some consumer staples, the
international exposure  &MD;  because it is concentrated in Europe  &MD; 
could turn out to be a plus, not a minus.
<p>
   At the other end of the spectrum are utilities and the
communications sector, where international sales are less than 5
percent. As for banking, while there have been reports of potential
problems because of the exposure in Asia, only 12 percent of the
sales of U.S. banks are from overseas, and that is concentrated
among the money center banks. That means that investors in regional
banks do not have much to worry about.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
<p>
   Early Sunday, thunderstorms rumbled across parts of northern
California while snow fell at elevations as low as 1,500 feet in
the northern Sierra Nevada and heavy snow blanketed the Washington
Cascades. Sunday's barrage of stormy weather was spawned by a pair
of Pacific jet stream disturbances. As the disturbances pressed
inland Sunday night, they started to carve out a trough of low
pressure over the Rockies. This trough will play a pivotal role in
Monday's weather pattern over the eastern two thirds of the nation.
<p>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop Sunday over
the western Gulf Coast States as compact disturbances spew eastward
from the trough over the Rockies while drawing moist Gulf air
northward. Some storms will produce gusty winds and hail. Heavy
rain is possible in the area spanning from east Texas and east
Oklahoma to Alabama and the western panhandle of Florida, including
the middle Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
<p>
   With a trough over the Rockies, a sprawling, unseasonably warm
ridge of high pressure will control much of the East. Record to
near-record temperatures are possible over the northern Middle
Atlantic States, with readings running as much as 30 degrees above
average in parts of Pennsylvania and New York. Cold air trapped in
some of the deep valleys of northern New England may set the stage
for freezing rain or drizzle early Monday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, heavy snow will continue in the northern Cascades as
moist onshore winds persist. By Monday evening, as much as 4 feet
of snow will have fallen since Sunday.
<p>
   Focus: Glazed Plains
<p>
   The deep valleys of the Northeast are primary targets for
freezing rain, but the Great Plains are also vulnerable to glazing
from ice. Like syrup running off a stack of pancakes, a shallow
layer of Arctic air often oozes far south from a mound of Arctic
air over central Canada. If a low pressure system emerges from the
Rockies, mild air from the Gulf of Mexico is drawn over the thin
Arctic layer. Falling snowflakes melt into raindrops in the mild
air aloft, but freeze on contact with cold surfaces near the
ground, a scenario that occurred early Sunday in Kansas, Missouri
and Iowa.

<p>
   Five years after the Harry and Louise television commercials
helped kill the Clinton administration plan for government-nurtured
managed competition in health care, competition is thriving in the
marketplace. But the buyers and the sellers are still struggling to
find a way to manage the health-care monster in a way that assures
both high quality and affordable costs.
<p>
   Costs are headed up again, after a two-year hiatus, though the
increases are far from the double-digit spurts that helped push
health care to the top of the national political agenda in 1993.
<p>
   The health-care economy has undergone sweeping changes since
then. But the system is so big  &MD;  health spending accounts for
one-seventh of gross domestic product  &MD;  and is so varied that even
experts who have studied it for decades are cautious about making
predictions.
<p>
   ``I don't think anyone knows where we are going,'' said Marilyn
Moon, a health economist at the Urban Institute in Washington.
``This is a wacky period in health care.''
<p>
   Most Americans now are members of managed health plans, often
for-profit health maintenance organizations that try to keep
profits growing to please Wall Street. But the growth of managed
care has not reduced costs enough to encompass millions of people
who feel that they cannot afford insurance.
<p>
   Even with the booming economy, the number of uninsured
Americans, who are largely children of low-income parents, rose to
41 million last year, up from 37 million in 1993.
<p>
   ``More people are uninsured, and even those who have insurance
often don't have access to high-quality care,'' said Dr. John
Eisenberg, the administrator of the Federal Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research. For instance, HMOs in some regions do not send
heart bypass patients to hospitals with the best success records in
heart surgery, suggests a recent study of Florida health plans that
was published in Health Affairs, a scholarly journal.
<p>
   Employers, especially those who own small businesses, have
shifted a greater share of health costs to employees, who often
believe that they cannot afford to join the company health plans on
those terms.
<p>
   As Jon Gabel, director of health care surveys for KPMG Peat
Marwick, a benefits consulting firm, put it: ``The more health
insurance premiums go up, the more they are passed on to employees,
who will be asked to contribute even more in the next couple of
years.''
<p>
   People without insurance often end up in hard-pressed public
hospitals, which have been hurt by state and federal budget
cutting. ``People are schlepping along, not really addressing
this,'' said Dr. Ron Anderson, chief executive of Parkland Hospital
in Dallas. ``We've had a real squeeze on revenue, but demand on
public hospitals hasn't gone down.''
<p>
   The health plans typically try to hold down costs by putting
pressure on doctors and hospitals for reduced fees, in many cases
offering them financial incentives to restrain the volume of tests,
admissions to hospitals and referrals to specialists. Some plans
also encourage members to have mammograms and other tests, get
children vaccinated and take other steps to stay healthy and keep
medical costs low.
<p>
   With help from such measures and from the slowdown in overall
inflation, some of the biggest employers, including General Motors,
have kept their enormous health care budgets flat or close to it
over the last few years. It has also helped such employers that the
managed care companies have been eagerly cutting prices to gain
market share, although this has hurt the care companies' earnings.
<p>
   GM spends $3.5 billion annually for health care for active and
retired workers and incurs an additional $1.5 billion accounting
expense against earnings as a required cushion for future retirees.
<p>
   Like many other big companies, GM rates its plans on factors
like cost and quality and summarizes the results for employees.
``We encouraged our people to take the high-quality plans by
charging them less,'' said Jim Cubbin, executive director of health
care initiatives at General Motors. ``We are testing the concept
that quality in health care will translate to lower cost.''
<p>
   Health care economists say the years of pressure on doctors and
hospitals have had positive results, giving them a growing
appreciation of the virtues of cost restraints. But the doctors
have also fought back, sometimes joining with patients in
well-publicized complaints of denials of care.
<p>
   In response to such complaints, HMOs, the states and Congress
have passed hundreds of measures outlawing unpopular restrictions
like one-day limits on hospital maternity care. James Bentley, a
senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said:
``The market has been working, and Congress is picking gaps in the
system, issues that it can build a consensus around.''
<p>
   But spokesmen for the managed care industry and outside experts
agree that these laws will add to costs.
<p>
   On the political front, the ultimate question is whether
middle-class fears of losing health coverage will return, said
Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University professor who is chairman of a
council studying changes in the health system for the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. Such worries, during an era of corporate
layoffs, fueled the debate five years ago over whether the
government should take charge of the nation's health-care system.
<p>
   ``Average middle-class people no longer are subject to these
kinds of fears,'' said Robert Reischauer, a Brookings Institution
economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Instead, he said, the ``steady erosion in employer-sponsored health
insurance coverage is a very slow process'' that has not attracted
much attention.
<p>
   But for the doctors, hospitals and insurers, there has been no
getting around the big changes of the past few years.
<p>
   Paul Ginsburg, an economist who is president of the Center for
Health System Change, a research group in Washington, said demands
by consumers for access to more doctors had changed the way health
plans try to keep control of costs. The health plans often no
longer rely on exclusive relationships with a limited number of
care providers, he said.
<p>
   ``One result is greater use of financial incentives'' to keep
costs down, Ginsburg added. Another is a ``trend of transferring
responsibilities for care management to provider organizations,
along with the financial risks and responsibilities.''
<p>
   Doctors' incomes turned up again in the last few years, after a
dip in 1994. The increase, after accounting for inflation, has been
modest, less than 1 percent a year, according to the American
Medical Association. The medical schools are still turning out
doctors at twice the rate of growth in the overall population.
<p>
   Hospitals are still operating at 60 percent of capacity, but
many of the unused beds are ``mothballed,'' adding little to costs,
so most hospitals have been able to generate profits or, in the
case of nonprofit hospitals, surpluses.
<p>
   As for the HMOs, ``their job is getting more difficult,'' said
Altman of Brandeis. ``They have to push harder on one side, against
doctors and hospitals. On the other side, buyers are more
demanding; they want higher quality, lower prices, greater access
and more choice of doctors and hospitals.''
<p>
   The stocks of many HMO companies have suffered as they have
reported disappointing profits, exacerbated in some cases by
problems with the companies' information systems.
<p>
   ``In the early days, the HMOs extracted fairly substantial
profits,'' Altman said. ``Those days are over.''

<p>
   Los Angeles, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- News Corp. and Viacom Inc.'s
``Titanic'' grossed $32.2 million to claim the No. 1 spot at the
U.S. and Canadian box office for a third weekend, as the studios
seem likely to profit from history's most expensive film.
<p>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.'s latest James Bond film, ``Tomorrow
Never Dies,'' grossed a healthy $14.1 million over the weekend, on
its way to becoming the most profitable film ever in the secret
agent's $2 billion-plus franchise.
<p>
   With its costs capped at $65 million, Viacom's Paramount
Pictures got the better end of its ``Titanic'' co-venture with News
Corp.'s 20th Century Fox, which covered most of the film's $200
million in production costs.
<p>
   ``Paramount's going to make a huge profit on a film for which
they had little creative input, and Fox has a shot at actually
making a profit,'' said Arthur Rockwell of Yaeger Capital Markets,
who has a ``hold'' rating on Viacom and a ``long-term buy'' rating
on News Corp.
<p>
   Analysts expect Fox's investment to pay off if the film about
modern shipping's biggest disaster meets analyst projections of
$500 million to $700 million in worldwide ticket sales. The film
has pulled in a total of $156.4 million over its first three weeks.
The figure is all the more impressive because the film is more than
three hours long, limiting the number of times it can be shown in a
day.
<p>
   The studios are splitting equally the domestic and international
grosses of the film. Studios typically keep about half of theater
receipts, with theater owners keeping the other half.
<p>
   For MGM, ``Tomorrow's'' weekend gross pushes its three-week take
to $93.2 million, making it virtually certain that the film will
top the roughly $100 million that its predecessor, ``GoldenEye,''
made. The film's success, demonstrating that the more than
30-year-old franchise still appeals to 1990s audiences, came
despite its being panned by many critics.
<p>
   The hit is a badly needed boost to the fortunes of MGM, which
went public in November and hasn't made a profit since 1988. Still,
the studio, acquired last year by an investor group controlled by
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, is expected to lose money for a few
years until it builds up its film slate.
<p>
   MGM ``achieved their goal, which was to have a successful major
film release right after their IPO,'' said analyst Harold Vogel of
Cowen &AMP; Co. ``In terms of profits, there's nothing to write home
about yet.''
<p>
   Sony Corp.'s comedy ``As Good as It Gets,'' starring Jack
Nicholson, grossed $12.3 million to take the No. 3 slot in its
second weekend, continuing a winning streak that made Sony Pictures
the top-grossing studio in 1997. The weekend's results brings the
film's two-week gross to $40.9 million.
<p>
   DreamWorks SKG's ``MouseHunt'' grossed $8.7 million for fourth
place in its third week, bringing its total to $40.3 million. While
the showing makes it likely that the fledgling studio will recoup
its $50 million-plus investment, it was less than some analysts had
expected.
<p>
   In its fourth week, DreamWorks' slave drama ``Amistad'' grossed
$4.7 million for seventh place and a total of $27 million. Director
Steven Spielberg has released the film to only 726 screens
nationwide so far in a bid to build a strong word-of-mouth that
will improve its Oscar prospects.
<p>
   Walt Disney Co.'s low-budget horror film ``Scream 2,'' from its
Miramax Films unit, grossed $8 million for fifth place, bringing
its four-week take to $86.2 million. The film's success continues a
strong holiday showing by Disney, highlighted by hits such as
``Flubber,'' which grossed $4.5 million for ninth place over the
weekend. It's brought in $83.2 million in six weeks.
<p>
   Among other Disney films, director Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie
Brown,'' also distributed by Miramax, grossed $7.7 million over the
weekend for seventh place and a total of $27.5 million in two
weeks. Horror film ``An American Werewolf in Paris'' grossed $4.6
million over the weekend for eighth place and a total of $20.2
million in two weeks.
<p>
   One of Disney's few holiday disappointments, ``Mr. Magoo,'' took
in $4.4 million for the No. 10 slot and a two-week take of $15.8
million.
<p>
   Time Warner Inc.'s ``The Postman,'' the latest post-apocalyptic
epic from star Kevin Costner, continued to drag down the fortunes
of Warner Bros., falling out of the top 10 on a gross of $3.5
million. The film has generated $14.6 million in two weeks, capping
the studio's worst performance since 1990.
<p>
   Based on the weekend's top 10 films, Viacom and News Corp. both
grossed $16.1 million, taking into account their split of
``Titanic'' grosses. MGM grossed $14.1 million, Disney grossed
$22.2 million, Sony grossed $12.3 million and DreamWorks grossed
$13.4 million. Warner Bros. and Seagram Co.'s Universal studio
failed to place a film in the top 10 this weekend.

<p>
   So far, the Asian financial crisis has hit the Boeing Co. with
all the force of a wispy feather. An Indonesian airline delayed
delivery of three planes for less than a week, and some Asian
airlines have talked about giving up options to buy new jets. But
not one actual order has been canceled, and the Boeing assembly
lines are straining to keep up with demand.
<p>
   Behind that picture of good fortune, however, is a disquieting
fear. Nearly one-third of Boeing's backlog of orders are from Asian
airlines. If they began to cancel, Boeing would be in trouble.
<p>
   The U.S. economy, like so many of its premier companies, is in a
similar position. There is plenty to celebrate, but the boom is
precarious. The odds are that the economic expansion that began in
1991 will last at least another year, becoming, by December, the
second-longest period of uninterrupted growth in half a century,
trailing only the 1960s. All 52 forecasters surveyed monthly by
Blue Chip Economic Indicators expect 1998 to be another year of
growth. But that does not rule out the possibility of trouble.
<p>
   The Asian crisis has raised the most alarms, but there are
other, sometimes related, threats  &MD;  a consumer debt crisis, a sharp
decline in stock prices, a punishing trade deficit. Unemployment
could rise if corporate profits shrank, bringing fresh cost cutting
and layoffs. Some experts even raise the specter of deflation,
which could pull down incomes as well as prices, leaving many
Americans without enough money to pay off their debts.
<p>
   All this sounds unduly pessimistic today, as the good times
continue to roll. But rarely since World War II have so many scary
images infiltrated the forecasts. Even the optimists struggle with
them.
<p>
   ``People are talking of the domino effect: If Korea and Japan
are down, who are we in America to think that our economy can grow,
anyway?'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley,
Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co. ``I hear that line all the time, and I
totally reject it. Over the last two years, the United States
economy has defied seers of an imminent slowdown, and it will again
in 1998.''
<p>
   The Asian currency devaluations and stock market selloffs, the
bankruptcies, bank failures and collapsing consumer demand in that
part of the world have shifted attention from the United States
economy's strengths to its vulnerabilities.
<p>
   Boeing production would be hurt if the downturn were to spread
to China, Singapore and Taiwan, said Lawrence W. Clarkson, a senior
vice president. Quite apart from Boeing, a spreading Asian crisis
could frighten Americans enough that they would stop spending, or
sell their stocks, or do both. So far, neither has happened,
although people have been hearing every day about what the Asian
trouble could do to them. The economy's strengths have prevailed.
<p>
   The gross domestic product grew by nearly 4 percent last year
because of bursts of consumer spending, mostly on credit, and big
outlays by business for new equipment. This rapidly expanding
output of goods and services helped to push corporate profits to
their highest levels since the 1960s.
<p>
   The strong profits, in turn, played a big role in driving up
stock prices, adding to the wealth of tens of millions of American
shareholders and encouraging them to spend. Ample work also gave
people more money and encouragement to spend. The work force grew
by almost three million jobs, the unemployment rate fell to its
lowest levels in years, and weekly wages rose slightly faster than
the inflation rate for a majority of workers.
<p>
   ``For the first time in years, there have been real, broad-based
wage gains,'' said Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic
Policy Institute in Washington. Of course, the wage gains, adjusted
for inflation, do not get typical workers back to what workers
earned in the 1970s and 1980s. But spirits are lifted anyway.
<p>
   ``Consumers judge small income gains more favorably than they
did in the past,'' said Richard Curtin, director of consumer
surveys at the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center.
``Their expectations have fallen. They expect their living
standards to improve, but only in modest increments.''
<p>
   The increments have indeed been modest. Wages have been gaining
ground not so much because of big raises, but in large part because
inflation has been so low  &MD;  less than 2 percent over the last 12
months.
<p>
   The persistently low inflation rate has inhibited the Federal
Reserve from slowing the economy, a step that would halt, in the
process, the gains in wages and jobs.
<p>
   ``Lots of things can happen to the American economy in 1998,''
said David Collander, an economist at Middlebury College, ``but the
most likely thing is that it will keep on growing as long as
inflation does not accelerate and the Fed does not step in.''
<p>
   In the Fed's eyes, a strong economy normally produces shortages.
With demand rising, there are not enough goods and services to go
around. So businesses, in effect, ration what they have by raising
prices. Or they raise prices to pay for wage increases. Either way,
the inflation rate rises or seems about to do so. And the Fed, in
response, slows the economy by raising interest rates to discourage
spending and investment. Often in the past, the Fed has raised
rates too much and recessions have developed.
<p>
   This time, however, the pricing pattern is broken. Prices have
not risen, even as wages have. Despite strong demand, goods and
services are plentiful, not scarce. The Asian crisis plays a role
here. With consumers in Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and
Japan buying less, those countries are exporting more of their
merchandise to the United States, at ever lower costs in dollars,
because their currencies are falling in value.

<p>
   The rising supply of Asian goods comes at a time when U.S.
companies have stepped up production capacity at home. The
machinery and floor space used in domestic production have grown
over the last two years at an annual rate of more than 5 percent,
new government figures show. That is nearly double the growth rate
in the early 1990s.
<p>
   The issue of the year, then, is oversupply. In a number of
industries  &MD;  autos, toys, paper, plastics, textiles, electronics  &MD; 
production outstrips demand. The problem is how to get people to
buy up all that is out there, not to spend less. And the Fed,
partly in recognition, has left interest rates untouched for nearly
a year.
<p>
   ``The global economy desperately needs all the yuppies it can
muster,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell, the Wall Street firm.
<p>
   If they don't meet the challenge, the oversupply will push down
prices, which may be a boon to consumers initially. But deflation
means more than just falling prices. The price declines squeeze
profits. Companies cut back through layoffs and less investment.
Unemployment rises, the economy slows, and wages lose ground.
<p>
   The real deflationary damage kicks in if the value of homes,
cars, stockholdings, and other property bought on credit drops so
much that it is worth less than the debt still owed. With incomes
weakening, people fall behind on their debt payments. Defaults rise
 &MD;  they are frequent even now  &MD;  and the property, often held as
collateral, loses more value. Banks, credit card companies, and
other lenders are hurt. There is less lending, and the crisis
deepens.
<p>
   Low interest rates help to avoid all this by bringing out the
yuppies. Some rates have fallen even without action by the Fed. The
30-year home mortgage, for example, has dropped to around 7
percent, down more than a percentage point in the past year. The
lower rate has stimulated not only home sales and construction but
also demand for appliances, carpeting, furniture and many other
home furnishings. The housing industry and its satellite suppliers
account for nearly 10 percent of the nation's economic activity.
<p>
   The lower mortgage rate means that the payment on a 30-year,
$130,000 loan, the average home loan, has fallen by roughly $100,
to less than $900 a month. Forty percent of all mortgage
applications lately are from home owners who are refinancing
existing mortgages to lower their monthly payments and thus free up
cash for other purposes.
<p>
   ``We are in a mini-refinancing boom, and that is definitely a
kick for the economy,'' said David Lereah, chief economist at the
Mortgage Bankers Association. ``But if mortgage rates stay where
they are, the refinancings and the housing activity will begin to
decline in a couple of months as we run out of people willing to
take advantage of a 7 percent mortgage.''
<p>
   Like many forecasters, Lereah expects the nation's economic
growth rate to decline in 1998 to 2.5 percent, from nearly 4
percent last year. That would still be above the average annual
rate during this recovery, which was weak until the surge in growth
over the last 18 months. And 2.5 percent would still be enough, the
forecasters argue, to keep the unemployment rate low and wages
rising by a bit more than the inflation rate.
<p>
   Their outlook assumes that the economy's strengths, not its
weaknesses, will prevail. But the weaknesses are noteworthy, too.
<p>
   Perhaps the most alarming is household debt, built up through
credit cards, personal loans, mortgages, and other borrowing.
Household debt has risen to record levels today as a percentage of
the personal income available to repay the debt. Measured this way,
the debt load is nearly one-third greater than it ever was in the
1960s, 1970s, or the early 1980s.
<p>
   That makes repayment a problem, and personal bankruptcies are at
a record level. So are credit card defaults. But the greater
danger, some economists say, is that the debt might stop rising.
The rate of growth in household debt is already beginning to slow
as households cut back their borrowing. As they do so, the economy
is deprived of a stimulus that contributed so much to the strong
recent economic growth.
<p>
   Debt has been a source of growth for years. Government borrowing
in the '70s and '80s, evident in the rising national budget
deficit, provided the main stimulus in that era, says Wynne Godley,
an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute. Then, as the government
deficit leveled off and shrank, rising household borrowing took
over the task of stimulating the economy. ``Now if private credit
stops rising, too,'' Godley said, ``the motor is taken away from
the expansion.''
<p>
   Nothing in economics happens in isolation. One dynamic feeds on
another. When consumers cut back on borrowing, spending slows,
production declines, job creation slows, unemployment rises, and
the economy weakens.
<p>
   This downward slide is already mildly evident, some economists
argue. If so, the Asian crisis will reinforce it. Sales by U.S.
companies to Asian buyers are already shrinking. And rising imports
from Asia, at fire sale prices as their currencies weaken, will
chip away at the demand at home for American-made goods. In the
struggle to sell, companies forgo price increases or cut prices,
and corporate profits decline, pulling down stock prices in the
process. Soon, millions of shareholders find a part of their wealth
gone, and they pull back again on borrowing and spending.
<p>
   That prospect focuses a lot of attention on prices. ``The
dominant economic issue this year will be pricing  &MD;  the difficulty
in raising prices  &MD;  and what that will do to profits,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
<p>
   Asia's role in this process shows up, for example, at Varian
Associates, a California-based manufacturer of medical instruments
and equipment for making semiconductors. Varian reports that while
sales in Asia have slowed sharply, a rise in orders in the United
States and Europe, particularly the United States, has more than
offset the Asian drag, and Varian's overall revenue is up  &MD;  for the
time being.
<p>
   ``Fortunately, the International Monetary Fund has stepped into
Asia with its bailout programs,'' J. Tracy O'Rourke, Varian's
chairman, said hopefully. ``Those programs usually work.''
<p>
   For now, his optimism still reflects the view of most
forecasters  &MD;  but by no means all. ``Something will go wrong for
the American economy,'' said Albert M. Wojnilower, an economist at
the Clipper Group, a Wall Street firm, ``but it is too soon yet.''

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Pleading legal restraints, the Museum of Modern Art
has turned down appeals from two families to hold on to two Egon
Schiele paintings whose provenance is clouded by Nazi wartime
plundering, choosing instead to ship them as planned to their next
destination in Barcelona, Spain.
<p>
   But rather than laying the matter temporarily to rest, the
Modern's response enraged the families and prompted them to step up
their activities to reclaim the paintings with entreaties to the
State Department and government officials and possibly pleas in
court.
<p>
   ``We're going ahead with all guns flaring,'' said Rita Reif, an
heir to one of the works. She said her family was seeking a meeting
with the museum's director, Glenn Lowry.
<p>
   The paintings were on view at the Modern as part of ``Egon
Schiele: The Leopold Collection,'' a hugely popular traveling
exhibition that closed at the Modern on Sunday. The works are owned
by the Leopold Foundation, which is financed by the Austrian
government.
<p>
   It purchased them in 1994 from Rudolf Leopold, a 72-year-old
Viennese ophthalmologist who amassed a collection of some 5,400
works of art, including 250 by Schiele, the Austrian Expressionist
who died in 1918.
<p>
   One painting in the show, ``Portrait of Wally,'' is claimed by
the family of Lea Bondi Jaray, a Jewish Viennese art dealer who was
pressed by a Nazi art dealer to leave the work behind when she fled
to London in 1938.
<p>
   The other, ``Dead City,'' is claimed by Ms. Reif and her
sister-in-law, the heirs of Fritz Grunbaum, a Jewish collector who
died at Dachau in 1940. The families wanted the paintings kept in
New York until their claims could be evaluated.
<p>
   But the Modern demurred, citing its contractual obligations to
return the paintings to the foundation.
<p>
   ``The Museum is clearly not in a position to pass on the factual
or legal foundation of your claim,'' said Stephen Clark, an
assistant general counsel for the museum, in a letter faxed
Saturday night to Henry Bondi, the 76-year-old nephew of Mrs.
Bondi. A virtually identical letter was faxed to Ms. Reif, a former
reporter for The New York Times who now contributes a column to the
newspaper.
<p>
   Museum officials said they have had extensive discussions with
their counterparts at the Leopold Foundation since the claims were
lodged last week.
<p>
   ``We explored all options with them,'' said Elizabeth Addison,
the Modern's deputy director for marketing and communications. She
declined to say whether the Modern had specifically asked to keep
the paintings for the time being.
<p>
   The Modern's letters nonetheless obliquely invited further
action, most likely in the courts. ``The museum intends to ship the
painting to the lender on Jan. 8 or shortly thereafter,'' it said
in closing. ``The intervening period should afford you ample time
to take such actions as you deem appropriate to protect your
interests.''
<p>
   Neither family, however, seemed inclined to go to court now,
partly because cultural properties on loan in New York are
indemnified against seizure by state and federal laws. ``Going to
court is a big decision,'' Bondi said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The two families have other plans. They are asking Stuart
Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, for
help in getting the Leopold Foundation or the Austrian government
to post a bond for the value of the two paintings. The bond, held
by a neutral third party, would insure that the paintings would be
returned to the United States after their showing in Barcelona and
pending an assessment of the families' claims.
<p>
   The Reifs plan to present Lowry and the World Jewish Congress'
Commission for Art Recovery with 14 documents supporting their
claim of ownership.
<p>
   ``The Museum of Modern Art is washing its hands of this matter
based on a narrow, tight response to the situation,'' Ms. Reif
said. ``They are saying, `Let the courts decide,' and that's not
enough. The museum must make a moral determination on this.''

<p>
   HOLLYWOOD  &MD;  Nearly two dozen films have opened in recent weeks,
but as far as anyone here is concerned, there are only two movies,
at almost opposite ends of the box office, that have stirred the
town's attention.
<p>
   One of them is James Cameron's ``Titanic.'' The other is Kevin
Costner's ``Postman.''
<p>
   So far, the box office for ``Titanic,'' the 3-hour-14-minute
epic about the doomed luxury liner, has surpassed even the most
optimistic fantasies of the two studios that made it, 20th Century
Fox and Paramount. By this weekend, the film, the most expensive
ever made, is expected to gross about $157 million after three
weeks.
<p>
   ``It's tremendous,'' John Krier, president of the Exhibitor
Relations Company, which monitors the box office, said this
morning. ``It appeals to just about everybody.'' Studio executives
estimate that the film's box office could reach $250 million in the
United States.
<p>
   Yet the film's record budget  &MD;  the studios spent at least $200
million making it, and marketing costs were at least $30 million to
$40 million  &MD;  means the movie may never really make any profit.
<p>
   `` `Titanic' is symptomatic of a fundamental problem in
Hollywood,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan
Associates Inc., a media research and consulting concern. ``This is
the fact that there's an important difference between not losing
money and getting a decent return on your investment. The idea is
to make a lot of money. When all you do is break even on your
biggest film, you do nothing for your bottom line.''
<p>
   Variety said Sunday that the film would have to take in a
mammoth $420 million around the world, just to break even.
<p>
   William Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, which
has the largest investment in ``Titanic,'' was cautious about the
film's financial prospects. (The movie was initially budgeted at
about $110 million, but Cameron almost doubled it once he began
filming.)
<p>
   Asked if the studios would earn money from ``Titanic,'' Mechanic
replied: ``It looks like it. We won't make a fortune, but I think
it will now turn a profit and at least return its investment. It's
way too expensive to be very profitable. But it's a very, very
important film for our library now.''
<p>
   He said the scale of the response to the film amazed him. ``What
audiences keep saying is that they've never quite seen anything
like it,'' he said. ``And aside from the film, there's something
about the Titanic itself as a cultural icon that fascinates people.
There's the Broadway musical, the documentary, books. You can't
stop this Titanic stuff.''
<p>
   Marvin Antonowsky, a veteran marketing expert, put it another
way. ``As spectacles go, `Titanic' has what films like `English
Patient' and `Out of Africa' didn't have: a young love story. When
you have this, you get young and old audiences. This is what's
pushing `Titanic.' The others got mostly the 35-plus audience. This
is getting the 17- and 18-year-olds as well as the older crowd.''
(The stars of ``Titanic,'' are Leonardo DiCaprio, as an
impoverished artist, and Kate Winslet, as a rich unhappy young
woman, who fall in love aboard the ship.)
<p>
   Trailing far behind ``Titanic,'' which is No. 1, are several
films that are considered highly successful by theater owners and
studios. These films include Disney's ``Flubber''; the new James
Bond opus, ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' and the Miramax teen-age horror
movie ``Scream 2.''
<p>
   At the opposite end of the box office is one of the biggest
disasters in years, ``The Postman,'' a movie in which Kevin Costner
(who starred, directed, and co-produced the film) plays an ordinary
man in the year 2013 who tries to restore civilization to a
devastated United States by delivering old letters he's found.
<p>
   Costing at least $80 million and an estimated $35 million to
market, ``The Postman,'' in its second week, has not even made the
top 10 list. It has taken in an estimated $14.6 million and is
slipping. The film runs nearly three hours, and as disasters go, it
ranks with such huge losers as ``Cutthroat Island,'' the 1995
adventure that lost more than $100 million.
<p>
   Several marketing executives said privately that the very
concept of the film  &MD;  a postman who saves the day in a
post-apocalyptic world  &MD;  was a turn-off to audiences. ``The concept
was impossible to grasp,'' Gerbrandt said. ``There was from the
beginning negative word of mouth that tends to spread. In contrast
to `Titanic,' there was no appeal there.''
<p>
   In fairness to Warner Brothers, which made the film, Costner's
1990 directorial debut, ``Dances With Wolves,'' brought home seven
Oscars, including best picture and best director, and took in $424
million around the world, making it one of the most successful
movies in recent years. But Costner's 1995 epic ``Waterworld,''
(which he did not direct) and that bears some resemblance to ``The
Postman,'' was a big failure.
<p>
   For Warner Brothers, one of the most successful and stable
studios in town, ``The Postman'' was another setback in a year that
saw a string of financial losers like ``Father's Day,'' ``Mad
City'' and ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''
<p>
   But some financial analysts tended to play down the studio's
recent track record. ``Every year you end up with two or three
major films that didn't work, and this year it's `The Postman,' ''
said Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment analyst at Cruttenden Roth,
financial investment bankers. ``Every company goes through cycles,
and this year it's Warner Brothers' turn to perform in a less
admirable manner than they have in the last few years. They've had
some good years, and now a bad year. They'll get over it.''

<p>
   As she breezes into her office, Chelsea Stevens greets her staff
with a trilling voice and a stream-of-consciousness message Martha
Stewart might envy. ``This morning before breakfast, while I was
restocking my trout pond and milking my goat, I realized how much I
wanted to tell all of you how much I appreciate all the hard work
you do,'' she begins. ``But then later, when I was airing out my
quilt and making prosciutto jerky, I reminded myself we can always
work harder!''
<p>
   In the new satire ``Style and Substance,'' Chelsea Stevens (Jean
Smart) is an unmistakable Martha Stewart type, a style czar whose
empire includes a magazine, a television show and books. Ms.
Stewart is, of course, an irresistible target. But those who
wondered how this CBS sitcom could satirize her, one of the
network's own stars, will find the answer all too easily. Chelsea's
breathless greeting offers the first and last pointed lines in a
comedy so lacking an edge that it is more a valentine than a
parody.
<p>
   The original Martha Stewart seems so serenely above it all that
she has halfheartedly mocked that image in credit-card commercials.
Even if Chelsea Stevens is merely an aspiring Stewart, she needs
that wonderwoman hauteur. But Ms. Smart plays her as the
emotionally poor little rich girl, as if the actress can't wait to
let Chelsea's likable side burst through.
<p>
   That is the pitfall of so many television satires: The rule is
that recurring characters have to become likable sooner or later.
But does it have to happen this soon? ``Style and Substance'' takes
all of half an hour to show that Chelsea is a softy.
<p>
   As if that weren't dreary enough, she has softhearted company in
her producer and office manager, Jane (Nancy McKeon in an
uncommonly whiny performance). Chelsea has just been divorced; Jane
has just arrived from Omaha, leaving a fiance behind.
<p>
   The women bond. ``You're nice; you care about people,'' Chelsea
tells Jane. ``How do you do that?'' They eat Hostess Snowballs
together; that junk-food bonding ritual is the ultimate sign that
Chelsea is a nice person too. Maybe nice works in life, but it's a
horrible idea in satire, and it leaves this series with nowhere to
go.
<p>
   Of course, there are a few minor misunderstandings before the
women become friends. Jane flings an insult at Chelsea. ``You are a
weirdsmobile,'' she says. Truly, any series that lets
``weirdsmobile'' pass for wit is in such disrepair Martha Stewart
herself couldn't fix it.

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy should remain on
a ``non-inflationary'' track as it slows to a ``moderate'' rate of
growth this year, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin said.
<p>
   ``The U.S. economy is highly likely to slow to a more moderate
rate in early 1998,'' Rivlin said, speaking at the American
Economic Association's annual meeting.
<p>
   The recent economic turmoil in Asia should put ``downward
pressure'' on U.S. import prices, helping to contain inflation, she
said.
<p>
   Specifically, falling U.S. exports to Asia should cut U.S. gross
domestic product by 1/2 percentage point this year, she said.
Rivlin didn't offer a specific forecast for U.S. growth in 1998.
<p>
   Still, she said, it's ``clearly too soon to tell'' what the
precise impact of an expected slowdown in Asia will be on the U.S.
economy.
<p>
   Rivlin sits on the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee, which sets interest rate policy. Fed policymakers, who
meet next on Feb. 3-4, have left the overnight bank lending rate at
5.50 percent since raising it by a quarter point last March.
<p>
   Recent economic reports have vindicated the Fed's steady stance.
For example, the National Association of Purchasing Management said
its closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing cooled in December
as Asia's economic crisis depressed U.S. exports. Factory orders
and production also sagged from a month earlier.
<p>
   The NAPM's index declined to 52.5 last month -- the lowest
reading since January 1997 -- from 54.4 in November. A reading of
50 or more in the NAPM index means manufacturing is expanding,
while a reading below 50 signals a contraction.
<p>
   In another reassuring sign for the Fed, the NAPM prices paid
index fell to 50.3 in December from 51.9 during November. The
government's main price gauges have shown all year that inflation
remains in check.
<p>
   The consumer price index rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate in
the first 11 months of 1997, well below the 3.3 percent gain
recorded in the first 11 months of the previous year. That leaves
consumer price inflation on track for the best performance since
1986.
<p>
   Price increases have been so tame that Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan even suggested yesterday that the next battle for U.S.
central bankers may be to combat the effects of falling prices.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider
at what point effective price stability has been reached,''
Greenspan told the same annual meeting of U.S. economists.
``Indeed, some observers have begun to question whether deflation
is now a possibility, and to assess the potential difficulties such
a development might pose for the economy.''
<p>
   Greenspan didn't say whether he agrees with analysts who say
deflation is coming, and he refrained as usual from any direct
mention of the Fed's interest-rate policy.
<p>
   The idea of deflation comes amid turmoil in Asia's economies,
which Fed officials expect will further slow U.S. growth. ``The
worst may be over, but we're clearly in for a period of much weaker
growth in Asia, which we expect will impact very heavily on the
United States,'' Rivlin said in a Zurich speech on Dec. 9.

<p>
   Los Angeles, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- News Corp. and Viacom Inc.'s
``Titanic'' grossed $32.2 million to claim the No. 1 spot at the
U.S. and Canadian box office for a third weekend, as the studios
seem likely to profit from history's most expensive film.
<p>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.'s latest James Bond film, ``Tomorrow
Never Dies,'' grossed a healthy $14.1 million over the weekend, on
its way to becoming the most profitable film ever in the secret
agent's $2 billion-plus franchise.
<p>
   With its costs capped at $65 million, Viacom's Paramount
Pictures got the better end of its ``Titanic'' co-venture with News
Corp.'s 20th Century Fox, which covered most of the film's $200
million in production costs.
<p>
   ``Paramount's going to make a huge profit on a film for which
they had little creative input, and Fox has a shot at actually
making a profit,'' said Arthur Rockwell of Yaeger Capital Markets,
who has a ``hold'' rating on Viacom and a ``long-term buy'' rating
on News Corp.
<p>
   Analysts expect Fox's investment to pay off if the film about
modern shipping's biggest disaster meets analyst projections of
$500 million to $700 million in worldwide ticket sales. The film
has pulled in a total of $156.4 million over its first three weeks.
The figure is all the more impressive because the film is more than
three hours long, limiting the number of times it can be shown in a
day.
<p>
   The studios are splitting equally the domestic and international
grosses of the film. Studios typically keep about half of theater
receipts, with theater owners keeping the other half.
<p>
   For MGM, ``Tomorrow's'' weekend gross pushes its three-week take
to $93.2 million, making it virtually certain that the film will
top the roughly $100 million that its predecessor, ``GoldenEye,''
made. The film's success, demonstrating that the more than
30-year-old franchise still appeals to 1990s audiences, came
despite its being panned by many critics.
<p>
   The hit is a badly needed boost to the fortunes of MGM, which
went public in November and hasn't made a profit since 1988. Still,
the studio, acquired last year by an investor group controlled by
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, is expected to lose money for a few
years until it builds up its film slate.
<p>
   MGM ``achieved their goal, which was to have a successful major
film release right after their IPO,'' said analyst Harold Vogel of
Cowen &AMP; Co. ``In terms of profits, there's nothing to write home
about yet.''
<p>
   Sony Corp.'s comedy ``As Good as It Gets,'' starring Jack
Nicholson, grossed $12.3 million to take the No. 3 slot in its
second weekend, continuing a winning streak that made Sony Pictures
the top-grossing studio in 1997. The weekend's results brings the
film's two-week gross to $40.9 million.
<p>
   DreamWorks SKG's ``MouseHunt'' grossed $8.7 million for fourth
place in its third week, bringing its total to $40.3 million. While
the showing makes it likely that the fledgling studio will recoup
its $50 million-plus investment, it was less than some analysts had
expected.
<p>
   In its fourth week, DreamWorks' slave drama ``Amistad'' grossed
$4.7 million for seventh place and a total of $27 million. Director
Steven Spielberg has released the film to only 726 screens
nationwide so far in a bid to build a strong word-of-mouth that
will improve its Oscar prospects.
<p>
   Walt Disney Co.'s low-budget horror film ``Scream 2,'' from its
Miramax Films unit, grossed $8 million for fifth place, bringing
its four-week take to $86.2 million. The film's success continues a
strong holiday showing by Disney, highlighted by hits such as
``Flubber,'' which grossed $4.5 million for ninth place over the
weekend. It's brought in $83.2 million in six weeks.
<p>
   Among other Disney films, director Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie
Brown,'' also distributed by Miramax, grossed $7.7 million over the
weekend for seventh place and a total of $27.5 million in two
weeks. Horror film ``An American Werewolf in Paris'' grossed $4.6
million over the weekend for eighth place and a total of $20.2
million in two weeks.
<p>
   One of Disney's few holiday disappointments, ``Mr. Magoo,'' took
in $4.4 million for the No. 10 slot and a two-week take of $15.8
million.
<p>
   Time Warner Inc.'s ``The Postman,'' the latest post-apocalyptic
epic from star Kevin Costner, continued to drag down the fortunes
of Warner Bros., falling out of the top 10 on a gross of $3.5
million. The film has generated $14.6 million in two weeks, capping
the studio's worst performance since 1990.
<p>
   Based on the weekend's top 10 films, Viacom and News Corp. both
grossed $16.1 million, taking into account their split of
``Titanic'' box office revenue. MGM grossed $14.1 million, Disney
grossed $22.2 million, Sony grossed $12.3 million and DreamWorks
grossed $13.4 million.
<p>
   Warner Bros. and Seagram Co.'s Universal studio failed to place
a film in the top 10 this weekend.

   Maybe it was because the big Brahms year just past, with the
100th anniversary of the composer's death, came too soon after the
one before, 1983, with the 150th anniversary of his birth, and
there just wasn't that much new to say. Whatever the reason,
performances concentrated mainly on the familiar masterpieces,
yielding few revelations. And now two books bringing down the
curtain offer mostly material that has long been available, though
not necessarily in English.
<p>
   Jan Swafford, a composer and the author of the acclaimed
``Charles Ives: A Life With Music,'' presents a sprawling portrait
of Brahms heavily based on earlier publications, from the
biographies of Max Kalbeck (1904-14) and Florence May (1905) to
recent studies, all liberally interpreted. Styra Avins, a cellist
and teacher, serves up a rich compilation of Brahms correspondence,
mostly the composer's own writings, in translations carried out
with her husband, Josef Eisinger, a retired professor of
physiology.
<p>
   The books duplicate each other substantially, and much of the
material in both will be familiar to Brahmsians on any level. Yet
nonspecialists will find at least one revelation, which calls into
question a beloved bit of Brahms lore, and it comes early in Ms.
Avins' book.
<p>
   ``Even if Brahms himself speaks of having `played the piano at
night in bars,' '' Ms. Avins quotes the German scholar Kurt Hofmann
as having written, ``it is out of the question that these were
disreputable saloons.''
<p>
   Set alongside Swafford's book, this seemingly innocuous claim is
little short of a bombshell. It challenges the notion, established
by Kalbeck and still widely accepted, that Brahms, for several
months beginning before his 13th birthday, was forced by his
ignorant and impoverished parents to play piano through the night
in cheap brothels surrounding the nearby docks in his native
Hamburg.
<p>
   ``Not only is there no evidence that Brahms played in low-class
dives of the sailors' quarter (which was in the outlying area of
St. Pauli, while Brahms lived in the city near the Alster
Pavilion),'' Ms. Avins writes, ``there is also no evidence, only
perpetuated rumor, that Brahms played anywhere at all before he was
14 years old.''
<p>
   What makes the point significant is that Swafford, like others
before him in varying degrees, sees this supposed bit of biography
as a cornerstone of Brahms' personality, aloof, misogynistic and
often crude, and presents it as a recurring theme. ``The effects
... on him were deep and indelible,'' Swafford writes. ``The abuse
he suffered in dives was a kind of tragedy; it created a dangerous
fissure in his psyche. ... In ways both clear and unsearchable, the
Singing Girls marked and molded what he became, and so molded his
art.''
<p>
   Or not. The Hofmann quote, along with other information
suggesting that the setting of Brahms' childhood was far less
squalid and impoverished than commonly thought (``brutal, the kind
of thing of which Dickens made a dark poetry,'' in Swafford's
words), comes from Hofmann's book ``Johannes Brahms und Hamburg,''
as issued in 1986. Swafford's failure to address this material,
though his bibliography lists a Hofmann opus from 1993, is a
devastating lapse.
<p>
   Still, Swafford proves an interesting guide through Brahms'
life. And his penetrating eye finds undercurrents in the
correspondence that elude Ms. Avins: mounting tensions in the
relationship between Brahms and Robert Schumann's widow, Clara, for
example, even before they broke off their romance.
<p>
   Swafford does not go easy on his subject. He lays a heavy
responsibility on Brahms in relation to the death of the addled
Robert Schumann in 1856. Schumann spent more than two years in an
asylum following a suicide attempt, and, Swafford suggests, he
settled on a course of slow starvation after, among other things, a
``too candid'' letter from Brahms in late 1854, lamenting Clara's
absence on a performing tour as pianist.
<p>
   ``How long the separation from your wife seemed to me!'' the
21-year-old Brahms wrote to the languishing older composer, whose
home he had largely made his own. ``I had grown so used to her
uplifting presence and had spent such a magnificent summer with
her. I had grown to admire and love her so much that everything
else seemed empty to me, and I could only long to see her again.''
<p>
   Astonishingly, among the 564 letters she publishes, including
six from Brahms to Schumann, Ms. Avins does not print this one: by
Swafford's interpretation, perhaps the most important Brahms ever
wrote.
<p>
   On the other hand, Ms. Avins casts doubt on the starvation
theory of Schumann's death, citing persuasive evidence of tertiary
syphilis, as revealed in a 1994 publication by Aribert Reimann and
Franz Hermann Franken. Again, Swafford, who rejects syphilis as a
cause of Schumann's death, makes no mention of that publication.
<p>
   In addition to substantial discussions of Brahms' music (seldom
demanding much technical knowledge of the reader), Swafford
provides a rich historical context. His analysis of Brahms'
performing career as pianist and conductor is especially
fascinating, pointing up areas pertinent to the concert scene
today.
<p>
   Brahms did not initiate the revival of early music, but he
carried the exploration forward (which is to say, backward). What's
more, his historical cast of mind and conservative tastes led him
to look back to the future in another way, pioneering in the
programming of works by dead masters. He thus contributed
substantially, Swafford suggests, to ``the split between composers
and the middle-class audience ..., a defining, initially freeing,
ultimately debilitating condition of modernism.''
<p>
   But some of the book's length results from sheer unnecessary
repetition, and the production strains at the seams with, among
other things, wholesale misnumberings of footnotes.
<p>
   The length of Ms. Avins' book is better justified by her welcome
inclusiveness. Under her ministrations, Brahms reveals himself in
workaday as well as transcendent moods. He is, as always, a bundle
of contradictions: gruff and tender, mean-spirited and magnanimous,
lonely and independent, reactionary and progressive, petty and
grand.
<p>
   To preserve his own voice as much as possible, the translations
try to retain the rough edges of his careless prose style, perhaps
to a fault. Clunkiness does not translate literally from one
language to another any more than elegance does.
<p>
   Ms. Avins' own contributions are terse and often illuminating.
Although she could not hope to provide a complete biography in the
interstices, she supplies fascinating illustrations, a helpful
chronological table and other tools.
<p>
   Still, the reader does not always know where to expect
explication of obscure references in the letters: whether in the
text preceding or following, in footnotes on the page or additional
notes at the back of the book, or in the section of biographical
sketches. Occasionally, after all that, the information is nowhere
to be found.
<p>
   In all biography, uncertainties, ambiguities and mysteries
abound. In the case of Brahms, such problems are multiplied. The
composer systematically destroyed not only his inferior works and
the early traces of his published ones but also letters and other
documents, all with the purpose of covering his own tracks and
confining the historical record to whatever his finished music
might have to say.
<p>
   Happily, the two books together give a pretty thorough picture
of what escaped his vandal grasp.

<p>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  &MD;  To Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, the new Kansas City
Jazz Museum, which opened in a historically important but long
abandoned neighborhood in September, is a symbol of optimism and
hope.
<p>
   With a vivid, contemporary design and a collection centered on
four jazz giants  &MD;  Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald
and Charlie Parker  &MD;  and a live jazz club included under its roof,
it is the first major museum in the country devoted to jazz,
intended to serve both as a monument to the music that flourished
here in the 1920s, '30s and '40s and as a spur to redevelopment in
the neighborhood that nurtured it.
<p>
   ``What this property has successfully done,'' Cleaver said in an
interview, ``is transcend the obstacles of race, geography and
ethnicity. It is the kind of thing we need to replicate.''
<p>
   But to Eddie Baker, a local bandleader and a leading advocate
for the recognition of jazz masters who calls the new museum an
embarrassment, it represents nothing but a disappointment, not even
a shadow of what it could have been. At a mere 10,000 square feet,
Baker points out, it is too small. Besides, he says, its exhibits
are too rudimentary, it excludes too many musicians, it is not
interactive enough and it doesn't even have its own building,
really. It shares the place with the Negro Baseball Hall of Fame.
<p>
   ``It's being run by politicians who don't even own a record
player,'' Baker said. ``It's evident jazz wasn't important to this
mayor or anybody else.''
<p>
   Baker, president of the Charlie Parker Memorial Foundation,
which provides music and dance classes for underprivileged
children, is not alone in his dissatisfaction. At a time when
cities all over the country are building arts centers to rejuvenate
blighted neighborhoods, other people in jazz have also questioned
whether museums should be built primarily to encourage economic
activity.
<p>
   Shouldn't the emphasis be placed on honoring and preserving
artistic achievement? No one, not even Baker, thinks the new museum
here is a bad thing. But it has aggravated the persistent wound
felt by many jazz musicians, who say that theirs is an artistic
contribution that has been too easily shunted aside and never
adequately acknowledged.
<p>
   Indeed, jazz, now about 100 years old, is among the signal
contributions of 20th century America to world culture. Yet there
are few substantial music collections beyond those at the Institute
of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., and the Marr
Sound Archives at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, and
until now there has been no real monument to the music and the
musicians.
<p>
   ``We need all the help we can get, to say the least,'' said Max
Roach, the legendary drummer, who was a consultant for the new
museum and argued that this should be the first of many homes for
jazz. ``It's not supposed to have one home,'' he said. ``Art Blakey
used to say, `Jazz is as American as apple pie.' We should have
shrines all over the country.''
<p>
   Plans for such shrines have arisen before and continue to. Art
D'Lugoff, for example, the former owner of the Village Gate, the
New York jazz club, is seeking financing for a complex on the
Hudson River that would include a museum, a school, a store and a
New Orleans-style cafe. The absence of any such center has long
been a thorn in the side of jazz practitioners, particularly black
musicians who regard their lack of recognition as a lingering
reminder of racism.
<p>
   The sting has only been more acute since the opening of the
Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1995, celebrating a
younger and more widely popular musical form whose practitioners
have, over all, included more whites than those of jazz.
<p>
   ``This is long overdue,'' said Leonard Brown, a saxophonist and
professor of jazz history at Northeastern University in Boston, who
was a consultant for the Kansas City museum. ``It's wonderful to
walk in there just to see finally that the contributions of some of
those African-Americans are getting the recognition they deserve.''
<p>
   This debate is the source of Baker's objections to the new
museum. Under his guidance, the Parker Foundation has long sought
financial support to build a memorial to jazz music and musicians
known as the International Jazz Hall of Fame.
<p>
   Since 1977, when Baker copyrighted the name, it has existed as
an organization without an edifice, with a total of 75 inductees,
having held its fourth induction ceremony in Tampa, Fla., in
November. His dream has been to build, in Kansas City, an
institution that would house not only a museum but also a jazz
academy and a retirement community for jazz masters.
<p>
   Indeed, all those elements were initially considered, but as the
budget grew and the political squabbling over the project grew more
vociferous, the plan shrank. ``The city wanted to build a building
and really wanted to capitalize on the entertainment we could bring
to it,'' said Shakura Sabor, the executive director of the Jazz
Hall of Fame. ``That was the cart before the horse, as far as we
were concerned. It should be of benefit to the artists first.''

<p>
   Supporters of the new Kansas City museum tend to dismiss Baker
as embittered because he ended up with little or no influence in
the development of the project. But over the years, Baker's own
vision has had the active support of jazz legends like Dizzy
Gillespie and Lionel Hampton. And, more pertinent, of Aaron A.
Woodward III, the adopted son of Count Basie, the musician who,
more than any other, was responsible for the style of jazz known as
Kansas City swing.
<p>
   Basie died in 1984, but the band is still active; it won its
16th Grammy award last spring. Woodward is now its executive
director, and in part because of his disappointment with the new
museum, he has withheld permission for anything connected to Basie
not in the public domain to be included in the exhibits.
<p>
   As a result, there is a prominent hole at the center of the
collection. ``They had the opportunity to create the worldwide home
of jazz,'' Woodward said. ``I don't consider that to be a jazz
museum. Why would you build something not comparable to the skill
of those it was supposed to honor?''
<p>
   There is no disputing that the museum as it exists is a result
of political compromise. In 1989 the Kansas City government, as
part of a citywide redevelopment initiative known as the Cleaver
plan, allotted $20 million to build a jazz museum at 18th and Vine
streets, the heart of the club district that produced not only
Basie and Parker but other jazz greats like Jay McShann, Ben
Webster and Benny Moten.
<p>
   But critics of the mayor opposed the plan on the basis of its
financing (a high-interest bond issue) and its location, a largely
black area in the eastern part of the city that had long been in
decline. Though Kansas City itself is in something of a boom time,
having eclipsed St. Louis as the largest city in the state, the
region east of Troost Avenue, which Cleaver described as ``our
Mason-Dixon line, unfortunately,'' remains somewhat neglected.
<p>
   Indeed, though Sprint has opened an office across the street
from the museum and Cleaver says 125 other businesses have applied
for permits to open in the neighborhood, the immediate area is
still empty enough that the museum itself has erected phony facades
for the storefronts on the block. In addition, the film set used by
Robert Altman for ``Kansas City,'' his 1995 evocation of the
neighborhood's jazz heyday, remains intact just around the corner,
unlighted and undisturbed.
<p>
   ``I have long believed that until we are able to develop the
east side, Kansas City could not boast of having its big inning,''
Cleaver said. By all accounts, the mayor spent his political
capital heavily to erect the museum on 18th and Vine, his
determination symbolized in 1994 when he used $140,000 of public
money to buy, at auction, the famous acrylic saxophone used by
Charlie Parker, as a cornerstone of the museum's collection.
<p>
   In the end, the mayor prevailed, but much of the final budget,
$26 million, ended up being used for the kinds of redevelopment
amenities, like a visitors' center, that critics say detract from
the artistic purpose of the museum.
<p>
   Critics point out as well that an executive director, Rowena
Stewart, was not hired until January 1996, when the Parker
saxophone was still nearly the only artifact the museum owned, and
that neither Ms. Stewart, a career museum administrator whose last
post was as head of the Motown Historical Museum in Detroit, nor
those who hastily assembled the museum's collection are
musicologists.
<p>
   Unfortunately, the saxophone turned out to be a hindrance to
assembling the collection. Both Ms. Stewart and Lina Stephens, her
assistant, who gathered most of the museum's 8,000 pieces, said
collectors were loath to donate or lend memorabilia to an
institution that they assumed, because of the notoriety of the
saxophone purchase, had a great deal of money to spend. In reality,
the collection budget, after that purchase, was only about
$100,000.
<p>
   The museum is small, to be sure, and its collection, assembled
after the design was already complete, has a catch-as-catch-can
feel to it. For example, Billie Holiday was initially chosen, by a
panel of consulting musicians and scholars, as one of the four
masters at the heart of the collection, but when memorabilia of
Holiday's life proved difficult to collect, Ms. Stewart decided to
replace her with Ella Fitzgerald.
<p>
   Nonetheless, the museum includes a number of listening stations
and an interactive exhibit that instructs neophytes on the
fundamentals of jazz rhythms, orchestrations, improvisations and
the like. In addition, the adjoining club, which features live
performances by local musicians four nights a week, is adorned with
memorabilia celebrating the tradition of jazz in Kansas City.
<p>
   And as part of the project, across the street, an old,
once-segregated movie house, the Gem Theater, has been refurbished
into a 500-seat performance hall.
<p>
   ``For its size and the materials they do have, they've done some
remarkable stuff,'' Ms. Sabor of the hall of fame said. ``But it
just doesn't have the majesty of what the art form is about. It was
too much of a compromise.''
<p>
   Ms. Stewart acknowledged that much of the criticism had merit;
that in particular, having just four jazz masters is not enough  &MD; 
there will be more, she promised  &MD;  and that ``the place will not be
complete until Count Basie is included.'' But she said she wished
the critics would be patient and supportive; the growth of the
museum depends on public support, she said, and on whether the
neighborhood development plans are realized.
<p>
   Some prominent local musicians have taken that attitude to
heart, expressing the sentiment that the current museum is far
better than no museum at all. Among these is Jay McShann, the
pianist, now 82 (or so he said; according to ``The Encyclopedia of
Jazz,'' by Leonard Feather, he was born in 1909), who first came to
Kansas City in 1937 and who played a concert at the museum on New
Year's Eve.
<p>
   ``If a guy does you a nice favor, all you can say is thank
you,'' McShann said, referring to Cleaver. ``Maybe things could've
been done a little differently, but the fact is he got it done.
Ain't nothing to do but go along with the scene, I guess.''

<p>
   Congress is once again moving toward the most sweeping overhaul
of the United States' patents law in 45 years, but it is unclear
whether the legislation will receive final approval this year.
<p>
   The patents bill has been held up for several years, in part
because of heavy opposition from some inventors. Last year it was
passed by the House and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The bill would make four key changes:
<p>
    &MD;  It would broaden the rights of third parties to initiate a
full-fledged re-examination by the Patent and Trademark Office of
patents that have already been issued. ``Currently, in most
circumstances you have to go to court,'' said Jay Thomas, an
associate professor of law at George Washington University. ``This
would turn Patent Office officials into judges and is similar to
what other countries do. The question is: Can the U.S. Patent
Office handle this responsibility?''
<p>
    &MD;  It would require the publication of patent applications after
18 months; now they are kept secret until the patent is issued.
``The idea is that you enrich the bank of technology information,
no matter what the fate of an individual patent,'' Thomas said. An
amendment tacked on in the House would exempt independent inventors
and universities from this provision, thereby creating ``a lot of
loopholes,'' he said.
<p>
    &MD;  It would give greater rights to those who, instead of seeking
a patent, protect their technology as a trade secret. Under current
law, those who keep their ideas trade secrets are considered
infringers once a patent on similar technology is issued to someone
else; the infringer must either stop using it or pay royalties to
the patent holder. ``Right now, winner takes all,'' Thomas said.
``This would spread the wealth by allowing trade-secret users to
keep using the technology without penalty.''
<p>
    &MD;  It would recast the Patent Office as a semiprivate corporation
much like the U.S. Postal Service, on the theory that it would be
run more efficiently.
<p>
   The legislation has faced spirited opposition from many
independent inventors, whose symbolic leader was Jerome Lemelson,
an inventor who had been granted about 500 patents and successfully
challenged several companies with infringement suits. Lemelson died
last fall, but inventor groups say that his absence will not
diminish the opposition to the patent bill.
<p>
   Alexander Fraser, president of the Inventors Network of the
Capital Area, said the most troublesome aspect of the legislation
was the part that would make the office a semiprivate corporation,
with a board of directors from the private sector.
<p>
   Fraser posed this hypothetical situation: ``Imagine that you are
a patent examiner and I come along with my new transistor that will
cut Sony's profits by 50 percent. Sony has a member on the board
controlling the corporation. Is the examiner going to give me my
patent?''
<p>
   Bruce Lehman, the commissioner of patents and trademarks, who
initiated much of the patent legislation, called such fears
``absolutely ridiculous.''
<p>
   ``In fact it's quite the opposite,'' he said. ``Politics would
be taken out of the Patent Office, to the extent that it is here.''
<p>
   Two important decisions are expected this year from the U.S.
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals:
<p>
    &MD;  In re Zurko. This case turns on a narrow technical issue that
has much broader implications about how much deference should be
made to previous Patent Office rulings when the appeals court
decides to hear a case.
<p>
    &MD;  State Street Bank and Trust Co. vs. Signature Financial Group
regarding a patent for a financial-management technique. This
long-awaited ruling should help establish what types of business
practices can be patented. ``A lot of patents are issuing that
people are starting to get embarrassed about,'' said Thomas, who
cited as examples a recent patent covering a way to swing a golf
club and another that covers a method of remodeling a home.
``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``the delay in the ruling doesn't bode
well'' for a decisive opinion.

<p>
   BEIJING  &MD;  Qi Bingyi has been fighting a quintessentially
present-day Beijing battle, but his real war is with the past and
involves a quixotic quest for amends.
<p>
   From his homey walled redoubt, he watches the bulldozers, cranes
and drills that rattle and whir on every side, transforming a
neighborhood of dilapidated single-story homes into high-rise
apartments.
<p>
   For now, at least, he has saved the compound, the place where
his brilliant grandfather painted. With the help of a sympathetic
article in a local newspaper, he persuaded the city and reluctant
real estate developers to grant a reprieve.
<p>
   ``Old Home of Qi Baishi,'' says the plaque on the front of the
traditional-style compound, a quadrangle with tiled-roof buildings
surrounding a courtyard, and it is signed by the Relic Protection
Work Unit of Beijing.
<p>
   Perhaps China's best-known 20th-century painter, Qi Baishi
(pronounced chee baishir) created simple, vibrant ink-wash studies
of flowers, birds and crayfish that often grace calendars and
greeting cards here. He died in 1957, in his 90s, after owning this
compound for nearly 40 years.
<p>
   The current Qi makes a modest living selling his own paintings
but lists himself on his name card as ``Grandson of the Famous
Artist Qi Baishi.'' Inside the compound, chain-smoking on a frigid,
smoggy day, the 48-year-old grandson speaks with a smile and
twinkling eyes and frequently jumps up to answer calls on his
cellular phone. Soon enough, though, the festering rage comes out.
<p>
   Though he admits to pleasure at fending off the developers, Qi
knows that his victory may not mean much unless he can raise a lot
of money to restore the house and make it worth preserving. And
that is where past wrongs, current anger and future hopes all come
together. He speaks with sharp candor that is rarely heard these
days in public.
<p>
   ``The Nationalists, the Japanese, the Americans never broke into
my house and stole things,'' he says, referring to one-time
combatants and invaders. ``Only when the great Communist Party was
in power did people come here and steal precious things.''
<p>
   His obsession is with the Cultural Revolution, the venomous
decade of persecutions and upheavals that started in 1966. In that
year, Red Guards  &MD;  rampaging students fired up by Mao's call for
permanent revolution  &MD;  came to trash the house, humiliate the
family and steal paintings and other mementos.
<p>
   Seized artworks were supposed to become public property, but
many vanished, most into private homes and some into government
cellars, says Qi, adding, without specifics or proof, that he knows
of officials who partook of the booty.
<p>
   In earlier, less virulent days, an admiring Mao had asked for
paintings from Qi Baishi, and Premier Zhou Enlai visited the house
to receive his own. After the artist's death, the family also
donated many fine paintings to the Culture Ministry on the promise
of a special museum. It never was built, but the artworks remain
with the ministry.
<p>
   Then came the Red Guards. Neither Mao nor Zhou did anything to
stop the degradation of a family that was suspect because it had
beautiful things and ample quarters. Three other families were
moved into the compound  &MD;  one of them still shares it today with Qi
and his relatives  &MD;  and for 12 dreary years, Qi was banished to
farms and construction sites in the provinces.
<p>
   Ever since he moved back in 1978, Qi has called for answers. He
wants the government to pay compensation and to bring back those
stolen paintings. He insists that with effort, many could be
traced.
<p>
   Just as much, it seems, he wants someone to take responsibility
for what happened.
<p>
   ``Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin say they still uphold the banner
of Mao,'' Qi said, referring to the late and current national
leaders. ``Well, the Cultural Revolution was Mao's, and so now they
should compensate me.''
<p>
   Though nearly everyone was scarred by the turmoil, the open call
for a reckoning is seldom heard these days.
<p>
   As Deng Xiaoping gained power in the late 1970s, he fostered
criticism of the Cultural Revolution but steered blame to the
``Gang of Four,'' a once-powerful cabal, including Mao's wife,
Jiang Qing, that was arrested after Mao's death in 1976. Deng urged
the Chinese to look ahead and get busy making money, which many
did.
<p>
   For the Communist Party, weighing the responsibility of the
founding father himself has never been easy. Mao made serious
mistakes, it is said, but then, too, his picture still presides
over Tiananmen Square.
<p>
   Now Qi has practical as well as emotional reasons for dredging
up a past that so many would just as soon forget.
<p>
   He has hoped for years to make the house into a self-sustaining
museum. It would help to get back more art  &MD;  he has only a handful
of Qi Baishi's works, rolled up in a crude safe in his living room.
<p>
   But in truth, the compound right now seems barely worth saving.
<p>
   During the Cultural Revolution, to accommodate the strangers who
crowded in, some walls that once divided parts of the courtyard,
including one with an elegant round doorway, were torn down. Qi now
lives in a red brick home he built when he first returned  &MD;  in the
middle of the courtyard.
<p>
   The original buildings are in serious disrepair. Even the stone
mythical beasts meant to guard the entrance are missing, broken off
their foundations by Red Guards who saw them as symbols of
feudalism.
<p>
   So Qi is looking for money to restore the compound to its
traditional essence. He estimates that for perhaps $400,000 he
could carry out the renovation, subcontracting for architects and
artisans. He has, he says with a grin, a lot of experience at
construction.

<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand  &MD;  Unconfirmed reports are circulating here and
in Cambodia that the Khmer Rouge founder, Pol Pot, may have fled
his jungle stronghold in that country, perhaps to take refuge in
China.
<p>
   The sources of the reports were shaky and the Chinese government
denied Sunday that Pol Pot was there. But the reports have aroused
interest at a time of disputes, defections and realignments within
the brutal communist insurgency.
<p>
   At least a million Cambodians died during the years the Pol
Pot-led Khmer Rouge was in power in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979.
Last summer, Pol Pot's former comrades denounced him in a show
trial and sentenced him to life under house arrest at their
stronghold in Anlong Veng.
<p>
   That trial appeared to be aimed at least in part at cleansing
the image of the Khmer Rouge, whose small remaiing group of
leaders are seeking a way to avoid retribution and perhaps to
re-enter society.
<p>
   There is a continuing hope abroad that Khmer Rouge leaders in
Anlong Veng might turn Pol Pot, who is about 73, over to an
international tribunal as part of an amnesty agreement.
<p>
   Last week, two government-controlled Cambodian newspapers
reported that Pol Pot had fled to China, perhaps to avoid this
possibility or to receive medical care.
<p>
   In Bangkok at the weekend, Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan of
Thailand was quoted in The Nation newspaper as seconding those
reports, saying: ``Our source said he is not in Cambodia, but I
cannot confirm where he is now. Definitely he is not in Thailand.''
<p>
   In past years, Pol Pot has been given refuge and medical
treatment in both Thailand and China. But a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman told The Associated Press on Sunday that he was
not there.
<p>
   ``It is well known that the Chinese government no longer has any
contact with the Khmer Rouge,'' said the spokesman, who identified
himself as Li. ``The rumor of the so-called Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot having medical treatment in Beijing is completely unfounded.''

<p>
   Dearborn, Michigan, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said it
has no plans to buy South Korea's debt-ridden Kia Motors Corp. but
would consider doing so if the U.S. automaker decided to build cars
in Korea and concluded that buying Kia was the most cost effective
way.
<p>
   ``We never say never, but we certainly don't have any plans at
this point,'' said Jacques Nasser, president of Ford Automotive
Operations. ``We're always willing to look at any sensible business
proposition.''
<p>
   South Korea's government, reacting to recent economic turmoil,
said it would consider selling Kia to foreign owners. Ford has been
mentioned frequently in South Korean press reports as a likely
suitor because it already owns 9.39 percent of Kia directly, plus
an additional 7.52 percent through Ford's Japanese affiliate, Mazda
Motors Corp. Nasser, who runs Ford's day-to-day auto operations
worldwide, said he couldn't confirm a South Korean press report
that Ford's vice chairman, Wayne Booker, plans a statement on Kia
on Monday morning, Korean time.
<p>
   South Korea's stock market rose in the last few days as the pace
of corporate bankruptcies slowed.
<p>
   Nasser said he's optimistic that South Korea and other Asian
countries will recover.
<p>
   ``I believe in the strength of industry, the strength of
technology, and the strength of people,'' Nasser said. ``Those
elements can overcome what may be short-term banking and financial
issues.''
<p>
   Weak Asian currencies will encourage exports into the U.S.,
pressuring Ford's profits and sales, Nasser said. Still, Ford
should be able to hold its own by cutting costs, he said. Nasser
said he can't predict the impact of falling prices worldwide.
Because of the pricing pressures, however, ``it's probably the best
time ever for people to buy cars and trucks almost anywhere in the
world.''
<p>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that in
the view of some analysts, deflation may have replaced inflation as
a threat to world economies.
<p>
   ``We've never really experienced (deflation) in today's modern
economy, with today's technology and the ability of capital to move
as quickly as it can around the world. I'm not necessarily sure
what the impact will be,'' Nasser said.
<p>
   Deflation gives added importance to efficiency, to giving
customers better value, and to quick corporate decisions. ``I don't
think that can be bad overall,'' Nasser said.

 &UR; FED'S RIVLIN SEES `MODERATE' U.S. GROWTH IN 1998 (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Laura Cohn &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
   (Adds Rivlin comments on the current expansion, job growth and
inflation in 2nd, 7th-14th paragraphs.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy should remain on
a ``non-inflationary'' track as the nearly seven-year-old expansion
continues at a ``moderate'' pace this year, Federal Reserve Vice
Chairman Alice Rivlin said.
<p>
   The economy is ``doing well'' and the expansion that will enter
its eighth year in April ``has been long and consistently
impressive, especially in terms of job creation,'' Rivlin said,
speaking at the American Economic Association's annual meeting.
<p>
   Helping to preserve that record, following a year in which the
economy may have expanded as much as 3.5 percent, Rivlin said
growth ``is highly likely to slow to a more moderate rate in early
1998.''
<p>
   Moreover, the recent economic turmoil in Asia should put
``downward pressure'' on U.S. import prices, helping to contain
inflation, she said, cutting U.S. gross domestic product by a half
percentage point.
<p>
   Rivlin didn't offer a specific forecast for U.S. growth in 1998.
And, she said, it's ``clearly too soon to tell'' what the precise
impact of an expected slowdown in Asia will be.
<p>
   Rivlin sits on the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee, which sets interest-rate policy. Fed policymakers, who
meet next on Feb. 3-4, have left the overnight bank lending rate at
5.50 percent since raising it by a quarter point last March.
<p>
   Rivlin noted that the U.S. labor market continues to surprise
analysts and employers: ``It's hard to find skilled workers; it's
also hard to find unskilled workers,'' she said.
<p>
   Unemployment fell to a quarter-century low of 4.6 percent in
November as the economy added 404,000 jobs. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News expect that the Labor Department will report Friday
that the unemployment rate held steady in December, while companies
added 207,000 jobs last month.
<p>
   Ordinarily, job growth at last year's pace and such a low
unemployment rate would be expected to unsettle Fed policymakers
who remain wary that higher wages could lead to accelerating
inflation. Rivlin said, however, that wages may not rise quite as
rapidly as would be expected given the demand for labor and the
relatively constrained supply of workers.
<p>
   Unions have less power to demand higher wages, she said, and
competition is preventing companies from passing on what wage
increases they grant in higher prices for goods and services.
<p>
   In addition, Rivlin said, a high level of worker insecurity
limits calls for higher wages, and companies are offering
combinations of benefits instead of just a bigger paycheck.
<p>
   Taken together, Rivlin said, these conditions make it appear
``the U.S. economy is less inflation-prone'' than in the past.
<p>
   Still, she cautioned, the Fed must remain watchful for signs of
inflationary pressures.
<p>
   Rising benefit costs -- like rising wages -- can be passed along
in higher prices, she said. And though cheaper Asian imports will
help contain inflation in the next year, she said, ``the dollar is
unlikely to go on rising forever,'' which means import prices will
someday rise.
<p>
   Recent economic reports have vindicated the Fed's steady
interest rate stance and support Rivlin's contention that growth
will slow while inflation remains tame.
<p>
   For example, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said its closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing cooled in
December as Asia's economic crisis depressed U.S. exports. Factory
orders and production also sagged from a month earlier.
<p>
   The NAPM's index declined to 52.5 last month -- the lowest
reading since January 1997 -- from 54.4 in November. A reading of
50 or more in the NAPM index means manufacturing is expanding,
while a reading below 50 signals a contraction. And in another
reassuring sign for the Fed, the NAPM prices paid index fell to
50.3 in December from 51.9 during November.
<p>
   That compares with the government's main price gauges, which
have shown all year that inflation remains in check. The consumer
price index rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first 11
months of 1997, well below the 3.3 percent gain recorded in the
first 11 months of the previous year. That leaves consumer price
inflation on track for the best performance since 1986.
<p>
   Price increases have been so tame that Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan even suggested yesterday that the next battle for U.S.
central bankers may be to combat the effects of falling prices.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider
at what point effective price stability has been reached,''
Greenspan told the same annual meeting of U.S. economists.
``Indeed, some observers have begun to question whether deflation
is now a possibility, and to assess the potential difficulties such
a development might pose for the economy.''
<p>
   Greenspan didn't say whether he agrees with analysts who say
deflation is coming, and he refrained as usual from any direct
mention of the Fed's interest-rate policy.
<p>
   The idea of deflation comes amid turmoil in Asia's economies,
which Fed officials expect will further slow U.S. growth. ``The
worst may be over, but we're clearly in for a period of much weaker
growth in Asia, which we expect will impact very heavily on the
United States,'' Rivlin said in a Zurich speech on Dec. 9.

   George Irving Jr., a food-safety expert who led a major federal
study that found most food additives to be safe but recommended
limits on added salt, died on Dec. 27 at his home in Bethesda, Md.
He was 87.
<p>
   In 1970, President Nixon asked the Food and Drug Administration
to review ``the GRAS list'' of food substances  &MD;  those classified
as ``generally recognized as safe.'' Irving, a biochemist who led
the Agricultural Research Service, was asked to set up a national
panel of experts to do the study. Working as a research associate
at the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology, he
set up the panel in 1971, and the FDA began reporting its findings
in 1980.
<p>
   The panel recommended restrictions on added salt, four modified
starches used as thickening agents, and lactic acid and calcium
lactate, which had been used in infant formulas. It concluded that
added salt should be tightly restricted, and prohibited in some
foods, saying reductions would help the 10 percent to 30 percent of
the population with a tendency toward high blood pressure. The
panel said more research was needed on caffeine, a stimulant found
in coffee, tea and cola beverages.
<p>
   Even though Irving took an analytical view of food in his work,
he was relaxed about food at the dinner table, said his wife,
Frances Irving, and drank one cup of non-decaffeinated coffee a
day.
<p>
   ``His mother had served him doughnuts, pies with lard, plum
pudding with suet,'' Mrs. Irving said, ``so he was a moderate about
his food.''
<p>
   George Irving was born in Caribou, Maine. He received a master's
degree in chemistry and, in 1936, a doctorate in biochemistry from
George Washington University.
<p>
   In 1938, he joined the research staff of the Rockefeller
Institute, now Rockefeller University, in New York. He joined the
U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1942, first at its laboratory in
New Orleans and then at the Agricultural Research Center in
Beltsville, Md.
<p>
   In 1964, Irving became chief of the Agricultural Research
Service, which operates laboratories nationwide and coordinates
research at universities and other institutions. He retired in
1971. Later, he was president of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
<p>
   Besides his wife, Irving is survived by a daughter, Mary
Constance Irving Fitzpatrick of Cape Coral, Fla.; a son, George
Irving III of San Antonio; a sister, Dawn Dollard of Mesa, Ariz.,
and three grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<p>
   If you happen to be a cable-news producer panting after viewers
on a slow news holiday, there's nothing like a big-name death.
Michael Kennedy's fatal accident caught the attention of every
television news operation, but MSNBC was by far the most
persistent, moving from the ski slopes in Aspen, Colo., where the
risk-taking family disported, to the church were it went to mourn
and the cemetery where it has gone to bury and be buried.
<p>
   The station devoted hours and hours to exhibiting the Kennedy
clan like icons and the Kennedy clips like an interminable
scrapbook.
<p>
   There, on Saturday, was the glamorous band  &MD;  now live, now on
tape  &MD;  coming out of Our Lady of Victory Church in Centerville,
Mass. By the magic of photography, they kept appearing, lingering
before the church while the camera lingered on them, and emerging
again and again to wait for the cortege.
<p>
   The commentators liked that word, which they chose to pronounce
cor-TAHZH, perhaps because it sounds more fitting for a royal
retinue and might evoke the passing of the princess of Wales, the
last time television was so blessed. Kennedy's body was laid to
rest on Saturday, but on Sunday, MSNBC continued to labor; the same
family clips rolled on.
<p>
   What was it all about? Not surely about Kennedy, known better to
tabloid television than to the news programs. It must have been
about something much bigger, perhaps the bad luck, which no one
omitted mentioning, of America's Family and the grief it can still
call up in viewers of a certain age.
<p>
   Or something much smaller, perhaps just the uses of celebrity to
a news channel. Or perhaps it was the authentic power of those
reiterated images, part Washington, part Hollywood, part myth and
the resonance of the Kennedy history.
<p>
   For the family, it was a show of solidarity in grief; for MSNBC,
a big photo opportunity. Many of us had seen some of these mourners
as children at Hyannis Port, Mass., and at the White House and in
Arlington Cemetery. Now here they were, together again, middle-aged
but forever the Kennedy kids, on another of their days of disaster.
And there they were as children 20 or 30 years ago.
<p>
   The MSNBC correspondents had nothing to say that others had not
said, and they kept saying it. On Saturday they sounded like
funeral directors with their somber quotations from the eulogies
about the departed's good works. Their job was to keep the jabber
going while the camera focused on the silent staring faces.
<p>
   This ``sorrowful occasion,'' one said. ``Poignant,'' one said. A
reporter at the cemetery announced, ``This is a time of grief and a
time to console one another.'' The camera said, ``Look at Arnold
Schwarzenegger.''
<p>
   The problem was that, for news purposes, there was little but
the ceremonial compliments to say about the departed, unless you
had the bad taste to mention that baby sitter, far too little to
justify the morning-to-evening day-after-day coverage. So reporters
settled for boilerplate about ``the legacy of the parents'' and
``the idealism punctuated by tragedy and scandal.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   This no-news special had much less to do with Michael Kennedy
than with John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy and the Kennedy
phenomenon. The NBC archives, from Brinkley to Pauley to Brokaw,
were ravaged for the occasion: There were the brothers in office,
campaigning, planning or conspiring together and fooling around
together; there they were dying on camera.
<p>
   And there were the unforgettable pictures of the Kennedy widows
and the Kennedy children. And there were the many more forgettable
pictures. Being concocted before our eyes was a television event
posing as a national event.
<p>
   Unfortunately for the spirit of the production, it kept drawing
one's attention to the vacuum at the center of it all. A young man
noteworthy only for his provenance is killed when he crashes into a
tree, and a television channel enlarges it to an epic,
bargain-price.
<p>
   Minor as news and routine as history, it was staged as a panoply
of famous faces and memories meant to tap emotions that had been
pumped up over decades of Kennedyana and that might once again
manage to gather an audience on a long football weekend.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  ``Popular'' hardly seems the word for so dark a
creation, but in recent years, Mahler's Sixth Symphony has become
one of his most often performed works. It seems, in fact, to have
challenged the Fifth as the work against which aspiring Mahlerians
test themselves.
<p>
   Daniele Gatti did so in an excellent interpretation with the New
York Philharmonic a couple of seasons ago, and now Valery Gergiyev
is doing the same in a series ending Monday night at Avery Fisher
Hall. Gergiyev's performance on Friday evening was fascinating in
ways that suggested why the work has been receiving so much
attention.
<p>
   It is, in some ways, the quintessential Mahler symphony in its
groaning friction between form and content. In the first three
movements, at least, the forms are hardly more complex than those
of a Haydn symphony, yet the tragic freight of the music often
threatens to burst all bounds.
<p>
   At the same time that he laid out those structures with utmost
clarity, Gergiyev stressed the weirdness of the content to the
full. The agonized march of the opening movement turned with a
palpable sense of relief into the contemplativeness of the surreal
pastoral interlude, only to tighten its grip even more powerfully
toward the close.
<p>
   As every Mahlerian will want to know, Gergiyev indulged in a
welcome bit of unorthodoxy at the end of the work, adding the third
thudding hammer stroke, which Mahler superstitiously deleted from
the score, wary of the final blow of fate in his own life. By the
time the stroke came, it seemed oddly anticlimactic. Some heavy,
fateful force seemed to be working throughout the entire piece,
pulling from below long before it whaled from above.
<p>
   Thus, the second movement sank repeatedly into lethargy,
seemingly on the verge of being swallowed into the earth, an image
that recurred throughout the finale. Even in the relatively placid
andante, Gergiyev found a certain grotesqueness, with the winding
opening melody devolving eventually into shudders and ultimately
into shouts.
<p>
   The Philharmonic, of course, knows this music as well as anyone.
It played like the fine Mahler orchestra it is, with each section
taking the fore in turn.
<p>
   There are other ways to perform this work, and some listeners,
including this one, might prefer something more consistently taut
and overwhelming. But Gergiyev's approach was satisfying and
revelatory in its clarity as well as its evocativeness.

<p>
   WARSAW, Poland  &MD;  As NATO membership for three Central European
nations draws closer, officials in Washington and Western Europe
are scrambling to deal with one of the most sensitive aspects of
the alliance's expansion: the trustworthiness of intelligence
agencies in the former Soviet-bloc countries.
<p>
   A basic question facing the Clinton administration as it pushed
for the enlargement of NATO was whether the spy agencies in Poland,
the Czech Republic and Hungary, which until eight years ago served
Moscow, could be trusted to keep secrets.
<p>
   Administration officials say they concluded that there had been
enough house-cleaning of the three former Warsaw Pact intelligence
agencies and enough distance since the end of Communism to insure
reliability.
<p>
   But for others in Washington, at NATO headquarters in Brussels,
and indeed for some officials in Warsaw and Budapest, the
conclusions are not so cut and dried.
<p>
   Because of its confidence, the administration rejected proposals
to create an extra layer of screening for the people who will be
sent by the three countries to NATO headquarters, NATO and
administration officials said.
<p>
   ``The bottom line is that because they know the Russians, they
are savvy about the hostile Russian threat, which is still there,''
a senior official at the center of NATO policy in Washington said
of the Central European countries. ``It's not the case of, `Oh God,
they're riddled with KGB agents; you can't share anything with
them.'''
<p>
   The official said the selling of secrets was a danger in any
intelligence service. Asked if the risk was higher in Central
Europe, he said. ``The bottom line is that professionals in
counterintelligence say absolutely not.''
<p>
   But some Western officials fear that the administration has bent
over backward to treat the newcomers as equal partners, planning to
share sensitive information with them in the same way it is shared
with current NATO members. The administration has too easily
accepted the Central Europeans' arguments that they should not be
treated as second-class citizens in the alliance, the critics
assert.
<p>
   ``These guys may be loyal to Poland, but how easy is it to buy
them now that ideology is not so important but money is?'' asked an
American intelligence official who has urged caution in joint
American-Polish intelligence operations.
<p>
   Hearings on the expansion of NATO began in Congress in the fall,
and a Senate vote is expected in the spring. A two-thirds majority
in the Senate is required, as well as approval by the legislatures
of the 15 other NATO members.
<p>
   The administration has said it expects to welcome the three
countries into NATO in 1999, the 50th anniversary of the alliance's
founding. Russia opposed the expansion plan, but NATO has tried to
reassure Moscow that it should not feel threatened by it and has
set up a consultative council of the NATO and Russian foreign
ministers.
<p>
   The intelligence agencies in Central Europe have different
degrees of relevance to Washington and NATO. By far the most
important intelligence apparatus is in Poland, the most
strategically and militarily dominant of the three proposed new
members.
<p>
   Since 1990, officials from all three countries' spy agencies
have visited CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., and CIA officials
have come to Central Europe to give advice on restructuring
agencies that were their Cold War foes.
<p>
   Poland's intelligence agencies have received the most attention
from Washington, and the results have been mixed.
<p>
   ``After 1989, links were established right away,'' said an
American official who was based in Warsaw. ``There has been a
substantial level of confidence between the United States and the
Poles. We have cooperated on a gradualist approach.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   The structure of the Office of State Security, the civilian-run
Polish intelligence service, was basically kept intact after the
fall of Communism in 1989. But agents considered to be sympathetic
to Moscow were dismissed after a vetting process in 1990.
<p>
   At that time, about 600 out of 1,000 Polish agents in the
foreign branch service were let go, according to Gromoslaw
Czempinski, the head of the service in the mid-1990s.
<p>
   But the agency, which combines both domestic and foreign
intelligence services, became heavily politicized during the recent
government headed by the former Communists, Czempinski and Western
diplomats said.
<p>
   The new anti-Communist government, which won elections in
September, has replaced senior officials in the intelligence
agency.
<p>
   A NATO official said that ``Poland would have been a real
problem'' if there had not been a change of government. ``If the
former Communists had stayed there might have been a lot of
different thinking in Washington,'' the official said.
<p>
   Despite the problems, Washington has tended to look somewhat
benignly on the Poles, American diplomats said. Poland has
intelligence assets in places where Washington needs them  &MD;  in Iraq
and Libya, for instance. And the agency dramatically proved its
usefulness to Washington by rescuing CIA agents stranded in Iraq
before the Persian Gulf war.
<p>
   Czempinski and his colleague Slawomir Petelicki, who before 1989
both worked for many years as Warsaw Pact spies in the West, ran
the rescue. They were commended by the director of central
intelligence at the time, William Webster.
<p>
   Petelicki, who enjoys showing visitors the engraved silver bowl
he received from the CIA and his annual Christmas card from
Langley, was reinstated in December by the new Polish government as
the head of Poland's Special Forces unit.
<p>
   The Military Information Service, which combines military
intelligence and counterintelligence, has posed more of a headache
than the civilian agency, Western and Polish officials said.
<p>
   The military agency has remained virtually untouched since the
collapse of Communism. Most worrying to Washington is that efforts
to introduce civilian oversight for it have so far failed, an
American official involved in the effort said.
<p>
   The new Polish defense minister, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, said in an
interview in December that the agency needed ``an overhaul.'' As
part of this process, a new chief, Col. Tadeusz Rusak, was
appointed in December.
<p>
   In the Czech Republic, the intelligence agencies have presented
more problems than the administration expected.
<p>
   Unlike Poland and Hungary, where old-timers were allowed to stay
on under the new anti-Communist governments, the Czech Republic
basically destroyed its old secret services. They started over by
hiring new people with no background in intelligence work. The
current head of the Czech Republic's military intelligence agency
is Acting Maj. Gen. Peter Pelz, an architect by profession.
<p>
   A result of the reforms, a Western diplomat in Prague said, is
that the ``Czechs are clean but not competent.''
<p>
   When the Czechs went to Brussels in November, along with
officials from Hungary and Poland, to discuss how NATO secrets
would be kept secure in their capitals, they were so far behind in
their procedures that they were warned that they risked not
becoming NATO members, a senior NATO official said.
<p>
   In Hungary, even though a center-right government came to power
after 1989 after the fall of the Communists, there was little
purging of the secret services. The civilian and military
intelligence organizations  &MD;  which include five different foreign
and domestic services  &MD;  are headed by officials from the Communist
era.
<p>
   A critic of the Hungarian intelligence services, Ferenc Koszeg,
who is deputy chairman of the oversight committee in the Hungarian
parliament, said that when the Communists fell, he believed that
the senior people in the intelligence agencies should have been
dismissed. He was still uneasy that old timers were in charge, he
said.
<p>
   Some NATO officials play down the threat of damaging leaks from
the proposed new members. They point out that NATO does not
generate its own intelligence but distributes only what the allies
decide to give it. Washington, for instance, does not share with
NATO everything it shares with its close ally Britain.
<p>
   And a NATO official said that in the post-Cold War era of lower
tensions, NATO holds fewer of the ``crown jewels'' than before.
<p>
   But even some advocates of NATO expansion who believe that the
intelligence agencies in the three countries are not particularly
competent or trustworthy argue that working with them is worth the
risk.
<p>
   Retired Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the National Security
Agency in the Reagan administration and who supports NATO
enlargement, said that ``the Russians will probably have enough
residual capacity to cause us serious problems'' in the three
countries.
<p>
   ``But the fact we have an intelligence problem is not a
show-stopper,'' he said. ``It just means we have spade work to
do.''

 &UR; MOI DECLARED WINNER IN KENYA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NAIROBI, Kenya  &MD;  President Daniel arap Moi was officially
declared the winner of Kenya's presidential election on Sunday,
giving a final term to a 20-year-old administration widely
criticized for corruption and mismanagement.
<p>
   The announcement came after two days of unofficial counts
predicting Moi's victory. The chairman of the Kenya Electoral
Commission, Samuel Kivuitu, announced that Moi was leading his
nearest challenger, Mwai Kibaki, a former vice president, by about
550,000 votes in official returns  &MD;  2.4 million to 1.9 million.
Though about 147,000 ballots from remote regions were still to be
counted, Kivuitu declared Moi the victor.
<p>
   ``Daniel arap Moi has received the highest number of votes,''
Kivuitu said.
<p>
   But when Moi is sworn in on Monday morning for a fifth five-year
term, he will have a mandate from only about 40 percent of the
voters, hardly a ringing endorsement of his administration. Kibaki
and other opposition leaders have demanded that the election be
held again, charging that Moi's agents orchestrated widespread
ballot shortages and other irregularities to keep them from
winning.
<p>
   Yet international and domestic election observers say that
Kenya's election, while flawed and chaotic, was not substantially
rigged to favor Moi. Even though there were massive delays and
ballot mix-ups on election day, forcing an extension of voting, the
vast majority of registered voters managed to get to the polls and
to cast confidential ballots without intimidation, these observers
said.
<p>
   ``The results do, on the whole, reflect the will of the Kenyan
voters,'' said the Rev. Mutava Musyimi, a spokesman for a
church-run election-monitoring operation, consisting of a coalition
of church groups and a pro-democracy group.
<p>
   The truth is that Moi did not need to resort to crude methods to
win, political analysts said. The wily 74-year-old veteran of
Kenyan politics triumphed with tactics familiar to any machine
politician from urban America  &MD;  gerrymandering, dividing his
opponents along ethnic lines, and making sure voter registration
favored his party.
<p>
   Moi also enjoyed a hefty advantage as the incumbent. The
state-run radio and television broadcasts, for instance, focused
almost exclusively on his campaign during the last two weeks of the
race, ignoring his opponents.
<p>
   But while the playing field favored the governing party, the
irregularities and logistical problems reported at the polls were
not widespread enough to skew the results, international and
domestic observers said. It was a measure of the election's
relative fairness that about 60 percent of the vote went to
opposition candidates, and the governing party lost more than a
dozen seats in Parliament, including several held by Cabinet
ministers.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   ``At the end of the day, the Kenyan voters were able to express
their wishes,'' Rev. Musyimi said. He added that the general
situation favored Moi's party, the Kenyan African National Union,
``but that bias did not in any significant way determine or effect
the final result.''
<p>
   The biggest reason for Moi's victory is the tribal nature of
Kenyan politics, an analysis of the returns indicates. The anti-Moi
vote was split among four main challengers, all of whom had strong
support in their home regions but had made few inroads elsewhere.
<p>
   In essence, the president faced four regional parties based on
tribal loyalties. The major ethnic groups voted overwhelmingly for
their kinsmen: the Kikuyu for Kibaki, the Luo for Raila Odinga, the
Luhyia for Michael Kijana Wamalwa, and the Akamba for Charity
Ngilu.
<p>
   But Moi, who comes from the small Kalenjin tribe, has built up
support in all of those communities through the deft use of
patronage, appointments, and government largesse. At the same time,
he has kept intact his coalition of dozens of small tribes, mostly
from the Rift Valley, and the coast, who fear that a president from
one of the larger tribes would ignore their needs.
<p>
   The result was that Moi ran a strong second in each of the
provinces where his opponents won and easily defeated them in his
strongholds. On the national level, the challengers split up the
opposition vote, robbing the most formidable candidate among them,
Kibaki, of the boost he needed to surpass Moi.
<p>
   ``Moi pulled it off by winning,'' said Charles Hornsby, an
expert on Kenyan politics who is co-author of a book on the
subject. ``He's first or second in every province. Even though he's
unpopular with a majority, he's run second almost everywhere. I am
of the opinion that it was a fair win.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   But even if the voting was fair, the campaign was dirty,
political analysts say. To begin with, Moi and his party registered
more than 2.1 million voters in the Rift Valley, the heartland of
his support, and made sure a majority of those people made it to
the polls, despite heavy rains and muddy roads.
<p>
   Indeed, the sparsely-populated Rift Valley had almost twice as
many registered voters as any other province  &MD;  including the
heavily populated central highlands, where the Kikuyu are the
majority, and Nyanza on Lake Victoria, the homeland of the Luo.
<p>
   The turnout for Moi in his strongholds was also extremely high,
averaging about 75 percent, compared with the national average of
65 percent. Indeed, at least three constituencies reported
impossibly high turnouts. In Moi's home district of Baringo North,
for instance, officials recorded a turnout of 105 percent.
<p>
   Moi's party also gerrymandered parliamentary constituencies to
favor his strongholds. For instance, in Nairobi, where Kibaki's
Democratic Party is popular, each district had about 91,000 voters,
while in the Rift Valley, each district had about 44,000.
<p>
   In a few parliamentary constituencies, agents of Moi's party
were seen handing out cash outside polling places, observers said.
But opposition party agents were also seen buying votes and it was
impossible to tell if practice affected the final tallies, the
observers said.
<p>
   When all the votes were counted on Sunday, however, it was clear
that the opposition had done much better than in the 1992 election
and that Kenya had taken a few more steps toward full-fledged
democracy, political analysts said. Kibaki, 66, allowed for the
first time to campaign without interference from local officials,
fared much better than expected, with 31 percent of the vote
nationwide and even taking a respectable 20 percent of the vote in
the Rift Valley. The other top 3 challengers had a total of almost
27 percent. The Democratic Party also upset Moi's candidates in at
least two Rift Valley parliamentary races they had expected to
lose.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   But in other parliamentary contests, there is strong evidence
that Moi's agents stole the seat to hold on to a slim majority in
the legislature. In Nairobi's Westlands district, for instance, the
race was razor close between the candidate of Moi's party, Fred
Gumo, and the Democratic Party nominee, Betty Tett.
<p>
   After votes were counted, observers from both sides agreed to
the vote totals for each polling place, and when those figures were
added up, it seemed Ms. Tett had edged Gumo by a bare 139 votes.
But when election officials announced the final result on Saturday
afternoon, an extra 800 votes had appeared in Gumo's column.
<p>
   The election officer in charge, Rosemary Muraa, refused to do a
recount and left the counting hall in a hurry, surrounded by police
officers and governing party officials.
<p>
   Several foreign observers said they were stunned at such a naked
display of rigging. But as Gumo's supporters jubilantly marched
through the streets of Nairobi, Moi's wafer-thin majority in
Parliament got a little thicker.
<p>
   ``They cheated as little as possible and as much as necessary,''
Hornsby said.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Comebacks and nostalgia tours are beginning to
proliferate in hip-hop, as they already do in rock, but rap's
current stars have veered from its original course. Hit factories
like Sean (Puffy) Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment brand artists'
images with Versace couture and their music with yesterday's Top 40
melodies.
<p>
   Conversely, the show presented by the rapper KRS-One at Tramps
on Friday night took hip-hop back to its beginnings as street
poetry created by young people who made style history in outfits no
fancier than an Adidas sweatsuit and an excellent pair of sneakers.
<p>
   Veteran performers demonstrated how much can be done with no
more than two turntables and a microphone. The Cold Crush Brothers,
whose 1970s raps were some of the first, rapped in a declamatory
style over the minimalist beats of their DJ, Toni Tone. They
cribbed from 1970s pop tunes for their melodies, enlivening them
with their own good-natured lyrical boasts. The lesson the Cold
Crush Brothers offered was that the basic repertory of clever,
vigorously delivered self-mythologizing can still make for
entertaining hip-hop.
<p>
   Big Daddy Kane, who strode onstage next, elaborated on this
theme. A 1980s hit maker who sat out most of this decade, Kane
demonstrated the survival of his skills by firing off phrases
without missing a beat. Staying in safe territory with classic cuts
instead of new material, Kane got the crowd shouting. Like many
rappers, he flowed one song into another without pausing, often
offering only a snippet of hits like ``Raw'' and ``Ain't No
Half-Steppin'.''
<p>
   He also demonstrated his improvisational talent with several
freestyle raps, including one that paid homage to the current
generation of rappers, whom this old master was not too proud to
extol.
<p>
   With his crew, Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One sought to
enlighten more than praise. If some rappers are like preachers and
others resemble seducers, this innovative artist is a hip-hop
barrister, arguing his points with verve and personality. Tapping
from Jamaican dancehall and classic South Bronx styles, he is by
turns comical and dead serious, his delivery always highly charged.
<p>
   His one fault as a performer is that he lectures too much, and
on Friday night his admonitions grew tedious. But the punchy music
kept the mood intense.
<p>
   Like KRS-One's raps, the Boogie Down Productions stage show
works discursively to establish hip-hop's cultural importance.
Break dancers in colorful costumes demonstrated their art, with one
spinning another on his head for several dizzying minutes. Fellow
MCs  &MD;  including the up-and-coming Common Sense, who showed his
charisma during a short opening set  &MD;  stood ready to offer brief
freestyle demonstrations.
<p>
   The venerable DJ Kid Capri left the turntables to Keith Porter
and rapped instead, acting as KRS-One's partner in historical
remembrance. One compatriot, Pee Wee Dance, changed costumes
several times in his role as a living hip-hop fashion display.
<p>
   KRS-One hoped that this breathing museum would inspire the
audience to carry hip-hop forward. ``Nowhere is Martin Luther
King's dream realized but in hip-hop,'' he announced, gesturing to
the racially integrated audience. While sometimes this charismatic
rapper confuses his own importance with the music's, his words
preserved a sense of potential that could well serve hip-hop
artists, old and new school alike.

   Defeats may have taught Bill Cowher more than victories.
<p>
   For the third time in the last four years, his Pittsburgh
Steelers are in the American Conference championship game, thanks
to their defensive demolition of the Patriots on Saturday.
<p>
   But Cowher does not want to produce merely an end-of-the-decade
version of the Buffalo Bills.
<p>
   Only two years ago, under his Pittsburgh-bred tough-guy
coaching, the Steelers were accorded the ultimate National Football
League compliment: They played football like a National Conference
team.
<p>
   That did not help them in their Super Bowl loss to the Cowboys
two seasons ago, and the Steelers became another AFC victim in a
string that goes back to the time the Raiders were actually a good
team.
<p>
   As Cowher prepares for Sunday's title game, he reflected on how
his team is looking at life these days. Saturday's 7-6 victory in
Pittsburgh was not an isolated event. It was part of a three-game
stretch. The AFC championship will only be Game 2.
<p>
   Although it has been just two years since the Steelers' Super
Bowl appearance, there is a different philosophy, and a remarkably
different squad.
<p>
   First, there is the quarterback. Who would have imagined that
the efficient Neil O'Donnell would be playing for the Jets and that
the fellow Pittsburgh used to bring in for offbeat plays, Kordell
Stewart, would now be the starter?
<p>
   Teams get broken up these days, though  &MD;  even teams that nearly
win championships. Thus, the Steelers have 15 players who were not
even on the club 24 months ago.
<p>
   ``I think there's been a great mix on this team,'' Cowher said.
``Not just defense, but there are a lot of faces that have been to
that game a couple years ago, and they have relayed the message to
the other players, the other veterans that have come from other
teams, in recognizing the importance of preparation, not to get
caught up in all the hoopla.''
<p>
   ``That game'' was the Super Bowl, and Cowher wishes he could
have back the off week leading up to it, that silly time when he
feared he had lost his players' concentration.
<p>
   Imagine that Tuesday night before the game of their lives, the
club's leading sacker, Kevin Greene, flew from Phoenix to Las Vegas
and climbed into the ring for a pro wrestling charade against the
dirty-dealing Ric Flair. Greene is now a 49er.
<p>
   Just a year earlier, the Steelers were accorded shoo-in status
for their AFC championship game against the Chargers, and who could
blame the oddsmakers? The Steelers were so convincing in a 29-9
divisional playoff rout of the Cleveland Browns that everyone in
Pittsburgh was already looking past San Diego to the Super Bowl.
<p>
   ``One for the thumb,'' was the rallying cry of Pittsburgh fans  &MD; 
harking back to the 1970s, when Bradshaw and Swann and Mean Joe had
played roles in capturing four Super Bowl titles.
<p>
   Amid this hoopla, the Steelers began talking about making the
obligatory rap video, presumably to be a best seller once they won
the Super Bowl. Cowher was livid but could not halt the excitement.
<p>
   O'Donnell said people were asking him about a fifth ring, as if
he had already earned the other four.
<p>
   ``I just want my first,'' he said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But the Steelers lost the AFC title game to San Diego, 17-13,
and then a year later they lost the Super Bowl, 27-17. And now they
are one game away again.
<p>
   ``You can go back in that locker room right now, and there's a
nice feeling,'' Cowher said. ``But we've got some unfinished
business. We know what's at stake. The whole thing from here on out
has been that we have three games left. We just got the first one,
and we have two to go.''
<p>
   To linebacker Levon Kirkland, who has played for Pittsburgh
since 1992, coming so close has changed the Steelers.
<p>
   ``We have a tremendous resolve, and it's hard to put your finger
on. For example, that 1994 team was our most talented team, but it
wasn't focused. Too much rap video talk and all that stuff. This
team is the most focused since I've been here.''
<p>
   The word has been passed down. Stewart knows the marching
orders:
<p>
   ``We haven't won anything yet,'' he said.

 &UR; CLINTON, CONGRESS EAGER TO TACKLE SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM &LR;  &QL; 
(kd) &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD W. STEVENSON &LR;  &QC;   &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  With optimism growing that the federal budget
deficit could be eliminated within a year or two, the Clinton
administration and Congress are edging toward addressing the
nation's longer-term fiscal problems, most notably the looming
insolvency of the Social Security system.
<p>
   White House officials said Sunday that President Clinton wanted
to put in place in two years a plan to shore up Social Security,
which is otherwise expected to run out of money by around 2030, two
decades after the baby-boom generation begins retiring in droves.
<p>
   ``The president is clearly sending out the message that passing
long-term Social Security reform is something he wants to get done
and that its best chances are to actually complete it within the
next 18 to 20 months,'' Gene Sperling, the White House's
economic-policy adviser, said in an interview.
<p>
   Clinton and the Republican leadership in Congress are also
focusing increasingly, if tentatively, on other long-term issues,
like the soundness of the Medicare system of health insurance for
the elderly. Medicare could also go broke within decades because
there are more retirees who are living longer and requiring
increasingly expensive medical care.
<p>
   Until now neither party has been eager to take on the woes of
the Social Security program. But Clinton has made no secret of his
desire to leave a strengthened pension and retirement system as one
of his political legacies. His aides said Clinton had concluded
that now was the time to move, before the 2000 presidential race
began and while the federal budget was in its best condition in
decades.
<p>
   The officials said Clinton was studying a variety of policy
proposals to address the problems in the retirement program, as
well as strategies for how to deal with the immense political
pressures that both Republicans and Democrats would face in
tackling one of the most emotional and complex issues on the
nation's economic agenda.
<p>
   Among the ideas under consideration at the White House is for
Clinton to call Congress into special session to deal with Social
Security after the midterm elections in November.
<p>
   But administration officials played down that possibility, which
was first reported Sunday by The Washington Post. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said in an appearance on the CBS program
``Face the Nation'' that a special session of Congress was not
``necessarily a good idea,'' although other officials said it would
be a serious option if there was bipartisan support for it on
Capitol Hill.
<p>
   Another idea with support at the White House is to use a
congressionally mandated conference later this year on how to
increase the nation's savings rate as a way to focus attention on
Social Security and other pension and retirement programs. And the
White House and members of both parties in Congress continue to
discuss creation of a bipartisan commission or a special
congressional committee to draft Social Security legislation.
<p>
   White House aides said Clinton had not yet decided on any
specific remedies. His advisers have long been skeptical of
proposals that would turn over to individuals the job of investing
for their retirements the money that would otherwise go into the
Social Security program. And they have shied away from publicly
endorsing or rejecting anything else from a menu of politically
unappealing options that includes cutting benefits, raising the
retirement age or raising taxes.
<p>
   Clinton has ``asked his staff to meet to come up with
substantive ideas, and he's currently considering those,'' said
Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget director.
<p>
   ``We're also looking at it procedurally  &MD;  how do we go out and
engage the American people in the topic and make them understand
the importance of preserving Social Security and extending it,''
Raines said on the NBC program ``Meet the Press.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The administration's decision to begin moving ahead on Social
Security was welcomed by several influential Republicans. Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, both said the problem would just get worse the longer it
went unaddressed.
<p>
   But Archer said Republicans would be wary if Clinton expected
them to make politically painful proposals on their own, especially
during the midst of a congressional election this year. He
suggested that Republicans wanted Clinton to make the first move in
putting specific solutions on the table.
<p>
   ``The president should propose, he should send up what he
believes is an appropriate solution and we should look at it,''
Archer said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``You can't solve these
problems without making some very, very tough political
decisions.''
<p>
   The emerging debate over Social Security will join an already
crowded economic policy agenda for the coming year. With the
federal budget deficit all but eliminated and the prospects for a
budget surplus in the next year or two improving, the White House
and members of Congress from both parties are scrambling to come up
with plans for any financial windfall.
<p>
   Improving the health of Social Security and Medicare, as well as
other long-term problems, will therefore become mixed into a
broader set of issues this year, some of them of more immediate
political interest to both parties. Republicans are pushing for tax
cuts. Many Democrats are arguing in favor of increasing spending on
education and anti-poverty programs.
<p>
   The size and timing of any surplus, and how it is apportioned
among the many uses to which it could be put, could have a
substantial effect on how Washington deals with Social Security.
<p>
   One option for any surpluses is to use them to pay down the $5
trillion national debt. Some of that is money the federal
government borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, so to the
degree that the overall national debt declines, the financial risk
to Social Security would also be reduced.
<p>
   The administration has so far not laid out its priorities for
use of any surpluses. But White House officials have become more
outspoken in recent weeks in opposition to Republican calls for
more tax cuts, saying that there might be better uses for the
money, including helping to solve the nation's long-term problems.
<p>
   ``We have a separate deficit, which is this generational deficit
 &MD;  Medicare and Social Security,'' Raines said. ``We need to insure
that before we get into things like tax cuts, particularly tax cuts
for the well off, that we have our total fiscal house in order.''

 &UR; ISRAEL'S FOREIGN MINISTER ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION &LR;  &QL; 
(lb) &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGE SCHMEMANN &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
 &UR; c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  
<p>
   JERUSALEM  &MD;  Contending that he had no further place in Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition, Foreign
Minister David Levy resigned Sunday, leaving the embattled
government with a razor-thin majority in Parliament.
<p>
   Levy's announcement seemed to catch Netanyahu by surprise, and
it abruptly confronted the prime minister with his most serious
challenge in 19 months of almost constant crises.
<p>
   Without the five votes of Levy's faction, Netanyahu has only a
61-59 majority. Like many Israelis, Netanyahu apparently thought
the foreign minister was bluffing when he declared on Thursday that
he intended to leave the government in protest over the lack of
money for social-welfare programs in the 1998 budget, as well as
the stagnation in peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
<p>
   Within four hours of Levy's announcement, Netanyahu said at a
news conference that he was determined to carry on with his
remaining coalition. ``I think this government will prove more
stable than a lot of people think,'' he said, predicting that
Parliament would pass his budget on Monday.
<p>
   But that seemed less than certain, since there were reports that
some members of Netanyahu's own Likud Party might vote no.
<p>
   Speculation was rife about whether Levy's defection would force
new elections. The previous government of Yitzhak Rabin managed to
function with 61 votes in Parliament, but Netanyahu has antagonized
many members of his party and his coalition through the incessant
infighting that has marked his administration.
<p>
   Some politicians and commentators said they suspected that
before long the prime minister might call new elections himself
rather than risk the humiliation of losing a vote of confidence.
<p>
   ``It is obvious that if Levy does not come back, the question of
early elections surfaces,'' said Shaul Yahalom, a legislator from
the National Religious Party. ``A coalition of 61 in such a fluid
situation as the one that exists inside this coalition is a
dangerous situation.''
<p>
   The prime minister met late into the night with Likud leaders
and planned to meet after that with other members of his coalition
in an effort to rally support. Loud arguing could be heard from
inside the meeting room, and officials emerging for a break
reported that Netanyahu was ``pale and sad'' but struggling to
maintain a confident demeanor.
<p>
   Immediately beyond the budget hurdle, the Cabinet is faced with
a deadline on deciding how much land to cede to the Palestinians.
The White House announced Sunday that President Clinton would meet
with Netanyahu in Washington on Jan. 20 and with the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, on Jan. 22.
<p>
   At that time, the Israeli leader is supposed to announce a
commitment to a ``credible'' withdrawal from the West Bank as part
of a package deal to resume peace negotiations, which have been
stalled since last March. Dennis Ross, the U.S. mediator for the
Middle East, was expected in Jerusalem on Tuesday to prepare for
the meeting.
<p>
   Before Levy's news conference, the Cabinet  &MD;  minus the foreign
minister  &MD;  met and announced that Netanyahu would not travel to
Washington without a decision approved by the entire government.
With a predominance of right-wing members, though, it was doubtful
that the Cabinet could produce a decision that would satisfy the
Palestinians or the Americans.
<p>
   That possibility was evidently a strong factor in Levy's
decision to resign. The foreign minister has figured as one of the
few moderate voices on peace issues in the Cabinet and has
increasingly found himself outvoted or outmaneuvered in major
decisions.
<p>
   Last month, after a round of inconclusive Cabinet debates on a
policy toward the Palestinians, Levy took the unusual step of
refusing to travel with Netanyahu to a meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright in Paris, contending that there was no
point in going if Israel had nothing to propose.
<p>
   Whether the government falls or survives, Levy's resignation is
likely to hinder further the U.S. mediation effort. Without him,
Netanyahu is likely to become more dependent on right-wing parties,
whose leaders would resist any concessions to the Palestinians.
<p>
   And if new elections were called, the entire process would halt
for at least the 60-day campaign required by Israeli law, and
probably for some time thereafter while a new coalition was formed.
<p>
   Nonetheless, Palestinian officials privately expressed interest
in the possibility of new elections, since most have come to the
conclusion that no progress is possible under Netanyahu.
<p>
   The catalyst for Levy's resignation was the distribution of the
1998 budget, in which Netanyahu was compelled to make numerous
concessions to various religious and ethnic factions.
<p>
   Levy, a Jew of North African descent whose power base is among
poor Israelis of similar background, found that causes he favors  &MD; 
including support for poor towns created for development purposes  &MD; 
received less than he thought he had been promised. At the same
time, his main political competitor, the religious Shas party,
received considerable funding for its welfare programs.
<p>
   Under the circumstances, Levy evidently decided that remaining
in the government would only hasten his political decline, while
resigning would at least restore him to the limelight.

<p>
   Levy appeared calm and determined at his news conference, though
he spoke in his characteristically run-on and jumbled sentences. He
said he had accepted a ``partnership'' in the government based on
the expectation that it would work toward peace with Palestinians
and social welfare at home. But, he said, he had realized that
Netanyahu's pledges were ``hocus pocus.''
<p>
   ``That is not good for the state or the society or the Cabinet,
and therefore I have no alternative but to do what responsibility
and moral rule dictate,'' he said. Soon after, an aide delivered
his letter of resignation to Netanyahu.
<p>
   At his news conference, Netanyahu, looking tired after long days
and nights of haggling over the budget, said he still hoped Levy
would change his mind. The prime minister has 48 hours to ponder
before acting on a letter of resignation from a minister, and
during that time Levy could still withdraw it.
<p>
   The 60-year-old Levy is renowned in Israeli politics for his
many threats to resign  &MD;  he has failed to follow through on eight
previous such threats. But politicians and commentators
acknowledged Sunday that this time there was every indication he
meant it.
<p>
   Netanyahu evidently thought that Levy was only maneuvering for
more funds when the foreign minister announced his intention to
step down on Thursday. Through the weekend, the prime minister
worked to come up with more funds for Levy's causes without raising
taxes.
<p>
   But at his news conference, Levy declared that the very fact
that the prime minister had reportedly found the funds only under
political duress underscored the weakness of the government. ``I
have come to say that I regret very, very much that in order to
cope with these matters, which are so important for our society,
that it is such a shame that it is necessary to go through all this
hell,'' he said.
<p>
   Levy denied that he had been offered a position in a future
Labor government. But the prospect of new elections immediately
prompted speculation about potential future coalitions.
<p>
   The 1996 election was the first under a new system in which the
prime minister was elected directly and separately from the
Parliament. Under the system, a vote of 61 is enough to call new
elections for Parliament and prime minister. If they can muster 80
votes, the legislators can also call for a new election of only the
prime minister.
<p>
   But the consensus among commentators was that Netanyahu would
himself call new elections long before he was threatened with such
a vote. One line of speculation was that if Netanyahu survived the
budget vote and was rebuffed in his security plan by the Americans
and Palestinians, he would be in a strong position to call for
elections as a referendum on his attempts to find ``peace with
security.''

   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks rose as investors
bought electronics exporters like Omron Corp., betting a weak yen
would expand such companies' profits.
<p>
   The benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 40.46 points, or 0.27 percent, to
15,299.2. The broader Topix index rose 5.83 points, or 0.50
percent, to 1180.86.
<p>
   ``The weak yen will be positive for exporters,'' said Shigeru
Murofushi, manager of the equity department at Dai-Ichi Securities
Co.
<p>
   The dollar rose to a 5 1/2-year high of 132.32 yen in New York
trading on Friday, as traders worried that Japan isn't moving
swiftly enough to spur consumer spending or keep more of its
financial institutions from going bankrupt.
<p>
   The dollar recently bought 132.23 yen.
<p>
   A weak yen is good for Japan's exporters, since it makes their
products more competitive overseas and increases earnings when
dollar-denominated profits are brought back home.
<p>
   Sony Corp. rose 400 yen to 12,000. Omron Corp. gained 90 yen to
2,130. Tokyo Electron Ltd. rose 140 yen to 4,320.
<p>
   Yet traders said that investors are still concerned about a
stagnating economy and the possibility that more companies will go
under.
<p>
   Takeda Chemical Industries fell 70 yen to 3,650. Mitsubishi
Corp., a general trading company, fell 30 yen to 1,000. Kirin
Brewerey Co. declined 20 yen to 930.

   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds rose in the first
trading of the new year amid speculation Japanese stocks and the
economy will remain weak.
<p>
   While Japanese stocks rose before the New Year's break after
foreign financial institutions agreed to help ease South Korea's
credit crunch, investors are pessimistic about the prospects for
Asian economies.
<p>
   ``Optimism at the end of the year over the Korean debt
rescheduling has subsided,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, a strategist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities Co. Dealers could be buying bonds in
anticipation of good demand at auctions this week, she said.
<p>
   The benchmark No. 182 government bond, maturing in September
2005, rose 111 yen per 50,000 in face value. Its yield fell 3 basis
points to 1.625 percent.
<p>
   Bond futures for March delivery rose 0.30 from Tokyo's Dec. 30
close to 130.10.
<p>
   Financial markets in Japan reopened today for a half-day
session.
<p>
   The dollar's rise against the yen in the past several months
reflects the poor economy in Japan and the strong U.S. economy, and
is unlikely to affect the bond market much in the short term,
traders said.
<p>
   The dollar was last trading at 132.25 yen.
<p>
   Last week, more than 80 German banks and 10 of Japan's biggest
banks said they would reschedule some short-term Korean loans to
ease the nation's credit crunch. That helped Japan's benchmark
Nikkei 225 stock index rebound 483.52 points, or 3.27 percent, to
finish the year at 15,258.74.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 is up 27.77 points, or 0.18 percent, to 15,286.51
in early trading.
<p>
   ``Korea is a symbol of the systemic financial crisis in Asia, so
when it recovers it could help Japan too,'' said Shingo Takenaga, a
manager in treasury and trading at Sanwa Bank Ltd.

<p>
   HOLLISTER, Calif.  &MD;  At the dusty elbow of a ragged road named
Lovers Lane sits a corrugated tin barn, dull gray and green against
the dun-colored hills of central California.
<p>
   Inside the barn is a big stainless steel tub where lettuce
greens like radicchio, frisee and arugula, plucked from the nearby
fields, are rinsed before being blended into fancy, premixed salads
 &MD;  a hot item among health-minded consumers these days.
<p>
   But in 1996 a team of federal and state authorities descended on
the farm here. After weeks of detective work, they concluded that
lettuce processed at this one barn had almost certainly led to an
outbreak of food poisoning that May and June that sickened 61
people in Illinois, Connecticut and New York. At least 21 people
were hospitalized, including three children who were severely
harmed. One was a 3-year-old Connecticut girl, Haylee Bernstein,
who spent 11 weeks in intensive care, needed surgery to remove a
huge pool of blood in her brain and was left with damaged vision.
<p>
   The investigators said they were troubled to find that the
lettuce company operating at the barn, Fancy Cutt Farms Inc., had
taken virtually no measures to protect its salad mixes from
contamination. The prime suspect, they believed, was obvious: Next
to the barn is a small pen for cattle, whose feces are a leading
source of the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria that experts say is a
growing threat to the nation's food supply.
<p>
   The state cited Fancy Cutt for a number of safety violations in
July 1996. Yet today, more than 17 months later, the company still
has not corrected all the problems, state officials say.
<p>
   Indeed, Fancy Cutt denies responsibility for the outbreak,
questions the strength of the evidence against it and argues the
contamination could have come from elsewhere in the distribution
chain. It defends its safety practices and continues to sell its
lettuce.
<p>
   The fact that the investigation led to a small California farm  &MD; 
thousands of miles from the victims  &MD;  illustrates how vulnerable
the nation's far-flung food distribution system is to the new
contaminants that are puzzling scientists and causing thousands of
illnesses each year. What happened with Fancy Cutt, an organic farm
that used no chemicals to wash lettuce, also shows how federal and
state regulators have failed to keep up as the fresh-food industry
undergoes sweeping changes.
<p>
   An E. coli outbreak in apple juice produced by Odwalla Inc.
showed that even fairly sophisticated processors could have flawed
safety practices. And some farms and processors, eager to satisfy
America's taste for ever-fresher products, are venturing into new
areas with the barest understanding of risks and what few rules
there are. While many producers, especially big ones like Dole and
Fresh Express, have developed advanced safety systems, some small
farmers and processors are going into business with jury-rigged
equipment and scant quality control.
<p>
   These kinds of unreliable practices can create particular risks
for fresh produce and today's bountiful array of prepackaged
salads, the foods most likely to be consumed raw, without high-heat
cooking that destroys bacteria. Some salads are labeled ``all
natural'' or ``triple-washed,'' implying they are safer and cleaner
than other produce.
<p>
   Thousands of Americans have reported illnesses in recent years
in outbreaks of salmonella on cantaloupes and tomatoes, cyclospora
on imported raspberries, the hepatitis virus on strawberries and E.
coli in fresh fruit juice, salads and, just this summer, alfalfa
sprouts.
<p>
   Despite growing concerns, industry officials say nearly all
fruits and vegetables sold are safe. Federal and state health
officials say Americans should not back away from eating such
nutritional fare, though they recommend washing even premixed
salads.
<p>
   Still, as more food is distributed nationally, unsafe practices
at even a small company can affect significant numbers of consumers
over a wide area. Federal officials acknowledge they have paid
little attention to farms and many small-scale processors because
they have been overwhelmed by their responsibilities. The Food and
Drug Administration has only 700 inspectors for 53,000 processors
of everything from canned soup to frozen seafood, meaning, on
average, only one inspection every 10 years.
<p>
   Until the outbreak, state and federal health regulators did not
even know Fancy Cutt existed, because the company, formed in early
1996, had not registered as a processor with the state, as
required. But even once they found problems at Fancy Cutt, the
regulators did not act forcefully.
<p>
   The federal government left it up to the state, and the state
did not try to fine or temporarily shut down Fancy Cutt, even as
repeated inspections showed a failure to comply with state food
safety regulations.
<p>
   ``That's mind-boggling,'' said Rita Bernstein, Haylee's mother.
``How are they still operating? What does it take to close down a
place?''
<p>
   Jim Waddell, acting chief of food safety for the California
Department of Health Services, said his department's approach has
been to work with the industry. But acknowledging the lack of
results, he criticized Fancy Cutt, saying, ``They have flat not
done what we've asked them in a timely manner.''
<p>
   After The New York Times raised questions about the case, state
health authorities did begin pressing for action against the
company. In response, the county prosecutor says he will file
criminal charges and the state attorney general's office says a
civil suit is planned  &MD;  in both cases, not in connection to the
outbreak, but for failing to correct safety violations.
<p>
   Fancy Cutt's president, Robert Chavez, insisted that his
operation had always been safe. But standing outside the processing
barn, his brother, Leonard, who helps run the company, acknowledged
recently that ``this is not a facility, in my mind, that is up to
standards.'' He also said the state had been ``pretty lenient with
us.''

<p>
   The Chavezes also said there are a dozen or more lettuce
processors with more hazardous operations than theirs here in
California's ``salad bowl,'' one of the nation's prime agricultural
belts.
<p>
   State and county officials said they were planning civil and
criminal cases against another lettuce producer, down the road from
Fancy Cutt, where state inspectors say they found even more blatant
safety problems soon after they learned about conditions at Fancy
Cutt. And, Waddell said, ``there's a lot out there we haven't
seen.''
<p>
   THE OUTBREAK: FROM FAR AWAY, CRIPPLING SICKNESS
<p>
   The first illnesses from the tainted lettuce, marked by bloody
diarrhea and cramps, were in Illinois.
<p>
   Some, like Tammy Aardema, seemed unlikely victims of food
poisoning. Ms. Aardema, 43, who lives in the Chicago suburb of St.
Charles, swears by fruits and vegetables and always washes them
before eating. Her husband runs a beef processing plant that takes
strict precautions to keep out E. coli O157:H7. Yet she was
bedridden for days.
<p>
   A few days after the first Illinois cases in late May 1996, the
same pattern cropped up a thousand miles away in Connecticut.
<p>
   In affluent Wilton, Haylee Bernstein had terrible diarrhea and
became so weak she fell asleep on the dining room floor.
Ultimately, she spent 14 weeks in the hospital with hemolytic
uremic syndrome, the most serious consequence of E. coli O157:H7,
which, especially in children, can destroy blood vessels and ravage
the kidneys and other organs, sometimes causing death.
<p>
   Haylee was hooked up to so many tubes  &MD;  for food, oxygen, kidney
dialysis  &MD;  that doctors at times gave her paralyzing drugs to keep
her from wriggling. She had several surgeries, including the
removal of a tennis ball-sized pool of blood that had pushed part
of her brain out of position.
<p>
   Haylee's medical bills, mostly covered by insurance, came to
more than $500,000, including nearly $100,000 for drugs alone.
After the brain surgery, she went blind for weeks, and still has
partial vision loss.
<p>
   Federal and state health officials had reports that at least 52
other people who either lived in or visited Illinois or Connecticut
were sickened.
<p>
   By examining the genetic makeup of the bacteria in stool and
blood samples of the victims, the health officials concluded that
they had the exact same strain of E. coli O157:H7. They
painstakingly interviewed victims about what they had eaten and
where, canvassed supermarket aisles and questioned restaurant
chefs.
<p>
   Finally, they zeroed in on the cause: mixed baby lettuce,
sometimes called mesclun, those blends of colorful greens like baby
spinach or red mustard sold in plastic containers or supermarket
bins, or served in restaurants with goat cheese or balsamic
vinaigrette.
<p>
   Premixed salads have become so popular that one trade group
estimates sales soared to $1 billion nationally last year from
$82.6 million in 1989. Some of these products are marked
``certified organic,'' a promise that no pesticides or chemical
fertilizers were used. But the organic certification, currently or
under regulations proposed recently by the Department of
Agriculture, does not guarantee safe processing practices or
absence of harmful bacteria.
<p>
   Investigators were not altogether surprised that their attention
turned to lettuce. In the previous five years, there were five
outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in lettuce, including iceberg lettuce
and other greens. Some of those cases might have been linked to
food handlers, but this 1996 outbreak affected more people and had
spread much farther than the others.
<p>
   Those sickened by the lettuce had gotten it from at least 11
different restaurants and stores in Connecticut and Illinois, said
Dr. Jonathan Mermin, a medical epidemiologist for the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Those businesses received the
lettuce from two different wholesale distributors, in New York and
Illinois.
<p>
   Those two distributors, in turn, had a half-dozen or so
suppliers, Mermin said. One name in common was Fancy Cutt Farms, a
small California company that was just getting into the organic
business. Invoices showed that at the time of the outbreak, the
lettuce supplied to virtually all the Connecticut restaurants came
only from Fancy Cutt, Mermin said.
<p>
   Investigators later tested bacteria samples from people who had
been sick in the same time period in New York, another state where
Fancy Cutt had sent its lettuce. They found that seven people had
the same strain of E. coli, bringing the total number of cases to
61. The team concluded that the data were ``good enough to
implicate Fancy Cutt Farms,'' Mermin said. He added: ``It was the
weight of the evidence. Fancy Cutt could account for most of the
cases.''
<p>
   In mid-July, more than six weeks after the first reports of
illness, Mermin and investigators from the FDA and the California
and Connecticut health departments went to inspect Fancy Cutt
Farms. With the outbreak over and lettuce highly perishable,
investigators knew they would be unlikely to find contaminated
greens or E. coli O157:H7, Mermin said. And they did not.
<p>
   But what the investigators did find, they said, was profoundly
disturbing.
<p>
   The barn that was Fancy Cutt's processing shed was completely
open on one side, exposing the large, stainless steel tub where the
leaves of lettuce were washed before being mixed and shipped in
three-pound boxes. Less than 100 feet away were some cattle. Three
cows, owned by Fancy Cutt's landlord, sat in a pen just across a
small dirt parking area; at least two dozen more were in the next
pasture, brought in regularly for water.
<p>
   ``Routes of contamination'' were all around, wrote an FDA
inspector, Mary C.B. Acton. Cow feces could be blown into the shed
by wind, washed in by rain and tracked in on workers' boots, by
animals or by the birds investigators saw flying into the barn. Ms.
Acton noted that ``dust from the trucks and cars driving in and out
of the parking area and debris from the field is blown into the
wash tank and wash area.''

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Some of the lettuce was grown in a field where cows had grazed
in the winter, the report said, raising a possibility of
contamination through manure. Greens were carted to the washing
area in reused, ``dirt encrusted'' boxes that ``may carry
contamination into the processing area.'' In the wash tank, lettuce
was swished around by employees, some of whom did not wear gloves,
and who had no acceptable place to sanitize their hands. Ms. Acton
also wrote that the company had ``no quality control procedures.''
<p>
   Then there was the water. The inspectors found generic types of
E. coli in the wash water and on lettuce  &MD;  bacteria that are
harmless but which can indicate the possibility of toxic
contamination.
<p>
   The report said the well that supplied the washing water was 20
feet from the cattle pen and the mouth of a second well that
supplied some irrigation water was in a cattle pasture. It said no
chlorine, which can be used on organic foods to kill bacteria, was
added to the wash water, and no bacterial testing was done.
<p>
   Investigators said that in the weeks just before people got
sick, the wash water at Fancy Cutt was not changed often because
the farm appeared to be relying on a jerry-built filter system. The
system was clogged and not working properly, they said, and Mermin
believes the filter may have been a perfect environment for
bacteria to multiply. The FDA report said that Chavez, Fancy Cutt's
president, told investigators that on May 25, three weeks after it
was hooked up, the filter was disconnected.
<p>
   The period the filter was being used on recirculated water,
Mermin said, matched the timing when contaminated lettuce was
produced.
<p>
   ``The implicated lettuce stopped being shipped on a particular
day,'' Mermin said. ``That day was the day they stopped the filter
and started changing the water.''
<p>
   THE RESPONSE: FARM IS ALLOWED TO KEEP OPERATING
<p>
   With all their findings pointing to Fancy Cutt, the
investigators from the CDC, Connecticut and California health
departments issued a report that said the contaminated greens had
been traced to a single producer that processed its lettuce near
cattle and had the generic form of E. coli in its wash water.
<p>
   Still, they did not formally  &MD;  or publicly  &MD;  cite the company as
the source of the outbreak. That was because, in their visit six
weeks after the outbreak, the suspected lettuce was gone and they
did not find the same strain of E. coli that had sickened people
anywhere on the farm. They did not have the kind of scientific
proof they normally like to have to reach such a conclusion,
several investigators said.
<p>
   ``There was no evidence of continued contamination of lettuce,
otherwise we would have'' cited the company for the outbreak,
Mermin said. ``We believe we have good data.''
<p>
   As is customary with small-farm operations, the FDA let the
state address the problems investigators documented. California
cited Fancy Cutt for violations of its food-safety laws that July,
telling it to fix the most urgent threats first: the open shed, the
unchlorinated wash water, the unsanitary employee practices. But it
did not fine the company or try to close it, even temporarily.
State officials now say that they thought Fancy Cutt would correct
the problems.
<p>
   The company president, Robert Chavez, said he took the
authorities' low-key response  &MD;  and their failure to find the
harmful E. coli  &MD;  to mean that Fancy Cutt was cleared of
responsibility for the outbreak. He suggested that contamination
might have occurred when some distributors and stores added
ingredients to his lettuce mix and divided it into small plastic
bags and containers for retail.
<p>
   ``Why haven't I been closed down?'' he asked. ``Why haven't I
been sued? It's very simple. We were cleared of it.''
<p>
   Since the citations, Fancy Cutt has made some improvements. It
has better trained its workers, supplied them with gloves and
hairnets and replaced some equipment.
<p>
   But state officials say Fancy Cutt took months to correct some
of the most serious violations. And they say there are still
problems that could leave its lettuce vulnerable to bacteria.
<p>
   For example, while the company eventually began using chlorine
to kill bacteria in its wash water, the state is still not
confident about ``the overall cleanliness of the water, how often
it's changed out, the monitoring of the chlorine,'' Waddell said.
<p>
   And several months after the first inspection, the barn was
still wide open, said Alex Mamaril, a former operations manager at
Fancy Cutt. ``You had cows right there and the rain would come
right in there while we were processing, and that lettuce goes
right to somebody's table,'' he said.
<p>
   When a corrugated metal wall was put up, two large openings were
left in it, shielded only by plastic strips that can still allow in
dust, dirt and animals.
<p>
   In follow-up inspections last year, the state repeatedly pointed
out these and other problems, documents show. In May, the
inspectors reported that Fancy Cutt still had no acceptable
hand-washing facilities. The water in the wash tank had ``a brown
soil coloration,'' the inspectors said, and the shed ceiling had
``numerous cobwebs with numerous trapped insects directly over
exposed salads.'' Also, they said, ``Live birds and a bird nest
were observed inside the shed ceiling rafters.'' In both July and
September, they found washing equipment ``encrusted with grime'' or
containing ``a crust of rust.''
<p>
   Standing outside the shed on a recent afternoon, Leonard Chavez
acknowledged: ``It has to be absolutely spotless, I know that. It
has to be completely enclosed so that there's no way any unwanted
creature can get in. What you see here may look bad. You should
have seen it before.''
<p>
   Showing visitors fields striped with greens like lolla rossa and
tat soi, Leonard Chavez said that Fancy Cutt was beginning to shift
from selling lettuce mixtures to supplying other companies that
would be responsible for washing and mixing. He believes
state-of-the-art safety improvements would cost over $100,000, and
said Fancy Cutt, with sales of about $1 million a year, could not
afford it.

<p>
   Waddell defended the state's approach, saying regulators had
focused on learning about and working with the burgeoning industry
 &MD;  and creating voluntary safety guidelines with an industry group,
the Western Growers Association.
<p>
   ``Rather than seeking out individual bad actors,'' he said, ``we
try to get as much industry cooperation as possible.
<p>
   ``Initially, Fancy Cutt was making some effort to work with us,
but as time went on they were not progressing as quickly as we had
hoped.''
<p>
   At the health department's request, Harry Damkar, the San Benito
County district attorney, recently reviewed the case and said he
expects to file criminal misdemeanor charges against Fancy Cutt
soon for violating state food-safety laws. Asher Rubin, a deputy
state attorney general, said his office was also preparing a civil
suit against the company.
<p>
   Fancy Cutt, meanwhile, has just completed another growing
season. And even its landlord, Anthony Betancourt, said it had
taken much too long for the state to act. Betancourt, who said he
has never been asked to move his cows, was visibly distressed that
so many people had gotten sick. ``I wish,'' he said, ``they had
shut it down.''
<p>
   THE AFTERMATH: VOWS IN THE CAPITAL, FEAR IN THE KITCHEN
<p>
   The lettuce outbreak and others have spurred efforts in
Washington to overhaul a safety system dating to the turn of the
century.
<p>
   Just over a week ago, the Clinton administration said it would
seek an additional $71 million for food safety programs in the 1999
fiscal year, including some money for up to 100 new inspectors. The
administration is also asking Congress to give the FDA authority to
block imports of produce from countries that do not have inspection
systems as strong as the one here. But at the same time, cases like
Fancy Cutt show that the inspection network in this country has
more holes than people realize.
<p>
   To overcome these weaknesses, cooperation between state and
federal regulators ``must work better,'' said Dr. Michael A.
Friedman, the acting FDA commissioner.
<p>
   The FDA also wants the food industry to take more
responsibility. It is working on voluntary guidelines to encourage
safer handling of fruits and vegetables, and Friedman said he would
like to see fruit and vegetable companies develop hazard-control
plans to insure the destruction of contaminants.
<p>
   Some produce companies, however, say more research is needed to
identify the best safeguards.
<p>
   ``Our industry can't afford to lose consumer confidence in these
products,'' said John Aguirre, a lobbyist for the United Fresh
Fruit and Vegetable Association. ``On the other hand, we can't
afford to blindly change the way we operate because many of our
guys aren't that wealthy. We have to make reasonable changes where
we know they have practical effect.''
<p>
   But consumer advocates, and families hit by E. coli, have little
patience with such pleas.
<p>
   In Connecticut, Haylee Bernstein is in nursery school and her
curly brown hair has grown back since her brain surgery. But a loss
of certain brain cells has limited how much she can see to her
right. And the family does not know if there will be other medical
problems.
<p>
   Everything the Bernsteins eat is scrutinized, sanitized. When a
restaurant served Haylee a piece of chocolate cake, Mrs. Bernstein
plucked off the strawberry on top.
<p>
   At home, Mrs. Bernstein sprays all produce with an
anti-bacterial wash, even though it is not certified as effective
by the FDA. Only recently, because her daughter begged her, has
Mrs. Bernstein bought lettuce. She spends 40 minutes washing it,
going over and over every leaf.
<p>
   After Haylee got sick, Mrs. Bernstein said, ``I went through a
kind of guilt thing because I fed it to them. But then I realized,
I was really just sitting in the house and an A-bomb fell on me.''
<p>
   She added, ``The reaction I get from people is, `Lettuce. You
mean lettuce?'''

turned into a killer.

<p>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif.  &MD;  In the courtroom here where Theodore
Kaczynski is on trial for his life, Monday morning is expected to
bring a singular image of brother facing brother.
<p>
   The morning is the scheduled start of the trial of Kaczynski,
55, the man prosecutors say should be executed as the Unabomber,
the anti-technology crusader who for years eluded one of the
country's largest and costliest manhunts.
<p>
   But the event that may overshadow the start of the long-awaited
proceedings is the first appearance in court of Kaczynski's younger
brother, David, who will plead for the life of the sibling he
turned in.
<p>
   It was David Kaczynski who told the authorities in 1996 that his
reclusive brother might be the man the government said had killed
three people and injured 28 others in a bombing campaign that
lasted nearly two decades.
<p>
   The story of brother turning in brother is a tale of literary
dimensions that has become the central narrative of the case.
Across the country it is not the prosecution's hoard of evidence
but the story of a brother fighting to save the life of the brother
he turned in that people mention first when they speak about the
trial.
<p>
   Some experts on the lure of great literature said David
Kaczynski's dilemma was gripping because it involved the classic
elements of important stories: questions of family loyalty,
betrayal and social duty.
<p>
   ``It was high drama: the brother having to come to this
decision,'' said William Kennedy, the novelist and winner of a
Pulitzer Prize. ``It is a kind of benevolent Cain and Abel story.''
<p>
   Kennedy said people seemed torn at first between praising and
condemning David Kaczynski's actions, for the same reasons that
informers have historically been condemned, and occasionally
forgiven, in literature.
<p>
   The story of David Kaczynski's choice seemed like the outline of
a great American novel from the start, said John Orr, a professor
of American literature at the University of Portland in Oregon.
<p>
   ``It relates to a kind of a split reflected in American
literature between a public and a private self,'' Orr said. ``We
have a strong emphasis in this country on the family and at the
same time a strong sense of civic duty. It tears in two directions:
`What is the right thing to do?' That split between the public and
the private self is a classic conflict that characters face in
literature, particularly in the 20th century.''
<p>
   The details of the story of the Kaczynski brothers are as
emotionally powerful as any invented by a novelist. David
Kaczynski, seven years younger than Theodore, once admired his
brother as only a younger brother can.
<p>
   But David Kaczynski's lawyer, Anthony Bisceglie, said on Friday
that the defendant has refused to see his younger brother not only
since his arrest in 1996, but for a decade before that.
<p>
   When the two men see each other in court on Monday, it will be
the first time since 1986.
<p>
   It is expected that Wanda Kaczynski, the mother of the two men,
will accompany David Kaczynski to court on Monday. Bisceglie said
she would be there to support David and, as best she can, Theodore.
<p>
   From the start of the family's public ordeal, Wanda Kaczynski
has said that David did what he had to do to save lives and that
Theodore was suffering from psychological demons that have plagued
him since childhood.
<p>
   Bisceglie said it has been perhaps 16 years since Theodore
Kaczynski has permitted any contact with his mother.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But though the tale of the brothers has become the emotional
spine of the Kaczynski trial, the case is packed with characters
representing such sharply different parts of the country's tableau
that it is a uniquely American story.
<p>
   The chief prosecutor, Robert Cleary, a 42-year-old Manhattanite,
is the son of a retired New York City police officer. One of the
chief defense lawyers, Quin Denvir, 57, grew up on Chicago's South
Side, the son of a lawyer who was a precinct captain for legendary
Mayor Richard Daley. The other chief defense lawyer, Judy Clarke,
was raised in what she has described as a conservative ``impeach
Earl Warren'' kind of household in Asheville, N.C.
<p>
   The judge, Garland Burrell Jr., 50, grew up in South Central Los
Angeles, where Garland Burrell Sr. still owns a liquor store.
Burrell is the only black judge for the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of California, which is responsible for cases from
Bakersfield to the Oregon border.
<p>
   The courthouse, a few blocks from the California Capitol, is the
same one in which Lynette Fromme, a disciple of the mass murderer
Charles Manson, was convicted of trying to kill President Gerald
Ford by pointing a gun at him in 1975.
<p>
   The prosecutors' job as they begin their case on Monday will be
to try to shift the focus of the trial. The public  &MD;  and, very
likely, the jurors  &MD;  seems fascinated by the tale of the brothers.
The prosecution must now seek to direct the attention of the
jurors, at least, to the people killed, maimed or left in grief by
the Unabomber.
<p>
   That, too, is a story rich with the American experience. Hugh
Scrutton, an adventurous Sacramento computer store owner, was
killed by a bomb, disguised to look like a piece of wood, that was
left outside his store in 1985. He was 38. Scrutton dabbled in
pottery and had traveled the world. As a young idealist in the
1960s, he had worked for Eugene McCarthy's campaign for president.
He left a mother and a sister.
<p>
   Gilbert Murray, who was 47 when he died from a bomb blast here
in 1995, was a forestry official. But he was also a husband and a
father of two boys, who were 16 and 18 on the day Murray opened a
package addressed to his predecessor as president of the California
Forestry Association. At his funeral, according to The Sacramento
Bee, Murray's 18-year-old son, Wil, delivered a eulogy. He called
his father ``the greatest man I ever met.''
<p>
   The Unabomber's targets also included a Yale computer scientist;
the president of an airline; assorted students and airplane
travelers whose planes he tried or threatened to bomb; a New Jersey
advertising executive, Thomas Mosser, who was killed by a bomb in
1994; and a renowned American geneticist, Charles Epstein, who has
worked to understand Down syndrome and who survived a bomb that
ripped at his body in 1993.
<p>
   The prosecution will tell jurors about the lives of those
people. In a sense, the trial will be a collection of competing
stories: of the people who were targets of the bombs, and their
sisters, sons and wives; and of the Kaczynski brothers.

   LONDON  &MD;  The outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland has drawn
calls for asserting greater government authority at the province's
top-security prison, where paramilitary groups exercise largely
uncontested internal control.
<p>
   Protestant politicians have demanded a public inquiry into how a
leader of a Protestant paramilitary force, Billy Wright, 37, was
shot to death inside the Maze prison 10 days ago by inmates who
were members of a Catholic paramilitary group.
<p>
   The killing led to two vengeance attacks on Roman Catholic
gatherings by gunmen from Wright's group that left two men dead and
eight others wounded and cast a darkening shadow over the peace
talks under way in Belfast.
<p>
   The British government turned aside the demand for a public
inquiry but set up two official investigations, one of the killing
and the other of the overall situation in the prison, which is
outside Belfast. It has said it will publish the results.
<p>
   But even those taking part in the investigations have warned
that it will be difficult to change the conduct of an institution
that is peculiar to the troubled province, where sectarian violence
has claimed more than 3,200 lives since 1969. More than 20,000
people  &MD;  including virtually all the Irish peace negotiators  &MD;  have
served prison time in the name of politics.
<p>
   ``There can never be any guarantee of complete security in any
prison, and especially a prison of this nature,'' said Adam Ingram,
the Minister for Security in Northern Ireland. ``That is the world
in which politicians must live.''
<p>
   ``Nowhere is there such a concentration of dedicated
paramilitaries and terrorists,'' he added, ``and that does make for
a unique situation.''
<p>
   More than 600 members of Catholic and Protestant paramilitary
groups inhabit the imposing fortress-like building in the suburban
village of Maze, segregated by group into eight H-shaped blocks
within 16-foot high walls bristling with guard towers, cameras and
searchlights. Armed British soldiers patrol the flood-lit
perimeter.
<p>
   Inside their wings, the prisoners are never locked into their
cells, and guards cannot search their living spaces without gaining
the approval of inmate leaders and telling them a day ahead of time
where they intend to look.
<p>
   In an Irish Republican Army escape attempt uncovered in March,
inmates had managed to keep undetected, in their wings, 13 tons of
earth they had dug up to make their tunnel.
<p>
   The prisoners elect their own leaders, called ``officers
commanding,'' who negotiate directly with the governor of the Maze,
Martin Mogg. These officers control their autonomous areas,
assigned according to membership in one of the two Catholic or four
Protestant paramilitary groups. Cells can have televisions, and
prisoners have access to computers, washing machines and mobile
phones.
<p>
   The regime at the Maze dates from 20 years ago, when the IRA
sought to obtain political-prisoner status for jailed militants.
The campaign began with refusals to wear prison uniforms or to do
assigned labor and ended starkly with the hunger strike of 1981,
when Bobby Sands and nine other republican inmates starved
themselves to death.
<p>
   Since then, British governments have treated the imprisoned
paramilitaries as political prisoners in everything but name.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The inmates have shown their growing power in ways ranging from
the menacing to the cooperative. Over the last two decades, 22
prison guards and a deputy governor of the Maze have been killed
outside the prison by IRA gunmen who were given the victims'
identities by inmates. More recently, Protestant paramilitaries,
acting on information from inside, have fire-bombed the homes of
other officials.
<p>
   Leaders in the Maze still have authority with the members of the
paramilitary groups and prisoner support organizations outside, and
it is accepted that the mainstream groups that agreed to
cease-fires in recent years needed the approval of their jailed
colleagues to do so.
<p>
   More than 500 inmates have gained early release and are now
involved in community projects. Many received university degrees
while in prison and are now considered strong advocates of
nonviolence.
<p>
   In the aftermath of the escape of Liam Averill, an IRA killer,
on Dec. 10 during a Christmas party for inmates' children and the
killing of Wright on Dec. 27, David Trimble, head of the largest
Protestant political party, the Ulster Unionists, accused the
British government of ``appeasing terrorists'' with its stewardship
of the Maze and demanded an independent public investigation.
Finlay Spratt, spokesman for the Northern Ireland Prison Officers
Association, said concessions to prisoners had turned the Maze into
an ``academy of terror.''
<p>
   Ingram, the security minister, said a policy of random searches
of the wings would begin shortly. The last time the prison
authorities tried that, in April, Protestant militants took over
their H-blocks, climbed onto the roofs from their exercise yards
and set watchtowers on fire. In August, 30 members of Wright's
renegade Loyalist Volunteer Force, seeking the same treatment as
prisoners from the larger paramilitary groups, burned their own
wing.
<p>
   The next day, after seeing the damage, Deaglan de Breadun, the
Northern Ireland editor of The Irish Times, had a parting thought.
``Leaving,'' he said,'' one could only conclude that there will be
no permanent peace in the North until all possible justification
for the Maze prison has disappeared and the wretched place has been
demolished brick by brick.''

   Kansas City, Missouri, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Terrell Davis
rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns as the Denver Broncos
defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 14-10 in an AFC divisional playoff
game.
<p>
   The Broncos advance to next week's AFC championship game in
Pittsburgh against the Steelers. Pittsburgh won an earlier meeting
against the Broncos at Three Rivers Stadium 35-21, rallying from a
21-7 first half deficit.
<p>
   In Sunday's first National Football League playoff game, Dorsey
Levens rushed for a team playoff record 112 yards and a touchdown
as the Green Bay Packers defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21-7 to
advance to their third straight NFC championship game.
<p>
   The Packers will be on the road to face the San Francisco 49ers
in next week's NFC title game. Green Bay has eliminated the 49ers
from the playoffs the past two years.
<p>
   At Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Davis scored the go-ahead
touchdown for the Broncos with 12:32 left in the fourth quarter and
Darrien Gordon knocked down a pass at the goal line in the closing
seconds to preserve the victory.
<p>
   It's the second time in three years that the Chiefs have come
into the playoffs as the AFC's top seed and lost in their first
game. Two years ago, Kansas City was beaten at home by the
Indianapolis Colts 10-7.
<p>
   Denver took a 7-0 halftime lead on a one-yard touchdown run by
Davis with under two minutes left in the second quarter. The Chiefs
had appeared to grab the first lead of the game on a 34-yard field
goal by Pete Stoyanovich earlier in the quarter, however they were
forced to kick again after a holding call. A second attempt by
Stoyanovich, this time from 44 yards after the penalty, bounced off
the left upright.
<p>
   In the third quarter, Stoyanovich hit a 20-yard field goal to
pull the Chiefs within 7-3. The score came after tight end Tony
Gonzalez made a leaping catch in the end zone, however he couldn't
get his feet down in bounds and Kansas City was forced to go for
the field goal.
<p>
   The Chiefs took a 10-7 late in the third quarter when Elvis
Grbac connected with Gonzalez for a 12-yard touchdown. The score
was set up by a 50-yard reception by Joe Horn which moved the
Chiefs down to the Broncos' 14-yard line.
<p>
   On the next possession, Denver got good field position after a
penalty on the kickoff and moved down to the Kansas City one-yard
line when Elway hooked up with Ed McCaffery for a 43-yard
completion. Davis was able to bull his way into the end zone on his
third attempt to give the Broncos the lead for good.
<p>
   ``We wanted to control the clock and make some big plays,'' said
Elway, who was 10-of-17 for 170 yards. ``We were able to do that
and when we did get in the red zone we were able to score. That was
the key.''
<p>
   With their final opportunity, the Chiefs drove down to the
Denver 17-yard line, completing a fourth-and-nine play along the
way. Grbac's final pass into the end zone on fourth-and-one was
batted down by Gordon with 12 seconds left on the clock.
<p>
   ``This is a sweet victory, but not our goal,'' said Broncos
defensive end Neil Smith. ``We have to go to a hostile place to
play now against a team that beat us last time.''
<p>
   The Broncos improve their record to 14-4 and will prepare for
their first conference title game since losing to Buffalo during
the 1991 season. Denver is looking to become only the third wild
card team in history to advance to the Super Bowl. The Chiefs ended
the season with a 13-4 mark.
<p>
   At Lambeau Field, where the game-time temperature was in the
20s, the Packers improved to 12-0 all-time in home playoff games
and extended their home-field winning streak to 27.
<p>
   Brett Favre threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mark
Chmura in the first quarter, and Ryan Longwell kicked field goals
of 21 and 32 yards in the second quarter to give the Packers a 13-0
halftime lead.
<p>
   Tampa Bay had its chances. The Buccaneers squandered three
field-goal opportunities and had two turnovers in the first half.
After Michael Husted had a 43-yard field goal blocked in the first
quarter, the Bucs also failed on a fake field-goal attempt and had
a bad snap on another attempt during the second quarter.
<p>
   The Buccaneers pulled within 13-7 in the third quarter as
fullback Mike Alstott scored on a 6-yard run to cap an eight-play,
94-yard drive.
<p>
   Levens, who had just 98 combined yards in two regular season
games against the Buccaneers, rushed for 101 yards in the second
half to keep the Packers in control. He scored on a 2-yard run with
13:37 left and Favre ran for the two-point conversion to extend the
Packers' lead to 21-7.
<p>
   ``The second half, we came out and moved the ball,'' said Favre,
who completed 15 of 28 passes for 190 yards with two interceptions.
``That was definitely the difference. We just capitalized when we
had the chances and made some plays.''
<p>
   Favre improved his record to 23-0 at home when the kickoff
temperature is less than 35 degrees, while the Buccaneers fell to
0-17 all-time when the temperature at kickoff is below 40 degrees.

<TEXT>
<p>
   There was a time when the world of food and dining wasn't
constantly buffeted by winds of fashion, a time when folks pretty
much ate what their ancestors ate, their meals tied to ancient
rhythms of place and season. Only occasionally would conquest,
exploration or trade introduce new tastes or techniques to the
table.
<p>
   But that was long, long ago. Today, you can't tell the cuisines
without a scorecard, and there seems no end to the inventiveness of
chefs and their eagerness to fuse a medley of influences from
around the globe. No less than with shoes or street slang, it's
what's new and now that gets the buzz.
<p>
   Herewith, then, for both dining out and eating in, are some of
the trends cresting in Seattle as 1997 gives way to 1998.
<p>
   Grazing
<p>
   Diners today like to nibble a little bit here and there, instead
of centering each meal around a big entree  &MD;  or settling for what
they ordered for themselves. So menus list ``big plates,'' ``small
plates'' and ``plates for sharing.''
<p>
   The Napoleonic era
<p>
   Once, a ``Napoleon'' meant a specific French pastry. Now the
term applies to almost any dish stacked in layers, whether
appetizer, entree or dessert, and they're taking over the world.
<p>
   Wood-fired
<p>
   Seems like every new restaurant worth its salt (see below)
installs a wood-fired oven for its individual pizzas and other
rustic fare. Northwest wood of choice: apple.
<p>
   Metamartinis and more
<p>
   The martini came back a few years ago. Now it's mutating, into
flavored martinis laced with all manner of ingredients, and
expanding, into jumbo martinis. Other classic cocktails are
resurging, too: Seattle's new Sazerac restaurant is even named
after one.
<p>
   Down-home desserts
<p>
   Crumbles and cobblers and lots of other warm, comforting goodies
are pushing aside the champagne-ginger sorbets. It's Grandma as
pastry chef.
<p>
   Pinotage
<p>
   The end of apartheid also signaled an end to South Africa's
economic isolation. The country's winemaking tradition is 300 years
old, and exports to the United States are growing. Pinotage is a
uniquely South African grape varietal, a cross of pinot noir and
cinsaut, making medium-bodied red wines.
<p>
   Isn't it organic?
<p>
   The organic food business is mushrooming, so to speak. It's
moved out of health food stores into the mainstream. At the same
time, farmers' markets are sprouting like alfalfa.
<p>
   Back to Sorrento
<p>
   The relentless search for good, affordable wine has focused on
Southern Italy, where bargains still can be had. Southern Italian
and Sicilian cooking, too, look ripe for revival, as risotto-weary
foodies delve below the tomato-red surface.
<p>
   Pumpkin
<p>
   As in pumpkin tarts, pumpkin gnocchi, pumpkin ice cream, even
restaurant walls painted in soft shades of mottled pumpkin.
<p>
   Well, hush my puppies
<p>
   Southern cooking heats up as the American regional cuisine
currently in fashion. Cornbread, molasses and grits go upscale.
<p>
   Pan-roasted
<p>
   More than just roasting something in a pan, it's a technique
that calls for searing fish or meat in a skillet atop the stove,
then finishing the cooking in the oven.
<p>
   Harissa and company
<p>
   Harissa is a fiery spice mix from Tunisia traditionally used to
flavor couscous. The Mediterranean Rim thing is still going strong,
with the emphasis increasing on North African flavors.
<p>
   Not Grandpa's pocket watch
<p>
   Heirloom fruits and vegetables, long-neglected varieties
displaced by their overbred, Hollywood-casting cousins, reclaim
their birthright. What they lose in looks they gain in
authenticity.
<p>
   Spanish accents
<p>
   Better late than never, the spotlight falls on Spain as a source
of fine food and drink, from cheese (Manchego, Cabrales) to wine
(Rioja, Ribera del Duero) to olive oil (gold, green and everything
in between). Portugal's reputation also rises for winemaking that
goes beyond port.
<p>
   'Tis the seasoning
<p>
   Salt isn't just salt anymore. It's sea salt. And sel gris. And
kosher salt. Both restaurant chefs and home cooks are getting savvy
about salt.
<p>
   Hard-pressed
<p>
   In Colonial days, ``hard'' cider  &MD;  the fermented, alcoholic kind
 &MD;  ruled as America's most popular drink. After almost disappearing,
it's regaining popularity, squeezing onto supermarket shelves next
to beer and ale. Look for more boutique brands, domestic and
imported, to appear and for cidery dishes on restaurant menus.
<p>
   Wet, tart and tingly
<p>
   Vinaigrette is not just for salads anymore, with fancy, flavored
versions dressing up seafood and other main courses, too. And brisk
little dipping sauces turn up everywhere, often Asian-influenced
numbers in the ginger-lime-soy vein.
<p>
   TRENDS IN A WORD OR THREE
<p>
   Pomegranates
<p>
   Braised greens
<p>
   Legumes
<p>
   Grains  &MD;  say KEEN-wah (quinoa)
<p>
   Skate wings

 &UR; DOLLAR LITTLE CHANGED VS YEN AMID CONCERN OVER BOJ INTERVENTION &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar was little changed
against the yen amid concern Japan may sell dollars to slow the
yen's decline, traders said.
<p>
   The Bank of Japan last month sold an estimated $10 billion when
the dollar topped 131 yen.
<p>
   ``Traders are wary about possible intervention because the
dollar is now hovering way above the level that the Bank of Japan
intervened last time,'' said Tetsu Aikawa, manager for foreign
exchange at Sanwa Bank ltd. ``The dollar, however, will possibly
top 140 yen by June this year as intervention alone cannot change
the recent weak-yen trend.''
<p>
   The dollar was quoted at 132.45 yen, compared with 132.32 yen in
late New York trading Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.8014
marks, compared with 1.8025 marks in New York.
<p>
   Friday, when the Tokyo market was closed for New Year holidays,
the dollar rose as high as 132.65 yen, its highest since reaching
133 yen on May 12, 1992.
<p>
   The yen has fallen since July 4, when it was trading at 113.53
to the dollar, as concern intensified over Japan's economic woes --
an economic slowdown verging on recession, rising bad loans and a
string of major corporate bankruptcies. To turn the situation
around, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and government have
announced a secession of proposals over recent months.
<p>
   The ruling party has proposed measures to help revive consumer
spending and bail out troubled financial institutions. The steps
include a one-time, 2 trillion yen ($15.4 billion) income tax cut
and up to 30 trillion yen ($230 billion) in public money to buy
stock in financial institutions and protect depositors from bank
failures.
<p>
   Still, many traders say the proposals are not effective enough
to spur consumer spending or to prevent more financial institutions
from collapsing.
<p>
   ``Theses measures presented by now could be an embankment for
the yen's further decline, but won't contribute to the reversal of
the yen's weakness,'' said Aikawa. ``For the yen to recover, the
Japanese government needs to come up with effective measures to
stimulate the economy.''
<p>
   Against the mark, the dollar also rose on expectation that
Germany's economy isn't emerging from a five-year slowdown fast
enough to prompt the Bundesbank to raise interest rates anytime
soon.
<p>
   The Bundesbank has kept its securities repurchase rate, which
sets the target for overnight lending, at 3.30 percent since Oct.9,
1996.
<p>
   ``The dollar is mighty not only against the yen, but also
against the mark, as the U.S. economy outpaces economies in Japan
and Germany,'' said Makoto Sato, manger for foreign exchange at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
<p>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4612 Swiss francs,
compared with 1.4702 Swiss francs in late New York trading Friday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.6420, compared with $1.6450
Friday. The mark was quoted at 73.40 yen, compared with 73.40 yen
in New York.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against a basket of 10 major
currencies tracked by Finex, a financial futures exchange. The
Finex dollar index was last at 99.90, compared with 100.10 Friday.

<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand  &MD;  Six months after leading a coup in which he
ousted his coalition partner, Cambodia's leader, Hun Sen, is still
struggling to consolidate political and military control in a
country that is less stable than ever.
<p>
   He has also failed to win the international legitimacy he sought
as criticism continues from abroad about his government's human
rights abuses and repression.
<p>
   With an election expected later this year, these are some of the
ways the political, military and international pressures on Hun Sen
have begun to intensify:
<p>
    &MD; Opposition politicians who fled the country after the July 6
coup have begun to return and reorganize. Norodom Ranariddh, the
coalition partner who was driven from power by Hun Sen, says he
plans to return this month despite Hun Sen's threat to put him on
trial.
<p>
    &MD; Fighting has flared again near a remote northern stronghold
controlled by soldiers who support the opposition. Despite the
rebels' small numbers, Hun Sen's troops have made little headway
against them.
<p>
    &MD; Two human rights officials from the United Nations are due to
visit Phnom Penh, the capital, this month and are expected to voice
concern about continuing abuses that could threaten the legitimacy
of the election. Support from the United Nations is critical to
international acceptance of the results.
<p>
   The election, which had been scheduled for May, has already been
postponed until this summer or fall because of political
instability that has made it impossible to organize the voting
process on time.
<p>
   It was unclear who might benefit the most from the delay.
``There are a lot of parties being formed and a lot of money going
around,'' a Western diplomat said.
<p>
   The election is crucial to the re-establishment of democracy and
political legitimacy in a country where both have deteriorated
since a United Nations-sponsored election in 1993 that followed a
decade of civil war.
<p>
   It was that election that put in place the fatally flawed
coalition led by Hun Sen and Ranariddh, former enemies in that war.
<p>
   This year's election, whenever it is held, is also seen as a
potential flashpoint. It was intensifying pre-election maneuvering
by both sides last year  &MD;  including arms buildups and troop
movements  &MD;  that led to Hun Sen's coup.
<p>
   Though he has been unable to consolidate his control, Hun Sen
has placed himself in a commanding position, purging rival
politicians through political pressure, intimidation and violence.
<p>
   The shattering of the coalition government also opened the way
for maneuvering among various factions, including opposition
politicians who are returning to the country. A prominent
dissident, Sam Rainsy, led anti-government demonstrations after his
return last fall.
<p>
   ``The losers are fighting back and the winners are fighting for
legitimacy,'' said Lao Mong Hay, who heads the Khmer Institute for
Democracy. ``Since July, Hun Sen has suffered a number of serious
setbacks. International pressure has made him more vulnerable.''
<p>
   Opposition to Hun Sen's coup has remained strong abroad. The
United Nations refused to let his government represent Cambodia,
and the Association of Southeast Nations deferred its plan to admit
Cambodia as a member last year.
<p>
   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund withheld
funds. A number of foreign governments, including the United
States, reduced aid. The economy came under severe pressure with a
withdrawal of foreign investment and the near-disappearance of
tourism.
<p>
   Although these pressures have taken a toll, Hun Sen has remained

without leaders, without values, without principles, without a
platform and without a working structure.''

<p>
   GREEN BAY, Wis.  &MD;  The Green Bay Packers can now say they have
reached that true championship level where a team can overcome its
own foibles and still win.
<p>
   After a bye week, the Packers weren't the sharpest knife in the
drawer. But they had enough of an edge to dice up the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, division rivals who weren't intimidated by the Lambeau
Field mystique, the 60,327 screaming fans or a frigid forecast.
<p>
   Green Bay's 21-7 victory sends the Packers to San Francisco next
week to play the 49ers in the National Football Conference
championship game.
<p>
   ``We were off two weeks and we were ready to play,'' said
Packers quarterback Brett Favre, who threw for 190 yards and one
touchdown.
<p>
   ``But we know we can play better,'' added Favre, who had two
interceptions and was sacked four times.
<p>
   Green Bay (14-3) is one step away from its second consecutive
Super Bowl. But if the Packers commit three turnovers, have a
touchdown on a kickoff return called back because of a penalty,
have seven penalties for 90 yards, and have numerous clutch passes
dropped by receivers next week, then look for the 49ers to go to
the Super Bowl in San Diego on Jan. 25.
<p>
   The Packers avoided expulsion from the playoffs Sunday afternoon
on the strength of a pair of big third-down plays late in the third
quarter and a defense that refused to cave in when Tampa Bay (11-7)
applied some offensive pressure.
<p>
   ``We were a little sluggish out there at first,'' Packers
defensive tackle Santana Dotson said. ``But when we locked down and
just executed our plays, we were fine.''
<p>
   The Packers' defense managed to keep Bucs quarterback Trent
Dilfer from making several big plays, although his 52-yard pass to
receiver Reidel Anthony helped set up Tampa Bay's only touchdown
and narrowed the game to 13-7 with 6 minutes 17 seconds left in the
third quarter. The defense also contained running backs Warrick
Dunn (18 carries for 64 yards) and Mike Alstott (7 carries for 21
yards).
<p>
   The Packers' offense was stymied by turnovers. Besides Favre's
two interceptions (both by cornerback Donnie Abraham), he fumbled a
snap, which he recovered, and was stripped of the football on a
sack by Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp, which the Packers were
also fortunate to recover.
<p>
   Packers Coach Mike Holmgren said he was thankful that a couple
of players  &MD;  running back Dorsey Levens and receiver Derrick Mayes
 &MD;  came through on a late drive when the Packers were clinging to a
lead and, in the words of the defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur,
trying to avert disaster.
<p>
   Levens rushed 25 times for 112 yards and a touchdown and
established a Packers record for most rushing yards in a
post-season game. ``He's a big guy that kind of just wears on you
after a while,'' Packers center Frank Winters said of Levens.
``He's really tough to bring down, because he runs so low to the
ground.''
<p>
   On Sunday, Levens showed a desire that many thought might be
missing from a team that has already won a Super Bowl. Late in the
third quarter, the Packers were faced with a third-and-6 at the 50
when Favre threw a swing pass to Levens, who was met by Tampa Bay
linebacker Hardy Nickerson. Nickerson could have dropped Levens for
a loss, but Levens twisted free and headed up the field. Bucs
safety John Lynch tried to hit Levens, but bounced off. Levens
picked up 18 yards on the play and the drive continued.
<p>
   After Favre was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Sapp and threw an
incomplete pass, the Packers were faced with a third-and-18 at the
Tampa Bay 45. Favre threw a missile to Mayes, who snared the ball
for a 23-yard gain. Levens capped the drive with a 2-yard touchdown
run and Favre ran in the 2-point conversion to make the score 21-7.
<p>
   ``That third-and-18 play just sticks out in my mind as the play
of the game,'' said Sapp, who forced two fumbles and sacked Favre
three times. ``If we stop them there, it's a different ball game.''
<p>
   The Bucs spent much of the first half misfiring on field-goal
attempts and trying to establish their rushing attack. Bucs kicker
Michael Husted's first field-goal attempt, a 43-yarder in the first
quarter, was blocked by defensive tackle Bob Kuberski, who managed
to scoot up the middle and get his hand on the ball just after it
left Husted's foot.
<p>
   Early in the second quarter, Husted had another 43-yard attempt
lined up, but Bucs Coach Tony Dungy called for a fake. Quarterback
Steve Walsh, the holder, tossed a shovel pass to tight end John
Davis, who was dropped for no gain by Packers defensive end Keith
McKenzie.
<p>
   The Bucs' third field-goal attempt, a 31-yarder, failed because
the snap sailed over Walsh's hands, and Husted had to fall on the
ball to recover it at the Packers' 38.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Packers were hurt by turnovers and dropped
passes. Favre threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mark
Chmura to open the scoring at 5:36 of the first quarter. Early in
the second quarter, Favre threw a rifle shot to fullback William
Henderson that would have been good for a touchdown, but Henderson
couldn't hang on, so Green Bay settled for a 21-yard field goal by
kicker Ryan Longwell that made it 10-0. Longwell kicked a 32-yard
field goal near the end of the half to gave the Packers a 13-0
halftime lead.
<p>
   To open the third quarter, Antonio Freeman, who had been asked
to return kickoffs this week to spark the return game, ran the ball
back 90 yards for an apparent touchdown. But it was nullified after
cornerback Darren Sharper was flagged for a holding penalty.
<p>
   ``I saw the hole and I hit it,'' Freeman said. ``I saw the flag
go down, but I just never stopped running. I was disappointed that
it was called back, but what can you do?''
<p>
   The Bucs tightened the game up with an 8-play, 94-yard drive
capped by a 6-yard run by Alstott that made the score 13-7 in the
third quarter. The drive took the crowd out of the game and shifted
the momentum to Tampa Bay. But the Packers stole it right back with
the drive that included those two key third-down conversions.
<p>
   ``Their defense had been on the field for a long time and if we
could have just gotten the ball back for our offense, which was hot
then, the outcome might have been different,'' Sapp said. ``We just
couldn't do it. They made the plays when they needed them. That's
what makes them a championship team.''

<p>
   DETROIT  &MD;  Having fiercely but unsuccessfully opposed a
global-warming treaty and other environmental initiatives last
year, U.S. automakers are stepping up their research into cleaner,
more fuel-efficient cars, and making ambitious plans for bringing
their advanced designs to market.
<p>
   General Motors Corp., until now skeptical about the demand for
such vehicles, on Sunday unveiled several prototypes of midsized
cars that would get 60 to 80 miles per gallon, and said that one of
the designs would be ready for mass production in 2001 and another
by 2004. The automaker called for new federal subsidies to speed
the introduction of such vehicles, including tax credits and
government installation of equipment to recharge electric vehicles.
<p>
   Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, also said in an interview
Sunday that while the new vehicles were likely to be introduced
first in Europe, where high gas prices make them more attractive,
the automaker was prepared to support a modest increase in U.S.
taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels to make high-mileage
vehicles more popular in the United States.
<p>
   Ford Motor Co. plans a press conference on Monday morning to
display its latest inventions, including a prototype for a midsized
sedan weighing just 2,000 pounds  &MD;  1,300 pounds less than a similar
Ford Taurus. And on Tuesday, Chrysler Corp. plans to show off its
latest design for a car powered by both diesel and electricity.
<p>
   ``No car company will be able to thrive in the 21st century if
it relies solely on internal combustion engines,'' said John F.
Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, adding that the
company was stepping up its research spending and focusing on
bringing the new vehicles to market.
<p>
   Some of these moves may partly reflect a desire to answer
critics of the automakers' soaring sales of gas-guzzling
sport-utility vehicles.
<p>
   Selling more high-mileage, advanced-technology vehicles would
also allow the automakers to sell more low-mileage gas guzzlers and
still meet federally mandated averages for the overall fuel economy
of the vehicles they sell. All the automakers have also been
cautious about insisting that they will not build advanced,
high-mileage cars if no one wants to buy them.
<p>
   But the tone of Detroit executives in talking about high-mileage
vehicles has nonetheless been shifting in recent weeks. After years
of dismissing advanced-technology vehicles as impractical and too
expensive to build, the executives are beginning to show genuine
interest.
<p>
   The Detroit automakers' sudden enthusiasm for cleaner cars
partly reflects commercial realities. When the U.S. automakers
joined forces last summer with oil and coal industries to set up a
lobbying campaign against an international agreement to limit
global warming, their Japanese rivals declined to participate.
<p>
   Then in October, Japanese automakers stunned the international
auto industry by unveiling several very fuel-efficient,
low-emission cars at the Tokyo Motor Show.
<p>
   U.S. and European manufacturers were caught flat-footed in
Tokyo, still showing off high-performance but gas-guzzling sports
cars and sport-utility vehicles.
<p>
   Smith said in an interview Sunday evening that the Tokyo Motor
Show had made a profound impression, leaving him with the
conclusion that GM would have to be a leader in high-mileage cars
with extremely low emissions.
<p>
   ``It crystallized in my mind we needed to do a good job on
that,'' he said.
<p>
   William Ford Jr., the powerful chairman of the finance committee
on Ford Motor's board of directors, said that whichever automaker
reached the market first with a reasonably priced, alternative-fuel
vehicle would win a significant competitive advantage.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Fuel-cell engines use chemical reactions to produce power,
instead of burning fuels like an internal-combustion engine. GM
announced Sunday that it hoped to have a fuel-cell-powered car
ready for mass production by 2004, and a hybrid car powered by both
a gasoline engine and an electric engine by 2001.
<p>
   Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president for product
strategy, said Sunday that his company's latest prototype, to be
unveiled on Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show
in Detroit, would represent ``the most pragmatic approach yet to
future power trains.'' But Chrysler, which is just half the size of
GM and Ford, has not been able to devote the same resources as its
larger rivals to the development of advanced vehicles.
<p>
   Ford already holds 95 percent of the United States' small market
for alternative-fuel vehicles that run on natural gas, propane,
alcohol or electricity. Almost all of the buyers are government
agencies, which buy them because of federal mandates, and utilities
that have virtually free supplies of electricity or natural gas.
<p>
   But GM's decisions really set the pace for the global auto
industry because it remains the world's largest automaker, selling
a sixth of the world's cars and trucks.
<p>
   Even with heavy imports and growing production in the United
States, all of the European and Japanese automakers combined still
do not sell as many cars and trucks each year in the United States
as General Motors, which holds nearly 31 percent of the U.S.
market. So GM's increased interest in alternative-fuel vehicles
could make a big difference in the long term.
<p>
   GM has been leasing the world's first mass-produced electric
car, the EV-1, with little success for the last year in Arizona and
California. Robert Purcell, GM's director of advanced vehicles,
announced Sunday that the automaker would introduce a new battery
this autumn that would double the car's range between rechargings,
to 160 miles.
<p>
   The automaker also plans to introduce a new electric engine then
that will have half the cost, half the size and a third fewer parts
than the engine introduced a year ago.
<p>
   Purcell said that the automaker would charge more for cars with
the new battery than for cars with the current battery, which will
continue to be offered. GM currently leases the EV-1 for $399 a
month, which makes the plastic-bodied, Saturn-like car as expensive
as some Cadillacs. Roughly 300 have been leased.
<p>
   Toyota has just begun selling in Japan the Prius, a
hybrid-engine small car that runs on gasoline and electricity and
gets 70 miles to the gallon. Toyota is charging $17,000, but
industry experts say that the automaker is only covering half its
costs at that price.
<p>
   But Pearce insisted that GM was looking for real improvements in
mileage, and not just trying to influence its overall averages.
<p>
   Ford and Chrysler have both announced plans to build light
trucks that can burn either gasoline or ethanol, a type of alcohol
made from corn. This will allow these automakers to take advantage
of generous fuel-economy credits even if none of the buyers ever
uses ethanol because there are fewer than 100 ethanol filling
stations in the United States.
<p>
   Pearce said that the fertilizers, tractors and other resources
needed to produce ethanol actually consumed more oil than the
process of simply putting gasoline into fuel tanks. So he
questioned whether the use of ethanol really benefited the
environment.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The first guy I ran into at Sally Quinn and Ben
Bradlee's New Year's Eve party was Bruce Babbitt.
<p>
   It might have been an awkward moment. I had taken a fairly hard
pop at our interior secretary that day for being at the center of
``Bribes From Tribes''  &MD;  the political fix that was put in at the
behest of President Clinton for some wealthy Indian tribes to keep
a gambling casino monopoly, in return for $230,000 to the
Democratic campaign.
<p>
   I expected the amiable Babbitt to stiffen, glare and force a
civil nod, to which I would have responded with an equally cool
``And I wish the same for the New Year to you, Mr. Secretary.''
<p>
   Instead, he greeted me cordially, pulled me over to a corner
where we could make ourselves heard over the revelers' din, and
told me I had it all wrong. He was writing a letter to The Times
(published Sunday) disputing my conclusions of culpability. I
replied that this specific charge  &MD;  of purchasing of a government
decision  &MD;  could be resolved only by an independent counsel.
<p>
   As we were talking and snatching Sally's delicious hors
d'oeuvres from passing trays, Lloyd Cutler, a former Clinton White
House counsel and a longtime friend, came by to make sure we
weren't savaging each other. He agreed with Babbitt and hoped for
my ultimate redemption.
<p>
   A few minutes later, Bob Bennett, the president's counsel in the
Paula Jones case, came over, listened for a moment to the civil
tenor of our encounter, shook his head and said, ``Only in
Washington.''
<p>
   Next day, the chief White House spinmeister, Lanny Davis, called
me to take issue with five points in my Babbitt column. Because he
has announced his return to private practice next month, we met for
a leisurely lunch and argument.
<p>
   Lanny recalled that a column of mine a year ago about Hillary
Clinton's problems with truth had so incensed him that he
volunteered to become the designated defender in all the Clinton
scandals. (A flattering anecdote, but he was the Yale Law chum of
Hillary's chosen in 1993 to vet Janet Reno for her job as attorney
general.)
<p>
   I gave him a New York Times calendar for 1998, which he may hide
for now. As an advocate doing his job, Davis cheerfully views the
most tawdry betrayal of the public trust as ``totally appropriate''
and puts the best face on what I suspect he suspects may sometimes
be grievous wrongdoing.
<p>
   What's going on here? What's with this fraternization with the
media enemy on their part, this seeming understanding of government
stonewalling on my part? Is this mutual muting of outrage evidence
that we're publicly professing to be fierce gladiators but
privately playing as professionals in some political Super Bowl?
<p>
   On the contrary; we are not ``players'' in a drama or a sport.
We are participants in a protracted struggle to get at the truth
about what some reporters see as a power-abusive conspiracy to
violate the election laws, or what some officials call protection
of the presumption of innocence and the efficacy of the presidency.
<p>
   It serves our serious, opposing interests to remain engaged and
aware of what the other is doing. The journalist risks being
influenced or misled; the politician or spokesman risks letting
something slip. There is no denying the joy of the jousting, but
there is no softness in the civility.
<p>
   I get no kick out of the prospect of Bruce Babbitt, a public
servant who made big mistakes under political pressure from the
White House, being indicted on the testimony of the friend and
lobbyist to whom he may have revealed too much. But investigators
in Congress and some of us in the press see this ``covered person''
 &MD;  a member of the Cabinet  &MD;  as being a potential link in a chain of
corruption and therefore a ticket to the truth.
<p>
   Certainly an independent counsel working within grand jury
secrecy would be fairest to Babbitt. He is now twisting in the the
wind of legitimate public suspicion and can never be credibly
exonerated by his fellow Cabinet member at Justice.
<p>
   That is why I was able to wish the secretary both a special
prosecutor in his case and, in all sincerity, a Happy New Year.

 &UR; COMMENTARY: THE NOBLE EXPERIMENT &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  Practicality has been a feature of American life from
the start, and a reason for the country's success. Americans on the
whole eschewed ideology. We judged ideas by whether they worked.
When they didn't, we tried something else.
<p>
   A strange contemporary exception to that tradition is the war on
drugs. By any rational test it is an overwhelming failure. Yet our
leading politicians persist in calling for ever more stringent
measures to enforce the policy of total prohibition, doing their
best to prevent even a discussion of alternatives.
<p>
   In 1980, the federal government and the states spent perhaps $4
billion on drug control; today the figure is at least $32 billion.
The number of people in prison on drug charges has also multiplied
by eight: from 50,000 to 400,000.
<p>
   Yet the use of forbidden drugs remains a reality of American
life. Supplies are plentiful despite costly attempts to stop the
production of drugs in other countries.
<p>
   The human cost of the drug war is worse than the financial cost.
In 1996, for example, 545,000 Americans were arrested for
possession of marijuana, giving these mostly young people a
criminal record for use of a drug as accepted in much of their
culture as alcohol in ours. Thousands  &MD;  many thousands  &MD;  of people
are serving long terms in prison for a first, nonviolent drug
offense.
<p>
   But is there an alternative way of dealing with the grave human
and social problem of drug abuse? Yes, there is. It is explored in
the new issue of Foreign Affairs, in an illuminating article by
Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center in New York, a
drug policy research institute.
<p>
   The alternative is to acknowledge what Americans came to
understand about alcohol after 14 years of the noble experiment,
Prohibition. That is, as Nadelmann puts it, ``that drugs are here
to stay, and that we have no choice but to learn how to live with
them so that they cause the least possible harm.''
<p>
   The harm-reduction approach to drugs is in growing use
throughout Europe. That includes a country as bourgeois and
conservative as Switzerland.
<p>
   In 1974 Switzerland began an experiment allowing doctors to
prescribe heroin, morphine or injectable methadone for 1,000
hardened heroin addicts. The results, reported last July, showed
that criminal offenses by the group dropped 60 percent, illegal
heroin and cocaine use fell dramatically, health was greatly
improved, and stable employment rose.
<p>
   Swiss voters overwhelmingly support the policy. In a national
referendum in September, 71 percent of voters voted for it.
<p>
   Another policy adopted in much of Western Europe, Australia and
Canada is to allow exchange of used needles for clean ones. This
has had an important effect in reducing HIV infections. In the
United States, despite proposals for needle exchange by commissions
starting under President Bush, the White House and Congress have
blocked the use of drug-abuse funds for that purpose. The result,
Nadelmann says, has been the infection of up to 10,000 people with
HIV.
<p>
   Similarly with marijuana, the practice in much of Western Europe
is not to prosecute for mere possession. In the United States, a
commission appointed by President Nixon proposed in 1972 that
possession of up to one ounce of marijuana be decriminalized. The
proposal got nowhere, and White House intransigence is unchanged.
After Californians voted to allow medical use, the White House drug
czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, hurried to warn that federal law still
made it a crime for doctors to prescribe it.
<p>
   ``Most proponents of harm reduction do not favor legalization,''
Nadelmann writes. But ``they recognize that prohibition has failed
to curtail drug abuse, that it is responsible for much of the
crime, corruption, disease and death associated with drugs and that
its costs mount every year.''
<p>
   A good many Americans, including police chiefs and doctors,
believe that it is time for a change in our failed drug policy. It
is our political leaders who are afraid to change. It will take
someone with the courage to say that the emperor has no clothes  &MD; 
someone like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.  &MD;  to end our second,
disastrous noble experiment.

 &UR; ENTERING ELECTION YEAR, PATAKI CONFOUNDS HIS CRITICS &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  When George Pataki took office as governor three
years ago this week, his Democratic foes derided him as a puppet of
Republican kingmakers, an empty suit whose victory was a fluke, a
programmed politician with no vision and no hope of winning a
second term. A budget crisis here, a minor scandal there and he
would be history, they said.
<p>
   But the budget crises and minor scandals have come and gone.
Now, as he prepares to open the state legislature this week with a
speech that will set the tone for his re-election campaign, Pataki
is poised to make the Democrats eat their words.
<p>
   Polls show he holds nearly double-digit leads over all
Democratic challengers and commands approval ratings approaching 60
percent, up from the mid-30s in 1995. He has $10 million in his
campaign coffers, nearly five times that of the closest Democrat.
The state is expected to end its fiscal year more than $1 billion
in the black, its third surplus in three years. He has fulfilled
his spare 1994 campaign pledges to cut taxes, cut spending and
re-enact the death penalty.
<p>
   To Democrats, Pataki's strength results from things largely
beyond his control. A thriving economy, an irrepressible bull
market, a nationwide drop in crime and a rudderless, destitute
state Democratic Party have made it easy for him to coast into a
campaign year looking like a winner, they say. But they insist that
a recession or a sudden uptick in unemployment will cause his poll
numbers to drop like a stone.
<p>
   But even his detractors have grudgingly come to admit that
Pataki's governing style has been a factor in his success. By
picking his battles judiciously, focusing on a few issues and
fighting doggedly once he commits himself to a cause, he has
controlled the Albany agenda, converted critics into allies and
managed to win most of the battles he needed to win, while escaping
unscathed from several he seemed likely to lose.
<p>
   In a recent interview, Pataki talked at length about the
importance of being focused, describing it as almost a guiding
philosophy. He admired Ronald Reagan, he said, for being able to
keep his agenda simple, clear and short.
<p>
   ``The strongest force in government is inertia,'' the governor
said. ``You have to have a focused agenda if you are going to
change things, because there are enormous forces that resist any
change.''
<p>
   Sounding a theme that Republican officials say he will use again
on the campaign stump, Pataki said that by sticking to a few
issues, he had been able to fulfill his commitments to voters. As a
result, he said, the public has come to respect him, and not view
him as a typical politician with its negative connotations of empty
promises.
<p>
   ``I think the overriding thing is that they understand that I
mean what I say,'' he said. ``And I think there is respect. Too
often there is this enormous cynicism about politics and
politicians. And I don't think it's hard to trace the origin of
that cynicism. When a President Bush says, `Read my lips, no new
taxes,' then the next year passes a tax increase, people say, `My
goodness.'''
<p>
   Pataki's governing style has been the source of much debate
around the Capitol because, on the surface, he can seem so detached
as to be not in full control of his own administration.
<p>
   But Pataki's friends and advisers say there is a method to his
laid-back ways. Though Pataki calls Theodore Roosevelt his
political hero, he clearly lacks Roosevelt's impetuous nature,
panache and bluster. Rather, Pataki has turned to biographies of
Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt for guidance, admiring
the two presidents' abilities to rise coolly above the personal
rivalries and philosophical clashes of their advisers and make
difficult decisions.
<p>
   Once he makes those decisions, he does not waver, his advisers
said. ``When he focuses, he's a tiger,'' one friend said. That was
the case in 1996, when Pataki held up the budget for weeks until
Democrats accepted his plan for reducing workers' compensation
rates. The fight was too arcane for most voters to pay much
attention. But it won Pataki praise from business groups and the
admiration of his enemies.
<p>
   ``Pataki is stubborn,'' one Democratic lobbyist said. ``Cuomo
would give up at the end. But with Pataki, we'd still be
negotiating the budget if he hadn't gotten what he wanted on
workers' comp.''
<p>
   In an interview last year, Michael Finnegan, Pataki's friend and
former counsel, also compared the governor with his predecessor,
Mario Cuomo. ``Cuomo knew the details of everything, but he never
got anything done. He was too immersed in the Albany politics, the
details of what Line 27 of a bill would provide, as opposed to
setting direction.'' Pataki's style, he said, is to give sweeping
orders: ``I want hospitals deregulated. I don't want window
dressing. Go get it.''
<p>
   Pataki's critics say the downside of his style is that he seems
to have a cramped vision of government and few ideas outside his
narrow agenda. They also say he is so disciplined at sticking to a
few messages that he can appear programmed, inarticulate,
secretive.

<p>
   Pataki says he believes that he projects a different self-image
to the public than the one his critics see. ``My nature is to let
everybody know what I am thinking, including all the bad ideas,''
he said. ``You can't govern without bad ideas, because no one has
nothing but good ideas. But what is most common is that you don't
have any ideas. I always have what I would call creative, others
might call bizarre, ideas as to how we can move forward as a
state.''
<p>
   He added that his advisers ``are always trying to rein me in.''
<p>
   One advantage to appearing detached is that Pataki has not
always been held responsible for contentious or unpopular
decisions. For instance, Pataki deflected criticism about the
secrecy of private corporations that raised $2.5 million to finance
his inauguration by saying that he did not control them, even
though they were run by people who were either his advisers or
employees.
<p>
   The governor also managed to escape much political damage from
last year's grueling fight over New York City rent regulations by
allowing his fellow Republican, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority
leader, to take the lead in pushing for the elimination of rent
protections. Although Pataki had supported Bruno's position in the
past, he refused to take a position last year until late in the
fight, and then accepted a compromise with the Democrats that kept
the regulations largely intact.
<p>
   Though Democrats had predicted that the rent fight would
permanently damage Pataki with New York City voters, recent polls
have shown him to be more popular in the city than ever before.
<p>
   His allies say Pataki's handling of the rent fight shows one of
his strengths: strong political instincts that tell him when to
fight and when to retreat, what can be done and what is
unachievable, what will improve his image and what will make him
look foolish.
<p>
   ``He is very cautious and fears making mistakes,'' an adviser
said. ``But on the other hand, he just wouldn't ever sing `Old
McDonald' on the floor of the legislature,'' as Pataki's patron,
Alfonse D'Amato, once did on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
<p>
   It is perhaps those same instincts that have helped Pataki
silence some of his sharpest critics and broaden his appeal beyond
his conservative base during the last two years.
<p>
   Labor unions and environmentalists who had been adversaries
became allies when he won passage of a $1.75 billion environmental
bond act in 1996. His plan to reduce property taxes, which the
legislature enacted last year, will heavily benefit the elderly and
suburban swing voters. His plan to offer unlimited monthly passes
to New York City transit riders has made many urban commuters
forget that he presided over the largest increase in the transit
fare in 1995.
<p>
   Pataki clearly relishes holding the high ground for the first
time in his often rocky first term. At a recent fund-raiser in
Albany, he joked to the partisan crowd, ``Any time I saw a crowd
this size in 1995 or 1996, I knew it was protesters.''
<p>
   But the governor bristles whenever it is suggested that there
might be political motivations lurking behind his decisions. ``If
there is one thing I hope people have developed, it is a sense that
I truly try to do my best and try to say what I believe and try to
achieve the goals that we set out,'' he said. ``Not because of a
political campaign, but because of an honest belief that it is the
right thing for the people.''

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Forty-niners coach Steve Mariucci spent most of
Sunday morning watching film of his team's spectacular victory over
Minnesota on Saturday. It was rated G  &MD;  for great. By smacking
around a solid Minnesota team, 38-22, San Francisco proved that it
is more than capable of stepping up its game.
<p>
   Later in the day, Mariucci, who is already showing that he is
one of the bright young coaches in the league, switched gears to a
team he knows well  &MD;  the Green Bay Packers. As the 49ers filed into
meetings and the training room after watching the Packers' 21-7
victory over Tampa Bay in the second National Football Conference
division playoff game, they began to think ahead.
<p>
   ``Stopping the running game is important, very important, when
you play the Packers,'' San Francisco defensive lineman Chris
Doleman said. ``But let's not fool ourselves. Brett Favre is the
key to that offense and I think Steve knows a lot about him and can
help the defense.''
<p>
   It will be Green Bay against the 49ers at 3Com Park on Sunday
for the right to represent the National Football Conference in the
Super Bowl on Jan. 25. But in a way, it is almost a family reunion,
minus the hugs.
<p>
   And not just for Mariucci, who was quarterbacks coach in Green
Bay for four years. Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren was an offensive
coordinator with the 49ers. The Packers' offensive coordinator,
Sherman Lewis, who is a head coach candidate for several teams,
also coached with the 49ers.
<p>
   Mariucci will try to minimize it publicly, saying he coached
Favre so long ago, but there is no question his past association
with the Green Bay quarterback will help the 49ers' defense. He
knows all of Favre's ticks, his strengths and weaknesses, even if
the two have not been together since the 1995 season. And the good
coaches, like Mariucci, study and look for every possible
advantage.
<p>
   A good example of that is how Holmgren, while preparing for the
Tampa Bay game last week, took a certain pass play out of his
playbook. Years ago, Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, then the
defensive coordinator for Minnesota, made a great defensive call to
thwart that specific play (it ended in an interception). Holmgren
remembered that game, and Dungy's call, and decided not to use the
play again just in case Dungy was expecting it. That's how much the
good ones pay attention to detail.
<p>
   So imagine what Mariucci can pass on to his defensive staff and
players about Favre. Holmgren knows this, and will try to
anticipate the ways the 49ers may try to take advantage of
Mariucci's knowledge. And so the chess game begins.
<p>
   Still, no matter what Mariucci knows about Favre, stopping the
Pro Bowl quarterback is something not many teams have been able to
do. Even though, statistically, this was not even Favre's best
season, he is playing on a level few quarterbacks in the 1990s have
been able to match, although one of the others is San Francisco's
Steve Young.
<p>
   The 49ers believe their top-ranked defense can slow Favre down.
They feel that when Favre starts to scramble to buy himself time to
make plays, their speedy defensive linemen can catch him and their
secondary can pick him off.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   ``We have a lot of guys who can make plays,'' 49ers linebacker
Gary Plummer said.
<p>
   Some of those playmakers might be hobbled, however. The biggest
concern is cornerback Rod Woodson, who strained his left calf
against Minnesota. He was already playing with an ailing right
calf. Woodson looked fine as he walked around the locker room
Saturday night, but he is listed as questionable for Sunday's game.
Safety Merton Hanks has a right knee sprain and is listed as
probable.
<p>
   ``My knees are fine,'' Hanks said. ``No chance I miss this
game.''
<p>
   And no chance that Hanks and his defensive teammates won't be
picking the brain of their head coach this week before they try to
stop one of the best quarterbacks of this decade.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  To the Federal Aviation Administration, the problem
seems almost insurmountable: Every year, a dozen or so airplanes
hit turbulence so severe that the cabins of big jets suddenly
resemble roller coasters. Passengers and flight attendants suffer
broken bones, concussions and, once in a while, as on a United
Airlines flight from Tokyo on Dec. 28, death.
<p>
   Two tiny companies, though, say they think they have solutions
for detecting these invisible potholes in the sky, using remote
sensing technologies that sound like something out of ``Star
Trek.''
<p>
   Both technologies in fact began in the Pentagon as new and
better ways to kill people, in this case by using lasers for
detecting rapid movements in air, which can help detect enemy ships
and planes and improve the accuracy of bombs. With help from the
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, both systems will be tested beginning early
this year.
<p>
   Turbulence associated with thunderstorms is easy to spot, but
the main technique for detecting clear air turbulence, the kind
that hit the United flight, has always been to fly right into it.
Eager to reduce the casualty toll, the pilots turn on the seat-belt
light at the first sign of a bump, or the first report from another
airplane, but they do this so often that passengers disregard the
warnings, and most injuries come when the seat-belt light is
already on.
<p>
   ``For years, the No. 1 causal factor for injuries to passengers
on commercial airlines has been clear air turbulence,'' said
Clifford Hay, a program manager at the FAA in charge of one of the
new research efforts, which uses lasers as a giant ear to listen
for sounds of turbulence. It will get a first test at Kennedy
International Airport in New York this month or next.
<p>
   A more advanced laser effort will be tested aloft in April. It
is from Coherent Technologies of Boulder, Colo. After 14 years of
research, financed in part by $30 million from the Pentagon,
Coherent Technologies has a new kind of detector that it believes
will sense the movement of air miles ahead, providing time for a
pilot to take evasive action, or at least issue a more
authoritative warning to passengers and the cabin crew.
<p>
   ``The most conscientious pilot in the world, if he doesn't have
good information, can't do a very good job of controlling the
seat-belt light,'' said Rodney K. Bogue, a staff scientist at
NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, in Edwards, Calif.
<p>
   The center has sponsored some of Coherent Technologies' work and
plans to test the system in flight in April. A light that turned on
only when there was significant turbulence, Bogue said, would ``go
a long way to make believers out of people'' and would prompt
passengers to buckle up.
<p>
   The Coherent Technologies system is called LIDAR, for Light
Detection and Ranging. (``Radar'' stands for Radio Detection and
Ranging.) It sends out a laser beam 2 to 4 inches wide. A patented
electronic device switches a gate open and shut to create pulses 50
yards long, at a rate of 150 to 200 pulses a second. Air cannot
reflect laser signals, but tiny particles suspended in the air can,
and the system measures the reflected laser light.
<p>
   Detecting such tiny particles requires a very short wavelength.
For example, the FAA's radars operate at a wavelength of 2 meters,
or about 6 feet, and can see a solid object as small as 3 feet in
diameter; Doppler radar images shown on television weather reports
use radio signals with wavelengths in the millimeter range, one
one-thousandth as long. LIDAR uses infra-red, which is one
one-thousandth as long as that, or one one-millionth as long as FAA
radar wavelengths.
<p>
   NASA plans to install the system in a twin-engine turboprop for
several days of tests in April, measuring air movements in front of
the plane and then flying the plane into it, to see how the lidar
readings correlate with the bumps.
<p>
   The system uses low power levels, so the laser cannot blind
other pilots, but a major question is how far ahead the system can
see. Paul Reveley, marketing manager at the company, said
scientists believed it would be six to 10 miles. ``It should be
able to provide a pilot with somewhere in the neighborhood of 30
seconds of advance warning of some sort of turbulence event ahead,
and a direct measure of how severe it would be,'' he said.
<p>
   Like new electronic systems that warn of mountains ahead, this
one can be programmed to show hazards in distinctive colors or
sound an alarm.
<p>
   But by sensing air movements ahead, the system would also help
pilots identify nearby altitudes with better tail winds or less
head wind, the company believes, and in the intensely competitive
aviation industry, would be adopted as a fuel-saving measure.

<p>
   Much of the early work in the field was done for the Air Force,
which measures wind between a plane and the ground to allow more
accurate drops of paratroopers, parachuted cargo pallets, bombs and
artillery rounds fired from the air.
<p>
   Sewell Sleek, the chief operating officer, said Coherent
Technologies believed it could produce the system for $250,000 a
unit now, but that airlines with which the company had discussed
the system indicated that they wanted to pay only about $150,000,
which is more typical of other big electronic systems for planes.
<p>
   Sleek said that about 10,500 big jets in commercial service
around the world constitute the potential market. In addition, the
system could be used to spot the turbulence caused by big planes
landing. To keep planes out of the wakes of the planes ahead,
controllers now separate them by miles. If controllers knew where
the turbulence was, they could squeeze the planes closer together.
<p>
   Coherent Technologies is privately held but is considering an
initial public offering in 1998, Sleek said.
<p>
   A second approach, sponsored by the FAA and overseen by Hay, is
to use lasers to make a ``virtual microphone,'' to listen for the
sound of turbulence or airplane wakes. A regular microphone uses a
membrane that vibrates in response to sound waves; this one will
use a laser beam 100 yards long to detect passing sounds, by
measuring the sudden changes in air density. The laser beam travels
more slowly through denser air.
<p>
   Using several beams at different locations around the airport
and noting the time at which the sound arrives at each, a computer
can calculate the direction and distance to the source.
<p>
   The system, called Socrates, will be tested at Kennedy Airport.
The effort is led by a 6-month-old private company, Flight Safety
Technologies of New London, Conn., using methods perfected by the
Navy for submarine use.
<p>
   Samuel Kovnat, a physicist who is chairman and chief executive
of Flight Safety Technologies, said the experiments will develop a
``voiceprint'' for all the sounds the beam will hear, by listening
for different frequencies. An early goal is to distinguish the
sounds of jet engines, air rushing over the wings, airplane brakes
and turbulence in airplane wakes.
<p>
   Later, he said, engineers will listen for wind shear, a kind of
turbulence that at low altitudes has caused several plane crashes.
<p>
   If the ground-based system can be made to work, engineers plan a
flying version that would send lasers out to sense sound vibrations
a few hundred feet from the airplane. They would sense sound by
measuring particles in the air as they vibrated.
<p>
   Speaking of the Socrates system, Hays said, ``they've had some
good initial results on this, and they've got us very interested.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Madison Avenue has just experienced what may be the
busiest back-to-back years in its history as 1997 followed in the
frenzied footsteps of 1996. Again, accounts with billions of
dollars in billings shifted among agencies at a dizzying pace,
dozens of large creative and media assignments underwent
consolidation, high-profile executives switched jobs frequently and
big-agency companies acquired scores of smaller shops.
<p>
   Will 1998 make it three wild years in a row? Or is the frenetic
pace too intense to sustain? The preliminary outlook seems to be:
Keep those hatches battened down.
<p>
   ``Our El Nino is going to be here with us for a while,'' said
Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the American
Advertising Federation in Washington, which represents marketers,
agencies and media companies.
<p>
   ``We can expect more turbulence because so much of it is being
driven by consumers,'' he added. ``They're not as brand loyal as
they have been, they're more culturally diverse, they have more
options than ever before. So marketers are looking for more and
more ways to make the sale.''
<p>
   O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, agreed.
<p>
   ``As long as the stock market holds up, I don't think there will
be any change'' in the tumultuous tenor of the times, Drake said.
<p>
   Accounts will keep changing agencies ``as long as CEOs are being
held accountable virtually quarterly by the stock market,'' he
added, referring to top executives who must produce earnings gains
or watch their companies' share prices plummet.
<p>
   The rapid rate of acquisitions will also continue, Drake
predicted, because the huge publicly traded agency companies that
woo investors by projecting that earnings will increase by 20
percent annually ``can't do that just from internal growth; they
have to keep buying.''
<p>
   The ranks of those publicly traded agency companies are likely
to expand in 1998 as Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., privately held since its
founding, prepares for an initial public offering that may come in
the second quarter of the year. Trade publications have estimated
that the stock offering could value Y&AMP;R, the world's fifth-largest
agency company, at $2 billion.
<p>
   Lorna Tilbian, media analyst at Panmure Gordon in London, said
she expected additional initial offerings and acquisitions
involving agencies because ``in this economic cycle, a lot of
executives are in their 50s and they're looking to sell at the top
of the market.''
<p>
   ``In the next cycle,'' she added, ``they might be too old to
cash in their chips.''
<p>
   A potential stock offering by Young &AMP; Rubicam is not the only
factor encouraging privately held agencies to go public. Another
significant influence, said James Dougherty, who follows the
advertising industry for Prudential Securities in New York, is the
rich valuations the stock market has been placing on the shares of
publicly traded agencies like Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group
of Cos.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The executives who run privately held agencies, Dougherty added,
``have to look at stocks trading for 25 times earnings and ask,
`Can we afford not to be public?'''
<p>
   Drake of the agency association said that was particularly true
because the privately held agencies ``are increasingly at a
competitive disadvantage in competing for acquisitions and for
talent.''
<p>
   But then ``there's a real talent shortage'' at all agencies,
public and private, he added, with ``a lot of big jobs on the
street right now, some of them open for a long time.''
<p>
   ``Agencies are having a harder and harder time attracting bright
talent,'' Drake said, because of the appeal of higher-paying
careers like investment banking, and because programs to recruit
newcomers to the advertising industry were cut back during the last
recession.
<p>
   That lingering problem from the early 1990s is a reminder of how
rooted agencies are in the ups and downs of the economy. But over
the long term, that has its benefits, one analyst declares.
<p>
   ``The advertising business is an economic phenomenon that has a
fundamentally upward bias,'' said Alan Gottesman, managing director
of West End Communications/Consulting in New York, as more products
and services, ranging from computers and anti-baldness drugs to
cellular phones and tiny beanbag toys, are introduced to consumers.
<p>
   ``More comes into the system, which continues to escalate
inexorably,'' Gottesman said. ``And what goes out? Very little  &MD; 
W.T. Grant and Ipana.''
<p>
   ``There are also increasingly competitive situations in existing
categories such as automobiles, laundry detergents, home
entertainment and movies,'' he added, which all contribute to
rising advertising spending.
<p>
   Indeed, a leading agency prognosticator has revised upward his
prediction of American ad spending in the new year. Robert Coen,
senior vice president and forecasting director at McCann-Erickson
USA in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of
Interpublic, estimated last month that ad spending in 1998 would
total a record $198.4 billion.
<p>
   That compares with a forecast of $196.5 billion that he offered
in June. Coen's more recent estimate of 1998 ad spending would
represent an increase of 6.2 percent from the $186.8 billion that
he predicted was spent in 1997.
<p>
   Dougherty of Prudential Securities said that increase ``would
soak up a lot of the risk in Asia and Latin America,'' if the
economic turmoil in those regions resulted in disruptions like
cutbacks in ad spending.

   Singapore, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The Malaysian ringgit,
Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht plunged to record lows as slowing
economic growth kept investors away from Southeast Asia.
<p>
   ``The effects of 1997's turmoil is spilling over to 1998,'' said
Danny Kang, vice-president for regional currencies at Bank Brussels
Lambert. ``This is the worst crisis ever experienced by most of
these Southeast Asian currencies. It won't go away overnight.''
<p>
   The Malaysian ringgit plunged as much as 1.0 percent to 4.015 a
U.S. dollar, from Friday's Asian close of 3.975 a dollar. That's
the ringgit's lowest ever since it was floated in 1973. The
Indonesian rupiah tumbled as much as 5.6 percent to 6,300 a dollar
-- the lowest since the currency began trading in 1971. The Thai
baht fell as much as 3.2 percent to 49.85 a dollar.
<p>
   Interest rates across the region have soared in defense of
falling currencies. That's raised the cost of borrowing, eroded
corporate profits and slowed economic growth.
<p>
   After a decade of annual growth rates of about 8 percent,
countries in Southeast Asia are bracing for sharply lower growth
this year. Economists and analysts estimate Thailand and Indonesia
may even plunge into recession.
<p>
   The Singapore dollar fell as much as 0.4 percent to 1.7035 a
U.S. dollar, its seventh day of decline.

 &UR; `BRUTAL' LOSS IS FITTING END FOR ISLANDER ROAD TRIP &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   PHOENIX  &MD;  Six consecutive losses were tough enough, but the
seventh was, as Doug Houda said, ``brutal, brutal.'' The Islanders
are mired in their worst slump of the season, one whose misery
meter was racheted up another few notches during Saturday night's
2-1 loss here against the Coyotes.
<p>
   The Islanders played perhaps their best game in a fortnight,
certainly their best of the four-game road trip that concluded
here. They appeared headed to a 1-1 tie, but Phoenix's bruising
forward, Keith Tkachuk, crushed them by banging in a rebound with
just 13.6 seconds remaining in regulation.
<p>
   All that awaited the Islanders Sunday was a day off and a long
plane ride home. They face Pittsburgh on Tuesday at the Nassau
Coliseum.
<p>
   ``When you go 0-4 on a road trip, especially at a pivotal time
of the year, it makes the flight that much longer,'' said
defenseman Scott Lachance.
<p>
   Two weeks ago, the Islanders were a .500 club, at 15-15-5. Since
then, however, they have lost seven consecutive games to fall into
a tie for 11th place in the National Hockey League's 13-team
Eastern Conference. They also are suffering from a power outage.
The Islanders have scored just 10 goals in those seven games.
<p>
   ``We have to score goals,'' said a downcast Zigmund Palffy. ``We
played well, but for a couple of seconds we made a mistake, and we
paid for it.''
<p>
   ``It's always tough to lose like that,'' Palffy added. ``We're
hurting. You hope it doesn't happen again.''
<p>
   The winning goal came after a flurry of action in the Islanders'
end in the waning minutes of the game. The Islanders had battled
back to tie the game at 1-1 early in the third period, but  &MD; 
playing for the second consecutive night  &MD;  they appeared to tire in
the final minutes.
<p>
   With 20 seconds to go, Phoenix's Bob Corkum had the puck behind
the Islanders' goal. He walked out to the left of goalie Tommy Salo
as Tkachuk bulled his way into the slot, tying up Islanders
defenseman Kenny Jonsson. Corkum fired a clear backhand shot at
Salo, which was stopped, but Tkachuk smacked in the rebound.
<p>
   Islanders Coach Rick Bowness was livid at Referee Mick McGeough,
believing that Tkachuk had interfered with Jonsson while allowing
Corkum to get free from behind the net.
<p>
   ``If that's not an illegal pick, I don't know what is,'' Bowness
said. ``That was such a blatant call. It's pathetic.''
<p>
   Jonsson was diplomatic. Asked if a penalty should have been
called on Tkachuk, he said quietly: ``Obviously not. The ref didn't
call it.''
<p>
   Bowness called the loss ``a heartbreaker.''
<p>
   ``As the game went on, we kept getting better,'' Bowness added.
``We were all over them in the third period. To lose a game with 13
seconds left shows you how bad things are going.''
<p>
   There were some encouraging signs. For several extended portions
of the game, the Islanders controlled the flow of play.
<p>
   ``We did what we were successful with early in the season,
cycling down low, using our speed,'' Lachance said. ``We worked
hard enough to get a tie. The bounces just didn't go our way the
last 20 seconds.''
<p>
   Salo also was sharp. He stopped 21 shots, made several
spectacular saves  &MD;  including a point-blank stop of Jeremy Roenick
from the slot with four minutes remaining  &MD;  and gave up two goals
on which he could not be blamed. The Coyotes scored their first
goal when Corkum beat Salo on a two-on-one break while Phoenix was
shorthanded at 12 minutes 49 seconds of the second period.
<p>
   ``We played really good hockey,'' Salo said. ``We just can't get
a puck in. It's a tough loss.''
<p>
   Goal scoring has been one of the Islanders' biggest trouble
spots of late. Their lone goal Saturday was scored by Houda, a
journeyman defenseman who had not scored a goal since Dec. 26,
1996. He fired a 20-foot wrist shot between the pads of Phoenix
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin to tie the score at 1-1 at 3:15 of the
third period after receiving a cross-ice feed from Robert Reichel.
<p>
   Houda credited Reichel with doing the hard work, saying: ``I
tried to jump up into the play, and Ricks gave me a great pass. I
got lucky with the shot. I didn't even see where it went. Once I
got the pass, I just tried to put it on net.''
<p>
   Houda said that despite the growing losing streak, the Islanders
have held together emotionally. ``We've got to keep working hard,
and believe that, in time, that'll prevail,'' he said. ``We've got
to stay together.''
<p>
   SLAP SHOTS
<p>
   STEVEN GLUCKSTERN, the head of the Sports Ventures partnership
that is in the process of purchasing the Islanders from the current
owner, John Pickett, attended Saturday night's game. Asked if there
will be major changes when Sports Ventures takes control,
Gluckstern said, ``Over time, but not on the first day.'' He added:
``The franchise needs to be rejuvenated, like it was in the early
1980s. We're committed to making that happen.''

<p>
   ROSWELL, N.M.  &MD;  Ellen Robey waited this weekend for a salvage
truck to haul away the last of the dead calves piled on her ranch
30 miles south of here.
<p>
   To the north, the lane into the spread belonging to Melvin Key,
76, was finally open, after 11 days. His 69-year-old wife, Evelyn,
who had to be taken out by helicopter four days after Christmas for
an emergency operation on a hernia that was brought on by shoveling
snow, was recovering in a hospital.
<p>
   Life in this part of rural southeast New Mexico known nationally
for its alien sightings was slowly returning to normal after a
late-December snowstorm that left drifts of 6 to 10 feet.
<p>
   This calamity comes just as ranchers were bouncing back from the
drought of 1996 and the lower beef prices that followed.
<p>
   Warmer temperatures have begun melting the snow. But ranchers
said it could be weeks or even months before they know how many
cattle and sheep they lost to the storm. And the melting snow has
left mud 6 to 8 inches deep in its wake, creating new
transportation problems.
<p>
   Between 16 and 20 inches of snow fell in Roswell, the storm's
epicenter, between Dec. 20 and Dec. 25, the National Weather
Service in Albuquerque said. That was the most here in December in
decades, more than the 15.3 inches that fell in 1987 and the 13.9
inches reported in 1969, said John Graham, a weather-service
forecaster.
<p>
   High winds and temperatures that dropped to 6 degrees below zero
on Dec. 27  &MD;  a record for that date  &MD;  combined with the snow to
trap ranchers in their homes and livestock in snowdrifts, without
food for days.
<p>
   It was unusual weather for this area of New Mexico, where warm
daytime highs usually melt any snow in a couple of days.
<p>
   ``This is the worst snowstorm I've seen, and I've been here
since 1947,'' said Key, whose ranch is outside the small community
of Mesa, 50 miles north of Roswell.
<p>
   Despite rescue efforts, including the air-dropping of about 500
tons of hay to stranded animals, at least 5,800 cattle have died
and 2,500 sheep are thought to be dead, said Robert Redden, a
spokesman for the Emergency Management Operations of the New Mexico
Department of Public Safety.
<p>
   Gov. Gary Johnson has asked President Clinton to declare seven
counties a disaster area, opening the door for more federal
assistance.
<p>
   ``We've lost some sheep,'' said Billy Key, 46, Melvin's son and
part-owner of a ranch next to his father's. ``We found some dead
Friday. I'm sure there are some out there covered up with
snowdrifts and we won't find them until the snow melts.''
<p>
   Leo Larranaga, manager of Lobo Ranch near Encino, northwest of
Roswell, lost at least 70 head of beef cattle after snow piled up
over a fence, allowing the cows to cross onto railroad tracks,
where they were hit by trains. He, too, suspected that his losses
would rise.
<p>
   ``We haven't found a bunch of them,'' Larranaga said. ``There
are snowdrifts, and we don't know if there would be anything under
there.''
<p>
   Mrs. Robey and her husband, Rick, suffered what may turn out to
be the greatest individual loss. About 4,500 young dairy calves
died on their ranch after the weather worsened on Dec. 22. Most
were 4-month-old calves that piled together for warmth in outdoor
corrals during the storm, suffocating those on the bottom and
exposing those on the top to the cold and damp.
<p>
   Another 1,500 2- and 3-week-old calves died when the ranch's
electricity went off for 40 hours and the family could not pump
food to the hutches where the calves lay. Working by hand, Mrs.
Robey said, they could manage only one feeding a day for the 6,000
young calves  &MD;  not enough to keep all alive in the cold.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Such desperate conditions caught them totally by surprise, Mrs.
Robey said. They had moved to the area from Texas in 1995 thinking
it would be a warmer, dryer place to raise their fragile young
cattle, she said.
<p>
   On Saturday, as she stood in her yard looking at a pile of 100
dead calves a stone's throw from her kitchen door, waiting for the
truck that would haul them away to become fertilizer, she said, ``I
don't have any more tears left.'' Then she nodded toward corrals
filled with many of the ranch's remaining 9,500 live Holsteins.
``It's just a tragic thing. It's hard to believe that these looked
like those only a few days ago  &MD;  all big and healthy.''
<p>
   Mrs. Robey, like other ranchers here, said she had no insurance
to cover the loss, which she estimates at $700,000. Her husband was
talking with the farm's bankers and with ranchers they do business
with to work out loan arrangements to allow them to stay in
business. ``Bankruptcy would be the only option if we didn't have
help,'' she said.
<p>
   Congress could pass a measure to reimburse ranchers for part of
their loss, as it did to aid ranchers in other states hit by snows
in the fall, said Keith Kelly, administrator of the Farm Service
Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>
   His agency has already set aside $2 million to pay part of the
cost of hay brought in during the storm.
<p>
   Air National Guard units from Oklahoma and four other states
helped out by loading 2,000-pound hay bales onto giant transport
planes and dropping them over fields near cattle and sheep. That
operation ended on Saturday, with 465 tons of hay scattered since
Dec. 30.
<p>
   Ranchers like Melvin Key sounded optimistic that the worst was
over and that most of their herd had made it through.
<p>
   Lt. Bryan Dennis, who flies a helicopter for the New Mexico Army
National Guard, said he thought there was more troubling news to
come. Flying overhead, he said, he spotted cattle footprints
leading into snowdrifts, then disappearing.

 &UR; By Laura Cohn &LR;  &QC;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy should remain on
a ``non-inflationary'' track as the nearly seven-year-old expansion
continues at a ``moderate'' pace this year, Federal Reserve Vice
Chairman Alice Rivlin said.
<p>
   The economy is ``doing well'' and the expansion that will enter
its eighth year in April ``has been long and consistently
impressive, especially in terms of job creation,'' Rivlin said,
speaking at the American Economic Association's annual meeting.
<p>
   Helping to preserve that record, Rivlin said growth ``is highly
likely to slow to a more moderate rate in early 1998.'' Last year,
the economy may have expanded by as much as 3.5 percent, according
to Wall Street forecasts.
<p>
   Moreover, the recent economic turmoil in Asia should put
``downward pressure'' on U.S. import prices, helping to contain
inflation, she said, cutting U.S. gross domestic product by a half
percentage point.
<p>
   Rivlin didn't offer a specific forecast for U.S. growth in 1998.
And, she said, it's ``clearly too soon to tell'' what the precise
impact of an expected slowdown in Asia will be. She did say that
part of the reason why the U.S. economy's performing so well now is
that the Fed acted swiftly in 1994-95 to raise interest rates to
head off inflation.
<p>
   Rivlin sits on the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee, which sets interest-rate policy. Fed policymakers, who
meet next on Feb. 3-4, have left the overnight bank lending rate at
5.50 percent since raising it by a quarter point last March.
<p>
   Rivlin noted that the U.S. labor market continues to surprise
analysts and employers: ``It's hard to find skilled workers; it's
also hard to find unskilled workers,'' she said.
<p>
   Unemployment fell to a quarter-century low of 4.6 percent in
November as the economy added 404,000 jobs. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News expect that the Labor Department will report Friday
that the unemployment rate held steady in December, while companies
added 207,000 jobs last month.
<p>
   Ordinarily, job growth at last year's pace and such a low
unemployment rate would be expected to unsettle Fed policymakers
who remain wary that higher wages could lead to accelerating
inflation. Rivlin said, however, that wages may not rise quite as
rapidly as would be expected given the demand for labor and the
relatively constrained supply of workers.
<p>
   Unions have less power to demand higher wages, she said, and
competition is preventing companies from passing on what wage
increases they grant in higher prices for goods and services. In
addition, Rivlin said, a high level of worker insecurity limits
calls for higher wages, and companies are offering combinations of
benefits instead of just a bigger paycheck.
<p>
   Taken together, Rivlin said, these conditions make it appear
``the U.S. economy is less inflation-prone'' than in the past.
<p>
   Still, she cautioned, the Fed must remain watchful for signs of
inflationary pressures.
<p>
   Rising benefit costs -- like rising wages -- can be passed along
in higher prices, she said. And though cheaper Asian imports will
help contain inflation in the next year, she said, ``the dollar is
unlikely to go on rising forever,'' which means import prices will
someday rise.
<p>
   Recent economic reports have vindicated the Fed's steady
interest rate stance and support Rivlin's contention that growth
will slow while inflation remains tame.
<p>
   For example, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said its closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing cooled in
December as Asia's economic crisis depressed U.S. exports. Factory
orders and production also sagged from a month earlier.
<p>
   The NAPM's index declined to 52.5 last month -- the lowest
reading since January 1997 -- from 54.4 in November. A reading of
50 or more in the NAPM index means manufacturing is expanding,
while a reading below 50 signals a contraction. And in another
reassuring sign for the Fed, the NAPM prices paid index fell to
50.3 in December from 51.9 during November.
<p>
   That compares with the government's main price gauges, which
have shown all year that inflation remains in check. The consumer
price index rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first 11
months of 1997, well below the 3.3 percent gain recorded in the
first 11 months of the previous year. That leaves consumer price
inflation on track for the best performance since 1986.
<p>
   Price increases have been so tame that Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan even suggested yesterday that the next battle for U.S.
central bankers may be to combat the effects of falling prices.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider
at what point effective price stability has been reached,''
Greenspan told the same annual meeting of U.S. economists.
``Indeed, some observers have begun to question whether deflation
is now a possibility, and to assess the potential difficulties such
a development might pose for the economy.''
<p>
   Greenspan didn't say whether he agrees with analysts who say
deflation is coming, and he refrained as usual from any direct
mention of the Fed's interest-rate policy.
<p>
   The idea of deflation comes amid turmoil in Asia's economies,
which Fed officials expect will further slow U.S. growth. ``The
worst may be over, but we're clearly in for a period of much weaker
growth in Asia, which we expect will impact very heavily on the
United States,'' Rivlin said in a Zurich speech on Dec. 9.

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks fell, led by
materials makers and chemical manufacturers like Takeda Chemical
Industries Ltd., as investors worried their profits would be eroded
overseas by weak Asian currencies and battered at home by sluggish
consumer demand.
<p>
   The benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 162.04 points, or 1.06 percent, to
15,096.70. The broader Topix index declined 4.44 points, or 0.38
percent, to 1170.59.
<p>
   Investors continue to be concerned that Japanese materials
manufacturers can't compete with Asian makers whose currencies have
depreciated over the past year, giving their products a price edge.
<p>
   They're also worried about a stagnating domestic economy and
weak demand for products since April, when the national sales tax
was raised to 5 percent.
<p>
   ``Just because the year has changed, it doesn't mean the
situation has changed,'' said Susumu Inada, director of Tokio
Marine MC Asset Management Co.
<p>
   Takeda Chemical Industries, a maker of health products, fell 70
yen to 3,650. Nippon Kayaku Co., a chemical producer, sank 53 yen
to 501. Koyo Iron Works and Construction Co. declined 20 yen, or 22
percent, to 70. Mitsubishi Corp., a general trading company, fell
59 yen to 971.
<p>
   Carmakers also fell on investor concern that domestic profits
would continue to be weak.
<p>
   Toyota Motor Corp. fell 100 yen to 3,640. Nissan Motor Co. sank
13 yen to 527. Mazda Motor Corp. declined 10 yen to 300.
<p>
   The Japan Automobile Dealers Association will release figures on
new car sales in December at 2 p.m. local time. Sales have slid
eight straight months.
<p>
   Banks fell as investors feared that more companies will go under
following record bankruptcies last year, adding to the 28 trillion
yen ($219.7 billion) in bad loans the nation's lenders already
carry.
<p>
   Sumitomo Bank Ltd. fell 50 yen to 1,440. Sanwa Bank Ltd.
declined 30 yen to 1,290.
<p>
   Electronics exporters like Omron Corp. rose as investors bet a
weak yen versus the dollar would expand such companies' profits.
<p>
   ``The weak yen will be positive for exporters,'' said Shigeru
Murofushi, manager of the equity department at Dai-Ichi Securities
Co.
<p>
   The dollar rose to a five-and-a-half-year high of 132.32 yen in
New York trading on Friday, as traders worried that Japan isn't
moving swiftly enough to spur consumer spending or keep more of its
financial institutions from going bankrupt.
<p>
   The dollar recently bought 132.31 yen.
<p>
   A weak yen is good for Japan's exporters, since it makes their
products more competitive overseas and increases earnings when
dollar-denominated profits are brought back home.
<p>
   Sony Corp. rose 300 yen to 11,900. Omron Corp. gained 50 yen to
2,090. Tokyo Electron Ltd. rose 100 yen to 4,280.

   GREEN BAY, Wis.  &MD;  Yap. Yap. Yap. For much of Sunday afternoon,
that was the biggest game being played at Lambeau Field between the
Packers and the Buccaneers. But the Packers' 21-7 victory in the
National Football Conference divisional playoff game gave them the
final word.
<p>
   It was a chippy day. Packers defensive tackle Santana Dotson and
Bucs guard Frank Middleton went after each other, after Tampa Bay
missed a field goal attempt, because Dotson believed that Middleton
was trying to chop block him. Dotson was called for a personal foul
for taking Middleton's legs out from under him.
<p>
   Packers coach Mike Holmgren was not pleased with all the
yakking.
<p>
   ``In this game a lot of guys know each other, so you're going to
have a certain amount of jawing,'' Holmgren said. ``But too much
jawing can be a distraction, and our players need to know that.''
<p>
   None of the conversations were more animated than the ones
between Packers quarterback Brett Favre and Bucs defensive tackle
Warren Sapp. After one sack in the first quarter, Favre had to be
restrained by his teammates when he got up and went after Sapp.
<p>
   At another point, Sapp was heading off the field for a
much-needed rest when Favre yelled to him, ``That's right, Sapp, go
take a blow.'' Sapp waved off his replacement and stayed in the
game to continue to chase Favre around in the backfield.
<p>
   ``It was kind of friendly conversation, most of the time,''
Favre said. ``I think it's out of respect. He was telling me that
he was going to be chasing me down all day and I said, `OK.' What
could I say? He was back there all the time. He's a great player.''
<p>
   Sapp had a sensational day. He had seven tackles and three
sacks, forced two fumbles and recovered a fumble. He disrupted
Favre's rhythm.
<p>
   ``I love to play with him,'' Sapp said of Favre. ``I love to
play against him. Brett and I had a little conversation. I wished
him New Year's cheer.''

<p>
   PHOENIX  &MD;  An Ethiopian convicted of murder in Arizona has died
after a hunger strike that he called to protest his prison diet,
state officials said.
<p>
   The inmate, Teshome Abate, 38, died on Saturday at St. Mary's
Hospital in Tucson, said Mike Arra, a spokesman for the State
Department of Corrections.
<p>
   ``It was somewhat unexpected because on Thursday he had been
alert,'' Arra said.
<p>
   Abate was the first inmate in the state to starve himself to
death, Arra said.
<p>
   Abate had staged several hunger strikes during the year to
protest the prison system's refusal to feed him what he called an
Ethiopian Orthodox diet.
<p>
   Abate was hospitalized on Sept. 3 under a court order, and he
had agreed to take small amounts of food and liquids.
<p>
   But in the last month, prison officials said, Abate had ripped
out his feeding tubes, and his weight had fallen to 75 pounds from
149. Medical staff at the hospital had stopped trying to feed him,
said a corrections spokeswoman, Camilla Strongin.
<p>
   Ms. Strongin said Abate could not be force-fed, because a court
had decreed that he was mentally competent and capable of deciding
whether to accept medical care.
<p>
   The state spent about $90,000 on Abate's medical treatment.
<p>
   Abate, who was an illegal alien, had been serving a 20-year
sentence for second-degree murder at the state prison in Florence,
about 50 miles south of Phoenix, before being hospitalized.
<p>
   Truework Mesfin, pastor of the Ethiopian Christian Fellowship in
Los Angeles, said followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox faith abstain
from dairy products during the 40 days before Easter and the 30
days before the Ethiopian Christmas, which is celebrated on Jan. 7.
<p>
   During those times, Mesfin said, followers of the Orthodox faith
eat vegetables, fruits and meats, except pork.
<p>
   Ms. Strongin said that inmates could choose a regular, kosher or
vegetarian diet, but that Abate had said none met his requirements.
<p>
   ``He was always changing what he wanted to eat,'' Ms. Strongin
said. ``No diet we could come up with would satisfy him.''

   BOSTON  &MD;  Every day, mailboxes around the United States are
stuffed with catalogs. But in one catalog, the glossy photos and
appealing descriptions are not for sweaters or chocolate
assortments, but for homeless shelters, boys and girls clubs and
charter schools.
<p>
   The catalog for Philanthropy, created by a group of foundations
and trusts in Massachusetts in November, is an experiment in
charity marketing, an attempt to find out whether making donating
as easy as ordering duck boots from L.L. Bean will prompt New
Englanders to change their sometimes less-than-charitable ways.
<p>
   The mailing was timed for the rush of end-of-the-year charitable
giving across the country, and the catalog's founders are watching
closely to see whether the books, which list 100 lesser-known
charities across Massachusetts, attract bigger, better checks. The
first 200 responses brought in $136,550, the catalog organizers
said, an average of $682 per contribution. Those contributions were
divided among an average of more than three charities each.
<p>
   George McCully, the director of the project, calls the catalog
``the armchair approach to philanthropy.''
<p>
   ``You make a single phone call,'' he said. ``You send a single
check out. And no matter what your interests are, there has got to
be something in that catalog for you.''
<p>
   New England as a region has some of the highest income in the
nation, but gives the least. According to the Internal Revenue
Service, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire rank first,
third and fifth in the nation in gross income. But when it comes to
making charitable donations, Connecticut is 36th, Massachusetts
44th, and New Hampshire 49th, the IRS says.
<p>
   In 1995, the national average for contributions was $2,449 per
tax return, the IRS said. In New England, the average contributions
ranged from $1,564 in Rhode Island to $2,155 in Connecticut. ``It
could be our Yankee tight-fistedness and thrift,'' McCully said.
``Who knows? But we figured we could research it, or we could do
something about it.''
<p>
   So in what could be the first such concerted effort to get
people to give by presenting a cornucopia of possible
beneficiaries, the foundations distributed some 300,000 catalogs
through newspapers and direct mail. Most were sent to households
with incomes of more than $100,000.
<p>
   In keeping with its mail-order format, the 80-page catalog
offers different styles of giving, grouping charities under the
headings ``nature,'' ``culture'' and ``human services.'' The order
form has a space for write-in charities, so that if an organization
is not listed in the book, the catalog organizers will forward a
check to it. There is even a toll-free number for phone orders:
(800) 299-6744.
<p>
   More than 400 charities applied to be listed in the book, which
the catalog organizers whittled down to 100 small to midsize ones
``who would never in a million years be able to afford the kind of
exposure that a catalog would bring them,'' McCully said.
<p>
   It is too soon to tell whether the catalog has increased
donations. But already a Maine philanthropic group is planning to
send out its own catalog in 1998, and McCully said the Council on
Foundations in Washington was considering the catalog as a national
model.
<p>
   ``It seems ironic to me, and just right,'' said Peter Karoff,
president and founder of the Boston-based Philanthropic Initiative,
a nonprofit group that promotes charitable giving.
``Philanthropists have never figured out how to merchandise in the
same way that we merchandise soap and cars and VCRs. There needs to
be more borrowing from what has worked in the private sector and
applying it to philanthropic work. It's a sweet irony to me. It's
not a negative one.''

<p>
   The financially pressed South Korean government is attempting on
its own to secure as much as $35 billion in new financing,
according to American commercial and investment bankers.
<p>
   The move comes even as the Bank for International Settlements
released a report Sunday pointing out that global bankers had
stepped up lending to the country in early 1997 despite indications
of ``growing strains in Southeast Asia.''
<p>
   The South Korean government, which declined comment Sunday on
its refinancing plans, has repeatedly bridled at foreign advice
about how to get its financial affairs in order. By unexpectedly
moving to sell bonds on its own, the government would sidestep
American commercial banks' efforts to lead the repackaging of the
beleaguered country's mountain of troubled loans. Almost $40
billion in short-term South Korean debt will have to be
restructured by the end of March to ease the crisis.
<p>
   ``Once you open up someone's eyes to the possibility of
restructuring their debt, there's no reason for them to think they
can't do it themselves,'' one American banker said Sunday, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   Meanwhile, South Korea's ambassador for international financial
affairs, Inyong Chung, will be meeting with bankers Monday at the
New York headquarters of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. to discuss the
commercial banks' plan to convert South Korea's short-term loans
into longer-term bonds.
<p>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will also be in New York Monday
at the headquarters of the investment bank Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. for what the Treasury described as a review of Salomon's
child-care program. Salomon, along with Rubin's old firm, Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., is serving as a financial adviser to the South Korean
government.
<p>
   Rubin has regularly emphasized the economic and national
security issues at stake in Southeast Asia, and The kabuki-like
calm with which diplomats and financiers are attempting to bail out
South Korea belies the anxiety many still feel about the success of
the effort. When Congress reconvenes next month, the situation will
only grow more complicated.
<p>
   ``I think there's a certain spin on this in Washington that this
is under control,'' a senior commercial banker said last week,
adding that South Korea's financial problem was too complicated to
be resolved neatly or quickly.
<p>
   Some commercial banks, particularly smaller ones, have found it
difficult to agree on extending payments on South Korean loans and
even more so to arrange a complex pooling of the troubled loans as
long-term bonds. Further aid for South Korea from the International
Monetary Fund and others hinges on extending payment on the loans.
On Dec. 31, the South Korean government was forced to pay off about
10 percent of loans that came due, leaving only about $9 billion in
foreign currency reserves.
<p>
   The South Korean government said Sunday that it repaid $10
billion of its debt in December, using more than half of the
emergency money already provided by the IMF Commercial banks
deferred payment on only $3 billion to $4 billion worth of loans,
far less than the government had hoped.
<p>
   Now the South Koreans themselves are considering seeking $15
billion by the end of January  &MD;  part of it in the form of a $5
billion loan to replenish the coffers of its central bank and part
of it as $10 billion in new, longer-term bonds to replace some
short-term debt that must be repaid at the end of January. After
that, a second bond offering of $20 billion would be attempted to
replace a large portion of the remaining short-term debt, according
to American bankers.
<p>
   Raising that much money will not be easy. South Korea's credit
rating has been downgraded to ``junk'' status, meaning the
government will have to pay double-digit interest rates to attract
buyers for the bonds. But the South Korean government has at its
disposal Salomon and Goldman, Sachs, two of the world's biggest and
most able bond houses, and the country is considered too important
strategically and economically for anyone to consider letting it
suffocate under the weight of its debt.
<p>
   ``If Goldman and Solly are telling the South Koreans that they
don't need the commercial banks to do this deal for them, then I
would assume they can pull it off,'' said Nancy Kimelman, chief
economist for the Thomson Financial Services Co., a Boston advisory
firm. ``It's just another sign of the loss of importance of
traditional commercial banks to investment banks and the capital
markets.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Goldman, Sachs executives declined to comment and Salomon
officials could not be reached for comment. Jeffrey Shafer, the
vice chairman of Salomon Brothers International, and Robert
Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International,
traveled to Seoul Sunday to begin discussing financial options with
the South Korean government.
<p>
   In an interview on Friday, E. Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman, Sachs
partner and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, said he was acting as an independent adviser to the South
Korean government. Corrigan, who just returned from South Korea,
said that he got the job shortly before Christmas and that the
terms of his retainer forbid him from discussing his work with
colleagues at Goldman. But he said South Korea's immediate troubles
were a result of a shortage of money, rather than a lack of
creditworthiness.
<p>
   ``It's a difficult one, but I'm an eternal optimist on these
matters,'' Corrigan said. ``In all of these countries, there's a
big problem in the private sector. The financial system is in
difficult straits.''
<p>
   On Friday, American commercial bankers continued to discuss the
outlines of their loan repackaging proposal, which includes
initially swapping at least $7.5 billion in short-term loans for an
equal amount of longer-term bonds and raising at least another $7.5
billion in bonds that would replenish South Korea's foreign
exchange reserves.
<p>
   American commercial bankers increased their lending to South
Korea during the first half of the year, although less than their
European counterparts, according to the Bank for International
Settlements report.
<p>
   BIS noted that lending to South Korea by major international
banks rose by almost $5 billion from Dec. 31, 1996, to June 30,
1997, with Germany and France increasing their lending the most
sharply. Lending by American banks increased less during that
period, while lending by Japanese banks decreased.
<p>
   Of the $103.4 billion in outstanding loans to South Korea as of
June 30, the Japanese held $23.7 billion, down from $24.3 billion
at the end of 1996; Germany held $10.8 billion, up from $9.97
billion; France held $10.07 billion, up from $8.89 billion, and the
United States held $9.96 billion, up from $9.36 billion. Britain
held about $6 billion in June and Belgium held almost $4 billion.
Other countries each held well less than $2 billion of the June
total.
<p>
   Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp, BankAmerica Corp., and J.P.
Morgan are among the biggest American lenders to South Korea.
<p>
   Still, there are some signs that investors' nervousness about
the South Korean economy was diminishing. On Saturday, the first
day of trading after a weeklong holiday, South Korean stocks rose,
with the Korea Stock Exchange's leading index gaining about 2.4
percent. In early trading Monday, South Korean stocks advanced. The
principal index was up 1.87 percent to 392.69.

<p>
   GREEN BAY, Wis.  &MD;  When the Packers lost Edgar Bennett to
Achilles' tendon surgery before the season began, Dorsey Levens
suddenly was the reigning Super Bowl champions' workhorse running
back.
<p>
   ``But a lot of people didn't know if I could carry the load,''
Levens recalled, ``and I didn't know if I could carry the load.''
<p>
   He and all those people know now. During the season, Levens, a
fourth-year running back out of Georgia Tech, rushed for 1,435
yards, and in Sunday's 21-7 victory over Tampa Bay, he galloped for
112 more as the Packers advanced to the National Conference
championship game next Sunday against the 49ers in San Francisco.
<p>
   ``He looked like Walter Payton,'' Packers quarterback Brett
Favre said, referring to pro football's career rushing leader. ``He
does get strong as the game goes on. He wanted the ball more and
more.''
<p>
   And Favre wanted to get Levens the ball, especially after the
Buccaneers had narrowed the Packers' lead to 13-7 midway into the
third quarter. On third-and-6 at midfield, Favre tossed a swing
pass to Levens, who was surrounded by tacklers. But somehow he
burst away from those tacklers for 13 yards and a first down.
<p>
   ``I saw where the sticks were,'' Levens said, ``and I wanted to
get there.''
<p>
   He got there and beyond. And after Favre hit wide receiver
Derrick Mayes at the Bucs' 22-yard line, Levens ran for 15, 5 and
the final 2 yards for the clinching touchdown.
<p>
   On Levens' second-effort 13-yard reception, John Lynch, the Bucs
safety, had departed with a sprained knee.
<p>
   ``They had been keeping him in the box,'' Levens said, meaning
between the tackles. ``When he went down, we were able to run the
ball more effectively.''
<p>
   In pounding the Bucs in the second half for 88 yards on 17
carries (and 17 more yards on 2 receptions), Levens seemed to get
stronger even as he tired.
<p>
   ``I seem to run better when I'm tired, though I know that
doesn't make sense,'' Levens said. ``It slows me down, and I can
get my reads better.''
<p>
   With his 112 rushing yards, Levens set a Packer playoff record.
Actually, he set it twice. With a 3-yard smash midway into the
final quarter, he had 110 yards, surpassing Bennett's 108 against
the Atlanta Falcons two years ago. But when Levens lost 3 yards
moments later, his total reverted to 107.
<p>
   On the Packers' next series, Levens opened with a 5-yard gain,
then lost 2, then gained 2 more to finish with 112  &MD;  4 more than
Bennett's total, 7 more than the 105 by both Jim Taylor in the 1960
National Football League championship game in Philadelphia and Paul
Hornung in 1965 against Cleveland.
<p>
   Coincidentally, Bennett, on the sideline at Lambeau Field,
helped Levens break his record.
<p>
   ``I talked to Edgar all the time,'' Levens said. ``He'll tell me
about a hole I didn't see.''
<p>
   Two seasons ago, Bennett established himself as the Packers'
go-to running back with 1,067 yards. He had 899 during the 1996
season, while Levens, used primarily on plays when only one back
lined up, rushed for 566. In the NFC title game against Carolina a
year ago, Levens rushed for 88 yards and added 117 with 5
receptions.
<p>
   When Bennett was lost for this season, the Packers turned to the
6-foot-1-inch, 230-pound Levens, a native of Syracuse, N.Y., who
transferred to Georgia Tech after two years at Notre Dame.
<p>
   ``He's got a rare combination of size and speed,'' said Sherman
Lewis, the Packers' offensive coordinator. ``He's more elusive than
some of our other backs; he can make people miss. Plus, he's got
enough speed that he can outrun angles. When a defender is coming,
he can outrun him to the sideline. And he catches the ball well.''
<p>
   The Bucs' defense, remember, had limited Detroit's Barry
Sanders, who rushed for 2,053 yards during the season, to only 65
yards a week ago. But it couldn't stop Levens when it mattered.
<p>
   Now the 49ers must stop Levens. But in Favre, the Packers also
have pro football's best quarterback. Although sacked four times
yesterday, Favre completed 15 of 28 passes for 190 yards and 1
touchdown, a 3-yard dart to tight end Mark Chmura.
<p>
   The 49ers have arguably pro football's best defense. And the
49ers' rookie head coach, Steve Mariucci, knows the Packers,
especially Favre, from his time as the Packers' quarterbacks coach
before he left to be the head coach at the University of
California.
<p>
   Won't Mariucci know Favre's tendencies?
<p>
   ``I don't think anybody knows anything about me,'' the Packer
quarterback said with a smile. ``Including myself.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  It is hard enough to be Brian Leetch this season, but
it hurts more to be his partner on the New York Rangers' defense.
<p>
   Leetch's original mate, Jeff Beukeboom, broke his left ankle on
Dec. 16 and will probably not be back until late this month. Ulf
Samuelsson, who replaced Beukeboom on Leetch's right flank,
sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on
Saturday night in a 3-2 victory in Washington. Usually a quick
healer, Samuelsson might return in two weeks.
<p>
   With only six healthy defensemen, Coach Colin Campbell will have
limited options on Tuesday night against Carolina at Madison Square
Garden. Campbell may not have the luxury  &MD;  or the motivation  &MD;  to
bench Leetch again, as he did on Saturday after the Capitals took a
2-0 lead after 6 minutes 20 seconds.
<p>
   Although Leetch sat only 11 minutes, he might have rested more
had Samuelsson not been injured. In addition to sitting the captain
and winner of the Norris trophy as the best defenseman in the
National Hockey League last season, Campbell also replaced goalie
Mike Richter with the rookie Dan Cloutier after both Leetch and
Richter looked bad on both goals.
<p>
   His high-risk decisions publicly embarrassed two of Campbell's
most important and talented players. Had they backfired, the Blue
Shirts could have fallen seven games below .500 amid renewed cries
for a coaching change.
<p>
   But both changes worked out as the Rangers rallied with two
goals from Wayne Gretzky and one from Adam Graves. And while it may
be overstating a point, an optimist might say these decisions could
mark a positive change for the team and a significant moment in
Campbell's evolution as a coach.
<p>
   In his four seasons, Campbell has shown several obvious
tendencies. One is to verbally whip designated scapegoats, usually
players who do not speak English as a first language.
<p>
   Another is to overplay stars like Leetch and Richter, even when
fatigued or performing below their abilities. A third is to coddle
his favorites, including Leetch, creating a caste system and a
country club atmosphere on the league's highest-salaried team.
<p>
   Perhaps things began to change with the acrimonious departure of
Mark Messier to Vancouver as a free agent last summer after the
Rangers insulted him with a healthy pay cut. It has become clear
that Leetch and Richter, more than most, resented how the former
captain was cast aside.
<p>
   The anti-Messier smear campaign, led by Garden President Dave
Checketts, further wounded feelings and hardened attitudes, fueling
speculation that Richter will leave as a free agent next summer.
Leetch could do so the following year.
<p>
   When Messier ruled the dressing room, Campbell was hesitant to
irk him. Benching Messier pals ``Leetchie'' and ``Rickie'' would
have been difficult. But without Messier to glare at him, Campbell
could do what was overdue. His moves Saturday were justified by
Leetch's minus-22 in the plus-minus ratio and Richter's habit of
giving up early goals.
<p>
   Had the players been named Kovalev, Karpovtsev, Robitaille or
Nedved, Campbell might have harshly criticized them to the news
media. Regarding Richter and Leetch, he seemed almost apologetic.
<p>
   ``I'm not going to be judgmental,'' Campbell said of the goalie.
``I'm not looking at criticizing or taking any confidence away from
him.'' Regarding Leetch, the coach said: ``If we're going any
place, it's with Brian Leetch. It was just a way to get him back in
the game and hopefully get him turned around a bit.''
<p>
   Richter said diplomatic things, praising his replacement and
adding that winning was all that mattered. ``Cloutier made some
really good saves,'' Richter said. ``He's got a ton of poise.''
Leetch stayed composed but his eyes flashed, his body language was
tense and his sentences were clipped.
<p>
   ``My game's not going to change at all because of that,'' he
said, adding that ``the effort was no different'' after the
benching. Asked if he would have done the same thing in Campbell's
position, Leetch replied, ``I'm not in his position.''
<p>
   Imagine how he might react should Campbell strip him of the
captain's ``C'' that seems like a weight on his jersey. Given a
chance to choose again, Campbell might have given that red letter
to Gretzky, who acts and talks like the team leader.
<p>
   Approaching his 37th birthday, Gretzky sometimes plays with low
energy, as if the lights on his batteries are blinking red. These
stretches go for a period, a game, even weeks in his 20th season as
a professional.
<p>
   And then there are nights like Saturday, when he darts to the
puck like a predatory fish before whipping it into the net to claim
a game. Gretzky chose his words carefully when saying that Richter
is ``human'' and has ``played a lot of hockey'' and that ``all the
pressure on his shoulders'' has been ``unfair.''
<p>
   He added that both Richter and Leetch may have needed a ``mental
break'' and that reporters should not ``blow everything out of
proportion.''
<p>
   Curiously, when Messier left and everyone blew everything out of
proportion, Gretzky said little about the man thought to be his
close friend. When the Rangers played the Canucks, Messier
socialized with Leetch and Richter, not Gretzky.
<p>
   Perhaps Gretzky is simply being a professional who will not
wallow in hurt feelings or allow himself to pout about spilled
milk. Maybe some of his talented, younger teammates can learn from
his example.

<p>
   Months ago, Alaska posted a list of its 1,600 paroled sex
offenders on the World Wide Web. California provides information on
about 64,000 offenders on CD-ROM at any county sheriff's office or
big-city police department. And three months ago, Connecticut began
letting local police stations release the names, addresses and
pictures of paroled offenders to anyone who calls.
<p>
   But in New Jersey, the state that inspired the nationwide
movement for public warnings about the presence of sex offenders,
information is held far more tightly.
<p>
   Since New Jersey's community-notification law was hurriedly
enacted in 1994 amid the outcry that followed the killing of Megan
Kanka of Hamilton Township, it has faced an onslaught of
constitutional challenges, and nearly three years of review and
revision by federal and state judges.
<p>
   Indeed, the original ``Megan's Law'' is soon to emerge from
legal limbo as one of the most restricted in the United States,
with tight limits on which offenders are identified, who has access
to the information and how those facts may be passed on.
<p>
   By the end of this month, when most of New Jersey's 21 county
prosecutors are expected to begin issuing names and addresses of
offenders, only about 600 parolees will be listed, those classified
as posing a moderate or high risk of committing new sex crimes.
That total is about one-third of all classified offenders; the
two-thirds considered low risk are free from any notification
requirement.
<p>
   And, unlike other states, New Jersey will allow only a
relatively few people, those approved by state judges, to learn
about the moderate- and high-risk offenders.
<p>
   For offenders considered most dangerous, some neighbors will be
cleared by judges to get warnings, but others will not.
<p>
   For offenders deemed moderate risks, school superintendents and
principals, and maybe some security guards, will be alerted. But
they cannot legally pass that information on to schoolchildren or
their parents. Leaders of Scout troops and coaches of youth teams
can be told, but not the children they oversee. Operators of
women's shelters and day-care centers are legally entitled to
receive warnings, but not the women or children in their care.
<p>
   Also, those who are approved by judges to get the alerts risk
contempt-of-court citations if they pass the information to those
who are not.
<p>
   New Jersey's limited warnings are to start now that a long
federal court ban on them has lapsed and state judges are ready to
begin hearings that will define the scope of the notifications.
<p>
   Of the 47 states that have some type of notification law, nearly
all give information more freely than New Jersey. A recent analysis
by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in
Arlington, Va., suggests that only the laws in Michigan and
Virginia are as restrictive as New Jersey's.
<p>
   New York state's law provides for a directory, available at
local police stations, listing offenders considered to have the
highest risk of committing new sex crimes. It lists them
alphabetically by county. New York's law also creates a 900
telephone number at $5 a call, giving biographical material and ZIP
codes, but no home addresses, for moderate- and high-risk
offenders.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   But use of both the directory and the 900 number have been
blocked by a federal court at least until the U.S. Supreme Court
decides whether to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of New
York's law by the Legal Aid Society.
<p>
   New York's attorney general, Dennis Vacco, and Connecticut's
attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, favor putting the names of
offenders in their states on the Internet sometime in the future.
In New Jersey, that would be illegal.
<p>
   New Jersey's law sped through the Legislature in the fall of
1994, after the murder of Megan Kanka, 7, in July of that year by a
twice-convicted child molester who lived across the street. The
original law provided for townwide alerts about the most dangerous
offenders. Some were made in early 1995, and a few led to
harassment and vigilantism.
<p>
   That summer, the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of the law. But it ordered an end to the townwide
notifications and imposed the restrictions now taking effect. The
court's goal was to strike a balance between giving information to
some members of the public to protect themselves, and preserving
the privacy rights of offenders who had finished prison terms.
<p>
   The court permitted notifications only to those ``likely to
encounter'' a paroled sex offender, based on their nearness to the
offender's home or workplace or a place the offender frequented.
The ruling limited the notices about moderate-risk offenders to
school officials and the owners or operators of community
establishments that have custody of women and children or care for
them.
<p>
   For high-risk offenders, these establishments may get warnings,
as well as schoolchildren and their parents and immediate
neighbors.
<p>
   But these warnings now cover only about one third of New
Jersey's paroled offenders. Of the 1,939 that county prosecutors
have evaluated for potential risk, only 47, or 2.4 percent, are
classified as high risks and subject to the widest warnings.
Another 585, or 30.2 percent, are deemed moderate risks. The
remaining 1,307, or 67.4 percent, are low risks. Only
law-enforcement officials can receive information about them.
<p>
   New York state, on the other hand, has classified 71 percent of
its paroled offenders, or 4,738 of 6,637, as moderate or high risks
and subject to warnings to the public.
<p>
   On the eve of the alerts, New Jersey officials overseeing the
law say that during the two and a half years the law was tied up in
federal courts, the public has become confused and uncertain about
who is entitled to receive warnings and who is not.
<p>
   For instance, any community organization that supervises or
cares for children and women and wants to receive alerts has to
give its name to the local police. But some local police
departments say the state has not told them if they have to urge
these groups to sign up or if the groups know they have to do so on
their own.
<p>
   Detective Sgt. James Vieldhouse, head of the Youth Bureau in
Wayne, N.J., says real estate agents often call him asking if
released offenders live near homes their clients are considering
buying. He says he cannot tell them because the law does not
provide for notices to home buyers until they close on a house, and
then only in cases of high risks.

<p>
   ``That's very hard,'' Vieldhouse said. ``They want to know if
bad guys live on the street.''
<p>
   Some people have called prosecutors' offices with questions
about the allowable breadth of notifications and think countywide
alerts are permissible. The law never allowed that.
<p>
   Ike Gavzy, an assistant Bergen County prosecutor in charge of
its sex crimes unit, says that in his discussions about the law and
its limits, school officials are sometimes troubled by this
supposition: What about a superintendent or principal who is warned
about a moderate-risk offender living near the school, and does not
have approval to tell anyone else about him, and then a child in
the school is molested by the offender?
<p>
   ``It's a difficult one to answer,'' Gavzy said. ``We try to
explain we always have to be careful in today's society. We all
have to be vigilant all the time. There's no guarantee of safety.''
<p>
   Other law-enforcement officials warn that people who illegally
tell others about an offender's whereabouts face possible contempt
citations for violating a judge's orders on the scope of
notification. But the officials question how they can realistically
prevent people from spreading information, especially in schools.
<p>
   ``There's nothing to stop the cafeteria grapevine,'' one said.
And, he suggested, the state would probably create a political
storm if it prosecuted a mother for illegally telling another
mother about an offender's living in their neighborhood.
<p>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and New Jersey's attorney general, Peter
Verniero, have repeatedly warned that the state will vigorously
prosecute any vigilantism. But Verniero says he is confident New
Jersey residents will not violate judges' limits on notifications.
<p>
   ``I'm not willing to concede that the public won't follow the
law,'' he said. ``I think the public wants this law to work. I have
faith the public will abide by the rules. The quickest way to lose
the protections of Megan's Law is to abuse the law itself.''

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds rose in the first
trading of the new year on expectations Japanese stocks and the
economy will remain weak.
<p>
   While Japanese stocks rose before the New Year's break after
foreign financial institutions agreed to help ease South Korea's
credit crunch, traders and investors are still pessimistic about
the prospects for Asian economies.
<p>
   ``There's no silver lining for the economy,'' said Taisuke
Imada, money market dealer at Dai-Ichi Securities Co. ``There's no
other option except buying bonds.''
<p>
   The benchmark No. 182 government bond, maturing in September
2005, rose 168 yen per 50,000 in face value. Its yield fell 4.5
basis points to 1.610 percent.
<p>
   Bond futures for March delivery rose 0.55 from Tokyo's Dec. 30
close to 130.35.
<p>
   Financial markets in Japan reopened today for a half-day
session.
<p>
   ``Optimism at the end of the year over the Korean debt
rescheduling has subsided,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, a strategist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities Co. Dealers could be buying bonds in
anticipation of good demand at auctions this week, she said.
<p>
   Japan's governing party last year proposed a series of economic
measures, including a one-time 2 trillion yen ($15.15 billion)
personal income tax cut and the purchase of bank shares.
<p>
   Still, traders and investors expect such measures to fail to
inject life into the economy.
<p>
   ``There are no reasons to buy stocks,'' said Dai-Ichi
Securities' Imada.
<p>
   Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell almost 2 percent
to 14,956.84 on concern over the prospects for the Japanese
economy.
<p>
   The dollar's rise against the yen in the past several months
also reflects the poor economy in Japan and the strong U.S.
economy, and is unlikely to affect the bond market much in the
short term, traders said.
<p>
   The dollar was last trading at 132.38 yen, up from 132.32 in
late New York trading Friday.

 &UR; JAPANESE STOCKS FALL ON PROFIT CONCERNS, WEAK ECONOMY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks fell on the first
day of trading in 1998, sending the benchmark Nikkei 225 index
under 15,000 as investors remained pessimistic over the outlook for
the country's stagnating economy.
<p>
   ``Just because the year has changed, it doesn't mean the
situation has changed,'' said Susumu Inada, director of Tokio
Marine MC Asset Management Co.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 sank 301.90 points, or 1.98 percent, to
14,956.84. The broader Topix index fell 8.4 points, or 0.71
percent, to 1166.63.
<p>
   The decline was led by materials makers and chemical
manufacturers like Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., as investors
worried their profits would be battered at home by sluggish
consumer demand. Demand has been weak since the national sales tax
was raised to 5 percent last April.
<p>
   Investors are also concerned that Japanese materials
manufacturers can't compete with Asian makers whose currencies have
depreciated over the past year, giving their products a price edge
in overseas markets.
<p>
   Takeda Chemical Industries, a maker of health products, fell 110
yen to 3,610. Nippon Kayaku Co., a chemical producer, sank 49 yen
to 505. Koyo Iron Works and Construction Co. declined 20 yen, or 22
percent, to 70. Nihon Cement Co. tumbled 32 yen to 237. Mitsubishi
Corp., a general trading company, shed 70 yen to 960.
<p>
   Carmakers also sank on investor concern that domestic sales
would continue to fall.
<p>
   Toyota Motor Corp. fell 100 yen to 3,640. Nissan Motor Co.
retreated 15 yen to 525. Mazda Motor Corp. declined 10 yen to 300.
<p>
   The Japan Automobile Dealers Association will release figures on
new car sales in December at 2 p.m. local time. Sales have slid
eight straight months.
<p>
   Banks fell on investor fears that more companies will go under
following record bankruptcies last year, adding to the 28 trillion
yen ($219.7 billion) in bad loans the nation's lenders already
carry.
<p>
   Sumitomo Bank Ltd. fell 70 yen to 1,420. Sanwa Bank Ltd.
declined 50 yen to 1,270. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. fell
50 yen to 1,260.
<p>
   Electronics exporters like Omron Corp. rose as investors bet a
weak yen versus the dollar would expand such companies' profits.
<p>
   ``The weak yen will be positive for exporters,'' said Shigeru
Murofushi, manager of the equity department at Dai-Ichi Securities
Co. ``Although that alone isn't enough'' to pull the entire Nikkei
up.
<p>
   The dollar rose to a five-and-a-half-year high of 132.65 yen in
New York trading on Friday, as traders worried that Japan isn't
moving swiftly enough to spur consumer spending or keep more of its
financial institutions from going bankrupt.
<p>
   The dollar recently bought 132.31 yen.
<p>
   A weak yen is good for Japan's exporters, since it makes their
products more competitive overseas and increases earnings when
dollar-denominated profits are brought back home.
<p>
   Sony Corp. rose 200 yen to 11,800. Omron, a maker of automation
equipment, gained 50 yen to 2,090. Tokyo Electron Ltd. rose 110 yen
to 4,290.

<p>
   PURCHASE, N.Y.  &MD;  Allan Houston slipped out of his old skin as if
he were shrugging off an overcoat Saturday night.
<p>
   He left the cocoon of his jump shot, casting off his tendency to
hang out on the safety of the perimeter and launch a shot. Instead,
Houston gritted his teeth, surged past the Orlando Magic's Gerald
Wilkins and drove into the face of the 6-foot-11-inch Rony Seikaly
to finish off a driving layup with 31.8 seconds left. One bold
move, and he put a tight game away for the Knicks at Madison Square
Garden.
<p>
   And so, the serene jump-shooter made the leap to assertiveness.
He took a play designed for Larry Johnson that was broken down by
the Orlando defense, and improvised with authority to score.
<p>
   It is hard to tell what a moment like this will mean to a
player. At least now Houston can find out.
<p>
   Not to suggest that the Knicks would not love to have Patrick
Ewing on the floor, but if he were there, it is unlikely that
Houston would have had an opportunity like this. Before Ewing's
season-ending wrist injury, most game-winning situations revolved
around the All-Star center.
<p>
   ``That's all in the past,'' Houston said after the Knicks'
practice Sunday. ``You know?''
<p>
   Everyone knows. Ewing's departure means players like Houston
have to quit talking about injecting some aggression into their
games, and do it.
<p>
   ``I don't look at it as a breakthrough,'' Houston said. ``It's
only a breakthrough if you haven't done it before.''
<p>
   It is true that Houston has won games before. It is true that he
has dared to drive to the basket more this year, especially when
his surgically repaired right wrist has hampered his shooting
range. But Houston has seldom done both as emphatically as he did
against Orlando.
<p>
   It was quite a noise, like two cymbals crashing together, coming
from a player whose demeanor has been painted as passive and soft.
Is that perception or reality?
<p>
   ``There is something to the perceptions in that the guy has a
placid demeanor,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``And at
times, it has been true. It's not so much offensively, but
defensively.
<p>
   ``You look at his rebounding. Like last night, he went up over
traffic even though he was overmatched while playing at small
forward. It just proves he can be a rebounder. It just takes that
concentration to do that.''
<p>
   Houston, who had 4 rebounds and 15 points in 29 minutes against
the Magic, has to focus on his edge because it does not come
naturally. He has a loping and laid-back style; he is not one to
automatically get low and defend. But that is the aggressive
position he needs to take when fighting through screens to chase
shooters. He lost Orlando's Derek Harper a couple of times, just as
he has lost many others.
<p>
   ``At times, he has shown great improvement on defense,'' Van
Gundy said. ``Other times, he's had concentration lapses.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Inconsistency across the board has haunted the Knicks this year.
A steady Houston would help. But he is a long way from entering the
go-to realm of Ewing. Houston, who averaged 19.7 points a game with
Detroit two seasons ago, has a $56 million contract. But with the
Knicks, he has not proven that he is a top player capable of
scoring 20 points a night.
<p>
   ``I never concern myself with a number,'' Van Gundy said as he
mentally thumbed through Houston's statistics (14 points per game,
with a 41.8 shooting percentage). ``But I'd say if he's ever going
to approach getting in that range of 20 a night, his shooting
percentage has to go up and he's going to have to get to the
free-throw line more.''
<p>
   That means ducking inside, fearlessly. Houston has driven to the
basket many times, but has tended to flinch at the end.
<p>
   ``When he drives sometimes, he doesn't finish as well as he
needs to,'' Van Gundy said. ``The stronger he goes, the more calls
he'll get.''
<p>
   He timed his strength move perfectly against the Magic, slipping
out of his jump-shooter's shell on cue.
<p>
   ``It was a situation where you either make something happen or
you don't,'' Houston said. ``I love having the ball when the clock
is winding down. That forces you to make a play. It's a lot of fun,
actually.''
<p>
    &MD;  &MD; 
<p>
   REBOUNDS
<p>
    &MD;  Buck Williams bruised his left knee against the Magic on
Saturday night and may not be able to play against Washington on
Monday. Coach Jeff Van Gundy said he is not sure who will start at
center if Williams cannot. Although the Wizards have big bodies up
front, Van Gundy may go with Charles Oakley rather than Chris
Dudley. When the Knicks acquired Dudley, it was to back up Patrick
Ewing and provide insurance for injury. However, Dudley is not a
scorer. To get points, Van Gundy has often opted for a smaller
unit. ``I feel for Chris,'' Van Gundy said. ``Sometimes, a decision
is made on the flow of the game and our needs on offense, and it's
no reflection on him.''
<p>
    &MD;  The Wizards are the first in a gauntlet of talented teams the
Knicks will face on a home schedule that includes New Jersey,
Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta. ``We have to be as downright
competitive as we've ever been to give ourselves a chance to win,''
said Van Gundy, whose team is 3-2 without Ewing.
<p>
    &MD;  The Mitch Richmond-to-Miami trade rumors have resurfaced. ``I
thought he was here,'' said Van Gundy, making light of speculation
that Richmond was on his way to New York to be a Knick earlier in
the season.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Dr. Linda Cahill spends her days dealing with the
darkest part of people's hearts, the part that allows mothers to
batter their sons, fathers to molest their daughters, trusted
friends to beat their young charges.
<p>
   Other people may cringe when they see the litany of child-abuse
cases clogging the news reports, then return to their work. For Dr.
Cahill, medical director of the Child Protection Center at
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, those cases are her work.
And her only sanctuary from the horror is the belief that her work,
which includes education and prevention programs as well as
treating victims, keeps other children from being reduced to an
epitaph and a grainy snapshot of happier days.
<p>
   ``If I thought that the only thing I was doing was picking up
the pieces of abuse,'' she said, ``it would be very difficult to
get through the day.''
<p>
   As it is, there are no easy days. At a morning staff meeting
recently, Dr. Cahill and her colleagues reviewed the cases of six
children scheduled to be seen that day.
<p>
    &MD;  A preschool child whose mother feared that the girl's interest
in her genitals was a sign that she had been molested.
<p>
    &MD;  A disabled boy who said that he had been sexually assaulted by
an aide at school. ``I can't believe people,'' Dr. Cahill blurted
out as she filled the staff in on that case. She had been driving
home in Manhattan the day before when the boy's distraught mother
had reached her on her cellular phone. ``The idea that people who
are supposed to watch children  &MD;  disabled children  &MD;  could do
this,'' Dr. Cahill said.
<p>
   After the pause, the litany continued.
<p>
    &MD;  A 6-year-old girl neglected by her delusional mother.
<p>
    &MD;  A 9-year-old boy and his 6-year-old sister engaged in sexual
playacting in their foster home, behavior that is often a sign of
sexual abuse.
<p>
    &MD;  A teen-ager molested by her stepfather.
<p>
    &MD;  A boy with neurological problems abandoned by his mother in
the hospital.
<p>
   And by the end of the day, there would be another call, another
case, another child abused.
<p>
   The number of such cases, experts say, is on the rise in the
city and around the nation, with more children than ever enduring
abuse and neglect. In 1995, the last year for which complete
federal statistics are available, there were 2.9 million children
reported as abused or neglected. Of those, 1.1 million children
were confirmed as having been maltreated, with 565,000 suffering
serious injuries and 996 dying at the hands of their abusers.
<p>
   In New York state, authorities received 211,445 reports of
abused or neglected children in 1995. Of those, 57,699 cases were
substantiated, and 68 children died.
<p>
   Even those figures are deceptively low, experts say. Many
believe that 85 percent of abuse-related deaths are not reported,
are misidentified as accidental or disease-related or are
attributed to other erroneous causes.
<p>
   ``When you first get a case,'' said Dr. Cahill, ``it's like
being a medical detective, looking for physical evidence that will
help explain what has happened to the child.''
<p>
   Dr. Cahill, 55, came to Montefiore 20 years ago, leaving behind
a career in immunology and infectious-disease research because she
longed to deal with children directly.
<p>
   There is no detachment in her job, and all the thousands of
cases have not numbed her. Her years of experience do not stop her
from closing her eyes, shaking her head and bringing her hand to
her mouth in disbelief when she gets a new report.
<p>
   ``What happens out there to children defies the imagination,''
said Dr. Cahill, who is married and has a child. ``It's
staggering.''
<p>
   The realization lends a sense of urgency to her efforts and a
focus that goes beyond clinical treatment. ``Our ultimate goal is
to develop preventive strategies and to educate people who care for
children to be aware of the earliest signs of abuse,'' she said.
``We want to get in there before abuse happens, or before it's too
late.''

   The Child Protection Center is considered a national model for
dealing with victims of child abuse. The staff includes two
pediatricians, two certified pediatric nurse practitioners, five
social workers and two case managers. There is always a
representative from the city's Administration for Children's
Services on duty, and the police and prosecutors work with the
clinical team to protect children at risk of abuse and to prosecute
abusers.
<p>
   About 25 cases of suspected abuse or neglect are referred to the
center each week, more than half of which are substantiated, Dr.
Cahill said.
<p>
   One of the mainstays of the center is the Harriet Feinman Child
Protection Project, in which volunteers  &MD;  most of them elderly
people  &MD;  keep track of the children who have been through the
center, making sure that they receive the social services they
need, get to their appointments and go to school. More than 2,000
children are now receiving the follow-up care, out of more than
4,000 who have been treated at the center. Dr. Cahill said she
believes it is because of this service that no child has died at
the hands of an abuser after the center has intervened.
<p>
   ``These are not cases to us,'' Dr. Cahill said. ``These are
children.''
<p>
   The center is on a quiet side street near the main hospital, a
sunny warren of playrooms, examining rooms, doll houses and
pint-size tables loaded with crayons, paper and puzzles. A closet
holds donated toys and stuffed animals, which are distributed to
the children.
<p>
   But the cheerful surroundings belie the gruesome work that takes
place in the building. The examining rooms have camera-mounted
colposcopes, devices that allow doctors, in a noninvasive way, to
document evidence of sexual abuse. One of the examining rooms has a
video camera and a hidden observation area so that medical interns
and others can learn evidence-gathering and examination techniques
for abuse cases.
<p>
   Several rooms have one-way mirrors so detectives, prosecutors
and city caseworkers can observe together when children are
interviewed, sparing the children the trauma of being questioned
over and over.
<p>
   When she talks with children, Dr. Cahill is neither ebullient
nor chatty, and her calm manner and gentle voice seem to put
frightened children at ease. Sitting on the carpeted steps of an
interview room on a recent afternoon, she drew a shy young girl to
her by picking up doll-house furniture and wondering aloud where
the pieces ought to go. Soon, the girl was playing with the tables
and bathtubs. Later, she was talking about life in her broken home.
<p>
   ``When a child has to repeat these horrific details over and
over, they often just shut down emotionally,'' Dr. Cahill said.
``It is our job to protect them from their abusers and from a
system that historically has revictimized them.''
<p>
   The most hellish of abuse cases get a lot of belated publicity,
usually when all that is left is a corpse: Sabrina Green. Elisa
Izquierdo. Lisa Steinberg. Sometimes, Dr. Cahill said, those cases
have the paradoxical effect of having people minimize the extent of
the child-abuse epidemic. For example, she said, people may hear
about how 9-year-old Sabrina, whose sister is charged with
murdering her, lost a thumb because it was untreated for gangrene,
and think, ``Terrible things like that rarely happen.''
<p>
   ``And, in fact, they rarely do,'' Dr. Cahill said, ``but they
happen far more often than a civilized society should tolerate. And
what's more is that untold numbers of children are brutalized every
day, in big ways and small ways. A mother who doubts when her child
cries that her father is raping her; that disbelief adds abuse to
abuse. A child who is hit with an electrical wire for
who-knows-what offense. People don't want to know, but it's there
and it's a growing problem.''
<p>
   But the signs of abuse are not always obvious. An important part
of Dr. Cahill's work involves lectures to people who work with
children, or who are training to, on how to spot abuse and what to
do about it. New York state law requires people who work regularly
with children  &MD;  including teachers, social workers, librarians,
nurses, doctors and dentists  &MD;  to take a course outlining the
problem of child abuse, the signs and the proper responses.
<p>
   One recent day, Dr. Cahill spoke at the Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn to several-dozen students who are studying to be art
teachers. The room was hushed when she presented a slide show that
chronicled an array of abused children whose anguish never made the
newspapers or television reports.
<p>
   ``The horror of this kind of thing keeps us motivated to try to
find out what is going on,'' Dr. Cahill told the students.
<p>
   Dr. Cahill was gratified by the students' attentiveness and by
the quality of their questions. She said that their responses made
her feel she was making some progress. Six years ago, such a course
was not even required.
<p>
   ``Children are very resilient,'' Dr. Cahill said. ``If you can
remove them and give them hope, you can give them life.''

<p>
   It is not clear why Anatoly Karpov, with the minimal advantage
of the first move, did so little on Sunday in Game 3 of his
International Chess Federation World Championship Match against
Viswanathan Anand, the challenger. He varied from his play in Game
1, but in a tame way that quickly produced a draw on Sunday in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
<p>
   Karpov had won the first game with a brilliant attack, though
Anand didn't resign until Move 108, with mate coming in two moves.
Anand turned the tables with a Ruy Lopez in Game 2; Karpov gave up
at Move 42, with mate imminent.
<p>
   The contest now stands at Karpov 1{, Anand 1{. It takes 3{
points to win the six-game match and the $1.3 million, and perhaps
get a crack at Gary Kasparov, the world's highest-ranked player,
for an even bigger purse.
<p>
   One possible explanation for Karpov's lack of ambition in this
game is that he might have guessed that Anand might handle his
conservative play carelessly, so when his challenger handled the
defense flawlessly, he realized that he was stymied. Another
possibility is that after losing so dramatically to the wily Indian
grandmaster the day before, he wanted to take a second rest day in
addition to the off day on Monday.
<p>
   Although this sort of thing is sometimes done in a 20-game
series, it does not fit in with the requirements of a short contest
like this one. Especially since, in the three games remaining,
Anand has two turns with White to Karpov's one, and top match
players generally count on doing their winning then, rather than
try to counterpunch with Black.
<p>
   As in Game 1, the players chose to contest a Semi-Slav Variation
with 4 e3 e6. And once again, Anand got rid of his main center pawn
with 6 dc 7 Bc4 to prepare a counterattack with 7 ... b5 8 Bd3 Bb7.
But this time, Karpov diverged from the intense fighting that
results from 9 O-O a6 10 e4 c5 in favor of 9 a3, a quiet move which
does threaten to hem in the black queenside with 10 b4, but is
without any real force.
<p>
   Black just prevents the bind with 9 ... b4 before it can be set
up.
<p>
   In Moscow in 1992, Anand played 10 ... a5 against Karpov, and
maybe Karpov expected him to do it again and had readied something
for it. The game continued 11 O-O Be7 12 Nf6 Nf6 13 e4 O-O 14 Qc2
h6 15 ab Bb4 16 e5 Nd7 17 Bh7 Kh8 18 Be4 Qb8 with approximate
equality.
<p>
   In any case, Anand's 10 ... Ne4 11 Ne4 ba 12 ba Bd6 did not
yield Karpov any auspicious avenues of attack.
<p>
   Anand's 15 ... c5! was the most efficient way of anticipating a
white buildup in the center with an eventual e4. Karpov could not
exploit it by 16 Bh7? because after 16 ... Kh8, the threat of 17
... Bf3 18 gf Qh4 forces 17 Bd3. Then 17 ... Bf3 18 gf Bh2 19 Kh2
lets Black get a draw by perpetual check with 19 ... Qh4 20 Kg2
Qg5, and so forth.
<p>
   After 19 a4, the pawn formations were symmetrical, and neither
player could claim to have better-placed pieces. For such great
players to go further in such a situation would be to put energy
into something that had no promise of reward. So, Karpov and Anand
agreed to a draw.

HOLMES IS SURPRISE FOR NORTHRIDGE &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By MARC J. SPEARS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CHENEY, Wash.  &MD;  Carl Holmes came to Cal State Northridge as a
scrawny freshman who had something to prove.
<p>
   Now about five months later, the 170-pound nephew of Northridge
basketball coach Bobby Braswell is still in search of some pounds.
However, any questions about what the true freshman can bring to
the hardwood have ceased.
<p>
   After scoring just 10 points through through Northridge's first
five games, the 6-foot-1 guard has become one of the Matadors' top
offensive players and has surprisingly stepped up to fill the void
left by injured senior guard Derrick Higgins, who is out for the
season with a broken right foot. He is also one of the few sparks
for struggling Northridge (4-7, 0-1 Big Sky), which is desperately
searching for some leadership and a level of performance that
approaches its potential.
<p>
   In the last six games, Holmes has averaged 15.3 points, which is
second only to junior forward Jabari Simmons (15.5). He has also
been hot from beyond the arc, averaging two 3-pointers per game and
hitting 29 percent of his 3-point attempts, statistics that rank
among the best in the Big Sky Conference. He was also named the Big
Sky player of the week for the span of games played through Dec.
21, after scoring a combined 41 points during a breakthrough trip
to Ohio and Ohio State that took his game and confidence to another
level.
<p>
   Not bad for a slim youngster who didn't leave the bench in two
games earlier this season.
<p>
   Tonight against host Eastern Washington (6-5, 1-0) in Big Sky
action, Holmes and the Matadors will attempt to win their first
game on an opponent's homecourt in seven tries.
<p>
   ``When I first started playing, (the players) saw that I was
small, wasn't big and that I didn't weight but 200 pounds. I'm sure
they were saying, `What is this?' '' said Holmes, 19, who admits he
was a timid player at first. ``But once we started playing pickup
(games), they knew I could play.
<p>
   ``I believe things will continue to get better for the team and
myself. I just need to put on some weight so I don't get muscled in
the paint. Once I do that, I will be able to develop.''
<p>
   During his senior season, Holmes averaged 17.4 points per game,
was named first team all-state and led North Eugene (Ore.) High to
a third-place finish in the state playoffs. But with Braswell being
his uncle, many schools shied away from recruiting him because they
didn't think they could sign him. Holmes, who said he would have
considered other schools, was disappointed that he was recruited
seriously only by Air Force, Navy and North Texas, and his lone
official visit was to CSUN.
<p>
   Although adjusting to beginning on the bench and life away from
Oregon was tough, Holmes said he is much happier now.
<p>
   ``Carl's play has absolutely come at a good time,'' Braswell
said. ``All along for him, it has been about having an opportunity
and getting his confidence where it needs to be. He's here on
scholarship like the rest of the players because he deserves to be
here. He was a great scorer in high school and a good defender,
too. He can pick up a lot of slack for us. But he is still young, a
freshman who can make a lot of mistakes.
<p>
   ``I'm not really surprised. I'm pleasantly surprised. He's
remained consistent since he has been a starter (the last five
games).''
<p>
   With the loss of Higgins, the pressure is on Holmes to fill the
senior's big shoes. While the freshman is a better outside shooter,
Higgins was the team's top athlete, defensive player and leader.
Although being tabbed as the 1997 Big Sky honorable mention pick's
replacement can be stressful, Holmes has a bigger challenge.
<p>
   ``(The loss of Higgins) brings no added pressure to me at all,''
said Holmes. ``The only thing that brings pressure to me is coach
being my uncle. I always think my uncle is going to want more. He
is going to want me to work harder than anybody and ever since I
was in high school I've always wanted to impress him on the court.
Now I have that chance.''

<p>
   ARCADIA  &MD;  Midday rain Sunday turned the Santa Anita track
sloppy. Star attraction Exotic Wood was scratched from the El
Conejo Handicap. Bobby Frankel, trainer of The Exeter Man, wanted
to scratch, too.
<p>
   But owner Patrick Sheehy, a Newport Beach physician, talked him
out of it. And The Exeter Man, with jockey Garrett Gomez, won the
$106,700 sprint by 1{ lengths as the 8-1 long shot in a small
field.
<p>
   ``If it was up to me, I would have stayed home and watched the
football games,'' Frankel said, standing in the mud. ``(Sheehy)
said, `I think we can win.' I said, `It's up to you.'
<p>
   ``It's good when you've got smart owners.''
<p>
   The Exeter Man, a 6-year-old gelding by Capote, isn't a
confirmed sprinter like his four opponents in the 5{-furlong El
Conejo, the shortest handicap on the Santa Anita schedule. The
bettors liked Tower Full, who was 2 for 2 on wet tracks, and Paying
Dues, a stakes star making his first start in nearly a year.
<p>
   Paying Dues was slow out of the gate and finished last. Tower
Full was well placed and got past front-runner Red for second place
but couldn't hold off The Exeter Man's rally.
<p>
   The Exeter Man ($18.80) surprised anybody who handicaps a horse
off his latest race. He ran in the Cigar Mile at Aqueduct in
November and didn't finish.
<p>
   ``(Jockey Mike Smith) thought he took a bad step and thought he
broke down, and pulled him up,'' Frankel said. ``Then, after the
race, he was fine.''
<p>
   Before the trip east, The Exeter Man won two local sprints,
including Hollywood Park's Lit de Justice Handicap, named for the
1996 El Conejo winner.
<p>
   The Exeter Man was clocked in 1:02 1/5. The victory was the
first for Gomez in a Santa Anita stakes.
<p>
   Notes: D. Wayne Lukas led the nation's trainers in purses for
the 14th time in 15 years. His horses earned $10.4 million in 1997.
Jerry Bailey ($18.3 million) led the jockeys for the third straight
year. ... Lukas and Bailey teamed up with 3-year-old Time Limit to
win the Spectacular Bid at Gulfstream Park on Sunday as 1-5
Polished Brass finished fifth. ... Favorites blanked in the
pick-six. Carryover for Wednesday: $91,826.

<p>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  &MD;  Time was preciously slipping away Sunday  &MD; 
the drive, the game, the season for the Kansas City Chiefs. It was
the final seconds and the Chiefs trailed by 4 points and were deep
in Denver Broncos territory. Click, click, click. A ball of
confusion. Tick, tick tick.
<p>
   And then, suddenly, after a 4th-and-2 Chiefs pass from the
Denver Broncos 20 fell harmlessly into the end zone, there was no
time left for Kansas City. No football, either. Another glorious
regular-season wasted. Another dream dashed.
<p>
   Denver did it. It created an imaginative offensive plan and
assembled a daring, forceful defensive scheme and then put both
into action. Denver stuffed the Chiefs running game and then
punched the Chiefs defense with a grinding ground game. It mixed
the run and pass efficiently on offense and dared the Chiefs to win
with their passing game. A gamble. A roll of the dice. A lucky
seven.
<p>
   Denver won, 14-10, here before 76,965 stunned and disappointed
fans at Arrowhead Stadium who once again saw their beloved Chiefs
earn homefield advantage throughout the playoffs only to lose in
their first playoff game. In 1995, it was the Indianapolis Colts
who strode in here and pulled the upset. Now this from Denver, one
of the Chiefs' nastiest rivals.
<p>
   Denver (14-4) plays at Pittsburgh (12-5) on next Sunday for the
American Football Conference championship and the right to
represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXXII on Jan. 25.
<p>
   Kansas City (13-4) stays home.
<p>
   ``I don't know  &MD;  this is the second time we had the table set,''
said a stoic and hurt Marcus Allen, the Chiefs special running
back. ``There is not a lot of rhetoric right now. There is nothing
but disappointment.''
<p>
   It was the end, though, that befuddled all.
<p>
   Kansas City got the ball at its 17 with 4:04 left and down
14-10. Everything was set for a game-winning drive.
<p>
   The Chiefs moved upfield and at the 2-minute mark they were at
their own 49. Coming out of that timeout, quarterback Elvis Grbac
hit receiver Andre Rison on a 23-yard gain. Ball at the Denver 28
now and Kansas City had one time out left. It inexplicably used it.
<p>
   And then on the next three pass plays of 1, 3 and 4 yards, the
Chiefs did not get out of bounds. That set up 4th-and-2 from the
Denver 20. And then Kansas City, rather than going for the first
down, tried the Grbac pass to receiver Lake Dawson in the end zone.
<p>
   Darrien Gordon, the Broncos flashy cornerback, was there to swat
it away, and in, effect, swat the Chiefs away. Only 12 seconds
remained. One Denver snap and  &MD;  poof!  &MD;  it was all up in smoke for
the Chiefs.
<p>
   Why call a time out after the two-minute warning had just given
you one?
<p>
   ``Because I thought at that point in time I wanted to make sure
that we got everything organized and ready to go,'' said Marty
Schottenheimer, the Kansas City coach.
<p>
   Why throw a 20-yard pass into the end zone when you need two
yards for a first down?
<p>
   Grbac's answer: ``It was fourth down and we had some
communication problems with the head set and the crowd noise. I
couldn't hear. It really was even before that play that I had to
call plays on my own.''
<p>
   And in doing that, Grbac decided to call something that would
give him a chance, something with maximum protection where he could
take a shot into the end zone and not take the chance of being
sacked. He said he did not call for a short pass route as an
alternative. He said there were plenty of opportunities for the
Chiefs to get the ball out of bounds before that and they simply
did not do it.
<p>
   In a word, this is what the Kansas City clock management in that
final situation was: horrible.
<p>
   ``They certainly looked confused,'' said Broncos cornerback Ray
Crockett.
<p>
   ``I was really surprised at the end,'' said Broncos end Alfred
Williams. ``He went for the whole thing when they only needed a
couple of yards for a first down.''
<p>
   ``I don't know what was going on with that,'' Gordon said.
``It's something for them to think about for all of their
offseason.''
<p>
   Ouch!
<p>
   That is how Denver played this game Sunday, pulling no punches
and offering plenty. Denver put the Chiefs in that last-gasp,
desperate situation by forcing its will in the game as well as its
way.
<p>
   There was 1:56 left before halftime when Denver scored the
game's first points on a 1-yard run by Terrell Davis (25 carries,
101 yards, two touchdowns). The key play was a 17-yard pass on
3rd-and-7 to the Kansas City 4 to receiver Rod Smith. He ran a
crossing route right to left that crossed up the Chiefs. It was an
omen for later in the game as the half ended with Denver ahead 7-0.
<p>
   The Chiefs answered with the opening drive of the second half,
moving 67 yards and nearly scoring on a Grbac to tight end Tony
Gonzalez three-yard scoring pass. But officials ruled Gonzalez out
of bounds on his catch. Kansas City settled for a field goal and a
7-3 game. Then with 0:10 seconds left in the quarter, Grbac this
time found Gonzalez within the end zone and it was a 12-yard pass
that gave Kansas City a 10-7 lead.
<p>
   ``We ran a lot of new formations today on offense and we came
after them on defense,'' said Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. ``I'm
excited, to say the least. To come here and play this well with
this crowd and handle ourselves well when faced with adversity
makes me proud.''
<p>
   He was awfully proud because in the fourth quarter, Denver
turned the game its way for good.
<p>
   Receiver Ed McCaffrey early in the fourth quarter caught a
43-yard pass on 3rd-and-5 for 43 yards to the Kansas City 1. That
proved the play of the game. Davis scored from 1-yard and the
Broncos defense held, all the way until the final, desperate,
confusing Kansas City final fling.
<p>
   ``We brought eight men in the box to stop the run,'' said Denver
safety Steve Atwater. ``We blitzed much more than we ever do. We
came out on offense with brand new formations. We confused them. We
outplayed them. We won.''

UCLA STILL LIKES CONFERENCE CHANCES &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;

<p>
   TUCSON, Ariz.  &MD;  There was no hint of desperation, no sense of a
league season lost. In fact, the UCLA locker room has been more
depressed after victories than it was after the 87-75 loss at
Arizona on Saturday night.
<p>
   The nonchalance and mangled pizza boxes scattered throughout the
tiny room in McKale Center were reminiscent of the postgame scene
after UCLA's 48-point loss at Stanford last year.
<p>
   ``I think as a freshman I would be more worried about this loss
than I am,'' senior Toby Bailey said. ``But we know it's a long
season. There are still a lot of games to play. As long as we
bounce back quick, we can still win the Pac-10 and be there in
March.''
<p>
   Saturday's defeat becomes inconsequential if the Bruins (9-2,
0-1) win tonight at Arizona State  &MD;  just as they recovered from the
Stanford loss last year to conquer Cal. The goal on Pac-10 road
trips, especially in the desert and Bay Area, is a split. The
Bruins get that tonight, the trip immediately becomes a success.
<p>
   ``Last year Arizona went to L.A. and got swept and went to the
Bay Area and got swept,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``You do
that, and you're looking at fifth place. The teams that have won
the league have split on the road and won at home. If you get a
couple (road) sweeps, then you're looking at 15-3. If you get swept
on the road, you have to get one back.''
<p>
   The Pac-10 balance of power has shifted south this season. UCLA
and Stanford will be difficult to beat at home. But with Cal and
USC slumping, the toughest trip  &MD;  the most likely place to get
swept  &MD;  is Arizona.
<p>
   The Wildcats are nearly unbeatable in McKale Center, and winning
at Arizona State won't be easy. Under interim coach Don Newman, the
Sun Devils are the Pac-10's biggest surprise, posting an 11-3
record and taking mighty Kansas to overtime.
<p>
   Indifference is UCLA's ally. The Bruins understand that Pac-10
titles are not won or lost in the opening game, and that the NCAA
Tournament is two months away. Unlike Arizona, which is in February
form, UCLA is at the starting gate, surveying the turf and
welcoming suspended starters Kris Johnson and Jelani McCoy to the
race.
<p>
   ``We're not going to hit on all cylinders until the second half
of the league,'' Lavin said. ``If a band has a different drummer
and a different sax player, it's going to play different music.''
<p>
   After all they've endured the past 15 months, the Bruins have
learned to dance to their own beat.
<p>
   ``We know how good we are,'' Bailey said. ``We've got a lot of
confidence. We were right in the (Arizona) game the whole game,
despite their great crowd and all the emotion.
<p>
   ``We know when we're hitting on all cylinders we'll be hard to
beat.''

 &UR; A WOMEN'S ERA STILL UNREALIZED &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Twenty-seven years ago, when Bella Abzug emerged from
the feminist movement to become a nationally known congresswoman
representing Manhattan, she had no doubt that her election marked
the start of an era. By the century's end, Abzug assumed, women
would routinely hold senior elected positions across New York
state.
<p>
   How wrong she was.
<p>
   The prospect of two women running for statewide office this
November  &MD;  Geraldine Ferraro, who is expected to announce on Monday
for the U.S. Senate, and Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is running for
governor  &MD;  is, for whatever excitement it stirred in some quarters,
a reminder of how little women have advanced in New York politics
since Abzug took office in 1971.
<p>
   Voters in this state have yet to elect a single woman to
statewide office (excepting two female lieutenant governors,
elected as adjuncts to male governors). There have been no female
governors, U.S. senators, state comptrollers or attorneys general.
New York City has yet to elect a female mayor; indeed, all three
citywide officials who took the oath of office on New Year's Day
were men.
<p>
   For all its supposed political sophistication, New York lags
behind California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas, to name a few
places, when it comes to women in office. New York even trails
Kansas, which elected Nancy Kassebaum Baker to the Senate 20 years
ago.
<p>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' a glum Abzug said on Sunday. ``New
York stands very strongly for the status quo. They don't seem to
want any change. We have to fight back. I'm sick and tired of
seeing just men run this city and state. After all, we're a
majority here.''
<p>
   Why women have made so little progress in New York politics is
open to question. Abzug blames the Democratic Party, dominated by
men who, she says, have no interest in helping women find their way
into office. Other Democrats suggest that the New York electorate
is at fault  &MD;  men and women alike. New York women, they say, have
shown little inclination to make history. (Just ask Mayor Ruth
Messinger.)
<p>
   ``New York thinks of itself as avant-garde, in advance of the
rest of the country,'' said Karen Burstein, who ran unsuccessfully
for state attorney general in 1994. ``But actually, we've been
riding behind the country for 20 years.''
<p>
   And then there are the candidates. The most prominent female
politicians of the past generation  &MD;  Abzug, Messinger, Carol
Bellamy and Elizabeth Holtzman among them  &MD;  have not, as a rule,
been the kind of candidates whom voters tend to welcome into their
living rooms. ``I've thought a lot about that,'' said Burstein.
``The women that we've had in New York have been  &MD;  how can I put
this in a politic way?  &MD;  threatening.''
<p>
   In truth, as Burstein noted, it takes a certain caliber of woman
to confront the dominant males of New York politics, as exemplified
by Holtzman's challenge to Rep. Emanuel Celler of Brooklyn in 1972,
and that might not wear so well over the long run. ``Women
candidates in New York have been uppity and hard to swallow,''
Burstein said.
<p>
   There is of course one other force at work: Female candidates
are judged differently then male candidates. The belligerence New
Yorkers find so appealing in their men  &MD;  Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani being only the latest examples of the blend
of politics and testosterone  &MD;  seems unacceptable when it comes to
women.
<p>
   Will things change in 1998? There are more than a few women who
look at 1998 with more fear than hope. They say that Ferraro and
McCaughey Ross are, whatever their attributes, potentially flawed
candidates whose campaigns could conceivably set back the cause.
<p>
   McCaughey Ross is new to elective politics and the Democratic
Party, and her inexperience  &MD;  combined with a rather quirky manner
 &MD;  could be the ingredients for a shellacking at the hands of Gov.
George Pataki, who has a history of rough play on the political
field, against men and women alike.
<p>
   Ferraro lost the devastatingly negative 1992 primary after her
opponents, Holtzman among them, trashed her ethics and business
dealings. Ferraro's advisers believe that will not happen again
this year, because her competitors will not risk the wrath that
Ferraro's opponents earned, particularly from women, in 1992.
<p>
   Perhaps. The other Democrats seeking D'Amato's seat, Rep.
Charles Schumer of Brooklyn and Mark Green, the public advocate,
said in interviews that they had no intention of raising those
issues. But they declined an invitation during interviews last
weekend to offer a blanket pledge not to make such attacks. And if
Ferraro wins the primary, she faces D'Amato.
<p>
   All of which means that at this time next year, Abzug might find
that the watch she began in Congress 27 years ago is not over yet.

 &UR; ABC GRANTS REPRIEVE TO A DESERVING LEGAL DRAMA &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By JOHN CARMAN &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Ten o'clock on Saturday night is TV's darkest hidey-hole, a
place where dramas gather dust in obscurity.
<p>
   That's where ``The Practice'' has been all season. ``The
Practice'' might have been made perfect, or nearly so, by producer
David E. Kelley, but you needed a flashlight and a map to find it.
<p>
   With ``Monday Night Football'' finished for the year, though,
ABC has juggled its Monday lineup and brought the legal drama into
the open, beginning Monday night.
<p>
   Kelley responds strongly but curiously, with an uncompromising
story  &MD;  he wrote the script  &MD;  that practically dares new viewers to
try bonding with the show's lead character, maverick Boston
attorney Bobby Donnell (series star Dylan McDermott).
<p>
   The episode saddles Donnell with responsibility for the deaths
of three cops, along with the execution-style killing of a police
informant.
<p>
   That's a risky tactic, to say the least, for a struggling
series. But Kelley jiggers the story interestingly as a provocative
conflict between professional ethics and morality.
<p>
   Donnell learns from his new love interest, prosecutor Helen
Gamble (Lara Flynn Boyle), that the police are about to raid a drug
dealer who is, unknown to Helen, Donnell's client.
<p>
   Donnell feels obligated to tip off his client (guest actor James
Paradise). The drug dealer then dispatches the informant who
snitched on him and springs a deadly ambush on the police.
<p>
   In the aftermath, Donnell is charged with reckless homicide. The
incident doesn't exactly grease his romance with Boyle's character,
either.
<p>
   ``The Practice'' is a show with a dingy look to match the
shadings of its legal dramatizations. But however deliberately drab
it looks, the series is a genuine sparkler capable of engaging
viewers' minds along with their emotions.
<p>
   ``I'm a criminal defense attorney,'' Donnell argues in his own
behalf. ``I represent bad people. The adversary system is premised
on the defense attorney doing whatever he can to get the guy off.
It's drummed into us.''
<p>
   Beginning Monday night, ``The Practice'' follows the similarly
relocated ``20/20'' on ABC's Monday schedule; for now, ``20/20'' is
on Fridays and Mondays, instead of Fridays and Thursdays.
<p>
   It might have made more sense to reverse ``20/20'' and ``The
Practice,'' but that would have forced an awkward programming
coincidence that Kelley couldn't allow. At 9 p.m. Mondays, ``The
Practice'' would compete with another Kelley production, Fox's
``Ally McBeal.''
<p>
   By the way, Dyan Cannon pops up on ``The Practice'' Monday
night, apparently as the same judge she occasionally plays in
``Ally McBeal.'' Both shows are set in Boston, where Kelley himself
was a lawyer until he caught the television bug.
<p>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
    &MD;  There's no excuse for the networks to have dawdled so long in
spoofing home and hearth doyenne Martha Stewart, but the delay is
over. A grateful nation can now exhale in relief.
<p>
   Two such comedies are now in the works, both at CBS, and the
first to reach the air is ``Style &AMP; Substance,'' with Jean Smart
and Nancy McKeon, making its premiere Monday night. Smart, who's
been searching for a hit since ``Designing Women,'' is Chelsea
Stevens, whose penchant for cooking, decorating and mulching has
led to a media empire. McKeon co-stars as the practical Jane Sokol,
Chelsea's new business manager.
<p>
   The joke is that Chelsea, in McKeon's words, lives ``in some
strange world of potpourri and jam,'' where perfect hors d'oeuvres
are the cure for any problem. And that she's a mess, in a way; she
sent her ex-husband to the store so often that he ran off with the
checkout clerk.
<p>
   With McKeon and almost any other actress, ``Style &AMP; Substance''
would have neither. But Smart, with her dehydrated comic delivery,
saves the show. Her Chelsea is ditzy without being dippy, if that
makes sense. Behind her unruly obsessions is an authentic cunning
streak.
<p>
   Farther up the pipeline at CBS is ``Simple Life,'' a Judith
Light sitcom that's also based on Martha Stewart. Maybe CBS could
ladle it into a mason jar and keep it for next year.

   Overheard at the Museum of Modern Art: Two elderly women, one
whose vision seemed none too good, viewing the Egon Schiele show.
Toward the end of the show, one of the women walked up very close
to a painting, peered at it, and said, ``This is the most erotic
painting in the whole exhibit.'' Her friend, obviously thinking she
had missed something (as, I confess, did I), also stepped close and
studied the painting. After a minute, the second woman said, ``But

   Dear Diary:
<p>
   In the designer-handbags department of a very busy
Bloomingdale's, I sighed wistfully as I admired the array of pricey
purses, bags and totes. Then I noticed a young girl next to me, no
more than 10 years of age, who, after a thorough review of the
display shelves, handed her mother a miniature black nylon handbag.
``This is the one, Mom,'' she stated decisively.
<p>
   ``Are you sure?'' came the response. The mother's voice tensed
up as she held the bag for her own inspection and asked again,
``You're positive this is the one you want?''
<p>
   ``Yes, that's what I said, Mom,'' answered the 10-year-old, who
was getting restless. I gulped as I noticed the price tag: $140.
``If I get it for you, will you be extra careful with it?'' said
the mother, still cautious.
<p>
   Obviously weary of the debate, the girl slumped nonchalantly
against the display and got to the point. ``Mom,'' she said, ``if
what you really mean is will I let you borrow it, that won't be a
problem.'' After a moment of silence, mother and daughter headed
for the cashier.

   A scene in Beth El Cemetery: As I walked along a minor path not
too long ago, I noticed a lone figure off in the distance
gesticulating vigorously. Slowly and carefully, I approached and
observed the woman, still gesturing, but not uttering a word.
Timidly I asked, ``May I help you?'' She turned and replied: ``No,
thank you. I visit my parents who were deaf mutes frequently,
giving my father the news of the day and my mother some gossipy
tidbits.''

   During our holiday visit to the Winter Garden in the World

Santa photo-op nearby. While Byron checked out the view from the
mezzanine, I went over to ask about prices. The young lady in
charge handed me a printed schedule and, seeing me unaccompanied
and noting my senior status, reassured, ``It would be half price
for you, sir.''

   It was that time of the year, and I had presented bills, in
envelopes provided by the local bank, to the maintenance men,
doormen and superintendent of my Upper East Side apartment
building. Except for Sandor, who had the night shift. I retire
early, so I didn't see him very often.
<p>
   When I caught up with him, I gave him the envelope, a handshake
and a ``Merry Christmas.'' Before I could withdraw my hand, he
quickly bent and kissed it. ``And to you, too, madame,'' he said.
The gesture was unexpected, so courtly, so Old World, so romantic,
that when I returned to my apartment, I lifted my hand to my nose,
relieved that I'd just washed it with delicately scented soap.

dashed out without them. Later, filing out of the plane, she heard
a low voice behind her, ``Miss, you have shoulder pads hanging from

<TEXT>
<p>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 5:
<p>
   No one has ever accused Chief Justice William Rehnquist of
bleeding-heart tendencies. It was thus extraordinary for him to get
into a confrontation last week with Sen. Orrin Hatch and other
conservative Republicans over what the chief justice said was an
inexcusable holdup by the Senate over President Clinton's
nominations for the federal bench.
<p>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dismissed the
criticism, blaming President Clinton for the delays and the federal
judges for the problem of overworked courts. His response was
disingenuous. The vacancies in nearly 1 out of 10 seats on the
federal bench result from obstructionism by certain members of the
Senate.
<p>
   Politics can never be separated from the confirmation process,
but Rehnquist was right to describe Republican behavior as unusual.
It is not simply that conservatives are eager for revenge over what
they still feel was unwarranted Democratic hostility to the Supreme
Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. More
important, Republican strategists have decided that fulminating
about liberal judges fires up the faithful and raises money. The
charge is absurd, since Clinton's appointments have been
distinguished by their moderation. In fact, many of the judges
reviled in the right-wing fund-raising appeals were appointed by
Presidents Reagan and Bush.
<p>
   Whatever their reasons, Republican obstructionism is worse than
anything Democrats did in the past. Clinton nominated 78 judges
last year, the Senate confirmed only 36. Some names have been sent
to the Senate floor by the Judiciary Committee only to be held up
because one or more right-wing senators exercised their prerogative
to block a vote. At least 11 nominations have been sitting around
for more than a year. As the chief justice pointed out, if the
Senate wants to reject nominations, it should do so with an
up-or-down vote.
<p>
   As the most important senator on judicial matters, Hatch has
shown independence in the past. He has even endorsed judicial
nominees that his own colleagues oppose. Now that Rehnquist has
shown the leadership to speak for the institutional needs of the
bench, Hatch should rise to the occasion and address the
institutional responsibilities of the Senate rather than
surrendering to the petty tactics of the blockading few.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  A struggling immigrant businessman was charged Sunday
with setting fire to his own tire-repair shop in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, triggering a huge explosion that leveled the shop and a
car-repair garage next door, heavily damaged a third business and
shattered windows in a row of nearby houses.
<p>
   The fire ignited by the 12:41 a.m. blast at 739 Prospect Place
raged for two and a half hours, threatening an adjacent six-story
apartment building and a Pentecostal church before it was brought
under control, the authorities said.
<p>
   The businessman, Samuel Hallal, 52, a co-owner of the Prospect
Tire Center, was arrested Sunday afternoon at Kings County Hospital
Center, where he was in stable condition after being treated for
minor injuries to his head, hands and knees, a police spokesman
said.
<p>
   Investigators at the scene, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Hallal was found dazed and injured, wearing latex gloves and
reeking of gasoline. They said he told investigators that he had
arrived at the tire shop after hearing that someone had tried to
break in and was rolling up the metal security grate to look around
when the one-story shop exploded.
<p>
   But the investigators said they believed Hallal was actually
closing the grate behind him after having set the fire.
<p>
   Hallal, of East New York, was injured when he was thrown 40 feet
across the street by the blast, Deputy Fire Chief Charles Blaich
said. A firefighter, Paul Bonanno, also suffered a minor hand
injury.
<p>
   Officials said they were investigating a possible
insurance-related motive after Hallal made conflicting statements
about whether he had taken out a policy recently.
<p>
   Hallal's wife of two years, Celyne, said she could not imagine
her husband destroying the shop, which he and a partner opened
about six months ago. ``He's not the type of person to do something
like that,'' she said at the couple's cramped ground-floor
apartment, where no walls separate the children's bed from their
parents'. ``He doesn't stop working. He's addicted to working  &MD;  he
can't sit down.''
<p>
   Mrs. Hallal, like her husband a native of Grenada, said he and
his partner, another West Indian immigrant whom she did not know,
had invested heavily in the shop, buying new tires and installing
costly lighting and other equipment. Hoping to make the investment
pay off, he worked seven days a week, she said, even working
through the holidays while she and her two small children visited
relatives on Long Island.
<p>
   But neighbors said Hallal seemed financially desperate, noting
that he had converted the one-family house he rents into what
appeared to be a rooming house.
<p>
   On Prospect Place on Sunday, city bulldozers strained to lift
blast-strewn I-beams while fire marshals picked through the rubble
for clues. Neighbors, their windows shattered overnight, breathed
air fouled by smoldering tires and leftover propane fumes. Watching
it all were men whose livelihoods were destroyed, and those
customers of the garage whose cars were reduced to mangled, burned
carcasses of steel and iron. Many were moved to tears.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The third business damaged by the explosion and fire was a
father-and-son plumbing warehouse, whose owners said insurance
would cover their losses.
<p>
   But Karl's Auto, an engine-repair shop at 729 Prospect Place,
was completely destroyed, just as its owner, Karl Samuel, said he
was about to celebrate his third year in business.
<p>
   Samuel, 35, a native of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said he
left the garage Saturday about 8 p.m. He returned to find it in
flames.
<p>
   Samuel said he had no insurance. ``Now I'll have to start from

   Stanley Wood, 41, arrived in midmorning, hoping to find his 1995
BMW M3 coupe somehow undamaged. But he was able to identify his car
only after someone noticed the distinctive wheel rims on one of 12
wrecks pulled from the garage.
<p>
   Wood, a mechanic, said he paid $19,000 for the car a month ago.
It needed $3,000 in body work, so he parked it temporarily at
Samuel's garage. The car was not yet insured. ``It was a $31,000
car,'' he said, his voice breaking. ``It had only 28,000 miles.
It's a big loss, man.''

   The Williams Cos., a natural gas pipeline concern, is expected
to announce Monday that it will once again offer a fiber optic
network to telephone companies that are seeking added capacity
because of strong demand.
<p>
   The company had left the business when it sold much of its fiber
optics network, called Wiltel, to Worldcom Inc. for $2.5 billion in
1995. The acquisition helped Worldcom, a big telecommunications
company, to become a major force in the fiber optic industry.
<p>
   As part of the sale, Williams agreed that it would not compete
with Worldcom in parts of the telecommunications business for three
years  &MD;  an agreement that runs out on Monday.
<p>
   During those three years, Williams continued to build up the
fiber optic operations it retained, and it now has an 11,000-mile
network. That is expected to expand to 19,000 miles by the end of
the year.
<p>
   Williams began building its fiber optics network in the
mid-1980s, housing the cable in decommissioned pipelines.

<p>
   When, John Calipari wonders, will his team take the next step?
It eats at him, befuddles him, angers him, wears him out.
<p>
   The Nets (17-14) have made tremendous progress this season under
Calipari, their second-year coach. But he is impatient, mostly
because he knows his team is good.
<p>
   So much so, that late Saturday night after the Nets took a
thorough beating in Cleveland, Calipari admitted he might have to
take a step back from his emotional approach.
<p>
   Simply winning is not a problem for the Nets anymore, as it was
last season when it took them until Feb. 25  &MD;  or 55 games  &MD;  to get
their 17th victory.
<p>
   The Nets win consistently at home: They are 11-3 at Continental
Arena this season. They usually defeat the teams they are supposed
to beat. Recently, they have even shown the ability to win close
games.
<p>
   Now, the Nets have to learn how to win on the road, especially
against the better teams in the National Basketball Association.
After Saturday night's 95-81 loss to the Cavaliers in Cleveland,
the Nets have lost seven of their last eight games on the road.
<p>
   It does not get any easier. Next up for New Jersey: a rematch
with the Knicks on Wednesday night, this time at Madison Square
Garden. And the Knicks will not have forgotten Friday night's
hard-fought 103-98 Nets victory at Continental Arena in the first
meeting between the teams this season.
<p>
   First, though, Calipari is hoping he can forget the Nets' most
recent defeat.
<p>
   ``We have no excuses,'' he said in Cleveland late Saturday
night. ``They came off a game where they traveled from Orlando. We
traveled, too. But they had the will to win.
<p>
   ``You're talking about a team that's won 45 games a year, I
believe, for the last couple of years, or at least three of the
last four years. You're talking about a team with us that's trying
to get to that point and understand what it takes to get there.
<p>
   ``We're trying to win our division, trying to compete for the
top of our division. It's all new to us. Every night coming to play
and taking care of your body is something that we're trying to
learn. It's going to take time.''
<p>
   Just how much time, that is what Calipari wants to know. He rode
his players hard on Saturday night  &MD;  Jayson Williams and Kerry
Kittles, in particular.
<p>
   Afterward, Calipari said he had no problems with Williams, who
admitted he was aching all over after playing so many physically
draining minutes this season.
<p>
   But Calipari wants Kittles, his talented second-year guard, to
take his game to another level and gets frustrated when he sees
Kittles get outplayed by players like the Cleveland rookie Derek
Anderson.
<p>
   It all has to do with expectations. And Calipari's expectations
are great. For himself, his players and his team.
<p>
   What Calipari cannot afford to do is have his players tune him
out. Calipari is coming to realize that. Night in and night out, he
stamps his feet, screams and shouts.
<p>
   But after meeting with the assistant coach Don Casey following
Saturday night's defeat, Calipari admitted he may have to ease up
on his players and let them graduate to the next level in a little
more time.
<p>
   ``Hopefully, that's where we'll be at the end of the year,'' he
said.
<p>
   REBOUNDS
<p>
   Sam Cassell missed his first game of the season, sitting out
against Cleveland with a bruised right shoulder blade. Cassell had
aggravated the injury against the Knicks on Friday night and left
the game with eight and a half minutes remaining. Cassell had hoped
to play in Cleveland, but decided against it after the pregame
warmups. Will Cassell be back for Wednesday? ``I'll be ready,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   HARTFORD, Conn.  &MD;  State legislators will consider a number of
proposals this year to combat a relatively new problem in
Connecticut: people who try to cheat casinos.
<p>
   While language is still being written, the proposals are based
on New Jersey's laws, which, for example, make it illegal to
possess counterfeit chips or to use a magnet to take money from
slot machines.
<p>
   Kevin Kane, an assistant state's attorney for New London County,
where there are two casinos owned by Indian tribes, said it was
difficult to prosecute cheaters without such laws. If a person
brings an altered quarter or a counterfeit chip to a casino,
prosecutors must now prove that the person had intended to cheat
and estimate how much money someone might have won illegally, Kane
said.
<p>
   Penalties are also weaker than prosecutors would like, he said.
Sixth-degree larceny is a misdemeanor that carries up to a
three-month sentence and a $500 fine. Kane said he would like to
see those crimes made into felonies that carry up to a five-year
sentence and a $5,000 fine.
<p>
   Kane also said that changing the laws would make cases easier to
prosecute. ``Part of this is to save time and effort we put in
now,'' he said.
<p>
   The state police and casino operators say the problem is
constant, though not rampant. Sgt. Patrick O'Hara of the state
police casino unit estimated that people were caught cheating or
investigated for cheating four or five times a month.
<p>
   In addition, the casinos may find at day's end that a slug has
been used, but with little way to trace the crime, those incidents
may not be reported to the police, said Arthur Henick, a spokesman
for the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, which runs the Foxwoods Resort
Casino in Ledyard.
<p>
   ``It's not a chronic problem, but it is a problem,'' said Tom
Ocevedo, chief of staff for the Mohegan tribe, which owns the
Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville.
<p>
   Mohegan Sun has about 750 surveillance cameras and Foxwoods has
about 3,000, in part to watch for unusual behavior that might
indicate cheating, the police and casino officials said.
<p>
   The figures do not include counterfeit money, which shows up
several times a day, O'Hara said.
<p>
   Although New Jersey introduced many of its anticheating laws
when casinos opened in 1978, Connecticut did not, probably because
casino gambling began here after the tribes won federal
recognition, allowing them to open casinos on their reservations,
rather than through Connecticut's changing its laws.
<p>
   New Jersey makes about 200 cheating investigations or arrests a
year, said a spokesman for the state division of gaming
enforcement, Keith Furlong.
<p>
   The chief state's attorney in Connecticut, John Bailey, called
for the new laws as part of his annual legislative agenda. A
similar measure was passed by the Connecticut legislature's
judiciary committee last year but did not go any further.
<p>
   State Sen. Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president pro tem, said he
did not expect any opposition to the proposed laws.
<p>
   ``Given that we are home to the world's largest and most active
casino,'' Sullivan said, ``it only makes sense that we have
statutes to deal with these crimes.''

 &UR; KYOKO INA HAS HIGH HOPES FOR MEDAL IN TOUGH SEASON &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   MONSEY, N.Y.  &MD;  It was an Upper West Side upbringing for Kyoko
Ina in New York City, complete with Central Park for a sandbox,
weekends at the Bronx Zoo, the Christmas tree at Rockefeller
Center. Her mother had been a swimming champion, her grandfather
had run in the Olympics, so it was inevitable that on one visit to
Rockefeller Center the ice rink would grab the family's attention
as much as the Christmas tree.
<p>
   ``There's only so many times you can see the same children in
the sandbox in the park or see the same monkeys in the zoo,'' Ina
said. ``My parents put me on the ice and I liked it. There's not a
lot of decision making for a kid. You keep your mouth shut and they
keep letting you do it.''
<p>
   Ina stepped wobblily onto a pair of figure skates at age 3 or 4,
and, by age 9 or 10, began training at Sport-o-rama here in
Rockland County, with her longtime coach Peter Burrows. Her parents
introduced her to other sports, but she balked at gymnastics and
swimming, even though her mother, Yoshiko Ina, had been an Asian
Games champion in the breast-stroke.
<p>
   ``She made me practice, and I didn't like that,'' Ina said,
laughing.
<p>
   Eventually, Ina, now 25, became one of the most complete skaters
in the United States, competing at the elite level in both pairs
and singles events. Last winter, she and her partner of seven
years, Jason Dungjen, who is 30, won a national pairs title and
finished fourth at the world championships.
<p>
   This season has been troubled by injury, illness and a lukewarm
reception to a short program skated to ``Zorba the Greek.'' Ina and
Dungjen recently scuttled the short program and returned to the
haunting Japanese drum music that they used to wide acclaim last
season. This week, they are favored, along with Jenni Meno and Todd
Sand, to qualify for the two Olympic pairs berths at the national
championships in Philadelphia.
<p>
   Next month, in Nagano, Japan, Ina and Dungjen hope to challenge
for the first American pairs medal at the Winter Games since Jill
Watson and Peter Oppegard won a bronze at the 1988 Calgary
Olympics. Ina and Dungjen finished ninth at the 1994 Winter Games
in Lillehammer, Norway.
<p>
   Ina and Dungjen are equal to anyone in terms of consistency and
technical difficulty. And they would enjoy a sort of home-ice
advantage in Japan, considering that Ina was born in Tokyo and
competed for Japan as a junior skater.
<p>
   ``It's my birth country, my heritage; a lot of my relatives are
still there,'' Ina said. ``It's nice to know that if I fall, 100
people in the audience will still love me. If I fell in Norway,
nobody knew me, nobody cared.''
<p>
   The daughter of an accountant and an importer-exporter, the
5-foot, 95-pound Ina is the latest in a line of accomplished
athletes in her family. She has a grandfather who ran in the 1924
Summer Olympics and a grandmother who played tennis at Wimbledon.
Skating for Japan in 1986 and 1987, Ina became a national junior
champion, but she grew weary of living in New York and traveling
halfway around the world to compete.
<p>
   ``All my friends were here, and at that stage, friends are more
important than skating,'' Ina said.
<p>
   She worked her way through the American ranks as a singles and
pairs skater, teaming in 1991 with Dungjen, a native of Detroit who
had won a United States junior pairs title in 1983 and finished
second at the world junior championships in 1984 with his sister,
Susan. It is notable that Ina and Dungjen have remained together
for seven years, considering that pairs skaters often change
partners.
<p>
   They received a scare at Skate America last October, when
Dungjen's right thumb bent back to his wrist, partially tearing a
tendon. Later, at Trophy Lalique in Paris, he suffered a case of
food poisoning. He could not remember being injured or sick during
a competition, and now he had been both during one season.
<p>
   This season, Ina and Dungjen used Tatyana Tarasova, the highly
respected Russian coach, to choreograph their short and long
programs. But the ``Zorba'' short program seemed to lack speed and
purpose and to be overly busy with footwork. The Japanese drum
routine is less ornamental and more to the point. Stripped of
excessive decoration, the routine emphasizes upper-body movement,
spotlighting Ina and Dungjen's power and technical superiority.
<p>
   Over all, the skaters have worked to increase their personal
interaction on the ice, in part by compressing their routines,
moving their jumps and spins closer together. In the past, Dungjen
joked, two camera frames were necessary to capture their
side-by-side jumps.
<p>
   The competition for medals appears to be wide open at the
Olympics. A different pair has won the world championship in each
of the past six years. The pair with the most momentum is Yelena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia, but he has a volcanic
temper and they plummeted from third after the short program to
ninth over all at the 1997 world championships.
<p>
   Artur Dmitriev of Russia won the 1992 Olympic title and finished
second in 1994 with a previous partner, but he is a heavy smoker
and a heavy jumper whose dramatic performances with Oksana Kazakova
have been inconsistent. Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany
are the defending world champions, but he was hit by a car in early
December and the resulting arm injury bothered him at a recent
Olympic preview in Munich.
<p>
   ``I'm going in thinking we can medal,'' Dungjen said. ``If
everybody skates the way they normally do, where we skate well and
others tend to make mistakes, there's no reason we shouldn't be on
the podium.''

<p>
   An old newsroom joke is that three examples make a trend.
Manhattan, therefore, is in the midst of an absolute fad of
falling-concrete incidents. On Madison Avenue, on the Upper West
Side, in midtown and the theater district, pieces of buildings are
breaking off and hitting the sidewalk like, ahem, a ton of bricks.
<p>
   In the tabloids we used to call it ``chunking,'' after the
inevitable lead paragraph that begins, ``A chunk of XXXX broke from
a building at. ...'' New Yorkers are stunningly philosophical about
this sort of thing. I once called the Buildings Department hot line
to complain about men chipping away at an apartment facade without
protective scaffolding, and discovered not only that the hot-line
number in the phone book was incorrect, but also that it had been
wrong for several years without anyone noticing.
<p>
   The Terror From the Sky phenomenon does, however, have an effect
on everybody who lives here. It forces New Yorkers to make peace
with the profound arbitrariness of fate. No other community  &MD; 
except maybe the ones along the San Andreas fault  &MD;  teaches that
lesson. For most Americans, disasters occur elsewhere  &MD;  fertilizer
plants and trailer camps and houses built along the flood plain.
New Yorkers hear about the hail of bricks in the Madison Avenue
shopping district and think I went past there last week. An empty
theater on 42nd Street collapses onto the sidewalk about a half
block from Times Square right before New Year's Eve. Immediately,
several million people remember the last time they went to watch
the ball drop and muse that building could have fallen on me.
<p>
   The automobile is responsible for more violent death and injury
than anything else in the United States, but cars are also
protective shells that confer the illusion of invulnerability. New
Yorkers are pedestrians, unarmored and well aware that vehicles are
bigger, faster and perfectly capable of chasing them onto the
sidewalk. Cars will, in fact, follow you into a restaurant and
crush you while you're eating fettucine. (When a taxi plowed into a
leather store in Greenwich Village last summer, injuring 11 people,
the owner of the meat market next door told a Times reporter that
motorists had previously smashed into a tree, an Italian restaurant
and a toy shop on the same corner.)
<p>
   And what do the authorities say when citizens are hit by a car
while having lunch, or flattened by a piece of a parapet while
going to pick up their dry cleaning or  &MD;  as happened a few years
back  &MD;  buried under a ton of plaster while watching a movie at the
neighborhood theater? They were in the wrong place at the wrong
time. It is a deeply New York comment, a tribute to the
uncontrollable nature of urban disaster that is both euphonic and
irrational. As I see it, somebody is in the wrong place at the
wrong time when he decides to patronize the local house of
prostitution on the day of a police raid. But that movie house in
Murray Hill was not a wrong place (even though it was showing
``Psycho III'' at the time). Certainly nobody would want to say
that the ``Lion King'' block on 42nd Street is a wrong place after
all the money the city poured into glitzing it up. The next thing
you know, somebody might suggest that New York City is a wrong
place. In the age of Giuliani, everyone knows that this is the
Capital of the World Whose Best Days Are Yet to Come. Perhaps that
is the reason police officers are permitted less and less freedom
in speaking to the press. In this administration, you hardly ever
hear the traditional, fatalistic cop-comments anymore, like ``He's
lucky just to be alive.''
<p>
   Instead, we get reassuring bureaucratic wisdom from the
buildings commissioner about how chunks of buildings always fall
down in bad weather  &MD;  like apples or very heavy leaves. That's fine
if you're not standing in the Wrong Place.

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds rose in the first
trading of the new year on expectations Japanese stocks and the
economy will remain weak.
<p>
   While Japanese stocks rose before the New Year's break after
foreign financial institutions agreed to help ease South Korea's
credit crunch, traders and investors are still pessimistic about
the prospects for Asian economies.
<p>
   ``There's no silver lining for the economy,'' said Taisuke
Imada, a money market dealer at Dai-Ichi Securities Co. ``There's
no other option except buying bonds.''
<p>
   The benchmark No. 182 government bond, maturing in September
2005, rose 168 yen per 50,000 in face value. Its yield fell 4.5
basis points to 1.610 percent.
<p>
   Bond futures for March delivery rose 0.55 from Tokyo's Dec. 30
close to 130.35.
<p>
   Financial markets in Japan reopened today for a half-day
session.
<p>
   ``Optimism at the end of the year over the Korean debt
rescheduling has subsided,'' said Naomi Hasegawa, a strategist at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities Co. Dealers could be buying bonds in
anticipation of good demand at auctions this week, she said.
<p>
   Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan yesterday --
taken to suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy --- also gave the
Japanese bond market a boost, said Yoshihiko Kaku, a dealer at
Mitsui Trust Securities Co.
<p>
   ``Inflation has become so low that policy-makers need to
consider at what point effective price stability has been
reached,'' said Greenspan. ``Indeed, some observers have begun to
question whether deflation is now a possibility, and to assess the
potential difficulties such a development might pose for the
economy.''
<p>
   Japan's governing party last year proposed a series of economic
measures, including a one-time 2 trillion yen ($15.15 billion)
personal income tax cut and the purchase of bank shares.
<p>
   Still, traders and investors expect such measures to fail to
inject life into the economy.
<p>
   ``There are no reasons to buy stocks,'' said Dai-Ichi
Securities' Imada.
<p>
   Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell almost 2 percent
to 14,956.84 on concern over the prospects for the Japanese
economy.
<p>
   The dollar's rise against the yen in the past several months
also reflects the poor economy in Japan and the strong U.S.
economy, and is unlikely to affect the bond market much in the
short term, traders said.
<p>
   The dollar was last trading at 132.20 yen, down from 132.32 in
late New York trading Friday.
<p>
   The No. 200 bond, which is comparable to benchmark 10-year bonds
in other countries, rose 232 yen per 50,000 in face value. Its
yield fell 5.5 basis points to 1.885.
<p>
   Japanese bond yields don't reflect compound interest, which is
included in calculating the yields on other countries' bonds.
<p>
   At today's compound yield of 1.893 percent, the No. 200 bond
yields 372 basis points less than the 5.62 percent yield on the
benchmark U.S. 10-year note. That spread shrank 11 basis points
from a week ago.
<p>
   The Japanese bond also yields 337 basis points less than the
5.26 percent yield on 10-year German bonds, assuming the latter
paid interest twice a year. That spread widened 11 basis points
from a week ago.
<p>
   The spread between the notional yield on the most active 10-year
Japanese government bond futures contract and the seven-year swap
shrank 3 basis points from Friday to 45 basis points.
<p>
   Corporations use interest rate and currency swaps, involving
payment in different currencies, to guard against changes in the
value of outstanding debt and to cut borrowing costs.
<p>
   The banks and securities firms that provide these swaps can buy
or sell government bonds to minimize the risk of sudden swings in
interest rates.

   (NYT2) DETROIT -- Jan. 4, 1998 -- AUTOMAKERS-ENVIRON-CLR, 1-04
-- John Smith Jr., the chairman of General Motors, answering
questions in Detroit about the company's alternative fuel vehicles.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 5:
<p>
   An American court should be extraordinarily careful before
turning a suspect over to a foreign tribunal for trial. That
sensible principle, however, led to a mistaken ruling on Dec. 17 by
a Texas judge, who freed a Rwandan wanted by an international court
for genocide and crimes against humanity. The judge released
Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, ruling that there was no constitutional
basis to turn him over to the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda. His release was based on faulty reasoning.
<p>
   The indictment against Ntakirutimana, a Hutu pastor, charged
that when Rwanda's genocide began in 1994, he urged Tutsi to hide
in a church and hospital compound, then led armed Hutu to the
compound who slaughtered hundreds of the refugees. Ntakirutimana
fled to Texas to live with his son and was arrested in 1996.
<p>
   The federal magistrate judge, Marcel Notzon, argued that even
though Congress passed a law in 1996 authorizing the United States
to turn over fugitives to the international tribunals for Rwanda
and Bosnia, that law was unconstitutional because the United States
has no extradition treaty with the tribunals. But the Constitution
does not require a treaty to surrender a criminal fugitive.
<p>
   Indeed, the Supreme Court ruled in 1936 that an act of Congress
is sufficient. The United States has also signed a treaty that
bears on this case  &MD; the United Nations Charter. The Rwanda
tribunal, along with one for Bosnia, was created by a U.N. Security
Council resolution. Washington rightly called on Croatia to turn
over the war crimes suspects in keeping with such a resolution.
<p>
   Notzon also questioned the evidence against Ntakirutimana. His
concerns about fairness are important, especially since the Rwanda
tribunal initially was poorly run. But the problems are now largely
solved, and both tribunals have been just. The judge's decision
also seems to betray unfamiliarity with the climate of fear in
Rwanda and how mass murder is carried out.
<p>
   Given the possibility that Ntakirutimana may flee, the Clinton
administration should appeal the case quickly. It would be tragic
if the United States, which has played such a crucial role in the
creation and support of the tribunals for Rwanda and Bosnia, does
not honor the obligations to turn over fugitives that it has urged
on others.

<p>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial Monday, Jan. 5:
<p>
   With more than a million students, New York City's school system
would be difficult to manage in the best of circumstances. Add in
deteriorating buildings, stubborn unions and rapid turnover at the
top, and the job seems insuperable. Yet critics are already
blasting Chancellor Rudy Crew for not moving fast enough, though he
has been in office for only two years.
<p>
   Crew has picked unnecessary fights and failed to disseminate his
ideas clearly and to the widest possible audience. But it is far
too early to say his administration has had no impact. That is
pretty much what Diane Ravitch, the former assistant secretary of
education, did last week when she said that the new governance law
Crew wrested from the State Legislature had made no difference at
all.
<p>
   The new law was in fact a major accomplishment, given the
system's history of corruption and unruliness. Passed just over a
year ago, the law came about only because Crew convinced Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and the Legislature that he was worthy of the
power. The law frees district superintendents from outside
political pressure while holding them accountable for school
performance.
<p>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills is impressed with
Crew's efforts. Just last November, the commissioner commended the
city for improving instruction and removing a record number of
schools, 15 in all, from the state's failing list. Mills placed 20
other New York City schools on the list last year, but noted that
these schools had higher achievement levels than schools that
reached the list in the past. As the overall climate had improved,
Mills said, the state had decided to judge the city's schools by
tougher standards than it would have imposed in the past.
<p>
   Lurking behind Ms. Ravitch's criticism is the presumption that
the public schools are irreparably compromised and that vouchers,
charter schools and semiprivate small schools are the only real
alternatives. Crew considers this a lifeboat approach and has
promised a systemwide renaissance that some outside experts view as
impossible. Given his broad new powers, Crew should be given a fair
chance to see what he can do with them.

<TEXT>
<p>
   BORMIO, Italy  &MD;  Kristina Koznick will ski against the world's
finest slalom racers here on Monday morning, but before she dons
her helmet and the rest of her requisite plastic armor, she will
sit in the warmth of her hotel room and compose a letter to
herself.
<p>
   Koznick, from Minnesota, has used writing as a form of therapy
for years, relying on her ``really big, really sloppy'' penmanship
to work through the vagaries of life. She once filled eight pages
on an airplane during one particularly low moment, and there have
been several such moments since the girl once labeled ``the next
Cindy Nelson'' arrived on the World Cup scene at the precocious age
of 15.
<p>
   But this season, the 22-year-old has put a new twist on her old
habit and begun writing on deadline: just hours before she races.
<p>
   ``I write down what I want to accomplish for the day, but most
of what I write down is just a reminder of why I am here and how
much I like myself as a person,'' Koznick said. ``And when I leave
my room to face the world, I leave in a great mood.''
<p>
   Thus far, she has been returning in a great mood, too. In the
season's first four World Cup slalom races, Koznick has finished
fourth, sixth, fourth and second, becoming the first American to
finish on the podium in the slalom since Julie Parisien in 1992. No
longer is Koznick a gifted skier with a potentially bright future.
Suddenly, she is a gifted skier with a very bright present, and
with the Winter Olympics looming in Nagano, Japan, in February, she
could become as well known to her nation's Nielsen families as she
is to the families who frequent the rope tow and three chairlifts
at her hometown ski resort of Buck Hill.
<p>
   Koznick has been skiing since she was 4. She started skiing
competitively at 6 when her father, Jeffrey, walked into the resort
at Buck Hill and saw her playing a video game. ``I hate video
games; I never gave my kids a quarter,'' said Jeffrey, who is here
to watch his daughter race. ``I told her, `If you have this much
time, we'll put you in another program.' And so that's how she got
into ski racing. It's all because I hate video games.''
<p>
   Jeffrey's goal for Kristina and her brother was that they be
able ``to ski down any hill in the world without crying.''
<p>
   But Kristina did not train on any hill in the world. Throughout
her childhood she trained at Buck Hill with the Austrian-born coach
Erich Sailer, a renowned molder of technical-event talent who
helped develop the 1992 Olympian Joe Levin and Koznick's close
friend and current World Cup teammate, Tasha Nelson.
<p>
   ``We'd use the rope tow, and we'd get 30 to 40 runs in a couple
hours,'' Koznick said.
<p>
   Buck Hill was not named Buck Mountain for a good reason. The
slalom run was not particularly steep and was always well groomed.
Koznick did not ski on powder until she had been skiing for nearly
a decade. ``There I was in Colorado; I could beat all these kids
racing,'' she said, ``but in powder I didn't even know how to
turn.''
<p>
   Koznick learned and set her sights high as the praise continued
to snowball. In 1993, at age 18, she finished 10th in a World Cup
slalom in Sweden, but that August she tore her left anterior
cruciate ligament during a training run in Chile and had to watch
the 1994 Olympics at home as she finished her senior year of high
school.
<p>
   Her fortune would not soon improve. In January 1996, she spent
too long training in the cold after a race in Austria and returned
to her hotel and discovered that both her big toes had turned an
ominous shade of gray. It was frostbite, but Koznick, after
consulting with coaches and a physician, gingerly put her boots on
the next day and competed again.
<p>
   ``After the second run, my feet felt better, and I took my boots
off, and my socks were covered with blood,'' she said. ``The skin
that was all gray was gone.''
<p>
   Koznick rested for four days, then skied again for another
month; she was finally sent home when she could no longer stand
without difficulty. A Minnesota physician informed her she risked
losing her toes if she returned to the circuit too quickly. Another
season was lost, and when a sore back and her plummeting confidence
contributed to poor results last season, she began flirting with
retirement and even applied to colleges.
<p>
   ``I thought, `I can't just hang in there; this is ridiculous. If
I'm not going to enjoy this, I should think about something else,'
'' she said. ``In the long run, I decided that whether I do well in
skiing or not, I like who I am, which was a big step for me.
Growing up, whenever I introduced myself or would be introduced, it
would be, `Oh, you're the skier.' '' It wasn't that I felt I wasn't
a person without skiing. I just didn't know who I was, and it was
like I had to figure out if I liked me without skiing. I swear the
second I figured that out, all of a sudden I wasn't putting that
pressure on myself.''
<p>
   Instead, she was putting down positive thoughts on paper. The
morning of the season's opening slalom race in Park City, Utah, in
November, she wrote that she was ready for a top 10 finish. She
finished fourth and screamed with delight. Five weeks later in
Lienz, Austria, she wrote that she was ready for a top three
finish. She placed second, but this time she was no longer
screaming. She was believing.
<p>
   And what will Koznick write on Monday morning?
<p>
   ``Sure, I'd like to win,'' she said, ``but I think I'll be happy
to stay in the top three and hopefully the morning of Feb. 19, I
will wake up and not doubt myself, and I will win.''
<p>
   Feb. 19 happens to be the day of the Olympic slalom in Nagano.

<p>
   Howard Gilman, the chairman of the Gilman Paper Co. who was a
philanthropist and a collector of photographs and other art, died
on Saturday on an estate near Jacksonville, Fla. He was 73 and
lived in midtown Manhattan.
<p>
   Gilman, who had had heart trouble for some time, died of a heart
attack, said Dr. Jeffrey Borer, a cardiologist who was his longtime
physician and a friend.
<p>
   Gilman was stricken while visiting the estate, White Oak
Plantation. It is the Southern headquarters of the Howard Gilman
Foundation, of which he had been president since its formation in
1981. The foundation's executive offices are in midtown Manhattan.
<p>
   At his death, Gilman was chief executive as well as chairman of
the Gilman Paper Co. and various subsidiaries. He had been chairman
since 1973 and had been chief executive continuously since 1982.
<p>
   The company, owned by the Gilman family for three generations,
operates paper-manufacturing mills in southeastern Georgia and owns
forest land, mainly in Georgia and Florida. Its headquarters are
also in midtown Manhattan.
<p>
   Gilman was intensely interested in the preservation of
endangered species and in dance, in addition to art collecting. The
Howard Gilman Foundation was set up to support activities in the
arts and in wildlife conservation, and medical research into HIV,
AIDS and cardiology.
<p>
   The Gilman Paper Co.'s collection of about 5,000 photographs was
Gilman's brainchild. The more than 250 photographs in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1993 show ``The Waking Dream:
Photography's First Century'' were from that collection. The New
York Times critic John Russell wrote in The Times that the show was
``an event of cardinal importance in the museum world'' and that
the Gilman collection bore ``at every point the mark of an
original, resourceful and unprejudiced curiosity.''
<p>
   The Howard Gilman Foundation also gave the endowment for the
Metropolitan Museum's first permanent gallery dedicated exclusively
to photography, the Howard Gilman Gallery, which was inaugurated in
October.
<p>
   Gilman's involvement with dance included support for the
American Ballet Theatre and numerous other dance companies, Mikhail
Baryshnikov and other dancers and choreographers. He also oversaw
the formation of a wildlife conservation center, on the White Oak
Plantation.
<p>
   Other beneficiaries of his largess include Tel Aviv University,
the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and
the Juilliard School in Manhattan.
<p>
   Gilman was born and reared on Manhattan's Upper East Side,
attended Horace Mann School in the Bronx, received a bachelor's
degree in 1944 from Dartmouth, where he was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa, and served in the Navy during part of World War II.
<p>
   He is survived by his mother, Sylvia Gilman of Manhattan.

<p>
   Robert M. Hunt, a former chief executive of the Tribune Co. died
Dec. 27 at his home in Naples, Fla., from complications of
diabetes. He was 69.
<p>
   Hunt, who was publisher of The Daily News of New York from 1979
to 1984, had been ill for some time, his wife, Sharon Hunt, said.
<p>
   Hunt joined the Tribune Co. of Chicago at 22 as an advertising
salesman in 1950. He rose through the ranks of the company, whose
flagship paper is The Chicago Tribune, and became president and
chief executive in 1975. Four years later, Hunt left Chicago to try
to rescue The News, then owned by the Tribune Co.
<p>
   Damaged by a strike in 1978, The News was at that time in the
odd position of being both the country's biggest metropolitan daily
and also among the weakest. The News was losing its bedrock
working-class readers to the suburbs and to papers like Newsday of
Long Island and The Star-Ledger of Newark. At the same time, New
York advertisers were looking for a more upscale readership of the
kind that The News' rival, The New York Post, was courting with an
afternoon paper aimed at commuters. (The Post began a morning
edition in 1980.)
<p>
   Indeed, Hunt's biggest gamble while at The News was his 1980
effort to produce a competing afternoon edition, Tonight, which
featured soft news about life styles and slicker graphics than the
main paper's rugged tabloid look. But the afternoon edition won
only about 70,000 new readers, not the 200,000 Hunt had hoped for,
and the project was closed after less than a year.
<p>
   ``We gave it our best shot,'' Hunt said in August 1981. ``We
went all out to produce the liveliest, most interesting editorial
package we could, and, damn it, it didn't work.'' The venture lost
$20 million and contributed to the paper's decline, which Hunt
tried to forestall through layoffs and by winning concessions from
the staff.
<p>
   He retired from the Tribune Co. in 1985.
<p>
   In 1991, the Tribune Co. sold The News to Robert Maxwell, the
British publisher, after a five-month strike. The News sought
bankruptcy protection after Maxwell died and his empire unraveled.
The paper is now owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Fred Drasner.
<p>
   In addition to his wife, Hunt is survived by two daughters,
Susan Hunt of Chicago and Jennifer Peskorse of Ballwin, Mo.; a son,
Robert of Kalispell, Mont.; three stepsons, Kevin of Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla., Mark of Phoenix and Erik Vander Kolk of New York City;
five grandchildren, and two sisters, Priscilla Sowler of Volcano,
Hawaii  &MD;  his twin  &MD;  and Joan Nilsson of Seattle.

   Thomas Crawford Mayers, a retired department store executive and
former mayor of Stamford, Conn., died on Dec. 20 at a nursing home
in Stamford where he had lived since 1995. He was 88.
<p>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
<p>
   Mayers was nominated by the Republican Party as a fresh face in
the 1963 Stamford mayoral election, which he won on a pledge to

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Darrell Halloran, the basketball coach at Pace
University, collapsed at halftime of a game against American
International College at Pace's Civic Center Gymnasium in Lower
Manhattan on Saturday afternoon and was pronounced dead shortly
afterward at New York Downtown Hospital. He was 47.
<p>
   Halloran, who lived in Harrison, N.Y., suffered heart failure,
the school said.
<p>
   Joseph O'Donnell, the Pace athletic director, said that Halloran
was stricken while conferring with his assistant coaches near the
locker room in preparation for the halftime talk with the players.
He said that the trainer, Devon Taylor, tried to revive Halloran
and that an ambulance arrived in less than 10 minutes.
<p>
   ``I had no idea it was catastrophic,'' O'Donnell said. ``We felt
the best thing to do was continue the game.''
<p>
   Jim Harter, an assistant, coached the second half in a game that
Pace lost, 75-74.
<p>
   O'Donnell said he informed the players of the coach's death
after the game, and ``they were devastated.'' The school provided a
counselor for the players Saturday night.
<p>
   ``They were very close to him,'' O'Donnell said. ``He was a
father-confessor figure. He worked with the team on the court and
off the court.''
<p>
   O'Donnell said that Halloran was hospitalized last year for
treatment of high blood pressure, but that he was unaware of the
coach's having previous heart problems.
<p>
   Halloran had coached since 1983 at Pace, a Division II school.
He had the most victories of any coach in school history with a
record of 231-180, and the best winning percentage, .562.
<p>
   Halloran joined Pace after coaching for one season at Our Lady
of the Lake University in San Antonio.
<p>
   Born in Hudson, N.Y., he attended high school in Texas and was
captain of the basketball and baseball teams at Rice University. He
coached from 1974 to 1981 at Morris Catholic High School in
Denville, N.J.
<p>
   Halloran's Pace teams won the Eastern College Athletic
Conference Division II championship in 1990 and 1991. He coached
the Setters to a share of the New York Collegiate Athletic
Conference title in 1992 and took the team to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Division II tournament, where it
lost in the first round to California-Pennsylvania, the nation's
No. 1-ranked team.
<p>
   Halloran's survivors include his wife, Eileen, and a son, Sean.

<p>
   It has become standard procedure on the New Jersey Devils. Once
a player holds out, he is finished as a member of general manager
Lou Lamoriello's team. On Sunday, Bill Guerin became the latest
Devil to be dealt after a contract dispute, following such players
as Pat Verbeek, Sean Burke and Kirk Muller.
<p>
   Guerin missed the first 21 games of the season and had asked to
be traded. Lamoriello refused to trade Guerin while he was
negotiating for a new contract, and Guerin was forced to join the
Devils because he wanted to play for the U.S. Olympic team next
month in Japan.
<p>
   Lamoriello traded Guerin and Valery Zelepukin to the Edmonton
Oilers Sunday for Jason Arnott and Bryan Muir. Arnott is a
23-year-old center with a great deal of potential, while Muir is a
24-year-old minor league defenseman who is going directly to
Albany, the Devils' top affiliate in the minor leagues.
<p>
   Arnott has 100 goals in 286 games in the National Hockey League,
all with Edmonton, but he has only five goals in 35 games this
season and has not scored a goal in his last 14 games. There is
also some question about a problem with his right shoulder that
forced him to miss some games this season, including Sunday's loss
to Los Angeles.
<p>
   ``All trades are contingent on health, but I've been assured
he's fine,'' Lamoriello said on a conference call Sunday night. ``I
don't foresee any problems.''
<p>
   Edmonton wanted to trade Arnott because of his lucrative
contract. He was saught by several teams, including the Islanders
and the Rangers, but Lamoriello got him because he gave Edmonton
two established and talented players with relatively small
contracts in Guerin and Zelepukin.
<p>
   Guerin is a power right wing who some said was destined to be
another Cam Neely, the retired star of the Bruins, while Zelepukin
is a swift left wing with plenty of offensive and defensive
attributes.
<p>
   Lamoriello said that Arnott would add another dimension to the
Devils. ``He'll help our coaching staff play different styles,''
Lamoriello said.
<p>
   But coach Jacques Lemaire emphasizes defense, and Arnott is not
a defensive specialist. His best production offensively was in his
rookie year in 1993-94 when he had 35 goals and 33 assists in 78
games. He was in the playoffs for the first time last year and
produced three goals and six assists in 12 games.
<p>
   Lamoriello declined to discuss the events of the past few months
concerning Guerin, saying that he wanted to talk only about
``positive things.''
<p>
   Lamoriello said that Guerin did not force the trade. Lamoriello
said he simply wanted ''to make the team better.''
<p>
   Guerin was drafted first by the Devils and fifth overall in the
1989 draft, but in his five full seasons with the Devils he never
reached what was considered to be his potential. Guerin's best
season was 1996-97, when he shared the team lead in goals scored
with 29. He had five goals and five assists in 19 games this
season, while Zelepukin, playing a defensie role, had two goals and
eight assists in 35 games
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Before Guerin signed a multiyear contract in November, several
members of the U.S. Olympic team, including St. Louis Blues star
Brett Hull, considered a boycott of the Winter Games if Guerin did
not get chosen for the squad by Lamoriello, its general manager.
Early in November, Lamoriello and USA Hockey, the national
federation that controls the team, did not select Guerin in naming
17 players to the 23-man roster.
<p>
   Lamoriello had said that Guerin wasn't named in the first group
of selections because he wasn't in top shape, but some players
apparently felt that Lamoriello was using his control of the
Olympic team roster against Guerin in Devils contract negotiations.
Guerin was included among the final six named on Dec. 1.

 &UR; DOLLAR LITTLE CHANGED VS YEN AMID CONCERN OVER JAPAN'S ECONOMY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar was little changed
against the yen as lingering concern over Japan's economy offset
speculation Japan may sell dollars to slow the yen's decline,
traders said.
<p>
   Persistent worry about the weak Japanese economy kept the dollar
from falling. In an effort to bolster the yen, the Bank of Japan
last month sold an estimated $10 billion when the dollar topped 131
yen.
<p>
   ``Traders are cautious that the Bank of Japan may step into the
market again to stem the dollar's rise because the dollar is now
hovering way above the level that the Bank of Japan intervened last
time,'' said Tetsu Aikawa, manager for foreign exchange at Sanwa
Bank ltd. ``The dollar, however, will possibly top 140 yen by June
as intervention alone cannot change the recent weak-yen trend.''
<p>
   The dollar was quoted at 132.20 yen, compared with 132.32 yen in
late New York trading Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.7976
marks, compared with 1.8025 marks in New York.
<p>
   Haruhiko Kuroda, director general of the Japanese Finance
Ministry's International Finance Bureau, said Japan's ready to act
when necessary to stem the yen's excessive weakness, Reuters news
service reported. The market, however, showed little reaction to
his comment.
<p>
   ``Verbal intervention no longer works,'' said Takayuki Togawa,
manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd. ``Dragging down the
dollar in this manner ended up as just providing a good opportunity
to buy dollars.''
<p>
   Investors and traders have been paying attention to whether
central banks of other countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and
Germany, would join hands with their Japanese counterpart to sell
dollars. So far they've remained on the sidelines.
<p>
   Continued turmoil in Asian currencies has weighed heavily on the
yen, traders said.
<p>
   The Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht plunged
to record lows as slowing economic growth kept investors away from
Southeast Asia. The South Korean won, which plunged 47 percent last
year, also weakened 0.5 percent against the U.S. currency, falling
to 1,703 per dollar.
<p>
   Tumbling currencies and slowing economies in Japan's neighboring
countries is bad for the yen because Asian countries are among
Japan's biggest trading rivals, said traders. ``Weakness in their
currencies against the yen makes their exports more competitive,''
said Tokai Bank's Togawa. ``Asia's malaise definitely will take a
deep toll on the Japanese economy and its currency.''
<p>
   Shares of Japanese exporters fell today in abbreviated trading
after the New Year's holiday break. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index
fell 301.90 points, or 1.98 percent, to 14,956.84.
<p>
   ``Unless the Japanese government comes up with more effective
measures, anxiety over Japan's economy will continue to weigh on
the yen,'' said Togawa.
<p>
   The yen has fallen since July 4, when it was trading at 113.53
to the dollar, as concern intensified over Japan's economic woes --
an economic slowdown verging on recession, rising bad loans and a
string of major corporate bankruptcies.
<p>
   To turn the situation around, the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party and government have announced a succession of proposals over
recent months.
<p>
   The LDP has proposed measures to help revive consumer spending
and bail out troubled financial institutions. The steps include a
one-time, 2 trillion yen ($15.4 billion) personal income tax cut
and up to 30 trillion yen in public money to buy stock in financial
institutions and protect depositors from bank failures.
<p>
   Still, many traders say the proposals are not effective enough
to spur consumer spending or to prevent more financial institutions
from collapsing.
<p>
   ``These measures may temporarily halt the yen's decline, but
won't contribute to the reversal of the yen's weakness,'' said
Sanwa Bank's Aikawa. ``For the yen to recover, the Japanese
government needs to come up with effective measures to stimulate
the economy.''
<p>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4602 Swiss francs,
compared with 1.4702 Swiss francs in late New York trading Friday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.6441, compared with $1.6450
Friday. The mark was quoted at 73.59 yen, compared with 73.40 yen
in New York.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against a basket of 10 major
currencies tracked by Finex, a financial futures exchange. The
Finex dollar index was last at 99.82, compared with 100.10 Friday.

MICHAEL KENNEDY MAY NOT HAVE SEEN TREE HE HIT ON SKI SLOPE &QL; 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   ASPEN, Colo.  &MD;  A large, 3-inch crack on the top of Michael L.
Kennedy's skull indicates he was looking down while skiing and may
never have seen the tree he hit, according to an autopsy report
released Sunday.
<p>
   Kennedy, 39, apparently looked over his right shoulder and
successfully caught a black-and-yellow Nerf ball he had been
tossing with friends and relatives as they skied down Aspen
Mountain on New Year's Eve.
<p>
   But in a flash, his right ski rammed into a tree and Kennedy
lowered his head, hitting the tree head-first, according to Pitkin
County investigator David Blaine.
<p>
   He died within seconds or minutes, the authorities said.
<p>
   Kennedy, a son of Ethel Kennedy and the late Robert F. Kennedy,
was buried Saturday in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline after a
private Mass in Centerville, on Cape Cod, attended by hundreds of
friends and family members.
<p>
   In addition to the straight crack down the center of his skull,
Kennedy suffered several contusions to his brain. Deputy coroner
Tom Walsh concluded that those injuries, along with a severed
spinal cord, caused Kennedy's death.
<p>
   The autopsy showed that Kennedy's only limb injury was a
fractured right wrist and that he had almost no injuries on his
face, except for a few lacerations.
<p>
   The autopsy confirmed reports that Kennedy had not been taking
drugs and had not been drinking alcohol. It also showed that he was
in excellent health.
<p>
   Investigators said Sunday they believed a videotape  &MD;  which
Kennedy reportedly was making before going down the mountain but
was not carrying at the time of the crash  &MD;  was destroyed in the
days following the accident.
<p>
   All other evidence, including the 9-inch football used in the
high-speed game, had been collected as part of the investigation.
<p>
   Blaine said he went to the top of the mountain on the morning
after the accident, before the lifts were open to the public, and
found the foam football, partially hidden in a snowbank, at the
base of the tree Kennedy hit.
<p>
   ``I believe he actually had the ball in his hand,'' Blaine said.
``It was in a position consistent with his having the ball and
dropping it.''
<p>
   A ``pretty significant ding'' in the tree indicated Kennedy hit
it with his ski first, Blaine said. But apart from broken branches,
the tree showed no signs of the crash, indicating Kennedy ``bounced
right off.''
<p>
   Kennedy  &MD;  who stood 5 foot 7 inches and weighed 170 pounds  &MD; 
suffered head injuries consistent with being hit by a blunt object,
Blaine said. The autopsy indicated he had three contusions on the
surface of his brain and massive bleeding from his scalp, in
addition to the jagged crack down the center of his skull.
<p>
   The spinal cord was severed near the top, the autopsy showed.
<p>
   If Kennedy had been wearing a helmet, he would have stood a far
greater chance of survival, Walsh said. Although it would not have
saved his spinal cord, a helmet could have protected his skull and
prevented head trauma. Many doctors recommend that skiers and
snowboarders wear helmets, but the practice is not widespread.
<p>
   But, Walsh added, even with a helmet ``he most assuredly would
have been paralyzed.''

FOREIGN MINISTER QUITS ISRAELI CABINET &QL; 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; c.1998 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   JERUSALEM  &MD;  A simmering political crisis reached a boiling point
Sunday, as Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy announced his
resignation.
<p>
   The move leaves the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu teetering and further derails US-led efforts to revive
the peace process.
<p>
   Making good on a threat he has made several times before, Levy
lashed out at Netanyahu's policies, saying they have undermined the
peace process and undercut social programs for Israel's poor and
working classes.
<p>
   ``One cannot force a policy which the majority of this
government do not want,'' Levy said at a press conference. ``With
all due respect, I am no longer a member of this government.''
<p>
   Levy is a moderate in the far-right government. His decision to
pull his five-member Gesher faction out of the eight-party
coalition leaves the government in control by the slimmest of
margins with 61 out of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament.
<p>
   Netanyahu appeared on national television last night exercising
his survival skills and saying he hoped Levy would reverse his
decision.
<p>
   Under Israeli law, the letter of resignation does not go into
effect for 48 hours, holding out the possibility that Netanyahu
could reach a last-minute compromise with Levy and repair the
fragile coalition he formed after his May 1996 election victory.
<p>
   Saying ``this government is far more stable than people think,''
Netanyahu sounded a familiar tune by playing on the fears of the
Israeli public of what might happen if his conservative Likud
coalition fell and the Labor Party came back into power.
<p>
   ``I saw Labor Party members smiling while they listened to the
foreign minister. I say to them, `Don't smile too quickly,'''
Netanyahu told the television audience. ``The national camp will
not repeat the dreadful mistake it made back in 1992 when it
brought the left-wing government back into power.''
<p>
   But experts question whether Netanyahu's threat could stave off
the most recent in a series of crises that have plagued his
government.
<p>
   The current crisis raises the specter of a ``no confidence
vote,'' which requires an absolute majority of the Knesset, or 61
votes, to force a general election. If 80 Knesset members vote for
the ``no confidence'' measure, then the election would be only for
the prime minister's seat.
<p>
   Mark Heller, a political analyst at the Tel Aviv-based Jaffee
Center, said, ``This makes the government far more vulnerable. It's
a razor-thin majority. Chances of early elections have obviously
increased.''
<p>
   A senior Netanyahu adviser, David Bar-Illan, was dismissive of
the notion that the government's collapse was imminent, and noted
that other governments had survived with a 61-vote majority in the
Knesset, including that of the late Labor prime minister, Yitzhak
Rabin.
<p>
   Political opponents such as Yossi Beilin, a Labor leader and one
of the architects of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, were
quick to predict Netanyahu's downfall: ``This government will not
last for long. I don't know whether it will happen tomorrow or not,
but I know it is much closer.''
<p>
   The current crisis was precipitated by a vicious battle over the
government's proposed $57.5 billion budget. Analysts say Netanyahu
brought the crisis upon himself. They say he failed to secure the
necessary votes and has carelessly built up a long list of
political enemies inside his own coalition who are now using the
budget process to bludgeon the prime minister and to advance their
own interests.
<p>
   The budget is set to go to a vote today. Last night, Netanyahu
said he would push ahead with the vote and would not propose a
delay. He said he was confident that he would pass his budget. He
also said that he has made conciliatory moves toward Levy by
increasing funding for the fight against unemployment and money
earmarked for poor ``development towns,'' which have been the
stronghold of Levy's political support. Levy has dismissed the
moves as ``hocus pocus.''
<p>
   The Moroccan-born Levy, a 60-year-old father of 12 children, is
a political veteran who built his career as the champion of
Israel's Sephardic Jews, a largely poor community with roots in
Arab countries that has become a backbone of Netanyahu's coalition.
<p>
   Levy has also staked out ground as the most moderate member of
the coalition, backing Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
calls for a ``credible and significant'' Israeli troop pullback in
the occupied West Bank.
<p>
   The looming question Sunday was whether the political crisis
could further delay the stalled peace process.
<p>
   Netanyahu's summit with President Clinton has been pushed back
by eight days, to Jan. 20. The US envoy, Dennis Ross, who had been
scheduled to arrive in Israel Monday, has postponed his trip until
Tuesday.
<p>
   The crisis further exacerbates the disagreement within the
Cabinet over the scope of a pullback or the extent of the
``security zones'' Israel wants to establish in the West Bank.
Local press reports have said that Netanyahu has proposed a
pullback of only 8 percent of the West Bank. The United States has
reportedly ordered at least 10 to 15 percent.
<p>
   A PLO official, Marwan Kanafani, said Sunday, ``Netanyahu's
policies have led to the disenchanment of everybody including his
partners in the coalition, and we hope this issue won't be used by
Netanyahu to delay the peace process.''

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks fell on the first
day of trading in 1998, sending the benchmark Nikkei 225 index
under 15,000 as investors remained pessimistic over the outlook for
the country's stagnating economy.
<p>
   ``Just because the year has changed, it doesn't mean the
situation has changed,'' said Susumu Inada, director of Tokio
Marine MC Asset Management Co.
<p>
   The Nikkei 225 sank 301.90 points, or 1.98 percent, to
14,956.84. The broader Topix index fell 8.4 points, or 0.71
percent, to 1166.63.
<p>
   The decline was led by materials makers and chemical
manufacturers like Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., as investors
worried their profits would be battered at home by sluggish
consumer demand. Demand has been weak since the national sales tax
was raised to 5 percent last April.
<p>
   Investors are also concerned that Japanese materials
manufacturers can't compete with Asian makers whose currencies have
depreciated over the past year, giving their products a price edge
in overseas markets.
<p>
   Takeda Chemical Industries, a maker of health products, fell 110
yen to 3,610. Nippon Kayaku Co., a chemical producer, sank 49 yen
to 505. Koyo Iron Works and Construction Co. declined 20 yen, or 22
percent, to 70. Nihon Cement Co. tumbled 32 yen to 237. Mitsubishi
Corp., a general trading company, shed 70 yen to 960.
<p>
   Almost the same number of stocks declined as rose.
<p>
   An estimated 156 million shares traded, less than the 194
million that changed hands on Dec. 30, the previous trading day.
Both days were half-sessions that ended at 11 a.m. Japanese stock
markets will return to normal full-day schedules from tomorrow.
<p>
   Carmakers and parts manufacturers also sank on investor concern
that domestic sales would continue to fall.
<p>
   Toyota Motor Corp. fell 100 yen to 3,640. Nissan Motor Co.
retreated 15 yen to 525. Mazda Motor Corp. declined 10 yen to 300.
Denso Corp., a producer of electrical parts for cars, plunged 190
yen, or 8 percent, to 2,160.
<p>
   The Japan Automobile Dealers Association will release figures on
new car sales in December at 2 p.m. local time. Sales have slid
eight straight months.
<p>
   Banks fell on investor fears that more companies will go under
following record bankruptcies last year, adding to the 28 trillion
yen ($219.7 billion) in bad loans the nation's lenders already
carry.
<p>
   Sumitomo Bank Ltd. fell 70 yen to 1,420. Sanwa Bank Ltd.
declined 50 yen to 1,270. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. fell
50 yen to 1,260.
<p>
   Fuji Bank Ltd. rose 22 yen, or 4.17 percent, to 550 after a
Japanese newspaper reported on Dec. 31 that the bank would buy back
its own stock this year in order to boost the share price. That
caused investors who had been ready for a price drop to reverse
course and buy shares, traders said. A bank spokesman said Fuji is
mulling a stock buyback but had not yet considered amount or
timing.
<p>
   Fuji Bank's stock price tumbled 70 percent in 1997.
<p>
   Electronics exporters like Omron Corp. rose as investors bet a
weak yen versus the dollar would expand such companies' profits.
<p>
   ``The weak yen will be positive for exporters,'' said Shigeru
Murofushi, manager of the equity department at Dai-Ichi Securities
Co. ``Although that alone isn't enough'' to pull the entire Nikkei
up.
<p>
   The dollar rose to a five-and-a-half-year high of 132.65 yen in
New York trading on Friday, as traders worried that Japan isn't
moving swiftly enough to spur consumer spending or keep more of its
financial institutions from going bankrupt.
<p>
   The dollar recently bought 132.31 yen.
<p>
   A weak yen is good for Japan's exporters, since it makes their
products more competitive overseas and increases earnings when
dollar-denominated profits are brought back home.
<p>
   Traders said gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index on
Friday also boosted Japanese computer-related companies, which are
particularly sensitive to share-price movements of their trading
partners overseas. The Nasdaq gained 11.18, or 0.7 percent, to
1581.53.
<p>
   Sony Corp. rose 200 yen to 11,800. Omron, a maker of automation
equipment, gained 50 yen to 2,090. Tokyo Electron Ltd. climbed 110
yen to 4,290.

<p>
   IRVINE, Calif.  &MD;  The sweepstakes entry packet arrived in the
mail recently, promising an $11 million payoff to the lucky winner.
Cameron Dollar gave it a cursory look, then tossed it aside. Who
needs wealth when you have simple abundance?
<p>
   That Dollar isn't driven by cold cash became clear last summer
when he set aside six overtures in the NBA free-agent sweepstakes
to become an assistant coach at UC Irvine.
<p>
   As the floor general for UCLA in the 1995 NCAA championship game
and the Bruins team that advanced to the Elite Eight two years
later, Dollar seldom made poor decisions. But many of his friends
wondered what Dollar was doing, throwing away his playing career
with plenty of time remaining on his shot clock.
<p>
   Even Dollar's dad, Donald, a longtime high-school coach,
initially challenged the move. He questioned why his son wouldn't
exhaust all his options as a player before following in his
footsteps.
<p>
   Six months later, the answer is glowing on the Anteaters' bench.
Everyone should love his job as much as Dollar, 22, who looks
preternaturally at ease sitting next to head coach Pat Douglass and
assistant coach Len Stevens, both of whom had graduated from
college before Dollar was born.
<p>
   ``Since I was 6 or 7 I've wanted to be a coach even more than a
professional athlete,'' Dollar said. ``When coach Douglass called
and offered me this job, I lost all my passion to play. This is my
dream.''
<p>
   He realizes few elite college players eagerly anticipate the day
when they can break down game film, write letters to recruits and
spend their Saturday nights sitting through games in which the
opposition shoots 26.3 percent, as Sonoma State did in a 51-41 loss
to the Anteaters over the weekend.
<p>
   Rarer still is the athlete with Dollar's credentials who is more
concerned with helping other people develop their skills than he is
honing his own.
<p>
   ``As a player I never felt like I could totally help everyone
around me,'' Dollar said. ``That's why coaching appealed to me. I
kind of felt like you're supposed to play in college and then play
a couple of years in the pros, so it was hard for me at first. I
went against the norm.''
<p>
   Whatever self-consciousness he initially felt dribbling against
the tide has dissipated over time. Indeed, for a college graduate
making slightly more than minimum wage, Dollar seems inordinately
happy.
<p>
   ``You have to have a passion to do this,'' Dollar said, ``You
can't put a price tag on it.''
<p>
   It also helps to shop for patience in bulk. The Anteaters, 1-25
last season, are 3-7 in the first year of Douglass' reign. The
dearth of talent on the floor is exceeded only by the paucity of
people in the stands.
<p>
   Whereas Dollar played in front of 31,390 at the San Antonio
Alamodome in his final game at UCLA, there was an announced crowd
of 724 at the Bren Center for UC Irvine's game against Sonoma
State.
<p>
   The Anteaters beat the Cossacks behind the 14-point, four-assist
performance of a freshman walk-on point guard, Jason Flowers, whom
Dollar has worked with extensively.
<p>
   Later, as he watched Flowers walk by him in the hall outside the
coaches' office, Dollar couldn't have looked any more pleased if he
himself had put up those numbers against his hometown team, the
Atlanta Hawks.
<p>
   ``As a coach you have a lot of influence on all the players,
from the stars to the walk-ons,'' Dollar said. ``I've always wanted
to be in a position where I can impact guys' lives and help them
get better.''
<p>
   Dollar learned at his father's knee the intrinsic value of
coaching. He can remember people constantly stopping his dad in
public to exchange pleasantries, then learning later they were
former players of his. It wasn't lost on Dollar that even people
who were decades removed from their playing days remained close to
his dad.
<p>
   You can't buy that kind of respect, you have to earn it. The
thing that has impressed Douglass about Dollar is how committed he
is to paying his dues.
<p>
   ``He's very special,'' Douglass said. ``A lot of times, kids
who've experienced the kind of success he did aren't as diligent at
first as far as doing grunt work. But he willingly does whatever is
asked of him.''
<p>
   Douglass coaches the way Dollar played; he aims to keep everyone
around him involved. So Douglass often seeks Dollar's input. In the
second half of Saturday's game he turned to Dollar and asked
whether they should go with a smaller lineup to counter Sonoma
State's perimeter shooting.
<p>
   ``That's the greatest thing about being on coach Douglass'
staff,'' Dollar said. ``He'll ask my advice on things and it's not
just something (inconsequential). He makes you feel like you're a
crucial part of what's going on.''
<p>
   Dollar is in charge of conditioning at practice. No wonder the
Anteaters were diving for loose balls and playing tenacious defense
until the final buzzer sounded. Dollar's UCLA career ended with him
on the floor, stretching for another steal in the Bruins' 80-72
loss to Minnesota in the NCAA Tournament.
<p>
   Dollar was used to stretching dollars long before he took this
job, which pays him $20,000. So he doesn't mind living out of a
room in a Newport Beach house and routinely doing without meals.
``Even if I didn't need money at all,'' he said, ``this is what I'd
do.''

 &UR; DOLLAR LITTLE CHANGED VS YEN AMID CONCERN OVER JAPAN'S ECONOMY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar was little changed
against the yen as the Japanese government's efforts to revive the
economy and talk up its currency were not enough to counter concern
that the nation's growth has stalled, traders said.
<p>
   Persistent worry about the weak Japanese economy kept the dollar
from falling. In an effort to bolster the yen, the Bank of Japan
last month sold an estimated $10 billion when the dollar topped 131
yen.
<p>
   ``Traders are cautious that the Bank of Japan may step into the
market again to stem the dollar's rise because the dollar is now
hovering way above the level that the Bank of Japan intervened last
time,'' said Tetsu Aikawa, manager for foreign exchange at Sanwa
Bank ltd. ``The dollar, however, will possibly top 140 yen by June
as intervention alone cannot change the recent weak-yen trend.''
<p>
   The dollar was quoted at 132.20 yen, compared with 132.32 yen in
late New York trading Friday. The dollar was quoted at 1.7976
marks, compared with 1.8025 marks in New York.
<p>
   Haruhiko Kuroda, director general of the Japanese Finance
Ministry's International Finance Bureau, said Japan's ready to act
when necessary to stem the yen's excessive weakness, Reuters news
service reported. The market, however, showed little reaction to
his comment.
<p>
   ``Verbal intervention no longer works,'' said Takayuki Togawa,
manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd. ``Dragging down the
dollar in this manner ended up as just providing a good opportunity
to buy dollars.''
<p>
   Investors and traders have been paying attention to whether
central banks of other countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and
Germany, would join hands with their Japanese counterpart to sell
dollars. So far they've remained on the sidelines.
<p>
   Continued turmoil in Asian currencies has weighed heavily on the
yen, traders said.
<p>
   The Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht plunged
to record lows as slowing economic growth kept investors away from
Southeast Asia. The South Korean won, which plunged 47 percent last
year, also weakened 6.6 percent against the U.S. currency, falling
to 1,706 per dollar.
<p>
   Tumbling currencies and the economic slowdown in Asia will hurt
the yen because Japanese exports to the region will decline and
Asian goods will become cheaper in Japan.
<p>
   ``Weakness in their currencies against the yen makes their
exports more competitive,'' said Tokai Bank's Togawa. ``Asia's
malaise definitely will take a deep toll on the Japanese economy
and its currency.''
<p>
   Shares of Japanese exporters fell today in abbreviated trading
after the New Year's holiday break. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index
fell 301.90 points, or 1.98 percent, to 14,956.84.
<p>
   ``Unless the Japanese government comes up with more effective
measures, anxiety over Japan's economy will continue to weigh on
the yen,'' said Togawa.
<p>
   The yen has fallen since July 4, when it was trading at 113.53
to the dollar, as concern intensified over Japan's economic woes --
an economic slowdown verging on recession, rising bad loans and a
string of major corporate bankruptcies.
<p>
   To turn the situation around, the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party and government have announced a succession of proposals over
recent months.
<p>
   The LDP has proposed measures to help revive consumer spending
and bail out troubled financial institutions. The steps include a
one-time, 2 trillion yen ($15.4 billion) personal income tax cut
and up to 30 trillion yen in public money to buy stock in financial
institutions and protect depositors from bank failures.
<p>
   Still, many traders say the proposals are not effective enough
to spur consumer spending or to prevent more financial institutions
from collapsing.
<p>
   ``These measures may temporarily halt the yen's decline, but
won't contribute to the reversal of the yen's weakness,'' said
Sanwa Bank's Aikawa. ``For the yen to recover, the Japanese
government needs to come up with effective measures to stimulate
the economy.''
<p>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4602 Swiss francs,
compared with 1.4702 Swiss francs in late New York trading Friday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.6441, compared with $1.6450
Friday. The mark was quoted at 73.59 yen, compared with 73.40 yen
in New York.
<p>
   The dollar was little changed against a basket of 10 major
currencies tracked by Finex, a financial futures exchange. The
Finex dollar index was last at 99.82, compared with 100.10 Friday.

   YEAREND-HOTSEAT  &MD;  Perhaps more important to chief executives

   YEAREND-TRAVELCOSTS  &MD;  Because of the strength of the United
States economy, travelers have been filling airplanes and hotel

much as 7 percent in 1998, several percentage points more than the
current general inflation rate. By Edwin McDowell.
<p>
   YEAREND-EURO (Frankfurt, Germany)  &MD;  Absent a huge political or
economic calamity, the European single currency, the euro, will
make its debut on Jan 1, 1999. Banks have begun overhauling their
computer systems, and many big companies are already making plans
for the switch. But the magnitude of the transformation is only
beginning to sink in, particularly for the small and medium-sized
companies that make up the backbone of the European economy. By
Edmund L. Andrews.
<p>
   YEAREND-EUROPOLITICS (Paris)  &MD;  When European Union leaders meet
on the first weekend in May to decide which of their countries
qualify to start phasing in a common currency in 1999, they will be
making a monumental political decision as well as a monetary one.
By Craig R. Whitney.
<p>
   YEAREND-CHINA (Shanghai, China)  &MD;  The numbers look good. It's
what they hide that is not so pretty. China's economy is still
bustling along at high speed, growing 8.8 percent in 1997 and
expected to increase nearly as fast in 1998. It is almost as though
China were operating in a different hemisphere from that of its
Asian neighbors who are now engulfed by financial meltdown. By Seth
Faison.
<p>
   YEAREND-ASIA (Bangkok, Thailand)  &MD;  In a new ritual of Thailand's
hard times, people who call themselves the ``formerly rich'' have
been gathering every weekend in a carnival atmosphere to sell their
status symbols: expensive cars, designer clothing, thousand-dollar
watches, even a light airplane. A look at Thailand as an example of
Asia's woes. By Seth Mydans. (With graphic.)
<p>
   YEAREND-JAPAN (Tokyo)  &MD;  A decade from now, 1998 may be
remembered as the Year of Reckoning for Japan. By Stephanie Strom.
<p>
   YEAREND-BRAZIL (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)  &MD;  To foreign investors,
Brazil's president became a hero in 1997 when he responded to
market turbulence by taking painful measures to bolster the
nation's fiscal soundness and to stave off a collapse of the
currency. But the same steps that were cheered overseas are
expected to boomerang against him at home. A Latin American
overview, focusing on Brazil. By Diana Jean Schemo.
<p>
   YEAREND-TELECOM  &MD;  There was a time when following the
telecommunications industry meant following the actual business of
telecommunications. Those days, like rotary telephones, are long

is facing another sluggish year with hopes that high technology

relief. By Doreen Carvajal.
<p>
   YEAREND-NEWSPAPERS  &MD;  Surveys of newspaper readers often show
that they think papers are run by sourpusses who live only to print
bad news. Those readers might be surprised to see how downright
cheerful and sunny most editors and publishers have been lately
about their industry's money-making performance in 1997. By Iver
Peterson.
<p>
   YEAREND-STOCK-PREDICT  &MD;  In the 1990s, the performance of the
American stock market has been nothing short of amazing,
particularly in the last three years. Over that stretch, investors
in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index have seen their money more
than double. That had never happened before in so short a period.
Much of that performance has come from demographics. But the stock
market's outstanding performance reflects more than demographic
levitation. By Floyd Norris.

   YEAREND-MUTFUND  &MD;  The mutual fund industry just finished its

after three straight years of torrid growth, Americans show few
signs of slowing down in their drive to accumulate assets for

   YEAREND-GLOBAL-OUTLOOK (Washington)  &MD;  For 1998 one question that

Sanger.
<p>
   YEAREND-BANKS  &MD;  Bankers used to inhabit a staid, predictable
world, one marked by a golf-course-like serenity that was
occasionally interrupted by their proclivity for making
extraordinarily bad loans. While bad lending habits persist,
banking is no longer a chummy stroll around the links. Banks are
now under siege from a host of new competitors. By Timothy L.
O'Brien.

<p>
   YEAREND-IRS  &MD;  Americans have long complained about abuses by the
Internal Revenue Service. Taking aim at an easy target, in 1997
Washington finally did something about the complaints: With the
reluctant support of President Clinton, the House passed, 426 to 4,
a ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights,'' setting the stage for what is likely
to be an equally lopsided vote in the Senate in 1998. By Peter
Passell.
<p>
   YEAREND-TAXCODE  &MD;  The Republicans and the Democrats have
signaled that this year they are set to repeat the performances
that led to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Unfortunately for
taxpayers, that legislation has been described by many experts as a
badly drafted mess that, while paying lip service to simplicity and
fairness, actually adds complexity and creates burdens for many
people, especially those with modest incomes. By David Cay
Johnston. (With graphic.)

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Dan Esch was asleep in his basement apartment early
Friday morning when his roommate said something about a flood. He
opened his eyes and saw his cat's litter box floating through the
bedroom with the cat inside. Books, shoes and a pair of pants were
floating, too.
<p>
   ``Everything was bobbing around in this muddy, mucky water,''
said Esch, who lives on West 19th Street, less than a block from
the spot on Fifth Avenue where a water main ruptured before dawn on
Friday. ``I had a lot of cleaning up to do.''
<p>
   He was not the only one. As emergency workers hurried to repair
the century-old 48-inch main and reconnect utility lines along
Fifth Avenue on Sunday, dozens of residents and business owners
assessed the damage and continued the muck-removal that kept them
busy all weekend.
<p>
   Never hesitant to proclaim New York's superiority, even in
disasters, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani snapped photographs at the site
on Sunday and called it fascinating.
<p>
   He said a lot of work had yet to be done and invited New Yorkers
to come inspect the broken pipe, the 30-foot-long sinkhole the
break created and the tangle of wires it exposed.
<p>
   ``It's actually a remarkable thing to see, to get to see what it
looks like underneath a crowded New York City street,'' Giuliani
said. ``The complexity of that  &MD;  I think it's greater than the
complexity of the human body.''
<p>
   Although most water, gas, sewer, electricity and telephone
service had been restored by Sunday afternoon, people like Esch
said their lives were hardly back to normal.
<p>
   At 7 West 19th Street, Peter Taylor clucked as rubber-booted
workers marched into the basement offices of his wife's business, A
Better Tax Service. Taylor spent Saturday airing out computers and
mopping the hardwood floors, which he said would have to be
refinished. He and his wife, Sherry Jacobson, found out about the
ruptured water main from firefighters who pounded on the door of
their apartment, above the office, on Friday at 5:30 a.m.
<p>
   Taylor, who had emigrated from Northern Ireland, said the damage
was similar to that caused by bombs in his home country. ``It
looked as if a bomb had gone off out there,'' he said. ``I think we
probably were one of the lucky ones in terms of damage.''
<p>
   City officials said only five buildings along Fifth Avenue
remained without electricity on Sunday night, and a spokesman for
Consolidated Edison said five buildings remained without gas. A
spokesman for Bell Atlantic said telephone service had been
restored to the approximately 100 customers who had reported
problems.
<p>
   About 30 residents and 12 business owners were still not allowed
to return.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  The parishioners of St. Philip Neri Roman Catholic
Church stood shoulder to shoulder in June and wept. Octogenarian
descendants of Italian immigrants and teen-agers from the Dominican
Republic watched in horror as flames consumed their century-old
church in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx.
<p>
   Six months later, the majestic arches of a new roof are
sprouting from a maze of construction scaffolding inside the
church's sanctuary. To the delight of St. Philip Neri officials,
more than $700,000 of the $1 million needed to reconstruct the
historic building already lies in church coffers.
<p>
   Donations from former parishioners, graduates of the church's
elementary school, other churches and sympathetic strangers have
poured in from across the city, the region and the world.
Contributions ranging from a crumpled dollar bill to a corporate
check for $100,000 have arrived continually at the 3,000-member
church since the fire, which was caused by an electrical spark on
June 15.
<p>
   Parishioners said the donations have been the most tangible part
of a series of unexpected blessings that have emerged from the
disaster. They say a parish that was undergoing subtle cultural
strains has grown closer.
<p>
   ``The night of the fire we were all out there  &MD;  different ages,
different races, different nationalities,'' said Mirtha Cuevas, 49,
an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. ``For the first time,
these people that were not Latinos I felt were my brothers.''
<p>
   Following the rhythms of immigration that have long governed the
city, the church, whose congregation was once overwhelmingly of
Italian and Irish descent, is now more than half Hispanic. The most
heavily attended Mass at St. Philip Neri is in Spanish.
<p>
   Parishioners said the drive to rebuild the church, which was
built by Italian laborers in 1899, has created a sense of
commonality in the parish of elderly Italians and Irish and young
Latinos, blacks and Koreans.
<p>
   John Savacione, a retired Italian-American artist and a St.
Philip Neri parishioner for 30 years, said a sense of unity has
risen from the fire's ashes. ``It was like when you lose a loved
one,'' he said. ``Immediately, everyone flocked together. I think
we're stronger now than before the fire.''
<p>
   Ms. Cuevas, Savacione and Msgr. Kevin Colleran, the pastor who
has led the church for the last decade, said the church's sense of
community comes from its history. In the late 1890s, Italian
immigrants who worked as laborers in the construction of the Jerome
Park Reservoir were eager for a house of worship of their own.
<p>
   After toiling all day at the reservoir, the immigrants
constructed the church at night. Chunks of bedrock unearthed as the
reservoir was deepened were hauled by carriage to the church site
at 3025 Grand Concourse, near 202nd Street, and used to construct
its distinctive walls. In 1899, an elegant, T-shaped church, its
facade dominated by a belfry with three bells, was completed.
<p>
   For decades, parishioners like 82-year-old Tom Stedina, who
became a member of the congregation in 1946, raised their families
with the spiritual guidance of the church. Children were baptized
and married where grandparents were mourned and laid to rest. In
1968, a future mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, wed his first wife, Regina
Peruggi, there. (The marriage was later annulled.)
<p>
   In the 1970s, neighborhood advocates used the church as an
organizing center in a drive to prevent the arsonists who were
incinerating stretches of the South Bronx from reaching Bedford
Park. The organizers built a coalition of tenant and block
associations that spanned more than 100 buildings, and the flames
never reached the neighborhood.
<p>
   But flames did reach the church in June, sparked by an
electrical short in a basement fuse box, according to Colleran. ``I
was just happy it wasn't arson or something stupid we did
ourselves,'' he said.
<p>
   Services are now being held in the basement, the only section of
the church that was spared. The slate roof burned and collapsed in
the fire, the sanctuary was gutted, the organ and its pipes were
ruined, the stained glass was shattered and a painting of Our Lady
of Guadalupe was destroyed. The marble altar and statues of the
Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ survived the flames.
<p>
   Colleran hopes to reopen the church by Christmas, allowing
parishioners to celebrate the church's centennial in a
reconstructed building a year from now.
<p>
   Ms. Cuevas said that the church's leaders have always made her
feel welcome, but that she thought the neighborhood has not greeted
its growing Mexican and Dominican population ``with open arms.''
The fire, she said, changed that dynamic.
<p>
   ``The Italians and the Irish built the church and I have had the
privilege of enjoying it,'' she said. ``Now I have a chance to
contribute to the rebuilding of it. I finally feel that something
belongs to me.''

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Sunday was a day made for strolling or bicycling
outdoors, but for those of a different bent, it was a day to wait
in line for a few hours in the hope of coming away with a bit of
cosmic wisdom.
<p>
   Inside the Asia Society was a Tibetan sand mandala called the
Kalachakra: the Wheel of Time. It consisted of ring after
shimmering ring of concentric circles surrounding squares within
squares. It was about four feet square and made entirely of
fine-grained sand. No adhesives were used.
<p>
   It was made with tiny funnels, and included patterns of shells,
lotus petals and ornamental wheels. Its colors had a gemlike
brilliance and its design an almost unbelievable intricacy and
precision. Staring at it, one could almost see its flaming circles
whirl and its squares rise into a many-storied palace.
<p>
   Three Tibetan monks from the Namgyal Monastery in Ithaca, N.Y.,
spent three weeks this fall, working 18-hour days, to create it, as
part of an exhibition on mandalas. The people waiting in line came
to see them destroy it.
<p>
   The mandala represents the universe, from the outer reaches of
space to the intricacies of the mind. Its destruction symbolizes
the impermanence of life.
<p>
   ``It is a kind of meditation,'' said the Venerable Tenzin
Yignyen, the leader of the three monks. ``It takes strong
concentration.''
<p>
   Crowded into the small museum were nearly 1,000 people, far more
than the society's director had expected, making it as tightly
packed as a rush-hour subway train. Only 100 were permitted to
watch the ceremonious destruction.
<p>
   ``I was a little concerned that might be some trouble,'' because
of the many people pressing outside the door to get in, said
Vishakha Desai, the gallery director.
<p>
   The viewers included people who had only recently acquired an
interest in Tibet, from news or movies, as well as those who had
studied Buddhism for decades. They all heard Yignyen's short talk
about death and living with compassion.
<p>
   Then, after Yignyen drew lines in the sand, he invited children
to smear the red, blue, black, white, orange and pink sand, using
foam spatulas, creating mud-colored heaps. The sand was to be
thrown into the East River, where it would bring blessings to the
water and fish.
<p>
   Many of those who observed the ceremony came away with
philosophical thoughts.
<p>
   ``We exist for only a little while,'' said Charles Andersen, 33,
a museum curator. ``We have to appreciate that.''
<p>
   ``It's a little shocking,'' said Tania Sterl, 25, a fashion
designer. ``All that work and they just cleared it away. But I
guess it means letting go. I guess that's one of life's lessons.''
