<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- George Washington University
must have one heck of a math department. Consider what the
government describes as the much-sought-after talents of Robert
Daniel Idzi.
<p>
   Idzi, who graduated from GW in 1991, is one of two stock brokers
indicted Jan. 8 by the Manhattan District Attorney. Their alleged
crime: working as stand-ins for people who anticipated they were
too dumb to pass the Series 7 brokers' exam -- which tests
everything from securities law to basic math.
<p>
   The other indicted broker, Igor Sheckhtman, hails from the
University of California at Los Angeles -- another institute of
higher learning that may deserve a little credit for cranking out
an achievement test whiz-kid, should the case be solid.
<p>
   To get a good job, as your mother always told you, get a good
education.
<p>
   Not that there aren't noteworthy non-academic credentials on
their resumes, as listed in their regulatory records. Sheckhtman's
past includes a 10-year tenure working for Los Angeles Checkered
Cab Co., where he must have logged a lot of time calculating bond
yields at stop signs and red lights.
<p>
   Idzi also had an affinity for the transportation industry,
though he apparently was more inclined to desk jobs. Between 1985
and 1991 he worked at five different auto parts and distribution
companies. He also did a five-month stint at Korbean International
Investment Corp., shut down in February by the New York State
Attorney General's office.
<p>
   A compliance officer At Sunpoint Securities, Idzi's most recent
employer, said he hasn't known of Idzi's whereabouts since he set
Idzi up to two years ago to be stung by the National Association of
Securities Dealers. There was no telephone listing for Idzi in
Alexandria, Virginia, where his NASD records list him as living.
<p>
   There was no listing for Sheckhtman in Encino, Calif. M. Rimson
&AMP; Co., his most recent employer, was expelled from the NASD in
March.
<p>
   If it's true, as the district attorney says, that the
test-takers profited at the expense of less mentally gifted
broker-hopefuls, the two certainly picked their customers and
colleagues from a curious mailing list.
<p>
   John Corona, accused of being a middleman between impostors and
would-be-brokers, pleaded guilty in 1994 to a charge of
unauthorized use of an automobile -- a charge that was reduced from
attempted grand larceny, third degree, and possession of burglary
tools. A compliance officer for Toluca Pacific Securities, where
regulatory records list him as having worked, did not return a
telephone call. There was no telephone listing under Corona's name
in Howard Beach, New York, where records kept at the National
Association of Securities Dealers list him as living.
<p>
   Indeed, more often than not, there was no sign of the accused
brokers in the locales listed in their NASD records. ``In a lot of
cases, they move and don't tell us where they've gone,'' says
Michael Robinson, spokesman for NASD Regulation Inc.
<p>
   William Battista, accused of paying to have someone else take
his test, paid a fine in 1996 related to assault charges that were
dropped. Earlier, in 1992, he pleaded guilty to promotion of
gambling, a talent Wall Street may reward, but for which the Series
7 test apparently doesn't screen.
<p>
   You'll never guess. No telephone listed in his name at the New
York City address he filed with the NASD. A woman answering the
telephone at Euro-Atlantic Securities in New York said that
Battista worked at that office, but was not in on Jan. 17.
<p>
   Another alleged user of a stand-in, John D'Esposito, pleaded
guilty in 1991 to petty larceny after initial charges of criminal
possession of a loaded firearm, according to his regulatory
records. A man reached at the telephone number listed under the
same Staten Island, New York, address on D'Esposito's NASD records
said that while his name was John D'Esposito, he was not the John
D'Esposito who had been cited by the D.A.
<p>
   The criminal records go on and on. But enough of that. The gang
of 53 charged as part of a cheating ring weren't all on the dockets
of the Department of Justice. Some just had more than their share
of old-fashioned investor complaints. And big-ticket complaints, at
that.
<p>
   Darian Kelty of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, settled a $75,000
customer complaint for unauthorized trading and other allegations
for $24,500; Jack Biondolillo of Scottsdale, Arizona, was accused
of bilking a customer of $332,900 in a case that alleged
misrepresentation, among other things. He had no listing in
Scottsdale, where -- you guessed it -- NASD records list him as
living. A compliance officer for Russo Securities said she withdrew
his broker's registration application after learning of the
indictment.
<p>
   Paul Cilmi, who has an unpublished telephone number in Brooklyn,
lost an arbitration in which the complaining investor was awarded
$71,491.
<p>
   Michael Cilmi, whose phone in South Cairo, New York, went
unanswered, was co-defendant in that case against Paul Cilmi. His
regulatory records show that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
December of 1988, a period when he was working for the New York
City Department of Corrections.
<p>
   From there, he moved on to the Department of Sanitation before a
career switch to Wall Street, where he no doubt had a better shot
at making enough dough to pay off his debts. Stock brokers can be
groomed in the darnedest places.

<p>
   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Argentine stocks may rise
as high demand for the country's biggest-ever bond sale reassures
investors the government will be able to cover this year's
financing needs.
<p>
   Demand for the $2 billion of 20-year bonds on sale today totaled
$6 billion ``ensuring that there should be plenty of interest in
future sales,'' said Hugo Dias Lourenco, an equity strategist at
consulting firm C&AMP;E Consultores.
<p>
   The high level of demand also shows that foreign investors are
confident Argentina's economy will continue to improve and they're
prepared to put money into the country in the search for higher
returns, added Dias Lourenco.
<p>
   ``There should be a big inflow of funds in coming months and a
good part of this should go into the stock market,'' said Dias
Lourenco.
<p>
   This could help lift the Merval index to 750 pesos by the end of
February, added Dias Lourenco. That would be 9 percent more than
the Merval's 686.1 close yesterday.
<p>
   Prospects of robust economic growth and rising corporate
earnings have helped boost the Merval by 40 percent since August.
<p>
   The increase was also helped by low U.S. bond yields which
caused foreign investors to seek higher returns in emerging equity
markets such as Argentina.
<p>
   The economy officially is forecast to expand by about 5 percent
this year following growth of between 3 percent and 4 percent in
1996.
<p>
   Dias Lourenco said he is recommending shares of companies that
are likely to increase sales as consumer spending grows over coming
months.
<p>
   These include steel companies, such as Acindar Industria
Argentina de Aceros SA, and auto manufacturers Ciadea SA and Sevel
Argentina SA.
<p>
   Yesterday, stocks rose after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan allayed fears that the Fed could increase interest rates
next month in order to rein in inflation. Greenspan told the Senate
Budget Committee the U.S. economy ``retained considerable vigor,
with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that
have disrupted past expansions.''
<p>
   The Merval index of the 24 most-traded stocks closed unchanged
at 686.61 while the general index rose 0.16 percent to 19,796.24.
Of the 85 issues that were traded, 40 rose, 20 fell and 25 closed
unchanged. Turnover rose to 23.5 million pesos ($23.5 million) of
shares from Monday's 9.6 million pesos. Among stocks that are
widely traded abroad, telephone company Telefonica de Argentina SA
closed unchanged at 2.88 pesos while Telecom Argentina Stet-France
Telecom SA, another phone company, fell 0.43 percent to 4.54 pesos.
<p>
   Oil producer YPF SA closed unchanged at 28.1 pesos.
<p>
   The interest rate on seven-day interbank deposits rose to 5.7
percent from 5.6 percent on Monday while the peso traded at 0.9992
to the U.S. dollar compared with 0.9993 the previous day.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Apple Computer Inc. posted a loss of $120
million for its first quarter Wednesday and said that it does not
expect to return to profitability as quickly as it had predicted,
with the first positive earnings not anticipated until the fourth
quarter in September.
<p>
   Separately, Sun Microsystems Inc., which a year ago entertained
the prospect of acquiring Apple, reported record revenues and
earnings for its second quarter, exceeding analyst estimates.
<p>
   Both companies released their results after the stock market had
closed. In Nasdaq trading, Apple shares fell 62.5 cents, to $17.25;
Sun shares also slipped 62.5 cents, to $28.25. In after-hours
trading, though, Sun traded as high as $28.75, while Apple shares
were unchanged.
<p>
   Earlier this month, Apple said it expected a loss of between
$100 million and $150 million in the quarter, far higher than
analysts had estimated. Wednesday's reported loss of $120 million
was equivalent to 96 cents a share, much more than the average
analyst estimate of 75 cents, according to First Call, though still
within the range of 48 cents to $1.20 among the 19 analysts
surveyed.
<p>
   Apple attributed the loss to weak Christmas-season sales of its
Performa line of consumer-oriented Macintosh computers, and the
price cuts and rebates needed to move these machines.
<p>
   In addition, Apple was unable to make enough of its new
Powerbook 1400 notebook computers to meet demand, resulting in a
backlog of $200 million. Though Apple had posted a surprise profit
in its fourth quarter, much of that came from an adjustment of
restructuring charges taken in the previous quarter.
<p>
   In reaction to the earnings and Apple's continued poor
performance, Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. Wednesday lowered Apple's
corporate credit rating and senior debt rating to B from B+, and
its subordinated debt rating to CCC+ from B-.
<p>
   S&AMP;P said that the new ratings reflected Apple's operating
losses, slipping market share and the need to revamp the company.
Apple officials have said they will cut costs so that the company
can break even on annual revenue of $8 billion, down from an
earlier target of $9 billion.
<p>
   But Apple officials said Wednesday that despite the challenges,
the company remained on track to a recovery. ``While we were very
disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss,
our financial position remains sound,'' Fred Anderson, Apple's
executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in a
telephone conference call.
<p>
   ``We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued
to show improvements in our inventory management,'' he said.
<p>
   For the quarter, Apple reported a loss of $120 million, compared
with a loss of $69 million in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues of $2.13 billion were down 32 percent from the $3.15
billion reported in the first quarter of the 1996 fiscal year.
<p>
   ``The quarter wasn't as bad as I though it would be,'' said
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with CS First Boston, noting that
holiday sales were disappointing for nearly all consumer computer
makers.
<p>
   Apple primarily spoke of weakness in the Performa line, but
strong sales of Macintosh clones may have come at the expense of
the company's high-end models, Wolf said.
<p>
   ``My guess is they took at least $100 million off revenues, and
possibly $150 million, which is not insignificant vis-a-vis the
shortfall,'' he said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Apple's financial woes have diverted attention from the
company's surprise acquisition of Next Software Inc. and the return
of a co-founder, Steven Jobs.
<p>
   But Ellen Hancock, Apple's chief technology officer, said in a
conference call that she was confident Apple would deliver new
operating system software incorporating Next's technology this
year. She said that an advance release for software developers
would be available midyear, with a customer release by the end of
the year.
<p>
   In contrast to Apple, which is suffering partly from a lack of
exciting new technology and partly from an inability to execute,
Sun is riding high on hot new products and delivering them
flawlessly. Sun's mainstay products, work stations and servers, are
still in the growth phase that began with the introduction of the
Ultrasparc line last year, while its new network computer, the
Javastation, has just begun to ship.
<p>
   ``The team is psyched; they're pretty focused,'' Scott McNealy,
Sun's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a conference
call. ``Our servers and power desktop systems are hot; customers
need the superior scalability, reliability and performance of our
products.''
<p>
   For the quarter, Sun had earnings of $178.3 million, or 46 cents
a share, up 41 percent from $126 million, or 32 cents a share, in
the period a year earlier. That exceeded the average analyst
estimate, according to First Call, of 42 cents a share. Per-share
figures reflect a recent 2-for-1 stock split. Sales of $2.08
billion were up nearly 19 percent.
<p>
   ``This was a really great quarter,'' said Doug van Dorsten, an
analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, who noted that Sun was able to meet
its operating profit goals early and effectively deferred some
sales into its third quarter.
<p>
   He said that Sun had gained market share at the expense of
rivals like Silicon Graphics Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. ``More
and more, you're seeing applications that historically ran on
Silicon Graphics going to Sun,'' he said.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell as
International Business Machines Corp.'s lower-than- expected profit
damped optimism that earnings can live up to expectations.
<p>
   IBM tumbled 12 3/8 to 155 5/8, sending the Dow Jones Industrial
Average down 71.97 to 6811.93.
<p>
   The drop triggered the New York Stock Exchange's ``uptick'' rule
at 9:50 a.m. Eastern time. The rule is triggered when the Dow
average drops 50 to curb some computer-guided trades.
<p>
   IBM said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent, slightly less
than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hurt
results. Net income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3
cents below analysts' expectations.
<p>
   ``They had some trouble in Europe,'' said analyst Bruce Raabe of
Collins &AMP; Co. ``And hardware sales were the weakest story.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at Compaq Computer Corp. The
Houston-based computer maker said earnings gained 43 percent, to
$1.64 a share, surpassing expectations by 11 cents.
<p>
   Compaq rose 1 7/8 to 80 3/8.
<p>
   ``With the exception of IBM, so far the earnings look pretty
good,'' Cardillo said.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a
share, 2 cents above analysts' expectations, according to IBES
International Inc. It rose 3/4 to 122.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, also topping forecasts. Shares
rose 1/8 to 37 1/4.
<p>
   Adding to the case that the economy is expanding without
inflationary pressures, the Commerce Department reported that
starts of new U.S. housing dropped a larger-than-expected 12.2
percent in December.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profits rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. Its shares lost 1/8 to 39 1/4.
<p>
   Yesterday the Dow industrials set their fourth consecutive
record, the 10th this year, rising 40.03 to 6883.90. Reports of
strong profits fueled the rise.
<p>
   Still, with the Dow industrials up 6.36 percent already this
year, ``investors are more sensitive to news that's unfavorable
than news that's favorable,'' said Philip Roth, chief technical
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
<p>
   Overseas markets were higher. In Japan, stocks jumped 3.78
percent to 18013.88 In London, the FTSE-100 gained 0.45 percent.

 &UR; AMERICA ONLINE FACES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRICING PLAN &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) -- America Online Inc. is facing
questions from a group of state consumer-protection agencies over
the delays and mechanical problems caused by the online provider's
new flat-rate pricing plan.
<p>
   Attorneys general in Wisconsin, New York and other states are
looking into subscriber complaints of access problems since AOL
began offering unlimited service for a flat rate of $19.95 a month.
Previously, users paid $9.95 for the first five hours and $2.95 for
each additional hour.
<p>
   ``New York is looking into this because there have been lots of
complaints,'' said Margot Pagan, a spokeswoman for New York
Attorney General Dennis Vacco. ``It's very hard to take real world
law and apply it and enforce it in a virtual world.''
<p>
   Some states have begun discussions with AOL over complaints that
the new policy, which took effect Dec. 1, is causing traffic jams,
according to Jim Haney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin attorney
general's office. He said that Wisconsin was among those states.
<p>
   Haney said Wisconsin officials have received about 20 written
complaints in the last week.
<p>
   Private Lawsuits
<p>
   America Online also is facing several private lawsuits by
disgruntled customers who say the company reneged on its promise to
provide them with efficient on-line service. Complaints filed in
Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York say that customers have had
trouble connecting with AOL since the company switched to the new
pricing plan.
<p>
   Suits and probes have become almost routine for the nation's
largest and fastest-growing online provider, which now has more
than 7 million subscribers.
<p>
   In December, it reached a 19-state settlement over its plan to
automatically switch subscribers to the new pricing plan. And in
July, it agreed to pay $22 million to settle 11 private
class-action suits about billing and business practices. The
Federal Trade Commission, the nation's top consumer-protection
agency, also has been examining the company's practices as part of
an industry-wide probe.
<p>
   People ``are taking advantage of the situation,'' said Abhishek
Gami, a Nesbitt Burns analyst. ``I can't believe they are being
hurt by waiting in line. AOL is doing a good job of building out
the network and keeping individuals informed.''
<p>
   AOL shares fell 1 1/2 today to close at 38. Delays Reported
<p>
   Since the new pricing plan took effect, subscribers have
suffered delays and technical problems when trying to log onto AOL.
The problem was compounded when the company began offering 50 free
online hours to lure new users.
<p>
   America Online officials had warned users that the new pricing
plan could cause delays for a few months during its busiest hours,
from 8 p.m. to midnight and on weekends. The new pricing plan
charges subscribers $19.95 a month whether or not they can get into
it, leading users annoyed with the delays to seek refunds.
<p>
   The private suits charge AOL with breach of contract, negligence
and consumer fraud. Each seeks class-action status, so the company
might be able to resolve the claims in one setting, rather than in
several different courts.
<p>
   AOL says it expects to win the suits, though it understands the
frustrations of its customers. ``We had a fall surge that ate up a
lot of our capacity,'' said America Online spokeswoman Tricia
Primrose. She said AOL subscribers have almost tripled their online
time in the last three months -- from 1.6 million hours per day in
October to as much as 4.3 million hours per day now.
<p>
   That increase has strained the network's capacity, even as AOL
embarks on a $250 million project to expand the system. That
expansion, Primrose said, should solve the access problems when
it's completed in June.
<p>
   From the time it was announced in October, the pricing plan came
under fire. Attorneys general from 17 states sent the company a
letter saying that switching users without giving them a choice may
violate deceptive trade practice laws.
<p>
   To settle these concerns, America Online agreed to flash a
message on users' computer screens letting them choose between the
new and old plans. This quelled concerns that those who normally
spend $9.95 for five hours or less online would see their bills
more than double even if usage stayed the same.
<p>
   The Dulles, Virginia-based company also agreed to give refunds
to all AOL users who ask to get switched back to the old pricing
plan by April 10.
<p>
   America Online also had problems with its previous billing plan.
Last July, it agreed to pay as much as $22 million in free online
time to settle 11 private class-action lawsuits about its billing
and business practices. Those suits charged the online service with
misleading consumers by rounding off time spent online to the next
full minute and sometimes billing subscribers for time spent
browsing in so-called ``free'' areas.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Softbank Corp.'s Ziff-Davis
Publishing Co. said it will expand ZDNet, its Internet service that
supplies information about computing and technology, by launching
10 local-language international editions.
<p>
   ZDNet debuted a site for Chinese computer users today, and plans
to launch additional sites in Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, Korea,
Malaysia/Singapore, Russia, Spain and Taiwan in March; and Japan in
April.
<p>
   The expansion comes as ZD Net increasingly attracts computer
users from overseas, enabling them to access news, features,
reviews and information directories. The new sites will be in the
local language and provide localized content.
<p>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of demand for international
content in the local language and with local content that isn't
being served yet,'' J.B. Holston, president of Ziff-Davis'
international division, said in an interview.
<p>
   About 35 percent of ZDNet's 8.89 million visits in November came
from computer users outside of the U.S., according to market
researcher I/Pro.
<p>
   Holston said the markets ZDNet will cover represent about 80
percent of all computer sales around the world. That will make ZD
Net attractive to advertisers, who ``like to able to talk
globally,'' he said.
<p>
   Each local edition will feature Ziff-Davis' ZDNet software
library, which contains 10,000 title that users can download onto
their own computers. The sites will also have information on buying
computing equipment.
<p>
   Ziff-Davis is teaming up with local content partners who ``will
put up the bulk of the investment'' to launch the sites, Holston
said. The editions will be operated both by the local partners and
by workers at ZDNet's Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters.
<p>
   The Chinese ZDNet site will be linked to another site in China
being launched by a venture between Australia's News Corp. and
People's Daily newspaper. News Corp. today said it introduced the
Chinese-language news and information site, called ChinaByte.
<p>
   Users of ChinaByte seeking Internet-related information and news
will be linked to ZDNet under a licensing agreement between the
News Corp. venture and Ziff-Davis, Holston said.

 &UR; DIGITAL EQUIPMENT'S PROFIT FALLS LESS THAN EXPECTED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Gerard Meuchner &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Maynard, Massachusetts, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Digital Equipment
Corp. reported a smaller-than-expected drop in fiscal
second-quarter profit, providing shareholders some measure of hope
after the company lost money in five of the past six years.
<p>
   Maynard, Massachusetts-based Digital had fiscal second-quarter
net income of $31.9 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with net
income of $148.8 million, or 91 cents, a year ago.
<p>
   Revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 28 fell 15 percent to $3.36
billion from $3.95 billion in the year-ago quarter. In the fiscal
first quarter, revenue totaled $2.91 billion.
<p>
   The profit was driven by lower costs, a rebound in revenue, and
an end to losses in its personal computer business. All that isn't
enough for analysts and investors to conclude that Digital has
turned the corner in an industry becoming ever more competitive.
<p>
   ``One of the issues here is consistency,'' said Morgan Stanley
analyst Steven Milunovich. ``I'm not inclined to do anything on one
quarter's numbers. It's a good first step.''
<p>
   Wall Street expected Digital to earn 10 cents a share, according
to the average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call. The
estimates ranged from a loss of 4 cents to a profit of 37 cents.
Sales were expected to fall to about $3.3 billion.
<p>
   The smaller-than-expected decline in profit may not do much to
mollify investors in the nation's third largest computer company.
<p>
   ``The company should be doing so much better than that,'' said
John Rutledge, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., a Boston money
management firm that owns just more than 1 million Digital shares.
``That's not evidence of a turnaround.''
<p>
   Some are more optimistic.
<p>
   ``The results looked encouraging,'' said Salomon Brothers
analyst John Jones. ``The fact that they made some money in PCs is
a positive.''
<p>
   Digital Chairman Robert Palmer ``has got some challenges on his
hands, but he's making progress,'' said Jones, who has a ``buy''
recommendation on the stock.
<p>
   Digital's stock, down 43 percent last year, fell 3/4 yesterday
to 34 1/4.
<p>
   The company's gross margin widened to 32.9 percent in the
quarter, from 32.6 percent a year ago and 31.3 percent in the prior
quarter. Expenses totaled $1.07 billion in the quarter, a 6 percent
decline from a year ago.
<p>
   Digital didn't specify how much money its PC business made, or
divulge the sales related to its flagship Alpha chip, one of the
world's fastest microprocessors.
<p>
   The company's revenue tumbled in the fiscal first quarter after
Digital chose to sell more of its machines through its own sales
force, relying less on distributors. Digital blamed the change for
the 11 percent revenue plunge in the first quarter.
<p>
   The company's sales haven't returned to where they were before
the change.
<p>
   Product revenue in the second quarter was $1.84 billion, down 22
percent from a year ago. The gross margin on product sales widened
to 34.5 percent from 32.5 percent a year ago.
<p>
   Service revenue fell 6 percent to $1.51 billion from $1.6
billion, while the gross margin narrowed to 30.9 percent from 32.7
percent.
<p>
   Digital also cut 1,100 jobs in the quarter, reducing its payroll
to 55,900, less than half the 125,000 employees the company had in
the late 1980s.

 &UR; America Online Asks Customers to Curtail Their Use &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   America Online, the nation's largest online service company,
yesterday acknowledged it is unable to provide reliable service to
its 8 million customers and pleaded with them to scale back their
use until it can fix the problem.
<p>
   The unusual request by AOL chief executive Steve Case came as
AOL grappled with system outages, a flood of customer complaints
and lawsuits by disgruntled users who have experienced difficulty
logging onto the overloaded system.
<p>
   In an apologetic letter to customers, Case wrote: `I know that
you may have had great difficulty connecting to AOL in recent
weeks, so I wanted to let you know what we're doing to address the
problem.''
<p>
   AOL said it will spend up to $350 million on new equipment and
personnel to ease the crunch caused by a surge in use since
December 1, when the company began charging $19.95 a month for
unlimited online time.
<p>
   ``There's also something you can do to help,'' Case wrote, ``and
that is to moderate your own use of AOL a bit during our peak
evening periods. During this transitional period, it would be
helpful if you were sensitive to the needs and frustrations of your
fellow members.
<p>
   ``Just as you would be sensitive about using a public phone
booth if others were waiting in line to use it, it would be helpful
if you could be considerate of the needs of other members of the
AOL community.''
<p>
   Dulles, Va.-based AOL said it has added 1 million members in the
past six weeks. Since September, customers of the fast-growing
service have more than doubled their average daily use, e-mail
messages have doubled to 18 million pieces a day, and total online
time for all users has nearly tripled to 125 million hours.
<p>
   The surge in use has overtaxed AOL's computer system, which can
handle only up to 260,000 users simultaneously. A hardware glitch
on Wednesday caused AOL to partially shut down from 12:15 p.m. to 4
p.m.
<p>
   ``It's an all-you-can-eat online system, but too many people are
lining up at the table,'' said Paul Saunders, an analyst at Van
Kasper &AMP; Co. in San Francisco and an occasional AOL user. ``(AOL)
didn't anticipate this spike in increased use.''
<p>
   Yesterday, AOL said it is scrambling to expand its system
capacity. The company will break ground next month on an
180,000-square-foot data center in Reston, Va.
<p>
   In addition, 600 new customer support employees will be added
over the next six months.
<p>
   The company also is jettisoning its ``Jetsons'' television
commercials and will sharply reduce mailings of free computer
diskettes loaded with AOL software.
<p>
   Case said he expects AOL's upgraded system to be fully in place
by the spring. But that isn't likely to placate irate customers  &MD; 
many of whom say it takes more than five attempts to successfully
log on to AOL.
<p>
   ``It's beginning to become ridiculously impractical for people
to do business,'' said Larry Shapiro, publisher of California
Employer Advisor, a newsletter in Tiburon. ``Reporters are having
trouble filing stories and graphic designers can't transfer files
via AOL.''
<p>
   Shapiro said the online logjam becomes acute in the late
afternoon  &MD;  about the same time that AOL subscribers on the East
Coast arrive home from work and attempt to log on.
<p>
   ``What bothers me is that while they have this problem, they're
advertising like crazy on TV and constantly sending out free
diskettes to get more subscribers,'' said Wayne Seden, an AOL
customer in Mountain View. ``I've used AOL for a couple of
years,and I'm ready to quit.''
<p>
   That's no easy chore, either.
<p>
   Consumers grouse that canceling their subscriptions is as
ticklish a task as getting online.
<p>
   ``It was really surprising that it was so easy to sign up and so
hard to get off,'' said Russell Handy, a San Diego resident who
said he tried for months last year to cancel his subscription to
the service.
<p>
   Although he kept calling to cancel, he said AOL kept deducting
monthly charges from his checking account. Finally, he asked the
bank to stop allowing the charges.
<p>
   The same thing happened to Farouk Algosaibi, a Berkeley
resident. Algosaibi said AOL continues to deduct charges from his
account more than one year after he stopped service.
<p>
   ``It's like they were going in and stealing my money,'' he said.
<p>
   A representative at one credit card company said they were
deluged with complaints from consumers trying to cancel AOL
payments. ``We get calls constantly,'' she said. ``We're about
ready to shoot AOL.''
<p>
   An AOL spokeswoman said AOL customers can cancel their accounts
only by calling the company at (800) 827-6364.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the company this week was hit with a raft of
class-action suits from disgruntled subscribers.
<p>
   At last count, six suits allege that the online service offered
its subscribers unlimited usage but did not have enough equipment
in place to meet the surge in demand. The suits seek either
punitive or exemplary damages.
<p>
   ``It's simply an outrage that consumers are being asked to cut
back on usage, but there is no offer by AOL to compensate them,''
said Joseph Tabacco, a San Francisco attorney representing one
group of plaintiffs.
<p>
   An AOL official declined to say whether customers will be
compensated for the lack of access this month. However, one
customer said she was told by an AOL representative that she could
appeal the charges in writing since she has not been able to log on
to the system.
<p>
   In addition, at least three state attorneys general  &MD;  Richard
Blumenthal of Connecticut, Dennis Vacco of New York and Jim Doyle
of Wisconsin  &MD;  confirmed they are in discussions with AOL seeking
some resolution to rampant customer complaints.
<p>
   ``Thousands of Connecticut consumers have paid for a service
that, very simply, they are not receiving,'' Blumenthal said in a
statement.
<p>
   The Illinois attorney general's office said it has received more
than two dozen complaints about AOL's billing practices,
cancellation policies and other issues. Industry observers argue
that competitive moves by companies such as AOL, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T
toward flat-rate pricing will only further clog the increasingly
congested Internet. Some suggest the industry would be better off
charging users on a pay-as-you-go basis.

<p>
   With its network and the patience of its customers strained to
the breaking point, America Online announced a series of new
initiatives Thursday to try to relieve the congestion that has led
to at least four class-action lawsuits and thousands of complaints
from frustrated consumers.
<p>
   The on-line service has been flooded with complaints from people
around the country who have been unable to dial into the service
since it began offering unlimited use for $19.95 a month in
December.
<p>
   To help ease the strain, the company announced that it would
suspend its television advertising campaign, spend an additional
$100 million to expand the capacity of its network, and add more
telephone representatives to field calls from angry customers.
<p>
   But even these measures will not relieve the company's clogged
modems until the spring at the earliest, said Bob Pittman, the
president and chief executive of AOL Networks, the America Online
unit that runs the on-line service.
<p>
   ``It will be the end of spring before we are where we want to
be,'' he added. ``Some cities will feel it sooner because this is
about going from town to town putting more modems in.''
<p>
   The company has even resorted to a novel approach to solving the
capacity constraints: asking customers not to use the service. In a
letter posted to subscribers Thursday, Steve Case, the chairman and
chief executive of America Online Inc., said that many users were
so worried about not being able to get on the network that they
were simply staying on all the time.
<p>
   ``While that's understandable at one level,'' Case wrote. ``It
is obviously problematic at another.''
<p>
   Pittman said the company had anticipated some increased use
after the new pricing plan was introduced, but the jump has been
greater than expected. In December, American Online customers
logged a record 102 million hours on line, up from 45 million hours
in September. The average American Online member now spends 32
minutes a day on line, up from 14 minutes in September.
<p>
   But judging from the number of complaints, one might conclude
the average American Online subscriber spends more time trying
unsuccessfully to dial on.
<p>
   Since the beginning of the year, a petition has been passed by
e-mail collecting scores of names. Its plea is simple: ``We the
users of AOL demand a dependable service.''
<p>
   ``For the last month, it has been almost impossible to get
connected after about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon,'' said
Judith Handelman, a freelance writer and editor in Scarsdale, N.Y.
``I wrote to them and I got this long letter full of claptrap.''
<p>
   Many customers use the service as part of their businesses,
making the difficulty of gaining access to e-mail even more
critical, but also making it harder to quit the service.
<p>
   ``I'd like to switch but I've got my AOL address on my business
card,'' said Jean Wyman, an entrepreneur who lives in Los Angeles.
<p>
   The company said Thursday that it was aware of four class-action
suits that have been filed against the service in California,
Illinois, New Jersey and New York. The New York suit accuses
America Online of breach of contract, deceptive practices,
deceptive advertising and unjust enrichment.
<p>
   ``If they didn't think that with 8 million subscribers they
didn't feel that they would have a tremendous burst of usage, then
they are incredibly naive  &MD;  and I don't think they are that,'' said
Edward Labaton, a partner with Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &AMP; Sucharow
in Manhattan, which filed a class-action suit on behalf of four
America Online members.
<p>
   Attorneys general in several states, including New York and
Wisconsin, are also alarmed by the complaints. Last month, America
Online reached an agreement with 19 states promising to clarify its
new pricing plan and offer refunds to consumers who ask to switch
back to their old plan before April.
<p>
   ``We're taking very close look at it,'' said Marc Carey, a
spokesman for New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco.
<p>
   Despite the many complaints, America Online said that it was
still growing. The company had a net gain of 1.2 million
subscribers in the quarter ending Dec. 31, for a total of more than
8 million. December was the service's best month ever, with 500,000
new subscribers. A spokesman said that the company would not say
how many customers it has been losing in recent weeks.
<p>
   Under its new plan, American Online will increase its spending
on system capacity to $350 million from $250 million. Next month,
it said it would break ground on a 180,000-square-foot data center
in Reston, Va.
<p>
   The service currently has more than 200,000 modems in cities
around the country for subscribers to dial up. It promised to
increase that number by 75 percent, allowing an additional 6
million sessions a day.
<p>
   In addition, the company said it would hire 600 more customer
support representatives, for a total of more than 4,500. It will
also suspend its television advertisements and stop distributing
its ubiquitous floppy disks offering a free trial in areas where
access has been a problem.
<p>
   The management, which has been denying the problem for weeks,
has also become more humble.
<p>
   ``Am I bloody?'' Pittman, the company executive, asked. ``Yes.
Do my eyes have circles under them? Yes.''

<p>
   Black ink has made a welcome return to the balance sheet of
Digital Equipment Corp. After nearly $500 million in losses over
the previous two quarters, Digital announced net income of $31.9
million or 15 cents per share for its second quarter, which ended
Dec. 28, 1996. Revenue grew by 15 percent over the first-quarter
level, but Digital officials warned that they expected little
additional revenue growth in the present quarter.
<p>
   Profits declined 79 percent from the same period a year earlier,
but Digital still managed to outperform the expectations of
industry analysts by about 4 cents a share. The performance boosted
Digital's stock, which opened Thursday at 34 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange and rose as high as 38 3/4 before closing at 36 3/4
up 2 1/2 for the day.
<p>
   Digital chairman Robert Palmer said the Maynard-based company
would have performed even better if it had been able to meet a late
surge in demand for its high-end Alpha server computers. Palmer
also said that Digital's troubled personal computer division did
better than expected, turning a profit while posting a 33 percent
increase in unit sales during the quarter.
<p>
   Bruce Claflin, general manager of Digital's PC operations,
declined to reveal how profitable the unit was. But he noted that
PC revenue actually fell compared to the year-earlier period. This
is partly because Digital has abandoned retail sales to consumers
to concentrate on its traditional business customers. In addition,
the company used to inflate its sales figures by saddling
distributors with too many computers. Claflin said that inventories
are now tightly managed to make sure that distributors get only as
many machines as they can sell.
<p>
   ``Our business is under control,'' Claflin said. ``It's solidly
profitable, and now it's going to resume a focused controlled
growth.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, Digital announced that unit sales of systems based on
its Alpha microprocessor grew just 1 percent from the same period
last year. Still, Alpha sales were up 33 percent over the previous
quarter and could have gone higher, because of a year-end increase
in orders for Alpha servers. Palmer said that revenue for these
late orders will show up in Digital's third-quarter results.
<p>
   Digital recently announced steep price cuts on Alpha
microprocessors, as well as servers and workstations using the
Alpha chips. Meanwhile, Motorola and IBM announced that they would
abandon efforts to support the popular Windows NT operating system
on their PowerPC microprocessor, one of Alpha's key rivals. As a
result, Alpha-based machines are the fastest computers that can run
Windows NT. ``In our view that provides us a clear opening to
underscore Alpha's advantages,'' Palmer said.
<p>
   Richard Chu, managing director of Cowen &AMP; Co. in Boston, said
it's too early to proclaim a turnaround at Digital. But he said the
latest report reflects solid improvement.
<p>
   ``Three months ago, you're looking at a lot of bad news. They
lost money, there was uncertainty about the sales organization,
uncertainty about the PC business,'' said Chu. ``This quarter ..
there definitely has been progress.''

 &UR; DIGITAL RETURNS TO PROFITABILITY IN SECOND QUARTER &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said Thursday that it regained
profitability in its fiscal second quarter, but it is still
suffering from slow sales of its flagship high-performance computer
systems.
<p>
   Digital, which is based in Maynard, Mass., reported net income
of $31.9 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with profits of
$148.8 million, or 91 cents a share, in the corresponding period a
year earlier. Revenue also declined, to $3.36 billion, or 15
percent, from $3.95 billion a year ago.
<p>
   The earnings exceeded the average Wall Street estimate, which
was 10 cents a share, according to First Call. But expectations had
been relatively low after Digital stunned investors in October by
posting a loss of $66 million, or 48 cents a share, for its first
quarter.
<p>
   That news had sent Digital's stock price plunging 23 percent to
a five-year low of $29 a share. It subsequently recovered, and
Thursday the shares closed at $36.75, up $2.50.
<p>
   Much of the good news included in Thursday's announcement came
from Digital's troubled personal computer unit, which was
profitable again after suffering heavy losses most of last year. In
the second quarter, which ended Dec. 28, PC sales declined 20
percent compared with a year earlier, but they rose sharply from
the first quarter.
<p>
   The company also seemed to recover from the disruption caused by
changes in the organization of its sales force, which the company
said had cut into revenue. In addition, it reduced costs, lowering
its head count by 1,100, to 55,900 employees.
<p>
   Digital chairman and chief executive Robert Palmer called the
company's performance a ``significant turnaround'' and expressed
confidence that business would continue to improve over the next
two quarters. But he added that the company would be hard pressed
to maintain the same revenues in the third quarter, which is
generally weak.
<p>
   ``We believe a responsible goal would be to maintain flat
revenues, but historical precedent wouldn't support that,'' he
said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Some Wall Street analysts were concerned about Digital's
prospects, especially because of the relatively weak sales of
high-performance systems built around its Alpha microprocessor.
<p>
   ``The issue is that this company has to generate more top-line
growth, and Alpha is the best shot,'' said Shao Wang, an analyst
with Smith Barney in New York.
<p>
   Sales of Alpha-based systems recovered somewhat in the second
quarter after a sharp decline in the previous period. Nevertheless,
Alpha-system revenues still grew only 1 percent at an annual rate.
<p>
   The Alpha microprocessor is one of the fastest in the industry.
But even though it has significantly better performance than Intel
Corp.'s Pentium Pro chip, Intel sold about 3 million Pentium Pro
chips last year, while Digital sold about 238,000 Alpha chips,
according to Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
<p>
   Palmer said that Digital was unable to fill $50 million worth of
orders for high-end Alpha systems last quarter because orders
flooded in at the end of December. With those sales, which he said
would be booked this quarter, Alpha revenues would have shown
double-digit growth.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Bill Gates unveiled the company's Office 97 software, calling it
the ``centerpiece of Microsoft's Internet strategy.''
<p>
   The package of spreadsheet, database and word-processing
software went on sale in stores today. It's expected to put more
pressure on competing software from Corel Corp. and International
Business Machines Corp. Office products, Microsoft's largest
moneymaker, already command an 85 percent market share.
<p>
   The new version includes such new programs as Internet browsing,
E-mail and collaboration software that let employees in distant
locations share and work on documents together. Office also makes
it easier to link documents and files to the Internet and to other
documents stored on a network.
<p>
   ``Office 97 will position Microsoft to have more power over how
we relate to the total network,'' said Bob Finch, investment
officer at Aeltus Investment Management, a Microsoft shareholder.
<p>
   The new Office is the company's most significant new product
sincec Windows 95, said Richard Fade, Microsoft's vice president of
desktop applications. Fade, Gates and other executives introduced
the product at New York City's Lincoln Center.
<p>
   Microsoft's shares rose 1 3/8 to 86.
<p>
   Microsoft said 500,000 units of Office 97 have been preordered
by distributors and resellers. It said 3 million copies were sold
to companies over the past month, and that 80 companies already
have installed the software on 1 million desktops.
<p>
   Office 97 sales are projected to reach $4 billion in fiscal
1997. The company reported fiscal 1996 revenue of $8.67 billion.
About half of that revenue was from applications sales, of which
zOffice makes up the bulk.
<p>
   Fade said the company expects 30 percent to 45 percent of
Office's users to switch to Office 97. He said the company expects
to expand its market share, in part by appealing to small
businesses and consumers. There are 55 million users of Office
products, with about 25 million users of the Office suite, or
package of products.
<p>
   The software also is expected to benefit from wider use of the
Windows 95 operating system, with which it's designed to work. Only
about 25 percent of the people using older Office products switched
to Office 95, introduced with the August 1995 release of Windows
95.
<p>
   In spite of the success Office is expected to have, analysts
said it is unlikely Microsoft will be able to offer an updated
package of software like Office 97 again.
<p>
   Increasingly, companies are creating computer networks based on
Internet software, with E-mail and collaboration as the focal
point, not word-processing software. Within those networks,
software can be updated piecemeal over time, instead of through one
large piece of software like Office.
<p>
   ``This is the last version of Office as we know it,'' said Eric
Brown, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market researcher.
<p>
   The Internet software included in Office are the beginnings of a
switch toward that new network-centric model, Brown said.
<p>
   Microsoft, which spent $200 million developing the updated
product, said it planned to spend about the same amount to on
research and development for Office updates.
<p>
   It said future plans include putting more of the software on the
central computer servers in a corporate network, so there will be a
lighter load of software on each desktop.
<p>
   The company also will periodically update parts of the software,
making them available over the Internet and computer networks,
though it said it still plans a future overall upgrade like Office
1997.
<p>
   Microsoft is offering four versions of the software to appeal to
large and small customers. Prices range from $209 to $499 for
customers who already have Office, and from $499 to $799 for new
users.
<p>
   The basic Office package is made up of Microsoft Word, Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint presentation software, Microsoft
Access database software and Outlook E-mail and calendar software.
The different components can be bought separately.

<p>
   Ssshhh. If you listen quietly, you can hear them. Those distant,
mournful cries are the anguished voices of America Online users
trying to connect.
<p>
   There are millions of them, and they all want one thing  &MD;  to
link up with the world's biggest online service to get e-mail, surf
the Internet, chat with friends or do some online shopping. The
problem is, they all want to get on at the same time.
<p>
   This is the direct result of America Online's decision to go
from per-hour to flat-fee pricing. Since the service now charges
$19.95 a month for unlimited access, users are staying on longer.
Some are even camping onto the system to receive e-mail or monitor
favorite chat rooms.
<p>
   It's worse in large cities, though subscribers in smaller towns
and rural areas are also finding it harder to get on.
<p>
   Not a day goes by that I don't receive at least three or four
pieces of e-mail from outraged America Online subscribers anxious
just to get their e-mail. Most of them never mention the other
features of the service; they just want to see what's in their
mailboxes, a testament to how important e-mail has become. The
problem is particularly vexing for businesses that have chosen
America Online as their e-mail source. Here, e-mail is more than
just a social thing  &MD;  it's an electronic lifeline.
<p>
   At this writing, it's been more than six weeks since the service
made its switch, and the busy signals have been almost continuous.
America Online executives say they are feverishly adding more
modems and phone lines, but so far it's been like handing an
eyedropper of water to refugees in the Sahara.
<p>
   If America Online can't solve this problem, market forces will
cause the situation to take care of itself. Frustrated subscribers
will cancel their accounts, moving on to Internet service providers
or other online services. There will be fewer subscribers trying to
connect to the service, freeing up the modems. That's bad for
America Online, which requires a constant source of new subscribers
to fuel its growth.
<p>
   There are a few things America Online subscribers can do to help
the situation:
<p>
    &MD;  If you can, avoid signing on during prime-time evening hours.
This is when most folks try connecting to the service and when the
logjam gets serious. Although you'll still get busy signals, there
will be fewer of them.
<p>
    &MD;  Don't be a part of the problem. When you get on, get what you
need and sign off the system so others can use it.
<p>
    &MD;  America Online's software won't repeatedly auto-dial a number,
but there are third-party programs that will. For example, Windows
users can try Gritty Redialer (keyword Gritty News) which will call
the service's local numbers until the system connects. Then you
don't have to sit there, repeatedly pressing the sign-on button.
<p>
    &MD;  If you already have an account with an Internet service
provider, you can bypass America Online's modems altogether and
connect to the service over the Net. Sign on to your provider, then
fire up the America Online software. Click on Setup from the
sign-on box; choose Edit Location; then change the type of
connection to TCP/IP. Save the settings, then back out and sign on
as you normally would.
<p>
   In fact, if you choose to use only this method to connect,
America Online will charge you less per month, partly making up for
the fact that you also must pay fees to an Internet provider.
<p>
    &MD;  Finally, the ultimate fix would be to flee America Online and
sign on with another provider. I've said this before, and it bears
repeating: If you go in search of an Internet provider, avoid those
whose fees are far below the mainstream. They usually cannot
generate enough cash to keep up with equipment demands. You're apt
to be back where you started, listening to the harsh sound of busy
signals.
<p>
   In a previous column, I said that if America Online can fix its
capacity problems  &MD;  and if you are using the Windows 95 version of
America Online  &MD;  it's probably the best value for Internet access.
For $20 a month, you get the Net plus all of the service's
proprietary content. That's a great deal.
<p>
   But it's moot if you can't get on to play with all these cool
features, or if the system is so bogged down that it's like wading
through electronic quicksand. If America Online is to survive as an
online service, it must put more emphasis on the word ``service''
and drag itself out of this morass  &MD;  quickly.

 &UR; LAZARD RANKS AS TOP EUROPEAN CROSS-BORDER ADVISER IN 1996 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Lazard houses were the most
successful advisers on cross-border takeovers in Europe last year
in a business increasingly dominated by U.S. investment banks,
according to Acquisitions Monthly magazine.
<p>
   The three Lazard businesses in London, Paris and New York
collectively topped the magazine's rankings, advising on 46
transactions with a total value of 12 billion pounds ($19.8
billion). Those included the 3.3 billion-pound takeover of France's
CarnaudMetalbox by Crown Cork &AMP; Seal Co. of the U.S., the biggest
cross-border takeover last year.
<p>
   Lazard was followed Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co., which led a group of six U.S. investment banks within the top
10 advisers.
<p>
   ``The U.S. effectively has a stranglehold on European
cross-border mergers and acquisitions advisory work,'' Philip
Healey, editor of Acquisitions Monthly, said in a prepared
statement. ``This is at the expense of the U.K. banks and
integrated European investment banks.''
<p>
   U.S. investment banks have led a surge in mergers throughout
Europe in the last two years as industries such as phamaceuticals
and telecommunications prepare for monetary union at the end of the
decade. Bankers said their clients increasingly demand advisors
with global reach to help them make decisions on how to grow their
own businesses globally.
<p>
   Other U.S. investment banks in the top 10 were J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., and Credit Suisse
First Boston, which Acquisitions Monthly counts as a U.S. bank.
<p>
   SBC Warburg, the investment banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp., the
Rothschild Group and Societe Generale rounded out the list of the
top 10 advisers.
<p>
   The largest merger in Europe last year, the $30 billion
combination of Swiss pharmaceutical companies Sandoz AG and
Ciba-Geigy AG, was advised on by J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley. It
wasn't counted as a cross-border transaction. Lazard, which ranked
sixth last year, benefited from an increasing amount of takeovers
in France and the U.K. Lazard has three businesses, Lazard Freres &AMP;
Cie. in Paris, Lazard Brothers in London and Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in
New York. They work together on cross-border transactions, giving
the company the same benefits of international expertise on two
continents that the U.S. banks have. Healey said he expects the
pace of mergers in Europe to continue, which will benefit the U.S.
banks again.

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  It was only one line  &MD;  a single, simple, seemingly
innocuous line spoken by a 9-year-old girl in the film ``Jurassic
Park'': ``This is a UNIX system.''
<p>
   No way, cried hundreds of computer fans, who flamed the film's
production crew with e-mail deriding the girl's statement. No way a
mere child could understand a computer program as complicated as
UNIX.
<p>
   ``I took that as a compliment,'' said software designer Brian
Callier, who makes sure the computers used in movies look and sound
authentic. ``OK, so the girl's line might be a stretch. But we were
filming a real UNIX system.''
<p>
   As computer technology becomes more prevalent in the home and
workplace, so does its presence in feature films. PCs have emerged
as both movie props and plot devices  &MD;  cast in starring roles
(``2001,'' ``War Games,'' ``Virtuosity,'') and in bit parts
(``Disclosure,'' ``Assassins,'' ``Species'').
<p>
   To make the magic, Hollywood relies on Callier and other
computer advisers. These technical mavens handle everything from
reworking script dialogue for accuracy to assembling the actual
computer props used by the actors.
<p>
   ``Our goal is not to draw attention to our work. It's to make
sure that the computer works, it's pleasing to look at and it helps
move the movie along,'' said software developer Alex Mann, 28, who
runs the San Francisco-based Mann Consulting with his brother
Harold. ``It's all about learning how to strike a proper balance
between what's entertaining and what people know to be true.''
<p>
   Those working in this arena note the talent pool is tiny. About
40 people worldwide fall within this select and specialized group
of special-effects artists. Some, like engineer John Monsour, broke
in through industrial filmmaking. Others, like the Mann brothers,
used their computer experience to draw themselves into Hollywood.
<p>
   Their numbers may be small, but the demand for their services is
high. Unlike other props, computers require regular maintenance and
delicate control. A glitch in a software program can cause lengthy
and expensive delays in production, so most computer-effects
supervisors live by the mantra that simple is best.
<p>
   ``Our budget is usually about one-half to one percent of a
film's overall cost,'' Monsour said. ``Directors may not understand
what a computer can do, but they understand that a broken cable can
cost them thousands of dollars. So I try to take precautions, like
removing unnecessary programs. You don't want a screen saver
popping on at a bad moment.''
<p>
   Consultants like Callier, the Manns and effects-supervisor Todd
Marks also help film directors understand and explore technological
limits. When director Barry Levinson needed his ``Disclosure''
characters to communicate by e-mail, the director enlisted Callier
and Monsour to design the software and build the office computers.
<p>
   ``After the movie came out, we got calls from Microsoft people
wanting to know if the e-mail interface was real,'' said Callier,
30, who lives in Northridge. ``I guess they liked the way the mail
crumpled up on the screen before it was tossed in the trash can.''
<p>
   Other directors eschew the independent contractors and favor
multifaceted effects houses like Playback Technologies in Burbank
and E &QC; mc2 in Glendale. Both store hundreds of computer and
television components, ranging from the latest IBM release to
hardware from the '50s.
<p>
   ``Every contractor has his strengths, but a house offers
one-stop shopping for directors,'' said Casey Cannon, 37, a
producer with the Santa Monica-based effects studio Banned from the
Ranch. ``It's a struggle for a director, who's been working on a
project for years, to go to five different effects people and hope
they all get his vision. There's enough problems to work through on
a set. They don't need another hurdle.''
<p>
   As in storytelling, timing is one of the fundamental problems
when filming computers. The camera and the monitor must be in sync
and flash the same number of frames per second. If not, the film
records a slight flicker or a rolling bar across the computer
image.
<p>
   Known as the grandfather of this industry, Monsour discovered
this problem while filming industrial commercials for Xerox in the
late '70s and Apple Computers in the early '80s. The problem was
simple: Computer screens run at 30 frames per second, while film
runs at only 24 fps.
<p>
   ``Video runs at 25 fps, so directors figured out it was easier
to make the jump from video to film than from computer to film,''
said Monsour, 50, who works out of the cramped garage at his
Hollywood home. ``Most directors used the computer as a shell and
ran videotape instead of a computer program.''
<p>
   But as more scripts demanded stars to interact with a PC, the
inflexible nature of prerecorded tape wouldn't do. Monsour
developed a series of custom circuit boards he could connect to a
computer's video card to synchronize the monitor.

<p>
   Monsour points to the 1986 film ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home'' as an example of the faux-computer technique. One scene
features a character trying to talk into a Macintosh mouse, and
later working on a Mac with a color monitor.
<p>
   ``Back then, the Macintosh didn't come with a color screen,''
Monsour said.
<p>
   A picky and minor point, admits the engineer, but film audiences
are more likely to believe outlandish plots when the stories are
grounded in realistic technology. Films set in the future, like
``Star Trek,'' can play off of devices like ``inertial dampners''
as technology that hasn't been invented.
<p>
   A film like ``Jurassic Park,'' however, borders on a world that
exists today.
<p>
   ``We can't build the park, but genetic manipulation does exist.
So it's easier for us to buy the idea of scientists bringing
dinosaurs to life,'' said Michael Backes, 40, a screenplay writer
who worked as the visual effects supervisor on the
soon-to-be-released DreamWorks movie ``Peacemaker.''
<p>
   ``If the computers in the lab suddenly sprouted legs and ran
after the dinosaurs, you would have lost the audience. People
expect to see stars working on a computer, not running from one.''
<p>
   In the last few years, that's exactly what moviegoers have seen:
Tom Cruise scrambling to use a password that opens a critical file;
Keanu Reeves delving into a computer program to find a flaw in a
bomb; Jeff Goldblum plugging his computer into the alien ship and
zapping the aliens with a virus; and Antonio Banderas and Sylvester
Stallone tapping their laptops for assassination assignments.
<p>
   A computer running a software program in real-time serves as a
visual cue for the actors, said Michael Lewis, co-chairman of the
film and effects production company L-Squared. In ``The Net,''
Sandra Bullock's previous familiarity with Macintosh and America
Online allowed the Manns to develop a more sophisticated software
interface.
<p>
   ``Any key Sandra hit would reveal the right letter, but it was
all live,'' said Harold Mann, 30. ``She was the one driving the
action.''
<p>
   But not every star feels comfortable in the digital maestro
role. Skittish performers force some technical staff to make the
graphics actor-proof.
<p>
   On the set of ``Disclosure,'' Callier said, actor Michael
Douglas told the production crew that he was uncomfortable typing
and acting at the same time. He refused to use any of the computers
on the set.
<p>
   Monsour developed a fake keyboard for Douglas. When a scene
called for the actor to work on a PC, Douglas would punch away at
the simulated keys. Off-screen, Callier ran the software, typed the
text and moved the mouse.
<p>
   Occasionally, virtual reality can be supplanted by Hollywood's
need for a visually compelling image. Take computer viruses, a
popular plot device with absolutely no on-screen pizazz.
<p>
   ``Computer viruses don't look like much,'' said Alex Mann, whose
company recently worked on ``The Lost World,'' Spielberg's sequel
to ``Jurassic Park.''
<p>
   ``One minute your computer works. The next minute, it doesn't.''
<p>
   In ``The Net,'' director Irwin Winkler asked the Manns to throw
authenticity aside. So the Manns created screens of data that, when
the virus hit, appeared to dissolve. Additionally, they improved
the speed of the graphics being downloaded on the Internet.
<p>
   ``We try to make things completely accurate, but it's always
better to err on the side of what's going to be legible to the
audience,'' Mann said. ``The computer is part of the story.
Sometimes, the core technology is real, but the computer still
needs a flashy costume.''

 &UR; ARCHITECTURAL SOFTWARE FIRM OFFERS HOME REMODELING PROGRAM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The company that made its name selling drafting
software to professional architects has come out with a new program
designed to help do-it-yourselfers remove the guesswork  &MD;  and
lessen the arguments  &MD;  inherent in home remodeling.
<p>
   Autodesk Inc. of San Rafael, Calif. started shipping its
``Picture This Home'' software Wednesday, after spending 18 months
developing a program that's supposed to be so easy to use, it won
the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.
<p>
   The $50 software runs on fast PCs with 16 megabytes of memory
and a four-speed CD-ROM drive. Autodesk Chief Executive Carol Bartz
said Picture This Home will let consumers design their kitchens,
for instance, then plug in specific cabinets, wall papers or
appliances to see exactly how the room would appear.
<p>
   ``It gives you a great way to visualize your ideas and design
the space,'' Bartz said. ``As we've shown the product to the media
and analysts, people have literally ripped the mouse out of our
hands.''
<p>
   Now Bartz is hoping Picture This Home will propel Autodesk  &MD; 
which has become a $500 million company on the strength of
engineering, architectural and multimedia tool sales  &MD;  into the
consumer arena.
<p>
   If the foray succeeds, it won't come a moment too soon. Autodesk
struggled in 1996. Engineers and architects delayed purchasing
Autodesk's professional-strength design software to await a revised
version that should be released soon.
<p>
   In the meantime, Autodesk's sales fell 6.4 percent to $381.6
million in the first nine months of fiscal 1997, down from $407.9
million in the same period the previous fiscal year.
<p>
   Its stock fell as well, dropping from a high of roughly 44 in
April to a low near 18 in August. Autodesk has begun to recover
some ground, and four Wall Street analysts recently recommended the
stock as a ``buy'' as the release date for its new professional
software grows near.
<p>
   Kate Delhagen, software analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said Autodesk is taking a risk by entering the
consumer market, where it is unknown and where two dozen home
design programs already exist.
<p>
   But Delhagen said Autodesk is hoping to distinguish Picture This
Home from other products by making its professional-strength tools
easy enough for consumers to use. For instance, the new software
contains a library of images that represent real products, from
cabinets to stoves, so the remodeler can see not just how
wall-to-wall cabinets would look, but how the ones with the glass
doors would differ from the cherry maple variety.
<p>
   ``That could hook a lot of people,'' Delhagen said.
<p>
   Chris LeTocq, who follows software for the Dataquest market
research firm in San Jose, said Autodesk had tried to prepare
itself for the consumer marketplace by testing the software on
focus groups and asking the Good Housekeeping Institute in New York
to certify Picture This Home as easy to use.
<p>
   ``This will be quite a challenge for Autodesk because it's a new
market, but they seemed to have done a lot of things right,'' he
said.
<p>
   To bridge the gap between selling to professionals and selling
to consumers, Autodesk hired Linda Henderson, who had directed
marketing for San Francisco-based food maker Specialty Brands and
for the St.-Louis-based Ralston Purina Co.
<p>
   Henderson said Autodesk tested the software to see whether it
appealed more to men or women. She said the tests showed both
genders found the software useful, men because it allowed them to
see how one style of wallpaper would look as opposed to another,
and women because it helped them sketch out room layouts which they
weren't comfortable doing with pen and paper.
<p>
   She said Autodesk had also conceived a print advertising
campaign that would play on the fact that remodeling projects
create family friction. One ad will show a man and woman lying at
opposite sides of the bed, with thought bubbles over his head
decrying the woman as a spendthrift, while the woman derides the
man's lack of taste.
<p>
   ``Our inside joke is that it's either Picture This Home or
Picture This Divorce,'' Henderson said.
<p>
   Indeed, to preserve family peace, the new software also contains
a built-in spreadsheet so do-it-yourselfers can see how this or
that change would affect the overall budget.

<p>
   A few months ago, I sat in a large conference room at Microsoft
headquarters as Bill Gates and his lieutenants sang the praises of
the Microsoft Network on-line service. Dozens of journalists sat at
long, curved tables, pecking at laptop computers. No need to waste
our batteries, either; there was an electrical outlet at each seat.
<p>
   But there were no telephone lines for logging onto the Internet.
A few years earlier, when the complex was built, working on-line
wasn't much of an issue.
<p>
   It still wasn't in 1994, as Microsoft redesigned its Office
software suite for the Windows 95 operating system. Then, as now,
Office was the world's most popular bundle of basic business
software. Its Microsoft Word word processing program, the
spreadsheet program Excel, and PowerPoint, for producing
computerized slide shows, are the most popular products in their
categories.
<p>
   Maybe the company didn't want to mess with success. So their
upgraded version of the Office suite still couldn't work well with
the Internet or corporate intranets. Even the suite's built-in
address book didn't have a place for writing in electronic mail
addresses.
<p>
   But just over a year ago, Microsoft saw the light, and has
launched a ferocious campaign to add network capabilities to every
product it makes, including its Office suite. The newest version
hits stores today, and it'll land with a thump. Office 97 ($499
suggested retail price; $209 upgrade price for current Office
users) is a monster that will devour about 120 megabytes of your
hard drive and all the memory chips you can toss at it. But in
exchange, you get a batch of high-quality office software that
integrates nicely with internal corporate networks or the Internet.
<p>
   Don't give Microsoft too much credit; many of the new features
were pioneered months ago by Corel Corp. in its excellent Office 7
suite. Corel's WordPerfect word processing program offers a
built-in editor for creating World Wide Web pages. Office 7 lets
you add Internet-like hyperlinks to text documents, spreadsheets or
slide shows, and open your favorite Web browser from inside the
Corel suite. At last, Microsoft Office has caught up.
<p>
   But with Outlook, its new personal information manager,
Microsoft has stepped into the lead. Outlook, which will also be
sold as a separate product for around $100, is a desktop command
center that lets you manage your work, communicate easily with
colleagues, and access nearly every other function on your
computer. From inside Outlook, you can dispatch e-mail messages,
punch up favorite Web sites, launch a spreadsheet, scribble
electronic ``sticky notes'' or track the week's appointments.
<p>
   I lusted after this remarkable program since I saw a
demonstration of it last autumn. Now that I've used it for a few
weeks, I'm impressed, delighted  &MD;  and disappointed, too.
<p>
   Outlook is too big and too slow to run well on most desktop
machines. My Pentium with 16 megabytes of RAM memory began throwing
up ``out of memory'' errors for the first time since I switched to
Windows 95. No surprise. Outlook snatches 14 megabytes of RAM as
soon as you load it. It's a good thing Windows 95 lets you use a
chunk of your hard drive as a substitute for RAM chips. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have been able to run Outlook at all.
<p>
   Microsoft recommends 8 megs of memory to run any one of the
Office apps, except the Access database, which wants 12 megs. More
memory is needed to run several apps at once, the company says. No
foolin'.
<p>
   This is, of course, absurd. I was running Access alone, on a 16
meg machine, and it was crashing it for lack of memory.
<p>
   As it is, Outlook doesn't run so much as it limps. I'll have to
add at least another 16 megabytes of memory for proper performance.
If you plan to buy it, be sure to budget for more memory  &MD;  32
megabytes or bust.
<p>
   Office 97 has a number of other noteworthy flaws. Remember the
idiotic cartoon help screens from Microsoft's Bob? They're back,
and they ruin an otherwise excellent help feature. And documents
written in Word 97 cannot be read by someone with an earlier
version of Word. What was Microsoft thinking? Word documents are a
de facto standard in the business world. But users of Word 97 can
no longer casually e-mail their documents; the person on the other
end may not be able to read them.
<p>
   These weaknesses should give Corel a chance to recoup in its
next office suite, due out this year. Corel has allied with
Netscape Communications Corp. to add top-quality Internet and
intranet features. Based on my experience with Netscape's new
Communicator program, the next Corel-Netscape office suite will
probably leave Microsoft in the dust once again. WordPerfect users
should wait and see. But Office 97 is a sound investment for loyal
Microsoft users with a little spare cash and a lot of extra memory.

   Xander Mellish is a name not easily forgotten, especially after
seeing it above an emerging collection of short stories. They are
available only on the web and only because Mellish discovered
herself elbowed away from the usual paths to publication.
<p>
   She launched her web site, which is at
www.users.interport.net/tildexmel, in September 1995. ``I started
it out of frustration with this closed little literary world, the
writing-school mafia who run all the literary publications in the
country,'' she said. ``I didn't want to be one of those people, but
I wanted people to read my stories.''
<p>
   Her characters are the kinds of beautiful losers walking New
York streets, people with lives and loves perpetually in flux. In
one story, Mellish, 28, effectively conveys the passion of a bike
messenger-musician whose life is divided between his two loves:
music and an ambitious girlfriend.
<p>
   Another tale lays bare the sad, complex bond of an ill young man
and the noble woman who cares for him, leading readers to wonder
what each one derives from the interaction.
<p>
   In ``Extraordinary,'' a 19-year-old summer fashion intern from
the Midwest reacts to Manhattan with a mix of excitement and quiet
terror:
<p>
   ``I can remember everything about that first flight, everything
I saw or felt. Right after one o'clock, I was drowsy and did go to
bed, and as I was drifting off I thought about the bus ride from
the airport, and about New York City. I thought about all the
glamorous night spots, and how I could just get into a taxi and ask
to be taken to them, and who I would meet there. But I was also
afraid the taxis might drive me around and around, between the
sirens, and not let me out and never bring me home.''
<p>
   The emotional depth of her stories and their whimsical cartoons
offer a creative respite from her real-life work, writing about
municipal bonds. ``Not that municipal bonds aren't exciting,'' she
says with a chuckle.
<p>
   Some of the stories have been revised several times over the
past year, occasionally prompted by readers' suggestions sent via
e-mail. ``It's like an evolving book. It's no different than an
old-fashioned literary community where people bounce things off
each other.''
<p>
   Thanks to the slow spiral of 'Net attention, she now has an
agent and is working on a compilation of short stories to be
published in the customary book form. When the first bound copies
move off the presses, Mellish will have passed a career milestone.
<p>
   ``But it could never be as good as the Internet,'' she said,
voice rising slightly. ``Somebody who is nobody having access to
all those readers. This is something that writers have wanted since
Gutenberg.''
<p>
--------- &QC;   &UR; Chippier chip:  &LR; At the Consumer Electronics Show, the
massive annual gadget-and-gewgaw exposition held last week in Las
Vegas, chip giant Intel tried to command the early buzz by
unveiling its multimedia-mauling MMX microprocessor chip.
<p>
   Intel says it will speed the simultaneous handling of sound and
video found in most new PC-platform entertainment applications that
can make even a fast Pentium chip into a poky hunk of silicon.
Hard-core gamers are happy, of course, but the MMX will likely have
little effect for most people, except for a possible pocketbook
bonus for anyone who delays buying a Pentium until later this year.
<p>
------- &QC;   &UR; Wired without wires:  &LR; There's likely to be more of an
immediate bump from last Thursday's Federal Communications
Commission announcement of new radio frequencies for cordless data
transmissions. This will enable networked computers, monitors,
printers, scanners and other peripherals to be controlled without
being linked by cables and phone lines that make the floor of a
small office seem like a vine-covered jungle.
<p>
   The push to wire schools to the Internet may proceed faster now
that most can avoid drilling through walls and floors that might
contain asbestos. One machine with a dedicated 'Net connection can
be linked to all others in the school by radio waves.
<p>
---------- &QC;   &UR; Free Slate:  &LR; The free on-line magazine Slate,
 &UR; www.slate.com &LR; , will stay free for the indefinite future,
according to editor Michael Kinsley. The web mag debuted last year
as a freebie but planned to charge $20 yearly once it was
established. Healthy advertising income is enabling it to exist
without resorting to paid subscriptions.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Bill Gates unveiled the company's Office 97 software, calling it
the ``centerpiece of Microsoft's Internet strategy.''
<p>
   The package of spreadsheet, database and word-processing
software went on sale in stores today. It's expected to put more
pressure on competing software from Corel Corp. and International
Business Machines Corp. Office products, Microsoft's largest
moneymaker, already command an 85 percent market share.
<p>
   The new version includes such new programs as Internet browsing,
E-mail and collaboration software that let employees in distant
locations share and work on documents together. Office also makes
it easier to link documents and files to the Internet and to other
documents stored on a network.
<p>
   ``Office 97 will position Microsoft to have more power over how
we relate to the total network,'' said Bob Finch, investment
officer at Aeltus Investment Management, a Microsoft shareholder.
<p>
   The new Office is the company's most significant new product
sincec Windows 95, said Richard Fade, Microsoft's vice president of
desktop applications. Fade, Gates and other executives introduced
the product at New York City's Lincoln Center.
<p>
   Microsoft's shares rose 1 3/8 to 86.
<p>
   Microsoft said 500,000 units of Office 97 have been preordered
by distributors and resellers. It said 3 million copies were sold
to companies over the past month, and that 80 companies already
have installed the software on 1 million desktops.
<p>
   Office 97 sales are projected to reach $4 billion in fiscal
1997. The company reported fiscal 1996 revenue of $8.67 billion.
About half of that revenue was from applications sales, of which
zOffice makes up the bulk.
<p>
   Fade said the company expects 30 percent to 45 percent of
Office's users to switch to Office 97. He said the company expects
to expand its market share, in part by appealing to small
businesses and consumers. There are 55 million users of Office
products, with about 25 million users of the Office suite, or
package of products.
<p>
   The software also is expected to benefit from wider use of the
Windows 95 operating system, with which it's designed to work. Only
about 25 percent of the people using older Office products switched
to Office 95, introduced with the August 1995 release of Windows
95.
<p>
   In spite of the success Office is expected to have, analysts
said it is unlikely Microsoft will be able to offer an updated
package of software like Office 97 again.
<p>
   Increasingly, companies are creating computer networks based on
Internet software, with E-mail and collaboration as the focal
point, not word-processing software. Within those networks,
software can be updated piecemeal over time, instead of through one
large piece of software like Office.
<p>
   ``This is the last version of Office as we know it,'' said Eric
Brown, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market researcher.
<p>
   The Internet software included in Office are the beginnings of a
switch toward that new network-centric model, Brown said.
<p>
   Microsoft, which spent $200 million developing the updated
product, said it planned to spend about the same amount to on
research and development for Office updates.
<p>
   It said future plans include putting more of the software on the
central computer servers in a corporate network, so there will be a
lighter load of software on each desktop.
<p>
   The company also will periodically update parts of the software,
making them available over the Internet and computer networks,
though it said it still plans a future overall upgrade like Office
1997.
<p>
   Microsoft is offering four versions of the software to appeal to
large and small customers. Prices range from $209 to $499 for
customers who already have Office, and from $499 to $799 for new
users.
<p>
   The basic Office package is made up of Microsoft Word, Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint presentation software, Microsoft
Access database software and Outlook E-mail and calendar software.
The different components can be bought separately.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What's so special about the new Pentium MMX
chip? Should I think about getting a new computer with one?  &MD;  Chip
Chucker.
<p>
   DEAR CHUCK: What's so special? WHAT'S SO SPECIAL?!?! Why, it's
new and improved! What more does any consumer need to know?!?! And
it even has an exotic-sounding new secret miracle ingredient, MMX.
<p>
   Intel has optimized the old Pentium so it will deliver better
graphics, video and sound. If you can believe everything in the
glowing press release, your old programs will run a tad faster. New
software written to take advantage of the chip's capability is
supposed to scream.
<p>
   Should you buy one? If you're in the market anyway, why not?
Otherwise, you can safely hold off unless you're one of those
anal-retentive gadget freaks who gets all wild-eyed and short of
breath at the mere thought of not owning the most advanced
technology on the planet.
<p>
   Incidentally, in a refreshing display of honest marketing (or it
could have just been a slip of the tongue), Intel says ``MMX''
doesn't stand for anything. It's just a trademark. Oh, sure, and
next you'll be telling me that Retsyn, Techron and Scrubbing
Bubbles are just made-up names for a few common chemicals and not
wonder-ingredients at all. I'll never fall for that.
<p>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is it possible to get the E-mail address of
anyone in the world? I know my friend is working in Singapore and
has Internet access.  &MD;  Mail Call.
<p>
   DEAR MAIL: Unfortunately, the most reliable way to find an
E-mail address is to use one of those outmoded, hard-wired
telephonic communication devices found in almost every home to
contact your friend personally, for which service you will be
overcharged by a monopolistic megacorporation that hasn't figured
out exactly how to start overcharging people for using the
Internet. Or you can make it a collect call.
<p>
   Alternatively, you could try one of the ``white pages'' services
on the Web: InfoSpace (http://www.infospace.com), Four11

   But be warned that these listings are not necessarily
up-to-date, complete or even accurate. For instance, a search for
``Bombay'' turned up dozens of faux-Dr. Bombays, none of whom was
me. And remember, for the best in computing advice, accept no
substitute, unless one of those other guys wants to take over for a
couple of weeks while I jet down to the Caribbean at company
expense so a platoon of obsequious poolside waiters can bring me a
constant supply of powerful native beverages. I think my editors
should know that this would really improve my attitude, therefore
the content of this column. Just a thought.

   Children can learn six new games and develop problem-solving
skills using two programs in Edmark Corp.'s Strategy Series.
Designed for ages eight and up, Strategy Challenges Collection 1:
Around the World and Strategy Challenges Collection 2: In the Wild
(CD-ROM; Windows/Mac; about $20) have classic games from various
countries.
<p>
   While the programs are geared toward children, some of the games
can be challenging for adults, particularly when played on the
highest skill levels. And parents, siblings or playmates can play
against a computer opponent or against another player.
<p>
   Collection 1 has been reviewed here previously when it was
released last year, but under another name (Strategy Games of the
World). It has three games: mancala (played with stones placed in
pits in a game board), nine men's morris (played with pieces on a
game board), and go-moku (the object of which is to place five
pieces in a row on a grid before an opponent does).
<p>
   Like Collection 1, the new Collection 2 has three games, and
features interactive strategy coaches who help the children learn
the basic rules of the game and suggest moves to help develop
strategies. Each game has a choice of six opponents who are
designed to show children defensive and offensive strategy.
<p>
   The three games are:
<p>
    &MD;  Jungle chess: A centuries-old game that began in China, this
game uses pieces shaped like animals. Each has a different power
rating indicated on its top. Pieces move one square at a time.
Players try to move into the opponent's den while trying to avoid
capture or falling into a trap on the way.
<p>
    &MD;  Surakarta: A game from the Indonesian island of Java. Instead
of playing with shells on a board drawn in the sand, children play
on the computer screen. Marble-like pieces are used on a board
which had two sets of loops. Players move their pieces along the
loops to capture the opponent's pieces while trying to avoid
capture.
<p>
    &MD;  Tablut: A game of Lapland, the region including parts of
Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. The board resembles a
checkerboard without checkered squares. One player has 16 dark
pieces; the other, nine light pieces including a king who starts in
the center of the board. The player with the light pieces tries to
move the king to an outside-edge square while the player with the
dark pieces tries to surround the king on four sides.
<p>
   As children learn the basics of the game, the skill levels
increase, and new backgrounds appear. The friendly strategy coaches
will sometimes appear, and if clicked on, will provide suggestions
for plays. As the skill level becomes more difficult, coaches will
appear more often.
<p>
   To show how the strategy of game play is applied in the real
world, Challenges 2 uses animal and insect videos show children how
animals react offensively and defensively to situations.
<p>
   The program also has a video for parents to learn how the
program teaches strategies, how to build a personal strategy, and
how to use strategies in the games.
<p>
   A two-player sample of Jungle Chess is available at the Edmark
Web site: www.edmark.com. Both Collection 1 and Collection 2
CD-ROMs can be purchased at the Web site for $19.95. For
information call: (800) 691-2985.

 &UR; MICROSOFT QUARTERLY PROFITS UP  &MD;  AGAIN &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  Microsoft Corp. Friday handily beat Wall Street
estimates by reporting a 45 percent increase in quarterly profits,
but the Redmond software company once again warned that its
fast-paced revenue growth is due to decline several quarters hence.
<p>
   For its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, Microsoft said its
profit was $741 million compared to $575 million in the same period
a year ago. Revenues increased 22 percent to $2.68 billion.
<p>
   Strength across all lines of Microsoft's businesses, including
Windows operating systems and desktop applications, drove per-share
earnings to 57 cents, solidly above the consensus 51-cents-a-share
estimate by stock analysts who follow the company.
<p>
   The quarterly performance  &MD;  which was particularly positive
because Microsoft had recorded a 54 percent profit jump in the same
period last year, following the launch of the Windows 95 operating
system  &MD;  had been anticipated by investors following upbeat
earnings announcements earlier in the week by Intel Corp. and other
computer companies.
<p>
   Microsoft stock closed Friday at $87.125, up $1.125 in Nasdaq
trading. The earnings announcement came after markets closed.
<p>
   In a conference call with analysts, Microsoft Chief Financial
Officer Mike Brown said he was ``uncharacteristically optimistic
about the next two quarters'' following this week's release of
Office 97, one of the company's biggest revenue generators. Brown
said he expected earnings per share to increase 5 cents to 10 cents
in the current quarter, and another penny in Microsoft's fiscal
fourth quarter ending June 30.
<p>
   But Brown, who has typically tried to rein in overly optimistic
projections, warned that fiscal 1998 results will be ``solid'' but
growth would slow to ``the low double-digits.''
<p>
   Sales growth of important desktop applications sales will
decline because most corporations already own word processors and
other programs, he said. The company makes less money selling
software ``upgrades'' than it does on new sales.
<p>
   Overall PC sales are slowing, too, to about 15 percent a year,
which has an impact on Microsoft's highly-profitable operating
systems sales.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's huge ongoing expenditures on research and
development will continue to balloon from $1 billion a year to $2
billion, Brown said, but returns on that investment won't be felt
until after 1998.
<p>
   Sales during the upcoming fiscal year will get a boost from new
versions of the Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, and
the company's sales of PC networking and Internet software are
quickly expanding.
<p>
   But the company's ``Backoffice'' business, which includes
fast-growing sales of the Windows NT server network operating
system, contributes a relatively small portion to overall revenue,
Brown said  &MD;  $750 million in fiscal 1996, when the company took in
$8.7 billion.
<p>
   Signs of a slowdown already are evident, Brown said. In the last
three quarters, year-over-year revenue growth rates have slipped
from 46 percent to 33 percent to 22 percent.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell from records
as International Business Machines Corp.'s lower-than-expected
profit damped optimism that earnings can live up to expectations.
<p>
   IBM, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
tumbled 13 to 155, or 7.7 percent, sending the average down 75.82
to 6808.08.
<p>
   The drop triggered the New York Stock Exchange's ``uptick'' rule
at 9:50 a.m. Eastern time. The rule is triggered when the Dow
average drops 50 points, in an attempt to stabilize the market by
curbing some computer-guided trades.
<p>
   In the broader market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index lost 2.34
to 780.38 and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.73 to 1374.24.
<p>
   IBM said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent, slightly less
than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hurt
results. Net income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3
cents below analysts' expectations.
<p>
   ``They had some trouble in Europe,'' said analyst Bruce Raabe of
Collins &AMP; Co. ``And hardware sales were the weakest story.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at Compaq Computer Corp. The
Houston-based computer maker said earnings gained 43 percent, to
$1.64 a share, surpassing expectations by 11 cents.
<p>
   Compaq rose 3 3/8 to 81 7/8.
<p>
   ``With the exception of IBM, so far the earnings look pretty
good,'' said Peter Cardillo, a market strategist at Westfalia
Investments.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a
share, 2 cents above analysts' expectations, according to IBES
International Inc. The shares dropped 1/2 to 121 1/8.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, also topping forecasts.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profits rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. Its shares lost 1/2 to 38 7/8.
<p>
   Shares rose 1/2 to 37 5/8.
<p>
   Stocks received no help from bonds, which declined as the
Treasury prepared to sell debt and a Federal Reserve governor
revived concern that the central bank may raise interest rates
soon. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, used as a benchmark
for corporate borrowing costs, rose 2 basis points to 6.80 percent.
<p>
   Yesterday, the Dow industrials set their fourth consecutive
record, the 10th this year, rising 40.03 to 6883.90. Reports of
strong profits fueled the rise.
<p>
   Still, with the Dow industrials up 6.36 percent already this
year, ``investors are more sensitive to news that's unfavorable
than news that's favorable,'' said Philip Roth, chief technical
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
<p>
   Overseas markets were higher. In Japan, stocks jumped 3.78
percent to 18013.88 In London, the FTSE-100 gained 0.20 percent.

<p>
   Redmond, Washington, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.
reported a 29 percent increase in second-quarter profit that beat
analysts' estimates, although the software maker warned of slower
earnings growth beginning with its next fiscal year in July.
<p>
   Net income rose to $740 million, or 57 cents a share, from $575
million, or 45 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue for the
quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 22 percent to $2.68 billion from $2.20
billion.
<p>
   Wall Street was looking for earnings of 51 cents, based on the
average estimate of 22 analysts from IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Microsoft said it expects profit growth to ebb as revenue growth
slows in products such as its Windows operating systems and Office
desktop software. The company also is investing hundreds of
millions of dollars on the Internet, where it got a late start, and
on products for the burgeoning business of computer networks.
<p>
   ``The numbers are good, but you have to look beyond that,'' said
Richard Scocozza, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
``Microsoft is out here saying growth is slowing, and that's what
we need to take away from this.''
<p>
   Microsoft's shares, which rose 1 1/8 to 87 1/8 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, fell to as low as 85 1/4 when the company released
results after the close of trading.
<p>
   Signs of a slower growth are already are emerging. The
second-quarter's earnings growth didn't match the 54 percent
increase notched in the year-earlier quarter, when the August 1995
release of Windows 95 spurred a consumer buying binge.
<p>
   Microsoft said its software products, including business and
consumer operating systems and desktop programs, sold well across
the board during the quarter. Still, operating system sales growth
is expected to wane because of market saturation and less rapid
growth in personal-computer sales, Microsoft said.
<p>
   ``We worry a lot about desktop saturation,'' said Greg Maffei,
treasurer. ``We're bullish for the long-term, but we're trying to
put expectations in place to show growth isn't straight up.''
<p>
   The company said part of its concern was prompted by how well it
did in the second-quarter and whether those results would lead
investors to believe the growth could continue to increase.
<p>
   ``Our current EPS multiple is a cause for curiosity for me,''
said Michael Brown, Microsoft's chief financial officer, referring
to the ratio of the company's earnings per share to its stock
price. ``Our trailing multiple in the past was 35 when we grew at
46 percent a few quarters ago, but now we're growing 27 percent and
it (the trailing multiple) is 46.''
<p>
   Microsoft's operating system software is used to control the
basic operations of more than 80 percent of the world's computers,
which doesn't give Microsoft much room for growth, Scocozza said.
Growth in the desktop system will converge on PC growth rates,
which are about 15 percent, the company said.
<p>
   The growth of PC sales is expected to rise slightly to 17
percent in 1997 from 16 percent in 1996, although that is still
lower than the 24 percent the industry saw in 1995, according to
International Data Corp., a market researcher.
<p>
   The sales growth of the company's updated Office software, its
biggest moneymaker, is also expected to taper off in fiscal 1998
after rapid growth during the last two quarters of 1997. Office has
more than 85 percent of the market and has to rely more on
convincing companies to switch to the new product than on
increasing its share of the market.
<p>
   In the long-run, Office sales growth should be ``single-digit,''
the company said.
<p>
   Margins could narrow as well. Microsoft plans to spend about
$2.1 billion on research and development during fiscal 1997.
Although Microsoft declined to say how much it plans to spend in
fiscal 1998, the company said research and development will
increase sequentially through fiscal 1997 and into fiscal 1998.
<p>
   Microsoft is investing in Internet services and business and
network software, especially software designed to make it less
expensive to own a computer. Products, including the Windows NT
workstation, SQL Server and Exchange software, are expected to be
the main revenue gainers during the next few years.
<p>
   Microsoft is also investing heavily in Internet and news
services, and has said it expects to spend more than $1 billion
during the next three years before the services become profitable
in fiscal 1999. Investments include the MSN online network,
financial and travel services and a television channel and Internet
joint-venture with General Electric Co.'s NBC network.
<p>
   Revenue rose during the quarter on increasing demand for the
updated version of the company's Windows NT software and Windows
95, boosted by demand for Intel Corp.'s high-powered chips that are
included in most new computers, the company said.
<p>
   During the quarter, Microsoft also sold 3 million copies of its
updated Office programs to corporate users. Office, a package of
database, word-processing and spreadsheet software, went on sale
yesterday in stores.
<p>
   Microsoft said sales of previous Office products tapered off as
customers waited for the update to reach stores, but it expects
Office sales to jump, based on the orders it already received. The
company plans to defer about 25 percent of the revenue from Office
during the next 12 months.
<p>
   ``I'm optimistic about the next two quarters,'' Brown said.
Third quarter earnings should be up 5 or 10 cents sequentially,
with fourth-quarter earnings up another penny, he said.
<p>
   For the six months, Microsoft's net income rose to $1.35
billion, or $1.04 a share, from $1.07 billion, or 84 cents. Revenue
rose to $4.98 billion from $4.21 billion in the year-earlier
period.

<p>
   On Friday, Microsoft Corp. reported second quarter earnings that
far exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. But the software
giant also said that its growth could slow in fiscal 1998.
<p>
   Investors have grown accustomed to such cautionary remarks from
Microsoft, which often seem calculated to allow the company to
maintain its record of underpromising so that it can overdeliver.
Microsoft reported its results after the market's close, but in
after-hours trading, Microsoft shares rose $1.875 each, to $89,
after gaining $1.125, to $87.125, in on Nasdaq trading.
<p>
   ``We don't want overexuberance to reign,'' Greg Maffei,
Microsoft's treasurer, said in a telephone interview. ``We exceeded
Wall Street estimates very soundly this quarter. It's a recipe for
disaster to beat Street estimates by a wide margin, watch them
raise their estimates and lose your ability to beat them in the
future. We don't want 1998 to become a bar in the minds of analysts
that we can't meet.''
<p>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Microsoft  &MD;  which is based in
Redmond, Wash.  &MD;  reported earnings of $741 million, or 57 cents a
share, up 29 percent from $575 million, or 45 cents a share, in the
comparable period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2.68 billion, a
22 percent increase over the $2.20 billion reported a year earlier.
<p>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 51 cents a share,
according to First Call.
<p>
   Maffei said the company had strong performances across all of
its businesses, with particularly robust sales of its Windows 95
operating systems for desktop computers and Back Office
applications for large enterprises. He said the company
intentionally tapered off sales of its Office 95 suite of
applications in anticipation of the launch of Office 97 earlier
this week.
<p>
   ``We are pleased with the current financial results and growth
prospects for the next two quarters, particularly with the outlook
for sales of Office 97,'' Mike Brown, Microsoft's chief financial
officer, said in a statement. ``However, I do anticipate lower
revenue increases in our maturing businesses and margin pressure
from continuing aggressive spending on research and development and
new business ventures,'' he said.
<p>
   ``I'm optimistic about the next two quarters,
uncharacteristically optimistic,'' Brown said in a telephone
conference call. But he noted that Microsoft had been on a downward
revenue growth trend, from 46 percent in fiscal 1995 to 33 percent
in 1996 and 22 percent in 1997  &MD;  and said that this trend would
continue in 1998.
<p>
   Wall Street analysts had already estimated that revenue growth
would drop to 20 percent.
<p>
   ``That was before the fiscal 1997 hurdle bar went up with our
strong results,'' Brown said. ``I will not attempt to second-guess
the market. However our current earnings per share multiple is
cause for curiosity for me,'' he said, noting that Microsoft shares
traded at a lower multiple of earnings two years ago when the
company had a higher growth rate.
<p>
   Brown said there were five factors that could slow growth and
squeeze profit margins: Microsoft's core business, desktop
applications is growing at less than 10 percent; its second-largest
business, desktop operating systems, may be hurt by slowing
computer sales; its fastest growing product, Back Office, remains
small; research and development costs continue to rise, and the
personal computer software business remains inherently risky.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   ``It is very easy to move from the morning headlines to the
afternoon obituaries,'' Brown said, mentioning the Internet and the
network PC as particular challenges to Microsoft. ``Each year will
bring a new challenge, a new threat, a new competition,'' he said.
<p>
   Maffei said research and development costs continued to grow
more rapidly than revenues, totaling $485 million in the quarter,
up 55 percent from $313 billion in the comparable period a year
earlier.
<p>
   In August, Microsoft began shipping the updated version of
Windows NT, its network operating system software for businesses.
Maffei said that sales of Windows NT and business applications,

doubled in the last year. ``By fiscal year end, we expect NT market
share to exceed 40 percent,'' he said.

   New York, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Broderbund Software Inc. said
it plans to buy back the other 50 percent of Living Books, which it
sold to Advanced Publications Inc.'s Random House Inc. unit in
1994.
<p>
   Financial terms of the preliminary agreement weren't disclosed.
<p>
   Random House said it will continue to work with Broderbund and
Living Books to develop children's software products.
<p>
   Broderbund formed Living Books as a studio to produce and market
multimedia software for children, then sold half of it Random
House.
<p>
   ``The future of Living Books and our partnership is best served
by making Living Books once again an integral part of the
Broderbund organization,'' said Albert Vitale, chairman and chief
executive of Random House.
<p>
   Novato, California-based Broderbund publishes consumer software.
Its shares fell 3/4 to 33 3/4. Closely held Advanced Publications'
New York-based Random House unit publishes Parade magazine, Vanity
Fair, Vogue and other magazines.

<p>
   What if you threw a party, say, a Super Bowl bash, and nobody
came?
<p>
   That is the situation of the mutual fund industry as it tries to
do business with investors over the Internet.
<p>
   Home pages for fund families are popping up like mushrooms after
a heavy rain, and new on-line features are being marketed every
day. Some fund groups now let investors buy and sell shares using
their home computers. But the beer is getting flat: investors are
staying away in droves.
<p>
   So found the Investor Internet Adoption Study, conducted last
fall to measure fund investors' on-line habits. The study,
commissioned by Twentieth Century Mutual Funds and the Benham
Group, tried to gauge these investors' access to the Internet and
to understand their knowledge, needs and worries about Internet
services and investing on line.
<p>
   Elrick &AMP; Lavidge, a national research firm, conducted the
telephone interviews. It called 1,385 mutual fund investors at
random and found 250 who had personal access to the Internet.
<p>
   Over all, the research suggests that fund investors have been
slow to embrace the Internet, leading Twentieth Century and Benham
(now known together as American Century Investments) to conclude
that ``mutual fund Web site proliferation may be slightly ahead of
shareholder demand for on-line services.''
<p>
   The study concluded that 18 percent of fund investors, about 13
million people, have Internet access. Of these investors, 32
percent have visited Web sites of financial service companies; 28
percent have checked a fund site.
<p>
   The most popular Internet activity for fund investors is to
check fund share prices, the study found. Other activities, in
order of popularity, are reading or downloading prospectuses,
checking account balances and buying or selling fund shares.
<p>
   Still, the company remains optimistic that investors will catch
up to the industry as they become more familiar with new
technology.
<p>
   ``Investor visits to mutual fund Web sites are at a level where
you would expect them to be, considering the fact that most sites
have been in place less than two years and fund companies are just
beginning to understand investors' on-line service needs,'' said
Mary Witwer, director of electronic commerce for Twentieth Century
Mutual Funds and the Benham Group. ``As sites get better and
investors begin to realize the convenience offered by the Web,
usage should increase.''

<p>
   Granted that things have changed in the international air
warfare business since the end of the Cold War, such as Russia's
offer to sell a few MiG-29 jets to the Pentagon, still there must
be some secrets worth keeping.
<p>
   Whatever those are, there's a chance that someone will blurt
them eventually in a Usenet newsgroup called rec.aviation.military,
the Internet equivalent of a pilots' ready room full of the
chattiest flyboys of all the world's nations.
<p>
   For example, in answer to a posting asking how one would re-work
an F-16 warplane to make it more radar-repellent  &MD;  in a word,
stealthy  &MD;  the helpful advice flowed in from fans everywhere.
<p>
   ``They'd have to completely redesign the engine-intake and ditch
the vertical tail to make any real improvement,'' one contributor
said.
<p>
   Bragging of successes against Arab air forces' MiGs, an Israeli
admitted that there already is a delta-wing, tailless version of
the F-16.
<p>
   Then there would still be the problem of the right-angle panel
joints, ``patches'' and rivet lines on the fuselage, said another
contributor. ``An F-16 is a virtual radar reflector,'' he said.
``Couple this with the fact that an F-16 isn't worth any more than
a lawn dart if it isn't carrying ordnance. Throw two Sidewinders,
six bombs, a couple fuel tanks, and a pod, and you've added quite a
bit of reflectivity  &MD;  you'll see him for many, many miles.''
<p>
   Yeah, well, OK then, never mind hiding the fully-armed F-16 for
now, but thanks for the tips.
<p>
   Meanwhile another thread of conversation asked what nicknames
are applied to pilots, particularly rookies, in the various air
forces. In the Canadian Air Force and U.S. Navy, for example,
newcomers are sometimes called Nuggets.
<p>
   Rookie is popular for CH-124 Sea King helicopter trainees, a
contributor responded, or FNG for Fairly New Guy, except military
crews seldom say ``fairly'' when any other ``F'' word will do.
<p>
   On the C-130 Hercules yard, newcomers are TWITs, for Transport
Weenies in Training. Then there are the ever so much more important
Fighter/Attack Guys, or FAGs. F-16 pilots call F- 15 pilots
Coneheads, but that could be because the F-15 drivers refer to
F-16s as Lawn Darts (see above).
<p>
   Tanker crews are TOADs because so many are Temporarily on Active
Duty. Bomber crews are Pukes. New naval aviators sometimes are
called Butterbars because of their ensign's gold collar insignia.
In the P-3 Orion community, trainees are No-Ps until they work up
to the seat of 3-P, or Third Pilot.
<p>
   All of this is kindly and gentle hazing, of course, and no one
takes offense, at least on the Internet. For unlike a genuine ready
room full of rival pilots, a computer keyboard connected to a
Usenet forum is hardly the place where an offended flyboy would
take a swing at anybody.
<p>
   (EDS.; PLS USE THE PROPER SYMBOL IN PLACE OF `(AT)' IN THIS PGF.
<p>
   Usenet newsgroups are accessible with modem-equipped computers;
consult local Internet service providers for instructions and
groups available. Charles Stough is an editor for the Dayton (Ohio)

   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 7.7 percent after the
world's largest computer maker reported lower-than-expected sales
and earnings for the fourth quarter.
<p>
   IBM's stock fell 11 1/2 to 156 1/2 in early trading of 3.22
million shares, making it the second-most active U.S. stock.
Earlier, shares fell as low as 155. The stock had been trading at
ten-year highs in the past few weeks as investors were optimistic
about the earnings.
<p>
   ``IBM's been a major outperformer the past three or four
months,'' said John Rutledge, an analyst at Boston's Independence
Investment Associates, which owned 2.2 million IBM shares at the
end of September. Now, ``it takes a rest for a while.''
<p>
   IBM yesterday said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
slightly less than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand
in Europe hurt results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Earnings were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their earnings estimates for 1997.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   IBM, like some other companies, was hurt by weak economies in
some European countries. Additionally, mainframe and workstation
sales were slow and falling memory-chip prices continued to hurt
results.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales
declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' Rutledge
said. ``The bloom is off the rose.''

   At the moment, nearly 30 percent of Finnish homes have portable
computers, and about 60 percent of the population has access to the
Internet either at home, at work, or through a local institution
like a library, according to Johan Helsingus, chief executive of
Eunet Finland Oy, one of Europe's largest Internet service
providers.
<p>
   Merita, Finland's largest bank, already provides more than three
million account holders with highly secure electronic access by
computers.
<p>
   Telecom Finland, which is government-owned and the country's
largest phone company, is beginning a limited Internet telephone
service  &MD;  allowing customers to talk to each other through their
computer terminals. Since most such calls would be made through
local telephone numbers, the procedure promises in the long run to
become the cheapest way to call anyone.
<p>
   Laboring with a mood as dark as a Finnish December afternoon,
Dotty, 32, a recovering alcoholic who requested that his last name
not be used, surfed the Internet for an hour one day last month.
Ever since he learned how to get on the Internet barely three
months ago, he has come to the stately Rikhardinkadun public
library three hours a week to chat with other recovering alcoholics
halfway around the globe.
<p>
   Why not do his chatting locally, at Alcoholics Anonymous? ``Oh,
I do that, too, but the Net is different,'' he answered, barely
shifting his eyes off the computer screen. ``On the Net, feelings
are true. For me, it is more about self-help: a different kind of
therapy.''
<p>
   That same evening on a recent Thursday in another public library
at the Helsinki suburb of Vantaa, a woman was glued to a computer
in the airy atrium downstairs as she searched the Internet.
Upstairs on the second floor, Jean-Erik Ekberg, 27, was about to
start a class on how to use the Internet, in a room filled with
computers donated by industry and the municipality. Scattered
around were a freelance translator, a grandfather accompanied by
his granddaughter and grandson, and a banker on the verge of
retirement who had decided that Internet surfing would be an
amusing thing to do in his free time.
<p>
   Jarno Subanto, 26, who is studying educational sciences, has
access to a computer at home and at the university. He said: ``My
parents keep their portable computer in the bedroom. Some of my
friends move it to the breakfast table to read newspapers.'' He
does not actually have his own PC, but goes on line at Tampere
University, where Internet access is free. ``I am at a point where
I feel positively weird if I turn on my PC to find no e-mail,'' he
said. ``It means the connection is broken.''
<p>
   According to various estimates corroborated by universities,
Internet providers and telephone companies, 11 percent of the
population, or more than 570,000 Finns between the ages of 14 and
74, have used the Internet in the last three months  &MD;  a 21 percent
increase in the last three months.
<p>
   ``It's a snowball reaction that is fast changing people's
lives,'' said Petri Vuorimaa, the director of the Digital Media
Institute at Tampere University.
<p>
   Helsingus, chief executive of Eunet Finland Oy, said: ``In my
company, staff is wired 24 hours a day. When people get up they
start chatting. Two weeks ago, I asked my secretary to get someone
on the phone and her answer was, `Oh, he just stepped into the
shower,' '' he chuckled. ``But this is no joke. Being wired all the
time is the shape of the future.''

<p>
   HELSINKI, Finland  &MD;  Forget about pay phones here. Since nearly a
third of Finland's five million people carry mobile phones and the
number increases by 27 percent a year, fixed phones are becoming
something quaint, almost a relic.
<p>
   Indeed, even one-dimensional mobile phones are becoming a bit
old-fashioned. The latest cellular phones now send e-mail and
permit users to wander through the newsgroups and World Wide Web
sites of the Internet. Nokia's new 9000-model communicator, a phone
and computer hybrid no bigger than the bulky cellular phones of a
decade ago, allows Internet access to a user who may be riding a
train, sitting in a cafe or standing at a street corner.
<p>
   That such a device would be produced by a Finnish manufacturer
like Nokia Oy is fitting: This Nordic country is the most wired
nation in the world. Banking, shopping and socializing are
migrating from the real world into the virtual one at a faster rate
here than anywhere else; the habits that distinguish
high-technology centers like Silicon Valley in Northern California
or Redmond, Wash., are a national phenomenon here.
<p>
   Why this country, at one time a neutral buffer state between the
northwestern border of the old Soviet Union and the capitalist
centers of Northern Europe, became a microcosm of an electronic
future is unclear. The possible reasons being cited include the
country's high educational levels, the government's spending in
basic research and the long winter nights.
<p>
   Whatever the reasons, the facts are striking: According to the
latest monthly figures released last week by John Quarterman,
president of Matrix Information and Directory Services, a research
firm based in Austin, Texas, there are 62 Internet-connected
computers per thousand residents in Finland, twice the rate in the
United States. In the last year, Finland outstripped the former
world leader, Iceland (population 270,000), which now has 42 per
thousand people.
<p>
   David Farber, a professor of telecommunications at the
University of Pennsylvania, recently wrote: ``Technically Finland
is a leader in the telecommunications area. They have the first
public Internet access capability and have the highest penetration
of cellular in the world.''
<p>
   Finns use the Internet to chat about their problems and to
research academic subjects. They use electronic ``wallets'' and
so-called electronic cash systems to order postage stamps, pick
lottery tickets, bank, play roulette in an electronic amusement
arcade, do their shopping in supermarkets, read newspapers and
attend courses given hundreds of miles away.
<p>
   As in much of the United States, universities offer Internet
access free to all students, as do public libraries, which dedicate
one or more connected computers for an hour to anyone who requests
it. And municipalities, computer makers and the government all
subsidize the campaign to offer as many ties to computers and
cellular phones as possible.
<p>
   ``There is something decidedly unusual about Finland,''
Quarterman wrote in an e-mail message. ``Perhaps it comes from
being between the first and second worlds for all those years;
perhaps from a high standard of living and high literacy, perhaps
even from needing something to do during those long cold nights. I
don't know the cause, but the phenomenon is undeniable.''
<p>
   Quarterman also pointed out that the five Nordic countries  &MD; 
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark  &MD;  were among the top
15 countries in terms of having the most Internet-connected
computers per capita.
<p>
   ``Because Finland is so small, homogenous and has a high level
of education, Internet use is becoming a part of the democratic
access in society to government and institutions,'' said Minna
Puirava, a project manager in marketing studies at the University
of Tampere, a city about 100 miles north of Helsinki. ``Of course,
America has an electronic culture that is very advanced but it is
concentrated in small groups of the population. Here it is really
widespread.''
<p>
   Finland's education minister, Olli-Pekka Heinonen, 33, said
proudly in an interview that in less than two years the country
would be spending 2.9 percent of its gross national product, on
research and development in the computer field. This year, he said,
the government and private industry together will spend 2 billion
Finnish markka ($425 million) to educate 600,000 students and
400,000 adults on the use of the Internet.
<p>
   By the year 2000, he said, all of the country's 5,000 schools
will be hooked to the Internet. The objective: ``A society where
competence is based on knowledge, know-how and the creation of new
economic wealth,'' Heinonen said.

<p>
   When 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was slain last month, the case
drew the attention of newspapers and television networks worldwide.
It's not rare for a spectacular crime to draw so much media
attention.
<p>
   It is unusual for a victim's family to retain an elite crisis
management firm to help them cope with the publicity spawned by the
crime, and even more surprising that the crisis managers are using
the Internet to tell the Ramseys' side of the story.
<p>
   The firm is Rowan &AMP; Blewitt, founded in 1984 by former NBC News
White House correspondent Ford Rowan. Hank Boerner, a senior vice
president, said last week that the Ramseys' lawyers contacted the
firm shortly after JonBenet's body was found Dec. 26 in the
basement of their Boulder, Colo., home.
<p>
   ``They recognized what could happen with press coverage and they
wanted people who could communicate with the media,'' he said.
<p>
   The company sent two people to Boulder to coordinate media
coverage. At the firm's New York headquarters, other experts
analyzed coverage by TV networks, newspapers and on the Internet,
he said.
<p>
   The firm set up a site on the Internet's World Wide Web so that
media outlets could obtain information from the Ramseys. The site
was never intended for use by the general public, Boerner said, but
when CNN reporters learned of it, they posted a link to it on CNN's
site.
<p>
   Since then the site has received thousands of visitors from
around the world, though Boerner admitted that it contains little
information.
<p>
   This is the first time Rowan &AMP; Blewitt has created a web site in
connection with a murder investigation, but the company has used
the web on behalf of its more traditional corporate clients. For
instance, when citizens of a New Jersey town worried about toxic
chemicals in a Superfund cleanup site, the firm worked with the
cleanup company to create a web site packed with information.
<p>
   But another crisis management specialist questions Rowan &AMP;
Blewitt's high-profile approach in the Ramsey case.
<p>
   ``To keep people from jumping to the wrong conclusions, we just
operate in the background most of the time,'' said Larry Smith,
senior consultant for the Institute for Crisis Management in
Louisville, Ky. ``The very fact that they made it public that
they'd hired a public relation person ... that sent the wrong
message to a lot of people.''

develops material for the Microsoft Network, is on a mission for
Microsoft: to buy creative programming in the cutting-edge realm of
Manhattan's Silicon Alley. With an eye on the huge potential of the
Internet, the giant of the software world has come to Silicon
Alley, looking to buy original programming from New York's downtown
digital entrepreneurs, who create everything from interactive soap
operas to on-line magazines. (Nancy Siesel/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) UNDATED -- Jan. 21, 1997 -- COOKBOOKS-1-CLR, 1-21 -- For
those permanently seduced by cookbooks, the good news is that more

editors and sellers say. Lydia Cheng, top, the owner of Books for

<p>
   I've had plenty of tips in my time. Once, at a racetrack in
Arkansas, a nun told me to put all I could afford on the gray
horse. That's when I discovered that divine intervention does not
extend to racehorses.
<p>
   Computer tips are just as risky. For one thing, if you don't
completely understand the instructions, you can end up messing up
your computer. For another, there are plenty of tricks and tips
that work just fine but are more trouble than the problem they
solve.
<p>
   But a good computer tip  &MD;  like one at the racetrack  &MD;  can be
rewarding. Today I'm sharing some tips submitted by readers. I've
tested the ones mentioned, and they seem useful and worked fine for
me.
<p>
   The first tip comes from Mary Ellen Bacon. Like a lot of folks,
she enjoys sharing Web sites she's found with friends. Here's an
easy way to do it, in her own words:
<p>
   ``E-mail a favorite Web site to a friend. To send a Web page by
e-mail, while at the page, choose Mail Document from Netscape
Navigator's File menu. The e-mail window that appears will
automatically contain the site's URL, just a click away. If the
person receiving the message has Netscape Navigator, the page will
appear as an attachment in the message, and links in the page can
be accessed right from the mail message.''
<p>
   The next tip from Garry Daniell treads ground I've avoided: the
Windows 95 Registry. The Registry is a library of files that keeps
track of the configuration of your computer. I've avoided writing
about editing the Registry for two reasons: One, if you mess up
here you can cause enough damage to require installing Windows 95
from scratch. Two, I don't understand the Registry.
<p>
   But this tip is a pretty safe one, and it worked fine for me. If
you decide to try it, however, make sure you follow the
instructions exactly and don't try to make other changes unless
you're a certified wizard.
<p>
   ``When you open the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel,
you get a listing of all the programs Windows 95 can automatically
remove. Occasionally, you may encounter an item Windows 95 will not
remove. Some programs will leave duplicate listings as repeated
installations or upgrades are installed.
<p>
   ``These items may be removed from the list by using the Registry
Editor, a utility program which comes with Windows 95. To do so,
follow these steps:
<p>
   ``1. Open the Registry Editor (choose Run in the Start Menu),
type `regedit' (without the quotes), and click OK.
<p>
   ``2. Navigate your way to: HKEY(underscore)LOCAL MACHINE 
(backslash)Software(backslash)Microsoft(backslash)Windows(backslash)
 CurrentVersion(backslash)Uninstall by clicking, with the left
mouse button, each folder named above.
<p>
   ``3. In the left window, with the right mouse button, click the
folder (under Uninstall) that represents the item you want to get
rid of and choose Delete.
<p>
   ``4. Close the Registry Editor.
<p>
   ``If you now reopen the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog
box, the item will no longer be listed. A word of warning. This is
not a substitute for Windows 95 Uninstall Program as it only
removes the listing from the Registry. It does not delete files.
Any program removed from the Registry listing will no longer
function, so if you should happen to remove the wrong item, your
only recourse is to reinstall the program.''
<p>
   The two tips printed today are good examples of the clear
explanations that make it easy for novices to understand what to do
and why. If you'd like to submit a tip of your own, please e-mail
me at the address that appears with this column.

   Once upon a time, it was enough to have an e-mail address. But
nowadays, folks want their own home page in cyberspace.
<p>
   Personal Web pages are good places to store pictures of your
family, or links to your favorite sites on the Web. They're easy to
create and require very little attention once they're up and
running.
<p>
   But many Internet service providers charge extra for subscribers
who want a Web page of their own. That makes sense, because the
company has to provide space on its own computers to store the
documents and electronic images necessary for a Web page. That's
called ``hosting'' a page.
<p>
   Luckily there are several companies that offer to host personal
pages  &MD;  and, in some cases, pages for nonprofit organizations and
even small businesses  &MD;  for free. But make sure you understand that
you'll still need an Internet account to take advantage of these
offers. The companies give you an address on the Web and storage
for free, but not free Internet access. It's still a terrific deal,
though.
<p>
   In most cases, you won't be pressured to subscribe to a
commercial account, or to move your Internet access subscription to
the company that hosts the account. However, the usual consumer
rules for caution apply. And folks need to be extra careful with
any ``free'' offer. Remember, the Web is constantly in flux, so
make sure the offer hasn't changed and there are no charges before
you move your files to one of these free sites.
<p>
   A really good site  &MD;  if you can stand wading through all the
trendy talk of cybercommunities and such  &MD;  is at GeoCities, located
at http://www.geocities.com/homestead/.
<p>
   The notion is to create a virtual community, with cities and
suburbs. That's a neat idea, but you have to learn a whole new
vocabulary to figure out how this place works. All the information
to help you is there, but some folks would rather just skip the
trendy talk and get a free page on the Web.
<p>
   Things are a bit more straightforward at Achievement
International. The number and size of files you can store in your
free Web site are limited, but the directions for using the site
are clear. You'll find all the details at
http://www.achiever.com/design/freehmpg.html.
<p>
   Another place offering free Web page hosting and straight talk
is the Angelfire Home Pages at
http://www.angelfire.com/freepages/index.html. You click on one
button to create your page, another to edit it. The catch here is
that you pretty much have to follow a set format, so your home page
won't be as fancy as you might like.
<p>
   Truth is, a lot of newcomers will appreciate the ease of a site
like Angelfire and a lot of veterans will chafe at the
restrictions. To find out what kind of home page you'd like to
build and how much help you'll need, my best advice is to check
around at several of these sites and find the one that suits your
needs best.
<p>
   A good place to find a long list of sites offering free Web page
hosting is a page called, aptly enough, Sites Offering Free Web
Space at http://www.webbuild.com/(tilde)elkinsp/webspace.html.
<p>
   Still another page filled with hot links to several free
services is located at http://150.216
<p>
   .20.36/WebFree.html.
<p>
   Visit several sites that offer free pages before going to the
trouble of transferring the files needed to get your page up and
running.
<p>
   Check out each site carefully. Most really are free, but you'll
find that some places use an offer of free Web space as a come-on,
or make the process so complicated that it's too much trouble to
mess with. So cruise several of the sites and visit home pages that
are already located there before you sign up. It's no different
than house-hunting: You can tell a lot about a neighborhood by the
folks who hang out there.

 &UR; TECH TOOLS: ART PROGRAMS WORTHY DESPITE SHORTCOMINGS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   The wealth of art available for the computer continues to
expand, and today we examine a CD-ROM devoted to the work of Pablo
Picasso and another concerned with a great collection of American
art.
<p>
   Picasso, published by Grolier, presents about 600 works of the
Spanish-born artist. I suspect the program was made in France; it
has some of the earmarks of other French art discs I have seen  &MD; 
mainly a degree of disorganization and a manic tendency.
<p>
   The interface is odd but manageable. The primary means of
navigation are going straight through, in chronological order, or
by selecting a period of the artist's life and work.
<p>
   The art is presented well, but the information behind it is
shallow; the makers of the disc seemed more concerned with fancy
visual effects than enlightenment.
<p>
   We find that ``Demoiselles d'Avignon'' shocked the world of art,
but we are never really told why. We come upon a screen that shows
Henri Matisse lounging in his studio with a legend that says
``Picasso resumed his dialogue with Matisse.'' There is no
indication whatever of the dialogue itself or what it may have
meant to either painter.
<p>
   The program gets extremely noisy in the intervals between
periods in Picasso's life  &MD;  wrenching the viewer briefly from a
museum stroll into an MTV video.
<p>
   The National Museum of American Art, an arm of the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, contains an incredible wealth of
American art, not limited merely to paintings but encompassing
sculpture and fine crafts as well, and ranging from obscure artists
to the most famous.
<p>
   A MacMillan Digital CD-ROM called National Museum of American
Art documents more than 750 of the museum's holdings in a most
thorough manner.
<p>
   The interface is a good deal clumsier than in ought to be; it
has trouble shifting between the various ways of examining the art.
However, it can be dealt with, and the different tours and
organizations of the art are quite good.
<p>
   I especially enjoyed the tour of personal favorites presented by
Elizabeth Broun, director of the museum. She discusses these
paintings in a cheery, engaging and often whimsical monologue,
descending only occasionally into that solemn tolling of the bells
of symbolism that makes one's teeth itch.
<p>
   I wish the pictures were presented somewhat larger; in an
800x600 resolution they are just barely large enough when enlarged.
Some very fascinating paintings are so murky it is still difficult
to see what's going on in them.
<p>
   Each object is presented along with discussions, sometimes
several of them, taken from show or museum catalogs. Some of these
are most illuminating; others are hilarious.
<p>
   I wonder if Frederic Remington would have understood the
commentary about his wonderful painting ``Fired On.'' Would he have
agreed that the white horse at the focus of the picture is not
spooked by being shot at, but ``it sees itself vaporized,
abstracted, bodiless  &MD;  as the `mere paint' that it is.''
<p>
   In addition to ample commentary, there is a picture and a brief
biography of each artist. There is also a multimedia gallery with
short film clips of some of the artists discussing their work, a
most delightful addition. Not one of them, as far as I could see,
appeared to be interested in painting things like horses that
suffer angst attacks in the midst of gunfights.
<p>
   National Museum of American Art is a welcome addition to any
library of CD-ROMs on art; so is Picasso, even with its paucity of
information. Both programs sell for about $40.
<p>

<p>
   Mountain View, California, Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Sun
Microsystems Inc. introduced a new line of network computers aimed
at replacing traditional mainframes made by companies including
International Business Machines Corp.
<p>
   Sun introduced the new line along with a data storage system,
software and services. The systems will help Sun compete in the
market for machines that cost $500,000 to $2 million.
<p>
   ``It is a huge business opportunity for Sun,'' said Anil Gadre,
vice president of corporate marketing for Sun.
<p>
   The machines are designed to replace the traditional mainframes
that have become the center of many corporate networks. Mainframes
weren't initially designed to be used that way, although they've
been adapted to be linked with lots of smaller personal computers
or workstations to share data, files and applications.
<p>
   Sun, which specializes in workstations, servers system software
and other elements of the network that use and distribute data, now
wants to sell the most expensive piece of the network.
<p>
   Mainframes were designed to manage and centralize applications
and processing, and provide nonstop computing capability, although
they're not easy to upgrade or expand. Sun said its systems are
easier to integrate into a network because they have more
flexibility.
<p>
   The Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 system, with 16 processors,
starts at $870,000, and will be shipped in volume starting in
March.
<p>
   Sun expects to start recording revenue from these systems in its
March quarter.

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp.'s PlayStation video
game machine has sold out in Japan and supplies are dwindling
rapidly in U.S. and Europe, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. said.
<p>
   ``Although we're producing quite a large number, demand is still
surpassing supply,'' said Konosuke Shimizu, vice-president of
corporate communications for Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., the
subsidiary of Sony Corp. that sells the PlayStation.
<p>
   Sony increased production of Playstation consoles to 1 million
units a month in November from about 650,000 a month.
<p>
   Renewed demand for the machine more than two years after its
introduction shows that Sony's strategy of paying more to lure game
developers to the PlayStation format is paying off, analysts said.
<p>
   In Japan, for example, stores such as Laox Co. are rushing to
secure more of the machines before Square Co. releases a
PlayStation game this month that's expected to be a hit.
<p>
   Sony has attracted many of Japan's best game makers by offering
higher royalties. And Sony buys more of the games in advance,
reducing the risk to game makers of a flop.
<p>
   PlayStation sales had reached 5 million in Japan and 11 million
worldwide as of Jan. 8, according to Sony Computer Entertainment.
<p>
   About 600 hundred games are available for Sony's PlayStation,
compared with 10 for the newer and more powerful Nintendo64, made
by Nintendo Corp.
<p>
   Enix Corp., an independent game maker best known in Japan for
the role-playing game Dragon Quest, said last week it will stop
making games exclusively for Nintendo. The company will make its
next version of Dragon Quest for Sony's PlayStation.
<p>
   Square, which makes the popular Final Fantasy game series,
decided late-last year to develop its games in the Sony PlayStation
format. The next version of Final Fantasy will go on sale Jan. 30.
<p>
   Japanese electronics retailer Laox said most of its stores sell
their stock of PlayStation consoles soon after they receive
shipments. The company increased its order for PlayStations,
anticipating demand will grow even stronger after the release of
the Final Fantasy game, a company official said.
<p>
   The game machine was also sold out at all Tokyo stores of
Sofmap, the computer and software retailer owned by Softbank Corp.
<p>
   Sony's stock fell 80 yen, or 1 percent, to 7,580, less than the
4.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average.
Square Co. stock rose 120 yen, or 1.97 percent, to 6,200. Enix
Corp. fell 30 yen to 2,690.

   Salt Lake City, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Franklin Quest Co., a
time-management seminar provider, said it agreed to pay $160
million in stock for closely held Covey Leadership Center, which
sells productivity training books and other products.
<p>
   Salt Lake City-based Franklin, which sells products through its
catalog and retail stores, said it plans to name the combined
company Franklin Covey Co. It will have annual revenue of more than
$445 million and more than 100 retail stores.
<p>
   ``The opportunity to distribute Covey Leadership Center products
and services through the Franklin distribution channels will
accelerate our ability to reach more customers,'' said Stephen
Covey, chairman of Covey, which has printed more than 12 million
copies of books on leadership training and productivity.
<p>
   Franklin Quest shares rose 3/8 to 23 in early trading.
<p>
   The transaction, which will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests, has been approved by the board of directors of each
company and is pending approval from shareholders.
<p>
   The companies expect to complete the transaction by the end of
May.

   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is showcasing an interactive Internet
service at the presidential inauguration that may, oddly enough,
help law-enforcement officials to catch up with the studio's former
boss.
<p>
   MGM Interactive introduced True Crime Stories, a new interactive
Web show, on the National Mall in Washington at the weekend, as
part of the Technology Playground section of festivities for
President Clinton's inauguration.
<p>
   The MGM subsidiary is developing True Crime Stories with the
justice department, the treasury department and 17 government
agencies charged with fighting crime.
<p>
   The Web show, produced for the Internet, is to feature
multimedia files, including video, audio, graphics and text on a
wide range of unsolved criminal cases 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, and users will be able to post messages and take part in
on-line exchanges with guest experts.
<p>
   The new show could help the justice department catch up with
Giancarlo Parretti, who bought MGM in 1990 for $1.3 billion, before
losing control of the studio a year later when bankers called in
his loans.
<p>
   Parretti is now a fugitive from U.S. justice after failing to
appear at a sentencing hearing on Jan. 6 in state court in
Wilmington, Del. He faces as much as 10 years in jail after a
conviction on charges of evidence tampering and perjury related to
his acquisition of MGM.
<p>
   Parretti, who is now believed to be in Orvieto, Italy, a town
some 60 miles north of Rome, is also wanted by the French
authorities on charges of bank fraud related to the hundreds of
millions of dollars he borrowed from Credit Lyonnais to acquire
MGM.
<p>
   Ron Frankel, executive vice president and general manager of MGM
Interactive, said on Friday that he did not know if Parretti would
be featured on the Web show, which has yet to have an official
starting date beyond the introduction at the inaugural festivities.
<p>
   But, he said, ``the Internet has such a powerful ability to
present information to people,'' and he expects that True Crime
Stories will help keep people informed about fugitives and may aid
government efforts to recapture them. If the Web show did help lead
to Parretti's recapture, Frankel said his reaction would be that
``the system worked.''

 &UR; UNO RESTAURANTS SETTLES FTC CHARGE ON LOW-FAT PIZZA AD CLAIMS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Uno Restaurant Corp., the
operator of Pizzeria Uno restaurants, today agreed to stop touting
some thin-crust pizzas as low-fat food, settling a false
advertising complaint by the Federal Trade Commission.
<p>
   The FTC charged that Pizzeria Uno's television and print ads
falsely promoted the restaurant chain's ``Thinzettas'' line of
thin-crust pizzas as low fat when at least six of the line's eight
pizzas exceeded acceptable limits for low-fat foods.
<p>
   The case marks the first time the federal consumer-protection
agency has brought charges involving nutrition claims by a
restaurant chain.
<p>
   To resolve the allegations, West Roxbury, Massachusetts-based
Uno signed an agreement pledging that it will not misrepresent fat
content or other nutritional information about its pizzas. The
settlement didn't call for a fine or other monetary penalty.
<p>
   The FTC, which polices federal false-advertising laws, has
recently stepped up oversight of diet-related promotional efforts.
<p>
   Last year, the agency took no action after probing menu claims
by PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell chain, Brinker International Inc.'s
Chili's restaurants, Elias Brothers Restaurants Inc.'s Big Boy
chain, and Carlson Cos.' T.G.I. Friday's.
<p>
   In the last several years, however, food retailers such as Mrs.
Fields Cookies Inc., Dannon Co., and Grand Metropolitan Plc's
Haagen-Dazs Co. have settled FTC charges that they made false
low-fat claims for some food items.
<p>
   Uno officials couldn't be reached for comment. Uno shares rose
1/8 to 6 7/8 in morning trading.
<p>
   Under its agreement with the FTC, Uno is permitted to make
low-fat claims for food items as long as they meet federal Food and
Drug Administration guidelines for low-fat foods.

 &UR; AN INTERACTIVE ADVERTISING NETWORK OFFERS TUTORIALS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Are you ready for classes in interactive advertising from A for
Apple to Z for Ziff-Davis?
<p>
   Those lessons for marketers and agencies, which began last week,
are not being taught by a beloved pedagogue like Mr. Microchips.
Nor are they to be found on a Web site like
http://www.welcomebackkotter.edu.
<p>
   Rather, the tutorials are in the form of a campaign for Double
Click, an interactive advertising network based in New York with
sales offices in cities including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Toronto.
<p>
   The effort to promote the perceived potential of cyberpitches is
being created by Digital Pulp, a small agency in New York, and
carries the theme ``Building one-to-one relationships millions at a
time.''
<p>
   Double Click plans to spend slightly more than $2 million
through 1997 on the campaign, which will include print
advertisements, direct mail and of course appeals on its own Web
site (http://www.doubleclick.com).
<p>
   ``We want to be a catalyst, if you will, for the industry to
grow and realize its potential,'' said Lee Nadler, marketing
director at Double Click.
<p>
   ``We recognize the need to bring in the big advertisers and the
big money,'' he added, ``and that's going to take some time. Yes,
we're selling now, but we're also educating for tomorrow's
dollars.''
<p>
   Recent setbacks in the interactive realm are ``getting everyone
terribly confused,'' Nadler said, like the abrupt shutdowns of what
had been promising electronic publishing ventures and disputes over
measuring Web site traffic.
<p>
   ``The promise of the Internet has led to a rush to put up
sites,'' he added, ``perhaps before they had a purpose. People need
to know how to harness this.''
<p>
   Nadler, who has also worked for Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in
New York and the on-line service Prodigy, said: ``Door-to-door
sales was the most effective marketing tool because you got to know
the customer. You built a relationship, a dialogue. Now the Web has
that same power and same efficiency, but some people feel they're
coming in halfway through.''
<p>
   The first ad in the Double Click series makes that same
comparison to how Fuller brushes and vacuum cleaners were peddled:
``An introduction is made, interaction begins, questions are asked
and answered, products are sold.''
<p>
   The ad goes on to present tips on how to get the proverbial foot
in the door, suggesting for instance that the creative content of
interactive advertising ``be tested before you spend big money on
placements.''
<p>
   The campaign deliberately eschews explanations of how
interactive technology works, said Steven Sacks, president and
creative director at Digital Pulp, because it was more important to
``educate people on how this medium works and give them tools to
take advantage of it.''
<p>
   Double Click was formed in March by the merger of a unit of
Poppe Tyson, owned by Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &AMP; Eckhardt, with what
was the Internet Advertising Network.
<p>
   Double Click offers advertisers the ability to buy space on
almost 70 sites in content categories like business, entertainment,
news, search engines and sports, offering ``affinity groups'' of
consumers interested in those areas.
<p>
   Among the sites Double Click represents are one devoted to the
comic strip ``Dilbert'' (http://www.united
media.com/comics/dilbert/), USA Today Online
(http://www.usatoday.com) and the Internet Address Finder
(http://www.iaf.net).
<p>
   Double Click had hoped to have 100 sites in its network by the
end of 1996, but Nadler said that goal would now be met ``in the
next few months.'' He attributed the delay to ``strict criteria''
that required sites be ``well backed.''
<p>
   Double Click also customizes banners and other interactive ads
through a technology named Dart, for Dynamic Advertising Reporting
and Targeting.
<p>
   ``Dart allows us to recognize users when they come to a site on
our network,'' Nadler said. ``The advertiser tells us who the
target audience is; for example, college students in California. We
recognize those individuals and show them the message, within 15
milliseconds.''
<p>
   Perhaps a sequel to the hit film ``Jerry Maguire'' will feature
a zealous advertising agent who shouts, ``Show me the message!''

 &UR; TECHNOLOGY: `PUSH' TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES THE INTERNET COME TO YOU &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   I have seen the future. It may work but it is very pushy.
<p>
   Using catchers, whackers, finders, savers and casters  &MD;  software
that has a slightly different attitude from passively casual
browsers  &MD;  a nascent industry is trying to create a new model for
the use of the Internet, one that will have almost nothing to do
with hyperlinks, cyberspace or the electronic frontier. The goal is
to make the Internet come to you, not the other way around.
<p>
   This is being called ``push'' technology and is one of the
hottest areas of Internet development. Microsoft and Netscape are
planning to incorporate it into future software releases. Apple
plans to use it to automatically update software.
<p>
   And right now, custom-designed news reports are being pushed
into PCs, most famously via Pointcast with 1.7 million users of its
free software (http://www.pointcast.com) automatically getting
reports from CNN, Wired and other publications.
<p>
   There are even commercial programs like WebEx and WebWhacker
that offer virtually a utopian promise: The software bears the
burden of waiting on line; sites are downloaded for quick viewing,
free of crashes and pauses. Off-line dipping replaces on-line
surfing.
<p>
   The startling thing about the interest in this technology are
the built-in contradictions. It promises freedom from the very
aspects of the Internet that have been so highly praised  &MD;  the
spur-of-the-moment discoveries, the libertarian freedom from
predetermined form and content. Each advantage of the Net has
become a disadvantage when seen through the prism of push.
<p>
   During the usual ``pull'' usage of the Net, we grope about,
grasping sites with laborious dedication. The idea behind push
technology is that the viewer becomes more passive; the material is
thrust out of cyberspace, following a custom-built series of
requests. It is more like home delivery than browsing, more like TV
than PC.
<p>
   Push technology is more appealing for making money on the
Internet. Sites are guaranteed more visitors, which means that they
can offer advertisers more attractive audiences. Advertisers'
banners and images are inserted on the home PC, and may have
greater impact because they are part of requested material.
<p>
   Gradually there may come to be a kind of junk mail that will
fill Web browsers along with e-mail boxes. If the Web is to have
any economic future, it may be founded on the basis of pushing
rather than pulling.
<p>
   The promise of push, the value it adds, is its delivery of
organized, edited information  &MD;  information that has been
requested, things often hard to come by on the Net. And a wide
variety of experiments testing how much such a service should be
employed are in progress.
<p>
   The New Century Network (http://www.newcentury.net) calls itself
``the best of America's newspapers'' and includes, in rather
haphazard form, an anthology of news and information. (New Century
is partly owned by New York Times Co.)
<p>
   New Century's contents are designed by its editors and delivered
wholesale. A custom-designed result can be created on the Newspage
site (http://www.newspage.com), where an individual profile will
create a ``daily custom newspaper,'' compiling sources ranging from
industry trade magazines to wire services.
<p>
   Pointcast is almost completely a matter of push. Theoretically
it is like having a personalized ticker tape and news service: all
news, all the time, all over the PC.
<p>
   Imitators have been spawned, like Intermind Communicator
(http://www.intermind.com). One new pushmeister, Marimba
(http://www.marimba.com), promises to do for software updates what
Pointcast has done for news (Apple will be using its technology for
self-updating software).
<p>
   Push technology may ultimately be pushing the Net into a form of
computer radio, and indeed, one of the most conveniently pushy
objects I have recently tried has been the $149 Newscatcher from
Global Village Communication, which regularly delivers news
headlines and information to the PC via a radio network; its main
problem is the brevity of the information.
<p>
   Newscatcher was so appealing, though, partly because it managed
to avoid many of the problems of push technology in its infancy:
awkwardness, messiness, slowness. Automatic downloads can cause
system crashes, eat up memory, clutter the PC with as much junk as
accumulated magazines waiting to be read.
<p>
   It was great to be able to read the lead news articles in The
Boston Globe and The Los Angeles Times courtesy of Pointcast, but
downloads were more time-consuming than just leaping to those
newspapers' Web sites via the traditional, now crusty browsers.
<p>
   Not even commercial packages were completely satisfying. This
kind of software requires a user with very specific desires, with a
clear notion of which sites and which information need to be
regularly accumulated. But sometimes that can only be discovered
through browsing.
<p>
   Ultimately, the best form of push technology may be a sort that
makes the Net almost irrelevant except as a vast sea to be explored
at will by smart agents that fish at our request.
<p>
   The ultimate push will be the creation of custom-built channels,
an individualized on-line service that is built when a user is off
line. The numbers of channels is potentially infinite, with each
one bearing the stamp of the user's desires.
<p>
   By the time that happens, the Internet will have evolved into a
utility more than a technological novelty, a convenience rather
than a mode of consciousness. And as we channel-surf through these
programs, delivered for our entertainment and enlightenment, push
will have really come to pull.

<p>
   Paris, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Euro Disney SCA, operator of the
Disneyland Paris theme park, said first-quarter sales jumped 12.7
percent as attendance rose and visitors spent more money at its
hotels and attractions.
<p>
   Europe's largest theme park operator, whose amusements include
the Space Mountain roller coaster, said sales rose to 1.13 billion
francs ($205 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 1.01
billion in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Operating revenue from the park and related hotels rose 11.4
percent to 1.12 billion francs.
<p>
   Analysts said sales were better than expected, suggesting the
company is making strides in attracting more visitors and
generating higher revenue as it faces rising interest costs and
fees in the years ahead.
<p>
   ``A sales increase of that balance was above my expectations,''
said Jeff Summers, analyst at Klesch &AMP; Co. in London. ``That
suggests they are on line for park attendance of between 12.5
million and 13 million this year, which means they should be able
to offset increased finance charges that kick in this year.''
Attendance last year was 11.7 million.
<p>
   Shares rose 6.3 percent, or 0.75 franc, to 11.1 francs. Euro
Disney was the second-most active stock in Paris with 2.2 million
shares traded compared with a daily average of 406,739 shares in
the past six months.
<p>
   Some analysts remained skeptical, saying revenue must grow
substantially in the years ahead as interest costs and fees
gradually rise.
<p>
   ``Sales can go up but we don't know if they're making any
profit,'' said Nigel Reed, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in
London, who said the results were 5 percent above his estimate.
``We don't know the costs. They could have spent 100 million francs
on marketing and had a huge loss.''
<p>
   Euro Disney didn't release profit figures and declined to
disclose the number of park visitors or what they spent in the
period. It usually reports such figures in half-year statements.
<p>
   The company, 39.2 percent owned by Walt Disney Co. of the U.S.,
faces rising interest payments on its 15.1 billion francs in debt
in fiscal 1997 under a 1994 debt accord that helped avert a
bankruptcy. It also must pay royalty and management fees in 1998 to
Walt Disney.
<p>
   The company said lease and financial charges are set to rise by
200 million francs in 1997 from 103 million francs in fiscal 1996.
It said it won't raise prices this year, even though that would
have a ``temporary detrimental impact on margins.''
<p>
   ``This is a satisfying performance demonstrating our ability to
better exploit the potential of our low season,'' said Philippe
Bourguignon, chairman and chief executive. ``However, 1997 remains
a challenging year with no price increases and higher financial
charges.''
<p>
   Euro Disney said in November net income jumped 77 percent in its
fiscal year ended Sept. 30 to 202 million francs as more people
visited Disneyland Paris and stayed in its hotels.

<p>
   Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, does not have the
polish or erudition of most senators. He has no college degree, no
expensive suits, and few pretensions. On most days when the Senate
is in session, he can be found telling stories about his ranching
and farming constituents, people he once described as ``awful good
folks.''
<p>
   His legislative interests include Western land policies, farm
price supports  &MD;  and federal policy on encryption software. Like
many of his colleagues who represent rural areas, Burns maintains a
keen interest in technology and telecommunications issues.
<p>
   The interest of legislators like Burns  &MD;  not to mention two
House members from the Appalachian part of Virginia, Robert
Goodlatte, a Republican, Rick Boucher, a Democrat; Sens. Patrick
Leahy, R-Vt.; Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; and
John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.V.  &MD;  is based largely on the theory
that the information revolution is the best hope for economic
development of their remote districts.
<p>
   Their theory is that people and whole companies will migrate to
places with lower labor costs and a higher quality of life once
they are freed of the need to live and work in close proximity to
customers and fellow employees.
<p>
   ``Rural America will gain enormously from advances in
telecommunications,'' Boucher argues. ``We have a low-cost business
environment, an excellent work force, a superb quality of life.
What we're lacking is telecommunications services.''
<p>
   With a determination that evokes earlier decades of the 20th
century, when rural legislators pushed to get electricity and
telephone service to their districts, the lawmakers are active on
two technological fronts. The first is local telecommunications
issues, particularly making sure high-speed transmission lines come
to small towns. These lawmakers helped write ``universal service''
language into the 1996 telecommunications bill; some have gone even
further.
<p>
   Boucher, for instance, helped four towns in his district with
populations of less than 10,000 bypass the local phone company and
install their own fiber optic networks, which can handle far
greater amounts of information than traditional copper telephone
wires.
<p>
   On the other front, they are devising broad operating principles
for the Internet. These include such things as a new copyright law
that will allow publishers, film makers, songwriters, and others to
sell their products on the Internet without fear they will be
illegally copied and circulated. These issues also include
encryption policies that let companies and individuals protect
confidential communications from hackers or competitors.
<p>
   Rural legislators would like to see the Internet become a medium
where employer, employee, producer, and consumer can interact
efficiently and securely. When that happens, they believe, physical
proximity will be less important to commerce and employment and
more people will move to small towns.
<p>
   To this end, Goodlatte and Boucher are trying to write a new
copyright law that will function in a medium in which copying is
extremely easy. On a parallel track, the 65-nation World
Intellectual Property Organization approved two copyright treaties
in December that will be up for ratification in the Senate this
year. The issue of copyright law and digital technologies is
complex, and understood by only a few members of Congress  &MD;  many of
them representing rural areas.
<p>
   Encryption is critical to rural lawmakers because it is used to
encode and decode electronic communications. Software producers
believe encryption programs will be as fundamental to security in
the information age as the lock and key are now.
<p>
   The issue pits business groups and self-described
cyberlibertarians against federal law enforcement and security
agencies, which fear their ability to conduct surveillance will be
greatly curtailed. The rural lawmakers come down on the side of
business and the libertarians. Burns, Leahy, and Goodlatte all have
bills to ease restrictions on the use of encryption programs.
<p>
   Neither of these issues has come to a vote. They are complicated
and have not been give priority by the Republican leadership in
either house. But they both could see some action this year. For
now, their biggest champions are rural lawmakers.

 &UR; (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: rural lawmakers. &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   All of this interest in the Internet and technology raises the
question: are these lawmakers onto something or is this just the
latest economic development fad that will go the way of business
incubators and lavish tax concessions for foreign auto plants?
<p>
   While the answer is still unclear, there is some evidence this
may be more than a fad. After decades of almost unbroken decline,
rural America has reached parity with metropolitan America in
population growth. The average growth rate in rural counties
started approaching that of metropolitan counties in the early
1990s and caught up in 1995, according to an Agriculture Department
demographer, Calvin Beale.
<p>
   And while communications technology is not solely responsible
for this reversal of fortune, it certainly has played a role.
William Beyers, a professor of geography at the University of
Washington has studied a number of economically growing rural
counties and found them full of independent consultants,
contractors, brokers, and other types of professionals that use
modern telecommunications (along with some leg work) to serve
customers around the country and around the world.
<p>
   ``It's not just the Internet, though that gets all the hype,''
Beyers said. ``It's good old-fashioned file transfer and even
telephones.'' File transfer refers to a direct link from one
computer to another without the Internet.
<p>
   In one of his studies, he found that 40 percent of the new
companies in rural areas were primarily serving customers outside
of their regions.
<p>
   Many of them are small professional companies, sometimes just a
single person, that are commonly called lone eagles. They might be
a graphic arts studio in New Mexico that does most of its business
in Texas, or a stockbroker who has fled Los Angeles for the more
pristine environment of Washington state. Though not primarily
telecommunications companies, they rely on Internet technology to
gather information and talk with customers.
<p>
   In addition to these tiny companies, some major corporations
have made telecommunications-related shifts that have benefited a
few communities. Availing themselves of the lower labor costs,
banks, credit card companies, airlines, telephone companies, and a
host of other businesses have put big switchboard operations and
information centers in small towns. A call to directory assistance
in the Washington, D.C., area, for instance, is routed to a bank of
operators in Boucher's district in the southwest corner of
Virginia.
<p>
   But there is still no guarantee that rural America will benefit
any more from the approaching technological era than from previous
ones.
<p>
   ``It's not a silver bullet, but it's not a fad either,'' said
Bob Rowe, public service commissioner of Montana. Rowe said that
rural areas could benefit from the new technologies, but only if
people formed local networks and learned how to use them to their
own benefit.
<p>
   In this sense, information is no different from other
technologies. Those who learn how to exploit it most effectively
will prosper.
<p>
   Some critics point out that rural America already has an
up-to-date system capable of carrying vast amounts of information
around the world. It's called a telephone, and it did not stop the
exodus out of small towns this century.
<p>
   Others argue that while changes in telecommunications may hurt
big American cities, there is no guarantee that the beneficiaries
of this will be small American towns.
<p>
   ``There's no reason it stops in Fargo, N.D., or wherever,'' said
Andrew Blau of the telecommunications-oriented Benton Foundation.
``Maybe it goes on to Malaysia or Mexico. It goes right past our
borders, goes over our fence into the Southern Hemisphere.''
<p>
   But none of this damps the enthusiasm of those members of
Congress from rural areas who have latched onto the issue. The
emerging information age, Burns believes, will make his state far
less remote. ``We can't move Montana any closer to Denver or
Seattle or Minneapolis, nor do we want to,'' he said.
<p>
   ``This is our window, our door. It is our access to the world.''

 &UR; X'S, O'S AND E'S: RECRUITING ENTERS COMPUTER AGE OF E-MAILS,
INTERNET &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   In the crystal ball of Grapevine (Texas) High School football
coach Mike Sneed, the constant barrage of phone calls from college
recruiters dies down.
<p>
   His desktop no longer is filled with dozens upon dozens of
mailings from college recruiters. No more his hasty trips to
overnight delivery outlets to send off tapes for last-minute player
evaluations.
<p>
   Sneed is not a computer expert. He has never surfed the World
Wide Web or even sent electronic mail.
<p>
   But Sneed knows the future when he sees it. He believes that the
possibilities presented by the recruitment of blue chips via
microchips are endless.
<p>
   ``It would make things a whole lot easier,'' said Sneed, who
like most high school head coaches finds himself saddled with the
responsibilities of supplying footage of prospective recruits on
conventional videotapes.
<p>
   ``Maybe one day all they would have to do is punch up a kid on
the computer to view him in action. It would also save recruiters
time and cut down on travel costs. If there is a kid they are
marginally interested in, they can look him up on the computer. It
might save them a trip.''
<p>
   Today, Sneed's computer world is just a dream. College
recruiters still do their jobs the old-fashioned way  &MD;  featuring
long drives down dusty highways, stopping from town to town in
hopes of finding the next Heisman Trophy winner.
<p>
   But, considering that high schools and nearly every university
have access to the Internet, and that it is estimated that 15
percent of U.S. households use an online service, the vision of
online recruiting comes closer and closer to reality with every
passing day.
<p>
   Whether it's an athlete trading e-mails with coaches, or
recruiting experts holding ``chat'' sessions with fans, or boosters
setting up home pages to offer the latest information on their
respective schools, the computer and the array of services
available on the Internet are beginning to take recruiting into the
next millennium.
<p>
   ``This `is' the computer age,'' TCU coach Pat Sullivan said.
``With the Internet and the way it is, it's the wave of the future.
More and more kids are having access to computers. We don't use it
(for recruiting purposes). But it's something we are looking into
for the near future.''
<p>
   And for those who scoff at the notion of big-time recruits
having access to a computer to correspond with coaches, Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum has evidence to the contrary.
<p>
   ``There have been some big ones (recruits with whom he has
traded e-mails),'' said Slocum, who has communicated with potential
recruits using the Internet for several years now. ``Kids have
classes at school and get to fooling around. One kid got into the
Texas A&AMP;M home page and sent me one just to see if I would respond.
I did and we've corresponded several times. It's a big tool. I see
a tremendous escalation of this.''
<p>
   The online recruiting phenomenon has not yet engulfed the
majority of college football recruiters. Many, says Texas Tech
director of football operations Jack Tayrien, don't have the time
or have yet to become computer savvy.
<p>
   The use of computers to reach out and touch recruits, however,
has such future implications that online recruiting has been the
subject of legislation at the past two NCAA conventions.
<p>
   Computer-generated e-mail is regarded the same as mail sent
through the U.S. Postal Service. That means there is no limit to
how many times or when a school or coach can contact an athlete.
<p>
   ``You are limited right now by the number of kids that do use
it,'' TCU director of football operations Rick Villarreal said.
``But more and more have access. Right now e-mail is treated as a
letter, but it's better because you can have an immediate response.
And now when you can't call, you can e-mail.''
<p>
   Villarreal said ``schools that can hook into the Internet and
train coaches to use the computer have a definite advantage.''
<p>
   Texas A&AMP;M director of football operations Tim Cassidy, who said
all the Aggies coaches have their e-mail address on their business
cards, agrees.
<p>
   ``It's a great tool,'' Cassidy said. ``If a coach gets beeped
(e-mailed) from a prospect, he can respond immediately. We are
fortunate to have a football coach that's into computers. For guys
like R.C. that are willing to adapt, its a great tool.''
<p>
   While communicating via the Internet is still in its infancy as
far as coaches and recruits are concerned, it's fast becoming a way
of life for recruiting experts, fans and boosters, who use the
Internet to discover, trade and disseminate information about
recruits and schools.
<p>
   A scan through the National Recruiting Center, one of many sites
on the Internet set up specifically for recruiting information,
offers a glimpse of the mania.
<p>
   In the past three months, there have been roughly 59,429 hits
(the term for an Internet visit) on the NRC site. Surfers have
viewed home pages set up by newspapers, conferences (including the
Big 12 and Southeastern conferences), universities and recruiting
services like David Garvin's Heartland Recruiting and The Ultimate
Southern California High School Football Recruiting Site.
<p>
   Several companies, whose purpose is find scholarships for the
marginal athlete, also have home pages, where coaches can search
for players by sport, by position and by size and also view actual
game footage.
<p>
   Mostly, however, the NRC site is a haven for home pages set up
by fans, including Arlene's Husker Home Page, Husker Football
Freak's Home Page, Willie Wonka's Sooner Home Page, the Unofficial
Texas A&AMP;M Recruiting Page and Louisiana State's Recruiting and
Rumor Mill Home Page.
<p>
   The LSU page  &MD;  which is set up by Tigers fan Mike Scarborough
and features daily recruiting updates, commitments and the latest
gossip about prospective LSU recruits  &MD;  has had more than 7,200
hits in the past week alone.
<p>
   Bobby Burton of National Recruiting Advisor, whose 4-year-old
Austin, Texas-based recruiting news service went online this year
for the first time, said there is no doubt that the online
recruiting market is currently a fan-driven market.
<p>
   ``Last year, we were hearing what was going on the Internet and
were dumbfounded,'' Burton said. ``People were on there talking
about what we said. So decided to get into it. But it's definitely
more of fan thing than a player/coach thing. I got on there to do a
chat session and there were 108 people in the chatroom. It's
unbelievable.''
<p>
   Burton warns, however, that the fans' involvement has also
created concerns regarding the validity of information found on the
Internet. Tayrien agrees. He said his office has had to refute
information gathered on the Internet by boosters on several
occasions.
<p>
   The concerns aside, all involved believe the computer is
developing as a permanent tool in recruiting.
<p>
   Today, it's e-mail correspondence and fan home pages. Tomorrow,
it could be detailed player evaluations using digital photo imagery
and advanced scouting. Beyond that, no one knows what the future
holds for online recruiting, but the possibilities are seemingly as
wide as the imagination.

<p>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif.  &MD;  Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir
Mohamad, made a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley last week, calling on
the area's companies to join in an ambitious effort to build a
replica of the region in his nation.
<p>
   Speaking here before a group of Silicon Valley executives,
Mahathir sketched out a vision of a 25-year plan to build a
``multimedia supercorridor'' that would stretch south from Kuala
Lumpur, the capital, to the city's new international airport, which
is under construction.
<p>
   The 9-mile-by-30-mile area, which would include two new cities
and a computer network designed to exceed those in the world's most
advanced technology centers, would be created in part with generous
tax and financial incentives by which the Malaysians are hoping to
attract hundreds of corporations to build research and development
as well as manufacturing operations.
<p>
   ``Fantastic changes are taking place which make what was
impossible in the old economy of the Industrial Age suddenly
possible in the new world of the Information Age,'' Mahathir said.
<p>
   Mahathir met on Wednesday with William Gates, chairman of the
Microsoft Corp., and on Thursday with a group of Silicon Valley
leaders including Jim Barksdale, president of the Netscape
Communications Corp.; Larry Ellison, chairman of the Oracle Corp.;
Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc., and Lew Platt,
chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Co.
<p>
   A number of industry leaders have agreed to serve on an advisory
group for the Malaysian project, and at least one of the companies,
Sun Microsystems, has already agreed to locate a software
development group in the region.
<p>
   While American companies for years have been making
high-technology products in Asia for the United States market,
Silicon Valley executives are growing more interested in
opportunities to sell in the region, where economies are growing
more rapidly than in other parts of the world. To develop products
for these markets, many executives believe that the companies need
to base development staffs closer to them.
<p>
   Malaysia's plan is an effort to move beyond manufacturing to
high-technology development, and the prime minister pledged that in
addition to the financial incentives the project holds out, his
government was in the process of passing laws that would be
attractive to high-technology companies. He said these would
include new legal structures to accommodate electronic commerce,
intellectual property protection and a promise not to censor the
Internet.
<p>
   Several Silicon Valley leaders said they believed that in the
economic wars of the future, regions like the planned Malaysian
corridor would provide America with some of its fiercest
competition.
<p>
   ``This will be the new challenge,'' said John Morgridge,
chairman of Cisco Systems, a computer networking firm based in San
Jose, Calif. ``It won't be missiles that they are sending over
here.''
<p>
   This competition could even extend to sensitive issues like
computer encryption technology. In response to a reporter's
question, Mahathir said that because the United States, for
security reasons, had placed strict export controls on
data-scrambling technology it would be necessary for his country to
develop similar hardware and software independently.
<p>
   The government plans to begin construction on the two cities
before the end of the century, according to the prime minister. One
is to be the new seat of the government, and it is expected to have
a population of 250,000. The second city, to be named Cyberjava, is
to be an education and research and development center, and it is
projected to have 100,000 residents.

 &UR; THE LATEST FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By L.R. SHANNON &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Hyperterminal is the anemic communications program that comes
with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. It is an improvement over
Terminal, the Windows 3.1 ``applet,'' in that it handles more file
settings and terminal emulations, but it is strictly text-based in
a graphical world. If your computer came with a modem,
Hyperterminal is a way to dip into on-line communications without
spending extra money at the outset, but it will not do for long.
<p>
   Hyperterminal was produced by Hilgraeve, a company in Monroe,
Mich., which has now introduced an upgrade, Hyperaccess, a
full-featured communications program, though still text-based,
along the lines of Procomm Plus. It is, Hilgraeve says, a
completely rewritten 32-bit program taking full advantage of
Windows 95 features like drag and drop; its phone book looks like
Windows Explorer, it works along with Internet Explorer or Netscape
Navigator, and it has the familiar menu bar and row of icons. So
far, so good.
<p>
   I installed Hyperaccess from a CD-ROM in a few minutes (it also
comes on diskettes) without fuss and, as the company suggests,
called its own bulletin board. That way, you can register on line,
as well as download software and look at product information. A
couple of mouse clicks later, I heard: ``We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed ...'' I tried again. Same result.
Then I looked at the Confirm Phone Numbers window that appears when
you try to make a connection. The number for the long-distance call
was displayed not as 1 (313) 243-5915 but as 1 1 (313) 243-5915.
<p>
   Well, there must be a way to change the number. A box labeled
``modify'' appeared next to the number. The area code and the phone
number in the next box were correct, but the number in the ``will
dial as'' section had the erroneous double 1's. A lot of tabs were
attached  &MD;  description, ASCII sending and receiving, file transfer,
file usage, preferences, runtime values, colors, terminal emulator
 &MD;  that did not look helpful.
<p>
   I went back to the initial window. Where in the eight menus was
the place to add a new number. Properties? Nope. Transfer? Uh-uh.
Window? Naah. File, then New, of course. I made a new entry,
selected an icon for it and named it Try1, entering the company's
number carefully. But there was the extra 1. I made Try2, entering
this newspaper's 800 number. The extra 1 appeared; I tried to call
anyway. ``We're sorry. Your call ...'' Try3 was my own other line,
not long distance, and the call was successful.
<p>
   It was last resort time: the manual. I had skimmed Chapter 2,
with the instructions for installing the program and making the
first call. This time I read it carefully, without edification.
Chapter 3? That started with ``drag and drop,'' a neat feature, as
described, but not much use if I can call only within my own area
code.
<p>
   After several unsuccessful checks of the table of contents, I
dialed the phone number that Hilgraeve suggests for those who
``need answers quickly, or simply prefer talking to humans.'' It
was a Saturday, and nobody was home, though the recorded voice was
definitely a human's.
<p>
   I tried the Web site www.hilgraeve.com without finding any
information. I filled out a long form and left a message explaining
my problem. Five days later, an E-mail answer arrived: ``You need
to go into the dialing properties of the session and make sure that
you have the settings correct. These are the settings that are
being accessed to make the connection. The dialing properties are
not part of our program, but we access them as part of the dialing
procedures.''
<p>
   I went into the dialing properties box, which I had visited
before, and checked the settings, which looked fine. Then
inspiration hit. I typed the entire phone number, 1 313 243-5915,
into the section for local numbers, as if it were not a toll call.
It was a kludge, as we say, but it worked.
<p>
   Hyperaccess for Windows 95 and NT is $129 and can be ordered
from Hilgraeve by calling (800) 826-2760; it should also be widely
available.

<p>
   The Winter Consumer Electronics Show is always a glimpse of
things to come, but the 1997 edition this month in Las Vegas seemed
more like a masquerade ball. Computers dressed like television
sets, TV sets donned Web browsers, phones were accessorized with
screens and keyboards for sending e-mail, and intimate connections
with mysterious outsiders were the norm. In the so-called digital
convergence, do appliances or computers have more fun? Only your
programmer knows for sure.
<p>
   Screen phones were everywhere. Depending on the screen, the
keyboard and the internal electronics, they can display everything
from Caller ID to specialized information services, e-mail and even
the World Wide Web. Like many other items on display, most are not
quite ready for public consumption but should be available soon.
<p>
   Some include surprises. A touch of the redial button on a phone
in the press room instantly displayed the last eight numbers dialed
by unsuspecting journalists, along with credit card information
that would have been dynamite in less scrupulous hands.
<p>
   After using my own phone card, the only way I could purge the
information was to dial eight different local numbers before
relinquishing the handset. Look for a telephone to be named a
co-conspirator in a theft-of-services case someday.
<p>
   Phones that can send users' images were not in abundance,
perhaps because cheap systems are widely available for PCs. But 8x8
Inc., a recently renamed company specializing until now in chips,
demonstrated its first consumer product, the ViaTV System, a box
that promises to turn a TV set and standard phone line into a
picturephone.
<p>
   The pre-release demonstration did not bely the company's
admission in its recent initial public offering filings that given
the data speed of plain telephone lines, ``the human eye can detect
degradation of video quality.''
<p>
   At least the unit should be easy to install, which is more than
you can say about computer-based products. It should work with the
many products that adhere to the new videoconferencing standard
called H.324. But will Grandma and Grandpa pay $500 per box plus
phone tolls to see Junior babble in fuzzy, jerky glory?
<p>
   TV screens can double as decent Web terminals, as the estimable
WebTV set-top boxes from Sony and Philips Magnavox have shown. Now
many other big-name companies will offer competing systems,
including some built into TV sets. Like WebTV, some new systems
will tie customers to a single Internet service provider; others
will allow more freedom of choice, but connecting printers and
upgrading modems may remain problematic.
<p>
   Not taking this threat lightly, computers will be designed to
replace and even outdo mere TV sets. The Microsoft Corp. and dozens
of corporate partners announced plans for Entertainment PC 97
products with screens and a special interface big enough to be
watched at living-room distances.
<p>
   Along with receiving standard TV programming, the machines will
be able to decode and display special information broadcast in
tandem with some shows. The Cajun chef may invite you to download
his recipe for alligator andouille; the TV fisherman might provide
printable diagrams to help tell a sockeye salmon from a chinook.
<p>
   These machines should also be able to receive other data sent in
new ways. Special channels will broadcast information like stock
quotes, newspapers and popular web sites 24 hours a day; the
slumbering machine will awaken to grab whatever you have
specifically requested. Tucked away on your hard drive, even
bandwidth hogs like video clips should be quickly accessible.
DirecTV Inc. will offer bandwith capable of broadcasting up to 30
megabits (a lot) per second to users who have the company's
satellite dishes; cable customers may get data-only channels that
can deliver roughly a third of that (still a lot). The broadcasts
are, of course, one-way; e-Mail and the rest of the Web will be
available through conventional dial-up services.
<p>
   Machines like this are not expected before Christmas, but dates
do have a way of slipping. Last year's most eagerly awaited holiday
promise, the high-capacity, high-quality video and data disk system
that goes by the name of DVD, was sidetracked by copy-protection
worries and other thorny problems. DVD players for television sets
are already available in Japan and scheduled to begin appearing
here within the next two months at prices ranging from $500 to
$1,000.
<p>
   Computers with built-in DVD-ROM drives should show up by May.
Programming for them, particularly computer software, may be in
short supply for a while, and early DVD-ROM units may be
incompatible with certain current and future formats.
<p>
   Digital still cameras that link directly to computers continue
to improve, but no one would begin to confuse the picture quality
of a $500 or even $1,000 model with what you get from the cheapest
point-and-shoot film cameras. But tiny digital video cameras now
deliver stunning video quality that can be transferred with
relative ease to computer-based editing systems and can double in a
pinch to produce still photos. The over-$2,000 price of these
attractive units can be expected to drop over time.
<p>
   Weary and footsore, I tried the Great Escape, a Shiatsu massage
chair for which, according to the brochure, ``Panasonic used modern
electronic technology to analyze the finger movement of
professional masseurs in order to develop a way to duplicate it.''
Its aggressive pummeling did not come with a screen or a data
connection, but I bet next year's model will.

   He is sad that Britannica's personal link with its customers
through its salespeople has been severed.
<p>
   ``We never dreamed in our 200-year history that the home field
sales force would be eliminated,'' said Tamburello, who retired in
1994. ``When they shut it down, I was in total shock.''
<p>
   Ever a company man, however, Tamburello praises Britannica's new
products.
<p>
   ``They have the greatest CD-ROM the good Lord has ever put on
this earth,'' he said. Catching himself, he adds, ``I never thought
I would say that.''
<p>
   Tamburello is already nostalgic for a simpler age, when families
spread their volumes of Britannicas before the fireplace and
swapped arcane facts.
<p>
   ``You can't cuddle up with a computer,'' Tamburello said.
<p>
   But the question remains, can you learn more from a computer?
<p>
   Few want to sit and see a novel scroll by on a luminous computer
screen.
<p>
   But Walter said computers are ideal for quickly searching
through encyclopedias.
<p>
   University librarians agree, and they now are among Britannica's
top customers. Already, 3 million students attend colleges that
have Britannica available electronically.
<p>
   The electronic encyclopedias are a powerful educational tool.
<p>
   Say a student is asked to write a paper on why the sky is blue.
In a small window on his computer, the student types the question.
<p>
   Among the articles offered up by Britannica is one on John
Tyndall, the scientist who first explained the color of the sky.
<p>
   Using a traditional print encyclopedia, the student would not be
automatically directed to Tyndall.
<p>
   The on-line version of Britannica directs readers to sites on
the Internet as well.
<p>
   Gary Sampson, systems librarian at Portland State University in
Oregon, said, ``Britannica has hundreds of people working all the
time to create Internet links.
<p>
   ``The computer is so fast it allows you to scan enormous amounts
of material. Previously, you had to go through `author, title,
subject.' Now, it's a lot easier.''
<p>
   Still, there are concerns.
<p>
   Jim Neeley, electronic information librarian at the University
of Kansas, said navigating Britannica's compact disc is not easy.
<p>
   ``Information on any one topic is scattered sometimes under a
bewildering number of entries.''
<p>
   The electronic service may be easier to use than the CD but it
is costly. The electronic Britannica will cost KU about $14,000 a
year based on the school's enrollment, Neeley said.
<p>
   ``There is no question that students much prefer electronic
resources to print resources,'' Neeley said. ``For some period, we
have been having increasing difficulty getting people to look at
printed resources.''
<p>
   Goulka said Britannica is exploring new technology that would
allow a 17-fold increase on a disc's data storage by stacking
layers of information.
<p>
   Britannica is betting that computer users will soon grow
frustrated with navigating the ever-expanding Internet.
<p>
   Searching a compact disc is faster and more precise, Goulka
said.
<p>
   But in the long-run, Britannica believes the main avenue of
delivering information to users will be on-line, he said.
<p>
   ``For those of us in the content business ... this is a wondrous
opportunity to redefine information,'' said Goulka.

<p>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Embedded in millions of adults' memories is
the ``crack'' heard when opening a seldom-used Encyclopaedia
Britannica volume.
<p>
   We remember the heft of the tome, the feel of the pages rippling
through our fingers. We hunted obscure entries  &MD;  from ``Androcles''
to ``Zanzibar.''
<p>
   But the Encyclopaedia Britannica as we knew it is no more.
<p>
   Gone, too, is the traveling salesman who peddled its rich
offerings.
<p>
   Instead, the 32-volume citadel of Western knowledge, launched by
a pair of Scots in 1768, is quietly fading before the onslaught of
computer technology.
<p>
   It, like many of its encyclopedia competitors, is being reborn
(look up ``phoenix'') on compact disks and on the Internet.
<p>
   James E. Goulka, Britannica's chief operating officer, freely
admits that Britannica was slow to adapt to the new age. As a
result, it watched its revenues slip by more than one-third from
$658 million in 1991 to $423 million in 1995.
<p>
   A Swiss investor, Jacob Safra, bought Britannica a year ago and
is pushing its rebound.
<p>
   ``We were asleep at the switch when computers entered the market
beginning in the 1990s,'' Goulka said. ``At times I think of
ourselves as the world's largest monastery when Gutenberg showed up
with type.'' Before Johannes Gutenberg invented type in the 15th
century, most books were handwritten in monasteries.
<p>
   This year, Britannica expects 60 percent of its revenues will
come from sales of compact disc and an on-line version of the
encyclopedia. That is remarkable, considering that Chicago-based
Britannica did not get into the CD and on-line business until 1994.
<p>
   Britannica's far-flung sales force of 500 independent agents was
quietly dismantled last spring.
<p>
   Print volumes are still for sale  &MD;  at a bargain $995 per set,
down from $1,500 just a few years ago.
<p>
   But Britannica executives are convinced that the company's
products will increasingly pop up on computers, not bookshelves.
<p>
   Britannica CDs, which cost $299, are about the thickness of a
credit card and smaller than a coffee saucer. They run on
multimedia computers that have flooded the consumer market.
<p>
   Other companies have been faster to develop CD versions of their
encyclopedias. Microsoft's Encarta, Grolier's Interactive and
Compton's Interactive CD encyclopedias have been in the market for
several years and are far cheaper than Britannica. In fact, they
often are loaded into new computers along with other ``free''
software as an added incentive to buyers.
<p>
   But Britannica's CD is much more extensive, replicating the 44
million words contained in its print volumes. (It also is not as
visually appealing as competitors' CDs, which are full of
animations and video clips.)
<p>
   Furthermore, Britannica remains unique in that it presents
essays by leading authorities. Past contributors have included
Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Sigmund Freud.
<p>
   ``In terms of the depth of the essays, they (Britannica)
absolutely have more than the others,'' said Mark Walter, editor of
the Seybold Report on Internet Publishing.
<p>
   Britannica is also available on-line for $150 a year or $14.95 a
month. Users can tap into the on-line service with a computer,
modem and Internet access provider that connects their computer to
the Internet over phone lines. The Internet address:
{http://www.eb.com}.
<p>
   The advantage of the on-line service is that it is always being
updated, and it contains electronic links to 5,000 other sites on
the Internet, the vast worldwide network of computers.
<p>
   ``By increasing access, (Britannica) has reinvented the mission
of an encyclopedia, expanding it from a circumscribed set of books
to the authoritative interface to reference information on the
Internet,'' according to an article in the monthly Seybold
publication.
<p>
   This cybertrend is not without its pain.
<p>
   For 42 of his 69 years, Carl Tamburello of North Kansas City
pitched Encyclopaedia Britannicas to would-be buyers as they licked
cotton candy at state fairs and slumped in family room easy chairs
across the Midwest.
<p>
   It was a polished presentation made to a carefully developed
list of prospects. Customers were invited to read along as the
salesman orated his printed script.
<p>
   They were shown sample volumes and glossy pictures of the
multivolume set. Parents eager to give their children the best
educational tools signed up in droves. They were given a choice of
bindings that matched their budgets.
<p>
   ``We had a product whose name was so powerful,'' Tamburello
said.
<p>
   Tamburello rose through the ranks of Britannica to become
division manager, and for many years he worked from the company's
former Country Club Plaza store. In his career, he estimates that
he sold 3,900 sets of books.

   In its effort to prove itself a viable competitor in the
corporate computer-networking market, Netscape Communications Corp.
is expected to announce Tuesday that the accounting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP has selected the newest version of Netscape's
business-communications software as the standard for 17,000 workers
in its 120 offices in the United States.
<p>
   The deal is an important endorsement for Netscape, which made
its name with software for browsing the World Wide Web but is
trying to challenge both Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development
unit of IBM as the leading supplier of messaging software to
businesses and institutions.
<p>
   No terms of the deal were disclosed.
<p>
   It remains unclear how many other big corporate customers may
follow KPMG's endorsement of Netscape's software package, which
combines a Web browser with work-group collaboration and electronic
mail. The package, called Communicator, is still in a test version
and will not be generally available for several months.
<p>
   Still, KPMG's adoption of the software will broaden Netscape's
sales effort because the deal also calls for the accounting firm to
become a prime reseller of the software to the clients of KPMG's
information-technology consulting business.
<p>
   Microsoft has put considerable pressure on Netscape over the
last year by giving away its competing Web-browsing software, and
Netscape has countered by broadening the reach of its products to
challenge both Microsoft and Lotus in the corporate computing
market.
<p>
   Both Microsoft, with a product called Exchange, and Lotus, with
its Notes product, have many customers who have bought e-mail
software based on proprietary technical standards developed before
the Internet became the computer industry's de facto standard.
<p>
   While Microsoft and Lotus are rushing to overhaul their existing
software for use with the Internet, Netscape is hoping to leap
ahead of them with Communicator, which is based on the Internet's
so-called open standards.
<p>
   KPMG is a large user of an older Lotus e-mail software product
called cc:mail, which it will phase out over the next year as it
installs an internal network built around the World Wide Web and
Netscape products.
<p>
   Allan Frank, KPMG's chief technology officer, said that he was
attracted to Netscape because KPMG believes in embracing Internet
standards. But he stressed in an interview that he had chosen
Communicator primarily for its capability as a Web browser, not for
its e-mail and work-group features.
<p>
   KPMG is building an internal Internet network, or Intranet,
called KWEB, which the firm hopes will allow its employees to share
information about customers, products and strategies.
<p>
   ``We are using the Netscape browser as a window into that,''
Frank said. ``E-mail is just one part of the whole thing for us.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Others in the industry believe that Netscape may have difficulty
turning its market lead in Web browsers into a business that can
compete in the broader field of corporate computer communications.
<p>
   ``It will be interesting to see when it actually ships,'' said
Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer and executive vice
president of USWeb Corp., a large developer of corporate Web sites,
referring to Communicator. ``I've used it, and its off-line
abilities are not as rich as Notes and Exchange,'' he said.
<p>
   But David Smith, an analyst with the Gartner Group, a technology
consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., disagreed. ``E-mail is
going to be the battleground for the Internet over the next 12
months,'' he said, ``And I think those products that are close to
Internet standards are going to be the leaders.''
<p>
   KPMG will also become a systems integration partner of Netscape,
though Frank said that did not mean that KPMG would not install
software from Lotus, Microsoft or other companies if it served the
best needs of its clients.
<p>
   ``We don't own stock in any company,'' Frank said. ``We have
relationships with Netscape and we have relationships with other
companies.''

<p>
   URBANA, Ill.  &MD;  A hedgehog ran under the sofa in Steve and Cindy
Dorner's living room, dodging children and visitors, while two
large tropical birds gave a running commentary. Out of range of the
noise, Dorner, the man who invented Eudora, the e-mail software
used by 18 million people, was at work in his backyard office,
intense and, as always, alone.
<p>
   At the age of 34, Dorner has to his credit not only Eudora, but
also PH, an e-mail and telephone directory program used by hundreds
of universities and corporations all over the world.
<p>
   On a cold winter morning, Dorner brewed tea in the tiny office
that used to be his woodworking shop, and explained how an inventor
of software used by millions could end up neither rich nor famous.
<p>
   He was working at the time, in the 1980s, on the computing staff
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which gave both
the Eudora and PH software away. He was paid a salary, and nothing
more.
<p>
   ``To have other people use and enjoy your program is probably
what a certain breed of programmer is really interested in,''
Dorner said. ``That's the ultimate reward.''
<p>
   Growing up in St. Charles, Ill., he once wanted to write
fiction, but he ended up writing computer software instead. When he
needed a name for the electronic mail system he was designing, a
short story by Eudora Welty came to mind. It was called ``Why I
Live At the PO.''
<p>
   Working on e-mail day and night, he said, ``I felt like I lived
at the post office,'' so he named his program Eudora and transposed
the short story title into the slogan ``Bringing the PO to Where
You Live.'' It was the only hint he gave, and the name elicited
``all kinds of strange etymologies.'' Some thought it was a
combination of Greek letters, others thought he had named it for
himself  &MD;  the ``dor'' in Eudora representing the ``Dor'' in Dorner.
<p>
   ``If I'd had any inkling that this program was going to be as
successful as it has been,'' he said, ``I would not have named it
Eudora. Not because I don't think it's a good name, but because I
feel presumptuous having named my program after a living person. I
feel &MD;  &MD; .'' He hesitated. ``Embarrassed.'' He has never spoken with
Miss Welty.
<p>
   Her agent, Timothy Seldes, said the author had been ``pleased
and amused'' to hear of the tribute.
<p>
   But comments about the name of the program paled in comparison
with what Dorner calls his ``snake mail.''
<p>
   He had used a picture of a rooster with an envelope in its beak
to announce new mail on his software program, but he needed
something else to show no mail was waiting. He decided on a snake.
``The idea was that the rooster would have brought your mail, but
the snake ate it first,'' he said. ``It was a friendly little
snake.''
<p>
   The hate mail flooded in.
<p>
   ``I have had any number of people tell me they are afraid of
snakes, and it's horrible for me to put this snake in the
program,'' he said. Others were irate at what they saw as a slander
on the good name of snakes.
<p>
   ``I think that's amusing, because we have snakes, and I know
they're nice,'' Dorner said. A large snake lay in a glass case just
behind Dorner's chair, stashed there temporarily to keep it from
trying to catch the Dorners' newest exotic pet, a sugar-glider  &MD;  a
small, hopping marsupial from New Zealand.
<p>
   In fiction and in life, the University of Illinois has been a
creative center for computers and software. It was the birthplace
of HAL, the computer in Arthur C. Clarke's novel, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey,'' and in recent years not only became home to the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications, but also the birthplace of
Mosaic, the browser that transformed the use of the Internet.
<p>
   Mark Andreesen, the University of Illinois undergraduate who
conceived Mosaic at the same time Dorner was working on Eudora,
went on to develop the Netscape Navigator and became a
multimillionaire at age 24 when Netscape Communications Corp. went
public.
<p>
   There was no such Cinderella story for Dorner. He left the
university staff in 1992, only because he wanted to keep working on
Eudora.
<p>
   Qualcomm Inc., a communications company based in San Diego,
signed licensing agreements with the university for the development
rights to Eudora and later for the trademark, paying a sum a
university official described as ``not huge  &MD;  more than $100,000
and less than $1 million.''
<p>
   Dorner became a principal engineer at Qualcomm, working mostly
on Eudora. But he did not get a cent in royalties, because the
inventions of Eudora and PH were considered work-for-hire by the
university. Nor did he move to California.
<p>
   ``Cindy is not interested in moving to San Diego,'' he
explained. So he arranged to commute by telephone, and moved his
office into their home. At first, he worked in a windowless bomb
shelter, 8 feet by 8 feet, built under the house in the 1950s and
entered through a trap door.
<p>
   After two years, he moved into the woodworking shop, which has
windows and heat. He kept a time clock on his computer, at first to
prove to himself he wasn't working too little and, later, to prove
to his wife that he wasn't working too much. ``After four years of
working at home,'' he said, ``I never want to move back to an
office.''
<p>
   Charley Kline, one of the creators of the CU-SeeMe audio-visual
conferencing program on the Internet, counts himself as one of
Dorner's admirers.
<p>
   ``Steve is one of those people who can still program,'' Kline
said. ``It's a young person's skill. It requires intense
concentration. To do a good job, you have to have your mind wrapped
around the whole program. It's very easy to get distracted. You do
things and forget about other things and end up with bugs. It's
like running a marathon. You have to be constantly focused on the
goal.''
<p>
   The creative part of writing software, Dorner said, ``is
figuring out the real problem people are trying to solve and the
best way to solve the problem, which is not always the way they
suggest.''
<p>
   He gets about 100 e-mail messages a day and says that having 18
million users ``is very gratifying, but it can also make me feel a
little hunted sometimes.''
<p>
   ``I'm the one who has to, in the final analysis, deal with every
single problem, and I tend to concentrate on what's wrong,'' Dorner
said. ``There are days when I think that every one of those 18
million people thinks I'm wrong, stupid, and out to get them.''

 &UR; ADULTS R US WEB SITE SHOWS TRADEMARK PROBLEMS ON INTERNET &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  Toys 'R' Us officials went pale when they saw
the ``toys'' advertised on a World Wide Web site named Adults 'R'
Us.
<p>
   ``They wanted me to get that Web site shut down,'' said Neil
Smith, a San Francisco attorney who represents Toys 'R' Us.
<p>
   In September, Smith filed suit in federal court in San
Francisco, charging that by making inflatable dolls available
through the Adults 'R' Us web site, the San Francisco company was
undermining the wholesome image of his client in New Jersey.
<p>
   In October, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled the
reputation of Toys 'R' Us would be tarnished if the 'R' Us
appelation was used to ``operat(e) an Internet site and shopping
service featuring a variety of sexual devices and clothing.'' She
ordered the Adults 'R' Us Web site shut down.
<p>
   Although the 'R' Us case has been settled, it illustrates how
Internet domain names  &MD;  familiarly the ``companyname.com'' of
www.companyname.com  &MD;  have started to conflict with trademarks
registered under state, federal and foreign law.
<p>
   A little-known group of Internet experts and attorneys are
meeting in Geneva to finalize a new Internet name policy meant to
minimize these conflicts.
<p>
   In addition to solving the trademark problems, this
International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) must also deal with
resentment at home and abroad over the fact that one U.S. firm,
Network Solutions Inc. of Reston, Va., has a monopoly on issuing
Internet domain names for commercial purposes around the world.
<p>
   Worldwide domain name registration is so brisk that Network
Solutions could collect $100 million in registration fees in 1997
alone.
<p>
   To get a piece of this registration pie, several outfits have
threatened to set up unsanctioned name registries. But that might
subvert the Internet's traffic-handling system. The IAHC proposals
are supposed to head off this crisis, too.
<p>
   ``There certainly has been a lot of interest in what has been
proposed,'' said Sally Abel, a Palo Alto trademark attorney who is
also an IAHC member.
<p>
   To solve its twin problems of domain name competition and
trademark conflict, the IAHC has proposed the creation of seven new
classes of Internet addresses.
<p>
   These new classes have not been named, but might include
www.yourname.ppl, for instance, to designate personal home pages.
These new categories would join the ``com,'' ``gov,'' ``edu'' and
``org'' designations that now identify commercial, governmental,
educational and nonprofit Internet users.
<p>
   The IAHC proposal calls for a global lottery to choose 20 to 30
firms to get these valuable, new registration franchises.
<p>
   Finally, the IAHC has proposed that all registries publish
proposed domain names, then give trademark holders 60 days to
object before the domain name gets posted on the Internet.
<p>
   It may be a year or more before ordinary users experience any
benefits  &MD;  or inconveniences  &MD;  arising from the IAHC deliberations.
<p>
   But the process reveals the hidden workings of the Internet,
which is still run by ad hoc rules devised over the last 25 years
by the U.S. computer scientists who built the network  &MD;  rules that
are being increasingly questioned today, as the Internet becomes
the world's hottest commercial artery.
<p>
   For most of its history, the authority to issue Internet domain
names has flowed from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. IANA
boils down to a handful of researchers at the Information Sciences
Institute at the University of Southern California.
<p>
   Led by longtime Internet engineer Jon Postel, IANA oversees the
technical framework for Internet names. Actual registration,
however, has always been performed by nonprofit firms paid under a
succession of government contracts.
<p>
   During the 1980s and early '90s, Internet growth was driven by
the National Science Foundation, which gave colleges money to join
the fledgling Internet.
<p>
   Since the NSF was subsidizing the creation of new Internet
addresses, it awarded the registration contract. In April 1993, NSF
made a five-year deal with the Virgina consulting firm, Network
Solutions Inc.
<p>
   Although no one could have foreseen it, the invention of the
Mosaic browser that year created an easy way to navigate the
Internet, attracting millions of new users and sparking a rush of
start-ups seeking to stake claims to Internet names.
<p>
   Chicago attorney and IAHC member David Maher recalled his
introduction to the importance of Internet names. It came while
reading a Wired magazine article in 1994. The author had registered
``McDonald's.com'' as an Internet domain name to dramatize how
corporations were ignoring this new medium.
<p>
   Maher, who represented the burger franchise on trademark issues,
said the author gladly relinquished use of the domain name, but the
incident put companies on notice that trademarks were up for grabs
on the Internet.
<p>
   ``Only one party in the whole world can use a given word as an
address,'' Maher said. ``Extortionists were trying to grab names
and sell them to trademark owners.''
<p>
   What is really at stake when the IAHC meets in Geneva is the
Internet's informal system of governance. The IAHC members include
top Internet engineers and representatives from worldwide
professional bodies that deal with trademarks.
<p>
   But they have no legal authority under U.S. or international
law. Their only power  &MD;  though considerable  &MD;  comes because
thousands of network engineers around the world have generally
followed the decisions arrived at through the informal Internet
processes.
<p>
   Meanwhile, naming conflicts keep ending up in court. Palo Alto
attorney Dave Dolkas represents Zippo News Service, a six-person
Sunnyvale firm with a World Wide Web site.
<p>
   Dolkas recently returned from Erie, Penn., where the company
that makes Zippo lighters filed a trademark infringement suit
because the Sunnyvale-based news service used the address
www.zippo.com.
<p>
   ``Here they've been trying for two years to get this business
going and out of nowhere comes somebody who threatens your whole
existence,'' Dolkas said.

<p>
   Football couch potatoes who can't get enough of the week-long
hype leading up to Super Bowl XXXI, take heart.
<p>
   Like almost everything else in Western civilization, sport's
ultimate spectacle has found its way onto the World Wide Web.
<p>
   In fact, there are more Super Bowl-related sites (at least 10)
than Super Bowls won by the San Francisco 49ers (five) and
Pittsburgh Steelers (four) combined.
<p>
   By clicking on www.sportsline.com, for example, consumers can
check out the latest news stories, analyses, statistics, chat rooms
and video and audio clips about Sunday's clash between the Green
Bay Packers and New England Patriots.
<p>
   And that's not all.
<p>
   Fox TV's edition (www.tvguide.com/ sports/football/superb31/)
serves up a splashy page of photos, a virtual online tailgate party
and video clips of past Super Bowl heroes Marcus Allen and William
Floyd.
<p>
   The official Super Bowl site (www.superbowl.com), sponsored by

<p>
   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 7.7 percent after the
world's largest computer maker reported lower-than-expected sales
and earnings for the fourth quarter.
<p>
   IBM's stock fell 11 1/2 to 156 1/2 in early trading of 3.22
million shares, making it the second-most active U.S. stock.
Earlier, shares fell as low as 155. The stock had been trading at
ten-year highs in the past few weeks as investors were optimistic
about the earnings.
<p>
   ``IBM's been a major outperformer the past three or four
months,'' said John Rutledge, an analyst at Boston's Loomis, Sayles
&AMP; Co., which owned 1.1 million IBM shares at the end of September.
Now, ``it takes a rest for a while.''
<p>
   IBM yesterday said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
slightly less than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand
in Europe hurt results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Earnings were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their earnings estimates for 1997.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   IBM, like some other companies, was hurt by weak economies in
some European countries. Additionally, mainframe and workstation
sales were slow and falling memory-chip prices continued to hurt
results.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales
declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' Rutledge
said. ``The bloom is off the rose.''

 &UR; Does Aussie Media Mogul Have Eyes on Data Broadcasting? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Herb Greenberg &QC;  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   While Data Broadcasting is officially headquartered in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., most of its operations are in San Mateo.
<p>
   But it really doesn't matter where the company is based, because
nobody seems to care about what it does.
<p>
   For the record, its Internet site, DBC.com, is believed to be
the busiest site providing financial news and information, with
more than 4 million hits a day.
<p>
   ``We're making as much as anyone from advertising on the
Internet,'' says CEO Alan Tessler.
<p>
   And its QuoTrek unit delivers real-time quotes to investors over
a handheld device.
<p>
   Data Broadcasting currently trades at $7.13  &MD;  around half its
earnings before taxes, interest and depreciation  &MD;  making it ``very
undervalued'' relative to its peers, says analyst Joel Krasner of
Southcoast Capital in New York.
<p>
   Even when information services and Internet companies were on
fire last year, Data Broadcasting was lukewarm. ``We're cursed with
the fact that we've had earnings and cash flow from the get-go,''
jokes Tessler, alluding to investor infatuation with Internet
companies that aren't making any money.
<p>
   What about those earnings, which tumbled last year by more than
half? Tessler attributes that to a decision to plow money back into
the business. ``There will be a big payoff in the future from these
efforts,'' he says.
<p>
   Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man, apparently agrees. I hear
that in recent months he has bought a Data Broadcasting stake of
just under 5 percent. Packer's Consolidated Press includes
newspapers, magazines and television stations.
<p>
   Tessler wouldn't confirm whether Packer is an investor, and
Packer couldn't be reached.
<p>
   However, a recent story in the Sydney Morning Herald said that
``gaining a strong foothold in the new-media industry is an
important part of Packer's strategy to reshape his business into a
multimedia, leisure and entertainment conglomerate.''
<p>
   Data Broadcasting would clearly fit the bill. But any
acquisition would have to be friendly. Tessler and his partner,
Alan Hirschfield, control roughly 20 percent of Data Broadcasting's
stock.
<p>
   The duo has a history of buying and building business, and then
selling them.
<p>
   They got into Data Broadcasting in the early 1990s by purchasing
the non-bankrupt part of Financial News Network.
<p>
   ``This is the longest time I've been with a business,'' Tessler
says.
<p>
   And he makes it clear, that at the right price, the company
could be sold. ``And it will get sold to a strategic-type of buyer
to whom it makes some sense,'' Tessler says.
<p>
   He says that in recent months Data Broadcasting has had numerous
conversations with large U.S. media entities about taking a stake
in Data Broadcasting  &MD;  with an option to eventually buy the entire
company. ``We'd do such a deal in a minute, because we believe it
would be a major validation of what we're doing,'' he says.
<p>
   However, he adds, the media companies tend to be ``nervous''
about how Data Broadcasting can fit into their overall strategy.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Tessler complains that the stock is undervalued. What
would it be worth in a takeover?
<p>
   Krasner, the analyst, figures $15 per share ``if the deal were
done today.'' If the company's strategy works out, it could be
worth a heck of a lot more a year from now.

 &UR; TECH TOOLS: ART PROGRAMS WORTHY DESPITE SHORTCOMINGS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK WARNER &QC;  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   The wealth of art available for the computer continues to
expand, and today we examine a CD-ROM devoted to the work of Pablo
Picasso and another concerned with a great collection of American
art.
<p>
   Picasso, published by Grolier, presents about 600 works of the
Spanish-born artist. I suspect the program was made in France; it
has some of the earmarks of other French art discs I have seen  &MD; 
mainly a degree of disorganization and a manic tendency.
<p>
   The interface is odd but manageable. The primary means of
navigation are going straight through, in chronological order, or
by selecting a period of the artist's life and work.
<p>
   The art is presented well, but the information behind it is
shallow; the makers of the disc seemed more concerned with fancy
visual effects than enlightenment.
<p>
   We find that ``Demoiselles d'Avignon'' shocked the world of art,
but we are never really told why. We come upon a screen that shows
Henri Matisse lounging in his studio with a legend that says
``Picasso resumed his dialogue with Matisse.'' There is no
indication whatever of the dialogue itself or what it may have
meant to either painter.
<p>
   The program gets extremely noisy in the intervals between
periods in Picasso's life  &MD;  wrenching the viewer briefly from a
museum stroll into an MTV video.
<p>
   The National Museum of American Art, an arm of the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, contains an incredible wealth of
American art, not limited merely to paintings but encompassing
sculpture and fine crafts as well, and ranging from obscure artists
to the most famous.
<p>
   A MacMillan Digital CD-ROM called National Museum of American
Art documents more than 750 of the museum's holdings in a most
thorough manner.
<p>
   The interface is a good deal clumsier than in ought to be; it
has trouble shifting between the various ways of examining the art.
However, it can be dealt with, and the different tours and
organizations of the art are quite good.
<p>
   I especially enjoyed the tour of personal favorites presented by
Elizabeth Broun, director of the museum. She discusses these
paintings in a cheery, engaging and often whimsical monologue,
descending only occasionally into that solemn tolling of the bells
of symbolism that makes one's teeth itch.
<p>
   I wish the pictures were presented somewhat larger; in an
800x600 resolution they are just barely large enough when enlarged.
Some very fascinating paintings are so murky it is still difficult
to see what's going on in them.
<p>
   Each object is presented along with discussions, sometimes
several of them, taken from show or museum catalogs. Some of these
are most illuminating; others are hilarious.
<p>
   I wonder if Frederic Remington would have understood the
commentary about his wonderful painting ``Fired On.'' Would he have
agreed that the white horse at the focus of the picture is not
spooked by being shot at, but ``it sees itself vaporized,
abstracted, bodiless  &MD;  as the `mere paint' that it is.''
<p>
   In addition to ample commentary, there is a picture and a brief
biography of each artist. There is also a multimedia gallery with
short film clips of some of the artists discussing their work, a
most delightful addition. Not one of them, as far as I could see,
appeared to be interested in painting things like horses that
suffer angst attacks in the midst of gunfights.
<p>
   National Museum of American Art is a welcome addition to any
library of CD-ROMs on art; so is Picasso, even with its paucity of
information. Both programs sell for about $40.

 &UR; Web Site Helps You Cut Time at the Video Store &QL;

<p>
   If you've ever stood in front of the racks of movies at a video
store trying to figure out what to rent, do I have a Web site for
you.
<p>
   It's www.reel.com, and it opened for Internet users on January
8. Run by 8-month-old San Francisco-based Reel Inc., the site has
information on more than 12,000 movies.
<p>
   The purpose of the site, according to Reel's founder and chief
executive, Stuart Skorman, is to play movie matchmaker. It does
that by guiding you to films you may not have seen, based on movies
you've already seen and liked.
<p>
   When you first go to the site you're asked to become a
registered user. The reason, according to Skorman, is so the
database will remember you on subsequent visits to the site.
Registration is free, and Skorman said the company will not sell
your personal information or send you junk mail.
<p>
   Once you've registered, you can have the site tailor suggestions
for you by clicking on Reel Genius. You'll be asked to pick a type
of film, such as a mystery or musical. Then you'll get five popular
films to rate. (You can rate more films after that if you want, and
the more you rate, the better the site can pick flicks.)
<p>
   When you finish rating, Reel will provide you with a list of up
to 25 films customized to your tastes. The system uses an
artificial intelligence program developed by Entertainment
Decisions of Evanston, Ill., which works by recognizing patterns in
your preferences.
<p>
   I tried the site and immediately discovered a glitch. As a
mystery buff, I clicked on Reel Genius. Five movies to rate popped
up: ``Braveheart,'' ``Faust,'' ``Silence of the Lambs,'' ``The
Sting'' and ``The Godfather.''
<p>
   The trouble is that ``Braveheart'' isn't a mystery. Skorman said
the flaw of offering films in the wrong genre is being corrected.
<p>
   Anyway, I ranked those films, then decided to rank another five.
The resulting recommendations were surprisingly on target. The
site's top pick for me was ``The Usual Suspects,'' which I had seen
and enjoyed.
<p>
   Reel also offers a quick synopsis of new movies in theaters and
video stores, as well as summaries of reviews by critics from the
New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today, as well as TV's
Roger Ebert.
<p>
   Skorman said it's an interpretation of the review that's done by
his staff. ``It's our opinion of their opinion,'' he said.
<p>
   Skorman has been a movie matchmaker since his days at the helm
of Empire Video Superstores, which he founded 12 years ago in
Vermont. He sold his stake in the chain to Blockbuster Video three
years ago, and used the $4 million from the deal to start Reel.
<p>
   Reel currently has eight full-time employees and 50 part-time
workers doing everything from graphic design to writing to being
movie experts. Many of the employees once worked at video stores.
<p>
   There is no advertising on the site. Reel plans to make money by
starting a virtual video store, where you'll be able to rent or buy
videos by mail. Users eventually may even be able to download
movies via the Internet.

 &UR; INTEL TO ENTICE SUPER BOWL VIEWERS TO NEW KIND OF CHIP &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By STUART ELLIOTT &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<p>
   Consumers are used to watching commercials for snack chips
during the Super Bowl. As they watch Super Bowl XXXI on Sunday,
they will see  &MD;  for the first time  &MD;  a commercial for computer
chips, too.
<p>
   Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of microprocessors, will
become a Super Bowl advertiser with a spot promoting the MMX, the
version of its popular Pentium chip that was introduced on Jan. 8.
<p>
   The commercial, which depicts dirty dancing in a ``clean room''
inside an Intel chip-fabrication factory, is one of four pitching
the MMX, which features technology to improve multimedia
performance.
<p>
   The four spots are part of a worldwide television, print and
interactive campaign that begins Wednesday night in North America
and expands in February and March into Asia and Europe. The
campaign is by the longtime Intel agency, Euro RSCG Dahlin Smith
White in Salt Lake City, a unit of Havas Advertising.
<p>
   Although Intel offered no figure for the campaign's total budget
as the ads continue around the world through May, the company plans
to spend $25 million to $30 million just in North America. That
market accounts for about 40 percent of its worldwide sales.
<p>
   Anyone surprised that a microchip is being hawked on the Super
Bowl ought to read the next two paragraphs sitting down. For Intel
and Dahlin Smith are pushing the envelope for marketing
high-technology products even further by using, in two of the four
MMX commercials, a celebrity: the actor Jason Alexander, who plays
the whiny nebbish George on the hit NBC sitcom ``Seinfeld.'' That
star turn is also a first for Intel.
<p>
   And the campaign is infused with the kind of offbeat humor
rarely found in computer advertising. That's typified by the song
on the soundtrack of the two commercials without Alexander: the
disco tune ``Play That Funky Music (White Boy)'' by Wild Cherry,
which set platform shoes a-tapping in 1976.
<p>
   The MMX effort is indicative of the significant shift in the
marketing of computers and related products as agencies
increasingly adopt the methods used to sell consumer packaged
goods. After all, about the only ploy left unexploited when
Microsoft Corp. introduced the Windows 95 operating system was
matchbook-cover advertising.
<p>
   In fact, Intel and Dahlin Smith are pioneers in such efforts.
They teamed up to transform the computer chip from a commodity to a
branded product with the ubiquitous campaign that carries the
``Intel inside'' theme.
<p>
   ``The computer has been moving from being a business product in
the late '80s to being a business and consumer product,'' Dennis
Carter, vice president and marketing director at Intel in Santa
Clara, Calif., said Tuesday.
<p>
   ``We believe advertising is an incredibly effective medium for
communicating with consumers and educating them about new
products,'' said Carter, who offered a preview of the campaign in
an interview. ``The fact it's a technology product is tangential.''
<p>
   The initial spot peddling the MMX, appearing Wednesday night on
prime-time, sports and news programs, is one of the two in which
Alexander figures; the other will run on Sunday before or after the
Super Bowl.
<p>
   In both spots, Alexander demonstrates the potential  &MD;  and
pitfalls  &MD;  of using a personal computer powered with the MMX chip
for video conferences. He tries to impress blind dates and, in the
quintessential George manner, fails miserably.
<p>
   ``We did not start out with a goal to use a celebrity,'' Jon
White, executive vice president and executive creative director at
Dahlin Smith, said in a telephone interview from Salt Lake City.
``Jason is a personality who's playing a character we felt he could
play better than anybody.''
<p>
   As for the disco tune in the spots not featuring Alexander, said
Ann Lewnes, worldwide advertising director at Intel, ``music is a
great way to relate to an audience.''
<p>
   ``And a song like that,'' she added, ``appeals to Generation X
and the younger boomers, who are among the most avid computer
users.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   That appeal may be even broader, as White suggested.
<p>
   ``My 13-year-old daughter, Rachel, was at a Utah Jazz game last
night,'' he said, ``and she told me they played `Play That Funky
Music' during one of the timeouts. As she was dancing, all her
friends asked, `How do you know that song?'''
<p>
   The two funky-music spots take place in an Intel clean room,
where ``highly trained professionals are engaged,'' a voice-over
announcer says, ``in the extremely precise process of adding fun to
the Pentium processor.'' As the disco beat intensifies, he asserts
that the MMX ``will make your multimedia dance.''
<p>
   To underscore that assertion, the technicians are wearing
``bunny suits''  &MD;  the garments meant to ensure sterility  &MD;  that are
shiny gold, silver, red and blue rather than the standard-issue
dull white.
<p>
   The Intel campaign is not Alexander's first foray onto Madison
Avenue. He also portrays a character nicknamed Pretzel Boy in
advertising for the Rold Gold brand sold by Frito-Lay, the
snack-chip unit of Pepsico Inc.
<p>
   Coincidentally, Pretzel Boy has appeared in Super Bowl spots,
though Rold Gold will be absent from the game on Sunday; Frito-Lay
will instead advertise brands like Baked Lay's and Tostitos.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Microsoft is a corporate behemoth with 20,000 workers
famous for their Dockers office wear and their cool rationality,
whether analyzing a line of computer code or a marketing plan.
<p>
   Silicon Alley is the name given to the confluence of hundreds of
small companies staffed by creative young people drawn to New York
City. In Manhattan lofts where once they might have formed little
magazines or rock-and-roll bands, today they are putting up Web
sites.
<p>
   Now, with an eye on the huge potential of the Internet, the
giant of the software world has come to Silicon Alley, looking to
buy original programming from New York's downtown digital
entrepreneurs, who create everything from interactive soap operas
to on-line magazines.
<p>
   But the seduction has not always been smooth. While the
loft-dwelling designers are tempted by Microsoft Corp.'s riches,
they remain wary.
<p>
   ``As a software company, they've got a reputation for being very
heavy handed,'' said John Borthwick, the chief executive of WP
Studios, which publishes Total New York, an on-line guide to the
city. ``There is an enormous cultural shift that has to take
place.''
<p>
   Already that may be happening, and Microsoft is the one that
seems to be yielding, shedding some of its tech-driven nerdiness
for a hipper style.
<p>
   For evidence, look no further than two of the first new-media
locals it has gone into business with: John Hulme and Michael
Wexler, writers whose previous work was the book ``Baked Potatoes:
A Potsmokers' Guide to Film and Video.''
<p>
   For the last several months, Microsoft has been combing Silicon
Alley for proposals for its Microsoft Network, the third-largest
on-line service, behind America Online and Compuserve. Last month,
it was revamped as both a jumping-off platform for the Internet and
a source of original news and entertainment. Microsoft plans to
spend $200 million to $300 million in the next few years on
Microsoft Network, with a nice chunk of the money earmarked for
programming from independent companies.
<p>
   That has caught the attention of the estimated 18,000 digital
workers in computer-cluttered lofts in downtown Manhattan, workers
whose companies have names like Avalanche, Razorfish and Radical
Media. It seems that nearly all of them have met with Lara Stein,
the preternaturally energetic executive in New York for Microsoft
Multimedia Productions, or M3P, which develops material for the
Microsoft Network.
<p>
   ``I probably get 30 to 40 proposals a week,'' Ms. Stein said in
her office in Worldwide Plaza, at Eighth Avenue and 49th Street,
where two books displayed side by side represent the worlds she
bestrides: ``The Road Ahead'' by Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft,
and a work by H.R. Giger, the cult artist who created the slick,
machinelike creatures of the ``Alien'' movies.
<p>
   Although Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has long had a New
York office to sell software to corporate clients, Ms. Stein's
arrival in August was part of the company's ballyhooed evolution
into a media company.
<p>
   She shares a newly remodeled floor with outposts of two
Microsoft on-line publishing ventures: a bureau of the political
magazine Slate, and New York Sidewalk, a guide to the city's
cultural life that will be available free on the Web beginning this
spring.
<p>
   The design of the new office space seems a conscious attempt to
evoke a hip Manhattan media company. The lighting is dim, the
black-painted overhead air ducts are exposed, and the reception
area is enclosed in high-tech metal mesh.
<p>
   Ms. Stein, 30, a native of South Africa, is accessible to nearly
anyone with a digital brainstorm  &MD;  not just multimedia
professionals, but writers and artists with scant on-line
experience, and even chefs, bankers and students who find her by
word of mouth.
<p>
   On a typical day last week, she had a breakfast meeting in a
coffee shop with Ian Kerner, a teacher of interactive writing at
New York University who had successfully pitched Microsoft his idea
for ``24-7,'' a kind of ``NYPD Blue'' of the Web, and wanted to
offer another project.
<p>
   Later, during a cab ride to her office, she composed e-mail on
her laptop computer. And late in the day she spoke by phone with
Tod Machover, the composer of the audience-participation,
Internet-connected ``Brain Opera,'' which was presented last summer
at Lincoln Center, and which Ms. Stein hoped might be adaptable to
the Microsoft Network.
<p>
   ``A lot of what I'm doing is planting seeds and educating people
who aren't in the industry,'' she said.
<p>
   But though many have pitched ideas, few projects have actually
been given the green light, and the paucity of deals struck  &MD;  only
seven or eight so far  &MD;  is an indication of the sometimes awkward
mating dance between Microsoft and Silicon Alley.
<p>
   Last fall at the Cool Site of the Year Awards, a kind of on-line
Oscar ceremony held at an East Village nightclub, the nomination of
the Microsoft program Explorer for Cool Internet Browser was met
with hisses and catcalls. It was a telling expression of Silicon
Alley's uneasiness about the giant Microsoft.
<p>
   ``Everything that's fabulous about New York  &MD;  that it's a source
of individuality, that it's quirky, that it's less pitch-driven  &MD; 
is rebelling against the Microsoft model, which is a high-concept
L.A. model,'' said Kerner of NYU.
<p>
   Ms. Stein acknowledged that there is anti-Microsoft sentiment in
Silicon Alley, as elsewhere in the software world  &MD;  it is the fear
of becoming dinner for an $80 billion company whose famous motto as
it stalks the Internet market is ``embrace and extend.''
<p>
   ``I can't change that overnight,'' said Ms. Stein, who was hired
last year from Marvel's interactive licensing division. ``I'm just
one person. I'm trying to be as accessible as possible.''

<p>
   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock will begin a months-long decline today amid
disappointment with the computer maker's revenue growth in the
fourth quarter, investors and analysts said.
<p>
   ``It will be down 5 points,'' said John Rutledge, an analyst at
Boston's Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., which owned 1.1 million IBM shares
at the end of September. ``IBM's been a major outperformer the past
three or four months.'' Now, ``it takes a rest for a while,'' he
said.
<p>
   Shares of IBM rose 1 to 168 yesterday, a gain of 64 percent
during the past 12 months. The stock has climbed to its highest
levels in almost 10 years and is close to its all-time high of 174
3/4, reached in August 1987.
<p>
   IBM shares traded in Germany and Switzerland fell as low as 162
1/4.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   IBM yesterday said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
slightly less than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand
in Europe hurt results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Earnings were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   IBM, like some other companies, was hurt by weak economies in
some European countries. Additionally, mainframe and workstation
sales were slow and falling memory-chip prices continued to hurt
results.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales
declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' Rutledge
said. ``The bloom is off the rose.''

   At the core of the culture clash between Microsoft and some in
Silicon Alley is the difference between a giant company where
software is created by legions of anonymous programmers and the New
York new media's roots in the art and publishing worlds, where
individual authorship is highly valued.
<p>
   In practical terms, it has boiled down to a dispute over on-line
rights to the shows Microsoft is commissioning. Microsoft insists
on owning the rights, but many Silicon Alley developers say the
company is unwilling to pay enough.
<p>
   Jeff Dachis, co-founder and chief executive of Razorfish, a
leading Web site designer, said:
<p>
   ``What their problem is in the community now is that they ask
for a lot of stuff  &MD;  they want to own all the rights and don't want
to pay necessarily for the right of ownership, and thus the deal
they've been laying on the table isn't worth it.''
<p>
   Microsoft's position is that because no one yet has figured how
to make money from Web-based news and entertainment, the company
must own on-line rights to justify its investment.
<p>
   ``I know a lot of people have had trouble with this,'' Ms. Stein
said. ``Talking to artists about owning their baby is a hard thing.
What I've said is, `Don't bring me your baby. Bring me something
else.' ''
<p>
   Timothy Nye, the founder of the Sunshine Interactive Network,
which is producing ``Vanishing Point,'' a nonfiction on-line
``documentary'' for Microsoft that is the creation of Hulme and
Wexler, the pot-guide authors, said that Microsoft's position is
fair. ``I think Microsoft compensates people they're working with
extremely generously,'' he said, ``and is buying rights that at the
moment have no upside.''
<p>
   For all the grousing, very few Silicon Alley entrepreneurs have
declined to propose projects to Microsoft. On the contrary, most
seem eager to form a partnership.
<p>
   In a period of turmoil in the on-line industry, with many small
Web publishing ventures faced with going out of business,
Microsoft's willingness to sustain big losses on Internet content
is a strong vote of confidence in Silicon Alley's future.
<p>
   ``Microsoft is spending money and that helps developers advance
technically, advance financially and in some cases stay alive,''
said Jonathan Trumper, a new media agent at William Morris with
many Silicon Alley clients.
<p>
   Douglas Rushkoff, an author who pitched Ms. Stein an idea for an
on-line site about the occult, and is awaiting a reply, said with
tongue only slightly in cheek, ``I was pricing my Mercedes
already.''
<p>
   Microsoft is anticipating the day when the market for its
Windows computer operating systems is saturated, and the company is
making a multibillion-dollar bet that the Internet can become a new
medium similar to television or publishing.
<p>
   The company's most high-profile media effort has been the
struggling year-old Microsoft Network, which has 1.6 million
subscribers.
<p>
   For those who have been showered in Microsoft stardust, the
enthusiasm runs high. ``It's huge, definitely, it's really exciting
for us,'' said David Grossman, a partner in Rare Medium, a
15-person Web shop housed in an airy loft in the Flatiron district
that got the go-ahead for an interactive game. ``Microsoft has such
a large stature, and yet here they are taking a folksy approach and
reaching out to the young development community.''
<p>
   That is the bottom line all over Silicon Alley: the future of
both the software giant and the home-grown upstarts may well depend
on Microsoft's success.

<p>
   Islandia, New York, Jan. 21 (Bloomberg)-- Computer Associates
International Inc. said third-quarter operating earnings rose 25
percent, slightly beating analysts' estimates.
<p>
   Profit from operations rose to $284.7 million, or 75 cents a
share, from net income of $227.2 million, or 60 cents, in the
year-earlier quarter. Including a charge of $598 million, or $1.57
a share, for the acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc., the company
had a loss was $313.3 million, or 86 cents a share.
<p>
   Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 5 percent to $1.05
billion from $1 billion.
<p>
   Wall Street expected the software maker to post earnings of 74
cents a share, excluding the charges, based on the average estimate
of 13 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Computer Associates shares rose 1 5/8 to 46. It released the
earnings statement after the close of U.S. stock-market trading.
<p>
   The Islandia, New York-based company warned last month of
disappointing sales as it switches to new products in Europe.
Analysts had expected revenue of $1.2 billion before the company's
warning.
<p>
   Computer Associates said it would take one or two quarters to
bring the European business up to speed. The company has been
shifting its focus to selling client-server software that manages
computer networks and scaling back products for large mainframe
computers.
<p>
   The company's software is used to monitor information sent over
computer networks.
<p>
   Computer Associates said its European sales force hasn't been
aggressive enough in building the new business, resulting in
lower-than-expected revenue.
<p>
   ``In Europe, it's a question of making the transition and
executing,'' said Sanjay Kumar, Computer Associates's president.
``We made some costly mistakes.''
<p>
   Computer Associates faces stiff competition, especially from
International Business Machines Corp.'s Tivoli unit, which had
strong sales during the quarter. Computer Associates said it isn't
losing contracts to IBM.
<p>
   Still, investors and analysts were cautious on a conference call
after earnings were released, questioning whether mainframe growth
was slowing and how Computer Associates could turn its fortunes
around in Europe, analysts said.
<p>
   ``The bottom line is they did what they said they would do for
the quarter,'' said Chris Mortenson, an analyst at Alex. Brown &AMP;
Sons. The company said it is focusing on improving the sales
training of its salespeople in Europe. Computer Associates said it
began selling client-server systems in Europe about nine months
ago, versus about two years ago in the U.S.
<p>
   The company said Europeans have been slower to change from
mainframe systems to client-servers and that its sales people
hadn't been persuasive enough it encouraging customers to make the
switch.
<p>
   Client-server systems overall are selling at a faster pace than
mainframes, as more companies use networks of high-powered computer
servers linked to personal computers. The company said it expects
that by the middle of 1998 half of its revenue will come from
client-server software and half from mainframe sales.
<p>
   That's compared to the 61 percent of revenue mainframe sales
accounted for in the third quarter and 63 percent in the
second-quarter.
<p>
   Mainframe sales for the quarter were $640 million, while
client-server sales were $371 million. International sales were
$409 million, while U.S. sales accounted for $644 million.
<p>
   The company said it expected to benefit from strong sales of
client-server software from Microsoft Corp., with which Computer
Associates products work.
<p>
   Computer Associates bought Cheyenne in December for about $1.19
billion.
<p>
   For the nine months, profit from operations rose to $627.9
million, or $1.65 a share, from $486.6 million, or $1.28, a year
earlier.
<p>
   Nine-month net income after the charge was $29.9 million, or 8
cents a share, compared with a loss of $321.5 million, or 89 cents.
Revenue rose to $2.84 billion from $2.39 billion.

   Portland, Oregon, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Bancorp's
fourth-quarter earnings rose 9 percent, as the Oregon bank raked in
higher fees from loans, checking accounts and other services.
<p>
   U.S. Bancorp said net income rose to $120 million, or 79 cents
per share, from profit from operations of $110.5 million, or 71
cents, a year earlier. After acquisition-related charges, net
income in the last three months of 1995 was $21.38 million, or 13
cents.
<p>
   The earnings met Wall Street's expectations of 79 cents a share,
according to a survey of 17 analysts by IBES International Inc.
U.S. Bancorp shares rose 3/16 to 45 5/16 in morning trading.
<p>
   Chairman Gerry Cameron, in a statement, said the bank plans to
focus on boosting revenue and buying back stock in 1997, after
absorbing West One Bancorp, which it acquired in December 1995.
<p>
   In the quarter, total revenue 8.5 percent to $515.6 million, as
the bank raised more fees from customers and paid less for funds.
<p>
   Net interest income rose 8.5 percent to $394.1 million from
higher lending income. The net interest margin, or difference
between what a bank earns on loans and investments and pays for
deposits and borrowings, widened to 5.42 percentage points from
5.32 points in the third quarter.
<p>
   Noninterest income rose 6.9 percent to $132.6 million, led by a
jump in service charges on consumer deposit accounts. Fees from
trust services also rose, while credit card fees fell.
<p>
   Noninterest expenses fell 2.5 percent to $289.9 million, as
employees salaries and benefits were little changed. Before merger
costs, expenses were down 10 percent.
<p>
   U.S. Bancorp slashed costs as it absorbed West One, eliminating
1,100 jobs and closing 52 branches. In 1996, the bank achieved its
goal of slashing annual costs by $84 million.
<p>
   For the year, net income rose to $478.9 million, or $3.08 a
share, from $329.0 million, or $2.09, in 1995.

 &UR; Race Is On for Fast Net Access &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   In the digital age, the race for profits will go to the swift  &MD; 
those companies that can deliver data to and from your computer the
fastest.
<p>
   Pacific Bell's announcement Monday that it plans to start
rolling out a powerful new data service later this year is a direct
challenge to cable television companies that already offer
high-speed Internet access to some homes.
<p>
   Early evidence suggests customers will love the speed and
convenience of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), which
lets customers download Web pages as much as 50 times faster than
normal telephone modems, over existing phone lines.
<p>
   But consumers may balk at the price. Pac Bell says it's likely
to charge about $165 a month for ADSL Internet access, on top of a
$600 set-up fee.
<p>
   Steve Chiapetto of San Ramon signed up in October as a guinea
pig for Pac Bell's ADSL experiment. Until then he was using a 14.4
kilobits-per-second modem to browse the Internet through AOL, which
he found hopelessly slow. His life  &MD;  or at least his online
existence  &MD;  has changed now that he downloads data at 1.5 million
bits (megabits) per second.
<p>
   ``Instead of pushing a button and going off to cook dinner
before a page comes up, it takes seconds,'' he said. ``I find it
easier to turn on the computer and get sports information than
going out to the driveway to get my newspaper.''
<p>
   Because Internet access is so fast, he uses the computer almost
daily now to look up Caltrans road information, check airplane
arrival times or help his daughter learn about building bridges for
a school project.
<p>
   But would he pay $165 a month for all that convenience? ``I'd
probably shy away,'' he admitted. ``I'd hope the price would come
down and become more reasonable.''
<p>
   Ron Raab, a molecular biologist and member of the San Ramon City
Council, also finds Pac Bell's ADSL service invaluable, whether
looking up a biotechnology database or checking weather reports.
But he figures he could buy a new computer each year for the fees
it would take to pay for ADSL. ``My wife would kill me,'' he said.
<p>
   Paula Reinman, product manager for ADSL at Pac Bell, conceded
that most residential customers will stick with traditional modems
or ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), which pumps data at
128 kilobits per second and costs roughly $49 per month. But ADSL
will be cheaper for many businesses than some heavyweight data
solutions, like T1 lines.
<p>
   ``Given the current pricing structure, ADSL needs to be targeted
to small business and to consumers who are using the Internet as a
critical piece of their life,'' Reinman said. ``Over time ADSL
modem prices will fall and it will become more of a mass market.''
<p>
   Super-fast Internet service is already available in a few
communities from cable companies at prices ranging from $35 to $60
a month  &MD;  a much more attractive deal for casual customers. In the
Bay Area, Home has launched service in Fremont and Sunnyvale.
<p>
   But most cable TV systems aren't yet capable of sending data in
two directions, so cable and telephone companies are still
neck-and-neck at this early stage of their race.
<p>
   Analysts are sharply divided over who will win. A recent study
by Lawrence Gasman of Communications Industry Researchers in
Charlottesville, Va., concluded that cable will ultimately have the
edge because its delivery medium, coaxial cable, has more data
carrying capacity than copper telephone wires used for ADSL.
<p>
   Emily Green of Forrester Research in Boston says cable modems
have the price edge if you can use them, but small business may opt
for ADSL because cable lines don't run through most business
districts.
<p>
   And Randy Carlson of the Yankee Group, also in Boston, sees the
cable companies retrenching to focus on their core business of
delivering video. Burdened by enormous debt, they can't afford a
huge investment in new data services.
<p>
   ``The telephone companies will win, definitely,'' he said.
``They have superior experience in two-way interactive
communication.''
<p>
   Both technologies will take years to deploy. By 2001,
Communications Industry Researchers projects, there will be 73.5
million connections to the Internet through ordinary telephone
modems, 40 million through ISDN, and only 20 million using ADSL or
cable modems.
<p>
   Many consumers will end up getting a choice of one or the other
but not both of the advanced services, depending on which company
has the resources to get to their neighborhood first.
<p>
   ``It's not a religious matter,'' said Jerry Bennington, a
spokesman for Cable Labs in Louisville, Colo. ``If ADSL showed up
and I didn't have a cable modem, I'd buy ADSL. Either way, it's a
victory for the consumer.''

   Killington, widely known for having the longest ski season and
wildest party scene in the East, is taking steps this year to
become better recognized as a family resort.
<p>
   The central Vermont ski area, New England's largest, was bought
last summer by the American Skiing Co., which immediately began
upgrading its facilities and creating new programs.
<p>
   Just last month, Killington acquired its neighbor, Pico
Mountain, giving the resort its seventh peak and its guests access
to even more family-friendly terrain.
<p>
   That may not matter to the rowdy young singles who drive up from
New York and New Jersey to thrash themselves on steep trails like
Outer Limits, Killington's signature mogul run, but it matters a
great deal to parents who may have found the sprawling resort's
boisterous crowds daunting enough to ski elsewhere.

   At Killington, the Rams Head area has been designated a family
ski mountain.

houses all children's instruction programs, rental operations and
day care, Rams Head's novice and intermediate trails are set off
from the rest of the resort.
<p>
   There are two new novice trails and three new lifts, including a
high-speed quad chair that cuts in half travel time to the top of
Rams Head.
<p>
   A new ski-through underpass connecting Rams Head to Snowshed
eliminates the need to cross the Killington access road.
<p>
   Elsewhere at the resort, the Needle's Eye area on Skye Peak has
been reconfigured to eliminate crossover trails and allow for more
continuous top-to-bottom skiing.
<p>
   Two high-speed quad chairs, the Needle's Eye Express and the
Northbrook Quad, have also been installed to serve that area.
<p>

<p>
   Killington, widely known for having the longest ski season and
wildest party scene in the East, is taking steps this year to
become better recognized as a family resort.
<p>
   The central Vermont ski area, New England's largest, was bought
last summer by the American Skiing Co., which immediately began
upgrading its facilities and creating new programs.
<p>
   Just last month, Killington acquired its neighbor, Pico
Mountain, giving the resort its seventh peak and its guests access
to even more family-friendly terrain.
<p>
   That may not matter to the rowdy young singles who drive up from
New York and New Jersey to thrash themselves on steep trails like
Outer Limits, Killington's signature mogul run, but it matters a
great deal to parents who may have found the sprawling resort's
boisterous crowds daunting enough to ski elsewhere.
<p>
   At Killington, the Rams Head area has been designated a family
ski mountain.
<p>
   Anchored by a greatly expanded and redesigned base lodge, which
houses all children's instruction programs, rental operations and
day care, Rams Head's novice and intermediate trails are set off
from the rest of the resort.
<p>
   There are two new novice trails and three new lifts, including a
high-speed quad chair that cuts in half travel time to the top of
Rams Head.
<p>
   A new ski-through underpass connecting Rams Head to Snowshed
eliminates the need to cross the Killington access road.
<p>
   Elsewhere at the resort, the Needle's Eye area on Skye Peak has
been reconfigured to eliminate crossover trails and allow for more
continuous top-to-bottom skiing.
<p>
   Two high-speed quad chairs, the Needle's Eye Express and the
Northbrook Quad, have also been installed to serve that area.
<p>
   New Yorkers, who make up the majority of Killington visitors,
can now take Amtrak's new 240-passenger Ethan Allen Express from
Penn Station to Rutland, Vt., about 15 miles west of Killington.
<p>
   The trip takes about five hours and costs $100 round trip, $50
for children. Through Feb. 9, children 15 and younger ride free.
<p>
   A transfer service to lodging in and near Killington costs $10
round trip. Call Killington Lodging and Travel Service, (800)
621-6867. Vans meet the trains.

to Rutland Airport. Continental Airlines serves Burlington, Vt.,
which is about 90 minutes to the north.

<p>
   Few landscapes are as undramatically beautiful as the Limousin,
the rolling countryside around Limoges in the heart of France.
<p>
   South of the hot vineyards of the Loire and west of the central
mountains, it is a country of high green meadows and streams, of
chestnut and oak plantations, of small red dairy cows that match
the soil, and of compact, 1,000-year-old towns and villages.
<p>
   Until the present century, it had known no serious assault since
the ending of the war with the English 500 years ago.
<p>
   Far from Paris and from the traditional killing fields of
northern France, the citizens of central France had seen no invader
and indeed few strangers of any kind  &MD;  until 1940.
<p>
   Even then, with the occupation of half the country by the German
Army, the Limousin was at first untouched. It was in the
theoretically ``free'' zone of Vichy France.
<p>
   There was not even, in that fertile land with its peasant
economy of small, mixed farms, a shortage of food.
<p>
   And even after the end of 1942, when the increasingly tense
German Army took over the whole country, life well away from the
German command in the main cities was still much the same.
<p>
   Oradour-sur-Glane was, and is again today, a substantial village
about a dozen miles outside Limoges.
<p>
   The old village, however, is preserved in ruins, a historic
monument and a memorial to a mindless atrocity of World War II.
<p>
   In the fine early June of 1944, when the Normandy landings were
taking place, the 1,500 inhabitants of Oradour and its outlying
farms, plus refugees, were going about their daily affairs.
<p>
   They were tending their animals and their fields, sitting in the
schools, popping into the grocers or the pharmacy, stamping forms
in the mairie, or town hall, banging metal in the smithy, sitting
in one or another of the half dozen cafes.
<p>
   June 10 was a Saturday, the day when the tobacco ration was
distributed, so there were more men than usual about in the single
main street and the shaded, irregularly shaped square by the church
from where the road sloped down to the small river Glane.
<p>
   There were also, as it was the weekend, visitors from the town,
up for a day in the country and a meal at the inn, the Hotel
Milord. They arrived on the little tramway from Limoges that
terminated at the top of the street.
<p>
   A few people from Oradour had gone down to Limoges that morning
to shop by the same tram.
<p>
   At 2 in the afternoon a large detachment of SS troops came fast
up the road from Limoges (the N141 toward Angouleme and the
Atlantic coast) and forked right onto the D9. They drove straight
up into the center of Oradour.
<p>
   Five hours later, 642 people were dead. Almost 300 of these were
women and 205 were children.
<p>
   The men, including a party of teen-age cyclists who just
happened to be passing, had been assembled on the cattle-fair
ground, herded in various barns and then shot. Some men had managed
to run.
<p>
   The women and children had all been marched into the church,
which was then set on fire. All but one woman perished.
<p>
   The whole village, 328 houses and other buildings with all their
contents, was then set on fire and reduced to a smoldering ruin.
<p>
   It is unnecessary to go into greater detail here. Those who
visit the remains of the village can buy complete accounts.
<p>
   Twenty years ago, when I first visited the place, the official
booklet had a German eagle enblazoned in red across its cover.
<p>
   Today the covers are different, suggestive less of one specific
outrage than of a more general commemoration of the fragility of
human decencies and the need to remember the past in order to erect
safeguards in the future.
<p>
   As General de Gaulle said in 1945 when the war ended:
``Oradour-sur-Glane is the symbol of what our country had suffered.
We must conserve it, for never again must a comparable evil
occur.''
<p>
   Although there are gates with an information kiosk at each end
of the ruined village now, and thus an unobtrusive security
presence, you can wander in at any daylight hour and there is no
question of payment.
<p>
   This is not a place for crowds of tourists or conducted tours,
but rather for French families, with a sprinkling of English,
Belgian and Dutch, to bring their children on an informative
pilgrimage.
<p>
   By one of those strange ironies of time and chance the name
Oradour, which is centuries old, actually means a shrine or place
of prayer.
<p>
   A notice posted soon after the massacre suggests that a
respectful demeanor and ``correct dress'' are appropriate.
<p>
   Now people stroll thoughtfully in the sunshine taking a few
photos, and if the shorts and T-shirts of present day
holiday-makers would once have caused affront then that is simply
an outward sign that the world beyond the gates is very different
now.
<p>
   Today, in spite of everything one may know or read about the
horror of that June day over 50 years ago, the dominant impression
of Oradour is of peace.
<p>
   The carefully stabilized ruins of houses, shops, workshops and
barns, long cleansed of blackened debris, lapped in neatly cut
grass, form an oasis of tranquillity.
<p>
   Shady trees once again spread their branches where the cafe
tables used to be.
<p>
   In the words of George Meredith:
<p>
   Green earth forgets,
<p>
   The gay young generations mask her grief
<p>
   Here, one knows, hundreds were brutally wiped out, yet the
feeling today is less of death than of life arrested  &MD;  the life of
a prosperous corner of rural France on the eve of the present era.
<p>
   ``Le temps est reste fige pour que tu te souviennes''  &MD;  ``time
has remained fixed here to make us remember''  &MD;  says the notice at
the gate.
<p>
   However, more is preserved here, almost incidentally but
gathering meaning with every decade that passes, than a memory of
an atrocity.
<p>
   The street, up which you walk from what's left of the church,
following the tramline all the way up to the Art Deco post office
building and the large houses of the doctor and the lawyer, is a
street of the 1930's, traffic-free, white with dust.
<p>
   The remains of the very few cars then owned in Oradour stand
where the fire found and devoured them.
<p>
   Covered in protective brown paint, these antique Citroens and
Simcas, along with the twisted skeletons of push-bikes and sewing
machines, have acquired the air of metal sculptures, eloquent of
the busy and ``modern'' life in which they were once valued
possessions.
<p>
   Most of the roofless, windowless houses on the street carry a
small plaque telling one that here bread was baked, or groceries
sold or wheels fixed or shoes repaired or dressmaking undertaken: a
complete roll-call of the self-sufficient commerce and skills of a
community long before the era of the supermarket.
<p>
   Water pumps still stand by garden gates, desirable 20th-century
improvements on the traditional well.
<p>
   In the small, underground memorial museum by the cemetery, odds
and ends of daily life that survived the inferno have become
sanctified relics: decorative liqueur glasses, spectacles,
penknives, dental implements, watches with cracked faces showing
mid-afternoon times.
<p>
   Until that day in June 1944 when time was stopped forever,
Oradour seemed to have been one of the better places in which to be
born, to grow up, live and die.
<p>
   Up to that zero moment it had a history like anywhere else,
neither glorious nor ignoble.
<p>
   It was not even a focus of particular French Resistance
activity. To this day it is not clear why the SS chose it.
<p>
   It may even have been targeted by mistake for a more remote,
mountainous Limousin village  &MD;  Oradour-sur-Vayres. It had merely
participated, as ever, in the events of its time.
<p>
   One becomes aware that the church that is now a shell was once a
fine 15th-century building and that the remains of several other
houses nearby show massive, ancient stonework.
<p>
   Inside the church the First World War memorial is intact: The
citizens who erected it may reasonably have felt that, with all
those young names, Oradour had paid its dues to fate.
<p>
   In a side chapel wall plaques offer thanks to Mary for specific
favors.
<p>
   Today a new Oradour stands on a slope above the old one. Built
in the early 1950s, it is architecturally banal, but pleasant
enough with its flowery central square, new mairie, post office,
church and shops.
<p>
   There is even a Hotel Milord again, its tables laid for lunch
under a leaf-shaded terrace.
<p>
   There is a store selling Limoges porcelain, and both the fancy
cake shop and the tobacconist stock souvenir plates.
<p>
   You can buy one painted with assorted ruins, but I was not
surprised to hear that the most popular line depicts traditional
scenes from life in Oradour before its destiny struck.
<p>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: THE OLD AND NEW VILLAGES &LR; 
 &UR; GETTING THERE &LR; 
<p>
   Oradour-sur-Glane is 12 1/2 miles from Limoges. If you are
driving, leave Limoges on the N141, in the direction of Angouleme,
fork right onto the D9.
<p>
   Or take a bus from Limoges at the bus station  &MD;  Gare Routiere  &MD; 
at the train station or at several other points in the city center.
It is the bus to St.-Junien, which extends its route at least once
a day both going and coming to make a detour via Oradour.
<p>
   The Tourist Office has timetables.
 &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR; 
<p>
   The Limoges Tourist Office (the Syndicat d'Initiative) is on the
Boulevard de Fleurus, between the Place Jourdain and the Place
Wilson, open every day except Sunday from 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to
6:30 (to 8 p.m. in summer); telephone (33-5) 55.34.46.87.
<p>
   Some English is spoken. The office can advise on buses and also
on getting a local guide at Oradour.
<p>
   There are no organized tours of the village, but you can arrange
with one of the guides at the church to give you an account of what
happened, there and elsewhere.
<p>
   Request this in advance if you are taking a whole group or if
you want an English speaker.
<p>
   Otherwise, you can just turn up at Oradour and make your request
on the spot.
<p>
   The village normally opens soon after sunrise and does not shut
till dusk  &MD;  pedestrians only. Informative booklets are for sale in
several languages.
<p>
   The official history costs $7. A shortened, up-to-date version
is $4.
<p>
   Alternatively, you can go through the Syndicat d'Initiative in
the new village of Oradour  &MD;  apply to the mairie there; (33-5) 55
03 13 73.
<p>
   The small, semi-underground museum at Oradour is near the
cemetery gate. As befits the subject, it is more of a memorial than
a true museum, and has the atmosphere of a chapel crypt.
<p>
   Laid out in it are surviving small personal possessions of some
villagers and a little fire-tempered china and glass. Open usually
from 9 to noon and 2 to 6; closes earlier in winter.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY AND EAT &LR; 
<p>
   Nothing is available in the ruins of Oradour, and you should not
bring food or drink.
<p>
   In the new village, a few hundred yards up the road, there are
several very reasonably priced hotels and cafes.
<p>
   These include Au Bon Accueil, 2 Place Charles de Gaulle,
telephone and fax (33-5) 55 03 26 56, in a secluded spot behind the
mairie, with rooms from $30 to $43.75, calculated at 5.03 francs to
$1, and a modestly priced restaurant.
<p>
   The Hotel Milord, 10 Avenue du 10 Juin 1944, (33-5) 55 03 10 35,
fax (33-5) 55 03 21 76, is on the road but has a delightful terrace
to one side. A double room with shower and telephone is $28. Meals
$19.50 to $37.75, plus a lunch special for $12.
<p>
   Or you can stay in Limoges or one of the other little towns in
the area. Several have small, family-run hotels that are part of
the highly recommendable Logis de France chain such as the Au
Rendez-vous des Chasseurs in St.-Junien at Le Pont a la Planche,
(33-5) 55 02 19 73, fax (33-5) 55 02 06 98, in a delightful setting
on the Vienne River. Double room with shower: $50.
<p>
   Not far from Oradour, Le Relais, 1 Place Royale, telephone and
fax (33-5) 55 68 12 09, has its own garden in a tiny village called
Mortemart; a double with shower is $40.

<p>
   IBM reported fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday that were better
than expected, but some analysts feared that the results were not
strong enough to maintain the momentum that has seen shares of the
company soar more than 30 percent in the last three months.
<p>
   While IBM's growth in services continued, its hardware sales
were up only 2 percent in the quarter compared with the 1995
period, and sales in Europe were flat.
<p>
   Earnings for the quarter rose 18.2 percent, to $2 billion, or
$3.93 a share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $3.09 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 5.6 percent, to $23.1 billion.
<p>
   The results surpassed the average forecast of Wall Street
analysts, of $3.88 a share, according to First Call. Still, a
number of analysts and some big investors were expecting IBM to
earn more than $4 a share and to register a double-digit revenue
increase.
<p>
   ``It's a disappointment,'' said Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch
in New York, whose earnings estimate was one of the highest at
$4.32 a share. ``They had to be at $4 to justify where the stock
has come from. It's going to lose momentum tomorrow. How much I
don't know.''
<p>
   IBM announced the results after the stock market closed.
Earlier, shares reached a 52-week high in anticipation of a strong
earnings report, closing at $168, up $1. Traders said that
better-than-expected results earlier in the day from NCR and Tandem
Computer had encouraged belief that IBM, too, might deliver a
surprise.
<p>
   The shares of IBM are now a few dollars shy of their all-time
high of $175.875 set in August 1987. They have more than doubled in
the last year, after falling as low as $40.625 in 1993.
<p>
   Louis Gerstner Jr., IBM's chairman, said in a statement that
``we showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult
year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a
greater-then-expected currency impact.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   IBM's services business continued to be the company's
strongest-performing unit as revenue increased 22 percent, the 16th
consecutive quarter of more than 20 percent growth. Some on Wall
Street have been suspicious of that performance, whispering that
IBM is sacrificing profit so that it can make low bids in order to
win contracts.
<p>
   But G. Richard Thoman, the chief financial officer, rejected
such notions in a meeting with analysts Tuesday. ``I will tell you
categorically that that is not the case,'' he said. ``We are not
buying the business.''
<p>
   Hardware sales were led by the personal computer division, which
continued a turnaround that has seen it gain market share against
its rival Compaq Computer in recent quarters. IBM did not disclose
growth figures, but Mandresh of Merrill Lynch estimated that the
division grew 25 percent during the quarter.
<p>
   Thoman also said the storage division had a strong quarter, led
by sales of hard disk drives, though its high-end storage systems
continued to be weak sellers.
<p>
   Since PCs and disk drives carry relatively low profit margins,
IBM's overall margins ebbed, to 40.3 percent in the quarter
compared with 41.7 percent a year earlier.
<p>
   Mainframe computers have relatively high margins, but sales
declined during the quarter compared with a year earlier. That was
largely because the fourth quarter of 1995 saw an 80 percent
increase in the amount of mainframe computing power IBM shipped
compared with a 35 percent increase in the most recent quarter.
<p>
   Thoman said that mainframe demand remained strong and that IBM
was continuing to find new customers for the machines that many
analysts had predicted were dinosaurs a few years ago.
<p>
   The AS/400 minicomputer had a strong quarter, but sales of the
RS6000 line of work stations and servers were flat.
<p>
   Software revenue grew 4 percent in the quarter, and Thoman cited
the performances of Lotus Development and Tivoli, IBM's two largest
recent acquisitions. Lotus sold 1.5 million copies of its Notes
software in the quarter, bringing its total installed to 9.5
million, twice what it was at the beginning of 1996.
<p>
   Sales of Tivoli's system-management software tripled in the
quarter, and the unit's overall revenue was larger than the first
three quarters combined, Thoman said.
<p>
   But the two units are a relatively small part of IBM's $13
billion in software sales, which are dominated by slower-growing
products for mainframes and minicomputers.
<p>
   Thoman said unfavorable exchange rates cut overall revenue 3
percent in the quarter and reduced earnings 18 cents a share. A
plunge in memory-chip prices also had a negative impact.
<p>
   But IBM was able to reduce expenses 2 percent compared with last
year and cut its tax rate to 29.9 percent compared with 33.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 1995. The company has said it will
continue to pursue that strategy as overall margins decline in the
years ahead.
<p>
   Thoman expressed optimism about 1997, but warned that the first
quarter would be a particularly tough comparison because of the
decline in memory-chip prices in 1996.
<p>
   Nevertheless, analysts said that the recent spectacular gain in
IBM's stock may have gotten ahead of its financial performance.
<p>
   Referring to Thoman, Mandresh said: ``He ended on a very
positive note, but this is a business that acts on disappointment.
The stock was $83 last January. Clearly, next January, the stock
will be higher than it is now, but it won't be higher tomorrow.''

   Oradour-sur-Glane was, and is again today, a substantial village
about a dozen miles outside Limoges.
<p>
   The old village, however, is preserved in ruins, a historic
monument and a memorial to a mindless atrocity of World War II.
<p>
   In the fine early June of 1944, when the Normandy landings were
taking place, the 1,500 inhabitants of Oradour and its outlying
farms, plus refugees, were going about their daily affairs.
<p>
   They were tending their animals and their fields, sitting in the
schools, popping into the grocers or the pharmacy, stamping forms
in the mairie, or town hall, banging metal in the smithy, sitting
in one or another of the half dozen cafes.
<p>
   June 10 was a Saturday, the day when the tobacco ration was
distributed, so there were more men than usual about in the single
main street and the shaded, irregularly shaped square by the church
from where the road sloped down to the small river Glane.
<p>
   There were also, as it was the weekend, visitors from the town,
up for a day in the country and a meal at the inn, the Hotel
Milord. They arrived on the little tramway from Limoges that
terminated at the top of the street.
<p>
   A few people from Oradour had gone down to Limoges that morning
to shop by the same tram.
<p>
   At 2 in the afternoon a large detachment of SS troops came fast
up the road from Limoges (the N141 toward Angouleme and the
Atlantic coast) and forked right onto the D9. They drove straight
up into the center of Oradour.
<p>
   Five hours later, 642 people were dead. Almost 300 of these were
women and 205 were children.
<p>
   The men, including a party of teen-age cyclists who just
happened to be passing, had been assembled on the cattle-fair
ground, herded in various barns and then shot. Some men had managed
to run.
<p>
   The women and children had all been marched into the church,
which was then set on fire. All but one woman perished.
<p>
   The whole village, 328 houses and other buildings with all their
contents, was then set on fire and reduced to a smoldering ruin.
<p>
   It is unnecessary to go into greater detail here. Those who
visit the remains of the village can buy complete accounts.
<p>
   Twenty years ago, when I first visited the place, the official
booklet had a German eagle enblazoned in red across its cover.
<p>
   Today the covers are different, suggestive less of one specific
outrage than of a more general commemoration of the fragility of
human decencies and the need to remember the past in order to erect
safeguards in the future.
<p>
   As General de Gaulle said in 1945 when the war ended:
``Oradour-sur-Glane is the symbol of what our country had suffered.
We must conserve it, for never again must a comparable evil
occur.''
<p>
   Although there are gates with an information kiosk at each end
of the ruined village now, and thus an unobtrusive security
presence, you can wander in at any daylight hour and there is no
question of payment.
<p>
   This is not a place for crowds of tourists or conducted tours,
but rather for French families, with a sprinkling of English,
Belgian and Dutch, to bring their children on an informative
pilgrimage.
<p>
   By one of those strange ironies of time and chance the name
Oradour, which is centuries old, actually means a shrine or place
of prayer.
<p>
   A notice posted soon after the massacre suggests that a
respectful demeanor and ``correct dress'' are appropriate.
<p>
   Now people stroll thoughtfully in the sunshine taking a few
photos, and if the shorts and T-shirts of present day
holiday-makers would once have caused affront then that is simply
an outward sign that the world beyond the gates is very different
now.
<p>
   Today, in spite of everything one may know or read about the
horror of that June day over 50 years ago, the dominant impression
of Oradour is of peace.
<p>
   The carefully stabilized ruins of houses, shops, workshops and
barns, long cleansed of blackened debris, lapped in neatly cut
grass, form an oasis of tranquillity.
<p>
   Shady trees once again spread their branches where the cafe
tables used to be.
<p>
   In the words of George Meredith:
<p>
   Green earth forgets,
<p>
   The gay young generations mask her grief
<p>
   Here, one knows, hundreds were brutally wiped out, yet the
feeling today is less of death than of life arrested  &MD;  the life of
a prosperous corner of rural France on the eve of the present era.
<p>
   ``Le temps est reste fige pour que tu te souviennes''  &MD;  ``time
has remained fixed here to make us remember''  &MD;  says the notice at
the gate.
<p>
   However, more is preserved here, almost incidentally but
gathering meaning with every decade that passes, than a memory of
an atrocity.
<p>
   The street, up which you walk from what's left of the church,
following the tramline all the way up to the Art Deco post office
building and the large houses of the doctor and the lawyer, is a
street of the 1930's, traffic-free, white with dust.
<p>
   The remains of the very few cars then owned in Oradour stand
where the fire found and devoured them.
<p>
   Covered in protective brown paint, these antique Citroens and
Simcas, along with the twisted skeletons of push-bikes and sewing
machines, have acquired the air of metal sculptures, eloquent of
the busy and ``modern'' life in which they were once valued
possessions.
<p>
   Most of the roofless, windowless houses on the street carry a
small plaque telling one that here bread was baked, or groceries
sold or wheels fixed or shoes repaired or dressmaking undertaken: a
complete roll-call of the self-sufficient commerce and skills of a
community long before the era of the supermarket.
<p>
   Water pumps still stand by garden gates, desirable 20th-century
improvements on the traditional well.
<p>
   In the small, underground memorial museum by the cemetery, odds
and ends of daily life that survived the inferno have become
sanctified relics: decorative liqueur glasses, spectacles,
penknives, dental implements, watches with cracked faces showing
mid-afternoon times.
<p>
   Until that day in June 1944 when time was stopped forever,
Oradour seemed to have been one of the better places in which to be
born, to grow up, live and die.
<p>
   Up to that zero moment it had a history like anywhere else,
neither glorious nor ignoble.
<p>
   It was not even a focus of particular French Resistance
activity. To this day it is not clear why the SS chose it.
<p>
   It may even have been targeted by mistake for a more remote,
mountainous Limousin village  &MD;  Oradour-sur-Vayres. It had merely
participated, as ever, in the events of its time.
<p>
   One becomes aware that the church that is now a shell was once a
fine 15th-century building and that the remains of several other
houses nearby show massive, ancient stonework.
<p>
   Inside the church the First World War memorial is intact: The
citizens who erected it may reasonably have felt that, with all
those young names, Oradour had paid its dues to fate.
<p>
   In a side chapel wall plaques offer thanks to Mary for specific
favors.
<p>
   Today a new Oradour stands on a slope above the old one. Built
in the early 1950s, it is architecturally banal, but pleasant
enough with its flowery central square, new mairie, post office,
church and shops.
<p>
   There is even a Hotel Milord again, its tables laid for lunch
under a leaf-shaded terrace.
<p>
   There is a store selling Limoges porcelain, and both the fancy
cake shop and the tobacconist stock souvenir plates.
<p>
   You can buy one painted with assorted ruins, but I was not
surprised to hear that the most popular line depicts traditional
scenes from life in Oradour before its destiny struck.
<p>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: THE OLD AND NEW VILLAGES &LR; 
 &UR; GETTING THERE &LR; 
<p>
   Oradour-sur-Glane is 12 1/2 miles from Limoges. If you are
driving, leave Limoges on the N141, in the direction of Angouleme,
fork right onto the D9.
<p>
   Or take a bus from Limoges at the bus station  &MD;  Gare Routiere  &MD; 
at the train station or at several other points in the city center.
It is the bus to St.-Junien, which extends its route at least once
a day both going and coming to make a detour via Oradour.
<p>
   The Tourist Office has timetables.
 &UR; WHAT TO SEE &LR; 
<p>
   The Limoges Tourist Office (the Syndicat d'Initiative) is on the
Boulevard de Fleurus, between the Place Jourdain and the Place
Wilson, open every day except Sunday from 9 a.m. to noon and 2 to
6:30 (to 8 p.m. in summer); telephone (33-5) 55.34.46.87.
<p>
   Some English is spoken. The office can advise on buses and also
on getting a local guide at Oradour.
<p>
   There are no organized tours of the village, but you can arrange
with one of the guides at the church to give you an account of what
happened, there and elsewhere.
<p>
   Request this in advance if you are taking a whole group or if
you want an English speaker.
<p>
   Otherwise, you can just turn up at Oradour and make your request
on the spot.
<p>
   The village normally opens soon after sunrise and does not shut
till dusk  &MD;  pedestrians only. Informative booklets are for sale in
several languages.
<p>
   The official history costs $7. A shortened, up-to-date version
is $4.
<p>
   Alternatively, you can go through the Syndicat d'Initiative in
the new village of Oradour  &MD;  apply to the mairie there; (33-5) 55
03 13 73.
<p>
   The small, semi-underground museum at Oradour is near the
cemetery gate. As befits the subject, it is more of a memorial than
a true museum, and has the atmosphere of a chapel crypt.
<p>
   Laid out in it are surviving small personal possessions of some
villagers and a little fire-tempered china and glass. Open usually
from 9 to noon and 2 to 6; closes earlier in winter.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY AND EAT &LR; 
<p>
   Nothing is available in the ruins of Oradour, and you should not
bring food or drink.
<p>
   In the new village, a few hundred yards up the road, there are
several very reasonably priced hotels and cafes.
<p>
   These include Au Bon Accueil, 2 Place Charles de Gaulle,
telephone and fax (33-5) 55 03 26 56, in a secluded spot behind the
mairie, with rooms from $30 to $43.75, calculated at 5.03 francs to
$1, and a modestly priced restaurant.
<p>
   The Hotel Milord, 10 Avenue du 10 Juin 1944, (33-5) 55 03 10 35,
fax (33-5) 55 03 21 76, is on the road but has a delightful terrace
to one side. A double room with shower and telephone is $28. Meals
$19.50 to $37.75, plus a lunch special for $12.
<p>
   Or you can stay in Limoges or one of the other little towns in
the area. Several have small, family-run hotels that are part of
the highly recommendable Logis de France chain such as the Au
Rendez-vous des Chasseurs in St.-Junien at Le Pont a la Planche,
(33-5) 55 02 19 73, fax (33-5) 55 02 06 98, in a delightful setting
on the Vienne River. Double room with shower: $50.
<p>
   Not far from Oradour, Le Relais, 1 Place Royale, telephone and
fax (33-5) 55 68 12 09, has its own garden in a tiny village called
Mortemart; a double with shower is $40.

 &UR; By GEORGIANA HAVILL
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   At a pub in Exmouth, an English Channel town in West Devon, my
husband and I got into a debate with the local lads over whether
King Arthur was real or legendary.
<p>
   ``Arthur's real, mate,'' a college student said over Stilton
cheese and dark stout. ``Most of his Tintagel castle still stands
in Cornwall, and you can visit his grave at Glastonbury Abbey. He's
buried there alongside Guinevere.''
<p>
   For nearly a week last October Adrian and I had been aimlessly
touring the southwest coastal villages of England in a rented Ford
Fiesta.
<p>
   The night before, we'd been in Lyme Regis  &MD;  John Fowles country
 &MD;  where we had walked the famous stone Cobb to its end, the white
waves pounding spray against us as we re-created Meryl Streep's
vigil for her man in the movie version of Fowles's ``French
Lieutenant's Woman.''
<p>
   The wind was so high it was impossible to hold my camera steady.
A visit to Camelot in Cornwall seemed like a good idea until our
B&AMP;B proprietor warned us away.
<p>
   ``They've Disneyized Cornwall,'' he warned. ``They have model
villages that charge fees to walk the streets. And you should see
what they've done to Lands End. It's a shame. Head for Glastonbury.
That will be a revelation for you.''
<p>
   And so we did.
<p>
   The next day we pointed our little Ford north on the M-5 highway
and headed toward Glastonbury, a town of 9,000 people in Somerset
currently being heralded as the ``British Jerusalem,'' a mecca for
various religious persuasions.
<p>
   As soon as we entered the narrow main streets of Glastonbury we
began to suspect that we had happened on a place where hashish
might actually be easier to find than a cream tea.
<p>
   As we opened our car doors, we could smell cannabis in the air
just a few feet from the Tourist Information Center, wafting out of
a large knot of dreadlocked men and women and the type of youths we
used to call ``Yippies'' that I hadn't seen in such numbers since
the 1968 Democratic Convention.
<p>
   ``Now this is beginning to look interesting,'' my husband
murmured, peering into a shop named Majik and Cult that offered a
one-hour special involving lying under a pyramid on a magnetic bed
while being massaged with ``mystical crystals.''
<p>
   Glastonbury already was offering us a dizzying juxtaposition of
effects, especially after our drive through quaint British villages
with their hedge-shouldered roads, orderly pubs and tea shops
presided over by tweedy gray-haired ladies.
<p>
   The small inn near the tourist center was called the Hangman B &AMP;
B. The tourist center itself is in a grim 15th-century structure
called the Tribunal.
<p>
   There we learned what thousands of New Age pilgrims to
Glastonbury believe, to one degree or another:
<p>
    &MD;  Glastonbury Abbey, the first church to be built in the British
Isles (construction began in A.D. 63, legend has it) not only
contains the grave sites of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but
also, some assert, the remains of St. Patrick.
<p>
    &MD;  Glastonbury Abbey hired an architect, Bligh Bond, in 1908 to
excavate and find ``lost chapels.'' Bond not only found the chapels
but also said that a friend received messages in Latin from dead
monks through psychic communication.
<p>
    &MD;  According to plaques placed about the abbey, Joseph of
Arimathea arrived at Glastonbury in A.D. 37 and founded the abbey.
It is said that he brought with him vials containing the blood and
sweat of Jesus. Some Glastonbury pilgrims maintain that the Chalice
Well near the Abbey, where the water indeed appears red, has
healing properties.
<p>
   Near the Chalice Well, also called the Blood Spring, is the
mysterious Tor, a steep and treeless 540-foot tiered hill with its
eerie 14th-century St. Michael's tower at the top.
<p>
   After climbing the stone steps to the summit, some visitors,
according to a pamphlet at the visitors center, say they are able
to jump into the air and experience weightlessness. Others simply
lie on the top of the Tor and claim to levitate.
<p>
   I myself attempted a small leap when up on the Tor and indeed
felt slightly more buoyant  &MD;  but perhaps I was just getting the
drift of the ``holy weed'' being consumed to the left and right of
me. UFO sightings over the Tor are frequent.
<p>
   While these sights are the chief attractions, there is more at
Glastonbury. Since Druids used to worship oak trees and because
there are two oak trees named Gog and Magog on the way to the Tor,
it is not unusual to see a young Druid prostrate at the base of an
old oak.
<p>
   And at the Glastonbury Zodiac, a series of zodiac signs that are
supposedly delineated by streams, paths or streets, believers come
to ``walk their sign.''
<p>
   Other, even stranger attractions are totally unfathomable.
<p>
   Suffice to say, that in a small British town where Christians,
Hare Krishnas, Druids and Rastafarians walk side by side through
the narrow streets, we began to believe the barman who told us that
``living in Glastonbury is like being inside a pack of Tarot
cards.''
<p>
   Not knowing whether we'd encounter zealots or scoffers, we
entered the 35 acres of Glastonbury Abbey with some trepidation.
<p>
   We found both  &MD;  those who were willing to believe the wildest
legends and skeptics who jokingly asked ``Where is Elvis buried?''
<p>
   The abbey is an independent charitable trust. The trustees hedge
wherever they can, at one point referring to the occupant of its
most famous grave site as ``the semi-legendary King Arthur.''
<p>
   The tomb of Arthur is said to have been found by the monks in
1191, shortly after a fire and at a time when the brothers were
nearly destitute.
<p>
   Historians today suggest that the ``discovery'' of Arthur may
have been a way to promote pilgrimages, a sort of medieval tourism.
(``Poor Arthur,'' a local told us over lager and cheese, ``they've
moved his body in the night all over England, depending on who
needs visitors the most.'')
<p>
   The actual site is marked simply by a stone outline with a sign
explaining that King Edward I and Queen Eleanor witnessed the
moving of Arthur and Guinevere's bodies in April 1278 to a black
marble tomb in Glastonbury. That tomb survived until the
dissolution of the abbey in 1539.
<p>
   Whether their remains were near our feet or not, the ruins of
the old abbey were inspiring  &MD;  the graceful interior arches solid
against the sky.
<p>
   In one corner, next to a still-used St. Patrick's Chapel was a
large thorn tree, one of three in Glastonbury supposedly grown from
the original that sprang from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea.
<p>
   Believed to be native to Syria, it is said to have the type of
thorns with which Jesus was crowned. It flowers twice a year  &MD; 
during Christmas and Easter week  &MD;  and blossoms are promptly
delivered to the reigning British monarch and the Queen Mother.
<p>
   We walked from the abbey to the Chalice Well, a distance of
about half a mile. There is a scientific explanation for the color
and therapeutic value of the spring.
<p>
   The water has a high iron content, which accounts for its
apparent color and perhaps the reputed fertility for women.
<p>
   According to the Chalice Well Trust, the Celtics and Druids
likely looked upon the spring as a holy well, since the reddish hue
of the water suggests the blood of childbirth.
<p>
   As we left the Chalice Well grounds and headed up the steep hill
of the Tor, we noticed a series of tents in a fenced-off pasture
with about 50 people milling around.
<p>
   A surreal happening, the group included a fair-haired lass in a
sari, a kilted bagpiper, children with gaily painted faces prancing
about smoldering bonfires and a dog with pastel ashes on its feet
and muzzle.
<p>
   As we tried to understand what was going on, a jubilant
``crusader'' invited us to join in.
<p>
   It was, we were told, a Hindu wedding, and who could refuse an
invitation to the nuptials on what was turning out to be a most
extraordinary day.

and headed toward Glastonbury, a town of 9,000 people in Somerset
currently being heralded as the ``British Jerusalem,'' a mecca for
various religious persuasions.
<p>
   As soon as we entered the narrow main streets of Glastonbury we
began to suspect that we had happened on a place where hashish
might actually be easier to find than a cream tea.
<p>
   As we opened our car doors, we could smell cannabis in the air
just a few feet from the Tourist Information Center, wafting out of
a large knot of dreadlocked men and women and the type of youths we
used to call ``Yippies'' that I hadn't seen in such numbers since
the 1968 Democratic Convention.
<p>
   ``Now this is beginning to look interesting,'' my husband
murmured, peering into a shop named Majik and Cult that offered a
one-hour special involving lying under a pyramid on a magnetic bed
while being massaged with ``mystical crystals.''
<p>
   Glastonbury already was offering us a dizzying juxtaposition of
effects, especially after our drive through quaint British villages
with their hedge-shouldered roads, orderly pubs and tea shops
presided over by tweedy gray-haired ladies.
<p>
   The small inn near the tourist center was called the Hangman B &AMP;
B. The tourist center itself is in a grim 15th-century structure
called the Tribunal.
<p>
   There we learned what thousands of New Age pilgrims to
Glastonbury believe, to one degree or another:
<p>
    &MD;  Glastonbury Abbey, the first church to be built in the British
Isles (construction began in A.D. 63, legend has it) not only
contains the grave sites of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but
also, some assert, the remains of St. Patrick.
<p>
    &MD;  Glastonbury Abbey hired an architect, Bligh Bond, in 1908 to
excavate and find ``lost chapels.'' Bond not only found the chapels
but also said that a friend received messages in Latin from dead
monks through psychic communication.
<p>
    &MD;  According to plaques placed about the abbey, Joseph of
Arimathea arrived at Glastonbury in A.D. 37 and founded the abbey.
It is said that he brought with him vials containing the blood and
sweat of Jesus. Some Glastonbury pilgrims maintain that the Chalice
Well near the Abbey, where the water indeed appears red, has
healing properties.
<p>
   Near the Chalice Well, also called the Blood Spring, is the
mysterious Tor, a steep and treeless 540-foot tiered hill with its
eerie 14th-century St. Michael's tower at the top.
<p>
   After climbing the stone steps to the summit, some visitors,
according to a pamphlet at the visitors center, say they are able
to jump into the air and experience weightlessness. Others simply
lie on the top of the Tor and claim to levitate.
<p>
   I myself attempted a small leap when up on the Tor and indeed
felt slightly more buoyant  &MD;  but perhaps I was just getting the
drift of the ``holy weed'' being consumed to the left and right of
me. UFO sightings over the Tor are frequent.
<p>
   While these sights are the chief attractions, there is more at
Glastonbury. Since Druids used to worship oak trees and because
there are two oak trees named Gog and Magog on the way to the Tor,
it is not unusual to see a young Druid prostrate at the base of an
old oak.
<p>
   And at the Glastonbury Zodiac, a series of zodiac signs that are
supposedly delineated by streams, paths or streets, believers come
to ``walk their sign.''
<p>
   Other, even stranger attractions are totally unfathomable.
<p>
   Suffice to say, that in a small British town where Christians,
Hare Krishnas, Druids and Rastafarians walk side by side through
the narrow streets, we began to believe the barman who told us that
``living in Glastonbury is like being inside a pack of Tarot
cards.''
<p>
   Not knowing whether we'd encounter zealots or scoffers, we
entered the 35 acres of Glastonbury Abbey with some trepidation.
<p>
   We found both  &MD;  those who were willing to believe the wildest
legends and skeptics who jokingly asked ``Where is Elvis buried?''
<p>
   The abbey is an independent charitable trust. The trustees hedge
wherever they can, at one point referring to the occupant of its
most famous grave site as ``the semi-legendary King Arthur.''
<p>
   The tomb of Arthur is said to have been found by the monks in
1191, shortly after a fire and at a time when the brothers were
nearly destitute.
<p>
   Historians today suggest that the ``discovery'' of Arthur may
have been a way to promote pilgrimages, a sort of medieval tourism.
(``Poor Arthur,'' a local told us over lager and cheese, ``they've
moved his body in the night all over England, depending on who
needs visitors the most.'')
<p>
   The actual site is marked simply by a stone outline with a sign
explaining that King Edward I and Queen Eleanor witnessed the
moving of Arthur and Guinevere's bodies in April 1278 to a black
marble tomb in Glastonbury. That tomb survived until the
dissolution of the abbey in 1539.
<p>
   Whether their remains were near our feet or not, the ruins of
the old abbey were inspiring  &MD;  the graceful interior arches solid
against the sky.
<p>
   In one corner, next to a still-used St. Patrick's Chapel was a
large thorn tree, one of three in Glastonbury supposedly grown from
the original that sprang from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea.
<p>
   Believed to be native to Syria, it is said to have the type of
thorns with which Jesus was crowned. It flowers twice a year  &MD; 
during Christmas and Easter week  &MD;  and blossoms are promptly
delivered to the reigning British monarch and the Queen Mother.
<p>
   We walked from the abbey to the Chalice Well, a distance of
about half a mile. There is a scientific explanation for the color
and therapeutic value of the spring.
<p>
   The water has a high iron content, which accounts for its
apparent color and perhaps the reputed fertility for women.
<p>
   According to the Chalice Well Trust, the Celtics and Druids
likely looked upon the spring as a holy well, since the reddish hue
of the water suggests the blood of childbirth.
<p>
   As we left the Chalice Well grounds and headed up the steep hill
of the Tor, we noticed a series of tents in a fenced-off pasture
with about 50 people milling around.
<p>
   A surreal happening, the group included a fair-haired lass in a
sari, a kilted bagpiper, children with gaily painted faces prancing
about smoldering bonfires and a dog with pastel ashes on its feet
and muzzle.
<p>
   As we tried to understand what was going on, a jubilant
``crusader'' invited us to join in.
<p>
   It was, we were told, a Hindu wedding, and who could refuse an
invitation to the nuptials on what was turning out to be a most
extraordinary day.

``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.) &LR; 
 &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   ``Man was never meant to walk upright,'' an orthopedist once
told us. ``When he stood up, that's when his back problems began.''
<p>
   We think when man began to travel, his back problems got even
worse. That certainly became true when he began flying around in a
one-size-fits-all airplane seat.
<p>
   We say ``man,'' because, statistically, far more men than women
develop lower-back pain  &MD;  problems ranging from arthritis to an
uppity disk.
<p>
   And more than half of us will develop some kind of back problem
by the time we're 60.
<p>
   Flying in an airplane is one of the worst things you can do to
your back. Airplane seats give such poor back support that you
might as well be sitting against a board.
<p>
   At least modern autos and first-class railroad seats have some
kind of lumbar support built in.
<p>
   TIP: When you walk onto the plane, reach up and get one of those
little white pillows. But don't use it for a headrest. Instead,
stuff it behind the small of your back before you strap yourself
in. Leave it there for the whole flight, whether you're sitting up
and eating or reclining and napping.
<p>
   At first, it may feel unnatural, even uncomfortable. But by the
time the plane has left the airport, the pillow will have fitted to
the shape of your back, and you'll forget it's there.
<p>
   Incidentally, those little inflatable horseshoe-shaped pillows
offer the best support for a restful snooze while your in flight.
 &UR; OTHER IN-FLIGHT BACK-SAVERS &LR; 
<p>
   Here are some ideas to help save your back during air travel:
<p>
    &UR;  &MD;  Get an aisle seat. &LR;  That gives you a few extra inches to do
shoulder shrugs, ankle twists, neck rolls and other range-of-motion
exercises. And do them every hour or so.
<p>
    &UR;  &MD;  Get up and walk around the airplane. &LR;  This works especially
well on one of the big planes with double aisles that they use for
overseas flights.
<p>
   You can loop the whole fuselage  &MD;  all four or five cabins  &MD; 
several times (maybe a quarter-mile walk) before the flight
attendant catches on. Take the stroll every couple of hours.
<p>
   Those bold individuals flying on a B-747 can get extra exercise
by rushing up and down the stairway.
<p>
   Dr. Susan Zahalsky, who works at the Midway Hospital Medical
Center in Los Angeles, has some other ideas to help your back when
you're high in the sky:
<p>
    &MD;  Elevating your feet so your knees are higher than your hips
relieves the strain on your lower back. If your seat doesn't have
an elevated footrest, ask the flight attendant for a stack of
magazines to put under your feet. Or prop your feet up by using a
carry-on bag.
<p>
    &MD;  While you're walking around the cabin, flex backward at the
waist several times. This straightens out your spine.
<p>
   And men should take their wallets out of their back pockets.
Prolonged sitting on such a lump can put pressure on the sciatic
nerve, causing back pain and sharp pains down your leg.
 &UR; DOWN-TO-EARTH BACK-SAVERS &LR; 
<p>
   Here are some other ideas that will prevent you from hurting
your back while you're on the road:
<p>
    &MD;  If you're on a train or bus, the same advice applies as for
travelers on planes: Keep the joints loose, and get up and walk
around whenever you can.
<p>
    &MD;  If you're driving a recreational vehicle or an auto, that's
even more important. Stop every two hours.
<p>
   Don't just start looking for a coffee shop  &MD;  every two hours,
pull off the side of the road and STOP.
<p>
   Get out, spend a few minutes walking around the car. Stretch
your arms, legs and back. Do whatever it takes to loosen up.
<p>
   This will not only keep your back in fairly good shape, it will
help keep you awake as well.
<p>
    &MD;  Pack lightly. Women, especially, have a hard time realizing
that the same people won't be seeing you at dinner night after
night. You can wear the same clothes.
<p>
   More importantly, don't pack more luggage than you can carry by
yourself  &MD;  even if ``porterage'' is included in your package trip,
never count on it. Invariably there will be a strike, a mix-up or
some other calamity, and you'll end up carting your own bags, as we
did once, almost a half-mile from the Venice railroad station to
the Grand Canal.
<p>
   And it's better to pack in two small bags rather than one large
one  &MD;  that way you can balance the load.
<p>
    &MD;  Wear a fannypack instead of carrying a purse.
<p>
   A purse, whether slung or hauled over one shoulder, will have
you leaning to one side before a long walking tour is over.
<p>
   On the other hand, a fannypack distributes the weight evenly
around your waist  &MD;  and it's better protection for your valuables.
<p>
   If you carry lots of heavy things in your purse, carrying them
in your fannypack may make you just as tired. But it won't make
your neck and back sore.
<p>
   And while you're on the road, baby your back just as you do at
home: Lift things from the knees, avoid soft chairs and deep
couches, don't lean across wide bathroom counters to shave and
don't bend over sinks to wash your hair.
<p>
   Whenever you travel, ask your doctor for a muscle relaxant to
take along. An aspirin is a good substitute, but don't use it like
candy.
<p>
   If back pain begins, take one instantly. Spend about 30 minutes
in the hottest tub you can stand to relieve any spasms. Then go to
bed and rest  &MD;  it may take a day or more in bed, but do it without
a whimper.
<p>
   After all, spending one day of your vacation to get your back
well can pay off if you can travel pain-free for the rest of your
life.

<p>
   FORT WORTH, Texas  &MD;  Photos on the Planet Out Web page include
two men kissing and a pair of women embracing.
<p>
   The organization that runs the site is linked with some of the
most prominent gay and lesbian activist groups in the country,
including Queer Nation and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
<p>
   But at the Kingdom, a new online service based in Fort Worth,
the site is banned. Owner Jerry Woods says www.planetout.com
attracts children and should be blocked from customers' view, along
with pornographic pages and foul chat language.
<p>
   ``If they took the picture off of two guys kissing, then shucks,
someone can read it to their heart's content,'' Woods says.
``Kissing isn't pornography, but we step into a different value
system when it is two people of the same sex.''
<p>
   The Kingdom's online service is aimed at Christian users and
people whom Woods describes as having family values. At barely more
than a year old, the tiny company of six employees has fewer than
250 subscribers, and some experts say it has picked a hard market
to reach. But Woods, who is an electrical engineer, and his wife,
Angela, who handles sales, say the business can weather the
increasing competition in cyberspace.
<p>
   It won't be easy, says Quentin Schultze, a communications
professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., and the author
of the book ``Internet for Christians.''
<p>
   ``Attempts have, in general, failed miserably,'' Schultze says.
``They have not been able to provide enough perceived value for
religious users compared with what is out there on the Net.''
<p>
   Woods came up with the idea for a family-oriented online system
after ``we prayed about it,'' he says. He also wanted a way to
spend time with Angela, whom he had married about two years
earlier.
<p>
   ``Look at her,'' Woods said, gesturing to a blushing Angela at a
recent lunch. ``She is beautiful. I wanted her around me all the
time.''
<p>
   He raised about $250,000, 90 percent of which came from
relatives and friends, and the rest of which came from the sale of
Coherent Light Services, a Fort Worth peripherals business he had
owned, Woods says.
<p>
   When he started the Kingdom, Woods had his hands full raising
three young daughters, including an infant, all by his first wife,
who died three years ago. Still, he set up the business in his busy
home, installing 50 phone lines and a high-speed access cable.
<p>
   Angela, whom he had met through the Calvary Cathedral in Fort
Worth, kept the girls quiet during conferences (''Sssh! Daddy's on
the phone!'') and marketing duties. She speaks mostly to women's
professional groups, whose members have been made anxious by news
reports about pornography and stalking online.
<p>
   ``Moms really make a lot of the buying decisions,'' Woods says.
<p>
   The company, which has since moved to an office in North
Richland Hills, offers not only original content, but also Internet
access. The Kingdom tracks and blocks more than 30,000 sites that
it classifies as obscene or conflicting with family values.
<p>
   The Kingdom also offers chat rooms and news groups on different
topics, including Christians in business and home schooling. It has
a children's area, which it calls Little Blessings, and a social
gathering place called the Hallelujah Cafe. Employees end phone
conversations with ``Bless you, goodbye!''
<p>
   A subscription, which includes unlimited access, costs $24.95 a
month. Prepaid, the service costs $12.50 a month.
<p>
   ``Cuss words'' are not allowed. Rival Internet providers often
discontinue the accounts of customers who broadcast pornography.
But users trying to access porn or funnel a four-letter word
through the Kingdom are sent a message saying such behavior is
prohibited.
<p>
   ``We are going to help you by making sure you are taken care
of,'' Woods says. ``We are not going to drive you out.''
<p>
   But Schultze says many Christian or family-oriented consumers
don't need a service like the Kingdom because of an existing
abundance of parental monitoring software. People who want to
protect their children can do it themselves and still get a choice
in online services, he says.
<p>
   ``They may be able to swing a great price,'' he says.
<p>
   The service is also withholding crucial information to a large
community by blocking such sites as Planet Out, says Mary Gray,
producer of the Planet Out chat area.
<p>
   Gray says she knows of no other services that block Planet Out,
which has received investment capital from America Online and is
promoted on the Microsoft Network.
<p>
   But she says, ``It is always a shame to hear about a service
that blocks vital information to people who otherwise can't get
that information.
<p>
   ``It is so hard for me to understand how, in their minds, it
crosses a boundary when you have two people in love kissing. It is
kind of beyond me.''
<p>
   Still, Woods says, the Kingdom provides a valuable service to
families who don't have the time or expertise to configure their
own monitoring software or constantly screen online content.
<p>
   The business also helps raise money for schools by letting
students sell Kingdom subscriptions, earning $20 per sign-up.
<p>
   ``We are blazing a trail,'' he says.

    &UR;  &MD;  Get up and walk around the airplane. &LR;  This works especially
well on one of the big planes with double aisles that they use for
overseas flights.
<p>
   You can loop the whole fuselage  &MD;  all four or five cabins  &MD; 
several times (maybe a quarter-mile walk) before the flight
attendant catches on. Take the stroll every couple of hours.
<p>
   Those bold individuals flying on a B-747 can get extra exercise
by rushing up and down the stairway.
<p>
   Dr. Susan Zahalsky, who works at the Midway Hospital Medical
Center in Los Angeles, has some other ideas to help your back when
you're high in the sky:
<p>
    &MD;  Elevating your feet so your knees are higher than your hips
relieves the strain on your lower back. If your seat doesn't have
an elevated footrest, ask the flight attendant for a stack of
magazines to put under your feet. Or prop your feet up by using a
carry-on bag.
<p>
    &MD;  While you're walking around the cabin, flex backward at the
waist several times. This straightens out your spine.
<p>
   And men should take their wallets out of their back pockets.
Prolonged sitting on such a lump can put pressure on the sciatic
nerve, causing back pain and sharp pains down your leg.
 &UR; DOWN-TO-EARTH BACK-SAVERS &LR; 
<p>
   Here are some other ideas that will prevent you from hurting
your back while you're on the road:
<p>
    &MD;  If you're on a train or bus, the same advice applies as for
travelers on planes: Keep the joints loose, and get up and walk
around whenever you can.
<p>
    &MD;  If you're driving a recreational vehicle or an auto, that's
even more important. Stop every two hours.
<p>
   Don't just start looking for a coffee shop  &MD;  every two hours,
pull off the side of the road and STOP.
<p>
   Get out, spend a few minutes walking around the car. Stretch
your arms, legs and back. Do whatever it takes to loosen up.
<p>
   This will not only keep your back in fairly good shape, it will
help keep you awake as well.
<p>
    &MD;  Pack lightly. Women, especially, have a hard time realizing
that the same people won't be seeing you at dinner night after
night. You can wear the same clothes.
<p>
   More importantly, don't pack more luggage than you can carry by
yourself  &MD;  even if ``porterage'' is included in your package trip,
never count on it. Invariably there will be a strike, a mix-up or
some other calamity, and you'll end up carting your own bags, as we
did once, almost a half-mile from the Venice railroad station to
the Grand Canal.
<p>
   And it's better to pack in two small bags rather than one large
one  &MD;  that way you can balance the load.
<p>
    &MD;  Wear a fannypack instead of carrying a purse.
<p>
   A purse, whether slung or hauled over one shoulder, will have
you leaning to one side before a long walking tour is over.
<p>
   On the other hand, a fannypack distributes the weight evenly
around your waist  &MD;  and it's better protection for your valuables.
<p>
   If you carry lots of heavy things in your purse, carrying them
in your fannypack may make you just as tired. But it won't make
your neck and back sore.
<p>
   And while you're on the road, baby your back just as you do at
home: Lift things from the knees, avoid soft chairs and deep
couches, don't lean across wide bathroom counters to shave and
don't bend over sinks to wash your hair.
<p>
   Whenever you travel, ask your doctor for a muscle relaxant to
take along. An aspirin is a good substitute, but don't use it like
candy.
<p>
   If back pain begins, take one instantly. Spend about 30 minutes
in the hottest tub you can stand to relieve any spasms. Then go to
bed and rest  &MD;  it may take a day or more in bed, but do it without
a whimper.
<p>
   After all, spending one day of your vacation to get your back
well can pay off if you can travel pain-free for the rest of your
life.

<p>
   Armonk, New York, Jan. 21 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s fourth-quarter profit rose a less-than-expected 18
percent as a stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hurt
results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Results were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   ``We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a
difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe
and a greater-than-expected currency impact,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
<p>
   IBM's stock rose 1 to 168. Results were released after the close
of trading. The stock has climbed to its highest levels in almost
10 years and is just shy of its all-time high of 174 3/4 reached in
August 1987.
<p>
   IBM said revenue was slightly lower than expected because of
slack demand in Europe and a bigger-than-expected impact from a
stronger dollar.
<p>
   Currency cost the company 3 percentage points of revenue growth,
or 18 cents a share in earnings, in the fourth quarter, IBM said. A
year ago, currency had a 2 percentage point positive impact.
<p>
   On a constant currency basis, Gerstner said IBM's revenue rose 9
percent, its best showing since 1985.
<p>
   IBM's gross profit margin narrowed to 40.3 percent from 41.7
percent in the year-earlier period. Gross margin is the percentage
of sales remaining after the costs of manufacturing are subtracted.
<p>
   Services was a bright spot, with sales up 22 percent to $5.0
billion.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 sales declined and
RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from year-earlier levels.
<p>
   Software revenue increased 4 percent to $3.7 billion.
<p>
   IBM Microelectronic revenue declined, and the company said price
drops and weak demand in dynamic random-access memory hurt those
results. Still, the company said it remains optimistic about its
prospects for this year.
<p>
   ``I feel pretty good about 1997. We face strong product demand
for all product lines,'' said Chief Financial Officer Richard
Thoman in a conference with analysts.

<p>
   Sorry, Munchkins, as annual TV events go, the array of
commercials in the Super Bowl broadcast are quickly coming to rival
even The Wizard of Oz as audience draws. Plus, oh yeah, the
football.
<p>
   And why not? For establishing Apple as the anti-establishment
multinational computer company, or making frogs the spokesmodels of
Budweiser, there is no venue like the Bowl. If the true football
fans are draining municipal water systems during the timeouts,
it'll be the ad professionals making hurried toilet stops during
the third-and-short plays.
<p>
   Madison Avenue airs its best stuff for the Super Bowl. But
enough of that. This is about the bad commercials.
<p>
   For advertising professionals gather in a little-known corner of
the Internet's discussion forums, the Usenet newsgroup
alt.tv.commercials. And there recently they, plus students and
members of the consuming public, shared dishonors for what they
consider the worst commercials on TV.
<p>
   For example, Calvin Klein's spots. What is he trying to tell us
with those hollow-eyed, anorexic models and their letter-bomb
hairstyles? Are potential buyers supposed to identify with runaways
and flee to the upscale boutiques where all the runaways buy their
$50 colognes? ``These are scary commercials, any way you look at
it,'' a Usenet contributor said. ``I sure hope Calvin Klein doesn't
write a book.''
<p>
   And another laureate was the Bagel Bites ads with the basic
pitch, ``Now the kids can have pizza whenever they want, when they
eat our product ... delicious pizzas on wholesome little bagels!''
<p>
   As a contributor said, ``English translation: `Look! We've found
a new way to palm our processed meat/cheese by-products on the
public by slapping it on some toast, and telling the people that
they can eat it whenever they want because ... IT'S WHOLESOME!'''
<p>
   ``I think the irritating implication here is that `when pizza's
on a bagel, you can eat pizza anytime!' replied another user. `If I
put chocolate mousse on a bagel, can I eat it anytime?''
<p>
   Then there was the mini-waffle product with the syrup and butter
baked right in, the farmer's friend because he doesn't have time to
adorn proper waffles with the right amount of fat and sugar. So why
doesn't he get up with his wife, who apparently beat him to the
kitchen by hours, or his son, who's out in the barn doing the
milking already?
<p>
   Oh dear, next is General Motors. Well, let the critics tell it:
<p>
   ``The commercial that really irritates me is the Saturn
commercial in which Julie gets her first car,` one participant
said. `It makes it look like Saturn is helping Julie move out of
public housing. Wait'll Julie gets her first insurance bill or,
here in Virginia, pays her first personal property tax.''
<p>
   ``Yeah,'' chimed in another critic. ``You would think her new
Saturn had just been built by a special branch of Habitat for
Humanity that builds cars for people who can't afford one.''
<p>
   ``To me, its the music that I find most irritating about this
commercial,'' said another. ``Kind of a `sorry, your wife died in
childbirth delivering this beautiful baby' feel to it, if you ask
me.''
<p>
   The latest dead-star ad, using Fred Astair with a Dirt Devil
vacuum cleaner morphed into the action, is getting loud hoots on
the commercialism-vs.-morality front. ``I can understand John Wayne
for beer, but Fred Astaire with a VACUUM CLEANER?'' they wonder.
<p>
   But then there are the favorites, too, and in
alt.tv.commercials. they like the latest series of Snickers candy
bar spots. One has the groundskeeper painstakingly painting the end
zone until a player says, ``Nice work, but who are the Chefs?'' And
the injured and benched player who thinks he's Batman. And of
course everyone's favorite, the long line of clergymen pronouncing
the pregame prayers (``Thanks, Bagwan, that was very touching.
Next,'' says the coach).
<p>
   The lineup for the Super Bowl ads will be as prayerful as that
patient team's, and the ad critics will be lined up patiently too
-for the station breaks.

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  The San Francisco Digital Media Center has put a
new spin on the age-old practice of telling stories around the
campfire.
<p>
   Run by artists Dana Atchley, Joe Lambert and Nina Mullen, the
center teaches people how to use computer software to turn their
family pictures and mementos into multimedia stories.
<p>
   ``We teach people how to use new computer tools to do things
people have been doing since the dawn of time, which is to tell
stories,'' Atchley said.
<p>
   As a printer, performer and broadcast producer, Atchley has been
telling stories for more than 25 years. The Digital Media Center,
which he runs with Lambert and Mullen, holds weekend classes to
impart some of what he has learned about the computer tools and
techniques of editing pictures, film clips and audio recordings.
<p>
   The objective of the $325 classes is to teach novices how to
meld narratives and photographs with sound and video. Participants
leave the workshop with a three- to five-minute story that is
dubbed onto a videotape so they can share it with family and
friends.
<p>
   ``About 75 percent of the students are women,'' said Mullen.
``That's because women tend to be the people who collect the
scrapbooks and the photos and are the keepers of the family
history.''
<p>
   In addition to weekend classes, the center holds $20 dinners
that show off multimedia art. Thursday, for instance, the center
will present Mauve Desert, a CD-ROM created by Los Angeles artist
Adriene Jenik. It revolves around a teenage girl's rebellious
psyche.
<p>
   The Digital Media Center is only one of several places in the
Bay Area where people can get intensive training in how to use new
computer tools to create multimedia.
<p>
   A partial list of such training centers would include the Bay
Area Video Coalition, the Media Alliance, San Francisco State
University's Multimedia Studies Program, the Kala Institute in
Berkeley, the Digiquest Learning Center in Marin County, United
Digital Artists in Burlingame and the extension program at Cal
State Hayward.
<p>
   But Lambert, of the S.F. Digital Media Center, said the most
important aspect of any training program was not the technology but
the technique of telling a story.
<p>
   ``What we have to overcome is everybody's fear of the vacation
slide show that goes on forever,'' Lambert said. ``Part of what we
do is make you comfortable with the technology, but the important
thing is choose a story line. That becomes the way you select what
gets in and what gets left out.''
<p>
   The center, which was founded in 1993 and has struggled along
ever since, has recently branched out into using the Internet as a
way to share personal stories. As such, it has become part of a
growing artistic and journalistic movement in The City that seeks
to counter the commercialization of the World Wide Web with stories
of personal or political significance.
<p>
   One example of this is the home page that San Francisco artist
Abbe Don created to tell the stories of her mother, grandmother and
great-grandmother (see www.bubbe.com). The page opens with a visit
to Bubbe's ``back porch,'' where her family's stories are told. The
site also contains tips for creating a family Web page and links to
other family history pages as a source of inspiration and ideas.
<p>
   On a more political bent, San Francisco photojournalist Tripp
Mikich has been putting documentary photography and audio
recordings on the FocalPoint f/8 Web site (www.f8.com). One of his
collaborators, Gary Matoso, recently pushed the concept of
Web-based stories further in a project called ``Roads to Refuge.''
<p>
   Supported in part by the United Nations High Commission on
Refugees, Matoso has created three-dimensional views of refugee
camps in Bosnia and Mali that can be viewed over the Web (see
www.worldmedialive.com).
<p>
   But all the practitioners of these new digital arts share a
common concern: that the technology not become more important than
the story.
<p>
   ``What exciting is that computer tools now let us do what only
professional video editors could do five or six years ago,''
Atchley said.
<p>
   Just as copy machines and desktop publishing made it easier for
people to get their words into print, Atchley said the new
multimedia tools would enable people to blend sounds and pictures.
<p>
   ``That's what I've been working for all these years, to find
ways for people to tell their own stories instead of waiting for
the networks to tell them for us,'' he said.

Center call (415) 824-9394.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Digital Equipment Corp. will
get a chance to reduce a $5.93 million jury award to three women
claiming injuries from repeated use of Digital's keyboards.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein today granted the Maynard,
Massachusetts-based computer maker's request for a hearing to
reduce the award. The hearing is expected later this month or in
early February.
<p>
   A federal jury on Dec. 4 ordered Digital to pay $5.35 million to
Patricia Geressy, $306,000 to Jill M. Jackson, and $278,000 to
Jeanette Rotolo. The Brooklyn jury found that Digital failed to
warn them of injuries they could suffer from repeated use of
Digital's LK 201 keyboards.
<p>
   It was the first jury award for people claiming injuries from
repeated keyboard use. Before the verdict against Digital, computer
makers had won 21 of 22 repetitive-stress suits from jury verdicts
and other rulings on the evidence.
<p>
   The one previous loss for the industry was an $85,000 award to a
woman who had worked with a bar-code scanner.
<p>
   More than 2,000 keyboard-injury suits are pending against
computer makers.
<p>
   When Digital argues to reduce the $5.93 million award, it should
have product-liability lawyers compare jury awards against
manufacturers for similar injuries, Judge Weinstein said during a
hearing today in Brooklyn.

of Roche Holding unit and rising share price.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Roche Holding AG's strategic
intentions again jumped to the forefront today as shares in the
Swiss drugmaker surged on speculation it could be planning a major
acquisition.
<p>
   In an industry where the companies keep getting bigger and their
numbers get smaller, the cash-rich Roche is almost sure to make a
major acquisition soon, analysts say.
<p>
   Such speculation is not new. For several years, shares in
possible targets like Britain's Zeneca Group Plc, Warner-Lambert
Co. in the U.S. and Sweden's Astra AB have jumped with the view
that Roche could be looking to buy them.
<p>
   While the company insists it is well placed without an
acquisition, shares rose today as much as 11 percent on what
analysts said was speculation it could be poised to sell its
under-performing Givaudan-Roure fragrances and flavorings division.
The proceeds could be used to further build its $10 billion war
chest for a major purchase, they say.
<p>
   ``If Roche wanted to shed a unit before strengthening its
pharmaceuticals portfolio, Givaudan would be a prime candidate,''
said Claudio Werder, an analyst at Bank J. Vontobel AG. ``It's the
one unit that fits least into the company's strategy.''
<p>
   Roche's widely traded non-voting shares jumped as high as 12,500
Swiss francs ($8,729), an intraday record, while its closely-held
bearer shares rose 250 francs, or 1.6 percent, to 15,950 francs.
<p>
   Speculation about a major Roche acquisition was heightened last
year when Sandoz AG and Ciba-Geigy AG joined to form Novartis AG.
The creation of Novartis, which received U.S. approval in December,
pushed Roche off of first place in the Swiss drugmaker league
table.
<p>
   ``Last summer, everybody was only talking about Novartis,'' said
Patrick Carisch, head of equities at Credit Suisse Asset Management
and a Roche shareholder. ``Now, Roche is back en vogue, and people
obviously expect something from the company sooner or later.''
<p>
   While Roche faces patent expirations of major drugs in several
years, the company that built itself on the success of the
antidepressant Valium has possible blockbuster drugs close to
market that could push growth, along with a big foothold in the
booming biotechnology market.
<p>
   The nagging question in investors' minds is whether the
Ciba-Sandoz union will prompt Roche to spend some of its $10
billion cash pile on an acquisition. The Ciba-Sandoz union merger,
which received final U.S. approval in December, booted Roche from
first to second place in the Swiss drugmaker league table and
eighth place worldwide.
<p>
   Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Stuart Harris estimates Roche
could put together financing of $20 billion more. ``They could fund
a deal pretty easily,'' he said. b0 The market has moved fast to
drive up share prices of potential takeover targets, betting that
Roche would soon jump back on the takeover bandwagon after its
successful $5.3 billion takeover of the Syntex Corp. in the U.S. in
1994.
<p>
   Two years ago, Zeneca, viewed as Roche's dream target for its
portfolio of new cardiovascular and cancer drugs, could have been
bought for half the $30 billion it would take today.
<p>
   Or, if Roche wanted to expand in the flourishing
over-the-counter healthcare products market like rival SmithKline
Beecham Plc, it could have bought Warner-Lambert Co., a U.S. market
leader with brands like Schick razors and Halls cough drops, for
around $15 billion in 1994. Now it would take twice that, analysts
said.
<p>
   Recently, even SmithKline was considered a Roche takeover
target. The blockbuster acquisition could easily cost $35 billion
or more, and would vault Roche beyond Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc
and Novartis, the two largest drug companies in market share.
<p>
   In an industry that has seen a record of nearly $100 billion
worth of mergers and acquisitions since 1994, such a bid could be
justified. No drugmaker now has more than 5 percent of the world
market. Analysts and industry executives say a 10 percent market
share is a good base for survival in a rapidly changing
marketplace. A Roche-SmithKline merger would put it closer to that,
though not all the way.
<p>
   Combating newly powerful group buyers of drugs and struggling to
cut costs to fund expensive research and development operations,
the worldwide drug industry has seen dozens of agreed or forced
marriages in recent years.
<p>
   The largest include Glaxo's $14.7 billion Wellcome takeover,
American Home Products Corp. purchase of American Cyanamid for $9.7
billion and Hoechst AG's purchase of Marion Merrill Dow for $7.1
billion.
<p>
   Roche says it's in no hurry to make an acquisition, which
analysts say may be partly because three founding families of the
company still control more than 50 percent of the voting stock.
They reportedly don't want their holdings diluted, as they would be
in a stock swap merger like that of Novartis.
<p>
   That leaves debt financing, a more expensive route, though one
which Roche hasn't been afraid to use. In addition to Syntex, Roche
paid cash in 1990 when it bought a controlling stake in
California-based Genentech Inc., one of the world's oldest and most
successful biotechnology companies, for $2.1 billion.
<p>
   Max Gurtner, spokesman for Roche, scoffs at the notion the
company is under pressure to buy anything.
<p>
   ``We will always remain subject to all these rumors because we
have this cash pile,'' said Gurtner. ``That will continue.''
<p>
   To counterbalance the argument that it must acquire something,
Gurtner points to Roche's unblemished record earnings growth in the
last nine years and strong pipeline of promising products.
<p>
   Last week, the company said 1996 sales had grown 11 percent to
15.9 billion Swiss francs ($11.6 billion) and that it expects
another rise in net profit in 1996, which it reports later in the
year.
<p>
   Like all drugmakers, Roche wants to expand its product base.
While it faces a patent expiration to one of its largest products,
the anesthetic Dormicum, also called Versed, in the U.S. in three
years, other products are in a stronger patent position.
<p>
   Its biggest seller, the widely used antibiotic Rocephin, which
generated 1.2 billion Swiss francs in 1995, won't face generic
competitors until 2002, analysts say, well after other products
will have reached the market.
<p>
   ``They are not in the situation of an Astra or a Glaxo, where
they have a huge product going off patent,'' said Genghis
Lloyd-Harris, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst who rates the
stock a ``buy.''
<p>
   Among the products that are expected to drive strong growth are
the anti-obesity drug Xenical, which was filed for approval in the
U.S. last month; Posicor, a next generation calcium channel blocker
heart medication, and Invirase, a new AIDS medication that adds to
a stable of two other drugs to treat the deadly disease, Hivid and
Cytovene.
<p>
   Still, analysts think the company will make an acquisition soon.
<p>
   Lloyd-Harris said that while Roche has made a healthy, 14
percent return on its cash resources in recent years, the funds
could become too large in comparison to its drug operations in
coming years. This may be an enviable position for some but one
which raises questions about appropriate use of shareholders'
wealth, he said.
<p>
   ``There comes a point that your cash pool gets too big,'' said
Lloyd-Harris, which could be ``a compelling reason'' for an
acquisition.
<p>
   Speculation that disagreements on the need for an acquisition
may arise among Roche shareholders was evident this month when
Martin Ebner, the Swiss financier behind BZ Group, a Roche
shareholder, acknowledged that he had recently sold part of voting,
``bearer'' shares in the company.
<p>
   Ebner, at a press conference, denied it had to do with
disagreements. He didn't elaborate further.
<p>
   ``That's not because we're unhappy with the management, but
because we wanted to broaden our holdings,'' said Ebner.

<p>
   Paris, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics NV plunged 11 percent after Europe's biggest
semiconductor maker said fourth-quarter profit fell 15.5 percent
and warned revenue could fall in the first quarter. Fourth-quarter
net fell to $142 million, or $1.02 a share, on sales of $1.06
billion. In the 1995 quarter, the company earned $168 million, or
$1.24 a share, on sales of $974.7 million. The latest net was in
line with the $1.01 a share expected by 11 analysts polled by IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   The company said first-quarter sales will fall to about $988.4
million, hurt by pricing pressures caused by oversupply in its
lower-margin memory products. It expects renewed growth throughout
the rest of the year.
<p>
   ``SGS-Thomson's only problem is its share price has run ahead of
itself, in tandem with Intel, going too far too fast,'' said
Kenneth Anderson, a portfolio manager at Edinburgh-based Scottish
Widows Investment Management Ltd., which has some 20 billion pounds
($33 billion) in assets. ``The earnings and outlook in themselves
were broadly in keeping with expectations,'' he added.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson's warning comes a week after Intel Corp., the
world's biggest chipmaker, said rising expenses, price cuts and a
seasonal dip in demand will hamper its earnings too. Its shares
also tumbled on the news.
<p>
   Shares of SGS-Thomson had more than doubled over the past 12
months. They rose 14 percent over the past week after Salomon
Brothers and Lehman Brothers increased their 12-month target for
the company's American depository receipts to $100. Lehman Brothers
reiterated that target price in a note today.
<p>
   SGS shares were recently 11.2 percent lower at 383 French francs
($69.4), their biggest one-day drop ever. The ADR's fell 14.2
percent or 11 1/4, to 69 1/4.
<p>
   Still, analysts and investors said SGS-Thomson's emphasis on
making high-margin specialty chips for the exploding market of
more-sophisticated digital consumer electronics products should
allow it to see strong growth once the semiconductor market has
overcome its latest slump.
<p>
   ``In spite of its comments on this quarter, SGS is still a
growth story within the semiconductor industry,'' said Patricia
d'Ille, who manages a $20 million fund at Monte Paschi Banque.
<p>
   D'Ille said she was taking advantage of the dip in SGS-Thomson
shares to add them to her portfolio.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson has bucked the trend of falling semiconductor sales
at companies including Motorola Inc. of the U.S. by concentrating
on high-margin chips used in cellular telephones, computer disc
drives and digital-television signal decoders.
<p>
   Fourth-quarter sales at SGS-Thomson, a French-Italian company,
were up 9 percent from a year earlier. Sales for the year rose 16
percent from a year earlier to $4.12 billion, with the biggest
growth coming from high-margin ``differentiated'' chips.
<p>
   Orders for such chips represented 58.6 percent of net revenues
in 1996, up from 51.5 percent in 1995. They were 61.3 percent of
sales in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   As part of its strategy, SGS-Thomson forms alliances with other
companies, including Alcatel Alsthom SA, Northern Telecom Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and disk drive maker Seagate Technology Inc.,
to develop the sophisticated chips they need. Those and other
companies accounted for 31 percent of SGS- Thomson's 1996 sales.
<p>
   Analysts said that strategy should pay off in 1997, as demand
for mobile phones and digital decoders takes off.
<p>
   ``I'm quite optimistic for SGS-Thomson, especially when I look
at the new technologies they've developed and the advances they
have,'' said Jim Tully, a technology analyst at Dataquest.
<p>
   As part of this strategy, SGS-Thomson recently agreed to work
with Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest maker of software for
personal computers, to design a new product to make it easier to
play digital video discs, or DVDs, on personal computers. DVDs are
expected to eventually replace video cassette recorders and CD-ROMs
used in multimedia computers.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson has largely steered clear of the competitive
dynamic-random-access memory chip market, where average prices were
slashed 75 percent last year as a surplus of chips flooded the
market. These chips are primarily used in personal computers and
basic consumer-electronics goods.
<p>
   Full-year net income rose 19 percent to $625.5 million, or $4.50
a share, compared with $526.5 million, or $4.03 a share, in 1995.
Analysts had predicted full-year earnings of $4.46 a share.
Full-year operating income rose 23 percent to $799.4 million.
<p>
   Per-share earnings were based on average shares outstanding of
138.7 million compared with 130.6 million in 1995.
<p>
   Research and development costs rose 21 percent to $532.3 million
in 1996, representing 12.9 percent of revenue. Capital investments
totaled $1.12 billion for the year, up from $1.0 billion in 1995.
<p>
   The company said it expects capital spending in the first half
of 1997 to equal the $660 million it spent in the first half of
1996.
<p>
   As of Dec. 31, total debt was $623.1 million, including $194.9
million of long-term debt. Shareholders equity stood at $3.26
billion.
<p>
   Pasquale Pistorio, SGS-Thomson's president and chief executive,
said the company's low debt level gave it the agility it needed to
make new investments or even acquisitions if the opportunity
arises.
<p>
   ``There is no good (acquisition) opportunity in sight,'' he
added. Pistorio declined to comment on speculation SGS-Thomson's
shareholder structure could change in the near future.
<p>
   ``The job we have as managers is to make the company perform. We
don't see anything that could impact the company's performance,''
Pistorio said.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson is controlled by a group of Italian and French
state-owned companies, with only 30.6 percent of its shares
publicly traded.
<p>
   But as the French government moves to sell defense electronics
company Thomson-CSF and float a stake in France Telecom SA, those
companies might look to sell their stake in SGS-Thomson.
<p>
   Pistorio denied a press report that French Industry Minster
Franck Borotra had approached him about bringing in new
shareholders into the company's capital if state- controlled sell
their stake in the company.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2202, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302.
<p>
   Q: I recently heard a reference to ``fire jumpers'' in
connection with forest fires. What does that mean? Whom do these
people work for? How does one apply for such a job?
<p>
   A: Fire jumpers are trained ``wild land firefighters'' who
parachute into areas behind forest fires to help fight them from
that direction while others fight from the front. They work for the
U.S. Forest Service and/or the Bureau of Land Management. Many are
seasonal workers who are called upon on demand when regular forest
service firefighters need to be augmented.
<p>
   It's not possible for inexperienced people simply to sign up to
be fire jumpers, said Bill Dickson of the fire and aviation
division of the Forest Service's Atlanta regional office.
Considerable training is involved, and applicants must be
physically fit and ``young enough'' for the physical tasks
involved. They then go through basic entry-level firefighting
training and work their way up.
<p>
   There are training schools in the western United States. When
regular firefighting teams must be supplemented, ads are placed in
newspapers and state employment agencies in the areas where people
are needed, Dickson said.
<p>
   Q: Former Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) now is affiliated with
American Business Is Local Enterprise (ABLE), designed to get
estate tax relief for U.S. citizens. How can I contact him?
<p>
   A: You can write Packwood at his lobbying firm, Sunrise
Research, 2201 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Suite C-120, Washington, D.C.
20007; or call 202-965-9810.
<p>
   Q: Is there a difference between American cheese and American
cheese food? Products are labeled both ways in the dairy case.
<p>
   A: They are similar but there is a difference, said nutrition
expert Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia Cooperative
Extension Service. The main distinction is that cheese food has
less cheese, and more nonfat milk or whey solids and water added,
which leaves it with a slightly higher moisture content and lower
milk fat content. It's usually less expensive, too. Regular
processed cheese is a blend of fresh and aged natural cheese, which
has been shredded and mixed with an emulsifier, and then
pasteurized. Pasteurization stops the ripening and allows the
cheese to blend and develop a uniform flavor, body and texture.
<p>
   Q: Please settle a bet. My co-worker says Coca-Cola Co. once was
based in New York and moved to Atlanta. I say it always has been
based in Atlanta. Who is right?
<p>
   A: You are. Coca-Cola was created here in 1886 and has always
used Atlanta as the company's headquarters, said company
spokeswoman Susan McDermott. Your co-worker might be thinking of
another large soft drink company that is based in New York: Pepsi.
<p>
   Q: Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were executed in the 1950s for
spying for the Soviet Union and passing military secrets. Why
wasn't Aldrich Ames, who passed military secrets to the Russians
and caused people to die, also executed? 
<p>
   A: Ames was not executed because recent Supreme Court rulings
have rendered espionage a non-capital offense, said John Russell of
the U.S. Justice Department. The Rosenbergs  &MD;  the first spies ever
executed in the United States on orders of a civil court  &MD;  went to
the electric chair 10 minutes apart on June 19, 1953, at Sing Sing
Prison in Ossining, N.Y.
<p>
   Q: A recent article reported on students planning to dive into
the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off Key West, Fla., to study the
so-called slave ship Henrietta Marie. What evidence is there that
this was an actual slave vessel?
<p>
   A: The ship's wreckage was discovered in 1972 by Mel Fisher's
treasure hunters. In July 1983, while excavating and researching an
unidentified vessel wrecked off New Ground Reef in the Florida
Keys, a diver found the ship's watch bell. Under the bell's
encrustation were the words Henrietta Marie 1699. Other artifacts
uncovered include the largest collections of slave shackles and of
English-made William III pewterware ever found in one place.
Researchers found that the vessel had been a London-based
trafficker in human commerce and that it had wrecked around 1700
shortly after offloading a cargo of enslaved Africans in Jamaica.
<p>
   David Moore, a graduate student working with the Mel Fisher
Maritime Heritage Society in Key West, has devoted his professional
life to studies about the Henrietta Marie. Moore and other experts
consider the vessel the world's biggest source of tangible objects
representing the early period of the trade in enslaved Africans.
<p>
   Q: Does President Clinton still have his old Ford Mustang? Where
does he keep it?
<p>
   A: Clinton still owns the 1967 Mustang convertible. It's on
display at the Museum of Automobiles atop Petit Jean Mountain in
Morrilton, Ark. Clinton bought the car from his half-brother,
Roger, before he became president, and had it restored, said White
House spokeswoman Julie Green. When he left Arkansas for the the
White House, the car stayed behind in Little Rock. Clinton plans to
retrieve it from the museum when his presidency ends, Green said.
<p>
   Q: For 70 years I've been using home healing remedies made with
apple cider vinegar. Recently I discovered apple cider flavored
vinegar on store shelves. Are they one and the same?
<p>
   A: There is a difference. Apple cider flavored vinegar is white
vinegar made from corn, not from apple cider, said Connie Crawley,
nutritionist at the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension
Service. It gets its name because apple cider flavoring is added to
the white vinegar. If you're using it for folk remedies, stick to
real apple cider vinegar, not the flavored product. .

   Q: I'm reminded of the old ``rat pack,'' that Frank Sinatra used
to lead. Who were its members? Didn't they make some movies?
<p>
   A: In addition to Sinatra, the bon-vivant group of Hollwood
actors in the ``pack'' included Joey Bishop, Tony Curtis, Sammy
Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Dean Martin and Henry Silva. Various
members appeared in several movies together, including ``Oceans
Eleven`` (Warner, 1960), ``Sergeants Three'' (United Artists,
1962), ``Johnny Cool'' (United Artists, 1963), ``Robin and the
Seven Hoods'' (Warner, 1964), ``Salt and Pepper'' (United Artists,
1968) and ``One More Time'' (United Artists, 1970). Actress Shirley
MacLaine also has been mentioned as an occasional rat packer, but
she wasn't in the core group.
<p>
   Q: Will you refresh my memory about the ethics charges against
former House Speaker Jim Wright that resulted in his resignation?
<p>
   A: Wright (D-Texas), who was elected to the House in 1954,
became majority leader in 1976 and served as speaker from 1987 to
1989, resigned as speaker and as a member of Congress after the
House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct accused him of
breaking a number of House ethics rules. One charge was that he had
accepted about $145,000 worth of gifts from a Texas real estate
developer who was in a position to benefit directly from
legislation over which Wright had influence. The committee also
accused Wright of earning more income from outside sources than
House rules permitted by disguising it as earnings from the sale of
Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' Other improprieties
included Wright's reported use of a Dallas businessman's jet for a
three-day campaign trip in Texas in 1985; his insertion into the
Congressional Record of remarks promoting a videotape program being
sold by Pacific Institute, a Seattle company that was paying his
wife a $36,000 annual salary; and the payment by 10 special
interest groups of as much as $30,000 each to a longtime Wright
associate to fund opinion polls. On June 30, 1989, little more than
six weeks after the committee had charged him with 69 violations,
Wright announced his decision to step down.
<p>
   Q: What is the Navy's policy about burial at sea for someone who
once served in the Navy? Where is such burial done?
<p>
   A: The Burial at Sea program is open to active duty personnel,
retirees and honorably discharged members of the uniformed services
and their bona fide dependents. The Navy uses six major ports of
embarkation for the Burial at Sea program: Norfolk, Va.; Newport,
R.I., Jacksonville, Fla.; San Diego, Calif.; Bremerton, Wash.; and
Hawaii. For an information packet, call the Office of
Medical/Dental Affairs, Mortuary Affairs Branch, at 800-876-1131,
Ext. 603, 644 or 629.
<p>
   Q: At the sound of the closing bell of the New York Stock
Exchange, people in the balcony can be seen hammering the gavel.
Who are they?
<p>
   A: Most are trading floor managers, said Ray Pellecchia of the
NYSE, who hammer the gavel on a rotating system. They also open the
stock exchange. Heads of newly listed companies, retiring members
of the NYSE and visiting heads of state also get the honor,
Pellecchia said.
<p>
   Q: Has anyone been executed for the 1973 Alday family murders in
South Georgia?
<p>
   A: No. Carl Isaacs, one of three men convicted and sentenced to
death for the murders of six members of the Ned Alday family in
Seminole County, Ga., remains on death row where he continues to
appeal his sentence. The other two convicted killers, Wayne Carl
Coleman and George Dungee, had their death penalties overthrown in
1985 when the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals granted all three men a
new trial. They are currently serving multiple life sentences in
prison.
<p>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``caught red-handed''?
<p>
   A: In ancient times, ``to be taken with red hand'' was to be
caught in the act, like a murderer whose hands were dripping with
the victim's blood. The use of red hand in this sense dates to
15th- century Scotland and Scottish law. Sir Walter Scott's
``Ivanhoe'' contained an early print reference of ``taken
red-handed,'' meaning someone apprehended in the act of committing
a crime. It evolved into ``caught red-handed.''
<p>
   Q: Since Newt Gingrich's telephone conversation was apparently
intercepted illegally, are newspapers that publish the information
leaving themselves open for a lawsuit?
<p>
   A: Atlanta Journal-Constitution editors say the newspaper
violated no law in coming into possession of a copy of the cellular
conversation. An attorney for The New York Times, which also
obtained a copy of the tape, was asked much the same question.
George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for the Times, said:
``It has been a longstanding journalistic tradition, as well as
Supreme Court law, that the press may publish truthful and
newsworthy information it lawfully obtains.''
<p>
   Q: When will the knighting ceremonies for Paul McCartney be held
in London? Will they be open to the public? Where can fans write
him?
<p>
   A: No date has been announced. The Buckingham Palace ceremonies
will be at a mutually agreeable time to McCartney and the palace,
and they will be private, according to the British Embassy in
Washington. Such ceremonies often aren't even announced until after
the fact. Write to Paul McCartney, c/o MPL Communication Ltd., 1
Soho Square, London, England, W1V 6BQ. .

<p>
   Q: When one TV station goes to commercials and I switch
channels, I find commercials on the next one, too. Is that dictated
locally, or by the Federal Communications Commission?
<p>
   A: There's no law or rule governing when commercials are shown,
and they don't always run at the same time. You're probably
switching channels at the bottom of the hour, when programs end and
commercials begin. But programs on other channels end then, too,
and those stations also are going to commercials. It's not as
likely to happen within the shows, but most 30- minute situation
comedies are written for two commercial breaks, and it's possible
that they could occur at the same time as you switch from one
station to the next.
<p>
   Q: How did the Social Security's ``notch baby'' situation come
about, resulting in lowered Social Security payments for people
born in certain years? What administration did this to us?
<p>
   A: The notch baby issue is widely misunderstood, according to
the Social Security Administration. The agency insists it was not a
plan to give some people less money in benefits than they are
entitled to. To the contrary, the purpose of the 1977 legislation
correcting the benefit formula was to pay people benefits that are
``fair and appropriate.'' While it's true that some people receive
benefits smaller than others who had similar earnings but who were
born a year or two earlier, the alleged ``victim'' is receiving the
proper benefits, while the person receiving more is getting an
unintendended windfall, according to Social Security.
<p>
   The ``notch''  &MD;  the difference in payment rates to people born
between 1917 and 1921, and those paid to people born before then  &MD; 
was created by an act of Congress in 1977. The corrected formula
applies to people born in 1917 and afterward. Benefits for everyone
born from 1922 on are calculated using only the correct 1977
formula, the Social Security Administration says.
<p>
   Q: I'd like to write to members of the Oakland, Calif., school
board to express my opinion on the Ebonics issue. Do you have an
address?
<p>
   A: Oakland Unified School District, Board of Education, 1025
Second Ave., Room 320, Oakland, Calif. 94606.
<p>
   Q: In a recent radio broadcast, Paul Harvey referred to
hydrazine sulfate as a promising cancer-fighting medication. It
didn't sound like a commercial. How can I get more information?
<p>
   A: A spokeswoman for Paul Harvey News in Chicago said you need
to send a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with your request
for information to Dr. Joseph Gold, Syracuse Cancer Research
Institute, 600 E. Genesee St., Syracuse, N.Y. 13202. There's also a
web site on the Internet with extensive information:
www.ngen.com/hf-cancer .
<p>
   Q: I've heard that 40 percent of all Social Security payments go
to people whose average age is 30. Is this true?
<p>
   A: No way, says the Social Security Administration, although no
breakdown by ``average age'' is available. Last year, 45 million
people received benefits, said Patti Patterson, agency spokeswoman.
Of those, 32.3 million were 65 or older. So 12.7 million recipients
were younger than 65, and that entire group would constitute less
than 40 percent. Of the 7 million survivors of eligible
wage-earners who received benefits, 3.1 million were children,
Patterson said.
<p>
   Q: How can I write the Florida couple who taped Newt Gingrich's
cell phone conversation?
<p>
   A: Mail for Alice and John Martin can be sent to their attorney,
Larry Turner, 204 W. University Ave., Suite 6, Gainesville, Fla.
32601.
<p>
   Q: I once read an article about pet insurance, but the
veterinarians I have contacted don't have any information. Have
you?
<p>
   A: You're talking about Veterinary Pet Insurance of Anaheim,
Calif., which describes itself as the leading U.S. insurer of pets.
Founded in 1980, the company underwrites about 75,000 dogs and cats
and is licensed in 45 states (including Georgia). VPI has five
accident and illness plans with varying deductibles and premiums.
Major Medical Plan 40, for example, with a $40 deductible, has
annual premiums of $49 for puppies and kittens, $59 for pets 1 to 4
years old, and $79 for those 5 to 8. Subject to policy terms, the
insurance covers office calls, injections, prescriptions,
treatments, lab fees, X-rays, surgery and hospitalization.
Information: 800-872-7387.
<p>
   Q: What is the status of Loretta Sanchez, who won a hotly
contested race in California for the House seat held by Bob Dornan?
What was the vote recount?
<p>
   A: Sanchez was sworn into office when the 105th Congress
convened Jan. 8, but her election to represent California's 46th
Congressional District is still being challenged. The fight over
the results of the Nov. 6 election probably will continue through
January, and maybe beyond. After a recount requested by Dornan
showed Sanchez won by 979 votes, Dornan said he plans to contest
the election before a state court judge. Dornan's lawyer, Michael
Schroeder, said the figures don't add up. A review of voter sign-in
rosters, the machine count of ballots and a computer tape of the
election prepared later by registration clerks shows 1,985 more
ballots cast than reflected on sign-in sheets, Schroeder said. In
addition, he said, Dornan researchers identified 100 people who
voted twice, 200 people who had someone other than immediate family
turn in absentee ballots to voting places, and about 75 voters who
registered at business addresses, which is improper. Official vote
totals after the recount: Sanchez, Democrat, 48,056; Dornan,
Republican, 47,077; Lawrence Stafford, Reform, 3,232; Thomas
Reimer, Libertarian, 2,337; J. Carlos Aguirre, Natural Law, 1,972.

 &UR; CAPSULE REVIEWS OF CURRENT FILMS &QC; 
 &UR; c.1996 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   These brief reviews of current movies are written, unless
otherwise noted, by Cox News Service movie critic Eleanor Ringel.
They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.
<p>
   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if
viewed by children.
<p>
   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material
parents consider inappropriate for young children.
<p>
   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be
inappropriate for preteens.
<p>
   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking
children.
<p>
   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.
<p>
   NR: Not rated.
<p>
   The Associate PG-13
<p>
   Cute but rarely flat-out funny, this Whoopi Goldberg vehicle
boasts one giddy gimmick: Its star is made up to look like a white
man. Goldberg plays a gifted New York financial analyst who creates
a fictitious male partner in order to gain admittance into Wall
Street's big money boys' club. The movie suffers from several
logical leaps, and Goldberg's performance at times seems phoned in.
But the sight of her as a man  &MD;  she's like a rubberized Marlon
Brando  &MD;  is almost worth the ticket price. Rated PG-13 for language
and suggestive scenes. 1 hour, 54 minutes.
<p>
   Beavis and Butt-head Do America PG-13
<p>
   MTV's Beavis and Butt-head became a successful media franchise
by embodying and satirizing rock video's saturation of America's
suburban adolescent imagination; it's a cartoon that celebrates
anti-social mayhem and slackerdom and smart-mouthing. Blown up for
the big screen, none of this seems unique. The funniest bits in
``Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' are only that. Bits. The
road-movie concept, which has the clueless duo wreaking havoc from
coast to coast, is running on fumes within an hour. Rated PG-13 for
suggestive humor. 1 hour, 22 minutes.
<p>
   The Crucible PG-13
<p>
   Casts a powerful spell. Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan
Allen and Paul Scofield star in this tour-de-force adaptation of
Arthur Miller's play about the Salem, Mass., witch trials in 1692.
Directed by Nicholas Hytner, this is ferocious, impassioned
filmmaking at its finest, as well as a timely reminder that
scoundrel times can happen any time. Rated PG- 13 for brief nudity
and adult themes. 2 hours, 3 minutes.
<p>
   Daylight PG- 13
<p>
   Now age 50 and knowing his days of playing beefcake brawlers a
la Rambo are numbered, Sylvester Stallone invests the hero of his
latest action- adventure movie with a touch of humanity. As
disgraced paramedic Kit Latura, who stages a daring rescue attempt
in a collapsed New York tunnel, Stallone wrestles with self-doubt
and old demons. He cries and compromises. He wears chinos, for
crying out loud. Alas, the silly, slam-bang movie around him is
still wearing ammo belts and communicating in grunts. Rated PG-13
for violence and language. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
<p>
   The English Patient R
<p>
   An elusive, eloquent and sweepingly romantic epic that mixes the
old-fashioned grandeur of a David Lean film with the sort of
fragmented narrative that presumes an audience well-versed in MTV.
Based on the Michael Ondaatje prize- winning novel, the movie
shifts between an abandoned monastery in Tuscany and the Tunisian
desert. In the present, i.e., the waning days of World War II, a
mysterious and hideously scarred burn patient (Ralph Fiennes) is
tended to by an Allied nurse (a radiant Juliette Binoche).
Meanwhile, morphine-induced oases of memory take us back to his
buried past  &MD;  as a mapmaker in prewar North Africa who falls for a
married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas). Deftly interweaving several
stories into a poetic, elliptical mosaic of love, war, passion and
tragedy, Minghella's movie touches us as all great movies must  &MD; 
truly, madly, deeply. Rated R for sex, violence and nudity. 2
hours, 40 minutes.
<p>
   The Evening Star PG-13
<p>
   About half as good as ``Terms of Endearment''. . . which isn't
such a bad thing when you think about it. For those who care to
catch up with Aurora Greenway 15 years later, it'll feel like old
home week. But if you thought James L. Brooks' Oscar-sweeping
laugh-and-cry fest was a unique, complete experience, you can skip
the sequel. 2 hours, 9 minutes.
<p>
   Evita PG
<p>
   It keeps its promise. Don't keep your distance. Director Alan
Parker has shrewdly turned Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's
all-singing rock opera about Eva Peron into a music-video epic.
Madonna gives a charismatic performance as a small-town woman of
dubious reputation who became the most powerful woman in '40s
Argentina. Jonathan Pryce, as dictator/President Juan Peron, and
Antonio Banderas, as a kind of Argentinian Everyman, provide
excellent support. 2 hours, 13 minutes.
<p>
   Fierce Creatures PG-13
<p>
   The stars of the comedy classic ``A Fish Called Wanda''  &MD; 
including Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and John Cleese  &MD;  reunite
as all new characters in this farce about efforts to save a failing
London zoo.

<p>
   The First Wives Club PG
<p>
   An eager-to-please farce starring Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and
Bette Midler as middle-aged Manhattanites who've been discarded by
their husbands for younger models (Elizabeth Berkley and a
hilarious Sarah Jessica Parker). Brought together by the suicide of
a fourth friend (an unbilled Stockard Channing), the trio plots
revenge  &MD;  or justice, as they insist  &MD;  on their erring exes. Much
like the 1980 hit ``9 to 5,'' this make-nice movie starts sharp,
smart and nasty, then turns broad and unthreatening. Yes, it's
often very funny, but it's also frightened of its own shadow.
Still, it gives you your money's worth in wonderful comic acting.
These women are irrepressible and irreplaceable.
<p>
   Fly Away Home PG
<p>
   A first-class flight. To help a flock of orphaned Canada geese
migrate south, a sculptor-inventor (Jeff Daniels) teaches his
adolescent daughter (Oscar winner Anna Paquin) how to pilot a small
aircraft, then encourages her to fly solo. Yes, the premise veers
dangerously close to the real-life tragedy of Jessica Dubroff, the
7-year-old who crashed and died in April during a cross-country
solo flight. But in the sure hands of director Carroll Ballard
(``The Black Stallion''), this ``crazy idea'' becomes an uplifting
symbol of father-daughter bonding and environmental activism. Rated
PG for mild language and adult themes.
<p>
   The Garden of the Finzi-Continis R
<p>
   Hauntingly powerful. Spruced up with a new print and improved
sound in honor of its 25th anniversary, Vittorio De Sica's
late-in-life masterpiece won an Oscar in 1971 for best
foreign-language film. A wealthy, aristocratic Jewish family living
in Italy in the '30s refuses to hear  &MD;  or perhaps, cannot hear  &MD; 
the ominous approach of Hitler's Holocaust. Dominique Sanda plays
their lovely, imperious daughter. Rated R for nudity and adult
themes. In Italian with English subtitles. 1 hour, 35 minutes. 
<p>
   Get on the Bus R
<p>
   Issue-conscious director Spike Lee returns with his best movie
in years. Contrary to its billing, this film about a group of black
men riding into history is less about the destination  &MD;  the Million
Man March  &MD;  than the journeys each man made before he got on the
bus to Washington. Until this movie, Lee had not been successful at
tackling a variety of issues without leaving the audiences with
just as many questions. That's not the case here. The actors in the
ensemble cast brilliantly depict the fathers, former gang members
and homosexuals who join for the historic trip.
<p>
   Ghosts of Mississippi PG-13
<p>
   A true story that needs to be told. Rob Reiner's social drama
stars Alec Baldwin as the Mississippi prosecutor who, despite
considerable opposition, re-opened the case of slain civil-rights
activist Medgar Evers 30 years after his murder. James Woods has a
fine time as the Mean Ol' Boy killer, but Reiner encourages Whoopi
Goldberg, as Evers' determined widow, to act like a solemn cypher.
Rated PG-13 for violence, language and adult themes. 2 hours, 3
minutes.
<p>
   Hamlet PG-13
<p>
   Kenneth Branagh directed and stars in the first film version of
Shakespeare's immortal tragedy in its entirety (the movie's four
hours long). The wildly diverse cast ranges from the obvious (Kate
Winslet as Ophelia) to the eccentric (Jack Lemmon as Marcellus). 
<p>
   Jackie Chan's First Strike PG-13
<p>
   In a Jackie Chan flick, the last thing you worry about is the
plot. Our amiable cop hero Jackie (Chan) goes from Hong Kong to the
snowy Ukraine and from there to sunny Australia (via Moscow, no
less), propelled by mumbo jumbo about the CIA, the KGB, a stolen
tank of uranium. But what really matters is when he picks up a pair
of stilts, a couple of brooms or a folding aluminum ladder to fight
the bad dudes. Mixing the little-guy persona of Chaplin, the
courteous grace of Astaire and the high kicks of Lee (Bruce, that
is), Chan's athletic feats gain extra power from our knowing that
he does the stunts himself. His new film doesn't top any of the
stunts from his earlier Hong Kong films, but it's an
adrenalin-laced bonbon. 1 hour, 28 minutes.

<p>
   Jerry Maguire R
<p>
   Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise plays a slick sports agent who
loses everything he thinks is important  &MD;  his job, his
prestigiously beautiful fiancee, the respect of his colleagues  &MD; 
only to find what really matters  &MD;  human connection and the love of
a good woman. Writer-director Cameron Crowe dealt with the theme of
redemption through love more succinctly in his acclaimed film ``Say
Anything . . . '' and Cruise's gutsy performance has one too many
big, actor-ly moments. Still, there is plenty about the movie that
is moving and entertaining, chiefly Renee Zellweger's portrayal of
Cruise's loyal, loving assistant. Rated R for sex, language and
adult themes. 2 hours, 15 minutes.
<p>
   Jingle All the Way PG
<p>
   Sugar-coated crud. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a workaholic
dad whose last chance to redeem himself with his little boy
(adorable Jake Lloyd) is to get the kid the Holy Grail of Christmas
gifts  &MD;  a Turbo Man action figure. But since the stores have been
sold out since Labor Day, it becomes a Herculean effort. Alas,
``Jingle'' is pure junk  &MD;  a loud, crass miscalculation that
squanders its star's considerable charm and obliterates a promising
supporting cast (Sinbad, Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson). It makes the
star's previous misstep, ``The Last Action Hero,'' look like
``Schindler's List.'' Rated PG for mi ld violence. 1 hour, 30
minutes.
<p>
   Mars Attacks! PG-13
<p>
   Close encounters of the Tim Burton kind. In this spacey sci-fi
spoof, little green guys from the angry red planet attack an
all-star cast ranging from Jack Nicholson as the president of the
United States to Tom Jones as, well, Tom Jones. You'll never look
at ``Independence Day'' in quite the same way. Rated PG-13 for
violence. 1 hour, 43 minutes.
<p>
   Marvin's Room PG-13
<p>
   Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton make sisterhood powerful in this
adaptation of Scott McPherson's humorous and poignant play about
terminal disease and dysfunctional families. Director Jerry Zaks
brings a too-heavy hand to the proceedings, but the powerhouse cast
(add Robert De Niro, Gwen Verdon, Leonardo DiCaprio) takes over.
Streep and Keaton are especially fine; their scenes together are a
study in contrasting yet complementary acting styles. Rated PG-13
for language and adult themes. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
<p>
   Michael PG
<p>
   An uneven winged victory. In Nora Ephron's appealing fantasy
romance, John Travolta plays an unusual angel who changes the lives
of two journalists (William Hurt and Andie MacDowell). It's a
wildly uneven film and gooey as all get-out. But it's good goo, the
kind that puts you in a goodwill-toward- everyone mood. 1 hour, 45
minutes.
<p>
   Mother PG-13
<p>
   Talk of an Oscar nomination may fuel a comeback for Debbie
Reynolds, who plays a quietly controlling mom in this latest comedy
from the usually hilarious Albert Brooks (``Lost in America,''
``Defending Your Life'').
<p>
   My Fellow Americans PG-13
<p>
   The obvious blueprint for this adorable comedy is ``Grumpy Old
Men,'' the 1993 hit that gave new life to the careers of Jack
Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Here, Lemmon's foil is James Garner  &MD; 
the pair play former U.S. presidents who must put aside their
longstanding rivalry when one is implicated in a scandal. The movie
has some mawkish moments and corny dialogue, but the political
jokes have real bite and Lemmon and Garner make a great, grumpy
team. Rated PG-13 for language and mild violence. 1 hour, 42
minutes.
<p>
   One Fine Day PG-13
<p>
   During this very long and complicated day, so much happens that
you begin to hate little Maggie (Mae Whitman) and Sammy (Alex D.
Linz) for not making their class field trip. But then single mom
Mel (Michelle Pfeiffer) and dad Jack (George Clooney) wouldn't have
been pitted together so they could trade off the kids, accidentally
swap cell phones and otherwise wreak havoc on all of Manhattan.
Still, not even the considerable good looks of the actors or the
use of every screwball gag imaginable can make this ``Pillow Talk''
update anything more than the predictable piece of work that it is.
Rated PG-13 for mild profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes.
<p>
   101 Dalmatians G
<p>
   Somebody call PETA. This live-action remake of the 1961 Disney
animated feature is a frenetic mess. Glenn Close stars as Cruella
De Vil, a fur-mad fashion plate who wants to turn Dalmatian pups
into a coat. The doggies are adorable, but you've probably seen
Alpo commercials that are more entertaining. 1 hour, 43 minutes.
<p>
   The People vs. Larry Flynt R
<p>
   Milos Forman's riveting sideshow/biopic reminds us that the
First Amendment may well be the single most important thing that
makes our country great  &MD;  and that the right to self-expression
belongs to everybody, not just the polite. Larry Flynt is not
polite. Larry (Woody Harrelson) combines a bottom-line business
sense with a nose for the lowest common denominator. Thus is
Hustler magazine born, a publication that doesn't pretend to be
something people pick up for the articles. This is an audacious
film that's as smart as it is funny, equal parts political satire,
Rabelaisian romp and love story. 2 hours, 10 minutes. 
<p>
   The Preacher's Wife PG
<p>
   Makes a joyful noise. In this update of the 1947 movie ``The
Bishop's Wife,'' Denzel Washington plays an angel sent to Earth to
help a troubled couple (Whitney Houston and Courtney B. Vance).
Director Penny Marshall and her cast transform trite material into
a sweet-natured, PG-rated (parents, please note) crowd pleaser. 2
hours, 5 minutes.

<p>
   Ransom R
<p>
   In this slickly gripping thriller, Mel Gibson plays a self-made
millionaire who takes matters into his own hands when his son is
kidnapped. Rene Russo is his gorgeous, worried wife; Delroy Lindo
is the FBI agent on the case; and Gary Sinise and Lili Taylor are
the masterminds of the kidnapping plot. Though the movie is loosely
based on an old Glenn Ford film, director Ron Howard posits an
interesting subtext. In many ways what ``Ransom'' is really about
is the paranoia of the powerful  &MD;  how all the privilege and
connections in the world can't protect you when life goes awry. On
a pure action-movie level, though ``Ransom'' is often improbable,
it delivers the goods. But on another weirder level, it's a
subversive glimpse into the Nightmares of the Rich and Famous.
Rated R for violence, language and adult situations. 2 hours, 1
minute.
<p>
   The Relic R
<p>
   An exuberant study in B-movie cheesiness, this old-style
drive-in monster flick makes up in charm and verve what it lacks in
smarts. An unsightly reptile-mutant with an insatiable hankerin'
for human brains is terrorizing a Chicago museum. Tom Sizemore
(``Heat'') is terrific as a crusty police detective out to stop the
beast's skull-sucking spree. Rated R for extreme violence and
language. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
<p>
   Ridicule R
<p>
   Knowing, nasty and wonderful to watch. In 1783, a compassionate
but poor nobleman (Charles Berling) travels to Versailles to plead
with King Louis XVI for funds to drain his plague-ridden swamps. He
encounters a world where ``vices are without consequence but
ridicule can kill.'' A sardonic, elegant, scathingly adept film
from Patrice Leconte (``Monsieur Hire''). Rated R for sex, nudity
and adult themes. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
<p>
   Romeo and Juliet PG- 13 
<p>
   It's almost too bad about those nicely handled love scenes
between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes: They spoil ``Romeo and
Juliet's'' bid to be one of the most spectacularly awful movies of
all time. With its garish 1990s beachfront setting and its jerky,
dizzying, instant-headache camera work, Baz Luhrmann's ``Miami
Vice''``Romeo'' grovels so hard for a Generation X audience that
it's sure to turn off Shakespeare devotees. Rated PG-13 for
violence and adult themes. 2 hours.
<p>
   Star Wars PG
<p>
   ``A long time ago . . . '' or 20 years, to be exact, the world
first fell in love with George Lucas' space cowboy saga. Relive the
adventures of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo on the big
screen in this anniversary re-release. The second and third
installments of the ``Star Wars'' trilogy  &MD;  ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi''  &MD;  will follow in February.
<p>
   Some Mother's Son R
<p>
   The consistently brilliant Helen Mirren of ``Prime Suspect''
fame stars as Kathleen Quigley, an Irish teacher whose son is
jailed for IRA terrorism. Directed by Terry George, who co-wrote
the 1993 Daniel Day-Lewis drama, ``In the Name of the Father.''
<p>
   Scream R
<p>
   Horror maven Wes Craven (``Nightmare on Elm Street'') camps it
up in this self-aware sendup of scary movies. Someone is stalking
and killing a group of jaded teens who live for horror flicks
(played by a who's who of Hollywood's young elite, including Drew
Barrymore and Neve Campbell). ``Scream'' suffers from too many
inside jokes and not enough scares, but it does serve up a few
frightfully funny characters (Courteney Cox is right-on as a
tabloid-TV journalist). Rated R for violence, language and sex. 1
hour, 50 minutes.
<p>
   Secrets &AMP; Lies R
<p>
   A prize winner at Cannes, Mike Leigh's tender human comedy is a
sometimes hilarious, sometimes excruciating look at family. The
narrative meanders through the lives of a half-dozen characters
living in London, but the central pair are Hortense (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste), a bright professional woman in her 20s, and Cynthia
(Brenda Blethyn), a messed-up working-class woman in her 40s. When
Hortense, who was adopted, seeks out her birth mother, she turns
out to be Cynthia. One more thing: Hortense is black and Cynthia is
white. But race isn't the central issue here; Leigh is after more
fundamental bonds, the ones that ask if blood is thicker than
tears. At almost 2 hours, the loose-ends plot can be tiring, but
the acting is wonderful and the movie's insistent, subtly humorous
humanism seeps into your bones.
<p>
   Set It Off R
<p>
   While inner-city living's effect on young black women is a story
told too little on the big screen, ``Set It Off'' is as
unforgettable as it is necessary. The second film from video-movie
director F. Gary Gray (``Friday'') finds its engaging co-stars Jada
Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica Fox and Kimberly Elise beaten down
by ``the system,'' and they are ready to start swinging back. But
their Los Angeles bank heists are only part of a whole and riveting
story about the ends some desperate people will go to in the name
of friendship and the actions even the moral-minded will take for
the sake of survival.

 &UR; COMMENTARY: CELLULAR GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE &QL; 
 &UR; By ROWLAND NETHAWAY &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Readers ripped me for a recent column prompted by the
controversy stirred up after a Florida couple taped a cellular
telephone conversation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and several
top Republicans.
<p>
   Calls from Nebraska, letters from California and e-mail from
everywhere condemned me for the column. I was wished ill in a
variety of ways ranging from creative to crude. That's fine, but it
has little to do with the point I was trying to make.
<p>
   In case you've forgotten, the issue involved the demand by
congressional Republicans to prosecute everyone involved in
reporting a GOP strategy session overheard on a police scanner.
<p>
   Listening to their police scanner while driving to the mall, a
Florida couple overheard Gingrich and his colleagues discuss how to
put the best face on Gingrich's ethics problems.
<p>
   The Florida couple said they taped the conversation because they
wanted to give their grandchildren a piece of history, as though
grandchildren everywhere can't wait to exchange their Tickle Me
Elmo dolls for tapes of GOP strategy sessions.
<p>
   The grandparents, a school maintenance worker and a teacher's
aide, are active Democrats. Copies of the tape ended up in the
hands of congressional Democrats and soon thereafter in print.
<p>
   Democrats wanted to use the tape to show Gingrich did something
wrong. The Republicans wanted to use the tape to prosecute all the
Democrats responsible for making the tape public.
<p>
   I wanted to add a personal perspective to the issue. Overlooked,
I thought, was the fact that cellular phone conversations have
always been broadcast clear and unscrambled on radio frequencies
that can be picked up legally and listened to legally on legal
receivers, such as police scanners.
<p>
   I've known for years that a favorite pastime for many people,
especially rural citizens, is listening to police scanners. When
cellular phones came along, people discovered that many police
scanners pick up these broadcasts. The Florida couple say they have
listened to police scanners as a hobby for 20 years, which is not
unusual.
<p>
   Over the years, police officials have occasionally attempted to
get laws passed to make it illegal for citizens to listen to police
scanners. These efforts become problematic in a free society. They
raise the specter of repressive regimes that attempt to control
what their citizens hear or view on the airwaves, read in print or
say in public. Citizens in some countries must be registered and
licensed before they can own radio or television receivers.
<p>
   Rather than invest in better technology to solve its privacy
problem, in 1993 the cellular industry successfully lobbied
Congress to pass a law that makes it illegal to manufacture
scanners that can pick up the clear broadcasts of cell phones. That
left millions of legal scanners still out there, plus a confusing
legal mess.
<p>
   Two years ago I bought a scanner for a car trip. I wanted the
emergency road reports and the NOAA weather radio broadcasts. To my
surprise, I discovered it also received cell phone transmissions. I
also discovered that listening to cell phone broadcasts is a
widespread hobby in the western states.
<p>
   The answer to cell phone privacy, I wrote, should come from
better technology, such as digital cell phones, rather than more
criminal laws. When it comes to analog cell phone transmissions,
the genie is out of the bottle.
<p>
   In conclusion, I warned that people should not say anything over
a cellular phone that they don't want others to know.
<p>
   The angry reaction to my column makes me believe that lots of
Americans have been misled about the privacy of their cellular
phone conversations. Congress should have required the cellular
industry to fully reveal this fact to its customers.
<p>
   I now know that to say the emperor has no clothes on can upset
everyone, not just the emperor.

 &UR; BOOKS COMMENTARY: FRANKLY, SCARLETT, `TARA' SHINES WITH FILM'S SET
DESIGNS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By SCOTT EYMAN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Personally, I've grown weary of reading about ``Gone With the
Wind'' in either its literary or film forms.
<p>
   At any rate, for those who feel they can't get enough of what
Variety recently concluded is still by far the most successful
movie ever made (adjusting for inflation, ``GWTW'' has grossed $1.2
billion, compared to $698 million for ``ET''), there is ``On the
Road to Tara'' (Abrams, $39.95).
<p>
   The text doesn't offer much beyond what has already been printed
in previous books by Ron Haver, Gavin Lambert, and two or three
other writers, but what the large format volume does offer is
voluminous amounts of set and costume designs drawn from the
Selznick archives at the University of Texas. Since the film was
designed by the great William Cameron Menzies, and costumed by
Walter Plunkett, the artwork is often beautiful in and of itself.
<p>
   Menzies was the great, largely unsung architect of ``GWTW,''
indeed, of a good deal of classic Hollywood. He designed the look
of ``GWTW,'' and then storyboarded most of the sequences on a shot
by shot basis, which is why the film has such a unified style, in
spite of the fact that a half-dozen directors were sticking their
oars in at one time or another.
<p>
   If you're a completist, a reasonable addition to the library.
<p>
   Get 'em while they're hot ... If you want to sell books, you
really have to get on Oprah. Back in October, Winfrey's mention of
``Deep End of the Ocean'' helped move the literary novel to No. 1
on the fiction list. A little while later, Winfrey mentioned that
the next book her Reading Group would tackle would be Toni
Morrison's ``Song of Solomon.''
<p>
   ``Song of Solomon'' was published in 1977; in 1995, total sales
for the book amounted to 3,300 copies; 1996 sales were on the same
level. After Oprah's announcement, Plume promptly printed 500,000
new copies, and before you could say ``royalty check'' the book was
No. 1 on the paperback bestseller list.
<p>
   Aside from the fact that Winfrey, or her producers, have pretty
good taste, this illustrates how hidebound is the book industry's
own promotional apparatus, and how open people are to literary
experience.
<p>
   Good news and bad news ... Scribner's will publish the new Don
DeLillo novel, ``Underworld.'' The book, about the Cold War, will
be published in October. Although DeLillo's last book, ``Mao II,''
sold about 40,000 copies, not bad for a literary novel, but nothing
special commercially, Scribner's is said to have paid nearly $1
million for ``Underworld.'' Either it's very hungry for prestige,
or ``Underworld'' has elements that will appeal to a larger
audience than DeLillo's usual fans.

 &UR; PASS JUDGMENT ON JONBENET'S PARENTS? NOT YET &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By EMILY J. MINOR &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   On a cool winter evening some weeks ago, my 5-year-old son took
the stage. It was quite by accident, this performance at a local
arts center. The man on stage asked for children from the audience,
my kid's arm shot up and, voila, there he was, standing before a
couple thousand people.
<p>
   The small boy who still makes Mom order his cookie at the bakery
counter stood tall and talked loud and clear. He hammed it up. The
crowd laughed, then applauded. ``You stole the show,'' a nice lady
told us on the way out. I beamed.
<p>
   ``That was fun,'' said the 5-year-old.
<p>
   This, of course, has nothing to do with that tiny girl found
strangled in Boulder, Colo. Yet it has everything to do with her.
Because, quite suddenly, we have all decided that parents who put
their children in beauty pageants are selfish and irresponsible
people. Suddenly we've decided these mothers with cherry-red lips
and teased hair are a class below us.
<p>
   Suddenly, we've decided we're better than them because our kids
play with Barbie dolls and their kids dress like one.
<p>
   Yet, on that winter evening not so long ago, I was proud when my
kid stood on that stage and made a crowd of strangers smile.
<p>
   This little matter of looking at people and deciding right off
the bat that they're bad - and we're good - is the very thing we
hope our children will never do. We judge. All of us. The pretty
lady driving the Lexus and wearing a tennis outfit. I hate her. The
blue-collar guy who yells at his kid at Kmart. He makes me sick.
<p>
   But what do I know of these people? Nothing. I wouldn't pierce
my daughter's ears, carry a cell phone to the mall or let a nanny
raise my child. Yet lots of loving parents choose to do those very
things.
<p>
   It's difficult, I know, to relate to the mother with
Clairol-colored hair who sits before Katie Couric and explains,
quite politely, that there's nothing wrong with her daughter
competing in pageants. We poke fun, point out her fake nails,
polyester dress and hick accent. But shouldn't we give her a
chance? After all, it is possible that her little girl loves the
competition. And there's already money in the bank for the child's
college. I must say - perfect little me - I don't have all that
arranged quite yet.
<p>
   Despite what you and I think, JonBenet Ramsey's parents were not
bad parents simply because they let their daughter take the stage.
Thankfully, it takes more than that to ruin a child. They pushed
her, and we all wonder if they didn't push her a little too much.
The little girl had dyed hair and wore backless gowns. She knew how
to coyly shrug her shoulder and swing her behind.
<p>
   But, when the competition was finished, it's said that JonBenet
put on her jeans, tied her shoes and headed out to get dirty in a
mud puddle. And that seems pretty darn normal.
<p>
   If the Ramseys had anything to do with their little girl's
murder, they are, needless to say, very, very sick human beings.
<p>
   That won't be decided by pretty outfits and pageant judges,
though. And until we know more - more than just Mrs. Ramsey was a
former beauty queen and Mr. Ramsey is a wealthy businessman - it
certainly shouldn't be decided by the judgmental likes of you and
me.
<p>
   After all, have you read anything about Paula Jones lately?
Turns out there's more to her than big hair and gaudy makeup. Turns
out she could be telling the truth.

 &UR; BOOKS: LE GALLIENNE ACTED ROYALLY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By EYMAN SCOTT &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   EVA LE GALLIENNE, by Helen Sheehy. Knopf; 529 pages; $37.50.
<p>
   She was alone on stage. She was standing up, then, suddenly, she
stopped, swayed a tiny bit, then catapulted backward into a rocking
chair, as if her spine had been ripped from her body. The rocking
chair moved gently back and forth, her hand drifting across the
floor.
<p>
   It was the greatest death scene I've ever seen. The year was
1977, the play was ``The Royal Family,'' a middling George S.
Kaufman satire of the Barrymores, and the actress was Eva Le
Gallienne, playing the family matriarch.
<p>
   On the technical level, it would have been an impressive moment
for a young actor; for a woman pushing 80, it was astonishing. I
saw the play five times in a week, and she was never less than
dead-on in creating a moment of total loss that could only be
communicated by total control.
<p>
   In the early and middle years of this century, there were, by
common consent, three great actresses on the American stage: Helen
Hayes, Katherine Cornell, and Eva Le Gallienne. Of them, Le
Gallienne was the most serious artist. Her favorite writer was
Kierkegaard, she created the role of Julie in Molnar's ``Liliom,''
she excelled in Ibsen and Chekhov, she was playing Hecuba in ``The
Trojan Women'' in the mid-'60s.
<p>
   Le Gallienne was short, slight, not particularly beautiful, but
she had unbreakable will, charm, a warm cello voice, and that inner
light without which an actor is doomed to character parts. Her role
models were Bernhardt and, later, the supreme Duse. She despised
Hayes as a sell-out and seems to have given Cornell no serious
consideration whatever.
<p>
   Her absolute integrity is why Le Gallienne isn't better known
today. She was completely without that touch of whorish showbiz
neediness that can be counted upon to elicit an audience's empathy.
<p>
   ``Le Gallienne composed a part,'' writes Helen Sheehy in this,
the first comprehensive biography of the actress, ``thinking of her
role as a continuous piece of music, orchestrating the silence of
thoughts, so that each moment, each word, each gesture flowed
inevitably and spontaneously forward.''
<p>
   In addition to acting, Le Gallienne often directed and produced
as well; her greatest triumph was the six-year run of the Civic
Repertory Company, a brave attempt to create in America what other
countries have always taken for granted - a national repertory
theater, presenting the finest plays at the lowest possible prices.
<p>
   The tickets for the Civic Rep started at 35 cents and topped out
at $1.50, this at a time when Broadway tickets usually ran $1.50 to
$5. Because of the price structure, the Civic was of necessity
formulated around the European model of subsidies.
<p>
   For a time, the Civic thrived, but the Depression put paid to
the dream, and a later, post-war attempt to revive the concept fell
victim to increasingly impossible economics.
<p>
   One closes this valuable but occasionally frustrating book
wondering at Le Gallienne's refusal to go to Europe and match her
gifts against the people who do serious theater really well.
<p>
   Perhaps she was too austere and single-minded to really work
effectively with other people for very long. An actor/manager in
the tradition of Henry Irving or Olivier, she had to be left alone
to work her magic, but her uncommercial taste in material and
luxurious, thoroughly commercial taste in physical production
doomed her to the margins.
<p>
   Yet, she was right about a great deal. Her insistence on an
alternative to Broadway has borne fruit, not in a geniune national
repertory company, but in the regional theater movement.
<p>
   In addition, she had a wonderful eye for talent. Burgess
Meredith, May Sarton, John Garfield, Howard da Silva, Norman Lloyd
and Robert Lewis were all trained at the Civic, and their idealism
was further illuminated by the shining light of her integrity. They
all adored her and had lengthy careers marked by the Civic's
tradition of self-effacement, of serving the writer, of an actor
disappearing into a part.
<p>
   Personally, Le Gallienne was a lesbian - a big one, as Diane
Keaton's daughter proclaims in ``The First Wives Club.'' Most of
her lovers were subsidiary talents, although she did live for a
while with Mercedes de Acosta, the lesbian Errol Flynn.
<p>
   The only man she took as a lover was, of all people, Basil
Rathbone, in his young leading man period in the '20s, and they
were serious enough for her to contemplate marriage and children.
<p>
   Her powerful creative force was easily transmuted into erotic
energy; during the production of ``The Royal Family,'' she seduced
George S. Kaufman's daughter, a married woman 25 years her junior.
Whoever shared her life had to deal with her tendency toward the
imperious and arrogant; Le Gallienne had a tendency to reduce
lovers and coworkers alike to the status of helpmates at best,
servants at worst.
<p>
   Helen Sheehy quotes people who attest to Le Gallienne's
delightful humor, but if they're right Sheehy has flattened out her
subject. Le Gallienne comes across as petulant and almost comically
self-absorbed. The fault may be Sheehy's. Le Gallienne seems to
have been a gardener of genius - her estate in Connecticut sounds
comparable to Monet's - and very few gardeners lack (you should
pardon the expression) earthy humor.
<p>
   The primary problem of Eva Le Gallienne is that Sheehy tells the
story almost completely through Le Gallienne's eyes, relying too
much on her own words, as set down in her diaries and two volumes
of autobiography.
<p>
   If the book lacks objectivity, it also lacks flair. Sheehy's
stolidity makes it difficult for her to give a sense of Le
Gallienne's flair, her incandescence on stage.
<p>
   Since any theatrical talent is writing on water, it is left to
the chroniclers to preserve their art for posterity, and this is
something Sheehy has done only spasmodically.

 &UR; JUNK MAIL COULD WIPE OUT STAINED IMAGE &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES SEABROOK &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  The Post Office has its own junk mail headache  &MD;  tons
of undeliverable newsletters, political fliers and department store
advertisers. Postal officials said Tuesday they're going to do
something about it.
<p>
   The Postal Service, they said, has awarded a five-year contract
to Southeast Paper Recycling of Atlanta to collect and recycle
undeliverable junk mail from nearly 200 post offices and two mail
processing plants in North Georgia, including metro Atlanta.
<p>
   Together, the postal facilities are expected to produce about
500 tons of paper for recycling per month, said Carol Larson,
spokeswoman for the Postal Service Atlanta District.
<p>
   Recycling, she said, will divert the wastepaper from landfills
and turn it into new products, such as newsprint and paper towels
and napkins. It will also save more than 100,000 trees and generate
more than $150,000 per year in revenue for the Postal Service, she
noted.
<p>
   ``The bulk of the paper that will be recycled is undeliverable
advertising mail,'' she said. That's what most homeowners call junk
mail, although Larson said the Post Office doesn't like to use that
term.
<p>
   Unlike First-Class Mail, this type of mail is rarely forwarded
when people change addresses. It ends up back at the post office,
marked undeliverable.
<p>
   Postal officials say a lot of the problems with junk mail  &MD; 
assuming people want it in the first place  &MD;  could be avoided if
residents left a correct or up-to-date forwarding address when
moving.
<p>
   The Postal Service delivered 183 billion pieces of mail
nationwide in 1996. Of that, about 39 percent, or 71 billion
pieces, was advertising mail.
<p>
   Nationwide, the Postal Service in 1996 recycled one million tons
of wastepaper, cardboard, plastics, cans and other material. The
recycling generated about $6.6 million in revenue for the agency
and earned kudos from the White House.

<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  The bomb that blasted through a window of a Sandy
Springs abortion clinic was meant to level the three-story,
concrete office building, authorities said Tuesday.
<p>
   The second bomb, which exploded 67 minutes later Thursday, was
different. It was packed with shrapnel and aimed at people.
<p>
   ``The magnitude of the (first) explosion was designed to bring
that building down,'' Fulton County Police Chief Louis Graham said
Tuesday. ``And the magnitude of the second thing was designed to
kill. These were not M- 80s.''
<p>
   A federal, state and local task force of about 100 law
enforcement officers, including FBI and ATF agents from across the
country, were ``very optimistic'' and ``following good leads,''
Graham said. More than 400 tips have been called in to the hotline
 &MD;  888-ATF-BOMB, FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore said Tuesday.
<p>
   Federal authorities Tuesday also said they were investigating
four pipe bombs found in a vacant office building in suburban
Lithonia.
<p>
   The devices  &MD;  four metal pipes with shotgun shells taped to them
and wires sticking out of them  &MD;  were discovered in a metal box
Saturday by a man cleaning out the small office on Old Covington
Road, police said. Owners of the building, which has been rented to
a taxi company, contacted police Monday.
<p>
   ATF spokesman Bobby Browning said other bomb components were
found in the building. Browning would not say if the explosives
were similar to those used in Sandy Springs.
<p>
   ``My first thought was that it was a practical joke,'' said
Henry Sosa, who owns a nearby towing business and runs the
building. ``But these things looked like they were ready to go.''
<p>
   In Sandy Springs, investigators Tuesday finished scouring the
area around the office building for clues and released the
Carpenter Drive property to its owner.
<p>
   ``We are going to stay there until the owner makes arrangements
for security on the property,'' Graham said. ``We don't want to
just walk away and leave those people.''
<p>
   The first blast at 9:30 a.m. Thursday did extensive damage,
knocking out ceiling tiles on all floors and leaving dangling
electrical wires. It left a 41/2- to 6-inch-deep crater in an area
that was on top of reinforced concrete, said Fulton County police
Capt. Terry Mulkey.
<p>
   The second explosion at 10:37 a.m. blew a 5-
foot-by-6-foot-by-41/2-foot hole next to a dumpster on the
northwest side. Law enforcement officials told reporters Tuesday
that it contained 3-inch concrete nails.
<p>
   Officials said it's still too early to rule out any connection
to the July 27 pipe bomb that killed one and injured 111 during
Olympic festivities. That bomb also contained nails.
<p>
   ``We're proceeding with an open mind,'' Graham said.
<p>
   Investigators were also trying to determine the real target of
the bombs. The clinic was not open for abortions on Thursday.
<p>
   ``We feel it probably was the abortion clinic, but again we
can't say that absolutely,'' Graham said. ``What other reason would
a second bomb have been planted at the building except to kill
somebody  &MD;  public safety, news reporters or innocent bystanders?''

 &UR; TOP TEXAS LOTTERY MANAGER'S RECORDS SUBPOENAED &QL;

<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  Federal prosecutors who allege Texas consultants
for GTECH paid kickbacks to a company official are reviewing
records concerning GTECH's top Texas employee.
<p>
   In a subpoena sent to Kentucky officials, prosecutors in New
Jersey asked for employment records of James Hosker, who was hired
away from his post as head of the Kentucky Lottery to run GTECH's
Texas operations from Austin.
<p>
   Hosker, who took the Kentucky Lottery job in November 1990, left
in June 1992 to join GTECH, which operates the Texas Lottery.
<p>
   The subpoena was issued last month by federal prosecutors in New
Jersey, ordering Kentucky lottery officials to submit all of
Hosker's employment records ``including but not limited to
personnel records, recommendations, job performance reviews and
exit records.''
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Hosker referred all questions Tuesday to the
company's Rhode Island headquarters. Company spokesman Bob Rendine
said speculation would be improper on why federal prosecutors in
New Jersey are interested in Hosker's Kentucky employment records.
<p>
   ``For anybody to make any kind of assumption is not only
inappropriate, but flat-out outrageous,'' Rendine said.
<p>
   A state audit report in Kentucky critical of changes Hosker made
to GTECH's contract there  &MD;  before he joined GTECH in Texas  &MD;  had
been referred to the Kentucky attorney general. The attorney
general declined criminal prosecution.
<p>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Guadagno of Newark has declined
to discuss the subpoena or confirm that a GTECH-related
investigation is continuing. In October, jurors in Newark convicted
J. David Smith, GTECH's former national sales manager, and one of
the company's New Jersey consultant on charges that Smith took
kickbacks.
<p>
   A presentencing report issued last week said Smith also took
kickbacks  &MD;  topping $500,000  &MD;  from former Texas Lt. Gov. Ben
Barnes, GTECH's top Texas consultant. Barnes, who says he hired
Smith to do consulting, has denied the allegations.
<p>
   In April 1994, after Hosker was in Austin, Kentucky State
Auditor Ben Chandler issued a report claiming Kentucky had given
GTECH too good of a deal. The report pointed a finger at Hosker and
Brian Potter, who also had served as president of the Kentucky
Lottery.
<p>
   At the time, Illinois accountant John Filan, who helped review
the Kentucky Lottery, said problems with the contract began with
changes Hosker and Potter made. All changes were ratified by the
lottery board. All members of that panel resigned after the audit
report.
<p>
   Chandler's report said Kentucky paid GTECH $2.7 million more per
year than other states paid for similar services. The original 1989
contract was amended in 1991 and 1992. The second change came four
months before Hosker's departure for GTECH and Texas.
<p>
   Rendine on Tuesday characterized the Kentucky audit as ``amateur
hour.''
<p>
   ``When they tried to compare prices paid in large states with
prices paid in small states, we knew it was not a very good
analysis,'' he said. Changes that added to the state's cost were
changes that also provided additional services and products,
Rendine said.
<p>
   The audit report was forwarded to the Kentucky attorney general,
who said no criminal charges were warranted.
<p>
   Just as Rendine cautioned against jumping to conclusions about
what prosecutors want to see from the Kentucky employment records,
he warned against drawing implications about Hosker's move from
negotiating with GTECH to working for it. He said any overlap of
payments from the two sides was an innocent, inevitable outcome.
<p>
   ``When you leave a place of employment ... and go to work
somewhere else inevitably you will find you are owned comp or
vacation time and you will receive a check weeks later at your
other place of employment,'' Rendine said. ``That's precisely what
happened in Mr. Hosker's case.''
<p>
   He added that Hosker notified Kentucky officials, in a public
meeting, that he planned to talk to GTECH about a job.
<p>
   GTECH has operated the Kentucky Lottery's on-line games since
they began in 1989. But last year Automated Wagering Inc. underbid
GTECH by $25 million and was awarded a five-year contract to
provide a computer system and operate the on-line lotto games. The
two firms submitted the only bids.
<p>
   The Automated Wagering deal went sour last year when the company
could not guarantee it could install and operate the new system.
The company was in the midst of potential ownership restructuring.
<p>
   In September, the Kentucky Lottery Board gave up on Automated
Wagering and instructed lottery officials to negotiate an extension
of the GTECH contract, now scheduled to expire in October 1997.
<p>
   Hosker honed his political skills within the Democratic Party in
Massachusetts. He became lottery director after a long stint in the
state treasurer's office, the agency that oversees the
Massachusetts Lottery.
<p>
   In November 1990, Hosker was hired for the Kentucky job by
then-Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, who a year later would become a key
player in the career of another GTECH official. In 1991, on his
last day in office, Wilkinson pardoned Smith, who had pleaded
guilty on a misdemeanor charge of possessing gambling devices.
<p>
   The charge, reduced from a felony, stemmed from the early 1980s
when Smith's Kentucky company placed video poker machines in bars.
<p>
   Wilkinson's lottery ties also included L. Rogers Wells, a former
top aide who was acquitted of kickback charges with Smith in
Kentucky.
<p>
   Wells served as Wilkinson's finance secretary.
<p>
   At the time, Wells was president of Interlott, an Ohio-based
firm that sells lottery ticket-vending machines to several states,
including Texas.
<p>
   The Wells-Smith trial ended in January 1995 when U.S. District
Judge John Heyburn II ordered Smith and Wells acquitted before the
case went to the jury.

 &UR; FLORIDA OFFICIALS ASK FOR FEDERAL FREEZE AID &QL;

<p>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla.  &MD;  An unexpected freeze ravaged fruit and
vegetable plants in pockets of South Florida this weekend and
caused at least $100 million in crop damage. State officials on
Tuesday decided to seek federal disaster relief.
<p>
   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford said the Saturday
night freeze was the most damaging since 1989 and came without
warning. The cold sent temperatures below freezing along a trough
from Clewiston through the southwest corridor and into Homestead in
Dade County. Clewiston reported a low of 19 degrees.
<p>
   The icy weather lingered for up to 8 hours  &MD;  killing tomatoes,
zucchini, cucumbers and bell pepper plants, turning the juice of
young oranges to slush and withering young sugar cane plants.
<p>
   Consumers will feel the impact immediately, Crawford said.
<p>
   ``Expect prices to skyrocket,'' he said. Mexico, which supplies
half of the nation's winter vegetable crop, also was hit by the
freeze.
<p>
   The cold snap caught weather forecasters and farmers by
surprise.
<p>
   Crawford blamed the lack of warning on the absence of the
National Weather Service agriculture forecasts this year. The
federal government ended its agriculture forecasts last spring to
save $3.3 million and left the job for private forecasters.
<p>
   Crawford also blamed the private forecasters. They miscalculated
the cold snap, failing to predict that temperatures in the southern
half of the state would drop lower than the cloud-covered regions
farther north.
<p>
   ``There's pretty much unanimous agreement by anyone using a
weather service that they missed this one pretty badly,'' said
Dallas Townsend, Hendry County extension director.
<p>
   The cold temperatures inflicted the heaviest damage on vegetable
crops in Southwest Florida and in Homestead, where farmers produce
the other half of the nation's winter vegetable crop. They lost
between 50 percent and 75 percent of their harvest, Crawford said.
<p>
   In Collier and Hendry counties, where farmers grow tomatoes,
green peppers and cucumbers, the outlook was also grim.
<p>
   ``The vegetable industry really got clobbered,'' said Townsend.
He spent the last three days assessing the damage and concluded:
``It's going to be devastating losses industry-wide in this area.''
<p>
   In western Palm Beach County, farmers fared better. The cold
damaged sweet corn, radishes and leafy greens, but losses were
considered light to moderate.
<p>
   ``Palm Beach County seems to have done better than most areas,''
said Gary Smiegel of Lantana-based Mecca Farms. ``We may have lost
10 percent of our crop, but some farmers in Immokalee, Naples and
Homestead lost 100 percent.''
<p>
   Mecca Farms grows tomatoes, peppers and squash in Palm Beach and
Martin counties.
<p>
   Crawford called his $100 million damage estimate
``conservative'' and said the freeze was most damaging cold snap in
Florida since the 1989 freeze that inflicted $1 billion in damages
on Florida's fruit and vegetable industry.
<p>
   The crop damage forced growers to send crews into overtime
Sunday to salvage their losses and speed up their harvesting.
<p>
   The cold is not expected to affect the harvest of the state's
sugar cane crop. The cane was hit by frost, but that should not
affect raw sugar yields, said Bob Buker, senior vice president of
Clewiston-based U.S. Sugar Corp.
<p>
   The cold might have hurt young plant cane, however, which would
affect next year's crop. It will be two or three months before the
full impact of the cold on the young cane can be measured, Buker
said.
<p>
   In the Gulf citrus-growing area of Hendry, Collier and Lee
counties, growers expect the freeze damage will reduce their juice
yields, said Ron Hamel, executive vice president of the Gulf Citrus
Growers Association.
<p>
   The freeze was not all bad news for citrus growers, however.
Those who still have fruit to sell will now be able to get more
money. The expectation that the state's growers would this year
produce a record-sized crop had driven down prices.
<p>
   But on Monday, orange juice for March delivery rose 5.95 cents
to 85.85 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange. That was
the biggest one-day change since August. Prices for March delivery
rose again on Tuesday, closing at 86.65 cents a pound.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Crawford's office continues to collect damage
estimates. Gov. Lawton Chiles is expected to formally ask federal
authorities this week to declare the affected regions federal
disasters areas. Growers, who are not covered by crop insurance,
could then be eligible for low-interest loans.

 &UR; SPORTS COMMENTARY: COACHING CAROUSEL CAN BE A CRUEL RIDE &QL; 
 &UR; By KIRK BOHLS &QC;

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Bill Parcells used to be a chain smoker. He's
still a self- described compulsive eater. In fact, he said if he
didn't work out at 5:30 every morning, ``I'd be dead.''
<p>
   Mike Holmgren said his stomach's been bothering him the past two
months and he can't sleep.
<p>
   And these are the two NFL coaches who won.
<p>
   Just think of those 28 other poor schmucks whose seasons ended
short of the Super Bowl. For 10 of them, more than that ended. They
were canned, three of them after only two seasons on the job. How's
THEIR health these days? Health hell, how's that mortgage payment
coming?
<p>
   The tenure of those 10 pink-slipped head coaches averaged only
five years, thanks to bulletproof Wayne Fontes' nine seasons and
offense-less Jim Mora's 11{. Take them out of the equation, and the
other eight averaged just 3.7 years on the sideline.
<p>
   ``I hope it's an aberration,'' Green Bay's Holmgren said. ``In
two or three instances, I felt it shouldn't have happened. A couple
didn't get enough time.''
<p>
   Bobby Ross was pressured into resigning at San Diego, just two
years removed from a Super Bowl. George Seifert was shown the door
because he hadn't been to the big game since the 1994 season.
<p>
   Al Groh, New England's excellent but well-traveled defensive
coordinator, has made seven college and four NFL stops.
<p>
   ``My wife and I designed our dream house in South Carolina and
we were in it four months,'' Groh said. ``We've built four houses,
and the first three we lived in 'em a year. When we moved to
Massachusetts, my son, Mike, said, `Dad, if you want to stay, don't
build a house.'''
<p>
   If they build it, they still will come and go. That's why nearly
a third of the NFL's head-coaching work force was left to fill out
questionnaires from some idiot named Tom Benson. Nice gig if you
can get it, huh?
<p>
   It's a wonder anybody wants to. And it'll get worse before it
gets better. When a pair of 2-year-old expansion teams like
Carolina and Jacksonville reach the NFC and AFC championship games,
that sound you hear is the heads of head coaches being lopped off.
<p>
   Of the 20 survivors this season, three were first-year head
coaches, five were in their second year and three more in their
third. In this decade alone, the 29 NFL teams already will have had
75 head coaches by next fall. That counts Cleveland but not the
expansion teams, although the future of Carolina's Tom Coughlin was
in doubt at midseason. The college casualties were even higher this
fall.
<p>
   The profession is becoming more and more precarious, which
explains why more and more coaches, a la Parcells and new Falcons
hire Dan Reeves, are seeking more and more control of their own
destiny. That's why they try to sit in the general manager's chair
or sit on their GM and make most of the personnel decisions in the
draft and free agency.
<p>
   You can't blame them, but you can't necessarily fault management
because coaches can up and leave as easily as they are fired. If it
were left up to Parcells, New England would have drafted a
defensive player in the first round, not wideout Terry Glenn, and
might not be here now.
<p>
   The coaching carousel is a vicious cycle but no longer a
recycle. Of the 27 current head coaches in place, only four of
their predecessors have top jobs in the league: Reeves (Atlanta),
Lindy Infante (Indianapolis), Jimmy Johnson (Miami) and Ross
(Detroit).
<p>
   ``Management of an NFL franchise is different than it's ever
been with the salary cap and a fixed budget,'' said Patriots owner
Robert Kraft, who refuses to give Parcells total autonomy and will
probably lose him to the Jets. ``The skills to manage a football
team and do it well are not the same it takes to manage an office.
Unless you're a great financial person, I'm not sure you can do
that job well.''
<p>
   Holmgren almost quit to become a high school teacher after two
years as a high school assistant on a team that lost every game. He
considered his father's career in real estate. Parcells picked
coaching over law school out of Wichita State.
<p>
   ``Any time 33 percent of your industry is changing, it is
surprising,'' Parcells said. ``The game has changed. There's a lot
of volatility. Players change (more quickly), owners change. I
don't think it's for the better.
<p>
   ``But I like the game, and I don't care what goes with it. I was
probably a 9 for putting pressure on myself. Now I'm at
mid-range.''
<p>
   Holmgren said we've seen the last of the Don Shulas and Tom
Landrys and Chuck Nolls and Dick Ver ... how's that? You said Dick
Vermeil wants back in the rat race after sitting on the sidelines
for 15 years? Neither Parcells nor Holmgren suggested Vermeil
should get a group rate on Dennis Rodman's NBA psychologist, but if
the couch fits.
<p>
   Vermeil, who accepted the St. Louis Rams coaching job Tuesday,
was in Holmgren's office three years ago when Vermeil was
contemplating a return to the Philadelphia Eagles position he
abruptly vacated in 1981.
<p>
   ``I told him things have really changed,'' Holmgren said. ``What
do you think made you get out the last time? You're a perfectionist
in an imperfect game.''
<p>
   But at the current rate of exchange for coaches, not for very
long.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Penthouse magazine won a court
order allowing it to sell sexually explicit magazines and videos in
military-run stores on U.S. bases and ships worldwide.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York granted
Penthouse owner General Media Communications Inc. and several
publishing and entertainment trade groups a preliminary injunction
that lifts a recent ban on the sales.
<p>
   The judge found that the ban on ``indecent'' material in the
stores violates the First Amendment right of publishers and video
producers to distribute material that some people find offensive.
She also found the ban unconstitutionally vague.
<p>
   ``Sexually explicit material cannot be banned from sale or
rental at military exchanges merely because it is offensive,''
Scheindlin wrote in a ruling issued today.
<p>
   She rejected the U.S. Defense Department's argument that the ban
would erode the military's core values of honor, courage and
commitment.
<p>
   The preliminary injunction replaces a temporary restraining
order Scheindlin had imposed against the military on Dec. 20.

 &UR; REEVES TAKES OVER FALCONS &QL; 
 &UR; By LEN PASQUARELLI &QC;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  Charged officially with reversing the fortunes of one
of the league's worst franchises, Dan Reeves conceded during his
first day on the Atlanta Falcons payroll that the task might be a
daunting one.
<p>
   But Reeves took a giant step Tuesday toward assuring the city's
long-suffering fans he's game for the challenge.
<p>
   ``Probably the greatest motivator that I know of is fear,''
Reeves, 53, said after a Georgia Dome press conference. ``It's
driven me my entire life, and it will drive me now. The past four
years (with the New York Giants), I worked harder than in any of
the previous 12 seasons at Denver. I want to succeed, and I know
I'll work even harder here to try and make sure we do.''
<p>
   Reeves' record (149-113-1) in 16 years on the sidelines makes
him the 10th-winningest coach in NFL history. His resume is
highlighted by seven playoff appearances, five division titles and
three conference crowns.
<p>
   Reeves has participated as a player or coach in eight of the 30
Super Bowl games.
<p>
   ``For 16 years, I've thought about Dan and the possibilities of
him being here with us,'' Taylor Smith said. ``For various reasons,
timing and whatever else, it never worked until now. But now is the
time for him. The instant respect he brings our franchise around
the league is something special.''
<p>
   Unlike New York, where Reeves was hamstrung by the structural
constraints of the organization, Reeves will have no one to blame
but himself if he fails to deliver in Suwanee, the Falcons'
training camp.
<p>
   The titles of coach and executive vice president/football
operations afford him more ``authority''  &MD;  a word he said he
preferred over ``control''  &MD;  to undertake whatever moves are
necessary to make the team a playoff contender.
<p>
   Beyond his short-term goal of assembling a staff by the end of
the week, Reeves' aim is to create the kind of stability Atlanta
has lacked for three decades. With only a cursory knowledge of the
Falcons' roster, Reeves reiterated the need to surround himself
with strong assistants who share his mindset.
<p>
   ``The long-range plan,'' Reeves said, ``is for the Falcons to be
successful year in and year out.''
<p>
   Although he exhibited more excitement than emotion, the Rome,
Ga., native and former Americus resident left little doubt the
opportunity to return to his roots played a big role in accepting a
position he sought 20 years ago.
<p>
   ``This is home,'' said Reeves. ``It's not often you get the
opportunity to try to succeed at something in the place you want to
spend the rest of your life.''
<p>
   In 1977, as a Dallas assistant coach, Reeves pursued the
Falcons' vacancy subsequently filled by Leeman Bennett.
<p>
   Owner Rankin Smith and team president Taylor Smith allowed that
they weren't going to let Reeves escape this time. .

   Despite busy signals, slowdowns, e-mail outages and message
board miseries in the seven weeks since America Online unshackled
most of its users from hourly charges, the majority of the
service's 8 million subscribers are not suing, petitioning,
withholding monthly fees or canceling their subscriptions  &MD;  yet.
For the AOLoyal, there are a few ways to cope while the service
works to ease access.
<p>
   A feature called flash sessions allows subscribers to log onto
AOL automatically during off-peak hours to send and retrieve
e-mail. A button titled ``walk me through'' gives you step-by-step
instructions.
<p>
   Members who have accounts with an Internet service provider at
home or work can use them to get into AOL through a ``pipe'' that
is hundreds of times wider than a standard telephone connection.
<p>
   From the AOL welcome screen, choose the ``setup'' and ``create
location'' buttons to set up a new ``locality.'' A locality is a
script that AOL uses to connect you to their computers, and you can
create and save as many localities as you like with whatever names
you choose.
<p>
   By opting for TCP/IP instead of AOLnet in the ``network''
window, you'll bypass the phone lines altogether and hook up to AOL
through your Internet connection.
<p>
   You can also set up localities to dial, two per session, any of
AOL's local telephone numbers. Be aware that you'll lose
performance if you connect using a line rated for a modem slower
than the one in your computer.
<p>
   The three recommended Atlanta-area numbers listed in the AOL
Insider section are generally the least-used lines. But usage on
the other 11 lines varies with the time of day and other factors.

   Rolling Stone writer Fred Goodman says the online serialization
of his new rock history, ``Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young,
Geffen and the Head-On Collision of Rock and Commerce'' (Times
Books, $25) is more than just a magazine article on a computer
screen.
<p>
   But despite the addition of a few audio clips, the biggest
difference between the online production and a magazine article is
the absence of glossy paper and liquor ads.
<p>
   That's not a bad thing, though, especially if you're interested
in rock icons like Bob Dylan and the managers, agents and producers
behind their careers.
<p>
   The first weekly installment, online through Thursday, examines
how Dylan and manager Albert Grossman carved out an unprecedented
degree of independence from the dictates of record companies.

 &UR; BOY'S PLAYFUL TRAIN RIDE ENDS IN TRAGEDY ALONGSIDE TRACKS &QL;

   Searchers who found the body of 7-year-old Carlos Wilson on
Tuesday said the boy made a valiant effort to survive after being
trapped in the cold night air on the outside of a moving freight
train.
<p>
   ``He held on for at least an hour to a ladder on one of the
freight cars, three or four cars back from the engine'' said
Jenkins County, Ga., Sheriff Bobby Womack. ``Poor little thing must
have been terrified, with all the noise and the cold.''
<p>
   The child, dressed only in jeans, sneakers and a short-sleeved
shirt, clung limpet-like to a grain car's ladder through the South
Georgia countryside for 43 miles, from his hometown of Millen to
rural Effingham County, the sheriff said.
<p>
   Carlos was ``probably'' alive when he jumped or fell from the
freight car just east of the tiny town of Oliver, Womack said.
<p>
   He said the body was found Tuesday in low-growing weeds about 20
feet from the tracks by searchers using a dog.
<p>
   ``It looked like he tried to scratch a little nest in the broom
straw to keep warm,'' Womack said, commenting that overnight
temperatures Sunday and Monday dipped into the high 30s. ``He'd
taken his shoes off and his heels looked like he'd scratched down
into the dirt. I think he must have died of shock or exposure,
because he just had one little cut on his head.''
<p>
   The Norfolk Southern Railroad freight train left Millen around
4:30 p.m. Sunday on a non-stop run from the small town to Savannah,
some 75 miles away, according to company spokesman Rick Harris, who
said the train's top speed was under 45 mph.
<p>
   Sheriff Womack said the episode began when Wilson and three
older boys were climbing freight car ladders while the train was
stopped at a switching area in Millen.
<p>
   When the train pulled out, the other boys jumped off.
<p>
   ``They were yelling at Carlos to jump, but he was probably
scared,'' Womack said.
<p>
   One of the friends said Carlos yelled from the train, telling
them to meet him at the next railroad station.
<p>
   The search for the child was delayed until 7 p.m. Sunday when
Carlos' mother, Louise Evans, a single parent, questioned her son's
playmates and learned what had happened.
<p>
   Carlos' cousin, Dorothea Young, who lives across the street,
said he was a happy youngster in a family of four boys, two younger
and one older.
<p>
   ``Carlos loved to play with the other children,'' Young said.
``But I know his mother didn't know he was climbing on the
trains.''
<p>
   Womack said an autopsy will be performed. Railroad investigators
are looking into the incident, Harris said.

   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 7.7 percent after the
world's largest computer maker reported lower-than-expected
fourth-quarter sales and earnings.
<p>
   IBM shares fell 9 to 159 in midmorning trading of 6.32 million.
The stock accounted for 32 points of the 51.57-point drop in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Earlier, shares fell as low as 155,
after trading at ten-year highs in the past few weeks on investor
optimism about the earnings.
<p>
   ``The stock had run up in expectation that the numbers would be
higher,'' said Phil Sheeted, managing partner at Looms Sails &AMP; Co.,
which owns IBM stock.
<p>
   IBM yesterday said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
slightly less than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand
in Europe hurt results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Earnings were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their earnings estimates for 1997.
IBM's Chief Financial Officer Richard Thoman said yesterday
continued weakness in memory chip prices and uncertainty about
currency could further hamper results.
<p>
   ``They are going to have a hard time doing an encore,'' said
industry analyst Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research in Phoenix. On a
constant-currency basis, IBM said revenue rose 9 percent, its best
performance since 1985.
<p>
   IBM, like some other companies, was hurt by weak economies in
some European countries. Additionally, mainframe and workstation
sales were slow and falling memory-chip prices continued to hurt
results.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales
declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' John
Rutledge, an analyst at Loomis, Sayles. ``The bloom is off the
rose.''

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.
said fourth-quarter earnings rose 28 percent as rising income from
managing clients' money and from penalties charged to credit card
customers overcame credit card losses.
<p>
   The company, which owns broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
issues the Discover credit card, said net income rose to $227.8
million, or 68 cents a share, from $178.1 million, or 51 cents, a
year earlier.
<p>
   The results beat the average estimate of 65 cents a share of
eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research Inc. Dean
Witter rose 5/8 to 37 3/4 in midmorning trading.
<p>
   ``The earnings were very strong,'' said analyst Michael
Freudenstein, who follows financial companies for J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
``Each of their lines of business performed well.''
<p>
   Net income at Dean Witter Reynolds, the third-largest U.S.
securities firm in terms of brokers, rose 8.8 percent to $126
million from $115.8 million a year earlier. They advanced 5.9
percent from $119 million in the third quarter.
<p>
   Asset management and administration fees, which increased 16
percent to $299.3 million, led the securities unit's performance.
Investment banking revenue jumped 60 percent to $78.1 million amid
a rally in the stock and bond markets.
<p>
   ``We continued to achieve rapid growth in assets under
management,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Philip J. Purcell said
in a statement.
<p>
   Assets under management and administration rose 13 percent to
$90 billion from the year-ago period.
<p>
   Net operating revenue at the securities unit rose 11 percent to
$879 million.
<p>
   Discover card earnings rose 63 percent to $101.8 million from
$62.3 million in the year-earlier period. The rise came even as the
company increased its provisions for loan losses by 53 percent to
$636 million.
<p>
   ``Revenues from their credit card services were very high,''
said analyst Mark Alpert at Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons Inc. ``They priced a
lot of their accounts in terms of annual percentage rates and late
fees, which more than offset the rise in write-offs.''
<p>
   Merchant and cardmember fees, on a managed loan basis, rose 48
percent to a record $563.8 million from a year earlier, boosted by
higher transaction volume.
<p>
   The firm increased the penalties it charges for late payments
and spending over credit limits, a spokeswoman said.
<p>
   The loss, or net charge-off, rate for managed loans in credit
services rose to 6 percent from 4.4 percent in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   ``Our fourth-quarter results were exceptionally strong given the
industry-wide trend of higher credit card write-offs,'' said
Purcell.
<p>
   Discover net operating revenue rose 14 percent to $735.9
million.
<p>
   For the full year, Dean Witter Discover net income rose 11
percent to $951.4 million, or $2.79 a share, from $856.4 million,
or $2.44 in 1995.

   St. Louis, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Monsanto Co. said its Searle
pharmaceutical unit formed a $32 million joint venture with a
Russian research center to make medical products in a new plant
outside Moscow.
<p>
   Under an agreement between Skokie, Illinois-based Searle and the
Biopreparaty/Russian Research Center for Molecular Diagnostics and
Therapy, Searle will provide cash, equipment and construction
services to build the 65,000-square-foot plant. It will make 40 to
50 medications, including cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs,
Searle said.
<p>
   The facility should be completed by the second quarter of 1999.
<p>
   ``Searle is convinced that this market has significant potential
to become a sizable marketplace for high-quality, cost-effective
pharmaceutical products,'' said Searle chief executive Richard De
Schutter.
<p>
   St. Louis-based Monsanto is in the process of transforming
itself from a chemicals company into one focusing on agricultural
biotechnology, food ingredients and pharmaceuticals.

   Greenwich, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- UST Inc. said its
fourth-quarter earnings rose 3.4 percent as competition in the
moist snuff industry cut into sales.
<p>
   UST, which makes Skoal and Copenhagen brand snuff, said net
income rose to $114.5 million, or 61 cents a share, from $110.7
million, or 56 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue after excise
taxes rose 2.2 percent to $352.5 million from $344.9 million.
<p>
   The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company, which also makes
Washington state's Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Crest wines,
said its non-tobacco sales rose in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   The results matched a forecast the company released two weeks
ago when it said its fourth-quarter earnings would fall short of
analysts' expectations because of lower-than-expected sales. UST
shares fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in midmorning trading.
<p>
   UST, the nation's largest maker of moist snuff with about 80
percent of the market, said its unit sales fell 3 percent for the
fourth quarter. Competition from discounted brands, a pricing
policy change at military commissaries and sales of new products
caused the drop, the company said.
<p>
   UST, which has some of the highest-priced brands, has seen its
market share eroded by lower-priced brands.
<p>
   In response, UST has said it won't raise prices as much as in
the past or may even discount some brands, which it said may affect
earnings growth.
<p>
   For the year, net income rose 8 percent to $464 million, or
$2.42 a share, from $429.8 million, or $2.16. Revenue rose 5.4
percent to $1.40 billion from $1.33 billion.

<p>
   Winona, Minnesota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Fastenal Co.
shareholders aren't the only ones nervous about the company's
fourth-quarter earnings report due Friday.
<p>
   Short-sellers -- speculators who sold borrowed shares in the
hope of buying them back at a lower price -- may have more at
stake.
<p>
   They've sold short almost 4 million shares in a gamble that the
fast-growing distributor of nuts, bolts and other industrial
supplies, which has come up short of Wall Street earnings estimates
in the last two quarters, will again miss forecasts. That, they
hope, might finally deflate Fastenal's sky-high stock price of more
than 50 times estimated 1997 earnings.
<p>
   On the other side of the bet is the big mutual fund company
Janus Capital Corp., which stuffed its funds with $187 million in
Fastenal stock last summer.
<p>
   Janus officials wouldn't discuss Fastenal. But analyst Judith
Scott of Robert Baird &AMP; Co. thinks Janus will win this chapter of a
long-running battle between Fastenal's bulls and bears.
<p>
   ``Every year of its history there's been somebody who really
liked the stock and was willing to buy it at any price and made a
ton of money doing it,'' she said.
<p>
   The Winona, Minnesota, company has done plenty to confound its
critics. Earnings increased at a 35 percent annual rate in the five
years ended Dec. 30, 1995. Even with last year's earnings
disappointments, Scott said she thinks the company will end the
year with earnings of about 88 cents a share, more than 20 percent
above 1995.
<p>
   Adjusted for splits, Fastenal shares have soared more than
60-fold since the initial offering in 1987. The stock recently
traded at about 47. And while Fastenal is expensive compared with
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which has a price-to-earnings
ratio of 22, that's nothing new: The company's shares have traded
at an average of more than 50 times per-share earnings since 1993.
<p>
   Fastenal's performance is driven by a furious increase in sales
as it opens stores and adds new products. While it resembles a
wholesale distributor -- its stores tend to be in dingy industrial
areas, and a $10 minimum purchase discourages retail customers --
Fastenal's gross margins resemble Tiffany &AMP; Co. at more than 50
percent.
<p>
   Revenue soared to an estimated $300 million in 1996 from $20.3
million in 1987. Fastenal founder and Chief Executive Robert
Kierlin thinks growth will accelerate as the company starts
offering everything from janitorial supplies to cutting tools.
<p>
   ``We're hoping the economy stays reasonably strong and we'll be
able to put out 40 percent revenue growth in 1997,'' he said. ``It
should get better after that.''
<p>
   Such projections enrage short-sellers, who faced with
embarrassing losses decline to be quoted by name. They say the
company's vaunted growth rate is slowing, not accelerating. Indeed,
net income, which rose 57 percent in 1994 is expected to be up just
22 percent for 1996.
<p>
   And while revenue rose 28 percent to $210 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30, revenue at stores open two years or more
rose only 20 percent, half the rate reported in 1995.
<p>
   Signs of slowing growth has short sellers speculating that
sooner or later, Fastenal shares will plunge. Short interest in the
stock has hung at about 4 million shares since August, representing
more than 14 percent of the float, or 27 million shares available
for trading. So many shares are sold short that it would take more
than 30 days of average trading in the stock for bearish
speculators to buy back all the shares they need to return to
brokers.
<p>
   Some short-sellers even say Janus propped up Fastenal shares
last year, when it reported disappointing earnings. The fund bought
3.88 million shares between March 30 and Sept. 30, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, making Fastenal the
largest single holding in the $728 million Janus Enterprise Fund at
8.4 percent of assets.
<p>
   During that period, short-sellers say, some 30 million Fastenal
shares changed hands. Cutting the total in half to eliminate the
double-counting that analysts say is common in transactions on the
Nasdaq exchange, Janus represented a quarter of the trading in that
period.
<p>
   Janus just took advantage of the earnings disappointments to
assemble its stake, said analyst Scott of Baird &AMP; Co. Fastenal's
earnings were constrained last year, she said, because the company
boosted its work force by 40 percent to more than 3,000 to staff
promising new businesses.
<p>
   ``The reason they've missed numbers is the expenses of these
personnel,'' Scott said. ``They will get the payoff next year.''
<p>
   Kierlin certainly thinks so. He sees more growth potential in
businesses like janitorial services than in sticking with nuts and
bolts.
<p>
   ``The fastener business is $6 billion at wholesale, and we could
aspire to maybe 20 percent of the market,'' he said. ``Industrial
maintenance represents a $60 billion market.''
<p>
   So far, Kierlin has been right, watching an investment that
began with a single store in 1968 balloon to a market value of $219
million.
<p>
   Scott said many of the people who've bet against Fastenal over
the years -- commentator Dan Dorfman twice suggested in 1994 that
its shares would tumble, when in fact they more than doubled -- did
so on the misperception that the company competes with retail
hardware chains such as Home Depot Inc.
<p>
   In fact, Fastenal sells almost exclusively to commercial
customers. That hasn't stopped critics who look at the company's
expensive stock and conclude it's ready for a fall.
<p>
   These hopeful pessimists have waited a long time, but at some
point they may no choice but to say uncle.

<p>
   Marlboro, Massachusetts, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Stratus Computer
Inc. said fourth-quarter profit jumped a higher-than-expected 26
percent, boosted by lower costs and rising revenue at the maker of
computer systems.
<p>
   The company also said that founder and Chief Executive Bill
Foster plans to hire a new CEO by the end of the year. Foster said
in a statement that after almost 17 years running Stratus, ``the
timing is good for a new CEO.'' Foster will remain chairman of the
Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company.
<p>
   Stratus said fourth-quarter net income rose to $17.7 million, or
74 cents a share, from $14.1 million, or 60 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 29 rose 4.6
percent to $176.1 million from $168.4 million.
<p>
   Results were higher than the most recent estimate of 63 cents a
share from 10 analysts polled by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Stratus makes fault-tolerant systems that are used for bank
machines, telephone systems, gasoline pumps and other machines
where availability is crucial. Its shares were unchanged at 29 3/4
in late morning trading.
<p>
   The company's expenses for research and development,
compensation and other administrative functions fell 11.2 percent
to $57.3 million from $64.5 million.
<p>
   In August, Stratus announced that Foster would resume as CEO
after Gary Haroian resigned. Foster said at the time that he and
Haroian had a difference of opinion about the company's direction.
<p>
   The fourth-quarter sales increase at Stratus comes after two
quarters in which revenue growth stalled. In both the third and
second quarters of 1996, revenue was unchanged from the year-ago
period.

 &UR; U.S. ECONOMY: 1996 HOUSING STARTS STRONGEST IN EIGHT YEARS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- House construction enjoyed a
banner year in 1996, posting the strongest annual gain in eight
years, though snow, flooding and mud slides in the West depressed
December building activity, new figures showed today.
<p>
   Starts of new houses last year rose 8.8 percent to 1.474
million, the highest level since 1988. The increase was fueled by a
dip in 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates below 7 percent early
in the year and a pickup in economic activity in the fourth
quarter.
<p>
   Builders and analysts said the unexpectedly large 12.2 percent
decline in December starts, following a revised 9.3 percent
increase in November, doesn't mean the bottom has fallen out of the
housing market.
<p>
   ``We have relatively stable interest rates, and the highest
housing affordability in a long time,'' said Joel Rassman, chief
financial officer for Toll Brothers Inc., a Huntington Valley,
Pennsylvania, company that builds houses in 13 Eastern states.
<p>
   High levels of consumer confidence and job creation, plus rising
incomes and still-low mortgage rates, lead builders to expect a
strong year, though few expect this year's level of starts to top
1996.
<p>
   ``I'm rather optimistic about 1997 now that it's arrived --much
more optimistic than I was six or seven months ago,'' said Robert
Strudler, chief executive officer of U.S. Home Corp. in Houston.
Added Leonard Miller, chairman of Miami-based Lennar Corp.: ``You
see no major buildup of inventories in the industry.''
<p>
   In financial markets, U.S. government bond prices were little
changed after the report, leaving the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond at 6.78 percent. Stocks were mixed in New
York trading and the dollar was higher against other major
currencies.
<p>
   In December, alone, all regions of the country reported a drop
in new starts as the monthly rate fell to 1.329 million, adjusted
for seasonal variations -- the lowest since June 1995, according to
the Commerce Department. The flood-ravaged West was especially hard
hit. Analysts had expected a 2.8 percent decline for December
instead of the 12.2 percent drop reported.
<p>
   Meanwhile, permits for new housing construction fell 0.6 percent
nationwide in December to an annual rate of 1.410 million, rate
after increasing 4.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department
said.
<p>
   By category, single-family housing construction dropped 11.8
percent during December while multi-family projects declined 13.6
percent from a month earlier.
<p>
   By region last month, housing starts plunged 29.2 percent in the
West to a rate of 257,000; dropped 7.9 percent in the Midwest to
302,000; fell 7.2 percent in the South to 645,000; and declined 2.3
percent in the Northeast to 125,000.
<p>
   Though bad weather played a role in December's showing, that's
not entirely unexpected since home building usually ``winds down in
the winter months'' said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``We're going to see a
pickup in housing starts when the weather clears,'' said Carl
Palash, chief economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
<p>
   And with mortgage rates still at historically low levels, starts
``should be relatively robust'' in 1997, perhaps reaching a total
of 1.38 million, Brown said.
<p>
   At Dallas-based Centex Corp., one of the nation's largest home
builders and mortgage originators, spokeswoman Sheila Gallagher
said by the end of the company's fiscal year in March, Centex will
have built and delivered about 12,500 new homes, but that the total
will likely drop to 12,000 for the fiscal year ending March 1998.
After marching higher over several months, the average rate on a
30-year fixed loan fell to 7.60 percent in December from 7.62
percent in November, according to Bloomberg analytics.
<p>
   That put the average principal and interest payment on a
$100,000 loan at $706.07 last month, down from $707.45 a month
before. Those figures don't include tax, fire insurance or escrow
costs.
<p>
   In the most recent week, the average 30-year mortgage rate rose
2 basis points to 7.87 percent.
<p>
   The next move in home construction -- and sales -- will be
plainly evident when the weather turns milder in a few months.
<p>
   ``The real question is when does the consumer decide that the
time (to buy) is now,'' said Ira Norris, president of INCO Homes in
Upland, California. `I think people need to believe that housing
prices are on the rise before they buy, and right now the urgency
is not there.''

<p>
   Richmond, Virginia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Signet Banking Corp.
said fourth-quarter profit from operations rose 6 percent on
increased lending and service charges.
<p>
   The Richmond, Virginia-based bank said fourth-quarter earnings
rose to $33.6 million, or 55 cents a share, from $9 million, or 15
cents, in the same period in 1995.
<p>
   Not counting a $35 million charge for losses from commercial
loan fraud and earnings from Capital One Corp. before its spin-off
to shareholders in February, 1995, the company said its net income
for the fourth quarter of 1995 was $31.8 million, or 53 cents a
share.
<p>
   Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings were a penny over the average
forecast of 54 cents a share, according to a Zacks Investment
Research survey of 13 analysts. Signet shares were unchanged at 30
1/4.
<p>
   ``Targeted commercial and consumer businesses were very well
received in the marketplace,'' said Malcolm McDonald, Signet
chairman and chief executive, in a statement.
<p>
   Net interest income rose 1 percent to $116.7 million. Total
loans rose 12.7 percent to $6.32 billion, however net interest
margin, or the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and
earns on loans, narrowed to 4.56 percent from 4.78 percent.
<p>
   Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, rose 25 percent
to $84.7 million, driven by fees for loan service charges and other
fees.
<p>
   Noninterest expense, excluding the $35 million charge for loan
fraud in 1995, rose 6.9 percent to $125.3 million, as salaries and
benefits increased.
<p>
   The bank increased the amount it sets aside for future loan
losses 60 percent to $29.8 million, though non-performing assets
fell 29 percent to $38.8 million.

<p>
   Brussels, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The European Commission raised
the specter of court fights across Europe if the U.K. government
waves through the planned alliance of British Airways Plc and
American Airlines over European antitrust objections.
<p>
   Opening a new front in the battle over the U.S.-U.K. airline
linkup, European Union Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert
said any court challenge by the commission would prompt a slew of
suits by rival air carriers.
<p>
   Van Miert held out hope that the U.K. government will tie its
approval to further concessions by the two airlines, preventing
them from gaining a stranglehold on routes between the U.K. and
U.S., the biggest transatlantic air travel market.
<p>
   ``I hope it has come across that our desire is not one of
looking for a conflict,'' Van Miert told a press conference. ``It's
a long flight, a difficult flight with a lot of turbulence.''
<p>
   The feud over the claim by the commission, the EU's executive
agency, that it has jurisdiction over the air alliance has gone to
the highest reaches of the U.K. government, with Prime Minister
John Major calling it a wholly British matter.
<p>
   Van Miert last week threatened to take the U.K. government to
court if it okayed the alliance, which the commission says would
curtail competition on routes between the U.K. and U.S.
<p>
   In December, the U.K. government called on BA and American,
owned by AMR Corp., to give up 168 of their 3,352 weekly
takeoff-and-landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport, equivalent
to 12 daily round-trip flights and far few than rival U.S. airlines
had demanded.
<p>
   BA and American plan to unite their transatlantic flights, fares
and marketing, creating a BA-AA brand similar to partnerships
between U.S. and European carriers, such as KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines and Northwest Airlines Corp.
<p>
   BA and American already control 60 percent of U.S.-U.K. air
traffic and 24 percent of U.S.-Europe traffic. The two operate
every flight on some routes, such as Heathrow-Dallas and
Heathrow-Boston.
<p>
   Under EU law, the commission could appeal to the European Court
of Justice if it determines the alliance is illegal. In turn,
airlines like Lufthansa AG and Air France would be free to file
suit in their national courts.
<p>
   ``That gives the opportunity to competitors to go to court, not
just the European Court, but to take it to national court,'' Van
Miert said. He underlined that the commission is looking at all air
alliances, not only the U.K.-U.S. pact.

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- CoreStates Financial Corp.
said its fourth-quarter net income rose 1.8 percent as cost savings
and strong gains internationally couldn't offset slow loan growth.
<p>
   The nation's 21st-largest bank company reported net income rose
to $195.5 million, or 91 cents a share, from $192.1 million or 87
cents a share. The earnings were slightly below Wall Street's
expectations of 94 cents a share, according to a survey of 19
analysts by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   The fourth-quarter figures include the costs of CoreStates'
merger with Meridian Bancorp. last year. Without those costs,
earnings rose 2.8 percent to $201.6 million, or 93 cents a share,
from $196.1 million, or 89 cents.
<p>
   Revenue fell 1.3 percent to $761.5 million from $771.9 million.
Net interest income fell 2.0 percent as net interest margin
declined to 5.51 percent form 5.56 percent.
<p>
   For the full year, net income fell 0.9 percent to $649.1
million, or $2.97 a share, from $655.2 million or $2.95, a year
earlier.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Bear Stearns Cos. said earnings
in its fiscal second quarter rose 68 percent to a record $176.5
million, led by trading and investment banking.
<p>
   The sixth-biggest U.S. securities firm's net income for the
three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.27 a share, from $105.2
million, or 72 cents, in the same period a year earlier.
<p>
   That exceeded the average forecast of 89 cents a share from six
analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. The estimates ranged
from 82 cents a share to 95 cents. Bear Stearns shares rose 1/2 to
30 3/8.
<p>
   ``Bear Stearns had a strong underwriting business and a good
trading environment in all markets,'' said John Keefe, an
independent securities analyst.
<p>
   Bear Stearns' results come amid a surge in securities firms'
profits as low interest rates and record highs in the stock market
boost trading, underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Yesterday
Salomon Inc., the world's biggest bond trader, said fourth quarter
earnings rose 36 percent, while Smith Barney Inc., the
second-biggest broker, posted a 21 percent gain in profits.
<p>
   ``These are the best quarterly results Bear Stearns has ever
had, representing the sixth consecutive quarter in which our return
on common equity has topped 20 percent,'' said Bear Stearns Chief
Executive Officer James Cayne. The firm's return on shareholders
equity, a key measure of profitability, was 33 percent in the
second quarter.
<p>
   Bear Stearns, one of Wall Street's biggest traders of stocks and
bonds, said revenue for the quarter after interest expense rose 37
percent to $940.1 million from $688 million in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   Trading revenue rose 65 percent to a record $429.2 million.
Trading contributed 46 percent of the firm's net revenue in the
second quarter, versus 43 percent in the same period a year
earlier.
<p>
   Investment banking revenue rose 22 percent to $183 million. Bear
Stearns was the eighth-biggest underwriter of U.S. stocks and bonds
during the quarter, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, New
Jersey-based firm that tracks the securities industry. Bear Stearns
was the fifth-largest arranger of high-yield debt sales, the most
profitable bond underwriting for Wall Street firms.
<p>
   Brokerage commissions rose 12 percent to $184 million in the
second quarter.
<p>
   Bear Stearns' non-interest expense increased 27 percent in the
second quarter to $650 million. Compensation as a percentage of net
revenue in the quarter was 49 percent versus 50 percent in the same
period a year earlier.
<p>
   For sixth months ending December 31, 1996, Bear Stearns earned
$285.0 million, or $2.02 a share, up 43 percent from $199 million,
or $1.36, a year earlier. The firm's return on shareholders' equity
was 27 percent.

<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney
Co.'s ABC television network must pay Food Lion Inc. $5.5 million
in punitive damages for having two news producers lie to get jobs
at the supermarket chain, a federal jury decided.
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and its ``PrimeTime Live'' program
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage for a 1992
expose on food handling at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   Food Lion claimed the report cost it more than $2 billion in
lost profit and stock value.
<p>
   The jury spared the two producers but directed two ABC
executives to pay a total of $45,750.
<p>
   The Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last month awarded Food
Lion $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the salaries earned
by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- AT&AMP;T Corp.'s fourth-quarter
earnings fell short of expectations as a slight improvement in
long-distance operations was offset by higher costs related to
unpaid bills.
<p>
   Profit from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $1.24
billion, or 76 cents a share, from $1.09 billion, or 68 cents, in
the year-earlier period. Wall Street was expecting 80 cents, the
average estimate of 25 analysts from IBES International Inc.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's results show the company is beginning to stem customer
defections in its long-distance operations. However, the turnaround
is in its early stages and could take several quarters to complete,
analysts said.
<p>
   ``There is movement in the right direction,'' said Barry Sine,
an analyst at SBC Warburg Inc. ``The problem is the rate of
improvement is not substantial enough to meet expectations.''
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's sales rose 2.7 percent to $13.24 from $12.89 billion.
Continuing operations include AT&AMP;T's long-distance, wireless,
Internet and credit-card businesses.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T shares fell 3/4 to 38 5/8 at late morning.
<p>
   Volume, or the amount of traffic the company carried on its
long-distance network, rose six percent -- up from 5 percent in the
third quarter. AT&AMP;T said it began to see ``early-stage benefits''
from efforts to stem market-share loss such as its flat-rate
calling plan.
<p>
   The AT&AMP;T One Rate plan has 3 million customers that have come
from other AT&AMP;T calling plans as well as from competitors. It lets
users make long-distance calls for 15 cents a minute anywhere in
the U.S. and at any time.
<p>
   The plan ``is meeting AT&AMP;T's expectations for reducing customer
churn,'' AT&AMP;T said. Churn is the rate at which customers leave AT&AMP;T
for another long-distance carrier.
<p>
   ``They may have turned the corner, ending the decreasing growth
rates in volume,'' said Robert Wilkes, an analyst at Brown Brothers
Harriman.
<p>
   Still, AT&AMP;T's volume growth is expected to be the lowest among
the top three U.S. long-distance carriers. Analysts expect No. 2
MCI Communications Corp. to boost volume nine percent, while No. 3
Sprint Corp. is seen increasing volume 10 percent or more.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said sales from communications services -- which includes
long-distance and wireless -- rose 4.3 percent to $12.86 billion.
<p>
   Operating profit for communications services rose more than 14
percent to $1.91 billion, while operating margin widened to 14.8
percent from 13.5 percent.
<p>
   Uncollectibles
<p>
   AT&AMP;T for the first time cited ``uncollectible'' expenses in its
long-distance business resulting from unpaid phone bills related to
fraud, delinquencies and bankruptcies among its business customers.
The problem bills increased AT&AMP;T's expenses by $200 million in the
quarter.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T expects the uncollectible items to cost the company $100
million, or 4 cents a share per quarter, for the next few quarters.
<p>
   ``We don't think that's a one-time event,'' said Eileen
Connolly, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman.
<p>
   Analysts said other phone companies may report similar trends.
``It's something to put on the radar screen,'' Wilkes said.
<p>
   Wireless revenue rose 18 percent to $937 million, while the
company boosted its number of cellular customers 32 percent to 5.2
million. AT&AMP;T said that number includes more than 900,000 digital
wireless customers.
<p>
   Sales from communications products and other services, including
consulting and online services, rose 17 percent to $386 million.
Less than a year after it was unveiled, AT&AMP;T's WorldNet
Internet-access service has 568,000 customers.
<p>
   Financial services revenue fell 32 percent to $374 million
because of the company's 1995 program to diversify funding sources
for its AT&AMP;T Universal Card services, AT&AMP;T said.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's financial services business had an operating loss of $4
million, compared with an operating profit of $109 million a year
earlier. However, that's narrower than the $35 million loss in the
third quarter.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's total operating expenses from continuing operations rose
2 percent. The company said ``significant'' increases in network
expenses was offset by a decrease in access fees to connect to the
Bells's networks, and selling expenses.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said it had 130,400 employees as of Dec. 31, up 1.5
percent. The increase bucks AT&AMP;T's plan, unveiled last January, to
slash 17,000 jobs from its long-distance, wireless and credit-card
businesses. AT&AMP;T has cut 5,700 jobs under that plan.
<p>
   Those cuts have been offset by an increase in jobs at its
wireless and customer care positions for offering a package of
services.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T also said it plans this year to buy stock in the open
market for shareowner and employee-benefit plans, rather than issue
new shares, to try to decrease dilution from such plans. In the
1995 fourth quarter, AT&AMP;T said restructuring and other charges
reduced profit by $2.04 billion, or $1.27 a share, resulting in a
bottom-line loss of $948 million, or 59 cents.
<p>
   During the 1996 quarter, New York-based AT&AMP;T completed its
massive restructuring that spun off NCR Corp. and Lucent
Technologies Inc. It also tapped R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons Co. Chief
Executive John Walter to succeed Chairman Robert Allen in 1998.
<p>
   For 1996, AT&AMP;T said income from continuing operations rose to
$5.61 billion, or $3.47 a share, from $5.24 billion, or $3.29 a
year earlier.
<p>
   Sales for 1996 rose to $52.18 billion from $50.66 billion.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
International Business Machines Corp.'s weaker-than-expected profit
dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower.
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. added
surprisingly strong earnings announcements to this week's pile of
profit reports, helping broader averages set records for a fifth
straight session.
<p>
   IBM, the world's largest computer maker, sank 9 5/8 to 158 3/8,
trimming 34 points from the Dow industrials. The 30-stock Dow
average slid 59.27 to 6824.63, after dropping as much as 75.82
points.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which comprises 75
percent of the market capitalization of U.S. stocks -- rose 0.15 to
782.87. The computer-industry weighted Nasdaq Composite Index
gained 7.67 to 1384.64, paced by Microsoft Corp. for a third day.
``The market right now just wants to go up,'' said Kenneth Corba,
chief investment officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees
$2.7 billion. ``We're in a hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Outside of IBM, ``there's been no series of earnings
disappointments,'' Corba said.
IBM
<p>
   IBM said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent, slightly less
than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hurt
results. Net income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3
cents below analysts' expectations.
<p>
   ``They had some trouble in Europe,'' said analyst Bruce Raabe of
Collins &AMP; Co. ``And hardware sales were the weakest story.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at Compaq. The Houston-based computer
maker said earnings gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing
expectations by 11 cents. Compaq rose 3 3/4 to 82 1/4.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
Bristol-Myers
<p>
   Bristol-Myers earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a share, 2 cents
above analysts' expectations, according to IBES International Inc.
The shares dropped 1/4 to 121 3/8.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, also topping forecasts. Its
shares rose 3/4 to 37 7/8.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's shares lost
3/4 to 38 5/8.
<p>
   Stocks received no help from bonds, which declined as the
Treasury prepared to sell debt and a Federal Reserve governor
revived concern that the central bank may raise interest rates
soon. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, used as a benchmark
for corporate borrowing costs, was little changed at 6.79 percent.
<p>
   Still, with the Dow industrials up 6.36 percent already this
year, ``investors are more sensitive to news that's unfavorable
than news that's favorable,'' said Philip Roth, chief technical
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Travelers Group Inc.'s board
said it would buy back as much as $1 billion of stock and pay an
additional 33 percent on its quarterly dividend, sending the
insurance and financial services company's shares to an all-time
high.
<p>
   Travelers stock rose 2 1/8 to a record 53 3/8 on trading of 1
million shares, approaching its six-month daily trading average of
1.3 million shares by mid-day.
<p>
   The buy-back represents as much as 18.7 million shares, or about
3 percent of 639 million shares outstanding. Repurchases will help
meet demands of Travelers' employee stock option and other benefit
programs, the company said.
<p>
   The company's board voted to pay a 15 cent-a-share quarterly
dividend, up from 11.25 cents. It is payable Feb. 21 to
shareholders of record Feb. 3.

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Australian dollar was
little changed as a series of reports highlighting the country's
sluggish economy bolstered the expectation that the central bank
will cut interest rates.
<p>
   ``The Australian dollar is under pressure from the fact that
they are still talking about lower rates over there,'' said Mike
Norton, a trader at ING Baring Capital Markets. ``The economy is
still a little struggling, and they need to do something to jump
start it.''
<p>
   The Australian dollar was recently quoted at 77.59 cents, little
changed from yesterday's 77.77 cents.
<p>
   Weak retail sales and a high jobless rate will continue to
restrain the economy until the middle of the year and keep alive
chances the central bank will cut rates, said Access Economics, an
Australian forecasting group.
<p>
   ``We expect output growth to accelerate from mid 1997 as world
activity picks up, housing recovers, public-sector cuts slow and
the stock cycle turns,'' Access said in a 1997 outlook report
prepared for clients.
<p>
   In other economic news, while the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's
index of economic activity rose 0.6 percent in November, most of
that came from new building activity related to the 2000 Olympics
in Sydney.
<p>
   Further, weekly wages for workers in the centralized wage system
were unchanged in November, alleviating concern that wages could
fuel inflation.
<p>
   That, in turn, did little to damp expectation that the central
bank will cut rates soon. Lower rates hurt the Australian dollar by
making holdings denominated in it less attractive to investors.

NORWEGIAN HERITAGE ALIVE IN TINY TOWN &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NORSE, Texas  &MD;  Pernell Aars' voice is deep and commanding.
<p>
   You look at this man with sheet-white chin whiskers and huge
fingers crooked from years of work and immediately want to sit and
listen to him tell a story or two.
<p>
   So here I sat with Aars and his wife Rosalie in the majestic Our
Savior's Lutheran Church, organized in 1869, and listened to
stories of the early Norwegians who came here in 1854.
<p>
   ``They said Bosque County was like Norway, so eight families
came here from East Texas,'' he said. ``By 1880 about 1,000
Norwegians lived here.''
<p>
   That included Cleng Peerson, known as the Father of Norwegian
Immigration to America.
<p>
   ``He is buried in the cemetery,'' said Rosalie Aars.
<p>
   That helped to bring the King of Norway in 1982 to this tiny
settlement about six miles west of Clifton and 70 miles
south-southwest of Fort Worth.
<p>
   ``I've been going to church here 83 years. Was baptized here,''
Pernell Aars said.
<p>
   Sunlight flashed though the beautiful stained-glass windows as
he talked.
<p>
   ``The interior is much the same as the original,'' Rosalie Aars
said. ``And they have had church here every Sunday since 1876.''
<p>
   Then we walked to the cemetery to look at Peerson's grave. We
stopped at the marker of the Rev. John K. Rystad, the pastor from
1878 to 1925.
<p>
   ``That was 47 years. Can you imagine a man staying that long
anywhere?'' he said.
<p>
   We came to Peerson's marker, a towering stone edifice. One side
reads: ``The pioneer of Norse immigration to America. Born in
Norway May 17, 1782. Landed in America in 1821 and died in Texas
Dec. 16, 1865.''
<p>
   The other side is written in Norwegian.
<p>
   We wandered past graves of Colwicks, Branhagens, Amundsons and
Wegners. Rosalie Aars pointed to an old marker with the fading
letters of August, 1862.
<p>
   The man's name was Evan Questad. His father was Carl Questad,
one of the original settlers who gave land for this cemetery and
later sold land for the church site.
<p>
   ``The story was that he (Evan) was standing watch for Indians.
He developed pneumonia and died,'' she said. ``The strange thing
was that it happened in August, when getting pneumonia seems
unusual.''
<p>
   There are other unusual stories about people buried here. One
concerns Gustav Wilhelm Belfroge.
<p>
   He was a world-renowned Norwegian naturalist and lived in this
community from 1870 to 1879.
<p>
   History says that he accumulated a great collection of insects
by setting his traps at night under two great live oaks that once
stood in front of a blacksmith shop.
<p>
   He sent many of his specimens back to Norway, where they were
placed in the national museum.
<p>
   The story goes that Belfroge's fondness for nature was matched
by his fondness for drink.
<p>
   Sometimes, he had no money to buy liquor. He solved the problem
by drinking the alcohol ]in which his specimens were preserved.
<p>
   He died Dec. 7, 1882. He had an insect collection that numbered
36,881 and was valued then at $368.

<p>
   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Roche Holding AG was in the
spotlight again today as shares in the Swiss drugmaker surged on
speculation it is planning a major acquisition.
<p>
   In an industry where the companies keep getting bigger as their
numbers shrink, the cash-rich Roche is almost sure to make a major
acquisition soon, analysts say.
<p>
   Such speculation is not new. For several years, shares in
possible targets like Britain's Zeneca Group Plc, Warner-Lambert
Co. in the U.S. and Sweden's Astra AB have jumped with the view
that Roche could be looking to buy them.
<p>
   While the company insists it is well placed without an
acquisition, shares rose today as much as 11 percent on what
analysts said was speculation it could be poised to sell its
under-performing Givaudan-Roure fragrances and flavorings division.
The proceeds could be used to further build its $10 billion war
chest for a major purchase, they say.
<p>
   ``If Roche wanted to shed a unit before strengthening its
pharmaceuticals portfolio, Givaudan would be a prime candidate,''
said Claudio Werder, an analyst at Bank J. Vontobel AG. ``It's the
one unit that fits least into the company's strategy.''
<p>
   Roche's widely traded non-voting shares jumped as high as 12,500
Swiss francs ($8,729), an intraday record, ending the day up 7
percent at 11,935 francs. Its closely held bearer shares ended
trading up 3 percent to 16,235.
<p>
   Speculation about a major Roche acquisition was heightened last
year when Sandoz AG and Ciba-Geigy AG joined to form Novartis AG.
The creation of Novartis, which received U.S. approval in December,
pushed Roche off of first place in the Swiss drugmaker league
table.
<p>
   ``Last summer, everybody was only talking about Novartis,'' said
Patrick Carisch, head of equities at Credit Suisse Asset Management
and a Roche shareholder. ``Now, Roche is back en vogue, and people
obviously expect something from the company sooner or later.''
<p>
   While Roche faces patent expirations of major drugs in several
years, the company that built itself on the success of the
antidepressant Valium has possible blockbuster drugs close to
market that could push growth, along with a big foothold in the
booming biotechnology market.
<p>
   The nagging question in investors' minds is whether the
Ciba-Sandoz union will prompt Roche to spend some of its $10
billion cash pile on an acquisition. The Ciba-Sandoz union merger,
which received final U.S. approval in December, booted Roche from
first to second place in the Swiss drugmaker league table and
eighth place worldwide.
<p>
   Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Stuart Harris estimates Roche
could put together financing of $20 billion more. ``They could fund
a deal pretty easily,'' he said.
<p>
   The market has moved fast to drive up share prices of potential
takeover targets, betting that Roche would soon jump back on the
takeover bandwagon after its successful $5.3 billion takeover of
the Syntex Corp. in the U.S. in 1994.
<p>
   Two years ago, Zeneca, viewed as Roche's dream target for its
portfolio of new cardiovascular and cancer drugs, could have been
bought for half the $30 billion it would take today.
<p>
   Or, if Roche wanted to expand in the flourishing
over-the-counter healthcare products market like rival SmithKline
Beecham Plc, it could have bought Warner-Lambert Co., a U.S. market
leader with brands like Schick razors and Halls cough drops, for
around $15 billion in 1994. Now it would take twice that, analysts
said.
<p>
   Recently, even SmithKline was considered a Roche takeover
target. The blockbuster acquisition could easily cost $35 billion
or more, and would vault Roche beyond Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc
and Novartis, the two largest drug companies in market share.
<p>
   In an industry that has seen a record of nearly $100 billion
worth of mergers and acquisitions since 1994, such a bid could be
justified. No drugmaker now has more than 5 percent of the world
market. Analysts and industry executives say a 10 percent market
share is a good base for survival in a rapidly changing
marketplace. A Roche-SmithKline merger would put it closer to that,
though not all the way.
<p>
   Combating newly powerful group buyers of drugs and struggling to
cut costs to fund expensive research and development operations,
the worldwide drug industry has seen dozens of agreed or forced
marriages in recent years.
<p>
   The largest include Glaxo's $14.7 billion Wellcome takeover,
American Home Products Corp. purchase of American Cyanamid for $9.7
billion and Hoechst AG's purchase of Marion Merrill Dow for $7.1
billion.
<p>
   Roche says it's in no hurry to make an acquisition, which
analysts say may be partly because three founding families of the
company still control more than 50 percent of the voting stock.
They reportedly don't want their holdings diluted, as they would be
in a stock swap merger like that of Novartis.
<p>
   That leaves debt financing, a more expensive route, though one
which Roche hasn't been afraid to use. In addition to Syntex, Roche
paid cash in 1990 when it bought a controlling stake in
California-based Genentech Inc., one of the world's oldest and most
successful biotechnology companies, for $2.1 billion.
<p>
   Max Gurtner, spokesman for Roche, scoffs at the notion the
company is under pressure to buy anything.
<p>
   ``We will always remain subject to all these rumors because we
have this cash pile,'' said Gurtner. ``That will continue.''
<p>
   To counterbalance the argument that it must acquire something,
Gurtner points to Roche's unblemished record earnings growth in the
last nine years and strong pipeline of promising products.
<p>
   Last week, the company said 1996 sales had grown 11 percent to
15.9 billion Swiss francs ($11.6 billion) and that it expects
another rise in net profit in 1996, which it reports later in the
year.
<p>
   Like all drugmakers, Roche wants to expand its product base.
While it faces a patent expiration to one of its largest products,
the anesthetic Dormicum, also called Versed, in the U.S. in three
years, other products are in a stronger patent position.
<p>
   Its biggest seller, the widely used antibiotic Rocephin, which
generated 1.2 billion Swiss francs in 1995, won't face generic
competitors until 2002, analysts say, well after other products
will have reached the market.
<p>
   ``They are not in the situation of an Astra or a Glaxo, where
they have a huge product going off patent,'' said Genghis
Lloyd-Harris, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst who rates the
stock a ``buy.''
<p>
   Among the products that are expected to drive strong growth are
the anti-obesity drug Xenical, which was filed for approval in the
U.S. last month; Posicor, a next generation calcium channel blocker
heart medication, and Invirase, a new AIDS medication that adds to
a stable of two other drugs to treat the deadly disease, Hivid and
Cytovene.
<p>
   Still, analysts think the company will make an acquisition soon.
<p>
   Lloyd-Harris said that while Roche has made a healthy, 14
percent return on its cash resources in recent years, the funds
could become too large in comparison to its drug operations in
coming years. This may be an enviable position for some but one
which raises questions about appropriate use of shareholders'
wealth, he said.
<p>
   ``There comes a point that your cash pool gets too big,'' said
Lloyd-Harris, which could be ``a compelling reason'' for an
acquisition.
<p>
   Speculation that disagreements on the need for an acquisition
may arise among Roche shareholders was evident this month when
Martin Ebner, the Swiss financier behind BZ Group, a Roche
shareholder, acknowledged that he had recently sold part of voting,
``bearer'' shares in the company.
<p>
   Ebner, at a press conference, denied it had to do with
disagreements. He didn't elaborate further.
<p>
   ``That's not because we're unhappy with the management, but
because we wanted to broaden our holdings,'' said Ebner.

   Paris, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics NV plunged 12 percent after Europe's biggest
semiconductor maker said fourth-quarter profit fell 15.5 percent
and warned revenue could fall in the first quarter. Fourth-quarter
net fell to $142 million, or $1.02 a share, on sales of $1.06
billion. A year earlier, the company earned $168 million, or $1.24
a share, on sales of $974.7 million. While the decline in net was
expected, the company unnerved the market by saying first-quarter
sales will fall to about $988.4 million, hurt by weak prices caused
by oversupply in its lower-margin memory products. It expects
renewed growth throughout the rest of the year.
<p>
   ``SGS-Thomson's only problem is its share price has run ahead of
itself, in tandem with Intel, going too far too fast,'' said
Kenneth Anderson, a portfolio manager at Edinburgh-based Scottish
Widows Investment Management Ltd., which has some 20 billion pounds
($33 billion) in assets. ``The earnings and outlook in themselves
were broadly in keeping with expectations,'' he added.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson's warning comes a week after Intel Corp., the
world's biggest chipmaker, said rising expenses, price cuts and a
seasonal dip in demand will hamper its earnings too. SGS-Thomson's
shares took an extra hit when International Business Machines
Corp.'s stock began dropping in New York on lower-than-expected
fourth-quarter earnings.
<p>
   Shares of SGS-Thomson had more than doubled over the past 12
months. They rose 14 percent over the past week after Salomon
Brothers and Lehman Brothers increased their 12-month target for
the company's American depository receipts to $100. Lehman Brothers
reiterated that target price in a note today.
<p>
   SGS shares closed at 379 French francs ($68.5), down 12 percent
-- their biggest one-day drop ever. The ADR's fell 13.25 percent,
or $10 5/8, at 68 5/8 in early trading.
<p>
   ``What they said on the outlook for the first quarter can be
construed as a very slight profit warning,'' said John Fordyce, a
trader at Paris-based brokerage Ferri.
<p>
   Still, analysts and investors said SGS-Thomson's emphasis on
making high-margin specialty chips for the exploding market of
more-sophisticated digital consumer electronics products should
allow it to see strong growth once the semiconductor market has
overcome its latest slump.
<p>
   ``In spite of its comments on this quarter, SGS is still a
growth story within the semiconductor industry,'' said Patricia
d'Ille, who manages a $20 million fund at Monte Paschi Banque.
<p>
   D'Ille said she was taking advantage of the dip in SGS-Thomson
shares to add them to her portfolio.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson has bucked the trend of falling semiconductor sales
at companies including Motorola Inc. of the U.S. by concentrating
on high-margin chips used in cellular telephones, computer disc
drives and digital-television signal decoders.
<p>
   Fourth-quarter sales at SGS-Thomson, a French-Italian company,
were up 9 percent from a year earlier. Sales for the year rose 16
percent from a year earlier to $4.12 billion, with the biggest
growth coming from high-margin ``differentiated'' chips.
<p>
   Orders for such chips represented 58.6 percent of net revenues
in 1996, up from 51.5 percent in 1995. They were 61.3 percent of
sales in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   As part of its strategy, SGS-Thomson forms alliances with other
companies, including Alcatel Alsthom SA, Northern Telecom Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and disk drive maker Seagate Technology Inc.,
to develop the sophisticated chips they need. Those and other
companies accounted for 31 percent of SGS- Thomson's 1996 sales.
<p>
   Analysts said that strategy should pay off in 1997, as demand
for mobile phones and digital decoders takes off.
<p>
   ``I'm quite optimistic for SGS-Thomson, especially when I look
at the new technologies they've developed and the advances they
have,'' said Jim Tully, a technology analyst at Dataquest.
<p>
   As part of this strategy, SGS-Thomson recently agreed to work
with Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest maker of software for
personal computers, to design a new product to make it easier to
play digital video discs, or DVDs, on personal computers. DVDs are
expected to eventually replace video cassette recorders and CD-ROMs
used in multimedia computers.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson has largely steered clear of the competitive
dynamic-random-access memory chip market, where average prices were
slashed 75 percent last year as a surplus of chips flooded the
market. These chips are primarily used in personal computers and
basic consumer-electronics goods.
<p>
   Full-year net income rose 19 percent to $625.5 million, or $4.50
a share, compared with $526.5 million, or $4.03 a share, in 1995.
Analysts had predicted full-year earnings of $4.46 a share.
Full-year operating income rose 23 percent to $799.4 million.
<p>
   Per-share earnings were based on average shares outstanding of
138.7 million compared with 130.6 million in 1995.
<p>
   Research and development costs rose 21 percent to $532.3 million
in 1996, representing 12.9 percent of revenue. Capital investments
totaled $1.12 billion for the year, up from $1.0 billion in 1995.
<p>
   The company said it expects capital spending in the first half
of 1997 to equal the $660 million it spent in the first half of
1996.
<p>
   As of Dec. 31, total debt was $623.1 million, including $194.9
million of long-term debt. Shareholders equity stood at $3.26
billion.
<p>
   Pasquale Pistorio, SGS-Thomson's president and chief executive,
said the company's low debt level gave it the agility it needed to
make new investments or even acquisitions if the opportunity
arises.
<p>
   ``There is no good (acquisition) opportunity in sight,'' for
now, he added.
<p>
   Pistorio declined to comment on speculation SGS-Thomson's
shareholder structure could change in the near future.
<p>
   SGS-Thomson is controlled by a group of Italian and French
state-owned companies, with only 30.6 percent of its shares
publicly traded.
<p>
   But as the French government moves to sell defense electronics
company Thomson-CSF and float a stake in France Telecom SA, those
companies might look to sell their stake in SGS-Thomson.
<p>
   Pistorio denied a press report that French Industry Minster
Franck Borotra had approached him about bringing in new
shareholders into the company's capital if state- controlled sell
their stake in the company.
<p>
   ``The job we have as managers is to make the company perform,''
Pistorio said. ``We don't see anything that could impact the
company's performance.''
<p>
   SGS-Thomson has factories in Phoenix, Arizona, and Crolles,
France, and is building new factories in Singapore; Catania, Italy,
and Rousset, France. It's U.S. headquarters are in Carrollton,
Texas.

CLINTON'S SPEECH WAS SHORT AND . . . DID I SAY IT WAS SHORT? &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By BILL THOMPSON &QC; 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   If you were looking for soaring rhetoric, for inspirational
themes, for memorable images and quotable turns of phrase  &MD;  if you
were looking for a great speech, in other words  &MD;  President
Clinton's second inaugural address was surely not your cup of tea.
<p>
   Well, then, if Clinton's speech was not deeply inspirational or
searingly memorable or eminently quotable, what was it?
<p>
   Two words come to mind, one of which, ``pedestrian,'' is not a
compliment. But the other word, a word that is too rarely applied
to a speech by William Jefferson Clinton, is meant as high
flattery.
<p>
   The speech was ``short.''
<p>
   Short by Clinton standards, anyway. He spoke for 21 or 22
minutes, depending on whose clock you trust. He's been known to
spend 22 minutes clearing his throat.
<p>
   He must have been in a hurry to get to those 14 inaugural balls.
He didn't want to show up late and miss Al Gore doing the Macarena.
<p>
   If he'd been so inclined, Clinton could have pushed the
afternoon soap operas into the realm of late-night television.
<p>
   It hardly seems fair to criticize the president's speech after
he mercifully opted to practice oratorical self-control. But then
nobody said life was fair, as another smooth-talking Democrat once
noted.
<p>
   Clinton is vastly overrated as an orator, perhaps because he had
the good fortune to be compared to George Bush in 1992 and to Bob
Dole in the most recent presidential election. Bush and Dole are
great Americans, but neither man's resume begins with the phrase
``scintillating public speaker.''
<p>
   There's no denying that Clinton can reel off a pretty good
speech from time to time. On occasion, he's been known to rise to
the, uh, occasion.
<p>
   Unfortunately, Inauguration Day 1997 was not one of those
occasions.
<p>
   It wasn't that Clinton failed to touch on significant issues. He
talked about racial harmony, personal responsibility, the
importance of American leadership in a changing world. The problem
was that he didn't address those issues with any conviction or
passion.
<p>
   The speech seemed to have been written by a committee, and he
delivered it with all the intensity of a bureaucrat reading a
committee report.
<p>
   For many of those 21, or 22, minutes that Clinton spoke, he
seemed to be arguing with himself. For example:
<p>
   ``Government is not the problem, and government is not the
solution. We, the American people, we are the solution....
<p>
   ``As times change, so government must change. We need a new
government for a new century  &MD;  humble enough not to try to solve
all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to
solve our problems for ourselves.''
<p>
   Let's go over that again: Government shouldn't try to solve our
problems but it should ``give us the tools to solve our problems.''
<p>
   That's double talk, folks: Government should be weaker but
should also be stronger.
<p>
   It's a reflection of the ambiguity that defines Bill Clinton.
<p>
   Clinton knows full well that most Americans want less
government, and he wants to comply with their wishes. But he can't
shake his lifelong liberal's compulsion to look first toward
government whenever a solution is needed.
<p>
   Personally, I'd rather have seen the president yield to his
natural inclination to prescribe a government remedy for every ill.
I'd have liked his speech better if he'd chosen one side or the
other  &MD;  even the wrong side  &MD;  and embraced it with every fiber of
his being. That would have been leadership, whether you agreed with
him or not.
<p>
   Instead, he did what he always does. He tried to have it both
ways.
<p>
   The fundamental flaw in Clinton's inaugural address was the
fundamental flaw in his character and his presidency: He has, as
someone said of his predecessor, no principles strong enough to
break.
<p>
   On the first day of his second term as our 42nd president,
Clinton decided to straddle the bridge to the 21st century, instead
of leading us across it.
<p>
   But it's hard to rip him for that. It's what he's always done.
<p>
   And at least the speech was short.
<p>

<p>
   Brasilia, Brazil, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) - Brazilian lawmakers are
expected to discuss for another three to four months a
constitutional amendment allowing the nation's president, governors
and mayors to run for re-election.
<p>
   ``The debate will last through April or May. There are numerous
committee and floor votes that need to be held before voting is
finished,'' Murillo de Aragao, head of the Brasilia-based
consulting firm Arko Advice, told the Bloomberg Forum.
<p>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's four-year term as
president ends in 1998. Investors view a successful re-election bid
by Cardoso as an assurance that his government's economic policies
will continue for the next six years, said de Aragao.
<p>
   Members of Cardoso's Social Democrat party and their allies in
the lower house of Congress hope to hold the first of two floor
votes on the re-election amendment by Jan. 29. The measure needs
three-fifths approval to become law.
<p>
   Still, before two floor votes in the lower house, the amendment
must pass through two committees. Then, after leaving the lower
house, the amendment goes before a committee in the Senate,
followed by two Senate floor votes, said de Aragao.
<p>
   While lawmakers start the voting process, supporters of
Cardoso's re-election are stoking the fires of his government's
growing public support. Cardoso's Social Democrats and allies from
a leading right-of-center party have spent about $2 million on a
10-day advertising blitz for re-election.
<p>
   At the end of 1996, Cardoso was considered ``excellent'' or
``good'' by 47 percent of Brazil's population, according to the
Datafolha polling service. That's up from 36 percent when he took
office in January, 1995.
<p>
   Many Brazilians are happy with the job Cardoso and his economic
team are doing. When he was still Brazil's finance minister,
Cardoso implemented in 1994 a program that slashed inflation to 10
percent last year, down from roaring four-digit price increases.
<p>
   Even with Cardoso's popularity rising, opposition to his
re-election still exists. The clauses of the re-election amendment
allowing mayors and governors to run for a consecutive term are a
possible source of dissent among congressmen, said Arko's de
Aragao.
<p>
   ``If the amendment is not passed, we might see a period of
confusion, more political than economical,'' said de Aragao. ``But
after three to four weeks, things will get back to normal
considering the popular support for the `Real Plan.'''
<p>
   In the meantime, Cardoso's rivals are eagerly awaiting the
outcome of the re-election debate. Former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo
Maluf, Workers Party leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Jaime
Lerner, the governor of the prosperous southern state of Parana,
are among those that are considering mounting their own
presidential bid, said de Aragao.

<p>
   Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Compaq Computer Corp.'s
fourth-quarter earnings rose 43 percent, far exceeding estimates,
on increased sales of computers to corporate customers and
improvements in operating efficiency.
<p>
   The No. 1 personal computer maker said net income rose to $462
million, or $1.64 a share, up from year-earlier profit from
operations of $323 million, or $1.17. Acquisition-related charges
of $241 million, or 87 cents, in the 1995 quarter resulted in net
income of $82 million, or 30 cents.
<p>
   Revenue rose 15 percent to $5.42 billion from $4.7 billion.
<p>
   Compaq's results exceeded all but the most-optimistic estimates.
Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.53 a share, based on the
average estimate of 34 analysts from First Call. Many analysts had
increased their unofficial forecasts to about $1.60 in recent
weeks.
<p>
   ``They're gaining market share, profit margins are increasing,
cash is growing, what else do you want?'' said Stephen Dube, an
analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities.
<p>
   Compaq shares jumped 4 1/8, or 5.3 percent, to 82 5/8 on trading
of 4.4 million, more than the three-month daily average of 3
million. Compaq led some other computer makers' shares higher, with
Dell Computer Corp.'s stock rising 1 7/8 to 66.
<p>
   Houston-based Compaq said its closely watched gross margin ---
revenue minus the cost of manufacturing computers -- rose to 24.4
percent, its highest level in almost two years. Compaq cited a
shift toward corporate computers and servers, which carry higher
profit margins, as well as aggressive moves to cut inventory and
speed up collection of payments.
<p>
   Compaq slashed inventory almost in half to $1.15 billion from
$2.16 billion a year ago, said Compaq's chief financial officer,
Earl Mason. Days sales outstanding, a measure of how long Compaq
takes to collect its bills, fell to 53 from 60. Those moves helped
Compaq reduce the amount of money tied up in inventory and
receivables and boost cash to $4 billion from $745 million in the
year-earlier period.
<p>
   ``What you see happening is, our people got to some of the
inventory goals about a year ahead of schedule,'' said Mason, who
joined Compaq from Inland Steel Industries Inc. in May.
<p>
   Mason said Compaq will continue to report higher earnings and
profit margins this year than in 1996, although he declined to say
whether the company will exceed its fourth-quarter gross margin of
24.4 percent.
<p>
   Compaq won't be able to trim inventory as much this year as it
did in 1996, Mason acknowledged. He said the bulk of gains in
profitability will come from a shift toward so-called enterprise,
or large corporate computer, systems.
<p>
   ``As the enterprise business becomes more of a lion's share of
our overall revenue stream, then the mix alone brings up gross
margins,'' Mason said.
<p>
   Compaq's profitability has been bolstered by new products,
including a line of workstations aimed at engineers and financial
professionals. Compaq also has acquired several companies that make
systems to link computers in networks, so it can sell entire
computer systems and not just desktop PCs.
<p>
   Selling, general and administrative expense rose to 10.6 percent
of revenue in the fourth quarter from about 10 percent in the
year-earlier period.
<p>
   Research and development expense increased to about 1.9 percent
from 1.7 percent, Compaq said. The company made up for those
increases by trimming inventory and better managing the flow of
products through the manufacturing and selling process.
<p>
   For the year, Houston-based Compaq reported net income of $1.31
billion, or $4.66 a share, compared with profit from operations of
$1.03 billion, or $3.74 a share. Compaq reported 1995 net income of
$789 million, or $2.88 a share, after the acquisition-related
charges.
<p>
   Revenue increased 23 percent to $18.11 billion from $14.76
billion.

<TEXT>
<p>
   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Roche Holding AG was in the
spotlight again today as shares in the Swiss drugmaker surged on
speculation it is planning a major acquisition.
<p>
   In an industry where the companies keep getting bigger as their
numbers shrink, the cash-rich Roche is almost sure to make a major
acquisition soon, analysts say.
<p>
   Such speculation is not new. For several years, shares in
possible targets like Britain's Zeneca Group Plc, Warner-Lambert
Co. in the U.S. and Sweden's Astra AB have jumped with the view
that Roche could be looking to buy them.
<p>
   While the company insists it is well placed without an
acquisition, shares rose today as much as 11 percent on what
analysts said was speculation it could be poised to sell its
under-performing Givaudan-Roure fragrances and flavorings division.
The proceeds could be used to further build its $10 billion war
chest for a major purchase, they say.
<p>
   ``If Roche wanted to shed a unit before strengthening its
pharmaceuticals portfolio, Givaudan would be a prime candidate,''
said Claudio Werder, an analyst at Bank J. Vontobel AG. ``It's the
one unit that fits least into the company's strategy.''
<p>
   Max Gurtner, head of Roche communications, said today the
company considers Givaudan-Roure a core activity.
<p>
   Roche's widely traded non-voting shares jumped as high as 12,500
Swiss francs ($8,729), an intraday record, ending the day up 7
percent at 11,935 francs. Its closely held bearer shares ended
trading up 3 percent to 16,235.
<p>
   Speculation about a major Roche acquisition was heightened last
year when Sandoz AG and Ciba-Geigy AG joined to form Novartis AG.
The creation of Novartis, which received U.S. approval in December,
pushed Roche off of first place in the Swiss drugmaker league
table.
<p>
   ``Last summer, everybody was only talking about Novartis,'' said
Patrick Carisch, head of equities at Credit Suisse Asset
{Management and a Roche shareholder. ``Now, Roche is back en vogue,
and people obviously expect something from the company sooner or
later.''
<p>
   While Roche faces patent expirations of major drugs in several
years, the company that built itself on the success of the
antidepressant Valium has possible blockbuster drugs close to
market that could push growth, along with a big foothold in the
booming biotechnology market.
<p>
   The nagging question in investors' minds is whether the
Ciba-Sandoz union will prompt Roche to spend some of its $10
billion cash pile on an acquisition. The Ciba-Sandoz union merger,
which received final U.S. approval in December, booted Roche from
first to second place in the Swiss drugmaker league table and
eighth place worldwide.
<p>
   Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Stuart Harris estimates Roche
could put together financing of $20 billion more. ``They could fund
a deal pretty easily,'' he said.
<p>
   The market has moved fast to drive up share prices of potential
takeover targets, betting that Roche would soon jump back on the
takeover bandwagon after its successful $5.3 billion takeover of
the Syntex Corp. in the U.S. in 1994.
<p>
   Two years ago, Zeneca, viewed as Roche's dream target for its
portfolio of new cardiovascular and cancer drugs, could have been
bought for half the $30 billion it would take today.
<p>
   Or, if Roche wanted to expand in the flourishing
over-the-counter healthcare products market like rival SmithKline
Beecham Plc, it could have bought Warner-Lambert Co., a U.S. market
leader with brands like Schick razors and Halls cough drops, for
around $15 billion in 1994. Now it would take twice that, analysts
said.
<p>
   Recently, even SmithKline was considered a Roche takeover
target. The blockbuster acquisition could easily cost $35 billion
or more, and would vault Roche beyond Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc
and Novartis, the two largest drug companies in market share.
<p>
   In an industry that has seen a record of nearly $100 billion
worth of mergers and acquisitions since 1994, such a bid could be
justified. No drugmaker now has more than 5 percent of the world
market. Analysts and industry executives say a 10 percent market
share is a good base for survival in a rapidly changing
marketplace. A Roche-SmithKline merger would put it closer to that,
though not all the way.
<p>
   Combating newly powerful group buyers of drugs and struggling to
cut costs to fund expensive research and development operations,
the worldwide drug industry has seen dozens of agreed or forced
marriages in recent years.
<p>
   The largest include Glaxo's $14.7 billion Wellcome takeover,
American Home Products Corp. purchase of American Cyanamid for $9.7
billion and Hoechst AG's purchase of Marion Merrill Dow for $7.1
billion.
<p>
   Roche says it's in no hurry to make an acquisition, which
analysts say may be partly because three founding families of the
company still control more than 50 percent of the voting stock.
They reportedly don't want their holdings diluted, as they would be
in a stock swap merger like that of Novartis.
<p>
   That leaves debt financing, a more expensive route, though one
which Roche hasn't been afraid to use. In addition to Syntex, Roche
paid cash in 1990 when it bought a controlling stake in
California-based Genentech Inc., one of the world's oldest and most
successful biotechnology companies, for $2.1 billion.
<p>
   Max Gurtner, spokesman for Roche, scoffs at the notion the
company is under pressure to buy anything.
<p>
   ``We will always remain subject to all these rumors because we
have this cash pile,'' said Gurtner. ``That will continue.''
<p>
   To counterbalance the argument that it must acquire something,
Gurtner points to Roche's unblemished record earnings growth in the
last nine years and strong pipeline of promising products.
<p>
   Last week, the company said 1996 sales had grown 11 percent to
15.9 billion Swiss francs ($11.6 billion) and that it expects
another rise in net profit in 1996, which it reports later in the
year.
<p>
   Like all drugmakers, Roche wants to expand its product base.
While it faces a patent expiration to one of its largest products,
the anesthetic Dormicum, also called Versed, in the U.S. in three
years, other products are in a stronger patent position.
<p>
   Its biggest seller, the widely used antibiotic Rocephin, which
generated 1.2 billion Swiss francs in 1995, won't face generic
competitors until 2002, analysts say, well after other products
will have reached the market.
<p>
   ``They are not in the situation of an Astra or a Glaxo, where
they have a huge product going off patent,'' said Genghis
Lloyd-Harris, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst who rates the
stock a ``buy.''
<p>
   Among the products that are expected to drive strong growth are
the anti-obesity drug Xenical, which was filed for approval in the
U.S. last month; Posicor, a next generation calcium channel blocker
heart medication, and Invirase, a new AIDS medication that adds to
a stable of two other drugs to treat the deadly disease, Hivid and
Cytovene.
<p>
   Still, analysts think the company will make an acquisition soon.
<p>
   Lloyd-Harris said that while Roche has made a healthy, 14
percent return on its cash resources in recent years, the funds
could become too large in comparison to its drug operations in
coming years. This may be an enviable position for some but one
which raises questions about appropriate use of shareholders'
wealth, he said.
<p>
   ``There comes a point that your cash pool gets too big,'' said
Lloyd-Harris, which could be ``a compelling reason'' for an
acquisition.
<p>
   Speculation that disagreements on the need for an acquisition
may arise among Roche shareholders was evident this month when
Martin Ebner, the Swiss financier behind BZ Group, a Roche
shareholder, acknowledged that he had recently sold part of voting,
``bearer'' shares in the company.
<p>
   Ebner, at a press conference, denied it had to do with
disagreements. He didn't elaborate further.
<p>
   ``That's not because we're unhappy with the management, but
because we wanted to broaden our holdings,'' said Ebner.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Panama received a ``junk'' bond
rating for its outstanding publicly-traded debt from Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., its first rating for
the country.
<p>
   Moody's rated the bonds ``Ba1,'' the top level for high risk
debt, which is considered below investment-grade.
<p>
   The rating applies to a note sold by the government as well as
its $3.5 billion in outstanding Brady bonds, created last year as
part of a restructuring accord, from old bank loans on which Panama
defaulted in the past decade.
<p>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's assigned Panama a `BB+' rating.
<p>
   Panama's bonds surged 4.175 points or 5.6 percent on the news.
Panamanian interest-reduction bonds soared in morning trading to 76
5/8 bid and 77 1/8 offered.
<p>
   A ``manageable'' debt burden and progress toward an open economy
prompted the ratings, Moody's Managing Director for sovereign risk
Vincent Trugliea and Steven Hess, a senior analyst, said in a
report.
<p>
   ``The outlook for the Panamanian economy is for gradual
improvement.'' The rating wasn't higher because of ``the poor
record of repayment by the government during the past decade.''
<p>
   ``Economic reforms that are being implemented by the current
government should provide a basis for improved economic performance
over the next several years,'' the report said.
<p>
   The changes include selling state firms, repealing labor
protection laws, removing import tariffs and beefing up regulation
of the financial industry, the credit rating company said.
<p>
   The rating report highlighted Panama's growing maritime
transport and tourism industries, which are using land and
facilities the U.S. expects to hand over to Panamanian authorities
in 1999.

<p>
   When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that its goal
was to achieve ``health for all by the year 2000,'' nobody seemed
to think the idea was ridiculous.
<p>
   After all, it was 1978: AIDS was unknown; the WHO had played a
major role in fighting smallpox, which was eradicated in 1977, and
it helped poorer countries produce essential drugs cheaply. The WHO
was taken seriously.
<p>
   Today things are different. The WHO, 50 years old next year, is
in crisis. It has become a bit-player on the international stage
and is increasingly under fire for its lack of leadership and
failure to modernize.
<p>
   The events of the next 12 months are likely to decide its
future. The executive board  &MD;  the governing body drawn from the
WHO's member states  &MD;  gathered this month in Geneva in a tense
meeting. Earlier, the United States had threatened to reduce its
contribution, which would leave the organization $20 million short
this year.
<p>
   During the meeting, the WHO drew up its new global policy for
the 21st century. Next January, the board must elect a
director-general for the next five years.
 &UR; QUESTIONABLE LEADERSHIP &LR; 
<p>
   Both the policy and the leadership candidates are being closely
scrutinized by the WHO's members. Industrialized countries largely
pay for the WHO. Most of them have been critical of the its
management for the past five years and their patience is running
out. Some developing countries are also voicing concern.
<p>
   The current director-general, Hiroshi Nakajima, is expected to
stand for a third term. His election for a second term, back in
1993, was opposed by most Western industrialized countries, which
blame him for the WHO's decline since he took over in 1988.
<p>
   Their views have not changed.
<p>
   ``Our position is the same as in 1993,'' says one Western
diplomatic source. ``We do not wish Nakajima to run again.''
<p>
   Who they would prefer to lead is less clear. The current
unofficial shortlist includes several internal candidates, two of
the WHO's six regional directors, a deputy health minister from
Zambia and the director of the U.N. Population Fund, Nafis Sadik.
There is also excitement, but little evidence, that Norway's former
prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, might be persuaded to stand.
 &UR; UPDATING POLICY &LR; 
<p>
   But leadership is not the only concern of the WHO's critics.
They want to modernize the WHO. Four years ago, the executive board
recommended 47 changes in the organization, many of them minor. But
the board also asked the WHO to set new, practical targets for the
future and to clarify what it does that other organizations cannot.
All eyes are now on the WHO's response.
<p>
   The WHO was once on its own in promoting health around the
world. Now it has gradually been joined by UNICEF, the U.N.
Development Program, the U.N. Population Fund and the World Bank,
which argues that a healthy workforce helps a country's economy to
grow faster.
<p>
   The World Bank's health budget alone is $2.5 billion this year  &MD; 
dwarfing the WHO's annual budget of $900 million  &MD;  making it the
largest external source of financing for health in developing
countries.
<p>
   Recently, the WHO has also begun to lose intellectual initiative
to the World Bank, says Kelley Lee, a health policy researcher at
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has
analyzed the WHO's work.
<p>
   ``The bank is setting the terms of the debate and the WHO is
catching up. They should be taking the lead.''
<p>
   The WHO's mandate, made when it was founded in 1948, was
ambitious: ``The attainment by all peoples of the highest possible
level of health.'' Today, critics argue, the organization should
define its aims more realistically and concentrate on priorities,
such as the health of the poorest 1 billion people.
<p>
   But the WHO's senior management has decided that ``health for
all'' should remain its key goal. Details of the policy have yet to
be filled out, because the organization is still consulting its
members. But the broad aims include reducing poverty and ensuring
that everyone has equal access to health care.
<p>
   Critics think the policy is too broad and lacks specific
targets. In documents circulated by the Dag Hammarskjold
Foundation, an influential Swedish think-tank, for a meeting in
Uppsala, Sweden, last April, the policy was described as
``unreachable'' and ``vague.''
 &UR; MISSING TARGETS &LR; 
<p>
   The clamor for a more tightly focused policy is growing. The
WHO's core job has always been to provide information and technical
backup. It makes epidemiological forecasts and gives guidelines on
the treatment of diseases. It also sets standards, such as the safe
limits of chemicals in air or water.
<p>
   Because no one else has a mandate to do these jobs, argue the
critics, the WHO should concentrate on them, and stop trying to be
all things to all people.
<p>
   Apart from these tasks, they say, the WHO should concentrate on
major challenges such as smoking, which will kill 8.4 million
people a year by 2020.
<p>
   One of the WHO's traditional tasks  &MD;  and one of its least
glamorous  &MD;  is to strengthen basic health care in developing
countries. If the WHO withdraws from such open-ended tasks to
concentrate on providing information, poorer countries fear they
will be left with even less help, Lee says.
<p>
   Because the WHO has spread its resources so thinly, its
technical staff lack the time to analyze data thoroughly, say
health researchers. Almost everyone agrees that one of the WHO's
most important tasks is to provide clear and accurate figures on
the causes of death in all countries.
<p>
   Last year, the WHO published conflicting versions of its own
numbers. The World Health Report estimated that 3 million people
died from tuberculosis (TB) and 2 million from malaria. Two other
1996 reports carrying the WHO's logo  &MD;  The Global Burden of Disease
and Investing in Health Research and Development  &MD;  said that there
were 2 million deaths from TB and fewer than 1 million deaths from
malaria.
<p>
   Both sets of numbers came from the same technical staff. But the
lower numbers  &MD;  produced in a joint effort between the WHO and
Harvard University  &MD;  were subject to rigorous checks to ensure that
nobody was counted twice.
<p>
   The WHO loses credibility if it cannot perform its core
functions properly, such as getting its numbers right, argues one
American scientist.
<p>
   ``You don't provide moral leadership if you don't pay attention
to the facts.''
 &UR; A NEW FOCUS? &LR; 
<p>
   For all the criticism, almost no one doubts the need for the
WHO. They just want it to do its job better. Passionate defenders
of the WHO are also some of the strongest advocates of change.
<p>
   Dean Jamison, professor of public health at the University of
California at Los Angeles, says the WHO's egalitarian commitment to
health for all must be safeguarded at a time when market principles
are changing healthcare.
<p>
   ``It's extremely important (for the WHO) to be exercising moral
leadership and mobilizing communities for the highest ethical
standards possible,'' Jamison says. But, he adds, ``it had better
get itself energetic leadership,'' and concentrate on its greatest
strengths.
<p>
   Or as Richard Peto, a leading epidemiologist at the University
of Oxford, puts it, the WHO's job should be ``to count the dead by
the year 2000.''

recommended 47 changes in the organization, many of them minor. But
the board also asked the WHO to set new, practical targets for the
future and to clarify what it does that other organizations cannot.
All eyes are now on the WHO's response.
<p>
   The WHO was once on its own in promoting health around the
world. Now it has gradually been joined by UNICEF, the U.N.
Development Program, the U.N. Population Fund and the World Bank,
which argues that a healthy workforce helps a country's economy to
grow faster.
<p>
   The World Bank's health budget alone is $2.5 billion this year  &MD; 
dwarfing the WHO's annual budget of $900 million  &MD;  making it the
largest external source of financing for health in developing
countries.
<p>
   Recently, the WHO has also begun to lose intellectual initiative
to the World Bank, says Kelley Lee, a health policy researcher at
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has
analyzed the WHO's work.
<p>
   ``The bank is setting the terms of the debate and the WHO is
catching up. They should be taking the lead.''
<p>
   The WHO's mandate, made when it was founded in 1948, was
ambitious: ``The attainment by all peoples of the highest possible
level of health.'' Today, critics argue, the organization should
define its aims more realistically and concentrate on priorities,
such as the health of the poorest 1 billion people.
<p>
   But the WHO's senior management has decided that ``health for
all'' should remain its key goal. Details of the policy have yet to
be filled out, because the organization is still consulting its
members. But the broad aims include reducing poverty and ensuring
that everyone has equal access to health care.
<p>
   Critics think the policy is too broad and lacks specific
targets. In documents circulated by the Dag Hammarskjold
Foundation, an influential Swedish think-tank, for a meeting in
Uppsala, Sweden, last April, the policy was described as
``unreachable'' and ``vague.''
 &UR; MISSING TARGETS &LR; 
<p>
   The clamor for a more tightly focused policy is growing. The
WHO's core job has always been to provide information and technical
backup. It makes epidemiological forecasts and gives guidelines on
the treatment of diseases. It also sets standards, such as the safe
limits of chemicals in air or water.
<p>
   Because no one else has a mandate to do these jobs, argue the
critics, the WHO should concentrate on them, and stop trying to be
all things to all people.
<p>
   Apart from these tasks, they say, the WHO should concentrate on
major challenges such as smoking, which will kill 8.4 million
people a year by 2020.
<p>
   One of the WHO's traditional tasks  &MD;  and one of its least
glamorous  &MD;  is to strengthen basic health care in developing
countries. If the WHO withdraws from such open-ended tasks to
concentrate on providing information, poorer countries fear they
will be left with even less help, Lee says.
<p>
   Because the WHO has spread its resources so thinly, its
technical staff lack the time to analyze data thoroughly, say
health researchers. Almost everyone agrees that one of the WHO's
most important tasks is to provide clear and accurate figures on
the causes of death in all countries.
<p>
   Last year, the WHO published conflicting versions of its own
numbers. The World Health Report estimated that 3 million people
died from tuberculosis (TB) and 2 million from malaria. Two other
1996 reports carrying the WHO's logo  &MD;  The Global Burden of Disease
and Investing in Health Research and Development  &MD;  said that there
were 2 million deaths from TB and fewer than 1 million deaths from
malaria.
<p>
   Both sets of numbers came from the same technical staff. But the
lower numbers  &MD;  produced in a joint effort between the WHO and
Harvard University  &MD;  were subject to rigorous checks to ensure that
nobody was counted twice.
<p>
   The WHO loses credibility if it cannot perform its core
functions properly, such as getting its numbers right, argues one
American scientist.
<p>
   ``You don't provide moral leadership if you don't pay attention
to the facts.''
 &UR; A NEW FOCUS? &LR; 
<p>
   For all the criticism, almost no one doubts the need for the
WHO. They just want it to do its job better. Passionate defenders
of the WHO are also some of the strongest advocates of change.
<p>
   Dean Jamison, professor of public health at the University of
California at Los Angeles, says the WHO's egalitarian commitment to
health for all must be safeguarded at a time when market principles
are changing healthcare.
<p>
   ``It's extremely important (for the WHO) to be exercising moral
leadership and mobilizing communities for the highest ethical
standards possible,'' Jamison says. But, he adds, ``it had better
get itself energetic leadership,'' and concentrate on its greatest
strengths.
<p>
   Or as Richard Peto, a leading epidemiologist at the University
of Oxford, puts it, the WHO's job should be ``to count the dead by
the year 2000.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  While the U.S. Constitution protects many rights of
the accused, such as a right to a speedy trial, to have a jury
present and to be represented by a public defender, it doesn't
grant any specific privileges for victims.
<p>
   To remedy what they see as an ``egregious inequity'' in the
system, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz.,
have introduced a Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment.
<p>
   The amendment grants victims certain rights including the
prerogative to be informed of trial proceedings, to be present and
heard, to be notified of an escape or release of the offender, and
to be entitled to restitution.
<p>
   ``The constitution guarantees 15 specific rights to dependents
and no rights to victims,'' Feinstein said. ``This has caused real
injustice to victims.''
<p>
   Feinstein concedes the measure faces ``an uphill battle,'' to
get the necessary two-thirds vote from both chambers and
ratification by three-fourths of the states to be tacked onto the
constitution. So far, 29 senators have signed onto the measure, Kyl
said.
<p>
   On the House side, a victims' rights amendment will be filed by
Rep. Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
<p>
   A Republican staffer says there is strong support for the
amendment. ``I think this will be a tough one to vote against ...
This is not going to be deep-sixed.''
<p>
   But, the staffer said, ``We expect expressions of grave concern
about the cost,'' from prosecutors, prison officials and the law
enforcement community.
<p>
   Feinstein acknowledges that some members see the Constitution as
``immutable'' but argues that times have changed since the nation's
founding document was drafted, making it ripe for an adjustment.
<p>
   ``When it was drafted, there weren't 10 million victims of
violent crime,'' Feinstein said. ``At the time the constitution was
written, this wasn't a problem. In order to be a living document,
there must be additions to support circumstances of the times.''
<p>
   So far, 29 states have taken action to guarantee victims'
rights. President Clinton also threw his support behind a victims'
rights amendment last year as did former Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
<p>
   Last Congress, the amendment, which has gone through 42 drafts
since then, was cosponsored by 29 senators. Both the Republican and
Democratic Party platforms called for a victims' rights amendment.

 &UR; (NOT) HOOKED ON HEBONICS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFF JACOBY &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Ebonics you've heard of. Hear, now, about Hebonics.
<p>
   Sometimes called Jewish English, Hebonics is actually a distinct
language spoken by American Jews of Eastern European origin. Its
speech patterns are based on the Ashkenazic Language Systems native
to Russia, Poland, and Rumania. Hebonics  &MD;  the term is an amalgam
of ``Hebrew phonics''  &MD;  is more than a mere dialect. It has rules
of grammar, pronunciation, and syntax that distinguish it from
standard English.
<p>
   In Hebonics, for example, the letter ``w'' is often pronounced
``v.'' (``Vy don't ve go for a valk?'') Consonants are hardened at
the end of words. (``I luff to eat rye breadt.'') And the ``th''
sound is frequently rendered as a ``t.'' (``Vun, two, tree, four
...'') Combining all three rules might yield a sentence such as:
``Tenks Gott, I feel pretty vell, andt you?''
<p>
   In Hebonics, prepositions that would be required in standard
English may be dropped. ``You vant a cup coffee?'' a
Hebonics-speaking hostess might ask, ``or maybe a piece strudel?''
At times the preposition ``about'' is replaced with ``from.''
(``Vat kind mechanic he is? From cars, he knows nuttink!'')
<p>
   As a discrete language, Hebonics has its quirks. It is normal,
for instance, to answer questions with questions (``How are you
feeling?'' ``How do you (ital) tink (unital) I'm feeling?''). The
same method can be used to turn a question aside. (``What time is
it?'' ``Vat do I look like, a vatch?'')
<p>
   Several Hebonics usages have entered idiomatic American English.
The best known may be the expression of dismissive contempt through
repetition, adding an ``sh'' sound to the second word: ``Jennings,
Shmennings  &MD;  I only vatch Tom Brokaw.''
<p>
---------- &QC; 
<p>
   It's okay, laugh. ``Hebonics'' is a joke. Treat the broken
English of Yiddish-speakers as a genuine language? Hilarious! And
nobody would find the notion more absurd than  &MD;  American Jews of
Eastern European origin. Especially those for whom the Eleventh
Commandment has always been: ``Thou shalt make sure thy children
get a good education.'' The fractured spelling and tortured
pronunciation of ``Hebonics'' are errors to be corrected, not a
``linguistic code'' to be legitimized. Any Jewish parent or teacher
who suggested otherwise would be guffawed out of town.
<p>
   Ebonics should be a joke, too. But in dozens of urban public
schools, it has become a tragedy.
<p>
   Oakland's board of education drew nationwide scorn with its
recent vote to teach black schoolchildren in ghetto-ese. But as
Kate Zernike reported in The Boston Globe last week, Oakland is not
alone.
<p>
   In Los Angeles, more than 30 schools have already implemented
Ebonics programs. ``Teachers are taught to ignore students' lapses
into Black English,'' Zernike wrote. Bad diction is overlooked.
Improper tenses aren't flagged. Gloria Lezine, a teacher at the
Woodcrest school in South Central Los Angeles, told Zernike that
she would never correct a student's dropped g's or ``tell him to
fix his double negative. She would never strike spelling errors
with a red pen. What's wrong, she says, is telling students they're
wrong.''
<p>
   This is the self-esteem movement gone insane. For generations,
countless millions of poor English speakers viewed mastery of the
language as a critical key to success and self-respect. Now come
the Ebonics extremists, and proclaim the opposite: Make young black
Americans learn proper English and their cultural pride will be
shattered.
<p>
   ``If we degrade their language,'' says one Los Angeles Ebonics
instructor, ``we're degrading their whole home environment, their
whole race. That creates a filter; they just tune us out.''
Translation: Black children are too dumb to learn good English. If
you're looking for racism, look no further.
<p>
   Naturally, kids trapped in the Ebonics schools are growing up
illiterate. At the 31 Los Angeles schools that treat street slang
as an authentic language, grades have plummeted. Reading scores for
the Woodcrest School's fourth-graders sank to the (ital) 12th
(unital) percentile last year. The citywide average, reported
Zernike, was 36, while fourth-graders in non-Ebonics schools scored
above the 70th percentile.
<p>
   Black ghetto dialect is no more immutable than the bungled
English of those Jewish greenhorns from Eastern Europe. I know of
one immigrant from Czechoslovakia who couldn't speak a word of
English when he got off the boat in 1948. Twenty months later,
recuperating in Colorado from an illness, he wrote a letter to his
relatives in Cleveland:
<p>
   ``Where were you that time what you wrote me? Do you get
together after with each other? Rita changed her mind and wrote me
a letter, but I do not think that I will answer it. How is she with
you, did you talk to her and when, not because it interest me just
I want to know what did she told you about me.''
<p>
   That young immigrant struggling to write in English was my
father. I grew up in a world filled with men and women whose
English was no better than his. None of them believed that their
lousy language skills deserved ``respect'' or ``validation.'' None
would have sent their children to schools that did believe it.
Their English may have been shaky, but they weren't stupid.
Hebonics, shmebonics. Broken English is nothing to be proud of. And
every child can learn to speak correctly.

   Sometimes, we get gifts in the Food section. Last week, we got
one from Tom Mays of Fort Worth, Texas.
<p>
   Here's the history that came along with the recipe.
<p>
   In 1968, Ridglea Country Club opened a second 18-hole golf
course, for men only. Mrs. Willie Williams was the head chef for
the course. A craze developed over Mrs. Williams' chili recipe; the
takeout business often equaled the dine-in orders, Mays writes.
<p>
   Mrs. Williams retired in 1989, leaving chili lovers bemoaning
their loss. But Mays was one of the lucky ones because he received
a copy of the recipe. Following is Mrs. Williams' recipe.
<p>
   And in a real departure for Texans, I'm also running a recipe
for chili made with chicken, and yes, fellow cowboys, beans. If the
beans and chicken really offend you, call it a stew and move on.
It's a nice combination for a family dinner or when you've got to
feed a crowd. This recipe is from ``365 More Ways to Cook Chicken''
by Melanie Barnard (HarperCollins, $12.95).

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- GreenPoint Financial Corp.'s
fourth-quarter net income rose 75 percent as the New York City
thrift increased nationwide mortgages and other lending.
<p>
   GreenPoint's net income rose to $33.9 million, or 81 cents a
share, from $19.4 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier. That beat
the average Wall Street estimate by a penny a share, according to a
Zacks Investment Research survey of 10 analysts.
<p>
   ``This past year was a breakthrough for GreenPoint,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive Thomas Johnson said in a statement. ``We began
to realize the strong financial rewards coming from careful
execution of our business strategy.'' GreenPoint shares rose 5/8 to
55 1/4 in late morning trading. The company's net interest income
-- the interest it collected minus the interest it paid -- rose 13
percent to $114.6 million, as GreenPoint's interest expense fell 18
percent.
<p>
   Total loans outstanding rose 25 percent to $7.29 billion, as the
bank booked $735 million in mortgages in the quarter. GreenPoint
specializes in ``low-doc, no-doc'' mortgages, requiring less
documentation from applicants than most banks.
<p>
   The net interest margin, a measure of the gap between the
interest rates the bank pays and receives, widened to 3.82 percent
from 2.96 percent in the same period in 1995.
<p>
   The bank set aside $4.89 million for future loan losses,
compared with a recovery of $2.47 million a year earlier, though
total nonperforming assets fell 11 percent to $384.7 million.
<p>
   Noninterest income, excluding gains from securities sales, fell
15 percent to $10.8 million.
<p>
   Noninterest expense, including writeoffs goodwill related to
past acquisitions, fell 22 percent to $63.3 million, aided by
reduced premiums for federal deposit insurance.
<p>
   Net income for 1996 rose 23 percent to $132.5 million, or $3.02
a share, from $107.5 million, or $2.29, in 1995.

<p>
   Minneapolis, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Piper Jaffray Cos. said its
fiscal first-quarter net income fell 73 percent as legal fees
stemming from lawsuits against its Piper Capital Management unit
rose.
<p>
   The parent of Minneapolis-based securities firm Piper Jaffray
Inc. said net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.8
million, or 10 cents a share, from $6.7 million, or 37 cents, a
year earlier.
<p>
   Piper Jaffray stock fell as much as 3/4 to 18 1/2 in morning
trading.
<p>
   ``It's disappointing that litigation-related expenses continue
to have a negative impact on our net income,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive Addison L. Piper said in a statement.
<p>
   Total revenue at the firm rose 4.7 percent to $138.8 million
from $132.5 million a year ago.
<p>
   Revenue from brokerage commissions rose 9 percent to $46.4
million. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose 7.7 percent, while
the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 9.6 percent during the
quarter. That helped boost the average number of shares that
changed hands daily on the New York Stock Exchange almost 17
percent to 430 million.
<p>
   Trading revenue rose 7.6 percent to $44 million from $40.9
million a year earlier. Investment banking revenue slipped 16
percent to $20.9 million from $25 million in the same period in
1995, as the firm's equity unit posted lower revenue, said
spokeswoman Marie Uhrich.
<p>
   Revenue from asset management was also lower, falling 7 percent
to $8.9 million.
<p>
   Expenses climbed 11.7 percent to $135.8 million, led by a 21
percent gain in the ``other expenses'' category to $22.2 million.
The category includes legal costs related to lawsuits involving the
firm's asset management unit.
<p>
   The majority of the other expenses costs, however, do not derive
from legal or settlement costs, Uhrich said.
<p>
   Piper Jaffray faces lawsuits and claims involving 13 funds at
its Piper Capital Management unit, Uhrich said. Its Institutional
Government Income Portfolio mutual fund was ravaged by
derivative-related losses in 1994 in mid-1994, and lost about a
quarter of its value. Investors filed lawsuits, alleging they had
been misled about the fund's risks.
<p>
   Payroll expenses rose 12 percent to $86 million, as the firm
hired 68 people in its capital markets division.

   Bogota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Colombian stocks fell for a sixth
day amid concern the U.S. could impose trade sanctions because of
unhappiness over the Colombia drug trade.
<p>
   ``The tendency is still for prices to fall, and this may
continue a bit more (in coming days),'' said Guillermo Espinosa,
trader at Correval SA brokerage.
<p>
   The Bogota IBB index fell 23.6 points, or 2.4 percent, to
963.01, according to a preliminary estimate. Trading volume was
1.79 billion pesos ($1.8 million), down from the 1996 trading
average of 2.3 billion pesos.
<p>
   Among movers, Bavaria SA fell 8.5 percent to 5,200 pesos.
Bancoquia fell 7.9 percent to 2,423 pesos. Cadenalco SA fell 5.6
percent to 850 pesos. Coltabaco fell 8.4 percent to 3,500 pesos.
<p>
   Washington is angry at Colombia for imposing light sentences on
two top leaders of the Cali drug cartel. This could lead to trade
sanctions when Washington issues its annual report on the global
drug trade March 1.
<p>
   The six-day slump follows 18 straight days in increases, in
which the Bogota index soared 26 percent in peso terms.
<p>
   In New York, Banco Ganadero fell 1/2 to 29 5/8, after the bank
reported net income rose 6 percent in 1996 over 1995, below
expectations.

<p>
   Oak Brook, Illinois, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- McDonald's Corp. is
expected to report a modest increase in fourth-quarter earnings as
its sales growth slows worldwide.
<p>
   The world's largest fast-food chain is expected to earn 57 cents
a share, the average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp., up from 51 cents a year earlier. The company is expected to
report earnings later this week.
<p>
   Sales at McDonald's U.S. restaurants open at least a year fell
an estimated 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the quarter, said Dean
Witter analyst David Adelman. That's partly because a confusing
marketing campaign has left people unsure about what McDonald's has
to offer, he said.
<p>
   ``They've been talking about price, new products, kids meals,
movie promotional tie-ins, Olympics,'' Adelman said. ``There hasn't
been one overlying consistency to their message.''
<p>
   McDonald's doesn't give a specific figure for its same-store
sales, though it does say whether they rose or fell. Same-store
sales are considered a good indicator of a company's business
because they don't include newly opened or expanded stores.
<p>
   The sales lost from that lack of focus is compounded by
successful marketing campaigns by Burger King and Wendy's
International Inc., which take some customers away from McDonald's.
<p>
   Additionally, profit margins are expected to slip because of the
combination of lower same-store sales and higher labor costs from
efforts to improve the quality of service.
<p>
   Outside the U.S., results are expected to be mixed, with the
sluggish economies in France, Germany and Canada leading to slower
sales growth there. Also, the dollar is so much stronger than the
Japanese yen that currency translation could hurt McDonald's even
though sales are strong in Japan.
<p>
   Earnings still could get a boost from international profits
because of easier comparisons than earlier in the year. While the
20 percent gain in international sales a year ago is no small
amount to match, it's smaller than the 38 percent and 44 percent
increases in the first and second quarter of last year,
respectively.

 &UR; TIME RUNNING OUT IN FRAUD PROBE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HERRON ZAMORA &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  As the clock winds down on the statute of
limitations, San Francisco police are feverishly probing five
mysterious deaths that may involve a murder-for-profit scheme  &MD;  and
new details are emerging on alleged errors by officers formerly on
the case.
<p>
   For nearly four years, police have been investigating
allegations that five elderly San Francisco men were slowly
poisoned to death while their assets and estates were plundered  &MD; 
just as slowly  &MD;  by a family of con artists.
<p>
   The probe, code-named Foxglove, has long been marred by
accusations of misconduct against the original two investigators.
<p>
   In documents newly obtained by The Examiner, the Police
Department has accused the pair  &MD;  pulled off the case in 1994  &MD;  of
jeopardizing the safety of a witness, failing to warn potential
victims of danger and leaking a sealed request for a search warrant
to private investigators who were allegedly planning to shop the
story to Hollywood producers.
<p>
   In the overall case, the four-year statute of limitations on
alleged fraud, theft and financial elder abuse expires in February.
<p>
   If prosecutors do not file charges on the alleged lesser crimes
next month, then the only possible case left will be homicide, the
hardest charge to prove. That deadline may force the department and
prosecutors to either file the lesser charges or drop the costly,
complex investigation.
<p>
   Neither district attorney's spokesman John Shanley nor Deputy
Police Chief John Willett would say whether they planned to file
charges.
<p>
   ``I anticipate that there will be a decision whether or not we
proceed with the case in February,'' Willett said. ``It's not going
to be quietly given up. ... We've done too much to just hope that
it goes out into the sunset.''
<p>
   The five alleged victims were all befriended not long before
their deaths by members of a group that included Angela Tene; her
mother, Mary Tene Steiner; her brother, Danny Tene, and Angela's
boyfriend, George Lama.
<p>
   Law enforcement officials say all three Tenes are members of the
Tene Bimbo clan, which gained notoriety in Peter Maas' best-selling
1974 book, ``King of the Gypsies,'' and in a film of the same name.
<p>
   Since fall 1994, Inspector Phil Tummarello has been
investigating allegations that the four may have slowly poisoned
the men, using the drug digitalis in a plot to acquire their
estates. Digitalis, a heart drug that can be fatal in higher doses,
is derived from the foxglove plant.
<p>
   The bodies of four men  &MD;  Philip H. Steiner Jr., 93; Konstantin
K. Liotweizen, 92; Nicholas C. Bufford, 87; and Stephen Storvick,
91  &MD;  were exhumed in 1994 for autopsies.
<p>
   An autopsy also was conducted on a fifth person, Harry Glover
Hughes, 94, when he died in March 1994. Police have not released
the autopsy results.
<p>
   The subjects of the investigation have not been accused of any
crimes. They could not be reached for comment but have denied any
wrongdoing through their legal counsel.
<p>
   Tummarello was assigned to Foxglove after the first two
inspectors came under investigation for alleged misconduct.
<p>
   The inspectors, Gregory Ovanessian and Daniel Yawczak, are
accused of ``engaging in conduct which subverts the good order,
efficiency and discipline of the department'' in connection with
their handling of the early part of the investigation in 1993.
<p>
   Both have denied wrongdoing, are fighting the administrative
charges and are still working on non-Foxglove investigations.
<p>
   Among the most serious accusations: They ``permitted the
disclosure of confidential information from a witness who has
requested confidentiality. After the disclosure, the victim's life
was threatened, and she had to move from her home to safety,''
according to police documents.
<p>
   They are also accused of waiting from February 1993 until
September 1993 to inform some possible victims of the alleged
scheme, potentially jeopardizing their lives.
<p>
   Ovanessian and Yawczak ``permitted the scheme to continue,''
police documents say, and ``took no steps to notify the alleged
victims or their families of the danger to their lives.''
<p>
   During that same period in 1993, Ovanessian and Yawczak
allegedly told a private investigator ``that the case was taking
too much of their time and that once the people die, they can check
the bodies for poison,'' according to a police document outlining
the misconduct charges.
<p>
   Yawczak also allegedly told a city attorney's investigator he
was ``too busy to do the case'' and that they would ``wait until
the men die, and then they would have a murder case,'' police
documents state.
<p>
   Tummarello, who helped create a special unit to investigate
financial abuse of the elderly in 1993, has declined to comment on
details of the case.
<p>
   ``The seriousness of the allegations (of murder) warrant
scrutiny,'' Tummarello said Tuesday. ``Investigations like this
take on a life of their own. I'm sure all the parties involved
would like to see the investigation concluded, but the complicated
nature of the allegations dictates that a very thorough
investigation is going to take a substantial amount of time.''
<p>
   For more than a year, Tummarello worked on the case at a desk in
the Police Department's homicide detail at the Hall of Justice. In
1996, he was moved to a state Department of Justice office
building, allowing him more privacy.
<p>
   Inspector Michael Stasko, who has a background of investigating
fraud and police misconduct, joined him there. They are being
assisted by state officials and are working on no other cases,
Willett said.
<p>
   Police Chief Fred Lau stressed that Ovanessian and Yawczak were
considered innocent until proved otherwise.
<p>
   He conceded that the department was hampered by leaks about the
case in 1994 and said the department had learned from its mistakes
in the investigation.
<p>
   ``Because of this case, we've learned a lot of lessons about
crimes against the elderly,'' Lau said. ``It's a very complicated
case.''

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  A San Francisco lawyer who committed the
``colossal misdeed'' of offering to sell out his clients for $8
million to $10 million cannot re-enter the case from which he was
disqualified, an appellate court has ruled.
<p>
   Michael Khourie's disqualification from the class-action lawsuit
was exceptional for ``the magnitude of the ethical lapse,''
presiding Justice Anthony Kline wrote in his opinion for the state
1st District Court of Appeals.
<p>
   Khourie's misconduct ``shakes the foundations of (the judicial)
process'' and is ``a betrayal of his clients'' and public trust,
Kline wrote.
<p>
   Khourie, 74, a Mill Valley resident and an attorney in San
Francisco for more than 40 years, recently retired, keeping a
single client, the firm Cal Pak Delivery Inc. of Hayward.
<p>
   In 1993 Cal Pak sued United Parcel Service in a class action on
behalf of 150,000 intra-state shippers, alleging overcharges of $40
million and seeking exemplary damages.
<p>
   In January 1995, according to uncontested testimony, Khourie
contacted UPS vice president Edwin Reitman and at a face-to-face
meeting offered to dismiss the lawsuit in exchange for an
``up-front'' payment to him of a ``fee'' of $8 million to $10
million.
<p>
   Reitman rejected the proposal, which was accompanied by a threat
of more litigation. In April, 1995, UPS moved to disqualify Khourie
from the case, and a month later Superior Court Judge William
Cahill disqualified him.
<p>
   In brushing aside Khourie's objections to his disqualification,
Kline noted that ``had Khourie's scheme succeeded, his clients
would have been not just tactically disadvantaged but completely
undone.''
<p>
   Khourie's continued presence in the case ``after his colossal
misdeed would cast a shadow on future attempts'' to bring it to
trial, Kline wrote in the opinion, issued last week.
<p>
   In the court's opinion, Judge Cahill had no choice other than
disqualification because he faced ``a direct, acknowledged,
undisputed and indefensible betrayal by counsel of the interests of
his clients and the ... class.''
<p>
   Khourie's attorney, Michael Trayner, said Tuesday his client's
action was ``aberrational'' for a man who, throughout a long,
distinguished legal career, had been ``highly ethical.'' No
decision has been made whether to appeal, he said.
<p>
   In papers filed with the court, Khourie acknowledged making the
proposal to UPS and called it ``improper'' and ``a tragic
misadventure.'' Ill health, marital problems and loss of the annual
retainer from his old law firm probably contributed to his faulty
judgment, he said.

<p>
   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Cargill Financial Services
advised investors to reject a proposal to reschedule $80.4 million
of defaulted debt of the former Yugoslavia by the republics of
Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia.
<p>
   All three of these countries already have rescheduled the bulk
of their share of the defaulted debt inherited from Yugoslavia,
known as New Financing Agreement debt.
<p>
   Swiss Bank is now attempting to negotiate a settlement between
investors and the three republics for another type of former
Yugoslav debt known as Alternative Participation Instruments.
<p>
   The rescheduling would settle 53 percent of the debt.
<p>
   ``We feel that 53 percent of principal and accrued interest is
not a fair value for bondholders, particularly given that
bondholders would be releasing the most creditworthy republics from
further obligations,'' said Cargill spokesperson Laurie Johnson, in
Minneapolis.
<p>
   Cargill Financial Services is the brokerage arm of
Minneapolis-based trading company Cargill Inc.
<p>
   In an announcement published in the Financial Times, Cargill
asked holders of the debt to meet in New York on Feb. 7 or in
London on Feb. 10. ``Before agreeing to pursue the Swiss Bank
proposal, we believe API holders should meet to discuss what other
alternatives may exist,'' the announcement stated.
<p>
   Officials of Swiss Bank declined to comment for now, other than
to say that the debt being discussed amounts to about $80.4
million.
<p>
   Even while this debt remains in default, Slovenia and Croatia
have received investment-grade ratings from the credit companies.
Slovenia is rated ``A'' by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. and ``A3'' by
Moody's Investors Service, while Croatia last week received ratings
of ``BBB-'' from S&AMP;P and ``Baa3'' from Moody's.
<p>
   Slovenia and Croatia have rescheduled most of their shares of
former Yugoslav debt, and ``it is a question of time before
agreements with other creditors follow,'' said Helena Hassell, a
director with Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. in New York. ``This is
something that we are not concerned will affect the rating.''
<p>
   Slovenia re-entered international capital markets last June with
the sale of $325 million of five-year Eurobonds. Croatia is now
holding investor presentations for its first Eurobond sale
involving as much as $250 million of five-year bonds.
<p>
   ``Sure it's unusual'' for an investment-grade borrower to have
outstanding claims on defaulted debt, ``but the circumstances are
unusual as well,'' said Andrew Kenningham, a senior economist at
Merrill Lynch. ``There is no question about the willingness of
Slovenia and Croatia to pay their share, although there may be some
haggling to do over the amount.''
<p>
   In 1988, Yugoslavia reached an agreement to reschedule bank debt
into NFA debt. Creditor banks could choose not to take NFA debt and
instead receive 10-year bonds that paid a below-market interest
rate of 5.75 percent. Because it was structured as bonds rather
than loans, this debt was expected to be less vulnerable to another
default and rescheduling.
<p>
   Yugoslavia then splintered and civil war broke out. The country
stopped payments on all of its debt in April 1992.
<p>
   Last year, Slovenia rescheduled an 18 percent share of the NFA
debt, exchanging it for $820 million worth of floating-rate notes
maturing in 2006. Croatia settled its 29.5 percent share,
exchanging it for $1.46 billion of floating-rate notes. Macedonia
agreed to reschedule 5.4 percent, although the banks gave it some
concession on past-due interest.
<p>
   The remaining two successor republics of Yugoslavia --Bosnia and
the Republic of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia, Montenegro --
are still in default on their portions of the NFA debt.
<p>
   Swiss Bank's proposed rescheduling would settle about 53 percent
of principal and accrued interest for the three republics on about
the same terms that the NFA debt was settled, Cargill stated.
<p>
   ``We do not believe that this proposal represents an equitable
settlement,'' Cargill said in its announcement.

   Baltimore, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Baltimore Orioles signed
pitcher Scott Kamienecki to a minor league contract and invited him
to spring training.
<p>
   Kamienecki, 32, spent his entire six-year major league career

average last season.
<p>
   The right-hander began the season on the disabled list
recovering from surgery to remove bone chips in his pitching elbow.
<p>
   He's coming off a strong performance with Aragua in the
Venezuelan Winter League, going 4-2 with a 1.46 ERA in six starts.
He struck out 33 hitter in 37 innings.

   Over his six year-career in New York, Kamienecki was 36-39 with
a 4.33 ERA in 113 games.

<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney
Co.'s ABC television network must pay Food Lion Inc. $5.5 million
in punitive damages for having two news producers lie to get jobs
at the supermarket chain, a federal jury decided.
<p>
   The verdict stunned media lawyers, who said the successful
attack on a program that didn't libel anyone would spur similar
suits and reduce the number of hidden-camera investigations.
<p>
   ``People are going to think three or four times before they do
something like this,'' said Robert Sack, a libel defense lawyer for
Time Inc., the Wall Street Journal and Newsday. ``There are going
to be stories about health, safety and other possible misdeeds that
will never get out -- and no one will know that they never got
out.''
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and its ``PrimeTime Live'' program
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage for a 1992
expose on food handling at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   The producers faked resumes to get low-level Food Lion jobs
where they could report on and film the company's practices. One of
the producers hid a small camera in her wig. The program then
showed Food Lion employees rewrapping and displaying meat after
``sell-by'' dates had expired.
<p>
   Salisbury, North Carolina-based Food Lion claimed the report
cost it more than $2 billion in lost profit and stock value. U.S.
District Judge Carlton Tilley barred Food Lion from using the
content of the broadcast as evidence.
<p>
   The jury, which last week said it was deadlocked 11-1, spared
the two producers, directing two higher-ranking ABC executives to
pay a combined $45,750. ``PrimeTime'' executive Richard Kaplan was
told to pay $35,000 and Senior Producer Ira Rosen was ordered to
pay $10,750.
<p>
   The verdict is the latest in a series of court decisions aimed
not at the content of news reports but at newsgathering techniques.
Rulings in the past year have allowed juries to consider whether
reporters invaded the privacy of accident victims and barred a
camera crew from following the son of an executive at U.S.
Healthcare Inc.
<p>
   ``People are angry at people who gather the news and the way
they gather the news, even when it is in the public interest,''
said libel lawyer Sack.
<p>
   In the Food Lion case, the Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last
month awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the
salaries earned by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Sack predicted that the gap between the small compensatory
damages and the multimillion-dollar punitive award would prompt the
judge or the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reduce the amount
of punitive damages.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.
<p>
   Food Lion's Class A shares rose 3/16 to 9 1/4 in midday trading,
while Disney's slipped 1/8 to 69 5/8.

   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 7.7 percent after the
world's largest computer maker reported lower-than-expected sales
and earnings for the fourth quarter.
<p>
   IBM's stock fell 9 to 159 in midmorning trading of 5.96 million
shares. The stock accounted for 32 points of the 51.57 point drop
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Earlier, shares fell as low as
155. The stock had been trading at nine-year highs in the past few
weeks as investors were optimistic about the earnings.
<p>
   ``The stock had run up in expectation that the numbers would be
higher,'' said Phil Schettewi, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles &AMP;
Co., which owns IBM stock.
<p>
   IBM yesterday said fourth-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
slightly less than expected, as a stronger dollar and weak demand
in Europe hurt results.
<p>
   IBM said net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share,
from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales climbed 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion.
<p>
   Earnings were below the most recent estimate of $3.96 a share
from 15 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
had said they expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their earnings estimates for 1997.
IBM's Chief Financial Officer Richard Thoman said yesterday
continued weakness in memory chip prices and uncertainty about
currency could further hamper results.
<p>
   ``They are going to have a hard time doing an encore,'' said
industry analyst Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research in Phoenix. On a
constant currency basis, IBM said revenue rose 9 percent, its best
performance since 1985.
<p>
   IBM, like some other companies, was hurt by weak economies in
some European countries. Additionally, mainframe and workstation
sales were slow and falling memory-chip prices continued to hurt
results.
<p>
   Hardware sales edged up 2 percent to $11.7 billion, with
personal computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both
corporate products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales
declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' said
John Rutledge, an analyst Loomis, Sayles. ``The bloom is off the
rose.''

<p>
   Chatsworth, California, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Great Western
Financial Corp. fourth-quarter earnings fell 14 percent, as income
from mortgage loans plummeted and the bank boosted reserves for
lending losses.
<p>
   The nation's second-largest savings bank said earnings before
charges and gains fell to $85 million, or 58 cents a share, from
$98.6 million, or 66 cents, in the last three months of 1995. After
the charges and gains, the Chatsworth, California-based thrift
reported earnings of $5.13 million, or 1 cent a share.
<p>
   The results exceeded analysts' expectations of 56 cents a share,
according of a survey of 13 analysts by IBES International Inc.
Great Western shares rose 5/16 to 31 13/16 in midday trading.
<p>
   Net interest income fell 4.5 percent to $335.0 million, as
revenue from mortgage-backed securities fell. The thrift boosted
its provision for future lending losses by 71 percent to $85.9
million, cutting into profit.
<p>
   Noninterest income rose 7.2 percent to $114.1 million, as fees
from retail banking surged. Great Western had a pretax gain of
$23.0 million for the sale of its student lending business.
<p>
   Noninterest expenses rose 41 percent to $357.7 million, mainly
because of a $68.3 million pretax charge for a plan to cut 800 jobs
in a bid to reduce costs in the mortgage lending business.
<p>
   The thrift said it had a long way to go to revamp the mortgage
business, after real estate loans grew by $1.6 billion in the
quarter, about the same rate as in the fourth quarter of 1995.
<p>
   ``This level of mortgage originations is not satisfactory,''
said Chief Executive John Maher in a statement.
<p>
   Great Western, in a plan announced last month, is trying to
recover from a long slide in its mortgage business, that took the
thrift from being the fifth-largest U.S. mortgage bank to below No.
20.
<p>
   The company plans to cut 800 jobs, reduce the size of its
headquarters and replace antiquated systems this year. It already
has sold $300 million in non-performing home mortgages.
<p>
   The goal, a spokesman said, is to reduce the cost of making a
mortgage to $3,000 from $4,000. That, he said, should allow Great
Western to boost lending, regaining some of its lost market share.
<p>
   Great Western has $43.5 billion in assets and 1,150 mortgage and
consumer banking offices in California and Florida.

   Arlington, Virginia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- USAir Group Inc.
said its fourth-quarter profit declined 55 percent as the airline
continued to struggle with rising costs.
<p>
   Net income fell to $27.2 million, or 8 cents a share, from $60.3
million, or 61 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Results are
after payment of preferred dividends.
<p>
   The Arlington, Virginia-based airline's earnings were well-below
analysts expectations of 16 cents a share, based on the average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by IBES Inc.
<p>
   Shares of USAir fell 5/8 to 23 1/2 in early afternoon trading.
<p>
   Revenue rose to $2.05 billion from $1.85 billion
<p>
   USAir also said it will pay $50 million in dividends that it
owes to holders of its senior preferred stock.
<p>
   USAir suspended all dividend payments in 1990. Under accounting
practices, however, it must report earnings as if it were still
paying dividends.
<p>
   In the fourth quarter, USAir's total operating expenses rose to
$2 billion from $1.75 billion in the fourth quarter of 1995.

 &UR; FED'S REGIONAL SURVEY SEES `SCATTERED EVIDENCE' OF HIGHER WAGES &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy continues to
grow with low unemployment nudging labor costs higher, the Federal
Reserve said today.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for
higher wages in its latest regional economic survey, the central
still found no evidence of accelerating consumer prices outside of
energy.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published
eight times each year. The report will help form the basis for
discussion on interest rate targets at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the
Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
<p>
   While release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Washington
time, the report was inadvertently released ahead on schedule on
the Internet.
<p>
   In testimony yesterday to a Senate panel, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the U.S. economy remains strong with few signs of
immediate inflationary pressures even as an era of low wage gains
may be ending.
<p>
   ``The economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of
the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past
expansions,'' Greenspan said. ``By some important measures of price
trends, inflation actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   Economists interpreted Greenspan's comments as suggesting the
FOMC won't raise interest rates next month. Still, Greenspan left
the door ajar for action later if inflation accelerates because of
rising wage levels.
<p>
   The overall consumer price index rose 3.3 percent last year, the
largest increase since 1990. However, much of that came from an 8.6
percent rise in energy prices. Not counting food and energy, prices
rose only 2.6 percent, tying the 1994 rate for the lowest core
inflation rate in 30 years.
<p>
   In its last regional outlook Dec. 4, the Fed said the economy
growthing at a subdued pace with no sign of rising consumer prices.
That lack of an inflation threat allowed the central bank to
refrain from increasing interest rates at their last policy meeting
Dec. 17.
<p>
   Central bankers last cut the federal funds rate by a quarter
point at the Jan. 31 FOMC meeting, when many analysts were
predicting the U.S. economy was heading into a recession. That
followed identical quarter-point reductions in December and July
1995.

<TEXT>
<p>
   HOUSTON  &MD;  Mention the word ``crown'' to Chelsi Smith, and you're
likely to hear a loud groan.
<p>
   ``It was so heavy, it made a dent right here,'' the 23-year-old
says with a laugh, as she rubs the front of her head.
<p>
   By winning a triple crown of beauty pageants  &MD;  Miss Texas USA,
Miss USA and Miss Universe  &MD;  within a 10-month period two years
ago, Smith got used to wearing a tiara and glittery gowns.
<p>
   Now, though, the crown she wore as Miss Universe is packed away
in the back of a closet in her North Hollywood apartment along with
the memories of her life as a beauty queen.
<p>
   There are some who think that winning a beauty pageant is the
pinnacle of a person's life. Smith, who was selected over 81
contestants from around the world in Namibia, South Africa, in the
spring of 1995, is not one of those people.
<p>
   ``Miss Universe certainly wasn't a peak,'' she says. ``It was a
steppingstone.''
<p>
   Newly married to her longtime boyfriend, fitness trainer Kelly
Blair, she has left the beauty business behind and is pursuing a
career as a singer in Los Angeles.
<p>
   During a recent interview at her in-laws' home in the Houston
area, she expressed mixed feelings about pageant life. She said she
felt so relieved that her reign was over last spring that she did a
little dance in a corner of the stage after she crowned her
successor in Las Vegas.
<p>
   ``I was excited, because I wanted my life back,'' she says.
<p>
   Though she has some beefs about the pageant system, she admits
that ``I played the game to get where I needed to go.''
<p>
   As a child raised in the Houston suburb of Deer Park by her
grandmother, Smith seldom watched beauty pageants.
<p>
   After graduating from high school in 1991, she aspired to be a
singer and performed with a lounge band. She quit after several
months because she didn't like the travel and the smoky bars. She
enrolled at San Jacinto College with plans to become an elementary
school teacher.
<p>
   She entered her first real beauty pageant  &MD;  Miss Houston USA  &MD; 
in 1992 in hopes of earning money for college and to buy a car,
since her 1981 Toyota was on its last legs. She placed as first
runner-up and was hooked.
<p>
   Smith remembers a lot of good things about her reign as Miss
Universe.
<p>
   She traveled to 18 countries, met such luminaries as Hillary
Rodham Clinton and the princess of Thailand, and appeared on such
shows as the People's Choice Awards and Soul Train Awards.
<p>
   She sat next to Jack Nicholson at a movie screening and helped
build a house with former President Jimmy Carter and the Habitat
for Humanity group. She liked the perks of flying first class and
being met at airports with flowers and a limousine.
<p>
   But she became increasingly disenchanted with the life of a
beauty pageant winner.
<p>
   ``You're taken advantage of in a way, almost like a doll that
someone shapes and moves and tells to do this and that,'' she says.
``It gives you an identity crisis. You forget who you really are
and where you came from and why you are there.''
<p>
   Her year as Miss Universe was a lonely time, she says. She ran
up huge phone bills calling her fiance in Texas.
<p>
   She also missed having time to herself. She was chaperoned on
official duties and lived with pageant personnel in a Los Angeles
apartment. On her rare day off, she would escape up the California
coast and stay by herself in a hotel. In some foreign countries,
she found she was expected to be all-knowing.
<p>
   ``They would ask me how to solve the problems of overpopulation
and I'd think, `You've got to be kidding. I don't even own a house
yet.''' Her prize package, which is touted as more than a
half-million dollars, was an illusion, she says. The cash wasn't
enough to pay the taxes on the gifts, many of which she never used.
<p>
   Even the exposure that came from winning the crown has been, in
some ways, double-edged.
<p>
   When she embarked on an acting career after relinquishing the
crown, her agent told her to prepare two resumes  &MD;  one listing her
titles and one omitting them, because some Hollywood producers
assume that a former beauty queen can't think or act.
<p>
   When her acting career stalled, largely because of her
inexperience, she met a record producer because of her celebrity
status. Smith has signed with the Clockwork record label and hopes
to launch an easy-listening R&AMP;B singing career in the mold of Toni
Braxton and Vanessa Williams.
<p>
   She acknowledges it's an opportunity she never would have had if
she had remained in Deer Park. ``Even if it's just a pinky toe, I'd
rather have something in the door than absolutely nothing,'' she
says.

<p>
   New Orleans, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Green Bay Packers coach Mike
Holmgren is taking a page from the manual of Phil Jackson, who
frequently uses Zen Buddhist teachings to motivate his NBA champion
Chicago Bulls.
<p>
   Holmgren, who 10 years ago made a living as a high school
teacher, spoke philosophically about when his Super Bowl joyride
will end.
<p>
   ``I've been on a big wave and you can't get off the board
because you're going to hold on for dear life,'' Holmgren said.
<p>
   The game presents a sharp contrast in coaching styles. The New
England Patriots' Bill Parcells, the battle-tested veteran,
commands respect because of his two Super Bowl rings during his
eight-year tenure with the New York Giants.
<p>
   Holmgren, a Californian who is a former San Francisco 49ers
offensive coordinator, is an affable, easy-going leader.
<p>
   ``Those West Coast coaches tend to be labeled as more laid back
and player friendly,'' said Patriots tackle Bruce Armstrong.
``Parcells is considered more strict.''
<p>
   Yet there seems to have been a role reversal this week, when
Holmgren uncharacteristically imposed a 1:30 a.m. curfew on his
players. Parcells, meanwhile, set no curfew for his players until
later in the week.
<p>
   ``I think everyone in the organization is feeling very good
about what we've done,'' Holmgren said. ``But at the same time, we
want to finish the job.''
<p>
   Although his team is listed as a 14-point favorite, Holmgren
said Parcells gives the Patriots an advantage in coaching.
<p>
   ``I don't know about that,'' Parcells said. ``I know whose team
is the underdog. Ninety percent of the people don't think we have a
chance.''
<p>
   And those who do are banking on Parcells, widely considered the
best coach in the NFL. Not far behind is Holmgren, though, and
Parcells agrees with that.
<p>
   ``I think he's established himself as one of the premier coaches
in the league,'' Parcells said.
<p>
   While their styles and attitudes differ, the coaches share some
similarities. Both own two Super Bowl rings. Holmgren won his as an
assistant with the San Francisco 49ers. Parcells won his as head
coach of the New York Giants.
<p>
   Parcells refuses to wear his rings around his team, and he won't
say why. Holmgren displays his proudly, hoping it inspires his
players to win their own.
<p>
   ``The key thing with Mike is his ability to relate to people,''
said Packers General Manager Ron Wolf. ``He's an excellent teacher
and most importantly, he's a fine human being.''
<p>
   Wolf will get no argument from tight end Mark Chmura, who was
pondering retirement while on injured reserve last season because
of a back injury.
<p>
   ``He cared about me as a person, not only as a football
player,'' he said. ``He gave me the opportunity to let the back
heal and I'm thankful for that.''
<p>
   Had Holmgren turned his back on him, what would Chmura be doing
on Sunday?
<p>
   ``Rooting for the Patriots.''

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  After finally gaining credibility among
educators and garnering prestigious awards for its news
programming, Channel One television  &MD;  which beams news and
commercials into 12,000 of the nation's secondary schools  &MD;  is back
to being assailed as an ``advertising vehicle for a captive
audience.''
<p>
   Only 20 percent of Channel One's 12-minute air time is spent
covering recent political, economic, social and cultural stories,
according to a three-part study funded by the media watchdog group
Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. The other 80 percent is devoted
to advertising, sports, weather and natural disasters, according to
the study, which looked at 36 Channel One programs in 1995 and
1996.
<p>
   ``Channel One's `news' is no more than filler,'' Mark Crispin
Miller, a Johns Hopkins University professor, wrote in the study.
``Its real function is not journalistic but commercial, for it is
meant primarily to get us ready for the ads.''
<p>
   Channel One, which debuted in 1990 and drew immediate fire for
bringing commercials into the classroom, reaches about 8 million
American teenagers. In California, the telecast is delivered to 180
public, private and parochial schools.
<p>
   In return for broadcasting the Channel One program  &MD;  broken up
into 10 minutes of news briefs and 2 minutes of flashy, MTV-style
ads underwritten by companies such as Pepsi and Reebok  &MD; 
participating schools get free TV monitors for each classroom,
VCRs, satellite dishes and wiring. The hookup cost to Channel One
costs about $50,000. Ads run roughly $200,000 per 30-second spot.
<p>
   To executives at Channel One, the latest criticism is old and
inaccurate.
<p>
   ``The study is clearly not based on fact,'' bristled Claudia
Peters, executive vice president of network affairs for Channel One
Network, based in New York. Peters said Channel One spends $10
million a year on ``intensive news coverage,'' sending reporters to
hot spots such as Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Israel.
<p>
   ``Educators are clearly happy with what they're getting,''
Peters said. ``They are renewing Channel One in their classrooms at
a rate of 99 percent. Channel One programming has won over 100
educational and journalistic awards, including the George Foster
Peabody Award for our AIDS coverage.''
<p>
   A co-author of the study, Vassar College sociology Professor
William Hoynes, concluded the brightest aspect of Channel One is
its occasional in-depth look at teen issues such as drinking,
violence, pregnancy and relationships. He cautioned, however, that
the broadcaster tries to be a ``moral educator'' rather than an
objective news presence.
<p>
   The ads are a small price to pay compared to the benefits to
students, according to Elias Chamorro, principal of Overfelt High
School in San Jose, the first school in California to air Channel
One.
<p>
   ``Get by the commercials and look at the news content and it's a
very good thing,'' said Chamorro, who now works for the East Side
Union High School District. ``A lot of high school students don't
read the newspaper, so this was their news. It really helped to
keep them up on current events.''
<p>
   Under pressure from district officials, Chamorro said, Channel
One was discontinued at Overfelt last June. ``The kids liked it,
but no one was listening to the kids,'' said Chamorro, who is still
upset over the decision. ``It turned into a political issue.''
<p>
   But educators should never make a ``Faustian bargain'' with the
business community, argued Marianne Manilov, executive director of
the Center for Commercial-Free Public Education in Oakland.
<p>
   ``You can't just say, `I'll sell out a little,''' Manilov said.
``Selling school time is wrong. Period.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Panama received a ``junk'' bond
rating for its outstanding publicly-traded debt from Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., the country's first
rating.
<p>
   Moody's rated the bonds ``Ba1,'' the top level for high risk
debt, which is considered below investment-grade. Standard &AMP; Poor's
assigned Panama's debt a `BB+' rating.
<p>
   Panama's bonds surged 4.175 points or 5.6 percent on the news.
Panamanian interest-reduction bonds soared in morning trading to 76
5/8 bid and 77 1/8 offered.
<p>
   The ratings come a year after Panama and its creditors
restructured defaulted bank debt, restoring the nation's standing
as a potential international borrower. Panama now vaults to the top
tier of Latin American credits, a signal of investors' growing
confidence in the region. That trend helped emerging market bonds
to surge 36 percent in the past year.
<p>
   The ratings apply to a note sold by the government as well as
its $3.5 billion in outstanding Brady bonds created last year as
part of a restructuring accord, from old bank loans on which Panama
defaulted in the past decade.
<p>
   A ``manageable'' debt burden and progress toward an open economy
prompted Moody's rating, Managing Director for sovereign risk
Vincent Trugliea and Steven Hess, a senior analyst, said in a
report.
<p>
   ``The outlook for the Panamanian economy is for gradual
improvement.'' The rating wasn't higher because of ``the poor
record of repayment by the government during the past decade.''
<p>
   ``Economic reforms that are being implemented by the current
government should provide a basis for improved economic performance
over the next several years,'' Moody's report said.
<p>
   The changes include selling state firms, repealing labor
protection laws, removing import tariffs and beefing up regulation
of the financial industry, the credit rating company said.
<p>
   Moody's also highlighted Panama's growing maritime transport and
tourism industries, which are using land and facilities the U.S.
expects to hand over to Panamanian authorities in 1999. S&AMP;P said
its rating was constrained by Panama's high level of public debt,
low level of savings, ``high'' 14 percent unemployment and poor
federal tax collection system.
<p>
   The high-level junk rating, while lower than the
investment-grade rating some investors expected, is likely to lead
Panamanian bonds to appreciate from their present level, said
Stuart Parkinson, analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London.
<p>
   Moody's today also limited all future Panamanian bond issues,
public and private, to ratings no higher than a so-called
``ceiling'' of ``Baa1,'' which is three notches higher.
<p>
   The decision was uncommon, since a nation's foreign debt rating
and the national rating ceiling are usually the same. Moody's said
the use by private industry of the U.S. dollar, and the absence of
foreign exchange controls accounted for the difference.

   When Panama and its creditors agreed to restructure the past-due
debt principle and interest into Brady bonds -- named after a
former U.S. Treasury Secretary -- Panama regained its standing as a
potential borrower on the international bond market.
<p>
   Panama's Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, Guillermo
Chapman, said in a speech in New York recently that Pananma was
interested in seeking project financing to improve its
infrastructure.
<p>
   That's a change from last July, when Chapman told a gathering of
investors that the country had no reason to come to market
immediately.

A CHUCK-WAGON TASTE WITH LESS FAT AND SUGAR &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL; 
By ART CHAPMAN &QC;

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Every year, when chuck wagon cook Dennis Dodson came to the Fort
Worth Stock Show from his home in Poolville, Texas, it was like
walking down the aisles of a grocery store: a fat cow over there, a
juicy pig here, a little cabrito in the goat herd.
<p>
   But this year, Dodson's shopping list is a little leaner.
<p>
   At nearly 42, he has come up against a few health problems that
require a change in diet. It's nothing serious, he says, but he
intends to keep it that way.
<p>
   It is a difficult task for Dodson. His Rafter L Chuck Wagon
business is a booming one, with several large corporations as
clients. When they have their company parties, they expect Dodson
to show up with this steaks, potatoes, biscuits, gravy and cobbler.
<p>
   They don't want to know about heavy fat in the meat, or too much
sugar in the sweets. They want to kick back and have a good time
without worrying about a lecture in nutrition.
<p>
   Dodson is trying to balance their needs with his.
<p>
   ``I've got three kids,'' he said, ``and I'd kind of like to see
them graduate from high school, and then college. That's why I am
changing things.''
<p>
   Since October, Dodson and his wife, Jan, have been working on
their chuck-wagon menu, trying to duplicate their trademark taste,
without some of the fats and sugars.
<p>
   ``We used to do a horseradish sauce that was pure sour cream,''
said Dodson, citing an example. ``Now I use about two-thirds
low-fat yogurt and one-third low-fat sour cream. It still makes a
good steak sauce.''
<p>
   One of Dodson's signature dishes is his potatoes. In the past,
he boiled new potatoes, rolled them in butter, then stirred in sour
cream, ranch dressing, and topped them with bacon bits.
<p>
   ``It was straight cholesterol,'' he said with a laugh. ``We
wanted to change that, but we were really worried because the
potatoes were a dish that everybody liked and expected.''
<p>
   But he said he might have found a better way. He uses one part
sour cream mixed with three parts yogurt. He throws chopped parsley
in with the mixture and lets it all set overnight.
<p>
   Instead of butter, he uses a lower-fat margarine, and punches
the taste up just a little with a bit of lemon juice.
<p>
   ``We did have one lady tell us the taste was a little different,
but she liked it. When we told her what we had done, she wanted
seconds,'' he said.
<p>
   Most everyone asks for seconds on his cobblers, but those too
have been altered.
<p>
   Dodson has found the wonders of fresh fruit. The canned fruits,
he found, are usually coated with a sugary syrup that adds calories
to the cobbler, but not much taste.
<p>
   ``I use fresh fruit with very little sugar,'' he said. ``Where I
used to use 3 cups of sugar in a recipe, I now use maybe a
half-cup.''
<p>
   He has also cut back the sugar in his bread puddings. Dodson
makes his own bread, usually half-wheat flour and half-white. That
bread also goes into his pudding. Instead of using whole eggs, he
now mixes egg whites with EggBeaters. Instead of cream, he uses 1
percent milk.
<p>
   ``We use more raisins and fruits and less sugar,'' he said.
<p>
   Even the beans have been altered to fit Dodson's healthier
cooking style.
<p>
   ``I used to cook them with bacon fat or ham hocks,'' he said.
``I have found you can get better results by using the ham center
cuts. If someone gets a piece of that ham, it's just something
extra.
<p>
   ``They don't get the rind or the fat, but they do get the
flavor. I don't have grease sitting on top of my beans anymore.''
<p>
   The meats that Dodson uses are all hand-selected. He makes sure
the steaks, the roasts and the prime ribs are all trimmed of any
excess fats.
<p>
   All the changes, he said, have been accepted by his clients.
They might not always know they are eating healthier chuck-wagon
fare, but they do know they are getting a good meal in a friendly,
western setting.
<p>
   The menu alterations have been successful enough that Dodson is
now planning a new cookbook. Perhaps even a video.
<p>
   ``I'm really enjoying doing it,'' said Dodson, twirling his
waxed mustache. ``And I look at it this way: If I get to stay
around long enough to cook one more meal, then it's worth it.''

 &UR; THE REAL SUPER BOWL BEGINS BEFORE GAME: SPORTS BUSINESS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   New Orleans, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Forget about the Green Bay
Packers and the New England Patriots. The real Super Bowl begins
about 15 minutes into the pregame show with the first television
commercial.
<p>
   For the next several hours, viewers will be bombarded with
million-dollar pitches for snack foods, vacuum cleaners, credit
cards, pork and a new car called the Boxster.
<p>
   The Super Bowl has grown into one of the most expensive pieces
of marketing real estate in the U.S. The 29 minutes of ads during
the game will generate nearly $70 million for News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting Co. with another $10 million or so coming from the
pre- and postgame shows.
<p>
   Advertisers have lined up an impressive roster of pitchmen: Bob
Dole, Cindy Crawford, the late Fred Astaire, and numerous animated
characters.
<p>
   ``Super Bowl Sunday is the most eagerly anticipated day of
television advertising each year,'' said Carl Pascarella, president
and chief executive of Visa U.S.A.
<p>
   It wasn't always that way. The big change came when Apple
Computer Inc. aired its famous ``1984'' advertisement to show that
its Macintosh home computer would change the thinking of the world.
In the ad, which aired during the third quarter of the 1984 game, a
young woman burst into an auditorium of ashen-faced people staring
at someone talking on a giant screen and threw a battle hammer at
it, causing it to explode.
<p>
   When the computer was launched two days after the Super Bowl,
the inventory was sold out in just six hours.
<p>
   A marketing beast had been born. In the 1990s, according to
Competitive Media Reporting, some $425.2 million has been spent on
Super Bowl advertising time.
<p>
   Last year, NBC pulled in $86.8 million, with the San Francisco
49ers-San Diego Chargers showdown the season before generating
$90.7 million for ABC Sports.
<p>
   The firm found that from 1991 to 1996 PepsiCo Inc. spent $69.7
million -- about the equivalent of all of this year's game time
advertising -- pitching its products during Super Bowl contests.
Anheuser-Busch Cos. was a distant second at $49.6 million; Nike
Inc. was third at $19.3 million; McDonald's Corp. fourth at $16.6
million; and Chrysler Corp. fifth at $13.9 million.
<p>
   The basis for such spending is simple -- the Super Bowl delivers
an audience. This year, Fox is predicting some 43 million homes
will be tuned in.
<p>
   Rich Silverstein, of the San Francisco-based Goodby, Silverstein
&AMP; Partners, creators of this year's spots introducing Porsche AG's
Boxster, says it's more than numbers. The real value is ``the
husband and wife are watching together.''
<p>
   Visa is relying on the wit and humor of Dole, who unsuccessfully
ran for the presidency.
<p>
   ``To continue building Visa brand visibility...we needed to find
a captivating image,'' Pascarella said. ``Bob Dole is one of the
most intriguing and admired personalities in the world.''
<p>
   The 60-second commercial, created by BBDO New York, will
lightheartedly show Dole leading a parade in his Kansas hometown
and then running into some problems.
<p>
   Coca-Cola Co. jumps into the Super Bowl fray with a
geographically split television campaign -- a strategy several
advertisers are using.
<p>
   One part of the country will see two ads pitching a new citrus
drink called Surge while other regions will see spots for Diet
Coke. The company said the reason for the split is that Surge is
being launched only in some markets.
<p>
   The National Pork Producers, meanwhile, have spent almost its
entire 1997 ad budget for five spots -- four during the pre-game
show and one in the second quarter. The campaign shows a royal food
taster keeling over after eating pork. When everyone leaves the
room, the taster gets up and eats the remaining pork with a smile
on his face.
<p>
   Nike, the Beaverton, Oregon-based athletic shoe and apparel
maker, will air ``Li'l Penny's Super Bowl Party.'' In the spot, the
puppet version of NBA star Penny Hardaway throws a bash attended by
golfer Tiger Woods and supermodel Tyra Banks.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Cleveland-based Royal Appliance Manufacturing Co. is
relying on the game's becoming part of Americana to sell its Dirt
Devil vacuum cleaners.
<p>
   ``It has less to do with football than being a part of American
culture,'' said Deborah Holtkamp, Royal's advertising director.
``We feel it's worth this amount of money to launch a campaign on a
grand scale.''
<p>
   Royal also isn't relying on the sports star of the moment to
sell vacuum cleaners. It bought rights to dance sequences in two of
Astaire's films, then used computer graphics wizardry to put its
vacuum cleaners in his arms.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Panama received a ``junk'' bond
rating for its outstanding publicly-traded debt from Moody's
Investors Service and Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., the country's first
rating.
<p>
   Moody's rated the bonds ``Ba1,'' the top level for high risk
debt, which is considered below investment-grade. Standard &AMP; Poor's
assigned Panama's debt its equivalent `BB+' rating.
<p>
   Panama's bonds surged 4.175 points or 5.6 percent on the news.
Panamanian interest-reduction bonds soared to 76 5/8 bid and 77 1/8
offered.

investment-grade rating some investors expected, is likely to lead
Panamanian bonds to appreciate from their present level, said
Stuart Parkinson, analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London.
<p>
   The ratings come a year after Panama and its creditors
restructured defaulted bank debt, restoring the nation's standing
as a potential international borrower. Panama now vaults to the top
tier of Latin American credits, a signal of investors' growing
confidence in the region. That trend helped emerging market bonds
to surge 36 percent in the past year.
<p>
   The ratings apply to a note sold by the government as well as
its $3.5 billion in outstanding Brady bonds created last year as
part of a restructuring accord, from old bank loans on which Panama
defaulted in the past decade.
<p>
   A ``manageable'' debt burden and progress toward an open economy
prompted Moody's rating, Managing Director for sovereign risk
Vincent Trugliea and Steven Hess, a senior analyst, said in a
report.
<p>
   ``The outlook for the Panamanian economy is for gradual
improvement.'' The rating wasn't higher because of ``the poor
record of repayment by the government during the past decade.''
<p>
   ``Economic reforms that are being implemented by the current
government should provide a basis for improved economic performance
over the next several years,'' Moody's report said.
<p>
   The changes include selling state firms, repealing labor
protection laws, removing import tariffs and beefing up regulation
of the financial industry, the credit rating company said.
<p>
   Moody's also highlighted Panama's growing maritime transport and
tourism industries, which are using land and facilities the U.S.
expects to hand over to Panamanian authorities in 1999. S&AMP;P said
its rating was constrained by Panama's high level of public debt,
low level of savings, ``high'' 14 percent unemployment and poor
federal tax collection system. Moody's today also limited all
future Panamanian bond issues, public and private, to ratings no
higher than a so-called ``ceiling'' of ``Baa1,'' which is three
notches higher.
<p>
   The decision was uncommon, since a nation's foreign debt rating
and the national rating ceiling are usually the same. Moody's said
the use by private industry of the U.S. dollar, and the absence of
foreign exchange controls accounted for the difference.
<p>
   When Panama and its creditors agreed to restructure the past-due
debt principle and interest into Brady bonds -- named after a
former U.S. Treasury Secretary -- Panama regained its standing as a
potential borrower on the international bond market.
<p>
   Panama's Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, Guillermo
Chapman, said in a speech in New York recently that Pananma was
interested in seeking project financing to improve its
infrastructure.
<p>
   That's a change from last July, when Chapman told a gathering of
investors that the country had no reason to come to market
immediately.

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks fell, led by
state-controlled companies, amid concern that leading stocks
including Telecomunicacoes Brasilieras SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA
and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA are more expensive than
justified by prospects for corporate earnings.
<p>
   ``I'm surprised the fall isn't harder. I wouldn't buy these
stocks at these prices,'' said Sergio Blatyta, chief trader at
Banco Votorantim SA.
<p>
   The Bovespa index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange declined
250.75 points, or 0.3 percent, to 78,798.32, only the third decline
so far this year. In Rio de Janeiro, the IBV index fell 168 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 29,581.
<p>
   The federally controlled telephone company known as Telebras and
the federal utility called Eletrobras rose to all-time highs
yesterday, which oil company Petrobras reached on Tuesday.
<p>
   The companies have led an 11.5 percent rise this year in the
benchmark Bovespa index. The three stocks account for 69 percent of
the weight exchange officials assign to the Bovespa index.
<p>
   Telebras, Petrobras and Eletrobras rose on government plans to
sell state assets this year and to open the oil and
telecommunications industries to private investment.
<p>
   Shares also rose on expectations President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso will gain the right to seek re-election in 1998 and keep
his anti-inflation program on track. The government is trying to
amend the constitution so Cardoso can serve consecutive terms.
<p>
   Non-voting preferred shares in Telebras fell 30 centavos to 90.4
reais, Petrobras preferred fell 4.5 reais to 189 and Eletrobras
preferred fell 3 reais to 434.
<p>
   Petrochemical company Copene Petroquimica do Nordeste SA was one
of the day's biggest decliners, falling 4.2 percent to 345 reais.
Copene posted a fourth-quarter loss of 6.4 million reais after
production costs cut gross margin to 13 percent from 17 percent in
the third quarter, Votorantim said in a report.
<p>
   Among other decliners, Banco Bradesco SA fell 3.1 percent to
8.48 reais, white goods manufacturer Brasmotor SA fell 2.1 percent
to 278 reais and Telecomunicacoes de Parana SA fell 4.3 percent to
670.
<p>
   Santander Investment Securities initiated coverage on Bradesco
with a ``market perform'' recommendation, saying the bank is fairly
valued. Expectations the stock will climb 19 percent to 9.74 reais
in the next 12 months to 18 months is in line with expectations the
Bovespa index will rise 22 percent during the period, the bank
said.

   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan shares fell for a
second straight session as investors sold shares on concern that
future corporate earnings don't justify current stock valuations.
<p>
   Investors are also concerned about a possible strike at Cia.
Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, the national phone
company.
<p>
   ''Most of the sellers are locals, taking profits,'' said William
Boulton, a trader with Bancaracas Casa de Bolsa. ''There is also
some concern about the strikes but I think they will be settled.''
<p>
   The Caracas Stock Exchange's general index fell 48.21 points, or
0.8 percent, to 6317.16.
<p>
   Domestic investors continue to sell shares on concerns that a
December rally of more than 20 percent pushed prices of some shares
to a level that isn't warranted by their potential future earnings.
<p>
   At CANTV, the national phone company, workers are scheduled to
take a strike vote this afternoon. Workers are demanding a 140
percent raise, while the company is offering 20 percent.
<p>
   Benchmark CANTV fell 5 bolivars, or 0.3 percent, to 1,925
bolivars (US$4.04).
<p>
   Banco Provincial fell 13 bolivars, or 1.6 percent, to 807
bolivars, CA Electricidad de Caracas rose 4.50 bolivars, or 0.9
percent, to 485.50 bolivars, and Vencemos Type 1 shares fell 20
bolivars, or 1.6 percent, to 1,230 bolivars.
<p>
   All figures were preliminary.

   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. said it
plans to sell its Brittania Sportswear Ltd. discount clothing unit
to focus on its premium brands, Levi jeans, Dockers pants and
Slates dress pants.
<p>
   Brittania's casual wear is largely sold through discount chains,
such as Kmart Corp. and Dayton-Hudson Corp.'s Target stores. About
71 percent of Brittania's 1995 revenue was generated by its two
biggest customers, Levi's has said.
<p>
   ``Our core competency is premium apparel brands distributed
through premium channels. It's what we do best,'' said company
spokesman Brad Williams. He declined to value the unit.
<p>
   Based in Renton, Washington, Brittania employs about 120 people
to make jeans, leather goods and underwear. Levi bought the company
from Asian Pacific Industries in 1987.
<p>
   Closely held Levi Strauss, the world's largest maker of
brand-name clothing and the second-biggest maker of jeans in the
U.S., said it had $6.7 billion in sales in 1995. The company
employs about 37,500 people.

<p>
   Film: ``Prefontaine.''
<p>
   Writer/director: Steve James.
<p>
   Featuring: Jared Leto, Amy Locane, R. Lee Ermey, Ed O'Neill.
<p>
   Motion-picture rating: PG-13 (profanity and worse; portrayal of
drunkenness; mature themes; occasional violence).
<p>
   Grade: 2 on a scale of 5, on condition that this film does a
quick fade to home video. 
<p>
   ``Prefontaine'' may have wowed the opening-nighters at the
Sundance Film Festival, but when you take it out of movie-nut
territory and plunk it down at the shopping-mall multiplex, it's
just another ``inspiring'' and ``uplifting'' pseudo-documentary
about a gifted grandstander who cashed in too early.
<p>
   Coming from Steve James, the filmmaker responsible for that
excellent basketball documentary ``Hoop Dreams'' (1994),
``Prefontaine'' is a singular disappointment. It drags for the most
part and is hobbled by a lead actor (Jared Leto) whose glum
inexpressiveness is somehow supposed to pass for charismatic
arrogance.
<p>
   The running time approaches 2 hours but feels longer. Also, its
waste of such striking talents as Amy Locane and R. Lee Ermey is
near-criminal.
<p>
   Maybe it would work better as a TV program, but then they would
have to get rid of all that ugly language that is supposed to give
the film an ``edge'' of ``gritty realism.''
<p>
   Obviously, James finds fascination in everything that has to do
with Steve Prefontaine, the Oregon runner who wound up at the 1972
Munich Olympics. Prefontaine is introduced as an irritating kid, a
shrieking daredevil who grows up with a chip on his shoulder.
Simply put (per the movie version), Prefontaine wants to become a
track-and-field champ simply because he's NOT built for such events
but intends to beat the odds.
<p>
   He develops a confrontational friendship with a legendary coach
(Ermey), who will go on to invent a famous brand of running shoe.
He betrays a hometown girlfriend (Laurel Holloman) to gain a more
fashionable sweetheart (Locane). He is so disturbed by an outbreak
of terrorism at the Olympics that he loses his desire to run.
<p>
   Leto, of the late ABC series ``My So-Called Life,'' is pretty
much a one-note actor, so he doesn't register much more than a
blank stare. But we hear all about these developments via
dramatizations and in bogus interviews with actors playing the
``real'' people to whom all this stuff happened.
<p>
   There is already a Prefontaine documentary in circulation
(''Fire on the Track,'' a CBS network production) and it's an
impressive account. This feature-film retread might have been less
superfluous had James &AMP; Co. undertaken a true dramatization, rather
than cranking out this sentimentalized mock-documentary.

 &UR; MERRILL STARTS OFFERING INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR ONE ANNUAL FEE &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said it
started offering U.S. clients securities trading, mutual funds and
financial planning for one annual fee.
<p>
   Merrill introduced the new program, called Merrill Lynch
Financial Advantage Service, to some clients on a trial basis three
months ago.
<p>
   Clients who use the program won't pay brokerage commissions for
a limited number of trades and will get financial advice and price
reductions on other services such as margin loans and mortgages.
<p>
   ``The concept of Merrill Lynch Financial Advantage has caught
the attention of Wall Street and Main Street alike,'' said John L.
Steffens, head of Merrill's brokerage unit. ``Our pilot has been
the most successful introduction of a new service we've ever had.''
<p>
   Smith Barney, the nation's second-largest brokerage firm, began
offering a service similar to Financial Advantage this month. The
moves by Merrill and Smith Barney are designed to expand their
clients' investment choices and come as investors flock to
so-called fund supermarkets, which offer the choice of a variety of
mutual funds.
<p>
   Charles Schwab Corp. offered the first fund supermarket in 1992,
called OneSource, which now handles some $39 billion. OneSource's
success has spawned several imitations, including products from
Quick &AMP; Reilly Inc., Smith Barney and Fidelity Investments.
<p>
   Financial Advantage will boost Merrill's fee income at a time
when it and many of its Wall Street rivals want to decrease
reliance on volatile trading commissions and underwriting fees,
which rise and fall with swings in the stock and bond markets.
<p>
   Merrill now covers about 70 percent of its fixed expenses with
fees from asset management, investment banking and other services.,
and the firm wants to increase that percentage as much as possible,
Merrill executives say.
<p>
   Financial Advantage is designed for investors who may not trade
stock and bonds frequently, but have several brokerage or mutual
fund accounts and are interested in financial planning.
<p>
   Clients with between $100,000 and $250,000 in Merrill accounts
get 12 commission-free trades a year, a Merrill Visa card, an
analysis of retirement and college investments and access to the
firm's stock and bond research for a fee equal to 1.5 percent of
assets.
<p>
   As clients keep more money with Merrill, their fees go down and
commission-free trades and financial planning services increase.
Clients with more than $1 million in their Merrill account pay a
fee of 1 percent or lower, receive between 50 and 75 free trades
and expanded financial planning.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
International Business Machines Corp.'s weaker-than-expected profit
dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower.
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Dean Witter Discover Co. added
surprisingly strong earnings announcements to this week's pile of
profit reports, helping broader averages set records for a fifth
straight session.
<p>
   Half the loss in the Dow industrials, down 38.49 to 6845.41,
came from IBM. The world's largest computer maker sank 9 5/8 to 159
3/4.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
<p>
   Still, ``I don't the market's overvalued in the context of all
of the positives,'' he said. ``You have declining interest rates;
corporate America's become more profitable and more competitive.
We're in an hospitable environment.''
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which comprises 75
percent of the market capitalization of U.S. stocks, gained 2.41 to
785.13, as gains in Johnson &AMP; Johnson, General Electric Co. and
Intel Corp. offset IBM's decline. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which
includes many computer stocks, gained 10.30 to 1387.27, led by
Microsoft Corp. for a third day.
<p>
   Mutual fund inflows continued to boost shares. Mutual Fund Trim
Tabs, a newsletter that tracks money going to mutual funds, said
assets are pouring in at a $28.4 billion monthly pace, $500 million
short of the record set last January.
<p>
   ``You're having tremendous demand for stocks,'' said Philip
Brown, president of Meridian Investment Co., with $3.7 billion in
equities. ``You have an economy that isn't doing that bad.
Corporate profits aren't declining -- they just aren't going to be
up as much.''
<p>
   Fourth-quarter profit growth of 18 percent couldn't support IBM
shares, which had risen 66 percent in the year up to the report
released after the market's close yesterday. A stronger dollar and
weak demand in Europe hurt the bottom line. Net income for the
computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3 cents below analysts'
expectations.
<p>
   On the heels of surprisingly good numbers from Intel and
Microsoft, other computer makers held up amid IBM's retreat.
<p>
   Digital Equipment Corp. rose 1/4 to 35. Electronic Data Systems
Inc., a primary competitor for IBM's lucrative computer services
business, gained 3/8 to 47 7/8. Microsoft rose 2 to a record 97 and
Intel jumped 3 15/16 to 152, a peak as well.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, a senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at the No. 1 maker of personal
computers, Compaq. The Houston-based computer maker said earnings
gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing expectations by 11
cents. Compaq jumped 5 5/8 to 84 1/8.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, also topping forecasts. Its
shares gained 7/8 to 38.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a share, 2 cents
above analysts' expectations, according to IBES International Inc.
The shares fell 1/8 to 121 1/2, after gaining 12 percent from the
start of the year to yesterday.
<p>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson jumped 3 3/8 to a record 56 7/8 after gaining
2 1/2 yesterday. The health-care product company said earnings rose
20 percent before trading began yesterday. Its shares have risen 31
percent in the past year.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's fell 7/8 to
38 1/2.
<p>
   Steris Corp. sank after Bill Sanford, the company's chairman and
chief executive, told Dow Jones he expects the medical device
company to earn 38 cents a share in the fiscal third quarter, below
analysts' average expectation of 53 cents, according to IBES.
<p>
   Norand Corp., a maker of mobile computers, surged 13 1/2 to 32
7/8 after Western Atlas said it would pay $261.3 million, or $33.50
a share in cash, for all of Norand's 7.8 million shares. Western
Atlas fell 3 1/4 to 68 7/8.
<p>
   Stocks were neither helped nor hurt by bonds, which were little
changed as investors looked past a report showing a drop in hew
home starts and fretted about demand at the Treasury's sale of
$17.5 billion in two-year notes. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond, used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, rose 1
basis point to 6.79 percent.
<p>
   Still, with the Dow industrials up 6 percent already this year,
``investors are more sensitive to news that's unfavorable than news
that's favorable,'' said Philip Roth, chief technical analyst at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

   Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Viacom Inc.'s
Blockbuster Entertainment unit said it began construction on a
Texas distribution center for its video, music and other products
in North America.
<p>
   The 800,000-square-foot center will be built on 65 acres about
25 miles northeast of Dallas, where Blockbuster is moving its
headquarters from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The company expects the
center to open in the fall and employ 800 people.
<p>
   Blockbuster currently distributes its products to more than
4,000 stores in the United States and Canada from two centers in
Garland and Dallas, Texas. Blockbuster said it offered employment
at the new center to workers at its two distribution centers.
<p>
   Blockbuster plans to open 700 additional domestic stores this
year. The company earlier this month said it will close 50
Blockbuster Music stores because of sluggish sales.

   Storrs, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The suspension of
University of Connecticut basketball players Ricky Moore and Kirk
King will extend at least through tonight's game against Miami.
<p>
   School officials continue to await the NCAA's final report on an
investigation into allegations that the players accepted airline
tickets from an agent.
<p>
   The school declared Moore and King ineligible last Thursday and
said it was conducting an internal investigation into the
allegations. School officials then forwarded their findings to the
NCAA for review.
<p>
   NCAA spokesman Bill Saum said the eligibility committee has
already reviewed the school's report and reached a decision on when
and under what conditions Moore and King could return.
<p>
   He said the NCAA report will be forwarded to UConn officials
``today or tomorrow.'' The school will then have a chance to review
the decision, then make a public announcement.
<p>
   The school wouldn't comment if it had received the report and no
press conference has been scheduled.
<p>
   Saum wouldn't disclose details of the decision, saying only that
the two players wouldn't be allowed to play tonight when the
Huskies travel to Miami.
<p>
   Without two of their most experienced players, the Huskies were
beaten by top-ranked Kansas 73-65 on Sunday.
<p>
   The 6-foot-8, 240-pound King, a senior captain, is the team's
starting center. He is averaging 7.6 rebounds a game. The 6-foot-2
Moore, a sophomore, averages 6.5 assists, second-best in the Big
East.
<p>
   UConn has become one of the nation's most prominent basketball
programs the past 11 years under coach Jim Calhoun. Since his
arrival in 1986, the Huskies have gone 226-101 and won the past
three regular-season Big East championships.
<p>
   The team rose to its first-ever No. 1 ranking in 1995, as did
the women's team, then lost in the round of 16 of the NCAA
tournament.
<p>
   This year's team is unranked and stands 11-4 overall, including
a 4-2 mark in the conference.
<p>
   Connecticut has produced several NBA players, including Ray
Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks, Cliff Robinson of the Portland Trail
Blazers and Donyell Marshall of the Golden State Warriors.

PACKERS' BROWN HAS BEEN A HUGE FACTOR &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  You may not hear much about Gilbert Brown, but you
can't ignore him. He's simply too big. One of the many problems the
Patriots will have Sunday is how do you move a human grand piano?
<p>
   ``You can't,'' said Green Bay guard Adam Timmerman. ``I know. I
play against him every day. Not only is he as big as a piano, he's
as hard to move as one. And as much fun, too.''
<p>
   Brown, a defensive tackle, got the ultimate honor Tuesday at
media day: his own podium. He was right there next to receiver Don
Beebe on the floor of the Superdome, handling questions the same
way he shucks offensive linemen.
<p>
   Brown is Thomas Hamilton big, tipping the scales at well over
300 pounds (he wouldn't say how much Tuesday, but he's listed at
325). His girth was believed to be a big reason for injuries that
hindered his development and led to his release by the Minnesota
Vikings.
<p>
   ``Things happened. They were probably my fault,'' he said.
``I've moved on. Let's leave it at that. I'm happy.''
<p>
   In 1996, he was still large but he also was healthy. The result
was 16 starts, 52 tackles (most on the defensive line) and a
well-earned reputation as an immovable force in the trenches.
<p>
   The Patriots know this. Teams frequently have had to put two men
on Brown simply to contain him, leaving single coverage on pass
rushers Reggie White and Sean Jones. But sometimes even that
doesn't work. Not only is Brown big and strong, he's also, for his
size, athletic. He was, after all, a sprinter in high school,
something that today seems implausible.
<p>
   ``There are few and far between like Gilbert,'' said Patriots
center Dave Wohlabaugh. ``He may be overshadowed along that front
line by other guys, but he's a big part of their success. He takes
on double-teams. He's a run-stopper. He sheds blocks. And he has
amazing lateral quickness. That's what impresses me the most.''
<p>
   So, in the words of Sidney Greenstreet, how did the Packers
manage to land such a leviathan? Simple. They had Brown on their
draft board when he came out of the University of Kansas in 1993
and claimed him on waivers prior to the start of the '93 season
after the Vikings, who drafted him in the third round, let him go.
<p>
   Maybe coach Mike Holmgren and general manager Ron Wolf knew what
they were getting. If they did, it has been delayed gratification,
for Brown was hurt his first two seasons in Green Bay before
finally taking over a starting role last season. Then came this
season and the Packers' pigskin pooh-bahs again look like geniuses.
<p>
   ``The Minnesota style of defense is different from ours and is
more pass-rush oriented,'' Holmgren said. ``Gilbert is good, but
he's not that kind of a player. When he became available, we felt
we had to look at him. I think we hit on one.''
<p>
   The only downside, Holmgren admitted, has been the weight. ``I
try not to let him go home (to Detroit) because his mom is such a
good cook,'' the coach said. ``But this year, he has done a nice
job of managing his weight. I mean, he's never going to be thin.''
<p>
   Said Brown, ``My mom feeds all of us (five children) well.
That's why I am the way I am today. People are amazed at how big I
am. I tell them, that may be, but you don't know what you're
missing. My mom cooks just about everything. Peppery steaks, fried
chicken. What she cooks is so good that I just have to taste it.''
<p>
   But beneath all the ectoplasm is someone who helped make the
Packers' defense No. 1 in the NFL, particularly against the run. In
Green Bay's two playoff games, Brown was, well, big. He had four
tackles and deflected a pass against the 49ers. Against the
Panthers, he had two tackles and forced a fumble. San Francisco's
Terry Kirby and Carolina's Anthony Johnson combined for 45 rushing
yards in those games.
<p>
   ``Down there, in the trenches, that's where the men play,''
Brown said. ``That's the man's game. You've got everyone coming at
you. I like playing nose tackle. It's my home.''
<p>
   And so is Green Bay, for now. By sheer coincidence, Brown's
breakthrough season also came on the last year of his contract. His
agent is seeking a deal in the range of $2-2.5 million a year, but
Brown says Patriots, not greenbacks, are on his mind this week,
even moreso than food.
<p>
   ``I'll worry about that down the road,'' Brown said of his
contract. ``Right now, all I'm concerned about is the game at hand.
Everything else can wait.''

   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A trust for the controlling
family of the New York Times Co. added a trustee, bringing a new
generation into the group of septuagenarians who oversee the trust
and guide the family's media empire.
<p>
   Lynn Dolnick, 45, was chosen in December from among a crowd of
young heirs to serve on the board of trustees. A filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission today said the family's 1986
trust agreement was changed last month so Dolnick could be added to
a group that includes the company's chairman and chief executive,
the 70-year-old Arthur `Punch' Sulzberger Sr., and his three older
sisters. Dolnick is a niece of Sulzberger.
<p>
   ``It's just to start getting the next generation involved in
matters,'' said the trust's lawyer in explaining the change.
<p>
   The choice places on the board a person outside the media
business as Dolnick works for the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.,
where she is chief of the Exhibition Interpretation division,
according to the SEC filing.
<p>
   Nonetheless, Dolnick may know something about the industry by
proxy as her mother, Ruth Holmberg, publishes the family's
Chattanooga Times newspaper in Tennessee. Holmberg, one of
Sulzberger's three sisters, also serves as a trustee.
<p>
   Marian Heiskell and Dr. Judith Sulzberger are also trustees, and
the Sulzberger family exercises almost full control over the
company by virtue of its non-trading Class B share holdings.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  And on the third day, they talked. That would be
the Patriot assistant coaches, of course, who were allowed by NFL
mandate to speak to the media Tuesday. It took four years of
silence and a Super Bowl appearance to lift Bill Parcells' gag
order.
<p>
   Foremost among the speakers at Super Bowl Media Day was
offensive coordinator Ray Perkins.
<p>
   Now, depending on your loyalties  &MD;  as well as the number of
points scored by the Patriot offense  &MD;  Perkins is either very good
or very bad at his job.
<p>
   The critics suggested that Perkins was at fault early in the
season when the Patriots were struggling offensively, and that
either quarterbacks coach Chris Palmer or Parcells himself deserved
the credit when the team started scoring almost at will.
<p>
   So, naturally, some reporters, with four years of questions
stored in their memory banks, began Tuesday's chat by asking him
whether he was a genius or clueless.
<p>
   ``Probably neither,'' said Perkins, with a laugh.
<p>
   He said he didn't mind the code of silence imposed by Parcells.
<p>
   ``It's probably better that way,'' said Perkins, who as head
coach of the New York Giants from 1979-82 hired a couple of
assistants named Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick. ``You want to
have one voice on your club, and that should be the head coach.''
<p>
   Perkins, who may be out of a job if Parcells does decide to quit
the Patriots after the Super Bowl, would like to be a head coach
again.
<p>
   ``But nobody has called,'' he said, ``and I'm not the type of
person who goes around and applies for jobs. Football has been a
big part of my life. I'd still like to stay in it. It's been a good
run.''
<p>
   Perkins, who also was head coach at Tampa Bay from 1987-90, said
his relationship with Parcells is more professional than personal,
although they have known each other for almost 20 years.
<p>
   ``It's more like a head coach/assistant coach (relationship)
than anything else,'' he said.
<p>
   The offense the Patriots are running is a derivative of the one
used by the Baltimore Colts when Perkins was a wide receiver for
them from 1967-72.
<p>
   ``The key to success for an offense,'' he said, ``is to fit it
to what the players do best and take advantage of their
abilities.''
<p>
   For almost an hour, Perkins sat in the stands and answered
questions about the past, present and future.
<p>
   He was asked how it felt to be vilified when the Patriots were
struggling.
<p>
   ``I don't feel I have to defend myself to anyone,'' he said. ``I
know what my responsibilities are.''
<p>
   And then it was time to go. Time to move back into the shadow
world where Parcells keeps his assistant coaches.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  It was the 99th time the hook was tossed over the
yellow police tape (``Caution,'' read the tape, most aptly) that
separated Bill Belichick from the rear flank of the media hordes
Tuesday at the Superdome.
<p>
   ``Do you know Al?'' was the bait this time. ``Do you know Al
Davis personally?''
<p>
   Belichick would not bite. A little bob and a slight feint toward
the bait, but the Patriot assistant head coach merely swam right on
by.
<p>
   ``Well, I know he's not with the Packers, and I know he's not
with the Patriots,'' replied Belichick, ``so right now all I'm
concerned with is who's on the Packers and who's on the Patriots.''
<p>
   Belichick is expected to have an interview with Davis, owner of
the Oakland Raiders, early next week for the vacant coaching job.
Indeed, Belichick is considered one of the leading candidates for
Oakland.
<p>
   ``Of course I know Al,'' Belichick finally relented. ``I've been
in the league 21 years and there's probably not too many people in
the league that I don't know.''
<p>
   But, until Tuesday, New England fans knew next to nothing about
Belichick, even though he has been with the Patriots 11 months and
once was head coach of the Cleveland Browns. On the first day the
Patriot assistants were allowed to talk to the media, Belichick
showed that he has changed little from Cleveland, where he used few
words, and used them cautiously.
<p>
   Writers from Cleveland drew straws to determine who would have
to do the obligatory story about the coach who sent Bernie Kosar
packing from Cleveland and started the untested Todd Philcox at
quarterback. Belichick gave them little.
<p>
   ``Right now I'm here to focus on the Green Bay Packers and the
Super Bowl,'' replied Belichick, when asked his emotional take on
his  &MD;  and the Browns'  &MD;  demise in Cleveland. ``That's what I'm here
to talk about, not last year, not next year and not 1983.''
<p>
   Writers from Oakland and San Francisco did their duty and asked
question after question about Belichick's plans. Other writers were
intrigued to see whether they could learn how the move from head
coach to assistant coach had affected Belichick, a longtime friend
of Bill Parcells.
<p>
   ``You take what you learn and you try to be better prepared for
the next situation if it comes up,'' replied Belichick. ``That's my
agenda now  &MD;  not to deal with what happened last year (in
Cleveland) or what's going to happen next year. I'm sure there's
going to be a time and a place for that.''
<p>
   But not here and not now, not on the floor of the Superdome days
before the Super Bowl. His one and only concern now, said
Belichick, is the Patriots vs. the Packers. But questioners
questioned. What did he learn from the Cleveland experience?
<p>
   ``You always learn things, but my attitude now is to try and
contribute as much as I could to the Patriots' football team,'' he
replied, still escaping the lure. ``That's been my goal and I've
tried to benefit the team as much as I possibly could.''
<p>
   Which Belichick certainly has done. The New England defense  &MD; 
especially the secondary that Belichick coaches  &MD;  has suddenly
meshed and, as Belichick himself put it, ``is playing with a lot of
confidence.'' That crew will be facing the NFL's top offense and,
as Belichick put it, ``We know we're the big underdogs, so I guess
we'll try to slap something together and see if we can be
competitive.''
<p>
   So it went for nearly an hour, Belichick shedding little light
on any subject. Even to New England writers, who at this late date
wanted to know the most basic of answers  &MD;  just who does call the
team's defensive signals, Belichick or Al Groh?  &MD;  the information
was bare-boned.
<p>
   Belichick sits in the press box and sends his input down to Groh
on the field. Groh, in turn, sends the defensive signals onto the
field. But, as both Belichick and Groh put it, the two are so
similar in their philosophies and know each other's minds so well
that rarely is there a disagreement. In those rare cases when
``there is an either-or call,'' as Groh put it, Groh makes the
call.
<p>
   ``It's probably much the same way it was when we were all
coaching in New York (with the Giants),'' explained Belichick.
``Romeo (Crennel) is the defensive line coach, Al coaches the
linebackers and I coach the secondary. We all work together and we
know what we have to do.''
<p>
   And Groh makes the calls?
<p>
   ``We work together as a staff on that,'' replied Belichick. ``We
know what we're going to do in certain situations. Al's down on the
field signaling the defense and I'm upstairs. I pick up tendencies
(of the opposing offense) up in the press box and make sure we're
doing the right thing defensively. Al and I give feedback to each
other on what's happening.''
<p>
   In most football cities, all these details of structure and
communication are known by the fifth day of training camp. With the
Patriots and their silent coaching staff, however, such details
remain vague to the team's fans, even a scant few days from the
Super Bowl.
<p>
   Even more vague to the fans, though, are the personalities and
styles of these hitherto-anonymous assistants. Belichick, for
instance, deflects all praise for the vast improvement in the
Patriots' defense, saying only, ``Most of it is due to the players
being more comfortable with the system, and understanding their
role and what they need to do, and gaining the confidence of when
they do it the way it's designed, it's going to work.''
<p>
   So it went: many questions, much bait tossed toward Belichick
and few nibbles. Typical was the question about Parcells' uncertain
status being a topic of conversation in the coaches' locker room,
since it will affect all the assistants' jobs next week, too. How
much of a topic is it?
<p>
   ``I'd say it's been minor,'' he replied. ``I'd say much of our
talk has been about Keith Jackson, Mark Chmura, Antonio Freeman,
Brett Favre, Dorsey Levens, guys like that.''
<p>
   So the media came from Belichick's past homes in Cleveland and
New York, from his present home in New England and possibly his
future home in Oakland, and the conclusions of most seemed similar
after listening to Belichick. Still a stranger in our midst.

   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy continues to
grow with low unemployment nudging labor costs higher, the Federal
Reserve said today.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for
higher wages in its latest regional economic survey, the central
bank still found no evidence of accelerating consumer prices
outside of energy.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published
eight times each year. The report will help form the basis for
discussion on interest rate targets at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the
Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
<p>
   ``Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in
most parts of the country,'' the Fed said in its report. ``Holiday
sales were in line with retailers' expectations of moderate growth.
Manufacturing activity continued to grow, with significant strength
coming from capital equipment and materials manufacturers.''
<p>
   The report is likely to be ``comforting'' for investors, said
James Padinha, an economist at MMS International in San Francisco,
because it doesn't point to wage pressures or other worrisome signs
of inflation. Still, he said, ``if anything, the report is
understating the potential for accelerated growth.''
<p>
   In financial markets, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was
little changed after release of the survey. The bond rose 1/16,
pushing down the yield less than a basis point to 6.78 percent.
<p>
   The latest Fed regional survey is in line with recent comments
from Fed officials. In testimony yesterday to a Senate panel, Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economy remains strong with
few signs of immediate inflationary pressures even as an era of low
wage gains may be ending.
<p>
   The survey was prepared by the San Francisco Federal Reserve
Bank, based on information gathered in December and early January.
<p>
   In the Fed's New York district, the economy had a ``slightly
firmer tone than in the last report, while price pressures remain
subdued,'' the Fed said. Major retailers in the New York area said
holiday-season and post-holiday sales were ``on or above plan.''
<p>
   In the Boston area, meanwhile, the economy ``continues to expand
at a moderate pace,'' the Fed said. Retailers in that area said
holiday sales were ``modestly higher than a year earlier and mostly
in line with their expectations.''
<p>
   In the Kansas City area, rising job creation is beginning to put
upward pressure on wat &QC; 5Q!%9 &QC; % %1M!Y 9warning about as a risk to
the nation's inflation outlook.
``Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, leading
some firms to increase wages,'' the Fed said. In Kansas City, the
economy ``continued to grow moderately the past month, while
showing a few signs of slowing,'' the Fed said. ``Manufacturing
activity remained fairly strong.'' Also in the area, retail sales
during the holidays were ``somewhat less than expected,'' while
construction activity ``edged downward.'' &HT;    While release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Washington
time, the report was inadvertently released at 12:10 p.m.
Washington time on the Internet.
<p>
   In his testimony yesterday, Greenspan said, ``the economy has
retained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and
inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions.'' He
added: ``By some important measures of price trends, inflation
actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   Economists interpreted Greenspan's comments as suggesting the
FOMC won't raise interest rates next month. Still, Greenspan left
the door ajar for action later if inflation accelerates because of
rising wage levels.
<p>
   The overall consumer price index rose 3.3 percent last year, the
largest increase since 1990. However, much of that came from an 8.6
percent rise in energy prices. Not counting food and energy, prices
rose only 2.6 percent, tying the 1994 rate for the lowest core
inflation rate in 30 years.
<p>
   In its last regional outlook Dec. 4, the Fed said the economy
growing at a subdued pace with no sign of rising consumer prices.
That lack of an inflation threat allowed the central bank to
refrain from increasing interest rates at their last policy meeting
Dec. 17.
<p>
   Central bankers last cut the federal funds rate by a quarter
point at the Jan. 31 FOMC meeting, when many analysts were
predicting the U.S. economy was heading into a recession. That
followed identical quarter-point reductions in December and July
1995.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The highest-ranking U.S. diplomatic official in
Taiwan abruptly resigned his post last week, as federal
investigators investigated a possible role in soliciting Democratic
campaign contributions from Taiwanese businessmen, officials said
Tuesday.
<p>
   James Wood, a former Arkansas lawyer and Clinton appointee, left
his post shortly after federal agents searched his offices in
Virginia and Taipei, reviewing documents and other paperwork, a
source familiar with the investigation told the Globe.
<p>
   Wood had virtually no foreign policy experience when President
Clinton named him to the post in 1995. Since then, he has been
derided by followers of the U.S. diplomatic corps for his handling
of Taiwan-U.S. relations, and criticized further amid more recent
allegations that he played an important role in raising Asian money
for Clinton's reelection campaign.
<p>
   The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, confirmed
Tuesday that Wood had resigned as of last Friday. ``His resignation
has been accepted,'' Burns said.
<p>
   Wood officially served as the chairman of the American Institute
in Taiwan. The U.S. United States does not officially recognize
Taiwan, and thus does not have an embassy or ambassador in Taipei.
The American Institute, a federally funded, nonprofit corporation
that operates under the authority of the U.S. secretary of state,
serves as the primary diplomatic channel to Taipei and functions
like embassies in other capitals, with its chairman serving as an
unofficial U.S. ambassador. Wood split his time between the
institute's offices in Virginia and Taiwan.
<p>
   A woman who answered the telephone at the institute's suburban
Virginia office said, ``I'll transfer you to his former
secretary.'' When the person answered, she said, ``I don't know how
to reach him.''
<p>
   The FBI began investigating Wood last fall, according to the
source knowledgeable about the inquiry. In October, Newsweek
magazine reported that senior Taiwanese officials had complained
that Wood was pressuring Taiwanese businessmen for contributions to
Clinton's reelection campaign.
<p>
   The magazine reported that Wood had told business executives
that Clinton deserved to be ``rewarded'' for granting a U.S.
visitor's visa to President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, then steered
potential contributors to John Huang, who traveled to Taiwan
periodically while raising funds for the Democratic National
Committee.
<p>
   Huang's activities on behalf of the DNC have stirred intense
controversy over Democratic fund-raising last year. The entire
issue is under review by Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
<p>
   In his only public comments to date, Wood, asked if he urged
Taiwanese businessmen to give money to Huang, told Newsweek, ``That
could have happened.'' But, he added, he ``couldn't recall.''
<p>
   Tuesday, analysts welcomed Wood's resignation as a boon to U.S.
policy in Asia. Many followers of U.S. Asian policy noted that Wood
was the first appointment to that post who had no ability to speak
the language. Those who came before him, analysts said, were senior
members of the U.S. diplomatic corps schooled in Asian policy.
<p>
   Other critics maintained that Wood had lied to members of
Congress after his appointment by saying he had helped create the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Wood's critics said U.S. officials
involved in the measure had never heard of him.
<p>
   Harvey Feldman, a Heritage Foundation analyst and a former State
Department official under Jimmy Carter who helped shape the Taiwan
Relations Act, said Wood had misled senators in 1995 when he told
them he was one of the authors of the Taiwan law.
<p>
   ``I and others pointed out that he was making claims for which
he was not entitled,'' Feldman said. ``As far as anyone was aware
in senior positions at the time, until he surfaced ... we had never
heard of him.''
<p>
   ``There is very little good to say,'' added Steve Yates, another
Heritage Foundation analyst. ``He was one of the most clearly
political appointments made in the foreign realm. He had extremely
little background.''
<p>
   The position of chairman of the American Institute does not
require Senate confirmation, officials said. The Senate is
consulted on the nominee, and individual senators are free to raise
objections. Apparently, no senator raised significant objections.
<p>
   But soon after Wood took his post, members of the diplomatic
corps expressed displeasure, particularly in light of the
sometimes-strained relations between the United States and China.
<p>
   ``There was a lot of doubt among people who are familiar with
U.S.-Taiwan-People's Republic of China relations,'' said Ralph
Klough of the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns
Hopkins in Washington. ``He hadn't had a lot of experience to deal
with this situation. His predecessors had been foreign service
officers with a lot of experience. They were very senior people.''

<p>
   ARLINGTON, Va.  &MD;  During her sophomore year at Harvard, Hafsat
Abiola designed her own major. She wanted to combine her interests
in economics, politics and history so she could study her homeland,
Nigeria, from a distance.
<p>
   The more she researched, she knew, the more she would learn
about Nigeria's horrors, including military coups, human rights
abuses and political assassinations.
<p>
   But she had no inkling that the most devastating lessons would
soon involve her own family.
<p>
   In 1993, just before Abiola started her junior year, her father,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, was elected president of Nigeria. Six months
later, when he tried to assume power, the military annulled the
election and jailed him. He was thrown into solitary confinement,
unable to see a lawyer, send letters or read a newspaper. He
remains in prison, and his family has no idea how he's doing.
<p>
   And last summer, as Abiola's mother, Kudirat, campaigned for his
release, she was gunned down on a street in Lagos, Nigeria's
capital.
<p>
   In the fall, Abiola, 22, didn't just come back for her last
semester of college, she came back with a gusto that surprised even
her friends. She has handed in her 122-page thesis, and this month
she'll take her final exams. Her adviser predicts Abiola will
graduate with honors  &MD;  a special distinction because her mother and
her grandmothers never got beyond high school.
<p>
   In between studying and keeping tabs on five younger brothers
and sisters, Abiola is setting up a foundation to honor her mother.
She might go to graduate school. But first she will go on a West
Coast tour for Amnesty International to speak out about repression
in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.
<p>
   This isn't what Abiola pictured when she arrived at college as
an 18-year-old freshman who consulted her father about every big
decision. Abiola laughs easily, and she breaks into a laugh as she
remembers how naive and carefree she was back in the fall of 1992.
``I figured I would get my degree, go home, get married to a
Nigerian who was a friend of the family and live five minutes from
my parents.''
<p>
   A privileged life
<p>
   Sitting in the apartment of her older brother, Lekar, during
winter break in Virginia, Abiola describes her family's estate in
Lagos. She mentions the gate in front, the sprawling house, the
tennis court and soccer field, the two pools, the three shifts of
security guards ...
<p>
   Just how many rooms does the house have?
<p>
   Abiola, who has spent two hours talking effortlessly about her
theories of development and democracy, is stumped. Her hair is tied
in tight braids. She thinks for a few seconds.
<p>
   ``Fifty rooms?'' she says, as if she's never considered the
question. ``Plus the guest house.''
<p>
   Abiola's father  &MD;  known as ``Chief Abiola''  &MD;  started as an
accountant at a hospital in Lagos, then served as the top executive
for IT&AMP;T in Africa and the Mideast. He also published newspapers,
ran agribusinesses and, according to Randy Echols, his lobbyist in
Washington, became Nigeria's leading distributor of both the Bible
and the Koran.
<p>
   The family expanded as Abiola took a total of four wives and
moved into the estate in Lagos. His daughter says money, real
estate and possessions mean little. Asked about memories of growing
up, she rhapsodizes about traveling with her father, talking
politics with up-and-coming leaders across Africa.
<p>
   ``It was a lot of fun to see my father interact with leaders,
but the best for me was when he would tell me about his childhood,
about how he had to carry firewood home and walk a long way to
school where he had to copy down everything because his family
didn't have money for books,'' Abiola said.
<p>
   ``Hafsat is quite remarkable, considering the stress she must be
under with her father in detention and her mother just killed,''
says Owens Saro-Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer who was
executed by the government in 1995. ``And it's wonderful that
someone with that background, a rich father and all the trappings
of wealth, is so committed to human rights and democracy.''
<p>
   When Abiola was 14, her family sent her to Phillips Academy in
Andover. She became president of a black students association and
ran track. To the horror of her schoolmates back in Nigeria, she
also joined a gay student group. She wasn't gay and she probably
was the only Muslim member. No matter. She believed passionately in
freedom.
<p>
   ``I didn't understand my country until I came to the United
States and started questioning so many things about Nigeria,''
Abiola says. ``You step away and say, `This doesn't seem right,
this doesn't seem fair.'''
<p>
   During her senior year at prep school, she was admitted to four
top colleges. She wanted to go to Georgetown University, but she
asked her father's advice.
<p>
   ``Let me think about it,'' he said. He called a day later and
said, ``Harvard.'' She smiles as she remembers that conversation.
The family likes to joke about the way her father makes a decision,
then pretends he needs time to think about it and eventually
announces his original decision.
<p>
   At dinner at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Abiola asked her
father what major he would recommend. He asked for time to think
that over.
<p>
   A few days later, a postcard arrived. ``Finance and computer
science,'' it said. She tried to follow his advice, but after a
couple of economics courses, she was frustrated. They were too
quantitative and theoretical. She wanted to mix in real-world
experiences, so she added politics and history and created her own
major.
<p>
   At Harvard, she didn't take long to make a mark.
<p>
   History professor Leroy Vail was teaching an honors course on
South Africa when he was struck by the maturity of Abiola, then a
freshman. A year later, Vail hosted a garden party at his house. He
looked out to see half the people transfixed, clustered around
Abiola as she gave an impromptu seminar on Nigeria.
<p>
   ``She's perhaps the most remarkable student I've known in 30
years of teaching,'' says Vail, now Abiola's thesis adviser. ``I
told her if she lived in a decent country, I could see her as the
first woman president.''
<p>
   Told of that, Abiola reacts the way she does to many
compliments: with an airy laugh. ``Professor Vail amuses me,'' she
says.
<p>
   A free election
<p>
   When Nigeria's dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, promised a free
election in 1993, Chief Abiola saw his chance to be elected
president. Dozens of relatives joined the campaign, so Hafsat
Abiola decided to stay at Harvard. She spent hundreds of dollars
calling back to Nigeria every month. The news was heartening. In
Nigeria, where regional and ethnic differences are sharp, polls
showed her father winning support from all groups  &MD;  even soldiers.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   5 whole chicken breasts, skin removed and breasts halved
<p>
   1 gallon water
<p>
   4 medium onions, finely chopped
<p>
   3 medium green bell peppers, cored, seeded and finely chopped
<p>
   4 pounds fresh okra, thinly sliced
<p>
   4 whole tomatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped
<p>
   2 cans (16 ounces each) whole peeled tomatoes, crushed with
their juice
<p>
   1 bunch celery, sliced thick
<p>
   3 cloves garlic, crushed
<p>
   2 pounds andouille sausage, cut into thin slices
<p>
   4 tablespoons butter
<p>
   4 tablespoons flour
<p>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
<p>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
<p>
   1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
<p>
   3 teaspoons paprika
<p>
   2 tablespoons file powder
<p>
   3 bay leaves
<p>
   1 tablespoon garlic salt
<p>
   Several dashes hot sauce
<p>
   2 cups raw converted long-grain white rice (such as Uncle
Ben's), cooked according to package directions
<p>
   In a large soup pot put the chicken and water. Bring to a boil
and skim the surface thoroughly. Add enough additional water so the
chicken is submerged in liquid.
<p>
   Lower the heat and simmer the chicken for 45 minutes or until it
is cooked through. Remove from the pot and set aside.
<p>
   Spoon off as much fat as possible from the stock. Add the
onions, green peppers, okra, fresh and canned tomatoes, celery and
garlic. Return the stock to a boil, lower the heat and cover.
Simmer for 1 hour or until the vegetables are very tender. Add more
water during cooking so the vegetables are covered by 1 inch of
liquid.
<p>
   Pull the chicken off the bones and tear into bite-size pieces.
Set aside.
<p>
   In a skillet brown the andouille. Remove and set aside.
<p>
   Meanwhile, make a roux: In a small skillet, melt the butter and
stir in the flour. When the mixture is smooth, continue cooking,
stirring constantly, until the roux is golden brown. Take care that
it does not burn.
<p>
   When the vegetables are tender, carefully ladle a spoonful of
the stock into the skillet of roux and stir constantly to blend the
stock with the roux. Add another ladle of stock and continue
stirring.
<p>
   Stir the roux mixture into the pot of stock. Do this gradually,
so the roux mixes into the stock.
<p>
   When all the roux has been added, add the chicken and sausage
with the basil, thyme, cayenne pepper, paprika, file powder, bay
leaves, garlic salt, and hot sauce.
<p>
   Continue cooking the gumbo for 45 minutes or until the
vegetables are cooked through and the soup is very flavorful.
<p>
   Add a spoonful of rice to each bowl and ladle the gumbo over the
rice. Serve at once with French bread and red wine.
<p>
   Serves 8.
<p>
MAGNOLIAS SOUTHERN CUISINE JAMBALAYA &HT;    
<p>
   John Silberman of Magnolias cooks the chicken mixture separately
from the rice when he makes jambalaya in his Cambridge restaurant.
Have the freshly cooked rice ready in a large heatproof casserole.
Add jambalaya mixture to it until it has the consistency of a moist
paella. If you have to keep it warm until serving, moisten the rice
again later with some of the cooking liquid. You can make the
chicken mixture quite hot because the rice will tone it down.
<p>
   1 1/2 pounds andouille sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick
<p>
   2 onions, cut up
<p>
   3 bell peppers, cored, seeded and cut up
<p>
   4 stalks celery, sliced thick
<p>
   4 cloves garlic, halved
<p>
   1 can (32 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, crushed in a bowl with
their liquid
<p>
   1 1/2 quarts chicken stock or water
<p>
   4 whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size
pieces
<p>
   4 boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
<p>
   1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled
<p>
   3 to 4 tablespoons Cajun spice mix that includes salt, white
pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, garlic powder
and onion powder
<p>
   4 cups raw converted long-grain white rice (such as Uncle
Ben's), cooked according to package directions
<p>
   In a large flameproof casserole, cook the andouille until golden
brown. Remove it from the pan.
<p>
   In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, work together the
onions, peppers, celery and garlic until they are chopped.
<p>
   Add them to the casserole. Pour in the tomatoes and stock or
water.
<p>
   Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and cover the pan. Cook the
mixture for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
<p>
   Add the andouille with the chicken. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons
of the Cajun seasoning.
<p>
   Return the liquid to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 30
minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Add the shrimp and
cook 5 minutes more or until the shrimp are cooked through. Taste
and add more Cajun seasoning if you like.
<p>
   Keep the chicken and shrimp mixture warm, if necessary, until
just before serving.
<p>
   Transfer the rice to a very large heatproof casserole. Add the
chicken and sausage mixture with its liquid a little at a time. All
the solids should go into the rice and just enough of the liquid to
make a dish about the consistency of paella. Use any remaining
liquid to moisten the dish later (or when serving leftovers).
<p>
   If you need to keep the dish warm, cover it and put in a
preheated 200-degree oven. Keep warm up to 20 minutes before
serving. If the rice seems dry, add more of the hot cooking liquid
or water. Serve at once.
<p>
   Serves 10.

 &UR; THE EVIDENCE AGAINST GINGRICH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS OLIPHANT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- In one of the hundreds of documents made public
over the inaugural weekend in Newt Gingrich's ethics case, one
stands out for both its probative and personal value.
<p>
   In the speaker's own hand, it shows a stick figure in the
middle. On the left, arrows show all things flowing to him; on the
right, arrows show all things flowing from him.
<p>
   At the bottom, Gingrich has written: ``A pattern rather than a
single point.''
<p>
   For the Dennis Rodman of Congress, the evidentiary value is
obvious. There was no compartmentalization of any of Gingrich's
various legislative, political and personal activities. Because
there wasn't, rules and possibly laws that nearly everyone in
politics obeys routinely were not so much broken as shattered.
<p>
   The diagram of Gingrich Inc. does not require a psychologist for
further analysis, moreover. To say that the speaker has a bit of an
ego problem  &MD;  other documents also show him in the center of
various universes  &MD;  is classic understatement and a continual
precursor to the attitude that rules are for other, lesser souls.
<p>
   That Gingrich behaved with impunity is now established fact. The
fact that the perpetrator turned out to be the pol who made such a
big deal two years ago about applying laws to Congress that apply
to real people is at least ironic.
<p>
   Ever since special counsel James Cole's summary of the evidence
in this case was made public, discerning readers of the national
press will have noted words and phrases like ``surprising'' or
``surprisingly strong'' in the descriptions of it.
<p>
   In journalism, these are usually code words for previous
ignorance. In this case, they are also code for information that
went completely against the factually challenged conventional
wisdom that had previously prevailed.
<p>
   For roughly two years, the ethics case has supposedly been about
a college course and its financing, and then (after last September)
also about whether Gingrich had misled the House's ethics committee
during its investigation.
<p>
   Up until Friday afternoon this case was supposed to be
hopelessly partisan, possibly hopelessly snagged and likely to
result in an ugly fight this week on the House floor.
<p>
   Then Jim Cole opened his mouth and his files for the first time,
whereupon the atmosphere was completely transformed. For a change,
the evidence spoke instead of the spin doctors. For a change,
evidence produced a bipartisan result that was both mature,
justified and, for the moment (at least until the next case or
until the Internal Revenue Service rules on this one), dispositive.
<p>
   Cole's summary of the facts  &MD;  written, spoken and documentary  &MD; 
made three things clear above all:
<p>
    &MD; This was not about a college course as such, but about the
funding of Gingrich's ambitious national political operation. Short
of cash, he himself hit upon the idea of getting more money by
attracting donors with the prospect of giving tax-deductible
contributions.
<p>
   About $1.5 million that the committee could identify was raised
in this fashion, employing dormant foundations similar to the way
financial scams use ``shell'' corporations. Several checks, made
out to the foundations which in turn wrote checks back to
Gingrich's major political committee, were identified, and donors
confirmed that they were solicited for politics, not charity.
<p>
    &MD; Gingrich told the ethics subcommittee and Cole at least three
directly conflicting things about his activities.
<p>
   At the outset, when he was seeking quick dismissal of all
charges, he acknowledged some commingling of his political and
educational lives. During the investigation itself, he denied using
tax-deductive money for political purposes. And then, confronted
with the evidence that he did, he confessed.
<p>
    &MD; The case was plea-bargained. The investigating subcommittee,
its documents show, was prepared to say it had reason to believe
that Gingrich flouted the tax laws and either knew or should have
known he was giving false information to the ethics unit.
<p>
   But to avoid months of evidentiary hearings, Gingrich agreed to
admit to softened charges of what amounts to recklessness in his
political fund-raising and the provision of false and misleading
evidence, fudging the issue of intent.
<p>
   On the $300,000 penalty, Cole blew away another morsel of GOP
spin. It had nothing to do with reimbursing the ethics committee;
instead, it reflected his and the subcommittee's judgment that
Gingrich's offenses fell between those requiring a formal reprimand
(for ``serious'' rules violations) and those calling for censure
(``more serious'' violations).
<p>
   As such, the idea was to make the point by adding something to
the reprimand. At the same time (Democrats finally noted), the
purpose was to leave Gingrich's future to his own judgment and that
of his Republican colleagues.
<p>
   What formally unfolded yesterday displayed the power of evidence
over politics, of rigorous investigation over sound bites.
<p>
   Whitewater fanatics might want to take note, but they probably
won't.

 &UR; ROYAL FAMILY WORKS TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN MONARCHY
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release weekend of Jan. 25-26
<p>
    &UR; By LOUIS J. SALOME
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR; 
<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  After years of scandals, the British royal family has
embarked on a quiet but determined public relations effort to
restore its image and stem a fatal plunge in popularity.
<p>
   Representatives of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, her
son and heir, deny that a carefully plotted restoration scheme is
etched on royal stationery and sealed in Buckingham Palace vaults.
<p>
   But they acknowledge that, in an attempt to restore public
confidence in the monarchy, the palace will call more attention to
its charitable work and seek ways to cast Charles, 48, as a serious
heir who is fit to rule.
<p>
   It hopes to complete its work in advance of the 50th anniversary
of Queen Elizabeth's reign in 2002.
<p>
   Staring the royal family in the face is a respected national
poll that this month said 48 percent of the queen's subjects
believed the royal family would be abolished in 50 years.
Fifty-eight percent predicted that Britain will be a republic in
100 years.
<p>
   More than a third of those questioned said they believed Charles
would make a bad king.
<p>
   Only seven years ago the same poll reported that only 11 percent
of the people questioned believed the monarchy would be history
within 50 years.
<p>
   ``The monarchy is doomed. I think they should agree to go,''
said Paul Flynn, a member of the opposition Labor Party and the
most vocal parliamentary advocate of a republican government. ``I'd
give it 10 years. I don't think it will survive the death of the
queen.''
<p>
   The royal family's supporters aren't convinced.
<p>
   Lord Blake, a Conservative member of parliament and defender of
the monarchy and the aristocratic system it supports, believes the
royal family's problems have been ``very much exaggerated in the
media.''
<p>
   The queen, who turns 71 in April, is ``admired and respected''
by the public, Lord Blake said, and Charles' prospects of being
king ``haven't been damaged'' by his divorce from Diana, the
princess of Wales and mother of his two sons. Charles ``wouldn't be
the first king who has had a previous divorce,'' Lord Blake said.
<p>
   David Starkey of the London School of Economics, a historian and
expert on the British monarchy, believes the royal family has
``reasonably serious problems, but I don't think they're anything
like terminal.''
<p>
   He said Charles is ``not irretrievably lost even now. But there
are more question marks over him than are comfortable.''
<p>
   Even so, Starkey said, ``More likely than not there will be a
monarchy in 50 years.''
<p>
   A new seven-person steering committee of advisers will help
Charles decide what speeches to give, trips to make and duties to
share with the queen. As part of the rehabilitation effort, Charles
will make serious speeches on the environment, education,
architecture and jobs for young people and make major public
appearances in Britain and abroad.
<p>
   To improve his kingly standing with the public as his mother
ages, Charles will share more of the monarch's duties.
<p>
    &UR; (Story can end here. Optional add follows.) &LR; 
<p>
   In what some commentators have called the beginning of the end
to the ``War of The Waleses,'' Charles and Diana may in time even
attend some official engagements together. The prince and princess
will try to avoid scheduling separate engagements on the same days
so public attention isn't shared, which inevitably leaves Charles
in the shadows.
<p>
   Royal strategy is also being crafted by the family's Way Ahead
Group, which is headed by the queen and includes all senior family
members and Elizabeth's senior advisers.
<p>
   The queen and her husband Prince Philip will celebrate their
50th wedding anniversary this year by inviting 4,000 other couples
who were married in 1947 to a garden party at Buckingham Palace.
<p>
   Elizabeth and Philip were married on Nov. 20, 1947, but the
garden party will be held on July 15 to take advantage of the
weather.
<p>
   Diana still attracts armies of photographers, an admiring public
and intense political scrutiny wherever she goes in her drive to
capture the title of Britain's ``Queen of Hearts.''
<p>
   Her recent trip to war-ruined Angola on behalf of the Red Cross
campaign to ban land mines brought Diana into conflict with
government policy. She drew some criticism, a great deal more
praise and attention that few if any other British public figure
could match.
<p>
   Diana's appearances at balls, banquets and movie premiers won't
dry up. But her work for the International Red Cross, and for
charities that combat AIDS, cancer, leprosy and provide medical
care for children will enhance her status without harming the royal
family.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan
reintroduced legislation that would ban the sale of tax-exempt
bonds to finance professional sports stadiums.
<p>
   The New York Democrat presented the bill to the Senate last
night, said a spokeswoman for the senator.
<p>
   Moynihan sponsored similar legislation last year, drawing
objections from states and local governments that had stadium
projects planned or underway.
<p>
   The main difference between this year's bill and last year's is
the effective date of the ban would be delayed, according to the
Bond Buyer newspaper. Under the new bill, the ban would take effect
when the legislation is approved by a congressional committee, the
newspaper said. Last year's bill, which would have put the ban into
effect as of the day it was introduced, didn't pass.
<p>
   State and local government groups last year objected to the
effective date of the ban, saying it was retroactive and put many
bond sales at risk.
<p>
   Moynihan said last year that he wanted to stop the unwarranted
loss of federal funds that benefits wealthy sports teams and their
owners.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  If his name were Bledsoe or Meggett or Slade, and
he had his own podium at Super Bowl Media Day, you would already
know about Uncle Sonny, the emu farmer.
<p>
   You would know about the ``Go, Patriots'' sign in the window of
the R &AMP; R Barbecue, the only restaurant in Runge, Tex. (pop. 1,200)
where the R and R Special  &MD;  hamburger, fries and a Coke  &MD;  can be
had for just $3.45.
<p>
   You would know that his high school graduating class had just 26
students, that his first car was an old farm truck, and that his
mother, Kathy, the fourth-grade teacher, is amazed at her son's
transformation into a ``neat freak.''
<p>
   And you would know, from Uncle Sonny, that ``the boy's daddy,
Jerry, is thrilled to death,'' and will make the nine-hour drive
from Runge to New Orleans to see his son play for the Patriots in
the Super Bowl.
<p>
   But on Media Day, Mike Gisler was an uncharted island in a sea
of minicams and microphones. No elevated podium, no pack of
interrogators hanging on his every word.
<p>
   No one asked if he had any of Uncle Sonny's healing emu oil in
his locker.
<p>
   No one asked about the ``Gisler, 67'' sign in the R &AMP; R, in the
middle of Dallas Cowboys country.
<p>
   No one asked the size of his daddy's cattle ranch (a modest 115
acres, which is why he also has an oil business in town) or about
the signs and banners hanging in his mama's schoolhouse.
<p>
   Everyone, even Mike Gisler, a backup center/guard and special
teams regular, gets asked something on Media Day. One life form
attached to the end of a microphone accosted just about everybody
in a uniform to ask who was their favorite member of the Three
Stooges.
<p>
   ``I didn't get asked that one,'' Gisler said. ``I did have a
couple of people asking me some shady things, stuff that had no
connection to football.''
<p>
   His opinion of Bourbon Street? ``Yeah, stuff like that,'' he
said.
<p>
   But for the better part of the hour in which the Patriots took
the Superdome field to face a horde more fearsome than the Green
Bay Packers  &MD;  a thousand reporters with pens dripping and tongues
wagging  &MD;  Gisler found his was mostly an unexamined life.
<p>
   Like metal filings to a magnet, the mobs amassed around Bledsoe
and Meggett and Slade, Parcells, McGinest and Coates.
<p>
   Gisler, the 303d player chosen in the 1992 draft who passed
through the Saints and Oilers before becoming a Patriot, talked to
a solitary reporter from San Antonio, the big city about an hour
away from Runge. ``Last week, I talked to a reporter from Victoria,
which is also an hour from Runge,'' said Gisler, whose name is
pronounced like the fowl. ``And a lot of people have come up and
said, `Hi, I'm so-and-so from such-and-such,' and I say, `OK.'''
<p>
   Gisler said he was content to be among the overlooked.
<p>
   ``I kind of like this,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to be up
there (on a podium). They've been up there talking a solid hour. I
could field questions for an hour, but talking for an hour? That's
a different story.''
<p>
   As a national story, Gisler figures he's no story at all. He was
doubtful that he was creating much of a ripple even in Runge.
``I've been gone so long,'' he said, ``a lot of people there
probably don't even know who I am.''
<p>
   It took Uncle Sonny Hall, and Kathy Gisler, and Julia Reyes,
proprietor of the R &AMP; R, to set the record straight on that one.
<p>
   ``Wow,'' said Uncle Sonny. ``Mike Gisler was born and raised
here. This is something big and great. Call back the wife in an
hour, she'll tell you.''
<p>
   Uncle Sonny used to work the oil fields as a welder, then
retired and invested in emus, the ostrich-like birds. ``I had to go
back to work so I could raise the emus,'' he said. ``I bought them
boogers, then the bottom dropped out, and now I can't even give 'em
away. But their oil is wonderful, for burns, hurts, fair skin. I
think Mike has some, and some of the Cowboys, too.
<p>
   Kathy Gisler no longer has use for the Cowboys, not after their
arrest record drew more attention than their wins and losses. ``I
root for whoever Mike plays for,'' she said, ``and anyone who's
playing against the Cowboys.''
<p>
   She won't be in New Orleans Sunday; she opted to babysit in
Houston for Gisler's 11-month-old daughter, Jordan McKee. ``I tried
to watch the AFC (Championship) game, and nearly had a heart
attack,'' she said. ``I told Mike, and he understands.''
<p>
   Julia Reyes' son, Ramiro, played high school ball with Gisler.
Every Friday, she and her husband, Raymond, turn their 11-table
restaurant over to the high school team for their game-day meal.
``No, we don't have a TV in here,'' she said, ``but we're
supporting Mike. We're a small town, but we're all excited and
we're following them all the way. Go, Patriots!''
<p>
   A little story for a big day. Maybe it'll be told just once, but
for big Mike Gisler and little Runge, Tex., it doesn't have to be
told at all. They're the ones living it, after all.

<p>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla.  &MD;  No one at Raines High bothered the skinny
kid from the north side of town. His classmates might have made a
crack about his spindly legs, and he might have responded with a
joke about the size of someone's head. But that was it.
<p>
   You knew not to make things too personal with Shawn Jefferson,
the 140-pounder from the projects. He didn't have to tell you that.
You just had to watch him walk. Freddie Stephens, the football
coach, sensed it every day in the late 1980s when he would see the
well-dressed Jefferson on the Raines campus, walking with
playfulness in one step and business in the other.
<p>
   Jefferson could use his speed to run by you on a football field.
He was so fast that soon after watching him run, Stephens insisted
that he ``go talk to Coach Adams.'' Yes, James Adams. The track
coach. But as quickly as he could make a defender miss on the
field, he could become a territorial defender off it when he sensed
that someone was disrespecting his family.
<p>
   He's still like that.
<p>
   Patriots fans know the man is fast. He was fast enough to catch
50 Drew Bledsoe passes this season; fast enough to open the middle
of the field so rookie Terry Glenn could catch 90; fast enough that
Bill Parcells told him last summer that he would be a starter until
he showed he couldn't handle it.
<p>
   ``And I believed him,'' Jefferson said, ``because Bill is a man
of his word.''
<p>
   People like Parcells would have been accepted in Jefferson's
high school neighborhood. That it is predominantly black is not the
point. This is: word is bond. And if your words and actions do not
connect, Jefferson would rather not speak to you. If you happen to
disrespect the family? That's not good.
<p>
   ``I don't like people playing around with my family, man,'' said
Jefferson, the 11th of 12 children. ``I get real serious when it
comes to them.''
<p>
   The subject has become more tense for Shawn and his mother, Jean
Daniels, in the last six years. Those who use pens, notepads,
recorders and cameras for a living have come to this northern
Florida city saying they want to speak with Jean about the son she
reluctantly allowed to play football at Raines. But they often
leave with reports rife with psychoanalysis.
<p>
   On the same day in 1991 that Jefferson was drafted by the
Houston Oilers, his brother, Kenneth Hartley, was arrested and
charged with murder. He had been released from prison less than a
year earlier for a 1987 crime in which he shot and killed a
15-year-old girl (he was given a seven-year sentence because the
evidence against him was weak; he was released early).
<p>
   In '91, authorities said, Hartley abducted a young man named
Gino Mayhew, forced him to drive his Chevy Blazer to Jacksonville's
Sherwood Elementary School and then oh-so-coldly shot him once in
the face and three times in the back of the head. The prosecutor on
the case, George Bateh, said Hartley left the man dead in the
schoolyard as night fell. It was a ghastly sight for schoolchildren
the next morning.
<p>
   For that, Hartley sits on death row about 60 miles from here in
a place called Union Correctional Institution. His little brother,
the one he often protected, is in New Orleans getting ready to
participate in his second Super Bowl.
<p>
   Hence, the analysis.
<p>
   People want to know why. People build contrasts. They see that
Jefferson and Hartley grew up in the same house. Both heard Jean
Daniels insist on Bible readings, homework, respect. Both knew
streets where men and women were gunned down. But these were also
streets where the majority of people worked often and hard for
small pay. Work was the rule, killing the exception. So why this?
<p>
   ``I understand that Shawn Jefferson is a fine young man and
there are other fine people in his family,'' Bateh said. ``But
Kenneth Hartley is a robber and a killer. He has killed twice. He
is an urban terrorist. He is a clear and present danger to anyone
around him. When given the liberty, he kills.''
<p>
   Bateh did not pause when saying this. He spoke directly,
quickly. This is part of his job. Jefferson's official job is to
catch passes for the Patriots. But he has another: looking out for
his family.
<p>
   The man Bateh describes as a mean-spirited killer still is
Jefferson's big brother, nicknamed ``Kip.'' That brother sat in a
Raines gym and listened as Coach Stephens asked him to let his
little brother develop into a football player, rather than a
teen-ager who ran the streets. Hartley agreed and, despite his
criminal record, Stephens says to this day, ``Kip was never a bully
at school. Surprisingly, he was real quiet. Real respectful in
public.''
<p>
   Jefferson still loves this brother. He still is family. So as
the state systematically plows toward the execution of one of its
nearly 400 people on death row, Hartley's little brother is trying
to prevent it. He pays his brother's legal fees.
<p>
   Right? Wrong? This is inconsequential to Jefferson. It is his
brother, which means it is his family. And, he repeats, ``No one is
going to mess with my family.''
<p>
   Jefferson is right. No earthly one has messed with his family.
But fate has tested his parents' faith (Curtis Jefferson no longer
lives with the family). Hartley was given his death sentence in
'93. His time is due to come in about 2003. Another son died of
asthma. Another was the victim of crib death. Another daughter has
been paralyzed for several years because of an accident she had as
a teen.
<p>
   The family didn't want to talk about any of that last week.
Jefferson was seething over an article that came out of Providence.
He believes that a writer came here and misled his mother, saying
that a story would be written about him. But the story mentioned
his brother as much as him. Hartley elected not to comment, as did
Daniels.
<p>
   ``She is tired of talking about the differences between her
sons,'' Stephens said. ``There is always that mention of Kip: one
son on death row, another in the NFL. Well, you know, sometimes
that is the way life goes.''
<p>
   Maybe it could have tilted another way for Jefferson. People
here tell you that this city's streets can swallow up young black
men. There are nearly a million people in Greater Jacksonville and
the city has developed some shops along the St. John's River. But
for all its people, this area has the pace of a much smaller
region. Some choose to combat their boredom and scarce job
opportunities by sinking into crime. That is evidenced by
statistics that now include Kenneth Hartley. Dade County, in the
much larger Miami area, has more people on death row than Duval.
The difference, though, is less than 10.
<p>
   Stephens knew that if Jefferson worked with him, he could get to
college on a football scholarship. Stephens and Adams, the track
coach, stayed on Jefferson.
<p>
   ``Those two coaches are the reason I'm here today,'' Jefferson
said. ``Especially Coach Stephens. When I was out there being a
knucklehead, he sat me down and told me about it. I'm telling you,
I owe everything to those guys.''
<p>
   Stephens will take some credit. He will also volley some back to
Jefferson for being a steady and businesslike teen-ager. The coach
likes to tell the recruiting story in which Jefferson ignored the
University of Georgia and leaned toward tiny Liberty University.
The reason had little to do with football: Liberty is a Christian
school run by Jerry Falwell.
<p>
   ``That has to tell you a lot about that kid right there,''
Stephens said. ``There he is turning down Georgia  &MD;  Georgia!  &MD;  for
Liberty.''
<p>
   He eventually settled on Central Florida, which changed to
Division 1AA (from Division 2) while Jefferson was there. The folks
in Orlando won't forget him. When the Knights made it to the
national semifinals before losing to eventual champion Georgia
Southern, Jefferson decided that the team should have rings. He
delivered them when he got to the NFL.
<p>
   Speaking of the NFL, he was angry at every team in the league
for going eight rounds before picking him. He thought he was much
better than that and told his college teammates, ``I'm going to
make them pay.''
<p>
   That was always Jefferson, fiercely competitive when a challenge
was presented to him and those he loves. He hears the whispers,
people saying that his brother is guilty despite consistent
innocent pleas.
<p>
   ``There are hundreds of people on death row,'' Bateh said.
``Talk to most of them and they'll tell you that they're
innocent.''
<p>
   The attorney Jefferson hired, Robert Willis, responded to that
by noting that Hartley could have pleaded guilty and avoided death
row ``but he refused because he maintained his innocence.''
<p>
   Away from all the legal arguments and social questions,
Jefferson prepares for the Packers. He says he is anxious to face
Jacksonville natives LeRoy Butler and Edgar Bennett of the Packers.
He says he will be representing Raines High because ``you have to
know about winning at that school. You have to have heart. If you
walk in there, you see trophies in the classrooms because they
don't have enough room in the trophy cases.''
<p>
   Jefferson smiled and talked about the days when no one bothered
him because they could sense he had heart. It takes heart to be a
little guy in a big man's game. It takes heart to stay with your
family, no matter what they do.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- AT&AMP;T Corp.'s fourth-quarter
earnings fell short of expectations as a slight improvement in
long-distance operations was offset by higher costs related to
unpaid bills.
<p>
   Profit from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $1.24
billion, or 76 cents a share, from $1.09 billion, or 68 cents, in
the year-earlier period. Wall Street was expecting 80 cents,
according to the average estimate of 25 analysts from IBES
International Inc.
<p>
   While AT&AMP;T's results show the company is beginning to stem
defections by long-distance customers, President John Walter's
turnaround effort is still at an early stage and could take several
quarters to complete, analysts said.
<p>
   ``There is movement in the right direction,'' said Barry Sine,
an analyst at SBC Warburg Inc. ``The problem is the rate of
improvement is not substantial enough to meet expectations.''
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's sales rose 2.7 percent to $13.24 from $12.89 billion.
Continuing operations include AT&AMP;T's long-distance, wireless,
Internet and credit-card businesses.
<p>
   During the 1996 fourth quarter, New York-based AT&AMP;T completed a
three-way split that spun off NCR Corp. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. Income and a gain from the discontinued operations resulted in
net income of $1.62 billion, or $1 a share.
<p>
   In the 1995 period, restructuring charges and income from
discontinued operations resulted in a loss of $2.68 billion, or
$1.67 a share. Income from discontinued operations in that period
was $417 million, or 26 cents a share.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T shares fell 3/4 to 38 5/8 in midafternoon trading.
<p>
   Volume, or the amount of traffic AT&AMP;T carried on its phone
network, rose six percent -- up from 5 percent in the third
quarter. AT&AMP;T said its flat-rate calling plan is beginning to stem
market-share losses.
<p>
   The AT&AMP;T One Rate plan has 3 million customers that have come
from other AT&AMP;T calling plans as well as from competitors. It lets
users make long-distance calls for 15 cents a minute anywhere in
the U.S. and at any time.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said the plan is reducing churn, or the rate at which
customers leave AT&AMP;T for another long-distance carrier.
<p>
   ``They may have turned the corner, ending the decreasing growth
rates in volume,'' said Robert Wilkes, an analyst at Brown Brothers
Harriman.
<p>
   Still, AT&AMP;T's volume growth is expected to be the lowest among
the top three U.S. long-distance carriers. Analysts expect No. 2
MCI Communications Corp. to boost volume nine percent, while No. 3
Sprint Corp. is seen increasing volume 10 percent or more.
<p>
   Operating profit for communications services -- long-distance
and wireless -- rose more than 14 percent to $1.91 billion, while
operating margin widened to 14.8 percent from 13.5 percent.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T for the first time noted uncollectible expenses in its
long-distance business resulting from unpaid phone bills due to
fraud, delinquencies and bankruptcies among its business customers.
The problem bills increased AT&AMP;T's expenses by $200 million in the
quarter.
<p>
   ``The competition is so intense now that someone who doesn't pay
his bill, they can always just move to another carrier,'' Chief
Financial Officer Richard Miller said.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T expects the uncollectible items to cost the company $100
million, or 4 cents a share per quarter, for the next few quarters.
<p>
   Analysts said other phone companies may report similar trends.
``It's something to put on the radar screen,'' Wilkes said.
<p>
   Wireless revenue rose 18 percent to $937 million, while the
company boosted its number of cellular customers 32 percent to 5.2
million. AT&AMP;T said that number includes more than 900,000 digital
wireless customers.
<p>
   Sales from communications products, including consulting and
online services, rose 17 percent to $386 million. Less than a year
after it was unveiled, AT&AMP;T's WorldNet Internet-access service has
568,000 customers.
<p>
   Financial services revenue fell 32 percent to $374 million
because of the company's 1995 program to diversify funding sources
for its AT&AMP;T Universal Card services, AT&AMP;T said.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's financial services business had an operating loss of $4
million, compared with an operating profit of $109 million in the
year-earlier period. However, that's narrower than the $35 million
loss in the third quarter.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's total operating expenses from continuing operations rose
2 percent. The company said ``significant'' increases in network
expenses were offset by a decrease in access fees to connect to the
Bells' networks, and selling expenses.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said it had 130,400 employees as of Dec. 31, up 1.5
percent. The increase runs counter to AT&AMP;T's plan, unveiled last
January, to slash 17,000 jobs from its long-distance, wireless and
credit-card businesses. AT&AMP;T has cut 5,700 jobs under that plan.
<p>
   Those cuts have been offset by an increase in jobs at its
wireless and customer-care positions, part of a plan to offer a
package of services.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T also said it plans this year to buy stock in the open
market for shareholder and employee-benefit plans, rather than
issue new shares, to try to decrease dilution from such plans.
<p>
   For 1996, AT&AMP;T said income from continuing operations rose to
$5.61 billion, or $3.47 a share, from $5.24 billion, or $3.29 a
year earlier.
<p>
   Income and a gain from discontinued operations resulted in net
income of $5.91 billion, or $3.66 a share. A year earlier, income
from discontinued operations and charges resulted in net income to
$139 million, or 9 cents a share.
<p>
   Sales for 1996 rose to $52.18 billion from $50.66 billion.

<p>
   Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Sears, Roebuck
&AMP; Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise on strong
sales growth, particularly for goods such as clothing that carry
higher profits.
<p>
   Analysts said the results, which are expected this week, should
also show an increase in credit-card delinquencies, mostly because
of the rise in personal bankruptcies. The unit's profit, though, is
expected to rise because of higher rates on the cards and higher
fees.
<p>
   ``The quarter will be characterized with excellent retailing
results and another large reserve for bad debt on credit cards,''
said Joseph Ronning, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
<p>
   Sears is expected to earn $1.37 a share, the average estimate of
23 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc., up from $1.13 in
the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   The nation's second-largest retailer had strong sales increases
during the holiday season in most of its business, from computers
to jewelry. Clothing sold particularly well.
<p>
   Sales at stores open at least a year rose 9.5 percent in
December and 6.1 percent for the 48 weeks ended Jan. 4, bigger
gains than those turned in by many of Sears' competitors.
<p>
   Clothing sales also made up a greater percentage of total sales,
analysts said, which helped boost margins since Sears makes more
money on apparel than most other goods.
<p>
   ``Strong gross margin performance will favorably impact year-end
results,'' Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement earlier
this month.
<p>
   The expectation of higher earnings comes as other retailers --
including Kmart Corp., Toys ``R'' Us Inc., Limited Inc. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- are expected to report less-than-robust
fourth-quarter earnings following a disappointing holiday shopping
season.
<p>
   Sears' increase also comes against a robust quarter last year,
when earnings rose 28 percent on a 7 percent jump in sales.

 &UR; BC-DEMS-FUND-RAISING-BOS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CLINTON URGES LIMITS ON LARGE DONATIONS TO PARTY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER V. ROBINSON &LR;   &UR; AND BOB HOHLER &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The lofty rhetoric of inauguration day behind him,
President Clinton turned Tuesday to the fund-raising scandal that
bedeviled his reelection, endorsing unilateral limits on large
donations to the Democratic Party and bipartisan campaign finance
reform that would prohibit large party donations altogether.
<p>
   Seeking to improve its image, the Democratic National Committee
also ordered an immediate ban on contributions from permament
residents who are noncitizens and from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
companies, even though such donations are legally permissible.
<p>
   Moreover, after a campaign in which Clinton met a Chinese arms
dealer at the White House, and Vice President Al Gore raised
$20,000 from a convicted tax evader who was later imprisoned for
drug smuggling, the DNC promised closer scrutiny of people invited
to the White House. It also promised a rigorous background check on
anyone who gives more than $5,000.
<p>
   Clinton has endorsed campaign finance reform before. And his
assertion in a speech to the DNC that Republican abuses are worse,
together with the Democratic Party's enormous success in raising
campaign funds, provoked skepticism that the White House really
supports reform.
<p>
   ``If you are going to support this legislation and then beat the
crap out of the other side, it is pretty hard to get bipartisan
consensus,'' complained Sen. John McCain, Republican of Arizona,
and the principal author of campaign finance reform legislation in
the Senate.
<p>
   What angered McCain was Clinton's comment that Republicans have
had a ``free ride'' during disclosures of Democratic fund-raising
excesses. Republicans, Clinton said, ``raise more money; they raise
more foreign money; they raise more money in big contributions. And
we take all the heat.''
<p>
   While the GOP outraises the Democrats, McCain said he knows of
no evidence that the GOP raised foreign money illegally.
<p>
   Clinton, in his remarks, did not acknowledge any irregularities
in Democratic fund-raising. And his spokesman, Michael McCurry,
said Clinton would not stop his practice of inviting major donors
to spend the night in the Lincoln bedroom at the White House.
<p>
   But Vice President Al Gore, who spoke before Clinton, said the
Democrats want to ``put our house in order'' in the wake of
allegations of illegal fund-raising. And Clinton offered in his
address to the national committee to support an immediate ban on
all major donations to the party  &MD;  so-called ``soft money''  &MD;  if
the Republicans would follow suit.
<p>
   But McCain said Republicans would agree only if Democrats
stopped utilizing huge expenditures from labor unions, a suggestion
Democrats have rejected.
<p>
   Even without GOP agreement, the Democrats said they would
institute reforms of their own.
<p>
   In addition to turning away donations from resident aliens, the
DNC said it would also limit annual donations from individuals,
corporations and unions to $100,000. Some donors have given much
more. Former Stride-Rite Chairman Arnold Hiatt, for example, gave a
single donation to the party of $500,000.
<p>
   The bipartisan legislation, filed Tuesday in the Senate by
McCain and Sen. Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin; and in
the House by Reps. Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut,
and Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, would revamp the
way parties and candidates raise and spend campaign funds.
<p>
   It would ban soft money, the so-called ``party building''
donations with no limits which both parties have used to indirectly
promote their presidential candidates; sharply reduce or eliminate
contributions from political action committees and encourage
candidates to abide by voluntary spending limits by providing free
or discounted radio and television time.
<p>
   But similar measures died in the Senate in 1988, 1994 and 1996.
President Bush vetoed campaign finance legislation in 1992.
<p>
   Clinton spoke to the DNC as it changed its leadership. Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, handed over the title
of general chairman to former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer. The
day-to-day national chairman will be Steven Grossman, a former
Massachusetts state party chairman who has been serving as chairman
of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Another
Massachusetts fund-raiser, Alan Solomont, will become the party's
national finance chairman.

<p>
   Go house hunting with a full wallet in Milton, Mass. and your
real estate agent is likely to take you to Highland Street.
<p>
   She will point out the view toward Boston through the ancient
elms on the magnificent estates on either side of the hill.
<p>
   She will note the convenience for children of the public library
down the street and the playing fields of Milton Academy around the
corner.
<p>
   What she won't mention are the admitted and suspected child
molesters in the elegant brick mansion at the crest of the hill.
<p>
   She won't tell you because she doesn't know. She doesn't know
because the Catholic Church didn't tell her or anyone else. Not the
police chief. Not the Board of Selectmen. Not the headmaster of
Milton Academy. Not the children's librarian.
<p>
   The Archdiocese of Boston did not have to tell. Whether it
should have is a more difficult question, encapsulating the
inherent tension between civil liberties and public safety.
<p>
   There was no legal obligation to reveal the quietly expanded
mission of Our Lady's Hall, a retreat house that calls itself an
outpatient counseling center for alcoholic priests  &MD;  many of whom
now shun the place for fear of being branded among their colleagues
as child molesters themselves.
<p>
   The resident priests in the revolving cadre, removed from their
parishes because of allegations of sexual abuse, have been
convicted of no crimes. That, of course, does not mean they did not
commit any. Such convictions are rare among the clergy because
abuse allegations often surface years after the statute of
limitations has expired or they are resolved through civil rather
than criminal proceedings.
<p>
   ``If they are here, it really would be none of your business,''
is the view of Rev. Robert Beale, the director of the alcohol
recovery program at Our Lady's Hall.
<p>
   He has a point, a point that underscores the false security
represented by the Sex Offender Registry adopted with such fanfare
in Massachusetts last year.
<p>
   A Highland Street resident can ask the police department  &MD; 
located, as it happens, at the foot of Highland Street  &MD;  for the
names of sex offenders in the neighborhood and never learn of the
presence of the troubled, but never prosecuted, priests.
<p>
   John Walsh, spokesman for the archdiocese, has their privacy in
mind when he acknowledges only that Our Lady's Hall is used as
``transitional housing'' for priests under fire for sexual abuse.
He declines to say for how many priests the residence has served
that purpose, and for how long.
<p>
   None are in residence this week, he says, but declines to
confirm or deny that as many as eight have been there recently, and
that the mansion has been used in this way for years.
<p>
   ``For years?'' says an incredulous police chief, Kevin Mearn.
Until Tuesday, he thought Our Lady's Hall was ``just a retreat
house. Maybe they haven't been convicted but, at a minimum, the
police department should have been made aware of this, and there is
the question of the neighborhood's right to know who's living
here.''
<p>
   A classic clash of competing interests.
<p>
   Walsh says that the movements of the priests are ``strictly
monitored'' and ``carefully supervised,'' but others describe Our
Lady's Hall as ``a bed-and-breakfast'' that does not prohibit the
priests from leaving the grounds unaccompanied.
<p>
   As a practical matter, the Catholic Church has no real authority
to restrict the movements of its priests. And there are those who
contend it is only ``the hysteria'' about child abuse that makes
the priests' presence in a neighborhood of swing sets and tree
houses an issue at all.
<p>
   ``A lot of people would say, `Send them to Outer Mongolia,' but
there are children there, too,'' says Rev. Stephen Rossetti, a
psychiatrist at St. Luke's Institute, a Maryland treatment facility
for priests who molest children. ``In most cases these men are not
an immediate threat to minors. Will sending them to Antarctica make
children safer? No. Treatment will.''
<p>
   Priests at Our Lady's Hall get counseling, Walsh says, but he is
unsure of the extent of it, or whether it occurs on site. ``It
probably depends on the case, and because of their privacy rights,
I couldn't talk about that anyway,'' he says.
<p>
   Silence and denial have been the two greatest obstacles to
combating child abuse, especially among the clergy. The Catholic
Church insists it is no longer in denial, but  &MD;  for reasons it can
legally defend  &MD;  the silence continues.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The highest-ranking U.S. diplomatic official in
Taiwan abruptly resigned his post last week, as federal
investigators investigated a possible role in soliciting Democratic
campaign contributions from Taiwanese businessmen, officials said
Tuesday.
<p>
   James Wood, a former Arkansas lawyer and Clinton appointee, left
his post shortly after federal agents searched his offices in
Virginia and Taipei, reviewing documents and other paperwork, a
source familiar with the investigation told the Globe.
<p>
   Wood had virtually no foreign policy experience when President
Clinton named him to the post in 1995. Since then, he has been
derided by followers of the U.S. diplomatic corps for his handling
of Taiwan-U.S. relations, and criticized further amid more recent
allegations that he played an important role in raising Asian money
for Clinton's reelection campaign.
<p>
   The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, confirmed
Tuesday that Wood had resigned as of last Friday. ``His resignation
has been accepted,'' Burns said.
<p>
   Wood officially served as the chairman of the American Institute
in Taiwan. The U.S. United States does not officially recognize
Taiwan, and thus does not have an embassy or ambassador in Taipei.
The American Institute, a federally funded, nonprofit corporation
that operates under the authority of the U.S. secretary of state,
serves as the primary diplomatic channel to Taipei and functions
like embassies in other capitals, with its chairman serving as an
unofficial U.S. ambassador. Wood split his time between the
institute's offices in Virginia and Taiwan.
<p>
   A woman who answered the telephone at the institute's suburban
Virginia office said, ``I'll transfer you to his former
secretary.'' When the person answered, she said, ``I don't know how
to reach him.''
<p>
   The FBI began investigating Wood last fall, according to the
source knowledgeable about the inquiry. In October, Newsweek
magazine reported that senior Taiwanese officials had complained
that Wood was pressuring Taiwanese businessmen for contributions to
Clinton's reelection campaign.
<p>
   The magazine reported that Wood had told business executives
that Clinton deserved to be ``rewarded'' for granting a U.S.
visitor's visa to President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, then steered
potential contributors to John Huang, who traveled to Taiwan
periodically while raising funds for the Democratic National
Committee.
<p>
   Huang's activities on behalf of the DNC have stirred intense
controversy over Democratic fund-raising last year. The entire
issue is under review by Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
<p>
   In his only public comments to date, Wood, asked if he urged
Taiwanese businessmen to give money to Huang, told Newsweek, ``That
could have happened.'' But, he added, he ``couldn't recall.''
<p>
   Tuesday, analysts welcomed Wood's resignation as a boon to U.S.
policy in Asia. Many followers of U.S. Asian policy noted that Wood
was the first appointment to that post who had no ability to speak
the language. Those who came before him, analysts said, were senior
members of the U.S. diplomatic corps schooled in Asian policy.
<p>
   Other critics maintained that Wood had lied to members of
Congress after his appointment by saying he had helped create the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Wood's critics said U.S. officials
involved in the measure had never heard of him.
<p>
   Harvey Feldman, a Heritage Foundation analyst and a former State
Department official under Jimmy Carter who helped shape the Taiwan
Relations Act, said Wood had misled senators in 1995 when he told
them he was one of the authors of the Taiwan law.
<p>
   ``I and others pointed out that he was making claims for which
he was not entitled,'' Feldman said. ``As far as anyone was aware
in senior positions at the time, until he surfaced ... we had never
heard of him.''
<p>
   ``There is very little good to say,'' added Steve Yates, another
Heritage Foundation analyst. ``He was one of the most clearly
political appointments made in the foreign realm. He had extremely
little background.''
<p>
   The position of chairman of the American Institute does not
require Senate confirmation, officials said. The Senate is
consulted on the nominee, and individual senators are free to raise
objections. Apparently, no senator raised significant objections.
<p>
   But soon after Wood took his post, members of the diplomatic
corps expressed displeasure, particularly in light of the
sometimes-strained relations between the United States and China.
<p>
   ``There was a lot of doubt among people who are familiar with
U.S.-Taiwan-People's Republic of China relations,'' said Ralph
Klough of the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns
Hopkins in Washington. ``He hadn't had a lot of experience to deal
with this situation. His predecessors had been foreign service
officers with a lot of experience. They were very senior people.''

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Travelers Group Inc. said it
would buy back as much as $1 billion of stock and increase its
dividend 33 percent, sending the insurance and financial services
company's shares to an all-time high.
<p>
   Travelers stock rose 2 1/4, or 4.4 percent, to a record 53 1/2
in trading of 1.9 million shares, exceeding its recent daily
trading average of 1.3 million shares by midday.
<p>
   ``The board feels confident about the future,'' said Jeffrey
Lane, vice chairman of Travelers. ``We are generating enormous
amounts of cash flow.'' Z]4 The buyback represents as much as 18.7
million shares at today's price, or about 3 percent of the 639
million shares outstanding. Repurchases will meet demands of
Travelers' employee stock option and other benefit programs, the
company said.
<p>
   Travelers' board voted to increase the company's quarterly
dividend to 15 cents-a-share from 11.25 cents. It's payable on Feb.
21 to investors who held the shares on Feb. 3.

   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business

worried that lagging sales of its mainframes and computer chips

company reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that trailed
expectations. Shares earlier touched 155 and accounted for 29
points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 40.03 point drop.
<p>
   IBM stock had surged to nine-year highs on optimism for strong
growth in all its businesses. IBM said late yesterday that sales of
computer hardware edged up just 2 percent as corporations bought
networks of personal computers rather than IBM's hallmark
mainframes. IBM also joined Computer Associates International Inc.
and Oracle Corp. in blaming dismal sales in Europe for
disappointing results.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' said
John Rutledge, an analyst at Boston's Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ``The
bloom is off the rose.''
<p>
   IBM's net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, from
$1.71 billion, or $3.09 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. The
results were slightly below the $3.96 a share average estimate from
15 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. Several analysts
expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their earnings estimates for IBM's
1997 earnings.
<p>
   Others expressed concern about IBM's stock.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   European companies are spending less than half the amount that
U.S. and Asian firms spend on technology. That, coupled with weak
economies in some countries, will continue to hurt computer and
software companies, analysts said.
<p>
   Oracle said last month that weakness in Europe hurt its results,
and Computer Associates said yesterday that European sales fell 21
percent. IBM's sales in Europe were unchanged from a year ago at
$8.1 billion.
<p>
   IBM's hardware sales rose to $11.7 billion, with personal
computer sales rising from the year-ago quarter in both corporate
products and home machines. System 390 mainframe sales declined and
RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from year-earlier levels.

 &UR; THE EVIDENCE AGAINST GINGRICH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS OLIPHANT &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- In one of the hundreds of documents made public
over the inaugural weekend in Newt Gingrich's ethics case, one
stands out for both its probative and personal value.
<p>
   In the speaker's own hand, it shows a stick figure in the
middle. On the left, arrows show all things flowing to him; on the
right, arrows show all things flowing from him.
<p>
   At the bottom, Gingrich has written: ``A pattern rather than a
single point.''
<p>
   For the Dennis Rodman of Congress, the evidentiary value is
obvious. There was no compartmentalization of any of Gingrich's
various legislative, political and personal activities. Because
there wasn't, rules and possibly laws that nearly everyone in
politics obeys routinely were not so much broken as shattered.
<p>
   The diagram of Gingrich Inc. does not require a psychologist for
further analysis, moreover. To say that the speaker has a bit of an
ego problem  &MD;  other documents also show him in the center of
various universes  &MD;  is classic understatement and a continual
precursor to the attitude that rules are for other, lesser souls.
<p>
   That Gingrich behaved with impunity is now established fact. The
fact that the perpetrator turned out to be the pol who made such a
big deal two years ago about applying laws to Congress that apply
to real people is at least ironic.
<p>
   Ever since special counsel James Cole's summary of the evidence
in this case was made public, discerning readers of the national
press will have noted words and phrases like ``surprising'' or
``surprisingly strong'' in the descriptions of it.
<p>
   In journalism, these are usually code words for previous
ignorance. In this case, they are also code for information that
went completely against the factually challenged conventional
wisdom that had previously prevailed.
<p>
   For roughly two years, the ethics case has supposedly been about
a college course and its financing, and then (after last September)
also about whether Gingrich had misled the House's ethics committee
during its investigation.
<p>
   Up until Friday afternoon this case was supposed to be
hopelessly partisan, possibly hopelessly snagged and likely to
result in an ugly fight this week on the House floor.
<p>
   Then Jim Cole opened his mouth and his files for the first time,
whereupon the atmosphere was completely transformed. For a change,
the evidence spoke instead of the spin doctors. For a change,
evidence produced a bipartisan result that was both mature,
justified and, for the moment (at least until the next case or
until the Internal Revenue Service rules on this one), dispositive.
<p>
   Cole's summary of the facts  &MD;  written, spoken and documentary  &MD; 
made three things clear above all:
<p>
    &MD; This was not about a college course as such, but about the
funding of Gingrich's ambitious national political operation. Short
of cash, he himself hit upon the idea of getting more money by
attracting donors with the prospect of giving tax-deductible
contributions.
<p>
   About $1.5 million that the committee could identify was raised
in this fashion, employing dormant foundations similar to the way
financial scams use ``shell'' corporations. Several checks, made
out to the foundations which in turn wrote checks back to
Gingrich's major political committee, were identified, and donors
confirmed that they were solicited for politics, not charity.
<p>
    &MD; Gingrich told the ethics subcommittee and Cole at least three
directly conflicting things about his activities.
<p>
   At the outset, when he was seeking quick dismissal of all
charges, he acknowledged some commingling of his political and
educational lives. During the investigation itself, he denied using
tax-deductive money for political purposes. And then, confronted
with the evidence that he did, he confessed.
<p>
    &MD; The case was plea-bargained. The investigating subcommittee,
its documents show, was prepared to say it had reason to believe
that Gingrich flouted the tax laws and either knew or should have
known he was giving false information to the ethics unit.
<p>
   But to avoid months of evidentiary hearings, Gingrich agreed to
admit to softened charges of what amounts to recklessness in his
political fund-raising and the provision of false and misleading
evidence, fudging the issue of intent.
<p>
   On the $300,000 penalty, Cole blew away another morsel of GOP
spin. It had nothing to do with reimbursing the ethics committee;
instead, it reflected his and the subcommittee's judgment that
Gingrich's offenses fell between those requiring a formal reprimand
(for ``serious'' rules violations) and those calling for censure
(``more serious'' violations).
<p>
   As such, the idea was to make the point by adding something to
the reprimand. At the same time (Democrats finally noted), the
purpose was to leave Gingrich's future to his own judgment and that
of his Republican colleagues.
<p>
   What formally unfolded yesterday displayed the power of evidence
over politics, of rigorous investigation over sound bites.
<p>
   Whitewater fanatics might want to take note, but they probably
won't.

<p>
   Charlotte, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) --NationsBank
Corp. set a 2-for-1 stock split and said it expects to continue to
post strong financial results.
<p>
   The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said the stock split
will be paid Feb. 27 to shareholders of record Feb. 7.
<p>
   ``The stock split underscores the board's confidence that our
strong performance will continue,'' said Chief Executive Hugh
McColl in a statement.
<p>
   The shares rose 2 1/8 to 108 7/8 in early afternoon trading of
952,700, compared with the three-month daily average of 1.02
million. Earlier, shares touched a record high of 109.
<p>
   Last week, NationsBank said fourth-quarter net income rose 24
percent to $632 million, or $2.19 a share. Earnings exceeded
expectations of $2.13 a share, based on a survey of 27 analysts by
Zacks Investment Research.
<p>
   Companies generally split their stock when it rises to more than
$100 a share, analysts have said. The move makes it easier for
small investors to buy and sell shares.
<p>
   ``It also makes it more attractive for individual investors to
purchase shares and thus broaden the ownership base of the
company.'' said McColl.
<p>
   On Jan. 7, NationsBank bought St. Louis-based Boatmen's
Bancshares Inc. for $9.76 billion in stock and cash, to create the
nation's fourth-largest bank. It now operates 2,500 branches across
16 states from Maryland to New Mexico and has $225 billion in
assets.
<p>
   NationsBank shares have risen 28 percent since the acquisition
was announced Aug. 30.

   Shows that run on cable channels don't attract nearly the same
size audiences as programs on the major networks. While the
mainstream networks reach just about every home that has a
television set, fledgling cable channels like Animal Planet, a
spinoff of Discovery Channel, are launched with only a few million
subscribers.
<p>
   Building viewer loyalty is a challenge, especially with
programming that relies on reruns of specials, movies and
documentaries. Many cable channels have decided that one of the
best ways to keep viewers coming back is to borrow a page from the
network playbook: original series programming.
<p>
   So, in these weeks and months of TV's midseason, a couple dozen
new series are coming to cable (or have already arrived), from a
reincarnated ``Lassie'' to a reincarnated ``Robin Hood.'' Here's a
rundown on some of them.
<p>
   Animal Planet
<p>
    &MD;  ``Lassie: Best Friends Are Forever.'' One of the biggest icons
in TV history returns in a brand new series, complete with a new
Timmy. Premieres March 1.
<p>
   Bravo
<p>
    &MD;  ``Profiles.'' This is a series consisting of acquired and
original documentaries about artists at work. Among those to be

interview before his death. Premieres in April.
<p>
   Comedy Central
<p>
    &MD;  ``Comics on Delivery.'' Got a problem? Call a comedian to help
you out of it. Seriously. Well, not so seriously, but this is
really the premise. It's a sort of help line for people who need
assistance going to the dentist, buying a car, breaking up with a
lover, etc. Already premiered. Check local listings.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Viva Variety.'' Basically a European-style variety show with
novelty acts, celebrity guests, live music  &MD;  the sort of stuff Ed
Sullivan used to present. Premiere TBA.
<p>
   Court TV
<p>
    &MD;  ``Cochran &AMP; Grace.'' Johnnie Cochran, O.J. Simpson's former
defense attorney, teams with Nancy Grace, a former prosecutor in
Atlanta, for a nightly debate on legal issues. Already premiered.
Check local listings.
<p>
   Discovery Channel
<p>
    &MD;  ``Discovery News.'' In this weekly science newscast, Discovery
Channel teams with ABC News to investigate and report on the
scientific angles behind the headlines. An anchor hasn't been
chosen yet; ABC News correspondents will contribute segments to the
broadcast. Premieres April 4.
<p>
    &MD;  ``New Detectives.'' This series will examine the science and
forensics involved in criminal investigations. Each one-hour
episode will focus on a particular procedure, such as using DNA
evidence found at the crime scene. Premieres April 1.
<p>
   HBO
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Chris Rock Show.'' The former ``Saturday Night Live''
cast member, whose HBO special last summer won rave reviews, tries
his hand at a weekly, half-hour, late-night show, featuring a
topical monologue, guests from entertainment, news, sports,
publishing and other fields, and a musical performance. Premieres
Feb. 7.
<p>
   E! Entertainment TV
<p>
    &MD;  ``Model.'' A documentary-style series chronicling the personal
and professional lives of the world's top fashion models, it will
have its first broadcast Sunday during a nine-hour ``Supermodel
Sunday'' marathon. The first model profiled: Naomi Campbell.
Premieres Sunday.
<p>
   The Learning Channel
<p>
    &MD;  ``Danger Zone.'' What possesses firefighters and stunt workers
to go to work every day? This documentary series takes a look at
people who have dangerous, often life-threatening jobs. Premieres
April 1.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Legends of the Isles.'' Was Robin Hood a draft-dodger? Was
Richard the Lionheart really French, not English? This weekly
series uses historical documents, expert analysis and recreations
to separate history from myth. Premieres April 4.

numerology column. Toss in information on tarot cards, herbs and
crystals, and you've got ``Pandora.'' Premieres Friday.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Wire.'' Where ``Pandora'' gives you the back of the
magazine, ``The Wire'' presents the rest of it. Hosted by a group
of young experts, ``The Wire'' offers up information on lifestyle
and travel, hairstyle trends, makeup, careers and fashion.
Premieres Friday.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Three Blind Dates.'' Three couples set out on blind dates,
and the camera follows along, capturing the anxiety, the despair
and the occasional match made in heaven. Premieres Friday.

 &UR; HARSH LESSONS FOR A DAUGHTER OF NIGERIA &LR;  &QL;

c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   ARLINGTON, Va.  &MD;  During her sophomore year at Harvard, Hafsat
Abiola designed her own major. She wanted to combine her interests
in economics, politics and history so she could study her homeland,
Nigeria, from a distance.
<p>
   The more she researched, she knew, the more she would learn
about Nigeria's horrors, including military coups, human rights
abuses and political assassinations.
<p>
   But she had no inkling that the most devastating lessons would
soon involve her own family.
<p>
   In 1993, just before Abiola started her junior year, her father,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, was elected president of Nigeria. Six months
later, when he tried to assume power, the military annulled the
election and jailed him. He was thrown into solitary confinement,
unable to see a lawyer, send letters or read a newspaper. He
remains in prison, and his family has no idea how he's doing.
<p>
   And last summer, as Abiola's mother, Kudirat, campaigned for his
release, she was gunned down on a street in Lagos, Nigeria's
capital.
<p>
   In the fall, Abiola, 22, didn't just come back for her last
semester of college, she came back with a gusto that surprised even
her friends. She has handed in her 122-page thesis, and this month
she'll take her final exams. Her adviser predicts Abiola will
graduate with honors  &MD;  a special distinction because her mother and
her grandmothers never got beyond high school.
<p>
   In between studying and keeping tabs on five younger brothers
and sisters, Abiola is setting up a foundation to honor her mother.
She might go to graduate school. But first she will go on a West
Coast tour for Amnesty International to speak out about repression
in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.
<p>
   This isn't what Abiola pictured when she arrived at college as
an 18-year-old freshman who consulted her father about every big
decision. Abiola laughs easily, and she breaks into a laugh as she
remembers how naive and carefree she was back in the fall of 1992.
``I figured I would get my degree, go home, get married to a
Nigerian who was a friend of the family and live five minutes from
my parents.''
<p>
   A privileged life
<p>
   Sitting in the apartment of her older brother, Lekar, during
winter break in Virginia, Abiola describes her family's estate in
Lagos. She mentions the gate in front, the sprawling house, the
tennis court and soccer field, the two pools, the three shifts of
security guards ...
<p>
   Just how many rooms does the house have?
<p>
   Abiola, who has spent two hours talking effortlessly about her
theories of development and democracy, is stumped. Her hair is tied
in tight braids. She thinks for a few seconds.
<p>
   ``Fifty rooms?'' she says, as if she's never considered the
question. ``Plus the guest house.''
<p>
   Abiola's father  &MD;  known as ``Chief Abiola''  &MD;  started as an
accountant at a hospital in Lagos, then served as the top executive
for IT&AMP;T in Africa and the Mideast. He also published newspapers,
ran agribusinesses and, according to Randy Echols, his lobbyist in
Washington, became Nigeria's leading distributor of both the Bible
and the Koran.
<p>
   The family expanded as Abiola took a total of four wives and
moved into the estate in Lagos. His daughter says money, real
estate and possessions mean little. Asked about memories of growing
up, she rhapsodizes about traveling with her father, talking
politics with up-and-coming leaders across Africa.
<p>
   ``It was a lot of fun to see my father interact with leaders,
but the best for me was when he would tell me about his childhood,
about how he had to carry firewood home and walk a long way to
school where he had to copy down everything because his family
didn't have money for books,'' Abiola said.
<p>
   ``Hafsat is quite remarkable, considering the stress she must be
under with her father in detention and her mother just killed,''
says Owens Saro-Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer who was
executed by the government in 1995. ``And it's wonderful that
someone with that background, a rich father and all the trappings
of wealth, is so committed to human rights and democracy.''
<p>
   When Abiola was 14, her family sent her to Phillips Academy in
Andover. She became president of a black students association and
ran track. To the horror of her schoolmates back in Nigeria, she
also joined a gay student group. She wasn't gay and she probably
was the only Muslim member. No matter. She believed passionately in
freedom.
<p>
   ``I didn't understand my country until I came to the United
States and started questioning so many things about Nigeria,''
Abiola says. ``You step away and say, `This doesn't seem right,
this doesn't seem fair.'''
<p>
   During her senior year at prep school, she was admitted to four
top colleges. She wanted to go to Georgetown University, but she
asked her father's advice.
<p>
   ``Let me think about it,'' he said. He called a day later and
said, ``Harvard.'' She smiles as she remembers that conversation.
The family likes to joke about the way her father makes a decision,
then pretends he needs time to think about it and eventually
announces his original decision.
<p>
   At dinner at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Abiola asked her
father what major he would recommend. He asked for time to think
that over.
<p>
   A few days later, a postcard arrived. ``Finance and computer
science,'' it said. She tried to follow his advice, but after a
couple of economics courses, she was frustrated. They were too
quantitative and theoretical. She wanted to mix in real-world
experiences, so she added politics and history and created her own
major.
<p>
   At Harvard, she didn't take long to make a mark.
<p>
   History professor Leroy Vail was teaching an honors course on
South Africa when he was struck by the maturity of Abiola, then a
freshman. A year later, Vail hosted a garden party at his house. He
looked out to see half the people transfixed, clustered around
Abiola as she gave an impromptu seminar on Nigeria.
<p>
   ``She's perhaps the most remarkable student I've known in 30
years of teaching,'' says Vail, now Abiola's thesis adviser. ``I
told her if she lived in a decent country, I could see her as the
first woman president.''
<p>
   Told of that, Abiola reacts the way she does to many
compliments: with an airy laugh. ``Professor Vail amuses me,'' she
says.
<p>
   A free election
<p>
   When Nigeria's dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, promised a free
election in 1993, Chief Abiola saw his chance to be elected
president. Dozens of relatives joined the campaign, so Hafsat
Abiola decided to stay at Harvard. She spent hundreds of dollars
calling back to Nigeria every month. The news was heartening. In
Nigeria, where regional and ethnic differences are sharp, polls
showed her father winning support from all groups  &MD;  even soldiers.

   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Speeches. Meetings. So many that it would be easy
for some players to roll their eyes when No. 92 says it might be a
good idea to get together and ``talk about a few things.''
<p>
   But, then again, consider the source. No. 92 might be talking
the talk as much as anyone down here. But oh, Lordy, has the man
walked the walk.
<p>
   Yes, he has. For 12 seasons. Perhaps better than anyone ever has
at his position. Oh, you can argue the point and trot out any Hall
of Famer you want to measure up with Reginald Howard White, and you
will be hard-pressed to find a better defensive lineman. Not now.
Maybe not ever.
<p>
   Which is why so much attention has been focused on White this
week as the Green Bay Packers count down their game-preparation
checklist for Sunday's Super Bowl against the Patriots.
<p>
   Call him what you want. The Minister of Defense. Rev. White
(which is accurate, since White is indeed an ordained, practicing
pastor). Or the biggest impact player to hit the Packers in a
generation, which coincidentally is how long it has been (29 years)
since they were in a Super Bowl.
<p>
   Or call him what teammate Don Beebe calls the 6-foot-5-inch,
300-pound, 35-year-old defensive end. ``This guy,'' said Beebe,
``is like God in pads. He's the most revered athlete I've ever been
around.''
<p>
   The Patriots will have to contend with the 11-time Pro Bowl
player Sunday.
<p>
   ``A lot of players fold their tent and can't react in big
games,'' said Patriots defensive end Willie McGinest, ``but he's
one of those players who has stepped up in the big games. He's one
of those impact players who has turned games around.''
<p>
   And teams. Four years ago, the Packers were one of those ``if
only'' teams when White decided that eight seasons in Philadelphia
without sniffing a Super Bowl were enough.
<p>
   He shopped himself around on what was only half-jokingly called
the Reggie White Traveling Ministry Tour before settling on a
four-year deal with Green Bay, feeling that the Packers had the
best chance to reach the ultimate prize.
<p>
   White's religious fervor has been well-documented, and although
he sometimes seems to push the boundary between belief and crusade
by saying things such as the Packers were meant to win the NFC
championship because that was the role God had cast for them, there
is nothing phony about him.
<p>
   Skepticism toward the Packers and toward White's beliefs has
been part of the package since he arrived in Green Bay. But he
rapidly converts the doubters.
<p>
   ``We still have a way to go,'' he said in Tuesday's dog and pony
show known as Super Bowl Media Day. ``I see a lot of guys on the
media jumping on the bandwagon now, when four years ago I somewhat
foresaw this and a lot of guys giggled and wrote certain type
stories. But my question is, what do you have to say now?''
<p>
   What can you say, except that White has helped will the Packers
past the roadblocks that kept them out the championship game since
1968?
<p>
   He is certainly not the only reason the Packers have emerged as
the best team in the NFC  &MD;  and, if you believe the oddsmakers, the
best team in football  &MD;  but he probably is the main one.
<p>
   Mike Holmgren, who has willingly accepted White's role as
surrogate coach, does not dispute the suggestion.
<p>
   ``Reggie is one of our best recruiters,'' said Holmgren,
explaining that when White chose the Packers as a free agent, it
legitimized Green Bay as a place where others might want to
continue their careers. ``They want him as a teammate. In this day
and age, I can assure you that he is the real thing. What he says,
he means.''
<p>
   White knows that, at 35, even with another Pro Bowl season under
his belt, one in which he led the Packers in sacks, he might not
get this far again. This might be his once chance to get the team
achievement to match the individual awards he has garnered.
<p>
   ``One thing we talked about my first year here,'' said White,
``is that if you go to the Super Bowl and win one as a Green Bay
Packer, it would be unlike any other thing that you've ever
experienced.''

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Dante Scarnecchia put to rest any concerns his
boss might have had about his suddenly restored constitutional
right to free speech with the first public utterance from his mouth
this season.
<p>
   ``Green Bay's got a great team,'' the Patriots' assistant coach
said Tuesday, tongue firmly planted in cheek. ``They got a great
quarterback. They got great running backs. They got great
receivers. They got a great defense. Great to see ya. See ya
later.''
<p>
   This is what the New England media has waited all year to hear?
<p>
   Since the arrival of Bill Parcells as head coach four years ago,
assistants have been treated like children in New England. On the
best of days, they were to be seen and not heard. If they needed an
opinion on anything, Parcells would gladly let them know what it
was.
<p>
   But once your team makes the Super Bowl, the wraps are off. Or,
in the case of the assistant coaches of the New England Patriots,
the duct tape comes off. The National Football League set them
free, free to put their foot in their mouth at will. America! What
a country!
<p>
   NFL rules mandate that all players and coaches at the Super Bowl
must endure three days of unparalleled media grilling. They must
field questions about their childhood transgressions and their
childhood triumphs. They are asked about their team, their players
and their boss.
<p>
   Upon occasion, they might even be asked to talk about the game.
<p>
   Could Parcells' silent majority stand up to the heat?
<p>
   Fear not, your Tunaship.
<p>
   ``I'd like to knock that one right out of the water,''
quarterbacks coach Chris Palmer deftly said when asked about a
swirling rumor that he will head to San Diego after the Super Bowl
to become Kevin Gilbride's offensive coordinator. ``That will have
to wait until after the Super Bowl.''
<p>
   In other words, maybe I is and maybe I isn't, but even if you
force bamboo shoots under my fingernails, I ain't talkin'. Parcells
would have been proud. So would the head of the KGB.
<p>
   Over in the corner stood special teams coach Mike Sweatman, who
seemed to be trying to maintain the code of omerta (silence or
death) as best he could by standing so far from the fray that he
easily could have been mistaken for someone in charge of team
security rather than special teams play.
<p>
   Small knots of knotheads with pen, paper and minicam encircled
offensive coordinator Ray Perkins, defensive coordinator Al Groh
and always affable assistant head coach Bill Belichick, who showed
immediately that a year of silence had done nothing to alter the
personality that reminded people in Cleveland of a porcupine in
earmuffs during his brief tenure there as head coach.
<p>
   Belichick has been rumored to be under consideration as the next
sacrificial lamb for Al Davis (which is known in some circles as
head coach of the Oakland Raiders); also, writers who knew him in
Cleveland have been trying for a year to find out what life is like
when you go from being the boss to working for the boss. With his
tongue now untied by NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Belichick
cleared the air.
<p>
   ``Cleveland guys and Oakland guys have been here for 30 minutes
with their bait out and I haven't bitten for it yet,'' Belichick
said.
<p>
   Is that any way for a gentleman from Wesleyan to talk?
<p>
   As the questions persisted about his comings (from Cleveland) or
his goings (to Oakland), Belichick chose to use another
constitutional amendment not cited lately in Foxborough  &MD;  the Fifth
Amendment. It's just called ``taking the Fifth'' when a Mafia Don
does it before a Congressional subcommittee. Suffice it to say,
it's not often combined with the First Amendment (free speech), but
these are unusual times in New England. The way things were going
Tuesday, civics teachers in the New Orleans school system should
have brought their students to the Superdome to watch the
Constitution in action right there on the 50-yard line.
<p>
   But halfway up in the stands, high above it all, sat Groh, a
quiet, intelligent man who took the line of least resistance. He
just listened to the questions fired at him and answered them
thoughtfully. He was not there to entertain or obfuscate. He was
there to do the best he could to help, answering questions about
his defense and how it has come to be one of the best in football
over the past seven weeks, and what it was like to work for
Parcells and with Belichick, who had once been his boss.
<p>
   He even told an anecdote or two about the peripatetic life of an
NFL assistant coach and what it can do to families and mortgages.
He was rather pleasant to listen to, quite frankly.
<p>
   What Groh could not answer he did not answer. What he could he
did. As Groh's performance made clear, this talking thing is really
not that difficult for an adult, as long as you don't view it as
the Spanish Inquisition.
<p>
   All it really is, is people asking people about football. It's
not people asking people about the nation's nuclear arsenal.
<p>
   At one point, when Groh was asked about scrappy reserve
linebacker Marty Moore, he even went so far as to engage his
questioner in conversation.
<p>
   ``You from Montana or Kentucky?'' Groh asked, assuming the
questioner had to be from one of those places to be interested in
Moore. ``Neither? Oh. It's just interesting at this point that I
get a Marty Moore question.''
<p>
   Groh went on to explain how tough a kid Moore is and how there
were more than a few NFL teams he could play for, and that there's
just no opportunity here for full-time work right now, even though
Moore is so well-prepared and does everything he's asked to do. In
other words, he put in a few good words for a good kid.
<p>
   Was this something that had to be banned in Boston for four
years? Considering what came out of the mouths of the 12 men who
work for Bill Parcells, it hardly seemed so.

 &UR; BUSINESS `LONG EAGLES' WHO NEST IN THE WEST &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE RAMSEY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Seattle Post-Intelligencer &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Philip Burgess, president of a Denver think tank, Center for the
New West, remembers the discovery a few years ago.
<p>
   He kept stumbling across people in rural areas doing their
business by telephone, fax and air express for clients far away.
When he ran across the New York stockbroker in rural Colorado, he
decided he was on to something.
<p>
   The broker explained that he moved out of New York after his
boy's bicycle was stolen for the third time and some miscreant
snatched his wife's purse. Life was a lot different in Colorado: a
lot better. Work was the same, though. He just did it over the
phone.
<p>
   Burgess dubbed such folks ``lone eagles.''
<p>
   Dick Larsen is a lone eagle. Originally a corporate guy who
worked at U.S. Steel and Ford Motor Co., he went to work as a
finance consultant. He helps draw up business plans to present to
lenders and financiers, and in sales and acquisitions of companies.
He could have done this work from San Francisco, where he was
living, but he decided he could also do it from Bend, Ore.
<p>
   ``It's not a business you're going to start from Bend,'' says
Larsen, 62. He couldn't have built up the knowledge and contacts
without years first in San Francisco and New York. But once he was
set up, there was no need to live in a big city.
<p>
   He moved to central Oregon 22 years ago. Real estate was cheap,
the air clean, ski slopes and fishing streams uncrowded. He lives
seven minutes from his office. He still spends a lot of time flying
off to see clients, but he'd have to do that wherever he lived.
<p>
   More and more Dick Larsens are living where they want. They are
brokers, engineers, consultants, sales reps, writers, artists and
even cottage manufacturers. And they are helping to transform the
West.
<p>
   ``Rural areas in the West have gone from decline in the '80s to
growing faster than the national average in the '90s,'' says
William Beyers, professor of geography at the University of
Washington. Beyers reports mini-booms in places such as Griggs,
Idaho, where Paul Allen has a ranch, and Montrose, Colo., just up
the road from the ``starter mansions'' of Telluride.
<p>
   On Beyers' map, the boom counties extend in a web of dark
splotches from the Canadian border to Mexico.
<p>
   In Washington state, the hot spots are in a swath from Port
Angeles east and north to Canada; Kittitas and Okanogan counties;
the areas around Pullman and Long Beach. But the growth is
everywhere. In the 1980s, only half the 27 rural counties had net
in-migration. In the first half of the 1990s, all of them did.
<p>
   The reason is not all lone eagles. Retirees are a big group, as
are manufacturers seeking cheap land. The lone eagles are of
particular interest because, in the geographer's taxonomy, they're
a new species.
<p>
   How many are there? Washington State University professors Don
Dillman and Priscilla Salant and graduate student Lisa Carley
surveyed driver's license applicants, and estimate that 2,600 lone
eagles move to Washington each year. How many move within the state
they don't know. They tend to be older, better educated and more
affluent than the average migrant. Most are self-employed. Sixty
percent earn more than $50,000 a year.
<p>
   These are ``very significant movements of high-quality wealth
creators,'' says Burgess of the Center for the New West.
<p>
   Why Washington? Almost all cited the natural environment,
including the climate and outdoor recreation. Next, cited by 65
percent, was personal safety. Third, 59 percent, mentioned lack of
a state income tax.
<p>
   About half the lone eagles moved to urban counties, where they
are lost in the aggregate of humanity. The half that moved to rural
counties are more significant.
<p>
   They bring urban incomes and urban tastes. They will not put up
with bad coffee, underfinanced libraries and Chinese restaurants
that offer up chop suey and egg foo yung. Though older, they are
early adopters of technology. Seventy-nine percent use fax
machines; 59 percent, modems; 66 percent, overnight mail; 31
percent, cell phones.
<p>
   ``Their entrance can help a whole community wire up'' to the
Internet, says Tim Sweeney, consumer policy specialist at the
Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
<p>
   Sweeney recently took a car trip across the West, and was amazed
at all the new houses. He thought, ``How do all these people make a
living?'' Not from mining, logging or sheep ranching.
<p>
   Salant, who helped run the WSU study, grapples with that
question, too. ``There are more ways than you might think,'' she
says. ``Lone eagles are only the most dramatic examples. People
say, `This is where I want to raise my child,' and they make it
work.''

<p>
   The election was held on June 12 of that year. Nigerians and
foreign observers alike agree that her father won a fair, two-way
race with 54 percent of the vote.
<p>
   Abacha never made the vote count public. He quickly annulled the
election.
<p>
   Chief Abiola went on a tour of Europe and the United States to
rally government support. At a three-hour dinner with the Abiolas
in Cambridge, Vail watched father and daughter exchange ideas.
Chief Abiola was smart, tough and passionate about Nigeria  &MD;  just
like his daughter.
<p>
   In June 1994, as Abiola claimed the office, the Nigerian
government arrested him for ``misrepresenting'' himself as the
president of the country. When students protested, they were beaten
and jailed. Abiola, who suffers hypertension, was confined to a
cell in an army base, denied visitors and not allowed his medicine.
<p>
   His oldest wife, Hafsat's mother, made the rounds of officials
and foreign embassies. In December 1994, Abiola's oldest children
were allowed to meet him in a warden's office. The visit lasted
only a few minutes. Hafsat and her brothers and sisters hugged
their father and said, ``We're proud of you.'' But they were
worried. They noticed that he looked disoriented and he limped  &MD; 
because he had been beaten by a guard, Hafsat says.
<p>
   Abiola's carefully phrased answers often make her sound older
than a 22-year-old. When she talks about her father, whom she calls
``Daddy,'' she sounds younger.
<p>
   ``My father is sweet and naive and nice,'' she says. ``That's
the reason why Abacha has chosen the right person. My father says,
`What has caused these people do do this? What can be done for
them?'''
<p>
   That 1994 visit was the last time any family members saw Chief
Abiola. Hafsat returned to Harvard and, to the amazement of her
friends, burrowed back into her studies.
<p>
   In November 1995, the regime executed Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
others from the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni people, who
had challenged oil companies. Saro-Wiwa had been a family friend,
and Hafsat Abiola was outraged. A few weeks later, she rented an
apartment near campus and took off the spring semester to campaign
for democracy in Nigeria. She got a taste of politics when she
testified before the New York City Council. As she had requested,
the council passed a resolution condemning Nigeria's regime.
<p>
   Last March, Abiola's mother was arrested for distributing
material critical of the regime. She was released after a day.
<p>
   At 4 a.m. on June 4, Abiola answered the phone.
<p>
   ``Did I wake you?'' a family friend in Washington said, adding,
``Go back to sleep. We'll talk later.''
<p>
   Abiola couldn't sleep. The friend told her to fly to Washington
immediately so they could talk face to face. Abiola had a
premonition that something had happened to her father. When she got
to Washington, she learned that her mother, Kudirat, had been shot
dead by three men in a passing car as she drove to a meeting at the
Canadian embassy in Lagos.
<p>
   Abiola and her siblings gathered at her older brother's
apartment in Virgina. They quickly agreed on their priorities.
First they would get their two youngest brothers out of the family
compound in Lagos and into the United States. Then they would
continue their studies, as their mother had wanted.
<p>
   Hafsat Abiola made an announcement: ``I'm going to take up
Mommy's work.''
<p>
   In Nigeria, the regime had rounded up about 20 of her cousins,
uncles and half-brothers, saying they were under investigation for
homicide. The Abiolas figured the government was trying to divide
the family. (The relatives were released without being charged.)
<p>
   A day after the killing, Hafsat Abiola spoke to CNN
International, the Voice of America and opposition radio in
Nigeria. ``If the military is really looking for the killer of my
mom, they should start by looking in the mirror,'' Abiola recalls
telling the network.
<p>
   During several conversations, Abiola is at a loss for words only
once, when remembering her mother. She talks about how loving her
mother was. About how she gave birth to nine children (two died in
infancy), educated herself and became a spokeswoman for justice in
Nigeria.
<p>
   Abiola pauses, brushes her eyes and then gets her composure
back. 
<p>
   Channeling her anger
<p>
   How does she do it? How does Abiola write a thesis about oil and
politics, keep up with her friends, watch over her younger siblings
and speak to community groups  &MD;  while grieving for her mother and
worrying about her father? That's the question Vail and others who
know Abiola have asked themselves.
<p>
   ``Even though I've known her for four years, I don't know her,''
Vail says. Romney Resney, Abiola's adviser during her freshman
year, puts it this way: ``Sure, she had frustrations about what was
going on in Nigeria and frustrations about being here, where people
don't have a clue about Nigeria. It would be easy to become angry
or shut down or withdraw. Instead, she has channeled it into trying
to raise awareness of what's going on.''
<p>
   Last November, on the one-year anniversary of the execution of
Saro-Wiwa, Abiola led a service for her mother in Memorial Chapel
in Harvard Yard. Hundreds of friends and Nigerian exiles showed up.
Abiola gave a stirring speech about her memories of her mother and
her hopes for Nigeria.
<p>
   Resney, who had studied leadership at the Kennedy School of
Government, watched Abiola in awe. ``I thought, my God, she has
everything that her father has, plus the poise of her mother. It
was just amazing.''
<p>
   Abiola says she draws strength from her large family. But
sometimes, she says, she feels pulled between two worlds, between
the traditions of West Africa and the freedom of the West.
<p>
   She no longer assumes she'll marry a family friend, or even a
Nigerian. Marriage isn't in her immediate plans, anyway. There's
work to be done and she has to watch over her siblings (the two
youngest brothers live with her older brother in Virginia, and the
other brothers and sisters are studying in several states).
<p>
   Would she let her husband have several wives?
<p>
   ``I think that it's fine for my husband to have several wives so
long as he allows me to have several husbands,'' she quips. Then
she explains that polygamy dates back to the days when people lived
in the countryside of Nigeria. With urbanization, the practice is
dying out.
<p>
   Several relatives have warned Abiola that she is courting
trouble by being so outspoken. They advise her to be more demure.
<p>
   ``I tell them, `I'm going to think about that, and I'm going to
let you know,''' she says. ``Of course, I've already made up my
mind.''

<p>
   OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Super Bowl fever sweeps a city, the
party is grand, but the hangover can be massive.
<p>
   In 1995, this city embraced its prodigal pro football team,
which had abandoned Oakland for the glitzier pastures of Los
Angeles. Al Davis, guiding genius and chief travel agent of the
Oakland Raiders, has struck gold twice here. After 13 seasons in
LA, he returned to open arms and open wallets.
<p>
   Could they expand the stadium, build luxury boxes and spiff up
the infrastructure without taxpayer funds? ``No problem!'' chorused
the politicians of Oakland and Alameda County. Fans will grab the
tab.
<p>
   Every Raiders rooter would eagerly purchase a ``Personal Seat
License,'' costing between $250 and $4,000 for a 10-year lease on a
stadium seat. Politicians pictured a waiting list longer than the
Bay Bridge.
<p>
   At first, PSLs sold quickly, but sales soon became as sluggish
as the Raider offense stalled at 35,000 in a 62,500-seat stadium.
In Oakland, PSL came to mean Pretty Serious Losses.
<p>
   Last week, while its school board was admitting Oakland's
failure to teach its students English, the departing city manager
forecast a budget deficit of $16 million. By grim coincidence, the
city's tab for the PSL, including cost overruns on rebuilding
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, is $15 million so far.
<p>
   ``Could we put the $15 million into the budget?'' asked the
chairman of the City Council's budget committee. ``Yes, but that
wouldn't solve the Coliseum problem.''
<p>
   A key ingredient in hangovers is denial. While the city holds
the bag, the city's establishment suffers from amnesia. In the
summer of 1995, The Oakland Tribune called itself ``The Official
Newspaper of Oakland Raiders Fans.'' The slogan was either printed
in disappearing ink or spiked because of the paper's other slogan,
``Friend of the People It Serves.'' Today, the Tribune's most
visible link with the Raiders is not boosterism but a flood of
classified ads from fans trying to dump their ducats, average price
$51.
<p>
   Davis himself is a sloganeer, coining ``Commitment to
Excellence'' and ``Just Win, Baby,'' phrases that once intimidated
opponents. But it has been XIV Super Sundays since the Raiders
reached the big bowl. In today's NFL, free agency helps Carolina
and Jacksonville prevail over silver-and-black tradition. The
Raiders scare only lonely PSL tailgaters.
<p>
   In a downward spiral, a so-so team means few sellouts, which
means no televised home games, an eroding fan base and well-soaked
taxpayers. Corporate sponsorship is skimpy. Bay Area businesses
neither fill the skyboxes nor pony up to baptize the place Clorox
Coliseum or Levi Strauss Stadium.
<p>
   Davis heeded his own slogans before making the deal, skimming
excellent returns off the top: $22 million from PSL sales and $32
million from city and county bonds. When the city and county
started to choke on the shortfall, Davis was serene. ``They asked
me to come back and I did,'' he said. ``I didn't do anything
wrong.''
<p>
   In Boston, there's nothing wrong with a stadium that won't harm
vital neighborhoods, damage the quality of life or drain valuable
resources. In Boston, the most precious of these is land. Alameda
County is 738 square miles; Boston's Suffolk County is 59 square
miles. The stadium here is five miles from downtown, analogous in
Boston to the old state hospital grounds in Mattapan, OK for most
fans but dicey for the skybox crowd.
<p>
   A stadium launched by Super Bowl fever can mean empty seats and
full remorse, as Gail Steele, head of Alameda County's Board of
Supervisors, has admitted:
<p>
   ``There is no question we overestimated the potential for
success of this whole agreement.... We were listening to the fans
who wanted the Raiders back in town. We were listening to the
marketing consultants who told us it would be an easy sellout.
Maybe we made a big mistake.''

<p>
   My recent column on the dismal graduation rates of
African-American players on many college football teams brought
requests for a detailed comparison from readers, including those
who were shocked that Florida and Ohio State, the first- and
second-ranked teams in the country, were so bad.
<p>
   The following lists are from the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Division 1 graduation rates report for 1996. The rates
cover athletes who received some form of athletic aid who entered
school during the 1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90 school
years, giving the schools at least six years to graduate them and
four straight classes by which to judge a school's consistency.
<p>
   One lawyer from Florida said that I singled out Florida coach
Steve Spurrier unfairly as a prime academic offender. Of the 36
teams that participated in the bowls, Florida was in the bottom 10
of overall team graduations and African-American graduations. It
was in the top 10 for graduation gaps between African-American and
white players and between African-American players and the general
student body.
<p>
   Spurrier became coach in 1990. The reader said Spurrier could
not be held responsible for Florida's rates because they cover only
athletes recruited before he was hired.
<p>
   Because of the way the NCAA compiles reports, it will take until
2000 before there are rates for which Spurrier is completely
responsible. But he remains at least mathematically 75 percent
responsible for the players he had for three of their possible four
years of eligibility (1989-90 entering class), 50 percent
responsible for those he had for two seasons and 25 percent
responsible for those he knew only in their final year of
eligibility.
<p>
   That takes us back to the 1987-88 season, which covers most of
the current report and makes Spurrier significantly responsible for
the graduation of his players.
<p>
   If graduation rates under Spurrier, who makes $1.1 million a
year in salary, shoot up, fine. But there are few signs that the
worst schools, including Florida, put books before the weight room.
<p>
   The lists (Army and Navy do not give athletic scholarships but
are included in some of the lists based on their overall graduation
rates):

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  My friend Dennis is about to give up the car he
has driven for 21 years, a 1967 Volvo. Although he has a new
Oldsmobile lined up to take its place, he is having some difficulty
saying goodbye to his shapely first love  &MD;  shapely, anyway, in
Dennis' eyes.
<p>
   Where I see a sluggish engine, worn upholstery, a body like a
Husqvarna sewing machine, Dennis sees  &MD;  what? Twenty-one years of
Swedish massage?
<p>
   I find this emotional attachment to a vehicle mystifying, but
then, I have never owned a car. Indeed, at age 44, I have never had
a driver's license. Nor has my wife.
<p>
   We have spent our lives on foot  &MD;  or on buses, in taxis, in the
back seat of other people's cars.
<p>
   Thus have we bypassed whole segments of the American experience:
the family drive, the traffic jam, the used car lot, the
treasure-filled garage. Our friends think us deprived, but since
these things have never been a part of our lives, we are like those
people born deaf who don't miss music.
<p>
   I'll admit not having a car probably impeded my romantic
development. It's true, I didn't see a lot of action in that regard
until I left my small hometown and began living in big cities where
one's sexual identity was not so closely linked to the size of
one's transportation.
<p>
   (I did date a girl in high school for awhile. We walked most
places and occasionally she drove, a situation so perverse in its
social dynamics  &MD;  at that time, in that place  &MD;  that it doomed our
relationship. She couldn't bear the strain of automotive role
reversal. It was as if I had asked to borrow her underwear.)
<p>
   Once I got out of Missouri, however, my luck improved.
Fortunately, I was not attracted to girls who salivated over chrome
and steel, but to oddballs like myself who enjoyed, for example,
striking out on foot in a lashing rain. I remember the thrill of
kinship when, on my first date with the oddball I would marry, I
suggested we grab a taxi and she replied, ``Why don't we walk?''
<p>
   No doubt a practical case may be made for not owning a car.
Certainly, we have saved a fortune on monthly payments, insurance,
gas and oil, parking, mechanic's fees, traffic tickets, bridge
tolls and those little dogs with bobbing heads.
<p>
   On the other hand, we have put a lot of money into shoes. You
can argue it from a health standpoint, from an environmental
standpoint and from the standpoint of resistance to America's
corporate culture. But to be truthful, I am a walker not for any
enlightened motive, but because I missed out on the vehicular gene.
<p>
   I walk for the same reason gibbons traverse the treetops hand to
hand  &MD;  it's the way I have always gotten around. Which is why, in
the years ahead, I expect I'll continue down this road less
traveled  &MD;  in my case, not a road at all, but a footpath.

   BELMONT, Mass. Right now many of you might be nursing a second
cup of coffee or tea, huddled cozily at your kitchen table, the
newspaper spread out before you. But let this serve as a reminder
that the youth hockey world, unlike any other in youth sports, is
already rockin' and rollin', and for one particular suburban family
that means five pairs of arms and legs intersecting, a crazy
patchwork of hockey mania moving frenetically from beds to the
breakfast table to that gangly climb into hockey pants and other
paraphernalia hanging down there in the basement.
<p>
   It's the Courtney Five  &MD;  count 'em.
<p>
   Five skaters in search of a rink.
<p>
     ``I've got healthy lungs,'' jokes Dotty Courtney, mother of
this brood, the time-keeper and cheerleader who keeps the three
girls and two boys moving from their sleep time to their ice time,
an undertaking that in the next 48 hours will take all or parts of
this family's hockey enterprise to six different rinks in greater
Boston.
<p>
   The lifestyle of the stick and skate crowd is a maddening load
of expenses, equipment, logistics and cold weather that makes the
youth baseball and soccer scene seem lightweight.
<p>
   In fact, by the close of the weekend, Hockey Five-O will log
about 11 hours of ice time, a figure that does not include
commuting and dressing time. It opens this morning with
recreational hockey for the three girls at the Belmont rink, while
9-year-old Ricky peels off to West Roxbury for a Mite's game at
7:30 a.m., followed by practice at 12:30 in Concord for 14-year-old
Sarah, a 2:30 p.m. game in Acton for 11-year-old Kathryn and
15-year-old Elizabeth, a second practice for Sarah in Concord at
6:20 p.m. and then 12-year-old Mikey's Pee Wee game at 7:30 p.m. at
Cleveland Circle. (Piano lessons for the girls somehow occur during
mid-afternoon.) Tomorrow opens with recreational hockey in town, a
game at 1:50 p.m in Watertown for Kathryn and Elizabeth and then,
in the weekend's finale, Sarah's bantam game in Concord at 2:50
p.m.
<p>
   Whew. There are hockey families, and then there are hockey
families. ``It keeps the kids busy,'' deadpans ``Big Mike,'' their
dad, a dentist, standing now in the kitchen with ``Little Mike''
dressing up for an afternoon game, and the other kids attired in
all or part of their own hockey gear. ``It can get a little bit
difficult, all the time involved.''
<p>
   Elizabeth makes a face. These hockey mornings are madcap, kids
grabbing bagels or granola bars on the run. ``We haven't had
breakfast together for like three years,'' she smiles.
<p>
   Hockey runs in the family. The kids' grandfather, Tom Courtney,
who grew up in Cambridge, played for that city's high school team.
Their father played in Belmont, as did their uncle. (Their dad,
Mike Courtney, adds modestly, ``I wasn't very good; my older
brother, he was the one.'') Their four cousins also play, and one
of them  &MD;  yet another Mike in the family  &MD;  is the captain and a
high-scoring forward, nicknamed ``Sniper,'' on this year's high
school squad.
<p>
   ``I used to take the kids skating,'' explains Mike Courtney,
about how his own kids got started. They'd also go to see their
older cousins play in games, and, recalls Dotty Courtney, ``Grampa
would always say, Mikey, when are you going to start.
<p>
   ``I always got the feeling that it was kind of expected of the
boys in the family to play,'' says Dotty. Mikey, now 12, was indeed
the one who broke the ice, joining Belmont Rangers Hockey as a
kindergartner eight years ago. But he was soon followed by sister
Sarah, and then, says their mother, ``One by one they all became
interested and joined a team.''
<p>
   Elizabeth, the oldest, was the last, and she decided to play  &MD; 
gulp  &MD;  goalie. Mentioning that position causes Dotty Courtney to
pause. In baseball or soccer, you outfit the kids in cleats, a bat,
a glove and a ball, then toss in between $30 and $50 in
registration fees. Hockey means rink time, which has to be paid
for, and the programs need to charge big money to cover that. This
season alone the Courtneys have paid out about $2,500 in hockey
fees. It's an investment that does not include the cost of
equipment  &MD;  $200 for a good pair of skates, the shoulder pads, the
pants, the shinguards and elbow pads. The priciest position is
goalie, and to equip Elizabeth this year in new netminder gear cost
about $1,200  &MD;  gulp.
<p>
   ``I don't want to even think about it,'' says Dotty. There is no
shortage of ideas for birthday and holiday presents, with helmets
and hockey gloves under this year's Christmas tree.
<p>
   The kids belong to a town program that has about 200 kids
skating for it, from mites to midgets (kindergarteners to
teen-agers), and the Belmont squads play other teams in either the
Greater Boston League or the Yankee Conference League, involving
about 3,800 skaters in all. The family's ties to hockey encompass
Mike Courtney's working the bench as assistant coach on one of the
kids' team, and Dotty Courtney's serving on the boards of both
Belmont Ranger Hockey and The Friends of Belmont Hockey, which
supports the high school teams.
<p>
   The season? ``It never ends, actually,'' says Dotty, describing
a hockey life that starts in September and runs into March and
includes a couple weeks toward the end of the summer for hockey
camp, which all the kids attend.
<p>
   ``This is our life,'' she jokes, pulling down a poster-sized
calendar hanging on the door from the kitchen to the cellar, each
day noting one hockey commitment or another. ``My famous saying is,
if it's not on the calendar then it doesn't exist.
<p>
   During the winter, a typical week involves, for each kid-player,
at least two practices and one or two games, or a family total of
about 30 hours of ice time. But there's actually even more.
Elizabeth, as goalie for the girls varsity team, practices daily
and also logs another six hours as one of the on-ice guards at the
town rink during the public skating sessions.
<p>
   The holidays are another matter, a time of tournaments and extra
practices, so that during late December Ricky Courtney's team was
playing three consecutive days in the Belmont Hockey Classic, with
Ricky, little number 7, scooting around the ice, his name
emblazoned on the back of his Mite's jersey, looking to pass the
puck to teammates like Drew Davidson, who scored late in the game
on a breakaway, and Zach Croy, another of the team's quick-skating
forwards. ``We were scared at the beginning of the game,'' Ricky
recalled after his team had won the opening contest, ``because our
goalie wasn't there. But he showed up at the last minute and we
were OK.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, older brother Mikey skated on the right wing during
his Pee Wee team's quest in an eight-team holiday tournament,
culminating in a championship game on New Year's Day. The family
zigs and zags around the region, piling into their shiny new white
Suburban, five kids and five hockey bags.
<p>
   How do they make ends meet, timewise?
<p>
   ``The list,'' says Dotty. Then with added emphasis, she repeats,
``The list!'' Each Friday, she explains, she studies the upcoming
jam of weekend hockey, makes a list of all the games and practices,
and then divides the duty with her husband: ``We write it all down
and split it in half.''
<p>
   Even with all the running around, she notes importantly, ``We
both make most of the games.''
<p>
   To be sure, the hockey crowd can have its rough edges  &MD;  the
bellowing from hyperactive parents and fans who stalk the sidelines
of any kid sport, but especially in hockey. (In fact, a Belmont
high school hockey contest against visiting Danvers, played one
night following one of Ricky Courtney's games, was marred by a
brawl that required a Belmont police response.)
<p>
   Then there are the parents of the '90s who complain about the
scheduling demands of any of the youth sports, never mind hockey
and never mind having five kids who play. But the Courtneys are
clearly devoted, all aboard for Ricky's game, the girls roaming the
rink and Mikey hanging out with his friends, parents Mike and Dotty
standing up in the bleachers, dressed carefully for the occasion in
their insulated boots, gloves, sweaters and heavy coats, because
they know  &MD;  oh, do they know  &MD;  that Belmont's is one of the coldest
ice rinks around.
<p>
   ``It's not like I think they'll ever play professional,'' says
Mike. ``They have fun.'' And of course there's plenty more to come,
as Dotty flips ahead through the calendar for the winter months,
already marked up with times and places for games and tournaments
that will take the family to the Cape and beyond, including Sarah's
team trip to Montreal at Easter.
<p>
   ``We'll make it a family event,'' says Dotty, adding the
obvious: ``The only traveling or vacation we get is hockey.''

 &UR; ALLEGRA LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR FOR SEPRACOR &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Sepracor Inc. stockholders are breathing easy these days.
<p>
   Shares of the Marlborough, Mass. drug company are up 34 percent
in a little over a week and reached an all-time high of 22 3/4
Tuesday. They have been soaring since federal regulators made news
with a rare decision to push the long-established antihistamine
Seldane used by allergy sufferers and others off the market.
<p>
   The U.S. Food and Drug administration decision Jan. 14
effectively turned that shelf space over to Sepracor's Allegra, a
near-twin drug unincumbered by Seldane's rare but potentially
lethal side effects. Challenges to the decision are likely to only
delay Seldane's departure.
<p>
   It is unclear whether Sepracor will actually make more money
from its drug thanks to the FDA decision, and no financial benefit
at all will fall to its bottom line before 1999. But regulators
have given another important boost to Sepracor's core strategy that
will likely benefit the company's crowded pipeline of other drugs.
<p>
   Sepracor is heading into the home stretch in the development of
an improved version of Albuterol, a drug commonly used to treat
asthma patients, who spend $1.4 billion on the medication each
year. And another antihistamine that would replace a near-twin
hampered with serious side effects is on the way and could be much
more lucrative for Sepracor. In all, 14 drugs that improve on
existing products are in the works.
<p>
   ``Most people develop drugs based on a new chemical entity,''
said Sepracor president Timothy Barberich. ``Our approach is to
view the existing portfolio of approved products as Sepracor's
pipeline.''
<p>
   Advances in chemistry and manufacturing technology are pushing
many drugs, new and old, toward a higher level of safety and
effectiveness. Sepracor has spent most of the 1990s developing
better versions of existing drugs and has lost more than $135
million along the way. The company is still three years away from
any profit by most accounts, but earnings could quickly jump to
more than $4 per share on a fully taxed basis by 2001, according to
Barbara Dau Hoffman of Vector Securities and other analysts.
<p>
   ``My feeling is that this is the way the world is going and
they're out front,'' said mutual fund manager Warren Isabelle of
Pioneer Group, the company's second-largest stockholder with about
1.2 million shares. ``The fact that you've seen the FDA take this
action sets a precedent.''
<p>
   Sepracor has typically targeted popular drugs whose 17-year
patent protections were nearing expiration. The original
manufacturer was thought to be a willing partner for marketing the
improved drug, which would start the patent clock anew and diminish
impending competition from inexpensive generics.
<p>
   ``In addition to this (Sepracor drug line) becoming a good
defensive strategy, it may become a regulatory necessity'' as a
result of the FDA's removal of Seldane, said Hoffman.
<p>
   This is not the first time the market has taken a shine to
Sepracor. Its shares soared from 4 to nearly 22 in about nine
months in 1995 thanks to the same kind of promise. But a decline in
biotech stock prices, a secondary stock offering and a round of
debt financing, plus a six-month delay in an important clinical
trial, knocked the stock's peak price in half by last summer.
<p>
   Now, analysts note, Sepracor has one product on the market,
another months away from a new drug application and a third close
behind. Just as important, the FDA seems to have gone out of its
way to give Sepracor a boost. But they warn the stock is still
subject to the market's prevailing opinion of developing companies
and could get hammered if the investment mood changes.
<p>
   This is the guts of Sepracor's chemistry: most man-made
compounds consists of two mirror-image molecules, often referred to
the right- and left-hand molecules. Sometimes, the benefits of a
compound are contained in one ``hand,'' and side effects are in the
other. Only within the last few years, chemists have been able to
split the compound and produce the desired half in industrial
quantities.
<p>
   Sepracor is not alone in its ability to do the chemistry, but it
has a huge lead and key patents on over 40 drugs. Many of the
improved drugs are believed to reduce or eliminate side effects.
Some just improve the effectiveness of the existing drug. Others
create new uses, like Sepracor's split version of the well-known
anti-depressant Prozac that is being developed for its apparent
benefit in warding off migraine headaches.
<p>
   Though Allegra is Sepracor's first drug to market, the company's
other antihistamine could become the superior cash cow.
<p>
   Sepracor, then in need of funding, negotiated away a good chunk
of its potential Allegra royalties years ago to manufacturer
Hoechst Marion Russell, which also owns the to-be-shelved Seldane.
Those royalties, at best 8 percent, will probably not generate more
than $40 million annually for Sepracor in years ahead.
<p>
   A near-twin for the antihistamine Hismanal, another drug with
potentially dire side effects, is under development by Separacor
and possibly is within three years of reaching the market. The
improved version of Hisminal could prove superior to its
competitors and provide Sepracor a much bigger slice of the sales
pie.
<p>
   Improved Albuterol, the drug for asthma patients, is in the
midst of final Phase III clinical trials, and Sepracor is expected
to apply for FDA approval later this year.
<p>
   The side effects of existing Albuterol products are not nearly
as clear cut as the antihistamines targeted by Sepracor. Key to its
strategy is a hoped-for indication from the FDA that Sepracor's
asthma drug is a preferred treatment for children, an advantage
none of its competitors would enjoy.
<p>
   Revenues from the sale of improved Albuterol are forecast by
analysts to start trickling in by 1998 and ramp up to nearly $150
million within two years. Sales of the Hismanal antihistamine
alternative are targeted to start in the year 2000.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Sepracor is still burning through $45 million a year
in development expenses. Barberich insists that is no problem,
pointing to Sepracor's $100 million in cash and another $100
million in securities.
<p>
   Investors who remember Sepracor's slump last year don't want to
see another stock offering to raise cash and dilute the value of
their stock. ``We would not be terribly thrilled,'' said Pioneer's
Isabelle. ``There really is no compelling reason to go to the well
right now.''

<p>
   Minneapolis, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Northern States Power Co.
said fourth-quarter profit rose 35 percent because of lower costs,
higher earnings from its non-regulated businesses and
colder-than-usual weather.
<p>
   Net income at the Minneapolis-based utility increased to $79.7
million, or $1.11 a share, from $59 million, or 82 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Per-share amounts reflect the payment of
preferred stock dividends.
<p>
   Revenue increased 8.7 percent to $710 million from $652.8
million, said Northern States, which provides natural gas and
electricity to customers in Minnesota, North and South Dakota,
Wisconsin and Michigan.
<p>
   While per-share results beat the 98-cent average estimate of six
analysts surveyed by IBES International, Northern States shares
fell 1/2 to 47 1/4 in early afternoon trading. Dain Bosworth
analyst David Thickens said the decline could be due to yesterday's
decision by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to delay a vote
on the merger of Northern States and Wisconsin Energy Corp.
<p>
   The company said it reduced costs from the 1995 quarter, when it
converted two plants from intermediate to peak-load operation. It
also didn't have any major power plant outages due to maintenance
during the most-recent quarter.
<p>
   Higher usage by customers because of cold weather added 8 cents
a share to its fourth-quarter earnings, compared with 4 cents in
the year-earlier period, the company said.
<p>
   As a result, earnings at its regulated utility business
accounted for $1.01 of its per-share earnings, up from 81 cents a
year ago.
<p>
   Northern States Power said its non-regulated businesses, which
had start-up costs in the year-earlier period, improved. Such units
accounted for 10 cents of per-share earnings, up from 1 cent.
<p>
   The non-regulated businesses include the Schkopau power plant in
Germany, several power plants in Latin America and NRG Generating
(U.S.) Inc., the former O'Brien Environmental Energy Inc. which
Northern States helped bring out of bankruptcy reorganization.
<p>
   For the year, Northern States said net income rose 5.1 percent
to $274.5 million, or $3.82 a share, from year-earlier profit from
operations of $261.1 million, or $3.69.
<p>
   After a non-recurring gain of $14.7 million, or 22 cents, from
buying out a purchased power contract, 1995 net income was $275.8
million, or $3.91 a share.
<p>
   Revenue rose 3.3 percent to $2.65 billion from $2.57 billion.
<p>
   Northern States Power said weather-related usage added 16 cents
a share to 1996 earnings, down from 20 cents the previous year.

<p>
   Food and New Orleans are a twin set. No matter why one is
traveling to the Crescent City, restaurant dining has to be part of
the quest.
<p>
   And what restaurants! New Orleans is one of the biggest tourist
and convention cities in the country, so the Super Bowl influx is
just another blip on the calendar. While January and February may
be the doldrums for restaurants in the rest of the country, New
Orleans will slide from the Sugar Bowl crowds to the Super Bowl
right into Madri Gras with several big conventions thrown in for
good measure. (itals)Laissez les bons temps rouler!(unitals)
<p>
   Emeril Lagasse, who owns Emeril's and NOLA, two of the most
popular restaurants in the city, is a native of Fall River, Mass.,
so this Super Bowl is something special. ``I'm so excited,''
Lagasse says. ``And my dad, who came down here to live a couple of
years ago and works with me in the restaurant, is ecstatic. He's
been a Patriots fan since forever.''
<p>
   Emeril's is ``going to do a first-time-ever Sunday brunch, a
four-course prix fixe menu.''
<p>
   Lagasse, a season ticket-holder for the Saints, didn't get
tickets in the team's lottery but says he's trying to buy a few.
``The owner of the Patriots is coming in next week,'' he says.
<p>
   New Orleans is the best place in the country for a Super Bowl,
Lagasse says. Everything  &MD;  great restaurants, hotels, the French
Quarter shops  &MD;  is within walking distance of the Superdome.
Besides, the city has a great ``party feeling.''
<p>
   Susan Spicer, chef-owner of Bayona in the French Quarter, says
the hoopla surrounding this Super Bowl is bigger than she remembers
from the last time New Orleans was host, in 1990.
<p>
   Bayona, another popular and highly acclaimed restaurant, is
already almost booked around Super Bowl time, but Spicer suggests
calling her restaurant or any of the other popular restaurants to
check. Since many business groups book reservations for the same
time in several places and travelers to the city sometimes find
that their plans change, no-shows are common. Often a table will
open up at the last minute, she says.
<p>
   The Gumbo Shop on St. Peter Street in the Quarter serves about
1,000 bowls of traditional gumbo a week, but Richard Taylor,
president of Roberts' Gumbo Shop Inc., figures the number will soar
beginning the Thursday before the game and continuing through Super
Bowl Sunday. The small restaurant, known for its beautiful
historical wall mural and its reasonable prices, serves seafood
gumbo, chicken and andouille sausage gumbo and smoked duck and
oyster gumbo as well as other soups and Creole and Cajun dishes.
The line to get in for lunch or dinner often stretches through the
courtyard.
<p>
    &UR; Emeril's  &LR; (800 Tchoupitoulas St., 504-528-9393),  &UR; NOLA  &LR; (534
St. Louis St., 504-522-6652) and  &UR; Bayona  &LR; (430 Dauphine St.,
504-525-4455) are in the vanguard, along with spots featuring the
new New Orleans cuisine, such as  &UR; Mike's on the Avenue  &LR; (628 St.
Charles Ave., 504-523-1709). But there's so much more to the fabric
of New Orleans food life. One heartening note is that the city is a
lively restaurant culture and the locals eat out a lot, not just at
the new places, but the classics like  &UR; Brennan's  &LR; and  &UR; Arnaud  &LR; in
the French Quarter.
<p>
   Here are a few suggestions from Lagasse, Spicer and others:
<p>
    &UR; Galatoire's &LR; , 209 Bourbon St., 504-525-2021. You don't need,
in fact you can't get, a reservation; just stand in line on Bourbon
Street. Once inside, though, you can easily imagine you've fallen
back into the last century as you taste the benchmark for such
classic Creole dishes as crabmeat etouffe.
<p>
    &UR; Camellia Grill &LR; , 626 S. Carrollton Ave., 504-866-9573.
Everyone eats breakfast at the counter  &MD;  that's all the seating
there is. Ceiling fans revolve slowly, throwing lazy shadows on
black-and-white tile floors as mountains of pecan waffles and huge
cheese omelets are created rapid-fire.
<p>
    &UR; Peristyle &LR; , 1041 Dumaine St., 504-593-9535. Recommended by both
Spicer and Lagasse, this French Quarter restaurant is known for new
twists on French and Louisiana dishes.
<p>
    &UR; Acme Oyster House &LR; , 724 Iberville St., 504-522-5973. There
are several oyster houses in the Quarter, but this one, plain and
reasonable, is the most atmospheric, many think.
<p>
    &UR; Brigtsen's &LR; , 723 Dante St., 504-861-7610. Another favorite of
many, this restaurant in the Carrollton section features Frank
Brigtsen's Cajun fantasies.
<p>
    &UR; Uglesich &LR; , 1238 Baronne St., 504-523-8571. Great oyster loaves,
soft-shell crabs and po-boys are strong draws to this modest lunch
spot.
<p>
    &UR; Taqueria Corona &LR; , 5932 Magazine St., 504-897-3974. This funky
Mexican cafe is a wonderful respite when Cajun and Creole start to
pale. As Spicer, in the middle of Super Bowl preparations, says,
``Boy, would I love a fish taco right now.''

<p>
   New Orleans, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Two players in the Super
Bowl know about life on the other side.
<p>
   Mike Bartrum and Jeff Dellenbach played for both the Green Bay
Packers and the New England Patriots this season, and will be on
opposite sidelines on Sunday.
<p>
   Bartrum, a tight end and long snapper, began the year with
Packers, and was traded to the Patriots after he tore ligaments in
his ankle during the preseason. Dellenbach started 1996 with the
Patriots, and was cut after he struggled with his short-snapping
duties in the first two games of the year.
<p>
   While both are happy for a chance to win the Super Bowl, neither
thought it would happen like this.
<p>
   ``It's very ironic,'' said Bartrum, who signed a two-year
contract with the Packers in March of last year after playing for
them in 1995. ``I thought there was a place for me in Green Bay.
<p>
   The Packers thought otherwise after Bartrum's injury, which
would have kept him out of action for at least three weeks. So on
Aug. 25 he was sent to New England, who because of Dellenbach's
struggles needed a snapper.
<p>
   ``All of a sudden I'm in New England,'' Bartrum said. ``Coach
Parcells gave me a chance.''
<p>
   At the time, the 6-foot-5, 245-pound Bartrum was leaving a
leading Super Bowl contender and joining a team that likely would
have been happy just to make the playoffs.
<p>
   ``It's going to be fun playing against Green Bay,'' said
Bartrum, who harbors no ill will towards the Packers. ``I know it's
a business, but I really want to prove to them they made a mistake
by trading me.''
<p>
   The same is true for Dellenbach, whose signing with the Packers
was a homecoming. A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, and a University
of Wisconsin product, the 6-foot-6, 300-pounder said he couldn't be
happier after spending 10 seasons with the Miami Dolphins.
<p>
   The odd scenario sets up a spy vs. spy situation, where each
player might provide his current team with information about the
opposition.
<p>
   While Bartrum said he would love to give the coaches an edge in
their preparation, he doesn't think he'd be much help. ``I don't
remember a lot,'' he said.

<p>
   If football fans were foodies, they'd throw the chips away, pull
that pot of chili right off the stove, put the hot dogs back in the
refrigerator. Everything that isn't regionally relevant to an
afternoon when the home team is in the Super Bowl would be
banished.
<p>
   This is a prideful moment here in New England Patriots country
and it calls for culinary patriotism. Of course, team
identification is thicker than geography, so even in the Pats'
heartland, there will be those cheering for the other side. Pick
your team and root with your fork.
<p>
   Barbara Haber of Lexington, Mass. stoutly declares her
loyalties: ``Packers  &MD;  and it goes way back.'' And according to the
Madison, Wis., native, football automatically means ``brats,''
short for bratwurst and pronounced with a Wisconsin ``a'' that's a
dead regional giveaway.
<p>
   ``Bratwurst with cold or warm potato salad,'' says Maison Robert
restaurateur Ann Robert, raised in Lafayette County in the
southwestern end of Wisconsin. ``And cheese. Everyone knows a
factory where the owner has put away a Cheddar for five years.''
<p>
   ``Bratwurst and beer,'' echoes Roger Bieri, who lives in
Swampscott, Mass. and works at the New England Life Insurance Co.
Bieri's father comes from the Door Peninsula, where Green Bay is
located. Cheese, says Bieri, is the universal food, and
Wisconsinites are proud to be called ``cheeseheads.''
<p>
   Sounds fairly straightforward. Sounds as if everyone from Lake
Superior to Milwaukee will be watching the Super Bowl and eating
cheese, bratwurst and potato salad, washed down with beer.
<p>
   Unless of course you happen to live near Racine and you've put
in an order at Danny's Meats and Catering, which is offering a
``Packer pig roast'' for 15 to 20 people. (This makes sense; the
name ``Packers'' comes from the meatpacking house in Green Bay that
originally sponsored the team.)
<p>
   We're not sure how much people eat in Racine, but we'd bet it's
quite a lot. Danny's Packer pig roast consists of a hindquarter of
smoked pig (about 18 pounds), 5 pounds of potato salad, 5 pounds of
pasta salad, 5 pounds of baked beans, rolls and sauces. Mike Doepke
of Danny's, reached by phone, was happy to explain the special,
which costs $80 and is offered every Sunday the Packers are
playing. He wanted to know why a reporter from The Boston Globe was
interested in Super Bowl Sunday.
<p>
   You can't expect those guys from Wisconsin, busy chowing down
hindquarters of pig, to keep track of details. Anyway, it's 12
degrees out there, and that doesn't count the wind chill factor.
They've got to eat brats and pig just to fortify themselves for
walking outside and starting the car.
<p>
   Where does that leave us? We can't look like culinary slouches.
We had hardy forebears. They managed to stick out that first rough
winter and pull enough fish from the sea to sustain themselves. We
should be doing what they did  &MD;  eating chowder. It was good enough
to feed them for a few centuries, it can certainly feed a few
hungry football fans.
<p>
   There's a third category of fans who'll be watching the Super
Bowl on Sunday  &MD;  the ones who made it down to New Orleans.
``They'll all gain about 10 pounds,'' says Anne Foley of Arlington,
raised in the Carrollton section of New Orleans and about to hop on
a plane and head back home with her husband, Michael. ``We love the
food,'' says Anne Foley. ``There's nothing like it anywhere else.''
<p>
   Foley's mother, Marie Clerc Higgins, was raised by a French
mother. Reached at her home in New Orleans, she was asked what
would be on her Super Bowl menu. She says that sometimes she makes
a ham and serves it with sweet potatoes. She likes jambalaya, too,
the rice and seafood dish. Gumbo, she says, ``is a nice warm soup
and it can be done ahead of time. I make okra and seafood gumbo. I
put sausage in with the seafood. After Christmas I make gumbo with
the turkey carcass.''
<p>
   Jambalaya is a typical home-style New Orleans dish, says John
Silberman, owner of Magnolias Southern Cuisine in Cambridge, Mass.,
the restaurant once known as the Cajun Yankee. Silberman, a New
Yorker, lived in New Orleans for seven years, and did several
restaurant stints, including one working for Paul Prudhomme at
K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen.
<p>
   Silberman's jambalaya contains andouille sausage, chicken and
shrimp. Because he makes it to order at the restaurant, he cooks
the rice separately and tosses it with the meat and seafood just
before it goes into the dining room. That method prevents serving
gluey rice  &MD;  especially if half time is later than you planned.
<p>
   Jambalaya, says Silberman, is one of those dishes that New
Orleanians insist define a cook's ability. Because it's so good at
home, he says, locals usually don't dine out on it. ``Everybody's
mother does it better,'' he says.
<p>
   So even if your mother never made fish chowder, it's your
patriotic duty to fashion a pot for the family this weekend. For
those who can't bear to leave the chips behind, try sprinkling them
on top. After all, New Englanders are nothing if not innovative.
Remember the American Revolution? We started it.
<p>
NEW ENGLAND FISH CHOWDER &HT;    
<p>
   Adapted from ``Jasper White's Cooking from New England'' (Harper
&AMP; Row).
<p>
   3 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless fish
<p>
   1/4 pound meaty salt pork, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch dice
<p>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
<p>
   2 large onions, cut into 3/4-inch dice
<p>
   3 bay leaves
<p>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
<p>
   3 or 4 large Maine or other boiling potatoes, peeled and halved
lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch slices
<p>
   3 cups strong fish stock or 2 cups of bottled clam juice diluted
with 1 cup cold water
<p>
   2 cups heavy cream
<p>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
<p>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
<p>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh chervil (optional)
<p>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
<p>
   Leave the fish in as large pieces as possible, since it tends to
flake when the chowder is stirred.
<p>
   In a large flameproof casserole, render the salt pork until it
begins to turn crisp. Add the 4 tablespoons of butter with the
onions, bay leaves and thyme.
<p>
   Cook the mixture for 5 minutes or until the onions are soft but
not brown. Add potatoes and fish stock and bring the mixture to a
boil. Lower the heat and simmer the potatoes for 20 minutes or
until they are tender.
<p>
   Remove the bay leaves from the stock. Add the fish and heavy
cream. Bring the soup to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 8
to 10 minutes or until fish is cooked through and beginning to
flake. Add salt and pepper, stir in the parsley and chervil, if
using, and remove the soup from the heat.
<p>
   With a slotted spoon, transfer the chunks of fish, onions and
potatoes to soup plates. Ladle the piping broth into the bowls. Add
a dollop of butter to each soup plate and serve with crackers or
biscuits.
<p>
   Serves 8.

 &UR; LOVE GETS COMFY IN HOLLYWOOD; RODMAN CHANGES HIS GAME PLAN &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Anyone who watched the Golden Globes on Sunday couldn't miss the
countless camera pans of an ever-smiling new actress with a polite
blond hairdo and rubbery Hollywood lips. Her name is Courtney Love,
and, just in time to survive the media's Death of Grunge
pronouncements, she is riding a massive career makeover, suddenly a
distant cousin to the reckless bigmouth known for her blood-red
lipstick and sloppy kinder-whore stylings. She's become Blanche to
her former Baby Jane.
<p>
   Is Love's transformation from addict-widow to movie star the
decade's greatest story of triumph? Or is her Hollywood conversion
a sellout of major proportions? The answer may depend on whether
you view the star of ``The People Vs. Larry Flynt'' from a rock
perspective, which would require Love always to have pock-marked
skin and at least one temper tantrum per interview, or a Hollywood
perspective, which would prefer the actress to be well-behaved and
recovered, or at least pretending to be. The cover story in
February's  &UR; Premiere &LR;  is a good snapshot of Love at the crossroads,
smitten with her newfound acceptance and yet very self-conscious
about it. ``I know a lot of it's fake,'' she says. ``But I don't
care! The welcome that I get from the grown-ups in the film
industry is so nice. ... I'm used to going to a mall and having a
kid with black lipstick scream at me, `I love you! I didn't kill
myself because of you!' Or `You suck!' But a grown-up in his 50s,
in a suit, being nice? I melt.''
<p>
   Love seems to take particular pleasure in hanging out with Young
Hollywood folks like Christian Slater and Winona Ryder and playing
that Young Hollywood game, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. ``I really
felt like a Brat Packer for about five seconds,'' she says. Mind
you, she still has some rock 'n' roll conscience, which guided her
choice of BMW: ``To get a new one would have been really un-punk
rock. I couldn't live with myself.''
<p>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Rolling Stone  &LR; for Feb. 6 has a good piece on the
drug struggles of Scott Weiland, the Stone Temple Pilot who has
been in and out of rehab 13 times in three years, and their effect
on his fellow band members. Most of the interviewing was done
before Weiland's most recent relapse, in December, after six months
of court-ordered inpatient treatment. ``It got to the point,''
Weiland told writer David Fricke, ``where I didn't feel like I got
a good enough rush unless I had one hand on the needle and one hand
dialing 911.'' Maybe Courtney Love can introduce him to her movie
agent.
<p>

<p>
 &UR; ufdots &LR; 
<p>
   February's  &UR; GQ &LR;  has a Dennis Rodman article that doesn't turn
the self-promoting basketball player into a cute, true-colors icon
of individuality. At a Taco Bell at a mall food court, not
surprisingly, Rodman is hounded by a fan. ``You can't go
anywhere,'' he complains. ``You're trying to do normal things  &MD;  sit
in this (expletive) mall without (expletive) people coming up who
want your (expletive) autograph.'' Anyway, Rodman has a plan. ``I
know people are getting sick and tired of Dennis Rodman. You have
yor time, and then you move on. I want people to look at me not
just as an athelete; I want them to think of me as a universal
person. ... I think my next forte will be doing movies.''
<p>
   February's  &UR; Esquire &LR;  has a fascinating piece about the writer
Jesse Hill Ford, who killed himself last June. In 1965, Ford
published ``The Liberation of Lord Byron Jones,'' a novel
condemning racial injustice that was celebrated by the critics. In
1970, shortly after the movie version was released, a paranoid Ford
fired his gun at a strange car that had entered his rural Tennessee
driveway, killing a 21-year-old black man named George Doaks Jr. He
was acquitted, but spent the rest of his life dealing with
hostility and accusations of racism, and he never bounced back,
both as a writer and as a man. The story, filled with irony and
tragedy, reads like an elaborate movie treatment. Someone should
write a screenplay.

<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS  &MD;  Fifty-five years ago this month, high-ranking Nazi
officials met in the leafy Berlin suburb of Wannsee to plan the
mass murder of six million European Jews.
<p>
   The so-called Wannsee conference, convened Jan. 20, 1942, on
Adolf Hitler's orders, was conducted in secret and only the
scantiest records have survived.
<p>
   More than a half-century later, the circumstances surrounding
the decision to launch the systematic extermination of European
Jewry in German death camps remain a subject of heated controversy.
<p>
   At the heart of the dispute is whether such a mind-boggling
crime could have been carried out even by Hitler and his fanatical
lieutenants without at least the tacit support and knowledge of
ordinary Germans.
<p>
   Fresh fuel was recently added to the debate by Harvard historian
Daniel Goldhagen who in his best-seller, ``Hitler's Willing
Executioners'' accused the whole German nation of readily
collaborating in genocide.
<p>
   The Germans, according to Goldhagen, suffered few qualms because
they had been indoctrinated by more than a century of vicious
anti-Jewish propaganda which had turned them into the most
anti-semitic society in Europe.
<p>
   The American historian, whose own father was a refugee from
Nazism, has sparked a fierce polemic on both sides of the Atlantic,
although some experts have pointed out his thesis is hardly new.
<p>
   Not surprisingly, Goldhagen has raised hackles among modern-day
Germans, many of whom have attacked his book as an unfair attempt
to pin perpetual guilt on them and their descendants.
<p>
   Critics don't contest the central theme of his book: that
special police battalions which hunted down and slaughtered Jews
throughout Nazi-occupied Europe were recruited among non-Nazis and
were not compelled to perform their murderous task. Nor would they
have been punished if they had refused, as official documents of
the time make clear.
<p>
   The units, numbering more than 100,000, were made up of
volunteers and, as contemporary records show, were a cross-section
of the German population. Goldhagen contends that this demonstrates
it wasn't only the Nazis who favored exterminating the Jews.
<p>
   But several historians argue that he has over-stated his case.
<p>
   In particular, the critics insist he is on shaky ground in
claiming that pre-Hitlerite Germany was the most anti-semitic
country in Europe, preparing the way for what was to come.
<p>
   ``No one in the year 1900 or even in 1930 would have named
Germany as the country where Jews had the worst of it  &MD;  far from
it,'' said French historian Alain Sinsheimer.
<p>
   While Germany had its share of outspoken anti-semites such as
composer Richard Wagner and the English-born ``philosopher,''
Houston Stewart Chamberlain, he noted that the German Jews in the
19th and early 20th centuries enjoyed greater freedom and
prosperity than their co-religionists in most other societies.
<p>
   ``Hatred of the Jews was far more pronounced in Czarist Russia
and in France  &MD;  remember the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus  &MD;  than
in Germany,'' Sinsheimer explained. ``At the turn-of-the-century
and even later, few observers would have rated the Germans as
notably anti-semitic.''
<p>
   That is why Goldhagen's claim that Hitler's ``final solution''  &MD; 
the decision taken at Wannsee to wipe out the Jewish people  &MD;  was a
product of the Germans' uniquely violent and bloodthirsty
anti-semitism is dubious, he said.
<p>
   Mass-killing techniques and extermination camps existed before
the Wannsee meeting. But it was there that the sinister SS chief,
Reinhard Heydrich, presented for the first time a detailed plan for
the Jews' destruction.
<p>
   At Wannsee, it was decided to use the deadly nerve gas Zyklon B
 &MD;  previously experimented with  &MD;  as the quickest way to kill the
intended victims.
<p>
   Some historians argue that the intense secrecy surrounding the
grisly three-day conference reflected Hitler's deep doubts over how
the German population would react. Allied investigators learned of
the conference when they debriefed Nazi officials right after the
war.
<p>
   No document linking Hitler personally to what transpired there
has ever come to light.
<p>
   In his recent book on the German resistance to the Nazis,
``Plotting to Kill Hitler,'' German historian Joachim Fest argues
that strong disapproval of the Nazis's treatment of the Jews was
widespread among the professional army officers, aristocrats and
officials who formed the core of the opposition movement.
<p>
   Fest observes that at the show trials of those linked to the
conspiracy to assassinate Hitler in July 1944, nearly
three-quarters of the defendants denounced anti-semitism, although
this only assured them a death sentence.
<p>
   ``Hitler almost certainly summoned the Wannsee conference
because he recognized time had begun to run out for him  &MD;  it was
just after the United States had entered the war and things had
started going badly for the Germans on the Russian front,'' British
historian Bernard Langton noted.
<p>
   In Langton's view, Hitler's obsessed anti-semitism had grown to
the point where he regarded extermination of the Jews as the single
all-consuming ideological object of his life and his paramount war
aim.
<p>
   ``Wannsee was where the Nazi high command organized their
killing machine on a continental scale and to be as efficient as
possible,'' he said. ``The objective was to make sure the maximum
number of Jews would die in whatever length of time the Nazi regime
had left. In this, Hitler was only too successful.''

<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  It all began when I bought 300 cotton puffs for
79 cents at Woolworth's. Little did I know it would end with my
life passing before my very eyes. And nose.
<p>
   Three hundred cotton puffs for six bits is such a good bargain,
it mattered not that I might still have some old puffs stashed
under my bathroom sink. I figured it was probably time I got into
the small cabinet anyway and took inventory. Toss a few things out.
Tidy up.
<p>
   Ha. Three hours and two full wastebaskets after I went in, I
emerged exhausted, embarrassed, bewildered and feeling very old.
<p>
   You pick up a scrapbook, an old photo album or a packet of
dusty, yellowing letters, and you expect to time-travel through
your past and maybe through a few social eras. You don't expect it
when you go under your bathroom sink to put away cotton puffs.
<p>
   The dozens of empty prescription drug vials alone were
mind-bending. The oldest: a silver tube of ointment, prescribed in
1973 when I was living in New York. The doctor and the pharmacy
have been dead for at least a decade.
<p>
   The partially used physicians' samples were the most perplexing.
When did I need the tiny orange anti-itch/anti-anxiety pills? What
doctor gave them to me? Why did I take only one? (Did I take it or
give it to somebody else as you should never do with prescription
drugs?)
<p>
   Ah, the Vicodin from '89 when I got mugged and knifed on the
street, had surgery and was in a cast for a month.
<p>
   The Vicodin from two years ago when I tore my anterior cruciate
ligament, had surgery and was on a cane for two months.
<p>
   The Percocet from when the Vicodin stopped working.
<p>
   The antibiotics  &MD;  ``Take all of these pills even if you begin to
feel better''  &MD;  for a host of bugs caught over the past 15 years.
Unused Bonine for a killer boat ride out to the Farallones in '88.
Packets of weird, fizzy decongestant prescribed by a doctor I
fairly crawled to in Paris in '92.
<p>
   Then there was the, uh, birth control. I'll skip the details,
but suffice to say, I found some museum pieces. What variety. What
a stockpile. Obviously, I once took the Boy Scout motto very much
to heart.
<p>
   Equally copious  &MD;  and dated  &MD;  was the makeup. Although I rarely
wear it, I seem never to have thrown out a tube, bottle, pencil or
compact of cosmetic paint that I acquired. Lipstick the color of
dried blood (or maybe refritos). Nail polish the color of Bazooka
bubble gum. Slime green eye shadow. Electric blue liner. Fake
suntan. Foundation for a street mime.
<p>
   The trip through perfume land, however, was sweet, full of the
kind of immediate recall that only the olfactory senses can
deliver. Love's Musky Jasmine from the early '70s; Figi from the
late. My '80s Halston phase. The Chloe that a former beau tried to
foist upon me during my Halston phase. The super-expensive
Valentino I bought 10 years ago and use for only the most special
evenings.
<p>
   (It's a quarter-of-an ounce bottle, still two-thirds full; a
testament to my glamorous social life.)
<p>
   Millions of hair pins and bobby pins. Stray barrettes and
ponytail holders. Two of those expandable, pointy headbands that I
keep hoping will work in my hair but won't. Straight pins, safety
pins, needles. Pocket sewing kits with only pink thread left. Jars
of cheap moisturizers  &MD;  what was I thinking?  &MD;  nearly empty bottles
of sun block and mosquito repellent.
<p>
   And one door key. A big, heavy, brass hotel job. Room 827.
Where? When? Did I have a good time?
<p>
   Oh, yes, there were cotton puffs. Maybe 100. But they were
ruined from some long-ago (I hope) leak in the pipes, so I threw
them out with all the other sorry stuff. At the rate I seem to use
cotton puffs, 300 probably will last me until I am eligible for
Social Security.
<p>
   I should be just about ready then to go back under my bathroom
sink.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Last June, the drama dept., a new not-for-profit theater
company, astonished my colleagues by finding the life in one of
Tennessee Williams's more problematic failures, ``Kingdom of
Earth.''
<p>
   The play had flopped on Broadway as ``The Seven Descents of
Myrtle'' in 1968, only to be made into a ghastly movie titled
``Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots'' in 1970. For those who saw
``Kingdom of Earth'' (which I didn't), the Drama Dept. promised to
be a bright new force on the New York theater scene.
<p>
   That promise is honored with its second production: an
impeccable revival of the seldom seen 1929 hit ``June Moon,'' the
bitterly funny Ring Lardner-George S. Kaufman sendup of Tin Pan
Alley.
<p>
   Though the limited run at the Ohio Theater in SoHo ends on
Saturday, the production must stand as one of the delicious
revelations of the current season. As directed by Mark Nelson and
performed by an ensemble of some of New York's most talented and
committed actors, this ``June Moon'' is a gin fizz with the kick of
raw Prohibition hooch.
<p>
   It reminds us of the theatrical wizardry and wit of Kaufman,
whose collaborations with Moss Hart, Edna Ferber, Morrie Ryskind
and Marc Connelly resulted in a remarkable number of classic
Broadway comedies from the 1920s into the 1940s. (A choice few:
``Merton of the Movies,'' ``The Royal Family'' and ``The Man Who
Came to Dinner.'') It also calls attention to the singular gifts of
Lardner, who died in 1933 at the age of 48.
<p>
   Lardner began as a sports reporter and columnist in Chicago and
New York, later evolving into a hugely popular writer of short
stories (``You Know Me, Al'') and novels (``The Big Town'').
<p>
   His subjects: baseball players, boxers, businessmen, barbers and
actresses, among others, all intensely dizzy people who haven't a
clue about the true nature of their sometimes bleak predicaments.
<p>
   In his first-person narratives, Lardner showed himself to be a
master of the American vernacular, a writer in the tradition of our
19th-century regional humorists. Yet it's not by chance that the
adjective most often used to describe his humor is ``sardonic,'' a
word derived, so it is said, from a Sardinian plant that when eaten
was supposed to induce convulsive laughter ending in death.
<p>
   ``June Moon,'' based on Lardner's story ``Some Like 'Em Cold,''
doesn't end in death, but there is a mean edge to it that is
uncharacteristic of Kaufman's work with his other collaborators. It
doesn't slash with the broad, ruthless, side-splitting strokes of
the great Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur farce, ``The Front
Page.''
<p>
   Rather, it has the structure of the kind of boy-girl romantic
comedies its title suggests, but there is one large difference:
virtually everybody in it is dangerously flawed, if not rotten to
the core.
<p>
   At the start of the play, Fred Stevens, its hero, who leaves
Schenectady to pursue a career as a lyricist in New York, appears
to be an innocent. By the end, when he has attained his idea of
fame, fortune and Ms. Right, he seems to be almost willfully
dim-witted, on his way to a marriage that, after the honeymoon,
will inevitably go sour.
<p>
   Why then is ``June Moon'' so funny? It's as sentimental as
cyanide; its skepticism is exhilarating. In addition, the
characters, in spite of their thick skins, small minds and all of
their furious double-dealing, remain naked and thus vulnerable from
beginning to end.
<p>
   There is also the language. New York, according to Fred, is a
place ``where they have the mecca for a man if you got the
songwriting gift.'' It's pure Lardner. Or, as Fred tells Edna, the
nice girl he picks up on the train to New York: ``I got no use for
a man who don't respect woman's hood.'' Or, when he's being most
sincere in his courtship: ``I don't believe God ever meant for a
woman to endure a life of druggery.''
<p>
   Fred's malapropisms are more than a humorist's exaggerations:
they approximate the earnest clumsiness of most thought. When you
read Lardner's dialogue or hear it on the stage, you might think he
had invented talk radio.
<p>
   Nelson is primarily an actor  &MD;  he was the memorably obsessed
Einstein in the New York production of Steve Martin's ``Picasso at
the Lapin Agile.'' It's now clear that he is also a director of
control, spirit and imagination. The Drama Dept. production never
stoops to its dated material or sidesteps it.
<p>
   This ``June Moon'' is played legitimately, without apologies, as
if it had been written yesterday. As Fred, Geoffrey Nauffts is all
politeness, misplaced confidence and daffy inspiration. In the
comparatively small part of Edna, Stacy Highsmith successfully
suggests the steel that helps to keep a slightly pushy upstate girl
pure in the big city.

<p>
   But then the entire cast is near-flawless, all of the actors
being firmly grounded in a shared comic style, something rarely
seen on our stages these days. Robert Joy, Becky Ann Baker and
Cynthia Nixon are very fine as, respectively, Fred's haggard
writing partner, Paul Sears, Paul's grimly wise-cracking wife,
Lucille, and Lucille's predatory blond sister, Eileen.
<p>
   Note also Albert Macklin as the partners' piano accompanist, who
may be the only decent character in the play, and Peter Jacobson as
the music company's composer of dreadful novelty tunes. When last
seen, he is trying to sell a number that starts: ``Should a
father's carnal sins/Blight the life of babykins?/Mister, won't you
give our child a name?/A last name.''
<p>
   Robert Lamont, who appears as the window cleaner at the music
company, is worth his own paragraph, if only because the character
is crucial to one of the funniest second-act curtain scenes ever
devised for a three-act play.
<p>
   Among the Drama Dept.'s other members: the actors Billy Crudup,
Hope Davis, Peter Frechette, K. Todd Freeman, Peter Gallagher,
Justin Kirk, John Cameron Mitchell, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mary Beth
Peil and J. Smith-Cameron; the directors Mark Brokaw, Lisa
Petersn, Randolph Curtis Rand and David Warren, and the writers
Douglas Carter Beane, Peter Hedges and Nicky Silver.
<p>
   Momentum is being gathered.

   It is not exactly news to report that Shakespeare wrote great
roles for great actors. But also for great dogs? That was among the
many pleasant surprises in the handsome, intelligent, consistently
blithe production of ``The Two Gentlemen of Verona'' that closed
last night at the Victory Theater. At the performance I caught,
even a little girl of possibly 10 or 11, who sat across the aisle
from me, seemed to be enchanted for most of the breezy three-hour
running time.
<p>
   The production, presented by the Theater for a New Audience in
association with the International Shakespeare Globe Center, was
the one seen in London last summer as part of the prologue season
in the semi-completed reconstruction of the Globe, which officially
opens in June. The staging was by Jack Shepherd, and Mark Rylance,
the new Globe's artistic director, was the effective star.
<p>
   He played Proteus, the Veronese gentleman who chucks his romance
with Julia (Stephanie Roth) and friendship with Valentine (Lennie
James) when he falls in love with Valentine's beloved Silvia
(Anastasia Hille), daughter of the Duke of Milan (Matthew
Scurfield).
<p>
   Proteus's self-justifying excuse: ``I to myself am dearer than a
friend.'' That is pretty much the narrative of this early work,
which, for all of its windy wordplay, is a charming entertainment.
It is also a test run for various plot devices (including women
disguised as men) that Shakespeare would exploit more richly in the
later romantic comedies.
<p>
   The production at the Victory recreated as much of the look of
an old Globe production as is possible in a modern proscenium
house. The lights stayed on in the auditorium throughout the
performance, some patrons were seated on the stage, props were kept
to a minimum, and the costuming was contemporary, as it would have
been at the Globe.
<p>
   With the services of a first-rate acting ensemble, the pace
seldom flagged. Most memorable were Rylance, Ms. Hille (last seen
here in the Cheek by Jowl production of ``The Duchess of Malfi''),
Ben Walden as Speed (Valentine's page) and Jim Bywater as Launce
(Proteus's page).
<p>
   It was Bywater who had to deal with Crab, Launce's scruffy,
self-possessed dog, played at the Victory by a casually groomed,
medium-sized black mutt that received no program credit. Whether or
not the dog is theatrically trained, I have no idea, and it made no
difference. Launce's speeches to and about the animal are so
craftily written that the text absorbed everything this Crab chose
to do, whether flopping onto the floor with back to audience,
barking in the middle of someone else's speeches or staring
vacantly out front, ostentatiously dreaming of home in Verona.
<p>
   This dog is a ham. Also hilarious.

   There are 12 people in the cast of ``Scapin,'' at the Laura Pels
Theater in the Criterion Center, but it functions almost as if it
were Bill Irwin's one-man show. In addition to playing the title
role, Irwin directed the Roundabout Theater Company comedy and,
with Mark O'Donnell, wrote this new English adaptation of the
Moliere classic ``Les Fourberies de Scapin,'' about literature's
premier rascally servant.
<p>
   Irwin is a phenomenally gifted mime, physical comedian and
sketch actor. He can dance, fold himself inside a carry-on flight
bag, appear to float and, possibly, play a soap bubble. Yet when
appearing in a comedy as comparatively formal as ``Scapin,'' he
might do well to seek the assistance of an outside director. He
needs someone to tell him when his carefully planned but supposedly
improvised, comic byplay begins to wear thin, that is, when it
becomes less than spontaneous fun, in fact, a drag.
<p>
   Though no one ever takes seriously Scapin's convoluted schemes
involving greedy masters, mistaken identities and mismatched
lovers, Irwin appears to think he has to let the audience know that
he knows that it's all nonsense. Thus he sends up the play's
mocking narrative by mocking it himself in asides to the audience,
with jokey signs that read ``Exposition'' or ``Unbelievable
Coincidence'' and, toward the end, by putting on contemporary drag
and entering the stage action via the audience. He tries too hard
to disassociate himself from the show he's in charge of.
<p>
   ``Scapin'' is best when it seems choreographed, rather than off
the cuff. Keystone Kop-like chases always work, as do Moliere's
outrageous plot turns, at least when they are treated straight and
not condescended to. You want to get into the spirit of the
performance, but the grin gets stuck, becomes stillborn. Too bad.
The cast is a good one and Douglas Stein's unit set, which looks
like a black-and-white woodcut, is exceptionally handsome.
<p>
    &UR; STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   Liza Minnelli is a performer of immense resources and game to
boot. But because of her figure and style, she is alarmingly
miscast in the title role of ``Victor/Victoria'' at the Marquis
Theater, where she is substituting for Julie Andrews through Feb.
2. Ms. Minnelli can sing in her own special catch-in-the-throat
way.
<p>
   She can dance. She also has her mother's manner of never seeming
to take herself too seriously. She can be an appealing as well as a
powerhouse music-hall personality.
<p>
   Little of this came through in the performance I saw, possibly
because there was not enough rehearsal time. She dominates neither
the show nor its only good number, ``Le Jazz Hot.'' Though she
sings a brief solo in it, she participates in ``Le Jazz Hot'' as
little more than a member of the chorus.
<p>
   There is a further problem, which is that her looks are slightly
androgynous to begin with. It is no big deal to see her playing a
woman playing a man playing a woman. The image is blurry anyway.
She is both gamine and gamin. When, in the finale, she comes out
wearing a formal black evening gown, it's a shock for the wrong
reason. In a formal evening gown, the tiny Ms. Minnelli looks like
a child playing dress-up.
<p>
   The show itself chugs along on automatic pilot. Tony Roberts,
Michael Nouri and Rachel York continue to perform with more energy
and conviction than the material honorably commands. Without Ms.
Andrews, ``Victor/Victoria'' is a joke without a punch line.
<p>
   One grace note: the French farce hotel scene in the second act
remains one of the funniest sequences that the writer-director
Blake Edwards ever devised. It seems even better than when the show
opened, but that could be because everything around it now is so
drab.

   The problem is, Chicago wants Dennis Rodman to be cuddly.
<p>
   Dennis Rodman ain't cuddly.
<p>
   He is not Tickle Me Dennis. He is tick...tick...ticking Dennis,
and he exploded once again last week.
<p>
   You know what happened. You've seen ``the kick'' a hundred times
on TV by now. You've heard that the NBA has suspended Rodman for at
least 11 games and ordered him to undergo counseling.
<p>
   Rodman's troubles don't end there. There may be criminal and
civil charges. There's also a rumor that his charge card at
Victoria's Secret may be revoked.
<p>
   This is the funniest part of the whole sad saga: According to
police who are following the letter of the law, Rodman at this
point is only a ``suspect'' in the ``alleged'' assault on that
cameraman last week in Minneapolis.
<p>
   Does that mean they're going to have to find a bunch of other
6-foot-8 guys with rainbow-colored hair, multiple tattoos and body
piercings to fill out a police lineup? Good luck.
<p>
   Too many kids want to believe Dennis is this neato video game
character. Heck, too many parents want to believe that. Not to
mention the guys who worship him as the great rebounding god and
the women who think of him as the ultimate anti-hero sex symbol.
<p>
   Other than the rebounding, it's all a crock.
<p>
   (And even as a basketball player, Rodman is overvalued. He's one
of the worst offensive players in the league, and too often he
sacrifices team defense in favor of padding his rebounding stats.
He's the Dave Kingman of basketball.)
<p>
   Dennis Rodman is not a misunderstood rebel, he's a manipulative,
money-hungry, one-man corporation trying to make as much money as
possible as quickly as possible. When Charles Barkley compared
Rodman to a prostitute, he was insulting prostitutes.
<p>
   For one thing, they have better makeup.
<p>
   For the last year and a half, Chicago has smothered Rodman with
love. When it comes to dealing with Dennis the Menace, the City of
the Big Shoulders has become the City of the Group Hug. We're like
the self-indulgent parents who think that everything the disturbed
child does is a healthy sign of expression.
<p>
   This is the first time ever that the cities of San Antonio and
Detroit can feel more sophisticated than Chicago. They've got to be
laughing at us for continuing to put up with this goofball who used
to blight their towns.
<p>
   Dennis Rodman is a jerk and a clown and a coward, and he's
getting paid more to wear Converse gym shoes than you'll make for
getting up every morning for the rest of your life and going to
work. Feel free to resent him, folks.
<p>
   You'd think people would be sick of Rodman's tired act by now -
the cross-dressing and the publicity stunts and the outbursts of
profanity and the lame show on MTV and the pay-per-gawk public
appearances. We got over our brief collective fascination with Boy
George and Anna Nicole Smith and Hulk Hogan, why can't we get past
this freakazoid?
<p>
   If you're a parent who thinks it's cute for your child to dress
up like Dennis or hold up signs in a sports arena pining for the
return of Rodman, you're stupid.
<p>
   If you're a hardcore Bulls fan who thinks Rodman is the victim
of persecution by the NBA, you're an idiot.
<p>
   If you greet Rodman's eventual return to the Bulls with a
standing ovation, you're a dupe.
<p>
   Michael Jordan is the greatest athlete in the history of team
sports and he is in the stretch run of his career, and Rodman is
soiling the memories. Jordan and Pippen sharing the court with
Rodman is tantamount to the three surviving Beatles reuniting but
having to share the stage with RuPaul.
<p>
   Rodman's greatest punishment isn't the suspension or the fine or
any of that. Five years from now, he'll be 40 and he'll be out of
the game, and no one will care about his antics, and Dennis Rodman
will have to live with himself.
<p>
   His greatest punishment is his future.

<p>
   The overnight transformation of George Stephanopoulos from
partisan pitchman to TV journalist highlights a disturbing
phenomenon: the progressive collapse of the walls that
traditionally separated news from propaganda.
<p>
   Self-respecting news organizations used to pride themselves on
the sturdy barriers they maintained to guard against all kinds of
partisan contamination.
<p>
   Inside the office, they built a high wall between those who
reported and analyzed events and those who offered opinions about
them  &MD;  between the newsroom and the editorial page. A second wall
separated both the news and editorial departments from the
commercial ambitions of the business office.
<p>
   And an especially thick wall was erected around the entire
enterprise to keep out the pollution generated by politicians and
advertisers.
<p>
   But now, particularly in television, America's primary source of
news, the walls are buckling. Stephanopoulos is hardly the first
politician to breach them.
<p>
   David Gergen changes identity faster than Clark Kent. Pete
Williams leapt from the Pentagon to NBC without stopping for lunch.
No one even bothers any longer to decontaminate a convert  &MD;  such
as, say, Bill Moyers  &MD;  by stretching out his passage from politics
to reporting over a cleansing period of time.
<p>
   Nor does anyone feel the need to put distance between an active
politician  &MD;  for instance, Pat Buchanan  &MD;  and the news team. On the
contrary, the commerce of television welcomes celebrity and
contentiousness.
<p>
   When ABC News first announced the hiring of Stephanopoulos, it
said he would be both a ``political analyst'' and a
``correspondent,'' with appearances on ``Good Morning America'' and
``This Week.''
<p>
   That gilding of an amateur must have caused a ripple of
resentment among reporters who take pride in the title
``correspondent.''
<p>
   So a second announcement quickly emphasized that the new recruit
would not be reporting news or questioning guests. And that, it was
said, would avoid any ``appearance of conflict.''
<p>
   Oh, sure.
<p>
   Who could possibly find conflict in an ``analysis'' of the
words, deeds and motives of Bill Clinton and his administration by
one of the architects of his presidency who just happens to owe his
celebrity and new job entirely to that president? How could anyone
discern even the appearance of a conflict between Stephanopoulos'
four-year career of media manipulation for the White House and
whatever he will now say or neglect to say as an ABC commentator?
<p>
   If our senses are so dulled to journalistic conflicts of
interest, it cannot be because of any redeeming features of the
Stephanopoulos appointment.
<p>
   It must be because news organizations, particularly TV-talk
shows, so routinely confuse dispassionate news analysis with the
expression of partisan opinion. At most, they compensate for one
prejudiced commentator by employing another, which further
conditions us to getting heat where there should be light.
<p>
   As ABC argued in self-justification, why should it not put
Stephanopoulos on a Sunday program that frequently features William
Kristol, a former aide to Vice President Dan Quayle?
<p>
   But then why be squeamish about Kristol and Stephanopoulos
questioning guests, like real reporters? A professional
opinion-monger such as George Will routinely does that on the same
program and thereby baits reporters, such as Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts, into expressing their contrary opinions.
<p>
   The trouble with news programs that lapse into bouts of opinion
is that the panelists end up scoring points instead of illuminating
events. The ultimate perversion occurs on ``The McLaughlin Group,''
whose members are encouraged to rudely shout out ill-argued
conclusions, often three or four at the same time.
<p>
   And some TV ``news'' shows abandon all pretense of
nonpartisanship by staging cockfights among unemployed politicians
 &MD;  pitting John Sununu against Geraldine Ferraro or Mary Matalin
against Dee Dee Myers.
<p>
   The paradox in all this is that the principal network anchors,
who used to be scorned for coloring the news with the curl of a lip
or the arch of an eyebrow, now stand out as the most impartial and
polite voices in TV news.
<p>
   Although the experiences and independence of Tom Brokaw, Peter
Jennings, Dan Rather and Ted Koppel would give their opinions a lot
more weight than those of any politician, they still observe the
disciplines of their craft. Their on-air analyses plumb the views
and prejudices of others without parading their own.
<p>
   To be sure, none of us in the news business are perfectly
disinterested. We are not entirely above commercial motive or
always successful in suppressing a personal view. And yes, The New
York Times once felt a need to balance the opinions on its op-Ed
page by hiring William Safire direct from President Nixon's staff
of speech writers.
<p>
   And so long as Nixon remained in the White House with Watergate
bursting all around, Safire showed himself understandably
conflicted in some of the columns he wrote. But they were plainly
carried as columns of opinion, strictly segregated from the news.
<p>
   In my experience, The Times was insufficiently fastidious only
once, two decades ago, when it hired Leslie Gelb, an arms-control
expert, to write knowingly about diplomacy soon after he had
practiced it inside the State Department. It even let him shuttle
to and from government, making an exception that reinforced our
rule against such slackness.
<p>
   Why is television increasingly lax about the old standards?
<p>
   Obviously, a Stephanopoulos has star qualities. He comes as a
ready-made celebrity expert, telegenic, charming, articulate. He
brings promise of an immediate lift in the ratings and in profits.
The same qualities and promise must explain why, contrary to
custom, the highest officials of Columbia University escorted him
before the cameras to announce Stephanopoulos' other new job  &MD;  as
teacher and scholar.
<p>
   If he is serious about academia and journalism, Stephanopoulos
will in time outgrow his youthful ardors and escapades, recover his
chastity and qualify as a professional student and observer of
public affairs.
<p>
   But if TV news is serious about its reputation for disinterested
analysis, it had better cement those walls.

<p>
   The overnight transformation of George Stephanopoulos from
partisan pitchman to TV journalist highlights a disturbing
phenomenon: the progressive collapse of the walls that
traditionally separated news from propaganda.
<p>
   Self-respecting news organizations used to pride themselves on
the sturdy barriers they maintained to guard against all kinds of
partisan contamination.
<p>
   Inside the office, they built a high wall between those who
reported and analyzed events and those who offered opinions about
them  &MD;  between the newsroom and the editorial page. A second wall
separated both the news and editorial departments from the
commercial ambitions of the business office.
<p>
   And an especially thick wall was erected around the entire
enterprise to keep out the pollution generated by politicians and
advertisers.
<p>
   But now, particularly in television, America's primary source of
news, the walls are buckling. Stephanopoulos is hardly the first
politician to breach them.
<p>
   David Gergen changes identity faster than Clark Kent. Pete
Williams leapt from the Pentagon to NBC without stopping for lunch.
No one even bothers any longer to decontaminate a convert  &MD;  such
as, say, Bill Moyers  &MD;  by stretching out his passage from politics
to reporting over a cleansing period of time.
<p>
   Nor does anyone feel the need to put distance between an active
politician  &MD;  for instance, Pat Buchanan  &MD;  and the news team. On the
contrary, the commerce of television welcomes celebrity and
contentiousness.
<p>
   When ABC News first announced the hiring of Stephanopoulos, it
said he would be both a ``political analyst'' and a
``correspondent,'' with appearances on ``Good Morning America'' and
``This Week.''
<p>
   That gilding of an amateur must have caused a ripple of
resentment among reporters who take pride in the title
``correspondent.''
<p>
   So a second announcement quickly emphasized that the new recruit
would not be reporting news or questioning guests. And that, it was
said, would avoid any ``appearance of conflict.''
<p>
   Oh, sure.
<p>
   Who could possibly find conflict in an ``analysis'' of the
words, deeds and motives of Bill Clinton and his administration by
one of the architects of his presidency who just happens to owe his
celebrity and new job entirely to that president? How could anyone
discern even the appearance of a conflict between Stephanopoulos'
four-year career of media manipulation for the White House and
whatever he will now say or neglect to say as an ABC commentator?
<p>
   If our senses are so dulled to journalistic conflicts of

<p>
   It must be because news organizations, particularly TV-talk
shows, so routinely confuse dispassionate news analysis with the

   Two years ago, while Rwanda's Hutu militias were murdering half
a million Tutsis, most of them men, Hutu soldiers and civilians
also raped more than 250,000 women.
<p>
   Never having enjoyed a particularly high status even in the best
of times, these women soon found themselves in the most dire
straits.
<p>
   Widowed by the genocide and stigmatized by rape, they were often
cast out of their hometowns. Without husbands to protect them, they
lost their connection to community, which forms the bedrock of
Rwandan village life.
<p>
   What little attention the world paid to the genocide focused on
its carnage and, later, its 1.2 million refugees. The women who
stayed in Rwanda, many of whom were sexually mutilated and tortured
in addition to raped, were largely invisible to the outside world.
<p>
   This is especially noteworthy since the country had become 70
percent female, 60 percent of whom were widows. Today, with a
million refugees having recently streamed home from camps in Zaire,
the women who survived in Rwanda are once again slipping beneath
the radar of international, and national, interest.

<p>
   On the outskirts of Kigali, a 30-year-old widow, Jacqueline
Nyirakamana, stands apart from the bustle of her small village and
holds her baby daughter Diane, on her hip. A young boy playfully
chases two girls around the dirt compound; adult men are
conspicuously absent. The girls hide behind the skirts of one
woman, then another, but never behind Nyirakamana. In fact, they
avoid her.
<p>
   Nyirakamana has taken up residence, uninvited, in a
cement-walled house appointed with a couch and a few comfortable
chairs. Her own house, in the city of Butare, was destroyed by the
``interhamwe,'' the extremist Hutu militia.
<p>
   Nyirakamana can't go home. Everyone she knows in her commune has
either been killed or turned out to be a killer. This house was
abandoned by a Hutu soldier hiding in Zaire. Although it is quite
large, Nyirakamana lives here alone with her baby.
<p>
   ``I have little in common with the other women here,'' she says,
leading me inside.
<p>
   The reason for her isolation, she explains, is her child,
fathered by one of the many Hutu soldiers who raped her,
repeatedly, for an entire month.
<p>
   Rwanda now has between 2,000 and 5,000 children born of rape.
Commonly considered Hutu despite their mothers' ethnicity  &MD;  and the
government's almost absurd insistence that ethnicity is now
irrelevant  &MD;  the babies are called ``little interhamwe'' or
``devil's children.''
<p>
   Before 1994, rape in Rwanda was uncommon. But during the
genocide, women became deliberate targets. For months before the
killing began, radio broadcasts and extremist magazines portrayed
Tutsi women as arrogant and superior. Cartoons depicted them
performing lewd acts.
<p>
   ``They're too tall,'' the newspapers said. ``Cut off their
legs.''
<p>
   Rape, then, was committed not as a personal act of violence but
as a political one, used to terrorize entire communities. For those
impregnated by their attackers, the destruction of personal and
community integrity was nearly complete.
<p>
   Nyirakamana realized she was pregnant after the Rwandan
Patriotic Front liberated Kigali, soon after she learned her
husband and two children were dead.
<p>
   ``I tried to abort the child but could find no one to do it,''
she says.
<p>
   Rwanda is largely Roman Catholic, and abortion is illegal. But
hundreds of raped women did get abortions, either from sympathetic
village healers or through a tacit agreement between the government
and the medical community to overlook the law in these extreme
cases.
<p>
   Other women gave birth to and simply abandoned their children.
Another alternative, rarely voiced, was infanticide.
<p>
   Nyirakamana eventually decided to keep her baby, though her very
existence suggests to some that Nyirakamana is a collaborator.
<p>
   ``My other children were gone,'' she says flatly, ``so I had to
accept this one.''
<p>
   No one came to visit her when Diane was born, a breach of
village decorum. ``The community isn't interested in me or her. I
am alone here, and I have nothing but a child from the men who
killed my family.''
<p>
   In Nyirakamana's new neighborhood, men don't talk to her, or to
any of the other widows, for fear they'll be accused of having a
romantic interest. For widows, new husbands would be nice, but
likely candidates  &MD;  especially those who would accept a widow who
has been raped  &MD;  are scarce. Women with babies of rape have even
less hope.
<p>
   Rwandan society is fairly closed, and women don't easily express
their trauma. Rape victims especially speak in measured sentences
that betray little emotion. But health workers in Rwanda report
women racked by nightmares, who have trouble sleeping and
concentrating, who present a litany of psychosomatic ills.
<p>
   ``With a return to normalcy, with the schools and markets open,
problems arise,'' says Esmee de Jong, a mental-health coordinator
with Doctors Without Borders. ``Many widows we see now are
withdrawing and dysfunctional, not capable of properly looking
after their children.'' Psychologists worry that trauma is becoming
entrenched.
<p>
   While the rape of more than a quarter of a million girls and
women astounds and horrifies Westerners, the women have more
immediate, material concerns. Many of them desperately need
housing, clean water, cropland and money for their children's
school fees. Indeed, the troubles of widows seem almost endless.
<p>
   In Rwanda a widow cannot inherit property, houses, cattle or
anything else that belonged to her husband. Without her husband's
permission, a woman cannot work at night, testify in court or get
credit from a bank.
<p>
   Facing a bleak future, the government of Rwanda is, for the
first time, forging a national policy for women, which may include
inheritance reforms.
<p>
   ``But women don't necessarily want to play a key role in their
future,'' says Aloyise Inyumba, the minister for family and women's
affairs.
<p>
   Many Rwandans, she says  &MD;  men and women alike  &MD;  consider the
proposed reforms too radical. Years ago, when the country
considered amending the dowry system, many women opposed the idea,
fearing that a fixed bride price of just one cow would reflect
poorly on their value. If the inheritance laws do change,
acceptance may be a long time coming.
<p>
   ``In a traditional society, claiming property will isolate
widows even more,'' de Jong says. ``And when other women see the
effect, they may stop pursuing their own rights.''
<p>
   Nyirakamana, like most women in Rwanda, has no idea what those
rights may be. She cannot read. Nor does she have any marketable
skills. Large extended families make up the fabric of Rwandan
villages, and widows who can call on their distant male relatives
do.
<p>
   But those such as Nyirakamana, who have lost their entire
families and rely for the most part on handouts, may soon discover
that the country's latest crisis has strained even the deep pockets
of international relief organizations.
 &UR; -0-
<p>
   The steeply terraced hills of Kibuye prefecture wrap around the
eastern shore of Lake Kivu, along Rwanda's border with Zaire. The
countryside here, like nearly every place outside Kigali, is
aggressively cultivated. Groves of plantain trees blanket the
uplands. Potato plants form a patchwork down below.
<p>
   Women in long skirts tend beans and tomatoes. Boys with closely
cropped hair poke sticks at cattle grazing along the red dirt
roads.
<p>
   Rich soil and plenty of rain make Rwanda almost frighteningly
fecund. Frangipani perfumes the air, and bougainvillea and lantana
interrupt a riot of green. Thanks in part to this pastoral
abundance, Rwanda, even after the genocide and before the recent
influx of refugees, was still one of the most densely populated
countries in Africa.
<p>
   While many Hutu women may find their husbands among the
returnees, Tutsi widows may feel more isolated than ever.
<p>
   Agnes Mukabacondo, whose husband was killed in the genocide, now
runs a group that owns restaurants and employs widows in Kibuye's
Gitesi commune.
<p>
   Describing life as a widow in Rwanda, she says: ``The change is
profound and difficult to bear. A husband takes care of everything
 &MD;  you just follow.''
<p>
   All across the country I saw women toiling in their homes and
fields. The men, it seemed, did nothing. In fact, Mukabacondo tells
me, men are constantly busy, protecting family interests by working
the subtle and complicated power dynamics of the community. In a
country jammed with subsistence farmers, holding onto property can
be a full-time job.
<p>
   ``The husband looks for friends for the family,'' she says. ``He
forges family links. If you help someone with a cow, he owes you.
But when your husband dies, you lose those connections. You try to
do it on your own, but it is imperfect.''
<p>
   Survivors in Kibuye, which saw the genocide's worst violence,
have legitimate fears that among those now returning to Rwanda are
perpetrators of the genocide.
<p>
   In the commune of Rwamatamu, in southern Kibuye, that fear is
palpable. Tutsis here have lived under siege for two years as Hutu
soldiers make raids from safe havens over the border. One of those
havens, called Idjwi Island, at the southern end of Lake Kivu, lies
just off the shores of Rwamatamu.
<p>
   At night, widows who live on the outskirts of town hear the
motors of the interhamwe's boats cut out as they near shore. In the
morning the women find notes on their doors: ``You're next'' and
``If we don't get 200,000 francs, you're dead.''
<p>
   The soldiers single out surviving Tutsis, in particular those
who may testify at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
whose first trial began in earnest the week of Jan. 13. A network
of informants around the commune makes the killers' work easier. In
1996, Hutu soldiers killed scores of potential witnesses.
<p>
   Alone with their children, women are afraid to sleep in their
own homes.
<p>
   ``We work our family's land in the daytime,'' says Elodia
Mukandekeli, 22, who looks after two orphaned nephews, ``but we
sleep in the bush at night, or we keep switching among houses
abandoned by Hutu.''
<p>
   According to de Jong, women such as Mukandekeli have long been
vulnerable.
<p>
   ``But now we see panic among them as the refugees return,'' she
says. ``They have no men to protect them. They can lose their land,
their houses. They may have to confront their attackers.''
<p>
   The vast majority of foreign aid sent to Rwanda in the past two
years, about $2.5 billion, has been spent on refugees, with little
money, or attention, going to survivors. That seems unlikely to
change.
<p>
   Nyirakamana, among many women, hopes to one day confront her
rapists and the men who murdered her family. But with the current
backlog in the courts  &MD;  about 80,000 people linger, untried, in
Rwandan prisons  &MD;  it's unlikely she'll see justice any time soon.
<p>
   Last year ``sexual torture'' was classified as a capital crime
under new genocide laws, but not a single person has been indicted
on that charge alone, and the Ministry of Justice has done nothing
to encourage potential witnesses or protect them from reprisal.
<p>
   Manpower and money are scarce as the country struggles to
rebuild its entire political, economic, social and administrative
systems.
<p>
   And so Nyirakamana waits  &MD;  for the owner of her house to return,
for the next aid program to roll out.
<p>
   She can't predict where she'll be in a year, or even a month  &MD; 
only that her daughter will one day ask who her father is, and how
did all this happen.

   Two years ago, while Rwanda's Hutu militias were murdering half
a million Tutsis, most of them men, Hutu soldiers and civilians
also raped more than 250,000 women.
<p>
   Never having enjoyed a particularly high status even in the best
of times, these women soon found themselves in the most dire
straits.
<p>
   Widowed by the genocide and stigmatized by rape, they were often
cast out of their hometowns. Without husbands to protect them, they
lost their connection to community, which forms the bedrock of
Rwandan village life.
<p>
   What little attention the world paid to the genocide focused on
its carnage and, later, its 1.2 million refugees. The women who
stayed in Rwanda, many of whom were sexually mutilated and tortured
in addition to raped, were largely invisible to the outside world.
<p>
   This is especially noteworthy since the country had become 70
percent female, 60 percent of whom were widows. Today, with a
million refugees having recently streamed home from camps in Zaire,
the women who survived in Rwanda are once again slipping beneath
the radar of international, and national, interest.

<p>
   On the outskirts of Kigali, a 30-year-old widow, Jacqueline
Nyirakamana, stands apart from the bustle of her small village and
holds her baby daughter Diane, on her hip. A young boy playfully
chases two girls around the dirt compound; adult men are
conspicuously absent. The girls hide behind the skirts of one
woman, then another, but never behind Nyirakamana. In fact, they
avoid her.
<p>
   Nyirakamana has taken up residence, uninvited, in a
cement-walled house appointed with a couch and a few comfortable
chairs. Her own house, in the city of Butare, was destroyed by the
``interhamwe,'' the extremist Hutu militia.
<p>
   Nyirakamana can't go home. Everyone she knows in her commune has
either been killed or turned out to be a killer. This house was
abandoned by a Hutu soldier hiding in Zaire. Although it is quite
large, Nyirakamana lives here alone with her baby.
<p>
   ``I have little in common with the other women here,'' she says,
leading me inside.
<p>
   The reason for her isolation, she explains, is her child,
fathered by one of the many Hutu soldiers who raped her,
repeatedly, for an entire month.
<p>
   Rwanda now has between 2,000 and 5,000 children born of rape.
Commonly considered Hutu despite their mothers' ethnicity  &MD;  and the
government's almost absurd insistence that ethnicity is now
irrelevant  &MD;  the babies are called ``little interhamwe'' or
``devil's children.''
<p>
   Before 1994, rape in Rwanda was uncommon. But during the
genocide, women became deliberate targets. For months before the
killing began, radio broadcasts and extremist magazines portrayed
Tutsi women as arrogant and superior. Cartoons depicted them
performing lewd acts.
<p>
   ``They're too tall,'' the newspapers said. ``Cut off their
legs.''
<p>
   Rape, then, was committed not as a personal act of violence but
as a political one, used to terrorize entire communities. For those
impregnated by their attackers, the destruction of personal and
community integrity was nearly complete.
<p>
   Nyirakamana realized she was pregnant after the Rwandan
Patriotic Front liberated Kigali, soon after she learned her
husband and two children were dead.
<p>
   ``I tried to abort the child but could find no one to do it,''
she says.
<p>
   Rwanda is largely Roman Catholic, and abortion is illegal. But
hundreds of raped women did get abortions, either from sympathetic
village healers or through a tacit agreement between the government
and the medical community to overlook the law in these extreme
cases.
<p>
   Other women gave birth to and simply abandoned their children.
Another alternative, rarely voiced, was infanticide.
<p>
   Nyirakamana eventually decided to keep her baby, though her very
existence suggests to some that Nyirakamana is a collaborator.
<p>
   ``My other children were gone,'' she says flatly, ``so I had to
accept this one.''
<p>
   No one came to visit her when Diane was born, a breach of
village decorum. ``The community isn't interested in me or her. I
am alone here, and I have nothing but a child from the men who
killed my family.''
<p>
   In Nyirakamana's new neighborhood, men don't talk to her, or to
any of the other widows, for fear they'll be accused of having a
romantic interest. For widows, new husbands would be nice, but
likely candidates  &MD;  especially those who would accept a widow who
has been raped  &MD;  are scarce. Women with babies of rape have even
less hope.
<p>
   Rwandan society is fairly closed, and women don't easily express
their trauma. Rape victims especially speak in measured sentences
that betray little emotion. But health workers in Rwanda report
women racked by nightmares, who have trouble sleeping and
concentrating, who present a litany of psychosomatic ills.
<p>
   ``With a return to normalcy, with the schools and markets open,
problems arise,'' says Esmee de Jong, a mental-health coordinator
with Doctors Without Borders. ``Many widows we see now are
withdrawing and dysfunctional, not capable of properly looking
after their children.'' Psychologists worry that trauma is becoming
entrenched.
<p>
   While the rape of more than a quarter of a million girls and
women astounds and horrifies Westerners, the women have more
immediate, material concerns. Many of them desperately need
housing, clean water, cropland and money for their children's
school fees. Indeed, the troubles of widows seem almost endless.
<p>
   In Rwanda a widow cannot inherit property, houses, cattle or
anything else that belonged to her husband. Without her husband's
permission, a woman cannot work at night, testify in court or get
credit from a bank.
<p>
   Facing a bleak future, the government of Rwanda is, for the
first time, forging a national policy for women, which may include
inheritance reforms.
<p>
   ``But women don't necessarily want to play a key role in their
future,'' says Aloyise Inyumba, the minister for family and women's
affairs.
<p>
   Many Rwandans, she says  &MD;  men and women alike  &MD;  consider the
proposed reforms too radical. Years ago, when the country
considered amending the dowry system, many women opposed the idea,
fearing that a fixed bride price of just one cow would reflect
poorly on their value. If the inheritance laws do change,
acceptance may be a long time coming.
<p>
   ``In a traditional society, claiming property will isolate
widows even more,'' de Jong says. ``And when other women see the
effect, they may stop pursuing their own rights.''
<p>
   Nyirakamana, like most women in Rwanda, has no idea what those
rights may be. She cannot read. Nor does she have any marketable
skills. Large extended families make up the fabric of Rwandan
villages, and widows who can call on their distant male relatives
do.
<p>
   But those such as Nyirakamana, who have lost their entire
families and rely for the most part on handouts, may soon discover
that the country's latest crisis has strained even the deep pockets
of international relief organizations.
 &UR; -0-
<p>
   The steeply terraced hills of Kibuye prefecture wrap around the
eastern shore of Lake Kivu, along Rwanda's border with Zaire. The
countryside here, like nearly every place outside Kigali, is
aggressively cultivated. Groves of plantain trees blanket the
uplands. Potato plants form a patchwork down below.
<p>
   Women in long skirts tend beans and tomatoes. Boys with closely
cropped hair poke sticks at cattle grazing along the red dirt
roads.
<p>
   Rich soil and plenty of rain make Rwanda almost frighteningly
fecund. Frangipani perfumes the air, and bougainvillea and lantana
interrupt a riot of green. Thanks in part to this pastoral
abundance, Rwanda, even after the genocide and before the recent
influx of refugees, was still one of the most densely populated
countries in Africa.
<p>
   While many Hutu women may find their husbands among the
returnees, Tutsi widows may feel more isolated than ever.
<p>
   Agnes Mukabacondo, whose husband was killed in the genocide, now
runs a group that owns restaurants and employs widows in Kibuye's
Gitesi commune.
<p>
   Describing life as a widow in Rwanda, she says: ``The change is
profound and difficult to bear. A husband takes care of everything
 &MD;  you just follow.''
<p>
   All across the country I saw women toiling in their homes and
fields. The men, it seemed, did nothing. In fact, Mukabacondo tells
me, men are constantly busy, protecting family interests by working
the subtle and complicated power dynamics of the community. In a
country jammed with subsistence farmers, holding onto property can
be a full-time job.
<p>
   ``The husband looks for friends for the family,'' she says. ``He
forges family links. If you help someone with a cow, he owes you.
But when your husband dies, you lose those connections. You try to
do it on your own, but it is imperfect.''
<p>
   Survivors in Kibuye, which saw the genocide's worst violence,
have legitimate fears that among those now returning to Rwanda are
perpetrators of the genocide.
<p>
   In the commune of Rwamatamu, in southern Kibuye, that fear is
palpable. Tutsis here have lived under siege for two years as Hutu
soldiers make raids from safe havens over the border. One of those
havens, called Idjwi Island, at the southern end of Lake Kivu, lies
just off the shores of Rwamatamu.
<p>
   At night, widows who live on the outskirts of town hear the
motors of the interhamwe's boats cut out as they near shore. In the
morning the women find notes on their doors: ``You're next'' and
``If we don't get 200,000 francs, you're dead.''
<p>
   The soldiers single out surviving Tutsis, in particular those
who may testify at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
whose first trial began in earnest the week of Jan. 13. A network
of informants around the commune makes the killers' work easier. In
1996, Hutu soldiers killed scores of potential witnesses.
<p>
   Alone with their children, women are afraid to sleep in their
own homes.
<p>
   ``We work our family's land in the daytime,'' says Elodia
Mukandekeli, 22, who looks after two orphaned nephews, ``but we
sleep in the bush at night, or we keep switching among houses
abandoned by Hutu.''
<p>
   According to de Jong, women such as Mukandekeli have long been
vulnerable.
<p>
   ``But now we see panic among them as the refugees return,'' she
says. ``They have no men to protect them. They can lose their land,
their houses. They may have to confront their attackers.''
<p>
   The vast majority of foreign aid sent to Rwanda in the past two
years, about $2.5 billion, has been spent on refugees, with little
money, or attention, going to survivors. That seems unlikely to
change.
<p>
   Nyirakamana, among many women, hopes to one day confront her
rapists and the men who murdered her family. But with the current
backlog in the courts  &MD;  about 80,000 people linger, untried, in
Rwandan prisons  &MD;  it's unlikely she'll see justice any time soon.
<p>
   Last year ``sexual torture'' was classified as a capital crime
under new genocide laws, but not a single person has been indicted
on that charge alone, and the Ministry of Justice has done nothing
to encourage potential witnesses or protect them from reprisal.
<p>
   Manpower and money are scarce as the country struggles to
rebuild its entire political, economic, social and administrative
systems.
<p>
   And so Nyirakamana waits  &MD;  for the owner of her house to return,
for the next aid program to roll out.
<p>
   She can't predict where she'll be in a year, or even a month  &MD; 
only that her daughter will one day ask who her father is, and how
did all this happen.

   This is the way the world ends.
<p>
   ``Mission briefing: Chinese hard-liners have staged a daring
raid on one of the world's last great untapped oil reserves,
setting the stage for a rejuvenated Communist dictatorship.
Representing the United States, you command an improved Los
Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine, the USS Cheyenne. Over 360

any naval fleet.''
<p>
   Novelist Tom Clancy's nuclear-tipped CD-ROM war game, ``SSN''  &MD; 
from which this call to arms is taken  &MD;  has fallen into the hands
of my 9-year-old son.
<p>
   As a consequence, the end of the world looms.
<p>
   The boy has always had an itchy trigger finger. Now he has the
means to employ it.
<p>
   In the last minutes left to us, it may be fitting to meditate on
how history could have come to this  &MD;  and fitting also to retrace
the steps that have led Clancy, arguably the most famous resident
of Maryland, to great wealth and astonishing popularity as a
novelist.
<p>
   According to Forbes magazine, Clancy made $15 million in 1995
and $16 million in 1996.
<p>
   A recent article in GQ by Peter Bart suggested that
super-popular writers such as Clancy and John Grisham have such
powerful brand names that ``no publisher can afford to pay them
what they demand. Hence, some publishing veterans believe the
authors will end up self-publishing and owning the copyrights.''
<p>
   Let's leave Grisham out of this and stick with Clancy. Why is he
so popular?
<p>
   From the beginning, Clancy has been in love with bells and
missiles, his plots brimming with state-of-the-art
electronic-warfare systems.
<p>
   His first novel launched the techno-thriller genre. This was
``The Hunt for Red October,'' published in 1984 to the applause of
the American public, which made his tale of submarine cat-and-mouse
games a remarkable best seller.
<p>
   Since then he has written more than a dozen other books, eight
of them novels about as popular as the first one.
<p>
   The eight are: ``Red Storm Rising'' (1986), ``Patriot Games''
(1987), ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' (1988), ``Clear and Present
Danger'' (1989), ``The Sum of All Fears'' (1991), ``Without
Remorse'' (1993), ``Debt of Honor'' (1994) and ``Executive Orders''
(1996).
<p>
   Clancy gives readers plenty of pages to chew on. The thinnest of
his novels, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' runs to 469 paperback
pages and the largest, ``Debt of Honor,'' to 990 pages.
<p>
   It's not just middlebrow readers who chew on them. Intellectuals
do too, although sometimes with reservations.
<p>
   Perhaps the most interestingly unapologetic case for reading
Clancy's novels was made by a literary critic, Marie Arana-Ward,
assistant editor of The Washington Post's Book World. In a 1993
review of ``Without Remorse'' she wrote:
<p>
   ``Let's get one thing straight right off. No one reads Tom
Clancy for his style. Not for us the prosey pirouette, the earnest
Bildungsroman, the mot juste, the finely limned character, the
universal slice of life. ... What Clancy manages to deliver to us
armchair warriors more often than not  &MD;  and `Without Remorse' is no
exception  &MD;  is a different kind of virtuosity: a meticulous
chronicle of military hardware, a confident stride through
corridors of power, an honest-to-God global war game, and a
vertiginous plot that dutifully tracks dozens of seemingly
disparate strands to a pyrotechnic finish.''
<p>
   When a reviewer of Arana-Ward's sophistication finds such
satisfaction in work that strikes you as uninteresting, you may
wonder if you're missing something. What some readers could be
missing in Clancy's novels, as Arana-Ward herself implies, is style
 &MD;  style defined here as a voice recognizably human.
<p>
   When an author's voice is human, good things usually follow:
plausible, compelling plot; characters with more than one
dimension; dialogue that rings true; and an airing of ideas that,
however passionate, transcends partisan politics.
<p>
   By this definition, style is the best gauge of a novelist's
value.
<p>
   None of which is meant to suggest that thrillers can't be
worthwhile  &MD;  think of those by Graham Greene, John Le Carre and
Charles McCarry, whose voices are so hypnotic that a single
exposure can put a spell on the reader's memory forever.
<p>
   Lacking human voice, Clancy's kind of thriller is just another
reminder that you can write about serious subjects  &MD;  nuclear war,
international terrorism, drug cartels  &MD;  without qualifying as a
serious novelist.
<p>
   To his credit, Clancy has shrugged off such criticism. He calls
himself an entertainer. That's fair.
<p>
   What clues to his popularity does Clancy's language yield?
<p>
   No reader who brings the cargo of skepticism that I do to the
examination of Clancy's novels would be likely to read all 6,480
pages of the ones mentioned. A narrowing was called for. I didn't
think it sporting to go looking for phrases or passages that would
make Clancy look bad  &MD;  a wickedly out-of-context selection can make
any author look bad  &MD;  so I settled on a nine-novel sampling keyed
to a simple progression.
<p>
   The first specimen quoted is the first sentence in the first
chapter of the first novel, the second specimen is the second
sentence in the second chapter of the second novel, and so on. Only
full sentences are cited, none of the heading lines the author
frequently uses. The sentences are out of context, of course, but
not by wicked design.
<p>
   Here they are:
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Hunt for Red October'': ``Captain First Rank Marko
Ramius of the Soviet Navy was dressed for the Arctic conditions
normal to the Northern Fleet submarine base at Polyarnyy.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Red Storm Rising'': ``The fire was detected by American
`National Technical Means,' a term that generally denotes
reconnaissance satellites operated by the Central Intelligence
Agency.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Patriot Games'': ``Six hundred miles away, a Sabena flight
was landing outside of Cork.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'': ```What about specific
technical information?'''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Clear and Present Danger'': ``He turned his head left and
right, inspecting his environment in the orange twilight that came
through the uncurtained windows.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Sum of All Fears'': ``It was slightly more complicated
than that, of course.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Without Remorse'': ``She still had her demons.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Debt of Honor'': ``The truck in the background was largely
intact, though its bumper was clearly distorted.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Executive Orders'': ``That made Ryan both easy and
impossible for the Russian to analyze.''
<p>
   What can be said about the foregoing? Chiefly this: The language
is undeniably English, uninspired but clear, and it sometimes veers
toward technical-manual usage.
<p>
   For many American readers, this approach is a point in Clancy's
favor. Such readers tend to like facts, figures and decisiveness.
They are unhappy when presented with stones unturned. They are very
unhappy when presented with ambiguity, except when it is confronted
by Clancy characters, who can be counted on to deal with it
unambiguously.
<p>
   What clues to Clancy's popularity can be found in his plots?
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Hunt for Red October'': A Soviet nuclear submarine
trying to defect to the United States must outmaneuver friend and
foe in the depths of the Atlantic. The possibility of a world war
is rarely out of mind. With the help of CIA analyst and former
Marine officer Jack Ryan, the Soviet sub cruises to freedom.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Red Storm Rising'': A world war has been triggered by Muslim
extremists who cripple USSR oil supplies. Soviet troops invade
Western Europe, and the battle is joined on land, at sea and in the
air. We win.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Patriot Games'': Private citizen Jack Ryan, vacationing in
London, foils an IRA assassination plot against the royals, is
wounded in the process and knighted for bravery, and then returns
to the States, where he is recruited back into the CIA and has to
battle the long arm of the IRA on his turf. He wins.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'': The United States and USSR
race to develop Star Wars technology against a global background.
Jack Ryan is in there pitching for America, and so is the
``cardinal'' of the title, an American mole. A world war is
averted. Everybody wins.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Clear and Present Danger'': The White House, sick and tired
of drug use here, launches an illegal shooting war on drug lords in
Colombia, but our troops start catching hell down there. CIA ace
Jack Ryan puts things right at home and abroad.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Sum of All Fears'': Now deputy director of the CIA, Jack
Ryan organizes a Middle East peace conference, which Arab heavies
want to unorganize with a nuclear surprise. There's a lot of
capital-hopping in this one. Ryan hops last and hops best.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Without Remorse'': A grateful nation lets Ryan sit this one
out. John Kelly, a former Navy SEAL, is waging a private war on
drug traffickers at home when his government recruits him for a
secret mission in Vietnam. Kelly kicks butt here and abroad.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Debt of Honor'': Mushroom clouds threaten again, so Ryan is
back  &MD;  as White House national security adviser  &MD;  and ready to
rumble. So are the Japanese, who sabotage America financially and
threaten to toast us with nuclear weapons. Ryan's reaction is so
brilliant that he is catapulted into the vice presidency.
<p>
   Even higher office is forthcoming after a Japanese hard-liner,
piloting a Boeing 747, uses his plane as a dart and the Capitol as
a dartboard, killing the president, among many other government
officials. Ryan thus completes the most remarkable 12-year grade
ascent in history.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Executive Orders'': As rookie President Jack Ryan tries to
put the country back together, sinister forces abroad lick their
chops. Among them are expansion-minded Iranians who want to force
the Ebola virus down our throats. Fat chance.
<p>
   Sure, some of the plots seem a little far-fetched, particularly
when summarized with comic intent. Far-fetched plotting or no, even
the most unsympathetic reader has to concede that Clancy grapples
with subjects full of dark dread for Americans.
<p>
   Probably the central reason Clancy succeeds so well with so many
readers is that he offers resolutions to problems apparently
intractable outside the pages of his books. His heroes have become
nothing less than national instruments of retribution for Americans
so frustrated by what bad people get away with in real life that
they're in a mood for rough justice in their reading matter.
<p>
   Clancy, the king of revenge, provides that and the bonus of an
insider's view of high-tech weaponry.
<p>
   As Mickey Spillane, John Wayne and Clint Eastwood did before
him, he puts a firm, reassuring hand on your shoulder, looks you in
the eye and says, ``Got a problem? Let me take care of it.''
<p>
   The next sound you hear is the lingering scream of some thug or
drug lord or villainous foreigner hurled into the abyss. How's the
weather down there, you swine?
<p>
   At least to this point Clancy has left the really spooky stuff  &MD; 
lawyers and supernatural terrors  &MD;  to Grisham and Stephen King, but
he has gone right to the gut of most other national anxieties. OK,
he hasn't done the space number yet, hasn't given us 900 pages of
asteroids being launched at Washington by a democracy-hating race
on Pluto.
<p>
   But all he needs is the time to do the research and devise
appropriately high-tech defensive measures. Meanwhile, he's
dreaming up war games.
<p>
   Maybe CD-ROM electronic war games have been Clancy's destiny all
along, as this passage from a 1986 Christopher Lehmann-Haupt review
in The New York Times suggests:

   This is the way the world ends.
<p>
   ``Mission briefing: Chinese hard-liners have staged a daring
raid on one of the world's last great untapped oil reserves,
setting the stage for a rejuvenated Communist dictatorship.
Representing the United States, you command an improved Los
Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine, the USS Cheyenne. Over 360
feet long and brimming with state-of-the-art electronic warfare
systems, she is the finest fast-attack submarine in the world. In
addition, you are backed by 133 of the best-trained submariners in
any naval fleet.''
<p>
   Novelist Tom Clancy's nuclear-tipped CD-ROM war game, ``SSN''  &MD; 
from which this call to arms is taken  &MD;  has fallen into the hands
of my 9-year-old son.
<p>
   As a consequence, the end of the world looms.
<p>
   The boy has always had an itchy trigger finger. Now he has the
means to employ it.
<p>
   In the last minutes left to us, it may be fitting to meditate on
how history could have come to this  &MD;  and fitting also to retrace
the steps that have led Clancy, arguably the most famous resident
of Maryland, to great wealth and astonishing popularity as a
novelist.
<p>
   According to Forbes magazine, Clancy made $15 million in 1995
and $16 million in 1996.
<p>
   A recent article in GQ by Peter Bart suggested that
super-popular writers such as Clancy and John Grisham have such
powerful brand names that ``no publisher can afford to pay them
what they demand. Hence, some publishing veterans believe the
authors will end up self-publishing and owning the copyrights.''
<p>
   Let's leave Grisham out of this and stick with Clancy. Why is he
so popular?
<p>
   From the beginning, Clancy has been in love with bells and
missiles, his plots brimming with state-of-the-art
electronic-warfare systems.
<p>
   His first novel launched the techno-thriller genre. This was
``The Hunt for Red October,'' published in 1984 to the applause of
the American public, which made his tale of submarine cat-and-mouse
games a remarkable best seller.
<p>
   Since then he has written more than a dozen other books, eight
of them novels about as popular as the first one.
<p>
   The eight are: ``Red Storm Rising'' (1986), ``Patriot Games''
(1987), ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' (1988), ``Clear and Present
Danger'' (1989), ``The Sum of All Fears'' (1991), ``Without
Remorse'' (1993), ``Debt of Honor'' (1994) and ``Executive Orders''
(1996).
<p>
   Clancy gives readers plenty of pages to chew on. The thinnest of
his novels, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' runs to 469 paperback
pages and the largest, ``Debt of Honor,'' to 990 pages.
<p>
   It's not just middlebrow readers who chew on them. Intellectuals
do too, although sometimes with reservations.
<p>
   Perhaps the most interestingly unapologetic case for reading
Clancy's novels was made by a literary critic, Marie Arana-Ward,
assistant editor of The Washington Post's Book World. In a 1993
review of ``Without Remorse'' she wrote:
<p>
   ``Let's get one thing straight right off. No one reads Tom
Clancy for his style. Not for us the prosey pirouette, the earnest
Bildungsroman, the mot juste, the finely limned character, the
universal slice of life. ... What Clancy manages to deliver to us
armchair warriors more often than not  &MD;  and `Without Remorse' is no
exception  &MD;  is a different kind of virtuosity: a meticulous
chronicle of military hardware, a confident stride through
corridors of power, an honest-to-God global war game, and a
vertiginous plot that dutifully tracks dozens of seemingly
disparate strands to a pyrotechnic finish.''
<p>
   When a reviewer of Arana-Ward's sophistication finds such
satisfaction in work that strikes you as uninteresting, you may
wonder if you're missing something. What some readers could be
missing in Clancy's novels, as Arana-Ward herself implies, is style
 &MD;  style defined here as a voice recognizably human.
<p>
   When an author's voice is human, good things usually follow:
plausible, compelling plot; characters with more than one
dimension; dialogue that rings true; and an airing of ideas that,
however passionate, transcends partisan politics.
<p>
   By this definition, style is the best gauge of a novelist's
value.
<p>
   None of which is meant to suggest that thrillers can't be
worthwhile  &MD;  think of those by Graham Greene, John Le Carre and
Charles McCarry, whose voices are so hypnotic that a single
exposure can put a spell on the reader's memory forever.
<p>
   Lacking human voice, Clancy's kind of thriller is just another
reminder that you can write about serious subjects  &MD;  nuclear war,
international terrorism, drug cartels  &MD;  without qualifying as a
serious novelist.
<p>
   To his credit, Clancy has shrugged off such criticism. He calls
himself an entertainer. That's fair.
<p>
   What clues to his popularity does Clancy's language yield?
<p>
   No reader who brings the cargo of skepticism that I do to the
examination of Clancy's novels would be likely to read all 6,480
pages of the ones mentioned. A narrowing was called for. I didn't
think it sporting to go looking for phrases or passages that would
make Clancy look bad  &MD;  a wickedly out-of-context selection can make
any author look bad  &MD;  so I settled on a nine-novel sampling keyed
to a simple progression.
<p>
   The first specimen quoted is the first sentence in the first
chapter of the first novel, the second specimen is the second
sentence in the second chapter of the second novel, and so on. Only
full sentences are cited, none of the heading lines the author
frequently uses. The sentences are out of context, of course, but
not by wicked design.
<p>
   Here they are:
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Hunt for Red October'': ``Captain First Rank Marko
Ramius of the Soviet Navy was dressed for the Arctic conditions
normal to the Northern Fleet submarine base at Polyarnyy.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Red Storm Rising'': ``The fire was detected by American
`National Technical Means,' a term that generally denotes
reconnaissance satellites operated by the Central Intelligence
Agency.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Patriot Games'': ``Six hundred miles away, a Sabena flight
was landing outside of Cork.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'': ```What about specific
technical information?'''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Clear and Present Danger'': ``He turned his head left and
right, inspecting his environment in the orange twilight that came
through the uncurtained windows.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Sum of All Fears'': ``It was slightly more complicated
than that, of course.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Without Remorse'': ``She still had her demons.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Debt of Honor'': ``The truck in the background was largely
intact, though its bumper was clearly distorted.''
<p>
    &MD;  ``Executive Orders'': ``That made Ryan both easy and
impossible for the Russian to analyze.''
<p>
   What can be said about the foregoing? Chiefly this: The language
is undeniably English, uninspired but clear, and it sometimes veers
toward technical-manual usage.
<p>
   For many American readers, this approach is a point in Clancy's
favor. Such readers tend to like facts, figures and decisiveness.
They are unhappy when presented with stones unturned. They are very
unhappy when presented with ambiguity, except when it is confronted
by Clancy characters, who can be counted on to deal with it
unambiguously.
<p>
   What clues to Clancy's popularity can be found in his plots?
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Hunt for Red October'': A Soviet nuclear submarine
trying to defect to the United States must outmaneuver friend and
foe in the depths of the Atlantic. The possibility of a world war
is rarely out of mind. With the help of CIA analyst and former
Marine officer Jack Ryan, the Soviet sub cruises to freedom.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Red Storm Rising'': A world war has been triggered by Muslim
extremists who cripple USSR oil supplies. Soviet troops invade
Western Europe, and the battle is joined on land, at sea and in the
air. We win.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Patriot Games'': Private citizen Jack Ryan, vacationing in
London, foils an IRA assassination plot against the royals, is
wounded in the process and knighted for bravery, and then returns
to the States, where he is recruited back into the CIA and has to
battle the long arm of the IRA on his turf. He wins.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Cardinal of the Kremlin'': The United States and USSR
race to develop Star Wars technology against a global background.
Jack Ryan is in there pitching for America, and so is the
``cardinal'' of the title, an American mole. A world war is
averted. Everybody wins.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Clear and Present Danger'': The White House, sick and tired
of drug use here, launches an illegal shooting war on drug lords in
Colombia, but our troops start catching hell down there. CIA ace
Jack Ryan puts things right at home and abroad.
<p>
    &MD;  ``The Sum of All Fears'': Now deputy director of the CIA, Jack
Ryan organizes a Middle East peace conference, which Arab heavies
want to unorganize with a nuclear surprise. There's a lot of
capital-hopping in this one. Ryan hops last and hops best.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Without Remorse'': A grateful nation lets Ryan sit this one
out. John Kelly, a former Navy SEAL, is waging a private war on
drug traffickers at home when his government recruits him for a
secret mission in Vietnam. Kelly kicks butt here and abroad.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Debt of Honor'': Mushroom clouds threaten again, so Ryan is
back  &MD;  as White House national security adviser  &MD;  and ready to
rumble. So are the Japanese, who sabotage America financially and
threaten to toast us with nuclear weapons. Ryan's reaction is so
brilliant that he is catapulted into the vice presidency.
<p>
   Even higher office is forthcoming after a Japanese hard-liner,
piloting a Boeing 747, uses his plane as a dart and the Capitol as
a dartboard, killing the president, among many other government
officials. Ryan thus completes the most remarkable 12-year grade
ascent in history.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Executive Orders'': As rookie President Jack Ryan tries to
put the country back together, sinister forces abroad lick their
chops. Among them are expansion-minded Iranians who want to force
the Ebola virus down our throats. Fat chance.
<p>
   Sure, some of the plots seem a little far-fetched, particularly
when summarized with comic intent. Far-fetched plotting or no, even
the most unsympathetic reader has to concede that Clancy grapples
with subjects full of dark dread for Americans.
<p>
   Probably the central reason Clancy succeeds so well with so many
readers is that he offers resolutions to problems apparently
intractable outside the pages of his books. His heroes have become
nothing less than national instruments of retribution for Americans
so frustrated by what bad people get away with in real life that
they're in a mood for rough justice in their reading matter.
<p>
   Clancy, the king of revenge, provides that and the bonus of an
insider's view of high-tech weaponry.
<p>
   As Mickey Spillane, John Wayne and Clint Eastwood did before
him, he puts a firm, reassuring hand on your shoulder, looks you in
the eye and says, ``Got a problem? Let me take care of it.''
<p>
   The next sound you hear is the lingering scream of some thug or
drug lord or villainous foreigner hurled into the abyss. How's the
weather down there, you swine?
<p>
   At least to this point Clancy has left the really spooky stuff  &MD; 
lawyers and supernatural terrors  &MD;  to Grisham and Stephen King, but
he has gone right to the gut of most other national anxieties. OK,
he hasn't done the space number yet, hasn't given us 900 pages of
asteroids being launched at Washington by a democracy-hating race
on Pluto.
<p>
   But all he needs is the time to do the research and devise
appropriately high-tech defensive measures. Meanwhile, he's
dreaming up war games.
<p>
   Maybe CD-ROM electronic war games have been Clancy's destiny all
along, as this passage from a 1986 Christopher Lehmann-Haupt review
in The New York Times suggests:
<p>
   ``... `Red Storm Rising' at its best is the verbal equivalent of
a high-tech video game. If only it could be projected on a
cathode-ray tube and read by scrolling its pages with a button or a
joystick. Or maybe it could even be animated somehow.''
<p>
   Lehmann-Haupt, meet Clancy's ``SSN.''
<p>
   We're about out of time now, folks. The end of the world is at
hand.
<p>
   ``This is not a drill! The missions you encounter during the
game lead you through realistic scenarios which could be taken from
tomorrow's headlines. Many of the threats you face are real; some
threats are hypothetical. All of them are dangerous. To succeed at
`SSN,' you must learn to think like a submarine commander.''
<p>

 &UR; c.1997 Reason Magazine &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; NOTE: Full-length article (3,500 words) available on request &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   Opponents of California's Proposition 215 and Arizona's
Proposition 200  &MD;  both of which allow doctors to recommend or
prescribe currently illegal drugs  &MD;  managed to drive home one basic
point.
<p>
   These ballot initiatives were, in the words of Clinton drug czar
Barry McCaffrey, ``a stalking horse for legalization.''
<p>
   The California measure, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates warned,
``wouldn't just legalize marijuana for medical use  &MD;  it would
legalize marijuana, period, with absolutely no controls on quality,
or dosage, or who can get it.''
<p>
   Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Mortenson told the Arizona
Republic, ``The message from Proposition 200 is: `Do drugs, so
what?'''
<p>
   ``What we have here,'' pronounced Dan Lungren, California's
attorney general, ``is a law flying under false colors.''
<p>
   But in the end, voters in both states who oppose drug
legalization remained unpersuaded.
<p>
   Indeed, the final tallies in November weren't even close: 56
percent of Californians favored Proposition 215, with 44 percent
opposed. Arizona's Proposition 200 scored an even more lopsided
win, 65 percent vs. 35 percent.
<p>
   The medical-use initiatives carried the day  &MD;  not because of any
new strong push for widescale legalization of marijuana but because
of the huge reservoir of sympathy people have for desperately ill
terminal patients and chronic-pain sufferers.
<p>
   Pre-election polls commissioned by Arizonans for Drug Policy
Reform, the group pushing Proposition 200, found fewer than
one-quarter of state residents favored legalization. But election
exit polls showed overwhelming support for medical use of marijuana
in every demographic group, including Republicans, conservatives
and Dole voters.
<p>
   In the wake of such success  &MD;  and national polls suggesting
receptiveness to the idea  &MD;  the medical-use movement is sure to
spread across the country.
<p>
   California for Medical Rights, one of the main proponents of
Proposition 215, has renamed itself Americans for Medical Rights
and plans to lobby for similar measures in other states.
<p>
   And Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who in 1995
introduced a medical marijuana law in Congress, says he will
introduce new legislation similar to the California initiative.
<p>
   These new propositions represent the most significant shift in
drug policy in recent years because they ``make the debate on
legalization possible for the first time,''in the words of the
chief organizer of the Arizona measure. They do so by challenging
the drug war's axiomatic assumption that ``illicit'' or ``illegal''
drugs are demonic substances that offer no possible benefits to
society.
<p>
   And as one tenet of the drug war's underlying philosophy is
opened to debate, it seems likely a more expansive reconsideration
of the whole enterprise may be in the offing.
<p>
   Although significant, that is a far cry from Gates' assertion
that California's Proposition 215 would ``legalize marijuana,
period.''
<p>
   Other opponents have raised the specter of ``pot doctors'' and
``Dr. Feelgoods'' who will indiscriminately provide fraudulent
medical certification for recreational users, effectively
legalizing drugs.
<p>
   In such a fractious debate it's important to appreciate what the
two initiatives  &MD;  deemed ``tremendous tragedies'' and ``dangerous
developments'' by drug czar McCaffrey  &MD;  write into law.
<p>
   California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996 grew largely out of
the experience of illegal but semi-tolerated ``buyers' clubs'' that
provide marijuana to chemotherapy, AIDS, glaucoma and chronic-pain
patients. One of the guiding forces behind the measure was Dennis
Peron, director of San Francisco's Cannabis Buyers Club, which has
more than 6,000 registered members.
<p>
   Peron, a co-author of the proposition, also heads Californians
for Compassionate Use, which, along with Californians for Medical
Rights, coordinated the campaign.
<p>
   In stumping for the measure, advocates stressed medical and
personal angles. Television spots featured oncologists, cancer
patients and widowed spouses discussing the ways in which medical
marijuana helped ease pain and suffering.
<p>
   Support for the initiative was strongest in and around urban
centers such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
Demographically, Proposition 215 polled well among most groups
other than Republicans and, interestingly, voters 65 and older.
<p>
   The pro-215 campaign spent about $2 million, much of it supplied
by out-of-state contributors including billionaire George Soros and
insurance magnate Peter Lewis. The measure closely resembles laws
twice passed by the California legislature but vetoed by Gov. Pete
Wilson.
<p>
   It allows patients to possess, grow and consume pot on a
doctor's ``recommendation'' that ``the person's health would
benefit from the use of marijuana'' in treating terminal illnesses
such as cancer, chronic pain or  &MD;  and this is what gave opponents
fits  &MD;  ``any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.''
<p>
   Proposition 215 also stipulates that a patient's ``primary
caregiver''  &MD;  defined as ``the individual designated by the person
... who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing,
health or safety of that person''  &MD;  is not subject to criminal
sanctions.
<p>
   Doctors recommending use would similarly be exempt from
punishment or other sorts of retribution, such as the lifting of
state medical licenses.
<p>
   The point man behind Arizona's Drug Medicalization, Prevention
and Control Act of 1996 was Phoenix-area millionaire John Sperling.
The head of the Apollo Group, a consortium of for-profit
educational institutions, Sperling says his interest in the issue
is ``purely public policy. I spent 10 years reading about drug
policy and never read a positive article.''
<p>
   He is emphatic: ``We have to medicalize drug use. We have to get
it out of the hands of the criminal-justice community and put it
into the hands of the public-health and medical community.''
<p>
   Toward that end, Sperling created Arizonans for Drug Policy
Reform and pulled together a high-profile board. Former Reagan
administration official John Norton served as chairman of a group
that included former Civil Aeronautics Board head Marvin S. Cohen,
State Court of Appeals Judge Rudolph S. Gerber and more than a
dozen prominent Arizona physicians.
<p>
   Sperling also convinced former Sens. Barry Goldwater and Dennis
DeConcini to publicly back the measure.
<p>
   As in California, advocates focussed on the inviolability of the
doctor-patient relationship, the nausea that accompanies cancer
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and the loss of appetite and
weight (wasting syndrome) in AIDS patients.
<p>
   Arizona's proposition enables doctors to prescribe any
``Schedule I'' drug  &MD;  a category that includes marijuana, heroin,
LSD, methamphetamine and other illegal substances  &MD;  if they can
cite research that ``supports'' a medical application and they
obtain a concurring written opinion from another doctor.
<p>
   Those prescriptions would provide a valid, legal defense against
drug possession or use charges.
<p>
   The act also includes a number of criminal-justice provisions
designed to ``medicalize'' the drug war: People without valid
prescriptions who are convicted of possession or use fewer than
three times can't get jail time; state prisoners serving time for
non-violent use or possession  &MD;  conceivably as many as 1,800 people
 &MD;  are immediately eligible for a parole hearing and possible
release.
<p>
   Parolees and newly convicted people must accept court-ordered
drug treatment and education and do community service. A
truth-in-sentencing provision holds that anyone convicted of
committing a violent crime while ``high'' must serve 100 percent of
his sentence.
<p>
   Organizers of both efforts remain emphatic that the acts cover
only legitimate, defensible medical use  &MD;  a position somewhat
undercut when Peron recently told The New York Times that ``all
marijuana use is medical  &MD;  except for kids.''
<p>
   Many difficult questions revolve around the interaction of the
new statutes with federal drug laws.
<p>
   For example, under federal law it remains illegal to
manufacture, use, possess or distribute any Schedule I drugs,
including marijuana. So even patients following doctors' orders  &MD; 
and complying with state laws  &MD;  are violating federal law.
<p>
   While doctors are already prohibited from prescribing Schedule I
drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) does license
physicians to prescribe Schedule II drugs such as morphine. The DEA
carefully tracks the use of Schedule II drugs and exercises
powerful oversight in that area.
<p>
   It is not clear if the feds will respond to doctors who
prescribe or recommend Schedule I drugs by pulling their ability to
prescribe Schedule II drugs.
<p>
   Indeed, it is not even clear how the DEA will learn that doctors
are prescribing marijuana or other Schedule I drugs, because those
prescriptions will not be filled by pharmacists or other health
officials who report to the government.
<p>
   The DEA's official position hardly clarifies the issue: ``The
passage of these propositions in no way alters the DEA's
fundamental mission: to enforce the federal drug laws of the United
States. The DEA intends to continue targeting the most significant
drug traffickers at home and abroad.''
<p>
   Because of limited resources, the DEA traditionally has ignored
individual users and small-time dealers, focusing on drug kingpins
and large commercial operations. The feds have largely left buyers'
clubs alone.
<p>
   But the California Medical Association has expressed fears that
doctors prescribing marijuana to more than a few patients will be
categorized as ``significant drug traffickers'' and either lose
their Schedule II privileges or be arrested.
<p>
   Given the overwhelming victories and the negative publicity
associated with hauling legitimate practitioners into court,
however, it is ``very unlikely'' that federal agents will go after
doctors, Frank says.
<p>
   At least in the short run, the DEA seems to be adopting a
wait-and-see posture.
<p>
   McCaffrey's office has announced plans to ``actively collect
data  &MD;  i.e., drug-related accident rates, teen pregnancy, work
absences, hospital emergency cases and the like  &MD;  which will
indicate the consequences of the referenda.''
<p>
   In fact, in the wake of the propositions, no one  &MD;  opponent or
proponent  &MD;  knows for sure what will happen.
<p>
   In California thousands of ``registered'' marijuana users
already receive their pot from buyers' clubs. And, says Dale
Gieringer, head of the California chapter of the National
Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws  &MD;  NORML  &MD;  ``scores'' of
doctors are already publicly ``recommending'' pot to patients.
<p>
   How much will medical-use rates fluctuate in the face of
Proposition 215? Will more doctors get with the program?
<p>
   ``There's no way to know,'' Gieringer says.
<p>
   Following the passage of both initiatives, perhaps only this
much is certain: A new conversation about drug policy is taking
place, one that actually requires state and federal governments to
enter into dialogue with citizens.
<p>
   ``Just say no'' has been answered with ``Tell us why.'' It is
not clear that the government will be able to hold up its end of
the discussion.
<p>
   McCaffrey, in his official statement lamenting the new state
laws, sputtered: ``We had support from former Presidents Ford,
Carter and Bush''  &MD;  as if a trinity of one-term former chief
executives would somehow provide a boost to any cause.
<p>
   However, as Americans for Medical Rights and other groups push
initiatives in other states, the conversation about the medical use
of currently illegal drugs is bound to continue.
<p>
   The California and Arizona initiatives ``give some real oomph''
to the medical-use debate, Frank says. ``They are another argument
for changing federal law.'' Although he concedes such a change is
unlikely to unfold quickly, he suggests that Congress will take
note of public opinion.
<p>
   Nor, despite what opponents claim, is there any reason to assume
that medical-use laws have any absolute link to legalization. While
people may be willing to expand the current pharmacopoeia, they are
not necessarily signing onto the idea that individuals should have
the right to decide what drugs they can take. Just as drug warriors
must explain themselves to a skeptical public, so too must
legalizers.
<p>
   The potential connection between medical use and legalization
is, in fact, a fairly subtle one.
<p>
   McCaffrey has suggested: ``There could not be a worse message to
young people than the provisions of these referenda. Just when the
nation is trying its hardest to educate teen-agers not to use
psychoactive drugs, now they are being told that marijuana and
other drugs are good, they are medicine.''
<p>
   On one level, such an equation is absurd. People  &MD;  including
teen-agers  &MD;  don't take drugs recreationally because they are
certified as ``good'' medicine. If they did, we could expect a run
on any number of drugs, ranging from Kaopectate to penicillin.
<p>
   At the same time, redefining marijuana as medicine makes people
less likely to automatically agree that it is an unmitigated evil.
<p>
   The real contribution of medical marijuana to the larger debate
on legalization is that it may well put the lie to official claims
about drugs. Lungren, for instance, has said that smoking or eating
marijuana has no beneficial medical effect  &MD;  even though he allows
that Marinol, a prescription version of THC, the active ingredient
in marijuana, has some value.
<p>
   At the very least, recent events will focus more critical
scrutiny on government statements. When McCaffrey presents his
evidence of the ``inevitable result of the referenda,'' he will
have to work to convince his audience.
<p>
   Yale Law School Professor Steven B. Duke suggests that if the
public sees more and more people using marijuana medically and
testifying to its value, they may rethink their position on it.
<p>
   ``There might be a recognition as well that the government is
lying in other areas of drug policy too,'' says Duke, co-author of
``America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against
Drugs.'' He adds: ``Among prohibitionists, there's a sense that if
you give an inch, you lose everything. That's certainly the case
with opponents of medical marijuana.''
<p>
   Ironically, the failure to compromise on a relatively
non-controversial topic such as medical marijuana could open the
door to a much broader rejection of the drug war.
<p>
   It is in this sense that the initiatives have, as Sperling puts
it, made the ``debate on legalization'' possible. What shape it
will take and what ends it will achieve are far from certain.
<p>
   Judging from poll data, there is currently little support for
legalization.
<p>
   But as the passage of Propositions 200 and 215 forces
prohibitionists to justify their policies, and the country's
experience with medical use of illegal substances gets under way,
that debate should prove to be one full of possibilities.

 &UR; NOTE: Full-length article (3,500 words) available on request &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   Opponents of California's Proposition 215 and Arizona's
Proposition 200  &MD;  both of which allow doctors to recommend or
prescribe currently illegal drugs  &MD;  managed to drive home one basic
point.
<p>
   These ballot initiatives were, in the words of Clinton drug czar
Barry McCaffrey, ``a stalking horse for legalization.''
<p>
   The California measure, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates warned,
``wouldn't just legalize marijuana for medical use  &MD;  it would
legalize marijuana, period, with absolutely no controls on quality,
or dosage, or who can get it.''
<p>
   Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Mortenson told the Arizona
Republic, ``The message from Proposition 200 is: `Do drugs, so
what?'''
<p>
   ``What we have here,'' pronounced Dan Lungren, California's
attorney general, ``is a law flying under false colors.''
<p>
   But in the end, voters in both states who oppose drug
legalization remained unpersuaded.
<p>
   Indeed, the final tallies in November weren't even close: 56
percent of Californians favored Proposition 215, with 44 percent
opposed. Arizona's Proposition 200 scored an even more lopsided
win, 65 percent vs. 35 percent.
<p>
   The medical-use initiatives carried the day  &MD;  not because of any
new strong push for widescale legalization of marijuana but because
of the huge reservoir of sympathy people have for desperately ill
terminal patients and chronic-pain sufferers.
<p>
   Pre-election polls commissioned by Arizonans for Drug Policy
Reform, the group pushing Proposition 200, found fewer than
one-quarter of state residents favored legalization. But election
exit polls showed overwhelming support for medical use of marijuana
in every demographic group, including Republicans, conservatives
and Dole voters.
<p>
   In the wake of such success  &MD;  and national polls suggesting
receptiveness to the idea  &MD;  the medical-use movement is sure to
spread across the country.
<p>
   California for Medical Rights, one of the main proponents of
Proposition 215, has renamed itself Americans for Medical Rights
and plans to lobby for similar measures in other states.
<p>
   And Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who in 1995
introduced a medical marijuana law in Congress, says he will
introduce new legislation similar to the California initiative.
<p>
   These new propositions represent the most significant shift in
drug policy in recent years because they ``make the debate on
legalization possible for the first time,''in the words of the
chief organizer of the Arizona measure. They do so by challenging
the drug war's axiomatic assumption that ``illicit'' or ``illegal''
drugs are demonic substances that offer no possible benefits to
society.
<p>
   And as one tenet of the drug war's underlying philosophy is
opened to debate, it seems likely a more expansive reconsideration
of the whole enterprise may be in the offing.
<p>
   Although significant, that is a far cry from Gates' assertion
that California's Proposition 215 would ``legalize marijuana,
period.''
<p>
   Other opponents have raised the specter of ``pot doctors'' and
``Dr. Feelgoods'' who will indiscriminately provide fraudulent
medical certification for recreational users, effectively
legalizing drugs.
<p>
   In such a fractious debate it's important to appreciate what the
two initiatives  &MD;  deemed ``tremendous tragedies'' and ``dangerous
developments'' by drug czar McCaffrey  &MD;  write into law.
<p>
   California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996 grew largely out of
the experience of illegal but semi-tolerated ``buyers' clubs'' that
provide marijuana to chemotherapy, AIDS, glaucoma and chronic-pain
patients. One of the guiding forces behind the measure was Dennis
Peron, director of San Francisco's Cannabis Buyers Club, which has
more than 6,000 registered members.
<p>
   Peron, a co-author of the proposition, also heads Californians
for Compassionate Use, which, along with Californians for Medical
Rights, coordinated the campaign.
<p>
   In stumping for the measure, advocates stressed medical and
personal angles. Television spots featured oncologists, cancer
patients and widowed spouses discussing the ways in which medical
marijuana helped ease pain and suffering.
<p>
   Support for the initiative was strongest in and around urban
centers such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
Demographically, Proposition 215 polled well among most groups
other than Republicans and, interestingly, voters 65 and older.
<p>
   The pro-215 campaign spent about $2 million, much of it supplied
by out-of-state contributors including billionaire George Soros and
insurance magnate Peter Lewis. The measure closely resembles laws
twice passed by the California legislature but vetoed by Gov. Pete
Wilson.
<p>
   It allows patients to possess, grow and consume pot on a
doctor's ``recommendation'' that ``the person's health would
benefit from the use of marijuana'' in treating terminal illnesses
such as cancer, chronic pain or  &MD;  and this is what gave opponents
fits  &MD;  ``any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.''
<p>
   Proposition 215 also stipulates that a patient's ``primary
caregiver''  &MD;  defined as ``the individual designated by the person
... who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing,
health or safety of that person''  &MD;  is not subject to criminal
sanctions.
<p>
   Doctors recommending use would similarly be exempt from
punishment or other sorts of retribution, such as the lifting of
state medical licenses.
<p>
   The point man behind Arizona's Drug Medicalization, Prevention
and Control Act of 1996 was Phoenix-area millionaire John Sperling.
The head of the Apollo Group, a consortium of for-profit
educational institutions, Sperling says his interest in the issue
is ``purely public policy. I spent 10 years reading about drug
policy and never read a positive article.''
<p>
   He is emphatic: ``We have to medicalize drug use. We have to get
it out of the hands of the criminal-justice community and put it
into the hands of the public-health and medical community.''
<p>
   Toward that end, Sperling created Arizonans for Drug Policy
Reform and pulled together a high-profile board. Former Reagan
administration official John Norton served as chairman of a group
that included former Civil Aeronautics Board head Marvin S. Cohen,
State Court of Appeals Judge Rudolph S. Gerber and more than a
dozen prominent Arizona physicians.
<p>
   Sperling also convinced former Sens. Barry Goldwater and Dennis
DeConcini to publicly back the measure.
<p>
   As in California, advocates focussed on the inviolability of the
doctor-patient relationship, the nausea that accompanies cancer
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and the loss of appetite and
weight (wasting syndrome) in AIDS patients.
<p>
   Arizona's proposition enables doctors to prescribe any
``Schedule I'' drug  &MD;  a category that includes marijuana, heroin,
LSD, methamphetamine and other illegal substances  &MD;  if they can
cite research that ``supports'' a medical application and they
obtain a concurring written opinion from another doctor.
<p>
   Those prescriptions would provide a valid, legal defense against
drug possession or use charges.
<p>
   The act also includes a number of criminal-justice provisions
designed to ``medicalize'' the drug war: People without valid
prescriptions who are convicted of possession or use fewer than
three times can't get jail time; state prisoners serving time for
non-violent use or possession  &MD;  conceivably as many as 1,800 people
 &MD;  are immediately eligible for a parole hearing and possible
release.
<p>
   Parolees and newly convicted people must accept court-ordered
drug treatment and education and do community service. A
truth-in-sentencing provision holds that anyone convicted of
committing a violent crime while ``high'' must serve 100 percent of
his sentence.
<p>
   Organizers of both efforts remain emphatic that the acts cover
only legitimate, defensible medical use  &MD;  a position somewhat
undercut when Peron recently told The New York Times that ``all
marijuana use is medical  &MD;  except for kids.''
<p>
   Many difficult questions revolve around the interaction of the
new statutes with federal drug laws.
<p>
   For example, under federal law it remains illegal to
manufacture, use, possess or distribute any Schedule I drugs,
including marijuana. So even patients following doctors' orders  &MD; 
and complying with state laws  &MD;  are violating federal law.
<p>
   While doctors are already prohibited from prescribing Schedule I
drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) does license
physicians to prescribe Schedule II drugs such as morphine. The DEA
carefully tracks the use of Schedule II drugs and exercises
powerful oversight in that area.
<p>
   It is not clear if the feds will respond to doctors who
prescribe or recommend Schedule I drugs by pulling their ability to
prescribe Schedule II drugs.
<p>
   Indeed, it is not even clear how the DEA will learn that doctors
are prescribing marijuana or other Schedule I drugs, because those
prescriptions will not be filled by pharmacists or other health
officials who report to the government.
<p>
   The DEA's official position hardly clarifies the issue: ``The
passage of these propositions in no way alters the DEA's
fundamental mission: to enforce the federal drug laws of the United
States. The DEA intends to continue targeting the most significant
drug traffickers at home and abroad.''
<p>
   Because of limited resources, the DEA traditionally has ignored
individual users and small-time dealers, focusing on drug kingpins
and large commercial operations. The feds have largely left buyers'
clubs alone.
<p>
   But the California Medical Association has expressed fears that
doctors prescribing marijuana to more than a few patients will be
categorized as ``significant drug traffickers'' and either lose
their Schedule II privileges or be arrested.
<p>
   Given the overwhelming victories and the negative publicity
associated with hauling legitimate practitioners into court,
however, it is ``very unlikely'' that federal agents will go after
doctors, Frank says.
<p>
   At least in the short run, the DEA seems to be adopting a
wait-and-see posture.
<p>
   McCaffrey's office has announced plans to ``actively collect
data  &MD;  i.e., drug-related accident rates, teen pregnancy, work
absences, hospital emergency cases and the like  &MD;  which will
indicate the consequences of the referenda.''
<p>
   In fact, in the wake of the propositions, no one  &MD;  opponent or
proponent  &MD;  knows for sure what will happen.
<p>
   In California thousands of ``registered'' marijuana users
already receive their pot from buyers' clubs. And, says Dale
Gieringer, head of the California chapter of the National

 &UR; THE (UNHOLY) TRANSFORMATION OF GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS &LR; 
 &UR; By MAX FRANKEL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The New York Times Magazine &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   The overnight transformation of George Stephanopoulos from
partisan pitchman to TV journalist highlights a disturbing
phenomenon: the progressive collapse of the walls that
traditionally separated news from propaganda.
<p>
   Max Frankel is the former Washington Bureau chief, editorial

   Two years ago, while Rwanda's Hutu militias were murdering half
a million Tutsis, most of them men, Hutu soldiers and civilians
also raped more than 250,000 women. Never having enjoyed a
particularly high status even in the best of times, these women now
are in the most dire straits. Elizabeth Royte is a contributing

<p>
   According to Forbes magazine, novelist Tom Clancy made $15
million in 1995 and $16 million in 1996. A recent article in GQ by
Peter Bart suggested that super-popular writers such as Clancy and
John Grisham have such powerful brand names that ``no publisher can
afford to pay them what they demand.'' Now Clancy's released a
CD-ROM war game, ``SSN.'' What's the secret of this guy's wild
success? Dick Victory is senior editor at Washingtonian Magazine.

<p>
   The advertising world is scrambling for new ways to pull dollars
out of Web sites.
<p>
   It is early summer 1996.
<p>
   Representatives from the digital publishing universe of e-zines,
on-line services, interactive marketing agencies and
forward-thinking advertising companies huddle in Manhattan's
McGraw-Hill building, the bastion of the mainstream print world.
<p>
   Players from companies such as Starwave Corp., Time Inc. New
Media, Infoseek, CNET and The Microsoft Network are here to
temporarily put aside their fierce rivalries and form the Internet
Advertising Bureau (IAB).
<p>
   Their mission: bring a unified voice to a chaotic new industry.
<p>
   But in the midst of this lofty goal-setting, the advertisers  &MD; 
the people who write the checks that sustain many a Web site  &MD;  make
it clear they want a new role in the brave new world of the
Internet.
<p>
   No longer are they content to simply paste their ads on a
cracker-sized piece of Web real estate. And forget about trying to
attract attention through gimmicky multicolored on-screen
``eyeballs'' that blink when you click them.
<p>
   Instead, advertisers want to work hand in hand with publishers
to co-produce the material that packs Web pages. In essence, they
want to abolish the Web as we know it.
<p>
   The formation of the IAB is just the latest sign that forces are
trying to turn the once-eclectic Web into the ultimate 24-hour
marketing machine.
<p>
   WebTrack, a New York agency that keeps tabs on advertising
dollars, says Web ad spending in the second quarter of 1996 was
about $43 million, a 347 percent increase over the fourth quarter
of 1995.
<p>
   But while Web advertising has increased sharply during the past
year, it's only a tiny fraction of the $60 billion spent on ads in
traditional media last year, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, a tracking service in New York.
<p>
   Flashy banner ads, which are meant to entice surfers to click
through to a company's homepage and buy some loot, just aren't
going to satisfy that shortfall. Banner ads are tired, boring and
too much like junk mail  &MD;  pricey junk mail at that. Although these
ads may cost as much as $10,000 per month, researchers have
discovered that for every 100 visitors who take note of an
advertising banner, only three to 13 actually open it.
<p>
   Hunter Madsen, who was a senior partner at the J. Walter
Thompson/USA advertising agency before joining HotWired as vice
president of commercial strategy, says that banners are useful but
limited.
<p>
   ``Those who are disgruntled about banners misunderstand their
value,'' Madsen says. ``Web publishers and ad agencies expect them
to do more than they can and base unrealistic projections on
that.''
<p>
   What's next?
<p>
   Enter sponsorships, where independent on-line publishers cozy up
to a few major advertising sugar daddies and forge a
content-and-design partnership. Sponsorships are not cheap,
typically costing $20,000 to $50,000 per month. But advertisers
consider the cost a whole lot cheaper than creating a glitzy
corporate homepage to attract new shoppers. Instead, homepages can
be used simply to assist existing customers.
<p>
   Symbiotically, publishers who accept sponsorships can
concentrate on the business at hand  &MD;  providing compelling content
 &MD;  without tending to the business of drumming up ads for jeans or
spaghetti sauce.
<p>
   But if banners are boring, sponsorships can be specious. For
those who like their content independent and provocative, the new
hybrid of news and salesmanship can be unnerving.
<p>
   Nike, for instance, entered the Web in the summer of 1996 by
wrapping its trademark swirl around a service providing information
about Olympians sponsored by the footwear baron.
<p>
   Nike is hardly alone. Earlier this year Bristol-Myers Squibb
unveiled its Women's Link site, complete with beauty tips,
celebrity interviews and technology guides. Chivas Regal recently
launched its Career Toolbox, a splashy site that dispenses advice
on job hunting and starting a business.
<p>
   Another egregious example of the fuzzy line between objective
journalism and good-time advertising is Parent Soup, a free
information and entertainment Web site developed by iVillage in New
York.
<p>
   The site is designed for busy, tech-savvy parents and is backed
by America Online and a slew of other corporate sponsors:
Hewlett-Packard, Toyota, Polaroid, MGM/UA and Starbucks. Together
these sponsors paid about $1 million and had to sign on for at
least six months  &MD;  a huge commitment by Web ad standards.
<p>
   Instead of banners, sponsors are encouraged to put
parent-focused marketing information on a ``minisite'' embedded
into Parent Soup. iVillage assigns a special staff to help write
and edit text, fine-tune artwork and coordinate promotions on the
minisite, making sure the content is aimed specifically at parents.
<p>
   Polaroid, for instance, offers tips about how Mom and Dad can
boost their kids' self-esteem using instant photos. Every Friday
the MGM/UA-sponsored entertainment area highlights a family movie
and gives away videos. The site includes two lists of top kiddie
videos. One gives info on videos from various movie studios, the
other only MGM videos.
<p>
   Longtime journalist Chris Barr, editor in chief at CNET,
believes such sites can be duplicitous and misleading.
<p>
   ``Advertising must be clearly marked, or else you're
compromising the content. There may be short-term benefits, but in
the long term you really hurt the publication,'' Barr says.
<p>
   Alan McAdams, professor of managerial economics at Cornell
University, says that if advertising masquerades as objective
content it can damage the believability of the entire Web.
<p>
   ``How are users going to get information that isn't tainted by
advertisers' hype?'' he asks. ``Look at the Olympics, an event that
was so heavily commercialized the atmosphere around it was
fouled.''
<p>
   Welcome to the new world, advertisers say.
<p>
   ``Maybe the world has matured so that we understand the reality
of the media and don't pretend that we have to separate church and
state and remove advertising from editorial,'' argues Robert
Levitan, iVillage cofounder and senior vice president of market
development.
<p>
   But what Levitan is espousing also serves as ``advertorial,'' as
print magazines call it.
<p>
   ``The public understands that we need sponsors, and we want to
bring them to our audience in a useful way,'' Levitan explains.
``We aren't crossing any line. We're creating a whole new line.''
<p>
   There goes the neighborhood.
<p>
   Advertisers also want to know about the age, income and
interests of individual users. This allows them to make ``the
perfect offer'' to promising customers.
<p>
   One way to hone their attack is through DoubleClick, a New York
advertising network that serves both Web sites and advertisers
looking to reach Web walkers.
<p>
   How does it work? Let's say the last time you went on line you
clicked on pages about travel, surfboards and Hawaii. The sites
alert DoubleClick's software, which notes that those packets of
data went to your Internet address.
<p>
   The software begins to build a profile of your characteristics,
including e-mail address, location and consumer interests. After
DoubleClick's software has scanned your profile and gathered enough
clues to guess that you might be interested in a Pacific cruise, it
instantly uploads a customized ad  &MD;  all within milliseconds of your
signing on.
<p>
   Since March 1996, DoubleClick has identified the cruising
preferences of about 10 million Web surfers and is adding about
100,000 every day.
<p>
   Another tactic is to reward Web walkers with special discount
coupons, sweepstakes drawings, free software, cheap T-shirts  &MD;  just
like the old media.
<p>
   Kids.com, for instance, is filled with children's games, stories
and product information. Kids.com gives a child prizes for
providing basic information about their family, household size,
hobbies and buying habits. Like many sites, Kids.com doesn't fully
disclose how the information is used.
<p>
   This has sparked some heated privacy debates.
<p>
   ``Readers have a right to be informed about the privacy
consequences of an on-line transaction before entering into one,''
insists Lori Fena, executive director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.
<p>
   To address these concerns the group, along with others, plans to
create a system that rates the privacy of a site.
<p>
   Some Web ad reps insist the privacy problem is overblown, saying
consumers are already accustomed to credit-card companies, for
instance, sharing information about their customers' buying habits.
<p>
   But every day new marketing devices that blend the concepts of
banners, TV commercials and sponsorship programs are being foisted
on the Web.
<p>
   And it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to see the Web
transforming from a country hamlet into store-studded,
billboard-blanketed suburbia, a place where chain outlets replace
neighborhood hangouts and big brands are invited to plaster their
logos on nearly anything that moves.

too much like junk mail  &MD;  pricey junk mail at that. Although these
ads may cost as much as $10,000 per month, researchers have
discovered that for every 100 visitors who take note of an
advertising banner, only three to 13 actually open it.
<p>
   Hunter Madsen, who was a senior partner at the J. Walter
Thompson/USA advertising agency before joining HotWired as vice
president of commercial strategy, says that banners are useful but
limited.
<p>
   ``Those who are disgruntled about banners misunderstand their
value,'' Madsen says. ``Web publishers and ad agencies expect them
to do more than they can and base unrealistic projections on
that.''
<p>
   What's next?
<p>
   Enter sponsorships, where independent on-line publishers cozy up
to a few major advertising sugar daddies and forge a
content-and-design partnership. Sponsorships are not cheap,
typically costing $20,000 to $50,000 per month. But advertisers
consider the cost a whole lot cheaper than creating a glitzy
corporate homepage to attract new shoppers. Instead, homepages can
be used simply to assist existing customers.
<p>
   Symbiotically, publishers who accept sponsorships can
concentrate on the business at hand  &MD;  providing compelling content
 &MD;  without tending to the business of drumming up ads for jeans or
spaghetti sauce.
<p>
   But if banners are boring, sponsorships can be specious. For
those who like their content independent and provocative, the new
hybrid of news and salesmanship can be unnerving.
<p>
   Nike, for instance, entered the Web in the summer of 1996 by
wrapping its trademark swirl around a service providing information
about Olympians sponsored by the footwear baron.
<p>
   Nike is hardly alone. Earlier this year Bristol-Myers Squibb
unveiled its Women's Link site, complete with beauty tips,
celebrity interviews and technology guides. Chivas Regal recently
launched its Career Toolbox, a splashy site that dispenses advice
on job hunting and starting a business.
<p>
   Another egregious example of the fuzzy line between objective
journalism and good-time advertising is Parent Soup, a free
information and entertainment Web site developed by iVillage in New
York.
<p>
   The site is designed for busy, tech-savvy parents and is backed
by America Online and a slew of other corporate sponsors:
Hewlett-Packard, Toyota, Polaroid, MGM/UA and Starbucks. Together
these sponsors paid about $1 million and had to sign on for at
least six months  &MD;  a huge commitment by Web ad standards.
<p>
   Instead of banners, sponsors are encouraged to put
parent-focused marketing information on a ``minisite'' embedded
into Parent Soup. iVillage assigns a special staff to help write
and edit text, fine-tune artwork and coordinate promotions on the
minisite, making sure the content is aimed specifically at parents.
<p>
   Polaroid, for instance, offers tips about how Mom and Dad can
boost their kids' self-esteem using instant photos. Every Friday
the MGM/UA-sponsored entertainment area highlights a family movie
and gives away videos. The site includes two lists of top kiddie
videos. One gives info on videos from various movie studios, the
other only MGM videos.
<p>
   Longtime journalist Chris Barr, editor in chief at CNET,
believes such sites can be duplicitous and misleading.
<p>
   ``Advertising must be clearly marked, or else you're
compromising the content. There may be short-term benefits, but in
the long term you really hurt the publication,'' Barr says.
<p>
   Alan McAdams, professor of managerial economics at Cornell
University, says that if advertising masquerades as objective
content it can damage the believability of the entire Web.
<p>
   ``How are users going to get information that isn't tainted by
advertisers' hype?'' he asks. ``Look at the Olympics, an event that
was so heavily commercialized the atmosphere around it was
fouled.''
<p>
   Welcome to the new world, advertisers say.
<p>
   ``Maybe the world has matured so that we understand the reality
of the media and don't pretend that we have to separate church and
state and remove advertising from editorial,'' argues Robert
Levitan, iVillage cofounder and senior vice president of market
development.
<p>
   But what Levitan is espousing also serves as ``advertorial,'' as
print magazines call it.
<p>
   ``The public understands that we need sponsors, and we want to
bring them to our audience in a useful way,'' Levitan explains.
``We aren't crossing any line. We're creating a whole new line.''
<p>
   There goes the neighborhood.
<p>
   Advertisers also want to know about the age, income and
interests of individual users. This allows them to make ``the
perfect offer'' to promising customers.
<p>
   One way to hone their attack is through DoubleClick, a New York
advertising network that serves both Web sites and advertisers
looking to reach Web walkers.
<p>
   How does it work? Let's say the last time you went on line you
clicked on pages about travel, surfboards and Hawaii. The sites
alert DoubleClick's software, which notes that those packets of
data went to your Internet address.
<p>
   The software begins to build a profile of your characteristics,
including e-mail address, location and consumer interests. After
DoubleClick's software has scanned your profile and gathered enough
clues to guess that you might be interested in a Pacific cruise, it
instantly uploads a customized ad  &MD;  all within milliseconds of your
signing on.
<p>
   Since March 1996, DoubleClick has identified the cruising
preferences of about 10 million Web surfers and is adding about
100,000 every day.
<p>
   Another tactic is to reward Web walkers with special discount
coupons, sweepstakes drawings, free software, cheap T-shirts  &MD;  just
like the old media.
<p>
   Kids.com, for instance, is filled with children's games, stories
and product information. Kids.com gives a child prizes for
providing basic information about their family, household size,
hobbies and buying habits. Like many sites, Kids.com doesn't fully
disclose how the information is used.
<p>
   This has sparked some heated privacy debates.
<p>
   ``Readers have a right to be informed about the privacy
consequences of an on-line transaction before entering into one,''
insists Lori Fena, executive director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.
<p>
   To address these concerns the group, along with others, plans to
create a system that rates the privacy of a site.
<p>
   Some Web ad reps insist the privacy problem is overblown, saying
consumers are already accustomed to credit-card companies, for
instance, sharing information about their customers' buying habits.
<p>
   But every day new marketing devices that blend the concepts of
banners, TV commercials and sponsorship programs are being foisted
on the Web.
<p>
   And it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to see the Web
transforming from a country hamlet into store-studded,
billboard-blanketed suburbia, a place where chain outlets replace
neighborhood hangouts and big brands are invited to plaster their
logos on nearly anything that moves.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said it
will start a mutual fund ``supermarket'' in March, in a bid to give
its clients a greater selection of mutual funds to buy.
<p>
   The nation's biggest brokerage firm joins a number of other
mutual fund companies and brokerages in offering a supermarket
product, which typically offer customers the chance to buy a number
of different mutual funds managed by different companies.
<p>
   ``The strategy is to give the client more choices,'' said Arthur
Urciuoli, senior vice president in Merrill's private client group.
<p>
   The Merrill lynch fund supermarket will give customers a choice
of 1,100 different mutual funds, including 110 managed by Merrill
Lynch.
<p>
   Charles Schwab Corp. offered the first fund supermarket in 1992,
called OneSource, which now handles some $39 billion. OneSource's
success has spawned several imitations, including products from
Quick &AMP; Reilly Inc., Smith Barney and Fidelity Investments.
<p>
   The move follows Merrill's introduction of a program called
Merrill Lynch Financial Advantage Service, which offers U.S.
clients securities trading, mutual funds and financial planning for
one annual fee.
<p>
   Clients who use the program won't pay brokerage commissions for
a limited number of trades and will get financial advice and price
reductions on other services such as margin loans and mortgages.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks retreated as
International Business Machines Corp.'s weaker-than-expected profit
dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower.
<p>
   Weak demand for a $17.5 billion sale of two-year government
notes boosted yields, contributing to stocks' retreat.
<p>
   The Dow industrials fell 68.50 to 6815.40, with some 31 points
of the decline attributable to IBM. The world's largest computer
maker sank 10 to 159 3/8.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't the market's overvalued in the context of all of
the positives,'' he said. ``You have declining interest rates;
corporate America's become more profitable and more competitive.
We're in an hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Dean Witter Discover Co. added
surprisingly strong earnings announcements to this week's pile of
profit reports, helping broader averages set records for a fifth
straight session.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which comprises 75
percent of the market capitalization of U.S. stocks, gained 0.30 to
783.02, losing a 2.54-point gain after bonds retreated. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, General Electric Co. and Intel Corp. offset IBM's decline.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes many computer stocks,
gained 5.87 to 1382.84, after rising as much as 10.30 points.
Microsoft Corp. led the advance for a third day.
<p>
   Stocks fell back after the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond rose 3 basis points to 6.81 percent. The yield is used as a
benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, so when it rises it can
hurt companies' bottom lines.

 &UR; By MARIO SZICHMAN &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   The era in which the heroine we call Evita forged her career was
an exciting one for actresses.
<p>
   In the late 1930s, in Buenos Aires  &MD;  performing as Eva Durante  &MD; 
she landed a few small parts in a weekly radio series.
<p>
   By 1943, as Eva Duarte, she had a few minor film roles and then
became a star in a radio soap opera called ``My Kingdom for Love.''
There she began to enact roles of famous women  &MD;  public figures
whose lives might have given the future first lady a few ideas on
how to achieve immortality.
<p>
   Among those roles were Queen Elizabeth I; Empress Josephine, who
was Napoleon's wife; Madame Chiang Kai-shek; and Tsarina Alexandra
of Russia, who was killed with her entire family by the Bolsheviks.
Their lives might have carried a vital lesson: to neither be a
widow nor to die simultaneously with one's husband.
<p>
   By 1943 in Argentina, members of the ruling military junta were
in strong sympathy with the Axis nations  &MD;  Japan, Italy and
Germany. Taking a political cue from such unsavory role models as
Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, they also imitated the Nazi and
fascist predilection for choosing mistresses who were chorus girls
and actresses.
<p>
   By 1944, when Evita caught the eye of Col. Juan Peron, she was
having a passing affair with another colonel, Anibal Imbert, who
was considerably down from Peron on the scale of power, as the
minister of communications.
<p>
   But when the owner of the radio station where Evita was the star
learned about her relationship with Imbert, he immediately raised
her salary from 150 pesos to 5,000 per month.
<p>
   It was an intelligent decision taking into account that one of
the tasks of the Ministry of Communications was to control the
radio stations.
<p>
   At the time, competition among actresses to win the minds and
hearts of colonels was a ferocious game. Politicians and
journalists were able to detect which colonels were rapidly
ascending the power ladder just by taking a look at which actresses
they were escorting. It seemed that the more prominent the actress,
the more promising the colonel's career.
<p>
   Evita was one of those leading ladies who fought strenuously to
stay in the race.
<p>
   One story that circulated during this time was that she met
Peron during a fund-raising effort for victims of an earthquake
that destroyed the northern city of San Juan. Evita was escorted to
the event by Imbert.
<p>
   But when she saw Libertad Lamarque, the famous actress and tango
singer, talking to Peron  &MD;  the driving force in the ruling military
 &MD;  Evita asked to be introduced. It was the last time she and
Lamarque were on friendly terms. From then on, there was a
relentless feud between them, which ended on the set of the movie
``The Circus Cavalcade,'' which they were both filming.
<p>
   One day Evita, trying to show that circumstances had changed
after her engagement to Peron, decided to sit in the chair with
Libertad Lamarque's name on it. The star reacted by making the
worst mistake of her life: She slapped Evita's face.
<p>
   In 1946, after Peron became president, Lamarque was forced into
exile in Mexico City and her films were banned in Argentina.
<p>
   (``There is no more freedom in Argentina after Libertad left the
country,'' complained the opposition, making a word play with
Lamarque's first name.)
<p>
   It is difficult to imagine what could have happened in
Argentina, though, if Lamarque had married Peron instead of Evita.
As difficult, perhaps, as trying to imagine what could have
happened if the prim actress Ann Archer had landed Evita's role in
the blockbuster movie instead of Golden Globe-winner Madonna.
<p>
   But knowing the personalities of Lamarque and Evita, it is safe
to assume that the former, who had a basically demure personality,
would not have become immortal in Argentinean politics. Evita,
however, was all fire.
<p>
   In spite of the age difference between Evita  &MD;  who was 24  &MD;  and
Peron  &MD;  who was 48 when they first met  &MD;  she was an equal partner
in the marriage.
<p>
   Nothing in common with the other Eva, the mistress of Hitler,
who followed the Fuehrer, in eating a piece of wedding cake and
then swallowing a cyanide pill  &MD;  going along with him submissively
to consummate a suicide pact.
<p>
   And it was precisely this equality of a former actress and a
military president that infuriated those very military men who used
to relish  &MD;  and brag about  &MD;  keeping the company of actresses.
<p>
   And whereas Peron never felt comfortable in the midst of people,
Evita loved to be surrounded by crowds, and hear for hours on end
the plight of the humble ones. Moreover, if kissing the sores of
the lepers is commonly associated with sainthood, Evita certainly
had claims to the title of saint because on several occasions she
did exactly that.
<p>
   But she was remembered most not for her theatrical gestures, or
her scorching-earth personality or her jewels, clothes and hairdos,
but for the political accomplishments which, in her own time, made
her the butt of jokes as well as the most hatred woman in
Argentinean oligarchy.
<p>
   An unlikely feminist hero, she was during the Peronist era the
main promoter of the women's right to vote. An unlikely champion of
leftist causes, in her designer dresses, she fought nonetheless for
the rights and dignity of workers, children and old people. And
this was in a country where the ruling class did not even try to
hide its visible contempt for people who did not run a household
full of servants.
<p>
   And the imprint of Evita's personality marked Peron's life after
she died, in July, 1952, at the tragically young age of 33, from
uterine cancer, even as he looked vainly for emulators.
<p>
   First it was Josephine Baker, the famous nightclub singer, who
in November, 1952, went to Buenos Aires from Paris, as part of an
international tour. So impressed with Baker was the widowed Peron
that he created the World Cultural Association, with her as its
president. Its goal was to fight racial and religious
discrimination.
<p>
   But brief was to be her attention to those scourges of mankind
because some days later, Peron gave Baker a new task. He appointed
her an inspector in the Ministry of Health. Baker took that job to
heart, discovering so many irregularities that after countless
spats with Ramon Carrillo, the minister of health, she decided to
leave the country.
<p>
   Later Carrillo sent a letter to Peron complaining about Baker's
browbeatings, and what seemed to be her penchant for ``imitating in
her acts and social views the most reverend Senora Eva Peron.''
<p>
   After his overthrow, in 1955, Peron started his long exile,
first in Paraguay, then in Venezuela and, after that, in Panama,
where he met a chorus girl, Isabel Martinez. She would become
Evita's worst understudy  &MD;  and her most successful  &MD;  as Peron's
running mate, in 1973.
<p>
   Although ``Isabelita'' wore her hair combed straight back and
tied in a chignon  &MD;  as many women today are doing in imitation of
Madonna's Evita style  &MD;  and imitated some of Evita's mannerisms,
she lacked both the glamour that Madonna wisely infuses into her
role and the conviction to carry out her ideas.
<p>
   Besides, the two women were at opposite poles. Whereas Evita
tried always to exact revenge from the evil dogs who tried to
humiliate her, Isabelita wanted only the approval of her enemies.
<p>
   Indeed, Evita had understudies and emulators  &MD;  but she was a
hard act to follow.

lives in New York, is the author of ``At 8:25 Evita Became

Libertad Lamarque's name on it. The star reacted by making the
worst mistake of her life: She slapped Evita's face.
<p>
   In 1946, after Peron became president, Lamarque was forced into
exile in Mexico City and her films were banned in Argentina.
<p>
   (``There is no more freedom in Argentina after Libertad left the
country,'' complained the opposition, making a word play with
Lamarque's first name.)
<p>
   It is difficult to imagine what could have happened in
Argentina, though, if Lamarque had married Peron instead of Evita.
As difficult, perhaps, as trying to imagine what could have
happened if the prim actress Ann Archer had landed Evita's role in
the blockbuster movie instead of Golden Globe-winner Madonna.
<p>
   But knowing the personalities of Lamarque and Evita, it is safe
to assume that the former, who had a basically demure personality,
would not have become immortal in Argentinean politics. Evita,
however, was all fire.
<p>
   In spite of the age difference between Evita  &MD;  who was 24  &MD;  and
Peron  &MD;  who was 48 when they first met  &MD;  she was an equal partner
in the marriage.
<p>
   Nothing in common with the other Eva, the mistress of Hitler,
who followed the Fuehrer, in eating a piece of wedding cake and
then swallowing a cyanide pill  &MD;  going along with him submissively
to consummate a suicide pact.
<p>
   And it was precisely this equality of a former actress and a
military president that infuriated those very military men who used
to relish  &MD;  and brag about  &MD;  keeping the company of actresses.
<p>
   And whereas Peron never felt comfortable in the midst of people,
Evita loved to be surrounded by crowds, and hear for hours on end
the plight of the humble ones. Moreover, if kissing the sores of
the lepers is commonly associated with sainthood, Evita certainly
had claims to the title of saint because on several occasions she
did exactly that.
<p>
   But she was remembered most not for her theatrical gestures, or
her scorching-earth personality or her jewels, clothes and hairdos,
but for the political accomplishments which, in her own time, made
her the butt of jokes as well as the most hatred woman in
Argentinean oligarchy.
<p>
   An unlikely feminist hero, she was during the Peronist era the
main promoter of the women's right to vote. An unlikely champion of
leftist causes, in her designer dresses, she fought nonetheless for
the rights and dignity of workers, children and old people. And
this was in a country where the ruling class did not even try to
hide its visible contempt for people who did not run a household
full of servants.
<p>
   And the imprint of Evita's personality marked Peron's life after
she died, in July, 1952, at the tragically young age of 33, from
uterine cancer, even as he looked vainly for emulators.
<p>
   First it was Josephine Baker, the famous nightclub singer, who
in November, 1952, went to Buenos Aires from Paris, as part of an
international tour. So impressed with Baker was the widowed Peron
that he created the World Cultural Association, with her as its
president. Its goal was to fight racial and religious
discrimination.
<p>
   But brief was to be her attention to those scourges of mankind
because some days later, Peron gave Baker a new task. He appointed
her an inspector in the Ministry of Health. Baker took that job to
heart, discovering so many irregularities that after countless
spats with Ramon Carrillo, the minister of health, she decided to
leave the country.
<p>
   Later Carrillo sent a letter to Peron complaining about Baker's
browbeatings, and what seemed to be her penchant for ``imitating in
her acts and social views the most reverend Senora Eva Peron.''
<p>
   After his overthrow, in 1955, Peron started his long exile,
first in Paraguay, then in Venezuela and, after that, in Panama,
where he met a chorus girl, Isabel Martinez. She would become
Evita's worst understudy  &MD;  and her most successful  &MD;  as Peron's
running mate, in 1973.
<p>
   Although ``Isabelita'' wore her hair combed straight back and
tied in a chignon  &MD;  as many women today are doing in imitation of
Madonna's Evita style  &MD;  and imitated some of Evita's mannerisms,
she lacked both the glamour that Madonna wisely infuses into her
role and the conviction to carry out her ideas.
<p>
   Besides, the two women were at opposite poles. Whereas Evita
tried always to exact revenge from the evil dogs who tried to
humiliate her, Isabelita wanted only the approval of her enemies.
<p>
   Indeed, Evita had understudies and emulators  &MD;  but she was a
hard act to follow.

lives in New York, is the author of ``At 8:25 Evita Became
Immortal'' and three other books in a series on a Jewish family's
travails during the Peronist era.) &LR;

<p>
   Power in Russia is now adrift, unpredictable and corrupt.
<p>
   In the new Russia, freedom has led to disappointment.
<p>
   Since Boris Yeltsin's reelection as president, the bankers,
media barons and industrialists who had financed and in large
measure run the campaign got the rewards they wanted: positions in
the Kremlin, broadcasting and commercial licenses, and access to
the national resource pile.
<p>
   Before 1991, these oligarchs had been involved mainly in
fledgling small businesses  &MD;  some legitimate, some not  &MD;  and then,
under the chaotic conditions of the post-Soviet world, they made
their fortunes.
<p>
   Both within and outside the Kremlin, the oligarchs see
themselves as undeniably lucky, but worthy as well. They
righteously insist that their fortunes will spawn a middle class,
property rights and democratic values.
<p>
   No matter that the Kremlin lets them acquire an industrial giant
such as the Norilsk nickel works for a thief's price. They claim to
be building a new Russia, and rationalize the rest.
<p>
   Mikhail Smolensky, who runs Moscow's powerful Stolichnii Bank
from his offices in the restored mansion of a 19th-century
merchant, told me: ``Look, unfortunately, the only lawyer in this
country is the Kalashnikov. People mostly solve their problems in
this way. In this country there is no respect for the law, no
culture of law, no judicial system  &MD;  it's just being created.''
<p>
   In the meantime, bribery greases the wheels of commerce.
Government officials, who issue licenses and permissions of all
sorts, ``practically have a price list hanging on the office
wall,'' Smolensky said.
<p>
   The new oligarchs are humiliating to Russians, not because they
are wealthy but because so little of their wealth finds its way
back into the Russian economy.
<p>
   According to Interpol and the Russian Interior Ministry, rich
Russians have sent more than $300 billion to foreign banks, and
much of that capital leaves the country illegally and untaxed.
<p>
   Yeltsin's Kremlin capitalism has so far failed to create a
nation of shopkeepers  &MD;  the British middle-class model. It has,
however, spawned hundreds of thousands of ``chelnoki,'' or shuttle
traders, young people who travel to and from countries such as
China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates carrying all manner of
goods for sale.
<p>
   This sort of trade is probably only a crude, transitional form
of capitalism, but it is also uncontrolled, untaxed and
mafia-ridden.
<p>
   By now power at the Kremlin has become almost as remote from the
people it is supposed to serve as it was under the last communist
general secretaries. In its arrogance, in its refusals to answer
questions from the press, today's Kremlin seems to believe that its
duty to observe democratic practices ended with the elections.
<p>
   The Russian people, understandably, believe the government has
much to answer for. The poverty rate is soaring. Life expectancy
for men is plunging. The murder rate is twice as high as it is in
the United States and many times higher than in European capitals
to the West.
<p>
   According to Russian government statistics, by late 1995, 8,000
criminal gangs were operating in the country  &MD;  proportionately as
many as in Italy. The fastest-growing service industry in Russia is
personal security. Hundreds of thousands of men and women now work
for private businesses as armed security guards. The police are too
few, and usually too corrupt, to do the job.
<p>
   Though far better than in Soviet times, the press is still not
free. State television, which is largely owned by the new
oligarchs, is extremely cautious, even sycophantic, when it comes
to reporting on those in power.
<p>
   Some newspapers and magazines have become aggressive and
critical, even probing impolitely into the state of Yeltsin's
health. It was an investigation by Itogi, a Moscow magazine, that
forced Yeltsin to go public with his heart ailments, which in turn
led him to agree to quintuple-bypass surgery.
<p>
   But there is still no institution  &MD;  not the press, not
parliament, certainly not the weak judiciary  &MD;  with the authority
to keep the Kremlin honest.
<p>
   One of the most troubling deficiencies in modern Russia is the
absence of moral authority. The country lacks the kind of ethical
compass it lost when Andrei Sakharov died in 1989.
<p>
   Human-rights groups such as Memorial, in the forefront of the
democratic reform movement under Mikhail Gorbachev, are now
marginal.
<p>
   Russia should not be mistaken for a democratic state. Rather, it
is a nascent state with some features of democracy and, alas, many
features of oligarchy and authoritarianism.
<p>
   When and how will a more complete transformation of its
political culture occur? Is Russia capable of building a stable
democratic state? Is it forever doomed to follow a historical
pattern in which long stretches of absolutism are briefly
interrupted by fleeting periods of reform?
<p>
   As former Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar has said, ``Russia
today is not a bad subject for long-term prognostication, and a
very inappropriate subject for short-term analysis.''
<p>
   There seems no reason why Russia cannot break with its
absolutist past in much the way that Germany and Japan did after
World War II.
<p>
   Certainly since the late 1980s, Russia has come a long way in
this direction. The decades of confrontation with the West are
over. Russia has withdrawn its talons and, except for the need to
vent some nationalist rhetoric once in a great while, it offers
little threat to the world.
<p>
   For all the handwringing by Henry Kissinger and other
Russophobes, there is no imminent threat of renewed imperialism,
even within the borders of the old Soviet Union. After centuries of
isolation, Russia seems ready to live not merely with the world but
in it.
<p>
   The peril it poses is less a deliberate military threat than
chaos and random events such as the theft of ``loose nukes.''
<p>
   Russians are free to travel. They are free to consume as much
foreign journalism, intellectual history and popular culture as
they desire. The authorities encourage foreign influence and
business. More than 200,000 foreign citizens reside in Moscow, many
times the number before 1990.
<p>
   Communication with the outside world is limited only by Russia's
dismal international telephone system, and scholars and
businesspeople have finessed that limitation with personal
computers and e-mail, which are rapidly becoming more widely
available.
<p>
   ``I lived through the last days of Brezhnev, Andropov and
Chernenko, and I know how illness in power leads to danger,''
Gorbachev told me shortly after the recent elections. ``We survived
back then thanks only to the inertia of the Soviet system. But
Russia needs dynamic people in office and now, well . . .''
<p>
   Gorbachev has never been charitable to Yeltsin (nor Yeltsin,
Gorbachev), but he was right.
<p>
   If Yeltsin dies sooner rather than later, his circle will either
follow the letter of the constitution and hold presidential
elections after three months, or it will find an excuse to avoid
them.
<p>
   The latter choice would go a long way toward negating the
limited progress made since 1991. Russia has yet to prove it can
undergo a peaceful and orderly transfer of power  &MD;  one of the most
crucial tests in the development of a democracy.

   With its startling pace and unexpected breadth, the democratic
trend of the 1980s and early 1990s seemed to sweep away decades of
predictions on how democracy develops.

   Democratic transitions popped up in the most unlikely places,
apparently depending on remarkably little  &MD;  not the political
history or culture of a country, literacy levels, the existence of
a middle class or the level or distribution of wealth.
<p>
   So long as the elites in a country embraced the democratic ideal
 &MD;  and they all seemed to be doing it  &MD;  democracy would spring into
life.
<p>
   In the space of a few years, democracy appeared to go from the
political equivalent of an arcane religious faith, attainable only
after laborious study, to a pop religion spread through
televangelism and mass baptisms.
<p>
   But by now, what enthusiasts at the start of the decade were
calling ``the worldwide democratic revolution'' has cooled.
<p>
   The headlines announcing that country after country was
shrugging off dictatorial rule and embarking on a democratic path
have given way to an intermittent but rising stream of troubling
reports: a coup in Gambia, civil strife in the Central African
Republic, flawed elections in Albania, a deposed government in
Pakistan, returning authoritarianism in Zambia, the shedding of
democratic forms in Kazakstan, sabotaged elections in Armenia,
eroding human rights in Cambodia.
<p>
   There is still sometimes good news on the democracy front, but
the backslide prompts inquiry into where it is taking countries in
which it is occurring, and what it says about when and why
democracy succeeds.
<p>
   As democratization advanced around the globe in the 1980s and
early 1990s, successive U.S. administrations increasingly
emphasized support for democracy as a foreign-policy goal. The
tendency reached its zenith  &MD;  rhetorically, at least  &MD;  when the
Clinton administration proclaimed the promotion of democracy ``the
successor to a doctrine of containment.''
<p>
   So does the new retrenchment signal a failure of U.S. policy on
democracy promotion and what might it mean for American foreign
policy in the years ahead?
<p>
   Democratic stagnation and retrenchment have been most pronounced
in the former Soviet Union, Africa and the Middle East. Several
former Soviet republics have made genuine democratic progress since
the USSR's dissolution in 1991, but in the rest, pluralism was
stillborn or is losing ground.
<p>
   The 1996 Russian presidential elections were a milestone, yet
political life in Russia is still only very partially democratic,
and not especially stable. The dominant ideology is a form of state
nationalism in which elements of pluralism mix uneasily with
authoritarian structures and impulses carried over from the
communist era.
<p>
   In the former Soviet Union, Belarus has quietly sunk into
dictatorship. The Central Asian states are a dispiriting collection
of politically retrograde entities. Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and
Tajikistan are under absolutist rule, with Tajikistan still wracked
by civil strife.
<p>
   Even President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan, the darling of
Western donors for his initial reforming path, is showing incipient
authoritarian tendencies.
<p>
   Hopes for democracy in the Transcaucasus have faded, with both
Armenia and Azerbaijan holding seriously flawed elections in the
past two years. Pluralism is surviving in Georgia, but political
stability seems to depend almost exclusively on one man, Eduard
Shevardnadze.
<p>
   In sub-Saharan Africa, democratization is still advancing, or at
least has not been reversed, in some nations, including not only
South Africa but Mali, Malawi, Namibia and Benin. At the same time,
many of the more than 30 countries that experienced political
openings early in the decade have gone seriously off course.
<p>
   Some have descended into civil conflict and, in Rwanda and
Burundi, the violence has been horrifying.
<p>
   Coups have halted liberalization in Nigeria, Gambia and Niger.
Elsewhere, in Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso and Togo,
entrenched strongmen have manipulated or coopted supposedly
transitional elections so as to reconsolidate their power.
<p>
   Fraud, severe administrative disorder, or a lack of permitted
opposition parties have marred many elections, as in Cote d'Ivoire,
Tanzania and Kenya.
<p>
   On the whole, sub-Saharan Africa is more pluralistic today than
it was 10 years ago, and democracy may well take root in a number
of African countries. But the hopes for a continent-wide shift to
democracy have not been fulfilled.
<p>
   The Middle East, the world's least democratic region, felt a
liberalizing breeze in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Various
governments undertook cautious, gradual political openings in
response both to popular discontent over worsening economic woes
and democratic change worldwide.
<p>
   But several other states have suffered serious setbacks or
stagnation. The transition to democracy in Algeria, once held out
as a model for Arab countries, was abruptly derailed in 1992 by a
military takeover after Islamist victories in national elections,
and has since degenerated into a vicious civil war.
<p>
   Yemen's surprising experiment with democratization in the early
1990s, undertaken as part of the unification of the previously
separate states of North and South Yemen, collapsed in 1994 when
the south tried to secede and civil war flared.
<p>
   In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak has resisted rising internal
pressure for political reform and left many wondering if he can
navigate the country through increasingly polarized waters. Around
the region, conservative elites fearful of Islamic fundamentalists
have largely choked off liberalization.
<p>
   In Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, the democratic trend
has fared better but the picture is still very mixed. Democracy has
advanced considerably in Central and Eastern Europe.
<p>
   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, in particular, have
taken huge strides. Romania has also made progress, although its
slower and more uneven change reflects its relatively more
oppressive rule before 1989. Bulgaria, Albania and Slovakia enjoy
some openness and pluralism, but their political paths are
tortuous.
<p>
   ``Retrenchment'' is an inadequate word for the political and
human horrors that have ravaged the former Yugoslavia since 1991.
<p>
   Dictatorial regimes in Serbia and Croatia dominate the area, and
the prospects for peaceful pluralism in Bosnia remain extremely
shaky in spite of internationally supervised national elections in
September.
<p>
   To the surprise of many observers, Latin America has experienced
few outright reversals among the more than a dozen transitions to
elected, civilian government that occurred in the 1980s. Haiti
suffered a coup in 1991, but U.S. military intervention overturned
the regime in 1994 and reinstalled the elected president,
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
<p>
   Peru experienced a setback in 1992 with President Alberto
Fujimori's temporary suspension of democratic rule in an autogolpe,
and the country remains in a gray area between dictatorship and
democracy. Guatemala, Venezuela and Paraguay have all had close
brushes in recent years with military coups, but elected
governments are still in place.
<p>
   The question for Latin America is not whether democracy can be
maintained in form but whether it can be achieved in substance. In
a few countries, primarily ones with some democratic tradition  &MD; 
such as Costa Rica, Chile and Uruguay  &MD;  it is possible to speak of
the consolidation of democracy.
<p>
   But in most of the region, severe deficiencies mark political
life  &MD;  weak capacity and performance of government institutions,
widespread corruption, irregular and often arbitrary rule of law,
poorly developed patterns of representation and participation and
large numbers of marginalized citizens.
<p>
   Casting its shadow over democracy's prospects throughout Asia is
China, the first Asian case of backtracking from the liberalization
of the late 1980s.
<p>
   Political life in Cambodia has deteriorated sharply since the
U.N.-sponsored 1993 elections, with widespread human-rights abuses
and large-scale government corruption. Political tensions are high
in Pakistan following the ouster of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
amid charges of corruption and abuse of power.
<p>
   On the other hand, Taiwan and South Korea remain examples of
relatively successful democratic transitions following from
successful economic transformations.
<p>
   And democratization in the Philippines, Thailand and Mongolia is
holding steady or even advancing on some counts, in spite of
serious corruption in the former two countries and the burdensome
legacy of Soviet rule in the latter.
<p>
   If anything, all the retrenchment has exposed the chimera of
instantaneous democracy, revealing the difficulties and the major
chance of failure in even the best-intentioned aims toward freedom.

   With its startling pace and unexpected breadth, the democratic
trend of the 1980s and early 1990s seemed to sweep away decades of
predictions on how democracy develops.
<p>
   Democratic transitions popped up in the most unlikely places,

<p>
   In the fall of 1997 the judges of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will complete their four-year
terms.
<p>
   If top and mid-level leaders indicted by the tribunal have not
been arrested and delivered to The Hague by then, Antonio Cassese,
the tribunal's president, has threatened to propose that the
Security Council terminate the tribunal's mandate.
<p>
   Cassese's warning echoes similar calls for top-level arrests
from former chief prosecutor Richard Goldstone, justice of the
South African Constitutional Court, and Louise Arbour, his
successor from the Ontario Court of Appeals.
<p>
   Their frustration underscores the need for a careful evaluation
of the tribunal's record and prospects.
<p>
   The U.N. Security Council established the tribunal on May 25,
1993, in response to the deliberate, systematic and outrageous
violations of human rights and humanitarian norms during the
Balkans war.
<p>
   Atrocities committed include summary executions, torture, rape,
arbitrary mass internment, deportation and displacement,
hostage-taking, inhuman treatment of prisoners, indiscriminate
shelling of cities and unwarranted destruction of private property.
<p>
   Of the 74 persons indicted for such atrocities, one has pleaded
guilty and been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, five are
currently in custody awaiting trial and one  &MD;  Dusan Tadic, a
Bosnian Serb accused of committing abuses against Muslims in the
Omarska concentration camp in Bosnia  &MD;  is on trial.
<p>
   None of the seven, however, are top political or military
leaders who gave the key orders. The absence of such leaders among
those in custody has led Cassese to assert that the General
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina reached at
Dayton in November 1995 ``is becoming an exercise in hypocrisy.''
<p>
   Initially the tribunal's founders hoped the trials would defuse
ethnic tensions and assist in peacemaking.
<p>
   They also hoped that enforcing accountability would deter
violations of global humanitarian law in Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
And because the Hague tribunal was established while the war was
still raging  &MD;  in contrast to the Nuremberg war-crimes trials,
which began only after World War II had been fought and won  &MD;  there
was even a chance it might stop the war sooner.
<p>
   Conversely, failure to establish the tribunal would have made it
appear that even the most egregious crimes against humanity could
go unpunished.
<p>
   In the former Yugoslavia, the prospects for reunification and
reconciliation were poor from the beginning  &MD;  given the tremendous
scale of atrocities, the hatred and suspicion between ethnic groups
and the irresponsible leaders thriving on extreme nationalism and
violence.
<p>
   From its inception, the tribunal has been plagued by the lack of
cooperation from Serbian leaders in Belgrade, Bosnian-Serb leaders
in Pale and Croatian leaders in Zagreb.
<p>
   In contrast to Nuremberg, where the Allies had unlimited police
power on the ground, the tribunal has had to depend on the
readiness of the Security Council and the international community
to exert pressure for full compliance on reluctant parties.
<p>
   But it has rarely worked. Suspects have been sheltered and
protected. Access to sites where atrocities were committed has been
obstructed, hindering the collection of perishable evidence.
Witnesses, even victims, have withheld their testimony.
<p>
   That no witness for the prosecution in the Dusan Tadic case
still lives in an area under the control of Pale or Belgrade speaks
to the ever-present fear of reprisal among those who might testify.
<p>
   At the governmental level, Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority
entity in Bosnia, has failed to execute any of the scores of arrest
warrants it has been sent. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
not arrested any of the indictees on its territory. Croatia has
detained one, but has so far failed to deliver him up to The Hague.
<p>
   Zagreb's limited cooperation with the tribunal, to which it
committed in the Dayton agreements, has been a small price to pay
for Croatia's growing international legitimacy. Indeed, it was
recently admitted to the Council of Europe, often seen as a way
station en route to the European Union.
<p>
   The international community has given the tribunal strong
rhetorical support, but little aid in enforcement.
<p>
   In addition, the tribunal has faced budgetary difficulties. Were
it not for favorable public opinion, government and U.N. backing
for both the tribunal and its budget would be even weaker.
<p>
   Cassese and Goldstone opted to devote much of their time to
mobilizing public opinion behind the tribunal and its mission.
Goldstone's successor, chief prosecutor Arbour, will probably find
it necessary to do the same.
<p>
   The fact that the tribunal's list of indictees was for a long
time composed solely of Serbs exacerbated the Serbs' siege
mentality and fueled their complaint that they were the only
target.
<p>
   If IFOR could not carry out arrests with the tremendous
firepower of its 60,000 troops in Bosnia, surely no arrests will be
attempted as the NATO force dwindles and ultimately withdraws.
<p>
   The great hope of tribunal advocates was that the
individualization and decollectivization of guilt  &MD;  placing
responsibility on the leaders and the perpetrators of atrocities,
rather than on whole communities  &MD;  would help bring about peace and
reconciliation.
<p>
   The tribunal's critics argued that it would obstruct peace
negotiations. How, they protested, could those who make decisions
at the negotiating table be expected to agree to provisions that
might endanger their leadership and bring them to justice?
<p>
   The irony is that both sides were proved wrong.
<p>
   Because of the international community's reluctance or inability
to enforce indictments, the tribunal has had no major impact,
positive or negative, on national reconciliation.
<p>
   Perhaps the realization that the tribunal's days may be numbered
unless indicted leaders and perpetrators are arrested and delivered
up to The Hague may yet shock the international community into
action.
<p>
   Folding the tribunal before it has tried a substantial number of
major culprits would be immensely embarrassing to both the global
community and to the United States, which has given the tribunal
more political, budgetary and logistical support than any other
nation.
<p>
   Recently, nations worldwide have been more ready to prosecute
human rights and humanitarian atrocities, including Korea, where
even ex-presidents have been convicted, Ethiopia and Honduras.
<p>
   In South Africa, prosecutions are under way against persons who
did not cooperate fully with its Truth Commission by coming
forward, reporting on injustices during apartheid and seeking
amnesty.
<p>
   It is not absurd to suggest that in a few years Belgrade, Zagreb
or even Pale might have more responsible leaders and more credible
criminal-justice systems, and might be ready to prosecute before
their courts some of those indicted by the tribunal.
<p>
   But from now on, international criminal tribunals must be more
effectively supported by police power. Just as there can be no
national justice without a police force, there can be no effective
international justice without arrests, subpoenas, investigations
and a reliable enforcement method.

<p>
   In the fall of 1997 the judges of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will complete their four-year
terms.
<p>
   If top and mid-level leaders indicted by the tribunal have not
been arrested and delivered to The Hague by then, Antonio Cassese,
the tribunal's president, has threatened to propose that the
Security Council terminate the tribunal's mandate.
<p>
   Cassese's warning echoes similar calls for top-level arrests
from former chief prosecutor Richard Goldstone, justice of the
South African Constitutional Court, and Louise Arbour, his
successor from the Ontario Court of Appeals.
<p>
   Their frustration underscores the need for a careful evaluation
of the tribunal's record and prospects.
<p>
   The U.N. Security Council established the tribunal on May 25,
1993, in response to the deliberate, systematic and outrageous
violations of human rights and humanitarian norms during the
Balkans war.
<p>
   Atrocities committed include summary executions, torture, rape,
arbitrary mass internment, deportation and displacement,
hostage-taking, inhuman treatment of prisoners, indiscriminate
shelling of cities and unwarranted destruction of private property.
<p>
   Of the 74 persons indicted for such atrocities, one has pleaded
guilty and been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, five are
currently in custody awaiting trial and one  &MD;  Dusan Tadic, a
Bosnian Serb accused of committing abuses against Muslims in the
Omarska concentration camp in Bosnia  &MD;  is on trial.
<p>
   None of the seven, however, are top political or military
leaders who gave the key orders. The absence of such leaders among
those in custody has led Cassese to assert that the General
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina reached at
Dayton in November 1995 ``is becoming an exercise in hypocrisy.''
<p>
   Initially the tribunal's founders hoped the trials would defuse
ethnic tensions and assist in peacemaking.
<p>
   They also hoped that enforcing accountability would deter
violations of global humanitarian law in Yugoslavia and elsewhere.
And because the Hague tribunal was established while the war was
still raging  &MD;  in contrast to the Nuremberg war-crimes trials,
which began only after World War II had been fought and won  &MD;  there
was even a chance it might stop the war sooner.
<p>
   Conversely, failure to establish the tribunal would have made it
appear that even the most egregious crimes against humanity could
go unpunished.
<p>
   In the former Yugoslavia, the prospects for reunification and
reconciliation were poor from the beginning  &MD;  given the tremendous
scale of atrocities, the hatred and suspicion between ethnic groups
and the irresponsible leaders thriving on extreme nationalism and
violence.
<p>
   From its inception, the tribunal has been plagued by the lack of
cooperation from Serbian leaders in Belgrade, Bosnian-Serb leaders
in Pale and Croatian leaders in Zagreb.
<p>
   In contrast to Nuremberg, where the Allies had unlimited police
power on the ground, the tribunal has had to depend on the
readiness of the Security Council and the international community
to exert pressure for full compliance on reluctant parties.
<p>
   But it has rarely worked. Suspects have been sheltered and
protected. Access to sites where atrocities were committed has been
obstructed, hindering the collection of perishable evidence.
Witnesses, even victims, have withheld their testimony.
<p>
   That no witness for the prosecution in the Dusan Tadic case
still lives in an area under the control of Pale or Belgrade speaks
to the ever-present fear of reprisal among those who might testify.
<p>
   At the governmental level, Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority
entity in Bosnia, has failed to execute any of the scores of arrest
warrants it has been sent. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
not arrested any of the indictees on its territory. Croatia has
detained one, but has so far failed to deliver him up to The Hague.
<p>
   Zagreb's limited cooperation with the tribunal, to which it
committed in the Dayton agreements, has been a small price to pay
for Croatia's growing international legitimacy. Indeed, it was
recently admitted to the Council of Europe, often seen as a way
station en route to the European Union.
<p>
   The international community has given the tribunal strong
rhetorical support, but little aid in enforcement.
<p>
   In addition, the tribunal has faced budgetary difficulties. Were
it not for favorable public opinion, government and U.N. backing
for both the tribunal and its budget would be even weaker.
<p>
   Cassese and Goldstone opted to devote much of their time to
mobilizing public opinion behind the tribunal and its mission.
Goldstone's successor, chief prosecutor Arbour, will probably find
it necessary to do the same.
<p>
   The fact that the tribunal's list of indictees was for a long
time composed solely of Serbs exacerbated the Serbs' siege
mentality and fueled their complaint that they were the only
target.
<p>
   If IFOR could not carry out arrests with the tremendous
firepower of its 60,000 troops in Bosnia, surely no arrests will be
attempted as the NATO force dwindles and ultimately withdraws.
<p>
   The great hope of tribunal advocates was that the
individualization and decollectivization of guilt  &MD;  placing
responsibility on the leaders and the perpetrators of atrocities,
rather than on whole communities  &MD;  would help bring about peace and
reconciliation.
<p>
   The tribunal's critics argued that it would obstruct peace
negotiations. How, they protested, could those who make decisions
at the negotiating table be expected to agree to provisions that
might endanger their leadership and bring them to justice?
<p>
   The irony is that both sides were proved wrong.
<p>
   Because of the international community's reluctance or inability
to enforce indictments, the tribunal has had no major impact,
positive or negative, on national reconciliation.
<p>
   Perhaps the realization that the tribunal's days may be numbered
unless indicted leaders and perpetrators are arrested and delivered
up to The Hague may yet shock the international community into
action.
<p>
   Folding the tribunal before it has tried a substantial number of
major culprits would be immensely embarrassing to both the global
community and to the United States, which has given the tribunal
more political, budgetary and logistical support than any other
nation.
<p>
   Recently, nations worldwide have been more ready to prosecute
human rights and humanitarian atrocities, including Korea, where
even ex-presidents have been convicted, Ethiopia and Honduras.
<p>
   In South Africa, prosecutions are under way against persons who
did not cooperate fully with its Truth Commission by coming
forward, reporting on injustices during apartheid and seeking
amnesty.
<p>
   It is not absurd to suggest that in a few years Belgrade, Zagreb
or even Pale might have more responsible leaders and more credible
criminal-justice systems, and might be ready to prosecute before
their courts some of those indicted by the tribunal.
<p>
   But from now on, international criminal tribunals must be more
effectively supported by police power. Just as there can be no
national justice without a police force, there can be no effective
international justice without arrests, subpoenas, investigations
and a reliable enforcement method.
<p>
   The international community's inability to create such a
mechanism threatens all efforts to create a system of international
criminal justice.
<p>
   But we must not give up in despair.

<p>
   The multinational corporations of the 1960s were all American,
and prided themselves on their insularity.
<p>
   Foreigners might run subsidiaries, but they were never partners.
A foreign posting was a setback for a rising executive.
<p>
   Today a global marketplace is developing for retail sales as
well as manufacturing. Law, advertising, business consulting and
financial and other services are also marketed internationally.
<p>
   Firms of all nationalities attempt to look and act like locals
wherever they operate. Foreign language skills and lengthy
experience abroad are an asset, and increasingly a requirement, for
top management. Sometimes corporate headquarters are not even in a
company's home country.
<p>
   Amid shifting alliances and joint ventures, made possible by
computers and advanced communications, nationalities blur. Offshore
banking encourages widespread evasion of national taxes.
<p>
   Whereas the fear in the 1970s was that multinationals would
become an arm of government, the concern now is that they are
disconnecting from their home countries' national interests, moving
jobs, evading taxes and eroding economic sovereignty in the
process.
<p>
   All in all, the global financial market will grow to a
staggering $83 trillion by 2000, a 1994 McKinsey &AMP; Co. study
estimated, triple the aggregate gross domestic product of the
nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
<p>
   Again, technology has been a driving force, shifting financial
clout from states to the market with its offer of unprecedented
speed in transactions  &MD;  states cannot match market reaction times
measured in seconds  &MD;  and its dissemination of financial
information to a broad range of players.
<p>
   States could choose whether they would belong to rule-based
economic systems such as the gold standard but, as Walter Wriston,
the former Citicorp chairman, has pointed out, they cannot withdraw
from the technology-based marketplace, unless they seek poverty.
<p>
   More and more frequently today, governments have only the
appearance of free choice when they set economic rules. Markets are
setting de facto rules enforced by their own power. States can
flout them, but the penalties are severe  &MD;  loss of vital foreign
capital, foreign technology and domestic jobs.
<p>
   Even the most powerful economy must pay heed. The U.S.
government could choose to rescue the Mexican peso in 1994, for
example, but it had to do so on terms designed to satisfy the bond
markets, not the countries doing the rescuing.
<p>
   The forces shaping the legitimate global economy are also
nourishing globally integrated crime  &MD;  which U.N. officials peg at
a staggering $750 billion a year, $400 billion to $500 billion of
that in narcotics, according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
estimates.
<p>
   Huge increases in the volume of goods and people crossing
borders  &MD;  and competitive pressures to speed the flow of trade by
easing inspections and reducing paperwork  &MD;  make it easier to hide
contraband. Deregulation and privatization of government-owned
businesses, modern communications, rapidly shifting commercial
alliances and the emergence of global financial systems have all
helped transform local drug operations into global enterprises.
<p>
   The most powerful engine of change in the relative decline of
states and the rise of nonstate actors is the computer and
telecommunications revolution, whose deep political and social
consequences have been almost completely ignored.
<p>
   Widely accessible and affordable technology has broken
governments' monopoly on the collection and management of large
amounts of information and deprived governments of the deference
they enjoyed because of it.
<p>
   In every sphere of activity, instantaneous access to information
and the ability to put it to use multiplies the number of players
who matter and reduces the number who command great authority. The
effect on the loudest voice  &MD;  which has been government's  &MD;  has
been the greatest.
<p>
   By drastically reducing the importance of proximity, the new
technologies change people's perceptions of community. Fax
machines, satellite hookups and the Internet connect people across
borders with growing ease while separating them from natural and
historical links within nations.
<p>
   In this sense a powerful globalizing force, they can also have
the opposite effect, amplifying political and social fragmentation
by enabling more and more identities and interests scattered around
the globe to coalesce and thrive.
<p>
   These technologies have the potential to divide society along
new lines, separating ordinary people from elites with the wealth
and education to command technology's power.
<p>
   Those elites are not only the rich but also citizens' groups
with transnational interests and identities that frequently have
more in common with counterparts in other countries, whether
industrialized or developing, than with countrymen.
<p>
   Above all, the information technologies disrupt hierarchies,
spreading power among more people and groups. In drastically
lowering the costs of communication, consultation and coordination,
they favor decentralized networks over other modes of organization.
<p>
   In a network, individuals or groups link for joint action
without building a physical or formal institutional presence.
Networks have no person at the top and no center. Instead, they
have multiple nodes where collections of individuals or groups
interact for different purposes. Businesses, citizens
organizations, ethnic groups and crime cartels have all readily
adopted the network model.
<p>
   Thanks to the nonprofit Association for Progressive
Communications, some 50,000 citizens' groups, known as NGOs, in 133
countries have access to tens of millions of Internet users for the
price of a local call,
<p>
   The dramatically lower costs of international communication have
changed international outcomes.
<p>
   Within hours of the first gunshots of the Chiapas rebellion in
southern Mexico in January 1994, for example, the Internet swarmed
with messages from human-rights activists. The worldwide media
attention they and their groups focused on Chiapas, along with the
influx of rights activists to the area, sharply limited the Mexican
government's response.
<p>
   What in other times would have been a bloody insurgency turned
out to be a largely nonviolent conflict.
<p>
   ``The shots lasted ten days,'' one foreign minister later
remarked, ``and ever since, the war has been ... a war on the
Internet.''
<p>
   Women's and human-rights groups in many developing countries
have linked up with more experienced, better funded and more
powerful groups in Europe and the United States.
<p>
   The latter work the global media and lobby their own governments
to pressure leaders in developing countries, creating a circle of
influence that is accelerating change in many parts of the world.
<p>
   In many countries they are delivering the services  &MD;  in urban
and rural community development, education and health care  &MD;  that
faltering governments can no longer manage.
<p>
   The range of these groups' work is almost as broad as their
interests. They breed new ideas; advocate, protest and mobilize
public support; do legal, scientific, technical and policy
analysis; provide services; shape, implement, monitor and enforce
national and international commitments; and change institutions and
norms.
<p>
   Increasingly, NGOs are able to push around even the largest
governments. When the United States and Mexico set out to reach a
trade agreement, the two governments planned on the usual narrowly
defined negotiations behind closed doors.
<p>
   But NGOs had a very different vision. Groups from Canada, the
United States and Mexico wanted to see provisions in the North
American Free Trade Agreement on health and safety, transboundary
pollution, consumer protection, immigration, labor mobility, child
labor, sustainable agriculture, social charters and debt relief.
<p>
   Coalitions of these citizens' groups formed in each country and
across both borders. The opposition they generated in early 1991
endangered congressional approval of the crucial ``fast track''
negotiating authority for the U.S. government.
<p>
   After months of resistance, the Bush administration capitulated,
opening the agreement to environmental and labor concerns.
<p>
   Although progress in other trade venues will be slow, the
tightly closed world of trade negotiations has been changed
forever.
<p>
   The evolution of information and communications technology,
which has only just begun, greatly empowers individuals and weakens
the relative attachment to community, of which the preeminent one
in modern society is the nation-state.
<p>
   If current trends continue, the international system 50 years
hence will be profoundly different.

industrialized or developing, than with countrymen.
<p>
   Above all, the information technologies disrupt hierarchies,
spreading power among more people and groups. In drastically
lowering the costs of communication, consultation and coordination,
they favor decentralized networks over other modes of organization.
<p>
   In a network, individuals or groups link for joint action
without building a physical or formal institutional presence.
Networks have no person at the top and no center. Instead, they
have multiple nodes where collections of individuals or groups
interact for different purposes. Businesses, citizens
organizations, ethnic groups and crime cartels have all readily
adopted the network model.
<p>
   Thanks to the nonprofit Association for Progressive
Communications, some 50,000 citizens' groups, known as NGOs, in 133
countries have access to tens of millions of Internet users for the
price of a local call,
<p>
   The dramatically lower costs of international communication have
changed international outcomes.
<p>
   Within hours of the first gunshots of the Chiapas rebellion in
southern Mexico in January 1994, for example, the Internet swarmed
with messages from human-rights activists. The worldwide media
attention they and their groups focused on Chiapas, along with the
influx of rights activists to the area, sharply limited the Mexican
government's response.
<p>
   What in other times would have been a bloody insurgency turned
out to be a largely nonviolent conflict.
<p>
   ``The shots lasted ten days,'' one foreign minister later
remarked, ``and ever since, the war has been ... a war on the
Internet.''
<p>
   Women's and human-rights groups in many developing countries
have linked up with more experienced, better funded and more
powerful groups in Europe and the United States.
<p>
   The latter work the global media and lobby their own governments
to pressure leaders in developing countries, creating a circle of
influence that is accelerating change in many parts of the world.
<p>
   In many countries they are delivering the services  &MD;  in urban
and rural community development, education and health care  &MD;  that
faltering governments can no longer manage.
<p>
   The range of these groups' work is almost as broad as their
interests. They breed new ideas; advocate, protest and mobilize
public support; do legal, scientific, technical and policy
analysis; provide services; shape, implement, monitor and enforce
national and international commitments; and change institutions and
norms.
<p>
   Increasingly, NGOs are able to push around even the largest
governments. When the United States and Mexico set out to reach a
trade agreement, the two governments planned on the usual narrowly
defined negotiations behind closed doors.
<p>
   But NGOs had a very different vision. Groups from Canada, the
United States and Mexico wanted to see provisions in the North
American Free Trade Agreement on health and safety, transboundary
pollution, consumer protection, immigration, labor mobility, child
labor, sustainable agriculture, social charters and debt relief.
<p>
   Coalitions of these citizens' groups formed in each country and
across both borders. The opposition they generated in early 1991
endangered congressional approval of the crucial ``fast track''
negotiating authority for the U.S. government.
<p>
   After months of resistance, the Bush administration capitulated,
opening the agreement to environmental and labor concerns.
<p>
   Although progress in other trade venues will be slow, the
tightly closed world of trade negotiations has been changed
forever.
<p>
   The evolution of information and communications technology,
which has only just begun, greatly empowers individuals and weakens
the relative attachment to community, of which the preeminent one
in modern society is the nation-state.
<p>
   If current trends continue, the international system 50 years
hence will be profoundly different.

<p>
   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad  &MD;  On this West Indian island of
blood-red bougainvillea and towering palm trees, a floundering
economy has brought a rise in homelessness and vagrancy.
<p>
   As a transit point for South American cocaine destined for the
U.S. mainland  &MD;  about 1,000 kilos pass through here each month  &MD;  it
has seen an increase in drug use as well.
<p>
   But when asked about his country's most pressing problems, Prime
Minister Basdeo Panday unexpectedly reveals a flaming commitment to
racial harmony, not reducing crime or inflation rates.
<p>
   ``Because of suspicions and underlying antagonisms, we have
never been able to do all we are capable of doing,'' said Panday
who, in November 1995, was sworn in as Trinidad's first prime
minister of East Indian descent. ``Since coming to office, I've
tried to assure people that all will be treated fairly and they
will.''
<p>
   Panday's response underscores the importance of an issue that's
shaped debates here for decades.
<p>
   Race is is deliberated in taxi cabs, at fruit stands, on talk
shows, even as Trinidad struggles to recover from a severe 15-year
recession brought on by the global oil price collapse that pummeled
its oil and natural gas industry. It's discussed even as it tries
to stem a wave of violent crimes, 70 percent of which are drug
related.
<p>
   It's not hard to see why.
<p>
   This most southern of all Caribbean islands seems to draw its
population from every conceivable social and ethnic group. It is a
place where it's just as easy to buy pig's feet as it is to eat
chung pow pork.
<p>
   More than 80 percent of the country's 1.5 million people can
trace their ancestry to Africa or India, and today the two groups
are of equal size. The rest of the people are mixed race, Chinese
and Syrian.
<p>
   ``Race is the only issue when it comes to Trinidad,'' said Ken
Boodhoo, a Trinidadian professor of international relations at
Florida International University in Miami. ``It's an issue that's
been around for 200 years.''
<p>
   And it's an issue that's only picked up steam with the election
of Panday, the grandson of indentured Hindu laborers brought to
work on British-owned sugar plantations in Trinidad in 1908.
<p>
   Panday, the leader of the United National Congress party, was
elected by the slimmest of margins. He holds a two-seat majority in
parliament.
<p>
   But the results represented a dramatic shift of power in
Trinidad and its sister island, Tobago, where blacks had been in
charge since independence from Britain in 1962. The shift followed
a long history of racial friction, including ``black power''
protests in the 1970s that twice led to the declaration of a state
of emergency.
<p>
   Panday, 64, campaigned on a platform of ``national unity'' and
has spent his first year in office trying to reassure blacks that
he won't hurt their interests.
<p>
   He established a public holiday to honor Spiritual Baptists, who
blend African and Christian beliefs. He granted a Christmas bonus
to mostly black street cleaners, trash collectors and other
government workers.
<p>
   ``There was trepidation among Africans when I first came to
office,'' said Panday in an interview. ``So I've had to stabilize
society, assuring everyone that I wouldn't upset the apple cart.''
<p>
   But Panday's overtures have prompted Indians to accuse him of
inverse discrimination, exacerbating racial discord.
<p>
   ``In the past, most state scholarships were given to blacks and
there was discrimination against Indians,'' said Sat Maharaj,
secretary general of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, one of
Trinidad's largest Hindu organizations. ``And now the danger is
that Panday will bend over backwards to please the Africans to such
an extent that Indians will still be discriminated against.''
<p>
   Blacks don't see it that way, and fear domination by a people
that already holds sway over the economy.
<p>
   ``Blacks always felt that as long as they controlled the
government, it was o.k. if Indians controlled commerce,'' said
Selwyn Ryan, the black director of the Center for Ethnic Studies at
the University of the West Indies.``But now with the election of
Panday, many blacks feel that the balance of power has been tipped
too much.''
<p>
    &UR; (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.) &LR; 
<p>
   In the years after British rule began in 1797, Africans were
brought over as slaves to work sugar and cocoa plantations. After
emancipation in 1838, labor became scarce and Indians were brought
over to work the farms.
<p>
   Since independence from Britain in 1962, each group has
prospered in its own way. Blacks have controlled government and
thereby largely dominated civil service and government jobs. At the
same time, many Indians succeeded in family-controlled businesses
and in professions, especially medicine.
<p>
   Each group believes the other has prospered more than it has.
Members of both races use racial slurs casually, and both have
formed well-defined perceptions about the other.
<p>
   Blacks call Indians ostentatious and materialistic, often
pointing out that the most-decorated homes at Christmastime are the
ones owned by Indians. For their part, Indians call blacks lazy and
easygoing, adding that they prefer partying and spending to working
and saving.
<p>
   ``Indians often use the word nigger when referring to blacks,
and blacks often use the word coolie when referring to Indians,''
said Rhona Baptiste, who owns a bookstore here. ``But this is a
small country, and people of different races are friends, and
everyone is intimately involved with each other.''
<p>
   Coolie is a derogatory term for a person of Indian descent.
<p>
   While it's true that Indians and blacks dine together, work
together, visit each other's homes and even inter-marry, this
social civility has never translated into harmony at the political
level.
<p>
   Recently, for example, nightclub owners started holding separate
events for blacks, whites and Indians, calling it ``niche
marketing.'' But representatives of all races have accused the
clubs of discrimination, and Attorney General Ramesh Maharaj has
introduced legislation to revoke the licenses of clubs that
segregate patrons.
<p>
    &UR; (Story can end here. Optional add follows.) &LR; 
<p>
   Many residents are hoping that as people grow accustomed to the
change in leadership, the country will be able to move beyond the
race issue and get on with the business of economic development.
<p>
   A new $1 billion liquefied natural gas plant is in the works,
and stands to become the country's largest single investment.
<p>
   And to attract U.S. investors and tourists, Trinidad and Tobago
plans to open its first consulate in Miami later this year.
<p>
   Panday has worked hard to develop a close relationship with the
United States.
<p>
   Trinidad was the first country in the Caribbean to sign a ``hot
pursuit'' pact allowing U.S. ships and planes to pursue suspected
illegal drug carriers into territorial waters and airspace. It was
the only Caribbean country visited by Secretary of State Warren
Christopher last March during a trip to Latin America. Over the
next two years, U.S. firms plan to invest more than $3 billion,
mostly in the petrochemical, oil and gas, and iron and steel
industries.
<p>
   ``I think things will get better once people realize that an
Indian prime minister can serve people of all races,'' Baptiste
said. ``People will realize that the sun still shines, and that it
still rains, and that the sky isn't going to fall.''

<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney
Co.'s ABC television network must pay Food Lion Inc. $5.5 million
in punitive damages for having two news producers lie to get jobs
at the supermarket chain, a federal jury decided.
<p>
   The verdict stunned media lawyers, who said the successful
attack on a program that didn't libel anyone would spur similar
suits and reduce the number of investigations that use hidden
cameras.
<p>
   ``People are going to think three or four times before they do
something like this,'' said Robert Sack, a libel defense lawyer for
Time Inc., the Wall Street Journal and Newsday. ``There are going
to be stories about health, safety and other possible misdeeds that
will never get out.''
<p>
   Food Lion's Class A shares rose 1/8 to 9 1/8 in midafternoon
trading of 536,900, more than its three-month daily average of
479,000. Disney's stock rose 1/8 to 69 7/8.
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and its ``PrimeTime Live'' program
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage for a 1992
expose on food handling at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   The producers faked resumes to get low-level Food Lion jobs
where they could report on and film the company's practices. One of
the producers hid a small camera in her wig. The program then
showed Food Lion employees rewrapping and displaying meat after the
``sell-by'' dates had expired.
<p>
   Salisbury, North Carolina-based Food Lion claimed the report
cost it more than $2 billion in lost profit and stock value. U.S.
District Judge Carlton Tilley barred Food Lion from using the
content of the broadcast as evidence.
<p>
   The jury, which last week said it was deadlocked 11-1, spared
the two producers, directing two higher-ranking ABC executives to
pay a combined $45,750. Former ``PrimeTime'' executive producer
Richard Kaplan, now elsewhere at ABC, was told to pay $35,000 and
Senior Producer Ira Rosen was ordered to pay $10,750.
<p>
   ``We're very satisfied with the verdict,'' said Food Lion
attorney Richard Wyatt.
<p>
   ABC said it would appeal ``through all available channels'' if
Tilley doesn't set the verdict aside.
<p>
   The judgment ``should trouble every American,'' the network said
in a statement. ``Food Lion has succeeded in convincing a jury to
punish ABC for using undercover investigating techniques that
exposed its unsanitary practices.''
<p>
   Jurors said the verdict was intended only to warn the media that
they have to obey the law and not make false statements.
<p>
   ``No one wants to handcuff the media,'' said jury foreman Greg
Mack. ``The real problem came (because) ABC had no guidelines.''
<p>
   Tony Kinton, a brewery worker in Reidsville, North Carolina,
said that he was the lone juror that hadn't wanted to award any
punitive damages. Others wanted to award billions of dollars and
some expressed their opinions before hearing any evidence, he said.
<p>
   ``We had no choice,'' Kinton said. ``We were going to send a
message to the press that there are limitations.''
<p>
   The verdict is the latest in a series of court decisions aimed
not at the content of news reports but at newsgathering techniques.
Rulings in the past year have allowed juries to consider whether
reporters invaded the privacy of accident victims and barred a
camera crew from following the son of an executive at U.S.
Healthcare Inc.
<p>
   ``People are angry at people who gather the news and the way
they gather the news, even when it is in the public interest,''
said libel lawyer Sack.
<p>
   In the Food Lion case, the Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last
month awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the
salaries earned by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Sack predicted that the gap between the small compensatory
damages and the multimillion-dollar punitive award would prompt the
judge or the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reduce the amount
of punitive damages.
<p>
   The slight rise in Food Lion's shares indicates that investors
realize that the chain must do more to win back customers, analysts
said. Food Lion has revamped its stores and preparation methods to
restore customer confidence.
<p>
   ``It's probably the safest place to buy perishables now,'' said
Salomon Brothers analyst Jonathon Ziegler.
<p>
   Sales, however, are not increasing as quickly as they had before
the show, when Food Lion was the fastest-growing grocer in the
country. And its net income hasn't recovered since 1992.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.

<p>
   Edmonton, Alberta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Like most of his
teammates, Edmonton Oilers rookie right wing Mike Grier will be
watching the Super Bowl on Sunday.
<p>
   Unlike his teammates, Grier has a personal interest in the game
between the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers. His father,
Bobby Grier, is the Patriots' director of player personnel.
<p>
   ``It's kind of an emotional game for me,'' said Grier, who grew
up in Holliston, Massachusetts, and has been a Patriots fan his
whole life. ``Hopefully they can win.''
<p>
   Before he can turn his mind to football though, Grier will have
to focus on his team's hockey game against the Capitals in
Washington.
<p>
   ``Luckily our game is in the afternoon (noon Washington time),''
Grier said, ``so I'll have plenty of time to watch the Super
Bowl.''
<p>
   The Super Bowl starts about six hours later in New Orleans.
<p>
   The 22-year-old Grier, who at 6-foot-1, 235 pounds could almost
pass for an NFL linebacker. Grier said his choice of hockey over
football was geographically influenced.
<p>
   ``I basically grew up my whole life in Massachusetts and it's a
pretty big hockey area,'' he said. ``Once I got into it and started
playing, I really fell in love with it.''
<p>
   Grier's father was the Patriots running backs coach in 1985 when
the Chicago Bears trounced New England 46-10 in Super Bowl XX.
<p>
   His son, who won a national championship with Boston University
in 1995, hopes Dad has better luck the second time around.
<p>
   ``In '85 things didn't go so well,'' said Grier, who has five
goals and nine assists in 45 games with Edmonton this season. ``I'm
just glad he has another shot at it.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  If Bill Clinton were a painter, his rendering of
the 21st century would be a massive mural in which America would be
depicted as a land radiating ``a new spirit of community for a new
century.''
<p>
   In bold strokes and vivid colors, the president would people his
landscape with ancient adversaries  &MD;  Democrats and Republicans,
liberals and conservatives, blacks and whites, rich and poor,
Christians and Jews, old and young  &MD;  who have tasted the milk of
human compassion and become addicted to it.
<p>
   Cynicism, acrimony and prejudice would have no place in the
tranquil scene sketched by the man from Hope.
<p>
   ``Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity
will be a godsend in the 21st Century, '' proclaimed the president
at the beginning of his second term. ``Great rewards will come to
those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge
new ties that bind together.''
<p>
   When in November the American people elected a Democratic
president and a Republican Congress, Clinton contended, they did
not do so to advance ``the politics of petty bickering and extreme
partisanship.''
<p>
   Instead, he said, they called on us to ``be repairers of the
breach and to move on with America's mission.''
<p>
   Thus did the 42nd president chart a course in which people will
work and serve together in a common endeavor to enrich a land of
new promise.
<p>
   But were the eloquent words just a fantasy, an unreal belief
that a president can cement such a bond with his adversaries and
then move in tandem with them toward a glorious future?
<p>
   Other presidents have promised to work with the opposition in a
bipartisan effort. But eventually they have had to recognize the
reality that politicians and political parties are in stiff
competition with each other and, therefore, must oppose each other.
<p>
   Yet Clinton is determined to give it a try. Rarely if ever has a
president filled his inaugural address with such grandiloquent
overtures to his political foes.
<p>
   The day after his inaugural, Clinton said he intended to meet
the Republicans ``halfway'' on several major issues, including
Medicare. In the budget that he will submit to Congress on Feb. 6,
Clinton will include $138 billion in proposed spending cuts over a
six-year period.
<p>
   What he foresees in the 21st Century, said Clinton, is a nation
that ``balances its budget but never loses the balance of its
values; a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and
health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms
necessary to sustain those benefits for their time.''
<p>
   Although the times and the circumstances are vastly changed,
Clinton sees himself as a president in the mold of Thomas
Jefferson, who at the beginning of the 19th Century doubled the
size of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase, and Theodore
Roosevelt, who helped America ``harness the Industrial Revolution
to our values of free enterprise, conservation and human decency''
at the dawn of this century.
<p>
   Presidents carefully select the predecessor they wish to
emulate.
<p>
   In 1992, when he was hanging on the ropes, George Bush tried
desperately to make it appear that he was about to score a
startling upset just as Harry Truman did in 1948.
<p>
   But Clinton was even more adept at drawing a comparison between
himself and the plain-spoken Missourian. Receiving the support of
Truman's daughter, Margaret, he journeyed to Independence, Mo., to
identify himself with Truman.
<p>
   That comparison no longer is necessary to Clinton. Where Truman
won votes and scored political points by giving the Republicans
hell, Clinton has decided he can achieve the same objective by
locking arms with them.
<p>
   Having declared the era of big government to be over, it isn't
wise for him to try to don the mantle of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
<p>
   It is far better for him to try to carve a career molded after
that of Teddy Roosevelt, an energetic and enlightened leader who
forced social and economic reform upon the Republican Party and
decreed that America was a world power.
<p>
   At the start of his second term, Clinton obviously is seeking a
prominent niche in the pantheon of presidents. He is determined to
do and say those things that will at last make his presidency an
historic one.
<p>
   His objective, he said, is to help a free people ``shape the
forces of the information age and the global society, to unleash
the limitless potential of all our people and, yes, to form a more
perfect union.''
<p>
   The meaning of the canvas he has painted is best found in the
words of the dying Cardinal Joseph Bernardin that he quoted: ``It
is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and
division.''
<p>
   The great test of Clinton's last four years in the White House
will be to further endow and preserve the glowing panorama he has
painted.

<p>
   Edmonton, Alberta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Like most of his
teammates, Edmonton Oilers rookie right wing Mike Grier will be
watching the Super Bowl on Sunday.
<p>
   Unlike his teammates, Grier has a personal interest in the game
between the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers. His father,
Bobby Grier, is the Patriots' director of player personnel.
<p>
   ``It's kind of an emotional game for me,'' said Grier, who grew
up in Holliston, Massachusetts, and has been a Patriots fan his
whole life. ``Hopefully they can win.''
<p>
   Before he can turn his mind to football though, Grier will have
to focus on his team's hockey game against the Capitals in
Washington.
<p>
   ``Luckily our game is in the afternoon (noon Washington time),''
Grier said, ``so I'll have plenty of time to watch the Super
Bowl.''
<p>
   The Super Bowl starts about six hours later in New Orleans.
<p>
   The 22-year-old Grier, who at 6-foot-1, 235 pounds could almost
pass for an NFL linebacker. Grier said his choice of hockey over
football was geographically influenced.
<p>
   ``I basically grew up my whole life in Massachusetts and it's a
pretty big hockey area,'' he said. ``Once I got into it and started
playing, I really fell in love with it.''
<p>
   Grier's father was the Patriots running backs coach in 1985 when
the Chicago Bears trounced New England 46-10 in Super Bowl XX.
<p>
   His son, who won a national championship with Boston University
in 1995, hopes Dad has better luck the second time around.
<p>
   ``In '85 things didn't go so well,'' said Grier, who has five
goals and nine assists in 45 games with Edmonton this season. ``I'm
just glad he has another shot at it.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS  &MD;  Hannalore Kohl, the wife of Germany's grossly overweight
chancellor, has just published a calorifically challenging cookbook
of her husband's favorite fare: dishes like cholesterol-laden
sauerbraten, fatty sausages and pork and red cabbage drowning in
lard.
<p>
   It's become a best-seller.
<p>
   Gastronomic correctness clearly has no place in the Kohl family
kitchen. Thereby hangs a political tale.
<p>
   To borrow the jargon of the diet gurus, Helmut Kohl is what he
eats.
<p>
   He's a supremely unself-conscious figure who pays no attention
to his heroic girth and hasn't the slightest urge to look trim.
<p>
   His confident disdain for being other than he is has helped to
make him an astonishingly successful politician.
<p>
   The voters don't seem to care what he looks like, either. They
just keep putting him in office.
<p>
   He may be the only major political figure of our time who is
genuinely comfortable with himself  &MD;  and that goes also for his
ample waistline.
<p>
   Somehow, this has gotten through to the German public. It has
made him unassailable in their eyes.
<p>
   The German economy is floundering and unemployment has hit a
record high, but, remarkably, none of the political fallout has
rubbed off on Kohl personally.
<p>
   ``Kohl never pretends, never fakes it,'' according to German
political writer Anne-Marie Kroller. ``Of how many other
politicians can this be said?''
<p>
   His 15-year stint as chancellor has broken the postwar longevity
record of his mentor, Konrad Adenauer. Most analysts consider it
all but certain he will surpass the all-time German record of 18
years set by Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century.
<p>
   Kohl towers over the 15-nation European Union and will probably
fulfill his ambition to enter history as the father of European
political integration.
<p>
   He is a fat man in a political world otherwise dominated by thin
men or, at least, as in Bill Clinton's case, by leaders
demonstrating through the media their obsession with fitness. Even
Boris Yeltsin, before illness laid him low, made sure the TV
cameras were rolling whenever he played tennis.
<p>
   Kohl scorns all this. In his lone concession to his tailor, he
retreats every summer to an Austrian lake for two weeks where his
intake is said to consist of nothing but sauerkraut juice.
<p>
   But journalists are never invited to witness the ordeal. There
are no photo opportunities to show the chancellor guzzling his
liquid diet or, God forbid, exercising.
<p>
   When he returns to Bonn, observers invariably note that his suit
jackets still stretch tautly over his ample front.
<p>
   To describe Kohl as out-of-shape is like saying Al Gore may
occasionally weigh the possibility of running for president.
<p>
   Yet he is proof that, contrary to what most modern politicians
and their spin doctors believe, image is not everything.
<p>
   Contentedly shoveling down Frau Kohl's dumplings, the rotund
chancellor has emerged as a political pin-up who is the envy of
svelter but lesser men.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela's government said only
four of the country's commercial jets meet U.S. noise regulations,
which could result in reduced service to that country.
<p>
   Transportation Minister Moises Graterol Orozco said all four
belong to Aerovias Venezolanas SA, the country's largest domestic
airline.
<p>
   ``Only four aircraft are fit to enter the U.S.,'' said Graterol
Orozco.
<p>
   Many of Venezuela's jets, mostly older Boeing 727's, 737's and
DC-9s, don't meet U.S. sound regulations adopted in 1990. The jets
have to be fitted with so-called hush kits that reduce their engine
noise. Kits cost about US$1.4 million to $2 million a plane, which
many Venezuelan carriers can't afford, officials said.
<p>
   Yesterday, Aerovias Venezolanas said its Servivensa unit
temporarily suspended daily service to New York and reduced its
flights to Miami because some of its aircraft don't meet U.S. noise
regulations.
<p>
   Servivensa's service to Miami and New York were suspended last
year after the U.S. said its jets didn't meet safety regulations,
leading the Federal Aviation Administration to threaten to revoke
the landing rights of all Venezuelan carriers, including
Servivensa.
<p>
   Avensa, as the airline is known, and Servivensa are partially
owned by H.L. Boulton &AMP; Co., a Caracas-based holding company, and
the Venezuelan government.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney
Co.'s ABC television network must pay Food Lion Inc. $5.5 million
in punitive damages for having two news producers lie to get jobs
at the supermarket chain, a federal jury decided.
<p>
   The verdict stunned media lawyers, who said the successful
attack on a program that didn't libel anyone would spur similar
suits and reduce the number of investigations that use hidden
cameras.
<p>
   ``People are going to think three or four times before they do
something like this,'' said Robert Sack, a libel defense lawyer for
Time Inc., the Wall Street Journal and Newsday. ``There are going
to be stories about health, safety and other possible misdeeds that
will never get out.''
<p>
   Food Lion's Class A shares rose 1/8 to 9 1/8 in midafternoon
trading of 536,900, more than its three-month daily average of
479,000. Disney's stock rose 1/8 to 69 7/8.
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and its ``PrimeTime Live'' program
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage for a 1992
expose on food handling at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   The producers faked resumes to get low-level Food Lion jobs
where they could report on and film the company's practices. One of
the producers hid a small camera in her wig. The program then
showed Food Lion employees rewrapping and displaying meat after the
``sell-by'' dates had expired.
<p>
   Salisbury, North Carolina-based Food Lion claimed the report
cost it more than $2 billion in lost profit and stock value. U.S.
District Judge Carlton Tilley barred Food Lion from using the
content of the broadcast as evidence.
<p>
   The jury, which last week said it was deadlocked 11-1, spared
the two producers, directing two higher-ranking ABC executives to
pay a combined $45,750. Former ``PrimeTime'' executive producer
Richard Kaplan, now elsewhere at ABC, was told to pay $35,000 and
Senior Producer Ira Rosen was ordered to pay $10,750.
<p>
   ``We're very satisfied with the verdict,'' said Food Lion
attorney Richard Wyatt.
<p>
   ABC said it would appeal ``through all available channels'' if
Tilley doesn't set the verdict aside.
<p>
   The judgment ``should trouble every American,'' the network said
in a statement. ``Food Lion has succeeded in convincing a jury to
punish ABC for using undercover investigating techniques that
exposed its unsanitary practices.''
<p>
   Jurors said the verdict was intended only to warn the media that
they have to obey the law and not make false statements.
<p>
   ``No one wants to handcuff the media,'' said jury foreman Greg
Mack. ``The real problem came (because) ABC had no guidelines.''
<p>
   Tony Kinton, a brewery worker in Reidsville, North Carolina,
said that he was the lone juror that hadn't wanted to award any
punitive damages. Others wanted to award billions of dollars and
some expressed their opinions before hearing any evidence, he said.
<p>
   ``We had no choice,'' Kinton said. ``We were going to send a
message to the press that there are limitations.''
<p>
   The verdict is the latest in a series of court decisions aimed
not at the content of news reports but at newsgathering techniques.
Rulings in the past year have allowed juries to consider whether
reporters invaded the privacy of accident victims and barred a
camera crew from following the son of an executive at U.S.
Healthcare Inc.
<p>
   ``People are angry at people who gather the news and the way
they gather the news, even when it is in the public interest,''
said libel lawyer Sack.
<p>
   In the Food Lion case, the Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last
month awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the
salaries earned by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Sack predicted that the gap between the small compensatory
damages and the multimillion-dollar punitive award would prompt the
judge or the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reduce the amount
of punitive damages.
<p>
   The slight rise in Food Lion's shares indicates that investors
realize that the chain must do more to win back customers, analysts
said. Food Lion has revamped its stores and preparation methods to
restore customer confidence.
<p>
   ``It's probably the safest place to buy perishables now,'' said
Salomon Brothers analyst Jonathon Ziegler.
<p>
   Sales, however, are not increasing as quickly as they had before
the show, when Food Lion was the fastest-growing grocer in the
country. And its net income hasn't recovered since 1992.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.

 &UR; By Jenny Tomkins and Tom Ferraro &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Without dissent, the U.S. Senate
confirmed Madeline Albright as the first woman to be U.S. secretary
of state. Albright, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nation's in the first Clinton administration, is the first
appointee to Clinton's second term cabinet to be approved by the
Senate. Today's 99-0 vote, the first Senate floor vote this year,
came two days after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
unanimously recommended that she be confirmed. Albright was praised
by Democrats and Republicans alike, along with much of the U.S.
corporate community, which likes her pro-business positions. She
particularly pleased business leaders at her Jan. 8 confirmation
hearing when she told the Foreign Relations Committee that the
United States must seek to engage, not isolate China -- the world's
most populous nation. Albright testified that U.S. trade with Asia,
particularly China, is high on the Clinton administration's agenda.
``In Asia,'' she said, ``China is rapidly emerging as the next
great power in our era.'' Mattel Inc., and Boeing Co., are among
the major U.S. companies with financial interests in China.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   There have been repeated efforts in recent years to strip China
of the U.S.'s most-favored nation trading status because of human
rights violations. Those attempts have been thwarted, though, by
both Democratic and Republican administrations, which saw trade as
a key to relations with China. Albright also promised, as secretary
of state, to protect U.S. companies and workers in international
trade disputes.
<p>
   ``A principle responsibility of the Department of State is to
see that American companies and workers receive fair treatment and
that inequitable barriers to competition are overcome,'' she told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at its Jan. 8 hearing.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
International Business Machines Corp.'s weaker-than-expected profit
dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower.
<p>
   The Dow industrials fell 60.81 to 6823.09, with some 32 points
of the decline attributable to IBM. The world's largest computer
maker sank 10 1/2 to 158 7/8.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't the market's overvalued in the context of all of
the positives,'' he said. ``You have declining interest rates;
corporate America's become more profitable and more competitive.
We're in an hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Dean Witter Discover Co. added
surprisingly strong earnings announcements to this week's pile of
profit reports, helping broader averages set records for a fifth
straight session.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which comprises 75
percent of the market capitalization of U.S. stocks, gained 0.79 to
783.51. The index retreated, then bounced back after weak demand
for a $17.5 billion sale of two-year government notes sent bond
yields higher. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, General Electric Co. and Intel
Corp. offset IBM's decline.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which includes many computer stocks,
gained 5.87 to 1382.84, after rising as much as 10.30 points.
Microsoft Corp. led the advance for a third day.
<p>
   Mutual fund inflows continued to help shares. Mutual Fund Trim
Tabs, a newsletter that tracks money going to mutual funds, said
assets are pouring in at a $28.4 billion monthly pace, $500 million
short of the record set last January.
<p>
   ``You're having tremendous demand for stocks,'' said Philip
Brown, president of Meridian Investment Co., with $3.7 billion in
equities. ``You have an economy that isn't doing that bad.
Corporate profits aren't declining -- they just aren't going to be
up as much.''
<p>
   Fourth-quarter profit growth of 18 percent couldn't support IBM
shares, which had risen 66 percent in the year up to the report
released after the market's close yesterday. A stronger dollar and
weak demand in Europe hurt the bottom line. Net income for the
computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3 cents below analysts'
expectations.
<p>
   On the heels of surprisingly good numbers from Intel and
Microsoft, other computer-industry shares held up amid IBM's
retreat.
<p>
   Computer maker Dell Computer Corp. rose 1 3/4 to 65 7/8. Gateway
2000 Inc., a computer retailer, rose 2 1/8 to 61 3/8. Electronic
Data Systems Inc., a primary competitor for IBM's lucrative
computer services business, gained 1/4 to 47 3/4. Microsoft rose 2
to a record 97 and Intel jumped 3 5/16 to 151 3/8, a peak as well.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, a senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at the No. 1 maker of personal
computers, Compaq. The Houston-based computer maker said earnings
gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing expectations by 11
cents. Compaq jumped 5 1/8 to 83 5/8.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, topping forecasts. Its shares
gained 7/8 to 38.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a share, 2 cents
above analysts' expectations, according to IBES International Inc.
The shares fell 1/8 to 121 1/2, after rising 12 percent from the
start of the year to yesterday, almost double the DJIA's gain in
the same period.
<p>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson jumped 3 3/8 to a record 56 7/8 after gaining
2 1/2 yesterday. The health-care product company said earnings rose
20 percent before trading began yesterday. Its shares have risen 31
percent in the past year.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's fell 7/8 to
38 1/2.
<p>
   Steris Corp. sank 8 1/8 to 29 7/8 after Bill Sanford, the
company's chairman and chief executive, told Dow Jones he expects
the medical device company to earn 38 cents a share in the fiscal
third quarter, below analysts' average expectation of 53 cents,
according to IBES.
<p>
   Norand Corp., a maker of mobile computers, surged 13 1/2 to 32
7/8 after Western Atlas Inc. said it would pay $261.3 million, or
$33.50 a share in cash, for all of Norand's 7.8 million shares.
Western Atlas fell 2 1/8 to 70.
<p>
   Gains in stocks were muted as the yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond rose 3 basis points to 6.81 percent. The yield is
used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, so when it rises
it can hurt companies' bottom lines.

<p>
   Edmonton, Alberta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Like most of his
teammates, Edmonton Oilers rookie right wing Mike Grier will be
watching the Super Bowl on Sunday.
<p>
   Unlike his teammates, Grier has a personal interest in the game
between the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers. His father,
Bobby Grier, is the Patriots' director of player personnel.
<p>
   ``It's kind of an emotional game for me,'' said Grier, who grew
up in Holliston, Massachusetts, and has been a Patriots fan his
whole life. ``Hopefully they can win.''
<p>
   Before he can turn his mind to football though, Grier will have
to focus on his team's hockey game against the Capitals in
Washington.
<p>
   ``Luckily our game is in the afternoon (noon Washington time),''
Grier said, ``so I'll have plenty of time to watch the Super
Bowl.''
<p>
   The Super Bowl starts about six hours later in New Orleans.
<p>
   The 22-year-old Grier, who at 6-foot-1, 235 pounds could almost
pass for an NFL linebacker, said his choice of hockey over football
was geographically influenced.
<p>
   ``I basically grew up my whole life in Massachusetts and it's a
pretty big hockey area,'' he said. ``Once I got into it and started
playing, I really fell in love with it.''
<p>
   Grier's father was the Patriots running backs coach in 1985 when
the Chicago Bears trounced New England 46-10 in Super Bowl XX.
<p>
   His son, who won a national championship with Boston University
in 1995, hopes Dad has better luck the second time around.
<p>
   ``In '85 things didn't go so well,'' said Grier, who has five
goals and nine assists in 45 games with Edmonton this season. ``I'm
just glad he has another shot at it.''

<p>
   Pittsburgh, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Allegheny Teledyne Inc.'s
fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations as profits at its
specialty metals, aerospace and electronics units more than offset
lower stainless steel prices.
<p>
   Profit from operations rose 31 percent to $68.2 million, or 40
cents a share, from pro forma profit from operations of $52.1
million, or 30 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose
less than 1 percent to $920.3 million from $914.7 million.
<p>
   The Pittsburgh-based company's profit from operations surpassed
the average estimate of 29 cents a share from five analysts polled
by First Call Corp.
<p>
   Allegheny's earnings were helped by the August acquisition of
Teledyne Inc. for $2.25 billion in stock, which transformed
stainless steel producer Allegheny Ludlum Corp. into the largest
U.S. producer of specialty metals.
<p>
   ``The year ended with upward earnings momentum,'' said William
Rutledge, Allegheny Teledyne's chief executive officer and
president, in a statement. ``Many of the synergies from our
business combination were put in place in the fourth quarter. These
moves should add to earnings in 1997.''
<p>
   Allegheny Teledyne shares rose 1/4 to 21 3/4 in midday trading
of 623,800, almost double the three-month daily average.
<p>
   Charges amounting to $16.8 million, or 10 cents a share,
resulted in net income of $51.4 million, or 30 cents. The charges
are for debt redemption, merger and restructuring costs and
litigation settlements, an include a gain from the sale of real
estate. In the year-earlier quarter, charges of $3.1 million, or 2
cents a share, resulted in pro forma net income $49 million, or 28
cents, the company said. The 1995 results were restated to reflect
the Teledyne purchase. Strong demand from the aerospace industry
for specialty metals, avionics, engines and other products helped
boost earnings, the company said. Operating profit in the specialty
metals unit rose 23 percent to $70.6 million from $57.6 million.
Revenue fell 7.2 percent to $482.9 million from $520.3 million,
dragged down by lower prices for flat-rolled stainless steel. The
company expects the Teledyne acquisition to make it less vulnerable
to downturns in the steel industry. The specialty metals unit
generates half of Allegheny Teledyne's revenue. Operating profit
from aerospace and electronics increased 62 percent to $34.8
million as revenue rose 9.2 percent to $252.8 million, Allegheny
Teledyne said. For the full year, Allegheny Teledyne said profit
from operations fell 5.6 percent to $236.5 million, or $1.34 a
share, from $250.4 million, or $1.41, in 1995. In 1996, a
combination of gains and charges reduced earnings by $23.5 million,
or 14 cents a share, making net income $213 million, or $1.20. In
1995, a gain of $23.5 million, or 13 cents a share, resulted in net
income of $273.9 million, or $1.54, the company said. Revenue from
continuing operations was little changed, inching up to $3.77
billion from $3.76 billion Allegheny Teledyne has said it expects
pre-tax cost savings of at least $85 million a year after the
acquisition. The company is using Teledyne's pension fund surplus
of $850 million to fund pension liabilities and retiree medical
expenses at Allegheny Ludlum operations.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Marvel
Entertainment Group Inc.'s $100 million credit agreement with Chase
Manhattan Bank was rejected by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
<p>
   Judge Helen S. Balick extended a $20 million interim credit
facility and said she wouldn't approve the final, $100 million
facility until two provisions were removed.
<p>
   Balick said she rejected the agreement on the basis of the
provision that Ronald Perelman must retain at least 51 percent
control or a loan default would be triggered. She also opposed a
provision that said the loan would be in default if anyone filed a
motion challenging the licensing agreement under which Toy Biz Inc.
can manufacture Marvel Entertainment-copyrighted products for free.
<p>
   Balick, in her ruling, was responding to objections filed by
holders of Marvel Holdings Inc. bonds, whose collateral would be
greatly reduced under Marvel Entertainment's proposed
reorganization plan.

   Sao Paulo, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks fell because
of concern that state-controlled companies like Telecomunicacoes
Brasilieras SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA are more expensive than their earnings prospects
justify.
<p>
   ``I'm surprised the fall isn't harder. I wouldn't buy these
stocks at these prices,'' said Sergio Blatyta, chief trader at
Banco Votorantim SA.
<p>
   The Bovespa index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange fell 874
points, or 1.1 percent, to 78,175.01, only the third decline so far
this year. In Rio de Janeiro, the IBV index fell 168 points, or 0.6
percent, to 29,581.
<p>
   The federally controlled telephone company known as Telebras and
the federal utility called Eletrobras rose to all-time highs
yesterday.
<p>
   The companies led a rally that pushed the Bovespa index 12.3
percent higher before today's decline. The companies account for 69
percent of the weight exchange officials assign to the index.
<p>
   Telebras, Petrobras and Eletrobras rose on government plans to
sell state assets this year and to open the oil and
telecommunications industries to private investment.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve
inadvertently released its regional survey of economic conditions
almost two hours early today, and officials at the central bank are
still trying to sort out what happened.
<p>
   ``We're even now,'' Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne quipped.
``Everybody has broken an embargo, including me.'' Coyne was caught
by surprise when called by a reporter inquiring about the report's
premature release.
<p>
   The Fed released its regional survey, commonly known as the
beige book, through the central bank's Internet site at 12:10 p.m.
Washington time. That was well ahead of the scheduled release time
of 2 p.m. Washington time.
<p>
   Coyne said the Fed didn't have an explanation for the early
release of its report. He said the central bank's computer
department is separate from the public affairs office, and he's
looking into it.
<p>
   One possible explanation for the glitch is the change in the
release time of the report. Today's release marked the first time
the Fed planned on releasing its regional survey at 2 p.m.
Washington time -- two hours after the previous regular release
time of noon. The Fed said it changed the release time to
accommodate financial markets, but didn't specify further.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the central
bank's 12 district banks and is published eight times each year.
The report will be used to form the basis for discussion on
interest rate targets at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the Fed's
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
<p>
   Today's report said the economy continues to grow with low
unemployment nudging labor costs higher. While the Fed found
``scattered evidence'' of pressures for higher wages in its latest
regional economic survey, the central bank still found no evidence
of accelerating consumer prices outside of energy.

<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  A few months back, during boxing trainer Kevin
Rooney's multimillion-dollar breach-of-contract suit against Mike
Tyson, I was standing with a mob outside the federal courthouse on
Broadway when the parties involved in the case swarmed down the
steps on a lunch break.
<p>
   A guy near me had brought his kids to catch a glimpse of Tyson.
Striding out behind the fighter was a big, bulky, bespectacled man
whose silvery hair stood straight on end, like the hair on those
little plastic troll dolls.
<p>
   ``Who's that, Dad?` one of the kids asked.
<p>
   ``The biggest crook in boxing,'' his father explained.
<p>
   A widely held opinion. The thickset man with the electrified
hair was Don King, con man supreme, the modern Rasputin of
professional boxing. A former numbers writer in Cleveland, King
served a 10-year prison term for manslaughter after stomping a
business competitor to death. While in the slammer, he devised a
new career for himself  &MD;  boxing manager and promoter.
<p>
   Preying on the racial fears of the young, poorly educated
minority guys who labor in this rugged sport, King has made untold
millions in a 25-year career. He's stiffed countless fighters who
are better at mayhem than math, and  &MD;  along the way  &MD;  he's nearly
ruined boxing.
<p>
   Who cares, you might say? It's a scummy, violent sport peopled
by thugs and lowlifes. Always has been. And there's truth in that,
too. Boxing's participants traditionally have been ghetto guys
without schooling who, for one reason or another, had no real
chance to develop marketable skills in more respectable sports like
football, basketball and baseball.
<p>
   But for all its brutality, boxing is the essential human
competition  &MD;  one on one, man to man, heart to heart. I like it and
I won't apologize for it, any more than I'll apologize for liking
opera. Properly officiated and managed, boxing is less dangerous
than football. You can ask Bo Jackson about that. And it has been a
pathway to decent lives for thousands of guys who would otherwise
have been ground under by the cruel conditions of the world into
which they were born.
<p>
   Floyd Patterson, the former heavyweight champion who now serves
as New York's boxing czar, is one of those guys. Boxing saved him
from a life of Brooklyn street thuggery and made him rich. The
celebrity it gave him motivated him to become a thoroughly
admirable man. He told me that when he was fighting in the 1950s
and 1960s almost everybody in the world knew who the 12 champions
in various weight classes were.
<p>
   King fixed that, though. Using his personal influence with
various minority fighters, he conferred respectability on the
alphabet-soup collection of sanctioning bodies that now dominate
the sport. He created so many champions in so many expanded weight
classes that not even Floyd Patterson can name all the champions
recognized by this or that phony sanctioning body.
<p>
   That's more. It's been King who's given us so many fake fights  &MD; 
mismatches like the one-round Mike Tyson KOs of Bruce Seldon and
Peter McNeeley. It's King who's given us so many shady decisions  &MD; 
fights in which one or more judges seem to have made their way to
ringside with the aid of seeing-eye dogs.
<p>
   Sure, he's staged great fights. But great fights happen because
great fighters exist to fight them. They happen because of destiny
and market forces, not because Don King has cast his magic spell
over some poor ghetto kid who worries that white promoters will rob
him.
<p>
   Overall, King has been a profoundly destructive force in boxing.
None of that, however, will keep him out of the International
Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, N.Y. The hall recently announced
that King and 12 other guys are to join the 160 fighters and
``non-participants` enshrined on plaques on the museum's wall.
<p>
   The hall is a marvelous institution, the brainchild of former
welterweight champion Carmen Basilio, who lives in Canastota.
Basilio wanted boxing to have its own shrine. He wanted Canestota
to be to boxing what Cooperstown is to baseball. He got the thing
up and running eight years ago with a small museum just off the New
York Thruway east of Syracuse. The museum has room to grow, and
Carmen Basilio wants to grow it. He wants to see true
respectability conferred on the sport he loves.
<p>
   But the admission of Don King to the company of gallant fighters
and honorable non-participants like the late Cus D'Amato, who built
the sport rather than debasing it, is a blunder of monumental
proportions.
<p>
   Boxing has long needed a shrine like Canastota. But why tarnish
that shrine with false idols like Don King?

   ECONOMY-US (Washington) -- While the economy's strong
performance over the past four years brought President Bill Clinton
back to the White House, few business leaders and economists think
it will last through his second term. By Michael McKee. 800.
<p>
   ECONOMY-FOOD (Washington) -- Consumer food prices in 1997 will
hold steady or even retreat after surging last year at their
highest rate since 1990, analysts say. That could remove one of the
inflation concerns that has been troubling policymakers at the
Federal Reserve. By Roger Runningen. 800.
<p>
   LEGAL-AFFAIRS (New York) -- Martha Stewart may be the
high-priestess of swanky suburban style to her fans, but to her
former gardener she's a wage cheat. He says she owes him more than
$30,000 in overtime for washing cars, grooming dogs and performing
other work at the Westport estate that serves as the set for the
``Martha Stewart Living'' shows on CBS and the Lifetime cable
channel. Stewart says no way, claiming he was an agricultural
worker who by law aren't entitled to overtime. By --Seena Simon.
950.
<p>
   MONEY-ON-NET (New York) -- Companies like Touch-It Inc., which
makes paper that changes color at different temperatures, was
unlikely to snare a big-name underwriter such as Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. to help it go public. So it turned to Direct Stock Market Inc.
for help. Direct Stock Market and others like it offer services
ranging from an online shopping mall, where investors can peruse
company information, to the hand-holding and assistance more
typical of an investment bank. By Duncan Martell. 1,000.
<p>
   AIRBUS-ADS (Atlanta) -- The television commercial touts the
virtues of a fast new model: Lots of leg room, great mileage --with
room for 300 and the ability to fly from New York to Paris nonstop.
Airbus Industrie is betting that out of millions of viewers a
select few will want its A330 jetliner. And at $110 million each, a
few buyers is all the European planemaker needs. By Anthony
Effinger and Adam Levy. 750.
<p>
   DISCLOSURE (Boston) -- General Motors Corp. gave a welcome
warning last month to a few close friends. One by one, the
automaker called analysts at top brokerage firms on Dec. 18 to say
that fourth-quarter costs would be higher than expected. GM stock
promptly plunged. Almost daily, companies big and small tell a
select group of investors and analysts that bad news is coming,
giving them a chance to bail out before everyone else. By Gerard
Meuchner. 1,000.
<p>
   PERSONAL-WEALTH (New York) -- Tightwads take note. Starting next
week, individual investors in the U.S. can buy stock in Merck &AMP;
Co., the nation's biggest drugmaker, directly from the Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey-based headquarters. Merck is one of about 200
American corporations that invite investors to buy their shares
directly from the companies themselves or their bank
representatives. Scott Schnipper. 600 words.
<p>
   TRADER (Chicago) -- It's 7:00 a.m. Central Time and for Mercury
Trading options dealers, the next seven and a half hours will
determine whether the firm's $121,000 investment is lost or becomes
millions. By Dylan Ratigan. 1,100.
<p>
   TAKING-STOCK -- (New York) Corporate profits don't have a prayer
of meeting expectations, interest rates are rising and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average is overpriced. Yet fear not, demand for
stock outpaces supply, and could lift the Dow Jones Industrial
Average another 25 percent. By Roger Madoff. 900.
<p>
   MINDING-MONEY (New York): Rich people, and the folks who manage
cash for them, are betting that they'll have to be a bit more
original this year to make money. Last year, U.S. stocks made lots
of money, but in 1997, investors are choosing managers who
specialize in specific sectors, who can put money overseas, or who
can sell stocks short. By Katherine Burton. 800.
<p>
   MUTUAL-FUNDS (Kansas City, Missouri) -- American Century
Investments has a new mutual fund that penalizes investors who
think short-term. American Century's Twentieth Century New
Opportunities Fund will charge extra fees to any investor who pulls
money within five years of buying shares
<p>
   PERSONAL-FUNDS (Boston) -- The concerns of many stock fund
investors is that the young hot-shots who run billions in
high-flying mutual fund assets these days have never been tested by
a real bear market. Not Massachusetts Investors Trust. With a
history that dates to 1924, it survived the Crash of 1929, the
Great Depression, not to mention the bear market of the 1970s. By
Tim Quinson and David A. Andelman. 1,000
<p>
   SELLING-HOMES (New York) -- Selling a home in the dead of winter
need not be a futile attempt thanks to some useful tips offered by
brokers from around the country. By Robert Burgess. 775.
<p>
   FASTENAL (Winona, Minnesota) -- Fastenal Co. shareholders aren't
the only ones nervous about the company's fourth-quarter earnings
report due Friday. Short-sellers --speculators who sold borrowed
shares in the hope of buying them back at a lower price -- may have
more at stake. They're betting that the fast-growing distributor of
nuts, bolts and other industrial supplies, which has come up short
of Wall Street earnings estimates in the last two quarters, will
again miss forecasts. By Daniel Fisher. 900.
<p>
   BRINKER (Dallas) -- To thrive, a so-called concept restaurant
chain like Brinker International Inc. must do two things: Jazz up
its old restaurants and come up with ideas for new ones. Brinker is
trying to patch up its 500 Chili Bar &AMP; Grill stores, but also is
trying the new -- in this case, a takeout store it calls Eatzi's,
which caters to upscale customers whose tastes range from exotic
fare to comfort food. By Shannon Stevens. 850.
<p>
   SPORTS-BIZ (New Orleans) -- Squads of National Football League
undercover agents will be prowling the streets of New Orleans
during Super Bowl week, looking for people selling merchandise with
unauthorized team logos. Just as licensed merchandise has become a
money machine for professional sports, bootleggers are making big
money by selling T-shirts, caps and other team paraphernalia
without paying for the right to use their logos. By W.D. Murray.
700
<p>
   FOOTBALL-LEAGUE (New York) -- Investors are forming the All
America Football League in a long-shot attempt to rival the
powerful National Football League, beginning in March 1998. By Jon
Friedman. 500.

   Home Section stories in sight at this hour from The N.Y. Times
News Service for Thursday, Jan. 23:
<p>
   SHODDY-HOUSES (Undated)  &MD;  Preliminary designs for Michael
Eisner's multimillion-dollar log cabin in Aspen, Colo., included
stone fireplaces to rival Yosemite National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel  &MD; 
and a retaining wall so thin that it would have buckled under its
own weight. At the multimillion-dollar Connecticut home of a tennis
champion, the foundation for a new guest house was laid over
construction-site trash, resulting in major cracks and leaks. And a
$40 million Long Island house for a billionaire software developer
used an inexpensive Western pine siding that was so vulnerable to
decay that it began to rot while the house was still under
construction. If people with unlimited budgets cannot count on
quality construction, who can? By Julie Iovine. (With Photo.)
<p>
   PARIS-U.S.-DESIGN-STUDENTS (Paris)  &MD;  Philippe Starck, watch your
back. American design students stormed Paris this year. Two weeks
ago, for the first time, 17 American design students from four
schools exhibited their work at the Paris furniture show, the Salon
du Meuble. And by all accounts they created une sensation. By
William L. Hamiliton. (With Photo.) 
<p>
   HENRY-GRUNWALD-PROFILE (New York)  &MD;  When Henry Grunwald ran into
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at a party in 1990, he told her he was
in the process of researching his memoir. ``She said, `Research?
Why do you want to do
research?' '' Grunwald recalled in his soft voice still accented
with German. `` `What I want to know is what Henry Grunwald thinks
about in the bathtub.' '' Seeing the wisdom of this  &MD;  reinforced by
the urging of his family and friends  &MD;  Grunwald wrote a very
different book, interweaving descriptions of public events with
personal impressions, pushing himself through an unfamiliar process
of self-disclosure. ``It was not easy,'' he said. ``I'm not very
easily given to the confessional style. There are a great many
people to whom conversation is confession. To me, it isn't
really.'' By Robin Pogrebin. (With Photo.) &HT;    
<p>
   CONSUMER-ELECTRONICS (Undated)  &MD;  For years now, electronics
manufacturers have promised that homes would soon be cocoons
outfitted with every type of entertainment and information
component. No longer far-off fantasies, such devices were on
display at the Consumer Electronics Show here earlier this month.
What's more, many will be on the market in a few months. By David
Elrich. (With ART)
<p>
   NY-ANTIQUES-SHOW (New York)  &MD;  Muses have gone out of fashion,
but given the largely unsurprising wares at the 43rd Winter
Antiques Show, the exposition could have used a deity like Mona
Strader Schlesinger Bush Williams von Bismarck de Martini. The
socialite, who died in 1983 at 86, would be the customer of any
dealer's dreams. During her heyday in the 1930s, a $700 million
fortune insured that whatever Mona wanted, Mona got. Too bad this
avaricious sylph, best known as Mona Bismarck, is not around,
checkbook ajar. Clients like her  &MD;  old-fashioned, flaunt-happy
plutocrats  &MD;  would spice up the Winter Antiques Show, a
once-sparkling exhibition that appears to be sliding into a
blancmange. For the benefit of the East Side House Settlement, the
show opened on Jan. 16 and closes Sunday. By Mitchell Owens.
<p>
   ECART-FURNITURE (Undated)  &MD;  Andree Putman, the French interior
designer, is leaving Ecart International, the company she founded
in 1978 to re-issue classics of early 20th century furniture
design, said Michel Taurel, development manager of Ecopar, the
parent company of Ecart. Taurel would not say whether or not she
was fired. ``It's an agreement between her and Ecopar,'' he said,
``because you know, she is seventy and something old, and she is
actually retiring from her activities at Ecart.'' Mrs. Putman could
not be reached for comment. By Elaine Louie.

<p>
   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela's government said an
long-awaited five-year tax exemption for new investment projects
will be delayed longer for revision.
<p>
   The tax, being created to spur oil and other export geared
investments, was completed last week by Venezuela's tax authority
and finance ministry.
<p>
   It will be revised following complaints from state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, said Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos
Azocar following the weekly cabinet meeting.
<p>
   Matos Azocar did not specify what the shortcomings were or when
a new draft would be completed.
<p>
   Last week several oil companies complained the exemption was not
transparent and, in particular instances, involved reimbursements
in the form of tax coupons.
<p>
   The exemption is to apply during pre-operative stages of
investments for oil, mining and other export geared industries.
Congress approved the framework last July. Foreign oil companies,
waiting to spend billions of dollars on exploration projects, are
waiting for the government to complete the details.
<p>
   Venezuela reopened its oil industry to private investment last
year for the first time in 20 years. PDVSA, as the state oil
company is known, plans to double daily oil production capacity by
2006.

Palm Beach, Florida, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Quick &AMP; Reilly Group
Inc. said it agreed to acquire Nash, Weiss &AMP; Co., a Nasdaq market
maker. Terms weren't disclosed.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Thomas Quick, president of Quick &AMP; Reilly, said the proposed
acquisition wouldn't hurt his firm's earnings. ``This will give us
returns that the shareholders are used to,'' Quick said.
<p>
   Quick &AMP; Reilly said Dec. 18 that earnings rose 22 percent in the
third quarter ended Nov. 29 from the comparable year-earlier
period.
<p>
   Nash Weiss would contribute $60 million in annual revenue to
Quick &AMP; Reilly, which had revenue of $500 million last year. No
acquisition in Quick &AMP; Reilly history has produced a revenue gain
of that amount, Quick said.
<p>
   Quick said he expected the transaction to be completed by Feb.
28.
<p>
   ``We have been selective in making acquisitions,'' Quick said.
He said Nash Weiss will remain under its current management and
remain at its Jersey City, New Jersey, headquarters.
<p>
   Nash Weiss is the fifth-largest independently owned Nasdaq
trading firm, executing orders in about 2,500 issues a day, Quick
said.
<p>
   Quick &AMP; Reilly's shares were unchanged at 33 1/8 in late
afternoon trading.
<p>
   For Nash Weiss, Quick &AMP; Reilly's financial strength will help
the firm increase the number of stocks in which it makes a market,
Ronald Weiss, chairman of Nash Weiss, said in a statement.
<p>
   Quick &AMP; Reilly operates the nation's third-largest discount

<p>
   Detroit, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Comerica Inc. said it will cut
1,890 jobs, or 14 percent of its payroll, and close about 15
branches to slash costs and boost profits.
<p>
   The Detroit-based bank took a $90 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to reflect the costs of the job cuts and
other restructuring moves. Comerica doesn't know how many people
will be fired and how many unfilled positions will be eliminated,
said bank spokesman Wayne Mielke.
<p>
   The bank said the steps, such as using computers to help make
loans and streamline financial reporting, will boost revenue $110
million a year, starting in the first half of 1998. Comerica is
taking these steps to convince investors that the bank --often
cited by analysts as a likely takeover target -- should remain
independent.
<p>
   ``Sounds like they heard footsteps,'' said James Schmidt, a
portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds, which owns 552,800 shares.
``They're nervous about being taken over, and this is a move to
forestall that.''
<p>
   Comerica announced the steps as it reported fourth-quarter
profit from operations rose 14 percent to $121 million, or $1.06 a
share -- a penny shy of Wall Street expectations.
<p>
   Comerica shares fell 3/8 to 55 7/8 in afternoon trading.
<p>
   Comerica joins Keycorp, First of America Corp. and Signet
Banking Corp., among other companies which are under pressure from
investors to boost profits by cutting costs.
<p>
   The moves also makes the bank less attractive to acquirers,
analysts said, because there's less waste to trim. Often banks
justify the price of a takeover by finding costs savings.
<p>
   The bank began its restructuring program, Direction 2000, in
February 1995, setting up consumer, business and investment banking
units, and consolidating back office operations. Last September
Comerica employees were asked to come up with suggestions to reduce
costs at the bank.
<p>
   The bank was advised by Chandrika Tandon's Tandon Capital
Associates, a New York-based consultant that built a reputation for
slashing payrolls at other banks. Fleet Financial Corp., Chase
Manhattan Corp., Michigan National Bank, and Midlantic Bancorp all
used Tandon to devise ways to boost profits at least in part by
firing workers.
<p>
   In its earnings report, Comerica said net interest income rose
3.6 percent to $353.3 million as loans outstanding increased 4.7
percent to an average of $25.5 billion in the quarter. The net
interest margin widened to 4.61 percent from 4.31 percent.
<p>
   Overall credit quality improved, as the bank reduced by 3
percent to $32 million the amount it set aside for future loan
losses while net write-offs fell 38 percent to $22.3 million.
<p>
   Total noninterest income fell 5.8 percent to $132.4 million,
amid declines in broker fees and revolving credit fees.
<p>
   Noninterest expense rose 24 percent to $356.2 million. Excluding
the restructuring charge, expenses fell 7.7 percent.
<p>
   For full year 1996, net income rose 0.9 percent to $417.2
million, or $3.55 a share, from $413.4 million, or $3.54, in 1995.
Comerica, which has $34 billion in assets, operates about 265
branches in Michigan, California, Texas and Florida.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.
said fourth-quarter earnings rose 28 percent as rising income from
managing clients' money and from penalties charged to credit card
customers overcame credit card losses.
<p>
   The company, which owns broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
issues the Discover credit card, said net income rose to $227.8
million, or 68 cents a share, from $178.1 million, or 51 cents, a
year earlier.
<p>
   The earnings beat the average estimate of 65 cents a share of
eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research Inc. Dean
Witter rose 7/8 to 38 in late afternoon trading of 781,400 shares,
more than the three-month daily average of 692,300.
<p>
   ``The earnings were very strong,'' said analyst Michael
Freudenstein, who follows financial companies for J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
``Each of their lines of business performed well.''
<p>
   Net income at Dean Witter Reynolds, the third-largest U.S.
securities firm in terms of brokers, rose 8.8 percent to $126
million from $115.8 million a year earlier, an increase of 5.9
percent from the third quarter.
<p>
   Asset management and administration fees, which increased 16
percent to $299.3 million, led the securities unit's performance.
Investment banking revenue jumped 60 percent to $78.1 million amid
a rally in the stock and bond markets.
<p>
   ``We continued to achieve rapid growth in assets under
management,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Philip J. Purcell said
in a statement.
<p>
   Assets under management and administration rose 13 percent to
$90 billion from the year-ago period. Trading revenue declined 1.9
percent to $108.9 million.
<p>
   Net operating revenue at the securities unit rose 11 percent to
$879 million.
<p>
   In December, Dean Witter announced an agreement to buy Lombard
Securities, an on-line brokerage based in San Francisco.
<p>
   Discover card earnings rose 63 percent to $101.8 million from
$62.3 million a year earlier. The rise came even as the company
increased its provisions for loan losses by 53 percent to $636
million.
<p>
   ``Revenues from their credit card services were very high,''
said analyst Mark Alpert at Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons Inc. ``They priced a
lot of their accounts in terms of annual percentage rates and late
fees, which more than offset the rise in write-offs.''
<p>
   Merchant and cardmember fees, on a managed loan basis, rose 48
percent to a record $563.8 million from a year earlier, boosted by
higher transaction volume.
<p>
   The firm increased the penalties it charges for late payments
and spending over credit limits, a spokeswoman said.
<p>
   The loss, or net charge-off, rate for managed loans in credit
services rose to 6 percent from 4.4 percent in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   ``Our fourth-quarter results were exceptionally strong given the
industry-wide trend of higher credit card write-offs,'' said
Purcell.
<p>
   Discover net operating revenue rose 14 percent to $735.9
million.
<p>
   For the full year, Dean Witter Discover net income rose 11
percent to $951.4 million, or $2.79 a share, from $856.4 million,
or $2.44 in 1995.
<p>
   Total expenses, excluding interest, increased 9.8 percent to
$1.25 billion, led by a 13 percent rise in payroll costs.
<p>
   Compensation expenses rose 13 percent to $427.1 million at Dean
Witter Reynolds and rose 11 percent to $132.1 million at the credit
card unit.
<p>
   Marketing and business development expenses also contributed to
increased costs, advancing 13 percent to $253.6 million for the
company as a whole. They rose 89 percent to $43 million at the
brokerage unit and rose 5 percent to $210.8 million at the credit
card division.

<p>
   Wellington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The New Zealand dollar
declined amid concern that Reserve Bank of New Zealand Gov. Don
Brash may say interest rates and the currency are too high.
<p>
   Brash is scheduled to speak later today to the Canterbury
Chamber of Commerce on the central bank's inflation target of zero
to 3 percent.
<p>
   ``It's more than likely he will say that,'' said Tania Pye, a
dealer at Bankers Trust New Zealand, adding that her firm's index
of monetary conditions, which measures the inter-relationship
between the currency and interest rates, is at 127.5 points, above
the central bank's optimum level of 123 points.
<p>
   ``They certainly must be thinking monetary conditions are a
little tight at the moment,'' Pye said.
<p>
   The New Zealand dollar was quoted recently at 70.39 U.S. cents,
compared with 70.55 cents in late domestic trading yesterday. The
currency gained 8.1 percent against its U.S. counterpart last year.
New Zealand 90-day bank bills, the benchmark from which other
interest rates are set were at 7.34 percent, down from 7.36 percent
yesterday.
<p>
   Still, ``any kind of selling (of New Zealand dollars) will be an
opportunity to buy,'' said Richard Koss, economist at New
York-based MFR Inc. whose US$30 million Lexington Ramirez Global
Income Fund invests in New Zealand.
<p>
   Prime Minister Jim Bolger's comments earlier this week that the
government won't intervene to try to push the currency lower were
encouraging, Koss said. ``If he's not going to do anything, it's
hard to see the central bank being somehow more accommodative.''
<p>
   Figures released last week showed inflation at 2.4 percent 4in
1996.
<p>
   The government is under pressure from exporters complaining
about the strength of the currency.

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Peco Energy Co. asked
Pennsylvania's permission to refinance $3.6 billion in long-term
obligations with a new type of bond.
<p>
   The bonds would be backed by fees the utility will collect from
consumers for transmitting electricity after state power sales are
deregulated in 1999.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Peco says its nuclear plant debt and other
long-term obligations would hinder it in a competitive market, and
Pennsylvania has agreed to let utilities prepare for deregulation
by backing the new, lower-cost bonds.
<p>
   Although U.S. utilities are expected to ask for issuance of $50
billion in these asset-backed securities, Peco's request to state
regulators for a specific amount is the nation's first.
<p>
   ``I don't think it will roll smoothly for that reason. There's
no precedent,'' said Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
<p>
   Peco filed this morning with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities
Commission for $3.6 billion in bonds. If the commission approves,
Peco said it may apply for $3.5 billion more. Whether the state or
Peco would issue the bonds has yet to be determined.
<p>
   What Pennsylvania does with Peco's request could set a model for
similar negotiations across the U.S. California plans to issue $5
billion in bonds this year for its three largest electric
companies. Ohio and New York are considering legislation that would
let their state utility commissions help power companies in the
same way.
<p>
   In deciding how much of Peco's long-term obligations can be
refinanced using the bonds, regulators can reject debt or contracts
that it decides were undertaken because of bad business decisions.
<p>
   California already has decided three companies are entitled to
full recovery of their investments in power sources. These include
nuclear plant debt, as well as power supply contracts that
utilities had to sign with other generators because of federal law.
<p>
   California's Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank will
issue $5 billion of the bonds this year. State law lets the bank
have as much as $10 billion in these bonds outstanding.
<p>
   San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co. each estimate borrowing about $2 billion from
this issue. San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric Co. expects to borrow about
$500 million.
<p>
   In California and Pennsylvania, the new debt will be backed with
the guarantee of money from what consumers will pay for electricity
delivery.
<p>
   In a deregulated power market, consumers will be able to choose
power suppliers other than their tradition utility. However,
electricity will still be moved using utilities' existing power
lines and transmission equipment, and consumers will pay delivery
fees to their local utility, regardless of who supplies their
power. The new bonds will be backed by those delivery fees.
California says the new bonds will help it cut consumers' electric
bills 10 percent by next year. Peco said its customers would see
rates drop 2.9 percent if it gets approval to issue the $3.6
billion in bonds.
<p>
   The state plans to help utilities refinance their debt have
eased some investors' concerns about deregulation, said Gregory
Phelps, portfolio manager for John Hancock Advisers' Patriot Fund,
which holds 100,000 Peco shares.
<p>
   Utilities and investors once feared companies would be left with
billions in debt that would leave them unable to compete with new
suppliers. California and Pennsylvania, among the leading states in
deregulation, have agreed to let utilities refinance much, if not
all, of these obligations.
<p>
   Still, Peco's ability to compete in a competitive power market
isn't assured, Phelps said. Peco's rates are double the U.S.
average. ``There are a lot of disgruntled customers,'' he said.
``It's too early to tell how many will switch'' to a new supplier.

   Electricity is essential to our daily existence. We use it to
light homes, run motors and power our communication devices. It is
a powerful source of energy, but it can be dangerous unless it is
properly controlled.
<p>
   Control goes beyond power generation and transmission.
Electrical components must be designed and manufactured to handle
current loads without overheating or shorting out, but even the
best components can malfunction if not installed properly. 
<p>
   The government does not regulate manufacturing specifications;
instead manufacturers submit samples of their products to the
Underwriters Laboratories for quality control. The Underwriters
Laboratories are a group of independent laboratories sponsored
jointly by manufacturers, insurance companies and other interested
parties.
<p>
   Products tested must meet minimum standards to be approved by
the Underwriters. All approved products are registered on the
approved list and may carry the Underwriters seal.
<p>
   All items must be clearly marked with a seal or initials and a
code so that field inspectors may identify the manufacturer by
referring to the Underwriters list. If there is any question about
a device that you intend to buy or install, you can write to the
Underwriters Laboratories at 333 Pfingsten Road, Northbrook, Ill.
60062-2096, to see if the item has been tested by them.
<p>
   It is worth noting that the approval rating simply means that an
item has been tested and meets the Underwriters minimum safety
requirements. Similar components may not be of the same quality
even though they both carry the Underwriters seal.
<p>
   Also the Underwriters seal guarantees that the product is safe
only when used for the purpose for which it was designed. A length
of lamp cord is adequate for wiring lamps and extension cords, but
not for permanent wiring in a circuit. Neither the Underwriters
seals not the approved list can be used as an adequate guide to the
proper installation of a product.
<p>
   Comprehensive installation procedures are spelled out in the
National Electrical Code. The code is not intended as a manual of
instruction for untrained people, but it does outline safe wiring
methods with the proper materials to use to safeguard people and
property from hazards. The code is updated every three years to
keep up with new materials and standards.
<p>
   Copies are available from the National Fire Protection
Association, 1 Battery March Park, Quincy, Mass. 02269-9101. (Most
libraries also carry a copy of the code, but not necessarily the
most current version.) Do-it-yourselfers may find the code
technical and difficult to read, but fortunately some home centers
sell booklets containing the basics of the code written in more
accessible terminology. In Canada, the Canadian Electrical Code
serves the same purpose as the American National Electrical Code.
<p>
   Neither the Underwriters specifications nor the code carry the
weight of law, but most states and municipalities enact legislation
that requires all electrical wiring to be in accordance with the
code's guidelines, using products approved by the Underwriters
Laboratories. In addition, these local codes or ordinances often
supplement the National Electrical Code with additions or
restrictions that are applicable to the area. The code, for
example, sanctions the use of armored cable in most electrical
circuits, but it may be prohibited by local code.
<p>
   Local codes are usually quite specific about who may or may not
install or repair electrical wiring. Some codes, particularly in
large urban areas, require that all electrical work be done by a
licensed electrician. Other codes allow do-it-yourselfers to wire
circuits as long as a licensed electrician inspects the job and
makes the final hookup to the service panel. It's important for the
homeowner to consult with the local building department before
attempting to install new wiring or add to existing circuits.
<p>
   Strict application of the codes will result in electrical work
that is safe, but it may not be the most efficient or economical
wiring. Do-it-yourselfers should also consult other sources (e.g.
books on the principles of electrical wiring) when designing
circuits.
<p>
   Local authorities are able to monitor modifications in home
construction and wiring by requiring the homeowner to get a permit
before starting a job. As part of the application process, the
homeowner may have to submit a written description with sketches of
the project; and in some communities, he may be required to take a
simple electrical proficiency test to demonstrate his knowledge of
basic electrical circuits.
<p>
   In addition, he will also have to schedule a visit by the local
electrical inspector. With simple jobs, the inspector will usually
examine the circuit after the work is completed. For larger
projects, the inspector may want to visit the site periodically and
check on the work as it progresses.
<p>
   In general, most electrical inspectors are also available to
answer questions about materials and hookup procedures. They would
prefer to suggest the correct materials to use, rather than reject
a job that was installed with inferior products.The
do-it-yourselfer can avoid making costly mistakes by consulting
with the electrical inspector before beginning an installation.
<p>
   Even if you're not planning to install new wiring or add to
existing circuits, there are still valid reasons for knowing the
safety standards outlined in the electrical codes. You will be in a
better position to evaluate the quality of the wiring in your home
and spot potential hazards. If you are planning to buy another
home, you can inspect the wiring yourself and identify possible
code violations or substandard materials.

 &UR; EATON VANCE LOOKS TO MAKE ACQUISITION: BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   Boston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Eaton Vance Corp. wants to buy
another fund management company, said James Hawkes, the company's
chief executive.
<p>
   ``We would look for a firm as an acquisition that might
complement Eaton Vance's investment management capabilities,''
Hawkes told the Bloomberg Forum.
<p>
   Eaton Vance has the financial resources to make a purchase. The
Boston-based company has more than $115 million in cash and
short-term investments, plus a credit facility of $75 million, that
could be used to make an acquisition.
<p>
   ``In the last 12 to 18 months, we have been looking for a firm
and we've not yet found the right one,'' Hawkes said.
<p>
   All signs are pointing to Eaton Vance buying a fund manager that
specializes in stocks. It's an area of the business where Eaton
Vance wants to get stronger.
<p>
   Eaton Vance is best known as a manager of municipal bond funds,
which account for about 46 percent of the company's $17.6 billion
in assets under management.
<p>
   The company has taken steps in recent years to broaden its
equity fund lineup. Eaton Vance's equity fund assets increased 30
percent in the 12-month period ended Oct. 31 to $3.1 billion.
<p>
   Eaton Vance now offers 13 stock fund portfolios, up from nine in
the past 12 months. Eaton Vance would like to market more small
company stock funds, as well as funds that use computer-generated
quantitative models to pick stocks, Hawkes said.
<p>
   ``If we found a manager that had a strong record (in one of
these areas), we would consider adding that to the Eaton Vance
stable,'' he said.
<p>
   An obstacle to making an acquisition is the relative high price
that money managers can demand in this heady market, Hawkes said.
``One of the reasons we've been at this for 18 months and haven't
found the right company to acquire is simply issues of what you get
relative to what you pay,'' he said.
<p>
   An unsolicited offer for Eaton Vance would likely be rejected. A
group of five senior managers, including Hawkes and Chairman Landon
T. Clay, control Eaton Vance's voting stock in a trust, making an
unfriendly acquisition of the company almost impossible.
<p>
   Eaton Vance has no plans of selling itself. The company ranks
No. 30 of about 550 companies in terms of mutual fund assets,
Hawkes said. ``We can effectively compete,'' he said.
<p>
   Eaton Vance's stock was a high flier over the past 12 months,
rising almost 75 percent on a total return basis. That's more than
double what the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index gained.
<p>
   Still, Eaton Vance's stock is inexpensive relative to other fund
managers, Hawkes said. The stock trades at about 11 times what the
company earning in the 12-month period ended Oct. 31.
<p>
   That ratio is about half of where the benchmark S&AMP;P 500 is
trading, Hawkes said. Eaton Vance's stock was down 3/8 at 45 5/8 in
recent trading.
<p>
   Eaton Vance is one of the oldest investment firms. It dates to
1924 when Charles F. Eaton and John G. Howard founded a firm called
Eaton &AMP; Howard in Boston. It's been here ever since.

<p>
   Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Compaq Computer Corp.'s
fourth-quarter earnings rose 43 percent, far exceeding estimates,
on increased sales of computers to corporate customers and
improvements in operating efficiency.
<p>
   The No. 1 personal computer and server maker said net income
rose to $462 million, or $1.64 a share, from year-earlier profit
from operations of $323 million, or $1.17. Revenue rose 15 percent
to $5.42 billion from $4.7 billion.
<p>
   Compaq's results exceeded all but the most-optimistic forecasts,
demonstrating the increasing strength of personal computer makers
as companies shift from mainframe computers to networks of PCs.
Compaq shares jumped 4 3/4, or 6 percent, to 83 1/4 on trading of
8.2 million, more than twice the three-month daily average of 3
million.
<p>
   ``They're gaining market share, profit margins are increasing,
cash is growing, what else do you want?'' said Stephen Dube, an
analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities.
<p>
   Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.53 a share, based on
the average estimate of 34 analysts from First Call. Many analysts
had increased their unofficial forecasts to about $1.60 in recent
weeks.
<p>
   Compaq led some other computer makers' shares higher, with Dell
Computer Corp.'s stock rising 2 to 66 1/8.
<p>
   However, shares of International Business Machines Corp., whose
earnings were hurt by lagging mainframe sales, fell 10 1/8 to 157
7/8.
<p>
   Houston-based Compaq said its closely watched gross margin ---
revenue minus the cost of manufacturing computers -- rose to 24.4
percent, its highest level in almost two years.
<p>
   Compaq cited a shift toward corporate computers and servers,
which carry higher profit margins, as well as aggressive moves to
cut inventory and speed up collection of payments.
<p>
   The company slashed inventory almost in half to $1.15 billion
from $2.16 billion in the year-earlier period, said Compaq Chief
Financial Officer Earl Mason.
<p>
   Days sales outstanding, a measure of how long Compaq takes to
collect its bills, fell to 53 from 60. Those moves helped Compaq
reduce the amount of money tied up in inventory and receivables and
boost cash to $4 billion from $745 million in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   ``Our people got to some of the inventory goals about a year
ahead of schedule,'' said Mason, who joined Compaq from Inland
Steel Industries Inc. in May.
<p>
   Mason said Compaq will continue to report higher earnings and
profit margins this year than in 1996, although he declined to say
whether the company will exceed its fourth-quarter gross margin of
24.4 percent.
<p>
   Compaq won't be able to trim inventory as much this year as it
did in 1996, Mason acknowledged. He said the bulk of gains in
profitability will come from a shift toward so-called enterprise,
or large corporate computer, systems.
<p>
   ``As the enterprise business becomes more of our overall revenue
stream, the mix alone brings up gross margins,'' Mason said.
<p>
   Compaq's profitability has been bolstered by new products,
including a line of workstations aimed at engineers and financial
professionals. Compaq also has acquired several companies that make
systems to link computers in networks, so it can sell entire
computer systems and not just desktop PCs.
<p>
   Selling, general and administrative expense rose to 10.6 percent
of revenue in the fourth quarter from about 10 percent in the
year-earlier period.
<p>
   Research and development expense increased to about 1.9 percent
from 1.7 percent, Compaq said. The company made up for those
increases by trimming inventory and better managing the flow of
products through the manufacturing and selling process.
<p>
   For the year, Houston-based Compaq reported net income of $1.31
billion, or $4.66 a share, compared with profit from operations of
$1.03 billion, or $3.74 a share.
<p>
   Compaq reported 1995 net income of $789 million, or $2.88 a
jI2sSrlblshare, after acquisition-related charges.  &LR; , h Revenue
increased 23 percent to $18.11 billion from $14.76 billion.

<p>
   Bogota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International phone companies in
Colombia said the country will probably delay the opening of the
long-distance phone market at least until next year, a year later
than originally planned.
<p>
   Phone companies blame the delay on concerns expressed by workers
at the state-owned phone company, which would have to cut jobs to
compete with the foreign competitors.
<p>
   Colombia initially planned to offer foreign companies the right
to offer phone service beginning in March. The date was then pushed
back to August. Next year is more likely now, the phone companies
said.
<p>
   ``We have the impression it won't happen this year,'' said
Sergio Martinez, executive president of the Colombian Information
and Telecommunications Association, an industry group of 31 foreign
telecommunications companies.
<p>
   ``There is strong suspicion it won't happen during this
administration,'' which ends in August 1998, Martinez said.
<p>
   Colombian officials say they will hire a group of experts this
month to conduct a study on the impact of the opening of the phone
market. This is to be followed by a conference on the matter this
year, though no date has been set. The official plan is still to
open the market to two foreign operators this year, a spokeswoman
for the Communications Ministry said.
<p>
   The government postponed the opening of the market in part
because of demands from the unions at Telecom, the state phone
company. Telecom has a monopoly on long-distance phone service. The
plan calls for two foreign operators to compete with Telecom.
<p>
   The Telecom workers want the company to have more time to get
ready for competition.
<p>
   The phone concessions will be for 10 years, exclusive for seven
years. The minimum price is $150 million, though Colombia is hoping
an auction among various bidders will push the price to $200
million to $250 million.
<p>
   At least two groups appear firm in their plans to bid on the
service, government officials have said.
<p>
   The groups include Sprint Corp., Deutsche Telecom and France
Telecom with Colombian industrial group Santo Domingo and local
phone companies in Medellin and Cali.
<p>
   The other group consists of MCI Corp., Bell Canada
International, El Tiempo newspaper, the Bogota phone company and
the Sarmiento Angulo industrial group.
<p>
   Telefonica of Spain, Korea Telecom and STET of Italy have also
expressed interest.
<p>
   The long-distance phone market, worth about $900 million in
1995, is expected to grow at a rate of 8.5 percent a year for the
rest of the decade.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy continues to
grow with low unemployment nudging labor costs higher, the Federal
Reserve said today.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for
higher wages in its latest regional economic survey, the central
bank still found no evidence of accelerating consumer prices
outside of energy in December or early January.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published
eight times each year. The report will help form the basis for
discussion on interest rate targets at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the
Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
<p>
   ``Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in
most parts of the country,'' the Fed said in its report. ``Holiday
sales were in line with retailers' expectations of moderate growth.
Manufacturing activity continued to grow, with significant strength
coming from capital equipment and materials manufacturers.''
<p>
   The report is likely to be ``comforting'' for investors, said
James Padinha, an economist at MMS International in San Francisco,
because it doesn't point to wage pressures or other worrisome signs
of inflation.
<p>
   In financial markets, though, the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond fell after the government's auction of about $17 billion in
two-year notes. The bond fell 1/2, pushing up the yield more than 4
basis points to 6.82 percent, as dealers tried to sell their
holdings of the new government securities.
<p>
   While release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Washington
time, it was inadvertently released at 12:10 p.m. on the Internet
by the Fed. ``Everybody has broken an embargo, including me,''
joked the Fed's chief spokesman, Joseph Coyne. News agencies
occasionally release stories about government reports before their
scheduled release times because of unintentional computer glitches.
<p>
   The latest Fed regional survey, compiled by the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, is in line with comments yesterday by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the U.S. economy remains strong
with few signs of immediate inflationary pressures even as an era
of low wage gains may be ending.
<p>
   In the Fed's New York district, for example, the economy had a
``slightly firmer tone than in the last report, while price
pressures remain subdued,'' the Fed said.
<p>
   In the country's mid-section, the Kansas City Fed said rising
job creation is beginning to put upward pressure on wages,
something Fed officials have been warning about as a risk to the
nation's inflation outlook.
<p>
   Along the Pacific coast, the San Francisco Fed reported
retailers enjoyed a ``good'' holiday selling season, though adverse
weather in late December and early January ``held down
post-Christmas retail activity.''
<p>
   In his testimony yesterday, Greenspan said, ``the economy has
retained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and
inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions.'' He
added: ``By some important measures of price trends, inflation
actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   Economists interpreted Greenspan's comments as suggesting the
FOMC won't raise interest rates next month. Still, Greenspan left
the door ajar for action later if inflation accelerates because of
rising wage levels.
<p>
   The overall consumer price index rose 3.3 percent last year, the
largest increase since 1990. However, much of that came from an 8.6
percent rise in energy prices. Not counting food and energy, prices
rose only 2.6 percent, tying the 1994 rate for the lowest core
inflation rate in 30 years.

<p>
   Bogota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International phone companies in
Colombia said the country will probably delay the opening of the
long-distance phone market at least until next year, a year later
than originally planned.
<p>
   Phone companies blame the delay on concerns expressed by workers
at the state-owned phone company, which would have to cut jobs to
compete with the foreign competitors.
<p>
   Colombia initially planned to offer foreign companies the right
to offer phone service beginning in March. The date was then pushed
back to August. Next year is more likely now, the phone companies
said.
<p>
   ``We have the impression it won't happen this year,'' said
Sergio Martinez, executive president of the Colombian Information
and Telecommunications Association, an industry group of 31 foreign
telecommunications companies.
<p>
   ``There is strong suspicion it won't happen during this
administration,'' which ends in August 1998, Martinez said.
<p>
   Colombian officials say they will hire a group of experts this
month to conduct a study on the impact of the opening of the phone
market. This is to be followed by a conference on the matter this
year, though no date has been set. The official plan is still to
open the market to two foreign operators this year, a spokeswoman
for the Communications Ministry said.
<p>
   The government postponed the opening of the market in part
because of demands from the unions at Telecom, the state phone
company. Telecom has a monopoly on long-distance phone service. The
plan calls for two foreign operators to compete with Telecom.
<p>
   The Telecom workers want the company to have more time to get
ready for competition.
<p>
   The phone concessions will be for 10 years, exclusive for seven
years. The minimum price is $150 million, though Colombia is hoping
an auction among various bidders will push the price to $200
million to $250 million.
<p>
   At least two groups appear firm in their plans to bid on the
service, government officials have said.
<p>
   The groups include Sprint Corp., Deutsche Telecom and France
Telecom with Colombian industrial group Santo Domingo and local
phone companies in Medellin and Cali.
<p>
   The other group consists of MCI Corp., Bell Canada
International, El Tiempo newspaper, the Bogota phone company and
the Sarmiento Angulo industrial group.
<p>
   Telefonica of Spain, Korea Telecom and STET of Italy have also
expressed interest.
<p>
   The long-distance phone market, worth about $900 million in
1995, is expected to grow at a rate of 8.5 percent a year for the
rest of the decade.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Exco Plc won a $1.15 million
ruling against Cantor Fitzgerald &AMP; Co. for payments owed by five
brokers who quit its broker-dealer unit to join Cantor.
<p>
   The ruling was handed down Jan. 8 by New York State Supreme
Judge Leland DeGrasse. It follows a $4.6 million verdict Exco won
in November against Cantor for hiring away interest-rate options
traders from its Noonan, Astley &AMP; Pearce unit.
<p>
   Exco's RMJ Securities Corp. unit sued Cantor in 1994 and 1995 to
collect money that five former brokers agreed to pay if they left
the firm before their contracts expired.
<p>
   ``The payout provisions are a reasonable means to provide RMJ
just compensation for its losses upon the contract defendants'
departure,'' DeGrasse said in his ruling.
<p>
   Cantor, which claimed the payments are illegal, is responsible
for the costs because it agreed to take legal responsibility for
the brokers after hiring them, RMJ attorney John Cambria said.
<p>
   Glen Kirwin, a senior broker at RMJ, agreed to pay $100,000 if
he left the firm before December 1996; Louis Spinelli, another
senior broker, agreed to pay $150,000 if he left before January
1997; William Minardi, a managing director, agreed to pay $350,000
if he left before December 1995; Gerald Byrne, a broker, agreed to
pay $200,000 if he left before December 1995; and Mark Colaio, head
of RMJ's government-agency securities desk, agreed to pay $350,000
if he left before August 1996, according to the ruling.
<p>
   Cambria said London-based Exco is seeking additional damages
against Cantor for business it says it lost from the brokers'
departure. RMJ, based in New York, deals in U.S. government
securities.
<p>
   Officials at Cantor weren't immediately available for comment.

<p>
   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Bond investors around the
world lined up to lend Argentina $2 billion today at
lower-than-expected interest rates, helping the nation finance its
growing national debt.
<p>
   The country sold 20-year global bonds at a yield of 11.375
percent, or 462.5 basis points more than U.S. government debt.
That's better than the 500 basis point difference underwriter
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. expected less than a week ago.
<p>
   Brisk demand for the country's debt suggests investors are
confident that Argentina, a nation that suffered from economic
stagnation and hyperinflation during much of the 1970s and 1980s,
will be able to pay lenders 20 years from now.
<p>
   Bond investors, faced with low yields and high prices in many
other parts of the world, ``have got to buy high-yield and emerging
markets debt,'' said Carl Ericson, head of $6 billion in taxable
fixed income at Colonial Advisory Services in Boston. Argentina has
``to make hay while the sun shines.''
<p>
   Underwriters said they'd received $8 billion in bids for the new
securities by the end of yesterday, three times as much as they
needed to sell. Argentina plans to raise the bulk of the $8.5
billion it needs to borrow in foreign markets this year by the end
of the first quarter.
<p>
   ``The government is being very shrewd in bringing forward its
funding, raising as much as possible,'' said Norberto Rosas, an
economist at Argentine consulting firm Proeco. ``It's covering
itself against a possible change in world financial market
conditions later in the year.''
<p>
   The global securities are sold simultaneously around the world
and traded around the clock. Demand for the bonds was so brisk that
the government scrapped its original plan to split the sale between
five-year debt and 20-year debt.
<p>
   Argentina was able to persuade investors to accept a lower yield
in part because they have little choice. Yields of many other bonds
have declined and investors are scouring the globe for high-yield
securities.
<p>
   Argentina's new debt still offers more yield than some of the
alternatives. The new debt yields more than the high-yield,
high-risk ``junk'' debt of some U.S. companies. The 8.25 percent
bonds of Kmart Corp., the U.S. retailer, recently yielded 313 basis
points more than Treasuries. The bonds, which mature in 2022, carry
a rating similar to Argentina.
<p>
   The country's 10-year debt yields about 370 basis points more
than U.S. government debt. The higher borrowing rate on the 20-year
securities gives investors an extra cushion, and ``takes into
account some chance that things will go badly,'' said Luis Luis, a
principal at Scudder Stevens &AMP; Clark that manages $1.75 billion in
Latin America debt.
<p>
   Still, Argentina's Par Brady bonds also offer investors the
chance to buy into the country, and they're backed in part by U.S.
Treasury securities. The Brady bonds yield 549 basis points more
than U.S. government debt.
<p>
   Yet Argentina was able to garner a lower yield at today's sale,
taking advantage of current low interest rates and growing investor
confidence in the country. In March, it plans to sell another $1
billion of bonds.
<p>
   This year, $10.2 billion of Argentina's debt comes due. Another
$10 billion matures in 1998, while in 1999 the sum rises to $11.6
billion, according to Fundacion Capital, an economic research firm.
<p>
   At the moment, the signs for Argentina's economy and the
nation's ability to manage its $100 billion debt, seem good.
<p>
   The economy is set to expand by about 5 percent this year
following 4 percent growth in 1996, according to government
officials and private economists.
<p>
   Inflation, once the nemesis of the economy, has been tamed. In
1996, retail prices rose by just 0.05 percent. Its inflation rate
was among the lowest in the world.
<p>
   Yet all is not rosy. The unemployment rate is 17 percent, and
the government hasn't been able to balance its budget.
<p>
   What's more, the chances for political change after President
Carlos Menem steps down in 1999 may also raise the risk that his
economic program will be scrapped. Concerns that Argentina will
fall into another period of high inflation and slow growth stopped
some investors from making a long-term commitment to the country.
<p>
   ''It was a far different country 20-years ago than it is today,
and I can't predict what the country will look like 20-years from
now,'' said Edwin Ferrell, who helps manage $3.2 billion for the
Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa. ``It's a leap of
faith.''
<p>
   Still, it appears that's a leap many investors are willing to
make.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Penthouse magazine won a court
order allowing it to sell sexually explicit magazines and videos in
military-run stores at bases and on ships worldwide.
<p>
   U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York granted
Penthouse owner General Media Communications Inc. and several
publishing and entertainment trade groups a preliminary injunction
that lifts a recent ban on the sales.
<p>
   The judge said the ban violates the First Amendment rights of
the publisher and others, and was unconstitutionally vague. Sales
of ``lascivious'' material that elicit a sexual response were
banned by the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996.
<p>
   The judge ``has just given the First Amendment a new spitshine
by rejecting the bloated Military Honor and Decency Act as
unconstitutional,'' Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione said in a
statement.
<p>
   Pentagon spokesman Michael Doubleday said the military is
considering whether to appeal.
<p>
   The preliminary injunction replaces a temporary restraining
order Scheindlin had imposed against the military on Dec. 20.
``Sexually explicit material cannot be banned from sale or rental
at military exchanges merely because it is offensive,'' Scheindlin
wrote in a ruling issued today.
<p>
   She rejected the U.S. Defense Department's argument that the ban
would erode the military's core values of honor, courage and
commitment.
<p>
   The ban was to take effect last Dec. 22 after President Clinton
signed the decency act, which was included in the fiscal year 1997
military spending bill. Backed by several conservative Congressmen,
the law was passed in Congress without debate.
<p>
   Penthouse says it is the third-most popular magazine sold on
military exchanges. The decency act didn't ban the sale of sexually
explicit material in private stores in military bases.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Winona, Minnesota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Fastenal Co.
shareholders aren't the only ones nervous about the company's
fourth-quarter earnings report due Friday.
<p>
   Short-sellers -- speculators who sold borrowed shares in the
hope of buying them back at a lower price -- may have more at
stake.
<p>
   They've sold short almost 4 million shares in a gamble that the
fast-growing distributor of nuts, bolts and other industrial
supplies, which has come up short of Wall Street earnings estimates
in the last two quarters, will again miss forecasts. That, they
hope, might finally deflate Fastenal's sky-high stock price of more
than 50 times estimated 1997 earnings.
<p>
   On the other side of the bet is the big mutual fund company
Janus Capital Corp., which stuffed its funds with $187 million in
Fastenal stock last summer.
<p>
   Janus officials wouldn't discuss Fastenal. But analyst Judith
Scott of Robert Baird &AMP; Co. thinks Janus will win this chapter of a
long-running battle between Fastenal's bulls and bears.
<p>
   ``Every year of its history there's been somebody who really
liked the stock and was willing to buy it at any price and made a
ton of money doing it,'' she said.
<p>
   The Winona, Minnesota, company has done plenty to confound its
critics. Earnings increased at a 35 percent annual rate in the five
years ended Dec. 30, 1995. Even with last year's earnings
disappointments, Scott said she thinks the company will end the
year with earnings of about 88 cents a share, more than 20 percent
above 1995.
<p>
   Adjusted for splits, Fastenal shares have soared more than
60-fold since the initial offering in 1987. The stock recently
traded at about 47. And while Fastenal is expensive compared with
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which has a price-to-earnings
ratio of 22, that's nothing new: The company's shares have traded
at an average of more than 50 times per-share earnings since 1993.
<p>
   Fastenal's performance is driven by a furious increase in sales
as it opens stores and adds new products. While it resembles a
wholesale distributor -- its stores tend to be in dingy industrial
areas, and a $10 minimum purchase discourages retail customers --
Fastenal's gross margins resemble Tiffany &AMP; Co. at more than 50
percent.
<p>
   Revenue soared to an estimated $300 million in 1996 from $20.3
million in 1987. Fastenal founder and Chief Executive Robert
Kierlin thinks growth will accelerate as the company starts
offering everything from janitorial supplies to cutting tools.
<p>
   ``We're hoping the economy stays reasonably strong and we'll be
able to put out 40 percent revenue growth in 1997,'' he said. ``It
should get better after that.''
<p>
   Such projections enrage short-sellers, who faced with
embarrassing losses decline to be quoted by name. They say the
company's vaunted growth rate is slowing, not accelerating. Indeed,
net income, which rose 57 percent in 1994 is expected to be up just
22 percent for 1996.
<p>
   And while revenue rose 28 percent to $210 million in the nine
months ended Sept. 30, revenue at stores open two years or more
rose only 20 percent, half the rate reported in 1995.
<p>
   Signs of slowing growth has short sellers speculating that
sooner or later, Fastenal shares will plunge. Short interest in the
stock has hung at about 4 million shares since August, representing
more than 14 percent of the float, or 27 million shares available
for trading. So many shares are sold short that it would take more
than 30 days of average trading in the stock for bearish
speculators to buy back all the shares they need to return to
brokers.
<p>
   Some short-sellers even say Janus propped up Fastenal shares
last year, when it reported disappointing earnings. The fund bought
3.88 million shares between March 30 and Sept. 30, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, making Fastenal the
largest single holding in the $728 million Janus Enterprise Fund at
8.4 percent of assets.
<p>
   During that period, short-sellers say, some 30 million Fastenal
shares changed hands. Cutting the total in half to eliminate the
double-counting that analysts say is common in transactions on the
Nasdaq exchange, Janus represented a quarter of the trading in that
period.
<p>
   Janus just took advantage of the earnings disappointments to
assemble its stake, said analyst Scott of Baird &AMP; Co. Fastenal's
earnings were constrained last year, she said, because the company
boosted its work force by 40 percent to more than 3,000 to staff
promising new businesses.
<p>
   ``The reason they've missed numbers is the expenses of these
personnel,'' Scott said. ``They will get the payoff next year.''
<p>
   Kierlin certainly thinks so. He sees more growth potential in
businesses like janitorial services than in sticking with nuts and
bolts.
<p>
   ``The fastener business is $6 billion at wholesale, and we could
aspire to maybe 20 percent of the market,'' he said. ``Industrial
maintenance represents a $60 billion market.''
<p>
   So far, Kierlin has been right, watching an investment that
began with a single store in 1968 balloon to a market value of $219
million.
<p>
   Scott said many of the people who've bet against Fastenal over
the years -- commentator Dan Dorfman twice suggested in 1994 that
its shares would tumble, when in fact they more than doubled -- did
so on the misperception that the company competes with retail
hardware chains such as Home Depot Inc.
<p>
   In fact, Fastenal sells almost exclusively to commercial
customers. That hasn't stopped critics who look at the company's
expensive stock and conclude it's ready for a fall.
<p>
   These hopeful pessimists have waited a long time, but at some
point they may no choice but to say uncle.

   Q. Where can I go in the New York area to learn more about
gardening?
<p>
   A. Winter is the time to peruse not just seed catalogues, but
also the catalogues that can help grow your gardening skills and
plant new ideas.
<p>
   Whether you are a basic gardener looking for a morning full of
help or a professional (or soon-to-be-professional) looking for
certification, the New York area has what you want.
<p>
   Interested in establishing a native wildflower garden? Have a
desire to keep bees in the city? (Your neighbors will love it.)
Suffer from fear of pruning? Want to know about grafting? (It's not
a solution for pruning mistakes  &MD;  better take both.) Have a garden
near the ocean, one in shade, or one that came with your historic
house and needs a little restoration? Want the chance to tour
private or public gardens with someone who can answer your
questions?
<p>
   All of these winter and spring offerings and more can be found
at the centers listed here.
<p>
   Renowned horticultural authors and professionals who practice
what they teach are at your command for as little as a few hours or
as much as six weeks. And everything they do is bound to make you
and your garden smarter, prettier and maybe even thinner.
<p>

<p>
   DUBLIN, Ireland  &MD;  At last year's Sundance Film Festival in Utah,
one Australian film, ``Shine,'' became a sensation in the Premiere
section and had two distributors battling over it. Meanwhile,
another Australian film, ``Angel Baby,'' languished in the almost
invisible World Cinema section.
<p>
   ``Angel Baby'' did not get an American distributor at the
festival and was proclaimed by Caryn James in The New York Times as
``the Sundance film most in need of rescue.''
<p>
   It has been rescued indeed. The film, about two schizophrenics
in love, opened in New York on Friday and has been gladly received
by critics, many of whom heaped praise on the film's leading man,
John Lynch.
<p>
   In addition, Lynch has appeared in a small part as Bobby Sands,
the Irish Republican Army hunger striker, in ``Some Mother's Son,''
which opened in the United States in December. He also stars as a
single father in ``Nothing Personal,'' a film opening in March and
set during an uneasy cease-fire in Northern Ireland in 1975.
<p>
   ``John Lynch is a very intelligent actor who always brings a big
commitment, a great intensity, to the part,'' says Jim Sheridan,
who directed him in ``In the Name of the Father'' and was a
co-writer and co-producer of ``Some Mother's Son.''
<p>
   ``John's honest, and you always believe him on screen,'' he
says. ``He's Ireland's best young actor.''
<p>
   In the intimate drama ``Angel Baby,'' Lynch and Jacqueline
McKenzie play a couple who meet at a psychiatric treatment center
in Melbourne and fall in love. When the young woman becomes
pregnant, the two decide to stop taking their antipsychotic
medications. Then the doctors advise that the pregnancy is too
risky for her and her child, and the lovers' are faced with a
battle that severely tests their relationship.
<p>
   It is a tribute to the power of his performance in ``Angel
Baby'' that when the film swept the 1995 Australian Film Awards,
Lynch was also named best actor, an accolade generally reserved for
Australians.
<p>
   ``I never expected to win that award,'' says the modest,
quiet-spoken Lynch, sitting in the Shelbourne Hotel here. ``Winning
it was a tremendous compliment. It was a tough film to do, very
demanding, but with a lot of wit in it, too. I found the script
extraordinary, very brave. There is such a stigma attached to
schizophrenia. But my character wants a life like everybody else,
and he feels he deserves it.''
<p>
   Michael Rymer, the writer and director of ``Angel Baby,'' says
he tested 30 or 40 talented young actors in Australia before
casting Lynch, who auditioned in London.
<p>
   ``I needed an actor who was soft and vulnerable to play the
lover,'' Rymersays, ``but also someone who had the sense of
darkness and pain to convey a person who has been through the
wringer. After just two takes at John's audition, it was clear he
was a very impressive actor. His ability to improvise and play the
moments, his ability to use his imagination and access a very deep
emotional reality, was undeniable.''
<p>
   Lynch, who is 35, was born in the small rural area of
Corrinshego outside Newry in Northern Ireland. The eldest of the
family's five children, he became immersed in soccer as a schoolboy
and was steered toward acting by Sean Hollywood, an English
teacher. By the time he finished school, Lynch had decided to
pursue acting as a career; he enrolled at the Central School of
Speech and Drama in London.
<p>
   His big break came much earlier than he could have expected.
<p>
   In 1983, as he neared the end of his second year, he was invited
to audition for Pat O'Connor's ``Cal,'' a feature film about a
young man reluctantly involved in the IRA and the murder of a
policeman. He read for O'Connor and a week later was invited back
for a screen test with Helen Mirren, who would play the policeman's
widow. (He was reunited with Ms. Mirren in ``Some Mother's Son,''
in which she stars.) Four weeks later Lynch was offered the title
role in ``Cal.''
<p>
   ``It was very daunting at first,'' he says of being catapulted
into a leading role while still a drama student. ``But I had great
support from Pat O'Connor and all the cast, which made it easier
for me.''
<p>
   He went to the Cannes film festival in 1984 and watched Ms.
Mirren win the best-actress award for ``Cal.'' ``That was crazy,
mad,'' he says. ``I'd never been to a film festival before, and
suddenly I was in this circus in my borrowed tux.''

<p>
   Lynch followed ``Cal'' with five years of work in the theater in
London, including back-to-back, yearlong stints, first as
Konstantin in ``The Seagull'' with Vanessa Redgrave, Jonathan Pryce
and Natasha Richardson, then as Smike in the Royal Shakespeare
Company's production of ``Nicholas Nickleby.''
<p>
   More recently, he has been working on one film after another,
among them ``In the Name of the Father''; Agnieszka Holland's
``Secret Garden''; John Sayles's ``Secret of Roan Inish'' (which
also features his sister, Susan Lynch, who is an actress); Pen
Densham's ``Moll Flanders,'' and two films directed by his
off-screen partner, Mary McGuckian: the W.B. Yeats chamber piece
``Words Upon the Window Pane'' and ``This Is the Sea,'' a romantic
drama coming next summer that is set in Northern Ireland during the
recent IRA cease-fire.
<p>
   For ``Some Mother's Son,'' which was directed by Terry George,
Lynch became almost unrecognizable. He wore latex to make Sands, a
hunger striker and nationalist icon in Northern Ireland, look more
gaunt. The film is set during the devastating 1981 hunger strikes
in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland. Elected a member of
parliament on the 40th day of his hunger strike, Sands died 26 days
later, the first of 10 IRA prisoners to die on strike.
<p>
   Even though his role involved working on the film for just eight
or nine days, he says, the responsibilities were onerous.
<p>
   ``I was hugely apprehensive about the hunger-strike issue in the
film,'' he says. ``There's a great responsibility on film makers
when dealing with a subject such as this.''
<p>
   In ``Nothing Personal,'' he plays a Roman Catholic who, during
the 1975 cease-fire in Northern Ireland, becomes caught up in
violence when he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong
time. What appealed to Lynch about the character, he says, is that
he is ``this small guy who just wants to be in his own small world
in his own small street.''
<p>
   The character is tortured and the scenes were intense, he says,
all the more so because they were shot in the final two days of
filming.
<p>
   Lynch recalls that when preparing for the role, the director,
Thaddeus O'Sullivan, took him and two other actors in the film, Ian
Hart and James Frain, to Belfast for research. This included
spending a night drinking in bars in a staunchly Protestant area,
and O'Sullivan made sure they were accompanied by two Protestant
bodyguards.
<p>
   ``After a while,'' Lynch says, ``I started to get odd looks from
people who recognized me from `Cal' and `In the Name of the
Father,' and eventually one of these young guys took a swing at me.
And this was when the cease-fire was in all its glory.''
<p>
   He has turned down all acting offers since completing ``Some
Mother's Son'' to immerse himself in writing a screenplay on the
Belfast-born soccer idol George Best. Lynch intends to play Best in
the film, ``Let It Bleed,'' which covers a period from the 1960s to
the present.
<p>
   ``In his heyday he was volatile, but a magician on the field,''
Lynch says of Best. ``He's behind the project, although it will be
uncomfortable for him, I'm sure. It has a `Raging Bull' feel to it,
and he's still bleeding.''

<p>
   Kansas City, Missouri, Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- American Century
Investments has a new mutual fund that penalizes investors who
think short-term.
<p>
   American Century's Twentieth Century New Opportunities Fund will
charge extra fees to any investor who pulls money within five years
of buying shares of the fund. That's a concrete incentive for
customers to become the kind of long-term investors the mutual fund
industry has long coveted.
<p>
   The fees equal 2 percent, or $20 per $1,000 withdrawn.
<p>
   ``It's a marketing gimmick designed to get people to invest for
the long term,'' said William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch
Carre, a Boston-based industry consulting firm. ``But, is it fair
or is it extortion?''
<p>
   Officials at Kansas City-based American Century, which used to
be called Twentieth Century Mutual Funds, said the ``2-percent
redemption fee emphasizes our position that investors should have
at least a five-year time horizon,'' said Christopher Doyle, an
American Century spokesman.
<p>
   The Twentieth Century New Opportunities Fund also is designed
for the more wealthy investor.
<p>
   The fund, which opened Jan. 1, is limited to investors who
already have at least $90,000 in assets with the company, Doyle
said. The fund also requires a minimum initial investment of
$10,000, which is above average for U.S. stock funds. The maximum
an investor can put in the fund is $500,000, and the management fee
is 1.5 percent, or $15 per $1,000 invested, he said. The average
management fee for a U.S. stock fund is closer to 1.4 percent.
<p>
   The extra fees will protect existing investors from untimely
redemptions, which could hurt the performance of the fund by
forcing the managers to sell securities they many not want to sell,
Doyle said. All redemptions fees charged would go to the fund
rather than the management company, he said.
<p>
   Investors will also hope to benefit from American Century's fund
management record for its long-term funds. Its Giftrust Investors
Fund, designed for people who want to make a gift in trust, usually
to a child, though it also can be to a charity, requires
investments be held for 10 years.
<p>
   Giftrust, started in late 1983, has assets of about $900
million.
<p>
   Giftrust has a stellar long-term record, even after suffering a
subpar 1996 when the fund gained 5.78 percent, according to
Bloomberg Fund Performance, compared with the 16-percent gain of
the Russell 2000 Index.
<p>
   Giftrust reported annual gains averaging almost 21.78 percent
over the past 10 years, ranking No. 1 of 33 ``small cap growth''
funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
<p>
   American Century saw ``negligible'' shareholder fund withdrawals
during the summer when shares of small-sized companies were
especially volatile, Doyle said. Many of American Century's biggest
funds, including the $20 billion Ultra fund and the $2.2 billion
Vista fund, specialize in investing in these types of companies.
Neither fund charges redemption fees.
<p>
   American Century said it plans to close the New Opportunities
fund to new investors when it reaches $400 million, Doyle said.
Today, the fund has about $19 million in assets.
<p>
   Still, the 2-percent redemption fee and five-year limit are
unique for the fund industry, analysts said. The research group
Morningstar Inc. counts just one other U.S. stock fund that charges
a 2 percent redemption fee.
<p>
   Shareholders who pull assets from Oakmark Small Cap Fund within
six months of having purchased shares must pay a fee equal to 2
percent of assets. The fees are charged to prevent investors from
trying to time swings in the market by buying and selling fund
shares.
<p>
   Thirteen other funds available in the U.S. charge
similarly-sized fees, Morningstar reported. Ten are international
funds and three are ``tax-managed'' funds marketed by Vanguard
Group, according to the research group.
<p>
   ``These fees are designed to make sure people keep their money
invested,'' said Geoff Bobroff, an independent industry consultant
in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. ``If the markets crater, however,
people will run for cover no matter what the fees are.''
<p>
   That's what investors did -- at least for one week -- during
this past summer. Investors pulled about $5 billion from equity
funds in a mid-July week when the U.S. stock market suffered one of
its biggest declines in a decade, according to research groups that
track mutual fund money flows.
<p>
   ``Redemption fees will reduce this friction,'' Bobroff said.
<p>
   Still, it seems odd that someone would want to give his or her
money to American Century and let it sit there for five or 10 years
no matter what happens to the stock market. That takes a lot of
trust. And, now, American Century is rolling out another fund to
test investors' trust.

<p>
   New Orleans, Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Pirates, beware.
<p>
   Squads of National Football League undercover agents will be
prowling the streets of New Orleans during Super Bowl week, looking
for people selling merchandise with unauthorized team logos, the
NFL said.
<p>
   Just as licensed merchandise has become a money machine for
professional sports, bootleggers make big money by selling
T-shirts, caps and other team paraphernalia without paying for the
right to use their logos.
<p>
   ``Counterfeit merchandise is still a big, big problem,'' said
Brian McCarthy, head of corporate communications for NFL Properties
Inc., the league's marketing arm. ``We take protecting our
licensees very seriously. Every product they (the illegal
merchants) sell not only rips off the licensee but also takes money
out of the league's pockets.''
<p>
   Some $10 billion of licensed sports products ranging from
trading cards to toilet seat covers was sold in the U.S. last year.
The NFL accounted for about $3 billion of that with $60 million to
$70 million coming from Super Bowl products. Bootleggers will sell
$1 million of Super Bowl merchandise alone, McCarthy said.
<p>
   Generally, the leagues keep anywhere from 8 to 15 percent of
total wholesale -- $1.5 billion in the NFL's case -- with the rest
going to the licensee.
<p>
   ``Companies spend a great deal of money to become an official
licensee,'' said Mike Nichols, editor and publisher of Team
Licensing Report, a Phoenix-based newsletter. ``If their rights are
not protected, then the license loses its value.''
<p>
   To help protect that value, the NFL, National Basketball
Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, apparel
maker Starter Corp. and others have joined in a coalition called
CAPS -- the Coalition to Advance and Protect Sports Licenses -- to
police the business.
<p>
   The effort to crackdown on bootleg merchandise, pioneered by
such companies as Gucci Group, has worked for professional sports,
Nichols said.
<p>
   ``We are seeing less and less counterfeit merchandise being sold
on the streets of host cities,'' he said.
<p>
   To thwart counterfeiters, the league has designed a special
holograph that must be attached to all officially licensed
products. There are also special tags which are sewn onto the
garments or attached to the other items.
<p>
   ``We prosecute anyone we catch,'' McCarthy said. ``But the major
problem is that the laws aren't really tough enough. Many of these
illegal vendors are back on the streets selling knockoffs as soon
as they are released. And we see the same people at events across
the country. It's a lucrative underground business.''
<p>
   One company that is thankful for such policing efforts is Pro
Player, a division of Fruit of the Loom Inc. The Hudson, New
Hampshire, company owns the rights to produce T-shirts, jackets,
hats and fleece apparel bearing the Green Bay Packers and New
England Patriots logos. Super Sunday has become just that for the
company. ``This is huge, just huge,'' said a company spokesman.
``We came out with our `Squeeze the Cheese' T-shirts at the end of
Sunday's game and the orders have been flooding in.'' The company
said it expect $1 million in revenue from the ``Squeeze'' T-shirts.
Company president Doug Kelly had predicted before last weekend's
league championship games that a Packers Super Bowl victory could
mean additional sales of $6 million to $8 million. A Pats triumph
could bring an additional $5 million in revenue.
<p>
   Back in New Orleans, NFL Properties will be patrolling the
sidelines as well as the streets. The league has agreements with
several companies regarding what apparel and logos can be displayed
on the sidelines during a game. ``We know the attraction to such a
large television audience,'' McCarthy said. ``We want to stop any
attempt at ambush marketing.''

<p>
   New York, Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) -- An investor group said it is
forming a new professional football league to challenge the
National Football League, beginning play in 1998. Wall Street
powerhouse Credit Suisse First Boston is assisting the new All
America Football League as its financial advisor.
<p>
   The AAFL expects to begin play in 12 of the nation's 25 largest
cities. The investor group's leader, Detroit real estate developer
Bernard Glieberman, said he couldn't name the cities or the
stadiums where the teams will play next year.
<p>
   Credit Suisse First Boston, based in New York, declined comment
on the financial details. It's the seventh-largest securities firm
in the U.S. and a unit of Zurich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse
Group.
<p>
   Glieberman said the league will benefit by itself signing
players who would then be drafted the league's teams. He said this
arrangement will minimize the possibility that the teams will
encounter bloated payrolls, a financial hardship that has ruined
other professional sports leagues.
<p>
   Aside from that notion, Glieberman was skimpy on details about
important details. The league expects to begin play with
investments totaling $80 million, but Glieberman declined to
identify the investors or offer details on which networks will
broadcast the games. He didn't say what days the teams would play,
leaving a range of Friday through Monday.
<p>
   Then there is the matter of competing in prestige with the
established and booming National Football League. By holding its
games in the spring, the league will also bump up against the
baseball, basketball and ice hockey seasons in North America.
<p>
   Football analysts said the venture shapes up as a long shot
because the NFL is going through a prosperous period. It has no
labor unrest or strikes. NFL revenues have grown to more than $2.3
billion from $900 million in 1989. The average players' salary has
risen to more than $700,000 from $365,000 in 1990.
<p>
   ``It's hard to challenge the NFL because it's huge, established,
wealthy and it has got everything going for it,'' said Dick Schaap,
a commentator for ESPN and the author of several books about
football.
<p>
   The new league is bullish on its chances of success. Glieberman
said prospective sponsors are ``extremely excited about the way we
are handling this.'' He didn't name any of the sponsors.
<p>
   ``We're very confident that there is a tremendous amount of
football talent,'' said Randy Vataha, a consultant to the new
league and a former NFL player.
<p>
   ``If not for expansion, Mark Brunell would still be a backup
quarterback in the NFL,'' Vataha said, referring to the player who
emerged as a star of the Jacksonville Jaguars this year in the
team's second season in the NFL.
<p>
   Last May, the AAFL hired Game Plan Inc., a firm specializing in
consulting to sports leagues and teams. Game Plan found that almost
two-thirds of American adults describe themselves as avid or casual
football fans and that 54 percent of all U.S. adults will qualify
as potential AAFL fans.
<p>
   Still, ESPN's Schaap said: ``I don't think it's terrific timing
for a new league.''
<p>
   In fact, it was exactly 30 years ago today that the Kansas City
Chiefs of the upstart American Football League got drubbed by the
Green Bay Packers of the National Football League in the first
Super Bowl by a score of 35-10.

 &UR; HISTORY MAY RECORD PRESIDENT CLINTON AS ANOTHER IKE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- So it wasn't a great
inaugural speech. So historians don't believe Bill Clinton will
rank as a great president. So what? Clinton, as his second term
begins, stands a good chance of presiding over eight years of peace
and prosperity. What president wouldn't covet that record for his
place in history?
<p>
   ``A lot of presidents would say, 'May God bless me with that
record,''' said Norman Ornstein, a political science scholar at The
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.
<p>
   Clinton, in interviews, likened himself to Thomas Jefferson and
Theodore Roosevelt, presidents who led the country as it entered
previous millenniums. The United States will enter its third
millennium in 2000, the final year of Clinton's presidency.
<p>
   However, Clinton's stewardship more closely resembles that of
Dwight Eisenhower. He, too, served two terms. He, too, steered the
country down the middle of the road. He, too, presided over peace
and relative prosperity. He, too, was much maligned during his time
in the White House.
<p>
   Yet Eisenhower's reputation is much higher today. If not
regarded as a ``great'' president, he's now rated as well above
average. His ranking has jumped from 22nd in the 1962 poll of
historians conducted by Arthur Schlesinger, the Harvard professor,
to among the top 10 more recently. ``Eisenhower is now seen as
having been a very useful president,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at The Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank.
<p>
   Clinton could end up with a similar destiny, if the next four
years and history are kind. With luck as well as skill, the
president will have neither an international or domestic crisis to
deal with. There are no war clouds abroad and no recession, or
worse, immediately in sight at home.
<p>
   That benign outlook, strange as it may seem, is enough to
deprive Clinton of greatness. As he, himself, has said in
interviews, greatness tends to be bestowed on those presidents who
are faced with crises; be they George Washington who presided over
the founding of the country, or Abraham Lincoln who was confronted
by the slavery issue and the Civil War, or Franklin Roosevelt, who
had to cope with the Great Depression and World War II.
<p>
   Clinton's place in history, rather, will be determined by his
success, or lack of it, in attaining the goals he has set for his
second term. At the top of the president's agenda is reaching
agreement with congressional Republicans on a plan to balance the
budget by the year 2002.
<p>
   That may not seem to be such a big deal when compared with
winning wars and ending depressions. Yet, it could earn for Clinton
a place in the record books.
<p>
   The current economic expansion will be six years old this
spring. If it endures through Clinton's second term, it will
surpass the expansions of the 1980s and 1960s as the longest of the
post-World War II era. No small achievement.
<p>
   It's true most economists don't see that happening, with the
consensus predicting a recession in 1998 or 1999. Yet many
economists also agree that expansions don't inevitably die of old
age; rather, they come about because of unforeseen foreign crises
or policy mistakes by Clinton or others.
<p>
   In the current situation, most economists agree, one policy
mistake would be for Clinton to abandon his balanced budget goal,
which he so far shows no signs of doing. Abandoning the goal would
increase the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates to contain the inflationary effect of widening deficits.
<p>
   Another policy mistake, obviously, would be for the Fed to wait
too long to move against inflation even if the budget continues on
the road to balance. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan shows no
inclination toward making that error. He told a congressional
committee this week that there are signs that the nation's tight
labor markets may be beginning to boost workers' pay increases
enough to cause inflation to pick up down the road. If that
happens, he indicated, the central bank will respond by raising
interest rates.
<p>
   Raising rates this year to head off an acceleration in
inflation, of course, would reduce the need to raise rates even
higher later on once inflation builds a head of steam. Early
action, moreover, would give the Fed flexibility to lower rates if
the economy slows too much going into 1998 and thus avert a
recession. If the Fed is skillful, ``we could see the economy
remain strong for quite a while,'' said AEI's Ornstein.
<p>
   For Clinton to make his contribution to the expansion's
longevity, he'll have to ignore the advice of the Schlesinger
historians, now presided over by Arthur Jr. ``Middle-roading may be
fine for campaigning, but it is a sure road to mediocrity in
governing,'' he wrote in a December ranking of presidents in the
New York Times. ``The middle of the road is not the vital center:
it is the dead center. Clinton would be wise to eschew it if he
wants to improve his ratings.''
<p>
   Clinton, however, has no choice but to travel down the middle of
the road; Congress is in Republican hands, after all. The
Republicans failed attempt at confrontation politics a year ago
certainly didn't advance the national agenda. Since his reelection,
the president has talked of the need for political cooperation and
giving voice to America's vital center.
<p>
   He did so again in his inaugural address. Noting that voters had
elected a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, Clinton
said: ``Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of
petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.''
<p>
   This week the president also played his opening card -- a
proposed $138 billion cut in Medicare expenditures over six years
-- in this year's battle of the budget. His formal budget will be
sent to Congress early next month, which will begin the political
painful process of trying to reduce the soaring costs of programs
that distribute benefits to people directly. If the
middle-of-the-road is Eisenhower terrain, then Clinton may find the
journey into history to have a rewarding destination -- a ``peace
and prosperity'' president, like Ike.

<p>
   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 7.7 percent as investors
worried that lagging sales of its mainframes and related products
will hurt profits in coming quarters.
<p>
   IBM's stock fell 10 to 158 in late trading after the company
reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that trailed
expectations. Shares earlier touched 155 and accounted for 35
points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 62.35-point drop.
<p>
   IBM shares had surged to nine-year highs on optimism for strong
growth in all its businesses. The company said late yesterday that
sales of computer hardware edged up just 2 percent as corporations
bought networks of personal computers rather than IBM's hallmark
mainframes.
<p>
   IBM also joined Computer Associates International Inc. and
Oracle Corp. in blaming dismal sales in Europe for disappointing
results.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' said
John Rutledge, an analyst at Boston's Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ``The
bloom is off the rose.''
<p>
   IBM's earnings were slightly below the average estimate of $3.96
a share from 15 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
Several analysts expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   Net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, from $1.71
billion, or $3.09, in the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their estimates for IBM's 1997
earnings and at least two cut 1998 estimates. John Jones at Salomon
Brothers downgraded his recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from
``strong buy'' and Donald Young at Prudential Securities downgraded
the rating to ``hold'' from ``buy.''
<p>
   Others expressed concern that IBM's stock price will decline
substantially over the next few months. IBM's shares reached 168
yesterday, shy of the all-time high of 174 3/4 set in August 1987.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   IBM's not alone in reporting disappointing sales in Europe.
<p>
   European companies are spending less than half the amount that
U.S. and Asian firms spend on technology. That, coupled with weak
economies in some countries, will continue to hurt computer and
software companies, analysts said.
<p>
   Oracle said last month that weakness in Europe hurt its results,
and Computer Associates said yesterday that European sales fell 21
percent. IBM's sales in Europe were unchanged from a year ago at
$8.1 billion.
<p>
   Hardware is IBM's biggest business, accounting for 48 percent of
total sales last year and about two-thirds of profits.
<p>
   IBM unveiled new mainframes this fall. Even so, its hardware
sales edged up just 2 percent to $11.7 billion. System 390
mainframe sales declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were
unchanged from year-earlier levels.
<p>
   Software sales, nearly three-quarters of which are related to
mainframe sales, rose only 4 percent. And maintenance revenue from
contracts to service and maintain the big computers fell 6 percent
as more companies turn to cheaper and easier-to-operate PCs and
powerful servers to deliver information over networks.
<p>
   IBM's PC sales rose from the year-earlier quarter in both
corporate products and home machines.
<p>
   Sales at IBM Microelectronics, the company's chip business,
dropped from the year-earlier period, largely because of falling
prices for dynamic random-access memory chips.
<p>
   IBM's gross margin fell to 40.3 percent from 41.7 percent in the
year-earlier quarter, and IBM expects it to fall another percentage
point in 1997 as prices decline and the mix of more profitable
products is lower.
<p>
   Also, the stronger dollar cost the company 18 cents in per-share
earnings during the quarter. When the dollar is stronger, it is
more expensive to buy dollars with foreign currencies.
<p>
   IBM said yesterday that currency will continue to be a ``wild
card.'' IBM gets more than 60 percent of its sales from outside the
U.S.

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Soybean futures fell amid
expectations that recent rain in Brazil replenished soil moisture,
promising a bumper harvest.
<p>
   As much as 3 inches of rain fell last weekend on the world's
second-largest soybean crop, with the heaviest amount in key
growing areas of southern Brazil, and more moisture is on the way.
Weather Services Corp. said scattered rain is likely in southern
Brazil through this weekend and chances are increasing for showers
or thundershowers early next week.
<p>
   The rains could end concern that dry weather during the past
month would stunt development of the crop.
<p>
   ``People don't believe we have a weather problem in South
America,'' said analyst Don Roose at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa. ``We think it's almost back to ideal, and that
has set the market back.''
<p>
   Soybeans for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
opening higher, fell to $7.405 a bushel, down 6.25 cents.
<p>
   Lower prices for processed soybean products contributed to the
drop. March soybean meal lost $1.80 to $236.30 a short ton, and
March soybean oil fell 0.09 cent to 24.00 cents a pound.
<p>
   To be sure, some traders say additional moisture is needed for
Brazilian plants to reach full production potential. Since U.S.
supplies are headed for their lowest level in 20 years, a bumper
harvest in South America is essential to meet rising world oilseed
demand.
<p>
   ``You have a bullish situation in beans, and all the rain did is
delay the rally,'' said Fred Soneson, analyst at LFG L.L.C. in
Chicago, a commodities brokerage.
<p>
   Strong global demand has led to tight U.S. soybean reserves,
which by September are expected to drop to 155 million bushels, the
lowest since 1977, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>
   Traders on Friday will receive two key indicators of demand. The
Census Bureau will estimate December soybean crushings, and the
USDA will report export sales for the week ended Jan. 16.
<p>
   Wheat futures fell amid signs that increased world trade was
occurring outside the U.S.
<p>
   Iraq probably bought 300,000 metric tons of wheat and Egypt
secured 200,000 tons, traders said, though both orders were filled
outside of the U.S. India tomorrow tenders for 50,000 tons of wheat
but could buy substantially more, traders said, supplies that also
are likely to come from elsewhere.
<p>
   Wheat for March delivery fell 3 cents on the CBOT to $3.7925 a
bushel. March corn slid 0.5 cent to $2.705 a bushel.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Muses have gone out of fashion, but given the largely
unsurprising wares at the 43rd Winter Antiques Show, the exposition
could have used a deity like Mona Strader Schlesinger Bush Williams
von Bismarck de Martini.
<p>
   This socialite, who died in 1983 at 86, would be the customer of
any dealer's dreams. During her heyday in the 1930s, a $700 million
fortune insured that whatever Mona wanted, Mona got. Too bad this
avaricious sylph, best known as Mona Bismarck, is not around,
checkbook ajar. Flaunt-happy plutocrats like her would spice up the
antiques show, a once-bright exhibition that appears to be sliding
into a blancmange. For the benefit of the East Side House
Settlement, the show opened at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park
Avenue and 67th Street on Jan. 16 and closes Sunday.
<p>
   Perhaps the decline is due to timidity. Today's millionaires are
simply not keeping up appearances, which might explain the show's
emphasis on brown furniture. Camelback sofas can be dandy, but they
are rarely what make shoppers hyperventilate. What antiques shows
need are customers whose willingness to spend boldly inspires
dealers to flush out rare fantasias.
<p>
   Or dealers who are willing to take a gamble, to stock something
bizarre and pray for an adventuresome client to drop in. Like
beacons of hope in a sea of French-polished veneer, a few of this
show's 70 dealers understand that nothing exceeds like excess, but
for the most part the eye-popping items are few and far between.
Not to mention examples of solid scholarship.
<p>
   Barry Friedman, a dealer in decorative arts of the mid-20th
century, called Mona ``the wife of the architect of Rockefeller
Center.'' Hanging in his booth is a 1933 gold-frame pencil study of
Mona by Bernard Boutet de Monvel. The price is $6,500.
<p>
   Actually, Mona  &MD;  whose eyes of Caribbean blue and cropped silver
hair led her to be dubbed the ``rock-crystal goddess''  &MD;  had five
husbands. And not one was an architect. Her biggest catch was the
third, Harrison H. Williams, a utilities magnate, whose money was
the engine of opportunity for Mona, a Kentucky beauty with a
do-it-yourself English accent who became his second wife.
<p>
   She liked the rare, the exotic, the costly. Her shopping list
would have included something Chinese, to coordinate with the
Oriental wallpaper in her house at Fifth Avenue and 94th Street
(now the International Center of Photography) or to remind her of
the red-lacquer fence on her estate (now a housing development) in
Bayville, N.Y.
<p>
   Three mazelike windows for sale by Michael Goedhuis, a London
dealer, certainly would have caught Mona's Orientalist fancy.
Sternly elegant and constructed of age-ambered cedar, the windows,
which are basically square trelliswork screens, are relics of a
Ming dynasty villa. Each is priced at around $7,000.
<p>
   Mona would have craved, too, an 18th-century tile plaque cut
into the shape of a pagoda at Aronson of Amsterdam. It is priced at
$160,000. Glazed in orange, blue, yellow and red  &MD;  and looking like
a chinoiserie cookie by Martha Stewart  &MD;  the plaque depicts two
mandarins taking tea in a seaside gazebo trimmed with tiny bells.
<p>
   ``You hung it on a wall from a ribbon, like a picture,'' said
Irene Aronson, who added that the plaque's dominant color, yellow,
made for troublesome production: ``It's hard to bake properly. If
the kiln temperature is too high, the yellow pops off.''
<p>
   Mona might have chosen for her husband Harrison's dressing room
a pair of 7{-inch-by-6-inch black-and-white English ceramic
portraits of Tom Spring and Jack Langan, leading British boxers of
the 1820s. Priced at $3,000 for the pair, they are sold by the
Manhattan shop of Earle D. Vandekar of Knightsbridge. Harrison
Williams died in 1953, but his marital successor, a German count
who had been his secretary, would have appreciated the boxer
portraits, too: Edward von Bismarck took a keen personal interest
in male musculature.
<p>
   Forearms flexed and fists raised, Spring and Langan, who are
stripped to the waist in the pictures, fought a bloody 75-round
match in 1824  &MD;  both men bare-knuckled. As John Richardson, the
Picasso biographer, and Mercedes Bass, the socialite, mulled over a
Wedgwood platter, Paul R. Vandekar, said: ``Boxing was done without
gloves then, so you can imagine the damage inflicted.''
<p>
   Mona had a mania for all-white rooms  &MD;  Syrie Maugham, England's
white queen, decorated the Fifth Avenue Williams house and the
couple's place in Palm Beach, Fla.  &MD;  so she would have snapped up a
miniature silver-mounted Indian bureau bookcase in the booth of
Matz &AMP; Pribell. The 36-inch-tall tabletop folly is reassuringly
costly ($35,000) and happily rare (its only known siblings are in
museums). The 1770 bookcase is veneered in elephant ivory, etched
like scrimshaw with inky images of Dr. Seuss-surreal topiary trees
and oddly proportioned Georgian buildings.
<p>
   ``The Indians interpreted drawings provided by their British
colonial clients,'' said Marc J. Matz, ``so sometimes they ended up
a little quirky.''
<p>
   Also strange shaped is a gilt-bronze and blue-enamel Russian
mantel clock offered by Mory Linz-Einstein, the owner of a Paris
shop, Galeria Epoca. The style of the tubby timepiece, which is
encased in writhing tendril-like supports, can only be described as
Antoni Gaudi by way of Walt Disney. ``It was inspired by the
peasant art of ancient Russia,'' said Ms. Linz-Einstein, who added
that she bought the clock from a noble Russian family. She
described it as dating from ``before Pierre le Grand,'' referring
to the 18th-century Czar Peter the Great. One observer, however,
disagreed, labeling it Russian Art Nouveau. Whatever the era, it is
priced at $29,000, which includes a matching pair of four-branch
candelabra.
<p>
   Less expensive, at $25,000, but more certain in epoch is an 1872
third edition of ``The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.'' Offered by
Bauman Rare Books, its splendor is protected by the original
velvet-lined black leather presentation case. It is the binding,
not the contents, that would have enthralled Mona, who had a
passion for jewels but reportedly never read a book in her life.
<p>
   Designed and made by Sangorski &AMP; Sutcliffe, premier English
bookbinders, the Victorian volume is clad in midnight-blue morocco,
its cover emblazoned with a luscious gold peacock, whose sweeping
tail feathers incorporate 15 garnets, each the size of a nailhead.
The bird's eye is a cabochon ruby; the comb on his head is made of
seven natural seed pearls. And the back cover is paved with Ceylon
sapphires. Though its flowery prose is secondary to the byzantine
binding, the book was intended to be read, if at all, during ``a
very careful pensive moment,'' Natalie Bauman said.
<p>
   Mona's last husband, an Italian doctor, would not have
appreciated an 1870s sketch Peter Nahum is selling for $2,250. But
its sentiment and subject would be appropriate: when Umberto
Martini died in a suspicious automobile accident, he was on the
brink of exposure as a bigamist-embezzler.
<p>
   The sketch is the work of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, the
Pre-Raphaelite painter, and measures 5{ inches by 3~ inches. It
depicts a smirking, potbellied sprite beside the words ``Bent on No
Good.'' There is a secret image on the reverse: a white-clad
maiden, hand tinted and simpering.
<p>
   ``Burne-Jones loved vulnerable women but couldn't stand their
power over his emotions,'' Nahum said. ``This is like the devil
within and the devil without.''

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds fell as Wall Street
firms struggled to sell the $17.5 billion of two-year notes they
bought from the Treasury and prepared for another auction tomorrow.
<p>
   The Treasury sold its notes at a yield of 5.984 percent, less
than the 6 percent yield traders anticipated just before the sale.
The issue recently yielded 6.01 percent.
<p>
   The lower-than-expected yield at the sale ``doesn't mean auction
went well,'' because securities firms can't sell the bonds for as
mexQ!eA%Q! &QC; YI959Q &QC; IQ!5M%5I-Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities
Inc. Making the sale more
difficult is the Treasury's sale of $12.5 billion of fivnotes
tomorrow. &HT;    The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, little changed prior to the
1 p.m. Eastern time sale, slumped 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 bond,
pushing its yield up 3 basis points to 6.81 percent.
<p>
   Securities firms had an easier time finding buyers for the $2
billion of 20-year global bonds Argentina sold today, as investors
hungry for higher yields snapped up the securities.
<p>
   The country sold the bonds at a yield of 11.375 percent, or
462.5 basis points more than U.S. government debt. That's better
than the 500 basis point difference underwriters expected less than
a week ago. Global bonds are sold simultaneously around the world
and trade 24-hours a day.
<p>
   Bond investors, faced with low yields and high prices in many
other parts of the world, ``have got to buy high-yield and emerging
markets debt,'' said Carl Ericson, head of $6 billion in taxable
fixed income at Colonial Advisory Services in Boston. Argentina has
``to make hay while the sun shines.''
<p>
   Investors looked past government reports showing a drop in new
home starts and moderate economic growth as they fretted about
demand for all the new Treasury debt.
<p>
   With all the supply, ``people have got a pretty bearish
viewpoint right now,'' said David Hoffman, who manages $300 million
in bonds at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Delaware.
<p>
   Wall Street firms often push yields higher before the Treasury
sells debt to try to stir up demand from investors.
<p>
   ``The reaction to the two-year is burdened by the prospect of
more supply coming in the pipeline,'' said Tony Crescenzi, a trader
at Miller Tabak Hirsch &AMP; Co. ``Even with good results, the market
is not trading well off them,'' he said.
<p>
   Traders said comments from Federal Reserve Governor Susan
Phillips in a Market News interview also weighed on bonds earlier
in the day. Phillips suggested that the Fed might not wait for a
rise in the core consumer price index before boosting rates.
<p>
   ``Phillips' comments were extremely bearish. They lend support
to the believers who think that the Fed will still have to
tighten,'' or raise rates, said Todd Speiser, a trader at Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The Fed hasn't changed bank lending rates since January 1996,
when it cut the so-called federal funds target by a quarter of a
percentage point to 5.25 percent. The Fed's policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee next meets on Feb. 4-5.
<p>
   Earlier, bonds got a brief fillip after the government reported
a bigger-than-expected drop in December housing starts.
<p>
   The Commerce Department said housing starts fell by 12.2 percent
in December, after climbing a revised 9.3 percent the month before.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News on average expected a decline
of 2.8 percent.
<p>
   Today's housing number adds to a body of evidence suggesting the
economy is growing with little inflation.
<p>
   ``By and large the numbers tell me the economy is not going
gangbusters and not falling off a cliff and that's what (Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan) said in his testimony,'' to the Senate
Budget Committee yesterday, said Robert Alley, who manages about
$2.5 billion at AIM Advisors Inc. in Houston.
<p>
   That should help temper concern that the Fed will soon raise
borrowing rates, some investors said.
<p>
   ``The Fed's likely to be on hold,'' said Alley, who's been
buying bonds lately as he receives cash in his fund. ``We're adding
bonds.''
<p>
   Investors got further evidence that the economy is growing and
jobs are being added at a non-inflationary pace from the Federal
Reserve's report on regional economic activity.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' that wages are rising
in its latest survey, the central bank found no evidence of
accelerating inflation, outside of energy prices.
<p>
   ``It more or less confirms the general impression that the
economy has picked up steam and that things are chugging along with
little threat of inflation,'' said Robert McGee, chief economist at
Tokai Bank.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on anecdotal evidence of business conditions compiled by the
Fed's 12 district banks, and is published eight times each year.
The report will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate
targets at Fed's meeting next month.
<p>
   While release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Eastern
time, it was inadvertently released ahead of schedule on the
Internet.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Don Mattingly, the greatest New
York Yankee never to appear in a World Series, officially retired
from baseball.
<p>
   Mattingly, 35, has not played since 1995 and was plagued by back
problems during his final few seasons, cutting his production.
<p>
   A free-agent after his last season, Mattingly elected not to
re-sign with the Yankees and sat out the 1996 season as New York
won its first World Series in 18 years.
<p>
   He never formally retired, leaving open the possibility to a
return to New York or another major league team. Last season,
Mattingly received contract offers from three or four teams, but
didn't accept any, saying the situations weren't right for him.
<p>
   A six-time All-Star, Mattingly hit .307 with 222 home runs and
1,099 runs batted in during his 13-year career. He won the 1984
American League batting title with a .343 average, edging out
teammate Dave Winfield on the final day of the season, and was
named the 1985 American League Most Valuable Player after hitting
.324 with 35 HR and 145 RBI.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Martha Stewart may be the high
priestess of posh living to her fans, but to her former gardener
she's a wage cheat.
<p>
   Renaldo Abreu is suing Stewart in Connecticut state court,
saying she owes him more than $30,000 in overtime for washing cars,
grooming dogs and performing other work at the Westport estate that
serves as the set for the ``Martha Stewart Living'' shows on CBS
and the Lifetime cable channel.
<p>
   Stewart said he's not entitled to the extra pay, turning to a
tactic often used by companies trying to gain a legal edge in
disputes with employees: Describe their jobs in such a way that the
employee isn't entitled to receive overtime pay, to join a union or
to collect the minimum wage.
<p>
   ``Any law that protects workers can be evaded by
misclassification,'' said Laurence Gold, associate general counsel
for the AFL-CIO. ``It's happening more and more.''
<p>
   In Stewart's case, the dean of domesticity says Abreu has no
right to more than the $54,000 she paid him in 1994 because he's an
agricultural worker -- a job status exempt from overtime. The suit
is pending.
<p>
   The plight of Stewart's gardener isn't unique. Some of the
country's biggest companies routinely give workers job titles that
in no way depict what they do for a living. When challenged,
however, the name games often fail.
<p>
   Take the case of United Parcel Service Inc., which in August
lost a bid to call itself an ``airline'' and thus classify its
workers as airline employees. That designation would have helped
protect the company from strikes by its 165,000 drivers, package
sorters and mechanics represented by the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters.
<p>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington found that since
90 percent of UPS packages never leave the ground, the company
wasn't an airline that would be governed by the Railway Labor Act,
which regulates railroads and airlines.
<p>
   The law was designed, among other things, to prevent crippling
strikes that idle the nation's transportation network and hurt the
economy. A strike can be barred for months or even years until the
National Mediation Board, a federal agency, declares negotiations
at an impasse. Only then can workers walk off the job.
<p>
   UPS said it wanted to come under the Railway Act to compete
better with largely non-union Federal Express Corp. Even FedEx
workers who are unionized, including 3,000 pilots, must go through
protracted mediation before they strike.
<p>
   ``It puts us at a competitive disadvantage,'' said UPS
spokeswoman Gina Ellrich. ``We provide the exact same services as
Federal Express.''
<p>
   The appeals court didn't buy that argument, noting that unlike
UPS, Federal Express's main business is air freight, with a
trucking operation as an add-on. The three-judge panel also pointed
out that FedEx started as an airline, while UPS has been regulated
as a trucking company for decades.
<p>
   Agriculture may be the biggest hotbed of job classification
disputes, because the industry is immune from federal laws that let
workers in other fields unionize and enjoy other rights.
<p>
   ``Agricultural workers are exempted from most of the protections
of federal labor law,'' said Georgetown University law professor
Michael Gottesman. ``There is a huge advantage to employers.''
<p>
   Of course, changing a job title without changing the work
doesn't always fly.
<p>
   Tyson Foods Inc., the big poultry processor, learned that lesson
last April, when the U.S. Supreme struck down its bid to lump
together 157 truckers, chicken catchers and forklift operators at a
Wilkesboro, North Carolina, plant as agricultural workers. Tyson's
goal was to block the workers from joining the Teamsters union, a
right not guaranteed to agricultural laborers.
<p>
   The ruling forced Tyson to let those workers and employees with
similar jobs at other Tyson plants unionize.
<p>
   While companies have tried to use creative job classifications
to deny extra pay and other benefits to workers, the federal
government may soon borrow the tactic in a move to impose reforms
on the poultry-processing industry.
<p>
   Later this year, the U.S. Labor Department is expected to try
using laws that protect migrant farm workers to make the industry
provide better housing and change how it recruits workers.
<p>
   The plan comes as the industry relies increasingly on workers
recruited from near the Mexican border for processing work in
Arkansas, Georgia and other states.
<p>
   ``This would place some basic requirement that the living
conditions be basically habitable and that the transportation be
habitable,'' said Laurence Norton, an attorney with Texas Rural
Legal Aid. ``Employers don't want to be covered by this because it
places restrictions on them.''
<p>
   The industry maintains that its workers are employed throughout
the year, not transients who follow crop harvests. For that reason,
said Rogers, Arkansas-based Hudson Foods Inc., migrant labor laws
don't apply.
<p>
   ``They are permanent employees,'' said Hudson Foods spokeswoman
Terri Mallioux. ``We don't hire seasonal workers.''
<p>
   If the industry challenges the Labor Department, courts likely
will be asked to examine what workers do on the job and decide
whether Congress wanted migrant labor laws to be broadly
interpreted.
<p>
   So don't be surprised if the debate over whether a job
classification fits the job grows as complicated as a Thanksgiving
dinner at Martha Stewart's house.

<p>
   New Orleans, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Green Bay Packers coach Mike
Holmgren said his defense will be introduced at the Super Bowl,
preventing what could have been a divisive problem four days before
the game.
<p>
   The Packers used a rotation system this season, meaning it would
be the defense's turn this week. There was speculation, however,
that Holmgren would introduce his offense, which is led by
quarterback Brett Favre.
<p>
   The Super Bowl is a homecoming for Favre, the league's two-time
Most Valuable Player, who grew up about an hour away in Kiln,
Mississippi.
<p>
   ``There was a lot of lobbying from both sides,'' Holmgren said.
<p>
   Several defensive players, including veterans LeRoy Butler and
Sean Jones, said a switch would have disrupted the team.
<p>
   ``We thought we were going to get a raw deal because it's
Brett's home town,'' Butler said. ``I'm juiced for that
introduction.''
<p>
   So is second-year cornerback Craig Newsome, who Butler said is
working with his six-year-old son on some sort of routine when he
enters the field.
<p>
   While the Packers' high-octane offense got most of the attention
during the season, their defense ranked first overall in the
league.
<p>
   The unit's leaders are Reggie White and Jones, Green Bay's
defensive ends. White, the NFL's all-time sacks leader, like Jones,
is making his first appearance in the Super Bowl.
<p>
   ``I would have been upset,'' White said. ``But it wouldn't have
caused a problem.''
<p>
   Not true, Jones said.
<p>
   ``He's lying,'' he said. The defense would have been very
angry.''
<p>
   Perhaps recognizing that, Holmgren said he wouldn't fiddle with
the rotation, which he said has worked pretty well so far. At least
one member of the offensive unit said he's happy for the guys on
the other side of the ball.
<p>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' said running back Edgar
Bennett. ``They deserve it.''
<p>
   Bennett is particularly happy for Butler, a teammate at Robert
E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Florida, then at Florida State
and now in Green Bay.
<p>
   ``We're like brothers he said. ``It's like I'm out there with
him.''

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Copper prices rose after a U.S.
government report on December building permits, a gauge of future
demand for copper, showed little change.
<p>
   Permits for new U.S. housing construction were issued last month
at an annual rate of 1.410 million, down 0.6 percent from November,
when permits rose 4.1 percent, the Commerce Department said today.
<p>
   The permit figure -- a sign of steady future demand for copper,
a key material used by the construction industry --offset the
Commerce Department's report that U.S. housing starts fell 12.2
percent in December to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.329 million.
Analysts had forecast a 2.8 percent decline last month.
<p>
   ``Look at the permit data, there's almost no change and it's a
better indication of demand for the construction industry,'' said
Dean Crist, an economist at the National Association of Home
Builders in Washington. The December declines in housing starts
were mostly weather-related, he said.
<p>
   Copper for March delivery rose 1.05 cent to $1.073 a pound on
the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division.
<p>
   Last month's drop in housing starts followed a revised 9.3
percent rise in November.
<p>
   Weather was ``a factor last month, with all the rain storms and
floods along the Californian coast and all the way up to the
Canadian boarder,'' Crist said. ``You can't even lay the
foundations of a house in weather like that.''
<p>
   Copper demand, particularly in the construction industry, can't
be assessed from `` a one-month perspective, but (from) the year
overall,'' said Joe Drosdick, a copper manager at American Iron and
Metal Co. in Verona, New Jersey.
<p>
   In an average 1,000-square feet apartment, about 280 pounds of
copper is used with the number rising to about 440 pounds of copper
in an average single-family home of 21,000 square feet, according
to the New York-based Copper Development Association Inc.
<p>
   In 1994, the building and construction industry used about 3.126
billion pounds of copper -- about 41 percent of total U.S. annual
production, the association said.
<p>
   Even with the drop-off in December, housing construction posted
the strongest annual gain in eight years during 1996.
<p>
   The lull during December may not last as demand from the
building industry is expected to grow this year, though not as
robustly as in 1996, according to the National Association of Home
Builders.
<p>
   ``The figures show growth, they're not going negative,'' Crist
said. ``Still, we expect a slowdown in overall economic demand
because we don't see the same level of employment this year as last
year.''
<p>
   Housing starts are estimated at 1.382 million this year, Crist
said, down 6.2 percent from 1.474 million last year when starts
rose 8.8 percent, the highest level since 1988, fueled by a dip in
30-year fixed mortgage interest rates below 7 percent.
<p>
   ``I'm rather optimistic about 1997 now that it's arrived, much
more optimistic than I was six or seven months ago.'' said Robert
Strudler, chief executive officer of U.S. Home Corp. in Houston.
<p>
   Still, the weakness in December construction demand comes at a
time of rising exchange-held supplies. London Metal Exchange
stockpiles rose 4,725 metric tons yesterday to 143,225 tons. The
jump bolstered expectations that copper supplies held in exchanges
will grow in the coming months, easing concern of spot shortages.
<p>
   ``The trend for LME stockpiles is higher, although some of the
Comex stockpiles are going to LME warehouses,'' Drosdick said.
<p>
   While Comex copper supplies fell 1,389 short tons (1,260 metric
tons) since Friday, U.S. copper warehouses operated by the LME
registered increases. The largest gains were in Baltimore, up 375
tons and in Long Beach, California, up 2,250 tons, the LME said
yesterday.

   Pittsburgh, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Pittsburgh Penguins center
Mario Lemieux is listed as day-to-day after leaving last night's
game with back spasms.
<p>
   Lemieux was injured when he crashed into the net after getting
tangled up with Calgary Flames defenseman Steve Chiasson late in
the first period of Pittsburgh's 4-2 win.
<p>
   Before leaving the game, Lemieux, the National Hockey League's
leading scorer with 80 points, scored his 30th goal of the season.
<p>
   A five time Art Ross Trophy winner as the NHL's scoring
champion, Lemieux has a 15-game point-scoring streak heading into
tomorrow's game against the Colorado Avalanche.
<p>
   Lemieux, who has missed only one game this season, missed the
entire 1994-95 season due to back problems and Hodgkin's disease.

   New York, Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Rich people, and the folks who
manage cash for them, are betting that they'll have to be a bit
more original this year to make money.
<p>
   ``I've restructured my portfolio to be nimble,'' said George
Hambrecht, president of Barlow Partners, who manages $110 million
by farming out cash to outside managers who invest primarily in
U.S. stocks. ``That way we'll only lose an arm and a leg rather
than the whole body.''
<p>
   With analysts expecting meager returns on U.S. stocks, investors
are looking for managers who can make money even if U.S. shares
tumble. That's why they're placing money with global managers of
stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or with managers who
specialize in parts of the U.S. market they think will make money,
such as gold or technology shares.
<p>
   They also want managers who sell stocks short, by borrowing
shares and selling them immediately hoping to later buy them back
at lower prices.
<p>
   Last year, managers profited from being one-trick ponies. Julian
Robertson, who runs the $8.5 billion Tiger Management funds,
returned 38 percent after fees in 1996. Even though he can invest
in stocks, bond and commodities around the globe, he concentrated
on the U.S., betting that such shares as Citicorp, Intel Corp. and
USAir Inc. would jump.
<p>
   Leon Cooperman, who runs the $3 billion Omega Advisors global
fund, also made a bundle from U.S. stocks. His fund returned about
36 percent after fees in 1996.
<p>
   Neither were available to talk about 1997 strategies.
<p>
   Hedge fund managers don't expect U.S. earnings to climb more
than 5 percent this year, meaning stocks prices will probably climb
less than 10 percent, said Charles Gradante, co-principal of
WPG-Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, a New York consultant that
matches wealthy investors with money managers.
<p>
   Gradante is telling his clients to put two-thirds of their money
overseas or in investments that don't move in tandem with U.S.
stocks. Last year, he told clients that two-thirds of their money
should be in the U.S.
<p>
   Evaluation Associates in Norwalk, Connecticut is putting a
``large percentage'' of its $500 million in hedge funds with
managers who invest in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies
around the world, said Patrick Moriarty, a senior vice president.
``They can take both sides of a bet.''
<p>
   Last year, some of the biggest managers who bet on macroeconomic
trends by, say, buying the dollar or shorting oil, didn't do well
in part because they weren't heavily invested in U.S. shares.
<p>
   Mark Strome's Offshore Fund ended the year down 16.9 percent,
and George Soros' $7 billion flagship Quantum Fund dropped 1.49
percent, its worst year since 1981.
<p>
   Strome, who runs Strome, Susskind Investment Management in Santa
Monica, California, is preparing to short the U.S. stock market
this year, said a person familiar with the fund.
<p>
   Other global managers are pouring money into European, Latin
American and Asian markets, said Gradante of WPG-Hennessee.
<p>
   European stocks and bonds should do better that their U.S.
counterparts, Gradante said. That's because interest rates are
expected to remain unchanged or fall as inflation remains under
control.
<p>
   Global managers are also bullish on Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index,
which has already jumped about 17 percent in the past three months,
and in stocks in Thailand, South Korea and India, which all got
trampled last year but are poised for a rebound.
<p>
   In Latin America stock markets, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina
are all getting new money from these managers, Gradante said.
<p>
   In the U.S., Hambrecht's betting on technology managers who buy
and hold shares as well as sell them short. He also has money with
energy managers, who should do well because low inventories in
heating oil, gasoline and crude should push energy prices higher.
<p>
   Jim Hedges, who runs LJH Alternative Investment Advisors in
Naples, Florida, a consultant to wealthy individuals and
institutions, agrees that Thailand, South Korea and India stocks
should be winners this year.
<p>
   He also likes the debt of companies in or near bankruptcy, which
he said could return around 20 percent for the second year in a
row; real estate investment trusts, which generally don't move in
the same direction as other U.S. stocks and gold stocks, which
could benefit from declining production costs and which are selling
cheaply because of low gold prices.

<p>
   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Bond investors around the
world lined up to lend Argentina $2 billion today at
lower-than-expected interest rates, helping the nation finance its
growing national debt.
<p>
   The country sold 20-year global bonds at a yield of 11.375
percent, or 462.5 basis points more than U.S. government debt.
That's better than the 500 basis point difference underwriter
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. expected less than a week ago.
<p>
   Brisk demand for the country's debt suggests investors are
confident that Argentina, a nation that suffered from economic
stagnation and hyperinflation during much of the 1970s and 1980s,
will be able to pay lenders 20 years from now.
<p>
   Bond investors, faced with low yields and high prices in many
other parts of the world, ``have got to buy high-yield and emerging
markets debt,'' said Carl Ericson, head of $6 billion in taxable
fixed income at Colonial Advisory Services in Boston. Argentina has
``to make hay while the sun shines.''
<p>
   Underwriters said they'd received $8 billion in bids for the new
securities by the end of yesterday, three times as much as they
needed to sell. Argentina plans to raise the bulk of the $8.5
billion it needs to borrow in foreign markets this year by the end
of the first quarter.
<p>
   ``The government is being very shrewd in bringing forward its
funding, raising as much as possible,'' said Norberto Rosas, an
economist at Argentine consulting firm Proeco. ``It's covering
itself against a possible change in world financial market
conditions later in the year.''
<p>
   The global securities are sold simultaneously around the world
and traded around the clock. Demand for the bonds was so brisk that
the government scrapped its original plan to split the sale between
five-year debt and 20-year debt.
<p>
   Argentina was able to persuade investors to accept a lower yield
in part because they have little choice. Yields of many other bonds
have declined and investors are scouring the globe for high-yield
securities.
<p>
   Argentina's new debt still offers more yield than some of the
alternatives. The new debt yields more than the high-yield,
high-risk ``junk'' debt of some U.S. companies. The 8.25 percent
bonds of Kmart Corp., the U.S. retailer, recently yielded 313 basis
points more than Treasuries. The bonds, which mature in 2022, carry
a rating similar to Argentina.
<p>
   The country's 10-year debt yields about 370 basis points more
than U.S. government debt. The higher borrowing rate on the 20-year
securities gives investors an extra cushion, and ``takes into
account some chance that things will go badly,'' said Luis Luis, a
principal at Scudder Stevens &AMP; Clark that manages $1.75 billion in
Latin America debt.
<p>
   Still, Argentina's Par Brady bonds also offer investors the
chance to buy into the country, and they're backed in part by U.S.
Treasury securities. The Brady bonds yield 549 basis points more
than U.S. government debt.
<p>
   Yet Argentina was able to garner a lower yield at today's sale,
taking advantage of current low interest rates and growing investor
confidence in the country. In March, it plans to sell another $1
billion of bonds.
<p>
   This year, $10.2 billion of Argentina's debt comes due. Another
$10 billion matures in 1998, while in 1999 the sum rises to $11.6
billion, according to Fundacion Capital, an economic research firm.
<p>
   At the moment, the signs for Argentina's economy and the
nation's ability to manage its $100 billion debt, seem good.
<p>
   The economy is set to expand by about 5 percent this year
following 4 percent growth in 1996, according to government
officials and private economists.
<p>
   Inflation, once the nemesis of the economy, has been tamed. In
1996, retail prices rose by just 0.05 percent. Its inflation rate
was among the lowest in the world.
<p>
   Yet all is not rosy. The unemployment rate is 17 percent, and
the government hasn't been able to balance its budget.
<p>
   What's more, the chances for political change after President
Carlos Menem steps down in 1999 may also raise the risk that his
economic program will be scrapped. Concerns that Argentina will
fall into another period of high inflation and slow growth stopped
some investors from making a long-term commitment to the country.
<p>
   ''It was a far different country 20-years ago than it is today,
and I can't predict what the country will look like 20-years from
now,'' said Edwin Ferrell, who helps manage $3.2 billion for the
Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, Iowa. ``It's a leap of
faith.''
<p>
   Still, it appears that's a leap many investors are willing to
make.

 &UR; DID EPA UNLEASH A WITCH HUNT AMONG ITS OWN SCIENTISTS?
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release Saturday, Jan. 25.
<p>
    &UR; By JEFF NESMITH &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  More than three years after the U.S. government
accused Jesse MacArthur ``Mac'' Long of defrauding taxpayers out of
the cost of obtaining a Ph.D. degree, the complaint against the
Environmental Protection Agency scientist has been dropped.
<p>
   In return for a U.S. attorney's agreement to take no further
action against him, Long agreed to pay $24,000 in ``reimbursement''
for taxpayers' money that paid for tuition and other expenses
associated with the doctorate.
<p>
   Before closing the case, government lawyers said they never
intended to accuse him of wrongdoing, violating any law or
breaching any contract. But, they said, in receiving the degree
from Montana State University in 1993 he may have benefited from
``wrongful conduct'' on the part of someone else.
<p>
   Long, a 53-year-old chemist at EPA's research laboratory in
Athens, Ga., says that in order to pay legal costs and the
agreed-to settlement, he and his wife have exhausted their life
savings and been forced to take out a second mortgage on their
home. His attorney estimates the settlement and defense costs will
total well over $100,000.
<p>
   Some career EPA scientists see Long's ordeal as much more than
one man's fight to save his reputation. The charges against him
grew out of a wide-ranging investigation of several EPA research
laboratories by the EPA Office of Inspector General (IG), the
agency's internal ``watchdog'' organization.
<p>
   The case and others growing out of the IG probe raised a raft of
thorny public policy issues, including the direction of the
agency's scientific programs and the level of expertise expected
and encouraged at EPA.
<p>
   ``EPA scientists and their front-line managers received brutal
treatment during IG investigations that federal hearing examiners
subsequently ruled were carried out in bad faith,'' said EPA
microbiologist David Lewis, also of Athens.
<p>
   During the IG's investigations of EPA labs, dozens of scientists
were interrogated, and some were threatened with criminal charges.
Several were fired, suspended or demoted  &MD;  only to be reinstated
when actions against them were appealed. In some cases, the
government was ordered to pay their attorney fees.
<p>
   A relatively new federal agency, EPA has failed to establish a
reputation as an outstanding scientific organization. A chorus of
complaints about the agency's science has been led primarily by
regulated industry, especially chemical manufacturers. However,
university researchers, environmentalists and even some EPA
managers have charged that scientific achievement at the agency is
stagnant.
<p>
   Five years ago, an independent panel convened by
then-Administrator William K. Reilly concluded that EPA had
provided ``insufficient incentives to reward the production of
high-quality science.''
<p>
   Its report stated, ``The panel strongly recommends that the
agency expand opportunities for rotations that allow scientists
from other organizations to work in EPA's science programs and EPA
scientists to participate in the scientific efforts of other
organizations.''
<p>
   Long's co-workers, who have raised $3,300 in a legal defense
fund for him, say he is an honest and dedicated government worker,
whose career and savings were laid waste by a ruthless effort to
find examples of ``fraud, waste and abuse'' in government.
<p>
   Ironically, it was his attempt to broaden his expertise that
caused him to run afoul of the controversial investigation by
Inspector General John Martin, who launched probes of the Athens
lab and several others while under stinging criticism in Congress
for allegedly failing to more vigorously expose examples of fraud,
waste and abuse at EPA.
<p>
   To allay criticism from a House subcommittee, Martin rewrote the
criteria under which his top investigators received their annual
federal employee job performance evaluations. The new standards
pressured them to produce indictments, administrative action or
civil lawsuits in at least 25 percent of the cases they supervised.
<p>
   They were awarded extra ``points'' when one of their cases
attracted the interest of a member of Congress or got publicity for
Martin's office.
<p>
   IG investigators charged that beginning in 1989, Long
manipulated bureaucratic processes to obtain benefits to which he
was not entitled  &MD;  the Ph.D. degree  &MD;  at taxpayers' expense.
<p>
   Long, who joined the Athens laboratory in 1975, applied in 1988
for a training program under which EPA sponsors a limited number of
employees for postgraduate studies. He was turned down.
<p>
   He said that Rose Marie Russo, director of the Athens
laboratory, then directed him to prepare the paperwork to have
himself temporarily detailed to Montana State to do the research he
had proposed in the detection of extremely low levels of
pollutants.
<p>
   Court records show that Martin's office recommended that Long be
indicted over the Ph.D. degree, but that a U.S. attorney in Macon,
Ga., declined to take the case because it did not involve ``drugs
or guns and a bunch of peanut farmers'' on a Georgia grand jury
would not understand it.
<p>
   The failure to get an indictment did not end the IG's interest
in Mac Long, however.
<p>
   On the night of Nov. 9, 1994, two IG investigators knocked on
the front door of Long's home in Athens. They handed him a letter
advising him that the U.S. attorney in Billings, Mont., intended to
file a civil lawsuit against him for $117,317.83, the amount the
investigators had concluded the government paid in salary, tuition
and other expenses involved in the degree.
<p>
   Investigator Lorraine Fairchild later recalled in a court
deposition that as Long stared at the letter, she asked him to
engage laboratory director Russo in a secretly recorded telephone
conversation aimed at implicating the lab director in the case.
<p>
   Long refused. The Montana U.S. attorney filed the lawsuit on
Dec. 13, 1994, charging that Long had manipulated the EPA grant
process to set up his own Ph.D. program at government expense. That
amounted to ``unjust enrichment'' and fraud against the government,
the suit declared.
<p>
   Martin retired this month, coincidentally on almost the exact
day the lawsuit against Long was being closed. A few weeks before
leaving the job, he said in an interview that the probe by his
office of agency research laboratories, and of scientists such as
Mac Long, had identified numerous management problems that needed
to be corrected.
<p>
   He said the effort by his investigators to get people such as
Long to surreptitiously tape-record staged conversations with their
superiors was a respected and commonly used law enforcement
technique.
<p>
   For his part, Martin refused a request that the interview be
tape-recorded.
<p>
   He said the pressure placed on his supervising investigators to
produce ``criminal and/or administrative action'' against the
people they investigate was ``a sort of incentive program.''
<p>
   He said extra points are awarded for cases that attract
publicity because of the importance of letting EPA employees
``realize that we do find wrongdoing and that when we do we
aggressively pursue it.''
<p>
   But the series of audits and investigations of the EPA
laboratories has sent a different message, some scientists say.
<p>
   ``These labs bore the brunt of the IG thing,'' said Sam
Karickhoff, a research chemist at the Athens lab, adding that the
investigations provoked ``a lot of paranoia'' among scientists.
<p>
   ``It appeared to me that the IG people came, at least to our
lab, with a preconceived idea of guilt and an agenda to prove their
preconceived notions,'' said Robert Swank, director of research at
the 70-employee laboratory. ``I think the results have been a major
negative impact on morale and productivity.''
<p>
   Late last year, the government offered to drop all charges if
Long would pay the reduced sum of $24,000.
<p>
   Stanley Kaleczyc, Long's Montana lawyer, said the expense of
going to trial would probably add more than that to Long's legal
bills. Kaleczyc advised his client to accept the settlement offer.
<p>
   Long said he decided he and his wife could fight no longer, so
he agreed to the settlement.
<p>
   ``Prior to this, the only black marks on my record were two
speeding tickets,'' he said. ``We have both suffered an enormous
physical, emotional, financial disaster. It was a terrible
injustice that decent, honest, hard-working people should not have
had to endure.''

<p>
   The average American drinks a gallon of soft drinks a week.
Coca-Cola and Pepsico are out to see that she drinks even more.
<p>
   Both companies are rolling out new drinks. Coke is taking aim
with Surge, a Mountain Dew/PowerAde-type drink. Pepsi has Josta, a
mahogany-hued fizzer made with the Brazilian guarana berry.
<p>
   Both are new flavors for newish soft drink consumers.
<p>
   ``Consumers tend to be interested in trying new products and
wanting variety now and then,'' says Gary Hemphill, vice president
of Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting and information group for
suppliers and manufacturers of soft drinks. ``That's the reason
we've seen soft drink companies getting involved in partnerships
for bottled and canned teas, drinks like Fruitopia and Pepsi
pairing with Ocean Spray.''
<p>
   Too, there's a whole new group of consumers coming up every
couple of years. Teen-agers drink more soda than other Americans,
and they develop brand loyalty early.
<p>
   ``Young people drink large quantities of soft drinks,'' says
John Sicher, editor and publisher of ``Beverage Digest,'' a
newsletter for the nonalcoholic beverage industry. ``When a young
person forms an allegiance to a brand, it is largely carried
through as the person gets older.''
<p>
   In Coke's case, it's not just teen-agers that it wants for its
new Surge; it's 12- to 24-year-old males. Street buzz is that Surge
is Coke's entry to go up against heavily caffeinated Mountain Dew,
Pepsi's $3 billion-a-year heavy citrus soda, which is popular with
young men.
<p>
   But Surge is an animal unto itself. In addition to high fructose
corn syrup, the drink also contains maltodextrin, the carbohydrate
used in PowerAde, Coke's sports drink.
<p>
   This yields a neon-green soda that has about the same amount of
caffeine as Mountain Dew (slightly more than Coke or Pepsi) but
still far less than coffee. (A 12-ounce serving of Pepsi contains
38 milligrams of caffeine, Mountain Dew has 52 milligrams and
coffee has about 300 milligrams.)
<p>
   The sugars in Surge are a whopping 42 grams, about par with soft
drinks but nearly double that of sports drinks.
<p>
   Sicher says the Surge formula follows the trend in the soft
drink beverage industry of having ``value-added products that add a
nutritive element,'' much like the orange juice industry is adding
calcium to its formula.
<p>
   Josta, Pepsi's new soft drink, also has an added element, but
the company is pussyfooting around the issue.
<p>
   Josta is made with the caffeine-laden guarana, a Brazilian berry
that word of mouth compares to Asia's ginseng, used for centuries
as a folkloric sexual and physical stimulant. Several mammoth
companies were pushing to get guarana beverages on the shelves;
Pepsi won the race.
<p>
   Pepsi makes no claims, but the legend on the panther-emblazoned,
jungle-themed cans reads: ``Guarana grows deep within the jungle.
For centuries, ancient tribes believed that guarana released raw,
primal power. Now the legend of guarana has been captured in the
potent flavor of Josta. Unleash it.''
<p>
   Whatever else it does, Josta unleashes a jolt of energy. It
weighs in with 59 milligrams of caffeine and 44 grams of sugars in
a 12-ounce can.
<p>
   Don't expect the soft drink category to stop with these entries.
Pepsi recently went into a developmental deal with Starbucks to
come up with coffee-based soft drinks. Talk about your primal
power.

 &UR; SEC UPHOLDS SUSPENSION OF TWO EX-COOPERS &AMP; LYBRAND EXECUTIVES &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Washington) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission upheld the suspension of two former Coopers &AMP; Lybrand
executives for failing to recognize red flags about the financial
condition of Savin Corp. in the early 1980s.
<p>
   The executives, David Checkosky and Norman Aldrich, both
accountants, recklessly agreed to defer costs that Savin incurred
in developing a new photocopier, the SEC said. The company later
filed for bankruptcy protection. The accountants ignored numerous
signs ``that should have caused them to question Savin's accounting
treatment,'' the SEC ruled in a 2-1 vote. Instead of showing
``heightened vigilance,'' the Coopers partners demonstrated ``lack
of independent judgment,'' the SEC said. Checkosky's and Aldrich's
attorneys declined comment. The two former Coopers partners had
argued in an earlier administrative filing that they ``consistently
used substantial care'' during the audits while trying to comply
with an ``ambiguous'' accounting standard.
<p>
   The 27-page SEC decision said that Savin's improper cost
deferrals allowed it to narrow operating losses. The Coopers
accountants should have reacted to red flags that included company
financial losses, employee lay-offs, and unsuccessful attempts to
develop copier designs, the decision said.
<p>
   SEC Commissioner Norman Johnson was the lone dissenter, arguing
that Checkosky and Aldrich were ``merely negligent'' and acted
without willful intent.
<p>
   ``The majority's position will impair the relationships between
professionals and their clients,'' wrote Johnson, a Republican.
``Difficult ethical and professional responsibility concerns are
generally matters most appropriately dealt with by professional
organizations or, in certain cases, malpractice litigation.''
<p>
   Johnson also argued that the Coopers audits at issue were too
old to rule on. Voting for the majority were SEC Chairman Arthur
Levitt and Commissioner Isaac Hunt, both Democrats.
<p>
   ``Recklessness'' has been defined by the courts as ``an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care.'' ``Negligence'' is
considered an inadvertent or insignificant deviation from
accounting standards.
<p>
   The SEC decision yesterday ended a lengthy case first ruled on
by the SEC in 1992. Checkosky and Aldrich appealed the decision to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
which sent it back to the SEC in 1994 ``for a more adequate
explanation.''
<p>
   The SEC decision upheld the two-year suspension of Checkosky and
Aldrich from working as accountants for a publicly traded company.
The penalty was academic, as the two finished serving their
suspensions in 1994.
<p>
   Checkosky, who was lead partner on the 1981-1984 audits, and
Aldrich, who was an audit manager and concurring partner, have both
left the firm, a Coopers spokeswoman said. Coopers, the nation's
fifth largest accounting firm, declined comment on the matter.
<p>
   An academic said today that the SEC decision ``is important in
underscoring the idea of professional responsibilities.
<p>
   ``If a company's in financial trouble and there are enough red
flags, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they may try to
play accounting games,'' said J. Edward Ketz, a Penn State
University accounting professor. ``The auditor has to be more
A0vigilant.''
<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut-based Savin, which emerged from year-long
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1993, declined comment. The
company settled SEC charges in 1985 by agreeing not to commit
future violations, to restate 1983 and 1984 annual reports, and to
write off some deferred costs related to development of the
copiers. Savin neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the
settlement.

<p>
   Santiago, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Chilean stocks fell as a
stronger peso made it more expensive for foreign investors to buy
shares, deterring new investment.
<p>
   The peso rose 1.5 percent during the last two days after the
central bank widened the band within which the currency can trade.
<p>
   ``You can buy less stocks with the same dollars today than
yesterday,'' said Axel Christensen, head of research at Citicorp in
Chile.
<p>
   Moreover, the stronger peso hit exporters including Cia. de
Petroleos de Chile SA, or Copec, whose shares fell as their goods
became more expensive overseas.
<p>
   The selective stock index tumbled 2.32 points, or 2.08 percent,
to 108.94, according to results taken immediately after the market
closed. The general stock index fell 64.59 points, or 1.23 percent,
to 5196.97.
<p>
   ``Logic says exporters are going to be hit by the stronger
peso,'' said David Chon, a strategist at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New
York.
<p>
   Among exporters, shares in Copec fell 2.06 percent to 1660.00,
while Cia. Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones SA, or CMPC, dropped
2.63 percent to 4625.00.
<p>
   Other stocks fell as foreign investment dried up because of the
stronger peso, Christensen said.
<p>
   Moreover, ``there is no local support for stocks at these
prices,'' he said. ``The pension funds aren't buying any more.''
<p>
   After rallying 15 percent over two weeks, stocks slumped 5.5
percent in the last two days amid concern they're overvalued.
<p>
   Shares in Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA, or Endesa,
slumped 5.86 percent to 241.0, partly on concern profits will fall
this year.
<p>
   ``Our view on Endesa is negative,'' said Juan Sommer, head of
research at Celfin SA. ``There is a lot of short-term bad news for
the company,'' which is Chile's largest hydroelectricity generator.
<p>
   The recent drought is forcing Endesa to buy more expensive
electricity from thermal power producers in order to meet its sales
commitments.
<p>
   Shares in Enersis SA, which owns 26 percent of Endesa, fell 1.81
percent to 244.01. Trading totaled 14.04 billion pesos ($33.3
million) today. The number of issues that advanced, declined or
closed unchanged wasn't immediately available.

 &UR; DID EPA UNLEASH A WITCH HUNT AMONG ITS OWN SCIENTISTS?
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release Saturday, Jan. 25.
<p>
    &UR; By JEFF NESMITH &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  More than three years after the U.S. government
accused Jesse MacArthur ``Mac'' Long of defrauding taxpayers out of
the cost of obtaining a Ph.D. degree, the complaint against the
Environmental Protection Agency scientist has been dropped.
<p>
   In return for a U.S. attorney's agreement to take no further
action against him, Long agreed to pay $24,000 in ``reimbursement''
for taxpayers' money that paid for tuition and other expenses
associated with the doctorate.
<p>
   Before closing the case, government lawyers said they never
intended to accuse him of wrongdoing, violating any law or
breaching any contract. But, they said, in receiving the degree
from Montana State University in 1993 he may have benefited from
``wrongful conduct'' on the part of someone else.
<p>
   Long, a 53-year-old chemist at EPA's research laboratory in
Athens, Ga., says that in order to pay legal costs and the
agreed-to settlement, he and his wife have exhausted their life
savings and been forced to take out a second mortgage on their
home. His attorney estimates the settlement and defense costs will
total well over $100,000.
<p>
   Some career EPA scientists see Long's ordeal as much more than
one man's fight to save his reputation. The charges against him
grew out of a wide-ranging investigation of several EPA research
laboratories by the EPA Office of Inspector General (IG), the
agency's internal ``watchdog'' organization.
<p>
   The case and others growing out of the IG probe raised a raft of
thorny public policy issues, including the direction of the
agency's scientific programs and the level of expertise expected
and encouraged at EPA.
<p>
   ``EPA scientists and their front-line managers received brutal
treatment during IG investigations that federal hearing examiners
subsequently ruled were carried out in bad faith,'' said EPA
microbiologist David Lewis, also of Athens.
<p>
   During the IG's investigations of EPA labs, dozens of scientists
were interrogated, and some were threatened with criminal charges.
Several were fired, suspended or demoted  &MD;  only to be reinstated
when actions against them were appealed. In some cases, the
government was ordered to pay their attorney fees.
<p>
   A relatively new federal agency, EPA has failed to establish a
reputation as an outstanding scientific organization. A chorus of
complaints about the agency's science has been led primarily by
regulated industry, especially chemical manufacturers. However,
university researchers, environmentalists and even some EPA
managers have charged that scientific achievement at the agency is
stagnant.
<p>
   Five years ago, an independent panel convened by
then-Administrator William K. Reilly concluded that EPA had
provided ``insufficient incentives to reward the production of
high-quality science.''
<p>
   Its report stated, ``The panel strongly recommends that the
agency expand opportunities for rotations that allow scientists
from other organizations to work in EPA's science programs and EPA
scientists to participate in the scientific efforts of other
organizations.''
<p>
   Long's co-workers, who have raised $3,300 in a legal defense
fund for him, say he is an honest and dedicated government worker,
whose career and savings were laid waste by a ruthless effort to
find examples of ``fraud, waste and abuse'' in government.
<p>
   Ironically, it was his attempt to broaden his expertise that
caused him to run afoul of the controversial investigation by
Inspector General John Martin, who launched probes of the Athens
lab and several others while under stinging criticism in Congress
for allegedly failing to more vigorously expose examples of fraud,
waste and abuse at EPA.
<p>
   To allay criticism from a House subcommittee, Martin rewrote the
criteria under which his top investigators received their annual
federal employee job performance evaluations. The new standards
pressured them to produce indictments, administrative action or
civil lawsuits in at least 25 percent of the cases they supervised.
<p>
   They were awarded extra ``points'' when one of their cases
attracted the interest of a member of Congress or got publicity for
Martin's office.
<p>
   IG investigators charged that beginning in 1989, Long
manipulated bureaucratic processes to obtain benefits to which he
was not entitled  &MD;  the Ph.D. degree  &MD;  at taxpayers' expense.
<p>
   Long, who joined the Athens laboratory in 1975, applied in 1988
for a training program under which EPA sponsors a limited number of
employees for postgraduate studies. He was turned down.
<p>
   He said that Rose Marie Russo, director of the Athens
laboratory, then directed him to prepare the paperwork to have
himself temporarily detailed to Montana State to do the research he
had proposed in the detection of extremely low levels of
pollutants.
<p>
   Court records show that Martin's office recommended that Long be
indicted over the Ph.D. degree, but that a U.S. attorney in Macon,
Ga., declined to take the case because it did not involve ``drugs
or guns and a bunch of peanut farmers'' on a Georgia grand jury
would not understand it.
<p>
   The failure to get an indictment did not end the IG's interest
in Mac Long, however.
<p>
   On the night of Nov. 9, 1994, two IG investigators knocked on
the front door of Long's home in Athens. They handed him a letter
advising him that the U.S. attorney in Billings, Mont., intended to
file a civil lawsuit against him for $117,317.83, the amount the
investigators had concluded the government paid in salary, tuition
and other expenses involved in the degree.
<p>
   Investigator Lorraine Fairchild later recalled in a court
deposition that as Long stared at the letter, she asked him to
engage laboratory director Russo in a secretly recorded telephone
conversation aimed at implicating the lab director in the case.
<p>
   Long refused. The Montana U.S. attorney filed the lawsuit on
Dec. 13, 1994, charging that Long had manipulated the EPA grant
process to set up his own Ph.D. program at government expense. That
amounted to ``unjust enrichment'' and fraud against the government,
the suit declared.
<p>
   Martin retired this month, coincidentally on almost the exact
day the lawsuit against Long was being closed. A few weeks before
leaving the job, he said in an interview that the probe by his
office of agency research laboratories, and of scientists such as
Mac Long, had identified numerous management problems that needed
to be corrected.
<p>
   He said the effort by his investigators to get people such as
Long to surreptitiously tape-record staged conversations with their
superiors was a respected and commonly used law enforcement
technique.
<p>
   For his part, Martin refused a request that the interview be
tape-recorded.
<p>
   He said the pressure placed on his supervising investigators to
produce ``criminal and/or administrative action'' against the
people they investigate was ``a sort of incentive program.''
<p>
   He said extra points are awarded for cases that attract
publicity because of the importance of letting EPA employees
``realize that we do find wrongdoing and that when we do we
aggressively pursue it.''
<p>
   But the series of audits and investigations of the EPA
laboratories has sent a different message, some scientists say.
<p>
   ``These labs bore the brunt of the IG thing,'' said Sam
Karickhoff, a research chemist at the Athens lab, adding that the
investigations provoked ``a lot of paranoia'' among scientists.
<p>
   ``It appeared to me that the IG people came, at least to our
lab, with a preconceived idea of guilt and an agenda to prove their
preconceived notions,'' said Robert Swank, director of research at
the 70-employee laboratory. ``I think the results have been a major
negative impact on morale and productivity.''
<p>
   Late last year, the government offered to drop all charges if
Long would pay the reduced sum of $24,000.
<p>
   Stanley Kaleczyc, Long's Montana lawyer, said the expense of
going to trial would probably add more than that to Long's legal
bills. Kaleczyc advised his client to accept the settlement offer.
<p>
   Long said he decided he and his wife could fight no longer, so
he agreed to the settlement.
<p>
   ``Prior to this, the only black marks on my record were two
speeding tickets,'' he said. ``We have both suffered an enormous
physical, emotional, financial disaster. It was a terrible
injustice that decent, honest, hard-working people should not have
had to endure.''

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- House construction in the
U.S. enjoyed a banner year in 1996, posting the strongest gain in
eight years, though snow, flooding and mud slides in the West
depressed December building activity, new figures showed today.
<p>
   Starts of new houses last year rose 8.8 percent to 1.474
million, the highest level since 1988. The increase was fueled by a
dip in 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates below 7 percent early
in the year and a pickup in economic activity in the fourth
quarter.
<p>
   As new year begins, the housing market seems poised to remain
vigorous, even if it doesn't match last year's pace. ``Economic
growth in December and early January was moderate in most parts of
the country,'' according to a regional economic survey released
today by the Federal Reserve.
<p>
   Though the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' of pressure building
for higher wages, the central bank still found no evidence of
accelerating consumer prices except for energy costs.
<p>
   Analysts and investors viewed the reports as further signs the
Fed can leave interest rates unchanged at the next meeting of the
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee Feb. 4-5.
<p>
   ``The economy is very strong, even though there are some minor
slowdowns to look at,'' said said Russell Sheldon, an economist at
the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
<p>
   The Fed report is likely to be ``comforting'' for investors,
said James Padinha, an economist at MMS International in San
Francisco, because it doesn't point to wage pressures or other
worrisome signs of inflation.
<p>
   In financial markets, though, the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond slumped after the government's auction of about $17 billion in
two-year notes. The bond fell 1/2 point in late New York trading,
pushing up the yield more than 4 basis points to 6.82 percent.
Stocks, meantime, were mixed, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 43 points on weak earnings reports. The dollar rose against
other major currencies.
<p>
   Builders and analysts said the unexpectedly large 12.2 percent
decline in December starts, following a revised 9.3 percent
increase in November, doesn't mean the bottom has fallen out of the
housing market.
<p>
   ``We have relatively stable interest rates, and the highest
housing affordability in a long time,'' said Joel Rassman, chief
financial officer for Toll Brothers Inc., a Huntington Valley,
Pennsylvania, company that builds houses in 13 Eastern states.
<p>
   High levels of consumer confidence and job creation, plus rising
incomes and still-low mortgage rates, lead builders to expect a
strong year, though few expect this year's level of starts to top
1996.
<p>
   ``I'm rather optimistic about 1997 now that it's arrived --much
more optimistic than I was six or seven months ago,'' said Robert
Strudler, chief executive officer of U.S. Home Corp. in Houston.
Added Leonard Miller, chairman of Miami-based Lennar Corp.: ``You
see no major buildup of inventories in the industry.''
<p>
   December Starts Decline
<p>
   In December, alone, all regions of the country reported a drop
in new starts as the monthly rate fell to 1.329 million, adjusted
for seasonal variations -- the lowest since June 1995, according to
the Commerce Department. The flood-ravaged West was especially hard
hit. Analysts had expected a 2.8 percent decline for December
instead of the 12.2 percent drop reported.
<p>
   Meanwhile, permits for new housing construction fell 0.6 percent
nationwide in December to an annual rate of 1.410 million, rate
after increasing 4.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department
said.
<p>
   By category, single-family housing construction dropped 11.8
percent during December while multi-family projects declined 13.6
percent from a month earlier.
<p>
   By region last month, housing starts plunged 29.2 percent in the
West to a rate of 257,000; dropped 7.9 percent in the Midwest to
302,000; fell 7.2 percent in the South to 645,000; and declined 2.3
percent in the Northeast to 125,000.
<p>
   Though bad weather played a role in December's showing, that's
not entirely unexpected since home building usually ``winds down in
the winter months'' said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``We're going to see a
pickup in housing starts when the weather clears,'' said Carl
Palash, chief economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
<p>
   And with mortgage rates still at historically low levels, starts
``should be relatively robust'' in 1997, perhaps reaching a total
of 1.38 million, Brown said.
<p>
   At Dallas-based Centex Corp., one of the nation's largest home
builders and mortgage originators, spokeswoman Sheila Gallagher
said by the end of the company's fiscal year in March, Centex will
have built and delivered about 12,500 new homes, but that the total
will likely drop to 12,000 for the fiscal year ending March 1998.
After marching higher over several months, the average rate on a
30-year fixed loan fell to 7.60 percent in December from 7.62
percent in November, according to Bloomberg analytics.
<p>
   That put the average principal and interest payment on a
$100,000 loan at $706.07 last month, down from $707.45 a month
before. Those figures don't include tax, fire insurance or escrow
costs.
<p>
   In the most recent week, the average 30-year mortgage rate rose
2 basis points to 7.87 percent.
<p>
   The next move in home construction -- and sales -- will be
plainly evident when the weather turns milder in a few months.
<p>
   ``The real question is when does the consumer decide that the
time (to buy) is now,'' said Ira Norris, president of INCO Homes in
Upland, California. `I think people need to believe that housing
prices are on the rise before they buy, and right now the urgency
is not there.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN ANTONIO  &MD;  Where in the world is the ``Selena'' movie world
premiere to be? Will there even be a star-studded world premiere?
<p>
   Movie representatives frantically dodged those questions this
week, denying reports that the film would premiere not in Texas,
where the late Tejano music superstar lived, but in Miami.
<p>
   The prospect outraged Selena's many fans here.
<p>
   Selena Quintanilla Perez, a musical icon for Latin Americans and
Spanish speakers in the United States, rose to fame in San Antonio
and other parts of South Texas. Her brief career ended tragically
when she was shot to death by a disgruntled ex-employee in Corpus
Christi, Texas in 1995.
<p>
   ``Selena,'' a major motion picture about her life, is slated to
open nationwide March 21.
<p>
   The controversy started Saturday when the San Antonio
Express-News reported that the movie would premiere in 14 cities,
with a world premiere featuring the movie's major stars in Miami
March 18.
<p>
   The story was based on information provided by Bert Quintanilla,
marketing director of Q Productions, the Corpus Christi-based
talent and booking agency run by Selena's father, Abraham
Quintanilla.
<p>
   The story quoted a representative from Esparza-Katz Productions,
makers of the movie, who said plans were ``still evolving; anything
could change.''
<p>
   The news touched off criticism from disappointed Selena fans in
South Texas who were surprised by the Miami choice.
<p>
   It also triggered angry phone calls to the newspaper from the
movie's producers and representatives of Q Productions.
<p>
   Moctesuma Esparza, producer of ``Selena,'' said there are no
firm premiere dates, ``nor have we finalized the selection of
cities or what we're going to do in any of the cities.
<p>
   ``Our intention is to have a fabulous celebration there in South
Texas, as well as in all of the United States. Our intention is to
take the celebration of this beautiful movie of Selena's life to
all of her fans and to share this with everyone. But we will
definitely have a gala celebration in South Texas,'' Esparza said.
<p>
   Esparza called the list ``an internal document'' and didn't seem
too keen about the word ``premiere.''
<p>
   ``This will be a movie with multiple premieres,'' he said. ``I
don't know that we'll even call them that, because it's becoming a
misunderstanding over nothing.''
<p>
   But fans didn't seem to misunderstand the possibility that Miami
could be the site of the film's biggest opening event.
<p>
   ``People thought they should show the movie here or in Corpus
first,'' said Richard Pena of pioneering Tejano radio station KEDA.
<p>
   A ``Selena'' press junket to which movie critics are invited
also is slated for early March in Miami.
<p>
   ``We're going to be doing a press junket throughout the United
States,'' Esparza said. ``Miami is one of the towns we'll hit, yes.
We hope to visit Miami. There are many national shows that are
based out of Miami, just like there are national shows based out of
New York. We'll visit New York. We'll obviously do a press junket
in L.A., as well as in San Antonio. Our intention is to celebrate
this movie everywhere that we can.''
<p>
   A representative of Warner Bros., the film's distributor, who
declined to give her name for publication, was firm about plans
still being in development.
<p>
   ``There are no concrete plans,'' she said.
<p>
   Esparza says dates will be finalized ``in a matter of days, we
hope,'' he said Monday. ``There are many different people's
schedules that we have to take into consideration, many different
normal logistical issues. It's the sort of thing that's not news.
You just announce when you're ready for it.''
<p>
   When the list was provided to the Express-News by Bert
Quintanilla, he said the information about premiere showings was
provided by Warner Bros.
<p>
   Quintanilla has since said he didn't give the newspaper
permission to release the information.
<p>
   ``To be honest with you, I didn't read the story, so I can't
really comment on it,'' Quintanilla said Monday. ``I just know that
I was telling (the reporter) not to run with it until it's
official. Everything is up in the air. What you guys are talking
about is just discussion pieces that may or could have or could
have not come out. We didn't know. We still don't know.''
<p>
   Separately, Esparza expressed dismay about a quote in the
original story from Howard Cohen, a music critic from the Miami
Herald.
<p>
   ``The story stated that we were going to have the world premiere
in Miami,'' Esparza said. ``And it went on to quote a local Miami
music person saying he didn't understand why it should be done
there because Selena was not anywhere near the stature of Gloria
Estefan, which I thought was real mean-spirited that such a quote
would even be included in the story.''

   Montreal, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Montreal Canadiens recalled
wing David Ling from their American Hockey League affiliate in
Fredericton, New Brunswick, two days after Benoit Brunet broke his
hand.
<p>
   Ling, 22, was Fredericton's second-leading scorer with 16 goals,
25 assists and 154 penalty minutes in 33 games this season. He had
also played in two games with the Canadiens earlier this season
before being sent to Fredericton on Jan. 15.
<p>
   The 5-foot-9, 185-pound Ling was acquired in a trade with the
Calgary Flames in exchange for center Scott Fraser on Oct. 25. He
had two assists and 19 penalty minutes in five games with the
Flames' AHL affiliate in Saint John, New Brunswick, before the
trade.
<p>
   Brunet, a left wing, broke his left hand in Monday's game
against the Detroit Red Wings.

<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Tosco Corp. stock
sank on the report of an explosion at one of its refineries last
night, then recovered on better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings, analysts said.
<p>
   Trading was halted briefly on the New York Stock Exchange, and
Tosco shares fell as much as 2 to 89 1/8 after trading resumed
early this morning. By late afternoon, shares were up 3/8 at 91
1/2. Though poor refining and marketing results pulled down
fourth-quarter earnings by 11 percent from a year ago, analysts had
expected worse. Earnings were 67 cents a share, and a consensus of
17 analysts polled by First Call Corp. had predicted 63 cents.
<p>
   ``Earnings were clearly secondary to the situation on the West
Coast with respect to performance of the stock'' early in the day,
said Morgan Stanley analyst Douglas T. Terreson. ``There were some
concerns they would have capacity off the market for some time.''
<p>
   Tosco, the largest operator of convenience stores in the nation,
will be the sixth-largest U.S. refiner after it completes the $1.8
billion purchase of Unocal Corp.'s refineries and gas stations it
announced in November. The company will sell fuel through 5,300 gas
stations and convenience stores nationwide, and be the
third-largest refiner on the West Coast.
<p>
   The explosion took place yesterday at Tosco's 150,000 barrel a
day Avon refinery in Martinez, California, in the San Francisco Bay
area. The company said one worker was killed and 25 injured.
Traders said Tosco had to shut down a hydrocracking unit that makes
gasoline and diesel fuel. West Coast wholesale gasoline prices rose
as a result.
<p>
   Still, Terreson said the portion of the refinery affected by the
explosion represents 3-4 percent of Tosco earnings.
<p>
   ``The worst case is not so bad, and the company is fully
insured,'' he said. ``As that information began being fed into the
market, investors became more comfortable with the stock and began
to buy it.''
<p>
   The company reported that fourth-quarter net income fell to
$30.2 million, or 67 cents, from $33.8 million, or 90 cents. The
per-share drop reflects both the drop in profit and an increase in
Tosco's outstanding shares.
<p>
   Tosco issued shares as part of its $750 million acquisition of
the Circle K Corp. convenience store chain in May. Tosco had 44.9
million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter compared with 37.6
million last year.
<p>
   ``The earnings were fine,'' said Terreson. ``Our estimate was 65
cents a share so it was slightly better than expectations.
Operating results were strong.''
<p>
   Thomas D. O'Malley, Tosco's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, said in a statement that ``refining and marketing margins
were weak throughout the quarter due to the industry's inability to
pass higher crude oil costs on to the consumer. Cold weather in the
East helped Tosco's Bayway Refinery to a certain degree, but
conditions on the West Coast were weak.''
<p>
   Terreson said Morgan Stanley thinks Tosco's stock has continued
room for growth. ``We have a 110 price target for Tosco by 1997,''
he said.

<p>
   Farewell to Arms,'' Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece about a
doomed World War I romance, is one of American literature's most
enduring classics. Since it was first published in 1929, it has
sold steadily, even during the 60s, after the author's death, when
his literary fascination with violence caused his other works'
popularity to drop.
<p>
   Scholars have long known that the novel was based in part on
Hemingway's romance with Agnes von Kurowsky, a pretty, coquettish
American nurse whom he met after being wounded on the Italian front
while working as a volunteer for the American Red Cross.
<p>
   At 26, von Kurowsky was seven years older than Hemingway. Still,
Hemingway had hoped to marry her. He was devastated when she
rejected him after the war, addressing him as ``kid'' in a Dear
John letter and saying she was fond of him ``more as a mother than
a sweetheart.''
<p>
   The effect of the relationship on Hemingway's life and career
has intrigued scholars for years. The details of the wartime
romance, however, remain obscured, primarily by the differing
accounts of the two lovers. In later years, von Kurowsky insisted
it had been an innocent flirtation, while Hemingway maintained
they'd had a sexual affair.
<p>
   Now a new movie, ``In Love and War,'' which opened on Friday,
claims to reveal the true story. This $40 million soap opera is not
likely to resolve the mystery, but it does prove that the Hemingway
myth is alive and well.
<p>
   Directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Chris O'Donnell as
Hemingway and Sandra Bullock as von Kurowsky, it's based on the
nurse's World War I diary and letters, extraordinary documents that
came into the film maker's hands by a turn of fate.
<p>
   The fact that the movie got made at all is due to the producer
Dimitri Villard's father, Henry Serrano Villard, who befriended
Hemingway and von Kurowsky during World War I. Like Hemingway,
Villard was a volunteer for the Red Cross ambulance service and he
was treated for hepatitis at the Milan hospital where von Kurowsky
was posted. At the time, his father was unaware of ``Ag and
Ernie's'' attachment, says Dimitri Villard, though ``he once saw
them holding hands'' in a way that suggested ``Agnes wasn't taking
Hemingway's pulse.''
<p>
   Villard lost touch with the couple after the war. Then, in 1961,
soon after Hemingway's suicide, Carlos Baker, the writer's
biographer, contacted Villard and gave him von Kurowsky's address.
He corresponded with the former nurse, who was now married and
living in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway also had lived.
<p>
   Later, at von Kurowsky's urging, Villard used his influence as a
former American ambassador (to Libya, Senegal and Mauritania) to
win permission for her to be buried at the National Cemetery in
Arlington, Va. After her death at 92 in 1984, her husband, in
gratitude, sent her diary and letters to Villard ``out of the blue
one day,'' says his son.
<p>
   Henry S. Villard (who died last year) and James Nagel, a
Hemingway expert who teaches literature at the University of
Georgia, published the material in a 1989 book, ``Hemingway in Love
and War.'' In a painstakingly-researched essay, Nagel wrote that
von Kurowsky returned home a virgin.
<p>
   But in the film, the couple consummate their affair at a
flophouse on the Italian front. As they undress and fall into an
embrace, a dreamy Italian melody wafts through the open window
mixed with chatter of prostitutes. ``Oh, Aggie, it wasn't supposed
to be like this. We were going to be in the most beautiful place on
God's earth,'' says O'Donnell's character. ``Never mind ... close
your eyes,'' his nurse whispers back.
<p>
   This sentimental scene has no basis in fact, though Dimitri
Villard says it's in the ``spirit'' of the truth; he is convinced
that the couple consummated their love. ``Agnes's letters are so
passionate it's hard to believe there wasn't a relationship between
the two,'' he says.
<p>
   ``Kid, my kid,'' von Kurowsky wrote Hemingway on Sept. 25, 1918.
``I've just been in your room, and talk about chairs that whisper!
That whole room haunted me so that I could not stay in it.'' And on
Oct. 17, she wrote, ``I guess every girl likes to have some man
tell her ... he can't do without her. Anyway, I am but human, and
when you say these things I love it and can't help but believe you
so don't be afraid I'll get tired of you. I haven't really started
to worry yet over your forgetting to love me as you do now.''
<p>
   But these musings  &MD;  written after the two were separated first
by a trip he took to Stresa, then by her transfer to a hospital in
Florence  &MD;  are in sharp contrast to the tart entries in her diary
written not long before.
<p>
   ``Now Ernest Hemingway has a crush on me or thinks he has,'' she
wrote on Aug. 25. And in other typical passages, she wrote,
``Ernest Hemingway ... is far too fond of me and speaks in such a
desperate way every time I am cool, that I dare not damper his
ardor as long as he is here in the hospital. Poor kid, I am sorry
for him.''
<p>
   Still, the idea of a torrid affair between the teen-ager from
Oak Park, Ill., and the shapely auburn-haired nurse, fits the myth
of Hemingway as an icon of male prowess  &MD;  hunter, drinker, fighter,
writer and lover.
<p>
   Perhaps that's why the myth of the affair persists in the mostly
male world of Hemingway scholarship, and why it has led to some
outlandish speculation. In his 1987 biography, ``Hemingway,''
Kenneth S. Lynn, then a professor at Johns Hopkins University,
described in detail the couple's lovemaking, even the position they
preferred.

<p>
   The known facts, however, suggest that the romance was entirely
innocent. Indeed, the only evidence of their possible intimacy was
von Kurowsky's hairpin, which was found by another nurse under
Hemingway's pillow. And, of course, the writer's own boasting in
letters to friends. But, as Nagel points out about Hemingway's
correspondence, ``there's a long series of letters during this
period that we know to be phony,'' in the sense that Hemingway
bragged or embellished the truth. One letter, for instance,
announced his engagement to Mae Marsh, the once-celebrated but
now-forgotten silent film star.
<p>
   Von Kurowsky herself denied having slept with Hemingway. ``Let's
get it straight  &MD;  please,'' she told Henry S. Villard, ``I wasn't
(italics)that(end italics) kind of girl.''
<p>
   But in fact what happened is less important than the emotional
aftermath of the experience for Hemingway  &MD;  the effect it had on
his relationships with women and the portrayal of women in his
fiction.
<p>
   The film's love scenes may not be historically accurate, but
they capture what Attenborough says is a mood of emotional
intensity, and this is ``the heart of the matter.''
<p>
   ``Do you think if they'd gotten married and had children that he
would have been the same writer?'' Attenborough asks. ``Do you
think the anger and frustration and humiliation he suffered in his
belly for so many years in regard to being turned down, which drove
him and fired him, would still be there?''
<p>
   Perhaps not. It's clear Hemingway continued throughout his life
to draw on von Kurowsky in creating his heroines. The book von
Kurowsky is best known for inspiring is ``A Farewell to Arms.'' As
anyone who has taken a college literature course (or seen the 1932
movie starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes, or the less interesting
1957 movie with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones) knows, it tells the
tragic love story of Catherine Barkley, an alluring British nurse,
and Frederic Henry, an American lieutenant in the Italian Army, who
deserts his unit.
<p>
   The war setting and the lovers' occupations draw on Hemingway's
experience but there are vast differences between real life and the
novel. Among other things, Catherine dies after giving birth to a
stillborn son.
<p>
   Before making the movie, Attenborough asked O'Donnell and Ms.
Bullock not to read ``A Farewell to Arms'' because he didn't want
their portrayals to be influenced by Hemingway's fictional
characters. Von Kurowsky's diary reveals her to be stalwart,
somewhat insensitive and emotionally reserved.
<p>
   In contrast, Catherine Barkley, like most of Hemingway's
heroines, is romantic and wounded, damaged by life in some
fundamental way and desperate to escape her unhappy past through
love. In this sense, she more closely resembles Hemingway's first
two wives, the sensitive Hadley Richardson and the passionate
Pauline Pfeiffer. (He wrote the book while married to Pfeiffer.)
<p>
   Still, von Kurowsky was Hemingway's first love and her rejection
triggered his literary preoccupation with romantic loss. In book
after book and story after story, lovers are separated by
misunderstandings, cooled passions, insanity and death.
<p>
   Or, as in ``In Love and War,'' they're parted forever by pride.
``There's still a part of me that wants to take you in my arms ...
but I've changed ... it wouldn't work,'' Hemingway tells von
Kurowsky when she tracks him down at his parents' cottage in
Michigan at the end of Attenborough's movie. In truth, the couple
never saw each other after they left Italy in 1918.
<p>
   ``In a movie you have to make compromises,'' says Nagel, who was
a consultant on the screenplay. ``When they called me and said, `We
think we have to bring them together again,' it made sense to me.
It's unsatisfactory for them not to see each other again, for the
romance to simply fritter away.''
<p>
   At least, he adds, ``they didn't make it a (italis)happy(end
italis) ending.''

   We asked Boy Scout Troop No. 7 in Grapevine, Texas, to
taste-test the new Surge and Josta sodas. In retrospect, this may
not have been the wisest idea.
<p>
   ``We limit the boys to one to two cans of soda on a campout,''
Scoutmaster Dave Creeger said. ``Once we brought a whole truck-load
of sodas and they got so wired, we couldn't control them. So now we
drink a lot of Gatorade.''

<p>
   Surge
<p>

<p>
   Caffeine: 52 milligrams
<p>
   Sugar: 42 grams
<p>
   Comments:
<p>
   ``It reminds me of Gatorade, but it doesn't have an aftertaste.
I don't think a cola drinker would want something like Gatorade.''
 &MD;  Michael Cohen, 12.
<p>
   ``It tastes like a combination of Sprite and Mountain Dew.''  &MD; 
Ryan Akins, 15.
<p>
   ``I like the twang to it.''  &MD;  Matthew Boyle, 14.
<p>
   ``I like the bright color.''  &MD;  Spencer Waller, 12.
<p>
   ``It has a sour taste, but it's likable.''  &MD;  Ross Ponder, 12.
<p>
   ``I like the citrus taste and the green color.''  &MD;  Chris
McNosky, 11.
<p>
   ``I've got a boy addicted to Mountain Dew. This does not make my
heart sing.''  &MD;  Dee McNosky, mother of Chris. 
<p>
   Josta
<p>
   Made by: Pepsi
<p>
   Secret ingredient: Guarana berry, a natural stimulant
<p>
   Caffeine: 59 milligrams
<p>
   Sugar: 44 grams
<p>
   Comments:
<p>
   ``I like cream soda, so I like Josta. I like the legend about

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Tightwads take note. Starting
next week, individual investors in the U.S. can buy stock in Merck
&AMP; Co., the nation's biggest drugmaker, directly from the company.
<p>
   Just send Merck an enrollment form and a check for at least
$350, plus a $10 enrollment fee. At Merck's current price of about
$88 a share, investors would receive approximately four shares.
<p>
   ``It's no muss, no fuss investing,'' said Charles Carlson, a
certified financial analyst and editor of the No-Load Stock Insider
newsletter. ``It doesn't get much easier.''
<p>
   Or cheaper. Merck is one of about 200 American corporations that
invite investors to buy their shares directly from the companies or
their bank representatives, by passing brokers and brokers'
commissions. Some companies charge between $10 and $15 to set up an
account, a dollar or two for each transaction, or a fee only when
an investor sells their stock. Other companies charge nothing at
all.
<p>
   In the end, it still represents a big savings from what brokers
charge. The brokerage fee for buying 100 shares or less of Merck
ranges from $29.95 to $55 at discount broker Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
depending on whether an investor uses a broker, the Internet or
other services. Full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
charge more.
<p>
   As with most plans, investors can buy more shares with all or
part of Merck's 40 cents-a-share quarterly dividend, make weekly
purchases of between $50 and $50,000, or can have monthly
investments of at least $50 wired out of their bank checking
accounts. If when these services come with fees attached they
remain much less costly than using a broker.
<p>
   Spurred by favorable Securities and Exchange Commission rulings
in late 1994, the number of companies that sell their shares
directly to investors has exploded. Each month a dozen or more
companies are starting direct-purchase programs. Carlson estimates
that within two years, between 500 and 1,000 companies will offer
the option.
<p>
   The list of companies already includes such blue chips as
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., McDonald's Corp., Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp., and Texaco Inc. -- all part of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, along with Merck.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. runs a program allowing individual investors
in the U.S. to buy American depository receipts of more than 40
foreign companies.
<p>
   A couple of years ago, there were only about 50 companies
offering direct stock sales, and the list was dominated by
slow-growing electric utilities.
<p>
   Now, the roster has grown more exciting. It includes First USA
Inc., the nation's third-largest credit-card issuer, which Banc One
Corp. of Columbus, Ohio offered to buy earlier this week for stock
valued at about $7 billion. First USA has made its stock available
to investors who call a toll-free number to request an application
and prospectus, and then mail back a check for purchases of as
little as $1,000.
<p>
   The lag between when an order is placed and when it is executed
draws attention to one of direct investing's drawbacks: speed. The
process generally two weeks or more. And the stock's price can
change significantly in either direction during the that period.
<p>
   There's only one fixed price for a stock on any given day using
direct investment, so there's no way of knowing what exact price
will be paid or received. On Jan. 2, for instance, First USA shares
on the New York Stock Exchange traded between $32.75 and $34.625
before ending at $33.
<p>
   If an investor plans on holding a stock for several years, minor
price changes will matter little, however. And many companies are
getting faster, executing trades daily, once a week or every two
weeks instead of once a month or, in some instances, every three
months. Others are offering shareholders an 800 number if they want
to sell. But most companies stick to the slow lane.
<p>
   ``The speed on the buy and sell side is improving,'' Carlson
said, and telephone services are superior to old rules that forced
investors to send written instructions of a sell order.
<p>
   Still, direct investing clearly isn't designed for active
traders.
<p>
   Indeed, one appeal of selling stock directly to investors is
that those investors are more likely to become loyal, long-term
shareholders who support management, says Robert O'Hara, marketing
director for the National Association of Investors Corp. The
non-profit NAIC runs a service that assists investors in buying
stock from about 150 companies for $7 plus the cost of one share.
The group says more than 400,000 investors have used the service in
the past 10 years.
<p>
   A spokesman for First USA said selling stock directly to
shareholders has helped the company broaden its shareholder base a
bit beyond institutional investors.
<p>
   Investors interested in direct purchases have a few options.
<p>
   One is to write or call the ``No-Load Stock Insider'' for a
sample of that newsletter free of charge, at 7412 Calumet Ave.,
Hammond, Indiana 46324; (219) 852-3230. A six-times-a-year
subscription is $33. The newsletter is published by NorthStar
Financial Inc.
<p>
   Investors can obtain an application and prospectus from any one
of about 100 companies that have direct-purchase plans by calling
the Direct Stock Purchase Plan Clearinghouse -- a joint venture
between NorthStar Financial and New York-based Shareholder
Communications Corp. -- at (800) 744-4117. (Companies pay to have
their stocks listed.)
<p>
   Membership in the NAIC costs $39, though there's no obligation
to remain a member after the investment plan has been used.
Contact: NAIC, 711 W. Thirteen Mile Road, Madison Heights, Michigan
48071, or (810) 583-6242.

<p>
   By P.J. HUFFSTUTTER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Artist Pae White needed help plugging in her
palette.
<p>
   Though savvy with computers, the Pasadena-based designer and
visual artist wanted to find new methods for blending her own
digital paintings with fetish images she pulled from the Internet.
<p>
   ``I was working on the theme of travel billboards and I wanted
the final prints to have that same feel,'' said White, 33. ``I just
didn't have the computer equipment to do it.''
<p>
   Enter Muse X Editions, a Universal City publisher that offers an
innovative mix of high-tech and high concept. Formed about 18
months ago, Muse X aims to blend the latest in digital technology
with the art world's experimental ideals.
<p>
   The concept evolved out of company President Randall Green's
passion for multimedia art. For six years, Green focused his
energies on Electronic Publishing Specialists Inc., Muse X's parent
company, which does print work for graphic artists and the movie
industry. Over time, he realized that the technology he used with
his film clients could be adapted to help visual artists explore
their creative boundaries.
<p>
   ``The overlap seemed obvious,'' Green said. ``The realization
came at a time when many fine art figures in L.A. were just
beginning to be curious about computers. They were artists who
wanted to work on digital projects, but without any technical
experience.''
<p>
   Indeed, the selection of equipment and tech-savvy staff
tantalizes artists to spend hours inside the tiny shop, tucked on a
quiet corner along Cahuenga Boulevard West in Universal City. Among
the 30-plus creative figures to tap the printing house are Barbara
Kasten and Oliver Wasow, known for their other-worldly landscapes;
Victor Raphael and his futuristic vision of inner and outer space;
Pauline Stella Sanchez and Jennifer Steinkamp and their abstract
compositions; and Kevin Hanley and his conceptual photograph and
video works.
<p>
   The four-person staff does handle more traditional  &MD;  and
labor-intensive  &MD;  techniques like platinum/palladium printing, a
process that produces long-lasting color. But its emphasis,
staffers say, is on electronics.
<p>
   Because of this, the printing house has slowly earned a name in
the Los Angeles art scene as the best place for young artists to
play with expensive computer equipment: a high-end scanner, and
several Macintoshes with multimedia and editing software.
<p>
   ``They have gear that no one else has,'' said Hanley, 27, a
photographer and computer artist who lives in Los Feliz. ``They pay
attention to inks, to archiving and to color. And it's one of the
few places in L.A. that has an Iris printer.''
<p>
   According to Charles Leavitt, the firm's production manager and
artist liaison, the Iris handles the bulk of Muse X's artistic
load. The highly specialized printer sprays watercolor inks through
tiny nozzles onto plastic (Mylar), fabric (velvet) or paper
(watercolor, Japanese rice paper). The process produces more detail
and finer tonal range in different colors than other digital
printers.
<p>
   The result produces intense colors with a soft, watercolor-like
texture.
<p>
   Artist Dani Tull uses this electronic technique to imitate
classic watercolor painting styles.
<p>
   In his piece ``Together We Can Homogenate,'' a couple stand
romantically silhouetted against a richly hued sunset. Those who
peer at the print see delicate brush lines of color bleeding
between the reddened sky and yellow sun.
<p>
   ``In every case of every artist we work with, the artists either
create the art and we scan it to create a digital file, or they
create the images directly on the computer,'' Leavitt said.
<p>
   Tull used a PC to create the image and the Iris to print it.
<p>
   Others prefer to tap the computer as a tool for delicate
modifications. Using photo editing software, Hanley takes a single
pixel of color from a picture and expands it. From that, a shade
once hidden in the shadows can now alter the emotional impact of
the image.

<p>
   He opted for this approach in ``Dutch Occupation Green,'' a
blurred shot of a woman walking away from the photographer.
<p>
   Alone, the picture elicits a sense of melancholy. But with the
fusion of a colored border, the image provokes conflicting feelings
of warm passion and distant coolness.
<p>
   ``It's like the first time you hear a Joy Division song. You're
surprised that anything can be highly emotional and mechanical at
the same time,'' Hanley said. ``I've always used digital gear to
create these feelings in my visual art.''
<p>
   While the end product  &MD;  a limited edition of prints  &MD;  remains
the same, the electronic publishing tools let Muse X trim its
production costs. Traditional print shops often use silk-screening,
lithography or etching as a means of reproducing a work, said
Leavitt. When an artist agrees to release a limited edition of a
particular piece, these houses make all of the prints at once. The
artist then examines each copy and signs off those meeting
approval.
<p>
   If the ink smudges or a color is slightly off, the flawed print
is tossed. And copies that have not been sold in advance must be
stored.
<p>
   ``The cost is usually prohibitive. I know of one-time editions
running up to $50,000, what with the time and labor and cost of
supplies,'' Leavitt said. ``Because all of our projects are stored
digitally, we don't have to devote the same resources to a single
run.''
<p>
   Instead, Muse X prints a single copy of the work. Once the
artist approves it, the staff stores the image on a disk. Then, the
company prints only as many copies as the artist sells or needs for
exhibitions.
<p>
   ``We can do multiple prints at multiple times and the quality of
the prints will always remain the same,'' said Jane Hart, director
of the company's publications. ``We don't have to worry about
whether the inks will match. That's the beauty of working with
digital tools. They're always consistent.''

   Characters are identified with subtitles, and it is hard to tell
who are the real Oregonians and who are actors. But when the
subtitle introduces coach Bill Dellinger, and he is Ed O'Neill from
television's ``Married ... With Children,'' that's when you know
it's Hollywood.
<p>
   ``The use of archival footage, home movies, all of these allowed
us to tell a bigger story without having to re-create every
element,'' James says.
<p>
   Some of the most inspiring moments in ``Prefontaine'' are the
old washed-out film clips of Pre himself pounding the track like a
stallion.
<p>
   ``It's a constant reminder that this is a real story,'' says
James, who was not afraid to show Pre's face for all to see that he
was more ruggedly handsome than Jared Leto, the actor who portrays
him. Although the resemblance is uncanny, Leto's baby face is too
smooth to be messed up with a floppy mustache and mutton chops. But
he wears plastic-cloth '70s styles very well, and unlike most
actors who attempt sports, he can actually run and not look clumsy.
His stride is amazingly similar to Pre's, and Leto can turn a
quarter-mile in a minute flat.
<p>
   In ``Pre,'' the runner will be played by Billy Crudup, who is a
little slower than Leto but exactly Pre's height, at 5 foot 9.
Cruise considered taking the role himself, but he's shorter than
Crudup.
<p>
   The secondary role is Bill Bowerman, the salty Oregon and
Olympic track coach. Originally a consultant on ``Prefontaine,''
Bowerman switched to ``Pre,'' then threatened to sue Disney if it
featured him in its film. In ``Pre,'' he will be portrayed by
Donald Sutherland. In ``Prefontaine,'' he is R. Lee Ermey, who was
in ``Full Metal Jacket'' and ``Dead Man Walking.''
<p>
   A subplot is that Bowerman was always using his wife's waffle
iron to design a more durable shoe. Bowerman's invention turns out
to be a prototype Nike. One of Pre's many theatrical gestures is
his tearing off the gimmicky Nike swoosh before wearing the shoes.
<p>
   That was just like Pre. Even his fourth-place finish at the
Olympics was dramatic, when he sprinted for the glory and fell
short. Strategically, he could have positioned himself for a silver
or bronze. But Pre would never have stood on a lower step.
<p>
   He was golden all the way.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The bad news about the market
is all true.
<p>
   Corporate profits don't have a prayer of meeting expectations,
interest rates are rising and stocks, especially those in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, are overpriced. These concerns have
stalked the market along its record run of the past two years --
and for all the menace, few stocks have turned tail. Traditional
measures of market value aren't what's driving stocks these days,
investors say.
<p>
   ``Step back and take a look at the big picture: The demand for
stocks outpaces supply, and we don't see any real competition out
there,'' said Robert Turner, president of Turner Investment
Partners, which oversees $2.4 billion.
<p>
   More people want to buy than sell stocks because they see them
as the only place to beat the low-single-digit returns offered in
savings accounts.
<p>
   Bonds might lure investors if benchmark 30-year Treasury yields
rose above 8 percent and stayed there. From Oct. 19 to Nov. 23,
1994, stocks fell 6.5 percent as yields rose to 8.16 percent.
That's a far cry from the current 6.78 percent, though.
<p>
   The lack of alternatives to stocks goes a long way toward
explaining how the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 32
percent in the past year without a similar improvement in the
earnings of member companies such as DuPont Co.
<p>
   It's why $223 billion poured into mutual funds last year,
topping 1995's pace by more than $93 billion.
<p>
   It's why non-U.S. money is entering the country at a rapid clip,
helping drive the U.S. dollar to three-year highs against the
German mark and Japanese yen.
<p>
   Predicting a shift in sentiment isn't easy. Few are willing to
say when the good times could end. The returns of investing are so
great -- the best since the mid-1950s, measured by the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index -- that few are willing to bet on an eventual
reversal.
<p>
   Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School and
a staunch proponent of stock investing, calls the market ``slightly
overvalued'' based on companies' likely earnings during the past
six months and the next six months.
<p>
   Still, that's no reason to sell, he said. ``At the top of bull
markets, it's usually much more overvalued than at current times.''
<p>
   By Siegel's estimate, the Dow can rise as high as 8500 -- a 25
percent gain.
<p>
   For market strategists who expect stock prices to fall when
price-earnings ratios get high, it's like looking at a football box
score to see who won the Yankee game.
<p>
   ``I don't think valuation enters into it,'' said David Shulman,
a stock analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
<p>
   Daily stock market reports attribute the rise in the Dow to
events such as strong profits in member companies such as Eastman
Kodak and General Electric Co. Yet that doesn't explain why DuPont
is the best-performing stock in the Dow industrials this year.
<p>
   In 1996, DuPont's stock climbed 35 percent while earnings rose
18 percent. The shares have tacked on 18 percent this year, even
though 1997 earnings growth is forecast at 7.9 percent.
<p>
   ``I don't think this has much to do with earnings,'' said
Kenneth L. Fisher, president of Fisher Investments, with $1.3
billion under management. ``This has to do with the flow of
funds.''
<p>
   By Fisher's account, investors chase the largest, most liquid
companies because that's where the foreign money goes. DuPont is
rising because its $62.3 billion market capitalization, more than
twice that of the average company in the S&AMP;P 500, makes it easy to
put money in and take money out.
<p>
   Fisher runs a portfolio that buys stocks with market
capitalization at least double that of the average S&AMP;P 500 company.
It has beat the S&AMP;P 500 for three years. ``The only problem with
our style is that it looks dumb,'' he said.
<p>
   Of the perils to stocks, unrealistic expectations for corporate
profits could pose the greatest danger. Analysts expect earnings of
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 Index to expand 14.1 percent in 1997, 81
percent better than 1996's results.
<p>
   That's almost impossible, because earnings growth fell during
the past couple years and the economy is unlikely to grow much
faster than at present.
<p>
   Fortunately for the market, analysts trim their expectations as
the end of each quarter approaches. Expectations for fourth-quarter
profits among S&AMP;P 500 companies in a First Call survey, for
example, initially were for growth of between 13 percent and 14
percent. By quarter's end, analysts whittled those estimates to 8.2
percent, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.
<p>
   That enabled most companies to beat estimates, so far. Interest
rates at current levels aren't much to worry about, either. In
theory, they cut the value of stocks as they rise because higher
rates slow borrowing and expansion.
<p>
   By that rationale, stocks should be below where they were in
September 1993. That's when the yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond was at 5.78 percent, a full percentage point below
its current level.
<p>
   The Dow industrials have almost doubled since then.
<p>
   Even though rates are higher now, they are still low enough so
that all but the most indebted corporations and people can borrow
cheaply, said Gil Knight, director of research at Allied Investment
Advisors.
<p>
   If stocks retreat, slower profit growth or higher interest rates
will take the heat. Just don't give them credit for taking stocks
higher.

compositions; and Kevin Hanley and his conceptual photograph and
video works.
<p>
   The four-person staff does handle more traditional  &MD;  and
labor-intensive  &MD;  techniques like platinum/palladium printing, a
process that produces long-lasting color. But its emphasis,
staffers say, is on electronics.
<p>
   Because of this, the printing house has slowly earned a name in
the Los Angeles art scene as the best place for young artists to
play with expensive computer equipment: a high-end scanner, and
several Macintoshes with multimedia and editing software.
<p>
   ``They have gear that no one else has,'' said Hanley, 27, a
photographer and computer artist who lives in Los Feliz. ``They pay
attention to inks, to archiving and to color. And it's one of the
few places in L.A. that has an Iris printer.''
<p>
   According to Charles Leavitt, the firm's production manager and
artist liaison, the Iris handles the bulk of Muse X's artistic
load. The highly specialized printer sprays watercolor inks through
tiny nozzles onto plastic (Mylar), fabric (velvet) or paper
(watercolor, Japanese rice paper). The process produces more detail
and finer tonal range in different colors than other digital
printers.
<p>
   The result produces intense colors with a soft, watercolor-like
texture.
<p>
   Artist Dani Tull uses this electronic technique to imitate
classic watercolor painting styles.
<p>
   In his piece ``Together We Can Homogenate,'' a couple stand
romantically silhouetted against a richly hued sunset. Those who
peer at the print see delicate brush lines of color bleeding
between the reddened sky and yellow sun.
<p>
   ``In every case of every artist we work with, the artists either
create the art and we scan it to create a digital file, or they
create the images directly on the computer,'' Leavitt said.
<p>
   Tull used a PC to create the image and the Iris to print it.
<p>
   Others prefer to tap the computer as a tool for delicate
modifications. Using photo editing software, Hanley takes a single
pixel of color from a picture and expands it. From that, a shade
once hidden in the shadows can now alter the emotional impact of
the image.

<p>
   The legend of distance runner Steve Prefontaine is big enough
for two movies, and that's how many are coming.
<p>
   Twenty-two years after the death of the maverick Olympian with
the shaggy golden hair and the only suntan in Eugene, Ore.,
Disney's Hollywood Pictures will release ``Prefontaine'' on January
24, followed later this year by ``Pre,'' produced by Tom Cruise for
Warner Bros.
<p>
   Two features, on top of an existing documentary, might seem
excessive for a three-miler who is now little remembered, but
Prefontaine was an American original whose life story rivals James
Dean's.
<p>
   Dean was an actor who looked great playing other people, then
crashed his silver Porsche and died at age 24, on Sept. 30, 1955.
Prefontaine was a swashbuckler who starred in his own movie every
day and looked great doing it right up until the night he flipped
his gold MG and died at age 24, on May 30, 1975. Tests revealed
that he had been legally drunk.
<p>
   Prefontaine had just been named ``the most popular track athlete
in the world'' by Track &AMP; Field News. Hours before his death, he
had won an international race at Hayward Field, his home stadium at
the University of Oregon, with fans chanting, ``Go, Pre.'' He next
appeared as a corpse in a black hearse that slowly circled Hayward
Field while mourners in the stands chanted, ``Go, Pre.''
<p>
   ``They cheered a ghost going around the track,'' says
``Prefontaine'' writer and director Steve James. ``This is one of
those stories that's hard to believe unless you know it to be
true.''
<p>
   James and his partner, co-producer and photography director
Peter Gilbert, have some experience with fact being more compelling
than fiction. They made ``Hoop Dreams,'' the hit high school
basketball documentary.
<p>
   ``I'm a firm believer that with real stories the truth is way
more interesting than whatever poetic license the film might
take,'' James says.
<p>
   With Prefontaine, not much license was necessary. He wasn't just
an athlete who died young; he became a cult figure while still
alive. The Coos Bay kid, who began running when he discovered that
he was too small for team sports, left behind American records in
every race from two miles to six and 2,000 meters to 10,000 meters.
<p>
   His nickname was Pre and it fit. He did things before anyone
else dared, like fighting hypocrisy in the American Olympic
program, which expected U.S. athletes to win without adequate
financial support.
<p>
   The first athlete to wear and endorse Nike, he brought panache
to a sport that previously had captured little public attention,
and helped start the jogging craze that spread from the Northwest
across the country in the early 1970s.
<p>
   ``I don't just go out there and run,'' Prefontaine said. ``I
like to give people watching something exciting.''
<p>
   With the gutsy charm and charisma of Joe Namath, Pre delivered
on his promises until he finished a disastrous fourth in the 5,000
meters in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, after the life had been
snuffed out of the Games by murderous terrorists.
<p>
   ``Dreams don't work out the way you wanted. In that respect,
`Hoop Dreams' and `Prefontaine' have something in common,'' James
says. ``Unless you already know these things about Pre, this film
holds some surprises.''
<p>
   One surprise is that to protect his amateur status, Pre had to
lower his standard of living. His European competitors received
jobs as policemen without having to swing a baton or walk a beat.
Pre had to sling pitchers in a bawdy beer joint in Eugene and live
in a trailer by the railroad tracks.
<p>
   James was unable to portray all this discomfort. When a train
rumbled by, Pre's tin-can home shook, but James didn't have the
money for those kinds of effects. He also had to rewrite his script
when Disney hacked his budget to $8.5 million. He had expected to
spend three times that, which is almost exactly the Cruise-Warner
budget of $25 million.
<p>
   Originally, there was to be just one Pre feature, which sprouted
from a 1995 television documentary called ``Fire on the Track.''
<p>
   Its producers, Jon Lutz and Mark Doonan, wanted to follow that
with a full-length film. But one of the writers  &MD;  Kenny Moore, a
Sports Illustrated reporter who had run at Oregon and been a
teammate of Pre's at the Munich Olympics  &MD;  split off with Robert
Towne, who had written and directed the track movie ``Personal
Best.'' Moore and Towne followed the money to Cruise and Warner
Bros. Lutz and Doonan sold their story to Disney, which hired James
and Gilbert for their feature debut. The race was on.
<p>
   ``What you had were two groups passionate about a story,'' James
says.
<p>
   Warner Bros. had the money and the better title. Disney had the
story rights and exclusive cooperation of Pre's family, teammates
and friends.
<p>
   ``If we believed that money was the final arbiter of quality,
then `Hoop Dreams' would have been a disaster,'' says James, who
made ``Prefontaine'' in more of a docudrama style than he intended.
<p>
   ``Steve is very vivid in these people's minds and he's been dead
over 20 years,'' says James, who decided to tell the story with
interviews.

   He opted for this approach in ``Dutch Occupation Green,'' a
blurred shot of a woman walking away from the photographer.
<p>
   Alone, the picture elicits a sense of melancholy. But with the
fusion of a colored border, the image provokes conflicting feelings
of warm passion and distant coolness.
<p>
   ``It's like the first time you hear a Joy Division song. You're
surprised that anything can be highly emotional and mechanical at
the same time,'' Hanley said. ``I've always used digital gear to
create these feelings in my visual art.''
<p>
   While the end product  &MD;  a limited edition of prints  &MD;  remains
the same, the electronic publishing tools let Muse X trim its
production costs. Traditional print shops often use silk-screening,
lithography or etching as a means of reproducing a work, said
Leavitt. When an artist agrees to release a limited edition of a
particular piece, these houses make all of the prints at once. The
artist then examines each copy and signs off those meeting
approval.
<p>
   If the ink smudges or a color is slightly off, the flawed print
is tossed. And copies that have not been sold in advance must be
stored.
<p>
   ``The cost is usually prohibitive. I know of one-time editions
running up to $50,000, what with the time and labor and cost of
supplies,'' Leavitt said. ``Because all of our projects are stored
digitally, we don't have to devote the same resources to a single
run.''
<p>
   Instead, Muse X prints a single copy of the work. Once the
artist approves it, the staff stores the image on a disk. Then, the
company prints only as many copies as the artist sells or needs for
exhibitions.
<p>
   ``We can do multiple prints at multiple times and the quality of
the prints will always remain the same,'' said Jane Hart, director
of the company's publications. ``We don't have to worry about
whether the inks will match. That's the beauty of working with
digital tools. They're always consistent.''

   Characters are identified with subtitles, and it is hard to tell
who are the real Oregonians and who are actors. But when the
subtitle introduces coach Bill Dellinger, and he is Ed O'Neill from
television's ``Married ... With Children,'' that's when you know
it's Hollywood.
<p>
   ``The use of archival footage, home movies, all of these allowed
us to tell a bigger story without having to re-create every
element,'' James says.
<p>
   Some of the most inspiring moments in ``Prefontaine'' are the
old washed-out film clips of Pre himself pounding the track like a
stallion.
<p>
   ``It's a constant reminder that this is a real story,'' says
James, who was not afraid to show Pre's face for all to see that he
was more ruggedly handsome than Jared Leto, the actor who portrays
him. Although the resemblance is uncanny, Leto's baby face is too
smooth to be messed up with a floppy mustache and mutton chops. But
he wears plastic-cloth '70s styles very well, and unlike most
actors who attempt sports, he can actually run and not look clumsy.
His stride is amazingly similar to Pre's, and Leto can turn a
quarter-mile in a minute flat.
<p>
   In ``Pre,'' the runner will be played by Billy Crudup, who is a
little slower than Leto but exactly Pre's height, at 5 foot 9.
Cruise considered taking the role himself, but he's shorter than
Crudup.
<p>
   The secondary role is Bill Bowerman, the salty Oregon and
Olympic track coach. Originally a consultant on ``Prefontaine,''
Bowerman switched to ``Pre,'' then threatened to sue Disney if it
featured him in its film. In ``Pre,'' he will be portrayed by
Donald Sutherland. In ``Prefontaine,'' he is R. Lee Ermey, who was
in ``Full Metal Jacket'' and ``Dead Man Walking.''
<p>
   A subplot is that Bowerman was always using his wife's waffle
iron to design a more durable shoe. Bowerman's invention turns out
to be a prototype Nike. One of Pre's many theatrical gestures is
his tearing off the gimmicky Nike swoosh before wearing the shoes.
<p>
   That was just like Pre. Even his fourth-place finish at the
Olympics was dramatic, when he sprinted for the glory and fell
short. Strategically, he could have positioned himself for a silver
or bronze. But Pre would never have stood on a lower step.
<p>
   He was golden all the way.

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian stocks fell because
of concern that state-controlled companies like Telecomunicacoes
Brasilieras SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA are more expensive than earnings prospects justify.
<p>
   ``I'm surprised the fall isn't harder,'' said Sergio Blatyta,
chief trader at Banco Votorantim SA. ``I wouldn't buy these stocks
at these prices.''
<p>
   The Bovespa index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange fell 874.06
points, or 1.1 percent, to 78,175.01, only the third decline so far
this year. In Rio de Janeiro, the IBV index fell 203 points, or 0.7
percent, to 29,546. Shares worth 490.8 million reais ($470.8
million) were traded in Sao Paulo.
<p>
   The government-controlled telephone company known as Telebras
and the federal utility called Eletrobras rose to all-time highs
yesterday. Petrobras hit an all-time high on Monday.
<p>
   The companies led a rally that pushed the Bovespa index 12.3
percent higher year-to-date before today's decline. The
state-controlled companies account for 69 percent of the weight
exchange officials assign to the index.
<p>
   Telebras, Petrobras and Eletrobras rose on government plans to
sell state assets this year and to open the oil and
telecommunications industries to private investment.
<p>
   Shares also rose on expectations President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso would gain the right to seek re-election next year and keep
his anti-inflation program on track. The government is trying to
amend the constitution so Cardoso can serve consecutive terms,
which is currently banned.
<p>
   Non-voting preferred shares in Telebras fell 1.1 reais to 89.6
reais, Petrobras preferred fell 5.5 reais to 188 and Eletrobras
preferred fell 1.01 reais to 435.99.
<p>
   Petrochemical company Copene Petroquimica do Nordeste SA was one
of the day's biggest decliners, falling 4.2 percent to 345 reais.
Copene posted a fourth-quarter loss of 6.4 million reais after
production costs cut gross margin to 13 percent from 17 percent in
the third quarter, Votorantim said in a report.
<p>
   Among other decliners, Banco Bradesco SA fell 3.4 percent to
8.45 reais, home appliance manufacturer Brasmotor SA fell 1.4
percent to 279.99 reais and Telecomunicacoes de Parana SA fell 1.4
percent to 690.
<p>
   Santander Investment Securities initiated coverage on Bradesco
with a ``market perform'' recommendation, saying the bank is fairly
valued. The stock should climb 19 percent to 9.74 reais in the next
12 months to 18 months if, as Santander expects, the Bovespa index
rises 22 percent over the same period, the bank said.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The computer industry is great
-- or is it?
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. shares climbed about 7 percent today.
International Business Machines Corp. stock dropped about 6
percent. Same industry. Same day.
<p>
   Both stocks moved in response to their fourth-quarter results,
good in each case. IBM's profit in the quarter rose 18 percent to
$2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share. But Compaq's earnings increased by
a much bigger amount, jumping 43 percent to $462 million, or $1.64
a share.
<p>
   You're beginning to see why the stocks moved as they did.
Investors also perceived that Compaq would continue to increase its
profits at a good clip while IBM might be slowing down.
<p>
   Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities,
said this about Compaq: ``They're gaining market share, profit
margins are increasing, cash is growing; what else to you want?''
<p>
   Of IBM, Larry Woods, an independent analyst, said: ``These are
not good numbers.''
<p>
   Whether all the figures justified the divergent moves in IBM and
Compaq shares was questionable, however.
<p>
   There's no reason for IBM and Compaq to move in lock-step, of
course. Same industry but different companies. Compaq's strong suit
is personal computers and it has moved into servers, which connect
networks of PCs.
<p>
   IBM has several businesses and remains a giant in all of them.
It competes with Compaq in PCs but it also makes mainframe
computers, workstations, semiconductors and software. IBM Chairman
Louis Gerstner has made a big push into the services business --
running and maintaining computer systems for other companies.
<p>
   Right now, Compaq's business is paying off. Sales of PCs to
companies, more profitable than sales to individuals, are strong.
In the fourth quarter, Houston-based Compaq got the most out of
those sales by cutting its costs. It slashed its inventories to
$1.15 billion from $2.16 billion a year earlier, for instance, and
collected its bills faster. Both moves freed up cash.
<p>
   With its spread of businesses, IBM reported both good and bad
for the final three months of 1996. Revenue from services jumped 22
percent to $5 billion and now account for 22 percent of IBM's total
sales.
<p>
   During 1996, according to a report by Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. today, IBM's services business signed $22.1 billion in new
contracts. That was more than the estimated $10.5 billion in
services contracts picked up by rival Computer Sciences Corp. and
the $7.5 billion in new contracts won by Electronic Data Systems
Corp.
<p>
   IBM's software sales were up too, by 4 percent. But total sales
of computers rose just 2 percent and falling prices of memory chips
caused a decline in semiconductor sales. Weak sales in Europe and a
strong dollar, which reduced the value of sales made abroad,
further muddied IBM's picture.
<p>
   There's a case for breaking up IBM into several companies that
might compete better on their own -- but Gerstner will have none of
that.
<p>
   One of these quarters, all of IBM's businesses may hit at once
and, for a day or so at least, leave more focused companies like
Compaq behind.
<p>
   Actually, for investors who hold their stocks for more than a
week, today's moves in Compaq and IBM were meaningless. In the past
three months, including today, IBM shares are up about 25 percent
while Compaq's rose about 20 percent.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Tightwads take note. Starting
next week, individual investors in the U.S. can buy stock in Merck
&AMP; Co., the nation's biggest drugmaker, directly from the company.
<p>
   Just send Merck an enrollment form and a check for at least
$350, plus a $10 enrollment fee. At Merck's current price of about
$88 a share, investors would receive approximately four shares.
<p>
   ``It's no muss, no fuss investing,'' said Charles Carlson, a
certified financial analyst and editor of the No-Load Stock Insider
newsletter. ``It doesn't get much easier.''
<p>
   Or cheaper. Merck is one of about 200 American corporations that
invite investors to buy their shares directly from the companies or
their bank representatives, by passing brokers and brokers'
commissions. Some companies charge between $10 and $15 to set up an
account, a dollar or two for each transaction, or a fee only when
an investor sells their stock. Other companies charge nothing at
all.
<p>
   In the end, it still represents a big savings from what brokers
charge. The brokerage fee for buying 100 shares or less of Merck
ranges from $29.95 to $55 at discount broker Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.,
depending on whether an investor uses a broker, the Internet or
other services. Full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
charge more.
<p>
   As with most plans, investors can buy more shares with all or
part of Merck's 40 cents-a-share quarterly dividend, make weekly
purchases of between $50 and $50,000, or can have monthly
investments of at least $50 wired out of their bank checking
accounts. If when these services come with fees attached they
remain much less costly than using a broker.
<p>
   Spurred by favorable Securities and Exchange Commission rulings
in late 1994, the number of companies that sell their shares
directly to investors has exploded. Each month a dozen or more
companies are starting direct-purchase programs. Carlson estimates
that within two years, between 500 and 1,000 companies will offer
the option.
<p>
   The list of companies already includes such blue chips as
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., McDonald's Corp., Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp., and Texaco Inc. -- all part of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, along with Merck.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. runs a program allowing individual investors
in the U.S. to buy American depository receipts of more than 40
foreign companies.
<p>
   A couple of years ago, there were only about 50 companies
offering direct stock sales, and the list was dominated by
slow-growing electric utilities.
<p>
   Now, the roster has grown more exciting. It includes First USA
Inc., the nation's third-largest credit-card issuer, which Banc One
Corp. of Columbus, Ohio offered to buy earlier this week for stock
valued at about $7 billion. First USA has made its stock available
to investors who call a toll-free number to request an application
and prospectus, and then mail back a check for purchases of as
little as $1,000.
<p>
   The lag between when an order is placed and when it is executed
draws attention to one of direct investing's drawbacks: speed. The
process generally two weeks or more. And the stock's price can
change significantly in either direction during the that period.
<p>
   There's only one fixed price for a stock on any given day using
direct investment, so there's no way of knowing what exact price
will be paid or received. On Jan. 2, for instance, First USA shares
on the New York Stock Exchange traded between $32.75 and $34.625
before ending at $33.
<p>
   If an investor plans on holding a stock for several years, minor
price changes will matter little, however. And many companies are
getting faster, executing trades daily, once a week or every two
weeks instead of once a month or, in some instances, every three
months. Others are offering shareholders an 800 number if they want
to sell. But most companies stick to the slow lane.
<p>
   ``The speed on the buy and sell side is improving,'' Carlson
said, and telephone services are superior to old rules that forced
investors to send written instructions of a sell order.
<p>
   Still, direct investing clearly isn't designed for active
traders.
<p>
   Indeed, one appeal of selling stock directly to investors is
that those investors are more likely to become loyal, long-term
shareholders who support management, says Robert O'Hara, marketing
director for the National Association of Investors Corp. The
non-profit NAIC runs a service that assists investors in buying
stock from about 150 companies for $7 plus the cost of one share.
The group says more than 400,000 investors have used the service in
the past 10 years.
<p>
   A spokesman for First USA said selling stock directly to
shareholders has helped the company broaden its shareholder base a
bit beyond institutional investors.
<p>
   Investors interested in direct purchases have a few options.
<p>
   One is to write or call the ``No-Load Stock Insider'' for a
sample of that newsletter free of charge, at 7412 Calumet Ave.,
Hammond, Indiana 46324; (219) 852-3230. A six-times-a-year
subscription is $33. The newsletter is published by NorthStar
Financial Inc.
<p>
   Investors can obtain an application and prospectus from any one
of about 100 companies that have direct-purchase plans by calling
the Direct Stock Purchase Plan Clearinghouse -- a joint venture
between NorthStar Financial and New York-based Shareholder
Communications Corp. -- at (800) 744-4117. (Companies pay to have
their stocks listed.)

to remain a member after the investment plan has been used.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- An eclectic coalition led by
U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich of Ohio plans to
release a list next week of government spending programs for
corporations that it wants eliminated or reduced to save
Kvs~~goysUtaxpayers more than $2 billion a year.
<p>
   The list, which is still being finalized, calls for elimination
of the Agriculture Department's Market Access Program, which helps
U.S. food exporters market overseas; closing the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., which provides insurance to companies investing
overseas; elimination of the Rural Utility Service, which provides
subsidized electricity for rural areas; and a reduction in U.S.
dues paid to the International Monetary Fund.
<p>
   The manifesto will come from an unusual policy coalition that
includes Ralph Nader and Friends of the Earth on the left and the
Cato and Heritage institutes on the right. It targets about a dozen
so-called ``corporate welfare'' provisions they say R[RB/+V ki 9A!
``!eXP ggx`9W( nci s ``Thisut direction,'' said Gnt oTax Reform,
which n twith the focus on bais ibe doable.''
<p>
   Still, all of the programs on the list have strong backers in
Congress and many have survived repeated attacks in years past.
``These are easier said than done,'' Norquist said.
<p>
   Nothing was included unless all of the coalition members agreed
-- and that kept some often-criticized projects off the list.
<p>
   Among the escapees is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
peanut and sugar subsidies, which together cost taxpayers more than
$1.5 billion in higher food costs, according to General Accounting
Office estimates.
<p>
   The U.S. sets a minimum price for U.S. sugar and limits the
import of cheaper foreign sugar. It also limits permits for peanut
growers, and then sets minimum prices for the peanuts they grow,
raising the costs for processors.
<p>
   ``We tried, but we couldn't get enough support to include these
on the list,'' said Stephen Moore, a fiscal policy analyst at the
Cato Institute. Participants said some environmental and public
interest groups opposed removing the limits because of the impact
on family farmers.
<p>
   The coalition also decided to leave tax breaks off the list,
allowing the tax subsidy for corn-based ethanol fuel to escape the
group's targeting. That tax break, which was worth about $3.6
billion during the last five years, benefits a handful of
corporations, led by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., which accounts for
almost 40 percent of the ethanol produced, and High Plains Corp.,
whose sole business is ethanol production.
<p>
   Lawmakers have repeatedly attempted to kill the program, only to
see it survive. ADM remains committed to the program, and still
wields enormous power in Washington. The company, its chairman,
Dwayne Andreas, and executives, gave $495,000 to candidates and
lawmakers in the last election cycle, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics.
<p>
   Still, Kasich's group is taking on a host of popular programs,
including the Rural Utility Service, formerly known as the Rural
Electrification Administration. Started in 1936, it had the noble
goal of providing electricity to rural America.
<p>
   That subsidy, now $89 million a year, benefits government-owned
municipal utilities and the holders of their tax-free bonds at the
expense of the more than 200 investor-owned utilities, according to
the Edison Electric Institute.
<p>
   Killing the program won't be an easy task. ``Rural utility
services have a pretty large constituency,'' Cato's Moore said.
``That will be tough work for western and rural senators and
congressmen.''
<p>
   Kasich will also take another swing at OPIC, which provides
insurance for U.S. companies operating outside the U.S. Efforts to
kill the program last year were unsuccessful. Its' opponents argue
that providing corporate insurance is a job for business, even
though the program is profitable. It returned $209 million last
year. ``That's all the more reason it should be privatized,''
Norquist said.
<p>
   The USDA's Market Access Program, among the most often-cited
example of unneeded government largesse, also made Kasich's list
this year, Moore and other participants said.
<p>
   Formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, it provides $70
million a year for companies to advertise overseas. Firms from
Grand Metropolitan Plc's Pillsbury Co. to McDonald's Corp. have
received funds, although lawmakers have limited access to the funds
in recent years.
<p>
   ``It ended up subsidizing advertising and marketing for large
agribusiness efforts,'' said Friends of the Earth's Gawain Kripke.
``It doesn't in any way help American agriculture.''
<p>
   The group also wants the U.S. to reduce its agreement to provide
funds in the Treasury to be used by the IMF to bail out emerging
economies if they were on the verge of loan defaults.
<p>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin argues, however, that by
contributing to the fund, the U.S. insures that it won't have to
unilaterally bail out a failing economy's such as we did with
Mexico in 1995.

   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. said it
plans to sell Brittania Sportswear Ltd., which makes discount
clothing, to focus on its premium brands of Levi jeans, Dockers
slacks and Slates dress pants.
<p>
   Brittania's casual wear is largely sold through discount chains,
such as Kmart Corp. and Dayton-Hudson Corp.'s Target stores.
<p>
   The Brittania brand, while popular in the 1970s and 1980s, has
performed poorly in recent years, analysts said. Levi hasn't
supported the line with advertising and many stores are developing
their own brand names, said Alan Millstein, publisher of the
Fashion Network Report, an apparel industry newsletter.
<p>
   ``Why fool around with a business that's under $50 million?'' in
annual sales, Millstein said. Levi's had total sales of about $6.7
billion in 1995.
<p>
   Renton, Washington-based Brittania employs about 120 people to
make jeans, leather goods and underwear. Levi bought the company
from Asian Pacific Industries in 1987.
<p>
   About 71 percent of Brittania's 1995 revenue was generated by
its two biggest customers, Levi's has said.
<p>
   ``Our core competency is premium apparel brands distributed
through premium channels. It's what we do best,'' said company
spokesman Brad Williams.
<p>
   He declined to give a value for the unit.
<p>
   Potential buyers may include retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. or Kmart that would make it an exclusive house brand, backed
by substantial advertising, Millstein said.
<p>
   Closely held Levi Strauss is the world's largest maker of
brand-name clothing and the second-biggest maker of jeans in the
U.S. The company employs about 37,500 people.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy continues to
grow with low unemployment nudging labor costs higher, the Federal
Reserve said today.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for
higher wages in its latest regional economic survey, the central
bank still found no evidence of accelerating consumer prices
outside of energy in December or early January.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published
eight times each year. Their report will help form the basis for
discussion at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, where analysts expect Fed policymakers to leave the
overnight borrowing rate for banks unchanged at 5.25 percent. The
federal funds rate target has held at that level since Jan. 31,
1996.
<p>
   ``Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in
most parts of the country,'' the Fed said in its report. ``Holiday
sales were in line with retailers' expectations of moderate growth.
Manufacturing activity continued to grow, with significant strength
coming from capital equipment and materials manufacturers.''
<p>
   The report is likely to be ``comforting'' for investors, said
James Padinha, an economist at MMS International in San Francisco,
because it doesn't point to wage pressures or other worrisome signs
of inflation.
<p>
   In financial markets, though, the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond fell after the government's auction of about $17 billion in
two-year notes. The bond fell 1/2, pushing up the yield more than 4
basis points to 6.82 percent, as dealers tried to sell their
holdings of the new government securities.
<p>
   The latest Fed regional survey, compiled by the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, is in line with comments yesterday by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the U.S. economy remains strong
with few signs of immediate inflationary pressures even as an era
of low wage gains may be ending.
<p>
   In the Fed's New York district, for example, the economy had a
``slightly firmer tone than in the last report, while price
pressures remain subdued,'' the Fed said.
<p>
   In the country's mid-section, the Kansas City Fed said rising
job creation is beginning to put upward pressure on wages,
something Fed officials have been warning about as a risk to the
nation's inflation outlook.
<p>
   Along the Pacific coast, the San Francisco Fed reported
retailers enjoyed a ``good'' holiday selling season, though adverse
weather in late December and early January ``held down
post-Christmas retail activity.''
<p>
   Release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Washington time,
however it was inadvertently released at 12:10 p.m. on the Internet
by the Fed. ``Everybody has broken an embargo, including me,''
joked the Fed's chief spokesman, Joseph Coyne. News agencies
occasionally release stories about government reports before their
scheduled release times because of unintentional computer glitches.
<p>
   In his testimony yesterday, Greenspan said, ``the economy has
retained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and
inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions.'' He
added: ``By some important measures of price trends, inflation
actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   Economists interpreted Greenspan's comments as suggesting the
FOMC won't raise interest rates next month. Still, Greenspan left
the door ajar for action later if inflation accelerates because of
rising wage levels.
<p>
   The overall consumer price index rose 3.3 percent last year, the
largest increase since 1990. However, much of that came from an 8.6
percent rise in energy prices. Not counting food and energy, prices
rose only 2.6 percent, tying the 1994 rate for the lowest core
inflation rate in 30 years.
<p>
   In its last regional outlook Dec. 4, the Fed said the economy
growing at a subdued pace with no sign of rising consumer prices.
That lack of an inflation threat allowed the central bank to
refrain from increasing interest rates at their last policy meeting
Dec. 17.
<p>
   Central bankers last cut the federal funds rate by a quarter
point at the Jan. 31, 1996, FOMC meeting, when many analysts were
predicting the U.S. economy was heading into a recession. That
followed identical quarter-point reductions in July and December
1995.
<p>
   Following are summaries of regional economic activity as
reported by the Fed's district banks:
<p>
   Boston: Economy continues to expand at moderate pace. Holiday
sales higher at retailers.
<p>
   New York: Slightly firmer tone to regional economy. Price
pressures subdued.
<p>
   Philadelphia: Economic activity moving up slowly. No signs of
acceleration in the rate of general wage increases.
<p>
   Cleveland: Regional economy held steady at a good level.
Unemployment near or below national average.
<p>
   Richmond: Economic activity at high levels. Retail sales up
sharply. Commercial real estate strong.
<p>
   Atlanta: Retail sales mixed. Wages ``generally appear to be
holding steady.''
<p>
   Chicago: Signs of increasing wage pressures. Holiday sales fell
short of expectations.
<p>
   St. Louis: Economy picked up since last report. Retail sales met
expectations. Tight labor markets prevail.
<p>
   Minneapolis: Even in bitter winter, regional economy continue to
grow. Oil development is ``pumping cash.''
<p>
   Kansas City: Economy shows few signs of slowing. Consumer and
producer prices both stable.
<p>
   Dallas: Growth ``slightly stronger'' than in October and
November. Oil drilling on the rise.
<p>
   San Francisco: Strong expansion reported. Storm repair helping
construction spending.

   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Argentina sold 100,000
metric tons of the current corn crop to Korea for shipment in June
and July for about $106 a ton, traders said.
<p>
   The exact price wasn't available from traders. The price doesn't
include shipping costs.
<p>
   Korea also bought another 50,000 tons of corn that will most
likely come from Argentina, traders said. The purchase was made
through exporters on an optional origin basis, meaning the
exporters can choose the country of origin.
<p>
   The Agriculture Secretariat estimated Argentina will produce a
record 14.6 million tons of corn in the current 1996-97 crop year,
up from 10.5 million in 1995-96. After local demand, estimated at 4
million to 4.5 million tons, is met, about 10 million tons would be
left for export.
<p>
   Traders said Argentina has already sold about 2.5 million tons
of corn for export from the 1996-97 crop.

   Brasilia, Brazil, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso will travel to the United Kingdom and
Italy in February, instead of taking part in his country's Carnival
celebrations.
<p>
   Cardoso will visit the U.K. on Feb. 10, and be received by Prime

Cardoso, a sociologist, will take part in a conference on Latin
America, Brazil's Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
<p>
   On Feb. 11, Cardoso is scheduled to go to Italy, where he will
meet with lawmakers from the Italian lower house and senate, as
well as government leaders. Both Feb. 10 and 11 are national
holidays in Brazil. February 11, known in other countries as Mardi
Gras or Shrove Tuesday, is the day before Ash Wednesday.
<p>
   During his scheduled four-day stay in Italy, Cardoso is slated
to meet with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. In addition, Cardoso
plans to speak at a U.N. conference on agriculture and will visit
the University of Bologna, the ministry said in a statement.

<p>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev.  &MD;  For years now, electronics manufacturers have
promised that homes would soon be cocoons outfitted with every type
of entertainment and information component. No longer far-off
fantasies, such devices were on display at the Consumer Electronics
Show here earlier this month. What's more, many will be on the
market in a few months.
<p>
   Finally, key pieces of the home electronics future have some due
dates and price tags. Here is an update.
<p>
   Digital Video Disks
<p>
   Ear-splitting demonstrations of the digital video disk
reverberated throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center. The
five-inch disk, or DVD, has been called the closest thing to
movie-theater quality for the television, with images almost twice
as good as those on videotape and the same Dolby digital sound that
blares forth in cineplexes.
<p>
   Warner Home Video, MGM Home Entertainment, Polygram and New Line
announced that they would start releasing DVD movies in March.
Prices will be comparable to those for videotapes, at $19 to $29,
and the first releases will include special-effect extravaganzas
like ``Twister'' and ``Space Jam.''
<p>
   Toshiba said it would release its DVD movie player in February,
Panasonic will follow in March and Sony in April. Prices will start
at $599.
<p>
   And Blockbuster Entertainment announced that it would begin
demonstrating the Sony DVD movie player at selected stores in
April.
<p>
   The disks, which look like compact disks, deliver their promised
depth and richness, and it can be startling: even individual
strands of hair are visible.
<p>
   The sound  &MD;  providing you have a good surround-sound system
consisting of a receiver and five speakers  &MD;  really can compete
with a movie theater's. Over all, the disks do not have the quality
of film, but it is close and certainly better than that of laser
disks, which are larger.
<p>
   Should you run out and buy a DVD player and send your VCR to the
Smithsonian? Hardly. Only 50 movies will be out on the DVD format
by spring. And DVD players with recording capability are still
three years away.
<p>
   Before DVD movie players become a living-room fixture, the
selection of films needs to be wider and the prices for the players
lower. But the DVD experience is worth going to an electronics
store for a demonstration.
<p>
   Better Video Quality for PCs
<p>
   It may be harder to wait for DVD for the home computer: digital
video disks improve computer video quality from something that
resembles a jerky silent movie to the quality of television.
<p>
   Toshiba was the first to announce that its personal computers
with built-in DVD drives will be in stores by April; the technology
will add about $700 to the price of a computer. Buying a separate
drive for an existing computer will cost about the same.
<p>
   The increased storage capacity of the drives is a big selling
point. For example, Phonedisc, a list of 115 million phone numbers
nationwide, will be available on one disk, rather than on five
CD-ROMS.
<p>
   Like DVD movie players, DVD computer drives will probably be a
better investment in a year or two. The price of drives and disks,
now $50 to $199, should drop significantly and more software will
be available. 
<p>
   Slim Televisions
<p>
   The television suitable for hanging on the wall has arrived.
Philips Electronics, Panasonic and Sony demonstrated 40- to 42-inch
televisions just four inches thick.
<p>
   Philips expects to have them available this summer for ``over
$10,000,'' according to the company. Other makers will not
speculate about a release date or price, but most likely, more flat
televisions will hit stores late next year when digital
broadcasting begins. It will probably take a few years before they
are more affordable.
<p>
   The new flat televisions use gas plasma technology instead of
the 50-year-old cathode ray tube technology. The picture on the
Philips model looked the best  &MD;  it was about the same as a
high-quality standard television. The other flat televisions, all
prototypes, had bugs to be worked out: all were plagued with blurry
patches called digital artifacts that floated across the screen.

   Internet in a Dish
<p>
   A big complaint about the Internet is that it takes too long to
download anything that is fun. Hughes Network Systems demonstrated
a 36-inch satellite dish called the Convergence Antenna that makes
the process 15 times faster than with a standard modem.
<p>
   Instead of getting the Internet through telephone lines, users
subscribe to Hughes's satellite Internet service, called Direc PC.
In a demonstration, a 90-second animation clip that normally takes
an hour to download arrived in less than two minutes.
<p>
   But speed costs: Direc PC costs about $150 a month for unlimited
access; the Convergence Antenna is about $650. The dish also picks
up 175 channels on television.
<p>
   Souped-Up Telephones
<p>
   The Cidco iPhone display at the show was mobbed by
conventioneers watching demonstrations of a phone with a
4-by-7-inch touch screen that allows users to surf the Internet.
Like other telephones that can connect to the Internet, the iPhone
has a small pull-out keyboard that also lets the user tap out
e-mail messages. But its liquid-crystal display screen is double
the size of that on other Internet telephones and allows you to see
graphics as well as text. It's due in stores by fall, at $500 or
so.
<p>
   The Philips P200 also attracted plenty of attention, but mostly
for its looks. It is a standard screen phone that can send and
receive e-mail and do banking on line. But it is more sculptured
than the usual screen phones, with a fluid design. It will be
released in May, with a list price of $499. 
<p>
   Movies to Come and Go
<p>
   Want to rent a video but are too wedded to the sofa to stir
outside? Soon, one company promises, you will be able to call up
your cable company, order a movie from a catalogue of thousands and
have it beamed in to your VCR. After two plays, the movie
disappears. That's the concept behind Emc3, an Amsterdam company
that aims to revolutionize video rentals.
<p>
   Two things have to happen before movies can be delivered this
way: you will have to buy a D-VHS VCR, due in stores later this
year from several companies for around $750. These VCR's can record
digital information delivered by satellite or cable. And Emc3 has
to sell its technology to cable companies and satellite television
providers.
<p>
   The company says it can provide music and computer software the
same way. As soon as somebody signs a deal.

   Following is some cola lore. 
<p>
   CURES THAT REFRESH
<p>
    &MD;  The original soft drink entrepreneurs were looking for cures,
not the pause that refreshes. Coca-Cola came about in 1886 when an
Atlanta pharmacist mixed up a cola syrup and promoted it as a cure
for hangovers and headaches. The syrup got mixed with carbonated
water at Jacob's Pharmacy to become a cola drink.
<p>
    &MD;  ``Brad's drink'' came along in the same year when North
Carolina pharmacist Caleb Bradham whipped up a similar concoction.
The drink's name changed to Pepsi-Cola in 1903.
<p>
    &MD;  Waco pharmacist Charles C. Alderton came up with Dr Pepper at
the Old Corner Drugstore in 1885, and, as the story goes, named it
for yet another pharmacist, Dr. Charles K. Pepper. 
<p>
   LIKE, IT'S BETTER THAN POT, MAN
<p>
   Because of its original formula of cocaine and caffeine, many
old-time Southerners called Cokes ``dopes.'' 
<p>
   GOES GREAT WITH BURGERS
<p>
   According to Elisabeth Rozin, author of ``The Primal
Cheeseburger,'' colas are the drink of choice with a cheeseburger
platter because the spicy medicinal flavor and heavy carbonation
cleanse and refresh the palate after the load of fat delivered by
the burger and fries. 
<p>
   THE VAMPIRIC CHOICE
<p>
   Gothic author Anne Rice, signing books recently in Lewisville,
Texas, toted along a cooler packed with a six-pack of her favorite
beverage. No, it wasn't blood; it was Tab. 
<p>
   WHY ISN'T IS MOM?
<p>
   ``Pop'' entered the vocabulary in the early 1800s; the term came
from the sound made when the corks were pulled from the bottles of
then-natural soda waters. 
<p>
   DR PEPPER
<p>
   Corporate Dr Pepper left its Waco, Texas, birthplace in 1922 to
move to Dallas. The defection made little difference to the
residents of Jerusalem on the Brazos; Waco is still the No. 1
market for the drink.
<p>
   Dr Pepper lost its period in the 1950s, when the script type of
the logo was changed to a more ``modern'' bold italic type.
<p>
   The Dr Pepper bottling plant in Dublin, Texas, is the only one
that still uses pure cane sugar as its sweetener. The plant
distributes its product in a 40-mile radius of Dublin but will (and
does) ship the product around the country to consumers. To order,
phone (817) 445-3466. 
<p>
   7UP
<p>
   7UP got its name from the marketer's fascination with cattle
brands, according to ``I'm a Spam Fan: The Stories Behind America's
Favorite Foods.'' It certainly beats the original name for the
soda: Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda. 
<p>
   PASSOVER COKE
<p>
   Around the Jewish observance of Passover, some bottlers in the
United States occasionally put out ``Passover'' Coke. Because some
Jews aren't allowed to consume corn products at this time, Coke
uses sucrose as its sweetener in specially marked bottles of Coke.
Look for the Coke in delis and the supermarkets. Coke, by the way,
is always kosher. 
<p>
   INDUSTRY SHARE
<p>
   The top 10 soft drink brands' industry share for 1995 are:
Coca-Cola Classic, 20 percent; Pepsi, 15.4 percent; Diet Coke, 9.5
percent; Dr Pepper, 6 percent; Mountain Dew, 5.6 percent; Diet
Pepsi, 5.4 percent; Sprite, 4.9 percent; Seven-Up, 2.7 percent;
Caffeine Free Diet Coke, 1.9 percent; Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi, 1.1
percent; others, 27.4 percent. Source: Beverage Marketing

 &UR; FED'S PARRY SAYS INFLATION MAY RISE AS ECONOMY STRENGTHENS &LR;  &QL;

   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation may rise in
1997 because employment is high and the economy is showing new
signs of strength, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President
Robert Parry said today.
<p>
   ``Inflation could be set to rise in the future,'' Parry said in
the text of a speech to the National Association of Business
Economists in San Francisco. ``Available data on the fourth quarter
have shown considerable strength,'' he said.
<p>
   Yesterday Parry told reporters he expects the 1997 core rate of
inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, to rise
``a couple of tenths'' to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent in 1996.
<p>
   Parry's comments today came as newly released figures showed
U.S. housing starts last year rose 8.8 percent to 1.474 million,
the highest level since 1988.
<p>
   The Fed's `beige book'' survey of regional economic data
released today also found ``scattered evidence'' of pressure for
higher wages.
<p>
   U.S. bonds were lower after the U.S. Treasury sold $17.5 billion
of two-year notes today. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell
1/2, pushing its yield up more than 4 basis points to 6.82 percent.
<p>
   Traders said comments late yesterday from Federal Reserve
Governor Susan Phillips revived concern the Fed may raise interest
rates soon.
<p>
   Phillips suggested in a Market News interview that the Fed might
not wait for a rise in the core consumer price index before
boosting rates.
<p>
   The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the interest
rate-setting body of the central bank, is next scheduled to meet
Feb. 4-5. Parry, who is widely viewed as an inflation hawk, is a
voting member of the FOMC.
<p>
   Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate
hearing that there are few signs of inflation in the economy.
<p>
   ``The economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of
the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past
expansions,'' Greenspan said. ``By some important measures of price
trends, inflation actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   His remarks yesterday helped boost the Dow Jones Industrial
average to a record close of 6877.35. Today, the Dow closed down
33.9 points at 6850. Broader market indices were higher.
<p>
   Fed officials have said tightening job markets are the most
likely threat to price stability in 1997. That's partly because
average hourly earnings rose 6 cents last month, or 0.5 percent,
according to the Labor Department. For all of last year, hourly
earnings climbed 3.8 percent, the biggest gain since a similar 3.8
percent increase in 1990.
<p>
   Last Thursday, Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer, widely
viewed as an inflation dove, warned the Fed would have to raise
interest rates if unemployment falls much below the current 5.3
percent rate.
<p>
   Greenspan also left open the possibility of an interest rate
increase if the economy grows faster than the 3.0 percent rate he
forecast for 1996. ``Indeed, the recent pickup in some measures of
wages suggests that the transition may already be running its
course,'' the Fed chairman said.
<p>
   Parry reiterated comments he made in a speech yesterday to the
Financial Women's Association that workers who have been more
concerned with keeping their jobs than getting pay raises will
likely begin seeking wage increases this year.
<p>
   ``Even if some workers continue to feel insecure, they still
won't be willing to pass up wage increases forever,'' Parry said
yesterday.
<p>
   He also said a stronger dollar, which makes foreign goods
cheaper by comparison with American products, is unlikely to help
keep inflation down. ``Our inflation rate ultimately depends on our
monetary policy, and not on the existence of foreign competitors,''
Parry said in the text of his speech to the business economists.

<TEXT>
<p>
   At a time when so many composers have given up on radical
innovation, the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, who turns 75 this
year, has become a heartening figure. His music, as represented in
new recordings, is hardly less uncompromising than it was in the
1950s, though it is certainly richer and more adept, probably
because he has been able to build on his successes while retaining
an extraordinary imperviousness to his mistakes.
<p>
   In more than four decades of working with orchestras he has
developed a keen imagination for sound, generated by new playing
techniques or, more usually these days, by assembling chords that
work as single colors.
<p>
   But harmony and voice-leading still mean very little to him,
insistent pulsation and scatter shots remain his most
characteristic kinds of rhythm, and his musical forms are chains of
events: chains sustained by the excitement of each moment and the
timing of each jump.
<p>
   The expressive result is aggressive, or not so much aggressive
as defiant. Xenakis's music is not trying to hurt but rather to
protect itself: to stake out its territory and fence off any
possibility that it might be heard in traditional ways. Only by
being emphatically different, according to Xenakis, can his music
answer the call he makes on it, which is to demonstrate that he
exists.
<p>
   ``Composition, action are nothing but a struggle for
existence,'' he tells Balint Andras Varga in Varga's recently
published ``Conversations With Iannis Xenakis.'' ``If I imitate the
past, I do nothing, and consequently I am not. I am sure that I
exist only if I do something different.''
<p>
   By no means is this just some sort of exhibitionism.
Exhibitionists need an audience; Xenakis, one senses from this
book, is alone with himself, and his triumphs, in terms of public
acclaim and colleagues' imitation, are an embarrassment. For to
achieve complete victory in his ``struggle for existence'' he would
have to create something so different that to anybody else it would
be totally meaningless.
<p>
   Even he has not gone that far, though he has regularly traveled
a long way into the desert of incoherence, often by calculating his
music so as to maximize disorder. This is the main thrust of his
mathematical techniques: his spinning numbers, like John Cage's
coin tossings, insure that notes are chosen and ordered by blind
chance, or according to processes of change that have little to do
with conventional musical perception.
<p>
   What meaning remains will usually be crude, and it is striking
that in his conversations with Varga, Xenakis so often equates
beauty with savagery: in his fascination with weapons and armor,
for instance, with the sea or with the bulls of the Camargue.
<p>
   In his music virtually the whole elaborate machinery of Western
composition is set aside, and we are left with a brute vocabulary
of signals. As sometimes in the work of other modernists  &MD; 
Stravinsky, Varese, Harrison Birtwistle  &MD;  avoidance of the
immediate past leads to imagined contact with the archaic.
<p>
   In the conversation book Xenakis recalls how, as a boy in
Greece, he ``went to the museum and tried to imagine how the
statues would move if they suddenly came to life.''
<p>
   ``With what gestures?'' he wondered. ``How would they speak?
What would the music of their language be like?'' These are the
questions his compositions have been answering.
<p>
   Their answers, being removed from ordinary ways of doing things
musically, require particular efforts of virtuosity and imagination
from performers if the music's strength  &MD;  its intense particularity
 &MD;  is not to seem mere incapacity.
<p>
   Happily there are musicians up to this challenge, and none more
so than Charles Zachary Bornstein and his ST-X Ensemble, who gave
us ``Kraanerg'' at Cooper Union in New York City in the fall and
have now released two selections of smaller pieces on Mode CDs.
Each includes a 60's classic  &MD;  ``Eonta'' for piano and brass in one
case, ``Akrata'' for symphonic winds in the other  &MD;  along with more
recent works.
<p>
   Both recordings convince by their own conviction; all the
performances are hot. But the disk including ``Eonta'' (Mode 53) is
a clear front-runner.
<p>
   It offers the stark, urgent ritual ``N'shima,'' for two
amplified ``peasant voices'' with trombones, horns and cello; the
percussion solo ``Rebonds,'' brilliantly played by Robert McEwan,
and best of all, ``Akanthos,'' a 10-minute drama of sibylline
utterance in a context of clouds, brayings and scrubbings of sound,
all contrived, astonishingly, by an ensemble close to that of
Ravel's supersophisticated Mallarme settings.
<p>
   The soprano Susan May is superb in producing the imprecations,
formalized laughter, stunning octave leaps and final scanning of
the horizon before wild yelps.
<p>
   The other record (Mode 56), though, has the immense and strange
attractions of ``Echange,'' a concerto for bass clarinet and
ensemble, whose behemothian sounds glisten with harmonics.
<p>
   It is remarkable how, in discussing some of these and other
violently poetic works with Varga, Xenakis is unwilling to describe
them as anything more than interesting sequences of interesting
sounds. If the music is to assert his existence, perhaps it can do
so only by being itself, and not by being about its composer, who
must stand aside and let it happen.
<p>
   ``Eonta,'' he recalls, came into his mind while he was at
Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., sitting in a boat with a pretty young
woman. ``We were surrounded by a forest, and I stroked the water
with my hand,'' he says. In the eventual eruptive work, though,
listeners are left, as Bornstein's note puts it, with ``radiated
light and cascading water'': a bucolic interlude has become fierce
physics.

   Shine PG-13
<p>
   Shines. This tender, comic and uplifting Australian movie is
based on the true story of musical prodigy David Helfgott, who
recovered from a nervous breakdown to become a world-renowned
concert pianist. Geoffrey Rush is marvelous as the adult Helfgott,
as is Armin Mueller-Stahl as his domineering dad. An offbeat,
upbeat film about someone who finally finds his light at the end of
a very long tunnel. Rated PG-13 for adult themes. 1 hour, 47
minutes.
<p>
   Sleepers R
<p>
   ``Mean Streets'' meets ``The Sting'' in this Big Credentials
movie that offers an Oscar-winning director (Barry Levinson); a
star-studded cast; and a hefty, serious-movie running time of
almost 2 hours. The first half is about four kids from Hell's
Kitchen who're sent to reform school. In the second half, the four,
now grown up, finally take revenge on the guard (Kevin Bacon) who
tortured and sexually abused them. Brad Pitt and Jason Patric are
the leaders of the pack (one a lawyer, the other a reporter).
Robert De Niro is a kindly priest, and Dustin Hoffman steals scenes
as a washed-up lawyer. The movie never tears you up the way it
intends. Rather, it's a done- deal kind of film; you don't worry
about what happens as much as you enjoy a bunch of Hollywood pros
happening on screen.
<p>
   Space Jam PG
<p>
   This semi-animated extravaganza starring basketball great
Michael Jordan and a plethora of Looney Tunes characters isn't so
much a movie as it is an 87-minute commercial  &MD;  for Warner Bros.
(which owns the 'toons), for McDonald's (which is peddling the
tie-in toys), but most of all for Jordan himself. The negligible
plot goes like this: Aliens kidnap Bugs Bunny and the gang to serve
as attractions in an interstellar amusement park. To win their
freedom, the 'toons challenge their space captors to a basketball
game, enlisting the services of Jordan to ensure a victory. Between
the blatant product placements and the loving, slow-motion shots of
Jordan sailing into a layup, the Looney Tunes characters work their
classic magic. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hours, 27 minutes.
<p>
   Star Trek: First Contact PG
<p>
   Keeps on Trekkin'. This eighth big-screen installment of the
unstoppable TV series boldy goes where no ``Star Trek'' movie has
gone before. Namely it enters theaters without a single member of
the original crew on board. In their stead is the confident cast of
``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Their mission: to stop some
cyber-zombies known as the Borg from taking over the universe,
which mostly means following the Borg back to 21st-century Earth,
so they can't alter history. The good news is, the new cast has
much the same verve and chemistry as their predecessors. The bad
news is, if your knowledge of the new group doesn't go much further
than Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard and Brent Spiner as the
android, Data, you may find yourself a bit lost in space. But as
the Borg say, ``Resistance Is Futile.'' Enjoy the show and pass the
jujubes. Rated PG-13 for violence. 1 hour, 50 minutes.
<p>
   Trainspotting R
<p>
   If things like flying feces, dead infants and opium
suppositories aren't your style, then it's possible this rude, bold
and bleakly funny film isn't for you. Danny Boyle's Cannes
sensation about a young Scottish heroin addict named Renton (Ewan
McGregor) and his wasted mates is a searingly black comic look at
the lower depths, Edinburgh style. It's amazing how full an empty
life can be; as Renton says, ``a true and sincere junk habit'' can
be time-consuming. The film's twisted post-Thatcher nihil ism and
inventive visuals suggests a new dramatic form: kitchen-sink
surrealism (think John Osborne meets Gus Van Sant). Yet we actually
come to care for lively, self-deluded Renton  &MD;  so very bright and
so very trapped. Rated R for sex, language, drugs, nudity and
violence.
<p>
   Turbulence R
<p>
   This hybrid of ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Speed'' and ``Airport'' crash
lands before it even takes off. Ray Liotta plays a serial killer
who takes over the plane transporting him to prison, while menacing
flight attendant Lauren Holly. There's a lot of running up and down
the aisles, and brutality. Liotta cackles maniacally, Holly sits in
the unmanned cockpit and chews her lip in fear. (Oh, forgot to
mention  &MD;  the pilot and co-pilot get themselves killed almost as
quickly as those silly cops.) In its accidental foolishness,
``Turbulence'' starts to resemble the ``Airplane'' movies. You
start hoping that inflatable co- pilot will puff up in the
captain's seat. 1 hour, 43 minutes.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A federal
jury told Walt Disney Co.'s ABC television network to pay Food Lion
Inc. $5.5 million in punitive damages for having two news producers
lie to get jobs at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   The verdict stunned media lawyers, since Food Lion never
challenged the truth of the resulting 1992 ``PrimeTime Live''
expose, which showed workers disguising and selling out-of-date
meat.
<p>
   Lawyers said the verdict, if it holds up on appeal, will spur
similar suits and reduce the number of investigations that use
hidden cameras. The award comes after several lesser-known rulings
aimed at how the media gathers news.
<p>
   ``People are going to think three or four times before they do
something like this,'' said Robert Sack, a libel defense lawyer for
Time Inc., the Wall Street Journal and Newsday. ``There are going
to be stories about health, safety and other possible misdeeds that
will never get out.''
<p>
   Food Lion's Class A shares rose 1/8 to 9 1/8 in late trading of
591 300, more than its three-month daily average of 479,000.
Disney's stock rose 3/8 to 70 1/8.
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and PrimeTime executives
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage.
<p>
   Two lower-level producers faked resumes to get Food Lion jobs
where they could report on and film the company's practices through
small cameras hidden in wigs and clothing.
<p>
   Salisbury, North Carolina-based Food Lion claimed the report
cost it more than $2 billion in lost profit and stock value. U.S.
District Judge Carlton Tilley barred Food Lion from using the
content of the broadcast as evidence.
<p>
   The jury, which last week said it was deadlocked 11-1, spared
the two producers, directing two higher-ranking ABC executives to
pay a combined $45,750. Former ``PrimeTime'' executive producer
Richard Kaplan, now elsewhere at ABC, was told to pay $35,000 and
Senior Producer Ira Rosen was ordered to pay $10,750.
<p>
   ``We're very satisfied with the verdict,'' said Food Lion
attorney Richard Wyatt.
<p>
   ABC said it would appeal ``through all available channels'' if
Tilley doesn't set the verdict aside. It also said it would pay as
much as legally possible of the individual awards.
<p>
   The judgment ``should trouble every American,'' the network said
in a statement. ``Food Lion has succeeded in convincing a jury to
punish ABC for using undercover investigating techniques that
exposed its unsanitary practices.''
<p>
   Jurors said the verdict was intended only to warn the media that
they have to obey the law and not make false statements.
<p>
   ``No one wants to handcuff the media,'' said jury foreman Greg
Mack. ``The real problem came (because) ABC had no guidelines.''
<p>
   Tony Kinton, a brewery worker in Reidsville, North Carolina,
said he was the lone juror that hadn't wanted to award punitive
damages. Others wanted to award billions of dollars and some
expressed their opinions before hearing any evidence, he said.
<p>
   ``We had no choice,'' Kinton said. ``We were going to send a
message to the press that there are limitations.''
<p>
   The media got the message loud and clear.
<p>
   ``The real loser is the public,'' said Bruce Sanford, a libel
attorney in Washington, D.C.. ``All we will get are more stories on
Dennis Rodman.''
<p>
   The verdict is the latest in a series of court decisions aimed
not at the content of news reports but at newsgathering techniques.
<p>
   Rulings in the past year have allowed juries to consider whether
reporters invaded the privacy of accident victims and barred a
camera crew from following the son of an executive at U.S.
Healthcare Inc.
<p>
   ``People are angry at people who gather the news and the way
they gather the news, even when it is in the public interest,''
said libel lawyer Sack, of the New York firm Gibson, Dunn &AMP;
Crutcher.
<p>
   In the Food Lion case, the Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last
month awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the
salaries earned by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Sack and other legal experts predicted that the gap between the
small compensatory damages and the multimillion-dollar punitive
award would prompt the judge or the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to reduce the amount of punitive damages.
<p>
   The slight rise in Food Lion's shares indicates that investors
realize that the chain must do more to win back customers, analysts
said. Food Lion has revamped its stores and preparation methods to
restore customer confidence.
<p>
   ``It's probably the safest place to buy perishables now,'' said
Salomon Brothers analyst Jonathon Ziegler.
<p>
   Sales, however, are not increasing as quickly as they had before
the show, when Food Lion was the fastest-growing grocer in the
country. And its net income hasn't recovered since 1992.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.

    &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a two-part excerpt of ``A
History of the Breast'' (Knopf) by Marilyn Yalom.
 &UR; By MARILYN YALOM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<p>
   Christian Dior's oft-quoted statement that ``without foundations
there can be no fashion'' has been meaningful for the past 700
years.
 &UR; STAYING PUT WITH CORSETS OF WOOD AND WHALEBONE &LR; 
<p>
   In the early 14th century, when women abandoned the loose tunics
that had previously been worn by both sexes in favor of
tighter-fitting clothes, undergarments began their fashionable
ascent.
<p>
   The stiff, clinging underbodice known as a ``cotte'' defined the
new thin ideal. Large-busted women bound strips of cloth around
their chests to acquire the small-breasted look then in favor.
<p>
   Some kind of breast support was now considered essential to the
wardrobe of any self-respecting lady, and from that time until the
beginning of our own century, breasts were supported mainly by
corsets.
<p>
   Corsets became truly formidable in the 15th century with the
invention of the ``body'' or ``pair of bodys'' in Spain. This
armorlike structure, consisting of two pieces hinged together at
the sides, made its way from the trendsetting Spanish court into
French and English high society during the 16th century.
<p>
   Strengthened with slats of wood and whalebone, and sometimes
made of leather or even metal, the ``body'' was worn as an
undergarment or, in some versions, as an outer garment.
<p>
   It is possible that the metal versions (which have survived in a
few museums) were used only for orthopedic cases, but there is no
doubt that upper-class women subjected themselves to the agony of
being encased in ``bodys'' stiffened by paste, leather, wood and
whalebone.
<p>
   The French version, alternately called a ``corset'' or a
``corps'' (body), was a kind of girdle that fit tightly across the
chest from beneath the breasts to beneath the ribs and ended in a
point on the stomach.
<p>
   In most French and English versions, a single bone, wood, ivory,
horn or metal busk was placed in the middle of the corset to
maintain its rigidity. This was the origin of all the boning and
similar devices designed to support the figure that developed in
corsetry over the next 400 years.
<p>
   Made by specialist craftsmen and often engraved with amorous
verses, the busk itself became an erotic object, the subject of
boudoir poems and public gestures. It was considered daring to pull
the central busk out from the bodice and to gesture with it as a
form of flirtation.
<p>
   The cultivation of the breast as a fashion icon took on new
commercial dimensions around 1670, when staymaking became a
distinct branch of tailoring.
<p>
   Corsets were a must for bourgeois and noble ladies, marking
their distinction from the popular classes. Some even wore their
lightly boned ``corps de nuit'' or ``corsets de nuit'' in bed.
<p>
   From the mid-18th century, a campaign against the corset raged
through much of Europe. Under the banners of science and reason,
and in step with the campaign against wet nursing, doctors in every
country militated against the corset on the grounds that it
deformed women's bodies.
<p>
   One of the first fashion changes of the French Revolution was
the exile of the corset. But before long, the corset reappeared in
both long and short models.
<p>
   The ``Empire waist,'' fashionable throughout Europe during the
reign of Napoleon (1804-1815), broke with all previous conventions
by raising the waist to the area immediately under the breasts. In
this manner the breasts became the undisputed center of attention.
<p>
   With the Restoration of the French monarchy in 18l5 and the
triumph of political conservatism throughout Europe, the waist
descended back to its natural level.
 &UR; FROM `DIVORCE CORSETS' TO FRENCH FALSIES &LR; 
<p>
   Around 1816, it was fashionable for breasts to be far apart from
one another. The ``Divorce Corset'' separated the breasts by means
of a padded triangle of iron or steel which was inserted into the
center front of the corset with its point upward.
<p>
   It became the rage in both France and England, although the
English quickly reverted to the unified, shelflike bust.
<p>
   At this time, in both France and England, corsets were still
beyond the reach of the working class. When the Swiss industrialist
Jean Werly installed the first corset factory at Bar-le-Duc in
France, cheaper mass-produced models became available.
<p>
   The mid-19th century was a time of major innovation in
undergarment production. Eyelet holes began to be strengthened with
metal rings. India rubber and elastic began to vie with whalebone
to produce the desired compression and support.
<p>
   Waistlines moved up and down, dropping below the normal waist
around 1840 and rising again in the late 1850s with the advent of
the crinoline (a stiffened petticoat or ``hoop'').
<p>
   The exaggerated hourglass figure required that waists be laced
in so tightly that some women reputedly died from the strain. A
waist measurement of 17 to 21 inches represented the ideal.
<p>
   Stays with front fastenings were introduced in England in the
1850s, and gradually all but replaced the backlaced model. The
French produced an astonishing variety of specialized corsets in a
wide array of materials and colors.
<p>
   To judge from the ads, which by now were appearing in fashion
magazines, a Frenchwoman had nothing better to do than spend her
time changing between leisure corsets, sleeping corsets, pregnancy
corsets, nursing corsets and corsets for horseback riding, bathing
and bicycling.
<p>
   By the end of the century, French corsetry was at the pinnacle
of its commercial heights.
<p>
   Falsies or ``bust improvers'' were commonly used throughout this
period. Made from cup-shaped wire structures or flexible celluloid,
or pieces of material with circular pockets into which a pad could
be inserted, English models promised to ``give roundness to those
that are too slim.''
<p>
   French falsies were fashioned out of ``peau de chamois,'' padded
satin, or, most frequently, rubber. American ``bust pads'' could be
bought in exclusive foundation stores or ordered cheaply through
the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.
<p>
   Surely one of the weirdest breast-augmenting gimmicks was ``The
Bust Developer''  &MD;  a three-part program including a jar of cream, a
bottle of lotion and a metal object resembling a bathroom plunger.
The bust developer was made of nickel and aluminum, and came in two
sizes, either a 4- or 5-inch diameter.
<p>
   The transition from the corset to the brassiere that took place
in the first decades of the 20th century represented a major
breakthrough for women. For the first time, a separate garment was
designed exclusively for the breasts.
<p>
   A French department store advertising its 1899-1890 corset
collection introduced the ``soutien-gorge'' (literally, ``throat
support''), in which the breasts were supported from above, by
shoulder straps, rather than from below. The soutien-gorge was the
mother of the modern brassiere.

<p>
    &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a two-part excerpt of ``A
History of the Breast'' (Knopf) by Marilyn Yalom.
 &UR; By MARILYN YALOM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<p>
   The first patented U.S. brassiere was the chance invention of a
New York debutante, Mary Phelps Jacobs. Dressing for a dance, she
abandoned the heavy evening corset laid out before her and, with
the help of her French maid, fitted herself out with two
handkerchiefs and pink ribbon.
<p>
   Afterward, she made a few copies for her friends, and patented
the design in 1914 under the name of Caresse Crosby, calling it the
``Backless Brassiere.'' Eventually she sold her rights to the
Warner Brothers Corset Company for $1,500 dollars. The patent was
later valued at $15 million.
<p>
   It took time for the word ``brassiere'' to supersede all the
other English terms. Vogue magazine first used it in 1907, and the
Oxford English Dictionary in 1912.
 &UR; FLATTENED FLAPPERS &LR; 
<p>
   During the period surrounding World War I, the kinds of corsets
and brassieres that were available to women varied greatly. Already
in 19l2, the French were beginning to favor the flat-chested look
that would become fashionable after the war.
<p>
   The '20s represent one of those historical anomalies when women
sought to minimize their chests. Flappers strove for plank figures
that would allow their long pearls to fall perfectly straight over
their tuniclike dresses. Industry responded with bandeau bras that
flattened the breasts and made them disappear into a boyish
silhouette.
<p>
   Rayon, developed around 1900, began to be used more and more
frequently in the production of less-expensive lingerie. For the
first time, women with limited means were able to have the
appearance of luxury by wearing rayon brassieres that resembled
silk or satin.
<p>
   The accent was on simplicity, freedom and stylish abandon, as
can be seen in a 1928 ad that pictured a woman in a tubular
one-piece undergarment joyfully throwing away her old brassiere,
girdle, bloomers and slip.
<p>
   Yet not all women wanted to look like boys. Two young women, Ida
Rosenthal and Enid Bissett, who were partners in a New York dress
firm, found the flattened look unattractive and downright
uncomfortable. Instead, in the early '20s, they built into each of
their dresses an undergarment that emphasized the more natural
contours of the bust.
<p>
   Clients soon returned asking for separate brassieres, and by
1925 the partners were producing and selling nothing but
brassieres. With the help of Ida's husband, William Rosenthal, a
patent was filed in 1926 for a brassiere ``to support the bust in a
natural position.'' Such were the beginnings of the Maiden Form
Brassiere Company.
<p>
   The women of the '30s adopted the simple formula that would be
with us for the rest of the century  &MD;  bra and underpants. (By this
time the word ``bra,'' instead of ``brassiere'' had become
current.) Full slips and half-slips, girdles and garter belts,
corsets and one-piece ``combinations'' vied for shelf space in the
department stores, but the bra and underpants became every woman's
staples.
<p>
   The new brassieres were becoming more and more functional,
especially after the invention of Lastex, the yarn with the ``two-
way stretch.'' The Warner's company was one of the first
manufacturers to popularize elastic bras, and in 1935 it also
created the system of cups in variable sizes, from A to D, which
became the model for brassiere sizing throughout the world.
<p>
   In 1938, Du Pont announced its discovery of nylon  &MD;  a highly
resistant synthetic thread that would once again revolutionize the
fashion industry.
<p>
   Nylon stockings and underwear were already in the marketplace by
1939, but two years later, when the United States entered World War
II, nylon was mobilized for the war effort. Women would have to
wait until the war was over for their nylon bras.
 &UR; BULLET BRAS AND `GAY DECEIVERS' &LR; 
<p>
   When the war ended, American companies were ready to launch a
whole new line of underwear using the parachute silk, rayon and
nylon tricot that rapidly became available. New techniques of
crisscross or ``whirlpool'' stitching were employed to create cone-
shaped bra cups.
<p>
   These ``torpedo'' brassieres made each breast look like a
projectile about to be launched. Maiden Form's circle-stitched
Chansonette, introduced in 1949 and quickly dubbed the ``bullet
bra,'' would become its most popular model, selling almost 90
million units in over 100 countries during the next 30 years.
(Women with small breasts looked to padded bras and ``gay
deceivers'' for the appearance of a larger bust.)
 &UR; `INVISIBLE' BRAS, JOGBRAS AND WONDERAS &LR;

   In the early 1960s, brassieres began to move away from the stiff
forms of the previous decade. Warner's 1963 elastic Stretch-bra was
a veritable innovation, quickly imitated by other manufacturers.
Rudi Gernreich, best known for the invention of the topless
swimsuit, designed the ``no-bra bra'' in 1965, which gave support
despite the transparent effect that one was wearing nothing
underneath.
<p>
   The sexual revolution of the late '60s and early '70s cast off
the bra as an oppressive yoke. Feminists accused lingerie designers
of packaging breasts according to men's  &MD;  rather than women's  &MD; 
specifications. They asked why women were obliged to play into
men's fantasies with rigid torpedo shells, rather than comfortable
bras suitable for a living person.
<p>
   In response to the new unisexual ideal, manufacturers created
brassieres that were as light and as discreet as possible. Warner's
1969 Invisible bra came close to the political wish for no bra at
all.
<p>
   In the late '70s, a new market was discovered in
athletic-support undergarments, initially inspired by the jogging
craze that had overtaken America. Women runners demanded underwear
that could ``go the distance.''
<p>
   In 1977, two running enthusiasts stitched two male jockstraps
together to form the prototype for the Jogbra. Very quickly, sport
bras offering ``motion control'' became a major subcategory of the
underwear business.
<p>
   From the late '70s to the mid-'80s, more traditional forms of
lingerie slowly crept back into the marketplace. Victoria's Secret,
bringing sexy, affordable underwear to the masses, opened its first
stores in 1982, and spread like wildflowers through America's
shopping centers.
<p>
   Other manufacturers developed new models of highly-feminine
brassieres in a dazzling array of cotton, lace, satin, nylon and
Lycra models that rivaled the old corset industry at its best.
<p>
   In December 1988, The Wall Street Journal announced that
``Breasts are back in style.'' It pointed to the foundation garment
of the moment: the push-up bra, with its multimillion-dollar sales.
It took note of new cosmetic treatments for the bust, and the
growing demand for more bosomy high-fashion models.
<p>
   By 1994, bras had become a $3 billion dollar U.S. industry. That
year was to mark one of the most heralded episodes in underwear
history  &MD;  the invasion of the Wonderbra.
<p>
   Created 30 years earlier, the Wonderbra languished in obscurity
until 1991, when supermodels started showing up for photo shoots in
New York wearing the Wonderbras they had found in London. In May
1994, when the bra first went on sale in New York, it sold 3,000
units in 10 days.
<p>
   We'll probably have to wait another decade for a reappearance of
the androgynous figure so popular in the ``liberated'' '20s and the
liberal '60s. With the flat-chested cycle occurring every 40 years,
according to our 20th-century sample of two cycles, we should
expect to see the return of androgyny sometime after the year 2000.
Manufacturers, take note.

    &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a two-part excerpt of ``A
History of the Breast'' (Knopf) by Marilyn Yalom.
 &UR; By MARILYN YALOM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<p>
   Christian Dior's oft-quoted statement that ``without foundations
there can be no fashion'' has been meaningful for the past 700
years.
 &UR; STAYING PUT WITH CORSETS OF WOOD AND WHALEBONE &LR; 
<p>
   In the early 14th century, when women abandoned the loose tunics
that had previously been worn by both sexes in favor of
tighter-fitting clothes, undergarments began their fashionable
ascent.
<p>
   The stiff, clinging underbodice known as a ``cotte'' defined the
new thin ideal. Large-busted women bound strips of cloth around
their chests to acquire the small-breasted look then in favor.
<p>
   Some kind of breast support was now considered essential to the
wardrobe of any self-respecting lady, and from that time until the
beginning of our own century, breasts were supported mainly by
corsets.
<p>
   Corsets became truly formidable in the 15th century with the
invention of the ``body'' or ``pair of bodys'' in Spain. This
armorlike structure, consisting of two pieces hinged together at
the sides, made its way from the trendsetting Spanish court into
French and English high society during the 16th century.
<p>
   Strengthened with slats of wood and whalebone, and sometimes
made of leather or even metal, the ``body'' was worn as an
undergarment or, in some versions, as an outer garment.
<p>
   It is possible that the metal versions (which have survived in a
few museums) were used only for orthopedic cases, but there is no
doubt that upper-class women subjected themselves to the agony of
being encased in ``bodys'' stiffened by paste, leather, wood and
whalebone.
<p>
   The French version, alternately called a ``corset'' or a
``corps'' (body), was a kind of girdle that fit tightly across the
chest from beneath the breasts to beneath the ribs and ended in a
point on the stomach.
<p>
   In most French and English versions, a single bone, wood, ivory,
horn or metal busk was placed in the middle of the corset to
maintain its rigidity. This was the origin of all the boning and
similar devices designed to support the figure that developed in
corsetry over the next 400 years.
<p>
   Made by specialist craftsmen and often engraved with amorous
verses, the busk itself became an erotic object, the subject of
boudoir poems and public gestures. It was considered daring to pull
the central busk out from the bodice and to gesture with it as a
form of flirtation.
<p>
   The cultivation of the breast as a fashion icon took on new
commercial dimensions around 1670, when staymaking became a
distinct branch of tailoring.
<p>
   Corsets were a must for bourgeois and noble ladies, marking
their distinction from the popular classes. Some even wore their
lightly boned ``corps de nuit'' or ``corsets de nuit'' in bed.
<p>
   From the mid-18th century, a campaign against the corset raged
through much of Europe. Under the banners of science and reason,
and in step with the campaign against wet nursing, doctors in every
country militated against the corset on the grounds that it
deformed women's bodies.
<p>
   One of the first fashion changes of the French Revolution was
the exile of the corset. But before long, the corset reappeared in
both long and short models.
<p>
   The ``Empire waist,'' fashionable throughout Europe during the
reign of Napoleon (1804-1815), broke with all previous conventions
by raising the waist to the area immediately under the breasts. In
this manner the breasts became the undisputed center of attention.
<p>
   With the Restoration of the French monarchy in 18l5 and the
triumph of political conservatism throughout Europe, the waist
descended back to its natural level.
 &UR; FROM `DIVORCE CORSETS' TO FRENCH FALSIES &LR; 
<p>
   Around 1816, it was fashionable for breasts to be far apart from
one another. The ``Divorce Corset'' separated the breasts by means
of a padded triangle of iron or steel which was inserted into the
center front of the corset with its point upward.
<p>
   It became the rage in both France and England, although the
English quickly reverted to the unified, shelflike bust.
<p>
   At this time, in both France and England, corsets were still
beyond the reach of the working class. When the Swiss industrialist
Jean Werly installed the first corset factory at Bar-le-Duc in
France, cheaper mass-produced models became available.
<p>
   The mid-19th century was a time of major innovation in
undergarment production. Eyelet holes began to be strengthened with
metal rings. India rubber and elastic began to vie with whalebone
to produce the desired compression and support.
<p>
   Waistlines moved up and down, dropping below the normal waist
around 1840 and rising again in the late 1850s with the advent of
the crinoline (a stiffened petticoat or ``hoop'').
<p>
   The exaggerated hourglass figure required that waists be laced
in so tightly that some women reputedly died from the strain. A
waist measurement of 17 to 21 inches represented the ideal.
<p>
   Stays with front fastenings were introduced in England in the
1850s, and gradually all but replaced the backlaced model. The
French produced an astonishing variety of specialized corsets in a
wide array of materials and colors.
<p>
   To judge from the ads, which by now were appearing in fashion
magazines, a Frenchwoman had nothing better to do than spend her
time changing between leisure corsets, sleeping corsets, pregnancy
corsets, nursing corsets and corsets for horseback riding, bathing
and bicycling.
<p>
   By the end of the century, French corsetry was at the pinnacle
of its commercial heights.
<p>
   Falsies or ``bust improvers'' were commonly used throughout this
period. Made from cup-shaped wire structures or flexible celluloid,
or pieces of material with circular pockets into which a pad could
be inserted, English models promised to ``give roundness to those
that are too slim.''
<p>
   French falsies were fashioned out of ``peau de chamois,'' padded
satin, or, most frequently, rubber. American ``bust pads'' could be
bought in exclusive foundation stores or ordered cheaply through
the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.
<p>
   Surely one of the weirdest breast-augmenting gimmicks was ``The
Bust Developer''  &MD;  a three-part program including a jar of cream, a
bottle of lotion and a metal object resembling a bathroom plunger.
The bust developer was made of nickel and aluminum, and came in two
sizes, either a 4- or 5-inch diameter.
<p>
   The transition from the corset to the brassiere that took place
in the first decades of the 20th century represented a major
breakthrough for women. For the first time, a separate garment was
designed exclusively for the breasts.
<p>
   A French department store advertising its 1899-1890 corset
collection introduced the ``soutien-gorge'' (literally, ``throat
support''), in which the breasts were supported from above, by
shoulder straps, rather than from below. The soutien-gorge was the
mother of the modern brassiere.

<p>
    &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a two-part excerpt of ``A
History of the Breast'' (Knopf) by Marilyn Yalom.
 &UR; By MARILYN YALOM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<p>
   The first patented U.S. brassiere was the chance invention of a
New York debutante, Mary Phelps Jacobs. Dressing for a dance, she
abandoned the heavy evening corset laid out before her and, with
the help of her French maid, fitted herself out with two
handkerchiefs and pink ribbon.
<p>
   Afterward, she made a few copies for her friends, and patented
the design in 1914 under the name of Caresse Crosby, calling it the
``Backless Brassiere.'' Eventually she sold her rights to the
Warner Brothers Corset Company for $1,500 dollars. The patent was
later valued at $15 million.
<p>
   It took time for the word ``brassiere'' to supersede all the
other English terms. Vogue magazine first used it in 1907, and the
Oxford English Dictionary in 1912.
 &UR; FLATTENED FLAPPERS &LR; 
<p>
   During the period surrounding World War I, the kinds of corsets
and brassieres that were available to women varied greatly. Already
in 19l2, the French were beginning to favor the flat-chested look
that would become fashionable after the war.
<p>
   The '20s represent one of those historical anomalies when women
sought to minimize their chests. Flappers strove for plank figures
that would allow their long pearls to fall perfectly straight over
their tuniclike dresses. Industry responded with bandeau bras that
flattened the breasts and made them disappear into a boyish
silhouette.
<p>
   Rayon, developed around 1900, began to be used more and more
frequently in the production of less-expensive lingerie. For the
first time, women with limited means were able to have the
appearance of luxury by wearing rayon brassieres that resembled
silk or satin.
<p>
   The accent was on simplicity, freedom and stylish abandon, as
can be seen in a 1928 ad that pictured a woman in a tubular
one-piece undergarment joyfully throwing away her old brassiere,
girdle, bloomers and slip.
<p>
   Yet not all women wanted to look like boys. Two young women, Ida
Rosenthal and Enid Bissett, who were partners in a New York dress
firm, found the flattened look unattractive and downright
uncomfortable. Instead, in the early '20s, they built into each of
their dresses an undergarment that emphasized the more natural
contours of the bust.
<p>
   Clients soon returned asking for separate brassieres, and by
1925 the partners were producing and selling nothing but
brassieres. With the help of Ida's husband, William Rosenthal, a
patent was filed in 1926 for a brassiere ``to support the bust in a
natural position.'' Such were the beginnings of the Maiden Form
Brassiere Company.
<p>
   The women of the '30s adopted the simple formula that would be
with us for the rest of the century  &MD;  bra and underpants. (By this
time the word ``bra,'' instead of ``brassiere'' had become
current.) Full slips and half-slips, girdles and garter belts,
corsets and one-piece ``combinations'' vied for shelf space in the
department stores, but the bra and underpants became every woman's
staples.
<p>
   The new brassieres were becoming more and more functional,
especially after the invention of Lastex, the yarn with the ``two-
way stretch.'' The Warner's company was one of the first
manufacturers to popularize elastic bras, and in 1935 it also
created the system of cups in variable sizes, from A to D, which
became the model for brassiere sizing throughout the world.
<p>
   In 1938, Du Pont announced its discovery of nylon  &MD;  a highly
resistant synthetic thread that would once again revolutionize the
fashion industry.
<p>
   Nylon stockings and underwear were already in the marketplace by
1939, but two years later, when the United States entered World War
II, nylon was mobilized for the war effort. Women would have to
wait until the war was over for their nylon bras.
 &UR; BULLET BRAS AND `GAY DECEIVERS' &LR; 
<p>
   When the war ended, American companies were ready to launch a
whole new line of underwear using the parachute silk, rayon and
nylon tricot that rapidly became available. New techniques of
crisscross or ``whirlpool'' stitching were employed to create cone-
shaped bra cups.
<p>
   These ``torpedo'' brassieres made each breast look like a
projectile about to be launched. Maiden Form's circle-stitched
Chansonette, introduced in 1949 and quickly dubbed the ``bullet
bra,'' would become its most popular model, selling almost 90
million units in over 100 countries during the next 30 years.
(Women with small breasts looked to padded bras and ``gay
deceivers'' for the appearance of a larger bust.)
 &UR; `INVISIBLE' BRAS, JOGBRAS AND WONDERAS &LR; 
<p>
   In the early 1960s, brassieres began to move away from the stiff
forms of the previous decade. Warner's 1963 elastic Stretch-bra was

   Imagine wearing a corset strengthened with wood, whalebone  &MD; 
even metal. Or an undergarment that cinches your waist into a
17-inch ``hourglass'' shape. These are just some of the indignities
 &MD;  and dangers  &MD;  women have endured in their centuries-long quest to
live up to an ever-changing ideal of feminine beauty.
<p>
   This fascinating two-part series about the evolution of lingerie
is excerpted from ``A History of the Breast'' (Knopf) by Marilyn
Yalom, a senior scholar at the Institute for Women and Gender at
Stanford University.

being laced into a long corset; a 1897 Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.

first patented ``soutien-gorge'' brassiere.)
<p>
   The evolution of lingerie begins in the early 14th century, when
women abandon loose tunics in favor of tighter-fitting clothes.
Corsets are crafted of wood, whalebone, leather  &MD;  even metal. By
the mid-1800s there are corsets for sleeping, horseback riding,
bathing and bicycling, and by end of the century, plungerlike
``bust developers'' are being marketed in women's magazines. Not
long after, the first modern-day brassiere  &MD;  one in which the
breasts are supported from above by shoulder straps  &MD;  makes its
debut. By Marilyn Yalom. Excerpted from ``A History of the Breast''
(Knopf). 1,100 words. (slugged: BC-THE-BIRTH-OF-THE-BRA-(BOOK
EXCERPT/PART 1)-ART-NYTSF)
 &UR; PART TWO: 20TH-CENTURY BRASSIERES  &MD;  FROM HANDKERCHIEFS AND RIBBON
TO BULLET BRAS, JOGBRAS AND WONDERBRAS &LR; 
 &UR; (Available art: color slides and B&AMP;W prints of a 1962 Maiden Form
bra ad; B&AMP;W prints of a 1927 Maiden Form bra ad; B&AMP;W illustration
of a Scanties advertisement, 1928.)
<p>
   In 1914 the first patented U.S. brassiere is invented by New
York debutante Mary Phelps Jacobs, who, while dressing for a dance,
abandons the heavy evening corset laid out by her maid and instead
fits herself with two handkerchiefs and a pink ribbon. During the
decades that follow large breasts go in and out of style several
times. Rayon, Lastex and nylon make bras more comfortable than
ever, and manufacturers respond to social trends and fashion whims
with such innovations the ``invisible'' bra, the Jogbra and the
Wonderbra. By Marilyn Yalom. Excerpted from ``A History of the
Breast'' (Knopf). 1,200 words. (slugged:

<p>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas  &MD;  I was standing in line at the
department store checkout counter. The nice lady clerk was fanning
herself with a sales slip.
<p>
   ``Whoo-ee,'' she intoned. ``Is it just me, or is it hot in
here?''
<p>
   I said it was hot. The customer next to me said he thought it
was just right. Right away I knew he was a Yankee.
<p>
   Not just from the way he was dressed, wearing a fresh polo shirt
with the label on the pocket and hardly faded at all, and pleated
britches starchy crisp.
<p>
   East Texans tend to wear wilted blue jeans and checkered shirts
with button-down collars that, on less formal occasions, are left
loose and curled at the tips.
<p>
   Neither was it his accent that branded him an outsider, though
from the way he spoke you could tell he was from somewhere way off
 &MD;  either that, or he was on TV.
<p>
   East Texans have a slow way of talking. Not only do we say what
we think, we talk like we think. We tend to drop certain letters
and, in the process, pick up others.
<p>
   Concrete, for example, is likely to come out concreek. Saturday
turns into Satiddy. Even our Southern accent has an accent. You-all
is yawl.
<p>
   Personally, I'm hoping this idea that black English is a
language unto itself will catch on, what they're calling Ebonics  &MD; 
a combination of ebony and phonics.
<p>
   If so, maybe they'll cut East Texans a little slack, too, on the
way we talk  &MD;  Redneconics, if you will.
<p>
   But I digress.
<p>
   Getting back to the Yankee fellow who was standing back of me in
the line, a nice-looking older gent with white hair and matching
beard, neatly trimmed.
<p>
   I asked him what I already knew.
<p>
   ``That's not an East Texas accent, is it?''
<p>
   He looked at me for a long moment, as if I were accusing him of
something he didn't want to admit to.
<p>
   ``Actually,'' he said, trying to talk slower, ``it's a mixture
that comes from many places.''
<p>
   This got the lady clerk's attention. ``Like whar?'' she asked,
narrowing her eyes.
<p>
   Minnesota, for one place. Vermont for another. Even the
Caribbean Islands, he said.
<p>
   ``But I like it here best,'' he said, ``especially the
weather.''
<p>
   That, of course, is how I knew him for what he was, an outsider,
when the lady clerk had asked us if it felt too hot in the store.
No East Texan will ever admit to the temperature being just right.
<p>
   I tried to explain as much to him, but there's just so much
other people can understand, even if they live among us.
<p>
   ``Where I originally came from it's 20 degrees below zero,'' he
said. ``Your weather is wonderful. How can you fault it?''
<p>
   ``It's the humidity,'' the lady clerk said, lowering her voice
as if it were a secret.
<p>
   He shook his head. ``It reminds me of the Caribbean,'' he
allowed. ``I love it here.''
<p>
   Well, so do we. People who have lived here all their lives and
have never been anywhere are quick to tell you East Texas is the
best place in the world, forever and ever, amen.
<p>
   Just so long as you don't ask us about the weather at the wrong
time of the year.
<p>
   Those times being spring and summer, fall and winter.

<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  In his time, Curt Flood was an original. A Gold Glove
center fielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, he was also a brooder
and a painter and an iconoclast whose active and nervous
intelligence drove him not only to question authority, but to blow
it up.
<p>
   Curt Flood took baseball to the wall.
<p>
   He took unfavorable and costly action against the people who
made up the rules.
<p>
   In 1969, Flood refused to report for duty after the Cardinals
traded him to the Phillies. Instead of accepting his fate, Flood
took his sense of outrage and injustice all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
<p>
   He would not be treated like meat.
<p>
   As a 12-year veteran, he should have some say in what happened
to him.
<p>
   He fought a system that bound Mickey Mantle to the Yankees, Bob
Gibson to the Cardinals and Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers.
<p>
   Flood lost his case. But it is his undying legacy that his fight
enabled others after him to win.
<p>
   But what about this winning?
<p>
   What about the new world order in sports that Curt Flood
invented by calling himself a ``free agent?''
<p>
   We don't have Curt Floods in sports these days. Mostly because
we don't need them, or so it would seem.
<p>
   Today's battles are about the bottom line.
<p>
   Everyone's a star. Everyone's a corporation. Too many players
think they are as big if not bigger than the game, which is a
notion affirmed by their sneaker makers.
<p>
   Gary Payton and Ken Griffey Jr. and Andre Agassi are not only
bound to the NBA, Major League Baseball or the ATP, they are bound
to each other, as ``part of the Nike family.''
<p>
   These guys say these things. And mean it.
<p>
   Twenty-five years ago, Flood did all the dirty work for freedom
and the rights of an individual player to make their own deals,
their best deals.
<p>
   But now, it's 180 degrees wrong the other way.
<p>
   The time line from Curt Flood's righteous and right-on protest
down to Dennis Rodman's latest NBA suspension is filled with other
eruptions and episodes that have radically changed the climate in
which athletes labor.
<p>
   But certainly, a quarter century later, free agency has turned
into free lunacy.
<p>
   Now it's bad as you wanna be.
<p>
   Now it's rich rewards not for substance and convictions, but for
House of Style cameos and fishnet pants and tie-dyed hair that is
only half as mixed up as the stuff inside a Dennis Rodman cranium.
<p>
   Instead of Curt Flood, we get Dennis Rodman as the most
flamboyant symbol of our sporting era  &MD;  with Nike and Converse and
MTV willing to bank their profit margins on a guy who is mistakenly
marketed as the brave one, willing to live out his fantasies in
public.
<p>
   I have a fantasy, too. It's that Nike, Converse and MTV would
cut Rodman loose. Rodman unplugged. For his sake. For ours. So we
can concentrate on other players who are trying to do the right
thing, even though it's hard to figure that out.
<p>
   Sports can give us heroes and role models. Sports can give us
real revolutionaries, not just rebels without a clue.
<p>
   On NBC last Sunday, as the Rodman-less Bulls were getting
hammered by the Rockets, commentator and former NBA great Julius
Erving made a personal plea to Rodman, who was missing game No. 2
of an 11-game (maybe longer) suspension.
<p>
   Erving said one day, when Rodman is done with his career, either
through retirement or exile, he will regret that he never gave
anything back to the game.
<p>
   Erving's plea seemed just as naive as it was earnest.
<p>
   The very idea that Rodman should recognize his responsibility to
give something back to the game seems as far-fetched as his wedding
dress publicity stunts.
<p>
   Rodman, whose free agency landed him a one-year, $10 million
deal with the Bulls this season, is making the Forbes big money
list because he refuses to accept the larger responsibility that
most NBA players, and most athletes, eventually come to accept.
<p>
   Rodman is living proof that humans, unfortunately, need a few
checks and balances to keep things from exploding.
<p>
   ``We all have times of frustration when we want to retaliate,
but we know we can't,'' Michael Jordan said when asked for his take
on Rodman's groin-kicking of a courtside cameraman.
<p>
   Well, this week, when Curt Flood died of cancer, the world lost
a man who fought the good fight for a cause that was worthy of his
anger and frustration and worthy of retaliation.
<p>
   For that, Flood never got the chance to finish what he started.
His .296 career batting average, seven Gold Gloves and three
All-Star appearances had all the makings of a Hall of Fame career.
<p>
   But he traded it to make a stand.
<p>
   Rodman, a gifted athlete who has re-created the art of defense
and rebounding with his tireless effort, is about to trade his for
nothing except the right to be as bad as he wants to be, just
because he thinks he's the boldest sign of our times.
<p>
   Here's hoping history is not as kind to Dennis Rodman as it has
been and will be to Curt Flood.

<p>
   Greensboro, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A federal
jury told Walt Disney Co.'s ABC television network to pay Food Lion
Inc. $5.5 million in punitive damages for having two news producers
lie to get jobs at the supermarket chain.
<p>
   The verdict stunned media lawyers, since Food Lion never
challenged the truth of the resulting 1992 ``PrimeTime Live''
expose, which showed workers disguising and selling out-of-date
meat.
<p>
   Lawyers said the verdict, if it holds up on appeal, will spur
similar suits and reduce the number of investigations that use
hidden cameras. The award comes after several lesser-known rulings
aimed at how the media gathers news.
<p>
   ``People are going to think three or four times before they do
something like this,'' said Robert Sack, a libel defense lawyer for
Time Inc., the Wall Street Journal and Newsday. ``There are going
to be stories about health, safety and other possible misdeeds that
will never get out.''
<p>
   ABC said it would appeal ``through all available channels'' if
U.S. District Judge Carlton Tilley doesn't set the verdict aside.
<p>
   Other lawyers said the award is likely to be reduced, since it
is several thousand times the $1,402 in actual damages that the
jury awarded Food Lion last month.
<p>
   Food Lion's Class A shares rose 1/16 to 9 1/8 in trading of
602,400, more than its three-month daily average of 479,000.
Disney's stock rose 1 to 70 3/4.
<p>
   ``We're very satisfied with the verdict,'' said Food Lion
attorney Richard Wyatt.
<p>
   After more than five days of hard-fought deliberations, the
12-member jury decided that ABC and PrimeTime executives
consciously broke fraud laws to get undercover footage.
<p>
   Two lower-level producers faked resumes to get Food Lion jobs
where they could report on and film the company's practices through
small cameras hidden in wigs and clothing.
<p>
   Salisbury, North Carolina-based Food Lion claimed the report
cost it more than $2 billion in lost profit and stock value. Judge
Tilley barred Food Lion from using the content of the broadcast as
evidence.
<p>
   The jury, which last week said it was deadlocked 11-1, spared
the two producers, directing two higher-ranking ABC executives to
pay a combined $45,750. Former ``PrimeTime'' executive producer
Richard Kaplan, now elsewhere at ABC, was told to pay $35,000 and
Senior Producer Ira Rosen was ordered to pay $10,750.
<p>
   ABC said it would pay as much as legally possible of the
individual awards.
<p>
   The judgment ``should trouble every American,'' the network said
in a statement. ``Food Lion has succeeded in convincing a jury to
punish ABC for using undercover investigating techniques that
exposed its unsanitary practices.''
<p>
   Jurors said the verdict was intended only to warn the media that
they have to obey the law and not make false statements.
<p>
   ``No one wants to handcuff the media,'' said jury foreman Greg
Mack. ``The real problem came (because) ABC had no guidelines.''
<p>
   Tony Kinton, a brewery worker in Reidsville, North Carolina, was
the lone juror that hadn't wanted to award any punitive damages.
Others wanted to award billions of dollars and some expressed their
opinions before hearing any evidence, he said.
<p>
   ``We had no choice,'' Kinton said. ``We were going to send a
message to the press that there are limitations.''
<p>
   The media said it got the message loud and clear.
<p>
   ``The real loser is the public,'' said Bruce Sanford, a libel
attorney in Washington, D.C. ``All we will get are more stories on
Dennis Rodman.''
<p>
   The verdict is the latest in a series of court decisions aimed
not at the content of news reports but at newsgathering techniques.
<p>
   Rulings in the past year have allowed juries to consider whether
reporters invaded the privacy of accident victims and barred a
camera crew from following the son of an executive at U.S.
Healthcare Inc.
<p>
   ``People are angry at people who gather the news and the way
they gather the news, even when it is in the public interest,''
said libel lawyer Sack, of the New York firm Gibson, Dunn &AMP;
Crutcher.
<p>
   In the Food Lion case, the Greensboro, North Carolina, jury last
month awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages, mostly for the
salaries earned by the producers at the stores.
<p>
   Sack and other legal experts predicted that the gap between the
small compensatory damages and the multimillion-dollar punitive
award would prompt the judge or the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to reduce the amount of punitive damages.
<p>
   The slight rise in Food Lion's shares indicates that investors
realize that the chain must do more to win back customers, analysts
said. Food Lion has already revamped its stores and preparation
methods to restore customer confidence.
<p>
   ``It's probably the safest place to buy perishables now,'' said
Salomon Brothers analyst Jonathon Ziegler.
<p>
   Sales, however, are not increasing as quickly as they had before
the show, when Food Lion was the fastest-growing grocer in the
country. And its net income hasn't recovered since 1992.
<p>
   Belgian grocery chain Delhaize-Le Lion SA owns about half Food
Lion's voting stock.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
disappointing earnings from International Business Machines Corp.
kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average from setting another record.
Rising health and bank shares boosted the broader market.
<p>
   The Dow industrials fell 33.87 to 6850.03, snapping a streak of
four consecutive closing highs. IBM dropped 10 3/8 to 157 5/8.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose to a record,
gaining 3.50 to 786.22, Leading the advance were Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Exxon Corp. and Intel Corp. all of which reported strong earnings
in the past 10 days. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 11.07 to an
all-time high of 1388.04.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't think the market's overvalued in the context of
all of the positives: You have declining interest rates, corporate
America's become more profitable and more competitive. We're in an
hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Investors pouring money into mutual funds continued to boost
shares. The S&AMP;P 500 Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter that tracks
money going to mutual funds, said assets are pouring in at a $28.4
billion monthly pace, $500 million short of the record set last
January.
<p>
   ``You're having tremendous demand for stocks,'' said Philip
Brown, president of Meridian Investment Co., with $3.7 billion in
equities. ``You have an economy that isn't doing that bad.
Corporate profits aren't declining -- they just aren't going to be
up as much.''
<p>
   IBM, up 56 percent in the past year, said profit rose 18 percent
as a stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hampered growth. Net
income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3 cents below
analysts' expectations. The 6 percent decline in IBM shares reduced
their value to their mid-December level.
<p>
   Coming on the heels of surprisingly good numbers from Intel and
Microsoft, other computer-industry shares held up amid IBM's
retreat.
<p>
   Computer maker Dell Computer Corp. rose 2 5/8 to 66 3/4. Gateway
2000 Inc., a computer retailer, rose 3 1/2 to 62 5/8. Microsoft
rose 2 3/8 to 97 3/8 and Intel jumped 4 1/16 to 152 1/8, a peak as
well.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, a senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at the No. 1 maker of personal
computers, Compaq. The Houston-based computer maker said earnings
gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing expectations by 11
cents. Compaq jumped 5 to 83 1/2.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, topping forecasts. Its shares
gained 7/8 to 38.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a share, 2 cents
above analysts' expectations, according to IBES International Inc.
The shares rose 1 1/2 to 123 1/8.
<p>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson jumped 3 7/8 to a record 57 3/8 after gaining
2 1/2 yesterday. The health-care product company said earnings rose
20 percent before trading began yesterday. Its shares have risen 31
percent in the past year.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's fell 1/2 to
38 7/8.
<p>
   Steris Corp. sank 8 3/4 to 29 1/4 after Bill Sanford, the
company's chairman and chief executive, told Dow Jones he expects
the medical device company to earn 38 cents a share in the fiscal
third quarter, below analysts' average expectation of 53 cents,
according to IBES.
<p>
   Norand Corp., a maker of mobile computers, surged 13 5/8 to 33
after Western Atlas Inc. said it would pay $261.3 million, or
$33.50 a share in cash, for all of Norand's 7.8 million shares.
Western Atlas fell 2 to 70 1/8.
<p>
   Gains in stocks were muted as the yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond rose 4 basis points to 6.82 percent. The yield is
used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, so when it rises
it can hurt companies' bottom lines.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
International Business Machines Corp. reported disappointing
earnings, straying from this month's trend of higher-than-forecast
profits, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite
indexes reached records. The dollar surged against major
currencies, while Treasury bonds sank.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 33.87 to 6850.03. The
S&AMP;P 500, representing three-quarters of the value of all U.S.
stocks, rose 3.5 to a record 786.22, while the Nasdaq Composite
Index vaulted 11.07 to 1388.04, both reaching their fifth straight
all-time high.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't think the market's overvalued in the context of
all of the positives,'' he said. ``You have declining interest
rates; corporate America's become more profitable and more
competitive. We're in a hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. and Dean Witter Discover Co. added
surprisingly strong earnings announcements to this week's pile of
profit reports.
<p>
   The dollar jumped to its highest point in almost four years
against the Japanese yen and its highest since June 1994 versus the
German mark, bolstered by U.S. economic strength and expectations
that major nations won't stand in the way of its rise.
<p>
   It reached 1.6445 marks and 119.18 yen, while climbing to a
32-month peak of 1.4358 Swiss francs. It was recently at 1.6415
marks, from 1.6298 marks late yesterday in New York, and at 118.98
yen, up from 117.99 yen.
<p>
   ``The beat goes on for the dollar,'' said James McGroarty, chief
currency manager of Potomac Babson Inc., a money management firm
whose parent, David L. Babson Inc., has $13 billion of assets.
Potomac Babson bought dollars today. ``We think this move has
further to go.''
<p>
   In the past month, the dollar rose 6 percent against the
deutsche mark and 4 percent against the yen.
<p>
   The U.S. currency also got a boost as Russia's parliament
debated whether to demand that President Boris Yeltsin resign
because of his poor health. The State Duma voted to continue
discussing a resolution calling for Yeltsin's departure.
<p>
   Signs of political turmoil in Russia often hurt the mark because
Germany is Russia's largest trading partner and creditor.
<p>
   Treasury bonds fell as Wall Street firms struggled to sell the
$17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought from the Treasury and
prepared for the Treasury's sale of $12.5 billion of five-year
notes tomorrow.
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, little changed prior to the
1 p.m. Eastern time sale, slumped about 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000
bond, pushing its yield up 4 basis points to 6.82 percent.
<p>
   In other markets:
<p>
   -- Gold for delivery in February dropped $2.1 an ounce to
$351.70.
<p>
   -- Crude oil for delivery in March rose 2 cents a barrel to
$24.24 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
<p>
   -- Britain's FT-SE 100 stock index gained 23.6 to a record
4219.1.
<p>
   -- Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged 655.72 to 18,013.88.

 &UR; DREW BARRYMORE FALLS FOR LONE STAR STATE AND A TEXAS ACTOR &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE WESTBROOK &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   McDADE, Texas  &MD;  Drew Barrymore fell in love with Texas. In fact,
she sounds as if she fell in love IN Texas, too  &MD;  and with a Texas
boy.
<p>
   He's Luke Wilson, 25, the handsome star of last year's quirky
``Bottle Rocket,'' which was written by his brother, Owen, and
directed by Wes Anderson.
<p>
   Now the Dallas-born Wilson and Hollywood brat Barrymore are
toiling together in ``Home Fries,'' a comedy being shot in Bastrop,
Coupland and other Austin-area towns.
<p>
   Their characters fall in love  &MD;  and the actors don't seem far
behind.
<p>
   This is their second film together, after shooting
``Independence,'' as yet unreleased, last summer.
<p>
   ``I feel like it's sheer luck,'' Barrymore, 21, said as she
waited to film a scene while sitting in a van on a country road 35
miles east of Austin.
<p>
   ``But obviously it was very fated, because before I'd met Mr.
Wilson, I'd already been assigned to do two movies with him.''
<p>
   Mr. Wilson? That doesn't sound chummy. It turns out discretion
is a newfound virtue for Barrymore, who brandishes it like a child
with a new puppy.
<p>
   That's a big change for a woman who had preteen bouts with drugs
and a monthlong marriage  &MD;  not to mention notoriety for posing in
Playboy and flashing her breasts for David Letterman on ``The Late
Show.''
<p>
   ``Well, I HAVE learned to be discreet,'' Barrymore insisted.
``I've learned it's the best way.
<p>
   ``I'm a very open and honest person. But where I draw the line
is, there are certain times where it's not just me  &MD;  when it
involves someone else.''
<p>
   Fine, but back to ``Mr. Wilson'' ... ``Well, it was so strange
meeting someone and knowing that, like, someone up above or around
the universe had chosen for us to work together,'' she said,
running a hand through the short, curly, red-dyed hair she's
wearing for this shoot.
<p>
   ``It was funny because I was, like, `Who is this person who's SO
in my life and I'm in theirs?' And thank God he's, like, the most
incredible person I have ever met.''
<p>
   Barrymore tends to pepper her talk with absolutes. In Texas, she
has experienced ``the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen.'' But
the most incredible person? ``Well ... no comment,'' she said  &MD; 
then immediately recanted.
<p>
   ``I'll give you some details, but I'll also leave out a few.
I'll make it a puzzle. I think it's important to respect who you're
with and to be discreet, but to remain yourself, too. That goes for
love. Be who you are, but respect that person, too.''
<p>
   As for Mr. Wilson, he's even more discreet, avoiding the subject
while munching lunch in a drafty tent near a horse stall. An
amiable, soft-spoken guy with a quick but natural smile, he grew up
in Dallas, the son of an ad-man dad and a photographer mom. For the
past three years, he's lived in Los Angeles, hustling acting gigs.
<p>
   ``Working with Drew in this and `Independence' is quite a
coincidence,'' he said in his lazy drawl.
<p>
   The Warner Bros. movie is modestly budgeted, though the buzz
around the set is that the bankable Barrymore is getting several
million bucks.
<p>
   Shelley Duvall plays Barrymore's mom in ``Home Fries,'' due in
theaters by fall. It will probably be rated PG-13. ``X-Files''
co-producer Vince Gilligan wrote the screenplay. Directing is Dean
Parisot, who has helmed TV's ``Northern Exposure'' and ``E.R.''
<p>
   (FOLLOWING 5 PARAGRAPHS ARE OPTIONAL.)
<p>
   In ``Home Fries,'' Wilson and Jake Busey (``The Frighteners'')
play brothers whose father has philandered with Sally (Barrymore)
in a small town, leaving her 8 1/2 months pregnant.
<p>
   The boys, who are military nuts, use an Army helicopter to
terrorize their dad and head him back home. But the man has a fatal
heart attack.
<p>
   They then learn that some incriminating radio messages from
their chopper were picked up on the drive-through speaker at a
burger joint where Sally happens to work. Wilson's character gets a
job there to find out how much Sally knows, then falls in love with
her. Mayhem ensues.
<p>
   ``I'm just a nice guy from this nutty family where things go
haywire,'' Wilson said.
<p>
   Barrymore can relate from personal experience.
<p>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
<p>
   Though America came to know Barrymore as the wide-eyed innocent
of ``E.T.  &MD;  The Extra-Terrestrial'' when she was just 6, being the
offspring of the Barrymore acting clan has meant a life in the fast
lanes of Hollywood and New York.
<p>
   ``The people there are extraordinary,'' she said, ``but they
have an attitude that can knock you over. I believe in kindness,
and it's hard to find people who are warm in cities.
<p>
   ``I want to be where people are nice  &MD;  where they value the
power of a smile and how it takes nothing but gives everything.
That's where I want to raise my children.''
<p>
   If anything, kids are more on her mind than boyfriends. Playing
a pregnant woman has put Barrymore in a fiercely maternal state.
<p>
   ``I am very ready for motherhood,'' she said, gently cradling a
rubbery prosthetic beneath her dress.
<p>
   Barrymore raised the dress  &MD;  she wore leggings underneath  &MD;  to
reveal her fake rounded belly.
<p>
   ``It smells like pancake mix  &MD;  like a Bisquick nightmare,'' she
said. ``Go on  &MD;  smell it!'' She settled back into her seat.
<p>
   ``I don't know when it will be,'' she said of motherhood. ``I
choose to wait until the perfect time in the cosmos. I'll probably
be so thrilled, I'll be in a rainbow all day. I'll be playing music
and talking to him or her and trying to stay away from starches.''
<p>
   Barrymore says Texas touches her. She recalls another Texas stay
in 1994, when filming ``Bad Girls,'' a production plagued by
infighting and the firing of a director.
<p>
   ``I didn't have a lover, and I was very alone then,'' she said.
``But one day I walked outside and was covered in butterflies. That
was, like, perfect  &MD;  my first great Texas experience. It was one of
the most incredible days of my life.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   Austin has been a bit more mundane than that West Texas shoot.
During her time off, Barrymore delights in bohemian slovenliness.
<p>
   ``I don't do massage or manny-peddies (manicure-pedicures). I
don't grab a Fendi bag and trot out to my BMW to go catch some
sushi. I put on my boxers, go downstairs, read a book and pick my
toenails.
<p>
   ``I DO clean them. I'm very clean. Don't think just because I

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar jumped to a 47-month
high versus the yen and a 31-month peak against the mark, bolstered
by U.S. economic strength and expectations that leading industrial
nations won't stand in the way of its rise.
<p>
   ``The beat goes on for the dollar,'' said James McGroarty, chief
currency manager of Potomac Babson Inc., a money management firm
whose parent, David L. Babson Inc., manages $13 billion of assets.
Potomac Babson bought dollars at 1.6360 marks today, McGroarty
said. ``We think this move has further to go.''
<p>
   In the past month, the dollar rose 6 percent against the
deutsche mark and 4 percent against the yen.
<p>
   It surged to 1.6445 marks today, its highest since June 15,
1994, and to 119.18 yen, its highest since Feb. 19, 1993. It also
climbed to a 32-month peak of 1.4358 Swiss francs.
<p>
   In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6409 marks,
up from 1.6298 marks late yesterday in New York, and at 118.96 yen,
up from 117.99 yen.
<p>
   The U.S. currency also got a boost as Russia's parliament voted
to discuss a demand for President Boris Yeltsin's resignation
because of his poor health. Signs of political turmoil in Russia
often hurt the mark because Germany is Russia's largest trading
partner and creditor.
<p>
   Expectations that the U.S. economy will keep outpacing its
rivals, luring global investors, is at the root of the dollar's
recent gains, traders said.
<p>
   ``The U.S. economy is strong enough so that the next move in
interest rates will be up, while Germany's economic recovery is
anemic, and Japan's economy continues to weaken,'' McGroarty said.
<p>
   Jeff Berger, director of foreign exchange for AlliedSignal Inc.,
an auto-parts maker based in Morristown, New Jersey, said ``We see
the dollar strong through the first half of the year.''
<p>
   ``The economic situation in Japan will keep the dollar well
supported,'' he said.
<p>
   Nor do traders expect the world's most powerful central banks to
stand in the dollar's way. The Group of Seven leading industrial
nations ``isn't holding the dollar back,'' said McGroarty of
Potomac Babson. The G-7 are the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada.
<p>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said repeatedly during the
past two weeks that a strong dollar is in the national interest,
making clear the U.S. isn't backing away from its support for the
currency.
<p>
   ``The Treasury secretary has been consistent, and Fed governors
have been talking about the benefits of a strong dollar too,''
McGroarty said.
<p>
   To be sure, Ernst Welteke, a Bundesbank council member, said
today that the dollar is unlikely to rise much further. Yet his
remarks had little effect on the dollar, in part because he also
said the German central bank doesn't plan to sell dollars for marks
to stem its ascent.
<p>
   With Germany's economic recovery still sputtering, the
Bundesbank will likely tolerate a weaker mark, which would boost
German exports by making them cheaper in foreign currency terms,
traders said. Germany's economy grew only 1.4 percent last year.
<p>
   ``Germany's economy is going nowhere fast,'' said Richard Koss,
currency strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting
firm. He predicted the Bundesbank will cut interest rates this
quarter to spark the economy. Lower rates would hurt the mark by
making German deposits and bonds less attractive to global
investors.
<p>
   In Japan, while some officials have warned against an
``excessive'' decline by the yen, they haven't clearly stated that
its fallen to far.
<p>
   With Japan's economy stagnant, many traders say officials there
favor a weaker yen to boost exports. The economy grew at only a 0.4
percent annualized rate in the third quarter, and its stock market
has plummeted 7 percent so far this year.
<p>
   By comparison, many analysts forecast the U.S. economy grew at a
3.5 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter -- and stocks
rose to records this week.
<p>
   ``The perception of U.S. economic strength may allow the dollar
to continue higher,'' said Kevin Raphael, manager of foreign
exchange at Rabobank Nederland.
<p>
   He said it could reach 1.68 marks and 120 yen in the next month.
<p>
   Elsewhere, the British pound fell nearly 2 percent against the
dollar after the U.K. reported a 0.8 percent drop in December
retail sales. The news quelled speculation that the government will
raise interest rates soon.
<p>
   Sterling fell to $1.6325 in late New York trading from $1.6644
late yesterday in New York. Earlier, it fell to $1.6297, its lowest
since Dec. 5.
<p>
   The dollar rose to 1.4303 Swiss francs from 1.4196 francs
yesterday and to 5.5390 French francs from 5.4960 francs. It gained
to 1,598.5 Italian lire from 1,582 lire. The Canadian dollar was
unchanged at 74.83 U.S. cents.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Treating newly-infected HIV
patients with a combination of Abbott Laboratories' Norvir and
Glaxo Wellcome Plc's AZT and 3TC appears to stop the reproduction
of HIV within lymphoid tissue and seminal fluid, AIDS researcher
David Ho said today.
<p>
   Ho and his fellow researchers did find some evidence of
``residual particles'' of HIV in the lymphoid tissue of patients
treated with the combination for 10 to 16 months, though he said
there was no evidence the virus was reproducing. Ho and his team
also found that the patients' immune systems were holding up well,
showing no signs of increased viral activity.
<p>
   The finding is important because the lymphoid tissue is one of
the places researchers believe HIV could hide in patients who have
no sign of the virus in their blood using the most sensitive tests.
Still, Ho cautioned that the finding is preliminary and no one
knows for sure if this means a cure for the disease is near.
<p>
   ``Can HIV be eradicated from an infected person? The answer is
clearly we don't know,'' Ho told reporters. ``And if you ask has
HIV been eradicated from any of our patients, the answer is
unequivocally no.''
<p>
   Ho said he now believes that it will take between two and
two-and-a-half years before HIV decays enough in the body to
consider stopping treatment. Originally, he and his team planned to
consider taking patients off treatment after 12 months when the
patients showed no detectable signs of virus in the blood and
lymphoid tissue.
<p>
   ``We're definitely reversing what we had put down on paper
initially,'' Ho said. ``We clearly said this is premature.''
<p>
   The team revised the estimate using results of clinical studies
and a mathematical model, Ho said. He said the team will test more
tissue samples and wait at least two years for any one patient
before considering stopping therapy. Several patients may reach
that point in the next six to eight months, he said.
<p>
   Ho and his team began with 12 newly-infected patients, treating
them with the Norvir/AZT/3TC combination. Seven of those patients
remain in the study after drop-outs due to side effects and failure
to comply with the necessary regimen.
<p>
   Since then, the group has added 11 more newly-infected patients
who are being treated with Merck &AMP; Co.'s Crixivan along with AZT
and 3TC, a regimen that has fewer side effects. Those patients have
only been in the study between four and nine months, though they
too show no signs of HIV in the blood with the most sensitive
tests, Ho said.
<p>
   Ho stressed that there is a long way to go before the virus is
understood and said it's too soon to predict when or if a cure will
be found. The recent news about HIV treatments may have been
over-optimistic.
<p>
   ``The situation is neither black nor white,'' Ho said. ``It is
some shade of gray.''
<p>
   The ongoing studies previewed today by Ho will be presented in
full later this week at the Fourth Conference on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections in Washington.

   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Argentine stocks fell as
investors, encouraged by excess demand at today's government sale
of $2 billion of bonds, sold shares to buy bonds.
<p>
   ``They saw more profit potential in bonds on the back of the
government sale,'' said Maximiliano Goff, an equity markets analyst
at Banco Rio de la Plata.
<p>
   Demand at today's bond sale, the biggest ever by Argentina, was
three times the amount of bonds on offer.
<p>
   The Merval index of the 24 most-traded shares fell 1.09 percent
to 679.09, while the general index slipped 0.8 percent to
19,637.66.
<p>
   Of the 73 issues that were traded, 21 rose, 37 declined and 15
closed unchanged. Volume fell to 17.4 million pesos from 23.6
million pesos yesterday.
<p>
   The biggest loser was oil and gas producer Astra Capsa, down
2.56 percent at 1.9 pesos. Perez Companc SA, another oil and gas
company, fell 2.04 percent to 7.2 pesos.
<p>
   The country's other major oil and gas company, YPF SA, closed
unchanged at 28.1 pesos.
<p>
   Among stocks that are widely traded abroad, telephone company
Telefonica de Argentina SA dropped 1.73 percent to 2.83 pesos.
Telecom Argentina Stet-France Telecom SA, another phone company,
fell 0.66 percent to 4.51 pesos.
<p>
   Rising U.S. interest rates also hurt Argentina stock prices.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose to
6.82 percent from 6.78 percent yesterday as Wall Street firms
struggled to sell $17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought at
today's Treasury auction and prepared for another auction tomorrow.
<p>
   Rising bond yields can draw investors away from emerging
equities markets like Argentina.
<p>
   ``Stocks felt the lack of support from the strong inflow of
foreign funds that has been a feature in recent weeks,'' said Goff.
<p>
   Only three companies included in the Merval index rose.
<p>
   Pulp and paper company Celulosa Argentina SA rose 1.56 percent
to 0.26 pesos, oil and public services company Sociedad Comercial
del Plata SA gained 1.4 percent to 2.7 pesos and IRSA Inversiones y
Representaciones SA, a real estate company in which hedge fund
manager George Soros is a major shareholder, rose 0.93 percent to
3.23 pesos.
<p>
   Among stocks not included in the Merval index, auto parts
company Mirgor Sacifia soared 10 percent to 20.9 pesos after
announcing it had won three contracts to supply vehicle
manufacturers with air conditioning and heating systems.
<p>
   Paint company Colorin Industria de Materiales Sinteticos SA rose
8.33 percent to 1.3 pesos while veterinary drugs company Instituto
Rosenbusch SA also rose 8.33 percent to 0.65 pesos.
<p>
   Farm machinery company Agrometal SA rose 7.87 percent to 1.78
pesos on expectations the company's sales will be boosted by
farmers spending the proceeds of this year's record harvest on new
equipment.

<p>
   Dallas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- To thrive, a so-called concept
restaurant chain like Brinker International Inc. must do two
things: Jazz up its old restaurants and come up with ideas for new
ones.
<p>
   The Dallas-based company has spent the last few years trying to
turn around its 500 Chili Bar &AMP; Grill stores, a hot chain in the
late '80s and early '90s before diners got bored.
<p>
   Yet Brinker may stand a better chance with the new -- in this
case, a takeout store it calls Eatzi's, which caters to upscale
customers whose tastes range from exotic fare to comfort food. The
store is designed to grab business from supermarkets and other
chains like Boston Chicken Inc. and already shows promise: the
year-old prototype in suburban Dallas has monthly sales of $1
million on twice the expected volume.
<p>
   ``I have seen the future and it is Eatzi's,'' said NatWest
Securities Inc. analyst Damon Brundage.
<p>
   It may take nothing less than a vision of the future to bring
Brinker back. Brinker's earnings growth started slowing in 1994.
Then, in 1996, profit plunged 53 percent to $34 million from $73
million as the company took charges to close several Grady's
American Grill and Spageddies Italian Kitchen, two of Brinker's
newer chains. Investors have soured on the company, whose stock has
tumbled from a high of 33 in early 1994 and recently traded at
about 15.
<p>
   ``The history of Brinker is that a lot of its small, promising
restaurant concepts never live up to their potential,'' said Rajan
Chaudhry, editor of Chain Leader, a restaurant trade publication.
``They reach 15 or 20 restaurants and the wheels start coming
off.''
<p>
   Brinker is betting that Eatzi's is different and will ride a
major industry shift: slow growth for sit-down restaurants, while
the takeout business booms.
<p>
   ``We said to ourselves, `boy are we poorly positioned for an up
and coming trend,'' said Brinker Executive Vice President Lane
Cardwell.
<p>
   Much of Brinker's faith in Eatzi's hangs on the man behind the
idea, Phil Romano. Romano and partner and fellow restaurant-design
guru Rich Melman -- credited with creating some of Chicago's
snazziest restaurants -- own 50 percent of Eatzi's. Brinker owns
the rest.
<p>
   Romano is considered something of a genius in the restaurant
industry, best known as the developer of the Fuddruckers chain of
hamburger restaurants that prospered in the 1980s. Fuddruckers
thrived on a novelty: As customers entered, a glass wall revealed
workers grinding meat for burgers.
<p>
   The Fuddruckers fad didn't age well, though, and its results
have dragged down the earnings of parent Daka International Inc.
<p>
   While the Eatzi's experiment has done well, it still has a long
way to go.
<p>
   ``If they had 100 of them it could be a billion dollar
business,'' said Dean Witter analyst David Adelman. ``Or it could
fall on its face.''
<p>
   The key to Eatzi's isn't just the food, which is cooked to order
and ranges from fresh baked bread to gourmet tossed salads to meat
loaf with mashed potatoes or poached salmon with raspberry sauce
for $5 to $8 a meal. More important, perhaps, Eatzi's is about
atmosphere.
<p>
   Food is cooked in the open, refrigerators are stocked during
business hours and chefs pluck their ingredients off the store
shelves rather than from a refrigerator behind a counter. The
bustle gives the farmers-market-style shop the kind of buzz that
draws customers back for more.
<p>
   ``It's a remarkable concept,'' said Eatzi's regular William
Barker. ``We don't have any kids at home and cooking for two is
sometimes a chore. Our friends do the same thing -- they're middle-
to upper-middle class and willing to pay a little more.''
<p>
   Eatzi's customers are a demographer's dream, with household
income of $35,000 to $55,000 a year and more money than time to
spend.
<p>
   ``It's more of a lifestyle thing than an income thing,''
Cardwell said.
<p>
   There is a hitch. Because it appeals to a limited audience --
mostly single, young and prosperous -- Brinker believes Eatzi's
growth potential has its limits. Cardwell said he thinks the U.S.
can support about 100 stores. That's a far cry from the 1,300
stores operated by No. 1 grocery chain Kroger Co.
<p>
   Finding workers may be another problem. The store has 45 chefs,
each paid a minimum of $8 an hour and a job requirement that plenty
of cranky chefs can't cut: They're supposed to chat t~up customers,
describing how the meal is being prepared.
<p>
   Another challenge may be finding management with the skills to
run this meld of grocery store and restaurant.
<p>
   ``The execution is higher than a typical Chili's,'' said Marina
Carlson, a portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management, which
held 922,360 Brinker shares as of September.
<p>
   Yet, she thinks that Brinker can roll out Eatzi's ``pretty
broadly across the nation.'' Already the company is considering
stores in Houston and Chicago.
<p>
   It may just work, especially if Brinker duplicates the ambiance
of a relative's crowded kitchen during a holiday with just one
difference: the cash register at the end.

<p>
   Boston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. gave a
welcome warning last month to a few close friends.
<p>
   One by one, the automaker called analysts at top brokerage firms
on Dec. 18 to say that fourth-quarter costs would be higher than
expected. Word was quickly passed to those firm's big clients,
whose sales of GM stock sent the shares tumbling 1 3/8 on a day
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38 points. Other
investors had to wait until the next day -- when nine analysts cut
fourth-quarter earnings estimates -- to find out what GM said in
private.
<p>
   Almost daily, companies ranging in size from GM and Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Co. to little-known Pioneer-Standard Electronics Inc. and
Vantive Corp. tell certain investors and analysts that bad news is
coming, giving them a chance to bail out before everyone else.
<p>
   ``The game is rigged,'' said Michael Lorberblatt, a New York
artist who owns 126 GM shares. ``I'm getting screwed.''
<p>
   GM says it did nothing wrong and that its phone calls to
analysts didn't give an advantage to anyone. And the automaker saw
no need to issue a news release, a spokesman said, because the
information wasn't important enough.
<p>
   Lorberblatt doesn't buy it. ``Why would they be calling anybody
in the first place?'' he asked. ``They have little sweetheart deals
with big financial institutions.''
<p>
   Investors looking for help when this happens will be
disappointed. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the stock
exchanges have no power to stop what one regulator calls ``uneven
disclosure.''
<p>
   The SEC's main job, for example, is to look for signs that
someone wrongly obtained important information that could affect a
company's stock price and used it to trade. ``The SEC sees its job
as being a cop,'' said Edward Fleischman, a former SEC
commissioner.
<p>
   The stock exchanges, meanwhile, simply push companies to
publicly disclose news in some uniform manner, usually in the form
of press releases or news conferences.
<p>
   In fact, doling out timely news to a few investors and analysts
is perfectly legal, experts say. ``A conference call is the
functional equivalent of a press release,'' said Boris Feldman, a
Palo Alto, California, securities lawyer.

   Uneven disclosure happens so often it passes with little notice,
particularly at smaller companies.
<p>
   Consider software developer Vantive. On Oct. 17, the company
reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded forecasts by 50
percent. The stock closed at 40 3/4, its second-highest ever.
<p>
   The next day, the shares plunged 23 percent, all in the first
hour of trading. That's because the night before -- after the
positive earnings were disseminated to everyone -- Vantive told a
small group of analysts in a conference call that revenue growth
would slow. Those on the call passed on the warning to their
clients, many of whom had their sell orders ready to go when the
market opened.
<p>
   Vantive Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Murphy says she doesn't
understand the stock's plunge because the company only repeated
what it disclosed earlier in securities filings.
<p>
   While U.S. regulators shrug their shoulders at this kind of poor
disclosure, officials in other countries are getting impatient with
it. Some Swedish regulators, for instance, got fed up with this
practice after Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn on Oct. 31 first publicly issued
an uneventful earnings report and then told a small group of
analysts and investors by phone something that was left out of that
report: Wall Street's 1997 profit estimates were 10 cents too high.
On the heels of that call, the drugmaker's shares fell 1 3/4 to 36.
<p>
   The Stockholm Stock Exchange on Dec. 4 said it wouldn't take
action against the company, but Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn promised that
from now on it will include news that could affect the stock in its
press releases.
<p>
   Sometimes, loose lips in a one-on-one conversation starts the
chain of tips that lead to trading advantages for just a few.
<p>
   Take electronics parts distributor Pioneer-Standard. On Sept.
10, the company's stock fell 17 percent in the first half hour of
trading after McDonald &AMP; Co. analyst Robert Damron told the
brokerage's sales force he cut his rating on Pioneer-Standard to
``hold'' from ``aggressive buy'' because of slower sales.
<p>
   Damron, now with Cleary Gull Reiland &AMP; McDevitt, was on target
with his rating cut because he happened to have a great source for
his projection. The day before he put out his bearish report,
Damron learned that the company was going to have a disappointing
quarter in a phone call with Chief Executive James Bayman.
<p>
   That call was a surprise to even Pioneer-Standard's Chief
Financial Officer John Goodger. Minutes after arriving at his
office in the morning, with the market already open, the National
Association of Securities Dealer's surveillance department called
Goodger to ask why the stock was dropping.
<p>
   Goodger checked and found out about the phone call between
Bayman and Damron. More than four hours later, at 1:22 p.m.,
Pioneer publicly announced that fiscal second-quarter sales and
earnings would be less than a year earlier.
<p>
   ``We tried to get that out as soon as possible,'' Goodger said.
<p>
   There is a potential solution to the uneven disclosure problem,
said John Markese, president of the 180,000-member American
Association of Individual Investors: broadcast conference calls
over the Internet. Individuals could listen in, although only
analysts could ask questions, he said.
<p>
   Congress, too, has tried to tackle the problem and in 1995
passed a law giving companies a legal ``safe harbor'' when they
make ``forward-looking statements.''
<p>
   Critics of the bill, though, say it may give well-connected
analysts and investors even more of an edge, as some companies use
the law as a legal shield when discussing forecasts.
<p>
   ``Companies are not as careful about what they say and to
whom,'' said former SEC commissioner Rick Roberts.
<p>
   Federal Reserve statistics show that people are pulling money
out of stocks and shifting cash to mutual funds. While there are
many reasons for selling individual stocks, one might just be that
small investors know companies don't give them the news when they
need it.

   Mexico City, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks fell for a
second day as higher U.S. interest rates fueled concerns that local
rates would follow, hurting corporate earnings, investors said.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasury bond rose 5
basis points to 6.83 percent. Higher U.S. interest rates sometimes
prompt the Mexican central bank to push local rates higher in order
to discourage investors from taking their money out of the country.
<p>
   Still, optimism that higher employment rates will boost consumer
demand in coming months helped Mexican shares recover from a drop
of 28 points in early trading.
<p>
   ``Retail companies are telling us that in December and during
the fourth quarter they registered higher sales,'' said Gerardo
Copca, an analyst at Valores Finamex SA in Mexico city.
<p>
   The Mexican government said Monday that the nation's
unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in December, the lowest level
in two years.
<p>
   The bolsa index fell 9.59 points, or 0.26 percent, to 3707.75.
Shares of financial group Grupo Financiero Serfin SA and hotel
operator Grupo Posadas SA led the declines.
<p>
   At the same time, shares of textile and petrochemical producer
Cydsa SA and bus maker Consorcio G Grupo Dina SA rose today.
<p>
   Cydsa's shares increased 0.98 to 21 pesos after the
Monterrey-based company said yesterday that it plans to invest $36
million in 1997 to upgrade its operations.
<p>
   Dina's shares rose 0.3 to 5.8 pesos on indications that truck
and bus sales may be picking up steam. In December, bus sales
almost tripled, while truck sales rose 91 percent.

<p>
   Philippe Starck, watch your back. American design students
stormed Paris two weeks ago.
<p>
   This year, for the first time, 17 American design students from
four schools exhibited their work at the Paris furniture show, the
Salon du Meuble. And by all accounts they created une sensation.
<p>
   Most walked off with commissions in their pockets or contract
talks with manufacturers under their belts. Several turned down
on-the-spot sales of their models. Fairgoers jumped the ropes to
get a good look at the unexpectedly sleek concepts and
craftsmanship. Though there were some standard design-student takes
on view  &MD;  angry young chairs and a don't-call-me-a-table or two  &MD; 
there were also furniture prototypes that showed prescience about
where homes are headed as the generation born in the late 60's and
the early 70's comes of age as professionals.
<p>
   In a big clue to who's looking forward, Frederic de Bernard, the
fair's North American agent, observed that the American students
were the only group that showed computer desks for home offices
among the 1,000 exhibitors in seven halls.
<p>
   ``As we pulled pieces out of the crates, the French were like,
`Wow, what is that?' '' said David Mocarski, a faculty member from
the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., four of whose
students were exhibiting.
<p>
   Mocarski's students showed a coffee table made of carbon fiber,
a material that originated in the aerospace industry; two
home-office computer desks, and a bar stool called Lenny, based on
an anatomical sketch by Leonardo da Vinci, with a seat that rested
on a spine instead of legs.
<p>
   ``Students are rethinking the home in terms of their own life
style,'' said Richard Prisco, the chairman of the furniture
department at the Savannah (Ga.) College of Art and Design, another
participating school. ``Generation X, the new professionals, just
out of college, changing jobs every couple of years, people who are
on the move. They're addressing furniture to their peers  &MD; 
collapsible, lightweight, high-end design with inexpensive,
recycled materials. These students are making smaller work, not
large things like sofas that would be impossible to move.''
<p>
   The idea of inviting the Americans originated with Beth
Dickstein in New York, a design consultant to manufacturers. Ms.
Dickstein suggested it at last year's Paris fair, which featured a
section of French design students' work. The organizers donated
space for the Americans to exhibit alongside the French students,
and they approached 25 American schools, four of which were finally
invited. The Pasadena and Savannah schools were joined by the Rhode
Island School of Design in Providence and Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn.
<p>
   What no one predicted was that the students, both American and
French, would walk away with the show.
<p>
   ``We had fairgoers tell us that the student portion of the show
was the whole reason for coming, that it was the only place where
something fresh was happening,'' said Patricia Oliver, the
chairwoman of the environmental design department at the Art Center
College of Design.
<p>
   What do students know that professionals don't? In particular,
what can Americans teach the French about design?
<p>
   The students and their teachers agreed that the picture of life
at home is changing in the late 20th century, but that home
furnishings are not  &MD;  or at least not fast enough. Though
television sets are becoming computers that are becoming chat
rooms, for example, armoires continue to hide television sets in
living rooms. But this generation of design students seems
determined to redefine living spaces and to reorganize the rooms of
the average house. America lives on the edge of these life-style
changes: where it leads, the world will follow.
<p>
   ``We're still holding on to the ceremonial home  &MD;  the living
room, the dining room,'' said Peter Benarcik, a master's candidate
in environmental design at the Art Center and the creator of the
Lenny stool. ``Do we need these rooms?''
<p>
   Like many of the students, Benarcik cited the computer and its
integration with home entertainment systems as the key element in
finally forcing the home to change physically. ``You can give it a
face lift  &MD;  the typical Eurodesign approach, when you paint the
appliance out with matte black and put some metal on it  &MD;  or you
can give it a new esthetic so it's no longer this thing against the
wall,'' Benarcik said. ``Maybe instead of working at home on the
dining room table, the computer is the dining room table, and
everything is housed underneath it, and you're fed information the
way you're fed off of a plate.''
<p>
   The biggest cross-cultural shock at the fair was that the
American students were concerned with substance, not style  &MD;  not
reinventing the wheel but building new vehicles.
<p>
   Speaking of the French students' work, Thomas Goldstein, a
recent Pratt graduate, said: ``It was things I've seen before. I
think that's the state of French design  &MD;  it's very beautiful, very
stylish, but maybe a bit conservative.''

<p>
   Bruce Tharp, a recent graduate of the Pratt master's program,
showed a genre-bending item titled Precious Box, a bubinga wood
cube on polished aluminum legs that is a reliquary for the home. It
contained velvet pouches for what Tharp calls ``ordinary
treasures''  &MD;  ticket stubs, love letters, seashells.
<p>
   Tomoko Hayakawa, a master's candidate in industrial design at
Pratt, showed a towering room partition, more totem than screen.
Composed of paper stretched on aluminum frames, it is meant to be
the focus of a room rather than a divider. Each diamond-shaped
opening with its sculptural display is conceived as a window for
contemplation, something that will furnish the room with a unique
meaning for each member of a family. She calls her designs
``something-furniture'' and cites as inspiration a comment by Issey
Miyake, that clothes are ``tools for the wearer's creativity.''
<p>
   Julie Moringello, a graduate student at the Rhode Island School
of Design, showed her Emoticon Screen, a room divider with a
different kind of interface: its blue plastic panels suggest a
computer screen and are decorated with emoticons, faces composed of
keyboard letters and punctuation marks.
<p>
   Some of the American students showed multifunctional furniture,
a design trend that the industry is only beginning to acknowledge.
<p>
   ``The pressures of space are increasing,'' said Ms. Oliver, the
Art Center faculty member. ``Objects need to have storage potential
or the ability to define an open living space so that you can
section yourself off when you're using it from the rest of what's
going on in the room.''
<p>
   New technology was also front and center in the American
students' work. Joseph Perilla, a master's candidate in industrial
design at Pratt and a professional architectural model builder,
showed a plywood chair executed with current model-making
technology. The chair was designed with computer-aided design
software: Perilla's computer disk then guided a tooling machine's
laser in making the exacting decorative cuts in the thin surface of
the chair's plywood veneer.
<p>
   With dreams firmly in place, the American students are also
strongly interested in getting them to market: they may have
learned how in France. Ms. Moringello toured the Ligne Roset
factory near Paris and realized there that her unique designs were
not necessarily commercially improbable.
<p>
   ``European manufacturers can change their tooling; they can do
small runs of things,'' Ms. Moringello said. ``There's still work
that's done by hand, in combination with automatization.''
<p>
   Benarcik, the Art Center student, also admires the European
manufacturing system's ability to respond quickly to new design.
``We exhibited in Atlanta as students  &MD;  we had Herman Miller and
Knoll there, and these guys are talking about tens of thousands of
pieces in their run,'' he said. ``They can't afford to just try
something.''
<p>
   ``Each of us got offers in France,'' he added. ``Now we can say
to companies at home, `Are you willing to do this and match costs?'
''
<p>
   Mocarski said his students and their colleagues at other design
schools were poised for success. ``Manufacturers are looking for
new ideas right now, especially when you're dealing with something
like home offices, multifunctional furniture, markets that are
developing in a creative way,'' he said. ``These students are
stepping into this. So, much of what they do will be what you next
own.''

<p>
   Following are mini-reviews of films newly released on videotape.
The ratings are on a 1-to-5 scale. 
<p>
   ``Manny &AMP; Lo''  &MD;  This is an artsy, disjointed but consistently
interesting comedy/drama about abandoned, adolescent sisters who
become fugitives from an abusive ``juvenile welfare'' system. The
kid actors (Scarlett Johansson and Aleksa Palladino) are very good,
and Mary Kay Place (as a helpful grown-up) is excellent.
Writer-director Lisa Krueger, however, has a difficult time keeping
her ambitious storytelling intentions in sharp perspective. R
(profanity, adult situations and themes). 2 1/2.
<p>
   ``Specimen:'' This by-the-numbers science-fiction thriller has
``Saved by the Bell'' star Mark Paul Goesselaar playing the
offspring of an alien impregnation experiment. It borrows heavily
from pictures like ``The Terminator'' and ``Firestarter,'' but some
decent effects and a professional look overall rescue it from
schlock status. R (profanity, adult situations, nudity,
particularly the behinds of naked alien guys). 3.
<p>
   ``The Pompatus of Love''  &MD;  This engaging romantic comedy should
have played theatrically. Funnier than ``The Brothers McMullen''
and also a little more reality-based, ``Pompatus'' takes its name
from an obscure Steve Miller Band lyric and stars Jon Cryer, Adrian
Pasdar, Tim Guinee and Adam Oliensis as 1990s guys trying to
survive in the world of relationships. R (harsh language, nudity,
sexual activity). 3.
<p>
   ``Absolutely Fabulous: The Last Shout''  &MD;  Just when you thought
it was safe to go shopping again, Patsy and Edina are back and
they're more fabulous than ever. The Brit bad girls return for one
last whirlwind adventure before Edina's daughter Sapphron gets
hitched. The gals travel from the slopes of Switzerland to the
shops on Savile Row. Series regulars Jennifer Saunders and Joanna
Lumley are joined by special guests Marianne Faithfull (as God) and
Christian LaCroix (as himself). PG-13 (rude language, depictions of
drinking and drug use). 4.
<p>
   ``John Carpenter's Escape From L.A.''  &MD;  This witty,
action-filled and essentially serious sequel to the 1982 hit
``Escape From New York'' finds Kurt Russell returning to play
heroic bad guy Snake Plisskin, at large in a hostile, ruined Los
Angeles of the near future. R (violence, harsh language, mature
themes) 3.
<p>
   ``Alaska''  &MD;  This superior wilderness adventure stars Thora
Birch and Vincent Kartheiser as heroic youngsters who run afoul of
a dangerous game-poacher (Charlton Heston). PG (mature themes,
violent action, scattered uncivil language). 3 1/2.
<p>
   ``Broken Arrow''  &MD;  John Travolta is in top form as a deranged
military officer who conspires to steal two nuclear warheads.
Samantha Mathis and Christian Slater are the heroic types who must
halt the menace. John Woo directs. R (violence, harsh language). 3.
<p>
   ``Chungking Express''  &MD;  Asian filmmaker Wong Kar Wei scores with
a bizarre fantasy about drug rip-offs and doomed romance. R (adult
situations, violence, language, drug references). 3.
<p>
   ``D3: The Mighty Ducks''  &MD;  In this third part of the Mighty Duck
series, Emilio Estevez returns as coach of the coolest ice-hockey
team ever, as the Mighty Ducks land in an intimidating new school.
PG (language, slapstick violence, mature themes). 2.
<p>
   ``Eddie''  &MD;  Whoopi Goldberg is better than the material in this
hackneyed tale of an unlikely person chosen to coach a big-time
basketball team. PG-13 (rude humor, language, mature themes). 2
1/2.
<p>
   ``Maybe ... Maybe Not''  &MD;  From Germany, this comedy of sexual
absurdities stars Til Schweiger as an incorrigible womanizer who,
when thrown out by his long-suffering girlfriend, accepts lodging
in the apartment of a gay acquaintance (Joachim Krol). Richly
observed satire, it is in German with English subtitles. R (sexual
activity, language, nudity). 3 1/2.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Panamanian Brady bonds surged
almost 5 percent after Moody's Investors Service and Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp. gave the bonds their highest sub-investment grade
ratings.
<p>
   Other Brady bonds ended the day little changed. The sale of $2
billion 20-year Argentine government bonds failed to lift Argentine
Brady securities. Benchmark floating-rate bonds ended the day 1/8
point lower at 89 5/8 bid and 89 7/8 offered.
<p>
   Slumping U.S. bonds weighed on the Brady market, as securities
firms struggled to sell $17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought
from the Treasury. U.S. 30-year, zero-coupon bonds back many Brady
bonds and account for much of their market value.
<p>
   Rating Panama's creditworthiness for the first time, Moody's
gave Panamanian international bonds ``Ba1,'' the top level for high
risk debt, while Standard &AMP; Poor's assigned Panama's debt a
parallel ``BB+'' rating.
<p>
   The companies cited a ``manageable'' debt burden and the
country's progress toward an open economy. The ratings come a year
after Panama and its creditors restructured defaulted bank debt,
restoring the nation's standing as a potential international
borrower.
<p>
   The ratings led investors to bet the bonds will appreciate, and
sparked a surge of buying, bringing the bonds' yield premium above
comparable U.S. bonds down to 250 basis points, from 296 basis
points last night.
<p>
   That will probably shrink further, to 175 basis points, said
Franklin Chalmers, a portfolio manager at Private Asset Management
in Panama City. ``We expects spreads to tighten, if the government
continues with the privatization program and structural and fiscal
reforms,'' he said.
<p>
   Panamanian interest-reduction Brady bonds rose 3.7 percent or
2.675 points to 75 1/8 bid and 75 5/8 offered. The past-due
interest bonds gained 4.8 percent, closing 4 points higher at 86.5
bid and 87 offered.
<p>
   ``There's still upside,'' said Stuart Parkinson, analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in London.
<p>
   Brady bonds, named after former-U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, were created as part of a debt relief and restructuring plan
for developing countries which defaulted on bank loans.
<p>
   Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Mexico, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bulgaria, Poland, Slovenia,
Jordan, Nigeria and the Philippines have all converted past-due
debts into Brady-type bonds.

<p>
   Sao Paulo, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Sao Paulo state government
signed an accord with Bovespa, the Sao Paulo stock exchange, for
converting the debts of state-owned companies into securities to
help sell the companies to private investors.
<p>
   The state-owned companies will be sold in a four-stage process
coordinated by Companhia Paulista de Administracao de Ativos (CPA),
a company created by the Sao Paulo state government.
<p>
   CPA's main task is to securitize the debts of state companies,
creating a currency that can be used by investors to acquire shares
of the companies at auction.
<p>
   ``Creditors will be switching debts which are often difficult to
collect for debts that are tied to real assets,'' said Sergio Luis
de Cerqueira, special assistant to the president of Bovespa.
<p>
   In the first stage of the securitization process, shares of
state-own companies are transferred to CPA, which then issues
debentures backed by those shares. Next, debts of state-owned
companies to creditors and suppliers are consolidated by the Sao
Paulo state finance secretary and registered at Bovespa.
<p>
   In the third stage, the companies' creditors may purchase the
debentures issued by CPA, up to the amount they're owed, at
auctions held at Bovespa. Finally, the creditors can use the
debentures to purchase shares of the state-owned companies at
auctions, also be conducted at Bovespa.
<p>
   Bovespa and CPA signed an accord today outlining the
responsibilities of each party in the securitization process.
<p>
   In addition to staging the auctions of debentures and
state-owned company shares, Bovespa will be responsible for the
custody of the debentures issued by CPA.
<p>
   Bovespa also will administer a secondary market for the
debentures. Any investor interested in buying shares of a
state-owned company will be able to purchase the debentures.
<p>
   Shares worth 1.8 billion reais of Companhia Paulista de Forca e
Luz, a Sao Paulo utility, and Companhia de Saneamento Basico do
Estado de Sao Paulo, a water and sewage company, already have been
transferred to CPA.
<p>
   The two state-owned companies will be among the first to be put
up for sale at Bovespa.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. said it will provide
local phone service in Connecticut starting in the second week of
February, challenging Southern New England Telephone Co.'s virtual
monopoly in the state.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T also said it will offer local calling in Illinois and
Michigan as well, by the end of March.
<p>
   Connecticut is the third local market that AT&AMP;T is entering,
after Rochester, New York, and Sacramento, California. AT&AMP;T buys
cdtime from local carriers in those markets at a discount and
resells it under its brand name.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance carrier, hopes that
offering local calling will deter its customers from defecting to
competitors. The more services customers can get from a single
phone company, the less likely they are to switch, analysts say.
<p>
   ``We will be offering local and long-distance on one bill,''
said John Heath, a spokesman for New York-based AT&AMP;T. ``Customers
can pay with one check.''
<p>
   AT&AMP;T shares fell 1/2 to 38 7/8, while Southern New England
Telephone shares fell 3/4 to 37.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said it initially will offer service to a small number of
customers Connecticut, as it tests billing and customer-service
operations, then expand statewide.
<p>
   Southern New England Telephone said AT&AMP;T is one of 17 companies
that have received Connecticut regulators' approval to offer local
service.
<p>
   ``Our aim is to continue to be the hometown phone company of
choice for Connecticut customers,'' said Ron Serrano, president of
SNET's communications, information and entertainment group.
<p>
   In Connecticut, AT&AMP;T gets a 25 percent discount for residential
telephone calls from Southern New England Telephone, and a 40
percent discount for business calls.
<p>
   In California, where it plans to expand statewide, AT&AMP;T gets
discounts of 17 percent for both business and residential calls.
Discounts are determined through state government regulators under
a new federal law that opens up local telephone markets.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T jumped into the local phone market in Rochester in January
1995. Several months later it stopped marketing the service, saying
it couldn't make a profit from the 5 percent discount it received
from Frontier Corp.'s Rochester Telephone unit.

   Andree Putman, the French interior designer, is leaving Ecart
International, the company she founded in 1978 to reissue classics
of early 20th-century furniture design, said Michel Taurel,
development manager of Ecopar, the parent company of Ecart, which
is in Paris.
<p>
   ``It's an agreement between her and Ecopar,'' Taurel said by
telephone from Paris, ``because, you know, she is 70-and-something
old, and she is actually retiring from her activities at Ecart.''
<p>
   In New York, Ralph Pucci, whose company, Pucci International,
represents Ecart International in the United States, said, ``I
think she has gone off to explore other avenues.'' At Mrs. Putman's
office in Paris Wednesday, an assistant said she was out for the
evening and not reachable.
<p>
   During her reign as artistic director of Ecart, Mrs. Putman
produced an intensely personal collection of reproduction
furniture, nearly all of it elegant, timeless and overlooked in its
own era.
<p>
   She is widely credited with being one of the first to revive the
Art Deco style. She rediscovered and reproduced the sleek,
modernistic furniture designs of the architect Eileen Gray and
reissued a 1903 lamp by Mariano Fortuny, more famous for his
pleated fabrics, that she had seen at the Fortuny Museum in Venice.
<p>
   In Spain, she negotiated the rights to the voluptuous furniture
designs by Antonio Gaudi, the Spanish architect. In Manhattan, she
designed the interior of Morgans Hotel on Madison Avenue and
oversaw its lobby renovation last year.
<p>
   Ecart will continue to reissue designs and produce furniture
designed by Christophe Pillet, Taurel said, and will expand into
large-scale projects like the Deutsche Bank headquarters in
Berlin.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists
gathered in Washington Wednesday, marching to the Supreme Court to
mark the anniversary of its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision,
which made abortion legal.
<p>
   ``Our purpose today is to tell official Washington that they
must understand the humanity of each pre-born child at
fertilization,'' said Nellie J. Gray, president of the March for
Life Education and Defense Fund, which organized the annual event.
<p>
   Before their march to the high court, protesters rallied on a
muddy lawn between the White House and the Washington Monument.
Gray told them that 24 years after the Roe v. Wade decision,
``pro-life America is here to stay.''
<p>
   Tensions were high earlier in the day when police thought a
small explosion in downtown Washington had been directed at a
nearby Planned Parenthood clinic. Law enforcement officials said
later they did not believe the incident was linked to the clinic.
<p>
   Ann M. Adams of Burke, Va., who attended the rally with her
daughter and twin 2-1/2-year-old grandsons, said she was relieved
to learn that anti-abortion activists were not involved in the
explosion.
<p>
   Anti-abortion protests should be peaceful and legal, she said,
because, ``It's a violent thing that we're trying to combat.''
<p>
   A bombing at an Atlanta abortion clinic last Thursday that
injured six has drawn new attention to violence against abortion
providers.
<p>
   Vice President Al Gore, speaking Wednesday at a luncheon
sponsored by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, said the country would not tolerate those who carry out
such attacks.
<p>
   ``We will punish you to the full extent of the law,'' Gore said.
``We will not let you terrorize America's women or their doctors.
We will not let you deface our Constitution.''
<p>
   Speaking at the anti-abortion rally, Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo.,
disagreed with Gore's view of abortion rights, but agreed that
violence at clinics should not be tolerated. ``Just as we must
continue to pray for an end to violence outside those clinics, let
us continue to pray for an end to violence inside those clinics,''
he said.
<p>
   Vincent A. Ciappetta, a police officer from Cutchogue, N.Y.,
came to the rally with about 35 members of his Knights of Columbus
chapter.
<p>
   ``We have to make a statement for life,'' said Ciappetta, who
has started a group of anti-abortion law enforcement officials
called Cops for Life.
<p>
   Recalling that he attended a similar rally last year, Ciappetta
said, ``It's frustrating that things haven't changed, but things
will change.''
<p>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, drew loud cheers when he told the
crowd that Congress would again approve a ban on so-called
``partial-birth'' abortions, a controversial type of late-term
abortion.
<p>
   Congress approved the ban last year, but President Clinton
vetoed the measure because it did not make exceptions in cases
where a mother's life was in danger.
<p>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi included the
measure Tuesday when he unveiled his list of top 10 legislative
goals, calling Clinton's veto of the ban ``a shameless act that we
must deal with.
<p>
   ``We are determined to do this, and we will do it earlier rather
than later in this first session,'' Lott said.
<p>
   DeWine said if lawmakers and anti-abortion activists ``do a good
enough job explaining to the American people what partial-birth
abortion really is ... public opinion will sweep this country and
even Bill Clinton will have to say `Yes, I will sign it.'''
<p>
   Eileen M. Salisbury, a 14-year-old from Shepherd, Mich.,
attended Clinton's second inaugural Monday, which she called ``a
really good experience, historically.''
<p>
   But she said she was more comfortable at Wednesday's event,
where she held a wood post supporting a banner that read,
``Michigan Loves Life. Protect the Unborn.''
<p>
   ``We know these people are fighting for our cause,'' Salisbury
said.

 &UR; SENATE HOPES TO AVOID PARTISANSHIP IN HEARINGS ON DNC FUND-RAISING
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
    &UR; For release Saturday, Jan. 25.
<p>
    &UR; By KEN FOSKETT &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  With House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethics saga now
over, Senate leaders are preparing public hearings into Democratic
fund-raising practices that could eclipse the intense publicity
surrounding the speaker's case.
<p>
   Hearings themselves are still a month or more away, but Senate
Republicans and Democrats have already begun jostling to define the
scope of the inquiry and set the tone for the politically charged
proceedings.
<p>
   Republicans are eager to keep them narrowly focused on how the
Democratic National Committee collected millions of dollars in
potentially illegal contributions from foreign interests, much of
it under the direction of former Commerce Department official and
DNC fund-raiser John Huang.
<p>
   Republican leaders are keen to know if the White House may have
provided any special favors in return for the donations, about $1.5
million of which the DNC has voluntarily returned.
<p>
   Democratic leaders want to keep the scope of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee hearings as broad as possible,
exhuming examples of improper donations among Republican
contributors as well.
<p>
   In letters made public Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., urged the committee chairman, Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., to examine reports that top Republicans recently told
Business Roundtable members, composed of leading corporate
executives, to stop giving to Democrats or be denied access to
Republican congressional leaders.
<p>
   ``This ... provides compelling testimony for reform of a system
in which money appears to buy influence and access,'' Daschle
wrote.
<p>
   Both parties say they are anxious to avoid the intensely
partisan tone that dominated the Senate Banking Committee hearings
in the previous Congress into the Clintons' Whitewater dealings.
<p>
   The Senate fund-raising hearings will be scripted by Thompson,
the minority counsel for the Watergate hearings 20 years ago and a
politician often touted as a potential presidential candidate in
2000.
<p>
   Thompson has hired a half-dozen new committee staff members to
begin interviewing witnesses, collecting documents and issuing
subpoenas.
<p>
   He pledged Wednesday that the hearings would be ``balanced'' and
``broad in scope,'' but he made no promises that Democrats would be
given equal time to take the hearings in a direction of their
choosing.
<p>
   ``If you've got a problem area it ought to be looked at
regardless of which party,'' Thompson said. ``But there's no
affirmative action that will be applied in terms of percentages.''
<p>
   Paul Clark, Thompson's spokesman on the committee, said the
senator doesn't plan ``an aggressive, partisan investigation.''
<p>
   But such a feat in a town that thrives on scandal and in a
Congress riven with partisan divisions will require ``an almost
superhuman'' effort from Thompson, says Larry Makinson, deputy
director at the Center For Responsive Politics, a non-partisan
advocacy group for campaign finance reform.
<p>
   ``If this were truly a disinterested, bipartisan look, the
Republicans would begin to get slathered with a little bit of mud
themselves,'' says Makinson. ``No one is blameless in this
situation of fund-raising.
<p>
   ``The potential for embarrassment for both the Republican and
Democratic Party right now is sky-high. The temptation for people
on both sides to take off is probably going to be irresistible, so
I don't think it's going to sound like something put on by the
League of Women Voters, that's for sure.''
<p>
   Hearings that degenerate into ``partisan conflict'' will quickly
lose credibility among voters, said Whit Ayres, a Republican
pollster in Atlanta.
<p>
   ``Congressional hearings into the actions of a president from
the other party ... not only have to be fair, they have to be
perceived as fair,'' says Ayres. ``The demeanor and decisions and
tone of the chair are critically important.''
<p>
   One way Republicans are seeking to minimize the chances that the
hearings will backfire is to follow what Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., described in a recent news conference as a
``two-track'' approach.
<p>
   While Thompson's committee gathers evidence and lines up
witnesses out of the spotlight, Senate Republican leaders will be
pushing their legislative agenda on the Senate floor, Lott said.
<p>
   ``We have responsibilities that we have to face on behalf of the
people that elected us, and we're going to do that,'' Lott said.
<p>
   Republican leaders say they also plan to avoid long, drawn-out
hearings similar to the Whitewater hearings conducted by Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., which ended with no clear result and left
the impression that the sole purpose was to embarrass the
president.
<p>
   While there is still no timetable set for when the hearings will
begin or how long they will last, ``Thompson does not plan to have
this thing stretch out for the duration of the 105th Congress,''
Clark said. ``It's not going to happen.''
<p>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are preparing to ensure that whatever
unsavory details emerge from the hearings, they include Republican
wrongdoing as well.
<p>
   Daschle and other Democrats frequently cite the case of Simon
Fireman, a Boston businessman who paid a $6 million fine last year
for illegally channeling contributions to Bob Dole's failed
presidential campaign through a Hong Kong bank.
<p>
   ``I certainly hope that in the spirit with which you have heard
so many of us discuss these matters over the past several weeks
that Sen. Thompson will not limit the scope simply to Democratic
activities,'' Daschle said Wednesday. ``I expect Senator Thompson
to be much more fair-minded, much more open to other issues.''

<p>
   Marlboro, Massachusetts, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Stratus Computer
Inc. said fourth-quarter profit jumped 26 percent on lower costs
and rising revenue, and that Chairman and founder Bill Foster plans
to step aside as chief executive.
<p>
   Net income rose to $17.7 million, or 74 cents a share, from
$14.1 million, or 60 cents, in the year-earlier period. Earnings
exceeded forecasts of 63 cents a share, the average estimate of 10
analysts polled by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   The earnings gain is a reassurance that Stratus is back on track
after two quarters of stalled revenue growth, investors said. The
company makes breakdown-resistant computers for banks and other
companies that need systems that don't crash.
<p>
   ``Those are a signs of acceleration, and acceptance in the
marketplace,'' said Alan Tingey, a money manager at Smoot, Miller,
Cheney &AMP; Co., a Salt Late City-based firm that owned almost 25,000
Stratus shares at the end of September.
<p>
   Stratus shares rose 2 1/8 to close at 31 7/8 with 452,300
changing hands, almost five times the three month daily average.
The shares are near the 52-week high of 32 1/8 reached June 12.
Revenue for the Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company rose 4.6
percent to $176.1 million from $168.4 million, after two quarters
in which revenue growth was unchanged from year-earlier levels.
<p>
   Results were improved by lower expenses for research and
development, compensation and other administrative functions. Those
expenses fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter to $57.3 million
from $64.5 million.
<p>
   Expenses relating to cutting back its sales operations in
certain markets reduced fourth-quarter earnings by 10 cents a
share, the company said. Stratus chose to pay for the cutback out
of expenses instead of taking a separate charge, said spokesman
Peter Christiana.
<p>
   The fourth-quarter results don't put to rest concern about the
company, Tingey said. ``I don't think the future of Stratus is
without its clouds,'' he said. ``The premium people are willing to
pay for (continuously available computers) has contracted over
time.''
<p>
   That will put pressure on profits if revenue growth doesn't keep
pace, Tingey said.
<p>
   In August, Stratus announced that Foster would resume the duties
of CEO after Gary Haroian resigned. Foster said at the time that he
and Haroian had a difference of opinion about the company's
direction.
<p>
   Now, Foster plans to step aside and hire a new CEO by the end of
the year. Foster said in a statement that after almost 17 years
running Stratus, ``the timing is good for a new CEO.''
<p>
   Foster's announcement of a CEO search isn't troublesome because
he will stay on as chairman, money manager Tingey said.
<p>
   For the year, Stratus said profit from operations rose to $47.1
million, or $1.98 a share, from 1995's profit from operations of
$36.8 million, or $1.55.
<p>
   Net income in 1996 more than doubled to $43.5 million, or $1.83
a share, including a pretax $4.6 million charge in the second
quarter for restructuring its software business.
<p>
   In 1995, Stratus had net income of $17.3 million, or 73 cents,
including a pretax $24.5 million charge for cutting cuts and
consolidating facilities.
<p>
   Sales rose 3.6 percent last year to $609.3 million from $587.9
million.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Consumer food prices in 1997
will hold steady or even retreat after surging last year at their
highest rate since 1990, analysts said.
<p>
   That could remove one of the inflation concerns that has been
troubling policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ``A slowing of the
increase in food prices'' this year could help offset a likely
increase in the underlying rate of inflation, Fed Gov. Laurence H.
Meyer said today in a speech to the Charlotte, North Carolina,
Economics Club.
<p>
   Grain prices have retreated from a surge last year that pushed
up retail prices for bread, milk, pork and other foods. With 1996
harvests refilling grain bins, there is enough corn, wheat and
soybeans to satisfy the strong worldwide demand that fed last
year's price increases.
<p>
   Moderate food price inflation is likely because the new farm
bill, ending 60 years of government controls on how much farmers
plant, increases the chances that the bumper 1996 harvest will be
repeated this year. ``We think the edge is off food price
inflation,'' said Vincent J. Malanga, who manages a $175 million
commodity fund as president of LaSalle Economics Inc., New York. He
figures food prices will climb 3 percent in 1997, after rising 3.3
percent in 1996.
<p>
   Bigger crops would help drive food prices lower, compared with
1996, on such consumer staples as milk, bread, cereals and chicken.
Pork and beef prices could rise from a year earlier on smaller
supplies. Food processors such as CPC International Inc., makers of
Mazola corn oil, could get a lift in profits as corn refining costs
ease.
<p>
   Of course, bad weather or rising energy or labor costs could
still force food prices higher in 1997. For now, though, analysts
see the chances improving for steady food prices.
<p>
   Officially, retail food prices are forecast to increase between
3 percent and 3.5 percent in 1997, according to the U.S.
Agriculture Department. That compares with a 3.3 percent increase
for all of 1996, calculated on a January-to-December basis.
<p>
   Last year's grain-price surge, the biggest since the early
1970s, caused U.S. food prices to exceed the overall inflation rate
for the first time since 1990. The cost of food makes up 16 percent
of the CPI. Not counting food and energy, the so-called core rate
of inflation last year was at 2.6 percent, tying the 1994 rate as
the lowest in three decades.
<p>
   ``We're not projecting any major price increases for 1997,''
said Annette Clauson, the USDA's food-inflation analyst, whose
projections are fed to the Federal Reserve Board before each
meeting on interest-rate policy.
<p>
   One big contributor to the benign food-price outlook is the new
farm bill, passed in April 1996, which makes 1997 the first year
since the Depression that farmers are free to plant any crop they
choose.
<p>
   ``It significantly changes programs in ways that will give
farmers more flexibility to respond to market conditions, and on
more acres,'' Malanga said.
<p>
   Grain prices soared in 1996 because of record numbers of
livestock at home and a boom in exports, triggered in part by
growing wealth in Asian economies and a corresponding demand for
improved diets of meat, milk and other staples.
<p>
   Now, farmers, lured by the high prices of 1996, are likely to
plant fence-to-fence this spring, resulting in greater supplies of
wheat, corn, and soybeans, says food and agribusiness consultant
John Urbanchuk. Traders in commodity markets have pushed corn
prices down 25 percent from a year ago, to about $2.74 a bushel.
<p>
   Larger supplies at lower prices will help moderate the price
outlook for everything from breads, cereals and bakery goods to
meat, milk and eggs. For example, milk prices, which rose 7 percent
in 1996, are forecast to rise a more moderate 2 percent to 2.5
percent increase this year, according to USDA. Poultry producers,
who can increase production by hatching more chicks faster than
beef producers can breed new calves, are forecast to boost turkey
and broiler production by 5 percent to take advantage of cheaper
feed.
<p>
   ``You're looking at relatively benign food-price inflation in
1997,'' said Urbanchuk, of AUS Consultants, Moorestown, New Jersey.
He figures food prices in 1997 will rise 2.5 percent to 3.0
percent. Beef prices could rise 1 to 2 percent in 1997, after
posting a 1.6 percent price decline in 1996. Prices fell last year
because ranchers, facing high feed costs, sold off herds and
created an artificial beef glut. Now, with grain prices weaker,
farmers are likely to concentrate on rebuilding herds, and beef
won't be as plentiful in the supermarket.
<p>
   ``When you rebuild the herd, this reduces supplies for
slaughter,'' said Donald Ratacjzak, head of the economic
forecasting center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
<p>
   Of course, all bets are off if bad weather dogs farmers during
the spring planting season, or if drought, floods or an early frost
slash harvests this fall.
<p>
   USDA's food-price forecasts, and those of private economists,
are based on assumptions of ``normal'' weather. It wouldn't take
much of a swing in weather conditions ``to gyrate those food
prices,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.

 &UR; U.S. ECONOMY: '96 HOUSING STARTS STRONGEST IN 8 YEARS (UPDATE2) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Home construction in the U.S.
enjoyed a banner year in 1996, posting the strongest gain in eight
years, while the overall economy was running at a healthy pace as
the new year dawned, new reports showed today.
<p>
   Starts of new houses last year rose 8.8 percent to 1.474
million, the highest level since 1988, the Commerce Department
said. The increase was fueled by a dip in 30-year fixed mortgage
interest rates below 7 percent early in the year and a pickup in
economic activity in the fourth quarter.
<p>
   ``We have relatively stable interest rates, and the highest
housing affordability in a long time,'' said Joel Rassman, chief
financial officer for Toll Brothers Inc., a Huntington Valley,
Pennsylvania, company that builds houses in 13 Eastern states.
Still, snow, floods and mudslides in the West depressed housing
construction in December.
<p>
   As 1997 begins, the housing market -- and the overall economy --
seem poised to remain vigorous, even if housing construction
doesn't match last year's pace. ``Economic growth in December and
early January was moderate in most parts of the country,''
according to a regional economic survey released today by the
Federal Reserve.
<p>
   Though the Fed, always on guard for inflation, found ``scattered
evidence'' of pressure building for higher wages, the central bank
still found no evidence of accelerating consumer prices except for
energy costs.
<p>
   Analysts and investors viewed the reports as further signs the
Fed can leave interest rates unchanged at the next meeting of the
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee Feb. 4-5.
<p>
   The Fed report is likely to be ``comforting'' for investors,
said James Padinha, an economist at MMS International in San
Francisco, because it doesn't point to wage pressures or other
worrisome signs of inflation.
<p>
   In financial markets, though, the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond slumped after the government's auction of about $17 billion in
two-year notes. The bond fell 1/2 point in late New York trading,
pushing up the yield more than 4 basis points to 6.82 percent.
<p>
   Stocks, meantime, were mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 33.87 points on weak earnings reports to close at 6850.03. The
Nasdaq Composite Index, though, rose 11 points to close at a record
1388.04. The dollar, meantime, was higher against other major
currencies.
<p>
   Builders and analysts said the unexpectedly large 12.2 percent
decline in December starts, following a revised 9.3 percent
increase in November, doesn't mean the bottom has fallen out of the
housing market.
<p>
   High levels of consumer confidence and job creation, plus rising
incomes and still-low mortgage rates, lead builders to expect a
strong year, though few expect this year's level of starts to top
1996.
<p>
   ``I'm rather optimistic about 1997 now that it's arrived --much
more optimistic than I was six or seven months ago,'' said Robert
Strudler, chief executive officer of U.S. Home Corp. in Houston.
Added Leonard Miller, chairman of Miami-based Lennar Corp.: ``You
see no major buildup of inventories in the industry.''
<p>
   In December, alone, all regions of the country reported a drop
in new starts as the monthly rate fell to 1.329 million, adjusted
for seasonal variations -- the lowest since June 1995, according to
the Commerce Department. The flood-ravaged West was especially hard
hit. Analysts had expected a 2.8 percent decline for December
instead of the 12.2 percent drop reported.
<p>
   Meanwhile, permits for new housing construction fell 0.6 percent
nationwide in December to an annual rate of 1.410 million, rate
after increasing 4.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department
said.
<p>
   By category, single-family housing construction dropped 11.8
percent during December while multi-family projects declined 13.6
percent from a month earlier.
<p>
   By region last month, housing starts plunged 29.2 percent in the
West to a rate of 257,000; dropped 7.9 percent in the Midwest to
302,000; fell 7.2 percent in the South to 645,000; and declined 2.3
percent in the Northeast to 125,000.
<p>
   Though bad weather played a role in December's showing, that's
not entirely unexpected since home building usually ``winds down in
the winter months'' said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. ``We're going to see a
pickup in housing starts when the weather clears,'' said Carl
Palash, chief economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
<p>
   And with mortgage rates still at historically low levels, starts
``should be relatively robust'' in 1997, perhaps reaching a total
of 1.38 million, Brown said.
<p>
   At Dallas-based Centex Corp., one of the nation's largest home
builders and mortgage originators, spokeswoman Sheila Gallagher
said by the end of the company's fiscal year in March, Centex will
have built and delivered about 12,500 new homes, but that the total
will likely drop to 12,000 for the fiscal year ending March 1998.
<p>
   After marching higher over several months, the average rate on a
30-year fixed loan fell to 7.60 percent in December from 7.62
percent in November, according to Bloomberg analytics.
<p>
   That put the average principal and interest payment on a
$100,000 loan at $706.07 last month, down from $707.45 a month
before. Those figures don't include tax, fire insurance or escrow
costs.
<p>
   In the most recent week, the average 30-year mortgage rate rose
2 basis points to 7.87 percent.
<p>
   The next move in home construction -- and sales -- will be
plainly evident when the weather turns milder in a few months.
<p>
   ``The real question is when does the consumer decide that the
time (to buy) is now,'' said Ira Norris, president of INCO Homes in
Upland, California. `I think people need to believe that housing
prices are on the rise before they buy, and right now the urgency
is not there.''

<p>
   Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Republic
Industries Inc. said it acquired Carlisle Motors in Florida for $35
million in stock, the latest in a flurry of car dealership
acquisitions by billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga's holding company.
<p>
   Carlisle operates three new and used automobile dealerships,
including the nation's fourth-largest Lincoln-Mercury dealer. Based
in St. Petersburg, Florida, Carlisle owns Lincoln-Mercury, Ford and
Hyundai dealerships in St. Petersburg and Clearwater, Florida.
<p>
   For Republic, Carlisle is the 15th such acquisition announced
since last summer, part of the company's aggressive plan to
complement and support its fledgling chain of haggle-free,
high-service dealerships, AutoNation USA.
<p>
   Republic has also agreed to buy two of the nation's five biggest
car rental agencies -- National Car rental System and Alamo
Rent-A-Car -- for a total of $3 billion in stock and debt.
<p>
   More acquisitions are certain, the company said.
<p>
   ``Our new association with Republic and AutoNation USA provides
us with opportunities to expand our business in the new and used
car marketplace,'' said Scott Wilkerson, president of Carlisle, who
will head Republic's efforts to grow in the Tampa Bay area.
<p>
   Shares of Republic closed at 41 1/8, up 1, a record high. The
stock has more than tripled since February.
<p>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. today rated Republic stock ``accumulate''
for the near-term and ``buy'' for the long-term. Analysts forecast
the stock to increase to a range between 43 and 47 a share in the
next 12 months.
<p>
   Republic has opened seven AutoNation superstores in Florida,
Arizona, Michigan, Texas and California, and plans to have 90 by
2000.
<p>
   New car dealers provide AutoNation with yet another source of
vehicles through trade-ins, the company said, adding that it
further rounds out the company's ambitious plan to grab a slice of
the giant automobile business.
<p>
   Republic is Huizenga's latest venture. He twice made himself a
billionaire, co-founding Waste Management Inc., now called WMX
Technologies Inc., and later founding Blockbuster Entertainment
Corp., which is now a unit of Viacom Inc.

 &UR; COMERICA TO CUT 14% OF JOBS, CLOSE BRANCHES (UPDATE2) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Detroit, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Comerica Inc. said it will cut
1,890 jobs, or 14 percent of its workforce, and close branches to
cut costs, boost profits and avoid a potential takeover.
<p>
   The Detroit-based bank took a $90 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for the job cuts and other
restructuring moves. Comerica doesn't know how exactly how many
people will be fired, said bank spokesman Wayne Mielke.
<p>
   The bank said it's taking other measures to boost revenue by
$110 million a year. It's part of a strategy to convince investors
that the bank -- often cited by analysts as a likely takeover
target -- should remain independent.
<p>
   If Comerica doesn't cut costs, ``someone else will (cut) them
for us,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Eugene Miller. ``And I
mean being taken over.''
<p>
   Comerica joins Keycorp, First of America Corp. and Signet
Banking Corp. among banks that are restructuring under pressure
from investors to boost profits by cutting costs. The moves makes
the bank less attractive to acquirers, analysts said, because
there's less waste to trim.
<p>
   ``Sounds like they heard footsteps,'' said James Schmidt, a
portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds, which owns 552,800 shares.
<p>
   The bank plans to cut jobs across all its businesses, as it
implements 1,800 suggestions culled from employees since September
on how to save money and operate more efficiently. Changes range
from reducing the number of people needed to approve a loan, to
saving $1 million a year by using fewer kinds of envelopes.
<p>
   The bank was advised by Chandrika Tandon's New York-based
consulting firm Tandon Capital Associates, which built a reputation
for slashing payrolls at other banks.
<p>
   Fleet Financial Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Michigan National
Bank, and Midlantic Bancorp all hired Tandon to devise ways to
boost profits at least in part by firing workers.
<p>
   Tandon organized four months of meetings, getting suggestions on
how to save money from 5,000 Comerica employees, ranging from
tellers to Miller. The bank's senior executives then decided which
ideas to implement.
<p>
   Miller said it wasn't difficult convincing his employees to come
up with ideas that may cost them their job in the end. ``We tried
to explain the rationale, that if we're going to grow the company
we have to do these things.''
<p>
   Comerica announced the steps as it reported fourth-quarter
profit from operations rose 14 percent to $121 million, or $1.06 a
share -- a penny shy of Wall Street expectations.
<p>
   Comerica shares were unchanged at 56 1/4 in trading of 452,000
shares, not quite twice its daily average volume.
<p>
   In its earnings report, Comerica said net interest income rose
3.6 percent to $353.3 million as loans outstanding increased 4.7
percent to an average of $25.5 billion in the quarter. The net
interest margin widened to 4.61 percent from 4.31 percent.
<p>
   Overall credit quality improved, as the bank reduced by 3
percent to $32 million the amount it set aside for future loan
losses while net write-offs fell 38 percent to $22.3 million.
<p>
   Total noninterest income fell 5.8 percent to $132.4 million,
amid declines in broker fees and revolving credit fees.
<p>
   Noninterest expense rose 24 percent to $356.2 million. Excluding
the restructuring charge, expenses fell 7.7 percent.
<p>
   For full year 1996, net income rose 0.9 percent to $417.2
million, or $3.55 a share, from $413.4 million, or $3.54, in 1995.
Comerica, which has $34 billion in assets, operates about 365
branches in Michigan, California, Texas and Florida.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds fell as Wall Street
firms struggled to sell the $17.5 billion of two-year notes they
bought from the Treasury and prepared for another auction tomorrow.
<p>
   The Treasury sold its notes at a yield of 5.984 percent, less
than the 6 percent yield traders anticipated just before the sale.
The issue recently yielded 6.01 percent.
<p>
   The lower-than-expected yield at the sale ``doesn't mean the
auction went well,'' because securities firms can't sell the bonds
for as much as they paid the government for them, said Mark
Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities Inc. Making the sale more
difficult is the Treasury's sale of $12.5 billion of five-year
notes tomorrow.
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, little changed prior to the
1 p.m. Eastern time sale, slumped 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 bond,
pushing its yield up 3 basis points to 6.81 percent.
<p>
   Securities firms had an easier time finding buyers for the $2
billion of 20-year global bonds Argentina sold today, as investors
hungry for higher yields snapped up the securities.
<p>
   The country sold the bonds at a yield of 11.375 percent, or
462.5 basis points more than U.S. government debt. That's better
than the 500 basis point difference underwriters expected less than
a week ago. Global bonds are sold simultaneously around the world
and trade 24-hours a day.
<p>
   Bond investors, faced with low yields and high prices in many
other parts of the world, ``have got to buy high-yield and emerging
markets debt,'' said Carl Ericson, head of $6 billion in taxable
fixed income at Colonial Advisory Services in Boston. Argentina has
``to make hay while the sun shines.''
<p>
   Investors looked past government reports showing a drop in new
home starts and moderate economic growth as they fretted about
demand for all the new Treasury debt.
<p>
   With all the supply, ``people have got a pretty bearish
viewpoint right now,'' said David Hoffman, who manages $300 million
in bonds at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Delaware.
<p>
   Wall Street firms often push yields higher before the Treasury
sells debt to try to stir up demand from investors.
<p>
   ``The reaction to the two-year is burdened by the prospect of
more supply coming in the pipeline,'' said Tony Crescenzi, a trader
at Miller Tabak Hirsch &AMP; Co. ``Even with good results, the market
is not trading well off them,'' he said.
<p>
   Traders said comments from Federal Reserve Governor Susan
Phillips in a Market News interview also weighed on bonds earlier
in the day. Phillips suggested that the Fed might not wait for a
rise in the core consumer price index before boosting rates.
<p>
   ``Phillips' comments were extremely bearish. They lend support
to the believers who think that the Fed will still have to
tighten,'' or raise rates, said Todd Speiser, a trader at Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The Fed hasn't changed bank lending rates since January 1996,
when it cut the so-called federal funds target by a quarter of a
percentage point to 5.25 percent. The Fed's policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee next meets on Feb. 4-5.
<p>
   Earlier, bonds got a brief fillip after the government reported
a bigger-than-expected drop in December housing starts.
<p>
   The Commerce Department said housing starts fell by 12.2 percent
in December, after climbing a revised 9.3 percent the month before.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News on average expected a decline
of 2.8 percent.
<p>
   Today's housing number adds to a body of evidence suggesting the
economy is growing with little inflation.
<p>
   ``By and large the numbers tell me the economy is not going
gangbusters and not falling off a cliff and that's what (Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan) said in his testimony,'' to the Senate
Budget Committee yesterday, said Robert Alley, who manages about
$2.5 billion at AIM Advisors Inc. in Houston.
<p>
   That should help temper concern that the Fed will soon raise
borrowing rates, some investors said.
<p>
   ``The Fed's likely to be on hold,'' said Alley, who's been
buying bonds lately as he receives cash in his fund. ``We're adding
bonds.''
<p>
   Investors got further evidence that the economy is growing and
jobs are being added at a non-inflationary pace from the Federal
Reserve's report on regional economic activity.
<p>
   While the Fed found ``scattered evidence'' that wages are rising
in its latest survey, the central bank found no evidence of
accelerating inflation, outside of energy prices.
<p>
   ``It more or less confirms the general impression that the
economy has picked up steam and that things are chugging along with
little threat of inflation,'' said Robert McGee, chief economist at
Tokai Bank.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook, commonly known as the beige book, is
based on anecdotal evidence of business conditions compiled by the
Fed's 12 district banks, and is published eight times each year.
The report will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate
targets at Fed's meeting next month.
<p>
   While release of the report had been set for 2 p.m. Eastern
time, it was inadvertently released ahead of schedule on the
Internet.

   Toronto, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks fell, led by
gold issues, on declining bullion prices. Rising bond yields damped
demand for interest-sensitive stocks like BCE Inc. The Toronto
Stock Exchange Composite 300 index fell 17.28 points to 6058.70. It
has declined 1.5 percent since rising to a record 6138.80 on
Friday.
<p>
   Barrick Gold Corp. fell on concern that an accord won't be
reached with the Indonesian government on developing Bre-X Minerals
Ltd.'s gold-rich Busang property before a new 30-day deadline set
by Jakarta expires. ``The uncertainty about Busang is keeping a lid
on (gold) stocks,'' said Tony Popowich, a trader for Altamira
Investment Services Inc., which manages C$15 billion.
<p>
   Barrick fell C$0.60 to C$35.55, and Placer Dome declined C$0.70
to C$27.60. Bre-X rose C$0.05 to C$22.65 in late trading after
falling as much as C$1.
<p>
   The Indonesian government has ordered Barrick to make an
agreement with Bre-X and local interests to develop the Bre-X
discovery, said to be the richest gold find of the century. Placer
Dome has made a takeover bid of more than C$6 billion for Bre-X in
an effort to shut out Barrick.
<p>
   Placer was pushed lower after it said it will lay off 100
employees in Venezuela, or half its workforce there, because of
delays in reaching an accord with Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana
to develop the promising Las Cristinas gold mine.
<p>
   Rising bond yields, which raised concern that interest rates may
climb soon, also hurt utility and phone stocks, such as Teleglobe
Inc. and BCE Inc. Teleglobe fell C$1.70(US$1.27)to C$38.25, while
BCE declined C$0.35 to C$67.20.
<p>
   ``The market's had a nice run and when that happens at the same
time there's concern about interest rates, it's quite normal to
expect the market to correct,'' said Gerry Brockelsby, a partner at
Marquest Investment Counsel Inc. who manages assets of C$850
million.
<p>
   ``People think the interest-rate bogeyman is right around the
corner.''
<p>
   Higher interest rates raise corporate borrowing costs and lower
profits. The yield on Canada's 30-year bond, which is used as a
benchmark for corporate borrowers, jumped 4 basis points to 7.32
percent. Bullion Lower
Weaker bullion prices also hurt gold stocks as the producers'
profit outlook dimmed. Gold for next month delivery fell US$2.10 to
US$351.20 an ounce in New York amid lower demand from investors
because a surging U.S. dollar is making bullion more expensive to
buyers using other currencies. Gold is priced in U.S. dollars.
``You can't be comfortable with gold shares at US$350 prices,''
said Jim Muir, portfolio manager at AGF Trust Co., who manages
assets of C$100 million. Muir sold most of his gold-stock portfolio
just before shares began declining. The gold and precious minerals
group has fallen 11 percent since hitting a three-month high in
mid-November. TVX Gold Inc. fell C$0.15 to C$9.90, Euro-Nevada
Mining Corp. dropped C$0.65 to C$35.20 and Kinross Gold Corp.
slipped C$0.25 to C$9.20. Analysts surveyed by IBES International
expect TVX Gold to post a fourth-quarter profit of US$0.02 a share,
22.7 percent lower than they anticipated a month ago.
<p>
   Weaker crude prices sent the oil and gas group 1.39 percent
lower. Spot crude has fallen 3.5 percent this week because of
milder weather in the northeast U.S. and Canada.
<p>
   Talisman Energy Inc. fell C$1.30 to C$45.95, Petro-Canada
slipped C$0.70 to C$20.80, Renaissance Energy Ltd. declined C$0.95
to C$46.30, and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. fell C$1.30 to
C$37.80.
<p>
   ``They're responding to the weaker commodity prices we've had
over the last few days,'' said Donald Whatley, an oil and gas
analyst at Bunting Warburg Inc.
<p>
   Decliners outpaced advancers 559 to 451, while 270 were
unchanged. On the broader TSE, 120.9 million shares traded above
the three-month daily average of 97.4 million.
<p>
   Air Canada was the most actively traded stock. It jumped C$0.70
to C$8 on 11.92 million shares after it slashed fares by up to 70
percent to more than 100 destinations worldwide. Its offer lasts
until Jan. 30 for travel until May 15.
<p>
   Its Class A shares rose C$0.75 to C$7.50 on 3.43 million shares.
<p>
   The Toronto 35 Index Participation Fund units fell C$0.10 to
C$31.95 on 7 million shares.
<p>
   Golden Rule Resources Ltd. rose C$1.20 to C$12.10 on 2.83
million shares after the company met with Bay St. analysts
yesterday to bring them update on their Stenpad gold concession in
western Ghana.
<p>
   CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. rated the company a
``speculative buy'' at C$10.90, commenting that while the company's
work to date is preliminary, the results ``are quite spectacular.''
<p>
   Northern Telecom Ltd., which accounts for 2.7 percent of the TSE
300, tempered declines by rising C$1.70 to C$95.50.
<p>
   The company said it has signed a US$200-million contract to
supply equipment to Washington-based MCI Communications Corp., one

<p>
   New York, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Touch-It Inc. and its founder
Paul Wakefield are looking to Direct Stock Market Inc.'s Internet
service to help the company go public.
<p>
   Touch-It developed paper that changes color at different
temperatures, ideal for cups that reveal a message when filled with
coffee or soda. The company, born in Wakefield's Ogden, Utah,
garage, is ``just about profitable'' and had about half a million
dollars in revenue last year. While accomplishments for tiny
Touch-It, those results aren't likely to set Wall Street on fire or
snare a big-name underwriter like Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. that's more
attuned to managing Lucent Technologies Inc.'s $3 billion IPO.
<p>
   That's where Direct Stock Market, Direct IPO Inc. and others
come in. These companies offer services ranging from an online
shopping mall, where investors can peruse information on startups
like Touch-It, to the hand-holding and assistance more typical of
an investment bank. Direct IPO, for example, will unveil its first
Internet direct public offering, or DPO, this month, after scouring
300 business plans.
<p>
   ``You can reach a lot more people on the Internet,'' Wakefield
said.
<p>
   Wakefield plans to start selling Touch-It shares next week
through what's known as a SCOR, or small corporate offering
registration, relying on a network of small brokers to push the
stock. A SCOR allows companies to raise as much as $1 million
within a 12-month period.
<p>
   He also plans to sign on with Direct Stock Market, which will
charge $500 a quarter to air Touch-It's prospectus on its Web site
and provide a link to Touch-It's own Internet site. The cost is a
fraction of the $400,000 a traditional underwriter might charge for
a $5 million IPO.
<p>
   ``The price is extremely reasonable,'' Wakefield said. ``The
Internet will fill a void in the offering. It expands the scope of
who you're actually talking to.''
<p>
   The visibility of companies like Direct Stock Market that assist
Internet DPOs follows Spring Street Brewing Co.'s highly publicized
offering last March. About a quarter of the brewer's shares were
sold to investors who saw information about it on the Internet.
<p>
   Andrew Klein, the company's founder, subsequently formed Wit
Capital Corp., which is seeking to let investors buy and sell
Nasdaq stocks on the Internet.
<p>
   Others, like Marina del Rey, California-based Direct IPO,
actually screen potential DPO candidates and take a 5 percent
equity stake in the ones they select. In return, the companies get
a Web-based public relations campaign, guidance and access to a
group of high-tech advisers Direct IPO has assembled.
<p>
   Direct IPO then hopes to hand off the company to a traditional
underwriter three years down the road for another stock sale and a
debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market or regional exchanges.
<p>
   So far, only about 25 to 30 companies have used the Internet
intensively as part of their offerings, raising less than $100
million, estimates John Perkins, chairman of the Small Business
Capital Access Association and former commissioner of securities in
Missouri.
<p>
   That's a speck compared with the record $49 billion initial
public offerings raised last year.
<p>
   Still, DPOs conducted in large part over the Internet are
raising new questions of regulatory oversight -- even though the
Securities and Exchange Commission gives its blessing to the
concept.
<p>
   ``If there is fraudulent trading activity on the World Wide Web
affecting U.S. investors, just like anywhere else, the SEC will
have jurisdiction,'' said Paula Jenson, deputy chief counsel of the
SEC's division of market regulation. ``With the new technology,
it's creating a lot of questions that have to be answered
quickly.''
<p>
   Also troubling to some is the lack of analyst coverage and the
ease with which investors can buy or sell an infrequently traded
stock -- known as liquidity.
<p>
   ``The issue of sponsorship, liquidity, follow-on research, all
of the things that are perceived to be givens in the normal
investment banking activities are potentially absent here,'' said
Dick Smith, equity syndicate manager for San Francisco investment
bank Montgomery Securities.
<p>
   Another company, InterBourse Ltd. is looking to alleviate the
liquidity problem by setting up a trading system for the stocks of
tiny companies that have gone public.
<p>
   Daniel Weaver, a finance professor at Marquette University and
one of InterBourse's founders, plans to charge companies about
$1,000 a month to list shares on the trading site.
<p>
   ``Anybody that wants to help a company go public and doesn't
have a good secondary market is doomed to failure,'' Weaver said,
because investors could be stuck with shares they can't sell.
<p>
   Direct Stock Market, based in Santa Monica, California, features
a handful of companies on its Web site that have been cleared by
regulatory agencies for selling stock.
<p>
   There's Interactive Products &AMP; Services Inc., which is seeking
to develop a hand-held cordless Internet appliance and a wireless
keyboard and mouse for the personal computer. It's aiming to raise
up to $5 million through what's known as a Regulation A filing,
another way companies can sell stock without using an underwriter.
<p>
   Adeptus Corp., of Tacoma, Washington, is selling 2,500 units of
400 shares each to raise $1 million to help finance the development
of a device that will analyze body fluids taken directly from a
patient.
<p>
   ``The only companies that would be using something like this are
the teeny-tiny companies that wouldn't be underwritten by anybody
you'd ever heard of,'' said Montgomery Securities' Smith.
<p>
   Still others view their efforts as a sort of public venture
capital, allowing individual investors to buy shares in young
companies that may be years away from producing earnings.
<p>
   ``We want to be the Kleiner Perkins of Internet offerings,''
said Michael Turpin, chairman of Direct IPO, referring to one of
the best-known venture capital firms in the U.S. that typically
makes its investments available only to wealthy investors.
<p>
   Direct IPO concedes that won't be easy.
<p>
   ``Our first deal is very, very important because it'll set our
reputation with the public, investors and in the media,'' said
President Mark Perlmutter.
<p>
   Though they're off to an ambitious start, DPOs on the Internet
aren't likely to garner interest and credibility until a couple of
the companies hit home runs and earn fat returns for the investors.
<p>
   ``None of us have quit our day jobs,'' said InterBourse's
Weaver.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Uno Restaurant Corp., the
operator of Pizzeria Uno restaurants, today agreed to avoid claims
touting some thin-crust pizzas as low-fat food, settling a false
advertising complaint by the Federal Trade Commission.
<p>
   The FTC charged that Pizzeria Uno ran television and print ads
that falsely promoted the restaurant chain's ``Thinzettas'' line of
thin-crust pizzas as low-fat, when at least six of the line's
pizzas exceeded acceptable limits for low-fat foods.
<p>
   The case marks the first time the federal consumer-protection
agency has brought charges involving nutrition claims by a
restaurant chain.
<p>
   To resolve the allegations, West Roxbury, Massachusetts-based
Uno signed an agreement pledging that it will not misrepresent fat
content or other nutritional information about its pizzas. The
settlement didn't call for a fine or other monetary penalty.
<p>
   Craig Miller, Uno's president and chief executive, said the FTC
complaint involved a single direct-mail brochure and one television
commercial that ran briefly in the Boston market. The pizzeria
chain never meant to imply that all its thin-crust pizzas meet
federal nutrition standards for low-fat foods, he said.
<p>
   ``We never totally agreed with (the FTC), but rather than
challenge them, we said that we never intended to do this . . . and
we're willing to agree that we won't do it again,'' Miller said.
``Fighting the FTC or the U.S. government in the courts is not
something I personally or our company was interested in doing.''
<p>
   To appeal to diners seeking something with less fat than a
regular pizza, Pizzeria Uno designed some Thinzetta thin-crust
pizzas to use less cheese and feature vegetables instead of meat
toppings, Miller said.
<p>
   The FTC, which polices federal false-advertising laws, has
recently stepped up oversight of diet-related promotional efforts.
<p>
   ``Millions of consumers are conscientious about the fat content
of their food,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection. ``Whether selecting low-fat foods at the
grocery store or restaurants, consumers expect nutrient content
claims for products to be true.''
<p>
   Last year, the agency took no action after probing menu claims
by PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell chain, Brinker International Inc.'s
Chili's restaurants, Elias Brothers Restaurants Inc.'s Big Boy
chain, and Carlson Cos.' T.G.I. Friday's.
<p>
   In the last several years, however, food retailers such as Mrs.
Fields Cookies Inc., Dannon Co., and Grand Metropolitan Plc's
Haagen-Dazs Co. have settled FTC charges that they made false
low-fat claims for some food items.
<p>
   Uno shares were unchanged today at 6 3/4.
<p>
   Under its agreement with the FTC, Uno is permitted to make
low-fat claims for food items as long as they meet federal Food and
Drug Administration guidelines for low-fat foods.
<p>
   Uno operates 86 company-owned Pizzeria Uno restaurants and has
63 franchised locations in 30 states.

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- It's 7 a.m. and for Mercury
Trading's option dealers the next 7 1/2 hours will determine
whether the firm's $121,000 investment is lost or becomes worth
millions of dollars.
<p>
   It's expiration day on the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
world's largest options trading arena, a climax reached the third
Friday of each month in which thousands of stock and index options
are exercised for stock, or expire worthless. The activity creates
a chaos that can make an already volatile U.S. stock market
apoplectic. For Mercury chairman Jon Najarian, a 38-year-old former
Chicago Bears linebacker, this chaos is a way of life.
<p>
   Doug Cliggott, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.'s chief stock strategist, in
New York, has never traded an option in his life. Still, he keeps
an watchful eye on what's going on in the options market because it
signals what investors are expecting in the months ahead.
<p>
   ``Right now, many people are nervous and they are looking for
insurance,'' said Cliggott, referring to growing demand for options
that guarantee investors a fixed selling price for their
portfolios. He said the options market is useful because it
indicates how apprehensive or optimistic investors are about the
market.
<p>
   Currently, some measures are predicting the most volatile year
for U.S. stocks since 1990. Demand for options to sell the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 at a fixed price, which are known as ``puts'' and
allow an investor to lock in a minimum selling price as insurance
against market drops, is near its highest in 12 months.
<p>
   Options give an investor the right, but not the obligation to
buy or sell a company's stock or an index at a set price before a
certain date. An option price reflects expectations for volatility,
the duration of the contract, its price relative to the price of
its underlying security, interest rates and the expected dividend
from the underlying stock.
<p>
   If the price is rising for an option that expires at the current
price of the underlying security with no expected changes in
interest rates or dividends, it is an indication investors are
expecting bigger market or industry swings. That's what's happening
now.
<p>
   ``People are expecting a choppy market and they are expecting a
market that could spike down,'' said Michael Kelly, co-head of
derivative research at J.P. Morgan. Options to buy and sell the S&AMP;P
500 Index in the months ahead are being priced as if S&AMP;P 500 has a
66 percent chance of swinging almost 18 percent up or down, with a
bias for a decline.
<p>
   ``The skew to the down side is a combination of people that
remember the big crashes and increasing skepticism of a market at
record highs,'' said Najarian, whose pony-tailed head and 210-pound
frame make him look like a balding Steven Segal.
<p>
   Coming out of the longest bull market ever, a swing even half
the size of the one investors are paying for on the S&AMP;P 500 could
be unsettling for people who have come to expect a stock market
that rises with little deviation. The S&AMP;P is up 68 percent since
the end of 1994 and hasn't dropped more than 10 percent since 1990.
<p>
   ``A lot of investors have been spoiled,'' said Richard Jandrain,
director of equities for Banc One Investment Advisors with $39
billion in assets. ``With volatility on the rise it could scare
away some of the money we have seen coming in and hurt the
market.'' Some $730 billion has been invested in U.S. markets
during the past six years with $223 billion coming in 1996 alone.
<p>
   Volatility is a good thing for people like Najarian since the
more the stock market moves, the more investors seek protection
from or look to take advantage of market swings by trading options.
<p>
   For the typical options trader, handling this business produces
an annual income of at least $200,000, and in a good year millions.
The traders are predominantly men in their late 20's and 30's, with
educational backgrounds ranging from high school dropouts, to
Ph.D.'s. Their common tie is a quickness with numbers, an affinity
for risk and an aversion to three-piece suits -- floor attire
ranges from casual and to bizarre.
<p>
   Najarian got his start in 1981 when his sports agent offered him
a job as a runner on the CBOE after he was cut by the Bears after
four pre-season games. He traded for eight years for himself and
others, then started his own firm. It has grown to employ 27
traders on three exchanges.
<p>
   This morning at the daily strategy meeting in Mercury's office
on the 15th floor of the CBOE building, the atmosphere is relaxed
as Najarian reviews the position each of his traders has in their
respective options. The traders, meanwhile, exchange playful verbal
jabs at each other under the watchful eye of a Beavis and Butt-Head
poster.
<p>
   Later, at the opening bell on the exchange floor, Najarian's
Informix trader, Donny Hough, is bouncing up and down on his toes
packed in a crowd of more than 30 traders. The noise is deafening.
<p>
   Hough's are intensely focused on the price screens mounted
overhead. His objective is to sell Informix stock to replace his
expiring options when the shares rise or sell the stocks when it
drops. Today the shares are rising, and Hough is selling. By midday
he has made a $94,000 profit. Yet, he still has $48,000 worth of
options that will be worthless at 3:10 p.m. central time when the
market closes.
<p>
   ``The only people that can read a market like this are
schizophrenics,'' says Najarian, referring to the need to be able
to profit from sharp market upswings and downturns alike. His firm,
Mercury Trading, named for the Roman god of commerce and guardian
of traders, is responsible for making markets in options for 48
companies including Micron Technology Inc., CompUSA Inc. and
Informix Corp.
<p>
   Mercury is one of 21 Designated Primary Market Makers, or DPM's,
on the Chicago Board Options Exchange with responsibility for
maintaining a fair, orderly market on the floor. About 60 percent
of all options traded in the U.S. change hands on the CBOE,
including 93 percent of all U.S. index options.
<p>
   Work as a DPM can be very lucrative, with income ranging from
break-even for a DPM in their first year to take home pay in excess
of $10 million for an established market maker like Najarian.
<p>
   Costs are also high, the latest price for a seat on the CBOE was
$555,000 up from $330,000 two years ago. Seats, which entitle an
individual to trade can also be leased for about $7,500 a month.
Overall, costs exceed $10,000 a month for each trader. Mercury owns
two seats and leases 12 more.
<p>
   Last night computer chip-maker VLSI Technology Inc. reported
less-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and Mercury's Bill Ray,
who makes a market in the options is frantically exercising his
right to sell the tumbling shares at 22 1/2, capturing $5 in profit
with every trade, or $500,000 so far. What Ray expected to be a
non-event has become his most profitable trade in months. ``I'm
surprised and delighted,'' he said. ``We didn't see this coming.''
<p>
   One indication that Cliggott, Jandrain and other Wall Street
strategists monitor is the put-to-call ratio, or the number of
contracts for ``puts'' which allow an investor to sell a stock or
index at a set price vs. the number of investors buying ``calls,''
or the right to buy at a set price by a set date.
<p>
   Puts are generally purchased as a bet that a security's price
will fall while a call is a bet that it will rise. The ratio
doubled last week as investors bought two puts for every call --
indicating that expectations of a market drop were rising.
<p>
   Some market strategists, including Jandrain, consider a rising
put-to-call ratio to be a bullish sign, viewing it as a contrarian
indicator on the theory that the people buying puts tend to be
smaller investors and are therefore less sophisticated, and more
likely to be wrong.
<p>
   ``The options market has predicted 15 of the last two
recessions,'' Cliggott said. ``But at least it predicts them.''
<p>
   By midday, Najarian's traders have locked in all the profit they
are going take from a rising market and the $121,000 risk has been
reduced to about $6,000. Profits meanwhile are in excess of
$600,000 most of which came compliments of a tumbling VLSI.
<p>
   Last year was the best ever for the equity options market with
199 million contracts changing hands, breaking the record 174
million contracts traded in 1995 -- the first year equity option
volume exceeded the previous record of 164 million contracts in
1987.
<p>
   By the end of trading today, Mercury traders have returned to
their offices to calculate their losses and gains. The tally for
today: a profit of $775,000.

<p>
   Atlanta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The television commercial touts
the virtues of a fast new model: Lots of leg room, great mileage --
with room for 300 and the ability to fly from New York to Paris
nonstop.
<p>
   Airbus Industrie is betting that out of millions of viewers a
select few will want its A330 jetliner. And at $110 million each, a
few buyers is all the European planemaker needs.
<p>
   The ads are aimed at just two prospects -- Arlington,
Virginia-based USAir Group Inc. and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines,
both of which are shopping for new jetliners. Airbus says spending
thousands of dollars on TV ads is part of what it takes to beat
archrival Boeing Co.
<p>
   ``It tells the airline that we really want their business,''
said Dave Venz, Airbus's North American vice president for
communications.
<p>
   Venz said the ads work. When Airbus's sales team visited Delta
in December, he said, the Delta people mentioned that they'd seen
the ads on the morning news.
<p>
   The commercials highlight the spaciousness of the A330's
business-class section. In one spot, a diminutive businessman is
squeezed in a middle seat between two giant men, and repeatedly has
to climb over them to get to the aisle. The narrator points out
that this wouldn't happen on an Airbus plane, which has no middle
seats in business class.
<p>
   ``Airbus doesn't expect Joe Blow to get up in the middle of
`Seinfeld' and order an A330,'' said Michael Boyd, president of
Aviation Research Consultants in Golden, Colorado. ``Airbus is
really hoping that the handful of Delta executives who will decide
(which planes to buy) are tuning in.''
<p>
   Buying TV time is new for Airbus, which is trying to woo U.S.
airlines away from Boeing. Delta, the third-largest U.S. carrier,
is considering buying Airbus's A330 or Boeing's 777 or 767 models.
All are large, twin-engine airplanes designed for cross-country or
transatlantic flights.
<p>
   USAir, meanwhile, has tentatively agreed to buy 120 Airbus
jetliners for about $5 billion, which would be one of the biggest
orders ever for Airbus. Airbus, a consortium of manufacturers from
Germany, France, Spain and the U.K., is doing everything it can to
make the order firm.
<p>
   Airbus's TV campaign is unusual because it's aimed at airlines.
While aircraft makers do advertise, they usually do so in business
publications read by decision makers.
<p>
   Boeing, though, has turned to TV ads in the past. For example
during the Persian Gulf War, when air travel plunged, Boeing ran
ads extolling the benefits of flying.
<p>
   Boeing also ran TV ads in the late 1960s, when it introduced its
massive 747. The ads featured the Harlem Globetrotters basketball
team clowning inside its expansive cabin. That ad was designed to
get people accustomed to such an enormous plane.
<p>
   Winning aircraft orders with mass-market advertising doesn't
have a very promising record. British Aerospace, for example, once
posted a huge billboard outside the Texas headquarters of American
Airlines' parent, AMR Corp. The manufacturer didn't get an order.
<p>
   And marketing executives say that TV advertising -- each spot
costs a minimum of $100,000 to produce -- is a costly way to
compete for a contract.
<p>
   ``This isn't a cheap form of advertising,'' said Dave Capano,
media director of Tausche, Martin &AMP; Lonsdorf, an Atlanta
advertising agency.
<p>
   Yet, there are sound reasons to use TV.
<p>
   ``This gets the manufacturer's name out there,'' Capano said.
``If they do win the contract, consumers will know and favor
them.''
<p>
   That can be important to some travelers. UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines says many passengers ask to fly Boeing's new 777, the
first time in recent memory that consumers say they want to travel
on a specific aircraft. That's the kind of cache a jet manufacturer
dreams about in a world where travelers usually hunt for cheap
fares and little else.
<p>
   Airbus wouldn't say how much it spent on the ads, which were
produced by Euro RSCG-WNK-Gosper in London. The ads, which ran last
month in Washington, Atlanta and Pittsburgh, also ran in Europe and
Asia in October and November. Airbus is planning to run more ads in
the U.S. soon.
<p>
   Local 30-second ad spots in the Atlanta market cost $4,000 to
$6,000 and as much as $10,000 for a top-rated show, media yGexperts
in the area say.
<p>
   ``If this is what the public sees,'' said Boyd at Aviation
Research, ``imagine the wining and dining going on behind the
scenes.''

 &UR; U.S. COMMODITIES: COFFEE SOARS AMID GLOBAL SUPPLY CONCERN &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Coffee jumped to a five-month
high amid concern that a Colombian dockworkers' strike and a
disappointing Brazilian crop would reduce exports from the world's
two top producers.
<p>
   On other markets, gold and soybeans fell. The Commodity Research
Bureau index dropped 0.06 to 240.78, while the energy-weighted
Goldman Sachs Commodity Index gained 0.69 to 209.06.
<p>
   A strike at Colombia's key Pacific port of Buenaventura today
entered its ninth day, delaying shipment of at least 210,000
132-pound bags, said a spokesman for Colombia's Coffee Growers
Federation.
<p>
   At the same time, concern is mounting that Brazil's coffee crop
will fall well short of U.S. Department of Agriculture projections
of 27.0 million bags. Brazilian officials said Monday that the
nation's harvest, normally one-fourth of global supplies, could be
as low as 18 million bags.
<p>
   ``It's difficult to assess the Brazilian crop,'' said Carl
Walker, an analyst at InterAmerican Commodities in Houston. ``That
the prospects for a smaller crop have been advertised is having an
effect on this market,'' he said, while ``the Colombian coffee just
isn't moving.''
<p>
   Coffee for March delivery rose 5.65 cents to $1.353 a pound on
the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, the highest price for an active
contract since Aug. 26.
<p>
   While many traders doubt the accuracy of the Brazilian
forecasts, lean supplies leave little cushion for a shortfall.
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange-monitored warehouses as of Jan. 20
held 22,363 bags, about 100,000 fewer than a year ago.
<p>
   Speculation that the Association of Coffee Producing Countries,
which represents 70 percent of world coffee output and will meet
tomorrow in Brazil, will agree to reduce exports fueled the rally.
<p>
   ``If they decide to cut exports, prices could go higher, given
that roasters' stock levels are fairly low,'' said Szolt Papp, a
commodity analyst at UBS Ltd. in London.
<p>
   Gold dropped to its lowest price since September 1993 as the
dollar surged against several major currencies, raising the cost to
foreign investors.
<p>
   The dollar climbed to a 47-month high against then yen and a 2
1/2-year high against the deutsche mark, powered by expectations
that industrial nations won't act to halt its rise.
<p>
   Gold prices, suffering from forecasts for muted inflation and
the prospect of central bank sales, are down 4.7 percent so far
this year as investors look for more attractive returns elsewhere.
<p>
   ``Gold has suffered all around the world from asset
relocation,'' said Bridget Fraser, a vice president of
commodity-based derivatives at Bankers Trust in New York. ``The
traditional gold holders are looking for alternative investments --
the outlook for gold isn't great. Prices are going lower.''
<p>
   Gold for February delivery fell $2.10 to $351.70 an ounce on the
New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division, its lowest closing
price since Sept. 17, 1993.
<p>
   Also, Bema Gold Corp. announced plans to double production at a
mine in northern Chile during the next few years. The Refugio mine
has the potential to produce 500,000 ounces of gold a year,
compared with its target for 1997 of 240,000 ounces.
<p>
   Soybean futures fell amid expectations that recent rains in
South America replenished soil moisture, promising a bumper
harvest.
<p>
   As much as 3 inches of rain last weekend fell on the world's
second-largest soybean crop, with the greatest amounts in key
growing areas of southern Brazil. Additional water is on the way.
Weather Services Corp. said scattered rains are likely in southern
Brazil through the weekend, and chances are increasing for showers
or thundershowers early next week.
<p>
   The rains could end concern that dry weather during the past
month would stunt development of the world's second-largest soybean
crop at 26.0 million metric tons.
<p>
   ``People don't believe we have a weather problem in South
America,'' said Don Roose, analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa. ``We think it's almost back to ideal, and that
has set the market back.''
<p>
   Soybeans for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell
to $7.405 a bushel, down 6.25 cents.
<p>
   Other commodities settled as follow:
Precious Metals: February Gold down $2.10 to $351.70 an ounce March
Silver up 0.08 cent to $4.723 an ounce April Platinum down $1.70 to
$359.80 an ounce March Palladium up 5 cents to $123.60 an ounce

<p>
   Islandia, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Computer Associates
International Inc. shares fell 5.9 percent amid concern about
European sales.
<p>
   The third-largest software maker yesterday reported
third-quarter earnings slightly higher than analysts' estimates and
revenue in line with company forecasts. Computer Associates'
European sales, though, fell 21 percent, more than expected,
analysts said.
<p>
   Computer Associates shares fell 2 1/2 to 43 1/2 in trading of
11.9 million, making the stock among the most active in U.S.
trading. Earlier shares touched 42 1/2. The company released
yesterday the earnings statement after the close of U.S. markets.
<p>
   ``The European market was worse than expected,'' said Andrew
Roskill, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
<p>
   The Islandia, New York-based company warned last month of
disappointing sales as it switches to new products in Europe. It
will take one or two quarters to bring the European business up to
speed, Computer Associates said.
<p>
   The company, which makes software used to monitor computer
systems, has been shifting its focus to selling client-server
software that manages networks of computers and away from products
for large mainframe computers.
<p>
   Computer Associates said its European sales force hasn't been
aggressive enough in building the new business, resulting in
lower-than-expected revenue.
<p>
   The company also told analysts and investors in a conference
call last night that European sales were reduced by poor growth in
upgrading mainframe processing power, Roskill said. When companies
upgrade their mainframe processing power, they typically buy more
software from Computer Associates, he said.
<p>
   International Business Machines Corp. said last night its
fourth-quarter earnings failed to meet analysts' estimates, in
part, because of weak economies in Europe and slow sales of
workstations and mainframes.
<p>
   Computer Associates recorded profit from operations rose to
$284.7 million, or 75 cents a share, from net income of $227.2
million, or 60 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Including a
charge of $598 million, or $1.57 a share, for the acquisition of
Cheyenne Software Inc., the company had a loss was $313.3 million,
or 86 cents a share.
<p>
   Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 5 percent to $1.05
billion from $1 billion.
<p>
   Wall Street expected the software maker to earn 74 cents a
share, excluding the charges, based on the average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Computer Associates said it's focusing on improving the training
of its salespeople in Europe. European customers have been slow in
changing from mainframe systems to client-servers, and its sales
people hadn't been persuasive enough in encouraging the switch, the
company said.
<p>
   Client-server systems overall are selling at a faster pace than
mainframes, as more companies use networks of high-powered computer
servers linked to personal computers.
<p>
   ``We see this as an opportunity to buy the stock,'' said Bruce
Raabe, an analyst at Collins &AMP; Co. The stock was reiterated a
``buy'' by analyst Sanjiv Hingorani at Furman Selz Inc. and
``outperform'' by Smith Barney's Roskill.
<p>
   The company said it expects that its revenue will be equally
split between client-server software and mainframe sales by the
middle of 1998.
<p>
   That's compared with 61 percent of revenue that came from
mainframe sales in the third quarter and 63 percent in the second
quarter.
<p>
   Mainframe sales for the quarter were $640 million, while
client-server sales were $371 million. International sales were
$409 million, down from $519 million in the year-earlier period,
Roskill said. U.S. sales in the third quarter accounted for $644
million.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  If Bill Belichick really is hired to become the
next coach of the Raiders, we are all in for some rollicking good
times. This guy is a riot.
<p>
   Ask him about the Oakland rumor, and he says, ``All my focus
right now is on the Green Bay Packers.''
<p>
   Ask him about spending his five years as the head coach of the
Cleveland Browns and being the last man Art Modell abandoned on his
way to Baltimore, and he says, ``I'm only concentrating on beating
the Packers.''
<p>
   Ask him about whether he would like to be a head coach anywhere,
and he says ... well, you know.
<p>
   ``That's not what I'm here to talk about,'' the defensive
backfield coach of the New England Patriots said Tuesday. ``Not
last year, or next year, or 1983. I'm focusing all my energies on
beating the Packers.''
<p>
   See? You can't get this stuff on ``Evening At The Improv,'' or
``Def Comedy Jam.'' Only from Bill Belichick.
<p>
   The Belichick-Raider rumors have been floating for about a week
and have picked up intensity the last few days. Now it may well be
that he would not be a very good fit for Al Davis (and let's face
it, there aren't many of those anyway). But still it's out there,
and the world's media must be entertained while Bill Parcells
pretends he's not on his way to New York to resuscitate the Jets.
<p>
   So where better to go than the source?
<p>
   ``So Bill, did your last year in Cleveland teach you ...''
<p>
   ``Are you a different coach now after your experience in ... ''
<p>
   ``Did you ever think you'd get another opportunity to ... ''
<p>
   No matter. ``Right now what we're talking about is trying to
beat Green Bay.''
<p>
   Yeah, but ...
<p>
   ``You can throw out that hook, change bait and keep casting, but
it's not going to change,'' he said with a smile. ``Trust me on
this one ... Packers.''
<p>
   It is this kind of monomaniacal eye-on-the-prize behavior that
made him a successful aide to Parcells when the New York Giants
were vying with the 49ers for dominance. It is the same trait that
helped make his time in Cleveland so unpleasant, capped by the
graceless dismissal of quarterback and local icon Bernie Kosar.
<p>
   By the end, he ended up one of the scapegoats Modell was looking
for as he prepared to abandon Ohio for Maryland. Belichick was
fired over the phone, and had it not been for Parcells he might
still be out of the game. The Patriots' coaching staff is made up
almost entirely of men who either coached or played for Parcells in
New York, and Belichick was considered the brightest on the staff.
<p>
   One theory has it that Parcells, who brought back Belichick in
part to try to get him another head coaching spot, expected owner
Bob Kraft to hire Belichick as the new head coach when Parcells
leaves and is unhappy that is now regarded as unlikely.
<p>
   Parcells doesn't say, and Belichick, well, you know.
<p>
   But the notion he might become the next Raiders coach is not so
far-fetched. For one, the Raiders have managed to nobody's surprise
to be among the last teams to enter the Find-A-Coach pageant. For
two, Parcells and Davis talk relatively often. For three, Belichick
might well be a good coach; it wasn't as though he was overburdened
with talent or resources in Cleveland.
<p>
   In fact, most folks in Cleveland who prefer to dislike him point
to his people skills as a principal problem. Now we don't like to
make assumptions about people we've never met, unless of course
there is a possibility for amusement, but if Belichick is not a
great people guy the Raiders are eminently qualified to live with
that.
<p>
   Besides, if Dick Vermeil can take 15 years off to examine the
darker side of Brent Musburger and still get a job, why are there
flies on Belichick? Well, we're not quite sure. The Raiders aren't
talking (as though they ever do), and Belichick isn't either (as
though he would).
<p>
   So there you have it. Bill Belichick, possibly the new head
coach of your Oakland Raiders. A man with no apparent past or
future, heading into his third Super Bowl.
<p>
   Ah, but what will he say come Monday, when the Packers are no
longer on New England's schedule? ``All my concentration is focused
on our first minicamp,'' he will say. Now what did I tell you about
this guy? He's a total stitch.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Don Mattingly, the greatest New
York Yankee never to appear in a World Series, retired from
baseball.
<p>
   Mattingly, 35, has not played since 1995 and was plagued by back
problems his final few seasons that cut his production.
<p>
   A free agent after his last season, Mattingly didn't re-sign
with the Yankees and sat out in 1996 as New York won its first
World Series in 18 years.
<p>
   ``I'm proud of everything I've been able to accomplish here with
the Yankees,'' Mattingly said at a press conference at Yankee
Stadium. ``I look back with joy at the opportunities I had and with
no regrets.''
<p>
   He never formally retired, leaving open the possibility to a
return to New York or another major league team. Last season,
Mattingly received contract offers from three or four teams,
although he didn't accept any.
<p>
   ``One of the main words for me has always been loyalty,'' said
Mattingly, who was accompanied by his wife, Kim, and their three
sons. ``One thing I couldn't think of was the thought of myself
playing somewhere else.''
<p>
   He said he originally intended to return in 1997 until a week or
so after Thanksgiving, when he stopped working out.
<p>
   ``When I left it was open ended,'' he said. ``I guess I wasn't
really willing to pay the price to be successful. At that point I
knew it was time to step away and that's what I'm doing today.''
<p>
   A six-time All-Star, Mattingly hit .307 with 222 home runs and
1,099 runs batted in during his 13-year career. He won the 1984
American League batting title with a .343 average, edging out
teammate Dave Winfield on the final day of the season, and was
named the 1985 American League Most Valuable Player after hitting
.324 with 35 HR and 145 RBI.
<p>
   ``We've had greats here with the Yankees, but he's one of the
truly great,'' said Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
<p>
   Mattingly burst upon the New York baseball scene in his first
full season of 1984. In addition to winning the batting crown, he
led the American League with 207 hits and 44 doubles.
<p>
   He topped those accomplishments the next season by winning the
Most Valuable Player Award, leading the major leagues with 145 RBI
and 48 doubles, and won his first Gold Glove Award.
<p>
   Those two seasons began a six-year stretch in which many
considered him the best player in baseball. From 1984-89, Mattingly
hit a combined .327 with 160 home runs and 684 RBI and was named to
the All-Star team each season.
<p>
   ``I never felt like I was as talented as other players,''
Mattingly said. ``I felt, though, that I was willing to do things
other players weren't willing to do.''
<p>
   He etched his name in the major league record book in 1987 by
belting six grand slams during the season and tied Dale Long's
31-year-old major league mark by hitting home runs in eight
straight games.
<p>
   His back problems began in the 1990 season when he missed 54
games, and his production also began to drop. Although his average
would still hover around .290, his power numbers fell. He averaged
just under 10 home runs and 64 RBI his final six seasons.
<p>
   In 1991, the Yankees named him the 10th captain in team history,
joining the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Thurman Munson. The
team hasn't named a replacement.
<p>
   For all the awards and accolades Mattingly collected, the World
Series eluded him.
<p>
   In his first 11 seasons, the Yankees only finished as high as
second place three times. He looked like he would finally get his
chance in 1994 when the Yankees had the best record in the American
League, although the strike ended the season early and caused the
cancellation of the postseason.
<p>
   Mattingly finally got a taste of postseason play in 1995 when
the Yankees won the first American League wild-card berth. He
shined during a five-game series loss to Seattle, hitting .417 with
one home run and tying for the team lead with six RBI. ]| Mattingly
said he felt that his whole career had been about timing. The
Yankees won their previous world championship in 1978, a year
before he signed with the team, and won their next one the year
after he left the game.
<p>
   ``It was a dual-edge sword from the standpoint of not being
here,'' Mattingly said when asked about the 1996 championship. ``It
was painful, but I was happy for the team.
<p>
   ``I told Kim a week after the series was over and everything
calmed down that I did the right thing and felt good about it.''
<p>
   A complete player, Mattingly was known for his fielding as well
as his hitting.
<p>
   He won nine Gold Glove Awards, most by an American League first
baseman, and led the league in fielding a record seven times.
<p>
   With just 68 errors in 15,462 career chances, his .996 fielding
percentage is the best of any position player in baseball history.
<p>
   While his offense may have suffered from an ailing back toward
the end of his career, his defense didn't. Mattingly set new team
records for fielding percentage for a first baseman in 1993 and
1994 at .998, committing just three errors the first year and just
two the second.
<p>
   Mattingly said he will now turn his attention to his family and
raising horses on his farm in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana.
He also said he would like to give something back to baseball.
<p>
   ``When I was playing, I didn't want to think about anything but
baseball,'' he said. ``I like to be able now to give back,
baseball-wise, to kids through clinics and teach.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  In his time, Curt Flood was an original. A Gold Glove
center fielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, he was also a brooder
and a painter and an iconoclast whose active and nervous
intelligence drove him not only to question authority, but to blow
it up.
<p>
   Curt Flood took baseball to the wall.
<p>
   He took unfavorable and costly action against the people who
made up the rules.
<p>
   In 1969, Flood refused to report for duty after the Cardinals
traded him to the Phillies. Instead of accepting his fate, Flood
took his sense of outrage and injustice all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
<p>
   He would not be treated like meat.
<p>
   As a 12-year veteran, he should have some say in what happened
to him.
<p>
   He fought a system that bound Mickey Mantle to the Yankees, Bob
Gibson to the Cardinals and Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers.
<p>
   Flood lost his case. But it is his undying legacy that his fight
enabled others after him to win.
<p>
   But what about this winning?
<p>
   What about the new world order in sports that Curt Flood
invented by calling himself a ``free agent?''
<p>
   We don't have Curt Floods in sports these days. Mostly because
we don't need them, or so it would seem.
<p>
   Today's battles are about the bottom line.
<p>
   Everyone's a star. Everyone's a corporation. Too many players
think they are as big if not bigger than the game, which is a
notion affirmed by their sneaker makers.
<p>
   Gary Payton and Ken Griffey Jr. and Andre Agassi are not only
bound to the NBA, Major League Baseball or the ATP, they are bound
to each other, as ``part of the Nike family.''
<p>
   These guys say these things. And mean it.
<p>
   Twenty-five years ago, Flood did all the dirty work for freedom
and the rights of an individual player to make their own deals,
their best deals.
<p>
   But now, it's 180 degrees wrong the other way.
<p>
   The time line from Curt Flood's righteous and right-on protest
down to Dennis Rodman's latest NBA suspension is filled with other
eruptions and episodes that have radically changed the climate in
which athletes labor.
<p>
   But certainly, a quarter century later, free agency has turned
into free lunacy.
<p>
   Now it's bad as you wanna be.
<p>
   Now it's rich rewards not for substance and convictions, but for
House of Style cameos and fishnet pants and tie-dyed hair that is
only half as mixed up as the stuff inside a Dennis Rodman cranium.
<p>
   Instead of Curt Flood, we get Dennis Rodman as the most
flamboyant symbol of our sporting era  &MD;  with Nike and Converse and
MTV willing to bank their profit margins on a guy who is mistakenly
marketed as the brave one, willing to live out his fantasies in
public.
<p>
   I have a fantasy, too. It's that Nike, Converse and MTV would
cut Rodman loose. Rodman unplugged. For his sake. For ours. So we
can concentrate on other players who are trying to do the right
thing, even though it's hard to figure that out.
<p>
   Sports can give us heroes and role models. Sports can give us
real revolutionaries, not just rebels without a clue.
<p>
   On NBC last Sunday, as the Rodman-less Bulls were getting
hammered by the Rockets, commentator and former NBA great Julius
Erving made a personal plea to Rodman, who was missing game No. 2
of an 11-game (maybe longer) suspension.
<p>
   Erving said one day, when Rodman is done with his career, either
through retirement or exile, he will regret that he never gave
anything back to the game.
<p>
   Erving's plea seemed just as naive as it was earnest.
<p>
   The very idea that Rodman should recognize his responsibility to
give something back to the game seems as far-fetched as his wedding
dress publicity stunts.
<p>
   Rodman, whose free agency landed him a one-year, $10 million
deal with the Bulls this season, is making the Forbes big money
list because he refuses to accept the larger responsibility that
most NBA players, and most athletes, eventually come to accept.
<p>
   Rodman is living proof that humans, unfortunately, need a few
checks and balances to keep things from exploding.
<p>
   ``We all have times of frustration when we want to retaliate,
but we know we can't,'' Michael Jordan said when asked for his take
on Rodman's groin-kicking of a courtside cameraman.
<p>
   Well, this week, when Curt Flood died of cancer, the world lost
a man who fought the good fight for a cause that was worthy of his
anger and frustration and worthy of retaliation.
<p>
   For that, Flood never got the chance to finish what he started.
His .296 career batting average, seven Gold Gloves and three
All-Star appearances had all the makings of a Hall of Fame career.
<p>
   But he traded it to make a stand.
<p>
   Rodman, a gifted athlete who has re-created the art of defense
and rebounding with his tireless effort, is about to trade his for
nothing except the right to be as bad as he wants to be, just
because he thinks he's the boldest sign of our times.
<p>
   Here's hoping history is not as kind to Dennis Rodman as it has
been and will be to Curt Flood.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- So it wasn't a great
inaugural speech. So historians don't believe Bill Clinton will
rank as a great president. So what? Clinton, as his second term
begins, stands a good chance of presiding over eight years of peace
and prosperity. What president wouldn't covet that record for his
place in history?
<p>
   ``A lot of presidents would say, 'May God bless me with that
record,''' said Norman Ornstein, a political science scholar at The
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.
<p>
   Clinton, in interviews, likened himself to Thomas Jefferson and
Theodore Roosevelt, presidents who led the country as it entered
previous centuries. The United States will enter its third century
in 2000, the final year of Clinton's presidency.
<p>
   However, Clinton's stewardship more closely resembles that of
Dwight Eisenhower. He, too, served two terms. He, too, steered the
country down the middle of the road. He, too, presided over peace
and relative prosperity. He, too, was much maligned during his time
in the White House.
<p>
   Yet Eisenhower's reputation is much higher today. If not
regarded as a ``great'' president, he's now rated as well above
average. His ranking has jumped from 22nd in the 1962 poll of
historians conducted by Arthur Schlesinger, the Harvard professor,
to among the top 10 more recently. ``Eisenhower is now seen as
having been a very useful president,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at The Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank.
<p>
   Clinton could end up with a similar destiny, if the next four
years and history are kind. With luck as well as skill, the
president will have neither an international or domestic crisis to
deal with. There are no war clouds abroad and no recession, or
worse, immediately in sight at home.
<p>
   That benign outlook, strange as it may seem, is enough to
deprive Clinton of greatness. As he, himself, has said in
interviews, greatness tends to be bestowed on those presidents who
are faced with crises; be they George Washington who presided over
the founding of the country, or Abraham Lincoln who was confronted
by the slavery issue and the Civil War, or Franklin Roosevelt, who
had to cope with the Great Depression and World War II.
<p>
   Clinton's place in history, rather, will be determined by his
success, or lack of it, in attaining the goals he has set for his
second term. At the top of the president's agenda is reaching
agreement with congressional Republicans on a plan to balance the
budget by the year 2002.
<p>
   That may not seem to be such a big deal when compared with
winning wars and ending depressions. Yet, it could earn for Clinton
a place in the record books.
<p>
   The current economic expansion will be six years old this
spring. If it endures through Clinton's second term, it will
surpass the expansions of the 1980s and 1960s as the longest of the
post-World War II era. No small achievement.
<p>
   It's true most economists don't see that happening, with the
consensus predicting a recession in 1998 or 1999. Yet many
economists also agree that expansions don't inevitably die of old
age; rather, they come about because of unforeseen foreign crises
or policy mistakes by Clinton or others.
<p>
   In the current situation, most economists agree, one policy
mistake would be for Clinton to abandon his balanced budget goal,
which he so far shows no signs of doing. Abandoning the goal would
increase the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates to contain the inflationary effect of widening deficits.
<p>
   Another policy mistake, obviously, would be for the Fed to wait
too long to move against inflation even if the budget continues on
the road to balance. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan shows no
inclination toward making that error. He told a congressional
committee this week that there are signs that the nation's tight
labor markets may be beginning to boost workers' pay increases
enough to cause inflation to pick up down the road. If that
happens, he indicated, the central bank will respond by raising
interest rates.
<p>
   Raising rates this year to head off an acceleration in
inflation, of course, would reduce the need to raise rates even
higher later on once inflation builds a head of steam. Early
action, moreover, would give the Fed flexibility to lower rates if
the economy slows too much going into 1998 and thus avert a
recession. If the Fed is skillful, ``we could see the economy
remain strong for quite a while,'' said AEI's Ornstein.
<p>
   For Clinton to make his contribution to the expansion's
longevity, he'll have to ignore the advice of the Schlesinger
historians, now presided over by Arthur Jr. ``Middle-roading may be
fine for campaigning, but it is a sure road to mediocrity in
governing,'' he wrote in a December ranking of presidents in the
New York Times. ``The middle of the road is not the vital center:
it is the dead center. Clinton would be wise to eschew it if he
wants to improve his ratings.''
<p>
   Clinton, however, has no choice but to travel down the middle of
the road; Congress is in Republican hands, after all. The
Republicans failed attempt at confrontation politics a year ago
certainly didn't advance the national agenda. Since his reelection,
the president has talked of the need for political cooperation and
giving voice to America's vital center.
<p>
   He did so again in his inaugural address. Noting that voters had
elected a Republican Congress and a Democratic president, Clinton
said: ``Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of
petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.''
<p>
   This week the president also played his opening card -- a
proposed $138 billion cut in Medicare expenditures over six years
-- in this year's battle of the budget. His formal budget will be
sent to Congress early next month, which will begin the political
painful process of trying to reduce the soaring costs of programs
that distribute benefits to people directly. If the
middle-of-the-road is Eisenhower terrain, then Clinton may find the
journey into history to have a rewarding destination -- a ``peace
and prosperity'' president, like Ike.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  You are Sherm Lewis. You are the offensive
coordinator of the Green Bay Packers, have been for five years now.
Your offense led the NFL in scoring this season and produced the
league's most valuable player.
<p>
   You are 54 years old, yet you have coached at only three places
in all that time, at Michigan State, the 49ers and the Packers.
Your imprint is one of constancy in a vagabond profession.
<p>
   You want to rise a rung above your current job and become a head
coach. You know this is a good time to have such a hankering
because there are more openings for head coaching positions than
ever before. Or were. By Monday there will have been 11 openings
around the NFL.
<p>
   Are you considered for any one of them? You are not. You are not
happy, especially now that the openings are closing rapidly.
<p>
   ``If it happens, it happens,'' is your pragmatic reply. ``So
many of them close up before I get a chance to interview. What can
you do?'' You coach the Green Bay offense in Super Bowl XXXI on
Sunday against the New England Patriots is what you do. You hope
the right people notice the man with the trim mustache in the
coaching box at the Louisiana Superdome.
<p>
   ``My main objective is to win the Super Bowl and not get caught
up in this thing,'' you say with little conviction. ``If I win
enough of them, someone is going to recognize me.''
<p>
   Maybe not. When the St. Louis Rams reached into the broadcast
booth and snatched up Dick Vermiel as their new coach, it reduced
the available openings in the NFL to three: New Orleans, Oakland
and the New York Jets.
<p>
   You will not get the Jets' job. That has been promised to Bill
Parcells, the New England coach, as soon as the Super Bowl is over.
<p>
   You probably will not get the New England job. Word is Pete
Carroll, late the 49ers' defensive coordinator, is already putting
a staff together in advance of Parcells' departure.
<p>
   You probably will not get the Oakland job, either. Cold fish
Bill Belichick is the hot candidate for the Raiders as soon as he's
through being the Patriots' assistant head coach.
<p>
   That leaves the Saints, Sherm. A team that has never won a
playoff game. A team that Jim Mora abandoned in midseason in
disgust.
<p>
   ``It's a great opportunity,'' you say. ``You'd like to have any
job in the NFL. I'd just like an opportunity to sit down with
someone and express myself.''
<p>
   You have one problem, Sherm. A seemingly sensible rule is
preventing teams from officially contacting you. Four years ago the
Chicago Bears locked up Dave Wannstedt as their head coach while he
was still a member of Jimmy Johnson's Super Bowl staff in Dallas.
<p>
   Anticipating widespread duplicity, the league instigated a ``no
tampering'' rule in which teams could not officially contact a
coach on another staff until his season was over. Of course, there
is official contact and hey-how's-it-going contact.
<p>
   You know, then, that teams are taking the high ground with you
on this one, waving the rule in your face as if to say, ``Sorry,
Sherm. Rules are rules.'' ``I don't think it's fair,'' you say.
``If someone wanted me bad enough, they'd wait. It's not an excuse.
It's happened for the last 10 years now. If they want you, they'll
find some way to get in touch with you.''
<p>
   Your fight is not a lonely one. You have allies.
<p>
   ``Forget about Sherm Lewis,'' said Ronnie Lott, who was a 49er
when you were on the staff in San Francisco. ``We had 10 openings
this past year. Not one African American was a candidate for a job,
not one African American was hired. It's ludicrous. It's sad. It's
sickening. I'm somewhat appalled.''
<p>
   Oh, yes, when you look in the mirror, you see a face the result
of an African diaspora set in motion nearly 500 years ago. You do
not claim race is a factor in your not getting a head coaching job.
But you wonder, especially when you see Steve Mariucci hired to
coach the 49ers following an intensive search that lasted, oh,
about 20 minutes.
<p>
   You are not happy about that one. Neither is your boss, Packers
coach Mike Holmgren. You both spent years on that staff, working
for Bill Walsh and George Seifert.
<p>
   ``I was a little surprised they didn't wait to maybe talk to
Sherm,'' Holmgren said. ``Sherm Lewis is one of the fine coaches in
this league. I've had coaches on my staff now that are head coaches
in this league ... and there isn't one of those men any better than
Sherm Lewis.''
<p>
   So you continue to coach the Packers' offense while other men
are hired for jobs you would be interested in. You look at the
Super Bowl XXIII ring gaudy on your finger from your days as a San
Francisco assistant and consider one more injustice in life.
Because of your team's success, your professional growth is
stunted.
<p>
   ``If someone was really interested in me, they'd let me know,''
you say. ``I don't believe it would make a big difference between
this week and next.''
<p>
   You are Sherm Lewis and you wonder about the way things work.
Take apart the machine piece by piece and you might not like what
you see.

<p>
   Pontiac, Michigan, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- An organizing
committee wants to start a college football bowl game to be played
in the Pontiac Silverdome, raising the number of bowls sanctioned
by the NCAA to 19.
<p>
   Organizers of the Motor City Bowl hope to match the champion of
the Mid-American Conference with an at-large team on Dec. 26 at the
80,368-seat home of the NFL's Detroit Lions. The bowl would provide
only the second at-large berth in the bowl system, joining the
Independence Bowl.
<p>
   ``We were interested in getting a MAC team playing in the
Pontiac Silverdome for regional interest,'' said Ken Hoffman, a
representative of the Motor City Bowl Organizing Committee.
<p>
   The MAC champion has played the Big West Conference champion for
the last 16 years in a postseason bowl. The game has been played in
Las Vegas for the last five years, after 11 years as the California
Raisin Bowl.
<p>
   Tom Lessig, the MAC's director of communications, wouldn't
confirm the league's involvement in the game.
<p>
   Each participating team will receive at least $750,000, which is
the NCAA's minimum for bowl accreditation. Hoffman said the money
will be raised through ticket sales, corporate sponsorships,
broadcasting and licensing revenues, like any of the other bowl
games.
<p>
   Hoffman said that the game's title sponsor and television
package are in place, yet wouldn't be revealed until Jan. 30.
<p>
   The game still needs approval of the NCAA's Special Events
Committee and a waiver to be played this year. Approval won't be
granted until the committee meets in late April.
<p>
   The Silverdome tried hosting a bowl once before, yet the Cherry
Bowl failed in 1985 after two years. Hoffman says the Motor City
Bowl organizers have overcome obstacles that hampered the earlier
game. ``There were significant hurdles that the Cherry Bowl had to
overcome that we have taken care of,'' he said. ``There are some
things that we have been able to do.''
<p>
   The Silverdome will lose the Lions by 2005 after a new
70,000-seat domed football stadium is built in downtown Detroit as
part of a complex with a new open-air ballpark for Major League
Baseball's Detroit Tigers.
<p>
   ``That didn't enter into our thinking at all,'' Hoffman said.
``The Pontiac Silverdome certainly fills our need of a place to
play very well.''

 &UR; NEW WEB SITE LETS ANYONE TRACK INFLUENCE OF CAMPAIGN MONEY

    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &QC;  &LR; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Voters will be able to track how campaign funds
influence their representatives in Congress through a
first-of-its-kind Internet site being unveiled Thursday.
<p>
   Created by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, a
campaign finance watchdog group, the site allows users to see how
much money a lawmaker received in political action committee (PAC)
contributions on dozens of issues, many of which are expected to be
debated by the new Congress.
<p>
   The World Wide Web address is: www.crp.org
<p>
   After accessing the site, users can click on a ``Cashing In''
headline that will let them narrow the search for contributions by
issue, state, an individual lawmaker's name or by political party.
<p>
   ``It's customized, so you can ask it to give you all the members
of your state delegation who voted on a particular issue, and it
will tell you how much money each one got,'' said Jay Youngclaus, a
spokesman for the group.
<p>
   ``We hope this will show more people what a large role money
plays in politics,'' he added. ``You'll see that large amounts of
money typically flow to one particular side of an issue, and that's
the side that usually wins.''
<p>
   The group tracked only money from PACs, which have become a
target of reformers who claim they give special-interest groups too
much influence in campaigns. Contributions from single contributors
were not included, Youngclaus said, in part because it is often
difficult to clearly identify an individual as being aligned with a
particular side of an issue.
<p>
   The group's site includes PAC contributions over the past two
years to House members, and PAC contributions for the past six
years for members of the Senate.
<p>
   It shows how the PAC money flowed to lawmakers on heavily
lobbied issues  &MD;  such as federal peanut subsidies or electricity
deregulation  &MD;  during the just-completed 104th Congress. Many of
these issues will be debated again by the new Congress that just
took office.

<p>
   Dallas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- To thrive, a so-called concept
restaurant chain like Brinker International Inc. must do two
things: Jazz up its old restaurants and come up with ideas for new
ones.
<p>
   The Dallas-based company has spent the last few years trying to
turn around its 500 Chili Bar &AMP; Grill stores, a hot chain in the
late '80s and early '90s before diners got bored.
<p>
   Yet Brinker may stand a better chance with the new -- in this
case, a takeout store it calls Eatzi's, which caters to upscale
customers whose tastes range from exotic fare to comfort food. The
store is designed to grab business from supermarkets and other
chains like Boston Chicken Inc. and already shows promise: the
year-old prototype in suburban Dallas has monthly sales of $1
million on twice the expected volume.
<p>
   ``I have seen the future and it is Eatzi's,'' said NatWest
Securities Inc. analyst Damon Brundage.
<p>
   It may take nothing less than a vision of the future to bring
Brinker back. Brinker's earnings growth started slowing in 1994.
Then, in 1996, profit plunged 53 percent to $34 million from $73
million as the company took charges to close several Grady's
American Grill and Spageddies Italian Kitchen, two of Brinker's
newer chains. Investors have soured on the company, whose stock has
tumbled from a high of 33 in early 1994 and recently traded at
about 15.
<p>
   ``The history of Brinker is that a lot of its small, promising
restaurant concepts never live up to their potential,'' said Rajan
Chaudhry, editor of Chain Leader, a restaurant trade publication.
``They reach 15 or 20 restaurants and the wheels start coming
off.''
<p>
   Brinker is betting that Eatzi's is different and will ride a
major industry shift: slow growth for sit-down restaurants, while
the takeout business booms.
<p>
   ``We said to ourselves, `boy are we poorly positioned for an up
and coming trend,'' said Brinker Executive Vice President Lane
Cardwell.
<p>
   Much of Brinker's faith in Eatzi's hangs on the man behind the
idea, Phil Romano. Romano and partner and fellow restaurant-design
guru Rich Melman -- credited with creating some of Chicago's
snazziest restaurants -- own 50 percent of Eatzi's. Brinker owns
the rest.
<p>
   Romano is considered something of a genius in the restaurant
industry, best known as the developer of the Fuddruckers chain of
hamburger restaurants that prospered in the 1980s. Fuddruckers
thrived on a novelty: As customers entered, a glass wall revealed
workers grinding meat for burgers.
<p>
   The Fuddruckers fad didn't age well, though, and its results
have dragged down the earnings of parent Daka International Inc.
<p>
   While the Eatzi's experiment has done well, it still has a long
way to go.
<p>
   ``If they had 100 of them it could be a billion dollar
business,'' said Dean Witter analyst David Adelman. ``Or it could
fall on its face.''
<p>
   The key to Eatzi's isn't just the food, which is cooked to order
and ranges from fresh baked bread to gourmet tossed salads to meat
loaf with mashed potatoes or poached salmon with raspberry sauce
for $5 to $8 a meal. More important, perhaps, Eatzi's is about
atmosphere.
<p>
   Food is cooked in the open, refrigerators are stocked during
business hours and chefs pluck their ingredients off the store
shelves rather than from a refrigerator behind a counter. The
bustle gives the farmers-market-style shop the kind of buzz that
draws customers back for more.
<p>
   ``It's a remarkable concept,'' said Eatzi's regular William
Barker. ``We don't have any kids at home and cooking for two is
sometimes a chore. Our friends do the same thing -- they're middle-
to upper-middle class and willing to pay a little more.''
<p>
   Eatzi's customers are a demographer's dream, with household
income of $35,000 to $55,000 a year and more money than time to
spend.
<p>
   ``It's more of a lifestyle thing than an income thing,''
Cardwell said.
<p>
   There is a hitch. Because it appeals to a limited audience --
mostly single, young and prosperous -- Brinker believes Eatzi's
growth potential has its limits. Cardwell said he thinks the U.S.
can support about 100 stores. That's a far cry from the 1,300
stores operated by No. 1 grocery chain Kroger Co.
<p>
   Finding workers may be another problem. The store has 45 chefs,
each paid a minimum of $8 an hour and a job requirement that plenty
of cranky chefs can't cut: They're supposed to chat up customers,
describing how the meal is being prepared.
<p>
   Another challenge may be finding management with the skills to
run this meld of grocery store and restaurant.
<p>
   ``The execution is higher than a typical Chili's,'' said Marina
Carlson, a portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management, which
held 922,360 Brinker shares as of September.
<p>
   Yet, she thinks that Brinker can roll out Eatzi's ``pretty
broadly across the nation.'' Already the company is considering
stores in Houston and Chicago.
<p>
   It may just work, especially if Brinker duplicates the ambiance
of a relative's crowded kitchen during a holiday with just one
difference: the cash register at the end.

   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Petroleos de Venezuela SA said a
planned 30-billion-bolivar (US$62.89 million) sale of three-year
notes may be limited to small domestic investors if demand is
sufficiently strong.
<p>
   The notes, which will go on sale in late February, will mark the
first time that Venezuela's state oil company has given small
domestic investors the opportunity to invest in its projects.
<p>
   The sale will take place over three weeks, with half of the
issue initially reserved for domestic investors, who will be
allowed to purchase up to 1 million bolivars worth of notes each.
The proportion earmarked for small investors may be increased if
demand merits it.
<p>
   ``Depending on how we see the appetite in the first week, it may
be extended to some $60 million,'' or practically the entire issue,
said Luis Giusti, PDVSA president.
<p>
   Larger domestic private and institutional investors will be
offered the remainder of the notes after the first week. Foreign
investors are excluded, although they may be allowed to buy
subsequent debt instruments or shares.
<p>
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to partially finance the
building of a plastics plant.
<p>
   The notes will have a floating interest rate, paid quarterly.
The coupon will be set between the rates carried by three-month
certificates of deposit and 90-day commercial paper. They will also
have a quarterly option to sell.
<p>
   Co-leaders of the sale are Citibank Mercado de Capitales and the
Valores Vencred SA.
<p>
   PDVSA is selling the notes through a specially created unit, the
Petroleum Investment Fund, or SOFIP. The fund is expected to sell
bonds and shares to finance future oil and petrochemical projects.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said it
will start a mutual fund ``supermarket'' in March, in a bid to give
its clients a greater selection of mutual funds to buy.
<p>
   The nation's biggest brokerage firm joins a number of other
mutual fund companies and brokerages in offering a supermarket
product. These typically offer customers the chance to buy a number
of different mutual funds managed by different companies.
<p>
   ``The strategy is to give the client more choices,'' said Arthur
Urciuoli, senior vice president in Merrill's private client group.
<p>
   The Merrill lynch fund supermarket will give customers a choice
of 1,100 different mutual funds, including 110 managed by Merrill
Lynch. The supermarket will offer both load and no-load mutual
funds. Investors don't pay a sales charge when they buy a no-load
fund.
<p>
   Charles Schwab Corp. offered the first fund supermarket in 1992,
called OneSource, which now handles some $39 billion. OneSource's
success spawned several imitations, including products from Quick &AMP;
Reilly Inc., Smith Barney and Fidelity Investments.
<p>
   The move follows Merrill's introduction of a program called
Merrill Lynch Financial Advantage Service, which offers U.S.
clients securities trading, mutual funds and financial planning for
one annual fee.
<p>
   Clients who use the program won't pay brokerage commissions for
a limited number of trades and will get financial advice and price
reductions on other services such as margin loans and mortgages.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co.
said fourth-quarter earnings rose 28 percent as rising income from
managing clients' money and from penalties charged to credit card
customers overcame credit card losses.
<p>
   The company, which owns broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and
issues the Discover credit card, said net income rose to $227.8
million, or 68 cents a share, from $178.1 million, or 51 cents, a
year earlier.
<p>
   The earnings beat the average estimate of 65 cents a share of
eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research Inc. Dean
Witter rose 7/8 to 38 on trading of 880,300 shares, more than the
three-month daily average of 692,300.
<p>
   ``The earnings were very strong,'' said analyst Michael
Freudenstein, who follows financial companies for J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
``Each of their lines of business performed well.''
<p>
   Net income at Dean Witter Reynolds, the third-largest U.S.
securities firm in terms of brokers, rose 8.8 percent to $126
million from $115.8 million a year earlier, an increase of 5.9
percent from the third quarter.
<p>
   Asset management and administration fees, which increased 16
percent to $299.3 million, led the securities unit's performance.
Investment banking revenue jumped 60 percent to $78.1 million amid
a rally in the stock and bond markets.
<p>
   ``We continued to achieve rapid growth in assets under
management,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Philip J. Purcell said
in a statement.
<p>
   Assets under management and administration rose 13 percent to
$90 billion from the year-ago period. Trading revenue declined 1.9
percent to $108.9 million.
<p>
   Net operating revenue at the securities unit rose 11 percent to
$879 million.
<p>
   In December, Dean Witter announced an agreement to buy Lombard
Securities, an on-line brokerage based in San Francisco.
<p>
   Discover card earnings rose 63 percent to $101.8 million from
$62.3 million a year earlier. The rise came even as the company
increased its provisions for loan losses by 53 percent to $636
million.
<p>
   ``Revenues from their credit card services were very high,''
said analyst Mark Alpert at Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons Inc. ``They priced a
lot of their accounts in terms of annual percentage rates and late
fees, which more than offset the rise in write-offs.''
<p>
   Merchant and cardmember fees, on a managed loan basis, rose 48
percent to a record $563.8 million from a year earlier, boosted by
higher transaction volume.
<p>
   The firm increased the penalties it charges for late payments
and spending over credit limits, a spokeswoman said.
<p>
   The loss, or net charge-off, rate for managed loans in credit
services rose to 6 percent from 4.4 percent in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   ``Our fourth-quarter results were exceptionally strong given the
industry-wide trend of higher credit card write-offs,'' said
Purcell.
<p>
   Discover net operating revenue rose 14 percent to $735.9
million.
<p>
   For the full year, Dean Witter Discover net income rose 11
percent to $951.4 million, or $2.79 a share, from $856.4 million,
or $2.44 in 1995.
<p>
   Total expenses, excluding interest, increased 9.8 percent to
$1.25 billion, led by a 13 percent rise in payroll costs.
<p>
   Compensation expenses rose 13 percent to $427.1 million at Dean
Witter Reynolds and rose 11 percent to $132.1 million at the credit
card unit.
<p>
   Marketing and business development expenses also contributed to
increased costs, advancing 13 percent to $253.6 million for the
company as a whole. They rose 89 percent to $43 million at the
brokerage unit and rose 5 percent to $210.8 million at the credit
card division.

   Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Texas stocks fell for the third
straight trading day as Cliffs Drilling Co., Energy Ventures Inc.
and other oil-related stocks continued their retreat from recent
highs.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Texas Index fell 1.06 to 163.02, its lowest level
in almost two weeks. The index is a price-weighted list of stocks
in companies with significant operations in Texas that is designed
to reflect the performance of the state's economy.
<p>
   Oil service stocks fell after reporting sharp gains in the first
two weeks of the year, with the decline triggered in part by
falling natural gas prices.
<p>
   ``Nearly every company that has reported earnings so far has met
or exceeded expectations,'' said James Stone, a Schroder Wertheim &AMP;
Co. analyst. ``We don't see any weakening of (industry)
fundamentals here.'' Houston-based Cliffs Drilling fell 5 1/64 to
65, Energy Ventures was down 4 1/8 at 57 7/8, Seitel Inc. fell 3
1/2 to 32 7/8, BJ Services Inc. fell 3 3/8 to 47 5/8, and United
Meridian Corp. fell 2 5/8 to 37 1/8.
<p>
   Texas stocks underperformed the national average, falling 0.64
percent compared with a gain of 0.45 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index, which rose 3.51C to 786.2.
<p>
   Computer-related shares rose after Houston-based Compaq Computer
Corp. reported fourth-quarter earnings far exceeded Wall Street
estimates. Compaq rose 5 to 83 1/2, Irving-based I2 Technologies
Inc. rose 4 3/4 to 41 3/8, and Austin-based Dell Computer Corp.
rose 2 5/8 to 66 3/4.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. and Netscape
Communications Corp. received the best reviews from corporate
computer buyers in a survey by Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co.
<p>
   Computer Associates International Inc. and Digital Equipment
Corp. finished last among the 12 hardware and software companies on
which Morgan Stanley sought a ``thumbs up/thumbs down'' performance
appraisal.
<p>
   Cisco, a San Jose, California-based maker of networking
equipment, scored highest, praised by 92 percent of the 50
respondents. Netscape, a Mountain View, California-based maker of
Internet software, won praise from 91 percent of buyers.
<p>
   Islandia, New York-based Computer Associates, a software maker,
and Maynard, Massachusetts-based Digital, the nation's
third-largest computer company, each got a ``thumbs up'' from 28
percent of the respondents. The rest gave them a ``thumbs down.''
<p>
   The results of the survey indicate that corporate buyers want to
do business with fewer computer companies, and with those companies
able to solve computer problems across organizations, said Morgan
Stanley analyst Steven Milunovich. ``Customers want fewer vendors,
and more services and solutions from each,'' Milunovich said.
<p>
   International Business Machines Corp. ranked first among the
companies cited as the best ``solution providers,'' followed by
Microsoft Corp.
<p>
   Corporate buyers cited IBM for its understanding of their needs
and its complete package of products and services, according to the
report.
<p>
   Digital won high marks for its products, yet respondents
criticized its sales force and strategy as lacking focus, the
report said.
<p>
   ``It's hard to get excited about the Digital story when user
apathy offsets the company's outstanding technology,'' Milunovich
said.

   Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Texas stocks fell for the third
straight trading day as Cliffs Drilling Co., Energy Ventures Inc.
and other oil-related stocks continued their retreat from recent
highs.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Texas Index fell 1.06 to 163.02, its lowest level
in almost two weeks. The index is a price-weighted list of stocks
in companies with significant operations in Texas that is designed
to reflect the performance of the state's economy.
<p>
   Oil service stocks fell after reporting sharp gains in the first
two weeks of the year, with the decline triggered in part by
falling natural gas prices.
<p>
   ``Nearly every company that has reported earnings so far has met
or exceeded expectations,'' said James Stone, a Schroder Wertheim &AMP;
Co. analyst. ``We don't see any weakening of (industry)
fundamentals here.'' Houston-based Cliffs Drilling fell 5 1/64 to
65, Energy Ventures was down 4 1/8 at 57 7/8, Seitel Inc. fell 3
1/2 to 32 7/8, BJ Services Inc. fell 3 3/8 to 47 5/8, and United
Meridian Corp. fell 2 5/8 to 37 1/8. +~ Texas stocks underperformed
the national average, falling 0.64 percent compared with a gain of
0.45 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which rose 3.51C
to 786.2.
<p>
   Computer-related shares rose after Houston-based Compaq Computer
Corp. reported fourth-quarter earnings far exceeded Wall Street
estimates. Compaq rose 5 to 83 1/2, Irving-based I2 Technologies
Inc. rose 4 3/4 to 41 3/8, and Austin-based Dell Computer Corp.
rose 2 5/8 to 66 3/4.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
<p>
   Locally heavy rains will douse the Gulf Coast states Thursday as
moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico is forced to rise
over a stalling cold front. A jet stream disturbance pressing east
will augment the lifting of moist air, setting the stage for some
heavy showers and thunderstorms over east Texas. A few of the
storms may reach severe levels, with large hail and tornadoes
possible in spots. Showers and storms will spread into Louisiana
and Mississippi late in the day or at night.
<p>
   Meanwhile, pockets of moderately heavy snow will fall on
west-facing slopes of the Rockies early Thursday as moist Pacific
air is forced to rise up the sloping terrain. Snow will taper off
over the mountains of Utah and western Colorado on Thursday
afternoon.
<p>
   Arctic air will return to northwest New England in the wake of a
low pressure system heading northeast into the Labrador Sea. The
leading edge of Arctic air will be accompanied by a band of snow
showers from the Adirondacks of upstate New York to the Longfellow
Mountains of northern Maine.
<p>
   Broken areas of light snow will spread across portions of the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley as relatively mild air
from the south is forced to rise over a cold air dome of air near
the ground.
<p>
   Coastal showers and patchy mountain snows will develop in
western Washington and western Oregon as a jet stream disturbance
from British Columbia interacts with Pacific moisture. Farther
south, clouds will decrease over southern California.
<p>
   FOCUS: Arctic Sunrise
<p>
   At Barrow, Alaska, the relentless darkness of the Arctic night
has ended. The sun rose at 1:25 p.m. Wednesday, after having been
below the horizon since November 18. It set 29 minutes later. Now
the amount of possible sunshine increases at least nine minutes
each day. By May 10, the nation's northernmost town will be in
constant sunshine until late August. This Arctic sunrise is the
beginning of a slow steady process that modifies bitter air masses.
As the rest of the United States reaches a mid-winter ebb, the
brightening Barrow skies are the first true sign of spring.

<p>
   Brussels, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The European Commission, as
expected, approved Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s 1.2 billion-pound
($2 billion) purchase of Britain's largest bottler, dismissing
complaints by Virgin Group Ltd. that it would stifle competition.
<p>
   The commission, the executive agency of the European Union, said
it didn't have enough evidence that the purchase by Coca-Cola Co.'s
largest bottler had done anything to change a competitive landscape
in which Coke already has more than 60 percent of the British cola
market.
<p>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, a separately traded company 44.8 percent
owned by Coke, agreed in June to buy Coca-Cola Schweppes Bottling
Ltd. The joint venture was formed by Coke and Cadbury Schweppes Plc
in 1987, with Coke holding 49 percent.
<p>
   EU officials expressed some reservations about the purchase,
calling it a ``borderline'' antitrust case.
<p>
   ``I can assure you we will continue to monitor closely'' the
purchase's effect on the U.K. beverage industry, said Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert. ``We had a lot of concerns but at the
end of the day the conclusion was that we didn't have enough legal
evidence to support that.''
<p>
   The commission said the bottler has agreed not to force
retailers to stock only its colas or to tie rebates to long-term
purchases. That addresses ``at least some of the concerns'' raised
by Richard Branson's Virgin and smaller rivals, it said.
<p>
   The commission is also continuing a separate inquiry into some
licensing arrangements for some Cadbury Schweppes brands.
<p>
   ``They're essentially saying they're going to watch Coke like a
hawk,'' said Nick Cookbridge, Virgin Cola's marketing director.
<p>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Chief Executive Summerfield Johnston Jr.
said the U.K. bottler would be integrated quickly into its other
operations in Europe once the acquisition is completed in the next
several weeks. After the acquisition, Europe will account for 28
percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises' shipments, up from 5 percent in
1995. It already bottles Coke beverages in the Netherlands, Belgium
and most of France.
<p>
   A company spokeswoman did not rule out more acquisitions.
<p>
   ``We are always interested in contiguous properties or
properties where we can add shareholder value,'' said Laura Asman
of Coca-Cola Enterprises.
<p>
   The Atlanta-based bottler's shares rose 5/8 to 55 1/2.
<p>
   Virgin and other smaller rivals had complained that the purchase
would restrict their access to the U.K. cola market. Virgin said
the market share of its 2-year-old Virgin Cola brand had been more
than halved because of the Coke-Cadbury bottler's dominance of the
market.
<p>
   The bottler distributes all Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes
products in the U.K., from Coke to Cadbury's Dr Pepper and Sunkist
brands. The commission estimates the bottler's share of the U.K.
cola market is triple that of its nearest rival, Britvic Ltd.,
which bottles Pepsi products.
<p>
   American depository receipts of Cadbury rose 1/8 to 33 1/4. The
London-based candy and soft drinks maker has said it will get about
622.5 million pounds ($1.1 billion) from selling its 51 percent
stake in the bottler, halving its net debt and freeing up cash for
investments. The commission's green light was expected after
members of an antitrust advisory committee voted to approve the
purchase earlier this month.

<p>
   Atlanta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The television commercial touts
the virtues of a fast new model: Lots of leg room, great mileage --
with room for 300 and the ability to fly from New York to Paris
nonstop.
<p>
   Airbus Industrie is betting that out of millions of viewers a
select few will want its A330 jetliner. And at $110 million each, a
few buyers is all the European planemaker needs.
<p>
   The ads are aimed at just two prospects -- Arlington,
Virginia-based USAir Group Inc. and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines,
both of which are shopping for new jetliners. Airbus says spending
thousands of dollars on TV ads is part of what it takes to beat
archrival Boeing Co.
<p>
   ``It tells the airline that we really want their business,''
said Dave Venz, Airbus's North American vice president for
communications.
<p>
   Venz said the ads work. When Airbus's sales team visited Delta
in December, he said, the Delta people mentioned that they'd seen
the ads on the morning news.
<p>
   The commercials highlight the spaciousness of the A330's
business-class section. In one spot, a diminutive businessman is
squeezed in a middle seat between two giant men, and repeatedly has
to climb over them to get to the aisle. The narrator points out
that this wouldn't happen on an Airbus plane, which has no middle
seats in business class.
<p>
   ``Airbus doesn't expect Joe Blow to get up in the middle of
`Seinfeld' and order an A330,'' said Michael Boyd, president of
Aviation Research Consultants in Golden, Colorado. ``Airbus is
really hoping that the handful of Delta executives who will decide
(which planes to buy) are tuning in.''
<p>
   Buying TV time is new for Airbus, which is trying to woo U.S.
airlines away from Boeing. Delta, the third-largest U.S. carrier,
is considering buying Airbus's A330 or Boeing's 777 or 767 models.
All are large, twin-engine airplanes designed for cross-country or
transatlantic flights.
<p>
   USAir, meanwhile, has tentatively agreed to buy 120 Airbus
jetliners for about $5 billion, which would be one of the biggest
orders ever for Airbus. Airbus, a consortium of manufacturers from
Germany, France, Spain and the U.K., is doing everything it can to
make the order firm.
<p>
   Airbus's TV campaign is unusual because it's aimed at airlines.
While aircraft makers do advertise, they usually do so in business
publications read by decision makers.
<p>
   Boeing, though, has turned to TV ads in the past. For example
during the Persian Gulf War, when air travel plunged, Boeing ran
ads extolling the benefits of flying.
<p>
   Boeing also ran TV ads in the late 1960s, when it introduced its
massive 747. The ads featured the Harlem Globetrotters basketball
team clowning inside its expansive cabin. That ad was designed to
get people accustomed to such an enormous plane.
<p>
   Winning aircraft orders with mass-market advertising doesn't
have a very promising record. British Aerospace, for example, once
posted a huge billboard outside the Texas headquarters of American
Airlines' parent, AMR Corp. The manufacturer didn't get an order.
<p>
   And marketing executives say that TV advertising -- each spot
costs a minimum of $100,000 to produce -- is a costly way to
compete for a contract.
<p>
   ``This isn't a cheap form of advertising,'' said Dave Capano,
media director of Tausche, Martin &AMP; Lonsdorf, an Atlanta
advertising agency.
<p>
   Yet, there are sound reasons to use TV.
<p>
   ``This gets the manufacturer's name out there,'' Capano said.
``If they do win the contract, consumers will know and favor
them.''
<p>
   That can be important to some travelers. UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines says many passengers ask to fly Boeing's new 777, the
first time in recent memory that consumers say they want to travel
on a specific aircraft. That's the kind of cache a jet manufacturer
dreams about in a world where travelers usually hunt for cheap
fares and little else.
<p>
   Airbus wouldn't say how much it spent on the ads, which were
produced by Euro RSCG-WNK-Gosper in London. The ads, which ran last
month in Washington, Atlanta and Pittsburgh, also ran in Europe and
Asia in October and November. Airbus is planning to run more ads in
the U.S. soon.
<p>
   Local 30-second ad spots in the Atlanta market cost $4,000 to
$6,000 and as much as $10,000 for a top-rated show, media experts
in the area say.
<p>
   ``If this is what the public sees,'' said Boyd at Aviation
Research, ``imagine the wining and dining going on behind the
scenes.''

   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Washington. D.C.-area stocks
rose today, led by the shares of NationsBank Corp. and First
Virginia Banks Inc.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Washington Area Stock Index rose 0.91, or 0.5
percent, to 174.63. Of the 186 stocks in the price-weighted index,
67 rose, 55 were unchanged, and 64 fell.
<p>
   So far this year the index has risen 6.5 percent.
<p>
   Created in December 1994 with a value of 100, the index is
designed to measure the Washington area economy by reflecting the
moves of the stocks of Washington's largest publicly-traded
companies.
<p>
   The stock of Charlotte, North Carolina's NationsBank, which
operates an extensive branch network in the Washington area, rose 2
3/4 to 109 1/2, as 1.5 million shares were traded.
<p>
   That stock's three-month average daily volume is 1 million
shares.
<p>
   This morning, the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and
Chief Executive Hugh McColl said NationsBank believes its strong
earnings performance will continue.
<p>
   Last week, the company said its fourth-quarter net income rose
24 percent to $632 million, or $2.19 a share, beating the $2.13 a
share consensus estimate from 27 analysts surveyed by Zacks
Investment Research.
<p>
   The stock of Falls Church, Virginia's First Virginia Banks rose
2 5/8 to 52 1/2, on trading of 86,000 shares. The stock's average
daily volume is 26,664 shares.
<p>
   Yesterday, the bank holding company said its fourth-quarter net
income rose 12 percent to $30.8 million, or 94 cents a share, from
$27.6 million, or 81 cents, in 1995's fourth quarter.
<p>
   Among the stocks that fell today was Richmond, Virginia's
Reynolds Metals Co. That stock fell 2 1/8 to 62 3/4 a day after the
stock closed at its 52-week high of 64 7/8.
<p>
   The Washington Area index outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which fell 33.87 to 6850.03, while lagging the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, which rose 3.51 to 786.23, and the Nasdaq Combined
Composite, which rose 11.09 to 1388.06.

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- It's 7 a.m. and for Mercury
Trading's option dealers the next 7 1/2 hours will determine
whether the firm's $121,000 investment is lost or becomes worth
millions of dollars.
<p>
   It's expiration day on the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
world's largest options trading arena, a climax reached the third
Friday of each month in which thousands of stock and index options
are exercised for stock, or expire worthless. The activity creates
a chaos that can make an already volatile U.S. stock market
apoplectic. For Mercury chairman Jon Najarian, a 38-year-old former
Chicago Bears linebacker, this chaos is a way of life.
<p>
   Doug Cliggott, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.'s chief stock strategist, in
New York, has never traded an option in his life. Still, he keeps
an watchful eye on what's going on in the options market because it
signals what investors are expecting in the months ahead.
<p>
   ``Right now, many people are nervous and they are looking for
insurance,'' said Cliggott, referring to growing demand for options
that guarantee investors a fixed selling price for their
portfolios. He said the options market is useful because it
indicates how apprehensive or optimistic investors are about the
market.
<p>
   Currently, some measures are predicting the most volatile year
for U.S. stocks since 1990. Demand for options to sell the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 at a fixed price, which are known as ``puts'' and
allow an investor to lock in a minimum selling price as insurance
against market drops, is near its highest in 12 months.
<p>
   Options give an investor the right, but not the obligation to
buy or sell a company's stock or an index at a set price before a
certain date. An option price reflects expectations for volatility,
the duration of the contract, its price relative to the price of
its underlying security, interest rates and the expected dividend
from the underlying stock.
<p>
   If the price is rising for an option that expires at the current
price of the underlying security with no expected changes in
interest rates or dividends, it is an indication investors are
expecting bigger market or industry swings. That's what's happening
now.
<p>
   ``People are expecting a choppy market and they are expecting a
market that could spike down,'' said Michael Kelly, co-head of
derivative research at J.P. Morgan. Options to buy and sell the S&AMP;P
500 Index in the months ahead are being priced as if S&AMP;P 500 has a
66 percent chance of swinging almost 18 percent up or down, with a
bias for a decline.
<p>
   ``The skew to the down side is a combination of people that
remember the big crashes and increasing skepticism of a market at
record highs,'' said Najarian, whose pony-tailed head and 210-pound
frame make him look like a balding Steven Segal.
<p>
   Coming out of the longest bull market ever, a swing even half
the size of the one investors are paying for on the S&AMP;P 500 could
be unsettling for people who have come to expect a stock market
that rises with little deviation. The S&AMP;P is up 68 percent since
the end of 1994 and hasn't dropped more than 10 percent since 1990.
<p>
   ``A lot of investors have been spoiled,'' said Richard Jandrain,
director of equities for Banc One Investment Advisors with $39
billion in assets. ``With volatility on the rise it could scare
away some of the money we have seen coming in and hurt the
market.'' Some $730 billion has been invested in U.S. markets
during the past six years with $223 billion coming in 1996 alone.
<p>
   Volatility is a good thing for people like Najarian since the
more the stock market moves, the more investors seek protection
from or look to take advantage of market swings by trading options.
<p>
   For the typical options trader, handling this business produces
an annual income of at least $200,000, and in a good year millions.
The traders are predominantly men in their late 20's and 30's, with
educational backgrounds ranging from high school dropouts, to
Ph.D.'s. Their common tie is a quickness with numbers, an affinity
for risk and an aversion to three-piece suits -- floor attire
ranges from casual and to bizarre.
<p>
   Najarian got his start in 1981 when his sports agent offered him
a job as a runner on the CBOE after he was cut by the Bears after
four pre-season games. He traded for eight years for himself and
others, then started his own firm. It has grown to employ 27
traders on three exchanges.
<p>
   This morning at the daily strategy meeting in Mercury's office
on the 15th floor of the CBOE building, the atmosphere is relaxed
as Najarian reviews the position each of his traders has in their
respective options. The traders, meanwhile, exchange playful verbal
jabs at each other under the watchful eye of a Beavis and Butt-Head
poster.
<p>
   Later, at the opening bell on the exchange floor, Najarian's
Informix trader, Donny Hough, is bouncing up and down on his toes
packed in a crowd of more than 30 traders. The noise is deafening.
<p>
   Hough's are intensely focused on the price screens mounted
overhead. His objective is to sell Informix stock to replace his
expiring options when the shares rise or sell the stocks when it
drops. Today the shares are rising, and Hough is selling. By midday
he has made a $94,000 profit. Yet, he still has $48,000 worth of
options that will be worthless at 3:10 p.m. central time when the
market closes.
<p>
   ``The only people that can read a market like this are
schizophrenics,'' says Najarian, referring to the need to be able
to profit from sharp market upswings and downturns alike. His firm,
Mercury Trading, named for the Roman god of commerce and guardian
of traders, is responsible for making markets in options for 48
companies including Micron Technology Inc., CompUSA Inc. and
Informix Corp.
<p>
   Mercury is one of 21 Designated Primary Market Makers, or DPM's,
on the Chicago Board Options Exchange with responsibility for
maintaining a fair, orderly market on the floor. About 60 percent
of all options traded in the U.S. change hands on the CBOE,
including 93 percent of all U.S. index options.
<p>
   Work as a DPM can be very lucrative, with income ranging from
break-even for a DPM in their first year to take home pay in excess
of $10 million for an established market maker like Najarian.
<p>
   Costs are also high, the latest price for a seat on the CBOE was
$555,000 up from $330,000 two years ago. Seats, which entitle an
individual to trade can also be leased for about $7,500 a month.
Overall, costs exceed $10,000 a month for each trader. Mercury owns
two seats and leases 12 more.
<p>
   Last night computer chip-maker VLSI Technology Inc. reported
less-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and Mercury's Bill Ray,
who makes a market in the options is frantically exercising his
right to sell the tumbling shares at 22 1/2, capturing $5 in profit
with every trade, or $500,000 so far. What Ray expected to be a
non-event has become his most profitable trade in months. ``I'm
surprised and delighted,'' he said. ``We didn't see this coming.''
<p>
   One indication that Cliggott, Jandrain and other Wall Street
strategists monitor is the put-to-call ratio, or the number of
contracts for ``puts'' which allow an investor to sell a stock or
index at a set price vs. the number of investors buying ``calls,''
or the right to buy at a set price by a set date.
<p>
   Puts are generally purchased as a bet that a security's price
will fall while a call is a bet that it will rise. The ratio
doubled last week as investors bought two puts for every call --
indicating that expectations of a market drop were rising.
<p>
   Some market strategists, including Jandrain, consider a rising
put-to-call ratio to be a bullish sign, viewing it as a contrarian
indicator on the theory that the people buying puts tend to be
smaller investors and are therefore less sophisticated, and more
likely to be wrong.
<p>
   ``The options market has predicted 15 of the last two
recessions,'' Cliggott said. ``But at least it predicts them.''
<p>
   By midday, Najarian's traders have locked in all the profit they
are going take from a rising market and the $121,000 risk has been
reduced to about $6,000. Profits meanwhile are in excess of
$600,000 most of which came compliments of a tumbling VLSI.
<p>
   Last year was the best ever for the equity options market with
199 million contracts changing hands, breaking the record 174
million contracts traded in 1995 -- the first year equity option
volume exceeded the previous record of 164 million contracts in
1987.
<p>
   By the end of trading today, Mercury traders have returned to
their offices to calculate their losses and gains. The tally for
today: a profit of $775,000.

<p>
   Armonk, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- International Business
Machines Corp.'s stock dropped 5.9 percent as investors worried
that lagging sales of its mainframes and related products will hurt
profits in coming quarters.
<p>
   IBM's stock fell 10 to 158 in the wake of fourth-quarter
earnings and sales that trailed expectations. Without IBM's drop,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have set another record.
<p>
   IBM shares had surged to nine-year highs on optimism for strong
growth in all its businesses. The company said late yesterday that
sales of computer hardware edged up just 2 percent as corporations
bought networks of personal computers rather than IBM's hallmark
mainframes.
<p>
   IBM also joined Computer Associates International Inc. and
Oracle Corp. in blaming dismal sales in Europe for disappointing
results.
<p>
   ``The revenue growth story is not real strong at IBM,'' said
John Rutledge, an analyst at Boston's Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ``The
bloom is off the rose.''
<p>
   IBM's earnings were slightly below the average estimate of $3.96
a share from 15 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
Several analysts expected earnings of more than $4.00.
<p>
   Net income rose to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, from $1.71
billion, or $3.09, in the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   At least four analysts cut their estimates for IBM's 1997
earnings and at least two cut 1998 estimates. John Jones at Salomon
Brothers downgraded his recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from
``strong buy'' and Donald Young at Prudential Securities downgraded
the rating to ``hold'' from ``buy.''
<p>
   Others expressed concern that IBM's stock price will decline
substantially over the next few months. IBM's shares reached 168
yesterday, shy of the all-time high of 174 3/4 set in August 1987.
<p>
   ``Given that the stock has run up, we're probably going to see
the beginning'' of a decline, said Morgan Stanley analyst Steven
Milunovich. The drop could be as much as 15 percent in the next
three to five months, he said.
<p>
   IBM's not alone in reporting disappointing sales in Europe.
<p>
   European companies are spending less than half the amount that
U.S. and Asian firms spend on technology. That, coupled with weak
economies in some countries, will continue to hurt computer and
software companies, analysts said.
<p>
   Oracle said last month that weakness in Europe hurt its results,
and Computer Associates said yesterday that European sales fell 21
percent. IBM's sales in Europe were unchanged from a year ago at
$8.1 billion.
<p>
   Hardware is IBM's biggest business, accounting for 48 percent of
total sales last year.
<p>
   IBM unveiled new mainframes this fall. Even so, its hardware
sales rose just 2 percent to $11.7 billion. System 390 mainframe
sales declined and RS/6000 workstation sales were unchanged from
year-earlier levels.
<p>
   Software sales, nearly three-quarters of which are related to
mainframe sales, rose only 4 percent. And maintenance revenue from
contracts to service and maintain the big computers fell 6 percent
as more companies turn to cheaper and easier-to-operate PCs and
powerful servers to deliver information over networks.
<p>
   IBM's PC sales rose from the year-earlier quarter in both
corporate products and home machines.
<p>
   Sales at IBM Microelectronics, the company's chip business,
dropped from the year-earlier period, largely because of falling
prices for dynamic random-access memory chips.
<p>
   IBM's gross margin fell to 40.3 percent from 41.7 percent in the
year-earlier quarter, and IBM expects it to fall another percentage
point in 1997 as prices decline and the mix of more profitable
products is lower.
<p>
   Also, the stronger dollar cost the company 18 cents in per-share
earnings during the quarter. When the dollar is stronger, it is
more expensive to buy dollars with foreign currencies.
<p>
   IBM said yesterday that currency will continue to be a ``wild
card.'' IBM gets more than 60 percent of its sales from outside the
U.S.

   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan shares fell for a
second session in light trading amid concern that future corporate
earnings don't justify current stock prices.
<p>
   Investors are also concerned about a possible strike at Cia.
Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, the national phone
company.
<p>
   ``There is some concern about the strikes but I think they will
be settled,'' said William Boulton, a trader with Bancaracas Casa
de Bolsa.
<p>
   The Caracas Stock Exchange's general index fell 36.90 points, or
0.6 percent, to 6328.47. The financial index fell 106.14 points, or
1.2 percent, to 8531.24, while the industrial index fell 16.40
points, or 0.3 percent, to 5676.42.
<p>
   Domestic investors sold shares on concern that a December rally
of more than 20 percent pushed prices of some shares to a level
that isn't warranted by their potential future earnings.
<p>
   At CANTV, the national phone company, workers are scheduled to
take a strike vote this afternoon. Workers are demanding a
140-percent raise, while the company is offering 20 percent.
<p>
   Workers are scheduled to vote later this afternoon on whether to
strike. CANTV has had repeated labor disputes since a group led by
GTE Corp. purchased 40 percent of the company in 1991.
<p>
   Benchmark CANTV fell 5 bolivars, or 0.3 percent, to 1,925
bolivars (US$4.04).
<p>
   Twenty-nine stocks fell, eight stocks rose, and 11 stocks closed
unchanged among shares that traded.
<p>
   Banco Provincial fell 0.50 bolivars, or 0.1 percent, to 819.50
bolivars, CA Electricidad de Caracas rose 4.50 bolivars, or 0.9
percent, to 485.50 bolivars, and Mantex SACA fell 0.25 bolivars, or
0.6 percent, to 40.25 bolivars.
<p>
   Also, Mavesa SA fell 0.50 bolivars, or 0.3 percent, to 157
bolivars, Siderurgica Venezolana Sivensa Class A fell 4 bolivars,
or 1.3 percent, to 315 bolivars, and Vencemos Type 1 shares fell 20
bolivars, or 1.6 percent, to 1,230 bolivars.
<p>
   Volume totaled 35.20 million shares worth 2.49 billion bolivars,
below this year's average daily volume of 3.49 billion bolivars.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Paranoia and cultural disorientation are the staple ingredients
of Diane Johnson's fiction (``The Shadow Knows,'' ``Persian
Nights,'' ``Health and Happiness,'' among other books).
<p>
   She mixes them well in her latest novel, ``Le Divorce,'' the
events of which are set off when Roxeanne de Persand, a Californian
living in Paris, learns that her French husband is leaving her
shortly after having gotten her pregnant with their second child.
<p>
   Although the husband, Charles-Henri, takes up with another woman
and asks for a divorce, the couple's respective parents try to keep
up cordial relations in the interests of their grandchildren. The
strain of their effort will produce both comedy and catastrophe, as
well as an acute portrait of French-American cultural conflict.
<p>
   The story is narrated by Roxy's stepsister, Isabel Walker, a
film-school dropout who is good at describing scenes but doesn't
always catch on to what they're really about. Isabel has been sent
to Paris from Santa Barbara to keep an eye on Roxy and baby-sit her
3-year-old during the pregnancy.
<p>
   Although Isabel does her duty, she also amuses herself. She
takes on a series of odd jobs with members of Paris' American
community. And she starts an affair with Charles-Henri's elderly
uncle, Edgar Cosset, formerly a member of the Chamber of Deputies
and still an influential voice on the French national scene.
<p>
   Considered the beautiful but dumb kid sister, Isabel is avid to
improve herself, endlessly inquisitive about French manners and
full of shrewd instincts. Before taking up with Uncle Edgar she
refines her pickup technique: ``If I do up my hair and wear my
glasses, the men will be subtly more prosperous-looking  &MD;  smooth
businessmen and visiting Germans. If I wear a scarf around my neck,
I will be taken for a French girl. Scarf, no scarf, hair up or
down. Thus, controlling my destiny, I made the acquaintance of two
attractive men ...''
<p>
   But among the points she misses in her pursuits are, first, that
she has become the instrument of an ``intricate scam'' involving
one of her employers; second, that her role in Uncle Edgar's life
is not what she thinks, and, third, that Roxy has grown so
depressed about her divorce that she has decided to slash her
wrists.
<p>
   One catalyst of Ms. Johnson's story is an old painting of St.
Ursula, the virgin martyr, in Roxy's living room that she got from
her stepfather (Isabel's father) and gave to her husband as a
wedding present. Once thought to be worthless, the painting has
lately attracted interest as possibly being the work of a student
of Georges de La Tour, and has even been requested for an
exhibition loan by the Getty Museum.
<p>
   While Charles-Henri has renounced the painting in his divorce
request, his family politely suggests that perhaps it ought not be
sent to the Getty until the divorce is resolved. ``It is a French
picture, after all,'' says Charles-Henri's mother when Isabel
appeals to her on Roxy's behalf. As estimates of the painting's
true value rise (it may even have been done by La Tour himself!),
so, too, does the covetousness of family members on both sides.
<p>
   Eventually, when valuation of the painting goes above $40,000,
Isabel pleads with Uncle Edgar, pointing out ``the total wickedness
of the Persands' ignoring that it was in our family, that it
belongs to more people than Roxy, that it means a lot to us and
nothing to them, and so on.''
<p>
   Edgar responds. `` `We are not going to quarrel, you and I,
cherie, about Roxeanne's canape and an ugly saint.' ''
<p>
   `` `You'll talk about sex but not about money,' I objected.''
<p>
   `` `Of course  &MD;  I am French,' he said. `You Americans are always
getting everything backward.' ''
<p>
   As the tension mounts, more and more people get things backward
until the plot veers into melodrama that seems a bit outsize for
the scale of the events that lead to it. The novel's other minor
flaws are too many loose ends and too many false portents, although
these may be a part of the paranoia that prevails when two cultures
misunderstand each other.
<p>
   Where Ms. Johnson never loses her touch is in tracking Isabel's
romance with the French. At a crucial point in the story she finds
that her relentless study of the language has finally paid off: ``I
understood what people were saying in the Metro.''
<p>
   She continues: ``Later, when I had time to think about it, I
would wonder if it was worthwhile understanding after all. Maybe it
is better to go along in soundproof isolation? It was something of
a disappointment to discover that all those words, so alluringly
expressed in dramatic, unintelligible and unreproducible sounds,
organized themselves into banalities one might hear on the bus in
Santa Barbara (if one took buses there). But the pleasure of being
in on it, at last, initiated, thrilled me all the same. From then
on I eavesdropped like a spy.''
<p>
   She eavesdrops like a spy and penetrates the culture more and
more deeply. But the question posed so wittily by ``Le Divorce'' is
whether Isabel is listening to banalities or embodying them. Is she
an American spy or a French one? Early in her affair with Uncle
Edgar, she wonders, ``Am I impeded by my crude, direct sexuality
from interesting a sophisticated, nuanced lover?'' Her eagerness to
connect leaves one to wonder, in her search for an identity, which
culture has Isabel finally divorced?

   PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice, into the

<p>
   Every day it becomes clearer that the peace accord ending the
war in former Yugoslavia was actually a historically familiar
scheme  &MD;  a so-called peace accord that is in fact a partition
agreement.
<p>
   As such the Bosnian war and the Dayton peace agreement have
reignited a debate on whether partition is an effective solution to
ethnic conflict.
<p>
   Defenders of partition argue that when an ethnic war is far
advanced, partition is probably the most humane form of
intervention because it attempts to achieve through negotiation
what would otherwise be achieved through fighting. It circumvents
the conflict, they say, and saves lives.
<p>
   It might even save a country from disappearing altogether
because an impartial intervenor will attempt to secure the rights
of each contending ethnic group, whereas in war the stronger groups
might oust the weaker ones.
<p>
   In fact, advocates say, the ideal strategy for resolving an
ethnic conflict is to intervene and take partition to its logical
conclusion by dividing a country along its battle lines and helping
make the resulting territories ethnically homogeneous through
organized population transfers.
<p>
   Supposedly this will ensure that partition is more than a
temporary means of containing conflict.
<p>
   But partition has its own sordid history, not arising as a means
of realizing national self-determination, but imposed as a way for
outside powers to unshoulder colonies or divide up spheres of
influence  &MD;  a strategy of divide and quit.
<p>
   Although described as the lesser of two evils, the partitions in
Cyprus, India, Palestine and Ireland, rather than separating
irreconcilable ethnic groups, fomented further violence and forced
mass migration. Even where partition enabled outside powers to
leave, as in India, it also led to a disastrous war.
<p>
   Often thought of as a provisional solution, it has been unable
to contain the fragmentation it triggers among dispersed or
overlapping ethnic groups that are not confined by the neat
geographic boundaries. It also gives birth to weak civil
institutions demanding supervision.
<p>
   Similarly, the partition of Bosnia, which from the start should
have been reintegrated, will also amount only to a policy of divide
and be forced to stay.
<p>
   When asked on ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer'' in November 1995
whether the Dayton agreement was a partition, Richard C. Holbrooke,
the assistant secretary of state, said he preferred the example of
Czechoslovakia's voluntary dissolution.
<p>
   In the early 1990s the most frequently cited example of a
peaceful negotiated division was Czechoslovakia's ``velvet
divorce.''
<p>
   But fewer people now refer to the Czech split.
<p>
   A comparison between Bosnia and the partitions of Ireland, India
and Cyprus, or the incomplete partition of Palestine, would be
better, because each involved ethnically mixed and dispersed
populations and each was held to be a pragmatic recognition of
irreconcilable ethnic identities.
<p>
   In many ways Cyprus offers the most striking parallels to
Bosnia, and its history again raises the question of whether a
peaceful transition to partition is possible.
<p>
   Despite the 20 years since partition, the short fuse in Cyprus
is all-too-evident today.
<p>
   A violent demonstration by Cypriots in August 1996 resulted in
Greece and Turkey threatening war. The costs of containment still
include permanent vigilance on the part of NATO and the Atlantic
allies.
<p>
   In regions of multiple ethnicities  &MD;  where, for example, the
same individual might have loyalties to one community for its
religion and another for language  &MD;  trying to make one ethnic
identity dominant can trigger further fragmentation and conflict.
<p>
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a partitioned territory, has problems of
dispersed populations and continuing fragmentation, which the
Dayton peace agreement shows little promise of resolving. It is
difficult to contain a conflict when partition is still in
progress.
<p>
   Nearly half the pre-1992 population of Bosnia is still living as
refugees outside Bosnia. Ethnically homogeneous territories can be
created only if the refugees are refused repatriation to the towns
and villages from which they were driven, which puts pressure on
their host countries not to enforce repatriation.
<p>
   The refugees have become a key constituency that is used both to
further and to challenge the consolidation of ethnic territories,
as in the Serb efforts to force refugees to vote from towns other
than their prewar residences, and the subsequent threat of Bosnian
Muslims to boycott the elections.
<p>
   A looming concern is that yet another partition will ensue  &MD;  a
third line that will separate the Herzegovinian Croats and the
Bosnian Muslims, who now live together in the Bosnian Federation.
<p>
   Since the 1994 agreement signed in Washington that established
the federation  &MD;  which was intended to limit Bosnia's partition  &MD; 
Herzegovinian Croats have asked: If a two-way partition is
acceptable, why not a three-way one?
<p>
   NATO and IFOR have also pointed out an even more crucial
concern: A partition dependent on the awkward boundary line between
the Bosnian Federation and Republika Srpska, the Bosnian-Serb
entity, can last only so long as a large international force is
there to enforce it.
<p>
   As pressure mounts to accept a local mandate for partition, more
emphasis is being placed on the reintegration option of the Dayton
agreement, which assumes that the partition lines will erode by
becoming irrelevant.
<p>
   The extent of the partitioning which the Dayton agreement partly
accepts is only a means of buying time for Bosnia to reintegrate,
it is being argued. But historically, the failure to inject
substantial and timely aid has only hardened ethnic divisions.
<p>
   In fact, ethnic partitions have never been reversed. Their
implementation has inexorably driven communities further apart.
<p>
   The Dayton pact's hope that economic interests will militate
against ethnic boundaries was also voiced in Ireland and Palestine.
Irish nationalists and the U.N. mediators in Palestine both hoped
that mutual dependence, geographic proximity and the benefits of
shared infrastructure would gradually dissipate the aftermath of
ethnic partition.
<p>
   Indeed, the U.N. plan for the partition of Palestine was based
explicitly on the premise that economic union would compensate for
the difficulties of the proposed territories. Instead, partition's
legacies thwarted economic union and kept both Ireland and what was
left of Palestine in poverty.
<p>
   If the lessons of such examples are noteworthy, it may be
because Bosnia will constitute a turning point in partition theory.
The fact that NATO is preparing for an extended presence indicates
that the alliance recognizes the unlikely success of a
divide-and-quit approach.
<p>
   Though divide and quit was a motive in Britain's support for
partition in Ireland, Palestine and India, it got Britain out
quickly only in India, and that was because South Asia is distant
from Britain.
<p>
   From the sequence of events in Bosnia, it is clear that European
and American leaders, and the rest of the international community,
were prepared to accept partition if it would curtail Western
intervention in the conflict and limit Western involvement in the
region.
<p>
   But as the partition process unfolds, it is being recognized
that divide and quit might turn into divide and be forced to stay.
<p>
   So far, the West has not been able to walk away from this war,
and each halfhearted intervention, however delusory, has led to
more rather than less involvement.
<p>
   As the realization takes hold that a Bosnian partition may mean
an indefinitely prolonged commitment to a chronically volatile
region, investment in reintegration may be discovered to be an
easier route to withdrawal.

   PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice, into the

<p>
   Every day it becomes clearer that the peace accord ending the
war in former Yugoslavia was actually a historically familiar
scheme  &MD;  a so-called peace accord that is in fact a partition
agreement.
<p>
   As such the Bosnian war and the Dayton peace agreement have
reignited a debate on whether partition is an effective solution to
ethnic conflict.
<p>
   Defenders of partition argue that when an ethnic war is far
advanced, partition is probably the most humane form of
intervention because it attempts to achieve through negotiation
what would otherwise be achieved through fighting. It circumvents
the conflict, they say, and saves lives.
<p>
   It might even save a country from disappearing altogether
because an impartial intervenor will attempt to secure the rights
of each contending ethnic group, whereas in war the stronger groups
might oust the weaker ones.
<p>
   In fact, advocates say, the ideal strategy for resolving an
ethnic conflict is to intervene and take partition to its logical
conclusion by dividing a country along its battle lines and helping
make the resulting territories ethnically homogeneous through
organized population transfers.
<p>
   Supposedly this will ensure that partition is more than a
temporary means of containing conflict.
<p>
   But partition has its own sordid history, not arising as a means
of realizing national self-determination, but imposed as a way for
outside powers to unshoulder colonies or divide up spheres of
influence  &MD;  a strategy of divide and quit.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Bear Stearns Cos. said earnings
in its fiscal second quarter rose 68 percent to a record $176.5
million, led by trading and investment banking.
<p>
   The sixth-biggest U.S. securities firm's net income for the
three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.27 a share, from $105.2
million, or 72 cents, in the same period a year earlier.
<p>
   The results exceeded the average forecast of 89 cents a share
from analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. by more than 40
percent. That sent Bear Stearns shares up 1 7/8, or more than 6
percent, to close at an all-time high of 31 3/4.
<p>
   The stock rose ``as Bear Stearns' good earnings became known and
it was clear that there was nothing one-time in nature in the
results,'' said analyst Sallie Krawcheck, who follows securities
firms for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. `` The firm was strong
everywhere.''
<p>
   Bear Stearns' earnings come amid a surge in securities firms'
profits as low interest rates and record highs in the stock market
boost trading, underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Yesterday
Salomon Inc., the world's biggest bond trader, said fourth-quarter
earnings rose 36 percent, while Smith Barney Inc., the
second-biggest broker, reported a 21 percent gain in profits.
<p>
   ``These are the best quarterly results Bear Stearns has ever
had, representing the sixth consecutive quarter in which our return
on common equity has topped 20 percent,'' said Bear Stearns Chief
Executive James Cayne. The firm's return on shareholders' equity, a
key measure of profitability, was 33 percent in the second quarter.
<p>
   Bear Stearns, one of Wall Street's biggest traders of stocks and
bonds, said revenue for the quarter after interest expense rose 37
percent to $940.1 million from $688 million in the year-earlier
period.
<p>
   Trading revenue rose 65 percent to a record $429.2 million.
Trading contributed 46 percent of the firm's net revenue in the
second quarter, versus 43 percent in the same period a year
earlier.
<p>
   Investment banking revenue rose 22 percent to $183 million. Bear
Stearns was the eighth-biggest underwriter of U.S. stocks and bonds
during the quarter, according to Securities Data Co., a Newark, New
Jersey-based firm that tracks the securities industry. Bear Stearns
was the fifth-largest arranger of high-yield debt sales, the most
profitable bond underwriting for Wall Street firms.
<p>
   Brokerage commissions rose 12 percent to $184 million.
<p>
   Bear Stearns' non-interest expense increased 27 percent to $650
million. Compensation as a percentage of net revenue in the quarter
was 49 percent versus 50 percent in the same period a year earlier.
<p>
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, Bear Stearns earned $285.0
million, or $2.02 a share, up 43 percent from $199.0 million, or
$1.36, a year earlier. The firm's return on shareholders' equity
was 27 percent.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co.
turned back a court challenge to the soft drink company's granting
of stock options for 1 million shares to Chairman and Chief
Executive Roberto C. Goizueta.
<p>
   Delaware Chancery Court Judge Jack Jacobs dismissed the suit
yesterday, citing incorrect procedure by the plaintiff, shareholder
Melvyn Zupnick.
<p>
   Zupnick claimed that granting the stock options to Goizueta
wasted company assets because the executive was being rewarded for
work he had already been compensated for.
<p>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said the option was a bonus to reward
Goizueta for the $69 billion increase in the company's market value
from 1981 through early 1995.
<p>
   Coke's board approved giving the option in April 1995.
<p>
   Jacobs ruled that before filing suit, Zupnick should have asked
the company's board to take corrective action. Delaware law
requires this step in most cases before allowing a derivative
stockholder's suit.
<p>
   Zupnick argued he was entitled to skip the requirement because
the board's action would not have been approved by a person of
ordinary business judgment.
<p>
   The court disagreed with Zupnick's assessment, however, and
dismissed the case.
<p>
   Executive compensation has been the subject of controversy
recently. Walt Disney Co. shareholders filed suit this month to
stop payment of an estimated $130 million severance package to
former Disney executive Michael Ovitz.

<p>
   Some groups praise TV, some condemn it, but all take an interest
in the box that changed the world.
<p>
   The most prominent American groups include Viewers for Quality
Television, the Parents Television Council, Entertainment Monitor
magazine, the Catholic Church's TV &AMP; Movie Guide and the American
Family Association. They come to the issue with different
perspectives based on religion, morality and consumer views.
<p>
   The Parents Television Council was formed in 1995 in an effort
to clean up TV. Specifically, it aimed to restore the family hour
(the first hour in prime time), according to executive director
Mark Honig. PTC is a special project of the Media Research Center,
a conservative media watchdog group based in Alexandria, Va., and
had a $700,000 budget in 1996.
<p>
   ``In the past few years what we've seen creeping into the first
hour of prime time is sexual situations and innuendo, promiscuity
and sex outside of marriage and vulgar language that was not on TV
a few years ago or was relegated to later viewing hours,'' Honig
said.
<p>
   PTC publishes an annual Family Guide to Prime Time Television,
which the group hopes will help parents make informed viewing
decisions. The guide rates shows using a traffic light system with
green for family-friendly series, yellow for shows with
adult-oriented themes and red for programs with gratuitous sex,
explicit language and violent content.
<p>
   In the 1996-1997 edition, ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' ``Cybill,''
``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``Friends'' and ``Seinfeld'' were among
the programs receiving red lights, while ``Walker, Texas Ranger''
(a show decried by many groups for its violence) received a yellow
light.
<p>
   ``At least good always triumphs over evil and there's a positive
lesson from that,'' Honig said of ``Walker,'' but he acknowledged
that some people see violence as more detrimental to young viewers
than sexuality.
<p>
   Viewers for Quality Television is a 12-year-old advocacy group
that lobbies networks on behalf of quality TV shows. VQT doesn't
pick shows that are best for family viewing; rather, the group
defines a show as quality if it ``enriches, challenges, involves
and often confronts ... It rises above entertainment. It dares to
take risks.''
<p>
   With that agenda, VQT supports shows both loved (``Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman'') and loathed (``NYPD Blue'') by other
organizations. Other programs endorsed by VQT include ``Dangerous
Minds,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``ER,'' ``Frasier,''
``Friends,'' ``Grace Under Fire,'' ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``Mad About You,'' ``Murder One,''
``Party of Five,'' ``Seinfeld,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Touched By
an Angel.''
<p>
   VQT is supported by member contributions and has a 1997 budget
of $80,000, according to president and founder Dorothy Swanson.
<p>
   Besides specific TV advocacy groups, some organizations have
created publications to address concerns about TV show content. The
Roman Catholic Church has a weekly TV &AMP; Movie Guiden published for
about 10 years and has 120 subscribers (many of them Catholic
schools).
<p>
   ``We don't rate programs,'' said Henry Herx, director of the
office of film and broadcasting for the United States Catholic
Conference. ``We just provide information. We explain what the
story line is and who's in it and how well it's done and what some
might find objectionable for their family.''
<p>
   Most of the space in the TV &AMP; Movie Guide is devoted to film
reviews  &MD;  the group even has a toll-free number parents can call to
hear about movies: (800) 311-4222  &MD;  but the TV information that's
included is written in conventional review form.
<p>
   Of the ABC sitcom ``Spin City,'' Herx wrote: ``As for family
audiences, forget it  &MD;  the spin master shares his bed with a
sleep-in girlfriend and the show's humor is riddled with sexual
references.''
<p>
   The Entertainment Monitor is a commercial publication that has
existed for a little more than a year. The magazine began with a
focus on music, according to publisher Charlie Gilreath, but is now
adding a staff to devote more coverage to TV. The magazine's name
will soon change to the Family Entertainment Review to appeal to
parents seeking guidance.
<p>
   Gilreath said his magazine won't pass judgment on programs;
rather, it will provide general information on show content. He
compared the magazine's descriptions to food labels.
<p>
   ``I don't think we'll get into the number of times someone
utters an expletive,'' Gilreath said. ``We'll just let people know
if a show contains nudity or sexual innuendo, and I think that's
all parents want.'' Gilreath said writing TV show synopses is not
an absolute science.
<p>
   Along with those who seek to promote quality TV and restore the
family hour, there are also groups that urge boycotts of programs
(and the products advertised during them). The most famous of these
protesters is the Rev. Donald Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., whose
19-year-old American Family Association has led the charge against
``NYPD Blue'' (for language and nudity) and most recently has
promised to protest ``Ellen'' (if she comes out as a lesbian).
<p>
   Wildmon's group is in agreement with many of the other
organizations that the new TV ratings system isn't much help to
parents  &MD;  but for different reasons.
<p>
   In a statement, Wildmon said the TV ratings, because they're
determined by the networks, are ``a self-serving tool. The only
thing this rating system will do is absolve the networks of
responsibility for the content of their programs.''
<p>
   The ratings evaluate programs based on their age appropriateness
and label prime-time shows TV-G (general audiences), TV-PG
(parental guidance suggested), TV-14 (parents strongly cautioned)
and TV-M (mature audiences only).
<p>
   PTC's Mark Honig said the ratings are vague and pointed to
recent episodes of ``Promised Land'' and ``Spin City,'' which both
received a TV-PG rating.
<p>
   ``In terms of language, sex or violence there was nothing
apparent on `Promised Land,' but then I turned on `Spin City' and I
heard the word `ass' twice, `bitch' once and they talked about
downloading nude photos on the Internet,'' Honig said. ``There's a
vast difference between those two shows, but the rating doesn't
tell you why it has that rating.''
<p>
   Albany, N.Y., VQT member Risa Scranton said instead of a rating
she rather have information about a show's content so she can make
a viewing decision herself.
<p>
   ``I would prefer my kids don't see graphic violence or blatant
and gratuitous sex scenes,'' Scranton said. ``Is the rating because
of language? Is it because of violence? I want to know.''
<p>
   The rating system is a precursor to the new V-chip technology,
which will allow parents to program the next generation of
television sets to block out programs they don't want their
children to see. By mid-1998 all new TV sets must have the V-chip.
<p>
   Whatever the future of the TV rating system or technology,
experts say the only way the amount of sex and violence on TV will
be reduced is if viewers stop watching those programs.
<p>
   ``It's easier to shake your finger and say, `This is bad,'''
Gilreath said. ``If you want to change TV, you have to make the
decision to not view things. The world has to get used to the fact
that they're going to have to be active on this issue.''

   Denver, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Colorado stocks index fell, led
by Barrett Resources Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Colorado Stock Index, a price weighted list of
companies with operations in the region, fell 0.34 to 139.37.
<p>
   Barrett Resources fell 1 5/8 to 40 1/4 along with other oil and
gas stocks as the industry awaited the release of the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report after the close of
commodity trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's Smallcap Oil and Gas Index
fell 5.17, or 3.06 percent, to 163.65.
<p>
   February gold contracts fell $2.10 to $351.70 an ounce in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange Comex division, and the
declining gold prices continued to depress the state's gold mining
sector.
<p>
   Newmont Mining fell 1 to 39 5/8, while its operating unit,
Newmont Gold Co. fell 3/4 to 39 1/4. Golden Star Resources Ltd.
fell 3/4 to 14. Amax Gold Inc. fell 1/8 to 6 1/8. Echo Bay Mines
Ltd. also fell 1/8 to 6 3/16.
<p>
   In the broader market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose 3.50
to 786.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.87 to 6,850.03.
<p>
   The Colorado Stock Index was developed with a base value of 100
as of Dec. 30, 1994. The state index has advanced 2.21 percent this
year, compared with 6.14 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.

 &UR; LILLIAN GISH ARCHIVE TO GO TO PERFORMING ARTS LIBRARY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (bl) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;   &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Lillian Gish's personal archive of letters, business
documents, photographs and scrapbooks has found a home at the New
York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Gish, the legendary
stage and film star, died at age 99 at her home in Manhattan in
1993, leaving a rich repository of material on her life and career.
<p>
   ``These materials will be of invaluable use to scholars
investigating any aspect of the 20th-century dramatic arts,'' said
New York Public Library president Paul LeClerc. ``We are thrilled
that we can preserve them and make them accessible as part of our
Billy Rose Theater Collection.''
<p>
   The correspondence addressed to Gish, perhaps as many as 10,000
unpublished letters from friends, colleagues and business
associates, forms the heart and soul of the archive. The names are
dazzling. In addition to Gish's sister, Dorothy, they include D.W.
Griffith, Helen Hayes, George Abbott, Sean O'Casey, Maxwell
Anderson, Thornton Wilder, Brooks Atkinson and Sir Alec Guinness.
There are thick folders of letters from her agent, A. George Volck;
Sir John Gielgud and Eugene and Carlotta O'Neill.
<p>
   The O'Neill relationship dates from the late 1920s, when Lillian
Gish optioned ``Strange Interlude'' for $75,000 as a possible
vehicle for herself. The document is included in the archive. Gish
had to drop the project when the play became the subject of a
nuisance lawsuit against O'Neill. The film was eventually made in
1932 and starred Norma Shearer and Clark Gable.
<p>
   The collection includes letters from the French director Abel
Gance in 1926, asking Gish to play Joan of Arc. In a lengthy
telegram of April 1925, Mary Pickford tries to persuade Gish to
join the United Artists studio, arguing that she would be treated
as an artist and not asked to turn out too many films. A year
later, Pickford writes to apologize for an interview in Movie
Weekly in which it appeared that she was trying to make herself
sound younger than Gish.
<p>
   One highlight of the correspondence is a 1936 letter from the
Broadway producer George Abbott, who had seen her playing Ophelia
opposite John Gielgud's Hamlet and decided that she needed to be
cast against type. ``I think that you are swell in the mad scenes
and unconvincing in the ingenue scenes,'' he wrote.
<p>
   ``I think you were marvelous in `Camille.' You have not aged in
face or figure, but you are a more mature person. You have a more
adult soul, and those parts in which the key note is freshness are
not so well suited to you as those in which there is a woman and a
soul.''
<p>
   One of the more peculiar letters in the archive is from Joseph
Medill Patterson, the founder and publisher of The New York Daily
News, who in 1930 thought, erroneously, that Gish intended to play
Desdemona opposite black actor Paul Robeson. Patterson pleaded with
Gish to drop the idea, which, he wrote, ``would have a disastrous
effect on your popularity in many parts of the country.''
<p>
   Conspicuously absent from the archive are any love letters from
the critic George Jean Nathan, with whom Gish had an affair.
<p>
   In addition to the correspondence, the archive includes
production photographs from many of the plays and films that Gish
appeared in, family photographs, medical records, appointment
ledgers, scripts and books.
<p>
   ``This is one of the great American working lives in film and
theater, and these are the working documents,'' said Robert Marx,
the executive director of the performing arts library, which is in
Lincoln Center. ``There's a solid professional correspondence that
balances the personal correspondence.''
<p>
   In her will, Gish left instructions that her archive be left to
a university or research institution and not be sold. Her trustees
conducted a yearlong search before choosing the Library for the
Performing Arts last March. The library decided to delay an
announcement until it had done preliminary cataloguing and
preservation work and organized a public program on Gish's life and
work.
<p>
   The trustees chose the library because it is in New York, where
Gish spent much of her life and career, and because it already
contains abundant material, like the Helen Hayes collection, that
dovetails with the Gish archive. As it happens, Gish was the first
actress to use the theater collection. In 1931, officials allowed
her special access to research the title role in ``Camille,'' which
she was preparing to play on Broadway.
<p>
   ``Lillian Gish Remembered,'' a series scheduled to run from
March 6 to June 2, will feature readings and reminiscences by
friends and colleagues of Gish and screenings of her films. The
archive will be available to scholars in the fall, after the
library has completed its cataloguing and preservation work.

<p>
   Seattle, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. is expected to see
earnings jump more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter, bolstered
by increased deliveries of its commercial aircraft.
<p>
   Boeing's deliveries suffered in the fourth quarter of 1995 as a
10-week strike by the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers crippled production.
<p>
   The world's largest maker of commercial jets is expected to earn
97 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up from 63 cents a share in
the year-ago period, according to the average of 14 analysts
surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   ``A dollar a share isn't unreasonable'' for Boeing in the fourth
quarter, said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst at BT
Securities in New York.
<p>
   Boeing is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow morning before
the stock market opens.
<p>
   Analysts based their estimates on Boeing's delivery of 62
aircraft to the world's airlines during the quarter, up from just
36 in fourth-quarter 1995.
<p>
   The deliveries included 10 of Boeing's mammoth 747s, which cost
about $165 million each. Analysts estimate that each 747 sale adds
about 5 cents to Boeing's earnings.
<p>
   Boeing also delivered eight of its new 777s, which deliver far
lower profit because the aircraft is new and still has lots of
development costs that must be paid off. Demisch said sales of the
aircraft probably covers its costs now, and little else.
<p>
   Analysts expect Boeing's earnings to rise from now until at
least 2000 as the torrent of orders it received for commercial
aircraft this year turns into deliveries.
<p>
   Analysts at NatWest Securities Corp. in New York expect Boeing's
deliveries to rise to 365 in 1997 and 445 in 1998, compared with
the 218 Boeing delivered this year.
<p>
   Boeing won orders for 614 aircraft in 1996 as airlines around
the world made plans to replace jetliners and buy new ones to add
to their fleets. That's up from 346 orders in 1995 and just 120 in
1994, when poor profits at the airlines made few willing to splurge
on new aircraft.
<p>
   Seattle-based Boeing will get a modest contribution to earnings
from the defense businesses it bought from Rockwell International
Corp. for $3.2 billion. Boeing completed that purchase on Dec. 8,
making the businesses a subsidiary.
<p>
   Just days later, Boeing agreed to buy rival McDonnell Douglas
Corp. in an all-stock transaction valued at $13.3 billion at the
time. A recent rise in Boeing's stock has made that purchase worth
more than $15 billion to McDonnell shareholders.
<p>
   If the purchase is approved by regulators, Boeing will become
the world's largest aerospace company, competing with Lockheed
Martin Corp. in a wide range of defense and space projects for the
U.S. government.
<p>
   Boeing shares fell 1 5/8 to 112 1/4 today, slipping from the
record high of 114 1/2 reached yesterday when the company said it
scrapped plans to build two larger versions of its 747 jetliner,
already the world's largest. The project was expected to cost $7
billion in research and development.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  The New York City Ballet presented an extremely
well-balanced program Tuesday night at the New York State Theater.
``The Chairman Dances'' is a colorful, stylized romp through the
score by John Adams that gives the ballet its name. Choreographed
by Peter Martins, the ballet spills two battalions of eight women
across the floor in sidling, sweeping ranks whose momentum matches
that of the music.
<p>
   Dressed in Rouben Ter-Arutunian's fanciful red and purple silk
pajamas and wearing black topknots, the corps women are small
slashes of color moving across a Minimalist canvas. Wendy Whelan,
their leader, looks less glamorous than usual in her bunchy whites.
But ``The Chairman Dances'' is a post-modernist confection that is
not about presence or technique.
<p>
   The program opened with George Balanchine's ``Ballo della
Regina,'' a bit of minor Balanchine classicism that shifts with
distracting abruptness between playful, airborne lyricism and regal
ceremony. The veteran ballerina Merrill Ashley is less buoyant and
driven these days, but it is now possible to see the choreography
and her meticulousness even more clearly in her dancing.
<p>
   Damian Woetzel was her dashing and attentive partner. The
soloists were Rachel Rutherford, Isabel Kimmel, Stacey Calvert and
Jennifer Tinsley.
<p>
   In two role debuts, Ms. Kimmel danced with an engagingly
gangling abandon and Ms. Rutherford with minxlike charm and polish.
<p>
   Balanchine explores a dance form and a culture in his ``Vienna
Waltzes,'' at the same time creating a lavish audience pleaser. The
ballet has lost some of its quieter nuances in the 20 years since
its premiere. There was an inadvertent hint of Mae West in the Gold
and Silver Waltz, danced by Lourdes Lopez, overpowered by her
costume, and Peter Hansen, her very innocent young blond cavalier.
<p>
   And Darci Kistler, partnered by Igor Zelensky, overdramatized
and embellished the exquisite Rosenkavalier waltz, trusting, it
seemed, neither the choreography nor herself to do the job.
<p>
   The performance  &MD;  and the evening as a whole  &MD;  reached a much
higher level of exciting artistry with the exuberant, sharp-edged
classical dancing of Nichol Hlinka and Peter Boal in the
Fruehlingsstimmen. The lead cast was completed by Diana White, Jock
Soto and an enjoyably rowdy Kathleen Tracey and Michael Byars in
the polka.

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said it
began offering all U.S. clients securities trading, mutual funds
and financial planning for a single annual fee.
<p>
   The nation's biggest brokerage firm first offered the new
program, called Merrill Lynch Financial Advantage Service, to some
clients on a trial basis in October.
<p>
   ``Our pilot has been the most successful introduction of a new
service we've ever had.'' said John L. Steffens, head of Merrill's
brokerage unit. Clients participating in the program won't pay
brokerage commissions for a limited number of trades and will get
financial advice and price reductions on other services such as
margin loans and mortgages, the company said.
<p>
   Smith Barney, the nation's second-largest brokerage firm, began
offering a similar service this month. The moves by the two firms
are designed to expand their clients' investment choices as
investors flock to so-called fund supermarkets, which offer the
choice of a variety of mutual funds.
<p>
   Charles Schwab Corp. offered the first fund supermarket in 1992,
called OneSource, which now handles some $39 billion. OneSource's
success has spawned several imitations, including products from
Quick &AMP; Reilly Inc., Smith Barney and Fidelity Investments.
<p>
   Merrill will start a mutual fund supermarket of its own in
March, said Arthur Urciuoli, a senior vice president in Merrill's
private client group, The fund supermarket will give clients a
choice of 1,100 load and no-load mutual funds, including ll0
managed by Merrill.
<p>
   No-load funds don't charge investors sales commissions when they
buy the funds.
<p>
   Clients have put some $150 million in assets into Financial
Advantage since Merrill offered it in 14 offices starting in
October, according to Urciuoli. He said he'd be disappointed if
Financial Advantage doesn't grow to $5 billion in assets by the end
of this year.
<p>
   Merrill doesn't expect to earn any extra money from Financial
Advantage because fees from the program will be offset by lost
brokerage commissions.
<p>
   Still, Financial Advantage will boost Merrill's fee income at a
time when it and many of its Wall Street rivals want to decrease
reliance on volatile trading commissions and underwriting fees,
which rise and fall with swings in the stock and bond markets.
<p>
   ``To the extent our revenues are more predictable, that's a
positive, Urciuoli said.
<p>
   Merrill now covers about 70 percent of its fixed expenses with
fees from asset management, investment banking and other services,
and the firm wants to increase that percentage, Merrill executives
say.
<p>
   Merrill's 13,600 brokers help clients around the world manage
more than $779 billion in assets. Merrill earns fees, as opposed to
brokerage commissions, on about $30 billion of those assets. The
firm expects to more than triple those fee-earning assets in five
years.
<p>
   ``Our fee-based alternatives have nowhere to go but up,'' said
Steffens.
<p>
   Financial Advantage is designed for investors who may trade
stock and bonds infrequently but have several brokerage or mutual
fund accounts and are interested in financial planning.
<p>
   Clients with between $100,000 and $250,000 in Merrill accounts
get 12 commission-free trades a year, an analysis of retirement and
college investments and access to the firm's stock and bond
research for a fee equal to 1.5 percent of assets.
<p>
   As clients keep more money with Merrill, their fees go down and
commission-free trades and financial planning services increase.
Clients with more than $1 million in their Merrill accounts pay a
fee of 1 percent or less and receive between 50 and 75 free trades
and expanded financial planning.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co.
turned back a court challenge to the soft drink company's granting
of stock options for 1 million shares to Chairman and Chief
Executive Roberto C. Goizueta.
<p>
   Delaware Chancery Court Judge Jack Jacobs dismissed the suit
yesterday, citing incorrect procedure by the plaintiff, shareholder
Melvyn Zupnick.
<p>
   Zupnick claimed that granting the stock options to Goizueta
wasted company assets because the executive was being rewarded for
work he had already been compensated for.
<p>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said the option was a bonus to reward
Goizueta for the $69 billion increase in the company's market value
from 1981 through early 1995.
<p>
   Coke's board approved giving the option in April 1995.
<p>
   Jacobs ruled that before filing suit, Zupnick should have asked
the company's board to take corrective action. Delaware law
requires this step in most cases before allowing a derivative
stockholder's suit.
<p>
   Zupnick argued he was entitled to skip the requirement because
the board's action would not have been approved by a person of
ordinary business judgment.
<p>
   The court disagreed with Zupnick's assessment, however, and
dismissed the case.
<p>
   Executive compensation has been the subject of controversy
recently. Walt Disney Co. shareholders filed suit this month to
stop payment of an estimated $130 million severance package to
former Disney executive Michael Ovitz.

<p>
   MELBOURNE, Australia  &MD;  The evening was pleasantly devoid of
intrusive weather, and 10th-seeded Albert Costa, the Spanish No. 1,
was able to lure Pete Sampras, the world's No. 1, all the way into
a fifth set under the murky clouds Wednesday night in their tense
Australian Open quarterfinal.
<p>
   The occasionally perplexed Sampras lost his serve only once in
the match, but there he was, scampering after drop shots, having
his hair ruffled by passing shots, and spending his second match in
succession locked in long-term combat against a player who
shouldn't have bothered him. At least not this much.
<p>
   But in his most clever maneuver of the night, Sampras sneaked
out to a 3-1 lead in the final set against Costa and held on for a
6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory that forwarded him into a
semifinal slot here for the fourth time in the last five years.
<p>
   ``These guys are just kind of coming out of the woodwork, and
it's tough to play them; they play with a lot of spin, a lot of
determination, and a lot of heart,'' Sampras said of a new
generation of Spaniards so flexible away from their native red clay
that one of them, 24th-ranked Carlos Moya, has earned a semifinal
assignment against second-seeded Michael Chang.
<p>
   Wednesday night, Sampras put 23 aces past Costa, one of a record
three Spanish men who took advantage of these sluggish hard courts
and reached the Australian quarterfinals, and he also broke his
21-year-old challenger's serve five times. But until Sampras
stepped his aggression up a level in the final set, Costa, now 1-5
in five-setters, showed no signs of backing off.
<p>
   ``For him to play five sets is hard, but it's not really hard,''
Costa said about Sampras, whose five-set resume improved to 24-8.
``He's used to playing like this.''
<p>
   The oppressive 72-hour heat wave had given way to showers during
the day session, so the tournament was able to flaunt its $4
million retractable roof with impunity. But an indoor setting that
should have helped third-seeded Goran Ivanisevic serve with
impunity, didn't.
<p>
   As the swallows trapped in the rafters turned the stadium into a
twittering birdcage, a caged up and cranky Ivanisevic found himself
completely vulnerable to the cat-like attack of fifth-seeded Thomas
Muster of Austria.
<p>
   Muster's emphatic 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 upset of the volatile Ivanisevic
sent the 1995 French Open champion into his first Australian Open
semifinal since 1989. That year a freakish knee injury forced him
to virtually abandon his pursuit of titles on any surface less
forgiving than red clay.
<p>
   So Sampras will get to test his endurance in the semifinals
against Muster, who barely bothered to sit down during the
changeovers in his 1-hour-42-minute throttling of Ivanisevic.
<p>
   ``I don't know if he is normal,'' observed Ivanisevic, who
relishes his rests during changeovers but didn't get to enjoy them
Wednesday. ``I'm sitting on the changeover, and he's already
waiting for me to serve, but that's Thomas, nobody's like Thomas.''
<p>
   The 29-year-old Muster, the oldest but fittest Top 10 player on
the planet, terrorized the Croat with a relentless series of
rock-hard returns that were accompanied by Muster's signature
prehistoric grunts.
<p>
   But Muster's strategy was also enhanced by a double dose of
space-age technology: not only did he use a computer to decipher
Ivanisevic's serve before the match, he used an extended racquet to
bolster his own strokes during it.
<p>
   Muster was still outaced by 16 to three, but he made just 14
unforced errors to Ivanisevic's 54 and said the only drawback about
his computer is that ``it doesn't play for you.''
<p>
   On the women's side, the oldest and youngest players left in
contention prevailed.
<p>
   First, Mary Joe Fernandez, a seasoned two-time finalist at this
Grand Slam, and then 16-year-old Martina Hingis, the fourth and
highest remaining seeded player on the star-starved women's side,
reached the semifinals with straight-set victories. They joined
unseeded Mary Pierce, this event's champion in 1995, and
12th-seeded Amanda Coetzer, a semifinalist last year.
<p>
   Hingis briefly pushed the panic button the other day after
learning that, for the first time in the Open era, a Grand Slam
tournament had lost all three of its top-seeded women before the
quarterfinal round.
<p>
   The development ``made me have a big chance instead of a little
chance,'' said Hingis, who kept her chance of becoming the youngest
Grand Slam champion of this century intact with a 7-5, 6-2
dismissal of eighth-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania.
<p>
   Hingis, whose previous best showing at a Grand Slam was a
semifinal finish at the 1996 U.S. Open, left herself just two
victories away from becoming the youngest Grand Slam champion since
15-year-old Lottie Dodd won Wimbledon in 1887.
<p>
   In the semifinals, Hingis will face a 10-year veteran in the
25-year-old Fernandez, who advanced by 7-5, 4-0 Wednesday after her
unseeded Belgian opponent, 43rd-ranked Dominque Van Roost,
defaulted because of a strained abdominal muscle. The hard-hitting
Van Roost was already in tears after Fernandez took a 3-0 lead in
the second set, then quit after netting an overhead on the opening
point of the fifth game.
<p>
   ``I may be the oldest one left in the tournament, and I'm
probably the least favorite out of all of them,'' said Fernandez,
who hasn't reached a Grand Slam semifinal since 1993 but reached
the first of her three Slam finals here in 1990. ``In the back of
my mind, I always know that,'' she said, ``so I end up playing
pretty well.''
<p>
   In contrast to Fernandez, who made just 11 unforced errors, Van
Roost committed 43. In further contrast to Fernandez, who split
with the longtime coach Harold Solomon and had contemplated
retirement this year, the 23-year-old Van Roost recently married
her coach and, as a certified late-bloomer, won her second career
title two weeks ago at Hobart, Tasmania. Here, Van Roost knocked
out second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.

   Hartford, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Connecticut stocks
rose to a record, led by shares of Trident International Inc.,
whose stock climbed 24 percent after an Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons Inc.
analyst raised his rating.
<p>
   The Bloomberg Connecticut Index rose 0.26 to a record 153.21,
surpassing yesterday's record of 152.95. The index is a
price-weighted list of 160 Connecticut-based companies' shares
designed to reflect in part the performance of the state's economy.
The index began Dec. 30, 1994 at a base value of 100.
<p>
   Shares of Brookfield-based Trident rose 4 3/8 to 22 1/2 after
Alex. Brown analyst William L. Potter raised his rating on the
maker of industrial ink-jet printing equipment to ``strong buy''
from ``buy.''
<p>
   Trident shares surged 7 1/4, or 48 percent, since the company
said late Monday its fiscal first-quarter net income was $1.74
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a loss of $405,000, or
28 cents, in the comparable period in 1995.
<p>
   Sales rose 8 percent in the quarter to $6.54 million from $6.05
million, the company said.
<p>
   Prudential Securities analyst Alex Henderson said yesterday the
company could see sustainable 30 percent revenue growth and see
earnings hit $1.00 this fiscal year and $1.35 next year.
<p>
   Shares of insurer Travelers Group Inc. also rose, climbing 2 3/8
to 53 5/8 after the company said it would buy back $1 billion in
stock and increase its dividend 33 percent. Travelers is based in
New York, but has substantial operations in Connecticut.
<p>
   Connecticut-based health maintenance organizations were among
state stocks whose shares fell after the Clinton administration
proposed a plan to reduce Medicare spending, partly with a $46
billion cut in payments to HMOs.
<p>
   Shares of Norwalk-based Oxford Health Plans Inc. fell 1 to 52
3/8. Shares of Trumbull-based Physicians Health Services Inc. fell
1 to 23.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. should
create a voting trust that would try to repeal Conrail Inc.'s
anti-takeover defenses, clearing the way for Norfolk Southern's
$10.32 billion hostile bid for the Philadelphia-based railroad, a
Conrail shareholder said.
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte &AMP; Co., a New York-based investment company that
holds about 385,000 Conrail shares, or 0.4 percent of Conrail's
total, said Conrail shareholders should place their shares in a
voting trust controlled by Norfolk Southern that would vote
collectively on all issues related to Conrail's anti-takeover
provisions.
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte wants the provisions repealed. It has been vocal in
its opposition to CSX Corp.'s planned $9.72 billion cash-and-stock
acquisition for Conrail, saying the offer is too low and coercive
to Conrail shareholders.
<p>
   Guy Wyser-Pratte, president of the investment firm, said
shareholders are upset at Conrail's refusal to talk to Norfolk
Southern, even in the face of a shareholder vote last week that
rejected the CSX-Conrail acquisition under its present terms.
Wyser-Pratte specializes in takeover arbitrage, or investing in
companies that are or may become acquisition candidates.
<p>
   ``By doing nothing more than announcing that they will schedule
another vote, Conrail's board is demonstrating its utter disdain
for shareholders and acting on its belief that shareholders can be
coerced into accepting an inferior offer,'' he said.
<p>
   Last week, Conrail shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a
proposal to exempt Conrail from a Pennsylvania law that forbids a
two-tiered acquisition such as the one CSX has proposed. Conrail
has vowed to call another vote on the issue.
<p>
   Separately, Norfolk Southern today began its promised tender
offer to buy 8.2 million Conrail shares at $115 a piece. That
amount -- about 9.9 percent of the outstanding common shares --is
the maximum Norfolk Southern can buy without tripping Conrail's
``poison pill'' defense against hostile takeovers. The offer
expires at midnight New York time on Feb. 4.
<p>
   CSX also said today that it was extending its own tender offer
for 20.1 percent of Conrail shares to 5 p.m. on Feb. 14. It was
originally scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today. CSX already owns
19.9 percent of Conrail.
<p>
   Shares of Conrail rose 3 1/4 to 107 1/4, a 52-week high. Shares
of Norfolk Southern rose 1 to 88 1/8, while CSX rose 1 5/8 to 49
1/8.
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte said it will make a proposal on the voting trust to
Norfolk Southern soon.
<p>
   Bob Fort, a Norfolk Southern spokesman, said Norfolk Southern
hasn't received the proposal and declined to comment on it.
<p>
   The voting trust would require at least 50 percent of Conrail's
total outstanding shares to be effective, Wyser-Pratte said. By
placing their shares in the trust, Conrail shareholders wouldn't
give up the right to vote separately on other issues affecting the
merger, Wyser-Pratte said.
<p>
   On Jan. 13, Wyser-Pratte said it will propose an amendment to
Conrail's corporate bylaws that would force the company to call a
special meeting in which shareholders would vote whether to remove
Conrail's ``poison pill'' takeover defenses, which are designed to
make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive.
<p>
   Wyser-Pratte also said it will propose that CSX not be allowed
to buy Conrail unless a majority of shareholders not affiliated
with either company vote in favor of the merger. Wyser-Pratte said
it will make the proposals at Conrail's annual shareholders
meeting, which hasn't been scheduled yet.

   With his strange slab of hair and his taste for heavy metal,
Steve, who calls himself a ``head banger,'' may seem the sort of
teen-ager you'd just as soon avoid. But in conversation he turns
out to be reflective and, although he might shudder at the word,
sweet.
<p>
   That's applies, too, to the dozen other 14-year-olds you can
meet in ``Class of 2000,'' an upbeat encounter with a generation
that worries the nation.
<p>
   CBS News producers spent four months around Joppatowne High
School in Harford County, Md., last fall talking with freshmen,
parents and teachers. The principal notes that his students come
from high-priced shore homes and from trailer parks; about a
quarter are black, Hispanic or Asian-American. Maybe the producers
chose the most appealing of them; if so, they chose well.
<p>
   There's Suzanne, an honor-roll student determined to become a
cheerleader although she concedes she is quite a few pounds over
the cheerleader image. Tim is worried about his father being out of
work; Kris, who is dyslexic, has to struggle in the classroom, but
football comes naturally to him. Shawn, small, white and good at
schoolwork, is best friends with Brent, tall, black and in special
education. All of them talk sensibly about matters that matter:
parents, sex, drugs, race, religion, music, money, friendship and
death.
<p>
   Mark McEwen delivers the on-camera narration, which, except for
an irrelevant detour to China, keeps the focus on the youngsters.
You can't help liking them.
<p>
   The report finds clues to their apparent wholesomeness in visits
to their homes. Although some of their parents are divorced, and
two girls are being brought up by single mothers, all seem
fortunate in living with adults who pay attention to them.
<p>
   Tim's mother must be speaking for many parents when she says,
``You can raise them so much and give them so many values, and then
you've got to sit back and trust them.'' If there is a lesson in
these heartening and affecting two hours, maybe that is it.

<p>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.  &MD;  Inside a small laboratory, Edward
J.A. Pope wages war on diabetes, one of mankind's most vexing
diseases.
<p>
   Pope's most potent weapon, and one that he developed, is a
``sol-gel'' process not yet found in medical facilities. The
process, for which he has patents pending, produces small,
pale-pink ceramic beads that encase a collection of
insulin-producing beta cells.
<p>
   The goal is simple.
<p>
   The task is daunting.
<p>
   And the testing is in the earliest stages.
<p>
   But the rewards for his company, Matech, could be great.
<p>
   Pope, who earned a Ph.D. in materials science from UCLA, is
trying to develop a new treatment for diabetes that would free
millions of sufferers from the task of giving themselves daily
injections of insulin, which converts blood sugar to energy.
<p>
   The beads, made from a proprietary process that results in the
formation of what he calls ``living ceramics,'' are his magic
bullet.
<p>
   ``We're taking living cells, whether they be bacteria, fungi or
mammal cells, and forming the ceramic around them, while keeping
the cells alive,'' Pope said. ``Nobody has ever done that before.
So in a sense this is a new class of materials.''
<p>
   A $94,000 Small Business Innovative Research Grant from the
National Institutes of Health funded the research's first phase,
during which the treatment kept some laboratory mice that receive
capsule implants diabetes-free for three months.
<p>
   Experts in diabetes research and treatment say it is too early
to say whether Pope will be successful, and they do not want to
raise expectations of people suffering from the disease.
<p>
   ``The public should be aware that is a promising area ... but
(success) is not around the corner. It's going to take a lot of
years to do this,'' said Dr. Seymour Levin, a diabetes specialist
and professor of medicine at UCLA.
<p>
   Levin is also on the board of the Los Angeles chapter of the
American Diabetes Association and is director of the diabetes
program at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical
Center.
<p>
   ``We've been dreaming about this since the early '70s,'' said
Dr. Gordon Weir, head of the transplant unit at the Joslin Diabetes
Center in Boston. ``We have to be very cautious about accepting
discoveries in mice as being a breakthrough treatment. We don't
know how long this is going to take.''
<p>
   Pope is being assisted in the research by chemist Karen P. Braun
and Dr. Chuck Peterson, a specialist in diabetes and alcoholism. He
agrees that the work must be slow and painstaking.
<p>
   Pope used 15 diabetic mice in the study's first phase. Nine did
not receive any treatment, and six died soon after the onset of
diabetes. Two were given placebos  &MD;  ceramic capsules without the
beta cells  &MD;  and they also died.
<p>
   Four mice received the capsules containing the insulin-producing
cells. Large capsules were implanted in two mice and small capsules
in two.
<p>
   Those with small bead transplants were still alive by the
study's end. And one them was still alive and gaining weight nearly
nine weeks after receiving the implant.
<p>
   The ones that received the large beads were healthy for a while
but then became sick and were euthanized.
<p>
   ``What we wanted to study was whether the diameter of the bead
made a difference. And it does make a big difference, so that's a
very important finding,'' Pope said.
<p>
   The capsules were removed from the euthanized mice, and Pope was
able to verify that they were still producing insulin, although not
enough to overcome the disease.
<p>
   Pope said while waiting for additional health institute funding,
his company will implant small capsules in 10 diabetic mice and
chart the treatment's progress.
<p>
   As the company proceeds with testing, it also plans to try
implanting pig cells that produce insulin in other test mice.
<p>
   It's all part of a lengthy process that could lead to U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approval for human tests in the distant
future.
<p>
   ``It's pretty complicated, and it all depends on what type of
product they are bringing to market and whether it is a variation
of something already out there or a breakthrough process,'' FDA
spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said of the agency's review procedure.

   PBS is broadcasting the second program in a now-and-then series
on the workings and misworkings of the press and television.
<p>
   The first and by far the most incisive segment reports on how
most major news organizations failed to do their own investigations
of last year's dispute over late-term abortions, relying instead on
not always accurate information from the abortion-rights side.
<p>
   Next comes a profile of the ferociously conservative editorial
page of The Wall Street Journal, including an interview with its
editor, Robert Bartley. And the hour ends with a worry-of-the-week
piece on how easily photographs can be manipulated by computers.
<p>
   ``Media Matters'' could do with a touch less sermonizing from
its host and executive editor, Alex Jones, a former reporter for
The New York Times, and from imported experts. But its straight-on,
knowledgeable approach to the contentious issue of how news is
being delivered these days is a welcome addition to the PBS lineup.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Fresh off a series of planes from San Francisco, we were waiting
to get our passports stamped at the Cairo airport, standing in a
long line that was going nowhere.
<p>
   All around us, Egyptians in traditional djellabas were shuffling
their feet, checking their watches and exchanging impatient
glances. Suddenly, without warning, a siren sounded and the
Egyptians dropped to the floor.
<p>
   What was going on? An air raid? As I started to crouch down
myself, I saw that the Egyptians were pulling packages of dates and
other food from their robes and tucking hungrily into them. One man
noticed the puzzled look on my face, laughed, gestured at the
impromptu picnic and said, ``Ramadan!''
<p>
   Ramadan, which began nine days ago, is one of the holiest times
of the year for the world's 1.5 billion Muslims, a monthlong
observance marked not by celebration and consumption, but by quiet
devotion and self-sacrifice.
<p>
   Between dawn and sunset, Muslims must abstain from food, drink  &MD; 
including water  &MD;  cigarettes, gum, sex and such frivolous
activities as cursing and gossiping. Most get up long before
sunrise to eat a small meal to sustain them through the day.
<p>
   Traditionally, fasting begins when it grows light enough to
distinguish a black thread from a white one. (These days the time
is a specified period before sunrise, usually an hour to 90
minutes, depending on the latitude.)
<p>
   Fasting continues until the sun dips below the horizon  &MD;  an
event that, at least in the case of the Cairo airport, is announced
by a blaring siren.
<p>
   Muslims believe Ramadan is the month in which God began
revealing the Koran to his prophet Mohammed. Observed during the
ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, it moves ahead about 10
days each year. This year the fast began Jan. 10; next year it will
start Jan. 1.
<p>
   There's little pageantry or display associated with it, except
for the last day, when the breaking of the final fast is often
marked by community celebrations called Eid al-fitr.
<p>
   ``Ramadan is a time for developing your inner soul, connecting
with God and developing more sympathy for the unfortunate and the
poor,'' said Ebrahim Nana, a trustee of the Islamic Center of San
Francisco. ``It's not necessarily for show.''
<p>
   Compared to the orgy of commercialism and consumption that
Christmas has become, the inward-looking devotion of Ramadan makes
a fascinating and poignant counterpoint.
<p>
   Traveling through the Islamic world during Ramadan can present
problems for non-Muslim visitors, although not nearly as many as
you'd think. Non-Muslims are not expected to fast, and Muslims
generally don't mind if others eat and drink in their presence.
<p>
   In larger cities that get a lot of international visitors, it's
usually no trouble to find an open restaurant or food store during
daylight hours. But out in the countryside, in more remote towns
and villages, it can sometimes be tricky, if not impossible. Your
best bet is to head to the cafe at the nearest railway station:
Islamic travelers are exempt from fasting, and rail station cafes
are usually open.
<p>
   Slaking certain kinds of thirst can be even more problematic.
Even in downtown Cairo, the bar in our hotel refused to serve
alcohol during Ramadan  &MD;  even after the sun went down.
<p>
   The scarcity of open restaurants can pose a problem for
diabetics, such as my wife, Jeri, who must eat at regular
intervals. In Al Jadida, Morocco, we huddled on a remote corner of
the beach at lunchtime and furtively peeled an orange. Soon we
attracted a large crowd of local youths, who wagged their fingers
at us and made disapproving sounds.
<p>
   It was no use trying to explain that we weren't Muslims, or that
their faith excuses people with legitimate medical needs from
fasting. We hurried back to our hotel, locked the door, drew the
drapes and ate our lunch, feeling slightly guilty.

 &UR; BC-BRE-X-BARRICK-BLOOM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; SOME BRE-X MINERALS HOLDERS SEE BARRICK ACCORD WITHIN 30 DAYS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Calgary, Alberta, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Some Bre-X Minerals
Ltd. shareholders said they expect the company and Barrick Gold
Corp. to reach agreement on developing a giant Indonesian gold
deposit within a government-imposed deadline.
<p>
   Bre-X and Barrick submitted a joint development plan to
Indonesian officials on Dec. 16, about three weeks after the
government said Bre-X must sell 75 percent of its holding in the
Busang gold find to Barrick.
<p>
   Indonesian Mines Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana added another demand
in a Jan. 17 letter to the companies, telling them they have a
month to come to terms with Bre-X's local partners, who own 10
percent of Busang.
<p>
   While Bre-X would prefer to hold an auction for any stake in
Busang, ``Barrick has an inside track and will strike a deal
somehow,'' said John Madden of Keystone Investments of Boston,
which holds Bre-X shares.
<p>
   At stake is Bre-X's 90 percent interest in the world's richest
gold find, a field on the island of Borneo that contains at least
57 million ounces of gold and perhaps as much as 100 million
ounces, analysts said.
<p>
   Bre-X shares rose C$0.05 to C$22.65. Barrick shares fell by
C$0.60 to C$35.55.
<p>
   The Indonesia letter is bad news for Placer Dome Inc., analysts
said. Placer Dome, one of the world's top 10 gold producers, last
week attempted to elbow its way into the Busang sweepstakes, making
an unsolicited C$6.7 billion (US$5 billion) bid for Bre-X.
``Unfortunately, Placer is out,'' said Dan Leonard, portfolio
manager with Denver's Invesco Trust Co., which owns 900,000 Bre-X
shares and could benefit if an auction led to a higher price for
Bre-X. ``The Indonesian government is holding a gun to the heads of
Bre-X and Barrick.'' Placer Dome shares fell C$0.70 to C$27.60.
<p>
   The bid by Vancouver, British Columbia-based Placer, which
offered Indonesia a 40 percent interest in Busang, will force
Barrick to increase its offer to Bre-X and Busang's 10 percent
owners PT Askatindo Karya Minerals and PT Amsya Lyna, Leonard said.
<p>
   To be sure, the Indonesia government, ruled by President
Suharto, could still change the rules for any company interested in
Busang.
<p>
   Local businessman Mohammad Hasan, a close friend of President
Suharto, purchased a controlling stake in Bre-X's minority partners
recently. Hasan, who has said he favors an open bidding process,
encouraged Placer Dome to make its bid, a Placer Dome official
said.
<p>
   ``The open auction process is in the works,'' said Greg Chorny
of Aurora, Ontario, who owns 1.5 million Bre-X shares. Chorny, who
says he plans to sue Barrick, said he expects Barrick to be cut out
of the negotiations on Busang.
<p>
   A Barrick spokesman said the company believes it has the support
of the Indonesian government and declined to comment on Hasan or on
Chorny. In the last month, the company said it is better equipped
than any of its potential competitors to finance and operate a gold
mine on the scale of Busang.
<p>
   ``The government wants the most money and they want it developed
as quick as possible,'' said analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon
Capital Corp. ``The safest bet is with Barrick.''
<p>
   Hasan's influence may yet open the way for an auction involving
Placer and other mining companies, such as Teck Corp. of Vancouver
and Newmont Gold Mining of Denver, Fowler said.
<p>
   Bre-X officials said they will not discuss the new Indonesian
deadline in detail. ``We remain anxious to join forces with local
and foreign partners acceptable to the government of Indonesia,''
David Walsh, chairman of the Calgary-based exploration company,
said in a statement.
<p>
   The Indonesian government hasn't given final approval for
Bre-X's Contract of Work application. The Jan. 17 letter instructs
Bre-X and Barrick to form a new corporate entity and submit an
application for a new Contract of Work.
<p>
   The delay on Busang has caused a backlog in mining applications
and slowed down foreign investment in the resource-rich and
capital-poor country, analysts said.
<p>
   ``The mining business in Indonesia has stopped because of this
long delay,'' said John Eng, analyst with Maison Placements Canada
Inc. ``There are 70-odd contract of work applications that are
currently waiting for final approval. Not only is the government
frustrated but other mining companies are frustrated.''

   If Pope's treatment proves suitable for humans, the
ramifications could be huge.
<p>
   Diabetes, a disorder that results in a partial or complete
inability of the body to use its main fuel, glucose, affects about
16 million Americans. Only about half are even aware that they have
the disease.
<p>
   Ignoring the condition can be devastating to the body, since the
disease can gradually damage blood vessels and tissues with
devastating long-term complications. Those complications can
include destruction of the eyes, kidneys and nerves.
<p>
   The disease kills about 400,000 Americans annually.
<p>
   Here is how Pope's process works:
<p>
   The ceramic material and islets containing a collection of
insulin-secreting pancreatic cells, harvested from donor mice, are
mixed and suspended in a special solution at the top of a drip
tower. As the ceramic material moves down through the solution in
the tower, it forms around the cells.
<p>
   By the time it reaches the bottom, the bead has formed.
<p>
   The beads are then implanted into the mice being treated.
<p>
   While the beads look solid to the naked eye, the walls are shot
through with pores large enough for glucose molecules to enter and
trigger the insulin-producing process, much the same way as in a
fully functioning pancreas.
<p>
   Pope says he hopes to make a device that will last at least a
year and be possible to implant just under the skin in humans.
<p>
   Pope has invested about $200,000 of his company's money on the
project and will go to the venture capital market for funds as the
research expands and the tests become more complicated.
<p>
   He has been involved in sol-gel research since 1981 and formed
his Matech materials-technology company in 1989. The company does
materials consulting and develops advanced materials and optical
coatings with special properties.
<p>
   The research into diabetes evolved over time.
<p>
   ``It wasn't a crusade for diabetes. My driving force was to
create a whole new class of engineering materials. That was kind of
my grandiose vision,'' Pope said. ``So I essentially looked at
what's the new frontier for this new class of materials.'' &UR; !end! &LR;

   A new winter diversion has come to the woods of Vermont. Making
use of cross-country ski trails and a hunter's tool, the sport
encourages the sure-footedness of a snowshoer and the eye of a
rifleman.
<p>
   Organized in the Smugglers' Notch area of Vermont, the event is
being called the Primitive Biathlon. Contestants are limited to
18th century gear: single-barrel muzzleloaders or muskets for their
guns, and wooden frame snowshoes. The muskets fire small lead balls
similar to the kind of ammunition used during the Revolutionary
War. The balls and powder are loaded from the end of the gun barrel
using a mounted ramrod.
<p>
   The snowshoes used are heavier and more ungainly than the short,
lightweight metal varieties so popular today. But the older designs
are meant to fit in with the mountain-man image that makes the
Primitive Biathlon unique. In the Olympics, biathlon competitors
use modern rifles and cross-country skis.
<p>
   ``Most towns have torchlight parades and snowmen,'' said Ray
Saloomey, president of the Smugglers' Notch Area Chamber of
Commerce in Jeffersonville, Vt., and founder of the event. ``I
wanted to come up with something different. Most hunters are bored
stiff at this time of year, and are looking for something to do. So
the idea just kind of evolved.''
<p>
   Twenty-five competitors entered the two-day contest upon its
inception last year. Organizers expect at least that many for the
1997 event this weekend.
<p>
   Michael Burke, who lives a quarter-mile down the road from the
race area, was last year's winner. He said that he won because he
never missed a shot in his 90 minutes of competition.
<p>
   ``It was very icy and rainy last year,'' Burke, 49, said.
``There wasn't enough snow on the day I competed for snowshoes, so
we ran. I'm not a fast runner, so I walked and then trotted. I
controlled my breathing, and I tried to stay focused.''
<p>
   The competition, which is open to all contestants who show up
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, requires each contestant
to set off separately in a race against the clock. Along the route,
laid out on cross-country trails at the Sterling Ridge Inn, the
biathletes encounter three firing ranges.
<p>
   The first two are set in the woods, each with a firing line and
three 8-inch metal gongs at a distance of about 50 yards. Each
competitor is allowed three shots to hit a gong. A misfire, when
the gun fails to go off, is counted as a miss.
<p>
   The last firing range is situated in an open field so that
spectators can watch more easily. The final score is based on total
elapsed time with a five-minute credit for each hit.
<p>
   Burke said that he was so taken with the event last year that he
has invited his brother and his 13-year-old nephew to compete this
year. With about 2 feet of snow on the ground, he expects to be
able to don his snowshoes this time.
<p>
   ``It's a spontaneous thing,'' Burke said. ``It's not so much
winning that's important. It's just a very invigorating thing to do
at a very dark time of the year. It's a good outing.''
<p>
   Winter Sports in the Extreme
<p>
   A winter version of the X Games, the extreme sport competition
staged last summer by ESPN television in Rhode Island, is scheduled
to debut Jan. 30 at the Snow Summit Resort in Big Bear Lake, Calif.
<p>
   The four-day event will feature a bevy of new winter sports for
its television coverage. Included is snowboarding, but with more
daring categories than those approved for Olympic competition.
<p>
   Besides a half-pipe  &MD;  the only Olympic-style discipline  &MD;  the X
Games will stage a boarder X contest with six athletes racing down
the mountain at one time; big air  &MD;  which requires the snowboarder
to leap over a 12-foot jump, and freestyle, races in a snowboard
park setting.
<p>
   Other competitions for the 180 athletes expected at the $200,000
X Games are ice climbing; snow bike racing; shovel racing (on
aerodynamic hybrids of the basic shovel); and a ``duathalon,'' a
combination of snowboarding and dry-land competition.
<p>
   Women's Pro Tour Race Set
<p>
   The Women's Professional Ski Tour plans one of its rare night
races Jan. 25 at Jiminy Peak, Mass. The event, the $25,000 Women's
Pro Ski Bowl, lists the race as the tour's only evening competition
this year in the United States.
<p>
   Among the top Alpine skiers racing will be Julie Parisien, 25, a
former U.S. Olympic skier, who currently is No. 1 on the
professional circuit with 55 points, a five-point lead over Camilla
Lundback of Sweden.
<p>
   The giant slalom race is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. Saturday;
the slalom event will be at 11 a.m. Sunday. As many as 30 women are
expected to compete.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
disappointing earnings from International Business Machines Corp.
kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average from setting another record.
Rising health and bank shares boosted the broader market.
<p>
   The Dow industrials fell 33.87 to 6850.03, snapping a streak of
four consecutive closing highs. IBM dropped 10 to 158. Had IBM
finished the day unchanged, the 30-stock average would have risen
3.03 points.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose to a record,
gaining 3.51 to 786.23. Leading the advance were Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Exxon Corp. and Intel Corp., all of which reported strong earnings
in the past 10 days. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 11.09 to an
all-time high of 1388.06.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't think the market's overvalued in the context of
all of the positives: You have declining interest rates, corporate
America's become more profitable and more competitive. We're in an
hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Investors pouring money into mutual funds continued to boost
shares. Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter that tracks money going
to mutual funds, said assets are pouring in at a $28.4 billion
monthly pace, $500 million short of the record set last January.
<p>
   ``You're having tremendous demand for stocks,'' said Philip
Brown, president of Meridian Investment Co., with $3.7 billion in
equities. ``You have an economy that isn't doing that bad.
Corporate profits aren't declining -- they just aren't going to be
up as much.''
<p>
   IBM, which rose 56 percent in the past year, said profit rose 18
percent. A stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hampered
gains. Net income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3
cents below analysts' expectations. Today's 6 percent decline in
IBM shares reduced their value about the same level as three weeks
earlier.
<p>
   Coming on the heels of surprisingly good numbers from Intel and
Microsoft, other computer-industry shares held up amid IBM's
retreat.
<p>
   Oracle Corp. gained 5/8 to 42 3/8. Microsoft Corp. rose 2 3/8 to
97 3/8 and Intel jumped 4 1/16 to 152 1/8, a peak as well.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, a senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at the No. 1 maker of personal
computers, Compaq Computer Corp. The Houston-based computer maker
said earnings gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing
expectations by 11 cents. Compaq jumped 5 to 83 1/2.
<p>
   Other PC makers gained. Gateway 2000 Inc., a mail-order computer
retailer, rose 3 1/2 to 62 5/8. Rival Dell Computer Corp. rose 2
5/8 to 66 3/4.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, topping forecasts. Its shares
gained 7/8 to 38.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a
share, 2 cents above analysts' expectations, according to IBES
International Inc. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 123 1/8.
<p>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson jumped 3 7/8 to a record 57 3/8. The
health-care product company gained 2 1/2 yesterday, after reporting
a 20 percent jump in earnings. Its shares have risen 34 percent in
the past year.
<p>
   Drugmakers rallied as the disappointment from IBM prodded
investors to bid up shares with the ``highest earnings
predictability,'' said Eagle Asset's Corba. Merck &AMP; Co. rose 1 7/8
to 88 3/8, and Pfizer Inc. gained 1 5/8 to 88 1/4.
<p>
   ``The broad market is set up for more disappointments,'' he
said.
<p>
   Norand Corp., a maker of mobile computers, surged 13 5/8 to 33
after Western Atlas Inc. said it would pay $261.3 million, or
$33.50 a share in cash, for all of Norand's 7.8 million shares.
Western Atlas fell 2 to 70 1/8.
<p>
   Travelers Group Inc. jumped to a record after saying it would
buy $1 billion in stock and boost its dividend 33 percent to 15
cents a quarter. Shares gained 2 3/8 to 53 5/8.
<p>
   Exxon rose 2 3/8 to a all-time high of 106.
<p>
   Steris Corp. sank 8 3/4 to 29 1/4 after Bill Sanford, the
company's chairman and chief executive, told the Dow Jones news
service he expects the medical device company to earn 38 cents a
share in the fiscal third quarter, below analysts' average
expectation of 53 cents, according to IBES.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's fell 1/2 to
38 7/8.
<p>
   Some companies that beat earnings estimates for last quarter but
fell anyway, as investors expected weakening results down the road.
<p>
   Computer Associates International Inc. retreated 2 3/4 to 43 1/4
after reporting profit rose 25 percent. The company's shares have
fallen 30 percent since Dec. 27, when it warned that software sales
in Europe wouldn't match year-earlier levels.
<p>
   U.S. Robotics slipped 1 3/8 to 72 1/4 after matching profit
forecasts. Concern arose that higher inventory would drag down
results.
<p>
   Gains in stocks were muted as the yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond rose 5 basis points to 6.83 percent. The yield is
used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, so when it rises
it can hurt companies' bottom lines.
<p>
   Banks continued to rally on the back of yesterday's strong

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Western Resources Inc.'s
ratings on debt and preferred stock were cut by Standard &AMP; Poor's
Corp. because of recent planned and completed acquisitions,
including a $3.5 billion hostile bid for ADT Ltd.
<p>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its ratings on about $1.3 billion in
senior secured debt one notch to ``BBB+'' from ``A-.'' S&AMP;P also cut
ratings on about $300 million in preferred and preference stock one
notch to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+.''
<p>
   Western could face another ratings cut if it buys ADT, which has
ratings of ``BBB-,'' said Richard Cortwright, a director with the
debt-rating company. Western's ratings have been on watch since
April 15, the day after it made a hostile bid for a neighboring
utility, Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
<p>
   ``No matter what, this company won't come out of this with an
`A-' rating,'' Cortwright said. ``We thought it was time we
recognized that.''
<p>
   Western could keep its senior secured rating at ``BBB+'' by
buying Kansas City Power, for which it made a $1.9 billion offer,
Cortwright said.
<p>
   Kansas City Power has a senior secured rating of ``A,'' two
notches above Western's new grade. Western, which operates two
Kansas electricity and natural gas utilities, has said it could
save about $1 billion in 10 years by combining with Kansas City
Power.
<p>
   Although the Kansas City Power board agreed to meet with Western
to discuss the offer, no decision has been made, said Michel
Philipp, a Western spokeswoman.
<p>
   Western is likely to acquire ADT before it purchases Kansas City
Power, even though the ADT board is fighting Western's bid,
Cortwright said. Winning the regulatory approval for a combination
of two electric utilities can take more than a year, he said.
<p>
   Western said it wasn't surprised by the ratings cut because the
company has been expanding into new businesses, Philipp said.
Western, once primarily the parent company of two Kansas utilities,
has expanded into security monitoring to prepare for deregulation
of power sales. The new businesses don't have the guaranteed
returns that utilities long enjoyed, Philipp said.
<p>
   Nor are utilities likely to have those guarantees much longer,
she said. Congress this year is expected to deregulate power sales,
letting consumer choose their power suppliers in much the same way
they currently choose long-distance telephone providers.
<p>
   ``The energy business no longer has a monopoly,'' Philipp said.
More utilities are likely to see their bond ratings fall, she said.
<p>
   S&AMP;P also said Western Resources used too much debt to acquire
monitored security businesses, other than ADT. Western also
prolonged a delay in issuing much-needed common equity, S&AMP;P said.
<p>
   Western rose 1/4 to 31 1/8.

 &UR; U.S. COMMODITIES: COFFEE SOARS ON SUPPLY CONCERN (UPDATE1) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Coffee jumped to a five-month
high amid concern that a Colombian dockworkers' strike and a
disappointing Brazilian crop would reduce exports from the world's
two top producers.
<p>
   On other markets, gold and soybeans fell. The Commodity Research
Bureau index dropped 0.08 to 240.76, while the energy-weighted
Goldman Sachs Commodity Index gained 0.69 to 209.06.
<p>
   A strike at Colombia's key Pacific port of Buenaventura today
entered its ninth day, delaying shipment of at least 210,000
132-pound bags, said a spokesman for Colombia's Coffee Growers
Federation.
<p>
   At the same time, concern is mounting that Brazil's coffee crop
will fall well short of U.S. Department of Agriculture projections
of 27.0 million bags. Brazilian officials said Monday that the
nation's harvest, normally one-fourth of global supplies, could be
as low as 18 million bags.
<p>
   ``It's difficult to assess the Brazilian crop,'' said Carl
Walker, an analyst at InterAmerican Commodities in Houston. ``That
the prospects for a smaller crop have been advertised is having an
effect on this market,'' he said, while ``the Colombian coffee just
isn't moving.''
<p>
   Coffee for March delivery rose 5.65 cents to $1.353 a pound on
the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, the highest price for an active
contract since Aug. 26.
<p>
   While many traders doubt the accuracy of the Brazilian
forecasts, lean supplies leave little cushion for a shortfall.
Exchange-monitored warehouses as of Jan. 20 held 22,363 bags, about
100,000 fewer than a year ago.
<p>
   Speculation that the Association of Coffee Producing Countries,
which represents 70 percent of world coffee output and will meet
tomorrow in Brazil, will agree to reduce exports fueled the rally.
<p>
   ``If they decide to cut exports, prices could go higher, given
that roasters' stock levels are fairly low,'' said Szolt Papp, a
commodity analyst at UBS Ltd. in London.
<p>
   Gold dropped to its lowest price since September 1993 as the
dollar surged against several major currencies, raising the cost to
foreign investors.
<p>
   The dollar climbed to a 47-month high against then yen and a 2
1/2-year high against the deutsche mark, powered by expectations
that industrial nations won't act to halt its rise.
<p>
   Gold prices, suffering from forecasts for muted inflation and
the prospect of central bank sales, are down 4.7 percent so far
this year as investors look for more attractive returns elsewhere.
<p>
   ``Gold has suffered all around the world from asset
relocation,'' said Bridget Fraser, a vice president of
commodity-based derivatives at Bankers Trust in New York. ``The
traditional gold holders are looking for alternative investments --
the outlook for gold isn't great. Prices are going lower.''
<p>
   Gold for February delivery fell $2.10 to $351.70 an ounce on the
New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division, its lowest closing
price since Sept. 17, 1993.
<p>
   Also, Bema Gold Corp. announced plans to double production at a
mine in northern Chile during the next few years. The Refugio mine
has the potential to produce 500,000 ounces of gold a year,
compared with its target for 1997 of 240,000 ounces.
<p>
   Soybean futures fell amid expectations that recent rain in South
America replenished soil moisture, promising a bumper harvest.
<p>
   As much as 3 inches of rain last weekend fell on the world's
second-largest soybean crop, with the greatest amounts in key
growing areas of southern Brazil. Additional water is on the way.
Weather Services Corp. said scattered rains are likely in southern
Brazil through the weekend, and chances are increasing for showers
or thundershowers early next week.
<p>
   The rains could end concern that dry weather during the past
month would stunt development of the soybean crop, second in size
to the U.S. harvest.
<p>
   ``People don't believe we have a weather problem in South
America,'' said Don Roose, analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa. ``We think it's almost back to ideal, and that
has set the market back.''
<p>
   Soybeans for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell
to $7.405 a bushel, down 6.25 cents.
<p>
   Other commodities settled as follow:
Precious Metals: February Gold down $2.10 to $351.70 an ounce March
Silver up 0.08 cent to $4.723 an ounce April Platinum down $1.70 to

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar jumped to a 47-month
high versus the yen and a 31-month peak against the mark, bolstered
by U.S. economic strength and expectations that leading industrial
nations won't stand in the way of its rise.
<p>
   ``The beat goes on for the dollar,'' said James McGroarty, chief
currency manager of Potomac Babson Inc., a money management firm
whose parent, David L. Babson Inc., manages $13 billion of assets.
Potomac Babson bought dollars at 1.6360 marks today, McGroarty
said. ``We think this move has further to go.''
<p>
   In the past month, the dollar rose 6 percent against the
deutsche mark and 4 percent against the yen, buoyed by reports of
strong job growth and industrial output.
<p>
   It surged to 1.6445 marks today, its highest since June 15,
1994, and to 119.18 yen, its highest since Feb. 19, 1993. It also
climbed to a 32-month peak of 1.4358 Swiss francs.
<p>
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6405 marks,
up from 1.6298 marks late yesterday in New York, and at 118.93 yen,
up from 117.99 yen.
<p>
   The U.S. currency got a boost as Russia's parliament voted to
discuss a demand for President Boris Yeltsin's resignation because
of his poor health. Signs of political turmoil in Russia often hurt
the mark because Germany is Russia's largest trading partner and
creditor.
<p>
   Expectations that the U.S. economy will keep outpacing its
rivals, luring global investors, are at the root of the dollar's
recent gains, traders said.
<p>
   ``The U.S. economy is strong enough so that the next move in
interest rates will be up, while Germany's economic recovery is
anemic, and Japan's economy continues to weaken,'' McGroarty said.
<p>
   The economic slump in Japan ``will keep the dollar well
supported,'' said Jeff Berger, director of foreign exchange for
AlliedSignal Inc., an auto-parts maker based in Morristown, New
Jersey. ``We see the dollar strong through the first half of the
year.''
<p>
   Nor do traders expect the world's most powerful central banks to
stand in the dollar's way. The Group of Seven leading industrial
nations ``isn't holding the dollar back,'' said McGroarty of
Potomac Babson. The G-7 are the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada.
<p>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said repeatedly during the
past two weeks that a strong dollar is in the national interest,
making clear the U.S. isn't backing away from its support for the
currency.
<p>
   ``The Treasury secretary has been consistent, and Fed governors
have been talking about the benefits of a strong dollar too,''
McGroarty said.
<p>
   To be sure, Ernst Welteke, a Bundesbank council member, said
today that the dollar is unlikely to rise much further. Yet his
remarks had little effect on the dollar, partly because he also
said the German central bank doesn't plan to sell dollars for marks
to stem its ascent.
<p>
   With Germany's economic recovery still sputtering, the
Bundesbank will likely tolerate a weaker mark, which would boost
German exports by making them cheaper in foreign currency terms,
traders said. Germany's economy grew only 1.4 percent last year.
<p>
   ``Germany's economy is going nowhere fast,'' said Richard Koss,
currency strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting
firm. He predicted the Bundesbank will cut interest rates this
quarter to spark the economy. Lower rates would hurt the mark by
making German deposits and bonds less attractive to global
investors.
<p>
   In Japan, while some officials have warned against an
``excessive'' decline by the yen, they haven't clearly stated that
it has fallen too far.
<p>
   With Japan's economy stagnant, many traders say officials there
favor a weaker yen to boost exports. The economy grew at only a 0.4
percent annualized rate in the third quarter, and its stock market
has plummeted 7 percent so far this year.
<p>
   By comparison, many analysts forecast the U.S. economy grew at a
3.5 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter -- and stocks
rose to records this week.
<p>
   ``The perception of U.S. economic strength may allow the dollar
to continue higher,'' said Kevin Raphael, manager of foreign
exchange at Rabobank Nederland.
<p>
   He said it could reach 1.68 marks and 120 yen in the next month.
<p>
   Elsewhere, the British pound fell almost 2 percent against the
dollar after the U.K. reported a 0.8 percent drop in December
retail sales. The news quelled speculation that the government will
raise interest rates soon.
<p>
   Sterling fell to $1.6355 in late New York trading from $1.6644
late yesterday in New York. Earlier, it fell to $1.6298, its lowest
since Dec. 5.
<p>
   The dollar rose to 1.4289 Swiss francs from 1.4196 francs
yesterday and to 5.5360 French francs from 5.4960 francs. It gained
to 1,598 Italian lire from 1,582 lire. The Canadian dollar fell to
74.74 U.S. cents from 74.83 cents yesterday.

Japan to Reduce Red Tape Involving Mergers and Acquisitions
<p>
   A Justice Ministry committee yesterday said the government
should simply administrative regulations to promote corporate
mergers and acquisitions. The advisory committee called for repeal
of a requirement that merged companies report the mergers at a
special shareholders' meeting. The committee also said the
government should lift requirements that the companies individually
report the mergers to their creditors. (Nihon Keizai)

Japan Banks to Report Capital Adequacy Ratios Under New Standard
<p>
   Japan's major commercial banks, known as city banks, will
disclose their capital adequacy ratios under a new government
standard when they report their earnings for the half year to
September. The Finance Ministry will compile the new method of
assessing the banks' capital adequacy ratios by the end of this
month. (Nihon Keizai, p.7)
Sony Music Entertainment to Report 39% Rise in Group Net Profit
<p>
   Sony Music Entertainment Inc. is expected to report group net
profit of 14 billion yen ($117.6 million) for this fiscal year
through March 1997, up 39 percent on the year. That's higher than
the company's most recent estimate of 12.8 billion yen. The profit
increase is due to improving earnings of Sony Computer
Entertainment, a subsidiary that makes video game machines. (Nihon

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is
not wildly popular with Senate GOP lawmakers, but fortunately for
Andrew Cuomo their attitude does not appear to extend to his
nomination as HUD secretary.
<p>
   Republican senators on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee sang Cuomo's praises Wednesday at a confirmation
hearing, even as they heaped vitriol on the $19.5 billion agency
that 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole called ``one of the
last bastions of Socialism.''
<p>
   HUD oversees 3,400 public housing authorities, their 1.25
million units providing shelter to three million mainly poor
people. But GOP critics charge many housing programs have failed to
help those in need move out of poverty.
<p>
   ``HUD has failed in many areas and in many instances it has lost
sight of its mission,'' said Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who last
year introduced legislation to abolish the agency.
<p>
   Nevertheless, Faircloth said he had heard many admiring comments
from diverse sources about Cuomo, 39, assistant HUD secretary for
community planning and development, and son of former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
<p>
   ``You certainly have an impressive record and an impressive
group of friends,'' Faircloth told Cuomo, evoking laughter in the
wood-paneled hearing room.
<p>
   Committee chairman Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., told Cuomo he
supported the nomination and no one dissented.
<p>
   If confirmed, Cuomo would succeed departing HUD Secretary Henry
Cisneros, who won praise from committee members for improving the
agency and rethinking the role of government in housing the
nation's poor.
<p>
   Supported at the hearing by his wife Kerry and his mother-in-law
Ethel Kennedy, widow of legendary former senator and attorney
general Robert F. Kennedy, Cuomo attempted to reassure the
Republicans of his moderation.
<p>
   HUD's goal must be ``the development of self-sufficiency, not
the perpetuation of government programs,'' Cuomo said.
Nevertheless, he said, the agency cannot forget the ``millions of
Americans who have not experienced the American dream.''
<p>
   The agency must plan toward ``a future ... in which no person is
left behind and in which no community is forgotten,'' Cuomo said.
<p>
   Under Cisneros, HUD encouraged greater home ownership and
developed partnerships with home-building groups such as Habitat
for Humanity International.
<p>
   HUD, long known as a bloated bureaucracy, also slimmed down,
reducing its payroll from 13,500 employees in 1993 to 10,400 now.
By the year 2000, HUD is to have a workforce of 7,500.
<p>
   The agency accelerated demolition of massive urban housing
projects that Cisneros admitted had failed to relieve the poverty
and social difficulties of the urban poor and minorities who lived
in them.
<p>
   But GOP lawmakers in Congress called for more radical measures,
including repeal of the Housing Act of 1937, the New Deal-era
legislation underlying much of the federal government's involvement
in urban housing. The legislation was sidetracked last year but
Republican senators on Wednesday hinted it could be revived this
year.
<p>
   Cuomo demurred when asked his view on repealing the 1937 law,
saying there were more than 600 references to it in other
legislation and the agency would have to study the possible
aftershocks of such a massive overhaul.
<p>
   D'Amato and other Republicans challenged Cuomo on how HUD would
handle an impending crisis in funding the agency's Section 8 rental
assistance program, which gives rent vouchers to poor tenants in
public housing or subsidies to landlords of private units.
<p>
   According to a chart prepared by the committee staff, the cost
of renewing the rental assistance contracts will rise from $3.6
billion this year to an estimated $16.4 billion by 2002, even as
HUD's $19.5 billion budget will continue to shrink.
<p>
   Cuomo said handling the crunch is a matter of ``making tough
budget choices.''
<p>
   Nevertheless, he said, government has to recognize that failure
to renew at least a portion of the contracts would result in
``displacing families.''

<p>
   Buenos Aires, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Argentine stocks fell as
investors, encouraged by excess demand at today's government sale
of $2 billion of bonds, sold shares to buy bonds.
<p>
   ``They saw more profit potential in bonds on the back of the
government sale,'' said Maximiliano Goff, an equity markets analyst
at Banco Rio de la Plata.
<p>
   Demand at today's bond sale, the biggest ever by Argentina, was
three times the amount of bonds on offer.
<p>
   The Merval index of the 24 most-traded shares fell 1.03 percent
to 679.47, while the general index slipped 0.8 percent to
19,636.18.
<p>
   Of the 73 issues traded, 22 rose, 37 declined and 14 closed
unchanged. Volume fell to 17.4 million pesos from 23.6 million
pesos yesterday.
<p>
   The biggest loser was oil and gas producer Astra Capsa, down
2.56 percent to 1.9 pesos. Perez Companc SA, another oil and gas
company, fell 1.7 percent to 7.22 pesos. h The country's other
major oil and gas company, YPF SA, fell 0.35 percent to 28 pesos.
<p>
   Among stocks widely traded abroad, telephone company Telefonica
de Argentina SA dropped 1.73 percent to 2.83 pesos. Telecom
Argentina Stet-France Telecom SA, another phone company, fell 0.44
percent to 4.52 pesos.

   Rising U.S. interest rates also hurt Argentina stock prices.
<p>
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose to
6.82 percent from 6.78 percent yesterday as Wall Street firms
struggled to sell $17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought at
today's Treasury auction and prepared for another auction tomorrow.
<p>
   Rising bond yields can draw investors away from emerging
equities markets like Argentina.
<p>
   ``Stocks felt the lack of support from the strong inflow of
foreign funds that has been a feature in recent weeks,'' said Goff.
<p>
   Only three companies included in the Merval index rose.
<p>
   Pulp and paper company Celulosa Argentina SA rose 1.56 percent
to 0.26 pesos, oil and public services company Sociedad Comercial
del Plata SA gained 1.4 percent to 2.7 pesos and IRSA Inversiones y
Representaciones SA, a real estate company in which hedge fund
manager George Soros is a major shareholder, rose 0.93 percent to
3.23 pesos.
<p>
   Among stocks not included in the Merval index, auto parts
company Mirgor Sacifia soared 10 percent to 20.9 pesos after
winning three contracts to supply vehicle manufacturers with air
conditioning and heating systems.
<p>
   Paint company Colorin Industria de Materiales Sinteticos SA rose
8.33 percent to 1.3 pesos while veterinary drug company Instituto
Rosenbusch SA also rose 8.33 percent to 0.65 pesos.
<p>
   Farm machinery company Agrometal SA rose 7.87 percent to 1.78
pesos on expectations the company's sales will climb as farmers
spend the proceeds of this year's record harvest on new equipment.

<p>
   Bogota, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Colombian stocks fell for a sixth
day amid concern the U.S. would impose trade sanctions to protest
the country's drug trade.
<p>
   ``The tendency is still for prices to fall, and this may
continue a bit more (in coming days),'' said Guillermo Espinosa, a
trader at Correval SA brokerage.
<p>
   The Bogota IBB index fell 23.55 points, or 2.39 percent, to
963.01. Trading volume was 1.79 billion pesos ($1.8 million), down
from the 1996 daily trading average of 2.3 billion pesos. Of the 11
stocks that changed prices, two rose and nine fell.
<p>
   In Medellin, the Ibomed index fell 613.72 points, or 3.9
percent, to 15,103.75. Trading volume was 1.21 billion pesos. Of
the 12 stocks that changed prices, four rose and eight fell.
<p>
   Among movers in Bogota, Bavaria SA fell 8.5 percent to 5,200
pesos. Bancoquia fell 7.9 percent to 2,423 pesos. Cadenalco SA fell
5.6 percent to 850 pesos, and Coltabaco fell 8.4 percent to 3,500
pesos.
<p>
   In Medellin, the main movers included Noel SA, which fell 8.3
percent to 3,483 pesos. Cia. Nacional Chocolates SA fell 8.5
percent to 8,890 pesos, and Exito SA fell 10 percent to 3,056
pesos.
<p>
   Washington is upset with Colombia for imposing light sentences
on two top leaders of the Cali drug cartel. That could lead to
trade sanctions when Washington issues its annual report on the
global drug trade March 1.
<p>
   The six-day stock slump follows 18 days of increases that sent
the Bogota index soaring 26 percent in peso terms.
<p>
   In New York, Banco Ganadero fell 7/8 to 28 1/4 after the bank
reported net income rose 6 percent in 1996 from 1995, below
expectations.
<p>
   In Bogota, the peso was weaker today, closing at 1,030 pesos to
the dollar, compared with 1,023 pesos yesterday.

   New York, Jan.. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Bancorp reported higher
fourth-quarter earnings as lending surged, while slow loan growth
and a variety of charges ate into profits at CoreStates Financial
Corp., Comerica Inc. and Great Western Financial Corp..
<p>
   CoreStates net income rose 1.7 percent, and Comerica earnings
fell 43 percent to cover the cost of plans to boost profit by
eliminating 1,890 jobs. U.S. Bancorp profit rose 9 percent, while
Great Western, the second-largest U.S. thrift, said earnings fell
14 percent.
<p>
   The earnings roughly met Wall Street analysts' expectations,
helping send their stocks higher.
<p>
   ``They've come in at exactly what we're looking for,'' said John
Laupheimer, a portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial
Services, a big bank stock investor.
<p>
   The earnings show how U.S. banks and thrifts are trying to boost
profit by cutting costs and buying competitors. The acquisition of
West One Bancorp allowed U.S. Bancorp to cut expanses, while
CoreStates benefited from the purchase of rival Meridian Bancorp.
<p>
   Like Comerica, Great Western recorded charges tied to a plan to
cut 800 jobs and revamp its lagging mortgage business.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based CoreStates said net income rose to $195.5
million, or 91 cents a share, from $192.1 million or 87 cents a
share. The earnings were slightly below Wall Street's expectations
of 94 cents a share. The stock rose 1 1/8 to 52 5/8.
<p>
   Before charges tied to merger with Meridian, earnings rose 2.8
percent to $201.6 million, or 93 cents a share, from $196.1
million, or 89 cents.
<p>
   Revenue fell 1.3 percent to $761.5 million from $771.9 million.
Net interest income fell 2.0 percent as net interest margin
declined to 5.51 percent form 5.56 percent.
<p>
   Great Western said earnings before charges and gains fell to $85
million, or 58 cents a share, from $98.6 million, or 66 cents, in
the last three months of 1995. After the charges and gains, the
Chatsworth, California- based thrift reported earnings of $5.13
million, or 1 cent a share.
<p>
   The results exceeded analysts' expectations of 56 cents a share,
and Great Western shares rose 5/8 to 32 1/8.
<p>
   Net interest income fell 4.5 percent to $335.0 million, as
revenue from mortgage-backed securities fell. Noninterest income
rose 7.2 percent to $114.1 million, as fees from retail banking
surged
<p>
   Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp said net income rose to $120
million, or 79 cents per share, from profit from operations of
$110.5 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier. After
acquisition-related charges, net income in the last three months of
1995 was $21.38 million, or 13 cents a share.
<p>
   The earnings met Wall Street's expectations of 79 cents a share,
and U.S. Bancorp shares rose 1/8 to 45 1/4.
<p>
   Total revenue rose 8.5 percent to $515.6 million, as the bank
raised more fees from customers and paid less for funds.
<p>
   Noninterest expenses fell 2.5 percent to $289.9 million, as
employees salaries and benefits were little changed. Before merger
costs, expenses were down 10 percent.
<p>
   Detroit-based Comerica bank took a $90 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for job cuts and other restructuring
moves designed to boost revenue, cut costs and avoid being taken
over.
<p>
   Comerica announced the steps as it reported fourth-quarter
profit from operations rose 14 percent to $121 million, or $1.06 a
share -- a penny shy of Wall Street expectations.
<p>
   Comerica shares were unchanged at 56 1/4.
<p>
   Net interest income rose 3.6 percent to $353.3 million, while
noninterest income fell 5.8 percent to $132.4 million.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate confirmed
former Sen. William Cohen as secretary of defense, putting a
Republican in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet.
<p>
   The Senate's 99-to-0 vote to confirm Cohen today came after the
nominee received unanimous support from his former colleagues on
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
<p>
   Clinton's choice of Cohen, a moderate Republican from Maine, for
the top defense post represented as an olive branch to Congress,
which is controlled by Republicans eager to increase spending on
weapons.
<p>
   Cohen, responding to questions from the Armed Services panel,
said the U.S. needs ``to increase procurement spending as rapidly
as possible,'' though that will be difficult given overall budget
constraints. He said replacing aging weapons systems is a top
priority.
<p>
   Earlier today, committee Republicans praised Cohen, with Arizona
Sen. John McCain citing his ``personal and very deep friendship''
with the former senator and Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe calling him
``a powerful and persuasive voice of reason.''
<p>
   And the panel's ranking Democrat, Carl Levin of Michigan,
commended Clinton for ``his willingness to reach across party lines
to select a creative and independent thinker.''
<p>
   Cohen was the second of Clinton's second-term Cabinet nominees
to be confirmed without opposition today. Earlier this afternoon,
senators confirmed Madeline Albright as the first woman secretary
of state.
<p>
   Cohen takes the helm of the Defense Department at a time when
the outcome of this year's round of spending decisions is pretty
much known. Clinton, in his Feb. 6 budget request, likely will seek
$258.8 billion for defense, about $9 billion less that the $268
billion Congress has already recommended. Republicans have the
votes to add several billion dollars of the extra money they seek.
<p>
   Democrats and Republicans agree that the military, after years
of shrinking budgets in the wake of the Cold War's end, now needs
to replace or upgrade aging weapons and other equipment.
<p>
   ``We must not lose sight of the fact,'' Cohen said today, that
the purpose of the military force structure ``is to ensure that our
armed forces can fight and win a nation's wars.''
<p>
   Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, however, used the Armed
Services panel's confirmation hearing to blast 12 years of defense
spending cuts.
<p>
   ``We must work to cut unnecessary waste from the defense
budget,'' Coats said, ``but I do not believe that haphazard
reduction is appropriate.''
<p>
   Some major decisions on weapons purchases, such as starting to
develop a multi-billion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter, the purchase
of F/A-18 E/F fighters from McDonnell Douglas Corp., and
commissioning of a Seawolf nuclear submarine from General Dynamics
Corp.'s Electric Boat Division at Groton, Connecticut, have been
resolved.
<p>
   Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. were chosen in November to
compete for the Joint Strike Fighter, and the program, which could
cost at least $100 billion during the next three decades, is
certain to draw special congressional scrutiny.
<p>
   Cohen endorsed the strike fighter, saying ``joint development
and procurement efforts make a lot of sense'' by eliminating
duplication of weapons among the military branches.
<p>
   Cohen also endorsed Pentagon purchases of anti-missile systems,
both to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic
attacks -- a national defense system -- and to protect troops
engaged in battles around the world, called Theater Missile
Defense. In the current military budget for the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, Congress provided $3.5 billion for ballistic missile
defense. Companies working on the missile defense program include
Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Co., General Motors Corp., and
Rockwell International Corp. In addition, Lockheed Martin is
authorized to receive $277.8 million for the Army's Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense System.
<p>
   Cohen said the Persian Gulf War demonstrated the wisdom of
``applying coordinated air power to attack the enemy using
precision munitions and stealth aircraft.'' According to Cohen,
``many of our newest systems performed better than expected'' in
the Gulf War.
<p>
   While Cohen didn't mention specific aircraft used in the Gulf
War, a major stealth fighter is Lockheed Martin's F-117.
<p>
   Smaller Pentagon budgets have shrunk the number of players in
the defense contracting industry, with Raytheon Co. buying General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes defense business for $9.5 billion and Boeing
Co. announcing that it'll buy McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $13.3
billion in stock. That transaction would make Seattle-based Boeing
a pre-eminent defense contractor.
<p>
   Such mergers are ``an inevitable result of the defense (weapons)
procurement budget dropping more than 60 percent in real terms in
the last 10 years,'' Cohen said. While he said he doesn't oppose
consolidation in the industry, he said the Pentagon ``should
continue to monitor this situation carefully.''
<p>
   The Pentagon ``is conducting a thorough review of proposed
mergers and acquisitions in the defense industry'' with the aim of
ensuring that ``adequate price and technical competition is
maintained for major weapons systems procurements,'' he said.
<p>
   While the department ``should not encourage specific
corporations to consolidate,'' Cohen said, the Pentagon may profit
from takeovers ``to the extent that consolidation reduces excess
capacity'' in defense-industry plants, because that could ``make
defense companies more efficient and save the taxpayers money.''

<p>
   East Rutherford, New Jersey, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- New York
Giants head coach Jim Fassel named former Oakland Raiders assistant
John Fox defensive coordinator.
<p>
   Fassel, who has a reputation as an offensive expert, said when
he was hired that picking a defensive coordinator would be a
``critical'' decision.
<p>
   Fox, a seven-year NFL coaching veteran, was the Raiders'
defensive coordinator from 1994-95 before leaving the team prior to
the 1996 campaign. He spent this past season as a consultant with
the St. Louis Rams.
<p>
   Fassel, hired by the Giants last week to replace Dan Reeves,
worked with Fox in 1995 when he was quarterbacks coach for the
Raiders.
<p>
   ``It was important to me that I hire someone that I've had some
experience with and someone who I've seen operate as a
coordinator,'' said Fassel, who served as the Arizona Cardinals
offensive coordinator in 1996 before taking the Giants job.
<p>
   ``John brings with him a wealth of experience and knowledge, and
the right kind of personality that I want in a defensive
coordinator,'' Fassel said.
<p>
   Before joining the Raiders, Fox spent two seasons as the San
Diego Chargers defensive backs coach from 1992-93.
<p>
   He began his NFL coaching career with the Pittsburgh Steelers,
where he worked as the team's secondary coach from 1989 to 1991.
The Steelers had the NFL's top-ranked pass defense in 1990 under
Fox.
<p>
   Fox spent three years as defensive coordinator and secondary
coach at the University of Pittsburgh before moving to the NFL. He
was also coached the secondary at Boise State, Long Beach State,
Utah, Kansas and Iowa State and was an assistant at United States
International University and San Diego State.
<p>
   Terms of Fox's contract with the Giants weren't disclosed.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. bonds fell as Wall Street
firms struggled to sell the $17.5 billion of two-year notes they
bought from the Treasury, and prepared for another auction
tomorrow.
<p>
   The Treasury sold its notes at a yield of 5.984 percent, less
than the 6 percent yield traders anticipated just before the sale.
The issue recently yielded 6.01 percent.
<p>
   Wall Street ``paid too much'' for the notes, said Rob McCool, a
trader at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.
<p>
   The lower-than-expected yield at the sale ``doesn't mean the
auction went well,'' because securities firms can't sell the bonds
for as much as they paid the government for them, said Mark
Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities Inc. Making the sale more
difficult is the Treasury's sale of $12.5 billion of five-year
notes tomorrow.
<p>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, little changed prior to the
1 p.m. Eastern time sale, slumped 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000
bond, pushing its yield up 5 basis points to 6.83 percent, the
highest in nine days.
<p>
   Securities firms had an easier time finding buyers for the $2
billion of 20-year global bonds Argentina sold today, as investors
hungry for higher yields snapped up the securities.
<p>
   The country sold the bonds at a yield of 11.375 percent, or
462.5 basis points more than U.S. government debt. That's better
than the 500 basis point difference underwriters expected less than
a week ago. Global bonds are sold simultaneously around the world
and trade 24-hours a day.
<p>
   Bond investors, faced with low yields and high prices in many
other parts of the world, ``have got to buy high-yield and emerging
markets debt,'' said Carl Ericson, head of $6 billion in taxable
fixed income at Colonial Advisory Services in Boston. Argentina has
``to make hay while the sun shines.''
<p>
   Bond investors failed to take much comfort from a government
report showing a drop in new home starts and a Federal Reserve
study suggesting the economy is still growing with little
inflation. Instead they fretted about demand for all the new
Treasury debt.
<p>
   With all the supply, ``people have got a pretty bearish
viewpoint right now,'' said David Hoffman, who manages $300 million
in bonds at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Delaware.
<p>
   Wall Street firms often push yields higher before the Treasury
sells debt to try to stir up demand from investors.
<p>
   ``The reaction to the two-year is burdened by the prospect of
more supply coming in the pipeline,'' said Tony Crescenzi, a trader
at Miller Tabak Hirsch &AMP; Co. ``Even with good results, the market
is not trading well off them,'' he said.
<p>
   Traders said comments from Fed Governor Susan Phillips in a
Market News interview hurt bonds earlier in the day. Phillips
suggested that the Fed might not wait for a rise in the core
consumer price index before boosting rates.
<p>
   ``Phillips' comments were extremely bearish. They lend support
to the believers who think that the Fed will still have to
tighten,'' or raise rates, said Todd Speiser, a trader at Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The Fed hasn't changed bank lending rates since January 1996,
when it cut the so-called federal funds target by a quarter of a
percentage point to 5.25 percent. The Fed's policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee next meets on Feb. 4-5.
<p>
   Bonds got only a brief fillip after the government reported a
bigger-than-expected drop in December housing starts.
<p>
   The Commerce Department said housing starts fell by 12.2 percent
in December to an annual rate of 1.329 million. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News on average expected a decline of 2.8 percent. For
the year starts of new houses rose 8.8 percent to 1.474 million,
the highest in eight years.
<p>
   ``By and large the numbers tell me the economy is not going
gangbusters and not falling off a cliff and that's what (Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan) said in his testimony,'' to the Senate
Budget Committee yesterday, said Robert Alley, who manages about
$2.5 billion at AIM Advisors Inc. in Houston.
<p>
   That should help temper concern that the Fed will soon raise
borrowing rates, some investors said.
<p>
   ``The Fed's likely to be on hold,'' said Alley, who's been
buying bonds lately as he receives cash in his fund. ``We're adding
bonds.''
<p>
   The Fed's study of regional economic activity, commonly known as
the beige book, found only ``scattered evidence'' that the robust
U.S. job market is pushing wages higher. It found no signs that
consumer prices are rising at a faster pace, with the exception of
energy prices.
<p>
   ``It more or less confirms the general impression that the
economy has picked up steam and that things are chugging along with
little threat of inflation,'' said Robert McGee, chief economist at
Tokai Bank.
<p>
   The study is based on anecdotal evidence of business conditions
compiled by the Fed's 12 district banks. The report was
inadvertently released ahead of schedule on the Internet.
<p>
   At today's yield of 6.54 percent, U.S. 10-year notes yield 415
basis points more than the 2.39 percent yield on the No. 182
benchmark 10-year Japanese bond, 6 basis points more than a week
ago.
<p>
   U.S. debt now yields 82 basis points more than the 5.72 percent
yield on 10-year German bonds, 6 basis points more than last week.
<p>
   The benchmark five-year U.S. dollar swap spread widened 2 basis
points to 26 basis points. The spread is the difference between the
yield on the benchmark Treasury and the highest rate at which a
``AAA''-rated corporation can sell its fixed-rate bonds, if it
wants to do a swap that leaves it paying no more than the London
interbank offered rate.
<p>
   Corporations use interest-rate and currency swaps to guard
against changes in the value of their outstanding debt and to cut
their borrowing costs. The banks and securities firms that provide
these swaps often buy or sell U.S. Treasuries to hedge the risk of
sudden swings in interest rates.
<p>
   Among the U.S.-based issuers to take advantage of the strong
demand today for corporate debt was Salomon Inc., which sold $500
million of seven-year notes. NationsBank Corp. also $500 million of
securities.
<p>
   More than $3.5 billion in corporate securities were sold.
<p>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was the largest
issuer in the municipal market, selling $300 million in a two-part
offering. About $900 million in new tax-exempt bonds were priced
today.
<p>
   About $77.4 billion in Treasuries traded through most of the
major bond brokers as of 3:00 p.m. Eastern time, according to
GovPX, Inc., a bond pricing service. That was about 11 percent
below average for a Wednesday in the first quarter of last year,
the service said.
<p>
   The so-called basis, which reflects the difference between the
current 30-year bond and the March futures contract, widened 3 to
at 115/32, or 3 19/32 points.
<p>
   The three-month bill's discount rate was little changed at 5.03
percent, a bond-equivalent yield of 5.16 percent. The six-month
bill's discount rate was also little changed at 5.10 percent, a
bond-equivalent yield of 5.30 percent. The one-year bill's discount
rate rose 1 basis point to 5.29 percent, a bond-equivalent yield of
5.57 percent.
<p>
   The three-year note fell 2/32 to 99 12/32, a yield of 6.12
percent. The five-year note fell 3/32 to 99 07/32, a yield of 6.31
percent. The 10-year note fell 1/4 to 99 21/32, a yield of 6.54
percent.
<p>
   The March Treasury bill contract was unchanged at 94.92, and the
March Eurodollar contract was unchanged at 94.38.
<p>
   The gap between the two, the so-called TED spread, was little
changed at 54 basis points. The TED spread is an indication of
investor confidence in the U.S. financial system.

   Caracas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) Venezuela's government said it will
draw the line for public worker salary raises at 25 percent despite
concern that continuing labor strikes will ignite a chain of
demands for higher raises, officials said.
<p>
   Venezuela has budgeted the increase, setting it to year-ahead
inflation targets, said Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar.
<p>
   Further increases would derail inflation-fighting efforts, he
said. ``I refuse to play that role, promising workers something
that I don't stand for,'' said Matos Azocar.
<p>
   Public sector doctors got a nearly 200 percent raise Monday by
striking nationwide. Public university professors are striking,
demand a doubling of salaries to match last year's 103 percent
inflation.
<p>
   As a result, other public labor unions may not be satisfied with
25 percent.
<p>
   The government has budgeted 1.2 trillion ($2.5 billion) for the
raises, due in the coming months.
<p>
   More than 800,000 people are employed by the federal government
and another 500,000 by state and city administrations. for a total
of 1.3 billion.

   Boston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments said bond
fund manager Bob Ives resigned because he doesn't want to relocate
to New Hampshire where the No. 1 U.S. fund group is moving its
fixed-income division in August.
<p>
   Ives, 34, managed more than $1.45 billion in fixed-income
funds,including the $955 million Fidelity Government Securities
Fund. He joined Fidelity in 1991 after graduating with a master's
degree in business from the University of Chicago. He is the 18th
fund manager to leave Fidelity in the past year.
<p>
   Fidelity announced in December that it plans to move its entire
bond and money market investment groups to Merrimack, New
Hampshire, in an effort to reduce costs. Merrimack is 47 miles
north of Boston.
<p>
   Ives is the second Fidelity bond fund manager to announce his
resignation this month. The other is Michael Gray, who managed
almost $10 billion in assets for Fidelity. --Tim Quinson in Boston

<p>
   Dying at home, surrounded by warm memories and familiar faces,
is what many elderly people wish for. They want to leave this world
in a natural and peaceful way, without being forced to live on
unnaturally supported by medical treatment.
<p>
   Their wishes have often been trampled on in this country, with
many people dying in a dreary hospital ward far away from their
homes. Many are subjected to invasive treatments that they have no
wish to undergo.
<p>
   In extreme instances, people have even died because of
negligence at care facilities or through secondary infections
passed on in hospitals.
<p>
   But the situation is gradually changing. Groups examining the
state of home care for the elderly are being established across the
country. The National Council of Social Welfare will soon release a
report that describes special nursing homes that provide care for
the ailing elderly.
<p>
   Amid these changes, a controversy has erupted over an affair at
a nursing home in Kyoto. When an old woman, attached to a feeding
tube because she was severely physically impaired and could no
longer take in the liquid food, her doctor switched the liquid to a
sports drink.
<p>
   Critics question the doctor's judgment in removing a nourishing
liquid and replacing it with a simple sports drink without first
ascertaining the woman's wishes.
<p>
   In some people's view, dying with dignity will only become
possible if the use of artificial respirators and feeding tubes is
stopped. But the matter is not as simple as all that.
<p>
   The way one scholar lived his last months before dying late last
year heralds a new age.
<p>
   When in hospital after being paralyzed on one side of his body
by a stroke, he was unable to swallow food or to speak: the typical
image of a ``vegetable.''
<p>
   But when he finally returned home and was wheeled into his
study, what no one had expected came about. Slowly, he started to
tap keys on his word processor with one finger of his right hand.
On subsequent days, the scholar spent several hours typing each
day.
<p>
   In the summer of 1995, he typed these words:
<p>
   ``I do not want an artificial respirator to be attached to me,
but I would like to know what other people think. I hate the
machine. Please print this part and make arrangements to mail it by
special delivery to Dr. Sato.''
<p>
   Dr. Akira Sato, the man's chief physician, leads a group of
doctors who support home medical care for the elderly.
<p>
   In response to the patient's desires, he sent back a document
that clearly stated that the doctor understood the man did not want
to be hooked to a respirator, outlined the care that would be
provided at the end and pledged that he would do as the scholar
wished.
<p>
   Reading the document letter by letter, the scholar smiled
broadly at the physician's assurances and signed it.
<p>
   Death  &MD;  a peaceful death surrounded by family members  &MD;  came a
year and five months later. Teamwork among the doctor, nurses,
public helpers, and family made a death with dignity possible for
the scholar.
<p>
   At the Sakura-en Special Nursing Home in Yokohama, it is up to
inmates to decide where they want to die. Forty percent choose to
die at Sakura-en. But no one asks them outright about their
decisions.
<p>
   When someone dies at the nursing home, all other patients
assemble for a wake in the dining hall. They talk about their
memories of the deceased as the person's body is laid out for
viewing, surrounded by flowers and with his or her favorite music
playing in the background. Neighborhood children, who often come to
play at the home, join in the ceremonial farewell.
<p>
   After attending the wake, the patients talk about where they
want to die. Listening to their conversations, home officials
arrange for them to die according to their wishes.
<p>
   In other countries where the population is living longer lives,
measures have been established that enable people to die peacefully
and in a manner that meets their wishes.
<p>
   These measures include setting up a system of visiting nurses,
doctors and public helpers that makes it possible for the elderly
to spend their last days at home.
<p>
   Written instructions from the patient concerning the manner of
his or her death (called a ``living will'') and company-sanctioned
paid leave to care for dying family members are other compassionate
advances.
<p>
   It is said that a truly affluent society is one in which
everyone can die a peaceful death. We hope the first steps to
create such a society will be taken this year in Japan.  &LR;

Chicago, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
through a new subsidiary, tomorrow will begin trading currency
futures during off hours in hopes of increasing volume when the
trading pits are closed.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The CME, acting through the new Globex Foreign Exchange
Facility, will act as a buyer and seller of currency futures
contracts on the after-hours electronic trading system called
Globex.
<p>
   GFX initially will trade British pounds, German marks, Japanese
yen and Swiss francs.
<p>
   ``There will never be a time when someone who wants to make a
trade won't find a viable and deep bid and offer provided by the
GFX,'' Merc Chairman Jack Sandner said.
<p>
   CME traders will make offsetting transactions in the underlying
market to minimize the exchange's risk.
<p>
   GFX, which will clear trades through a CME clearing member firm,
will post bids and offers between $1 million and $3 million, based
on conditions in the foreign exchange market. Larger trades are
possible, though not guaranteed.
<p>
   Globex, a computer system for off-hours trading, is a joint
venture between the CME, the Marche a Terme International de France
and Reuters Holdings Plc. Reuters competes with Bloomberg News in
providing news and information.

<p>
   TOKYO  &MD;  In Sapporo, winter boots must do for pedestrians what
winter's snow tires do for cars  &MD;  get a grip on streets slick with
ice.
<p>
   Slippery streets are a perennial winter hazard here,
particularly since 1991, when the national Environment Agency
banned spiked snow tires.
<p>
   The spikes tore up the asphalt surface, creating irritating dust
clouds, but the studless tires that replaced them do a disservice
of their own: they buff the snow and ice to a skating-rink-smooth
sheen known locally as ``mirror burn,'' a worse foe than the
somewhat less treacherous ``ice burn'' or black ice often found on
snowy highways.
<p>
   And so the competition is on to develop a shoe that will not
slip on ice. New footwear appearing this winter features rubber
soles fortified with such novelties as foam rubber, sand, hemp and
walnut shells.
<p>
   Regal Corp., a leading shoe manufacturer, this winter introduced
its ``Corobannsho'' shoe  &MD;  a catchy adaptation of ``korobanai
desho,'' meaning ``you won't fall.''
<p>
   A men's shoe sold only in Hokkaido, Corobannsho has a sole of
notched foam rubber that rakes the treacherous ice surface.
<p>
   Interestingly enough, Corobannsho was the brainchild not of
Regal's product development division but of its Sapporo
salespeople, who knew all about mirror burn firsthand and were
eager to do something about it.
<p>
   Last year the sportswear maker Asics came out with its own
answer to mirror burn: ``Ice Walk'' shoes, whose soles are laced
with sand. Ice Walk footwear comes in both men's and ladies'
styles.
<p>
   Whether the key ingredient is foam rubber or walnut shells,
nonslip shoe technology takes its cue from the earlier competition
to produce the ideal studless tire.
<p>
   The foam rubber that Corobannsho uses, for example, is based on
the principle developed by the tire maker Bridgestone for its
studless tire.
<p>
   The Regal salespeople who devised Corobannsho, in fact, spent a
good deal of time at the library analyzing the literature on
studless tire design. And the walnut shell idea was borrowed from
the studless tire made by Toyo Rubber.
<p>
   Driving the connection home are the posters that stores are
using to push their ice-clutching shoes. They show  &MD;  you guessed it
 &MD;  studless tires. The competition among the various shoe brands
looks rather like a studless tire proxy war.
<p>
   Mirror burn is a perfect example of a solution to one problem
unexpectedly generating another problem. With the dust-causing
spikes now almost entirely replaced by studless tires, skating-rink
streets are turning up all over the city.
<p>
   Just how tough a time of it pedestrians are having is reflected
in recent statistics showing the number of falls resulting in
hospitalization.
<p>
   In the winter of 1990-91, just before the spiked tire ban went
into effect, 375 people had to be taken to hospital by ambulance
after slipping on ice. The next year that figure shot up to 710. In
1995 it was 756.
<p>
   City officials warn against expecting a miracle cure for the
problem.
<p>
   ``Apart from spreading antifreeze or sand, there's not much we
can do,'' says Takao Goto, director of Sapporo snow removal
operations.
<p>
   Though spiked tires are banned, spike-shoe soles are not, and in
fact many shoe brands still feature metal spikes. But, like snow
tires before them, winter shoes are going studless.

   Pittsburgh, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Mylan Laboratories Inc. said
fiscal third-quarter earnings fell 18 percent, as costs rose and
revenue from its Somerset Pharmaceuticals venture dropped.
<p>
   Mylan's net income dropped to $18.1 million, or 15 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $21.9 million, or 18
cents, in the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   Revenue rose 25 percent to $114 million from $91.3 million.
<p>
   The results were below Wall Street expectations. The generic
drugmaker was expected to earn 18 cents a share, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Mylan shares fell 1/4 to 17 3/4 in trading of 653,800, compared
with a three-month daily average of 490,600.
<p>
   Pittsburgh-based Mylan said its cost of sales rose 40 percent to
$66.7 million from $47.6 million. Selling and administrative
expenses increased 34 percent to $97.1 million from $72.7 million.

   TOKYO  &MD;  In Sapporo, winter boots must do for pedestrians what
winter's snow tires do for cars  &MD;  get a grip on streets slick with
ice.
<p>
   Slippery streets are a perennial winter hazard here,
particularly since 1991, when the national Environment Agency
banned spiked snow tires.
<p>
   The spikes tore up the asphalt surface, creating irritating dust
clouds, but the studless tires that replaced them do a disservice
of their own: they buff the snow and ice to a skating-rink-smooth
sheen known locally as ``mirror burn,'' a worse foe than the
somewhat less treacherous ``ice burn'' or black ice often found on
snowy highways.
<p>
   And so the competition is on to develop a shoe that will not
slip on ice. New footwear appearing this winter features rubber
soles fortified with such novelties as foam rubber, sand, hemp and
walnut shells.
<p>
   Regal Corp., a leading shoe manufacturer, this winter introduced
its ``Corobannsho'' shoe  &MD;  a catchy adaptation of ``korobanai
desho,'' meaning ``you won't fall.''
<p>
   A men's shoe sold only in Hokkaido, Corobannsho has a sole of
notched foam rubber that rakes the treacherous ice surface.
<p>
   Interestingly enough, Corobannsho was the brainchild not of
Regal's product development division but of its Sapporo
salespeople, who knew all about mirror burn firsthand and were
eager to do something about it.
<p>
   Last year the sportswear maker Asics came out with its own
answer to mirror burn: ``Ice Walk'' shoes, whose soles are laced
with sand. Ice Walk footwear comes in both men's and ladies'
styles.
<p>
   Whether the key ingredient is foam rubber or walnut shells,
nonslip shoe technology takes its cue from the earlier competition
to produce the ideal studless tire.
<p>
   The foam rubber that Corobannsho uses, for example, is based on
the principle developed by the tire maker Bridgestone for its
studless tire.
<p>
   The Regal salespeople who devised Corobannsho, in fact, spent a
good deal of time at the library analyzing the literature on
studless tire design. And the walnut shell idea was borrowed from
the studless tire made by Toyo Rubber.
<p>
   Driving the connection home are the posters that stores are
using to push their ice-clutching shoes. They show  &MD;  you guessed it
 &MD;  studless tires. The competition among the various shoe brands
looks rather like a studless tire proxy war.
<p>
   Mirror burn is a perfect example of a solution to one problem
unexpectedly generating another problem. With the dust-causing
spikes now almost entirely replaced by studless tires, skating-rink
streets are turning up all over the city.
<p>
   Just how tough a time of it pedestrians are having is reflected
in recent statistics showing the number of falls resulting in
hospitalization.
<p>
   In the winter of 1990-91, just before the spiked tire ban went
into effect, 375 people had to be taken to hospital by ambulance
after slipping on ice. The next year that figure shot up to 710. In
1995 it was 756.
<p>
   City officials warn against expecting a miracle cure for the
problem.
<p>
   ``Apart from spreading antifreeze or sand, there's not much we
can do,'' says Takao Goto, director of Sapporo snow removal
operations.
<p>
   Though spiked tires are banned, spike-shoe soles are not, and in
fact many shoe brands still feature metal spikes. But, like snow
tires before them, winter shoes are going studless.

<p>
   You don't have to go to New Orleans to bring the flavor of the
Super Bowl's host city to your party on Sunday.
<p>
   Just grab a small bottle of Tabasco pepper sauce and add
judicious amounts while preparing such traditional buffet dishes as
shrimp or chicken drumsticks. If you do, you'll be using the same
condiment as folks eating their pregame meals on Bourbon Street in
the French Quarter.
<p>
   Before hot sauce became an industry unto itself, with many malls
now featuring a shop that offers only hot sauce, there was Tabasco
pepper sauce by the McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, La. It is,
without a doubt, the zesty precursor to today's burgeoning hot
sauce industry.
<p>
   Nowadays, of course, there are so many hot sauces to choose from
it can be overwhelming to know which sauce to select. At a local
shop, there are more than 300 varieties of hot sauces, salsas and
mustards available.
<p>
   But if you want to pick out just one hot sauce with the piquant
flavor synonymous with New Orleans, try old-fashioned Tabasco
pepper sauce. It is versatile without being overpowering, yet a
little bit goes a long way. After all, how old is that bottle of
Tabasco sauce on your shelf?
<p>
   The McIlhenny Co. is located deep in the heart of Cajun country,
about 45 minutes south of Lafayette near Morgan City. It has been
producing Tabasco pepper sauce for more than 125 years.
<p>
   Avery Island, the company's home and a popular tourist
destination, is one of five small islands that rise above the flat
bayou country of Louisiana's Gulf Coast. The island's perimeter is
made up of deep salt springs, which add richness to the soil and
marshes.
<p>
   Tabasco pepper sauce has made its presence known throughout the
20th century. In 1922, a bottle was shown in a photograph of the
mess table during a halt in the excavation of King Tut's tomb in
Egypt. An intact bottle of Tabasco pepper sauce was recovered from
the 859-foot-long flying aircraft carrier, USS Macon, the largest
airship ever built, which plunged into 1,800 feet of water off
Point Sur, Calif., on Feb. 12, 1935.
<p>
   On several Himalayan climbs, Tabasco pepper sauce reportedly
served as a cherished reward for the Sherpas, the native guides who
have been reported to use an entire bottle at one sitting. And when
astronauts aboard the Skylab space station found their food bland
and uninteresting, NASA sent up Tabasco pepper sauce.
<p>
   To easily spice up your Super Bowl party with the flavor of
Cajun country, try some of the following recipes, all courtesy of
the McIlhenny Co.:
<p>
   (Serves eight)
<p>
    &MD;  Eight pounds pork spare ribs, cut into two-rib portions.
<p>
    &MD;  Two-thirds cup light molasses.
<p>

<p>
    &MD;  Three tablespoons prepared mustard.
<p>
    &MD;  Two tablespoons Tabasco pepper sauce.
<p>
   In large saucepan over high heat, heat to boiling the ribs and
enough water to cover. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 45
minutes or until ribs are tender. Drain.
<p>
   In medium bowl, combine molasses, balsamic vinegar, mustard and
Tabasco sauce.
<p>
   Preheat broiler. Place ribs on rack in broiling pan; brush with
some sauce. With ribs about seven to nine inches from source of
heat, broil them 15 minutes until heated through, turning ribs
occasionally and brushing often with sauce.
<p>
    &UR; --- &LR; 
<p>
   (Serves eight)
<p>
    &MD;  One-half cup butter or margarine (one stick).
<p>

<p>
    &MD;  One teaspoon salt 16 chicken drumsticks (about four pounds).
<p>
    &MD;  One cup bottled blue cheese dressing Preheat broiler.
<p>
   In small saucepan over low heat, melt butter or margarine, then
stir in Tabasco sauce, ketchup and salt.
<p>
   Place chicken drumsticks on rack in broiling pan; brush with
some Tabasco mixture. Broil drumsticks seven to nine inches from
heat source for 10 minutes. Turn and brush with remaining Tabasco
mixture. Broil 10 to 15 minutes longer or until drumsticks are
browned and tender.
<p>
   Serve with blue cheese dressing.
<p>
    &UR; --- &LR; 
<p>
   (Serves eight)
<p>
    &MD;  One 16-ounce can refried beans.
<p>
    &MD;  One tablespoon Tabasco pepper sauce.
<p>
    &MD;  Eight flour tortillas (eight inches round).
<p>
    &MD;  One large red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped.
<p>
    &MD;  One-quarter cup chopped cilantro or parsley.
<p>
    &MD;  Eight ounces Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese, shredded.
<p>
   Preheat oven to 450. In medium bowl combine refried beans and
Tabasco sauce to mix well. Spread three tablespoons of the mixture
on a flour tortilla to 1/2 inch of edge; sprinkle with some red
pepper, cilantro and shredded cheese. Repeat process with remaining
seven tortillas. Place tortillas on two large cookie sheets.
<p>
   Bake five minutes, or until cheese is melted and tortillas are
golden around the edges. To serve, cut tortillas into wedges.

   KOBE, Japan  &MD;  Her face remained calm, but 64-year-old Hisako
Kohashi became animated as she described the life she has led since
an earthquake engulfed her home in fire and she was forced to move
into a tiny room that she shares with her older brother.
<p>
   Her voice filled with sadness, frustration and shame.
<p>
   ``The toughest thing about living in a single room with my
brother is changing into fresh clothes,'' said Mrs. Kohashi, one of
about 70,000 people still living in spartan temporary housing two
years after an earthquake tore through this city west of Tokyo.
<p>
   ``Maybe if I'd taken my clothes off for a living I could undress
in front of him,'' she said. ``But I can't, so when I want to
change I send him to the park to pick up rubbish.''
<p>
   After some 6,300 people died on Jan. 17, 1995, in Japan's worst
earthquake in a half-century, there was tremendous sadness but also
great hope and energy among the 1.5 million residents who survived.
<p>
   The 300,000 who sought shelter in schools, parks, temples and
shrines seemed determined to help one another rebuild their lives,
and great progress has been made.
<p>
   More than 200,000 have repaired their old homes and returned to
them or have moved. After toppling in the earthquake, the city's
main, elevated expressway has been rebuilt and was reopened four
months ago.
<p>
   The volume of goods passing through Kobe's rebuilt port is
approaching full capacity. And the city center, which once
resembled a scene from a war, is brimming with shoppers.
<p>
   But for people like Mrs. Kohashi, who still live in
barracks-like compounds and are old, sick or poor  &MD;  sometimes all
three  &MD;  life is getting harder.
<p>
   After two years, public indifference to their plight has grown
and they have suffered setbacks from officials in their fight for
help.
<p>
   People still living in temporary compounds have become a
distinct underclass, aid volunteers and local journalists say.
<p>
   Like the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bombings, survivors of the Kobe earthquake in temporary housing are
often referred to in derogatory slang.
<p>
   Children from the compounds are called prefabricated kids
(kasetsuko) after the prefabricated buildings in which they live
and the compounds, often isolated, are known as mountains of
discarded old women (ubasuteyama).
<p>
   ``People are just waiting for people stuck in the compounds to
die or disappear,'' said Yoshihiro Tsujiuchi, a Buddhist priest who
distributes food and relief supplies.
<p>
   Since the quake, some 200 people living in temporary housing
have died alone and unnoticed. In a case that caused nationwide
outrage, the death of a man suffering from liver disease went
unnoticed for 10 months.
<p>
   People in temporary housing also feel betrayed by the central
government.
<p>
   After vowing to help survivors rebuild, officials in the
national government stymied plans drawn up in Kobe to have Tokyo
pay between 5 million and 17 million yen to those whose homes were
destroyed.
<p>
   Seiroku Kajiyama, the government spokesman who doubles as
minister in charge of earthquake relief, said last fall that the
government had not yet decided whether to pay compensation.
<p>
   The Finance Ministry has allotted $30 billion to rebuild Kobe's
infrastructure but has strongly resisted paying compensation to
survivors, saying that private charity and personal savings should
suffice.
<p>
   ``The government ought to remember who they are rebuilding this
city for,'' said Mrs. Kohashi's brother, Keiji, 70. ``It's supposed
to be for us. Not for the construction industry.''
<p>
   Perhaps a harsher reality for the victims is the inability of
the Kobe city government to build low-rent public housing at the
pace it promised.
<p>
   A prefectural government survey last year found that 70 percent
of the people in compounds hoped to move into such housing. Last
month, however, officials said people would remain in temporary
compounds until around March 2000, two years longer than the
prefecture originally hoped.
<p>
   This angered the people in the compounds.
<p>
   But Norio Aoki, the city official in charge of a 270 billion yen
project to build 3,000 apartments in Kobe, said the slow pace of
construction was unavoidable because of Japan's development laws.
<p>
   Under them, local officials must first find the landowners,
tenants and subtenants with a stake in any land slated for
development and buy those stakes before construction can begin.
<p>
   ``To be perfectly frank, I've no idea how long it will take to
redevelop this area because there are nearly 2,000 people with a
stake in it,'' Mr. Aoki said.
<p>
   The site, in Kobe's Nagata Ward, is where an estimated 300
people died after gas pipes that ruptured in the earthquake caught
fire.
<p>
   This delay comes as little surprise to Mrs. Kohashi and her
brother. Like many made homeless, the Kohashis would like to move
into public housing.
<p>
   The room they share is barely big enough  &MD;  three meters by three
meters  &MD;  to lay out the foldaway mattresses on which they sleep.
They share a kitchen, bath and toilet with 16 others, mainly the
elderly and ill. The situation is made worse by the paralysis in
Mrs. Kohashi's arm that she suffered nine years ago after a stroke.
<p>
   But when Kobe city recently offered them an apartment in a
suburb, they turned it down. Mrs. Kohashi said the apartment was
too far from her doctor.
<p>
   ``I can't go home,'' she said. ``And I can't stand being here.
But moving to a place that's far from public transport, the shops
and my doctor isn't any good either.
<p>
   ``I guess that to the city of Kobe I'm just a piece of lost
baggage.''

elderly and ill. The situation is made worse by the paralysis in
Mrs. Kohashi's arm that she suffered nine years ago after a stroke.

   But when Kobe city recently offered them an apartment in a
suburb, they turned it down. Mrs. Kohashi said the apartment was
too far from her doctor.

   ``I can't go home,'' she said. ``And I can't stand being here.
But moving to a place that's far from public transport, the shops
and my doctor isn't any good either.

<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Tosco Corp. stock
sank on the report of an explosion at one of its refineries last
night, then recovered on better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings, analysts said.
<p>
   Trading was halted briefly on the New York Stock Exchange, and
Tosco shares fell as much as 2 to 89 1/8 after trading resumed
early this morning. Shares closed up 3/8 at 91 1/2. Though poor
refining and marketing results pulled down fourth-quarter earnings
by 11 percent from a year ago, analysts had expected worse.
Earnings were 67 cents a share, and a consensus of 17 analysts
polled by First Call Corp. had predicted 63 cents.
<p>
   ``Earnings were clearly secondary to the situation on the West
Coast with respect to performance of the stock'' early in the day,
said Morgan Stanley analyst Douglas T. Terreson. ``There were some
concerns they would have capacity off the market for some time.''
<p>
   Tosco, the largest operator of convenience stores in the nation,
will be the sixth-largest U.S. refiner after it completes the $1.8
billion purchase of Unocal Corp.'s refineries and gas stations it
announced in November. The company will sell fuel through 5,300 gas
stations and convenience stores nationwide, and be the
third-largest refiner on the West Coast.
<p>
   The explosion took place yesterday at Tosco's 150,000 barrel a
day Avon refinery in Martinez, California, in the San Francisco Bay
area. The company said one worker was killed and 25 injured.
Traders said Tosco had to shut down a hydrocracking unit that makes
gasoline and diesel fuel. West Coast wholesale gasoline prices rose
as a result.
<p>
   Still, Terreson said the portion of the refinery affected by the
explosion represents 3-4 percent of Tosco earnings.
<p>
   ``The worst case is not so bad, and the company is fully
insured,'' he said. ``As that information began being fed into the
market, investors became more comfortable with the stock and began
to buy it.''
<p>
   The company reported that fourth-quarter net income fell to
$30.2 million, or 67 cents, from $33.8 million, or 90 cents. The
per-share drop reflects both the drop in profit and an increase in
Tosco's outstanding shares.
<p>
   Tosco issued shares as part of its $750 million acquisition of
the Circle K Corp. convenience store chain in May. Tosco had 44.9
million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter compared with 37.6
million last year.
<p>
   ``The earnings were fine,'' said Terreson. ``Our estimate was 65
cents a share so it was slightly better than expectations.
Operating results were strong.''
<p>
   Thomas D. O'Malley, Tosco's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, said in a statement that ``refining and marketing margins
were weak throughout the quarter due to the industry's inability to
pass higher crude oil costs on to the consumer. Cold weather in the
East helped Tosco's Bayway Refinery to a certain degree, but
conditions on the West Coast were weak.''
<p>
   Terreson said Morgan Stanley thinks Tosco's stock has continued
room for growth. ``We have a 110 price target for Tosco by 1997,''
he said.

   No visible buttons. No fancy details. No blaring status symbols.
Just a pearl-gray suit with a streamlined silhouette that flowed
from wide lapels through soft pants.
<p>
   It was Gucci's feng shui for fashion: purify, simplify and keep
only what counts.
<p>
   Designer Tom Ford, whose taut, sexy, 1970s silhouette has
defined male cool, moved fast forward in Gucci's fall collection.
The once skinny pants had loosened up  &MD;  to the extent that flares
flopped over the signature square-toed boots.
<p>
   The jackets swept across the chest, always with the buttons
concealed in a fly front. Only open shirt cuffs, a sweater artfully
pouched at one hip or a slim belt disturbed the sleek surface.
<p>
   ``It was about a silhouette change  &MD;  that is why I took all the
details off,'' said Ford, whose military epaulettes, top-stitching
and trademark belts have nourished fashion's copyists.
<p>
   But Gucci had not lost an ounce of sex appeal by adding inches
of fabric. It was a smart show in every sense: modern,
forward-looking, clean in its opening cloud-gray colors, rich in
its textures, luxurious in its simplicity.
<p>
   And although it was a fairly dramatic change to a new, looser
shape, there were sly references to Gucci's hippie past in a madcap
patchwork pants, tie-dye velvets and velvet neckties to die for.
They were worn with rich paisley-pattern silk shirts  &MD;  just one
example of simple items that oozed quality and luxury.
<p>
   With his short, sharp velvet coats and his cobweb-fine sweaters,
Ford defined what is modern in menswear: minimalist shapes with no
extraneous details but built-in enrichment through texture, color
and pattern.
<p>
   You want all that con brio? Try a classic shirt in hot-pink silk
with chocolate-brown velvet pants embossed with Gucci's signature
G's. The ever-hip Ford said after his show that he is now moving
from Paris to swinging-again London.
<p>
   Romeo Gigli was first in with the strokeable velvet suit, the
rich Renaissance colors and the narrow-shouldered, slim-trousered
suit. Hey, he owns that fashion territory. Or at least he did, when
the look seemed subversive and revolutionary in contrast to power
suits.
<p>
   Now every menswear collection serves up velvet tailoring, but it
was nice to see Gigli's again  &MD;  the short velvet coats and skinny
pants in succulent mixes of color like lime green and mallard blue,
ruby red and grass green.
<p>
   Textured effects were new, from the furrowed velvet pants to
shadowy patterns like sunlight cast through stained glass.
<p>
   But where Gigli might have played only with his artistic colors
and the sensual surfaces, he piled on the details: braid outlining
lapels and pockets of a raspberry jacket; a pleat opening down the
backbone of an orange coat or twin folds on a Norfolk jacket; plaid
velvet here, club checks there, with even a different pattern for
the brief, curving vest of a three-piece suit. The ensemble of the
show was indigestible, but individual pieces fine.
<p>
   Some collections define what is out. Since Moschino's show
chased after trends, it inevitably hit some misses  &MD;  like techno
plasticized coats that had their brief fashion moment in the early
1990s.
<p>
   Or urban graffiti (think a brick-wall pattern on a jacket and
scribbles in sequins). Or ski-jackets (smothered with photoprints).
Or those wretched hippies (another comeback for psychedelic daisies
and hobo hat).
<p>
   On target were tactile pants in mock pony or moleskin, the
inevitable velvet, and jersey used for supple cardigan jackets.
<p>
   The irony is that classic now looks hip and sophisticated
fabrics seem much cooler than downtown workwear  &MD;  providing that
the proportions of the clothes and the attitude are modern.
<p>
   For Trussardi, classic is just  &MD;  well  &MD;  classic: the elegant
long coat with broad shoulders and lapels; the country suit in
basket-weave tweed; the moleskin pants with gossamer-fine sweater
or ribbed cardigan.
<p>
   Like many Italian houses, it relies on the quality of fabric and
finish, rather than challenging menswear's status quo.

   Richmond, Virginia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Signet Banking Corp.
said fourth-quarter profit from operations rose 6 percent on
increased lending and service charges.
<p>
   The Richmond, Virginia-based bank said fourth-quarter earnings
rose to $33.6 million, or 55 cents a share, from $9 million, or 15
cents, in the same period in 1995.
<p>
   Not counting a $35 million charge for losses from commercial
loan fraud and earnings from Capital One Corp. before its spin-off
to shareholders in February, 1995, the company said its net income
for the fourth quarter of 1995 was $31.8 million, or 53 cents a
share.
<p>
   Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings were a penny over the average
forecast of 54 cents a share, according to a Zacks Investment
Research survey of 13 analysts. Signet shares rose 3/8 to 30 5/8.
<p>
   ``Targeted commercial and consumer businesses were very well
received in the marketplace,'' said Malcolm McDonald, Signet
chairman and chief executive, in a statement.
<p>
   Net interest income rose 1 percent to $116.7 million. Total
loans rose 12.7 percent to $6.32 billion. Net interest margin, or
the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and earns on
loans, narrowed to 4.56 percent from 4.78 percent.
<p>
   Noninterest income, excluding securities gains, rose 25 percent
to $84.7 million, driven by fees for loan service charges and other
fees.
<p>
   Noninterest expense, excluding the $35 million charge for loan
fraud in 1995, rose 6.9 percent to $125.3 million, as salaries and
benefits increased.
<p>
   The bank increased the amount it sets aside for future loan
losses 60 percent to $29.8 million, though non-performing assets
fell 29 percent to $38.8 million.

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Alexander Lebed was there (though at precisely
who's invitation is a mystery). But la Streisand was not (allegedly
because White House protocol barred her from sharing the Lincoln
bedroom with her beau, James Brolin).
<p>
   There were a record 14 inaugural balls Monday night, but a tenth
of hotel rooms here were unbooked.
<p>
   Admittedly, hopes were high that the sleek, shimmering gown that
Hillary had commissioned from the couturier Oscar de la Renta would
provide the First Lady with a rare fashion success. But Bill's book
of only last September, ``From Hope to History,'' originally priced
at $16.95, is being remaindered off at $5 a throw as part of a
bric-a-brac souvenir package.
<p>
   All of which is to say that when William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd
President of the United States of America, was inaugurated Monday
for a second term, a certain pizzazz was missing from the Yankee
coronation.
<p>
   How different from four years ago, when a modern-minded young
Southerner brimming with ideas retraced the journey of Thomas
Jefferson from Monticello to Washington, and the capital dreamed of
a new Camelot.
<p>
   One reason for the lack of exuberance, inevitably, is that
sequels are rarely as good as the original. The faces are the same,
the policies mostly watered down, and the freshness of a wedding
has given way to the drearier reality of married life. But that
alone does not quite explain the strange mood.
<p>
   The start of Clinton II is a moment of high possibilities but
low expectations.
<p>
   On paper, the stars are aligned for bipartisanship as rarely
before. Once again America's voters have opted for divided
government, telling the two parties, in other words, to cooperate.
<p>
   The Republicans have retained Congress, but are a chastened
bunch, very different from Newt Gingrich's overweening invaders of
January 1995.
<p>
   The President, too, has learned that success lies in moderation,
in courting the ``vital center'' rather than the strident core
constituencies of his Democratic party.
<p>
   But behind the soaring call for national unity and purpose that
Clinton will send forth from the steps of the Capitol today lies
the rancorous reality of the controversy surrounding the Speaker,
Newt Gingrich, which  &MD;  on the House side, at least  &MD;  has turned the
105th Congress into a snake pit before it has done a day of proper
business. Then there is scandal  &MD;  or rather scandals.
<p>
   Some see hope in a ``symmetry of sin''; that the ethical
problems facing the Speaker and the President in a sense cancel
each other out, and will prompt each side to seek a truce.
<p>
   Clinton, after all, is looking for a place in history; Gingrich
for redemption. Both men say they want to balance the budget. Both
have acknowledged, albeit in differing language, that curbs on
middle-class entitlement programs such as Medicare are essential to
achieve this.
<p>
   Both have spoken passionately of the need to tackle that most
intractable of American problems, race relations. Few Republicans
would quarrel with Clinton's two other domestic priorities, of
improving education and ensuring that the welfare reform bill he
reluctantly signed last year works in practice.
<p>
   These indeed are high possibilities  &MD;  though probably even to
achieve all of them would not turn Clinton into a Great President.
<p>
   Only Washington, Lincoln and FDR are generally accorded that
distinction, thanks to the huge challenges that history have given
them: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the Depression and the
defeat of Nazi Germany.
<p>
   Fortunately for Americans, Clinton presides over less
interesting times. But why are expectations so low, and why the
vague foreboding that the best of Clinton has already been seen?
<p>
   Part of the answer is history. Second terms are usually
disappointments, from the arrogance of FDR (though he would
magnificently redeem himself in his third) to the fumbling of
Reagan and the bumbling of Eisenhower, and to the catastrophe of
Richard Nixon.
<p>
   Clinton, runs the conventional wisdom, will have a brief window
of opportunity this year to throw out his famous bridge to the 21st
century. Then he will be rudely shoved aside by the 1998 midterm
election battle, and the 2000 presidential race immediately
thereafter.
<p>
   In fact, the lame-duck theory is less than wholly convincing.
Ronald Reagan made his greatest historical legacy  &MD;  the
breakthrough encounter with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, which led to
reciprocal superpower summits and arms control deals that were the
beginning of the end of the Cold War  &MD;  in his second term, much of
it amid Iran-Contra, a scandal of government far worse than any
bothering Clinton right now.
<p>
   And does he not, aided by Madeleine Albright, his forceful
Secretary of State-designate, have at least an equal opportunity of
shaping world history in his second-term: in the Middle East and
the Balkans, with a post-Cold War accommodation between an expanded
NATO and Russia, and perhaps even an understanding with China?
<p>
   But this overlooks a crucial difference between the two men.
Reagan was trusted. Clinton, despite a best-ever approval rating of
more than 60 percent, still is not.
<p>
   He remains a minority president, elected by the lowest turnout
of voters in three-quarters of a century, as the least bad of the
options available, tolerated rather than loved. All of which makes
the ethical clouds around the White House especially dangerous.
<p>
   Probably none of them will drive Clinton from office. At the
risk of gross oversimplification, a bookie would set out the form
thus.
<p>
   The Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, if the Supreme Court
allows it to proceed, will be squirmingly embarrassing, but not a
matter for impeachment.
<p>
   Nor do the various runners from the Whitewater stable, at least
as far as the President is concerned, seem to carry ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' potential  &MD;  although indictment of Mrs. Clinton
by the special prosecutor Kenneth Starr remains a small but hideous
possibility, whose impact on the Clinton presidency would be
incalculable.
<p>
   Then there is ``Indogate,'' the seamy Asian fund-raising by the
White House and the Democratic National Committee.
<p>
   The Republicans will make hay in Congress, but failing proof of
a policy quid pro quo, in other words a bribe, the controversy is
likely to peter out.
<p>
   But then who would have said, four years ago, that Whitewater
would last twice as long as Watergate, with no end yet in sight?
<p>
   Let Bill Clinton enjoy his day  &MD;  and at least avoid the fate of
William Harrison, the ninth President. He was inaugurated, made an
hour-long speech in the rain, caught pneumonia, and died a month
later.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Alexander Lebed was there (though at precisely
who's invitation is a mystery). But la Streisand was not (allegedly
because White House protocol barred her from sharing the Lincoln
bedroom with her beau, James Brolin).
<p>
   There were a record 14 inaugural balls Monday night, but a tenth
of hotel rooms here were unbooked.
<p>
   Admittedly, hopes were high that the sleek, shimmering gown that
Hillary had commissioned from the couturier Oscar de la Renta would
provide the First Lady with a rare fashion success. But Bill's book
of only last September, ``From Hope to History,'' originally priced
at $16.95, is being remaindered off at $5 a throw as part of a
bric-a-brac souvenir package.
<p>
   All of which is to say that when William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd
President of the United States of America, was inaugurated Monday
for a second term, a certain pizzazz was missing from the Yankee
coronation.
<p>
   How different from four years ago, when a modern-minded young
Southerner brimming with ideas retraced the journey of Thomas
Jefferson from Monticello to Washington, and the capital dreamed of
a new Camelot.
<p>
   One reason for the lack of exuberance, inevitably, is that
sequels are rarely as good as the original. The faces are the same,
the policies mostly watered down, and the freshness of a wedding
has given way to the drearier reality of married life. But that
alone does not quite explain the strange mood.
<p>
   The start of Clinton II is a moment of high possibilities but
low expectations.
<p>
   On paper, the stars are aligned for bipartisanship as rarely
before. Once again America's voters have opted for divided
government, telling the two parties, in other words, to cooperate.
<p>
   The Republicans have retained Congress, but are a chastened
bunch, very different from Newt Gingrich's overweening invaders of
January 1995.
<p>
   The President, too, has learned that success lies in moderation,
in courting the ``vital center'' rather than the strident core
constituencies of his Democratic party.
<p>
   But behind the soaring call for national unity and purpose that
Clinton will send forth from the steps of the Capitol today lies
the rancorous reality of the controversy surrounding the Speaker,
Newt Gingrich, which  &MD;  on the House side, at least  &MD;  has turned the
105th Congress into a snake pit before it has done a day of proper
business. Then there is scandal  &MD;  or rather scandals.
<p>
   Some see hope in a ``symmetry of sin''; that the ethical
problems facing the Speaker and the President in a sense cancel
each other out, and will prompt each side to seek a truce.
<p>
   Clinton, after all, is looking for a place in history; Gingrich
for redemption. Both men say they want to balance the budget. Both
have acknowledged, albeit in differing language, that curbs on
middle-class entitlement programs such as Medicare are essential to
achieve this.
<p>
   Both have spoken passionately of the need to tackle that most
intractable of American problems, race relations. Few Republicans
would quarrel with Clinton's two other domestic priorities, of
improving education and ensuring that the welfare reform bill he
reluctantly signed last year works in practice.
<p>
   These indeed are high possibilities  &MD;  though probably even to
achieve all of them would not turn Clinton into a Great President.
<p>
   Only Washington, Lincoln and FDR are generally accorded that
distinction, thanks to the huge challenges that history have given
them: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the Depression and the
defeat of Nazi Germany.
<p>
   Fortunately for Americans, Clinton presides over less
interesting times. But why are expectations so low, and why the
vague foreboding that the best of Clinton has already been seen?
<p>
   Part of the answer is history. Second terms are usually
disappointments, from the arrogance of FDR (though he would
magnificently redeem himself in his third) to the fumbling of
Reagan and the bumbling of Eisenhower, and to the catastrophe of
Richard Nixon.
<p>
   Clinton, runs the conventional wisdom, will have a brief window
of opportunity this year to throw out his famous bridge to the 21st
century. Then he will be rudely shoved aside by the 1998 midterm
election battle, and the 2000 presidential race immediately
thereafter.
<p>
   In fact, the lame-duck theory is less than wholly convincing.
Ronald Reagan made his greatest historical legacy  &MD;  the
breakthrough encounter with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, which led to
reciprocal superpower summits and arms control deals that were the
beginning of the end of the Cold War  &MD;  in his second term, much of
it amid Iran-Contra, a scandal of government far worse than any
bothering Clinton right now.
<p>
   And does he not, aided by Madeleine Albright, his forceful
Secretary of State-designate, have at least an equal opportunity of
shaping world history in his second-term: in the Middle East and
the Balkans, with a post-Cold War accommodation between an expanded
NATO and Russia, and perhaps even an understanding with China?
<p>
   But this overlooks a crucial difference between the two men.
Reagan was trusted. Clinton, despite a best-ever approval rating of
more than 60 percent, still is not.

   TIRANA, ALBANIA  &MD;  Thousands of Albanians who have lost their
money in failed ``pyramid'' saving schemes thronged into the main
square of the capital, Tirana, for an anti-government rally Sunday,
only to be beaten back by police who lashed out at the crowds with
truncheons and smashed up the stage and sound system being used by
opposition leaders.
<p>
   The incident was the culmination of four days of street protests
in Tirana and other big cities sparked by the latest banking
collapse, and raised the political temperature higher than it has
been since opposition leaders were beaten up in the wake of last
May's rigged general elections.
<p>
   Several demonstrators stumbled away from the rally with bloodied
faces. People closest to the opposition leaders in the center of
Skanderbeg Square were the most roughly handled, as plainclothes
officers swooped in to stop the speeches from beginning.
<p>
   The thousands of uniformed riot police who ringed the area were
less brutal, partly because many in their ranks have lost their
savings too.
<p>
   The pyramid schemes, which have thrived over the past four years
in the absence of a conventional banking system, offer
extraordinarily high rates of interest on hard-currency deposits  &MD; 
more than 10 percent per month  &MD;  but rely on ever more depositors
coming forward to keep going.
<p>
   Hundreds of thousands of Albanians have entrusted their last
assets to them in the hope of getting rich quick, but without
asking themselves how the banks operate and how long they are
likely to survive.
<p>
   President Sali Berisha has great taken pains to dissociate
himself from the schemes in the past few days, but in fact it is
inconceivable that they could have operated without the
government's active approval.
<p>
   In Serbia, where pyramid schemes thrived in 1992-93 before
disappearing overnight, they were a perfect vehicle for
money-laundering and illegal government manipulation of the
people's savings.
<p>
   Like Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia, Albania has a heavily
clientelistic economic structure that is rigorously controlled by
the political leadership.
<p>
   With Serbia's current street revolution very much in the news in
Albania, many of Sunday's demonstrators used the occasion to vent
their fury at the government.
<p>
   ``Down with the dictatorship!'' was a common cry. ``First the
government stole our votes, now it is stealing our money,'' was
another.
<p>
   Albania has effectively been a one-party state since last May's
fraudulent elections. The ruling Democratic Party controls every
institution in the country, and the opposition has refused to take
up the few seats it was grudgingly offered in parliament following
a halfhearted attempt at international mediation.
<p>
   The European Union, in particular, has been reluctant to call
President Berisha to order because it feels it needs him to exert a
stabilizing influence on the Albanian communities in Kosovo and
Macedonia.
<p>
   The diplomatic community is also afraid of a return of the
Socialist Party, heirs to Enver Hoxha's Communists, and has
succeeded in persuading them  &MD;  at least until now  &MD;  to keep a low
profile while they purge their ranks of hard-liners.

<p>
   DAMASCUS  &MD;  On Abdul Aziz al-Musri's desk, there is a Koranic
quotation in magnificent Arabic script: ``And tell them that the
water is to be divided between them...''
<p>
   The head of the international water bureau in the Syrian
Ministry of Irrigation keeps a host of other theological
instructions on file, along with historical water agreements
stretching back to 2,360 B.C., via the Iraqi kingdom of Hammurabi
(1792-1750 BC) and four centuries of Ottoman legislation.
<p>
   On al-Musri's wall, a large map appears to show the fruits of
this collected wisdom: most of Syria is colored a dark, verdant
green. But another set of files on al-Musri's desk shows just how
misleading maps can be.
<p>
   For in the far north of his country  &MD;  and it is a problem upon
which al-Musri spends almost every waking hour  &MD;  the color green is
fading away.
<p>
   Four entire rivers, according to the Syrian ministry, have
either dried up because the Turks have diverted the water courses
north of the border, or been contaminated by massive pollution from
Turkey.
<p>
   Al-Musri slides a pen down the mournful list on his desk. ``The
Jaljal River passes through our city of Hassake,'' he said. ``It
has dried up.
<p>
   ``The el-Balih River virtually dried up five years ago when the
Turks began using the underground water in the river's catchment
area in Turkey. In summer now, the Sajar River runs out of water.''
<p>
   Al-Musri knows his job. He speaks fluent Turkish and two years
ago completed a five-year assignment as first secretary at the
Syrian embassy in Ankara.
<p>
   He has visited every Turkish dam on the other side of the
frontier and participated in the major water resource conferences
with Turkey.
<p>
   His pen comes to rest on another river, the Qweik, which once
ran south into the great city of Aleppo. ``It is no more,''
al-Musri says.
<p>
   Not quite. When I visited the area, I found something worse. The
Qweik is now a fast-flowing open sewer, its stench drifting for
miles across the barren fields.
<p>
   In Aleppo itself, the Syrians have been forced to merge the
ancient watercourse, with its underground Roman water tanks and
bridges, into the city's sewage system.
<p>
   ``Just 13 months ago, the Turkish side started releasing
polluted water in some of our joint rivers,'' al-Musri goes on.
``Sewage water and drainage from the lands that carry industrial
pollutants came down the al-Balih Valley and we are still receiving
this dirty water.''
<p>
   And from a battered grey filing cabinet in the corner of the
room comes another file, crammed with statistics of biological
oxygen dissolve (BOD) measurements  &MD;  a system of checking the
purity of water.
<p>
   ``In the normal course of events, there should be only 2
milligrams BOD per liter in a river  &MD;  up to 40 if it is irrigation
water.
<p>
   ``But we've done 300 analyzes in the al-Balih Valley and they
show that BOD reached 500 milligrams per liter. This has polluted
the land  &MD;  it's harmed the health of our farmers and their
families, and contaminated drinking water in the region.''
<p>
   Al-Musri, however, is a technical man. Ask him why the Turks are
polluting the rivers and he replies: ``It's a political question.
From the technical side, we have all the information necessary to
reach a joint agreement.
<p>
   ``The problem today is not so much the amount of water  &MD;  though
that has been a problem on the Euphrates when the Turks were
filling their dams  &MD;  but the quality of the water.''
<p>
   All of which depends, it seems, on the quality of political
relations between Syria and Turkey, a matter upon which al-Musri
did not wish to expand.
<p>
   It is no secret, however, that Turkey's new military agreement
with Israel  &MD;  which allows Israeli pilots to fly in Turkish
airspace along Syria's northern border  &MD;  and Turkey's anger at
Syrian support for Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) separatists who are
waging a brutal campaign in southeast Turkey, have brought
relations between the Syrians and the successors to the old Ottoman

   The irony, of course, is that the sharing of waters between

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- GreenPoint Financial Corp.'s
fourth-quarter net income rose 75 percent as the New York City
thrift increased nationwide mortgages and other lending.
<p>
   GreenPoint's net income rose to $33.9 million, or 81 cents a
share, from $19.4 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier. That beat
the average Wall Street estimate by a penny a share, according to a
Zacks Investment Research survey of 10 analysts.
<p>
   ``This past year was a breakthrough for GreenPoint,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive Thomas Johnson said in a statement. ``We began
to realize the strong financial rewards coming from careful
execution of our business strategy.'' GreenPoint shares fell 1/4 to
54 3/8. The company's net interest income -- the interest it
collected minus the interest it paid -- rose 13 percent to $114.6
million, as GreenPoint's interest expense fell 18 percent.
<p>
   Total loans outstanding rose 25 percent to $7.29 billion, as the
bank booked $735 million in mortgages in the quarter. GreenPoint
specializes in ``low-doc, no-doc'' mortgages, requiring less
documentation from applicants than most banks.
<p>
   The net interest margin, a measure of the gap between the
interest rates the bank pays and receives, widened to 3.82 percent
from 2.96 percent in the same period in 1995.
<p>
   The bank set aside $4.89 million for future loan losses,
compared with a recovery of $2.47 million a year earlier, though
total nonperforming assets fell 11 percent to $384.7 million.
<p>
   Noninterest income, excluding gains from securities sales, fell
15 percent to $10.8 million.
<p>
   Noninterest expense, including writeoffs goodwill related to
past acquisitions, fell 22 percent to $63.3 million, aided by
reduced premiums for federal deposit insurance.
<p>
   Net income for 1996 rose 23 percent to $132.5 million, or $3.02
a share, from $107.5 million, or $2.29, in 1995. --Joseph A.

<p>
   DAMASCUS  &MD;  On Abdul Aziz al-Musri's desk, there is a Koranic
quotation in magnificent Arabic script: ``And tell them that the
water is to be divided between them...''
<p>
   The head of the international water bureau in the Syrian
Ministry of Irrigation keeps a host of other theological
instructions on file, along with historical water agreements
stretching back to 2,360 B.C., via the Iraqi kingdom of Hammurabi
(1792-1750 BC) and four centuries of Ottoman legislation.
<p>
   On al-Musri's wall, a large map appears to show the fruits of
this collected wisdom: most of Syria is colored a dark, verdant
green. But another set of files on al-Musri's desk shows just how
misleading maps can be.
<p>
   For in the far north of his country  &MD;  and it is a problem upon
which al-Musri spends almost every waking hour  &MD;  the color green is
fading away.
<p>
   Four entire rivers, according to the Syrian ministry, have
either dried up because the Turks have diverted the water courses
north of the border, or been contaminated by massive pollution from
Turkey.
<p>
   Al-Musri slides a pen down the mournful list on his desk. ``The
Jaljal River passes through our city of Hassake,'' he said. ``It
has dried up.
<p>
   ``The el-Balih River virtually dried up five years ago when the
Turks began using the underground water in the river's catchment
area in Turkey. In summer now, the Sajar River runs out of water.''
<p>
   Al-Musri knows his job. He speaks fluent Turkish and two years
ago completed a five-year assignment as first secretary at the
Syrian embassy in Ankara.
<p>
   He has visited every Turkish dam on the other side of the
frontier and participated in the major water resource conferences
with Turkey.
<p>
   His pen comes to rest on another river, the Qweik, which once
ran south into the great city of Aleppo. ``It is no more,''
al-Musri says.
<p>
   Not quite. When I visited the area, I found something worse. The
Qweik is now a fast-flowing open sewer, its stench drifting for
miles across the barren fields.
<p>
   In Aleppo itself, the Syrians have been forced to merge the
ancient watercourse, with its underground Roman water tanks and
bridges, into the city's sewage system.
<p>
   ``Just 13 months ago, the Turkish side started releasing
polluted water in some of our joint rivers,'' al-Musri goes on.
``Sewage water and drainage from the lands that carry industrial
pollutants came down the al-Balih Valley and we are still receiving
this dirty water.''
<p>
   And from a battered grey filing cabinet in the corner of the
room comes another file, crammed with statistics of biological
oxygen dissolve (BOD) measurements  &MD;  a system of checking the
purity of water.
<p>
   ``In the normal course of events, there should be only 2
milligrams BOD per liter in a river  &MD;  up to 40 if it is irrigation
water.
<p>
   ``But we've done 300 analyzes in the al-Balih Valley and they
show that BOD reached 500 milligrams per liter. This has polluted
the land  &MD;  it's harmed the health of our farmers and their
families, and contaminated drinking water in the region.''
<p>
   Al-Musri, however, is a technical man. Ask him why the Turks are
polluting the rivers and he replies: ``It's a political question.
From the technical side, we have all the information necessary to
reach a joint agreement.
<p>
   ``The problem today is not so much the amount of water  &MD;  though
that has been a problem on the Euphrates when the Turks were
filling their dams  &MD;  but the quality of the water.''
<p>
   All of which depends, it seems, on the quality of political
relations between Syria and Turkey, a matter upon which al-Musri
did not wish to expand.
<p>
   It is no secret, however, that Turkey's new military agreement
with Israel  &MD;  which allows Israeli pilots to fly in Turkish
airspace along Syria's northern border  &MD;  and Turkey's anger at
Syrian support for Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) separatists who are
waging a brutal campaign in southeast Turkey, have brought
relations between the Syrians and the successors to the old Ottoman
rulers to their lowest point for many years.

<p>
   Detroit, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Comerica Inc. said it will cut
1,890 jobs, or 14 percent of its workforce, and close branches to
cut costs, seeking to boost profits and avoid a potential takeover.
<p>
   The Detroit-based bank took a $90 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for the job cuts and other
restructuring moves.
<p>
   The bank said its taking other measures to boost revenue by $110
million a year. Comerica needs the changes to convince investors
that the bank -- often cited by analysts as a likely takeover
target -- should remain independent.
<p>
   If Comerica doesn't cut costs, ``someone else will (cut) them
for us,'' said Chairman and Chief Executive Eugene Miller. ``And I
mean being taken over.''
<p>
   Comerica joins Keycorp, First of America Corp., Signet Banking
Corp. and others that are restructuring under pressure from
investors to boost profits. The moves make Comerica less attractive
to acquirers, analysts said, because there's less waste to trim.
<p>
   ``Sounds like they heard footsteps,'' said James Schmidt, a
portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds, which owns 552,800 shares.
<p>
   Comerica announced the steps as it reported that fourth-quarter
profit from operations rose 14 percent to $121 million, or $1.06 a
share -- a penny shy of Wall Street expectations. Net income,
including the $90 million restructuring charge, fell 43 percent to
$61 million, or 52 cents a share, from $107 million, or 92 cents,
in the same period in 1995.
<p>
   Comerica shares were unchanged at 56 1/4 in trading of 452,000
shares, not quite twice its daily average volume.
<p>
   The bank plans to cut jobs in all its businesses, using 1,800
suggestions culled from employees since September. Changes range
from reducing the number of people needed to approve a loan to
saving $1 million a year by using fewer kinds of envelopes. b3 The
bank was advised by Chandrika Tandon's New York-based Tandon
Capital Associates, a consulting firm which built a reputation for
slashing payrolls at other banks.
<p>
   Fleet Financial Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Michigan National
Bank, and Midlantic Bancorp all hired Tandon to devise ways to
boost profits at least in part by firing workers.
<p>
   Tandon organized four months of meetings, getting suggestions on
how to save money from 5,000 Comerica employees, ranging from
tellers to Miller. The bank's senior executives then decided which
ideas to implement.
<p>
   Miller said it wasn't difficult convincing his employees to come
up with ideas that may cost them their job in the end. ``We tried
to explain the rationale, that if we're going to grow the company
we have to do these things.''
<p>
   Some investors said banks tend to reduce costs even more than
expected in the long run after they've been
<p>
   ``She's been pretty successful in her plans, most of the banks
have beaten targets,'' said John Laupheimer, who manages a
portfolio of bank stocks for MFS Asset Management Group.
``Efficiency is the name of the game in banking.''
<p>
   Tandon couldn't immediately be reached for comment. In its
earnings report, Comerica said net interest income rose 3.6 percent
to $353.3 million as loans outstanding increased 4.7 percent to an
average of $25.5 billion in the quarter. The net interest margin
widened to 4.61 percent from 4.31 percent.
<p>
   Overall credit quality improved, as the bank reduced by 3
percent to $32 million the amount it set aside for future loan
losses while net write-offs fell 38 percent to $22.3 million.
<p>
   Total noninterest income fell 5.8 percent to $132.4 million,
amid declines in broker fees and revolving credit fees.
<p>
   Noninterest expense rose 24 percent to $356.2 million. Excluding
the restructuring charge, expenses fell 7.7 percent.
<p>
   For full year 1996, net income rose 0.9 percent to $417.2
million, or $3.55 a share, from $413.4 million, or $3.54, in 1995.
<p>
   Comerica, which has $34 billion in assets, operates about 365
branches in Michigan, California, Texas and Florida.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans offered
the Clinton administration and environmental groups an olive branch
today in the form of a draft bill to overhaul Superfund, the
federal program to clean up toxic waste sites.
<p>
   Republican Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the chairman of
the Environment Committee, and Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who
heads the panel's Superfund Subcommittee, proposed a bill to
streamline the program, restructure the way costs are allocated and
to give states more flexibility. Significantly they did not urge
repeal of liability for pollution caused before 1980, a key issue
that stalled legislation last year.
<p>
   The effort to restart negotiations follows years of stalemate,
with all sides agreeing that an overhaul is necessary but without
an agreement on what needs to be done.
<p>
   ``Superfund isn't working,'' Chafee said at a press conference
today. ``Superfund is rapidly becoming an environmental failure
rather than an environmental savior.''
<p>
   Chafee and Smith said they incorporated suggestions from
Democratic lawmakers and Clinton administration officials into the
new bill and welcome further comments. ``We're not saying this is
written in concrete,'' Chafee said.
<p>
   The new bill authorizes $15 million in annual grants to identify
``brownfields'' -- lightly contaminated industrial sites in
industrial or poor neighborhoods, and provides additional grants to
clean up those sites. The idea dovetails with a Clinton
administration plan that would give tax credits and other breaks to
companies that clean up these sites.
<p>
   The bill would give states primary responsibility for Superfund
cleanups. It also would exempt from liability individuals that
disposed of household wastes, and businesses with fewer than 30
employees or less than $3 million in revenue. There's also a
blanket exemption for those involved with municipal solid waste and
sludge, and limits on liability for religious, charitable,
scientific and educational organizations.
<p>
   The bill also would allow states flexibility in determining how
Superfund sites are cleaned up; and require the Environmental
Protection Agency to consider the planned future use of a site when
determining how clean a site must be.
<p>
   Since the Superfund program began in 1980, only 125 of the
approximately 1,300 sites covered by the program have been cleaned
up, according to Smith. At the same time, companies, municipalities
and the government have spent billions of dollars on litigation and
other issues related to the program.
<p>
   ``Superfund has become the classic example of a federal program
awash in red tape, litigation and gold-plated spending,'' Smith
said.
<p>
   Waste-management companies like Thermo TerraTech Inc. are likely
to profit once legislation is passed, regardless of the form it
takes.
<p>
   The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company provides environmental
services to a broad range of companies, and also has a number of
government contracts, said President and Chief Executive John P.
Appleton.
<p>
   Thermo TerraTech's cleanup subsidiary, Thermo Remediation Inc.,
derives about 20 percent of its revenue from Superfund work, said
Appleton.
<p>
   Thermo Remediation's revenue for the year ending in March is
likely to be ``something over $100 million,'' said Appleton, up
from $67 million in the last fiscal year. ``There is a lot of
activity there at the present moment,'' he said.
<p>
   ``I believe that companies have accepted the idea of
environmental stewardship,'' Appleton said. ``They know those
(Superfund) liabilities are not going to go away. They just want to
deal with them in as cost-effective a way as they can.''
<p>
   Appleton said he believes a new Superfund law would allow
companies to have a say in how sites are cleaned up, and would
allow for more of a case-by-case analysis.
<p>
   Thermo Remediation shares closed today at 7, up 1/4. Thermo
Electron shares rose 5/8 to 37 1/2.
<p>
   Insurance companies could also benefit from a law that clarified
their liabilities. The Smith-Chafee bill would cap liabilities in
some instances, but the senators denied that it would ``let
polluters off the hook,'' a charge leveled against last year's
bill.
<p>
   ``The allocation system (in the bill) has really got a lot of
wallop in it,'' Chafee said. Karen Florini, an attorney with the
Environmental Defense Fund, found several flaws in the proposal.
For example, she said, the bill doesn't ensure that ``toxic hot
spots'' will be cleaned up, fails to protect groundwater, and
``rolls back liability for some industrial polluters.''
<p>
   By limiting the number of sites that may be added to the
Superfund program in the future, states could end up footing the
bill for 1,400 to 2,300 additional sites, at a cost of $8.4 billion
to $19.9 billion, she said.
<p>
   The EPA, under Administrator Carol Browner, the EPA has cleaned
up more Superfund sites in three and a half years than it did in
the previous 12 years, according to an agency year-end review. Yet
even though improvements have been made to the program, ``we still
believe legislation is needed,'' said spokeswoman Lauren Mical.
<p>
   Mical said EPA officials are still going over the Smith-Chafee
bill.

   As he rose at Time  &MD;  from copy boy in 1944 to writer to senior
editor to assistant managing editor to managing editor (1968 to
1977) to corporate editor to editor in chief (1978 to 1987)  &MD; 
Grunwald loved the high-stakes pressure and heady power of that
business. In his book, he writes: ``I developed an almost physical
connection with news. Certain events, certain ideas for stories,
announced themselves, literally, in my pulse or in the pit of my
stomach.''
<p>
   And Grunwald experienced the Time &AMP; Life Building in midtown
Manhattan as a second home. In his early days as a reporter,
Grunwald writes, the office came to signify his American present, a
respite from his parent's confining ground-floor apartment, which
symbolized his immigrant past.
<p>
   Grunwald also described Time as a graduate school, populated by
eccentric, brilliant tutors who played out their tantrums, love
affairs and vices in full view of one another.
<p>
   They are the sort of characters Grunwald might have created had
he ever succeeded at his first love, writing plays. And he
describes them in the book with a novelist's flare for detail.
About the film critic James Agee: ``otherworldly to the point of
often leaving his paychecks uncashed in his desk drawer.'' The
foreign news editor Whittaker Chambers: ``with a twinkle in his
eyes that somehow did not go with his plain black or gray suits.''
<p>
   To this day, Grunwald said in his apartment, his inability to
succeed as a playwright rankles. But he spoke of it as a skill
that, simply, he was never destined to master. ``It will remain a
regret because theater was a great love of mine as a child, and you
don't easily get over first loves,'' he said. ``Would I change my
life if I could? Should I have quit Time and persevered in writing
plays? No, I really can't say that I would do that.
<p>
   ``It's like wanting to be a ballet dancer when you don't have
the body to be a ballet dancer. And I don't think that is failure
so much as misjudgment.''
<p>
   Grunwald is clearly proud of his work at Time and said he
continues to admire the magazine today. While he concedes that Time
may no longer be the intellectual status symbol it once was  &MD;  a
publication prominently displayed on people's coffee tables  &MD; 
Grunwald said he believes a good news magazine still has an
important role in explaining events. ``We are now surrounded,
enveloped, smothered by information,'' he said. ``Where news used
to be something that was relatively scarce  &MD;  people waited for it  &MD; 
now we are almost in a position of wanting to fight off the news.
<p>
   ``People need some guide through this chaos of information. It
is becoming increasingly difficult to tell the bogus from the real
and the many gradations in between. I would think the news magazine
is the perfect instrument to provide this.''
<p>
   Grunwald thus might be expected to feel nostalgic for the days
of meeting deadlines. But he said he enjoyed the two years he
served as ambassador to Austria after leaving Time Inc.  &MD; 
reacquainting himself with the Vienna of his childhood at a time
when Communism was collapsing. And despite his eye disease,
Grunwald said he has several writing projects in store.
<p>
   ``Yes, I do miss the action,'' he said, his cup of black coffee
now cold. ``I miss the connectedness with events. Writing a book  &MD; 
to use one of the world's oldest cliches  &MD;  is a lonely business
because you don't get any reaction for weeks, months, years.
<p>
   ``So that was a rather unusual experience. But I managed to get
through it.''

Detroit, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Michigan stocks rose, led by shares
of Herman Miller Inc. and Compuware Corp., reversing yesterday's
decline.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Michigan Index rose 0.74, or 0.05 percent, to close at
142.06. It lagged the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which
rose 3.51, or 0.45 percent, to 786.23. Herman Miller shares led the
advance, rising 2 13/16 to 60 1/4 after Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. analyst
Pamela Singleton said in a report that the Zeeland-based maker of
office furniture is ``experiencing extremely strong demand'' for
its products. Singleton said she set a target of $70 for the stock.
<p>
   Compuware rose 2 to 60 1/4 after reporting better-than-expected
fiscal third-quarter earnings. Compuware said its profit from
operations for the period ended Dec. 31 rose 43 percent to $32.2
million, or 72 cents a share, from $22.6 million, or 52 cents, a
year earlier.
<p>
   Analysts expected the Farmington Hills-based company to earn 62
cents a share, the average of six analysts surveyed by IBES
International Inc. The software company's stock has risen 13
percent since it unveiled a product last week that will
automatically test new applications.
<p>
   Among decliners, shares in Gelman Sciences Inc., a maker of
medical diagnostic devices, fell 2 5/8 to 29 1/2, while Knape &AMP;
Vogt Manufacturing Co., a maker of storage products and shelving
systems, dropped 1 1/2 to 16 1/2.
<p>
   Among automakers, Chrysler Corp. shares were unchanged at 36,
after rising 1 1/2 yesterday when it reported record
higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.
<p>
   General Motors Corp. stock fell 1/8 to 61 7/8, while Ford Motor
Co. shares rose 5/8 to 34 1/4.
<p>
   The Michigan Index has risen 2.7 percent since January, compared
to a 6.1 percent increase in the S&AMP;P 500.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Travelers Group Inc. said it
would buy back as much as $1 billion of stock and increase its
dividend 33 percent, sending the insurance and financial services
company's shares to an all-time high.
<p>
   Travelers stock rose 2 3/8, or 4.6 percent, to a record 53 5/8
in trading of 2.7 million shares, exceeding its recent daily
trading average of 1.3 million shares.
<p>
   ``They're just doing a great job across the field, and we figure
they're going to continue to outclass their competitors,'' said
Alfred Feinman, a general partner at the New York-based Glickenhaus
&AMP; Co., which owns about 2 million Travelers shares. ``We'll stick
with it.''
<p>
   Today's announcements reflected the expectation Travelers will
keep its profits growing, ``generating enormous amounts of cash
flow,'' Travelers Vice Chairman Jeffrey Lane said. ``The board
feels confident about the future.''
<p>
   The buyback represents as much as 18.6 million shares at today's
price, or about 3 percent of the 639 million shares outstanding.
Repurchases will meet demands of Travelers' employee stock option
and other benefit programs, the company said.
<p>
   Travelers Chairman Sanford Weill yesterday told analysts that
30,000 of the company's 45,000 employees own Travelers shares.
<p>
   The stock-ownership program has won praise among investors. ``
As long as they're willing to put their money on the line, we will
be too,'' said Feinman at Glickenhaus, which acquired its shares 10
years ago in a company called Commercial Credit, now a unit of
Travelers.
<p>
   ``The thing that originally attracted us was that Sanford Weill,
plus the people he brought in, were going to be rewarded by stock
options, not by big fat bonuses,'' Feinman said.
<p>
   In addition, Travelers' said it would increase the company's
quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share from 11.25 cents. It's
payable on Feb. 21 to investors who hold the shares on Feb. 3.

<p>
   Those who have lost close track of Barry Tuckwell's illustrious
career over the last decade or two may be surprised to learn that
his final public performances on the horn, Thursday night, Friday
and Saturday, are to take place in Baltimore.
<p>
   With no insult intended to that fair city, it seems an
out-of-the-way place for this ultimate musical cosmopolite to take
his leave.
<p>
   Until, that is, one pursues the 65-year-old Tuckwell to his
home, on the outskirts of Hagerstown, Md.
<p>
   Hagerstown IS out of the way, tucked in the rolling hills
between Pennsylvania and West Virginia some 75 miles northwest of
Baltimore.
<p>
   Tuckwell, whom The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians
describes as ``the leading horn player of his generation,'' was
born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1931, and spent most of his
50-year playing career based in London. He has been an itinerant
soloist and conductor since leaving his positions as principal horn
player and chairman of the board of the London Symphony in 1968, so
American music lovers may not have noticed when he began to
resettle in their midst.
<p>
   The ``catalyst,'' he said, was Walter Lawson, a maker of brass
instruments who played horn in the Baltimore Symphony for 26 years
and now has a shop with his three sons and a daughter-in-law in
nearby Boonsboro.
<p>
   In 1982, in consultation with Lawson and others, Tuckwell
founded the Maryland Symphony, which he still conducts, as a
successor to the bedraggled Potomac Symphony. And he was drawn
increasingly to the area.
<p>
   ``I wanted to live in the country,'' he said last week, sitting
in his living room, which offered a broad view of the spacious
backyard, where squirrels romped in the snow. ``But one thing led
to another.''
<p>
   In Hagerstown, he met Sue Levitan, a former sports reporter for
The Baltimore Sun, who has since become his third wife. He
established permanent residency in the United States in 1992 and
became a U.S. citizen last May. The youngest of his three children,
all born in England, now also lives in Hagerstown along with two
stepdaughters.
<p>
   So yes, Baltimore. Tuckwell is to perform Oliver Knussen's Horn
Concerto and Mozart's Concerto in E flat (K. 447), with the
Baltimore Symphony, conducted by George Cleve at the Joseph
Meyerhoff Symphony Hall.
<p>
   Knussen, an Englishman, composed his terse and charmingly
atmospheric work in 1994, ``as a grateful response to more than 30
years of hearing Barry Tuckwell play,'' he has written. Tuckwell
has since recorded it brilliantly for Deutsche Grammophon, with the
London Sinfonietta, led by Knussen.
<p>
   Mozart's four horn concertos are, of course, standard fare in a
relatively limited field. Tuckwell has played them many times and
recorded them complete on three occasions. Still, they remain fresh
for him, he said, and especially this one, because it constantly
yields up new lessons.
<p>
   ``Yes, it's relatively simple,'' he explained. ``But there is
much more to music than technical challenges. The most important
thing is learning how to turn a phrase, how to make a simple melody
sound interesting.''
<p>
   That was a lesson Tuckwell learned early from a seemingly
unlikely source: recordings of the American jazz trombonist Tommy
Dorsey. ``I played along with his records when I was a kid,'' he
said. ``I'm proud to say I took lessons from Tommy Dorsey.''
<p>
   Matters of balance and structure also emerge starkly in Mozart.
``That's where the real difficulties come in,'' Tuckwell said.
``Throughout my career, each performance has in effect been a
rehearsal for the next. The sad thing is that Saturday evening will
be my last rehearsal.''
<p>
   Tuckwell grew up in a musical family; his father played the
mighty Wurlitzer organ in the local movie palace. After toying with
organ, piano and violin himself, he took up the horn at 13. Within
months, he was filling in with the Melbourne Symphony.
<p>
   He had played most of the major horn concertos by the time he
was 17, and a succession of orchestral positions in Australia and
England led him to the London Symphony in 1955. The rest is a very
rich history.
<p>
   Players of brass instruments live by their lungs, teeth, lips
and facial muscles, and do not always age well. If Tuckwell's
prodigious abilities on the horn have fallen off in any significant
way, however, the loss is not apparent from reviews of his
performances.
<p>
   His decision to retire while still in fine form, he has said,
was motivated less by any sense of decline than by a realization
that his career could hardly get better than it has been in recent
years. The move was made easier by the knowledge that he had
established himself as a conductor with many orchestras and could
continue to perform pretty much at will.
<p>
   The one place where he will not conduct so much after this
season is Hagerstown, for he is resigning his position with the
Maryland Symphony. His relations with the orchestra's board have
soured, he said, partly because the directors declined his offer to
play a farewell recital with internationally renowned friends to
benefit the orchestra, suggesting that it would be too much bother.
He says he will miss the steady contact with the players.
<p>
   ``He has taken an orchestra that played really simple stuff, a
sort of civic symphony, and made it into one that can perform
Mahler's First Symphony and Shostakovich's Fifth very well,'' said
Lawson, the horn maker. ``He's a real conductor. He has left his
imprint here, and the town loves him.''
<p>
   One of the area's logistical assets, Lawson said, is its
proximity to four airports, and Tuckwell will continue to rely on
them. He remains principal guest conductor of the Northern
Sinfonia, in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, as he has been since
1992. And he has numerous engagements lined up around the world.
<p>
   Beyond that, he will relish some free time. ``I have so many
things I want to hear again,'' he said. ``I don't know how many
yards of reel-to-reel tapes I have lined up. I hope they're still
good. I have a lot to do.''
<p>
   ``Besides, I want to play,'' he added, and he didn't mean horn.

<p>
   White Plains, New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Richey Reneberg
has been named as an injury replacement for Todd Martin on the U.S.
Davis Cup team for its 1997 opening round tie in Brazil, Feb. 7-12.
<p>
   Martin has tendinitis in his right knee, which forced him out of
the Australian Open. He had hoped to recover to be able to compete
in Brazil.
<p>
   ``Todd has always made Davis Cup a priority in his scheduling
and has made many great contributions to the team's success in
previous years,'' said U.S. captain Tom Gullikson. ``Richey
Reneberg has always stepped up when called on for Davis Cup play. I
am fortunate to have a player of Richey's ability and Davis Cup
experience to turn to.''
<p>
   Reneberg played Davis Cup from 1993-95 and his record is 4-2 in
doubles and 1-0 in singles. His most recent competition came in
Italy in 1995 when he teamed with Jared Palmer to win the doubles.
He was also a member of the 1995 team that beat Russia in the
final, but didn't play.

<p>
   Chatsworth, California, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Great Western
Financial Corp. fourth-quarter earnings fell 14 percent, as income
from mortgage loans plummeted and the bank boosted reserves for
lending losses.
<p>
   The nation's second-largest savings bank said earnings before
charges and gains fell to $85 million, or 58 cents a share, from
$98.6 million, or 66 cents, in the last three months of 1995. After
the charges and gains, the Chatsworth, California-based thrift
reported earnings of $5.13 million, or 1 cent a share.
<p>
   The results exceeded analysts' expectations of 56 cents a share,
according of a survey of 13 analysts by IBES International Inc.
Great Western shares rose 5/8 to 32 1/8.
<p>
   Net interest income fell 4.5 percent to $335.0 million, as
revenue from mortgage-backed securities fell. The thrift boosted
its provision for future lending losses by 71 percent to $85.9
million, cutting into profit.
<p>
   Noninterest income rose 7.2 percent to $114.1 million, as fees
from retail banking surged. Great Western had a pretax gain of
$23.0 million for the sale of its student lending business.
<p>
   Noninterest expenses rose 41 percent to $357.7 million, mainly
because of a $68.3 million pretax charge for a plan to cut 800 jobs
in a bid to reduce costs in the mortgage lending business.
<p>
   The thrift said it had a long way to go to revamp the mortgage
business, after real estate loans grew by $1.6 billion in the
quarter, about the same rate as in the fourth quarter of 1995.
<p>
   ``This level of mortgage originations is not satisfactory,''
said Chief Executive John Maher in a statement.
<p>
   Great Western, in a plan announced last month, is trying to
recover from a long slide in its mortgage business, that took the
thrift from being the fifth-largest U.S. mortgage bank to below No.
20.
<p>
   The company plans to cut 800 jobs, reduce the size of its
headquarters and replace antiquated systems this year. It already
has sold $300 million in non-performing home mortgages.
<p>
   The goal, a spokesman said, is to reduce the cost of making a
mortgage to $3,000 from $4,000. That, he said, should allow Great
Western to boost lending, regaining some of its lost market share.
<p>
   Great Western has $43.5 billion in assets and 1,150 mortgage and
consumer banking offices in California and Florida.

<p>
   Though music business sales last year were flat, this had little
to do with the quality of music produced and released. Last year,
independent and international labels released scores of worthy
albums, but many slipped by unnoticed, in large part because these
labels are unable to afford extensive promotion, distribution or
tours for their bands.
<p>
   Listed here are 10 records from 1996 that haven't received much
attention but are worth the extra time it takes to hunt for them,
either through mail order or a local independent record store.
<p>
   Note that, with the increasing frequency at which big labels
sign fledgling bands, a list could just as easily be made of
quality releases by one of the six major labels last year that
received no marketing, promotion or support.
<p>
   `THE SOUL OF CAPE VERDE' (Tinder, 619 Martin Ave., Rohnert Park,
Calif. 94928) Colonization and miscegenation, farming and drought,
emigration and homesickness are among the many elements that
penetrate the sparse, soulful songs of the Cape Verde islands, off
the coast of Senegal, filling the music with a melancholy beauty
lovingly captured on this 19-song compilation.
<p>
   BOWERY ELECTRIC: `BEAT' (Kranky, Box 578743, Chicago 60657) The
release of albums of spacey, droning rock has become a veritable
industry, and of the many great albums that came out this year  &MD; 
from Magnog to Quickspace to Spectrum's collaboration with
Jessamine  &MD;  this was among the best, mixing guitars and drums with
keyboards and electronic effects to create the musical equivalent
of an optical illusion: Is it moving or standing still?
<p>
   ZEN: `DERYA' (Father Yod/Ecstatic Peace, Box 2274, Amherst,
Mass. 01002) Continuing an almost 40-year-old tradition of
innovative rock in Turkey, Zen mixes psychedelic rock, free jazz
and folk melodies and rhythms to come up with 12 challenging and
beguiling improvisations.
<p>
   LOOSE DIAMONDS: `FRESCO FIASCO' (Freedom, Box 650032, Austin,
Texas 78765) This driving Austin roots-rock band unplugs for a
winsome folk-country album on which every tentative strum, every
slightly staggered phrase conveys an emotion that runs as deep as
the music's roots.
<p>
   PRINCE PAUL: `PSYCHOANALYSIS (WHAT IS IT?)' (Wordsound, 129
North 11th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11211) It's hard to realize just
how constrained rappers are by the conventions of the form and the
pressure of their peers and public until hearing an album like
this, on which Prince Paul (formerly associated with De La Soul and
Stetsasonic) unwinds and lets his somewhat puerile mind wander.
<p>
   SUBTROPIC: `HOMEBREW' (Reflective, 759 Harrison, San Francisco
94107) Jake Smith, who records as Subtropic, delivers one of
America's best drum-and-bass albums, approaching the music's
agitated beats with an ear for compositional form and an ability to
speak through rhythm.
<p>
   THE DELGADOS: `DOMESTIQUES' (Chemikal Underground, Box 3609,
Glasgow, Scotland G42 9TP) Reminiscent of their fellow Scots the
Vaselines, the Delgados trade male and female vocals over smart,
infectious songs that mix bubble gum pop, punk rock and occasional
dissonance.
<p>
   `SUSHI 3003' (Bungalow Germany) Taking kitschy cocktail music to
the next level, the 16 modern Japanese bands on this compilation
(several of them side projects of Pizzicato Five) offer variations
on Burt Bacharach, Antonio Carlos Jobim and original melodies using
as many archaic synthesizers, vibraphones, kitten-ish singers and
eccentricities as they can.
<p>
   BETH ORTON: ``TRAILER PARK' (Heavenly, 72 Wardour St., London,
England, W1V 3HP) To find her own timeless muse, Ms. Orton touches
up '60s folk with everything from string sections to trip-hop beats
on a debut album that fuses the lounge-pop of Everything but the
Girl and the soft-spoken introspection of Nick Drake.
<p>

   Silver Apples
<p>
   The Knitting Factory in Manhattan was packed Sunday night for
the revival of a band that was never popular in its own time: the
Silver Apples. In the late 1960s, the duo was making cutting-edge
art-pop on homemade electronic instruments. But their record label
marketed them like a pop band, putting them on bills with bubble
gum acts like the 1910 Fruitgum Company.
<p>
   Record-company hype took the band's first album to No. 193 on
the pop charts; its second album didn't even have that nominal
success, and the third and last recording was never even released.
<p>
   But in a testament to the power of mass production, the band's
albums began to take on a life of their own, prized by fans of
German progressive-rock looking for an American equivalent and by
new-music fans as precursors of everything from new wave to techno
to the electro-pop of current bands like Stereolab.
<p>
   But the band's members were completely unaware that they were
turning into legends and pioneers. In an interview before his
performance Sunday, Simeon, the singer, banjo player and
electronics whiz of the Silver Apples, said the tapes of the third
album festered in storage for so long that they were eventually
sold and most likely erased.
<p>
   He said he left the homemade instrument he used on his albums
(known as the Simeon) under a friend's house in Alabama in the
mid-1980s. And he said that he completely lost touch with the
band's other original member, the percussionist Danny Taylor.
<p>
   In 1994, Sony Music even hired a detective to track down the
pair to ask about the missing album. But he was unable to locate
either member.
<p>
   ``Until last year, I thought the Silver Apples were a dead
issue,'' said Simeon, who has been living in Annapolis, Md.,
working as everything from an ice-cream truck driver to a
television news reporter.
<p>
   ``I was pursuing my painting. And one day at an art gallery in
Brooklyn I met a guy named Xian. Recognizing my unusual name, he
asked me if I knew what was going on. So I went around to different
record stores and picked up a bunch of albums that were influenced
by my music. One was an English tribute album to our band. So I
called up the label to thank them, and they promised us the world
if we would create some new music for them.''
<p>
   Simeon tried to find Taylor through the Internet and through
newspaper ads. After failing, he invited Xian (who pronounces his
name Christian) to join his band on electronics.
<p>
   In concert at the Knitting Factory, Simeon and Xian were joined
by an additional keyboardist, a drummer and two very awkward
vocalists. The group mixed Silver Apples songs like
``Oscillations'' with warped electronic versions of '60s classics
like ``In the Midnight Hour.''
<p>
   Since all of them, including Simeon, had to learn the songs from
scratch, they sounded more like a Silver Apples cover band than the
Silver Apples.
<p>
   Now that he's back in the music world, Simeon said he doesn't
plan on leaving again. The Beastie Boys have been talking to him
about reissuing his albums on their Grand Royal label and the
German digital hardcore band Atari Teenage Riot is interested in
collaborating with him.
<p>
   ``I feel like a caged animal that's suddenly been released and
he's running around the zoo terrorizing people,'' he replied.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Investors are increasing their
bets in emerging markets funds and so are fund companies.
<p>
   STI Capital Management in Orlando, Florida is one company that
reckons emerging markets will be hot in 1997, so at the end of the
month, it's opening a new fund, STI Emerging Markets Fund.
<p>
   Analysts expect STI will be getting lots more company.
<p>
   ``We've heard a lot of chatter from fund companies'' about
starting emerging markets funds, said Michael Lipper, head of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Twenty-eight funds (or new classes
of funds) opened in 1996, according to Lipper, which now follows
116 such funds in its database.
<p>
   This year ``will be an extremely strong year for emerging
markets funds,'' said Gavin Quill, vice president of marketing at
Scudder, Stevens &AMP; Clark in Boston. Scudder's emerging markets
growth fund has pulled in $18 million so far this month, its best
draw yet in its seven-month life. Scudder's Latin American fund has
attracted $41 million, its largest inflow of money in three years.
<p>
   Investors are betting that international markets, and especially
emerging markets, will outperform the U.S. this year. So far in
1997, Russian, Turkish and Hungarian stock markets are the top
performing markets in the world.
<p>
   STI's fund will be managed by Pablo Salas, who also manages the
firm's $18 million institutional emerging markets portfolio, which
returned about 15 percent last year. That compares with 4 percent
for the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index
and 11.2 percent on average for emerging markets mutual funds,
according to Lipper Analytical.
<p>
   Salas' biggest bet is Brazil, where he has 13 percent of his
portfolio. That includes stakes in power companies Cia. Energetica
de Minas Gerais and Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina SA, which
he expects should benefit from government plans to sell state
assets this year.
<p>
   Argentina comprises another 8 percent of the portfolio,
including Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata SA, one of the
country's leading banks. Salas may be unloading that stock soon,
though, because it has already risen almost 50 percent since Sept.
1.
<p>
   Like many international managers, Salas is hunting around the
markets in Korea and Thailand, which tumbled last year, their
benchmark indexes losing 27 percent and 41 percent respectively.
<p>
   ``I see lots of companies selling at less than half the price
they were last year,'' said Salas, who has recently bought two Thai
companies -- Hana Microelectronics Co., a maker of integrates
circuits and printed circuit boards, and K.R. Precision Plc., a
maker of computer components. Salas likes them because their
profits aren't tied to the local economy.
<p>
   Another inexpensive market is South Africa, where Salas has
about 11 percent of his portfolio. ``The valuations are pretty
interesting now,'' he said, considering that Morgan Stanley's South
Africa index fell about 20 percent in dollar terms last year.
<p>
   ``Last year I invested in companies benefiting from a weak
rand,'' said Salas, including Anglo American Coal Corp.; Sasol
Ltd., a producer of liquid fuels and chemicals and Barlow Ltd., a
construction equipment and building materials and retailing
company.

   Cleveland, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Cleveland Indians
purchased the contract of catcher Sean Mulligan from the San Diego
Padres, the team said.
<p>
   Cleveland then designated the 27-year-old for assignment so he
could be sent to one of the Indians' minor-league teams if he
clears waivers. He also will be invited to Cleveland's major-league
spring-training camp as a non-roster player.
<p>
   Mulligan appeared in two games with San Diego in 1996 and was
hitless in his only at-bat.
<p>
   He batted .288 in 103 games with the Padres' Triple-A Las Vegas
affiliate, reaching career highs with 19 home runs and 75 runs
batted in.
<p>
   Mulligan was a fourth-round selection of San Diego in the 1991
amateur draft out of the University of Illinois.

   Lima, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Peruvian stocks were mixed, as
gains by Telefonica del Peru were offset by declining mining
shares.
<p>
   ``Telefonica's prospects for this year are good,'' said Cesar
Beltran, head trader at Coril stock brokerage.
<p>
   Peru's Selective Index rose 2.59 points, or 0.12 percent, to
2,177.98, while the General Index dropped 2.08 points, or 0.14
percent, to 1,520.77.
<p>
   Telefonica said operating profits increased 27 percent in 1996
compared with 1995, raising fourth quarter profit per ADR to $0.477
from $0.373 last year.
<p>
   Telefonica rose 1.08 percent to 5.61 soles, as trading of
26,897,000 soles worth of shares ($10.26 million) accounted for 39
percent of volume.
<p>
   Investors look forward to the publication of the country's 1996
economic results, hoping to confirm the end of a year-long
recession. The government projects first quarter growth of 4
percent. Investors are wary following last year's fluctuating
growth of 2.2 percent for the first 11 months.
<p>
   The government will announce statistics on December's growth and
January's inflation at the beginning of February.
<p>
   Among other widely traded issues, Minsur SA dropped 1.50 percent
to 9.20 soles, while Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ``A'' shares
dropped 2.22 percent to 17.60 soles. The company's labor, or
non-voting, share dropped 3.31 percent to 17.50 soles.
<p>
   ``The price drop reflects lower gold prices,'' Beltran said.
<p>
   In the parallel currency market, the closing price for the sol
wasn't immediately available. The sol closed yesterday at
2.617/2.619 soles to the U.S. dollar.

<TEXT>
<p>
   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation may rise in
1997 because employment is high and the economy is showing new
signs of strength, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President
Robert Parry said today.
<p>
   ``Inflation could be set to rise in the future,'' Parry said in
the text of a speech to the National Association of Business
Economists in San Francisco. ``Available data on the fourth quarter
have shown considerable strength,'' he said.
<p>
   Parry said this year's strong start means the economy is ``going
to achieve at least its trend rate of growth'' at a rate of between
2 percent and 2.5 percent. At that rate, he said, ``I don't think
one has to be particularly concerned about an acceleration of
inflation.''
<p>
   Still, he said, Fed policymakers must be prepared to quell
inflationary pressures before they actually result in higher
prices.
<p>
   ``If one waits until one sees a problem, however you define it,
then I'm afraid that you're behind the 8-ball quite a bit,'' he
said.
<p>
   Yesterday Parry told reporters he expects the 1997 core rate of
inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, to rise
``a couple of tenths'' to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent in 1996.
<p>
   Parry's comments today came as newly released figures showed
U.S. housing starts last year rose 8.8 percent to 1.474 million,
the highest level since 1988.
<p>
   The Fed's `beige book'' survey of regional economic data
released today also found ``scattered evidence'' of pressure for
higher wages.
<p>
   U.S. bonds were lower after the U.S. Treasury sold $17.5 billion
of two-year notes today. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell
1/2, pushing its yield up more than 4 basis points to 6.82 percent.
<p>
   Traders said comments late yesterday from Federal Reserve
Governor Susan Phillips revived concern the Fed may raise interest
rates soon.
<p>
   Phillips suggested in a Market News interview that the Fed might
not wait for a rise in the core consumer price index before
boosting rates.
<p>
   The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the interest
rate-setting body of the central bank, is next scheduled to meet
Feb. 4-5. Parry, who is widely viewed as an inflation hawk, is a
voting member of the FOMC.
<p>
   Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate
hearing that there are few signs of inflation in the economy.
<p>
   ``The economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of
the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past
expansions,'' Greenspan said. ``By some important measures of price
trends, inflation actually slowed a bit in 1996.''
<p>
   His remarks yesterday helped boost the Dow Jones Industrial
average to a record close of 6877.35. Today, the Dow closed down
33.9 points at 6850. Broader market indices were higher.
<p>
   Fed officials have said tightening job markets are the most
likely threat to price stability in 1997. That's partly because
average hourly earnings rose 6 cents last month, or 0.5 percent,
according to the Labor Department. For all of last year, hourly
earnings climbed 3.8 percent, the biggest gain since a similar 3.8
percent increase in 1990.
<p>
   Last Thursday, Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer, widely
viewed as an inflation dove, warned the Fed would have to raise
interest rates if unemployment falls much below the current 5.3
percent rate.
<p>
   Greenspan also left open the possibility of an interest rate
increase if the economy grows faster than the 3.0 percent rate he
forecast for 1996. ``Indeed, the recent pickup in some measures of
wages suggests that the transition may already be running its
course,'' the Fed chairman said.
<p>
   Parry reiterated comments he made in a speech yesterday to the
Financial Women's Association that workers who have been more
concerned with keeping their jobs than getting pay raises will
likely begin seeking wage increases this year.
<p>
   ``Even if some workers continue to feel insecure, they still
won't be willing to pass up wage increases forever,'' Parry said
yesterday.
<p>
   He also said a stronger dollar, which makes foreign goods
cheaper by comparison with American products, is unlikely to help
keep inflation down. ``Our inflation rate ultimately depends on our
monetary policy, and not on the existence of foreign competitors,''
Parry said in the text of his speech to the business economists.

   Preliminary designs for Michael Eisner's multimillion-dollar log
cabin in Aspen, Colo., included stone fireplaces to rival Yosemite
National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel  &MD;  and a retaining wall so thin that
it would have buckled under its own weight.
<p>
   At the Connecticut compound of a retired tennis champion, the
foundation for a new guest house was laid over construction-site
trash, resulting in major cracks and leaks.
<p>
   And the $40 million Long Island house for a billionaire software
developer used an inexpensive Western pine siding that was so
vulnerable to decay that it began to rot while the house was still
under construction.
<p>
   If people with unlimited budgets cannot count on quality
construction, who can?
<p>
   House buyers today want homes of substance, but they may be
trading quality for showy flourishes, building experts say. From
stage-set stairways to nine-foot ceilings, from granite counter
tops to exercise rooms, styling is supplanting substance in houses
that cost more than $300,000, driven by a new-home buying public
that may be unwittingly confusing luxury with quality.
<p>
   ``To many people, crown moldings mean quality,'' said Don
Killoren, the general manager for construction at Celebration,
Fla., the new town development owned by the Walt Disney Co. ``A
detailed railing, for example, may not be sturdier, but the
implication is that it is. And people assume that if that much
thought went into the finishes, the whole thing is more solid,
which may or may not be the case.''
<p>
   Most experts agree with Randy Smith, the president of the
National Association of Home Builders, that building is better than
during the Roaring Eighties, when a lot of fast-track homes were
quickly  &MD;  and poorly  &MD;  constructed. But interviews with more than
30 developers, builders, architects and carpenters  &MD;  from New
England to Florida, from Texas to California  &MD;  painted a less rosy
picture of a hit-or-miss home-building industry in which a modest
Cape Codder in Connecticut may have more nails in place than a
grandiose villa in Florida.
<p>
   Given a lack of enforceable building codes, little
self-monitoring by the industry, pressure to make profits and an
undertrained workforce, houses and their owners are more dependent
than ever on the integrity of individual builders.
<p>
   ``You can have an excellent design, the most expensive
materials, and still end up with poor performance in a house if
there was no quality of assembly,'' said Jonathan Stone, a program
specialist in the United States Energy Department's Office of
Building Systems in Washington. The office is financing research to
investigate ways to improve energy efficiency in houses.
<p>
   ``Fancy, energy-efficient products, such as thermal-pane
windows, don't mean anything if they're badly installed,'' Stone
said.
<p>
   Boyce Thompson, the editor in chief of Builder, a trade journal,
said, ``The industry's largest problem is the lack of skilled
labor, so builders are always looking for ways to decrease the
amount of labor necessary.'' He cited the pervasive use of
prefabricated walls, floors and roofs, now used in more than half
of all new houses, which can reduce construction time by 25 percent
over that of stick-build framing.
<p>
   Many builders say that prefabricated parts, which are
standardized and built to fit, are superior, Thompson said.
``Whenever you can use truss roofs, panelized walls, larger prefab
components and just tilt it up to put the house together, the
better off you are,'' he said. ``You used to have to build stairs
by hand. Now, stairs come in a kit. Fireplace mantles may look
custom, but in reality they come in kits.''
<p>
   But others argue that prebuilt and panelized walls and roofing
systems contribute to the ``dumbing down'' of the construction
site. Chuck Lennon, a former executive director of the Building
Industry Association of South Florida, based in Miami, said:
``Requirements on the job site are not what they used to be. And
the men are working so fast they don't always pay attention to see
if their nails are hitting the wood or not.''
<p>
   He continued: ``When Hurricane Andrew hit, it was shocking to
see how many nails had never touched wood. If you're buying a
house, just make sure you've got a builder who's willing to come
back and fix things later.''
<p>
   The National Association of Home Builders is investigating the
possibility of establishing a nationwide uniform building code.
<p>
   Some experts say that most buyers agonize over the wrong things.
``People just want drop-dead,'' said Tom Kligerman, a Manhattan
architect, who was a project designer for Robert A.M. Stern. ``They
find it boring to spend money on foundations and stud walls. They'd
rather spend it on what they can see.''
<p>
   Stern, famous for the high polish of his luxury homes, said:
``It appears that what sells houses depends on having a tub large
enough for at least two people, and probably more; flashy stairs
that make a racket as if a horse were climbing them, and other
glitzy, totally unnecessary elements, as opposed to spatial or
constructional quality.''
<p>
   A survey of 3,583 potential home buyers, commissioned by the
builders' association and to be released on Sunday at its annual
convention in Houston, indicates that buyers want the kind of
features ``that just a few years ago were reserved for upscale
luxury homes,'' said Smith, the group's president. He rattled tHem
off: nine-foot ceilings, Corian counters, pantries and the newly
trendy ``great room''  &MD;  a gussied-up recreation room that has moved
upstairs and has acquired a fireplace, wet bar and media center.
<p>
   Spencer Goliger, an architect in Palm Beach, Fla., said: ``We're
seeing a lot more faux finishes for that Old World look. People are
not interested in the real dimensions of wood or what it can do,
but just how it looks. So you get plywood that looks like cherry;
moldings made of plastic. People want to capture a certain look as
cheaply as possible.''

<p>
   Perhaps we are headed for Disney-style theme parks in our own
homes, with counters that look like nice slabs of granite but are
actually made of the thinnest veneer glued to concrete, where miles
of molding are made of polystyrene, the building block of coffee
cups.
<p>
   ``There's no doubt that people are in the market for quality,''
said Tom Murphy, a custom builder in Miami, whose clients have
included Oprah Winfrey and Sylvester Stallone. ``The big question
is, Are they getting something that's sound or junk with perfume on
it?''
One person who knows is Donald Baerman, part architect, part
sleuth. Based in North Haven, Conn., he teaches a course in
architecture at Yale University and is often hired by architects
and lawyers to sniff out potential design lapses and construction
defects. In his 37 years as a consultant, he has seen it all, from
collapsed roofs to insufficiently supported hot tubs. (It was
Baerman who detected the early design flaw in the Eisner house; the
architects say they do not remember the problem at all.)
<p>
   ``I've seen buildings that cut every corner that can be cut,''
Baerman said one day last month as he toured the site of a new
house in a proliferating development in Mount Kisco, N.Y., within
easy commuting distance of Manhattan. On a day trip organized to
instruct a reporter on what passes for quality in construction
these days, Baerman, a young 65 with furry eyebrows worthy of a
Muppet, was equipped with a Swiss Army knife, a pointer flashlight
and, he said, ``a geezer memory for details.'' As further testament
to his devotion to quality, he wore leather shoes that he had made
himself.
<p>
   The house, a brick veneer, twin-gabled, two-story affair, was
built by Toll Brothers, the development company that is based
outside Philadelphia and was a 1995 winner of the National
Association of Home Builders' quality award.
<p>
   The house, albeit a new sales model, is typical of many in the
region: about 3,500 square feet, with neo-traditional styling,
peaked roofs, a master suite, a chef's kitchen and a base price of
$546,950. The model was fitted with enough optional upgrades  &MD; 
marble in the master bathroom, window wells in the basement  &MD;  to
bring it up to $620,000.
<p>
   ``I look for real defects, not how much swank you can get for
the buck,'' Baerman said. And despite some general gripes about
typical industry practices like putting unyielding brick veneer on
a wood frame that expands and contracts (it could lead to leaks
around doors and windows, ``but then everybody does it,'' he said),
Baerman was pleasantly assured by what he found.
<p>
   Not that the house got off without any complaints. ``Houses
between $300,000 and $1 million are about the same,'' he said. ``To
do it really right is much more expensive, and there are still no
guarantees.''
<p>
   Stepping through mulch chips, he tapped on a shutter.
``Plastic!'' he said. New bricks, he noted, had been stamped with a
fake patina to look handmade, but their uniform lines only
accentuated the artifice.
<p>
   He allowed himself a Ruskinian moment. ``Really good work shows
irregularities,'' he said, ``almost as if it were done by a skilled
laborer with some difficulties.''
<p>
   Surveying the exterior, he focused on the siding, a ``very
low-grade Redcedar, which is neither red nor cedar,'' he said. It
has a horizontal grain that might warp (``Look for vertical grain
siding,'' he advised). Wood siding should be painted on all
surfaces before installation to avoid rot, he said. Pointing out
the proximity to automatic lawn sprinklers, he gave the siding
about two years until the onset of rot should water be trapped on
the underside. (Rob Parahus, a vice president of Toll Brothers,
said the siding had been preprimed by the manufacturer.)
<p>
   After a brief appreciation of the cedar deck, which appeared to
be securely attached to the foundation with bolts (often only the
weight of the deck secures the posts to the ground), Baerman moved
inside and made a beeline for the windows. He sighed. The
vinyl-clad thermopane windows, though efficient, were much uglier
than wooden frames because of snap-in plastic mullions that come
out for easy cleaning but that can also snap off when eager
children grab on to look outdoors. Plastic-coated wire shelving in
all the closets, but especially the one in the front hall, seemed
inexcusable, he said, for such a costly house.
<p>
   In important ways, however, the house stood up well. In the
bathrooms, the tubs were made of cast iron, not steel or plastic.
``When you tap the sides,'' Baerman said, ``look for a sound that
goes `thunk, thunk,' not `ping, ping.' '' In the basement, a steel
girder gave extra support to the floor above, and a beam of
structural fabricated wood reinforced the upstairs kitchen island.
<p>
   Pocketing his flashlight, Baerman made his judgment: ``I've seen
really bad construction, and this is not it. There's nothing
insidious hidden from the eye. I get good vibes, and I always trust
my instincts.''
<p>
   When reached for comment, Parahus said: ``Our houses are built
with today's consumers in mind. And above all, they want
ease-of-maintenance products in their homes. Those snap-in mullions
and vinyl-coated shelves are in demand.''
<p>
   Ever philosophical, and ever snug in his homemade shoes, Baerman
concluded: ``A hundred years ago, it wasn't all that different.
There are good builders and bad ones in every era. Today, there's a
tendency to give people what they can see. And there's nothing
wrong with that as long as people don't forget what really superb
workmanship is about, even if they can't afford it.''

<p>
   PARK CITY, Utah  &MD;  They may be ugly, blind and foul, but they're
among the major attractions at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. And
when hairless pink mole rats start looking like movie stars, it's
proof that Park City is witnessing Bizarro Sundance this year.
<p>
   This festival, the pre-eminent showcase for American independent
film, hit its high-water mark last year with a phenomenal array of
appealing, accessible features (among them ``Big Night,'' ``Welcome
to the Dollhouse,'' ``Looking for Richard,'' ``Walking and
Talking,'' ``The Whole Wide World'' and ``Citizen Ruth''). And
Sundance is sure to be represented on Oscar night, not only by
``Shine,'' last year's smash hit, but by ``Jerry Maguire,'' which
has the sweet, quirky spirit that so often prevails here.
<p>
   So expectations ran high for another crowd-pleasing festival,
but so far the oddities have prevailed. Aside from those mole rats,
who star with robots, topiary animals and a lion tamer in Errol
Morris' strange and wonderful ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control,''
some of the outstanding sights here have been a dying masochist, a
mad young woman who enjoys re-enacting President John F. Kennedy's
assassination and a wild woodsman in a Davy Crockett hat.
<p>
   Here's one more oddity: Good-hearted hookers are out of
business. Most of the working girls in movies have secretarial jobs
this year.
<p>
   ``I'm representing a lot of good, interesting films, but if I
were a distributor, I honestly wouldn't know what to do with
them,'' said one publicist who naturally preferred to remain
nameless.
<p>
   ``It's just a down cycle,'' said Bingham Ray of October Films.
<p>
   Michael Barker of Sony Classics, which will distribute Morris'
film, said, ``A lot of the films here don't fit any conventional
idea of what might work in the marketplace.''
<p>
   Speaking of another movie his company will distribute, ``The
Myth of Fingerprints,'' he said, ``I think one of the reasons that
film has been well received here is that everything else is so
warped and strange.''
<p>
   Morris, the director of ``The Thin Blue Line'' and ``A Brief
History of Time,'' certainly represents the bizarre at its best. A
brilliantly idiosyncratic filmmaker with the most appealing aspects
of a mad scientist, he sounded delighted to have made a film that
fits no known category and has been admiringly received as a
metaphysical harbinger of the 21st century.
<p>
   ``This is sort of the sore thumb that sticks out in the middle
of everything,'' he said, looking very pleased about that. Morris
mentioned in passing that when Harvard University once asked him to
teach a course, he suggested doing something on home appliances.
<p>
   ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control'' interweaves conversations
with four obsessive characters, all somehow seeking philosophical
knowledge in worlds beyond human experience. (This is where the
habits of mole rats come in.)
<p>
   ``They're embracing a world that might actually exclude us,''
said Morris, who cheerfully acknowledged that he shares the
mind-set of his eccentric subjects. ``I think it's more than
fair,'' he said. ``I'm one of them.''
<p>
   However rarefied his thoughts, Morris is not beyond having made
a set of 7-Eleven commercials for a sum greater than the entire
$1.1 million budget of ``The Thin Blue Line.'' After all, nobody
comes to Sundance without at least a passing interest in the
business realities of getting a film off the ground.
<p>
   Tom DiCillo has one of this festival's most hair-raising
hard-luck stories as well as one of its most likable films, the
artfully whimsical ``Box of Moonlight,'' which was five years in
the making and had been repeatedly passed on by the bigger
independent distributors. (Trimark, a lower-profile distributor,
bought it Wednesday.)
<p>
   But DiCillo came here prepared for the worst, even though his
delightful ``Living in Oblivion'' was one of Sundance's biggest
successes two years ago.
<p>
   ``Box of Moonlight,'' with a quixotic magic reminiscent of
Scottish filmmaker Bill Forsyth's ``Local Hero,'' sends a
straight-arrow electrical engineer (played by John Turturro) on a
wild voyage of self-discovery. His companion is a long-haired
renegade played by Sam Rockwell, who is so good in the film that he
has been wandering around Park City hearing the mating cry of the
client-poaching Hollywood agent. (``Are you happy?'' ``Are you
OK?'')
<p>
   ``He's a movie star,'' affirmed Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, who
knows a thing or two about new talent. DiCillo, also good at
spotting star potential, found Rockwell during auditions for his
``Johnny Suede'' but later gave the title role to the equally
unknown Brad Pitt.
<p>
   Rockwell, who has shades of the same Pitt magnetism, faced the
challenge of trying to keep his hair long for years as he waited
for DiCillo to raise enough money to make the film. (Every so often
a role on a police show would interfere.)
<p>
   Meanwhile, DiCillo resisted the suggestion that he cast Jason
Priestley and fumed about financiers and distributors who turned
him down.
<p>
   ``Because this looks like it's happening,'' he said of the sale
to Trimark, ``I feel this extremely odd urge to punch these people.
But if you're going to be in this business, you have to digest
feathers, beaks and gnarly, wrinkled claws. You have to learn to
eat crow.''

<p>
   Well, that's preferable to any of the pursuits seen in ``Sick:
The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist,'' which is a
major conversation piece here. Sitting through Kirby Dick's raw,
stomach-turning documentary is an unalloyed challenge, but his film
proves as interesting as it is disturbing.
<p>
   Flanagan, a performance artist with tastes that could have made
Robert Mapplethorpe blush, shows off pitch-black humor along with
obscenely mutilated parts of his body. Relating his perversity to
his lifelong struggle with cystic fibrosis, the film offers a
wrenching exploration of crazy courage and pain. Even more
upsetting than its sadomasochistic exhibitionism is the sight of
Flanagan succumbing to torment he can no longer control. A series
of stills documents his death.
<p>
   Like most of the films at this overbooked, jam-packed festival,
``Sick'' isn't likely to generate a consensus. There are dozens of
moderately well received films but no overwhelming favorites yet,
although one thing is clear: Parker Posey is this year's It Girl at
Sundance.
<p>
   In ``Suburbia,'' the understated comedy ``Clockwatchers'' and
the gothic, theatrical ``House of Yes,'' Ms. Posey plays the
brittle, dangerous vamp with star presence and shocking intensity.
She's especially memorable as the main attraction in ``The House of
Yes,'' which is filled with dark secrets and provocative
re-enactments of Kennedy's assassination. Tori Spelling plays
(quite nicely) the role of a simple young woman awed by her
fiance's big house. Bizarro Sundance indeed.
<p>
   Traces of last year's more benign spirit can be found in ``I
Love You . . . Don't Touch Me!,'' a very funny and knowing romantic
comedy directed by Julie Davis. Meeting the 28-year-old Ms. Davis
is cause for a double-take, since she looks and sounds just like
her film's heroine, played by her longtime friend Marla Schaffel.
<p>
   ``The reason I don't get up and introduce the movie beforehand
is that I don't want to confuse anybody,'' said Ms. Davis, who
still has the appealing spontaneity that works so well for her
film. She said that she had thus far earned a grand total of $550
as a director (she otherwise works as a film editor), and that she
burst into tears over the small screen and fuzzy acoustics that are
standard in Park City.
<p>
   Meanwhile, from a different universe, Roland Emmerich and Dean
Devlin are also in town. Thanks to ``Independence Day,'' these two
now represent the last word in independent cinema, which means that
they have started their own production company,
Centropolis-Streamline, to encourage the genre filmmaking they
love. They will be able to make their monster of a new project,
``Godzilla,'' with an absolutely free hand. And they brought their
staff here for skiing, film watching and mingling with other
filmmakers.
<p>
   ``We made friends with Bryan Singer here,'' said Devlin. `` `The
Usual Suspects' is really more of a genre film than you'd think,''
he noted of Singer's film noir.
<p>
   ``You know what?'' said Emmerich. ``This is where it's fun.''

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as
disappointing earnings from International Business Machines Corp.
kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average from setting another record.
Rising health and bank shares boosted the broader market.
<p>
   The Dow industrials fell 33.87 to 6850.03, snapping a streak of
four consecutive closing highs. IBM dropped 10 to 158. Had IBM
finished the day unchanged, the 30-stock average would have risen
3.03 points.
<p>
   The benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index rose to a record,
gaining 3.51 to 786.23. Leading the advance were Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Exxon Corp. and Intel Corp., all of which reported strong earnings
in the past 10 days. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 11.09 to an
all-time high of 1388.06.
<p>
   ``We'll have some earnings disappointments,'' and those
companies' shares will suffer, said Kenneth Corba, chief investment
officer at Eagle Asset Management, which oversees $2.7 billion.
Still, ``I don't think the market's overvalued in the context of
all of the positives: You have declining interest rates, corporate
America's become more profitable and more competitive. We're in an
hospitable environment.''
<p>
   Investors pouring money into mutual funds continued to boost
shares. Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter that tracks money going
to mutual funds, said assets are pouring in at a $28.4 billion
monthly pace, $500 million short of the record set last January.
<p>
   ``You're having tremendous demand for stocks,'' said Philip
Brown, president of Meridian Investment Co., with $3.7 billion in
equities. ``You have an economy that isn't doing that bad.
Corporate profits aren't declining -- they just aren't going to be
up as much.''
<p>
   Declining shares topped those that advanced by a margin of 1,321
to 1,182 on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the sixth heaviest
trading day ever, with 586 million shares exchanging hands.
<p>
   IBM, which rose 56 percent in the past year, said profit rose 18
percent. A stronger dollar and weak demand in Europe hampered
gains. Net income for the computer maker rose to $3.93 a share, 3
cents below analysts' expectations. Today's 6 percent decline in
IBM shares reduced their value about the same level as three weeks
earlier.
<p>
   Coming on the heels of surprisingly good numbers from Intel and
Microsoft, other computer-industry shares held up amid IBM's
retreat.
<p>
   Oracle Corp. gained 5/8 to 42 3/8. Microsoft Corp. rose 2 3/8 to
97 3/8 and Intel jumped 4 1/16 to 152 1/8, a peak as well.
<p>
   ``I don't think IBM is the bellwether for technology, any more
than General Motors is the bellwether for the U.S. economy,'' said
Sally Anderson, a senior money manager at Kopp Investment Advisors,
which oversees $3.4 billion and holds about $8 million of IBM
stock.
<p>
   ``The economy has become much more diverse,'' Anderson said.
``There have been so many new companies, and they've diluted the
impact of the big ones.''
<p>
   The impact of IBM's disappointment was offset by
better-than-expected profits at the No. 1 maker of personal
computers, Compaq Computer Corp. The Houston-based computer maker
said earnings gained 43 percent, to $1.64 a share, surpassing
expectations by 11 cents. Compaq jumped 5 to 83 1/2.
<p>
   Other PC makers gained. Gateway 2000 Inc., a mail-order computer
retailer, rose 3 1/2 to 62 5/8. Rival Dell Computer Corp. rose 2
5/8 to 66 3/4.
<p>
   Dean Witter Discover &AMP; Co., the brokerage and credit card
issuer, said profit rose 28 percent, topping forecasts. Its shares
gained 7/8 to 38.
<p>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. earnings rose 11 percent to $1.43 a
share, 2 cents above analysts' expectations, according to IBES
International Inc. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 123 1/8.
<p>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson jumped 3 7/8 to a record 57 3/8. The
health-care product company gained 2 1/2 yesterday, after reporting
a 20 percent jump in earnings. Its shares have risen 34 percent in
the past year.
<p>
   Drugmakers rallied as the disappointment from IBM prodded
investors to bid up shares with the ``highest earnings
predictability,'' said Eagle Asset's Corba. Merck &AMP; Co. rose 1 7/8
to 88 3/8, and Pfizer Inc. gained 1 5/8 to 88 1/4.
<p>
   ``The broad market is set up for more disappointments,'' he
said. Travelers Buyback
<p>
   Norand Corp., a maker of mobile computers, surged 13 5/8 to 33
after Western Atlas Inc. said it would pay $261.3 million, or
$33.50 a share in cash, for all of Norand's 7.8 million shares.
Western Atlas fell 2 to 70 1/8.
<p>
   Travelers Group Inc. jumped to a record after saying it would
buy $1 billion in stock and boost its dividend 33 percent to 15
cents a quarter. Shares gained 2 3/8 to 53 5/8.
<p>
   Exxon rose 2 3/8 to a all-time high of 106.
<p>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller shares added 0.33 to a record
307.65, while the broader Wishire 5000 index rose 27.22 to 7594.85.
<p>
   Shares and options of Medaphis Corp., a health-care data
processing company, jumped amid speculation it would be bought out
by HBO &AMP; Co. or National Data Corp. Its stock rose 1 11/16 to 13
1/4 in trading of 7.3 million shares, quadruple its three-month
daily average. Options to buy Medaphis shares at $12.50 each by
Feb. 22 more than doubled to 2 1/4 from 7/8.
<p>
   HBO dropped 3/4 to 62 3/8. National Data was unchanged at 45
5/8.
<p>
   Steris Corp. sank 8 3/4 to 29 1/4 after Bill Sanford, the
company's chairman and chief executive, told the Dow Jones news
service he expects the medical device company to earn 38 cents a
share in the fiscal third quarter, below analysts' average
expectation of 53 cents, according to IBES.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. said its profit rose to 76 cents a share from 68
cents a year earlier. Analysts expected 80 cents a share, according
to IBES International Inc. The long-distance company's fell 1/2 to
38 7/8.
<p>
   Some companies that beat earnings estimates for last quarter but
fell anyway, as investors expected weakening results down the road.
<p>
   Computer Associates International Inc. retreated 2 3/4 to 43 1/4
after reporting profit rose 25 percent. The company's shares have
fallen 30 percent since Dec. 27, when it warned that software sales
in Europe wouldn't match year-earlier levels.
<p>
   U.S. Robotics slipped 1 3/8 to 72 1/4 after matching profit
forecasts. Concern arose that higher inventory would drag down
future earnings.
<p>
   Gains in stocks were muted as the yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond rose 5 basis points to 6.83 percent. The yield is
used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing costs, so when it rises
it can hurt companies' bottom lines.
<p>
   Banks continued to rally on the back of yesterday's strong
earnings reports from Citicorp, up 2 5/8 to 114 3/4, and Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co., up 8 3/8 to 297 1/8.
<p>
   Chase Manhattan Corp., which missed Wall Street estimates
yesterday, fell 1/2 to 92 3/8.

   Jack Riley Scholarship
<p>
   Former players and friends will assemble at West Point, N.Y., on
Saturday to announce the formation of a scholarship fund named
after Jack Riley, who coached the Army teams for 36 years and
served the Military Academy in many other ways.
<p>
   Riley's third son, Rob, now coaches the team, which will play
Yale at the Tate Rink. A small ceremony has been planned between
the second and third periods and Jack Riley will be present.
<p>
   The Jack Riley Scholarship is intended to help a deserving
candidate prepare academically for the Academy by attending the
West Point prep school at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and it will be
administered by the Association of Graduates, the alumni
organization.
<p>
   Riley, an ace at Dartmouth before and after World War II, began
his coaching career at Army in 1950. In the early years, many of
his skaters were football players better at throwing checks than
passing the puck. The advantage he had was the enormous size of the
old Smith rink, which sometimes exhausted the foe's good skaters.
<p>
   Yale is an appropriate opponent for the occasion. Riley once
said he liked every Yale man he had ever met. And how many had he
met? ``Two,'' he replied. One was his 1948 Olympic teammate, Fred
Pearson of West Newbury, Mass., who will be present Saturday.
<p>
   The current Army team (12-9-2) is the best the Academy has had
since leaving the ECAC six years ago, when its officials felt it no
longer could compete. Now playing a mix of Division I and Division
III opponents, Army has tied both Princeton and Cornell, the ECAC
leaders, and boasts an outstanding goalie in Daryl Chamberlain.
<p>
   NCAA Anniversary
<p>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association's championship
tournament will be played for the 50th time this season, at
Milwaukee on March 27-29, and the milestone will be noted with an
all-star team selected by present and past coaches.
<p>
   A total of 144 players has been nominated. The selection was
limited to those whose teams were good enough to qualify to play in
the tournament.
<p>
   Jack Riley was not nominated but his brothers Bill and Joe,
Dartmouth contemporaries, were named. They played in the first NCAA
tournament, a four-team affair in 1948 at Colorado Springs, where
Michigan defeated Dartmouth, 8-4, to take the crown.
<p>
   Michigan, which has sent teams to 19 tournaments, has the most
players on the ballot, 16, compared with 15 for Boston University,
and 12 for Minnesota. Yet the Golden Gophers have had 23 tournament
teams, the most of any college, and the Terriers have had 22.
<p>
   Hockey East
<p>
   Underdog Boston College managed to tie Boston University twice,
5-5 and 4-4, thanks to the Eagles' best player, Marty Reasoner, and
its fabulous freshman, Jeff Farkas.
<p>
   Reasoner scored two goals in the last five minutes of the third
period to tie the first game and Farkas had two goals and two
assists in the weekend contests.
<p>
   The Eagles did not stop Chris Drury, who scored three times for
a total of seven goals against BC in three games this season. BU
has now played to five ties, a Terrier record, and has a home game
Saturday against Maine, a rival that has won eight of its last 10
matches.
<p>
   ECAC Women
<p>
   The Northeastern coach, Heather Linstad, had her team ready for
the three-day Providence tournament and the Huskies took two steps
forward with 4-3 victories over the host Friars and New Hampshire.
<p>
   These three have long been the dominant teams in women's hockey.
In the finale, however, Concordia of Montreal beat the Huskies,
5-2. Cammi Granato, who played for Providence as a senior four
years ago, continues to skate for Concordia under different
eligibility rules and was the tournament's most valuable performer.
<p>
   Hamilton
<p>
   The euphoria of a rare victory over Middlebury (8-3) did not
last long at Hamilton (10-3). After the tense 3-2 victory on home
ice over the Panthers, the defending Division III national
champions, the Continentals went through the motions the next day
and lost to Norwich, 7-2, ending a nine-game winning streak.
<p>
   Middlebury bounced back to edge Williams, 6-5, on the way home.
The Hamilton-Middlebury series now stands 62-29-2 in favor of the
Panthers. Norwich, picked for 10th place by the coaches in the
preseason poll, is tied for first in ECAC East with Middlebury,
each at 7-1. Then comes St. Anselm, 7-2, and Hamilton, 6-2.
<p>
   Slap Shots
<p>
    &MD;  Princeton, during a two-week break for exams, remains first in
the ECAC, a precarious and peculiar place for the Tigers. Only two
of their eight league victories have come against winning teams and
they return to the ice Jan. 31 with a challenging road test against
second-place Cornell.
<p>
    &MD;  Denver outshot last-place Michigan Tech in a Western
Association match by 49-18 and came out with a 4-4 tie. The hero
had to be Tech's goalie, L.G. Caravaggio, who had 45 saves in 65
minutes of play.
<p>
    &MD;  Goalie Dan Murphy stopped 25 Vermont shots and the leading
scorer Todd White had both goals Saturday night as Clarkson ended
the Catamounts' six-game winning streak in a pivotal 2-1 road
victory between the ECAC's best teams.

 &UR; U.S. SENATE CONFIRMS ALBRIGHT, COHEN FOR STATE, DEFENSE POSTS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Jenny Tomkin &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate today confirmed
Madeline Albright as the first woman to be U.S. secretary of State
and approved William Cohen as secretary of Defense, putting a
Republican in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet. Albright, who
served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nation's in the first
Clinton administration, was the first appointee to Democrat
Clinton's second-term cabinet to be approved by the
Republican-controlled Senate. Today's 99-0 vote, the first Senate
floor vote this year, came two days after the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee unanimously recommended that she be confirmed.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``Notwithstanding our differences, Mrs. Albright is a lady who
understands Congress and the important role that it must play in
developing U.S. foreign policy'', said Sen. Jesse Helms, a North
Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
<p>
   The vote to confirm Cohen, a former senator from Maine, was also
99-to-0. Cohen's former colleagues on the Senate Armed Services
Committee had recommended him unanimously.
<p>
   Senators, who have the right to advise and consent to a
president's Cabinet nominees, also held committee hearings today on
Andrew Cuomo to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development and
Bill Daley to be secretary of Commerce.
<p>
   Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, received a
friendly hearing, and the Senate Banking Committee is likely to
recommend his conformation next week.
<p>
   Daley, a Chicago lawyer and the son of former Chicago mayor
Richard Daley and brother of that city's current mayor, Bill Daley,
faced tougher questioning by the Senate Commerce Committee.
Nevertheless, he is also likely to get Senate approval, perhaps
later this week.
<p>
   At Daley's hearing, Republican senators said the Commerce
Department has become a job haven for people who have helped the
administration politically. Republicans also criticized department
trade missions led by the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, which
they said involved fundraising activities for the Democrat Party.
Department programs that fund corporate research and development
also came under the Republican spotlight.
<p>
   Daley agreed to work with the Senate to resolve these issues.
<p>
   Several other Clinton nominees await confirmation, including
Charlene Barshefsky to be U.S. Trade Representative. She has been
acting trade representative since April 1996, when her predecessor,
Mickey Kantor, took over the Commerce Department to replace Brown.
<p>
   Barshefsky faces some opposition because of a 1995 law that
forbids anyone who has worked for a foreign government from being
appointed to the top U.S. trade position. Barshefsky worked briefly
in the early 1980's as an adviser for Canadian lumber interests.
<p>
   The White House asked Congress to exempt Barshefsky on grounds
she took her earlier government position in 1993, before the law
took effect.
<p>
   In spite of the obstacle, Barshefsky is likely to be confirmed
by the Senate before she leaves for Geneva Feb. 12 to attend World
Trade Organization talks to open global telecommunication markets.
<p>
   In the debate on Albright today, Democrats and Republicans alike
praised her, as has much of the U.S. corporate community, which
likes her pro-business positions. She particularly pleased business
leaders at her Jan. 8 confirmation hearing when she told the
Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. must seek to engage, not
isolate China, the world's most populous nation. Albright testified
that U.S. trade with Asia, particularly China, is high on the
Clinton administration's agenda. ``In Asia,'' she said, ``China is
rapidly emerging as the next great power in our era.'' Mattel Inc.,
and Boeing Co., are among the major U.S. companies with financial
interests in China.
<p>
   Albright also promised to protect U.S. companies and workers in
international trade disputes.
<p>
   ``A principle responsibility of the Department of State is to
see that American companies and workers receive fair treatment and
that inequitable barriers to competition are overcome,'' she told
the Foreign Relations Committee.
<p>
   Clinton's choice of Cohen for the top defense post represented
an olive branch to the Republican-controlled Congress. Republicans
praised Cohen at his confirmation hearing, with Arizona Sen. John
McCain citing his ``personal and very deep friendship.''
<p>
   Cohen takes the helm of the Defense Department as this year's
spending decisions on defense are pretty much settled. Clinton, in
his Feb. 6 budget request, likely will seek $258.8 billion for
defense, about $9 billion less than the $268 billion Congress has
recommended. Republicans have the votes to add several billion
dollars of the extra money they seek.
<p>
   Democrats and Republicans agree that the military, after years
of shrinking budgets in the wake of the Cold War's end, needs to
replace or upgrade aging weapons and other equipment.
<p>
   Some major decisions on weapons purchases, such as on
development of a multi-billion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter, the
purchase of F/A-18 E/F fighters from McDonnell Douglas Corp., and
commissioning of a Seawolf nuclear submarine from General Dynamics
Corp.'s Electric Boat Division at Groton, Connecticut, have been
resolved.
<p>
   Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. were chosen in November to
compete for the Joint Strike Fighter, a program that could cost at
least $100 billion during the next three decades.

 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Reggie White is the minister of defense, and the
football field is his pulpit. This week, the world is White's
congregation because he is using Super Bowl XXXI to spread the word
of God to more than 50 countries.
<p>
   White, who might be the best defensive end in NFL history, and
Green Bay teammate Brett Favre share the cover of this week's Time
magazine. In New Orleans, White is like a Pied Piper for the news
media, because reporters, photographers and cameramen follow him
everywhere.
<p>
   ``It's taken me so long to get to the Super Bowl,'' White, 35,
said with a smile. ``If I had never made it, there would have been
a void in my professional life but not in my personal life.''
<p>
   White looks around the room at several hundred media types and
spreads his hands.
<p>
   White, who is a preacher from Tennessee involved in charities in
his home state and Wisconsin, almost has completed the 12th year of
his NFL career and his fourth with Green Bay. He also played two
years in the defunct United States Football League and recently
signed a contract guaranteeing he will finish his career in Green
Bay.
<p>
   ``My championship is to reach the Kingdom of God,'' White said
in a raspy voice. ``I get more excitement seeing lives change for
the benefit of Christ than anything I see on the field.''
<p>
   Another reason White is here is to help the Packers beat New
England and win their first championship in 29 years. To win the
Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the former Green Bay coach who
won five titles, including the first two Super Bowls, they will
have to overcome Patriots coach Bill Parcells, who has a 5-0 record
in NFC and AFC championship games and Super Bowls.
<p>
   ``Bill's an excellent coach, but I'm mad at him,'' White said,
frowning as if actually angry. ``I want to let him know again that
he cost me two Super Bowl rings. The Giants had a chance to draft
me in the (USFL) supplemental draft (1984), but he took (offensive
tackle) Gary Zimmerman instead. I've tried to make things rough for
him.''
<p>
   When White hears a question he does not expect, he hesitates
before answering and cocks his head to the left. This particular
question involves athletes as role models.
<p>
   ``I think the role-model thing is somewhat overrated,'' he said.
``I think people need to start looking for heroes. But they need to
put stipulations on those heroes. You can be a positive or negative
role model, but a hero is someone with high integrity and high
morality and, to me, one who serves God.''
<p>
   ``You look at guys like (Green Bay safety) Eugene Robinson,
(Green Bay tight end) Keith Jackson and (Washington cornerback)
Darrell Green. Those guys are great fathers and husbands. They're
the guys our young people should want to be like.''
<p>
   Jackson and White were teammates in Philadelphia, where the
Eagles blew three chances to reach the Super Bowl under Buddy Ryan.
As they aged, Jackson and White thought they might never reach the
biggest game of them all.
<p>
   ``After we beat Carolina (NFC Championship Game on Jan. 12),
Reggie was going around the room thanking everybody for helping him
finally get to the Super Bowl,'' said Jackson, one of White's
closest friends.
<p>
   ``We told him we were happy, too, that we didn't do it for
him.''
<p>
   It was White who persuaded Jackson to come to Green Bay in 1995
after the Packers acquired him from Miami. Jackson was going to
retire rather than move to Green Bay.
<p>
   One reason defensive end Sean Jones left the Oilers is because
he wanted to play with White, who preceded him to Green Bay by a
year. With a combined 25 years of NFL experience, White and Jones
are like antique bookends.
<p>
   ``Reggie's impact on this team reaches far beyond football,''
Jones said.
<p>
   ``He stands for so much. He respects the challenges of social
issues, and he doesn't just talk about it. He actually does
something about it.''
<p>
   By his admission, White has been a leader of men since he was a
boy growing up in Knoxville, Tenn.
<p>
   ``I just accept my role,'' he said. ``Leadership qualities are
embedded in all of us. If you want to be a follower, that's all
you'll ever be.
<p>
   It hasn't taken long for White to become a legend in a
football-mad city that worships legends.
<p>
   ``I felt the tradition as soon as I got to Green Bay,'' White
said. ``I opened up a letter one day, and it was from Bart Starr. I
thought, `Oh, my God.' Bart Starr sent me a letter. I talk to guys
like Ray Nitschke, Willie Davis and Herb Adderley. They're a big
part of Packer tradition, and I want to be part of that tradition,
too.''~

<p>
   Beverly Hills, California, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Western Atlas
Inc. said it will buy Norand Corp. for $261.3 million in cash to
expand its business that uses mobile computers to track inventory,
billing and other services.
<p>
   Houston-based Western Atlas said it would pay $33.50 for each
Norand share, a 73 percent premium over yesterday's closing price.
Norand stock today rose 13 5/8, or 70 percent, to 33, its highest
since September 1995.
<p>
   Western Atlas, based in Beverly Hills, California, provides
seismic information and well-logging data to companies searching
for oil and natural gas, as well as automation and data collection
systems. Norand makes mobile computers and wireless data
communications networks used to route accounting information and
manage inventory databases.
<p>
   Buying Norand ``will establish Western Atlas as the company with
the broadest technology range and most extensive distribution
network in the industrial automated data collection and mobile
computing solutions industries,'' Alton Brann, Western Atlas
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
<p>
   Norand products used by the car rental, automotive and food and
beverage industries will complement the automated-data collection
services of Western Atlas's Intermec unit, Brann said.
<p>
   Norand, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, had revenue of $69.4
million in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31. Western Atlas, which
hasn't reported 1996 earnings yet, had 1995 revenue of $2.23
billion, including $957.8 million from its industrial automation
division.
<p>
   Western Atlas shares fell 2 to 70 1/8.
<p>
   Norand's stock was the biggest gainer in U.S. composite trading.
Almost 5.4 million shares traded, more than 108 times its
three-month daily average of 49,578.

 &UR; INVESTMENT ADVISERS GROW MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT U.S. STOCKS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Investment advisers were more
optimistic about the outlook for U.S. stocks last week for the
third time in four weeks.
<p>
   A survey of 140 people by the Investors Intelligence newsletter
found the percentage of advisers who said they were ``bullish,'' or
optimistic about the prospects for stocks, rose to 52 percent from
50.8 percent in the previous survey.
<p>
   The increase in investor optimism coincided with a rally in the
stock market. In the week ended Jan. 17, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average jumped 129.31 points, or 1.93 percent, to a record 6833.19.
<p>
   Some 28.8 percent of investors surveyed last week described
themselves as ``bearish,'' or pessimistic about the outlook for
share prices, down from 31.4 percent the week before.
<p>
   The proportion of advisers who said they foresee a
``correction,'' or a drop in prices of about 10 percent during a
12-month period, rose to 18.2 percent from 17.8 percent a week
before.
<p>
   The combined percentage of advisers who are either outright
bearish or expect a correction in prices fell to 48 percent from
49.2 percent the week before.
<p>
   The increasing optimism may be a bad omen for the market's
future performance, according to contrarian investors, who point
out advisers are more optimistic about stocks only after they have
bought. That means many investors have already finished their
purchases, leaving fewer to drive prices higher. yz A case in
point: Optimism reached 56 percent in the week ended Nov. 29, 1996,
the highest since early 1992. The following week, the Dow
industrials dropped 2.1 percent.

   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell as much as
$1.25 billion of securities.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern is currently engaged in a bidding war to
acquire Conrail Inc., and has an offer outstanding to acquire up to
8.2 million Conrail shares for $115 each, or a total of $943
million. Conrail, based in Philadelphia, has agreed to merge with
CSX Corp. at $110 a share.
<p>
   The shelf registration statement that Norfolk Southern filed
today gives the company the flexibility to raise the $1.25 billion
through the sale of debt securities and preferred and common stock.
<p>
   The Norfolk, Virginia, company, parent to the Norfolk Southern
Railway Co., would use the proceeds to repurchase its own common
stock, retire some or all of its short-term debt, and acquire
property, such as locomotives and rolling stock. Norfolk Southern
may also use some of the funds for general corporate purposes, the
SEC filing said.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern may use underwriters to sell the securities,
whose terms will be available in a supplemental prospectus. Company
shares rose 1 today to close at 88 1/8.

 &UR; CHICAGO FED SEES SOME SIGNS OF HIGHER WAGES: BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago is seeing the first signs of higher labor costs in the
Midwest in about a year, a Chicago Fed economist said.
<p>
   Companies are willing for the first time in about a year to
raise wages to attract temporary workers, Bob Schnorbus, senior
economist and assistant vice president, told the Bloomberg Forum.
<p>
   ``These are very modest increases, but it seems to be signaling
for the first time that employers themselves are showing some
willingness to pay higher wages in order to get the workers they
need,'' Schnorbus said
<p>
   The Chicago Fed economist's remarks followed the release today
of the Federal Reserve's ``beige book,'' an economic survey based
on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks, including Chicago.
<p>
   The report said it found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for
higher wages. The beige book will help form the basis for
discussion of interest rate targets at meeting of the Fed's
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Feb. 4 and 5.
<p>
   Temporary-help agencies tend to be sensitive to pressures
building in the labor market, Schnorbus said.
<p>
   ``These are where the marginal decisions are being made and
where we would expect to see the earliest signs of wage pressures
if they are occurring in the economy,'' he said.
<p>
   Further, state agencies are getting more requests from companies
to conduct wage and salary surveys, he said. That could mean that
businesses are beginning to think about increasing starting
salaries or raising existing salaries to retain workers, he said.
<p>
   Fed officials have been keeping a close eye on labor costs.
Their concern is that higher wages could force companies to raise
prices and spark high inflation. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told
the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that the era of low wage
gains may be ending.
<p>
   But ``what we're seeing now in an anecdotal sense is a long way
from being translated to real price increases,'' Schnorbus said.
<p>
   Separately, Schnorbus said he views the Midwest as the nation's
strongest regional economy, helped in large part by booming auto
production. U.S. automakers have been manufacturing at record
levels of about 15 million vehicles a year for the past three
years.
<p>
   ``We've been doing much better for a much longer time than other
regions,'' he said.

<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Name a currency, and chances
are Ricardo Faillace trades it.
<p>
   From his starkly-decorated, expansive office overlooking Park
Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East side, the 40-year-old head of
emerging markets trading at Banque Nationale de Paris bought and
sold some 120 currencies last year, from the Algerian dinar to the
Zambian kwacha. That's up from just 20 or so when he started out
eight years ago.
<p>
   ``Somehow, somewhere, someone is going to need a trade in every
currency,'' he said, poring over the day's relatively light trades
in ``only about 40 currencies.''
<p>
   Faillace isn't alone. More traders and financial institutions
are jumping into the sometimes risky business of buying and selling
the currencies of farthest-flung nations. They're chasing higher
yields and the chance to get a toehold in a growing corner of an
otherwise lackluster foreign exchange market.
<p>
   ``Before, traders were dealing only with major currencies,''
said Faillace. ``Nowadays, they are dealing with places they may
have trouble finding on a map.''
<p>
   Traders and analysts estimate that so-called ``exotic''
currencies account for a bit less than five percent of the $1.2
trillion traded each day in the foreign exchange market. By
century's end, though, they reckon that could swell to more than 20
percent, largely because of rising investment in the developing
world.
<p>
   ``While portfolio managers look for greater returns you're
seeing a global reallocation of assets toward Latin America, East
Europe and Asia,'' said Scott Schultz, an exotics trader at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
<p>
   In one measure of that change, foreign direct investment in
developing countries rose to $99.7 billion in 1995, up 15 percent
from 1994, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development.
<p>
   Those investments typically require foreigners to trade in
emerging countries' currencies.
<p>
   ``It's a simple matter of supply and demand,'' said Miguel
Perez-Santalla, an exotics trader at Manufacturers &AMP; Traders Trust
Co. ``As more people are doing more business in emerging countries,
they need those countries' currencies.''
<p>
   Also fueling exotics trading is the prospect of European
monetary union, which would ultimately eliminate many of the
world's most widely traded currencies, including the deutsche mark
and the French franc. The single European currency, the euro, is
due to be introduced Jan. 1, 1999.
<p>
   ``If and when Emu succeeds, there's going to be one currency, so
more and more people are going into emerging areas,'' said Donna
Fletcher, manager of Bank of Montreal's specialized currency unit.
``Where else are they going to go with their business? They gotta
go somewhere.''
<p>
   One mark of the growth in exotics trading is the proliferation
of separate trading desks for them even as many banks scale back
their currency operations thanks to mergers, new trading technology
and the advent of relatively stable exchange rates.
<p>
   ABN Amro Bank, Banque Indosuez and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell all
recently opened emerging markets trading desks in London.
<p>
   DMG employs between 30 and 35 exotics traders worldwide, while
Indosuez has 7 in London and ``likely will hire more in the
future,'' said exotics trader Darren Agombar.
<p>
   Though many folks deal in exotics in order to invest in emerging
countries, a growing number are chasing the higher returns they
often provide.
<p>
   The relatively small volume of trading in exotics makes them
riskier than taking a punt on the British pound. ``If you buy the
stuff you might get stuck with it because there's no one else to
buy it,'' said Perez-Santalla.
<p>
   Yet the potential rewards are higher, too, since the spreads
between bid and offer prices are greater. ``When you trade in a
currency like the Trinidadian and Tobagan dollar, you get a much
wider spread simply because the number of players is fewer,'' said
Bank of Montreal's Fletcher.
<p>
   Their spreads can be as much as five times wider than those on
more commonly-traded currencies.
<p>
   Many emerging countries are also making it easier to trade their
currencies. Last June and July, for instance, Russia lifted most
restrictions on trading the ruble. And China late last year
permitted convertibility on the current account, allowing companies
to trade the yuan to meet their import and export needs.
<p>
   Among the currencies in which traders expect volume will swell
are the Mexican peso, the Czech koruna, the Malaysian ringgit and
the yuan.
<p>
   Of course, growing volume will translate into tighter spreads --
and smaller profits. Already, there are several currencies,
including the koruna ``whose spreads are actually narrowing as
their countries are evolving financially, economically, politically
and as they are being traded by more participants,'' Fletcher said.
<p>
   Among the bigger risks inherent in trading exotics are political
unrest, a lack of information and labyrinthine banking regulations,
traders say.
<p>
   Political instability in a country can make investors reluctant
to invest there, damping demand for its currency.
<p>
   ``Right now it's like the Wild West,'' in some parts of the
developing world, said Perez-Santalla. ``There's still a lot of
political unrest. As long as you have that, you won't have
confidence in those countries' currencies.''
<p>
   Even so, a lot of countries experiencing political unrest still
have relatively stable currencies.
<p>
   ``I tend not to pay too much attention to cries of political
instability,'' said Faillace. ``The Russian ruble is still pretty
stable but the government is a mess.''
<p>
   For others, it's the paucity of reliable information that makes
trading in exotics perilous.
<p>
   ``Those countries are a little more esoteric than, say, Germany,
where you have access to a lot of published stuff on interest
rates, for example,'' said Brown Brothers' Scott Schultz. ``And the
information you do have -- who knows whether or not it's correct.''
<p>
   Faillace said that banking regulations also can be hard to
track, and vary from country to country.
<p>
   ``Analyzing banks or an accounting statement in Botswana is not
the same as doing that in Germany or the United States,'' he said.
<p>
   Yet such stumbling blocks don't deter everyone.
<p>
   Faillace could only think of four that he doesn't buy or sell --
the Cuban peso, North Korean won and the Libyan and Iraqi dinars --
and trade in those is illegal.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- `Super' individual retirement
accounts will spur Americans to save more money, a bipartisan group
of U.S. Senators and House members said today.
<p>
   The group, which includes Senate Finance Chairman William Roth,
a Republican from Delaware, and Sen. John Breaux, a Democrat from
Louisiana, proposed allowing the tax-sheltered accounts to be used
without penalty for education, small-business startups, first-time
home purchases, and long-term unemployment.
<p>
   Investment analysts said the plan would boost the savings rate
and improve the U.S. economy. ``Expanding the IRA is a win-win
proposition,'' said Robert C. Pozen, general counsel for Fidelity
Investments, the largest U.S. mutual fund company. ``Creating new
tax incentives for IRAs will encourage people to start saving
earlier for retirement and that will raise America's personal
savings rate.''
<p>
   Personal savings rates have fallen by half since 1970, according
to a report compiled by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Inc. Today, 4 percent
of disposable income in the U.S. goes to savings. That is less than
half of what the British and Germans save and a third as much of
what the Japanese and French save.
<p>
   ``The expanded IRA may be the single best broad-scale method to
increase savings by middle-class Americans without worsening our
budget deficit,'' said the investment house Dean Witter Discover &AMP;
Co. in a statement.
<p>
   Under the legislation, fully deductible IRAs would be available
to all Americans, regardless of income, by 2001. Currently, only
taxpayers without a pension plan and with incomes that do not
exceed $25,000 -- $40,000 for couples -- can qualify.
<p>
   The bill would also index the contribution limit for inflation;
allow homemakers to contribute $2,000 to an IRA instead of the
current $250; and create an ``IRA Plus Account.''
<p>
   Taxpayers who are ineligible for a regular IRA could put up to
$2,000 annually an IRA Plus account. They would pay taxes on their
contributions but not on the interest they earn. After age 59 1/2,
they would be allowed to withdraw from the account without paying
taxes.
<p>
   A 10 percent penalty would apply for early withdrawals. However,
the penalty would be waived if the withdrawal was used for a
first-time home purchase, educational expenses, or during periods
of unemployment. Taxpayers would be able to convert their current
IRAs into plus accounts without penalty.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Security Capital Group offered
to swap its real estate investment trust management and property
management companies for shares in affiliates Security Capital
Atlantic Inc., Security Capital Pacific Trust and Security Capital
Industrial Trust, the companies said.
<p>
   Security Capital Group officials declined to comment on the
terms of the offer, but analysts estimated a sale could net the
closely held company about $150 million to $210 million in stock,
analysts said.
<p>
   Security Capital Group currently manages the day-to-day
operations and properties of the REITS in exchange for a fee. In
Security Capital Pacific's case, that fee amounts to about $25
million a year, according Everen Securities real estate analyst
James Hoffman.
<p>
   Security Capital Group has about a 57 percent stake in Security
Capital Atlantic, a 46 percent stake in Security Capital Industrial
and a 38 percent stake in Security Capital Pacific.
<p>
   While the REIT industry in recent years has moved away from
hiring outside companies to manage its operations to avoid
potential conflicts of interest, the Security Capital companies
have gone against the trend.
<p>
   ``They are the last of the dinosaurs,'' said Hoffman. ``It
certainly has been a negative against the companies that they are
not self-managed.''
<p>
   Security Capital Atlantic Chairman Constance Moore said the move
makes sense because the three REITs, which all have market
capitalizations of $1 billion or more, are now large enough to run
their own operations efficiently.
<p>
   ``We are of sufficient size to gain economies of scale in our
operations and to let the savings flow to our shareholders,'' she
said.
<p>
   Also, with consolidation in the industry, the companies would be
able to make quicker decisions about buying other companies and
portfolios of properties, she said.
<p>
   Based in Atlanta, Security Capital Atlantic owns and operates
apartment properties in the Southeast. El Paso, Texas-based
Security Capital Pacific is one of the U.S.'s largest apartment
developers, owning about 60,00 units in the Southwest and West.
<p>
   Based in Aurora, Colorado, Security Capital Industrial is one of
the nation's largest owners of industrial and warehouse properties,
controlling a portfolio of more than 85 million square feet of
space.
<p>
   The REITs have set up special committees of independent
directors to evaluate the offer.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Six members of the U.S. House
Agriculture Committee left today for a trade mission to Chile and
Argentina amid concern a prospective U.S.-Chile free-trade
agreement may be of little benefit to American agriculture.
<p>
   The delegation, led by Chairman Bob Smith, Republican of Oregon,
said in a statement that lawmakers plan discussions on Chile's
request to become a part of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, and on food safety, trade barriers and liberalized
agricultural trade.
<p>
   U.S. crop subsidies are being phased down over the next six
years, placing an increasing emphasis on U.S. exports for income.
U.S. farmers count of exports for about 33 cents of each dollar in
farm income.
<p>
   ``New markets will be critical to maintaining stable farm
prices,'' Smith said.
<p>
   Among the biggest concerns, committee spokesman Dave Redmond
said, is that Chile currently bans imports of U.S. poultry, beef
and of wheat that's suspected of being infected with Karnal bunt
disease, a harmless fungus.
<p>
   ``The question is `Who gains? Who loses?''' if Chile enters
Nafta, Redmond said.
<p>
   Chile now exports about $11.5 billion in products to the U.S.,
with fish, forestry products and fresh fruits the major
agricultural products.
<p>
   The journey comes as Clinton administration expects Congress to
consider Chile in a new free trade agreement. The White House is
likely to seek ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate a trade deal,
which means Congress must accept or reject any final accord without
changes.
<p>
   Redmond said Chile's ban on major U.S. farm products is a key
concern, and that lawmakers will want to discuss how trade barriers
can be reduced or eliminated.
<p>
   In Argentina, lawmakers want to know how U.S. exports can be
increased, and also will examine the boom in Argentina's wheat
export industry. It's wheat prices have undercut U.S. wheat
shipments in recent months.
<p>
   Smith is accompanied by Rep. Charles Stenholm, Democrat of
Texas; Eva Clayton, Democrat of North Carolina; Thomas Ewing,
Republican of Illinois; and Sam Farr and Cal Dooley, California
Democrats.

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Exco Plc won a $1.15 million
ruling against Cantor Fitzgerald &AMP; Co. for payments owed by five
brokers who quit its broker-dealer unit to join Cantor.
<p>
   The ruling was handed down Jan. 8 by New York State Supreme
Judge Leland DeGrasse, but hasn't been widely disseminated. It
follows a $4.6 million verdict Exco won in November against Cantor
for hiring away interest-rate options traders from its Noonan,
Astley &AMP; Pearce unit.
<p>
   Exco's RMJ Securities Corp. unit sued Cantor in 1994 and 1995 to
collect money that five former brokers agreed to pay if they left
the firm before their contracts expired.
<p>
   ``The payout provisions are a reasonable means to provide RMJ
just compensation for its losses upon the contract defendants'
departure,'' DeGrasse said in his ruling.
<p>
   Cantor, which claimed the payments are illegal, is responsible
for the costs because it agreed to take legal responsibility for
the brokers after hiring them, RMJ attorney John Cambria said.
<p>
   Glen Kirwin, a senior broker at RMJ, agreed to pay $100,000 if
he left the firm before December 1996; Louis Spinelli, another
senior broker, agreed to pay $150,000 if he left before January
1997; William Minardi, a managing director, agreed to pay $350,000
if he left before December 1995; Gerald Byrne, a broker, agreed to
pay $200,000 if he left before December 1995; and Mark Colaio, head
of RMJ's government-agency securities desk, agreed to pay $350,000
if he left before August 1996, according to the ruling.
<p>
   Cambria said London-based Exco is seeking additional damages
against Cantor for business it says it lost from the brokers'
departure. RMJ, based in New York, deals in U.S. government
securities.
<p>
   Officials at Cantor weren't immediately available for comment.
<p>
   The two verdicts against Cantor come at a time when brokerages
are trying to fend off high-level defections in the increasingly
competitive securities industry.
<p>
   Cantor itself is a purveyor of such suits. Cantor Fitzgerald
International today sued rival Liberty Brokerage Investment Corp.
and its chairman, Edwin Payne, claiming they illegally hired away
20 of 24 employees responsible for its German and Belgian bond
brokerage business.
<p>
   Last May, PaineWebber inc. was ordered to pay rival Prudential
Securities Inc. $2.5 million for allegedly raiding Prudential's
Gainesville, Florida, brokerage office. A New York Stock Exchange
arbitration panel punished PaineWebber after the company hired
almost all of Prudential's Gainesville brokers and sales assistants
in 1993.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators are
expected to release -- possibly as soon as tomorrow -- plans to
auction two digital satellite radio licenses to four companies that
have already applied for the rights, agency officials said.
<p>
   The rules for an auction, which would likely be held before the
summer, are being distributed among the agency's four
commissioners. The licenses would give holders the right to beam
digital-quality radio programming to subscribers. Consumers are
expected to use the service primarily in cars and trucks.
<p>
   Companies that have already applied for the licenses and would
be eligible to bid in any such auction include Washington,
D.C.-based CD Radio Inc., New York-based Primosphere, Washington,
D.C.-based Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corp., and Reston,
Virginia-based American Mobile Radio Corp.
<p>
   Each of these companies, except American Mobile Radio,
originally applied for a special pioneer's license that would have
guaranteed them the rights and let them be the first to market.
Each company withdrew its application after an independent
FCC-appointed panel recommended that the agency not award such a
license to any of the three.
<p>
   Now the agency will propose how the two available licenses
should be auctioned. Still unclear is whether the FCC will preclude
the four likely bidders from colluding -- creating two entities --
to avoid having to bid against each other.
<p>
   CD Radio's chairman and chief executive, David Margolese, has
said he's willing and eager to bid for a license at auction, and
doesn't mind if the rules prevent combination among the group.
<p>
   CD Radio was co-founded in 1991 by Margolese and his partner
Robert Briskman, who devised the technology to deliver nationwide
30 channels of compact-disc quality music and 20 channels of news
and information through mini-satellite dishes on roofs of cars and
trucks.

   Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. said its head of marketing Ove Sorensen is

<p>
   Sorensen, 55, joined the U.S. tobacco arm of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp. from Guinness Plc's United Distillers unit in
October 1995.
<p>
   The company said he won't be replaced.
<p>
   Reynolds had heralded Sorensen as a savvy marketer, who would
strengthen its brands, which included the aging Winston and Salem
cigarettes. Fifteen months later, while Reynolds has introduced 19
new products, Winston and Salem are still losing market share.
<p>
   RJR shares rose 1/8 to 33 7/8 today. The company made the
announcement of Sorensen's departure after the market closed.

<p>
   Boston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments said bond
fund manager Bob Ives resigned because he doesn't want to relocate
to New Hampshire where the No. 1 U.S. fund group is moving its
fixed-income division.
<p>
   Ives, 34, is the first bond fund manager to announce his
resignation as a result of Fidelity's plan to move its entire bond
and money market investment groups to Merrimack, New Hampshire, in
August. Merrimack is 47 miles north of Boston.
<p>
   ``There will be more defections of senior portfolio managers in
the near future,'' said David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity
Research Inc. in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which tracks Fidelity.
<p>
   Fidelity said Ives' decision is nothing more than normal
attrition that's expected with an office relocation. ``As with any
relocation, there are always some individuals who will choose not
to be transferred,'' said Scott Beyerl, a company spokesman.
<p>
   Boston-based Fidelity had 19 portfolio managers in its bond fund
group as of Sept. 30. Since then, at least two managers have
resigned, Ives and Michael Gray.
<p>
   Ives, who managed more than $1.45 billion in fixed-income funds,
including the $955 million Fidelity Government Securities Fund, is
planning to take time off and has not yet decided on what he'll do
next, Fidelity said. Ives will work at Fidelity until the end of
the month, the company said.
<p>
   The announcement of Ives' resignation comes at a bad time for
Fidelity.
<p>
   Fidelity executives, led by J. Gary Burkhead, who's chief of the
firm's fund managers who oversee about $500 billion in assets, are
on a six-city tour that began yesterday in New York.
<p>
   Last night, Burkhead faced numerous questions about manager
defections at Fidelity, as 18 fund managers, including Ives and
Gray, have quit in the past year. Burkhead said Fidelity has the
``depth'' in its money manager ranks weather recent defections by
portfolio managers.
<p>
   Fidelity said today it expects to name new managers for the
funds Ives managed in the next few days.
<p>
   Ives joined Fidelity in 1991 after graduating with a master's
degree in business from the University of Chicago. His most recent
duties included managing the Government Securities Fund, as well as
the Spartan Government Income Fund and the Advisor Government
Investment Fund.
<p>
   The Government Securities Fund returned 2.09 percent last year,
according to the research group Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
which trailed the 2.76 percent return of the Lehman Brothers
Government Bond Index.

   RUSSIA'S PARLIAMENT CHALLENGES YELTSIN
<p>
   MOSCOW (NYT)  &MD;  In a confrontational display of its rage at
President Boris Yeltsin's continued absence from the Kremlin, the
Parliament voted overwhelmingly Wednesday evening to support a
resolution to remove Yeltsin from his post because of his poor
health.
<p>
   The 229-63 vote in the Communist-dominated lower house has no
legal force, and it was instantly swamped in a confusing sea of
parliamentary maneuvers that will require a second vote on the
resolution before it is adopted.
<p>
   But after seven troubling months in which the president has been
far too sick to work, the measure reflects the growing sense that
an economically depressed Russia has a leader who may never again
be fully capable of carrying out the strenuous duties of his job.
<p>
   While opposition figures have often called on Yeltsin to be
removed, this was the first time the issue had been put to a vote.
<p>
   SOUTH KOREA'S LABOR CRISIS CONTINUES
<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea (NYT)  &MD;  Opposition parties said Wednesday
that they remained dissatisfied with President Kim Young Sam's
surprise offer to allow revision of controversial labor laws,
suggesting that the national crisis over the legislation may
continue for some time.
<p>
   Kim wants to hold a special session of the National Assembly
next month to resolve the issue, apparently by allowing changes
that would soften the labor code. But opposition parties and labor
unions are sticking to their original demand that the laws be
repealed entirely before the next step  &MD;  hammering out a revision  &MD; 
can take place.
<p>
   Thus the gap between the two sides has been greatly narrowed,
but it still may be too much to bridge for the time being.
<p>
   HOSTAGE TAKERS FIRED WARNING SHOTS IN PERU
<p>
   LIMA, Peru (NYT)  &MD;  Tensions remained high at the Japanese
ambassador's residence here Wednesday, after Marxist guerrillas
holding 73 hostages inside fired shots into the air shortly after
midnight, presumably to scare off police who were conducting
maneuvers outside the compound.
<p>
   The Tupac Amaru rebels have fired shots from automatic weapons
on at least four occasions in recent weeks, saying they were
warning police not to come to close to the residence.
<p>
   But Wednesday morning's gunfire has raised fears that the police
exercises are a harbinger of a government plan to raid the Japanese
residence or that the maneuvers could provoke the guerrillas to
kill some hostages, either by design or accident.
<p>
   ``Fujimori is employing a textbook strategy to dealing with
long-term hostage takers  &MD;  applying psychological pressure,'' said
a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``This is a
fairly dangerous thing to do in this particular situation because
it increases the prospects for bloodshed.''
<p>
   CANADA'S FOREIGN MINISTER MEETS WITH CASTRO
<p>
   HAVANA (NYT)  &MD;  In a brief visit that clearly signaled the sharp
divisions between the United States and Canada over how to deal
with Cuba, Canada's foreign minister dined with President Fidel
Castro and other Cuban officials on Tuesday before signing joint
declarations Wednesday on human rights and foreign investment.
<p>
   In Washington, meanwhile, the State Department condemned the
visit by the highest-ranking Canadian to set foot in Cuba in more
than 20 years.
<p>
   The Canadian official, Lloyd Axworthy, who has been a vocal
critic of U.S. policy toward Cuba and the Clinton administration's
attempt last year to toughen its longstanding economic embargo by
signing the Helms-Burton Act, called the trip the culmination of a
year-long series of meetings between senior Canadian and Cuban
officials. He said it probably signals even closer relations
between the two countries, as Canada tries to play a greater role
in the hemisphere.
<p>
   BRITAIN ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR ANOTHER ROYAL YACHT
<p>
   LONDON (NYT)  &MD;  When the royal yacht Britannia sailed from
Plymouth on Monday on a final Far East tour before its
decommissioning in August, Britons thought they would never see her
costly like again. But, unexpectedly, the government said Wednesday
that a new $100 million ship will be built to replace it and will
enter service in 2002 in time for the queen's golden jubilee.
<p>
   The announcement appeared to put an end to a lengthy debate in
which detractors argued that the vessel was an anachronism. Still,
the government credits Britannia with having provided British
businessmen with an alluring venue for meeting their counterparts
abroad and thereby having secured more than $3 billion worth of
trade for Britain in the past decade.
<p>
   The expectation had been that if there were to be any new royal
vessel, it would have to be paid for by private contributions. But
Michael Portillo, the defense minister, said Wednesday that the
government believed the yacht should be funded by the nation.
<p>
   OLDEST TITANIC SURVIVOR DIES AT 100
<p>
   LONDON (NYT)  &MD;  Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking
of the Titanic in 1912, died Monday night at a nursing home in
Southampton, England. She was 100.
<p>
   Karen Kamuda, the vice president of the Titanic Historical
Society, said in a telephone interview from Indian Orchard, Mass.,
that Mrs. Haisman's death left seven of the 705 survivors still
living, three in the United States and two each in Britain and
France.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the
sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The
ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old
at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  The 32 dancers of Dance Theater of Harlem went on
strike Wednesday after unanimously voting down a one-year contract
offer at a meeting Tuesday night at the troupe's headquarters.
<p>
   The American Guild of Musical Artists, the dancers' union, is
filing for arbitration over the company's use of two more
apprentices than the most recent contract allowed and over its use
of ``floaters,'' dancers who are neither apprentices nor union
members.
<p>
   Ballet troupes often use apprentices to augment the corps in
works with large casts.
<p>
   Other issues include wages, work rules and payment for extra
work, seniority compensation and the number of apprentices and
length of apprenticeship. The dancers' contract expired Sept. 30
but had been extended through Tuesday. Negotiations began in
October.
<p>
   A spokesman for Dance Theater, whose headquarters are on West
152nd Street, said that its school and other programs were still
operating and were not affected by the strike.
<p>
   The company's next scheduled appearance is Saturday at the State
University College at Purchase, N.Y., where it is to perform with
the Westchester Philharmonic.
<p>
   Dance Theater is to perform again in New York on Feb. 23 at the
Colden Center at Queens College and March 5 at the World Financial
Center.
<p>
   The company is to perform at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington in mid-April and on national and
European tours through mid-July.

<p>
   Hong Kong, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Indonesia's May 29, 1997
Parliamentary elections are looming, and bond investors are looking
at new hedging tools to safeguard yields should the nation's
economic policies shift.
<p>
   Winnie Heung, fund manager at BNP Private Banking Asia, which
manages about $300 million in the region, thinks credit derivatives
may help compensate for any losses that might incur due to the
political and economic risks of investing in Asia's younger bond
markets.
<p>
   Though she isn't buying any, she understands how the $40 billion
market in credit derivatives would work for her if she needs them.
To hedge her Indonesia risk, she could buy from a bank a swap
that's tied to an Indonesian government or corporate bond.
<p>
   In return for making a periodic interest payment to the bank,
she'd be compensated if that bond went into default for any reason.
Default would trigger a payment from the bank to her for an amount
equivalent to her bond's losses.
<p>
   ``We've seen a lot of investors using the product for the first
time to see how it works. We think that there's a lot of potential
for more active portfolio hedging,'' said Koh Siew Eng, vice
president of international capital markets at Chase Manhattan Asia
Ltd.
<p>
   The global market for credit derivatives grew to about $40
billion by the middle of 1996 from about $2 billion in 1991 and
could double in size this year, according to CIBC Wood Gundy, the
New York-based investment banking subsidiary of Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce.
<p>
   For the moment, these derivatives are being sold only for
default protection. Eventually, they will be used as well to
protect against downgrades in the ratings of bonds and the
resulting price drops, said an official of CIBC Wood Gundy.
<p>
   Credit derivatives coming into their own in Asia is a tribute to
the intersection of an understanding of their value as a hedge
against a range of risks and the growth of computer software and
trained personnel needed to create and monitor them.
<p>
   ``The last six months have really steamed in terms of volume,''
said Jonathan Fox, managing director of international capital
markets at Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd.
<p>
   Credit derivatives allow investors to bet on defaults, changes
in credit ratings, adverse changes in yield spreads, or any other
economic event that could befall an underlying security or index.
Effectively they allow indirect bets on political and economic
risks of companies and countries.
<p>
   Derivatives are contracts whose value is tied to the value of
another asset, such as a stock, bond, commodity, currency or index.
They're used to guard against changes in the value of those assets,
or to make leveraged bets on price and yield changes.
<p>
   ``It's an imperfect way to cover your sovereign or political
risk,'' said Fox. ``But it means that you can do a lot better than
you would otherwise be able to do.''
<p>
   Investors use credit derivatives to provide protection against
the risk that a company or country may not be able to repay its
debts or that its credit rating might deteriorate.
<p>
   These transactions can take the form of both swaps and options.
The most common credit derivative used in Asia is the default swap.
<p>
   An investor who takes out a loan at 50 basis points more than
Libor and earns a Libor plus 85 basis point return on a three year
floating rate note can boost his yields by using credit
derivatives.
<p>
   By buying a default swap from a bank at Libor that pays Libor
plus 50, the investor's returns grow from 35 basis points to 50
basis points. By operating in the synthetic market, rather than the
cash market, the investor does not have to fund the investment.
<p>
   These custom-made hedging products can increase yields and lower
funding costs on bonds and loans at just a fraction of the cost of
buying the actual securities.
<p>
   ``You can get a great deal of leverage through these things,''
said Fox.
<p>
   Daniel Fan, investment manager in the international finance,
planning, and development department of Orix Asia Ltd, a subsidiary
of a Japanese leasing company, uses derivatives based on interest
and foreign exchange rates.
<p>
   While Fan would like to use credit derivatives as a hedging
tool, he said it's difficult to convince Orix to use them because
it's difficult to evaluate non-quantitative risks such as political
change.
<p>
   This makes it difficult for investors to price the risks and
what they're willing to pay for the protection of a credit
derivative.
<p>
   Other fund managers, who buy Asian debt because they believe
that the credit quality of most countries and many companies is
improving as the regional economies grow, see no need for
protection against deteriorating credit quality.
<p>
   Still, as Asia-based businesses expand into the region and
around the world, they'll encounter more risks which could boost
their demand for hedging products, including credit derivatives.
<p>
   This is particularly true for South Korea's globally minded
conglomerates, said Pan.
<p>
   ``Mostly the big corporations because they have a very big
business in the world and also they are exposed to different credit
risks and other types of risks,'' said K. R. Pan, head of financial
engineering for the Korea Development Bank, South Korea's sovereign
borrower.
<p>
   ``They are the frontrunners to those different types of
activities,'' he added.

<p>
   Wilmington, Delaware, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Marvel
Entertainment Group Inc.'s $100 million credit agreement with Chase
Manhattan Corp. was rejected by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge
because of two provisions that would trigger a default.
<p>
   The loan provisions said that Ronald Perelman must retain at
least 51 percent control of Marvel, and that no one can file a
court motion challenging the agreement that lets Toy Biz Inc. make
Marvel-copyrighted products for free.
<p>
   Judge Helen S. Balick extended a $20 million interim credit
facility that already exists, and said she wouldn't approve the
final $100 million facility until the two provisions were fixed. An
outside Marvel spokesman, Michael Freitag, said the company expects
to submit modified provisions by Friday.
<p>
   ``We think this levels the playing field, and we appreciate the
court's evenhanded approach,'' said David Friedman, attorney for
Marvel Holdings Inc. bondholders who had objected to the so-called
debtor-in-possession credit facility.
<p>
   Under the revised credit agreement the company said it will
submit to the court, a default would be triggered if someone other
than Perelman acquired 25 percent control. Also, if the court
struck down the free licensing agreement between Marvel and Toy
Biz, a default would be triggered.
<p>
   In their objection to the $100 million credit facility, the
bondholders said the change of control provision was part of a
improper scheme by Perelman to retain control of the company.
<p>
   The bondholders committee is led by investor Carl Icahn, who
holds about 25 percent of the debt. The bondholders, who are
creditors of the parent company of Entertainment, aren't listed as
creditors in the Marvel Entertainment case.
<p>
   Judge Balick said an alternative, allegedly less expensive
facility proposed by the bondholders would lead to litigation that
would delay the Marvel Entertainment Chapter 11 bankruptcy case,
which in turn could seriously damage the company.
<p>
   The bondholders had offered alternative financing through PPM
America Inc., which had committed $100 million for two years on
behalf of Jackson National Life Insurance Co., a U.S. unit of
Prudential Corp. Plc.
<p>
   Under bankruptcy law, Marvel Entertainment and Perelman have the
exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan unless the court
allows others to file a plan.
<p>
   A consortium of bank lenders, led by Chase, hold some $650
million in secured claims against Marvel Entertainment. The
bondholders have $894 million in claims against three Marvel
Holdings entities, secured by about 80 percent of Marvel
Entertainment's 102 million common shares.
<p>
   Marvel Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 protection on Dec. 27,
proposing a reorganization plan that leaves financier Ronald
Perelman in control.
<p>
   Perelman's reorganization plan calls for his Andrews Group to
pay $365 million for 427 million new shares of Marvel Entertainment
stock with cash or stock of Toy Biz, a profitable toymaker Marvel
is acquiring. Under the plan, Toy Biz would be folded into Marvel
Entertainment.
<p>
   The plan would dilute the current 18.84 percent stake in Marvel
held by public shareholders to 3.63 percent and would dilute the
bondholders' collateral to about 15 percent of the outstanding
shares.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts
Inc. said Colony Capital Inc. will purchase $125 million of
cumulative preferred securities as part of Colony's plan to buy 51
percent of its Trump's Castle casino.
<p>
   Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate fund, will
receive $62.5 million of cumulative preferred shares and another
$62.5 million of preferred shares convertible into Trump Hotels
stock after the fourth year of the agreement, according to a Trump
Hotels federal filing. Colony can receive a maximum of 8.5 million
Trump Hotels shares under the agreement.
<p>
   Trump announced preliminary terms of the agreement Monday.
<p>
   Both categories of preferred shares have a compound dividend
rate of 15 percent and are due in eight years, the company said in
the filing. Colony will also receive warrants for 2 million Trump
Hotels with a strike price of $15 a share upon completion of the
transaction, the company said.
<p>
   In addition, Trump Hotels said it will ``cancel'' the $58
million of 13 7/8 pay-in-kind notes tied to the Castle.
<p>
   Trump shares fell 1/4 to 11 1/4.

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of
the Titanic in 1912, died Monday night at a nursing home in
Southampton, England. She was 100.
<p>
   Titanic Historical Society vice president Karen Kamuda said in a
telephone interview Wednesday from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs.
Haisman's death left seven of the 705 survivors still living  &MD; 
three in the United States and two each in Britain and France.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the
sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The
ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old
at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.
<p>
   She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to
the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on
its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of April 14-15,
1912.
<p>
   In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the
National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite
monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in
public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her
father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it
from the wreckage.
<p>
   She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket
of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from
Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his
wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he
intended to open a new hotel.
<p>
   In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and
1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.
<p>
   In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography,
``A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave
a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details
have been called into question.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in
an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his
cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the
listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down
into a lifeboat.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night
and the loss of her father, and that even in her later years she
suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the
drowning victims in the Atlantic.
<p>
   It was 11:40 p.m. when she recalled being jolted in her
three-berth stateroom. ``Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she
recalled. ``He told us: `You'd better put on your life jackets and
something warm; it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've
struck an iceberg  &MD;  it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor
says it's nothing to worry about.'''
<p>
   They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their
haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of
bank notes on top of a bunk. ``We waited for ages on the boat deck
for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing
ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of
them. Everybody kept saying: `She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'
<p>
   ``Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people
got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into
the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we
could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She
watched the mighty liner go down.
<p>
   ``We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time
we had no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father
had got off the ship  &MD;  that's all I could think of.''
<p>
   She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia
and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle
to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and
had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to
South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a
shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.
<p>
   Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa,
Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the
boatyard. They had 10 children.
<p>
   Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman
had ``elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about
what her father was wearing, for example.
<p>
   ``This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said.
``On the contrary, it is only to point out how our memories fail us
as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and
many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from
the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat
pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a
purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.
<p>
   RMS Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits
artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting
the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to
a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ``What better use
for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his
child.''
<p>
   The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to
Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.
<p>
   By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father
in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman was born Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four
sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

   CSX acquired 19.9 percent of Conrail's shares for about $1.96
billion in its first tender offer. CSX said it extended the second
offer to 5 p.m. New York time on Feb. 14. The offer originally
expired at 5 p.m. today.
<p>
   Exercising their rights under Pennsylvania law, Conrail
shareholders last week blocked the acquisition by preventing their
company from accepting two-tiered acquisition bids of the kind CSX
proposes. Conrail and CSX have vowed to call another shareholder
vote on the issue.
<p>
   CSX is committed to buying Conrail at its current offer, CSX
Chairman John Snow said. ``We are confident that Conrail
shareholders will acknowledge that the merger . . . offers them the
most immediate value,'' he said in a statement.
<p>
   Many shareholders, saying CSX's offer is coercive and too low,
favor Norfolk Southern Corp.'s hostile $10.32 billion cash bid for
Conrail.
<p>
   Yet the gap between the bids is narrowing rapidly as the price
of CSX stock rises. CSX shares have risen 18 percent since hitting
a 52-week low of 41 1/4 on Jan. 6, closing today at $49 1/8.
<p>
   If CSX shares rise to $55, the face value both offers will be
worth about $10.3 billion.
<p>
   Earlier today, Norfolk Southern began its promised tender offer
to buy 8.2 million Conrail shares at $115 a piece. That amount --
about 9.9 percent of the outstanding common shares --is the maximum
amount Norfolk Southern can buy without tripping Conrail's ``poison
pill'' defenses.
<p>
   CSX has offered $110 a share in cash for 40 percent of u/Conrail
plus 1.86 shares of CSX common stock and $16 in preferred stock for
the remaining shares.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern's cash offer of $115 a share presumably would
be taxable, while CSX has said the stock portion of its bid is
expected to be a tax-free exchange.
<p>
   Conrail shares rose 3 1/2 to 107 1/2, a 52-week high. Norfolk
Southern rose 1 to 88 1/8.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  The New York Rangers' problem Tuesday night was not
so much with referee Don Van Massenhoven as it was with their
inability to kill penalties.
<p>
   That has been a seasonlong deficiency for the Rangers, and it
was almost costly to this veteran team again. After they could not
survive two key Edmonton power plays early in the third period, the
Rangers had a one-goal lead turn into a one-goal deficit with time
running down.
<p>
   But Mark Messier, whose criticism of Van Massenhoven sparked a
controversy Jan. 2, snapped a wrist shot from the left circle with
1 minute 41 seconds left in regulation to salvage a 4-4 tie with
the Oilers at Madison Square Garden. The goal was set up by the
rookie Vladimir Vorobiev, who had three assists to go along with
his first National Hockey League goal.
<p>
   Three weeks ago at the Garden, Messier had called Van
Massenhoven a ``disgrace'' after the Rangers' captain had led them
back to a 4-3 victory over the New York Islanders. Messier had also
accused the referee of pursuing a ``personal vendetta'' against the
Rangers that night.
<p>
   So it was interesting having Van Massenhoven watch Messier save
his team from defeat on an evening in which Vorobiev starred
alongside Brian Leetch, who had two goals and two assists.
<p>
   And, while the Rangers' penalty killing continues to be a
concern for Coach Colin Campbell (``We were awful tonight, I don't
care how you cut it,'' said Campbell, who blamed the coaching staff
for the disarray), Vorobiev's play was a nice surprise.
<p>
   With Aleksei Kovalev out for the season as he prepares to have
reconstructive surgery on his right knee, Campbell is giving
Vorobiev a long look at right wing on Messier's line. Barring a
trade, Campbell does not have much choice.
<p>
   And for one night, at least, Vorobiev made the most of the
opportunity in his third NHL game, as Messier's line was on the ice
for each of the Rangers' goals.
<p>
   ``If I had told my friends six years ago that I would be playing
on a line with Mark Messier and Adam Graves, I'd be the
laughingstock in town,'' Vorobiev said through an interpreter.
<p>
   The 24-year-old Vorobiev  &MD;  who, like Kovalev, is a product of
the famed Moscow Dynamo club  &MD;  assisted on both of Leetch's
first-period scores. Vorobiev then broke a 2-2 second-period tie at
13:55, finishing a give-and-go with Leetch to give the Rangers
their only lead, which they took into the final period.
<p>
   ``Vorobiev seemed to fit in well with Mark and Adam,'' Campbell
said. ``For now, he looks like a pretty good find.''
<p>
   But the coach cautioned that it was only one game, and a
wide-open one at that. Messier said it was too quick to pass
judgment after three games. Still, Leetch liked what he saw from
the rookie.
<p>
   ``Usually someone coming up is nervous with the puck,'' Leetch,
an All-Star defenseman, said of Vorobiev. ``But he made some great
plays. He looked awfully confident.''
<p>
   Afterward, Messier said he had no problem with Van Massenhoven
this time, and both said that they did not even talk to each other
about the incident.
<p>
   ``He was good,'' Messier said. ``He reffed a good game.''

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Peco Energy Co. asked
Pennsylvania's permission to refinance $3.6 billion in long-term
obligations with a new type of bond.
<p>
   The bonds would be backed by fees the utility will collect from
consumers for transmitting electricity after state power sales are
deregulated in 1999.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Peco says its nuclear plant debt and other
long-term obligations would hinder it in a competitive market, and
Pennsylvania has agreed to let utilities prepare for deregulation
by backing the new, lower-cost bonds.
<p>
   Although U.S. utilities are expected to ask for issuance of $50
billion in these asset-backed securities, Peco's request to state
regulators for a specific amount is the nation's first.
<p>
   ``I don't think it will roll smoothly for that reason. There's
no precedent,'' said Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
<p>
   Peco filed this morning with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities
Commission for $3.6 billion in bonds. If the commission approves,
Peco said it may apply for $3.5 billion more. Whether the state or
Peco would issue the bonds has yet to be determined.
<p>
   What Pennsylvania does with Peco's request could set a model for
similar negotiations across the U.S. California plans to issue $5
billion in bonds this year for its three largest electric
companies. Ohio and New York are considering legislation that would
let their state utility commissions help power companies in the
same way.
<p>
   In deciding how much of Peco's long-term obligations can be
refinanced using the bonds, regulators can reject debt or contracts
that it decides were undertaken because of bad business decisions.
<p>
   Peco has asked to refinance $2.4 billion worth of its nuclear
plant debt. The remaining $1.2 billion would cover some of Peco's
``regulatory assets,'' costs the company has paid and not yet added
to the prices it charges customers. Regulators in Pennsylvania and
other states sometimes ask utilities to defer expenses such as
medical benefits for retirees in order to keep rates low.
<p>
   Peco said it expects the commission to rule in 120 days on its
first bond request. It expects to file a second request in April or
May.
<p>
   California already has decided three companies are entitled to
full recovery of their investments in power sources. These include
nuclear plant debt, as well as power supply contracts that
utilities had to sign with other generators because of federal law.
<p>
   California's Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank will
issue $5 billion of the bonds this year. State law lets the bank
have as much as $10 billion in these bonds outstanding.
<p>
   San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co. each estimate borrowing about $2 billion from
this issue. San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric Co. expects to borrow about
$500 million.
<p>
   In California and Pennsylvania, the new debt will be backed with
the guarantee of money from what consumers will pay for electricity
delivery.
<p>
   In a deregulated power market, consumers will be able to choose
power suppliers other than their tradition utility.
<p>
   However, electricity will still be moved using utilities'
existing power lines and transmission equipment, and consumers will
pay delivery fees to their local utility, regardless of who
supplies their power. The new bonds will be backed by those
delivery fees. California says the new bonds will help it cut
consumers' electric bills 10 percent by next year. Peco said its
customers would see rates drop 2.9 percent if it gets approval to
issue the $3.6 billion in bonds.
<p>
   The state plans to help utilities refinance their debt have
eased some investors' concerns about deregulation, said Gregory
Phelps, portfolio manager for John Hancock Advisers' Patriot Fund,
which holds 100,000 Peco shares.
<p>
   Utilities and investors once feared companies would be left with
billions in debt that would leave them unable to compete with new
suppliers. California and Pennsylvania, among the leading states in
deregulation, have agreed to let utilities refinance much, if not
all, of these obligations.
<p>
   Still, Peco's ability to compete in a competitive power market
isn't assured, Phelps said. Peco's rates are double the U.S.
average. ``There are a lot of disgruntled customers,'' he said.
``It's too early to tell how many will switch'' to a new supplier.
Peco rose 3/8 to 25 7/8 in trading of 1.99 million shares, almost
triple the three-month daily average of 679.716. The Dow Jones
Utilities Average rose 1.33 to 240.85, its highest since Sept. 13,
1993.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve
inadvertently released its regional survey of economic conditions
almost two hours early today, and officials at the central bank are
still trying to sort out what happened.
<p>
   ``We're even now,'' Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne quipped.
``Everybody has broken an embargo, including me.'' Coyne was caught
by surprise when called by a reporter inquiring about the report's
premature release.
<p>
   The Fed released its regional survey, commonly known as the
beige book, through the central bank's Internet site at 12:10 p.m.
Washington time. That was well ahead of the scheduled 2 p.m.
Washington time release.
<p>
   Coyne said the Fed didn't have an explanation for the early
release of its report. He said the central bank's computer
department is separate from the public affairs office, and he's
looking into it.
<p>
   The Fed observes strict embargoes for its economic reports,
since premature release of the central bank's information could
affect financial markets.
<p>
   One possible explanation for today's glitch is the change in the
release time of the report. Today's release marked the first time
the Fed planned on releasing its regional survey at 2 p.m.
Washington time -- two hours after the previous regular release
time of noon. The Fed said it changed the release time to
accommodate financial markets, without specifying further.
<p>
   The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the central
bank's 12 district banks and is published eight times each year. It
will be used to form the basis for discussion on interest rate
targets at the Feb. 4-5 meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee.
<p>
   Since today's survey confirmed other recent economic reports,
its premature release didn't rattle financial markets, analysts
said. ``Considering it didn't offer anything new about what the
Fed's going to do on interest rates, it was a non-event,'' said
Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in New York.
<p>
   In late New York trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
fell 1/2 point lower, pushing up its yield 5 basis points to 6.83
percent. The bond slumped as Wall Street firms struggled to sell
$17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought from the Treasury
today.
<p>
   Today's report from the Fed said the economy continues to grow
with low unemployment nudging labor costs higher. While the Fed
found ``scattered evidence'' of pressures for higher wages in its
latest regional economic survey, the central bank still found no
evidence of accelerating consumer prices outside of energy.
<p>
   The report is in line with comments yesterday by Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who said the U.S. economy remains strong with few
signs of immediate inflationary pressures even as an era of low
wage gains may be ending.
<p>
   ``The economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of
the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past
expansions,'' Greenspan said, in testimony before the Senate Budget
Committee. ``By some important measures of price trends, inflation
actually slowed a bit in 1996.''

   Boston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Fleet Financial Group Inc. said
it will cut 800 jobs from its branches to beef up insurance sales,
investment services and telephone banking operations.
<p>
   Boston-based Fleet, the nation's 11th-largest bank, said
increased demand for non-traditional banking services, particularly
telephone banking, prompted the move.
<p>
   ``We have seen a dramatic increase in customer usage of
telephone banking, in particular, and seen strong increase in
customer demand for products and services beyond the scope of
traditional bank services,'' said Fleet spokesman James Mahoney.
<p>
   Though 800 branch jobs will be lost, less than 800 workers will
be fired, Mahoney said. Some of the bank branch employees will be
offered new jobs in other areas, and some branch positions are
already vacant, he said. Fleet employs about 35,000 workers.
<p>
   Fleet, which operates about 1,200 branches in seven Northeastern
states said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 16 percent to $302
million, as its recent acquisitions and increases in its national
lending business paid off.
<p>
   Fleet shares rose 1 7/8 to 55 in trading of 1.30 million shares,
compared with their three-month daily average of 721,200.

<p>
   Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Trading in
Hasbro Inc.'s options is the target of a formal investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose inquiry may lead them
to company insiders.
<p>
   Dale Carlson, a spokesman for the Pacific Stock Exchange, said a
lawyer representing a person under investigation told the exchange
of the SEC's move to begin a formal action. Hasbro's options trade
on the Pacific exchange, which in May delivered a report to the SEC
detailing what it called suspicious trading in the securities.
<p>
   A formal action means the SEC's board has authorized its
investigators to issue subpoenas or otherwise compel people to
testify about what they know. Typically, SEC investigations are
elevated to formal status after the agency gathers sufficient
evidence during an informal inquiry.
<p>
   Grant Ward, head of enforcement in the Boston office of the SEC,
wouldn't confirm nor deny the existence of a formal action.
<p>
   A spokesman for Hasbro, the maker of Nerf sports toys, Playskool
pre-school toys, and Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers brand board
games, said the company continues to cooperate with the SEC.
<p>
   ``There have been no subpoenas issued at all of Hasbro people,''
said the spokesman, Wayne Charness.
<p>
   The investigation stems from rival Mattel Inc.'s failed bid a
year ago to buy Hasbro, the nation's second-largest toy company.
<p>
   The value of Hasbro's options soared almost 12-fold in the five
days leading up to and following Mattel's public disclosure of its
unsolicited $5.2 billion bid. Investors buy call options when they
expect the underlying stock to rise.
<p>
   The San Francisco-based PSE turned its investigation over to the
SEC in May and asked it to scrutinize trading in 12 accounts. At
the time, the exchange said ``several'' of the 12 people involved
are Rhode Island residents ``who appear to have some connection''
to insiders at Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro.
<p>
   The exchange also said in May that none of the 12 individuals
appear to be connected to El Segundo, California-based Mattel.
<p>
   Stock exchanges typically refer cases to the SEC because they
don't have the power to compel individuals to provide information.
<p>
   Mattel announced its offer for Hasbro to the public after the
close of trading on Jan. 24, 1996. On Jan. 26, Hasbro said the SEC
asked the company for unspecified documents. Mattel also said it
was contacted by the SEC.
<p>
   Hasbro officials have said they knew of Mattel's intent as early
as Jan. 15, when Mattel sent its rival an unsigned letter
concerning the bid. A week later, Mattel sent a signed letter to
Hasbro, which the firm's board of directors discussed at a Jan. 23
meeting.
<p>
   Hasbro rejected Mattel because of antitrust considerations, and
Mattel dropped its bid on Feb. 2.
<p>
   Trading in Hasbro's call options began to perk up just before
the Jan. 24 announcement, after weeks during which no transactions
in the securities were made.
<p>
   Hasbro's $30 options that expired in February 1996 began trading
in earnest on Jan. 19, following a five-week period in which the
securities traded on only five days. In the four days prior to
Mattel's Jan. 24 announcement, 286 February $30 call option
contracts traded; only 140 contracts traded in the prior five
weeks. Each option gives the buyer the right to purchase 100 shares
of the underlying stock. The purchase of 100 Hasbro $30 February
call options on Jan. 19 last year would have cost $8,750, plus
commissions. Six days later, they were worth $103,750.

<p>
   Ottawa, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- JDS Fitel Inc.'s shares rose 12
percent after the company said fiscal second-quarter profit almost
tripled on demand for its fiber-optic transmission equipment.
<p>
   The shares of the Ottawa-based company climbed C$3 to C$27.75 in
Toronto trading of 124,108, compared with the three-month daily
average of 42,475.
<p>
   JDS said yesterday that net income rose to C$5.3 million (US$3.9
million), or 22 cents a share, for the period ended Nov. 30, from
C$1.8 million, or nine cents, in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Revenue jumped 58 percent to C$26.4 million from C$16.7 million.
<p>
   Brian Piccioni, an analyst with Marleau, Lemire Securities Inc.
in Montreal, said JDS Fitel's second-quarter earnings per share
exceeded his forecast of C$0.19.
<p>
   The declining cost of fiber-optic cable, he said, should benefit
JDS Fitel by accelerating the pace of installation.
<p>
   Piccioni rates JDS's stock a ``strong buy'' and has a 12-month
target price of C$31.50.
<p>
   For the six-month period, JDS Fitel's net income rose 83 percent
to C$8.6 million, or 36 cents a share, from C$4.7 million, or 23
cents, in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Revenue increased 46 percent to C$46.7 million from C$32.1
million.

   Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. said its head of marketing Ove Sorensen is
leaving the company after 15 months.
<p>
   Sorensen, 54, joined the U.S. tobacco arm of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp. from Guinness Plc's United Distillers unit in
October 1995.
<p>
   The company said he won't be replaced.
<p>
   Reynolds had heralded Sorensen as a savvy marketer who would
strengthen its brands, which included the aging Winston and Salem
cigarettes. Fifteen months later, while Reynolds has introduced 19
new products, Winston and Salem are still losing market share.
<p>
   RJR shares rose 1/8 to 33 7/8 today. The company made the
announcement of Sorensen's departure after the market closed.

   Ronald Perelman, the financier who is seeking to maintain
control of the Marvel Entertainment Group in bankruptcy, suffered a
setback Wednesday when a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Delaware
rejected parts of a borrowing agreement that Marvel had negotiated.
But a spokesman for Perelman said the ruling ``is really not a
problem for us.''
<p>
   Judge Helen S. Balick said she would not approve $100 million in
financing from banks led by Chase Manhattan unless two provisions
were changed. Those provisions were intended to insure that
Perelman would not lose control of Marvel and to prevent efforts to
block his planned reorganization of the company.
<p>
   Michael Freitag, a spokesman for Perelman, dismissed the ruling
as unimportant because he said the judge had indicated she would
approve alternate language that would amount to the same thing.
<p>
   One of the provisions the judge rejected would have thrown the
financing loan into default if Perelman's stake in the company fell
below 51 percent. But Freitag said a new provision would be added
that would require default if anyone else obtained a 25 percent
stake.
<p>
   Another provision would have brought on default if anyone
challenged Marvel's license giving Toy Biz the exclusive right to
sell toys based on Marvel characters. But Freitag said a new
provision would be inserted providing for default only if such a
challenge were successful. As part of Perelman's reorganization
plan for Marvel, he intends to have it acquire all of Toy Biz.
<p>
   Marvel, the comic book and sports card company, is 80
percent-owned by companies owned by Perelman. But his shares are
pledged as collateral for junk bonds issued by his companies. The
bondholders are trying to persuade the bankruptcy judge to let them
take control of the shares, and, with control, propose an alternate
reorganization plan.
<p>
   It appears that the substitute proposals, if approved, would
still lead to a default if Perelman lost control of the company to
the bondholders.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Aviation
Administration doesn't have in place a reliable cost estimating
process to guide decisions on improving air traffic control,
government auditors say, and hundreds of millions of dollars could
be spent poorly or needlessly.
<p>
   ``Such a situation is unacceptable when making small
investments, but it is especially egregious when making
multimillion- or billion-dollar investments in mission-critical air
traffic control systems,'' Congress's auditing arm, the General
Accounting Office, said in a report today.
<p>
   The absence of reliable estimates of future costs also prevents
Congress from providing adequate funding for system improvements,
the GAO said.
<p>
   The report recommended that the FAA come up with a defined
system for estimating and monitoring costs.
<p>
   Such a system should include a historical database that reflects
cost and schedule estimates and any revisions, a method of
determining what of the current air traffic control software can be
adapted and reused, and a process for dealing with cost and
schedule overruns when they arise, the GAO said.
<p>
   The FAA told auditors that the agency plans to have a cost
accounting system in place by Oct. 1, 1997.
<p>
   The agency began its $34 billion overhaul of the nation's aging
air traffic control in 1982, which is expected to be completed by
the year 2003.
<p>
   Auditors singled out one program -- the Advanced Automation
System -- for particular criticism. The cost of the program, which
involved replacing controllers' work stations at ``en route''
centers that direct traffic between airports with new hardware and
software including radar displays, tripled from $2.5 billion to
$7.6 billion. The program was approximately eight years behind
schedule when the FAA finally scaled back the program in 1994.
<p>
   Loral Corp., acquired by Lockheed Martin Corp. earlier this
year, was the lead contractor on the controversial project.
<p>
   ``Similarly, increases in per-unit costs for five other major
air traffic control projects have ranged from 50 to 511 percent,
and schedule delays have averaged almost four years,'' the GAO said
in the report.
<p>
   Last week, the FAA boasted that a Lockheed Martin-led team
delivered a new air traffic control computer system 10 months ahead
of schedule and $3 million under budget.
<p>
   The agency didn't immediately respond to calls about today's
report.

 &UR; NEW STUDY RAISES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT GULF WAR ILLNESS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN ANTONIO  &MD;  A new study by San Antonio researchers has found
no link between exposure to toxic substances during the Persian
Gulf War and common complaints of muscle pain and weakness among
veterans.
<p>
   The study adds to a growing body of apparently conflicting
findings in recent weeks, as scientists and government officials
seek answers to the mysterious ailments reported by thousands of
Gulf War vets.
<p>
   ``We looked at the most severe patients, and we found very
little in the way of objective pathology to say that there was a
disorder unique to the Persian Gulf,'' said Dr. Anthony Amato,
former director of the neuromuscular service at Wilford Hall
Medical Center, who headed the study.
<p>
   Muscle pain and weakness are among the more common symptoms
reported by veterans since returning from the Gulf War. Other
symptoms are fatigue, joint pain, headache, memory loss, sleep
disorders, skin rashes and digestive problems.
<p>
   The study, which was published in the current issue of the
journal Neurology, looked at 20 patients with severe muscle pain
and weakness. They were drawn from 263 Gulf veterans from all
service branches seen at Wilford Hall between July 1994 and April
1995.
<p>
   Wilford Hall is a major referral center for active duty
personnel with possible Persian Gulf-related illness.
<p>
   The 20 reported ``the most severe neuromuscular symptoms,'' said
Amato, now with the University of Texas Health Science Center. All
complained of severe weakness or muscle pain lasting six months or
longer that significantly limited their daily activities.
<p>
   The 20 patients  &MD;  15 men and five women, between ages 24 and 50
 &MD;  were enlisted personnel who served in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates or the Persian Gulf itself on a Navy ship.
<p>
   They underwent a sophisticated battery of tests, including
muscle biopsies, nerve conduction studies and electromyograms, or
EMGs. EMGs record muscle contractions caused by electrical
stimulation.
<p>
   The evaluations showed no evidence of neuromuscular disease in
most of the patients, Amato said. One patient had a slightly
abnormal EMG. Six of the 20 had mildly elevated levels of creatine
kinase, a natural muscle enzyme. And five also had mild,
non-specific abnormalities on muscle biopsies.
<p>
   The researchers said those findings appear unrelated to their
Gulf War duties.
<p>
   But others remain unconvinced. Dr. Claudia Miller, assistant
professor of family practice at the health science center, and a
member of a VA advisory committee on Gulf War illness, said the
problem with Amato's study  &MD;  and similar studies  &MD;  is that no one
really knows what evidence to look for.
<p>
   ``There's a saying: absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence,''' Miller said. ``What we may be dealing with here is
something that's different, that we don't have a marker for yet.''
<p>
   Miller's research is focused on whether Gulf War vets may be
suffering from a disorder known as multiple chemical sensitivity,
which may have caused ``very subtle changes that are not detectable
easily with current methods.''
<p>
   ``There's a big debate in the (medical) community about whether
it's psychosomatic, or whether there is some kind of chemical
imbalance in these disorders that we're just not sophisticated
enough to pick up,'' Amato said.
<p>
   ``I didn't get into that big debate in the (study). Certainly
stress is something that can cause these symptoms,'' Amato added.
<p>
   Amato said some veterans might be experiencing stress-induced
disorders of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Fibromyalgia
is a disorder characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain, which
may be a complication of post-traumatic stress disorder.
<p>
   Some 700,000 U.S. troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf for
Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.
<p>
   Amato's study comes on the heels of a report to Congress by VA
officials that Gulf War vets who were near an accidental release of
nerve gas in Iraq reported a higher rate of muscle and bone
ailments than those further away.
<p>
   And two weeks ago, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf
War Veterans' Illnesses released its findings. The committee found
no evidence that exposure to chemical weapons caused health
problems for veterans.
<p>
   At the same time, a study by researchers at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas suggested that exposure
to certain combinations of chemicals could cause the symptoms
reported by Gulf War vets.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The founding family of The
New York Times Co. said today that it had brought a new generation
into the group of septuagenarians that oversee the family's stock
trusts and guide the media empire.
<p>
   Lynn Dolnick, 45, was chosen in December from among 13 fourth
generation heirs to serve as a trustee of four trusts that hold the
family's stock.
<p>
   Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission today by
family members showed that a 1986 trust agreement was changed last
month so Dolnick could be added to a group of trustees that
includes the company's chairman and chief executive, the
70-year-old Arthur `Punch' Sulzberger Sr., and his three older
sisters. Dolnick is a niece of Sulzberger.
<p>
   ``Lynn's selection represents continuity in the family and is
part of the normal planning and transition that occurs among
generations,'' said the company's top executive in a statement
today.
<p>
   ``It will have no effect on our shareholders or the business
activities of the company. Rather, it's another sign of our
family's continued commitment to the ownership structure of The New
York Times Co.''
<p>
   The choice adds a trustee who works outside the media business
and who has little involvement with the company's day-do-day
operations, which includes publishing The New York Times and The
Boston Globe, as well as operating TV and radio stations.
<p>
   Dolnick works for the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., where
she is chief of the Exhibition Interpretation division, according
to the SEC filing. New York Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said
that Dolnick holds a doctorate degree in molecular biology from
Brandeis University. The new trustee couldn't be reached for
comment on her appointment.
<p>
   Dolnick's mother, Ruth Holmberg, publishes the family's
Chattanooga Times newspaper in Tennessee. Holmberg, one of
Sulzberger's three sisters, also serves as a trustee.
<p>
   Marian Heiskell and Dr. Judith Sulzberger are also trustees and
the three sisters are all members of the company's board of
directors. The Sulzberger family exercises almost full control over
the company by virtue of its non-trading Class B share holdings and
the voting power that accompanies the stock.
<p>
   While the appointment may be part of preparing for the future,
family trust attorney Theodore Wagner points out that the older
trustees could very well be active for many years to come. Iphigene
Ochs Sulzberger -- the mother of the four older trustees -- was
active in directing the company in her late 90s, he said. After she
died in 1990, each of the four children inherited one-quarter of
her holdings and her trust was divided into four trusts, all with
the same four trustees.
<p>
   Despite the family's statement, Steven Barlow, a media analyst
at Smith Barney, said that as the company is passed down from one
generation to the next, family members' allegiance to the company
tends to diminish.
<p>
   ``Every generation that gets further removed from the founding
family is more likely to cause an event to occur if the price of
the stock doesn't increase at a reasonable rate over a period of
time, and it certainly has not over the past 10 years,'' said
Barlow, noting nonetheless that the stock has performed well in the
last couple years.
<p>
   New York Times Class A shares slipped 1/8 to close today at 40
1/2.

   New Orleans, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Green Bay Packers reserve
wide receiver Derrick Mayes suffered bruised ribs during practice,
leaving the rookie questionable for the Super Bowl.
<p>
   Mayes, a second-round draft pick out of Notre Dame, was hurt
during punt coverage drills when he collided with teammates. The
Packers were practicing without pads.
<p>
   Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren said Mayes would be able to
practice tomorrow. ``I think he's going to be OK, but right now
he's pretty sore,'' Holmgren said.
<p>
   Mayes caught six passes for 46 yards and two touchdowns during
the regular season. He was inactive for both of the Packers'
playoff games.

 &UR; ECONOMIC SCENE: WHITMAN GIVES `AUTO CHOICE' INSURANCE A CHANCE &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &QC;  &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   The proposal from Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey last week
to allow motorists to buy no-frill, no-fault auto insurance that
could pare premiums by as much as one-fourth was a strong
endorsement for a fledgling idea that has been unable to take
flight nationally.
<p>
   The idea is known as auto choice, and the seal of approval from
Whitman, an adroit Republican who undoubtedly has her sights on
bigger things, may finally be the step that helps lift it off the
ground.
<p>
   ``Once people understand auto choice means lower premiums and
better coverage, it's a no-brainer,'' argues Peter Kinzler,
director of the Coalition for Auto Insurance Reform, an ad hoc
group of consumer activists that operates without funds from the
insurance industry.
<p>
   From the perspective of those disturbed by the current, heavily
legalistic system of auto insurance, the Whitman endorsement could
not come at a more opportune time. Next week Kinzler's group, along
with the University of Wisconsin's Auto Compensation Project, is
sponsoring a conference in Washington to highlight the virtues of
auto choice and to publicize the introduction of federal
legislation by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
<p>
   One reason auto insurance is so expensive is that it costs a
fortune to determine liability in court. Plaintiffs' lawyers
typically take one-third to one-half of any compensation. Moreover,
the ability to sue for intangible losses from pain and suffering
adds even greater costs because the potential for payoffs far
exceeding injury victims' medical bills and lost wages encourages
fraudulent claims. In 1995 Louis Freeh, the FBI director, estimated
that fraud added $200 to the average household's insurance cost.
<p>
   No-fault insurance, requiring insurers to cover their own
clients' economic losses regardless of fault and permitting suits
only when injuries are severe, was supposed to contain this
colossal waste. But in two decades of battles, trial lawyers have
maintained the upper hand by keeping it relatively easy to get to
court in most states.
<p>
   Strict no-fault laws barring all suits against offending drivers
whose behavior is short of criminal would do the trick. But this
approach was recently trounced in California, in no small part
because of opposition from Ralph Nader, who sees no-fault as an
unacceptable interference with every American's right to a day in
court. That's where auto choice fits in.
<p>
   The invention of Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the
University of Virginia, and Michael Horowitz, a fellow at the
Hudson Institute in Washington, auto choice is just what it sounds
like.
<p>
   Those who value the right to sue for pain and suffering could
still buy insurance to do that. Those who do not could save money
by limiting their insurance to no-fault protection covering medical
bills and lost wages.
<p>
   When two drivers who chose the no-fault protection were involved
in an accident, each would look to his own insurer for
compensation. When two drivers who bought pain and suffering
insurance collided, responsibility  &MD;  and compensation  &MD;  would be
settled through the legal system.
<p>
   It gets a bit more complicated if a fully covered ``pain and
suffering'' driver collided with a no-fault driver. In that case,
the fully covered driver would not be able to sue the other for
pain and suffering. Rather, he would look to his own insurer for
such compensation. This may sound odd, O'Connell says, but it is
just the way coverage against ``uninsured motorists'' works today.
<p>
   If everyone chose the no-fault route, the savings would be
enormous. A study by the Rand Corporation, updated to 1996, puts
the figure at $40 billion nationwide, or $220 a vehicle.
<p>
   Auto choice, which was quietly endorsed by President George Bush
in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996, may be broadening its political base
with the support of moderate Democrats like Lieberman and Moynihan.
What's more, there are signs that Nader-inspired opposition from
consumer groups is crumbling: Stephen Brobeck, executive director
of the Consumer Federation of America, has signed on.
<p>
   But lawyers, who reap tens of billions of dollars annually from
auto injury suits, have plenty of money to feed the campaign
contribution machine. And at least for the moment, there is no
compelling incentive for legislators to bite the hands that feed
them. That's why the New Jersey initiative  &MD;  where 35 cents of the
total premium dollar now goes into compensation for pain and
suffering and lawyers' fees  &MD;  looms so large.
<p>
   The New Jersey plan offers motorists four choices. At one end is
a policy close to business-as-usual, with ``unfettered access'' to
the courts. At the other is $250,000 in true no-fault protection,
which New Jersey's commissioner of insurance estimates would cut
premiums by 20 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
   In between are hybrids that Whitman apparently figured would
help deflate opponents' argument that access to court was a matter
of principle. One option would allow motorists to buy limited
coverage for pain and suffering from their own insurers, reducing
premiums by about 8 percent by eliminating the chance a jury would
issue a multimillion-dollar reward and leaving less to argue about
in court. The other would establish a new, very tough injury
threshold for access to court.
<p>
   Auto choice remains a political long shot. Insurance companies,
which might be expected to be powerful natural allies, are in fact,
largely indifferent because they see little additional profit,
anticipating that competition would force them to lower their
premiums in proportion to their costs.
<p>
   But when seasoned politicians like Whitman take a shot at
mobilizing the discontent of motorists who have insurance premiums
that can easily exceed $2,000, the assumption that trial lawyers
can buy their way out of trouble may not hold forever.
<p>
   ``Who could say no,'' the governor asks, ``to a bill that simply
gives consumers a choice?''

<p>
   Chicago, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Amoco Corp. said fourth-quarter
earnings rose 55 percent, continuing a pattern among oil companies
of posting bigger profits because of higher oil and natural gas
prices.
<p>
   Amoco said profit from operations rose to $781 million, or $1.56
a share, from $504 million, or $1.02, in 1995.
<p>
   The results beat the average earnings estimate of $1.30 a share
from 22 analysts polled by IBES International Inc. Amoco stock rose
7/8 to 85 7/8.
<p>
   ``Amoco reported the best quarter that we've seen of the big
domestic and international integrated oil companies so far,'' said
Douglas Terreson, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. ``It will
probably be the best in the end.''
<p>
   Revenue rose to $10.08 billion from $8.09 billion in the
year-ago quarter.
<p>
   A $90 million gain from a reduction in inventory resulted in
fourth-quarter net income of $871 million, or $1.74 a share. A
charge of $380 million relating to the impairment of certain assets
and a gain of $83 million from the sale of the Amoco Motor Club
brought net income in the year-ago quarter to $207 million, or 42
cents.
<p>
   Full-year 1996 profit from operations rose 20 percent to $2.59
billion, or $5.20 a share, from $2.16 billion, or $4.36, in 1995.
Revenue was $36.08 billion, up from $31 billion.

 &UR; NBC LEARNS THE ABCS OF NEWS &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By JOHN CARMAN &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997, San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The television audience is notoriously reluctant to shift its
news loyalty, but just such a glacial swing in viewer preference
may have begun.
<p>
   For four weeks in a row, and six of the past seven, Tom Brokaw
and the ``NBC Nightly News'' have edged out Peter Jennings and
``ABC World News Tonight'' in the Nielsen ratings.
<p>
   ``World News Tonight,'' the ratings leader for eight straight
years, is now in a dead heat with ``Nightly News'' in the
season-to-date ratings.
<p>
   NBC's uptick comes on the heels of a radical alteration in the
format and philosophy of its evening newscast.
<p>
   What's more, a shift in ratings could help spell the end of the
longest period of news anchor stability in TV history. For 14
years, the only change in the network anchor firmament has been
CBS' ill-fated pairing of Dan Rather and Connie Chung as ``Evening
News'' co-anchors.
<p>
   The reasons for NBC's surge are difficult to gauge.
<p>
   ``Pinpointing this,'' says NBC News Vice President Bill
Wheatley, ``is not an exact science.''
<p>
   One possibility is that NBC News sowed the seeds of its current
success with its extensive coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial in
1995. Other parts of the foundation may be the Olympics coverage
last summer on NBC, the additional exposure for NBC News and Brokaw
on the new MSNBC cable channel, and the auxiliary influence of
NBC's winning prime-time programming.
<p>
   Another possibility is the improved performance of NBC- owned
and -affiliated stations, many of which produce local newscasts
leading into the network newscasts. A strong lead-in can be the
best tonic for any TV program.
<p>
   And there is the ``Nightly News'' itself, where changes have
created critics as well as converts.
<p>
   Late last year, NBC cut Brokaw free of the traditional anchor
desk. Since then, he's been standing in front of a large, kinetic
``video wall'' to deliver the nightly newscasts.
<p>
   Andrew Tyndall, who tracks network news trends through a widely
distributed weekly flyer called the Tyndall Report, says removing
Brokaw from the anchor desk and newsroom backdrop has given the
``Nightly News'' an ``MTV or ESPN2'' look, putting Brokaw ``in
virtual space rather than real space.''
<p>
   But the change is far deeper than cosmetic. Tyndall says NBC has
also reduced its story count to as few as five stories a night,
consequently cutting appearances by NBC field correspondents. It
has added regular features such as ``In Their Own Words,'' in which
newsmakers express themselves without the customary journalistic
interpretation.
<p>
   ```In Their Own Words' leaves a viewer thinking he has seen
something not filtered by one of those Armani-suit-wearing, snide
network news reporters,'' a correspondent from another network
said, with a trace of sarcasm, after watching the ``Nightly News.''
<p>
   Also, says Tyndall, NBC has implemented ``a dramatic cutback in
overseas coverage,'' offering only a third as much foreign news as
it did at the start of the decade. Domestic coverage has risen
sharply to fill the void, but not domestic coverage from
Washington, D.C. The old reliance on ``inside the Beltway'' news
from the capital has been curtailed.
<p>
   A look at time allotted to news stories in 1996 demonstrates
Tyndall's point about the shift in emphasis. ABC and CBS each
devoted more than twice as much air time as NBC to the former
Yugoslavia and the introduction of U.S. forces in Bosnia. NBC was
also well behind in its coverage of another important international
story, Israeli-Palestinian relations.
<p>
   Domestically, NBC devoted less time than its competitors to the
national political conventions, the presidential campaign and the
Whitewater investigation.
<p>
   NBC led ABC and CBS in evening news time allotted to the O.J.
Simpson wrongful-death lawsuit, the ValuJet crash in the
Everglades, the bull market on Wall Street and, by far the widest
margin, the Olympic Games in Atlanta.
<p>
   NBC is dialing up the heat not only in its story choices,
Tyndall alleges, but also in its handling of stories.
<p>
   ``It's borderline tabloid,'' he says. ``They get very prickly
when you say `tabloid.' Call them `populist,' and they don't mind
that.''
<p>
   In fact, NBC's Wheatley did reject the ``tabloid'' sobriquet in
a telephone interview this week, and accepted the term
``populist.''
<p>
   NBC is reporting fewer ``process'' stories about the
wheel-turning of the federal government in Washington, he said. And
less foreign news, especially ``second-level'' stories from abroad.
<p>
   ``I think that's true of American journalism in general,''
Wheatley said of the foreign cutbacks. ``But if there's major
foreign news, especially affecting our viewership, we're there.''
<p>
   ``Nightly News'' didn't have a single foreign story in last
Friday's newscast, except for a brief mention of American
balloonist Steve Fossett's troubled attempt to fly over Libya.

<p>
   The day's lead story, as at many newspapers, was the murder of
Bill Cosby's son. (ABC led with the reprimand and fine imposed on
House Speaker Newt Gingrich.) Brokaw said the murder was ``an
unsolved mystery.'' NBC correspondent George Lewis claimed that the
crime had brought ``emotional turmoil'' to Southern California.
<p>
   Later in the broadcast, NBC aired a ``News in Depth'' feature
about other parents who've coped with the loss of a child. Brokaw
introduced a story about a New Hampshire airplane crash by saying
that ``a small plane ride turned to tragedy today ...'' Still
later, a U.S. flag rippled in the background as Brokaw introduced
an ``American Dream'' segment about the new governors of New
Hampshire and Washington.
<p>
   It can't be said with certainty that cutting back on foreign
news will please viewers; after all, Jennings and ``World News
Tonight'' displayed a special fondness for foreign stories and have
led the pack through the 1990s.
<p>
   But NBC has sprung to life with a sharp departure from the
``headline digest'' style of the 1960s and 1970s. It's also
radically different from the thick analysis on PBS' ``NewsHour,''
where Washington news and foreign developments remain paramount.
<p>
   Some observers see at least a smidgeon of NBC influence in ABC's
switch of its ``American Agenda'' news segment to ``Solutions''
features about ways to solve social problems, and in the addition
of new segments in the ``CBS Evening News.''
<p>
   The battle is for prestige and dollars, but it's waged against
the backdrop of a dwindling audience. In the past decade, the three
network evening newscasts collectively have experienced a 30
percent decrease in ratings.
<p>
   In many cities, the newscasts are on too early for commuting
workers to see them. One network correspondent, who asked not to be
identified, jokes that he's recognized in public only by people
who've seen his stories repeated later on the local news.
<p>
   Also, the evening newscasts tend to be unpopular with younger
viewers, who are increasingly likely to get their news from such
alternate sources as the Internet, radio talk shows and even
late-night entertainment programs on TV.
<p>
   Brokaw, at 56, is enjoying a resurgence among the remaining
viewers for the evening newscasts. He's anchored ``Nightly News''
since 1983. Jennings, now 58, became the solo anchor of ``World
News Tonight'' the same year.
<p>
   The eldest anchor is Rather, who took over for Walter Cronkite
in 1981. Rather is 65, older than Cronkite was when he stepped
down. CBS, which once led the field in ratings, bench strength and
journalistic impact, trails ABC and NBC by more than a full ratings
point.
<p>
   ``CBS Evening News'' is a victim largely of affiliate switches
that have left CBS in partnership with relatively weak UHF
affiliates in some major markets.
<p>
   But as the ``NBC Nightly News'' contests for first place,
proving that viewer preferences are malleable, talk about replacing
Rather at CBS is inevitable.
<p>
   Recent scuttlebutt has centered on Bryant Gumbel, who has left
NBC's ``Today'' program, and Diane Sawyer, whose ABC contract
expires this spring.
<p>
   Within the network news divisions, though, some say the flagship
anchor jobs have lost their allure. Much of the action and many of
the viewers have switched to the prime-time newsmagazines.
<p>
   ``To imagine Ed Bradley moving from `60 Minutes' to anchor the
`CBS Evening News,' that's not a promotion anymore,'' said one
veteran network correspondent.

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- CoreStates Financial
Corp.'s fourth-quarter net income rose 1.8 percent as cost savings
and strong gains internationally failed to offset slow loan growth.
<p>
   The Philadelphia-based bank said net income rose to $195.5
million, or 91 cents a share, from $192.1 million or 87 cents a
share. The earnings were three cents short of Wall Street's
expectations of 94 cents a share, according to a survey of 19
analysts by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   The fourth-quarter figures include costs tied to CoreStates'
merger with Meridian Bancorp last year. Without those costs and
other items, earnings rose 2.8 percent to $201.6 million, or 93
cents a share, from $196.1 million, or 89 cents.
<p>
   The company said strong growth in international fees didn't
offset declines elsewhere due to the competitive market for most
types of commercial lending.
<p>
   Analysts said that slow loan growth and the costs of the
Meridian merger hampered growth in the quarter. However, they said
merger costs were largely taken care of, leading to better earnings
in the future.
<p>
   ``The quarter was a little light, but in the future they are
poised for renewed balanced sheet growth,'' said David Berry, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, Inc.
<p>
   Investors sent CoreStates shares up 1 1/8 to 52 5/8.
<p>
   Net interest income in the fourth quarter fell 2.0 percent to
$543.1 million, as net interest margin declined to 5.51 percent
from 5.56 percent. Non-interest income dipped 0.4 percent to $224.4
million.
<p>
   The bank set aside a little more money for bad loans in the
quarter to $40.0 million from $38.2 million provision, while net
charge-offs, or loan writeoffs, fell to $37.9 million from $54.5
million.
<p>
   For the full year, net income fell 0.9 percent to $649.1
million, or $2.97 a share, from $655.2 million or $2.95, a year
earlier.

<p>
   Perth, Australia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Camelot Resources NL,
an Australian gold mining company, and Canada's Teck Corp., said
they will make a joint A$158 million (US$123 million) takeover bid
for Mount Edon Gold Mines (Australia) Ltd.
<p>
   The bid will be made through Reachwest Pty. Ltd. Reachwest
already holds about 14.2 percent of Mount Edon.
<p>
   The price represents a 48 percent premium to the closing price
of Mount Edon yesterday.
<p>
   ``We like the asset and the exploration potential,'' said Steven
Dean, managing director of Camelot. ``Their regional exploration
position is what interests us.''
<p>
   Analysts say the bid illustrates the attraction of gold assets
in Australia and Papua New Guinea for Canadian companies. It
follows bids by Placer Dome Inc. for Highlands Gold Ltd. and the 25
percent of Placer Pacific Ltd. it doesn't already own, which were
announced last month.
<p>
   ``They are quite willing to come in and pay a 48 percent premium
for gold stocks here,'' said David Kauler, an analyst at ANZ
Securities Ltd. in Melbourne. ``They are far more willing to pay
for gold in the ground than for immediate earnings.''
<p>
   Martin Hickling, who helps manage A$5.7 billion at Colonial
Mutual Investment Management, said there could be more takeovers,
particularly in the smaller Australian gold stocks. ``It's a theme
that you could see continuing,'' he said.
<p>
   Camelot's Dean said Mount Edon has a strong presence in the
Leonora greenstone belt, a group of rocks which is known to contain
gold deposits near Leonora, about 600 kilometers northeast of
Perth.
<p>
   The bid is subject to a number of conditions including
government approval, a minimum acceptance of 90 percent, the cash
price for gold not declining below US$335 an ounce and the
Australian Stock Exchange Gold Index remaining above 1500 points.
The gold price was last quoted at US$351.60 an ounce and the gold
index was at 1732.30 points.
<p>
   ``It's an unsolicited and opportunistic bid,'' said Tony
Brennan, Mount Edon's managing director. ``For the time being,
shareholders should do nothing.''
<p>
   Brennan said Mount Edon's directors were meeting to appoint
advisers later this week.
<p>
   Mount Edon operates the Tarmoola gold mine in Western Australia
state. The mine produced 58,369 ounces of gold in the 12 months to
June 30, 1996.
<p>
   Tarmoola experienced mining problems last year which resulted in
lower gold production. Mount Edon's share price declined from
A$3.49 last February to a low of A$1.35 on Jan.16.
<p>
   Mount Edon's quarterly report for the three months to Dec. 31,
which was released on Jan 17, showed that the production problems
are progressively being overcome. Gold production for the quarter
totaled 38,568 ounces and brought gold output for the six months to
Dec. 31 to 74,416 ounces, 83 percent higher than the previous
corresponding period.
<p>
   ``The results of the December quarter showed a substantial
turnaround,'' Brennan said. ``The December quarter now really
cements the turnaround at the operations.''
<p>
   Teck has given Reachwest a commitment to provide funding to meet
the requirements of the bid for a period of nine months.
<p>
   Within about three months after the close of the bid, Teck and
Camelot are required to make minimum cash contributions to
Reachwest. Camelot must contribute A$40 million to earn a minimum
30 percent interest in Reachwest. Teck must contribute A$93.3
million to earn 70 percent.
<p>
   These funds will be used to repay a substantial part of the
borrowings incurred by Reachwest to finance the bid.
<p>
   Camelot has the right to increase its interest in Reachwest to
50 percent by making further cash payments to Reachwest within six
months of the close of the bid. The cost will be A$1.333 million
for every percentage point interest between 30 percent and 50
percent.
<p>
   Camelot's Dean said Camelot will raise the funds needed to
acquire the minimum 30 percent interest in Reachwest in two
tranches.
<p>
   The first will be through the sale of new Camelot share to Teck
and other investors, at or close to the market price, to raise
about A$7.5 million. Teck will buy sufficient shares to increase
its interest in Camelot to 19.99 percent.
<p>
   A second share sale will raise A$32.5 million and will be made
to existing shareholders, after the successful completion of the
Mount Edon bid. Rights to buy the new shares will be renounceable.
<p>
   Camelot operates the Mount Gibson gold mine in Western Australia
and has an effective 50 percent interest in the Burnside gold mine
through its subsidiary Northern Gold NL.
<p>
   In the year to June 30, Mt Gibson produced 60,248 ounces of
gold. The Burnside project is currently under study. Northern gold
is planning a mine to produce 80,000 ounces of gold a year from the
treatment of 1.5 million metric tons of ore a year.
<p>
   Teck Corp is a major Canadian mining company with a market
capitalization of about C$3.01 billion (US$2.25 billion). It
produces a range of metals and coal from eleven mines in Canada and
one in Chile. It holds cash and money market investments valued at
about C$380 million.
<p>
   Its class A shares rose C$1.75 to C$32 in Toronto.

 &UR; SEC FINES CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT ADVISER $150,000 FOR FALSE ADS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Neil Roland &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A California investment
adviser and the firm he owns were ordered to pay a total of
$150,000 in fines for advertisements that inflated their 1985-1991
results, the Securities and Exchange Commission said today.
<p>
   Norman L. Yu and his Newport Beach, California-based firm,
Norman L. Yu &AMP; Co., agreed to pay the unusually large fine without
admitting or denying the allegations.
<p>
   The SEC accused Yu of distributing advertisements claiming his
accounts gained as much as 23.9 percent in 1990 when in fact they
lost 6.6 percent. These ads claimed his accounts rose 55.9 percent
in 1989 when the actual increase was 38.1 percent, the SEC said.
<p>
   ``In advertising, investment advisers need to be sure they state
their performance accurately and completely,'' said Kelly Bowers,
assistant SEC enforcement director in Los Angeles. Bowers described
the fine as ``a very substantial penalty for investment advisers.''
<p>
   In addition to the fines, Yu and his firm were censured and
prohibited from advertising results for five years until figures
have been audited by an independent certified accountant. The
firm's advertisements also have to be reviewed by someone
acceptable to the SEC.
<p>
   Neither Yu, 65, nor his attorney responded today to requests for
comment about the ads, which ran from 1991 to 1993. His 15-employee
firm had 683 client accounts and $210 million under management in
the early 1990s, according to the SEC.
<p>
   The SEC also alleged Yu failed to keep records that would show
how the firm calculated its performance and prepared no written
policies to prevent the misuse of investment data.
<p>
   ``Yu oversaw all operations,'' the SEC contended. ``Yu
maintained (the firm's) performance materials in his office and
determined which documents should be maintained and preserved, and
which ones should be discarded.''
<p>
   The New York Times reported in 1993 that Yu's advertised returns
vaulted him onto a service that tracks the performance of money
managers. Norm Zadeh, who runs Money Manager Verified Ratings,
published a 1991 report saying that Yu had ``one of the best
records in the world for investing from the long side,'' the
newspaper reported.
<p>
   Zadeh said today that Yu ``deceived'' him, and that he ``blew
the whistle'' to the news media on Yu's activities.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Riggs National Corp. surged
as much as 7.8 percent to a record high as investors bet the
Washington-based bank could be a takeover target.
<p>
   Riggs, which has been the subject of takeover speculation since
July, rose as much as 1 3/8 to 18 7/8 before closing at 18 3/8 a
day after First Maryland Bancorp acquired Pennsylvania-based
Dauphin Deposit Corp.
<p>
   Allied Irish Bank, which has expanded its First Maryland network
throughout Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, said it was eager
to expand in the U.S. -- particularly in the Washington area. For
many investors, that meant Riggs was next, analysts said.
<p>
   ``A lot of people are saying Riggs would be a good match,'' said
Hal Schroeder, a bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
<p>
   Riggs, with about $5 billion in assets and 57 branches in the
Washington area, fueled takeover talk when it announced it was
putting its RIMCO investment management, trust services and private
banking units into a new division, Riggs &AMP; Co.
<p>
   Investors interpreted the move as a prelude to the bank selling
its branches.
<p>
   A bank spokesman denied any such intentions. ``We think these
changes will add a significant new marketing opportunity for the
benefit of the entire bank,'' the spokesman said.
<p>
   The U.S. banking industry is going through an unprecedented wave
of consolidation, as investors push companies to increase profits,
or else sell to someone who can deliver those profits. Banks make
acquisition to reduce costs and reach more customers.
<p>
   There is a dwindling number of banks of significant size in the
affluent towns of south Maryland and northern Virginia. Another
possible target in the region is Provident Bankshares Corp., a
Baltimore-based bank with about $2.5 billion in assets, Schroeder
said.

mistreatment of Russian sailors in Washington state ports by INS

detaining crews on board for weeks under inhumane conditions,
raiding ships without warning and verbal harrassment. The State

may be the best solution to the ethics battles that embroiled House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and McDermott as one of Gingrich's chief
investigators.``We can have a choice. This place is terribly
dysfunctional. I don't want to make it worse. ... And the tenor
around here is one of being tired of war,'' he said in his first
detailed interview after leaving the Ethics Committee amid a storm
of controversy. McDermott, D-Wash., talked about Congress's flawed
ethics process, ways of fixing it and his own past efforts to leave
the Ethics Committee. But he would not utter a word about the

Gingrich phone conversation that was turned over to him and leaked

In the study, technology-based companies are those with at least 10

They companies employ nearly 231,000 people directly; each of those
jobs generates 2.37 more in trade, services and other fields, to

<p>
   Pontiac, Michigan, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Detroit Lions
named former San Francisco 49ers assistant Marc Trestman the team's
new quarterbacks coach.
<p>
   Trestman, 41, directed one of the NFL's most potent attacks over
the past two years as 49ers offensive coordinator. Last season, San
Francisco's Steve Young was the NFL's top-rated quarterback and
Jerry Rice led the league in receptions.
<p>
   In Detroit, he will work with Scott Mitchell, who is expected to
sign a new contract with the Lions shortly. Mitchell was
inconsistent in 1996, throwing 17 touchdowns and 17 interceptions
for 2,917 yards. He enjoyed the finest season of his career in
1995, throwing for 4,338 yards with 32 touchdowns and 12
interceptions.
<p>
   Trestman is leaving San Francisco after the team replaced head
coach George Seifert, who resigned, with Steve Mariucci. In
Detroit, he joins the staff of head coach Bobby Ross, the
replacement for Wayne Fontes, who was fired.
<p>
   A nine-year NFL coaching veteran, Trestman began his career with
the Minnesota Vikings in 1985. He move to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
as quarterbacks coach in 1987 and went to Cleveland in the same
capacity the next season. He then returned to Minnesota in 1990 for
two seasons.
<p>
   Trestman left coaching from 1992-94 to pursue a career in the
investment banking business before returning to the NFL with the
49ers in 1995.
<p>
   He began his coaching career as a volunteer assistant at the
University of Miami in 1982 while attending law school. While at
Miami he worked with quarterbacks Bernie Kosar and Vinnie
Testaverde.

<p>
   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- BankAmerica Corp. options
surged as investors bet the San Francisco bank's stock will rally.
<p>
   ``This is simply somebody looking for an efficient way to invest
in BankAmerica,'' said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at
Cowen &AMP; Co. in New York.
<p>
   Options giving investors the right, but not the obligation, to
buy BankAmerica shares at 95 in April rose 3 1/2 to 16 1/2 in
trading of 1,510 contracts. That's seven times the daily average.
<p>
   The option, known as a call, rises in value as BankAmerica
shares rise in value. BankAmerica stock rose 2 to 110 in trading of
1.43 million shares.
<p>
   Analysts say BankAmerica's shares will probably rise further as
it buys back its stock, hoping to boost per-share earnings by
reducing the number of shares outstanding.
<p>
   In the fourth quarter, BankAmerica spent roughly $448 million to
buy 4.7 million shares. For the year, the bank bought back 17
million shares, at a cost of roughly $1.3 billion. Last year
BankAmerica shares rose 54 percent.
<p>
   By investing in an option instead of stock, buyers are able to
reduce their initial investment to 16 1/2 a share and still gain if
the stock rises.
<p>
   The disadvantage for option investors is that if they don't use
their option to buy the stock before the third week in April, their
entire investment will be lost. Last week, the bank said
fourth-quarter earnings rose 6 percent, as higher fees from
checking accounts and other services offset sluggish growth in
lending income.

<p>
   Gary, Indiana, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Express Corp.
faces a possible boycott in Gary, Indiana, following the
package-delivery company's decision to reduce service hours in the
city because of courier safety fears.
<p>
   Company representatives met with Gary Mayor Scott King today to
discuss the threatened boycott, a Federal Express spokeswoman said.
<p>
   Federal Express last week moved its pickup deadline in Gary to 4
p.m. from 6 p.m. after company drivers complained their safety was
jeopardized on some routes in the northwest Indiana city,
spokeswoman Shirlee Clark said.
<p>
   ``There were some incidents that our couriers reported to
management,'' said Clark, who declined to give examples of the
complaints or the number of drivers involved. ``The safety of our
employees is of paramount importance to us.''
<p>
   She said regular hours were restored on some routes yesterday.
<p>
   Some area businesses have complained that the scheduling changes
would hamper business and cast the city in a negative light, a Gary
spokeswoman said.
<p>
   Mayor King's office didn't return calls seeking comment.
<p>
   ``We had said all along that we welcomed dialog with the mayor's
office,'' Clark said.
<p>
   She said Memphis, Tennessee-based Federal Express routinely
makes schedule adjustments due to weather or other factors.

   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
shrank 20.6 percent in December from the same month a year ago to
881.475 billion yen ($7.4 billion), the Finance Ministry said.
<p>
   That's the 24th decline in 25 months.
<p>
   The surplus was smaller than expected. Economists said the
surplus would be 1.055 trillion yen, according to a survey compiled
by Bloomberg Business News. Projections ranged from 970 billion yen
to 1.145 trillion yen.
<p>
   The trade surplus grew 0.2 percent in November compared to a
year earlier. That figure was later revised to a 0.4 percent
decline.
<p>
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States in December rose
7.8 percent to 389.113 billion yen, the ministry said.
<p>
   Global imports to Japan rose 13.4 percent to 3.286 trillion yen,
while exports increased 4.0 percent to 4.168 trillion yen, the
ministry said.
<p>
   For all of 1996, Japan's trade surplus fell 32.4 percent to 6.7
trillion yen. The country's full-year trade surplus with the U.S.
fell 16.5 percent to 3.6 trillion yen.

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Conrail Inc. said it posted
a fourth-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, on rising
traffic and reduced spending.
<p>
   The railroad, which is the subject of a takeover fight, reported
net income of $147 million, or $1.86 a share, compared with a loss
of $30 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
<p>
   Revenue fell to $943 million from $951 million.
<p>
   The earnings beat the average estimate of $1.80 a share of 11
analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Conrail announced the results after the close of trading. Shares
of Conrail rose 3 1/2 to 107 1/2, a 52-week high.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Conrail has agreed to be acquired by CSX
Corp. for $9.72 billion in cash and stock. Norfolk Southern Corp.
has made a rival bid of $10.32 billion in cash.
<p>
   ``Despite the potential for distractions resulting from our
proposed merger with CSX, our people clearly focused on controlling
costs, improving safety and maintaining high levels of service to
our customers,'' David LeVan, Conrail's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
<p>
   Earlier today, CSX said it was extending its tender offer for
20.1 percent of Conrail's shares to 5 p.m. on Feb. 14. It was
originally scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today. CSX already owns
19.9 percent of Conrail.
<p>
   Also today, Norfolk Southern began its promised tender offer to
buy 8.2 million Conrail shares at $115 each. That's the maximum
number of shares Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering
Conrail's ``poison pill'' defense against hostile takeovers.
<p>
   For the quarter, Conrail said its traffic rose 4.7 percent.
LeVan said costs decreased in every major category except fuel.
Compensation and benefits payments fell 8.2 percent; materials and
supplies costs fell 6.1 percent; and insurance costs fell 21.2
percent.
<p>
   For 1996, Conrail's net income rose to $342 million, or $4.25 a
share, from $264 million, or $3.19, in 1995.
<p>
   Revenue rose to $3.7 billion from $3.68 billion.

<p>
   Compaq Computer Corp. reported earnings Wednesday for the fourth
quarter and all of last year that exceeded Wall Street analysts'
estimates, and the company's stock rose sharply.
<p>
   Compaq, the world's largest personal computer company,
attributed the gains in its earnings to greater sales of the more
profitable parts of the company's product line and to internal
changes that have lowered its costs and increased its profit
margins.
<p>
   Compaq shares rose $4.875 Wednesday, to $83.375, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The company's strength in a quarter when many PC
retailers and makers complained of poor consumer sales reflects
strong brand awareness and customer support, analysts said. The
broadening of Compaq's product line, which now includes larger
servers and work stations, also helped to lift the company's
fortunes above those of companies that make only PCs.
<p>
   ``The haves  &MD;  Compaq, IBM, Dell and Hewlett-Packard  &MD;  are
gaining market share at the expense of the have-nots,'' said
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with CS First Boston.
<p>
   ``Customers in the corporate space are paying much more
attention to quality, brand and support, and are willing pay more
for that,'' he said. ``There's this fundamental shift occurring,
and the companies on the right side of it are reporting superb
results.''
<p>
   For the quarter, Compaq reported earnings of $462 million, or
$1.64 per share, more than five times the $82 million, or 30 cents
a share, reported in the comparable period a year earlier. The
earnings in the fourth quarter of 1995 reflect a one-time charge of
$241 million, or 87 cents a share, related to acquisitions. Sales
grew 15 percent, to $5.42 billion, from the $4.70 billion reported
in the fourth quarter of 1995.
<p>
   Earnings in the fourth quarter of 1996 beat the average estimate
of 34 analysts surveyed by First Call, for earnings of $1.53 a
share.
<p>
   For the year, earnings totaled $1.3 billion on sales of $18.1
billion, up from earnings of $789 million on sales of $14.8
billion.
<p>
   Earl L. Mason, Compaq's senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview that the company
had not experienced the holiday disappointment reported by some
competitors. ``Our Christmas season was very good,'' he said. ``Our
business increased substantially on the consumer side. Most
importantly, we didn't have a lot of inventory when the Christmas
season ended.''
<p>
   But 85 percent of Compaq's sales are still to the corporate
market, and it was this segment that drove growth in the quarter.
Compaq now sees itself as not just a PC maker but as a computer
systems company, like IBM or Hewlett-Packard, able to fill
corporate needs across a broad spectrum of products, Mason said.
<p>
   The introduction of the company's first work stations, aimed
directly at machines from Sun Microsystems Inc., was particularly
strong, he said.
<p>
   Compaq has also instituted a broad effort to reduce costs and
increase return on capital, which bore fruit in the quarter. The
gross profit margin rose to 24.4 percent from 21.1 percent in the
first quarter of 1996. Mason said he was confident Compaq could
sustain such margins, which the PC industry has not seen in at
least two years.
<p>
   The internal changes also included inventory reduction, Mason
said. ``Taken together,'' he said, ``these operational improvements
lifted our cash balance 436 percent from $745 million in the
previous year to $4 billion.''
<p>
   Wolf of First Boston credits the soft-spoken Mason, who joined
Compaq from Inland Steel Industries just six months ago, as the
architect of these changes.
<p>
   ``The man really understands how to run a business from a
financial perspective,'' he said. ``The return on capital has just
begun to explode. Compaq stock's going to go through $100 like a
knife through warm butter.''

   London, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- British bookmaker Ladbrokes has
made the Green Bay Packers a 1 to 8 favorite to beat the New
England Patriots in the Super Bowl.
<p>
   Ladbrokes is offering 9 to 2 odds on the Patriots winning
Sunday's game at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.
<p>
   With those odds, people who place winning bets on the Packers
would have to wager $8 to win $1. People who place winning bets on
the Patriots would win $9 for every $2 bet.
<p>
   These odds are final, barring any last-minute injuries, said
Ladbrokes's deputy chief oddsmaker Edward Nicholson.
<p>
   The over-under for the game is 49 1/2, with Ladbrokes setting
odds of 10 to 11 that the total number of points scored by both
teams will either exceed or fall short of 49 1/2.
<p>
   About 100 side bets are being offered on the game, including who
will score the first touchdown. Green Bay running back Dorsey
Levens is getting odds of 5 to 1 of scoring first, while Packers'
quarterback Brett Favre is 33 to 1 and New England wide receiver
Troy Brown is 66 to 1.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The chairmen of CSX Corp. and
Norfolk Southern Corp. agreed to meet in an attempt to reach a
compromise in their contest to acquire Conrail Inc. and dominate
the railroad business in the East.
<p>
   CSX Chairman John Snow and Norfolk Southern chairman David Goode
agreed to meet after a newspaper story quoted the head of the
federal Surface Transportation Board warning that if the railroads
can't reach a compromise, her agency might divide Conrail's routes
between the two other carriers. Conrail Chairman David LeVan is
also expected to attend the meeting.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern has intruded itself into what was intended to
be a friendly takeover of Philadelphia-based Conrail by CSX Corp.,
offering some $10.32 billion in cash, well above CSX's $9.48
billion cash and stock offer.
<p>
   While spokesmen for the three railroads involved in the
acrimonious fight indicated that no hatchets have been buried, the
opening of dialogue may signal the possibility of a peaceful
resolution. Goode proposed the meeting in letters to his
counterparts Tuesday after Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the STB,
stunned the railroad executives with her comments in the Washington
Post Tuesday in which she encouraged the carriers to reach a
compromise, or else.
<p>
   While no official acceptance has yet been communicated, CSX
spokesman Vance Richardson said Snow will attend the proposed
meeting, ``as long as there are no preconditions. We are encouraged
by Mr. Goode's letter. We hope it's not a public relations ploy.''
<p>
   A spokesman for Conrail said LeVan would officially accept the
offer to meet in a letter back to Goode at his Norfolk, Virginia,
headquarters.
<p>
   While Richmond, Virginia-based CSX has won most of the
preliminary court decisions in the battle for Conrail, the water
was muddied last week when Conrail shareholders rejected a bid by
CSX, which is based in Richmond, Virginia, for permission to
acquire an additional 20 percent of Conrail's stock, to bring its
holdings to 40 percent.
<p>
   While Norfolk Southern hailed the vote as a major victory for
its bid, LeVan and Snow said CSX's bid would still go through,
eventually.
<p>
   While not discussing specifics of the case, the STB's Morgan
indicated that the board thought itself compelled to maintain
competition in the East, and implied that the best way might be to
divide Conrail in half. {.7 Her words motivated Goode to write to
his colleagues, and inspired them to accept his offer to meet.
<p>
   ``Her comments sparked the dialogue,'' said Bob Fort, Norfolk
Southern's vice president for public affairs. ``We're pleased,'' he
said, because Morgan's comments were similar to statements Goode
has made about the necessity of maintaining competition after the
merger.
<p>
   CSX's Richardson said Morgan ``sent a clear signal,'' and the
company was responding by agreeing to meet with Goode.
<p>
   CSX and Conrail are expected to file a formal merger application
with the STB by March 1. The STB, which replaced the Interstate
Commerce Commission, normally has three commissioners, but one of
the seats is vacant.
<p>
   A spokesman for Gus Owen, who holds the other STB seat, said the
commissioner ``has no opinion (on the matter,) and will have no
opinion'' until after all the evidence is heard.
<p>
   Morgan today said, ``I'm not ordering anyone to do anything. I'm
not threatening people.''
<p>
   She said she sees government's proper role as ``helping people
resolve their problems'' by encouraging them to seek compromises,
and stepping in only when the public interest requires it to do so.

<p>
   Stamford, Connecticut, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Tosco Corp.
reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, though poor
refining and marketing margins cut profits by 11 percent.
<p>
   The company, a refiner and owner of convenience stores, reported
that fourth-quarter net income fell to $30.2 million, or 67 cents a
share, from $33.8 million, or 90 cents a share. The per-share drop
reflects both the drop in profit and a 19 percent increase in the
number of Tosco's outstanding shares.
<p>
   Wall Street expected earnings of 63 cents a share, according to
a consensus of 12 analysts polled by IBES International. Tosco
closed up 3/8 at 91 1/2.
<p>
   ``The earnings were fine,'' said Morgan Stanley analyst Douglas
T. Terreson. ``Our estimate was 65 cents a share so it was slightly
better than expectations.''
<p>
   Thomas D. O'Malley, Tosco's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, said in a statement that ``refining and marketing margins
were weak throughout the quarter due to the industry's inability to
pass higher crude oil costs on to the consumer. Cold weather in the
East helped Tosco's Bayway Refinery to a certain degree, but
conditions on the West Coast were weak.''
<p>
   Tosco, the largest operator of convenience stores in the nation,
will be the sixth-largest U.S. refiner after it completes the $1.8
billion purchase of Unocal Corp.'s refineries and gas stations it
announced in November. The company will sell fuel through 5,300 gas
stations and convenience stores nationwide, and be the
third-largest refiner on the West Coast.
<p>
   Tosco issued shares as part of its $750 million acquisition of
the Circle K Corp. convenience store chain in May. Tosco had 44.9
million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter compared with 37.6
million last year.
<p>
   Terreson said Morgan Stanley thinks Tosco's stock has continued
room for growth. ``We have a 110 price target for Tosco by 1997,''
he said.
<p>
   Trading in Tosco stock on the New York Stock Exchange was halted
briefly today following an explosion at a Tosco refinery last
night. After trading resumed, Tosco shares fell as much as 2 to 89
1/8 before recovering
<p>
   ``There were some concerns they would have capacity off the
market for some time,'' Terreson said.
<p>
   The explosion took place yesterday at Tosco's 150,000 barrel a
day Avon refinery in Martinez, California, in the San Francisco Bay
area. The company said one worker was killed and 25 injured.

   San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Michael E. Rossi, vice
chairman of BankAmerica and a member of the bank's managing
committee said he'll retire from the bank in the second quarter of
this year. ``It's been a great run,'' Rossi, who oversees
BankAmerica's commercial banking and wealth management businesses,
said in a statement. ``I've had the opportunity to be part of the
team that restored BankAmerica to prominence in the 1980s and
achieved considerable success in the 1990s.'' Rossi, 52, plans to
retire from banking. He didn't specify what he'll do after he
leaves the bank.
<p>
   Rossi wasn't in line to become chairman, an analyst said.
<p>
   ``I don't think he was moving up,'' said George Salem, senior
vice president at Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in New York. ``He
was involved in miscellaneous lines of business. I don't consider
it any type of crisis.''
<p>
   Rossi is responsible for commercial business, international
trade banking, commercial real estate services, corporate real
estate and investment management groups and for Bank of America
Illinois.
<p>
   The company hasn't decided ``how to organize going forward,''
said David Coulter, chairman and chief executive. For now, these
units will continue to report to Rossi, he said in a statement.
<p>
   Before becoming vice chairman, Rossi was BankAmerica's chief
credit officer. He began his banking career with Bank of America in
San Francisco in 1966 as a desk officer and assistant cashier for
Mexico.
<p>
   Then he spent 16 years with Citicorp and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in
international banking assignments in Latin America and the United
States before rejoining the bank in 1986 as senior vice president
and manager of Latin America Special Assets Group.
<p>
   ``He's done an outstanding job for BankAmerica -- for its
customers and shareholders.'' Said Richard M. Rosenberg,
BankAmerica's recently retired Chairman and CEO.

    &UR; BLACK FARMERS RECOUNT STORIES OF DISCRIMINATION BEFORE PANEL
<p>
    &UR; EDs: With Rick McKay photos, COX4-COX6.
<p>
    &UR; By KIA MORGAN ALLEN &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Robert Williams Jr. was nearly moved to tears
several times Wednesday, as he recounted how he walks 13 miles each
day to his farm in Rosco, Texas with a .44 Magnum strapped to his
side.
<p>
   He does it because a gunshot shattered the window of his
tractor, just missing the back of his head, and he woke one morning
to find a sign that read: ``Go home Niger--KKK'' posted on his
gate.
<p>
   Williams, one of about two dozen farmers who addressed officials
at a civil rights listening session on Wednesday, said he has
experienced that racism and more at the hands of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
<p>
   Testifying before a panel headed by Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman, Williams and other black farmers protested against the
USDA's alleged discriminatory treatment of minority farmers when
applying for loans and other services.
<p>
   The panel, which also consisted of the Civil Rights Action Team
that Glickman formed to address discrimination complaints from
minority farmers, listened as a teary-eyed Williams gave his
testimony and two farmers pulled out the sign with the racially
offensive inscription and paraded it around the room. They rested
it behind Glickman and the panel.
<p>
   Williams, the only black farmer in a predominately white county,
said the scare tactic was made by white farmers jealous of his
productive and profitable cotton field.
<p>
   ``This is a sad day to know that black people still go through
this,'' he said. ``I feel failure in the United States
government.''
<p>
   That statement resonated with the other farmers in a session
characterized by anger, frustration, and outright disdain. Speakers
accused the USDA of conspiring to strip black farmers of their land
and urged them to investigate local USDA units.
<p>
   ``Thousands of blacks have lost farms through ignorance, racism
and prejudice at the hands of the Department of Agriculture,'' said
John Boyd, president of the National Black farmers Association.
<p>
   As Glickman sat looking stern and twiddling a pen at his
fingertips, the session  &MD;  one of 12 heard nationwide  &MD;  was laced
with stories of unjust farm foreclosures, lack of services and loan
programs for minority farmers.
<p>
   (EDs: Optional trim line. Story can end here.)
<p>
   Wednesday's meeting began with control and moderation by
Glickman and his colleagues. However, James Myart(CQ), general
counsel for the National Black Farmers Association took the podium
and took control of the session peppered with criticisms,
finger-pointing and demands.
<p>
   ``I have been eating, drinking, sleeping and crying all of these
farmers concerns,'' he told Glickman. ``I want you to call the
president and meet with him in the Rose Garden and find a
solution.''
<p>
   Case after case was addressed before the panel. One elderly man
pleaded with Glickman and asked for his land back so that he could
be buried on it. Another man said that he could barely survive.
Land that was in his family for 100 years was taken away. He urged
the board to investigate.
<p>
   Agriculture officials said a report on the state of civil rights
enforcement in the USDA will be prepared by mid-February. The
comments from the session will be used in conjunction with the
report.
<p>
   Since the onset of the complaints the USDA has begun interim
measures to deal with the problems. It has halted all pending
foreclosure sales until further review by the department, and an
audit of the civil rights issue will be done by the action team.
They have also asked the inspector general to investigate
complaints of discrimination in farm loans.
<p>
   But these initiatives, Glickman said, are just the tip of the
iceberg. He pledged to end discrimination in both USDA employment
and program participation.
<p>
   ``Under my watch I want this to be the people's department
again,'' he said. ``We will make fundamental and structural
changes.''
<p>
   But the scene was all too familiar for Shirley Sherrod, director
of Southern Cooperatives in Georgia.
<p>
   Sherrod didn't testify but says her father, a farmer, was
murdered by a white farmer in 1965. They didn't prosecute the man
and from that point, she said she made a commitment to work for
change.
<p>
   ``It seems that during the 70s the nation was forced to pretend
discrimination didn't exist. Here we are in the 90s and we're still
trying to do some of what we were trying to do in the 60s,'' she
said.
<p>
   ``In some ways I feel like things haven't changed.''

   SUPERMARKET SUING ABC AWARDED $5.5 MILLION
<p>
   (NYT)  &MD;  A federal jury in Greensboro, N.C., on Wednesday awarded
a national supermarket chain over $5.5 million in punitive damages
from ABC and two of its employees in a closely watched media case
that focused on the propriety of widely used television news
techniques like hidden cameras and undercover reporters.
<p>
   Last month, the same panel ordered ABC to pay $1,400 in actual
damages to Food Lion Inc., the chain, after finding that network
producers had trespassed and committed fraud when researching a
``PrimeTime Live'' segment in 1992 that accused the company of
selling spoiled meat.
<p>
   While Food Lion officials disputed the accuracy of the ABC
report, they did not sue the network for libel. Rather, they
accused ABC of deception by using techniques like having producers
submit fake resumes to get jobs in the meat department of company
stores, and then using hidden cameras to film there.
<p>
   Roone Arledge, the president of ABC News, defended the methods
used by the network to report the segment and said ABC would appeal
the verdict.
<p>
   COHEN CONFIRMED AS DEFENSE SECRETARY
<p>
   WASHINGTON (NYT)  &MD;  The Senate confirmed William Cohen as defense
secretary by a 99-0 vote Wednesday after the former Republican
senator predicted at a good-natured confirmation hearing that he
would sometimes differ with President Clinton on national security
policy.
<p>
   Cohen, the only Republican to serve in the new Cabinet, clung to
positions during the hearing that sometimes differed with
Clinton's. Still, he promised that he would work behind the scenes
and be a good team player. Attempting to balance expressions of
loyalty and independence, Cohen said he would not tinker with the
administration's most basic military doctrine of preparing to fight
for two major regional conflicts simultaneously but he would urge
spending more for procurement of advanced weapons.
<p>
   ATLANTA BOMBS CONTAINED DYNAMITE
<p>
   WASHINGTON (NYT)  &MD;  The federal authorities investigating the
bombing at an abortion clinic near Atlanta last week have concluded
that the two bombs used were each built with 10 to 20 sticks of
dynamite, a powerful high explosive that experts say is unusual in
homemade terrorist devices.
<p>
   In the Jan. 16 attack at the clinic, officials said they had
determined that the design of the second bomb, which detonated
about an hour after law-enforcement officers and news reporters
were drawn to the first blast, differed from the first bomb.
<p>
   The second device, which was packed in a metal, military-style
container that also held three-inch concrete nails, seemed intended
to spew metal fragments over a wide area.
<p>
   So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bombings and,
although the abortion clinic was a presumed target, investigators
are pursuing other theories, including the possibility that from
the start the attack was aimed at law-enforcement personnel.
<p>
   PIZZERIA UNO DROPS LOW-FAT CLAIM
<p>
   (NYT)  &MD;  One of the nation's leading restaurant chains, Pizzeria
Uno, has conceded that its previous advertisements for thin-crust
pizzas were false and misleading, and has promised the Federal
Trade Commission not to make such claims again.
<p>
   Craig Miller, the president and chief executive officer of Uno
Restaurant Corp., said in a telephone interview that the company
had not thoroughly examined the federal definition of low fat,
which is 3 grams of fat or less per serving.
<p>
   ``This is not something we intentionally did and the FTC
agreed,'' Miller said. ``Low-fat pizza is a pretty strong
statement, and our Thinzettas are not low fat. Only a few of them
qualify.''
<p>
   The consent agreement with the FTC, which the company signed in
October, is not an admission of guilt. The company simply promises
to stop whatever it has been accused of doing.
<p>
   JUDGE RULES PORNOGRAPHY CAN BE SOLD ON MILITARY BASES
<p>
   NEW YORK (NYT)  &MD;  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Wednesday
that the Department of Defense cannot enforce a law banning the
sale of pornographic movies and videos on military bases because it
violates constitutional protections for free speech.
<p>
   The law, the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996, forbid
stores and post exchanges on military bases from selling
pornography. Proposed in Congress as a measure to promote ``honor,
commitment and courage'' among soldiers and sailors, the law was
scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this year.
<p>
   But ruling on a challenge filed by the parent company of
Penthouse Magazine, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said that
the government cannot ban the sale of the material merely because
officials find it offensive.
<p>
   MAGNIFIED PARTICLES TRACKED FROM SUN TO EARTH
<p>
   GREENBELT, Md. (NYT)  &MD;  The sun released a giant cloud of
magnetized particles that researchers were able to monitor in
detail for the first time as it approached and swept past the Earth
this month, scientists said Wednesday.
<p>
   An international group of space scientists said the sun ejected
a pocket of mass from its corona on Jan. 6 that developed into a
giant, tube-shaped magnetic bubble that hit the Earth almost four
days later. The expanding cloud of energized particles triggered a
large storm in the magnetic field, or magnetosphere, surrounding
the planet. The storm brightened the Northern Lights and possibly
knocked out a key communications satellite.
<p>
   Speaking at a briefing here at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center, scientists said the mass eruption from the sun was not so
unusual in itself. The unique thing, they said, was that it was
spotted shortly after it occurred on the sun's surface and tracked
by space satellites and Earth stations as it traveled the 93
million miles to the Earth and then passed the planet.

 &UR; SPRINT BUILDS A PHONE SYSTEM FOR THE SUPER BOWL -- IN A BIG HURRY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID HAYES &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC; 
   (Undated) Think about what it would take to build a telephone
system for a city about the size of Roeland Park, Kan., or
Harrisonville, Mo.  &MD;  from scratch.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   After that, make sure your phone system will work in a place
where someone is using just about every phone just about all the
time. So populate that city with thousands of 16-year-olds.
<p>
   To top it off, do it all in three weeks.
<p>
   That's about the equivalent of what Sprint Corp. has done in New
Orleans, where the company is a sponsor and official long-distance
company for the National Football League and Super Bowl XXXI.
<p>
   Dozens of Sprint employees have been in New Orleans since Jan.
3, where they've been laying cable  &MD;  about 21 miles of telephone
wire  &MD;  and setting up more than 3,000 telephone lines to prepare
for the Green Bay-New England game.
<p>
   ``How we create a telecommunications infrastructure in New
Orleans is similar to how we would create a network for a small
town,'' said Steve Reed, Sprint's national manager of NFL business
development.
<p>
   Sprint and the NFL cut a multimillion-dollar, three-year deal in
April, making the long-distance company an official NFL sponsor and
the league's telecommunications services provider. It also made
Sprint responsible for telephone service to the Super Bowl.
<p>
   That means Sprint is responsible for everything from plain old
telephone service for AFC and NFC officials in New Orleans to
managing the Internet traffic at the official Super Bowl site
(http: &HT;    And, in between, Sprint employees have been setting up a glitzy
``Sprint Stadium'' inside the NFL Experience, an indoor theme park
at the New Orleans convention center for visitors who traveled to
Louisiana for the world's biggest one-day sporting event.
<p>
   There, visitors will walk across an artificial turf playing
field and be greeted by a Jumbotron screen. They'll have a chance
to talk one-on-one  &MD;  during a big-screen teleconference  &MD;  with
players and coaches. They'll be able to surf the Internet and make
phone calls.
<p>
   Although Sprint officials hope that Sprint Stadium wows visitors
to New Orleans, they're hoping that the company's larger presence
in the city will go mostly unnoticed.
<p>
   If it does, that means the thousands of telephone lines worked
OK; the 200 fax machines churned out letters, documents and
statistics sheets as required; and that computers in the NFL's
``virtual headquarters'' in three floors of the Hyatt hotel
downtown were connected seamlessly to the league's offices in New
York and to all 30 football clubs.
<p>
   ``Our purpose is to enable all of these parties to stay in
continuous contact with each other, as well as with the rest of the
world,'' Reed said.
<p>
   It's no small task, and there's a lot riding on the outcome.
<p>
   Sprint officials only have to look back a few months, when
industry-leading AT&AMP;T ran into a series of problems at the Summer
Olympics in Atlanta. What was supposed to be a publicity boon for
AT&AMP;T turned into a public relations mishap when some systems  &MD; 
mostly those involving results sent to the media  &MD;  failed or
provided wrong information.
<p>
   Sprint hopes to avoid such problems by building redundancy into
the telephone system that links six headquarters locations in New
Orleans with the rest of the world. The company built temporary
overhead ``bridges'' to carry phone lines across streets. ``Hot
lines'' have been built to link the NFL Control Center at the
Superdome directly to the playing field.
<p>
   Sprint is bringing translators into the press box to handle
technology problems posed by foreign journalists.
<p>
   Getting that small-city phone network up and running  &MD;  and doing
so in less than three weeks  &MD;  proved to be one of Sprint's greatest
challenges, according to company officials. But the company is
hoping the high-visibility it gets on game day will be worth the
effort.
<p>
   ``Providing the latest technology for Super Bowl XXXI is a
tremendous opportunity for Sprint,'' said Mike Goff, director of
corporate sponsorships.
<p>
   ``Not only does it allow us to play an integral role in making
this event successful for the NFL, but it also allows us to
demonstrate our capabilities as a telecommunications provider to
the world.''

<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  A publisher that posed as the maker of the traditional
Yellow Pages telephone directory, luring many businesses into
paying for what they thought was a listing renewal, has been
ordered to pay a $1 million penalty to the state.
<p>
   AmCan Enterprises, a now-defunct operation based in Miami, and
its owner, Charles Smith, sent mailings that looked like invoices,
had the Yellow Pages and walking-fingers designs and used language
about ``renewal'' fees, said Ernest Sarason, an assistant attorney
general.
<p>
   ``It sends a strong message to scam artists: Stay out of
Massachusetts or prepare to pay a very hefty penalty,'' said
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger.
<p>
   Sarason said the $1 million penalty doubles what the state
sought in its hearings before Suffolk Superior Court Judge Patrick
King. AmCan's attorney, Bruce G. McNeill of Boston, said his client
will appeal.
<p>
   In 1994 alone, 1,300 businesses in Massachusetts signed on for
the directories, which were labeled New England Yellow Pages,
Yellow Pages National Edition and N.E. U.S. Directories. A total of
2.3 million solicitations were sent to Massachusetts businesses
from 1990 to 1994.
<p>
   Nynex business subscribers do not pay extra for one listing in
the Yellow Pages and the white pages. Extra charges only apply if
they seek a larger advertisement in the directories, said Phil
Santoro, a Nynex spokesman.
<p>
   Nine Bay State business owners who complained to the attorney
general's office are now entitled to restitution from the company
for the fees paid, according to the Jan. 10 decision by King.
<p>
   While thousands more also paid AmCan, they do not benefit from
the restitution because they did not initiate contact with the
state to become part of the lawsuit.
<p>
   Aside from the $1 million in penalties, the judge also ordered
AmCan to pay about $26,000 in attorney's fees. The company has also
been sued by authorities in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida for
deceptive advertising, state officials said.
<p>
   McNeill said the company was operating a legitimate business
when it ceased operation a few years ago, unable to sustain the
costs of all the litigation. He said the penalty is excessive, and
the ruling will be appealed on numerous legal grounds.
<p>
   Sarason said the attorney general's office received 75
complaints from different businesses about AmCan, most of whom
caught on before paying fees, prompting the filing of the lawsuit
in 1993. ``It's classic deception,'' said Sarason. ``Everything
they say can be true, but the real effect is to fool you.''

<p>
   SEOUL, South Korea  &MD;  Opposition parties said Wednesday that they
remained dissatisfied with President Kim Young-sam's unexpected
offer to allow revision of the contested labor laws, suggesting
that the national crisis over the legislation may continue for some
time.
<p>
   Kim wants to hold a special session of the National Assembly
next month to resolve the issue, apparently by allowing changes
that would soften the labor code. But opposition parties and labor
unions are sticking to their original demand that the laws be
repealed entirely before the next step  &MD;  hammering out a revision  &MD; 
can take place.
<p>
   Thus the gap between the two sides has been greatly narrowed,
but it still may be too much to bridge for the time being.
<p>
   The unions showed that they were unimpressed by going on strike
Wednesday, pursuing a once-a-week national walkout to protest the
labor laws. The unions had been striking daily until a few days
ago, and they say they will resume the general strike next month if
the dispute is not resolved until then.
<p>
   The strike was not hugely disruptive Wednesday, except in the
auto industry, and, as has been the case in the past, the
government said only a small number took part while unions
announced that 140,000 people participated  &MD;  still a modest number
in a country with 12 million workers.
<p>
   The crisis began last month when the ruling party, annoyed that
opposition lawmakers were physically preventing the passage of
legislation, secretly met in a dawn session of the National
Assembly. In seven minutes, without opposition members present,
they passed landmark bills to revise South Korea's labor code and
to give broad new powers to a domestic spy agency that in the past
has been used for political repression.
<p>
   Officials in the ruling party say that the new labor laws  &MD; 
which make it easier for companies to lay off workers and adopt
more flexible patterns of employment  &MD;  are necessary to make the
country competitive in international markets. The security law is
essential, they say, because of the threat of subversion from North
Korea.
<p>
   After Kim agreed to allow revisions of the labor laws, the main
opposition leader, Kim Dae-jung, initially made conciliatory
comments suggesting that there had been ``some advance.'' But after
discussions among themselves, the opposition groups then seemed to
harden their position and reasserted their demand for complete
repeal.
<p>
   ``Any debate in Parliament must be made on the condition that
the law is made null and void,'' Park Sun-sook, of the main
opposition party, the National Congress for New Politics, was
quoted by Reuters as saying Wednesday. For his part, Kim is
insisting that the laws were legally passed and cannot be repealed
in their entirety.

Natural Gas futures finished lower across the board as traders
balanced their accounts ahead of the gas storage report late
Wednesday. About 1,200 contracts traded.
<p>
   In wheat, new-crop contracts in Kansas City and Chicago
generally held firm because of recent volatile temperatures. Some
analysts say that current mild conditions have allowed protective
snow cover to melt and are reducing the hardiness of the winter
crop.
<p>
   Corn futures traded steady in nearby contract months amid rumors
of potential business from Asian countries as well as Egypt and
Iraq.
<p>
   Soybean futures finished moderately lower, with pressure coming
primarily from the expiration of the January contracts. Pressure
also came from improved growing conditions in South America, a
major bean competitor of the United States.
<p>
   In the Kansas City Value Line, the stock-index cash settled at a
new high of 706.18, while the March futures contract settled down
60 basis points.
<p>
   The broad market managed to trade firm all day, despite a lower
trend for the Dow industrial average, said Kansas City trader Paul
Dow.
<p>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was dragged down by IBM, whose
earnings were not as robust as other computer industry stocks.

   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
shrank 20.6 percent in December from the same month a year ago to
881.475 billion yen ($7.4 billion), the Finance Ministry said.
<p>
   That's the 24th decline in 25 months.
<p>
   A senior ministry official said the government expects the
overall trade surplus will continue to shrink and that auto exports
will continue to rise.
<p>
   The surplus was smaller than expected. Economists said the
surplus would be 1.055 trillion yen, according to a survey compiled
by Bloomberg Business News. Projections ranged from 970 billion yen
to 1.145 trillion yen.
<p>
   The trade surplus grew 0.2 percent in November compared to a
year earlier. That figure was later revised to a 0.4 percent
decline.
<p>
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States in December rose
7.8 percent to 389.113 billion yen, the ministry said.
<p>
   Global imports to Japan rose 13.4 percent to 3.286 trillion yen,
while exports increased 4.0 percent to 4.168 trillion yen, the
ministry said.
<p>
   For all of 1996, Japan's trade surplus fell 32.4 percent to 6.7
trillion yen. The country's full-year trade surplus with the U.S.
fell 16.5 percent to 3.6 trillion yen.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  &MD;  If you have a toddler, you're probably
nervously eyeballing that tippy cup. Hmmm, just how many ounces of
juice does this thing hold?
<p>
   ``You never measure. You just pour it in,'' says Kansas City
resident Carrie Larson, the mom of Teddy, 2, and Tommy, 1.
<p>
   But the January issue of Pediatrics, a journal of the American
Pediatric Association, says preschoolers who drink more than 12
ounces of juice a day tend to be shorter and fatter than their
peers.
<p>
   For children a year old and up, 4 ounces of juice a day is
``reasonable,'' according to Lanette Meyer, a clinical dietitian at
Children's Mercy Hospital here. ``That's a surprise to parents
because everyone thinks juice is so nutritious,'' she says.
<p>
   It turns out that the problem with fruit juice is that it tends
to be high in calories. Children who drink too much juice fill
small tummies with juice instead of more nutritious foods.
<p>
   Meyer says infants should not be introduced to juice before the
age of 6 months or they risk developing a ``juice dependency that
is not beneficial.'' And never give your child juice in a bottle;
use a cup instead.
<p>
   Preschoolers who eat the recommended two to three servings of
fresh, canned or dried fruit each day don't actually need any fruit
juice and reap the added benefits of fiber that is not found in
juice. (A serving is one-quarter to one-half cup of fruit.)
<p>
   When Meyer works with overweight children, she often finds that
they drink juice or soft drinks instead of water. ``When you get
into the habit of drinking juice as a thirst quencher, then you get
into large amounts and then you get too many calories,'' she says.
<p>
   So how can parents wean a juice monster?
<p>
   Toddlers like control almost as much as they like juice, so
Larson lets Teddy keep a water bottle by his bedside. Using the
nifty, pop-up spout, he can help himself to a drink throughout the
day. He has never developed a juice habit.
<p>
   Preschoolers also thrive on routine. About the time Lynn Jones
of Leawood, Kan., saw her 2-year-old daughter, Abby, falling into
the juice trap, she decided to impose limits. She offers Abby a
7-ounce cup of half water//half juice in the morning; she gets a
second cup after her nap. ``She fought it at first,'' says Jones,
``but eventually she got used to it.''
<p>
   The popular child-rearing guide What To Expect: The Toddler
Years, by Arlene Eisenberg, Heidi E. Murkoff and Sandee Hathaway,
suggests choosing orange, papaya, pineapple (all rich in vitamin
C), apricot nectar (rich in vitamin A), mango juice or vegetable
juice (rich in both) over apple juice. The guide also advises
choosing 100 percent fruit juice instead of 10 percent fruit-juice
drinks.
<p>
   But Meyer says that while one fruit juice may have more vitamins
than another, they all have comparable calories.

<p>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus  &MD;  Almost everything about northern Cyprus  &MD;  its
name, its status, the reasons for the 110 miles of barbed wire that
divide it from the rest of the island  &MD;  is a matter of bitter
dispute. But little stirs passions on either side of the nearly
23-year-old buffer zone like the issue of exactly who lives north
of it.
<p>
   According to Greek Cypriots, the ``occupied territories,''
partitioned after Turkish troops landed in 1974, are filling up
with Anatolian peasants from Turkey, as many as 100,000 by some
accounts. They say these Turks are taking the places of an
ever-dwindling, fast-emigrating population of Turkish Cypriots.
<p>
   A result, Greek Cypriot officials say, is that Turkish Cypriots,
who in 1974 numbered 116,000 out of a total Cypriot population of
641,000, are now outnumbered on their own land.
<p>
   On the Turkish side of the divide, Turkish Cypriot officials
dismiss such numbers as Greek propaganda. ``It is wrong,'' said
Rauf Denktash, 72, the president of the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, a state that declared its independence after the
Turkish invasion but is still recognized only by Turkey. ``They are
trying to make believe that there are no Turkish Cypriots at all.''
<p>
   Denktash does not deny that settlers from Turkey have come to
Cyprus, mainly in the 1970s. But he says that only about 15,000
have taken up residence and produced families. As for the rest, he
said, they are either tourists or seasonal workers who don't stay
the five years required to acquire Turkish Cypriot citizenship.
<p>
   For years, the argument over the size of the Turkish Cypriot
population has been one of many roadblocks to a political
settlement. If Greek and Turkish Cypriots have had such trouble
living together over the last decades, then what chances are there
for the Greek population in the south, which now numbers more than
600,000, to live peacefully with immigrants from Turkey in a
united, federated Cyprus?
<p>
   Until now, one element lacking in this particular debate has
been reliable population figures. Last month, for the first time
since 1974, the Turkish Cypriot government conducted a census. On
Dec. 15, 2,500 census takers fanned out across northern Cyprus,
asking people their age, marital status, citizenship, religion and
 &MD;  the touchiest question of all  &MD;  their birthplace.
<p>
   According to preliminary results, the population of northern
Cyprus was 198,215. Further details will take weeks, maybe months,
to compile, experts here say. But the big question will be when,
and if, statistics on the number of Turkish-born settlers are ever
released.
<p>
   ``Unless the issue is taken out of politics, we may never
know,'' said Mustafa Akinci, leader of the Communal Liberation
Party, an opposition party in the Turkish part of Cyprus. ``Will
they publish the birthplaces? I don't know. And until they do, it
is hard to tell just how many Turkish Cypriots are left.''
<p>
   Akinci, like many Turkish Cypriots, fears that their numbers are
indeed dwindling, not as fast as the Greek Cypriots say, but enough
to change the face of the island. The economy of northern Cyprus,
now under international embargo, has become increasingly depressed
and dependent on Turkish aid.
<p>
   Ankara's official aid bill for Turkish-ruled Cyprus in 1997 is
$250 million, and that does not include the cost of maintaining
35,000 Turkish troops on the island. Meanwhile, the gap between the
rich south and the poor north, is growing even wider.
<p>
   With two million tourists a year, and a widening reputation as
an off-shore financial center, the Cyprus of Greek Cypriots is a
prosperous place, with a per capita annual income of $12,000,
higher than either Greece or Portugal. The per capita income in the
northern part is only $4,000, which explains why many young people
are leaving, often to Britain, the colonial power until 1960.
<p>
   ``Each time I go to London, I see faces that I used to see in
Cyprus,'' Akinci said. ``Unfortunately, we are losing the most
precious section of society. If this trend continues, we are going
to end up a white-haired country.''
<p>
   In the meantime, the recent arrivals from Turkey  &MD;  many of them
single men who come for seasonal work at construction sites or at
resorts  &MD;  are widely blamed for rising crime in the north.
Burglaries, for example, reached record levels last year: 300
houses were broken into in the first 10 months of 1996.
<p>
   ``People in northern Cyprus are not used to locking their cars,
their houses,'' Akinci said. ``Unfortunately, the bigger a society
becomes, the possibility of wrongdoers increases.''
<p>
   In the old resort town of Kyrenia, which was emptied of its
Greek inhabitants after 1974, many of the men sitting at the
outdoor cafes that line the pretty half-moon harbor lament what has
become of Turkish Cyprus.
<p>
   ``The Turks are willing to work for less and those Turkish
Cypriots who don't have their own business or government jobs are
leaving,'' said Turan Yeshilada, 36, who owns a clothing store in
Nicosia. ``I would prefer to have our own citizens, but it is not
enough to hope. If we don't find a solution for this island, the
only way is down.''

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  When the royal yacht Britannia sailed from Plymouth on
Monday on a final Far East tour before its decommissioning in
August, Britons thought they would never see her costly like again.
<p>
   But, unexpectedly, the government said Wednesday that a new $100
million ship will be built to replace it and will enter service in
2002 in time for the queen's golden jubilee. The Britannia cost
2,098,000 pounds to build in 1953, equivalent to $52.5 million
today.
<p>
   Wednesday's announcement appeared to put an end to a lengthy
debate in which detractors argued that the vessel was an
anachronism. Lately the queen has used it only once a year, for a
ritual cruise around the Western Isles off Scotland; for more
extended travel, she goes by air.
<p>
   But in her four decades of service the 5,769-ton, 412-foot
Britannia has logged more than a million miles, mostly as a
floating platform for business diplomacy. The government credits
Britannia with having provided British businessmen with an alluring
venue for meeting their counterparts abroad and thereby having
secured more than $3 billion worth of trade for Britain in the last
decade.
<p>
   Aside from its cost, no details of the new royal vessel have
been decided. But officials said the budgeted amount would build a
ship in the same league as the Britannia.
<p>
   The expectation had been that if there were to be any new royal
vessel, it would have to be paid for by private contributions. But
Michael Portillo, the defense minister, said Wednesday that the
government believed the yacht  &MD;  a symbol of ``our crown, our
kingdom and our nation's pride''  &MD;  should be funded by the nation
rather than by sponsorship.
<p>
   The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, also
reported that the queen had been concerned that a yacht not paid
for by the government would end up with commercial logos on its
funnels ``out of keeping with the ambience of the royal yacht.''
<p>
   Members of both parties in the House of Commons robustly cheered
the announcement Wednesday. Unions welcomed it as ``wonderful
news'' for the nation's slowly recovering shipbuilding industry.
The Britannia was constructed at Clydebank, near Glasgow, in the
same yard that produced the liners Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Mary
and QE2. Michael Forsyth, the head of the Scottish office in Prime
Minister John Major's cabinet, said Wednesday, ``Our fathers built
the old Britannia; this is the chance to show the world that their
skills live on today.''
<p>
   The Britannia's present seven-month tour of the Mediterranean,
Arabian Gulf, Indian Ocean and Far East will take it to Hong Kong,
where it will play a principal ceremonial role in the handover of
the colony to China at the end of June.
<p>
   After her decommissioning, she will not put to sea again, and,
Portillo said Wednesday, she will not be sold. He invited proposals
for a ``suitably prestigious use,'' one that would keep her ``in
excellent condition.'' He added, ``If that cannot be assured it
would be better to see her scrapped than to see her deteriorate.''

<p>
   Question: What's the difference between the National Federation
of Independent Business and the 105th Congress?
<p>
   Answer: The business group's legislative agenda is substantially
more ambitious.
<p>
   When the country's most aggressive small-business lobbying group
unveiled its goals in six areas last week, the list obviously
focused on concerns shared by business of all sizes. What made
fulfillment of these goals more critical to small businesses,
however, is what can be best described as the coping factor.
<p>
   Whereas troublesome government policies are merely that for big,
resource-rich corporations, they go far beyond troublesome for
small business. The smaller the business, the more troublesome
ill-advised tax and regulatory policies become. The federation's
wish list includes the following:
<p>
   -- Regulation: The goal here is to push Congress to ensure that
regulatory relief laws passed in 1996 are enforced. Other
initiatives include a push for rigorous regulatory cost-benefit
analysis, review of administrative mandates that unduly burden
small business, and liberalization of regulatory compliance
policies.
<p>
   -- Taxes: The federation will seek payroll and capital-gains tax
relief, as well as estate tax reform aimed at ensuring that small
businesses won't have to be sold or liquidated to meet tax
obligations when the owner dies.
<p>
   -- Health care: It will seek expanded opportunities for
participation in health-care coverage cooperatives and allowing the
self-employed full tax deductibility for insurance premiums.
<p>
   -- Legal reforms: Limits on punitive damage awards will be
sought to ameliorate litigation exposure.
<p>
   -- Government mandates: The group will fight attempts to mandate
expanded health-insurance benefits or Family and Medical Leave
provisions.
<p>
   -- Deficit reduction: This includes support for both a
constitutional balanced budget amendment as well as achievement of
a balanced budget without raising taxes.
<p>
   Federation President Jack Faris acknowledged last term's
significant victories but said this session's agenda is critical to
sustaining small business's role as the economy's most dynamic
source of new jobs.
<p>
   His reasoning is sound, of course, but his characterization of
the 105th as a ``small-business friendly'' Congress may miss the
point and thereby explain why the federation agenda will prove too
ambitious.
<p>
   Although the Republicans retained their majority control of both
the House and Senate, there is no sign yet that they plan to use
their power aggressively. The Democrats, conversely, have been
kicking up their heels as if they're in charge.
<p>
   If the GOP does remain timid and the Democrats remain on the
offensive, it will be bad news indeed for small business. Despite
widespread perceptions to the contrary, the Democrats' long reign
transformed them into the party of big business because they were
uninterrupted source of legislative power for so many years. The
GOP's minority status tended to make it the party of small business
almost by default. This anomaly became evident after the GOP took
power and small business priorities got more respect on Capitol
Hill.
<p>
   The Republican majority is no doubt in tune with the small
business agenda as articulated by the National Federation of
Independent Business. The question is whether it can muster the
resolve to do what it was re-elected to do.

<p>
   Los Angeles, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp.
director John Kluge, the billionaire who heads up the
telecommunications and entertainment company Metromedia
International Group Inc., bought $24 million in Occidental stock in
early December just as the shares approached an 11-month low.
<p>
   Kluge's purchases, for a million shares at about $24 each, give
him 0.31 percent, or 1.02 million shares, of the oil company's
stock. Ahead of him is Chairman Ray Irani, who has about 1.6
million shares.
<p>
   It's a big gamble for Kluge. In 1996, Occidental's shares rose
only 8 percent, compared with 20 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
index of domestic integrated oil companies, and 19 percent for the
S&AMP;P 500 Index.
<p>
   Occidental's performance has been hurt by its heavy reliance on
chemicals for earnings. Last year, 40 percent of Occidental's
profits came from chemical operations, which have been squeezed by
rising raw material costs and an unwillingness of customers to pay
more for products. By contrast, rival Exxon's chemical unit brought
in about 18 percent of the company's profit in 1996.
<p>
   So far, Kluge's purchases have paid off handsomely. Since Dec.
10, Occidental is up 14 percent to 26 1/4 -- partially because
institutional investors are mimicking Kluge's move. That's a paper
profit of more than $3 million for Kluge.
<p>
   ``Kluge's buying indicates he sees some value there that the
rest of the market hasn't seen,'' said Kenneth Enright, manager of
the MFS Managed Sectors Fund, which holds 400,000 Occidental
shares, according to SEC filings.
<p>
   After hitting a 52-week-high of 27 on April 25, 1996, Occidental
fell 19 percent to 21 7/8 on Dec. 17. Much of that was a
continuation of a selloff that began after Nov. 21, when Occidental
announced the start of an employee stock ownership plan at its
MidCon natural gas pipeline subsidiary, said Mark Hastings, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
<p>
   The announcement dashed expectations that the company would sell
the unit to focus more on exploration and production.
<p>
   The stock rebounded later as investors realized the stock plan
didn't preclude a possible joint venture, spinoff or sale of the
unit, Hastings said, estimating MidCon could fetch more than $3
billion.
<p>
   Occidental says it's taking steps to turn around. For one thing,
the company is downplaying chemicals and focusing more on oil and
natural gas, because prices for both are rising rapidly. The
average price for crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange
rose 36 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 from the same quarter
in 1995. Natural gas rose 48 percent. Occidental has said its oil
production could rise to 350,000 barrels in 1998 vs. 278,000 in
1995.
<p>
   To boost chemical profits, Occidental wants to increase the
specialty chemicals side of its business, generally considered less
cyclical than commodity chemicals.
<p>
   Occidental has also paid down debt with profits it earned during
an advance in the chemicals industry in 1994, and by selling off
non-core chemical divisions in 1995.
<p>
   In November, Occidental said it expected long-term debt to fall
to $4.5 billion by the end of 1996, down from $8 billion at the end
of 1990. The company has also said it hopes to lower interest
expense to about $400 million in 1997, compared with about $550
million in 1995.
<p>
   Kluge, an Occidental board member since 1984, declined to
comment on his stock purchases. Worth $7.2 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, Kluge is also chairman of WorldCom Inc., the
nation's No. 4 long-distance company behind AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI
Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. Metromedia's assets include
Orion Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn Co.
<p>
   Occidental and the company's big investors are buoyed by Kluge's
vote of confidence. ``Anytime we see an individual buying shares,
we see that as a good thing,'' said Kenneth Huffman, vice president
of Occidental investor relations.
<p>
   ``Certainly, with a stock like this that's underperformed the
market, this reinforces our decision to hold onto it,'' added Scott
Schermerhorn, manager of the Federated Stock Trust mutual fund,
which holds 387,200 shares of Occidental, according to recent
filings with the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission.

 &UR; BEAR STEARNS CITES EARNINGS OF $176.5 MILLION, UP 68 PERCENT &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Bear Stearns Cos. on Wednesday became the latest
investment bank to surpass analysts' forecasts.
<p>
   Bolstered by the bull market, Bear Stearns earned $176.5
million, or $1.27 a share, for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec.
31, 1996, an increase of 68 percent from the comparable period a
year earlier. IBES Inc., a research firm, using a consensus of six
analysts' estimates, had forecast per-share earnings of 89 cents.
<p>
   Bear Stearns reported a return on equity of more than 33 percent
for the quarter, significantly above several of its competitors.
Revenues net of interest expense rose 37 percent, to $940.1
million.
<p>
   ``If this isn't good, I don't know what is,'' James E. Cayne,
the company's president and chief executive, said in an interview
at his office Wednesday.
<p>
   Bear Stearns attributed its record earnings to a number of
factors, including a 12.5 percent rise in quarterly commission
revenue to $183.6 million; transactions for its own account that
brought revenues of $429.2 million, a 65 percent increase over the
year-earlier quarter, and investment banking revenues that rose 22
percent, to $183.1 million.
<p>
   The company also held compensation to 48.6 percent of revenues
in the quarter, compared with just over 50 percent a year earlier.
<p>
   On Wall Street, where investment bankers and trader make huge
amounts of money, compensation typically equals about 50 percent of
revenues. Unlike some of its competitors, Bear Stearns has not
suffered many defections to large foreign banks and others trying
to break into Wall Street, executives at the company said
Wednesday.
<p>
   Bear Stearns stock rose $1.875 a share Wednesday to $31.75, on a
mixed day for brokerage firms.
<p>
   ``I think it was an outstanding quarter; the company was firing
on all cylinders,'' said Katrina Blecher, an analyst with Gruntal &AMP;
Company. ``The clear winners were the firm's principal
transactions, which benefited from strength in the fixed-income
market, and their investment banking, and they were still able to
keep their compensation well under control.''
<p>
   December is traditionally a quiet month for business on Wall
Street that pulls down the quarterly revenues of securities firms.
But that was not true in 1996, when securities trading remained
buoyant during the last month of the year.
<p>
   Another securities firm, Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co., also
surpassed analysts' earnings forecasts Wednesday.
<p>
   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $227.8 million,
an increase of 28 percent from the 1995 period. Per-share earnings
at the brokerage firm and financial services company advanced 33
percent, to 68 cents a share, after being restating for a 2-for-1
stock split. A poll of seven analysts' estimates published by Zacks
Investment Research had predicted 65 cents a share.
<p>
   Dean Witter attributed its good fourth quarter in its securities
business to increased asset management and administration fees,
higher commission revenues from the sale of equity and insurance
products, increased underwriting business and an increase of 180
account executives. In its credit business, merchant and cardmember
fees for the quarter rose 48 percent, to $563.8 million, from the
last three months of 1995.
<p>
   In December 1996, Dean Witter also bought for an undisclosed sum
Lombard Securities Inc., a company that provides on-line brokerage
services.
<p>
   Analysts generally liked Dean Witter's results.
<p>
   ``They were three cents above our estimate for earnings per
share, there were very strong revenues in credit services,'' said
Mark C. Alpert, an analyst with the New York office of Alex. Brown
&AMP; Co. ``Revenues were very strong in the card business.''

<p>
   Philadelphia, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Conrail Inc. said it posted
a fourth-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, on rising
traffic and reduced spending.
<p>
   The railroad, which is the subject of a takeover fight, reported
net income of $147 million, or $1.86 a share, compared with a loss
of $30 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
<p>
   Revenue fell to $943 million from $951 million.
<p>
   The earnings beat the average estimate of $1.80 a share of 11
analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
<p>
   Conrail announced the results after the close of trading. Shares
of Conrail rose 3 1/2 to 107 1/2, a 52-week high.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Conrail has agreed to be acquired by CSX
Corp. for $9.72 billion in cash and stock. Norfolk Southern Corp.
has made a rival bid of $10.32 billion in cash.
<p>
   ``Despite the potential for distractions resulting from our
proposed merger with CSX, our people clearly focused on controlling
costs, improving safety and maintaining high levels of service to
our customers,'' David LeVan, Conrail's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
<p>
   Late today, the chairmen of CSX and Norfolk Southern agreed to
meet in an attempt to reach a compromise in their contest to
acquire Conrail.
<p>
   Earlier, CSX said it was extending its tender offer for 20.1
percent of Conrail's shares to 5 p.m. on Feb. 14. It was originally
scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today. CSX already owns 19.9 percent
of Conrail.
<p>
   Also today, Norfolk Southern began its promised tender offer to
buy 8.2 million Conrail shares at $115 each. That's the maximum
number of shares Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering
Conrail's ``poison pill'' defense against hostile takeovers.
<p>
   For the quarter, Conrail said its traffic rose 4.7 percent.
LeVan said costs decreased in every major category except fuel.
Compensation and benefits payments fell 8.2 percent; materials and
supplies costs fell 6.1 percent; and insurance costs fell 21.2
percent.
<p>
   For 1996, Conrail's net income rose to $342 million, or $4.25 a
share, from $264 million, or $3.19, in 1995.
<p>
   Revenue rose to $3.7 billion from $3.68 billion.

   Mexico City, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Mexico's Finance Minister
Guillermo Ortiz estimated the country's economy grew between 4.6
percent or 4.7 percent last year, well above earlier estimates.
<p>
   The government's original growth forecast was for 3 percent,
while analysts predicted growth of 4.3 percent.
<p>
   Ortiz, who made his remarks yesterday in the central city of
Queretaro, said the government will end up with a big fiscal
surplus in 1996 because of higher-than-expected international crude
oil prices.
<p>
   The government plans to use some of the surplus to continue
helping the country's financial system, Mexico's Finance Minister
said.
<p>
   Ortiz also estimated January's inflation rate at about 2 percent
or slightly more.

   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Women's NBA assigned 16
players to its eight teams for its inaugural season, including
Sheryl Swoopes, Rebecca Lobo and Lisa Leslie.
<p>
   The 16, who are the only players who are under contract with the
new league, have combined to win 16 Olympic gold medals, nine NCAA
championships and 16 all-America awards.
<p>
   ``The selection process for the first 16 players was based on
competitive factors, geographic associations and on input from each
of the WNBA teams,'' said WNBA President Val Ackerman.
<p>
   Among those who will be playing in cities near where they played
college ball are Swoopes, a forward from Texas Tech, in Houston;
Lobo, a center-forward from the University of Connecticut, in New
York; and Leslie, a center from USC, in Los Angeles.
<p>
   Also assigned to Los Angeles was guard Penny Toler.
<p>
   Guard Cynthia Cooper will play in Houston. Guard Teresa
Weatherspoon will play for New York, while center Janice Lawrence
Braxton and guard Michelle Edwards have been assigned to Cleveland.
<p>
   Center Vicky Bullett and guard Andrea Stinson will play in
Charlotte, North Carolina, while guard Michele Timms and center
Jennifer Gillom were assigned to Phoenix.
<p>
   Guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and forward Bridgette Gordon will
play for Sacramento, California, while center-forward Elena
Baranova and guard Lady Hardmon were assigned to Utah.
<p>
   The league hopes to announce its next 16 signings and team
assignments by late February, while a player draft will be held
April 28. The season starts June 21.

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  When Sen. Rufus Choate in 1856 coined a phrase by
criticizing ``the glittering and sounding generalities'' of the
Declaration of Independence, Ralph Waldo Emerson snapped back with:
``Glittering generalities? They are blazing ubiquities!''
<p>
   That was my chauvinist reaction when The Daily Telegraph,
Britain's liveliest quality newspaper, dismissed President
Clinton's second Inaugural Address as ``banal.''
<p>
   Banal it was not. (That word better describes the plodding poem
read at the ceremony.) Although Clinton's reach for historical
resonance hardly blazed with all-pervasive wisdom, his speech was a
respectable effort, forcefully delivered.
<p>
   In assessing his second inaugural, much depended on how you
participated in the occasion.
<p>
   If you watched as a conservative partisan, you could take
umbrage at his pose of being above the battle. Who is this tricky
triangulator  &MD;  demagogue of Mediscare and rental agent of the
Lincoln bedroom  &MD;  to denounce as ``petty bickering and extreme
partisanship'' congressional disagreement with his outrageous
campaign misrepresentations?
<p>
   If you nitpicked as a writer, you winced at his sentence
fragments, at the awkwardness of shaping a hope into a chapter, and
at the risk of building a speech on the theme of a new ``promised
land''  &MD;  inviting distrust of political promises or derision at
presuming to be a new Moses.
<p>
   But if you let the ceremony wash over you as an American  &MD;  the
monumental setting, the singing of patriotic hymns, the flags, the
oath, the traditional speech  &MD;  you gained an appreciation of what
your president was trying to do.
<p>
   He paid more than the usual obeisance to the black community.
His reminder about the scourge of slavery, his evocation of Martin
Luther King Jr. ``at the other end of this Mall'' and his ``we
shall overcome'' are both payback for monolithic political support
and a genuine expression of one of his few bedrock principles. The
time for affirmative action is out of joint, but for Clinton to
press his strength on race relations is good for the country.
<p>
   He bestraddled the center like a would-be Colossus with ``The
pre-eminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans
an opportunity  &MD;  not a guarantee. ...'' That sentiment was one Newt
Gingrich of the Opportunity Society had to applaud, while
entitlement liberals had to cringe.
<p>
   At the same time, Clinton replied to Ronald Reagan's inaugural
``government is not the solution to our problem'' with an oblique
``government is not the problem and not the solution.''
<p>
   Few can argue with Clinton's welcome call for an assumption of
personal responsibility, unless his simultaneous embrace of ``a new
spirit of community'' turns out to be a euphemism for the continued
assumption of that responsibility by government.
<p>
   His vision of ``a land of new promise''  &MD;  the ``I see an America
where'' construction beloved of American orators  &MD;  is not to be
cynically dismissed. It's a fine farrago of hopes that need to be
expressed by our elected leader as he repeats the informal ``so
help me God'' that George Washington added to the oath set down in
our Constitution.
<p>
   Viewed from across an ocean, the president acting as president
comes across more vividly than when viewed inside our borders or
D.C.'s Beltway. The office seems a bigger part of the man.
<p>
   That's a thought to keep in mind as the second Clinton term
reveals the tawdry secrets of the first. His popularity is at its
peak in the post-election rush of patriotism (I believe the CBS-New
York Times poll, though it was egregiously wrong about the
election), and this may be a good time to lock in profits on
Clinton stock.
<p>
   The investigations may bear bitter fruit; the economy may not
prop up his ratings forever; decision-making will surely move to
the Hill and then to his putative successor. Just as, in Clinton's
stirring inaugural words, our actions at this moment in our
nation's history will ``define our course and our character,'' so
will his reaction to the process of American justice define his
own.
<p>
   I like to think Bill Clinton will preserve, protect and defend
that process, at whatever personal cost, remembering all that he
represented on Inauguration Day.

<p>
   GREENSBORO, N.C.  &MD;  When two ABC News producers hid cameras in
their deli smocks and went to work at Food Lion supermarkets, they
considered themselves the eyes of the public seeking the inside
story of how the stores prepared meat for sale.
<p>
   They secretly taped employees doctoring allegedly spoiled meat
and, working with ``PrimeTime Live'' anchor Diane Sawyer, compiled
a report that shocked viewers, caused Food Lion's stock to plummet
by $1.7 billion and earned their network some prestigious
journalism awards.
<p>
   But a North Carolina jury Wednesday slapped ABC and its parent
company with more than $5.5 million in punitive damages for having
producers Lynne Dale and Susan Barnett lie on their job
applications to Food Lion.
<p>
   The jury, which labored through five days of deliberations,
finally cast aside ABC's argument that the network was acting in
the public interest, and implicitly endorsed Food Lion's contention
that ``PrimeTime Live'' was an entertainment show, not news,
``juicing the ratings with illegally obtained video,'' according to
Food Lion attorney Tim Barber.
<p>
   The $5.5 million punitive-damage award amounts to less than a
day's earnings for ABC-Capital Cities. But journalism specialists
said the award  &MD;  when combined with the jury's initial ruling that
ABC's reporting methods constituted fraud  &MD;  represents a sharp
rebuke to the news profession.
<p>
   ``I have no doubt news organizations will do fewer undercover
stories and fewer investigations,'' said Sandy Baron, executive
director of the Libel Defense Resource Center. ``In the long run,
the public could be the loser.''
<p>
   Until this case, journalistic pieces were judged by their
accuracy. Food Lion, however, sued ABC on the narrow grounds that
the producers committed fraud by lying to get jobs at Food Lion.
Then, in seeking damages, the supermarket's lawyers inveighed
against what they described as journalism's culture of intrusion,
demanding that ABC be punished for violating Food Lion's privacy.
<p>
   ``They've appointed themselves the ones to judge when to break
the law,'' Barber told the jury. ``Do we want the press to be able
to decide when to break the law?''
<p>
   ABC, for its part, claimed it was acting in a proud journalistic
tradition, dating from Nellie Bly's undercover probe of a mental
hospital in 1888. ABC attorney Bill Jeffress went so far as to say
American journalism ``would not survive'' a high punitive-damage
award, casting the case as a pivotal referendum on the merits of
undercover reporting.
<p>
   Now, with ABC having suffered a multimillion-dollar judgment  &MD; 
the network has said it will appeal  &MD;  media observers are saying
the case, at the least, represents a new benchmark in declining
public regard for the media. But they can only guess at the more
important questions: Will news organizations ever again take the
legal risk of sending reporters undercover? And will the public
really suffer if they don't?
<p>
   Undercover journalism became a force in public life around the
turn of the century, when skepticism about corporate behavior was
rampant.
<p>
   In 1904, when Upton Sinclair posed as a worker in the
slaughterhouses of Chicago and wrote about the fetid conditions
there, he was acclaimed as the voice of average citizens speaking
out against the malefactors of wealth. An admiring President
Theodore Roosevelt dubbed undercover reporters ``muckrakers.''
<p>
   In recent decades, technological advances have spurred a fresh
burst of muckraking, this time on television, with cameras small
enough to be hidden in a reporter's clothing.
<p>
   ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' went on the air in 1989. In its
relatively low-rated first season, the show broadcast two
undercover pieces. Thereafter, it sharply increased the number of
hidden-camera segments, until they averaged more than 20 per
season. ``PrimeTime Live's'' ratings went up.
<p>
   In 1991, Dale, an ABC producer in Atlanta, learned of
allegations that the nation's fastest-growing grocer, Food Lion,
was mishandling meat in its zeal for profits. The allegation had
been made by the United Food and Commercial Workers of America,
which also attacked the non-union Food Lion for paying low wages.
<p>
   The story appealed to both Sawyer and the heads of ABC's
investigative unit. With their approval, Dale and her associate
producer, Barnett, took a crash course in meat handling and applied
for jobs at Food Lion stores. Once inside, they observed employees
allegedly pouring barbeque sauce over spoiled chicken and sniffing
old rice pudding.
<p>
   Their report was, by the standards of television journalism,
worthy of awards. Former employees appeared on camera to make their
allegations. Hidden-camera footage appeared to back up the former
employees. Sawyer even acknowledged the union dispute. Afterwards,
the Labor Department investigated Food Lion and cited the company
for making some employees work unpaid overtime.
<p>
   Food Lion, however, felt it had been the victim of a televised
mugging, in which innocuous practices got blown up into a sizzling
scandal. Such disputes usually result in libel suits, but Food Lion
claimed that ABC committed fraud by sending its producers
undercover and that the producers then violated their obligations
as Food Lion employees by toting hidden cameras.
<p>
   The judge, N. Carlton Tilley, ruled ABC could not use the truth
of the broadcast as a defense. Thus, the network could only argue
that its producers' falsified resumes weren't technically
fraudulent and that they fulfilled their obligations to Food Lion
even as they cast about for evidence of unhealthy conditions.
<p>
   The North Carolina jury ruled in December that ABC was liable
for fraud. It granted the chain $1,402 in compensatory damages,
representing the salaries and training costs of the two producers.
<p>
   ABC maintained that no further damages were warranted; the
network may have been responsible for the producers lying on their
applications, but not for what they found once inside.
<p>
   An ordained minister who doubled as a professor of journalism
ethics testified on behalf of the network. He told the 12-person
jury, which included four blacks and four senior citizens, about
undercover investigations that revealed the evils of the Ku Klux
Klan, racism in hiring, age discrimination, unclean conditions in
nursing homes and insurance scams that targeted the elderly.
<p>
   Sawyer herself made a much-ballyhooed appearance, as reporters
crowded the courtroom and television vans lined up outside. She
insisted that she only approves hidden-camera reports when they
serve the public.
<p>
   But Food Lion rejected the notion that today's television news
magazines advocate for the public  &MD;  ratings are their
preoccupation, its lawyers claimed. And no longer are journalists
representative of average citizens, they said, a fact seemingly
brought home by Sawyer's testifying, with a shrug, that her ABC
salary totals ``more than $7 million.''
<p>
   ``ABC set up a system where everyone involved in the wrongdoing
gets rewarded,'' said Food Lion's Barber, reading off a list of ABC
salaries.
<p>
   Some journalists are casting the jurors' decision as a death
blow to undercover reporting. ``It's insane,'' said Marcia Rock, a
documentary filmmaker and professor of journalism at New York
University. ``Going undercover has been a useful tactic throughout
the history of the profession.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, under the blue lights and mirrors of a Food Lion meat
counter in Greensboro, shoppers expressed cynicism about
corporations and their cousins in big-time journalism and big-time
food sales. ``I think all the stores are basically the same,'' said
Rita Brown of Greensboro. ``They all try to save a dollar where
they can.''
<p>
   As for news magazines, Brown recalled NBC's infamo U.S. staging
of an explosion of a General Motors truck. ``They're out to get an
audience, to get the money,'' she said. ``If they can make a big
splash, they'll do it anyway they can. They're in it for the bucks,
too.''

 &UR; JUNK BONDS: ARGENTINA RAISES $2 BILLION IN GLOBAL BOND MARKETS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Foster, MaryAnn Busso and Beth Williams &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Argentina, a junk-rated
borrower, raised $2 billion in the global bond market amid strong
demand for higher-yielding securities.
<p>
   Argentina found ready buyers for its 20-year bonds. The debt
attracted four times as many bids as bond available, according to
J.P. Morgan Securities and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which arranged the
sale.
<p>
   The brisk demand suggests that investors are confident that
Argentina, a nation that suffered from economic stagnation and
hyperinflation during much of the 1970s and 1980s, will be able to
pay lenders 20 years from now.
<p>
   ``Argentina is clearly an improving credit,'' said Luis Luis,
principal at Scudder Stevens &AMP; Clark, which put in bids for the
sale and manages $2.0 billion of emerging market debt.
<p>
   Argentina is rated ``B1'' by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
``BB-'' by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
<p>
   In coming days, junk-rated companies are gearing up to sell morethan $1.5 billion of new debt. Tenet Healthcare Corp. plans to sell
$1.3 billion of debt in a three-part sale of five-year, eight-year
and 10-year notes.
<p>
   CFP Holdings is planning to sell $110 million of senior
guaranteed notes due in 2004, according to KDP Investment Advisors.
Derlan Industries Ltd. is planning to sell $100 million of senior
notes due in 2004, KDP said.
<p>
   Bonds of companies with high ratings in the junk bond class
should outperform their lower-rated brethren later in 1997,
according to Robert Kricheff, head of high-yield research at Credit
Suisse First Boston Corp.
<p>
   Junk bonds -- issues rated below ``Baa3'' by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. or ``BBB-'' by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. --gained more
than 12 percent in 1996 as investors sought out the juicy yields
they offered when returns on other bonds were slim. Investors were
comfortable owning junk bonds as strengthening corporate profits
resulted in fewer defaults.
<p>
   While that may continue this year, the ``BB''-rated bonds will
probably do best in the second half, Kricheff said.
<p>
   ``Investors should continue to look to enhance yield, but be
wary of a shift to higher-quality in the latter part of the year,''
he said.
<p>
   For instance, companies that in 1993 sold some $7 billion of
bonds without interest payments for the first five years will face
their initial payments on these bonds next year. Preparing for the
payments could put pressure on those with the lowest ratings, and
cause their bonds to lose value relative to benchmark Treasuries.
<p>
   Still, with cash continuing to flow into junk-bond mutual funds,
and with insurance companies and pension funds putting more of
their money into the high-yield market, junk bonds will probably
remain among the best-performing bonds in the first half, Kricheff
said.
<p>
   Strong demand for the high yields offered by junk debt enabled
companies to sell a record $79 billion last year, swelling the junk
bond market to $386.7 billion.
<p>
   Among bonds in the Salomon Brothers indexes, those that pay
interest in cash fell by an average 1 cent per dollar face amount
of bonds; bonds that pay deferred interest rose 3 cents; bonds of
companies in bankruptcy were unchanged.
<p>
   Bonds that pay cash interest rose to 224.94, up from 224.14 at
the beginning of the year. Deferred interest bonds rose to 228.30,
up from 225.79 at the beginning of the year. Bonds of bankrupt
companies were at 201.88, up from 201.71 at the beginning of the
year.

    &UR; PARTY LEADERS RESISTS CLINTON'S FUND-RAISING REFORMS
<p>
    &UR; By ANDREW MOLLISON &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  President Clinton's new voluntary restraints on
fund-raising by the White House and the Democratic National
Committee may not make a deep dent in Washington's campaign money
culture.
<p>
   In addition to promising stricter screening of donors allowed to
attend ``small'' meetings with the president and vice president,
Clinton's voluntary plan to avoid embarrassing campaign abuses
contained three major elements:
<p>
   -- A cap of $100,000 per year on gifts to the DNC from any
donor.
<p>
   -- A ban on gifts from foreign-owned companies and their U.S.
subsidiaries.
<p>
   -- A ban on gifts from non-citizens, even those who are legal,
permanent U.S. residents.
<p>
   Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic Governors
Association, said his group also plans to abide by the DNC
guidelines.
<p>
   Democratic staffers at two of the party's other big
Washington-based committees said that while the guidelines are
likely to be adopted, they are still being reviewed at the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
<p>
   Yet, even if all three end up adopting the DNC guidelines,
loopholes in the plan would still let a single company, its chief
executive officer and the CEO's spouse give more than $1 million a
year to the Democratic party, said Kent Cooper, executive director
of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
<p>
   For example, the three donors could each give $100,000 a year to
each of the four Washington-based party committees without
violating the guidelines, Cooper said.
<p>
   ``That's just one of a variety of ways you can split money up,
and wind up giving just as much money as you ever did before there
was a $100,000 cap,'' Cooper said. Giving money directly to one of
the 50 state parties is another way around such limits, he said.
<p>
   Nor will it be easy to distinguish between foreign-owned and
U.S.-owned companies in a global economy, Cooper said.
<p>
   ``The plan may at least be praised as an admission by the White
House and the Democrats that there is a negative publicity value to
accepting large contributions (that) are mind-boggling to the
average person, and are tied to access to the White House and to
Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress and the party,''
Cooper said.
<p>
   ``I don't think Republicans have yet made that initial
concession yet,'' Cooper said, ``but as they go into the Senate
hearings this winter, I think they are going to see the negatives
themselves.''
<p>
   Republicans ranged from scornful to indifferent as they turned
down the president's suggestion that the Republicans join the
Democrats in agreeing to go even further and stop taking any ``soft
money'' gifts from corporate or union treasuries.
<p>
   ``We don't have a problem to solve, since we take only legal
contributions,'' said spokesman Rich Galen of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``The Democrats have to alter
their way of doing things because they did take illegal

<p>
   East Rutherford, New Jersey, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The New York
Giants signed former University of Nebraska defensive tackle
Christian Peter, giving the troubled former New England Patriots
draft pick a second chance in the NFL.
<p>
   Peter, a 6-foot-3, 304-pounder, was released by New England
three days after the team made him a fifth-round pick in the April
draft, claiming they didn't ``have complete information regarding''
Peter's legal problems while at Nebraska. New England said the
behavior was ``incompatible with our organization's standards of
acceptable conduct.'' Peter was given a 10-day jail sentence in
August and fined $300 for disturbing the peace, and pleaded guilty
in May 1994 to third-degree assault of a former Miss Nebraska,
which resulted in 18 months of probation.
<p>
   In addition, Peter has been arrested for trespassing, public
urination, refusing to comply with the order of a policeman and
third-degree assault for threatening to kill a parking attendant.
<p>
   The Giants, who have been interested in signing Peter since he
was released by the Patriots, said he has put his troubles behind
him.
<p>
   ``We're very pleased that Christian has lived up to the program
that we established in order for us to sign him,'' said Giants
General Manager George Young. ``We feel after giving up a season of
pro football that he understands his situation and will correct the
errors that he made in the past.''
<p>
   The Newark, New Jersey, Star-Ledger reported that Peter has been
going to a rehabilitation program since meeting with Giants'
officials in May.
<p>
   ``I have worked very hard at dealing with the issues in my
life,'' Peter said. ``Those issues are something that I will have
to manage every day for the rest of my life. I understand that, and
I am grateful for the opportunity.''
<p>
   Peter, a native of Locust, New Jersey, was New England's second
pick in the fifth round of the draft after finishing his senior
season with 46 tackles, including 12 solo, and two sacks.
<p>
   Terms of the contract weren't disclosed.

    &UR; PARTY LEADERS RESISTS CLINTON'S FUND-RAISING REFORMS
<p>
    &UR; By ANDREW MOLLISON &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  President Clinton's new voluntary restraints on
fund-raising by the White House and the Democratic National
Committee may not make a deep dent in Washington's campaign money
culture.
<p>
   In addition to promising stricter screening of donors allowed to
attend ``small'' meetings with the president and vice president,
Clinton's voluntary plan to avoid embarrassing campaign abuses
contained three major elements:
<p>
   -- A cap of $100,000 per year on gifts to the DNC from any
donor.
<p>
   -- A ban on gifts from foreign-owned companies and their U.S.
subsidiaries.
<p>
   -- A ban on gifts from non-citizens, even those who are legal,
permanent U.S. residents.
<p>
   Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic Governors
Association, said his group also plans to abide by the DNC
guidelines.
<p>
   Democratic staffers at two of the party's other big
Washington-based committees said that while the guidelines are
likely to be adopted, they are still being reviewed at the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
<p>
   Yet, even if all three end up adopting the DNC guidelines,
loopholes in the plan would still let a single company, its chief
executive officer and the CEO's spouse give more than $1 million a
year to the Democratic party, said Kent Cooper, executive director
of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
<p>
   For example, the three donors could each give $100,000 a year to
each of the four Washington-based party committees without
violating the guidelines, Cooper said.
<p>
   ``That's just one of a variety of ways you can split money up,
and wind up giving just as much money as you ever did before there
was a $100,000 cap,'' Cooper said. Giving money directly to one of
the 50 state parties is another way around such limits, he said.
<p>
   Nor will it be easy to distinguish between foreign-owned and
U.S.-owned companies in a global economy, Cooper said.
<p>
   ``The plan may at least be praised as an admission by the White
House and the Democrats that there is a negative publicity value to
accepting large contributions (that) are mind-boggling to the
average person, and are tied to access to the White House and to
Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress and the party,''
Cooper said.
<p>
   ``I don't think Republicans have yet made that initial
concession yet,'' Cooper said, ``but as they go into the Senate
hearings this winter, I think they are going to see the negatives
themselves.''
<p>
   Republicans ranged from scornful to indifferent as they turned
down the president's suggestion that the Republicans join the
Democrats in agreeing to go even further and stop taking any ``soft
money'' gifts from corporate or union treasuries.
<p>
   ``We don't have a problem to solve, since we take only legal
contributions,'' said spokesman Rich Galen of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``The Democrats have to alter
their way of doing things because they did take illegal
contributions.''
<p>
   At the National Senate Republican Committee, spokesman Michael
Marr(CQ) dismissed Clinton's plan as ``a gimmick'' designed to
distract the public from the failure of Democrats to abide by
current laws.
<p>
   ``We also think President Clinton is acting in a duplicitous
fashion when he favors limits on soft-money contributions'' but
continues to benefit from dues money spent independently by unions,
Marr said.

   The Republican National Committee will rely on recommendations

said.

follow the lead of the RNC, rather than the DNC.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   NORTHBROOK, Ill.  &MD;  In a push for higher goals in education,
President Clinton called on schools Wednesday to take part in
national standards testing and blasted those who ``hide behind''
the cloak of local control to avoid participating.
<p>
   ``It's selling our kids down the drain, and it's wrong,''
Clinton told hundreds of parents and students gathered at the
Glenbrook North High School gymnasium here. He praised Chicago-area
students, because they participated in recent international math
and science tests.
<p>
   The president chose education as his theme for the first trip of
his second term, an indication, aides said, of the emphasis he will
place on the issue during the next four years and an example of how
he intends to use the ``bully pulpit'' of the presidency.
<p>
   ``To pretend that somehow holding ourselves to these standards
and agreeing that there has to be some uniform way of measuring
them is giving up of local control is just an excuse to avoid being
held accountable, because we're afraid we can't make it,'' Clinton
said.
<p>
   He sharply challenged political and ideological opponents of
national standards and federal assistance in education.
<p>
   ``We can no longer hide behind our love of local control of the
schools and use that as an excuse not to hold ourselves to high
standards. It has nothing to do with local control,'' Clinton said.
``There's no school board in America that controls the content of
algebra.''
<p>
   Clinton said he knows there is resistance to the acceptance of
national standards and national testing. But, he said, it is the
only way students in the United States can be measured against
foreign students and the only way Americans will know if the goal
of excellence has been achieved.
<p>
   ``I have heard all the arguments in the world against this. But
no one has yet made a compelling case to me for how calculus is
different in Chicago from Little Rock, Arkansas., or Cody, Wyoming,
or, for that matter, Germany or Singapore or any other place in the
world,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   Clinton came here to pat the backs of students at Glenbrook
North and in 19 Chicago-area school districts who participated as a
group in the Third International Math and Science Study. The TIMSS
was administered to sample groups of students in 41 countries. The
Chicago-area students participated to test their achievement.
<p>
   The ``First in the World Consortium,'' as the American group
called itself, scored among the top countries in science and in the
second tier in math. Numerous international studies show U.S.
students compare poorly to their foreign counterparts.
<p>
   ``Those who believe there is no role for federal government in
education are simply wrong,'' said West Northfield school
superintendent Paul Kimmelman, whose students participated in
TIMSS. ``There has not been interference, only help and
assistance.''
<p>
   The White House announced that Clinton would seek in his new
budget a 26 percent increase in funding for Goals 2000, the
national education standards project, and nearly a 50 percent
increase for charter schools, which bypass many regulations to set
their own standards.
<p>
   Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to eliminate the
Goals 2000 program, maintaining the federal government should not
get involved in a local control issue such as public schools.
<p>
   The president also toured a science class at Stanley Field
Middle School and met in Chicago with Mayor Richard Daley and the
Chicago school board.
<p>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the trek to Illinois is
emblematic of how Clinton will spend his second term.
<p>
   ``We won't be oriented all the time on just what is happening in
Congress or what is happening on legislation. You can tell today
this has got very little to do with action by the federal
government or by the Congress,'' McCurry said.

<p>
   Tempe, Arizona, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Arizona Cardinals
named former assistant Dick Jamieson offensive coordinator,
replacing Jim Fassel.
<p>
   Fassel was named head coach of the New York Giants on Jan. 15.
<p>
   Jamieson, who spent the past two seasons as running backs coach
for the Philadelphia Eagles, was an assistant with the Cardinals
from 1980-85.
<p>
   He saw his first tour of duty with the Cardinals on former head
coach Jim Hanifan's staff in 1980 as running backs coach, then was
elevated to offensive coordinator in 1985.
<p>
   After six seasons with the Cardinals, Jamieson spent the next
two campaigns as running backs coach with the Houston Oilers
(1986-87). He then served as assistant head coach and offensive
coordinator at Northwestern University (1990-91), and as running
backs coach at Rutgers University (1992-94) before his two seasons
in Philadelphia.
<p>
   Jamieson first crossed coaching paths with current Cardinals
head coach Vince Tobin while on the University of Missouri's staff
from 1972-77. Jamieson was the school's offensive coordinator while
Tobin served as defensive coordinator.
<p>
   After leaving Missouri, Jamieson had an 11-11 record as the head
coach at Indiana State from 1978-79.

<p>
   Bradlees Inc. said Wednesday it will eliminate 105 jobs at its
Braintree, Mass. headquarters and close a store in New York as part
of a new plan to get the discount department store chain out of
bankruptcy protection.
<p>
   The announcement represents ``the first of several steps we plan
to implement to restore the company to profitability,'' said
Bradlees' chairman Peter Thorner.
<p>
   Bradlees employs roughly 13,000 workers and has eliminated 3,000
jobs since filing for bankruptcy in June 1995. The closing of the
Long Island store will bring Bradlees' store total to 109.
Wednesday, Thorner insisted there will be no further major store
closings or massive layoffs.
<p>
   Thorner spoke a day after a US Bankruptcy Court granted Bradlees
a six-month extension of its time to file a reorganization plan and
shortly after Bradlees renegotiated its lending agreement following
disappointing holiday sales.
<p>
   Nevertheless, Thorner remains upbeat.
<p>
   ``I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``I think we have a lot of
opportunities.''
<p>
   Thorner was promoted to the top job on Christmas Eve when the
board of directors forced the resignation of Mark A. Cohen, who had
come to Bradlees two years earlier.
<p>
   With a department store background, Cohen had upgraded the
merchandise and stocked shelves with more clothing. The plan was to
reposition Bradlees as a sort of retail halfway house between
discounters such as Wal-Mart and department stores such as Macy's.
<p>
   But Thorner said Cohen's strategy resulted in pricing policies
that often made Bradlees nearly as expensive as department stores.
To woo back regulars, Bradlees is reducing prices by ``a notch or
two'' and scaling back promotions, Thorner said.
<p>
   Under Cohen, Bradees became too dependent on one-day promotions,
Thorner said, and customers got into the habit of buying items only
when on sale. Bradlees will now focus on every-day pricing that
offers ``tremendous value,'' he said.
<p>
   New York retail analyst Walter Loeb saw another problem: Cohen
did not execute his strategy uniformly throughout the entire chain.
Some stores were buffed up and stocked with ``fancy'' merchandise,
but others were not, Loeb said.
<p>
   As Cohen upgraded merchandise, he also squabbled with Bradlees'
creditors, a source said. Thorner was promoted partly because of
his success in dealing with creditors when he was a member of a
team that led Ames Department Stores Inc. out of bankruptcy in the
early '90s, the source said.
<p>
   Thorner ``has a certain amount of credibility in the industry
for taking Ames out of bankruptcy,'' noted Terrence McCrary, an
analyst with Auerbach Pollak &AMP; Richardson, who follows Ames.
<p>
   If Cohen is a ``merchant,'' Thorner is an administrator with a
reputation for cutting costs and improving margins, Loeb said. With
a new strategy that puts more emphasis on Bradlees' ``traditional
discount roots,'' Thorner ``has the ability to turn Bradlees
around,'' he said.
<p>
   Still, observers see it as an uphill battle. Some suggest there
are simply too many stores and too few customers in the Northeast
to support a $1.78 billion regional discount chain such as Bradlees
in the face of national juggernaut Wal-Mart.
<p>
   And according to papers filed in Bankruptcy Court, Bradlees lost
$5 million on sales of $155.6 million for the four weeks ended Nov.
30, Bloomberg News reported.
<p>
   ``The big W is not going away,'' said Loeb. ``This is a fight
for survival.''

<p>
   Arlington, Texas, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Texas Rangers
signed catcher Scott Hemond and pitcher Kevin Lomon to minor league
contracts.
<p>
   Hemond, who was invited to spring training as a non-roster
player, has a .217 career average with 12 homers and 58 runs batted
in during seven major league seasons with the Oakland Athletics,
the Chicago White Sox and St. Louis Cardinals.
<p>
   The 31-year-old Hemond has also played in the outfield and at
all four infield positions during his career. He played last season
at the Cardinals' Triple-A affiliate in Louisville, batting .260
with three homers and 15 RBI in 50 games.
<p>
   Lomon, 25, pitched six games in relief for the Atlanta Braves in
September after going 9-8 with a 4.33 earned run average at
Triple-A Richmond. He had a 4.91 ERA with Atlanta.
<p>
   Lomon made his major league debut in 1995 when he was on the New
York Mets opening day roster and went 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA in six
relief appearances.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Inflation remained subdued despite continued
``moderate'' growth of the economy, the Federal Reserve's periodic
survey of business conditions in all geographic areas showed
Wednesday.
<p>
   The findings, which were presaged Tuesday by comments of Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, were a further indication that the central
bank was likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its policy
meeting in early February.
<p>
   ``District reports provided scattered evidence of increasing
wage pressures, particularly for skilled workers, but in general
did not indicate significant price pressures other than for energy
items,'' the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said,
summarizing the report's findings, which included responses through
the second week of January.
<p>
   The survey, known as the beige book, is a compilation of
anecdotes and research from regional Fed banks that is put together
to help top Fed officials set policy.
<p>
   Employers in the Chicago and Richmond districts appeared to have
the most trouble filling jobs and were being forced to raise pay
accordingly.
<p>
   In the New York district, which includes the entire state plus
northern New Jersey and a small piece of Connecticut, the overall
economy ``has a slightly firmer tone'' than in the preceding
survey, on Dec. 4. Holiday retail sales in the district were among
the best in the nation.
<p>
   Among districts that quantified holiday retail sales, New York
posted growth of 4 to 8 percent compared with 1995 levels, while
sales in Philadelphia rose 5 percent, sales in St. Louis 7 percent
and in Minneapolis zero to 2 percent, the Fed survey reported.
<p>
   It also cited a separate poll of small retailers across New York
state that showed a gain, before inflation, of 4 to 6 percent for
same-store sales, ``with the strongest reports coming from
Manhattan.''
<p>
   Women's and children's apparel and jewelry were the strongest
categories, confirming other appraisals, while electronics and
other big-ticket durable items were generally weak.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The survey also cited the New York district, along with Chicago,
as having a ``firming'' of residential real estate prices.
<p>
   Real estate prices advanced 2 to 5 percent during the fourth
quarter, according to real estate agents in New York and New
Jersey, and the tight New York City-area apartment market seems to
have prompted a pickup in construction of new buildings.
<p>
   The pace of permits issued for new apartments more than doubled
that of any of the preceding five years, with the bulk of the
increase coming in the second half of 1996, the Fed's survey said.
Commercial construction was also stronger in the New York district.
<p>
   In a separate government report Wednesday, the Commerce
Department said builders broke ground on single-family homes and
apartment buildings at an annual pace of 1,329,000 in December, a
decline of 12.2 percent from November.
<p>
   Although this decline was about triple the consensus estimate,
analysts cautioned that the seasonal adjustment process was
especially unreliable during the winter months. For all of 1996,
starts climbed 8.8 percent to 1,473,700, the highest total in eight
years.
<p>
   The Fed's survey of its 12 districts, conducted as part of its
preparation for a meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on
Feb. 4 and Feb. 5, said that, ``Economic growth in December and
early January was moderate in most parts of the country.''
<p>
   The survey also showed that factory activity expanded or held
steady in most areas of the country. Producers of steel and other
metals as well as machine tools, construction materials and capital
equipment registered the biggest gains.
<p>
   Wage pressure was most visible in the bidding for skilled
factory, administrative and technical workers, especially computer
technicians, the Fed reported. ``Signs of increasing wage
pressures'' were reported in Chicago and Richmond characterized
these as ``more evident.'' The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Atlanta, St. Louis and San Francisco districts also noted worker
shortages.
<p>
   The job market in Spartanburg, S.C., is so tight, the Richmond
Fed said, that offers of higher pay for temporary employees were
starting to draw workers from low-paying permanent jobs.
<p>
   The Fed mistakenly posted Wednesday's survey on the Internet
nearly two hours before its new official release time of 2 p.m. Bob
Moore, a Fed aide, said, ``We broke our own embargo'' but added
that officials did not yet know whether the error was related to
the fact that until now the beige book was published at noon.
<p>
   Economic announcements such as this one often move the stock and
bond markets, so the releases are carefully timed to prevent some
traders from getting unfair advantages from advance knowledge of
the data. Moore said the Fed had received no complaints from
traders about the early release of the beige book report.
<p>
   The Commerce Department's report also showed that the slump in
new house and apartment construction was most striking in the West,
where starts tumbled 29.2 percent. The Midwest and South declined
7.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, while the Northeast
edged down negligibly but from a pace far below that of any other
region.
<p>
   Permits for new homes moved lower by less than 1 percent, to an
annual pace of 1,410,000, the Commerce Department's report also
showed.
<p>
   Shipment of mobile homes, for which figures lag a month, eased
4.1 percent in November to a rate of 354,000.

<p>
   Washington, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Clinton administration
proposal to reduce future Medicare spending relies on a $46 billion
cut in payments to health maintenance organizations over six years
for one third of its savings.
<p>
   HMO stocks, which plunged across the board last week in
anticipation of the administration's curbs on HMO payments, were
mostly lower today.
<p>
   The cuts pose a threat to the business of big Medicare HMOS,
including PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., United Healthcare Corp.,
Oxford Health Plans Inc., and Humana Inc. -- whose shares closed
lower today -- as well as Health Systems International Inc., Aetna
Inc. and others.
<p>
   HMO industry lobbyists said the Clinton proposal could cause
health plans to cut benefits to the elderly. They suggested that
possibility could prompt seniors from big states such as California
and Florida to apply political pressure to scale back the cuts when
the legislation reaches the Republican-led Congress.
<p>
   ``Republicans and the administration have got to know that some
key political areas in (the next) election are areas that would
have payments cut the most,'' said Roy Ramthun, lobbyist for Humana
Inc., the Louisville, Kentucky-based HMO.
<p>
   Shares in PacifiCare, which garners 60 percent of its revenue
from Medicare, closed down 1 1/8 at 76 1/4 on trading of 814,000
shares, compared to three-month average daily trading volume of
456,000 shares.
<p>
   Shares of Oxford closed down 1 at 52 3/8 and United Healthcare
stock finished down 1 at 44 1/4. Humana shares closed down 1/8 at
18 1/4, while Health Systems finished up 1/4 at 25 1/8 and Aetna
was up 1 at 75 7/8.
<p>
   The proposed Medicare HMO cuts may have already been built into
the value of the stocks, which fell last week after word first
leaked that the administration was considering deep cuts.
<p>
   ``You saw HMO stocks take it on the chin at the beginning of
last week,'' said Robert Mains, health industry analyst with Advest
Inc. ``It's built in to some degree, (but) there might be a little
more bloodletting.''
<p>
   In addition, while Republicans and the administration agree that
Medicare is overpaying HMOs and possibly losing the government
money, both sides are hoping HMOs and other insurers will
ultimately play a major role in holding down the program's rising
costs. In fact, the administration included in its Medicare savings
plan a proposal to open Medicare up to more types of managed-care
health plans.
<p>
   ``It doesn't do you much good to run them (the HMOs) out of
business, because then there is no one to manage the care,'' said
John Runningen, analyst with Robinson-Humphrey.
<p>
   Mains also said he is ``skeptical'' that the level of cuts under
consideration will actually be enacted if the Republican-led
Congress and the administration agree on a balanced-budget plan
later this year.
<p>
   ``If managed care is to be one of the ways that Medicare costs
come under control, onerous cuts would strangle the goose that laid
the golden egg pretty quickly,'' he said.
<p>
   Ramthun said that Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala has tried to calm HMO executives by describing the proposal
as a ``first offer.''
<p>
   Nonetheless, HMOs reacted angrily to the proposal yesterday,
saying health plans may drop out of the Medicare program altogether
if their future payments are cut too deeply.
<p>
   ``The effect of this proposal will be to leave many people with
fewer benefits, larger out-of-pocket costs and perhaps fewer health
plans from which to choose,'' said Don White, spokesman for the
American Association of Health Plans, the nation's largest trade
group for HMOs and other managed-care plans.
<p>
   The administration defended its proposal today. Bruce Vladeck,
the Clinton appointee who runs Medicare, said the Medicare
managed-care program will continue to grow if the administration's
plan is implemented.
<p>
   He noted that Medicare boosted its national payment rates to
HMOs by a total of 16 percent over the last two years while these
same health plans negotiated commercial payment increases in the
low single digits.
<p>
   If the administration's proposed cuts in Medicare HMO payments
are enacted, Vladeck said, senior citizen HMO enrollment will still
continue to grow, although possibly not at the current rate of
80,000 members a month.
<p>
   ``There's still plenty of room in there for new plans to come
into the program and for people to continue to enroll,'' Vladeck
said.
<p>
   Studies show that the government is losing money on Medicare
managed care. ``We see this as a way of eliminating overpayment,''
Vladeck said.
<p>
   The Medicare HMO cuts are part of the Clinton plan presented
yesterday to cut $138 billion in future Medicare spending over six
years to help improve the financial condition of the health
insurance program for the elderly and wipe out federal budget
deficits.
<p>
   The administration has also proposed spending about $9 billion
over six years to add new Medicare benefits. They include new
preventive care coverage such as colorectal cancer screening and
annual mammograms; and up to one week annually of temporary help
for spouses and other family members caring for someone with
Alzheimer's disease.
<p>
   The Medicare HMO cuts are the largest item in the Medicare
proposal. In one concession to the industry, the administration
said it will delay about $8 billion of the $46 billion in proposed
Medicare HMO cuts until the years 2000 through 2003.
<p>
   Those cuts would come from reducing the Medicare HMO base
payment to 90 percent of the cost of senior citizen fee-for-service
care from the current rate of 95 percent. Some HMO lobbyist had
worried the administration would cut the base payment below 90
percent.
<p>
   Other managed-care savings would be achieved by removing from
the Medicare HMO payment rate money that is supposed to be passed
on to hospitals that provide graduate medical education and care to
the poor.
<p>
   That would especially hurt health plans such as Oxford that do
much business in areas where there is a heavy concentration of
teaching hospitals.
<p>
   Hospitals complain that HMOs don't always pass along the
teaching hospital money built into their payments. Today, the
administration said it would set up a six-year $14-billion fund to
compensate teaching hospitals.
<p>
   The administration and Republican lawmakers also want to raise
Medicare HMO rates in low-cost rural areas to make it attractive
for health plans to do business there. Vladeck said 25 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries live in areas where they have no access to
managed care health plans.
<p>
   The money for rural areas will come from squeezing money from
above average HMO payments rates in cities such New York City and
Miami.
<p>
   ``If you're in a (high paying) urban area, it's going to be
triple whammy,'' said Mains.

 &UR; GOP DENIES RECEIVING ILLEGAL FOREIGN MONEY &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  One day after President Clinton charged that
Republicans ``raise more foreign money'' than Democrats, White
House officials said Wednesday they could not yet provide
documentation to support Clinton's claim.
<p>
   Republican officials reacted angrily to Clinton's charge, saying
the Republican National Committee had not collected any ``illegal''
foreign money. RNC officials also noted that the Democratic
National Committee has returned $1.5 million, much of it from
foreign sources, because of questions about the legality of the
contributions.
<p>
   White House special counsel Lanny Davis said in an interview
that he could not provide documentation to support Clinton's claim,
but also said a study is under way to determine the extent of
foreign contributions to both parties.
<p>
   ``An effort is underway to determine the total foreign
corporation-based contributions to the Republican Party as well as
the Democratic Party,'' Davis said.
<p>
   Davis noted that Common Cause, the self-styled citizen's lobby,
last year produced a report that said Republicans got more money
from American subsidiaries of foreign corporations than Democrats.
<p>
   But Davis acknowledged the study is incomplete because it looked
only at 16 companies that gave the largest donations to the two
parties. The study did not, for example, look at donations
associated with the Indonesia-based Lippo Group, or a $250,000
contribution to the Democratic Party from a South Korean company
that was later returned.
<p>
   The latest inter-party fingerpointing began when Clinton, in
seeking bipartisan support for a campaign finance reform bill,
lashed out at Republicans. ``They raise more money, they raise more
foreign money, they raise more money in big contributions, and we
take all the heat,'' Clinton charged. ``It's a free ride.''
<p>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who on Tuesday termed
Clinton's charge ``crap,'' issued a warning to both parties. He
said that Republicans and Democrats alike committed fundraising
mistakes that will come to light in congressional hearings
scheduled to start in March.
<p>
   ``We will find out there were transgressions both ethically and
legally on the Republican side'' as well as among Democrats, McCain
said in an interview.
<p>
   DNC spokeswoman Amy Weiss Tobe, meanwhile, said Republicans were
not being truthful when they said they had not returned any foreign
donations. She said the GOP returned a $15,000 donation from a
Canadian in recent months. Asked how that compared to the $1.5
million returned by Democrats, she responded that more improper GOP
donations would be uncovered if ``if the press held them under the
same scrutiny'' as Democrats.
<p>
   Clinton's effort to turn the tables on the GOP is not new.
During the presidential campaign, Clinton tried to counter
questions about alleged improprieties in Democratic fundraising
with a hard-hitting ad. It said, in part: ``Dole and the
Republicans took $2.4 million from foreign interests. Foreign oil,
foreign tobacco, foreign drug companies.'' The Clinton campaign
said the contributions came from U.S. subsidiaries of 16
foreign-companies, including British Petroleum and Brown &AMP;
Williamson  &MD;  both British corporations.
<p>
   To be sure, Republicans have had their share of fundraising
controversies. For example:
<p>
   Massachusetts millionaire Simon C. Fireman and his company,
Aqua-Leisure Industries of Avon, last year were ordered by a
federal court to pay a $6 million fine for making illegal
donations, including $69,000 to the Dole campaign. No similar fine
has been assessed against Democratic contributors.
<p>
   Cuban-born sugar magnate Jose Fanjul was appointed by Dole to be
vice-chairman of Dole's presidential campaign finance committee
even though Fanjul was not a U.S. citizen. Fanjul was a major donor
to the Republican Party and the Dole campaign and he stood to
benefit from Dole's action on sugar policy. Fanjul's donations were
legal because he has U.S. residency status.
<p>
   Still, Clinton's charge that Republicans raised more foreign
money has not been substantiated. There is no simple way to say how
much ``foreign'' money has been raised by either party because
there is no agreement on what constitutes foreign money. While it
is illegal for a foreign citizen or foreign corporation to give
money to the parties, it is legal for a temporary U.S. resident or
a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign company to donate.
<p>
   Clinton appears to have lumped the illegal and legal categories
together, while Republicans say the issue should be which party
raised illegal money.
<p>
   Much of the $1.5 million in returned Democratic contributions
was given back because of questions about whether the funds, mostly
from temporary residents or subsidiaries of foreign companies,
originated from foreign sources which are barred from giving.

<p>
   ST. LOUIS  &MD;  For 40 years, Enterprise Rent-a-Car Inc. has gone
against all the conventional industry wisdom. Not only has it ceded
the bread-and-butter airport business to Hertz, Avis and other
national competitors, but it has also done without celebrity-driven
advertisements and catchy slogans.
<p>
   Yet while Hertz Corp. and the others got the higher profiles,
the St. Louis-based Enterprise has become the industry's giant.
<p>
   Sticking close to the niche it developed  &MD;  providing rentals for
customers whose cars are being repaired or who need an extra car  &MD; 
Enterprise is No. 1 in fleet size and locations. And though it
trails Hertz in revenues ($3.1 billion versus $3.8 billion in
1996), its estimated $500 million in pretax earnings probably make
it No. 1 in profits, too. (Hertz, a unit of the Ford Motor Co.,
does not disclose earnings.)
<p>
   ``Enterprise's track record is astonishing,'' said Jon LeSage,
editor of Auto Rental News, a trade publication based in Redondo
Beach, Calif. ``They have very quietly and humbly built an
empire.''
<p>
   Now, as the $16.5 billion industry reorganizes in the wake of a
six-month spate of acquisition deals, the question is whether
Enterprise and its owners, the founding Taylor family, can keep
that empire, and all those profits, largely to themselves.
<p>
   Auto manufacturers, stuck with hefty write-offs or paltry
profits from their rental car subsidiaries, are beating a hasty
retreat from the overcrowded business, which no longer is needed,
as it was during the recession, as a captive market for new cars.
In the last six months, four of the biggest rental car companies
have changed hands, or are about to. Two others are for sale, and
Hertz itself may be heading for the block as well.
<p>
   The changing of the guard ushers in two wily financial
chieftains  &MD;  H. Wayne Huizenga, the founder of Blockbuster Video,
and Henry Silverman, head of HFS Inc., the world's largest
franchiser of hotels and real estate offices  &MD;  who promise to bring
a new aggressiveness to the business. Huizenga's Republic
Industries owns Alamo Rent-a-Car and is in the process of buying
National Car Rental; HFS owns Avis Rent a Car.
<p>
   Characteristically, the Taylors say they will continue to go
against the grain, keeping Enterprise in the family and out of the
airports. And, they say, they are more than capable of fending off
the inevitable assault on their profitable terrain.
<p>
   ``I am watching this frenzy with fascination, but I am sitting
on the sidelines,'' said Andrew Taylor, Enterprise's chief
executive and son of the company's founder and chairman, Jack
Taylor. ``Everybody wants to throw us in the same pot with the
other rental car companies, but our businesses are different. We
have no plans to be in the airports. We're sticking to our niche.''
<p>
   And why not? Enterprise dominates the replacement niche, also
known as the home-city rental business, with more than 70 percent
of the market, according to a report prepared by Jordan Hymowitz,
an industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
<p>
   ``Not only is Enterprise profitable, but it is in the
fastest-growing and least competitive rental car niche,'' the
report said. ``An industry adage states there are two types of
rental car companies: those that lose money and Enterprise.''
<p>
   But if Andrew Taylor is not going after the ``Airport Seven,''
as he calls them, he concedes that they are beginning to invade his
turf.
<p>
   ``They're coming after us,'' he said, ``no question.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Already, Hertz is revamping its replacement division, dubbed
HIRE (for Hertz Insurance Replacement Entity), and Alamo is
considering a similar division.
<p>
   ``Whenever you have one player in a market segment, there is
room for competitors,'' said Joseph Russo, Hertz vice president for
public affairs.
<p>
   Andrew Taylor responded with typical competitive fervor: ``Our
delivery network is tough to compete against. Our ability to move
people and resources around the organization is pretty awesome. It
will be interesting to see who gets that growth in market share.''
<p>
   Enterprise is a maverick in a lot of ways that have paid off and
will be hard to match. Simply by locating its 3,100 branches away
from airports, it reduces overhead significantly by cutting out
high concession fees. It saves more by handling its own
reservations, avoiding 10 percent travel agent commissions and a
separate 3 percent fee that other rental car companies pay to use a
shared reservation system. And it employs a highly sophisticated
computer network to track the whereabouts and service history of
each of its 315,100 cars, keeping inventory lean and cars on the
road an average of six months longer than Hertz and Avis do. At the
same time, the company is known for its extra level of service: it
often delivers cars to customers' homes or takes customers to the
cars.

   The new market picture will become clearer in the next year, as
the industry adjusts to all the ownership changes. HFS touched off
the flurry of deals last July, when it bought Avis from its
employees and the General Motors Corporation for $800 million. In
the past few weeks alone, the following deals or related events
have transpired:
<p>
    &MD;  Team Rental Group Inc. said it was acquiring the Budget Rent a
Car Co. from Ford for $350 million. Team Rental is the largest
Budget franchisee.
<p>
    &MD;  Republic Industries announced its intention to buy National
from GM for $600 million, on the heels of its purchase of Alamo
from Michael Egan, a rental car executive who owned 94 percent of
Alamo, for $625 million.
<p>
    &MD;  The Chrysler Corp. put its Dollar Rent-a-Car and Thrifty Car
Rental divisions on the block.
<p>
    &MD;  Ford said it was exploring possibilities for Hertz, including
an initial public offering and a spinoff.
<p>
   ``I've never seen anything like this frenzy of activity around
the rental car business,'' said Neil Abrams, a Purchase, N.Y., auto
rental industry consultant. ``What is remarkable about Enterprise
is that it is the only major player in the industry that has had no
changes in ownership or top management in the past four years.''
<p>
   The rental car companies that had been owned by the car makers
relied heavily on manufacturer subsidies for what little
profitability they had.
<p>
   With the recent deals, financial managers have taken over the
show. Huizenga will use National and Alamo as a ``used car
factory'' of sorts, according to the Montgomery Securities report.
Both will supply cars for Republic's budding Auto Nation USA chain,
which sells late-model used cars.
<p>
   Silverman of HFS also hopes to benefit from having complementary
businesses. With such well-known chains as Century 21, Coldwell
Banker, Days Inn, ERA, Howard Johnson, Ramada (U.S.), Super 8 and
Travelodge, HFS operates a vast reservation system with endless
opportunities to promote Avis rentals.
<p>
   The increased emphasis on profitability is unlikely, however, to
result in consumers paying more for rentals, experts say, because
the industry is too fee-competitive. ``We are not optimistic about
seeing even modest price increases in the near future,'' Hymowitz,
the analyst, wrote.
<p>
   As the dust settles, Andrew Taylor remains bullish about
Enterprise's prospects, estimating revenues will jump to $6 billion
by 2001.
<p>
   The company will grow, he said, by opening more branches across
the United States and especially abroad. With 150 branches in
Canada and Britain, Enterprise is preparing to venture into western
Europe next, beginning in Germany.
<p>
   Enterprise also wants to amass local and regional players in the
replacement rental market. Last year, it bought Standard
Rent-a-Car, a Sacramento, Calif., company, and Agency Rent-a-Car, a
replacement division of Avis spun off by HFS. Enterprise closed
Agency's branches shortly after the purchase.
<p>
   As ambitious as Enterprise's plans are, Andrew Taylor is quick
to point out, ``we don't have to grow.'' At least not in light of
the estimates that place its profits at the $500 million level,
according to LeSage of Auto Rental News.
<p>
   Enterprise's secret profitability weapon, LeSage said, is its
management of fleet costs, which account for nearly half of all
rental car operating expenses.
<p>
   While the business and leisure rental car companies have relied
on manufacturer subsidies and buybacks, ``nobody is better than
Enterprise at negotiating prices to buy and sell cars,'' LeSage
said. Enterprise sells its cars at 30 retail lots it owns around
the country, in a fashion nearly identical to Huizenga's
much-heralded chain.
<p>
   Though Enterprise has grown most quickly in the past 15 years,
it has long benefited from innovative strategies. Jack Taylor, a
World War II fighter pilot aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise (hence the
company name), left his job as a Cadillac salesman in 1957 to
effectively invent the concept of auto leasing with his first
venture, Executive Leasing.
<p>
   As leasing began taking off nationwide in the 1970s, the
father-son team started to push their replacement-rental business  &MD; 
which they had formed in 1963, with 17 cars  &MD;  as a service to
leasing customers.
<p>
   ``We could see this niche and we figured there was something
here,'' said Andrew Taylor, 49, who took over as chief executive in
1991. ``There was an evolution of people's reliance on having
transportation all of the time, and we were fortunate to ride that
wave.''
<p>
   Executive Leasing remains a division of Enterprise, though it
accounts for less than 5 percent of the company's gross revenues.
<p>
   A highly decentralized network of company-owned branches  &MD;  ``a
confederation of small businesses,'' in Andrew Taylor's description
 &MD;  fuels Enterprise's growth on the strength of its referral
relationships with auto dealers, insurance agents and adjusters and
body shops. Competition among the branches is notorious, with
managers encouraged by the home office to place bets with each
other on staff performance. (The losers might pay for dinner or
work extra hours at the winning branch.)
<p>
   But as Enterprise grows, Andrew Taylor says, it is getting
harder to find enough employees with the competitive mindset he
seeks and the affability necessary to work with the public for long
hours, often seven days a week.
<p>
   This year alone, Enterprise is preparing to hire 10,000 college
graduates for its management training program, making it one of the
nation's largest hirers. Enterprise now has 31,000 employees.
<p>
   About 25 percent of the new hires will leave before six months.
Those who stay do everything from washing cars and picking up
customers to handling paperwork. Almost everybody in the company,
from Andrew Taylor down, goes through the program. As Taylor likes
to say, ``We've all had our ties sucked into the vacuum.''
<p>
   Richard Allen, the Enterprise vice president who leads the
recruiting effort, recognizes the enormity of the job. ``We need
more people than most companies to facilitate our ongoing growth,''
he said. ``We need to be more aggressive than most in who we
hire.''
<p>
   As the industry begins a new era, aggressive will be the
watchword at Enterprise for more than just hiring.
<p>
   ``This is a business of details, not brilliance,'' Andrew Taylor
said. ``Our customers don't care if we have the best computer
system. They want someone to look them in the eye and ask, `How can
I help you?' ''

<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Don Mattingly, the greatest New
York Yankee never to appear in a World Series, retired from
baseball.
<p>
   Mattingly, 35, has not played since 1995 and was plagued by back
problems his final few seasons that cut his production.
<p>
   A free agent after his last season, Mattingly didn't re-sign
with the Yankees and sat out in 1996 as New York won its first
World Series in 18 years.
<p>
   ``I'm proud of everything I've been able to accomplish here with
the Yankees,'' Mattingly said at a press conference at Yankee
Stadium. ``I look back with joy at the opportunities I had and with
no regrets.''
<p>
   The team said Mattingly's uniform number 23 will be retired
sometime during the 1997 season, becoming the 14th number the
Yankees have retired.
<p>
   Even though he sat out the 1996 season, he never formally
retired, leaving open the possibility to a return to New York or
another major league team. Last season, Mattingly received contract
offers from three or four teams, although he didn't accept any.
<p>
   ``One of the main words for me has always been loyalty,'' said
Mattingly, who was accompanied by his wife, Kim, and their three
sons. ``One thing I couldn't think of was the thought of myself
playing somewhere else.''
<p>
   He said he originally intended to return in 1997 until a week or
so after Thanksgiving, when he stopped working out.
<p>
   ``When I left it was open ended,'' he said. ``I guess I wasn't
really willing to pay the price to be successful. At that point I
knew it was time to step away and that's what I'm doing today.''
<p>
   A six-time All-Star, Mattingly hit .307 with 222 home runs and
1,099 runs batted in during his 13-year career. He won the 1984
American League batting title with a .343 average, edging out
teammate Dave Winfield on the final day of the season, and was
named the 1985 American League Most Valuable Player after hitting
.324 with 35 HR and 145 RBI.
<p>
   ``We've had greats here with the Yankees, but he's one of the
truly great,'' said Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
<p>
   Mattingly burst upon the New York baseball scene in his first
full season of 1984. In addition to winning the batting crown, he
led the American League with 207 hits and 44 doubles.
<p>
   He topped those accomplishments the next season by winning the
Most Valuable Player Award, leading the major leagues with 145 RBI
and 48 doubles, and won his first Gold Glove Award.
<p>
   Those two seasons began a six-year stretch in which many
considered him the best player in baseball. From 1984-89, Mattingly
hit a combined .327 with 160 home runs and 684 RBI and was named to
the All-Star team each season.
<p>
   ``I never felt like I was as talented as other players,''
Mattingly said. ``I felt, though, that I was willing to do things
other players weren't willing to do.''
<p>
   He etched his name in the major league record book in 1987 by
belting six grand slams during the season and tied Dale Long's
31-year-old major league mark by hitting home runs in eight
straight games.
<p>
   His back problems began in the 1990 season when he missed 54
games, and his production also began to drop. Although his average
would still hover around .290, his power numbers fell. He averaged
just under 10 home runs and 64 RBI his final six seasons.
<p>
   In 1991, the Yankees named him the 10th captain in team history,
joining the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Thurman Munson. The
team hasn't named a replacement.
<p>
   For all the awards and accolades Mattingly collected, the World
Series eluded him.
<p>
   In his first 11 seasons, the Yankees only finished as high as
second place three times. He looked like he would finally get his
chance in 1994 when the Yankees had the best record in the American
League, although the strike ended the season early and caused the
cancellation of the postseason.
<p>
   Mattingly finally got a taste of postseason play in 1995 when
the Yankees won the first American League wild-card berth. He
shined during a five-game series loss to Seattle, hitting .417 with
one home run and tying for the team lead with six RBI.
<p>
   Mattingly said he felt that his whole career had been about
timing. The Yankees won their previous world championship in 1978,
a year before he signed with the team, and won their next one the
year after he left the game.
<p>
   ``It was a dual-edge sword from the standpoint of not being
here,'' Mattingly said when asked about the 1996 championship. ``It
was painful, but I was happy for the team.
<p>
   ``I told Kim a week after the series was over and everything
calmed down that I did the right thing and felt good about it.''
<p>
   A complete player, Mattingly was known for his fielding as well
as his hitting.
<p>
   He won nine Gold Glove Awards, most by an American League first
baseman, and led the league in fielding a record seven times.
<p>
   With just 68 errors in 15,462 career chances, his .996 fielding
percentage is the best of any position player in baseball history.
<p>
   While his offense may have suffered from an ailing back toward
the end of his career, his defense didn't. Mattingly set new team
records for fielding percentage for a first baseman in 1993 and
1994 at .998, committing just three errors the first year and just
two the second.
<p>
   Mattingly said he will now turn his attention to his family and
raising horses on his farm in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana.
He also said he would like to give something back to baseball.
<p>
   ``When I was playing, I didn't want to think about anything but
baseball,'' he said. ``I like to be able now to give back,
baseball-wise, to kids through clinics and teach.''
<p>
   The Yankees have previously retired 13 uniform numbers to honor
14 players or managers: 1 for Billy Martin, 3 for Ruth, 4 for
Gehrig, 5 for Joe DiMaggio, 7 for Mickey Mantle, 8 for Bill Dickey
and Yogi Berra, 9 for Roger Maris, 10 for Phil Rizzuto, 15 for
Munson, 16 for Whitey Ford, 32 for Elston Howard, 37 for Casey
Stengel and 44 for Reggie Jackson.

 &UR; TOO SOON TO STOP AIDS TREATMENT, RESEARCHER SAYS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD A. KNOX &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  A leading AIDS researcher said Wednesday it will be
at least six months to a year before he will consider stopping
treatment with a cocktail of drugs in some patients to see if the
therapy has eradicated the human immunodeficiency virus, which
causes AIDS.
<p>
   Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center
in New York City, said last summer he would be ready to do the
crucial drug-cessation experiment in a few patients by the end of
1996. Now, however, he believes it will take considerably longer
for HIV to be eliminated from the bodies of infected individuals.
<p>
   ``We're definitely revising our estimate,'' Ho said at the
opening of a major conference here on AIDS. Recent research has
persuaded him and his colleagues that HIV  &MD;  or rather, viral DNA
that could potentially give rise to more virus particles  &MD;  may lurk
in some cells for three years or even longer.
<p>
   Thus, the researchers ``have never popped the question with our
patients'' about whether they would be willing to discontinue
antiviral drug treatment.
<p>
   Particularly coming from Ho, who has spearheaded the drive to
treat AIDS aggressively, the revised estimate means that people
infected with HIV, their doctors and researchers are in for a long
period of uncertainty about the prospect of eradicating the deadly
infection. Meanwhile, scientists say, patients will have to take
their drugs scrupulously to avoid appearance of dangerous new HIV
strains resistant to the most effective drugs.
<p>
   Even though Ho's group has found no evidence that HIV is
actively reproducing in any of a small group of individuals
followed for up to 18 months on new multidrug treatments, they
cannot be certain that the virus would not reemerge if even a
single infected cell remains hidden away in a lymph node, a corner
of the brain, the testes or some other location.
<p>
   Thus, they believe they must wait until all HIV-infected cells
complete their natural lifespan and are eliminated from the body
before halting HIV-suppressing drugs.
<p>
   One problem is that scientists are uncertain about the lifespan
of these cells; before now, it has not been a question of pressing
scientific interest. In addition, Ho said, ``there is a lot of
individual variation'' in the persistence of HIV-infected cells.
<p>
   Another important factor is that the patients from which many of
Ho's insights are derived represent the best-case scenario of HIV
infection. Twenty of these patients began treatment with the most
potent combinations of anti-HIV drugs within 90 days of being
infected by the virus. By contrast, most HIV-infected individuals
harbor the virus for years before they even know they're infected.
<p>
   Ho's group of acutely infected patients, as they are called,
presumably would be the most likely of any to have the virus
eradicated by aggressive drug treatment. The virus would not have
had as much time to develop drug-resistant variants, and their
immune systems are not as devastated as those of long-infected
patients.
<p>
   However, Ho pointed out that other researchers are seeing
comparably encouraging results in patients with more advanced HIV
disease.
<p>
   Ho's group and other AIDS researchers are studying seminal
fluids and lymph tissue from patients' bowels to see if HIV can be
detected in these samples even when it is undetectable by the most
sensitive tests in blood. ``So far we see no evidence of ongoing
viral replication,'' he said at a press conference. ``We do see
some trapped viral particles.''
<p>
   The absence of active viral replication in seminal fluid does
not suggest that patients on multidrug treatments no longer need to
follow safe-sex precautions, Ho said. Other scientists at this
week's meeting are expected to present data suggesting that semen
does contain HIV particles, even in patients whose blood appears to
contain none.
<p>
   Another new finding from Ho's laboratory is that the immune
system of patients on long-term multidrug treatment is not actively
geared up to fight HIV, as it probably would be if the virus was
actively reproducing.
<p>
   ``It is justified to feel some degree of optimism,'' Ho said,
summing up these recent findings. However, he added, ``the
situation is neither black nor white. It's some shade of gray.''

<p>
   NORTHBROOK, Ill.  &MD;  Making the first trip of his second term,
President Clinton Wednesday took his bully pulpit to the classroom,
lecturing students and the nation about the importance of
education.
<p>
   In a visit to this affluent Chicago suburb, he praised local
student performance on an international science and math
achievement test and pointed to the exam as a national model.
<p>
   Both the trip and the speech served as symbols, not only of the
president's priorities but also of the way he intends to use his
office, campaigning not for votes but for public support for
government priorities such as education.
<p>
   Later, in Chicago, where many public schools are crumbling, test
scores are low, and class sizes, large, Clinton encouraged Mayor
Richard Daley and school board members to keep up their work on
education reforms, including creating charter schools.
<p>
   Clinton made a similar point during his speech at a packed field
house of 5,000 students, parents, teachers and administrators at
Glenbrook North High School.
<p>
   ``We have the best higher education system in the world; there's
no question about it,'' Clinton said. ``But we do not have the best
system of education in the world from start to finish for all our
children, and we cannot be satisfied until that is exactly what we
have in the United States of America.''
<p>
   Glenbrook North is part of a consortium of 20 school districts
in suburban Chicago that participated in last year's Third
International Math and Science study, which tested and ranked
fourth-, eighth- and 12th-grade students from 41 countries.
<p>
   U.S. students overall faired poorly on the test, with
eighth-graders ranking below average in math and slightly above
average in science when compared to the other countries. But
consortium eighth-graders scored first in science and second in
math, behind Singapore.
<p>
   Clinton, accompanied by Education Secretary Richard Riley, said
he hoped the students' success will ``reverberate all across
America.''
<p>
   The president called for other school districts and states to
adopt the international achievement test as a way to improve
teaching and learning of science and math. ``There is no better
model for what we were trying to do in the entire United States of
America than what you have done here,'' Clinton said.
<p>
   The Education Department has agreed to help as many as 60 states
and school districts participate in the 1997 and 1998 math and
science tests, and to use the results to improve teaching methods.
<p>
   Clinton's new budget, which will be submitted to Congress Feb.
6, will ask for a 26 percent increase in funding for Goals 2000,
his program to raise national education standards, from $491
million to $620 million, White House aides said.
<p>
   In addition, Clinton will propose to nearly double the funding
for charter schools from $51 million to $100 million.

<TEXT>
<p>
   MOSCOW  &MD;  In a display of Russia's mounting restiveness about
President Boris Yeltsin's seemingly permanent absence from the
Kremlin, the Parliament voted overwhelmingly Wednesday evening for
a resolution to remove Yeltsin from his post because of his poor
health.
<p>
   The 229-63 vote in the Communist-dominated lower house has no
legal force, and it was instantly swamped in a confusing blizzard
of parliamentary maneuvers which will require a second vote on the
resolution before it is adopted.
<p>
   But after seven troubling months in which the president has been
far too sick to work, the measure reflects the growing sense that
an economically depressed Russia has a leader who may never again
be fully capable of carrying out the strenuous duties of his job.
<p>
   ``Either we agree to Russia's collapse as a nation or we try to
do something about it,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, the Communist
legislator who initiated the resolution calling for Yeltsin, who
has double pneumonia, to be removed from office. ``We can no longer
sit and watch as our government is led by no one.''
<p>
   While opposition figures have often called on Yeltsin to be
removed, this was the first time the issue had been put to a vote.
<p>
   In the middle of the extraordinary debate on Yeltsin's health,
which lasted throughout the day, the president's press service
announced with great fanfare that he had defied his doctors and
traveled to the Kremlin to meet with Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
<p>
   But state television failed to broadcast even the usual brief
moment of the two men together Wednesday evening, and most news
shows openly questioned whether Yeltsin, who has not been seen by
the public since Jan. 6, did in fact make the trip.
<p>
   The president has appeared in the Kremlin only a few times since
he was re-elected last July and the country  &MD;  battered by a
depression that has left millions of workers and pensioners without
their salaries and stipends  &MD;  has increasingly viewed him as a
leader who rules in name alone. At first unwilling to exploit his
frailty, the Communists in the legislature have become increasingly
combative in the past month.
<p>
   That may be because recent polls have shown that the tide of
public opinion has turned sharply away from the president and his
administration. On Tuesday, Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin
acknowledged that the government's economic reform program was not
working.
<p>
   ``One has to say it failed last year,'' he told the Parliament
as they discussed the budget. He said that while inflation dropped,
the ability of private companies to generate profits  &MD;  and pay
their taxes  &MD;  dropped far more precipitously.
<p>
   In November, Yeltsin underwent heart bypass surgery and while
recovering he developed pneumonia that his doctors have described
as ``moderately severe,'' and which they said has left him
``morally and emotionally'' upset.
<p>
   On Tuesday his chief physician said it would take at least two
weeks before the president, who turns 66 next month, could return
to his office. The doctor commented approvingly upon the fact that
the president went out for a short walk with his granddaughter.
<p>
   But Yeltsin was clearly unable to sit in silence as the members
of the national legislature talked about his health the way people
used to talk about Leonid Brezhnev, the doddering Soviet leader who
for years ruled this country despite poor health that left him all
but incapacitated.
<p>
   ``It is not that the vote will force the president to resign,''
said Stepan Kiselyov, a political commentator for the newspaper
Izvestiya. ``That will not happen. But they have shown the general
crisis of state power that becomes more and more obvious each day.
People wonder how bad Yeltsin's disease really is, and they wonder
how much longer we can follow his route from his apartment to the
Kremlin to the hospital and back.''
<p>
   The vote probably will do nothing to calm the country or heal
its visible wounds. If Yeltsin were unable to serve  &MD;  and only he
could make that decision according to the Constitution  &MD;  then
Chernomyrdin would assume his role for up to three months before
calling new elections.
<p>
   It is not clear who would benefit from new elections, however.
Voters are disgusted with the current government and would be
unlikely to support the prime minister if he ran. But they have
also shown their unwillingness to bring Communists back to power.
<p>
   The most popular politician in Russia, Alexander Lebed, is held
in deep suspicion by Communists and liberals alike.
<p>
   Visiting New York on Wednesday, Lebed, while dismissing the
parliamentary vote as ``more political noise,'' repeated his
frequent assertion that Yeltsin is incapable of governing. He said
he suspected that if Yeltsin did step down, Chernomyrdin and the
Communists would protect their vested interests in the status quo
by finding some pretext not to hold elections.
<p>
   Members of most liberal factions in the 450-member Parliament
walked out before Wednesday's vote because they did not want to
take part in what a liberal critic of the administration, Grigory
Yavlinsky, described as a ``political farce and provocation.''
<p>
   Yavlinsky demanded another vote on the entire bill, of which the
resolution was a part. It was a clever move. That vote failed, so
the resolution will have to be reconsidered, probably in a couple
of weeks.
<p>
   Galina Starovoytova, a well-known liberal member of Parliament
who has often been critical of the president, said, ``I would
suggest that this legislative body would be better off preparing a
resolution on the burial of the remains of Lenin. This is a cynical
display that shows this body to be of almost no value at all.''
<p>
   Even if the legislature does pass the resolution in its final
form, it would have no legal basis. Russia's constitution mandates
that the president has immense powers and that the Parliament has
few. The Parliament can tie up legislation  &MD;  and it does. But it
cannot easily prevent Yeltsin from ruling by decree and fiat  &MD; 
which he does.
<p>
   ``This is not government,'' said Yegor Gaidar, the free-market
economist who led Yeltsin's first attempts at reform. ``This is
idiocy. It is time that Russia grew up.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  I can see how Sean Jones scares people.
<p>
   The Green Bay right defensive end is big, strong, experienced
and, worst of all, in possession of both a very active brain and an
even more active tongue. NFL people like it when their players are
smart enough to learn their assignments but not smart enough to
read the financial pages. Sean Jones owns his own financial
services company.
<p>
   This is a man who during the course of a distinguished 13-year
NFL career has sued both the league and the union. He's an equal
opportunity agitator. He is always secure in himself because he is
one of the few NFL players who knows that the nefarious ``they''
always need him more than he needs them. Sean Jones uses football,
not the other way around.
<p>
   Jones never intended to be a professional football player. After
spurning Cornell (``my mother wanted me to go there'') and Maryland
(``because of the lacrosse program''), he chose to attend
Northeastern because of the co-op program. He did his co-op work at
F.W. Woolworth's. He played his football at Parsons Field before
friends and Jack Grinold. There was never any doubt in his mind
which one was more important.
<p>
   ``I don't even know how the scouts found me, playing against
James Madison, UMass and URI, before, if we were lucky, a whopping
2,300,'' he says.
<p>
   But the scouts started coming around for workouts, and it was
clear to him that pro football was going to be an option. Even
then, he was far from ga-ga about the idea.
<p>
   ``I made up my mind that if I wasn't going to be drafted high, I
didn't even want to try,'' he says. ``I'm not going to sit here and
lie and say I always had an ambition to play pro ball and that this
was some kind of a `Rudy' situation. I just got lucky at the right
time. If I didn't play professional football, I was ready to go to
work.''
<p>
   The Raiders took him in the second round of the 1984 draft. At
training camp things weren't going so well and he figured,
``Woolworth's, here I come.'' Then someone informed him that no
team would give up quickly on a second-round draft pick. ``That's
when I decided I'd better take this job seriously,'' he explains.
<p>
   But at no point did he ever play scared.
<p>
   ``What was the worst that could happen?'' he asks. ``They'd cut
me, and I'd go to work? I'd already been doing that for four
years.''
<p>
   The Raiders gave him an attitude. ``The `Us vs. Them' thing
always stays with you,'' he says. He moved onto Houston, where he
learned conclusively that pure talent without application and order
is a waste.
<p>
   ``I was there six years, and in at least four of them we were
good enough to win the whole thing,'' he maintains. ``What went on
down there was a joke. We were the only AFC team with the
components needed to beat the NFC teams, and we squandered it. It's
not that way there now, but it was back then.''
<p>
   Ten years into his career, he signed with Green Bay. Ever the
pragmatist, he decided that, whatever Green Bay's perceived social
shortcomings for a black player, the football situation was
excellent, and it would be particularly enticing for the ``other''
defensive end; i.e, the one who wasn't Reggie White.
<p>
   ``You'd be playing with a guy who gets triple-teamed all the
time, and you'd get single-teamed?'' he inquires. ``That was a very
selfish motivation.''
<p>
   The black-white thing wasn't going to scare away Jamaican-born
Sean Jones.
<p>
   ``I don't look at simple differences between people as being
racist,'' he says. ``There can be differences without racism. And
let me say this: I was born in Jamaica and I was raised in New
Jersey. I've lived in Boston, Los Angeles and Houston. Green Bay is
the least racist place I've ever lived in.''
<p>
   He applauds the Green Bay organization for creating a pleasant
working circumstance for all of its players. The team imports a
barber from Milwaukee to cut the hair of the African-American
players. The team brings in soul food twice a week.
<p>
   ``I don't believe that every individual player should need to be
personally motivated to play,'' Jones says, ``but an organization
should do what it can to inspire players. Houston did a horrible
job at that, and it's a major reason why they never won a
championship. The people in Green Bay understand.''
<p>
   Long used to being misunderstood by ownership, coaches, media
and even teammates, Jones is classically amused by some of the
things he's been hearing during Super Bowl week. For example,
someone asked him if he considered this game to be a ``showcase''
for his talents.
<p>
   ``People who need to know me know me,'' he says. ``I know when
I've played well and when I haven't played well.''
<p>
   He has a clear understanding of taking the job seriously, as
opposed to taking the game seriously. ``I don't want people to
think football is who I am,'' he says. Jones knows that this is a
game where the end is always one play away, and he is ready for the
next life. Amaroq Financial Services (888-426-2762) is located in
Beverly Hills. He also manages a hedge fund called Daylight
Capital, and he has his own sports apparel company, DSI &AMP;
Associates.
<p>
   But there will be time enough for those ventures in the
offseason. Sean Jones has his mind on a football game to be played
Sunday at 6:18 p.m EDT.
<p>
   ``Getting here is fantastic,'' he says, ``but leaving here
without a ring would be crazy.
<p>
   ``I hope no one misunderstands, but the subject of the ring is
personal. It is important for me to get this ring. Me. Not Reggie
White or anybody else. If you say, `You won it, but only one guy
can get this ring,' I would want that one person to be me.''
<p>
   As I said, Sean Jones scares people.

 &UR; RESEARCHERS GET FIRST DETAILED LOOK AT MAGNETIC CLOUD FROM SUN &LR;  &QL; 
(sw) &QL;

 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<p>
   GREENBELT, Md.  &MD;  The Sun released a giant cloud of magnetized
particles that researchers were able to monitor in detail for the
first time as it approached and swept past Earth this month,
scientists said on Wednesday.
<p>
   An international group of space scientists said that on Jan. 6
the Sun ejected a pocket of mass from its corona that developed
into a giant, tube-shaped magnetic bubble 30 million miles in
diameter that hit Earth almost four days later. The expanding cloud
of energized particles triggered a large storm in the magnetic
field, or magnetosphere, surrounding the planet. The storm
brightened the Northern Lights and possibly knocked out a
communications satellite.
<p>
   Speaking at a briefing here at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center, scientists said the mass eruption from the Sun was not so
unusual in itself. What was unusual, they said, was that the
eruption was spotted shortly after it occurred and tracked by space
satellites and Earth stations as it traveled the 93 million miles
to Earth and then passed the planet.
<p>
   ``This is not the first time it ever happened, and it is not the
greatest solar storm ever seen,'' said Dr. Stephen Maran, a NASA
astronomer. ``What it is, is the first time that one of these
events has been captured sort of cradle to grave.''
<p>
   Being able to track this month's event raises hopes of one day
having an early warning system of satellites and ground stations to
detect possibly destructive solar events, the researchers said.
<p>
   Previously, researchers have monitored parts of solar eruptions
and storms at different stages of development, often without
clearly seeing the cause of an observed effect and the evolution of
the phenomenon in between, scientists said.
<p>
   ``Up till now, it's been a little like the fable of three blind
men trying to describe an elephant,'' Maran continued. ``What you
are dealing with here is an elephant millions of miles long,
traveling at a million miles per hour.''
<p>
   What was different about the burst of mass that erupted from the
Sun on Jan. 6 was that the event was recorded as part of the
International Solar Terrestrial Physics Program. This time, more
than 20 satellites operated by the United States, the European
Space Agency, Japan and other nations were in position and
scientists were prepared to observe such an event, researchers
said.
<p>
   Dr. Barbara Thompson, a Goddard scientist, said researchers
attending a workshop on Jan. 7 noticed a solar event in data they
were reviewing that had occurred the day before. The scientists
interpreted the event, noticed by a new United States-European
spacecraft called the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO,
as one that could reach Earth.
<p>
   On Jan. 10, SOHO, which was a million miles from Earth in an
orbit between the gravitational fields of the Sun and Earth,
observed the magnetic event. It was soon picked up by other
satellites closer to Earth, Dr. Thompson said. SOHO measured an
increase of more than 20 percent in the speed of the solar wind
flowing from the Sun, clocking the passing bubble at 962,000 mph.
<p>
   Researchers said there was no proof that the solar storm caused
any damage, but such events can cause disruptions on Earth by
overloading communications and power-generation facilities or
damaging delicate electrical equipment, such as space satellites.
<p>
   Scientists said they did not know if this month's event caused
the failure, early on Jan. 11, of AT&AMP;T's Telstar 401 communications
satellite, but it occurred during magnetic storms above Earth.

<p>
   INDIANAPOLIS  &MD;  Chris Childs considers it a great honor to start
at point guard for the Knicks. He knows with that responsibility
sometimes comes the unenviable chore of letting his teammates know
what he believes to be the truth, even if they do not want to hear
it.
<p>
   Still bothered by an 88-87 loss to Chicago on Tuesday night at
the United Center, the team's floor leader tried to become its
locker-room conscience Wednesday. He never mentioned names, but he
basically said the Knicks need to stop the socializing and shelve
the popularity contests when they step on the floor.
<p>
   It is a refrain that has been echoed by Coach Jeff Van Gundy and
Charles Oakley at different times this season, but Childs tried to
drive it home strongly Wednesday afternoon.
<p>
   He was sitting on a bench at Butler University, where he and the
Knicks' two other point guards, Charlie Ward and Scott Brooks, had
just finished mopping the floor with John Wallace, Walter McCarty
and Dontae Jones, the team's three 6-foot-7-and-over rookies.
Twelve hours after Childs had been jawing with Michael Jordan, he
was talking trash to Jones.
<p>
   He wishes everyone on his team felt this way about every
opponent. Asked why he was so upset after the Knicks nearly pulled
out the victory, Childs replied: ``Just everything. The way we
played down the stretch, the way they played, the way they were
talking, and only a few guys talking back.
<p>
   ``We're just too nice right now. Smiling. Being friendly on the
court. That's not the way to go about it. I didn't like that. Like
I said after the game, when we step between these lines, it's a
war. You have friends, whatever, you can be friends after the game.
Once you come to the arena, 6:30, 6 o'clock whatever, your focus
should just be on our team, us against, you know, the world,
because it's us against everybody in that stadium.''
<p>
   New York has lost three of its last four road games. The Knicks
meet the Pacers on Thursday night at Market Square Arena and
Charlotte on Friday at the Charlotte Coliseum before facing Miami
Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Those games wrap up what Van Gundy
tabbed the most critical stretch for his team thus far in the
regular season, an eight-game, 13-day gauntlet.
<p>
   ``When we step out on the court as a whole  &MD;  it's not an
individual thing, I mean as a team  &MD;  we didn't have that fire and
desire to just go out there and ... us against the world,'' Childs
said, alluding to the Bulls game. ``Because if we did, they got too
many easy layups in transition, without anybody challenging them or
hitting them. When we went to the basket, they were pounding us.''
<p>
   Childs said some of the Knicks ``take that type of approach,''
but not enough of them. ``We have to get back to being nasty, not
dirty. Just being nasty, having that aura when we step out there so
teams fear coming to the basket, teams fear playing against us.''
<p>
   Larry Johnson has been known to fraternize often with opposing
players. On occasion, Patrick Ewing has done the same thing.
Whether that translates to either player going after a loose ball
with the same fervor is better answered by a behavioral
psychologist.
<p>
   As for Allan Houston, well, it is not in his personality profile
to grate on anyone. Asked what the solution was, Childs said:
``Maybe he needs to eat some onions, do something. He's our silent
assassin. He has that inner strength that needs to come out. I
think he's starting to figure out that a guy like Mike, who has
that killer instinct when he's going up against him, he has to have
that same type of mentality. It'll come out of him.''
<p>
   Consequently, a trend of disrespecting the new-look Knicks has
gained impetus in the past few weeks. Charles Barkley said last
week that John Starks is a better shooter than Houston, Scottie
Pippen said after the game on Tuesday night that Anthony Mason gave
them more presence than Johnson.
<p>
   Everyone in the league but David Stern, it seems, has analyzed
them.
<p>
   ``If we would've beat them, you think they would have still
talked?'' Childs said of Pippen's comments. ``Next time we play
them, we'll have to shut them up.''

   Orlando, Florida, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Orlando Magic
activated rookie forward Brian Evans, who hasn't played this season
after dislocating his right shoulder during the summer.
<p>
   Evans, Orlando's first-round pick out of Indiana last year,
suffered the injury on July 11 in a practice before summer
professional league play. He underwent surgery July 24 and was
placed on the injured list Oct. 31.
<p>
   To make room on the roster, the Magic placed rookie forward Amal
McCaskill on the injured list with a right calf bruise.
<p>
   McCaskill, taken in the second round by the Magic in 1996, has
averaged 1.7 points and 1.5 rebounds in 11 games this season. He
began the year on the injured list with patella tendinitis and was
activated on Nov. 19.

   LIMA, Peru  &MD;  Tensions remained high at the Japanese ambassador's
residence here Wednesday after guerrillas holding 73 hostages
inside fired shots into the air during the night, presumably to
scare off policemen who were conducting maneuvers outside the
compound.
<p>
   The Tupac Amaru rebels have fired shots from automatic weapons
on at least four occasions in recent weeks, saying they were
warning the police not to come too close to the residence.
<p>
   But the gunfire shortly after midnight has raised fears that the
police exercises are a harbinger of a government plan to raid the
residence or that the maneuvers could provoke the rebels to kill
some hostages.
<p>
   While the government of President Alberto Fujimori has said it
is committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the 36-day-old
hostage crisis, it has undertaken a seemingly contradictory
strategy of taunting the guerrillas in recent weeks.
<p>
   ``Fujimori is employing a textbook strategy to dealing with
long-term hostage takers  &MD;  applying psychological pressure,'' said
a Western diplomat who requested anonymity.
<p>
   ``This is a fairly dangerous thing to do in this particular
situation because it increases the prospects for bloodshed,'' the
diplomat said.
<p>
   A larger-than-usual number of police officers, special military
forces, and SWAT teams were visible Wednesday in the streets
surrounding the Japanese residence.
<p>
   ``All of these new police worry me,'' said Guillermo Sarmiento,
a street vendor who sells ice cream near the residence. ``I think
they are planning an action of some type. But it doesn't make sense
because we've come so far without anyone being killed yet.''
<p>
   In recent days, the police have ordered photographers perched on
roofs near the residence to leave their positions and move behind
newly established police lines several blocks from the residence.
<p>
   The police have also taunted the rebels by throwing debris over
the compound wall and opening and closing wall doors that lead to
the residence's garden.
<p>
   The Tupac Amaru rebels are reportedly heavily armed with
automatic weapons and rocket launchers, and they have placed mines
and booby traps within the compound and the house.
<p>
   An official of Peru's antiterrorism police, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the government had no plans to storm
the residence unless the rebels begin killing hostages.
<p>
   ``Of course, a plan has been devised to take back the residence,
but at this point we have no intention of using it unless we are
forced to,'' the official said.
<p>
   The government's plan to establish a special commission to
negotiate an end to the crisis appears to be stalled. While the
rebels and the government have reportedly agreed to the
commission's makeup, no place or date has been announced for the
first negotiating session. The rebels are asking for the release of
their comrades from Peruvian jails, something the government has
said it will never agree to.
<p>
   Local newspapers reported Wednesday that members of the
International Committee of the Red Cross have begun advising
hostages during their daily visits to the Japanese ambassador's
residence that the crisis could take much longer they had initially
expected. A spokeswoman for the Red Cross declined to comment on
those reports.
<p>
   But the Red Cross acknowledged receiving a donation of 30
mattresses on Tuesday that are expected to be delivered to the
residence. Most of the 73 hostages who are still being held in the
residence  &MD;  out of several hundred taken prisoner Dec. 17  &MD;  sleep
on the floor.

<p>
   BETHESDA, Md.  &MD;  In a marathon session, a panel of 13 scientists
worked to hammer out an answer to a health question that vexes
millions of women: Should they start getting screening mammograms
for breast cancer in their 40s, or not until they're 50 or older?
<p>
   The panel, which heard complex and often conflicting evidence
from 32 specialists over a day and a half, is charged with arriving
at a consensus today to help guide doctors and patients through an
issue clouded by confusion and controversy.
<p>
   There's little argument that women 50 and above reduce their
chances of dying from breast cancer by having annual mammograms,
which can detect tumors too small to be felt. What is hotly debated
is the effectiveness of routine mammograms for women in their 40s,
who have a lower risk of breast cancer to begin with and for whom
mammography is less effective.
<p>
   Researchers from Sweden came to the Consensus Development
Conference, convened by the National Institutes of Health, to
present their most recent results from large-scale trials. It was
these findings, which bolster the case that screening can reduce
breast cancer deaths in 40- to 49-year-old women, that prompted the
decision to hold the conference.
<p>
   Earlier data long ago persuaded a number of organizations,
including the American Cancer Society, to recommend screening at
one- or two-year intervals for women in their 40s. But in 1993, the
National Cancer Institute, a branch of the NIH, broke ranks and
withdrew its support for screening this age group, saying there is
too little statistically significant evidence to justify it.
<p>
   Another argument against routinely screening women in their 40s
is that mammograms often detect apparent abnormalities that lead to
further costly, painful and anxiety-provoking tests, including
surgical biopsies, only to determine that the lesion is not a
tumor. The rate of these ``false positives'' is higher among
younger women, according to many studies.
<p>
   The situation has left women and physicians in a quandary.
<p>
   ``I think it's been very disruptive and very confusing to
women,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal, director of health services for
Harvard University and president-elect of the Cancer Society, in a
recent interview. Rosenthal argued that there is now ``strong
evidence'' to support screening for younger women, but he said
``it's going to be damn hard for them (NCI) to back down from this
position.''
<p>
   Beginning at noon Wednesday, the 13 panel members  &MD;  doctors,
statisticians, academic researchers, lay people and activists  &MD; 
went into seclusion to begin sorting through the latest data.
<p>
   The new reports include one from Gothenburg, Sweden, showing a
44 percent decrease in breast cancer deaths among women in their
40s who were screened.
<p>
   Despite this and other data that tended to favor screening, it
was by no means evident which way the panel was leaning. Even the
Swedish researchers said it was an agonizing decision. In that
country, the issue is left up to county health departments, and
counties are about evenly divided on the question, said one
researcher.
<p>
   ``It's a very difficult problem and the balance is about even,''
said Ingvar Andersson, a radiologist from Malmo, Sweden, in an
interview.
<p>
   The strongest evidence on the benefits of screening older women
comes from large-scale trials, in the United States, Canada and
Sweden, that found a 30 percent reduction in breast cancer deaths
among women ages 50 and above. The great majority of breast cancers
occur at older ages, and X-rays of older women's breasts are
generally easier to interpret. In addition, tumors grow more slowly
in older women, so screening has a greater chance of catching them
before the cancer has spread.
<p>
   However, an estimated 33,400 new cases of cancer occurred last
year in women in their 40s  &MD;  about 18 percent of all breast
cancers. More than 5,000 will die of their disease. Still, because
those numbers are relatively small compared to the overall toll of
breast cancer, it has taken many years for clinical trials to
accumulate evidence on effectiveness. In part, however, this is
because earlier studies weren't designed to look at screening in
this age group.
<p>
   The report from Gothenburg showed the largest benefit to date.
Dr. Nils Bjurstam, a radiologist who headed the Gothenburg study,
said that after 12 years of follow-up, during which one group of
women in their 40s was screened five times, there were 44 percent
fewer deaths in that group compared with an unscreened control
group.
<p>
   Noting that the women had mammograms every 18 months, he said,
``I think the benefit would be greater with more frequent
screening.''
<p>
   One of the few points of agreement at the conference was that if
younger women are to be screened, it should be done every year,
because tumors grow faster at younger ages.

<TEXT>
<p>
   TEL AVIV, Israel  &MD;  Nobody would deny that Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has the least political experience and the least
ideological baggage in the Israeli Cabinet.
<p>
   He is a political rookie, a recently retired general who joined
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party only a few months
before the election last spring that brought it back into power.
<p>
   In a government leaning heavily to the right, he is conspicuous
as a moderate, a minister who battled the hawks in the Cabinet for
an agreement on a partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
city of Hebron with the argument, ``Because of some dump in Hebron,
should we set the whole region on fire?''
<p>
   But Mordechai, 52, has emerged from the tumult of the last seven
months as the key problem-solver in the government and as the most
popular member of it.
<p>
   Though largely excluded from the Hebron negotiations at first,
he plunged into the last round, which culminated in a deal last
week, to wrap up the security and civil agreements.
<p>
   While some of his colleagues still bristle at the very sight of
Yasser Arafat, Mordechai had no trouble referring to the
Palestinian leader by his fighting name, Abu Ammar, in private and
in public, or speaking of Palestinian rights as something to be
taken into account.
<p>
   At the same time he has become the government's point man in
dealing with Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
has maintained a measure of credibility with them. Last month,
residents of the Beit El settlement agreed to dismantle an illegal
trailer camp they had set up on a West Bank hilltop, and thus
avoided a confrontation with the army, when they were promised a
meeting with Mordechai.
<p>
   With Israeli-Egyptian ties at a low, Mordechai went to Egypt
last month and, according to Western diplomats there, forged a good
personal bond with President Hosni Mubarak. He will soon travel to
Jordan to meet with King Hussein, and he said he was calling daily
on the leaders of Syria to get down to the negotiating table.
<p>
   Not surprisingly, he has become a favorite of the Clinton
administration, which has been trying to get the Netanyahu
government to move faster on making peace with its neighbors.
<p>
   Public opinion polls have consistently ranked him the most
popular minister in the government, well ahead of Netanyahu. It is
noteworthy that his rating surged to a new high shortly after his
``dump in Hebron'' comment, suggesting that what many Israelis
liked about him was his readiness to cut through the ideology and
get to a deal.
<p>
   All that puts the short and stocky Mordechai squarely in the
classic Israeli mold of the warrior-statesman, men like Yitzhak
Rabin or Moshe Dayan who were trusted to talk of peace because they
had gone through the cauldron of war. Though short on political
experience, his 33 years in the army are still the sort of
background Israelis prefer when it comes to the vital questions of
making deals with the Arabs.
<p>
   Interviewed in his office in the Defense Ministry, Mordechai
told how his experience of battle had molded his attitude toward
peace. He said that during his visit to Egypt in December, he got
together with Defense Minister Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, and soon
the two old soldiers discovered that they had once fought each
other.
<p>
   ``He had commanded an infantry battalion during the Yom Kippur
War in 1973 in the region of the bridgehead on the Suez Canal,''
Mordechai recalled in his limited but adequate English. ``I
commanded the Third Battalion, which attacked his battalion. We
both lost quite a lot of commanders and soldiers. We loved them so
much, and respected them so much, and both of us came to the
conclusion that we have to do all our best not to put our
commanders and units into war and not to lose so many people.''
<p>
   That is the sort of talk that still inspires more confidence
than political slogans, especially from a commander who fought in
all of Israel's modern wars and was renowned for his popularity
with the troops. His simple and practical declarations have been
especially welcome in a government that has often seemed lost
between ideology and hard realities.
<p>
   But Mordechai does not fault the Netanyahu government's
policies. ``To build peace takes a long time,'' he said. ``To
damage it can be done in a very short time. What I am trying to do,
what our government is trying to do in a few months, is to rebuild
the peace process and the negotiations with the Arab leaders and
how we can move forward with the peace process.''
<p>
   In the bitter debates in the Cabinet over Hebron, Mordechai did
not pretend that the agreement guaranteed the security of the
Jewish settlers, or that it would end all strife. His argument was
that it was a risk worth taking for the larger peace it might lead
to.
<p>
   ``We understand that we are putting some of our population in
the Hebron area, and not only there, in a weaker situation,'' he
said. ``I'd like to be honest: the main test of the agreement will
be how all the people play it in the area of Hebron. If all of them
understand that they have to build a new life in the new situation
in the area of Hebron, it can work. If there will be a problem in
the area of Hebron, that can damage all the peace process. That is
one of the reasons we needed time to make the agreement.''
<p>
   His strong advocacy of the 1993 and 1995 agreements that set
Israel on the path of conciliation with the Palestinians has
prompted political satirists to suggest that he might really belong
in the Labor Party, which negotiated the accords with the PLO. But
political analysts argue that it is not Mordechai's dovishness but
his pragmatic approach and his military credibility that really
account for his standing.
<p>
   ``From time to time we will have crises, but we have to more
forward,'' he said. ``Both sides have to be flexible. The
Palestinians have to understand what we can give them and what we
can't give them, not now and not for the future.
<p>
   ``I think we are giving to the Palestinians what no government
ever gave to the Palestinians  &MD;  not the Ottomans, not the Arabs,
not the British, not the French, not anybody. Israel is the first
government, the first power in the Middle East that tried to
support and give quite a lot of rights to the Palestinians. But we
can't allow that there will be a new army in the area of Israel,
and we can't allow that it will be a new power that can change the
situation of Israel.''

``Cruisin' the Castro'' tours, in 1991, hurrying away from a
demonstration in the Castro. Jordan was running for mayor at the
time, and Governor  &UR; Pete Wilson &LR;  had vetoed a bill banning
employment discrimination against gays and lesbians.
<p>
   Candidate Jordan showed up in the Castro hoping to ``court gay
voters,'' as community-based historian  &UR; Gerard Koskovich &LR;  recalls.
``But on his watch as chief, there had been numerous anti-gay
outrages by the San Francisco police, and he was set upon. He left
so fast he ran out of one of his loafers.''
<p>
   The shoe was picked up by a demonstrator who donated it to the
Gay and Lesbian Historical Society. Visitors who want to see it
should ask for an archival box labeled ``Trophies.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   With Mordechai at the head of the Defense Ministry, which is
responsible for administering those parts of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip that Israel still occupies, the government has moved to lift
many of the restrictions on the Palestinians.
<p>
   The number of Palestinians allowed to work in Israel has been
steadily increased, and the movement of freight trucks in and out
of the Gaza Strip is back to its levels of a year ago, before a
wave of Palestinian suicide bombings prompted an Israeli cutoff of
most traffic with the territories. A road closed for the last two
years in Gaza because it runs near a small Jewish settlement has
been reopened.
<p>
   Mordechai has signaled that he will not automatically slap
severe restrictions on the Palestinians whenever there is tension.
After a young Israeli soldier opened fire on the Arab market in
Hebron on Jan. 1, Mordechai quickly went to Hebron and there met
with Palestinian leaders to find ways of preventing an explosion.
To their surprise, he lifted a curfew after only three hours.
<p>
   The Defense Ministry is also charged with issuing permits for
construction or expansion in the Jewish settlements in the West
Bank, and while the government has come under fire for various
statements and proposals, it has not in fact approved any new
settlements. Mordechai insists that it will not.
<p>
   ``There are government decisions that we are not going to build
new settlements, but the government decided at the same time we
have a right to support the settlements with what they need to
continue their life,'' he said.
<p>
   Mordechai's political emergence has come as something of a
surprise to many Israelis. Though he was courted by both parties
when he retired from the army in October 1995 for his popularity
with the troops and among his fellow Sephardic Jews  &MD;  he is a
Kurdish Jew by birth, the son of a rabbi who brought his family to
Israel from Iraq in 1949  &MD;  he was not regarded as someone destined
for a major political role.
<p>
   But he appears to have learned the ropes quickly. He blocked
Netanyahu's attempt to create a national security council, which
would have pre-empted much of the authority of the defense
minister.
<p>
   And as Netanyahu found himself in crisis after crisis,
Mordechai's steadiness and military experience brought him
increasingly to the fore. He was called on to calm tensions with
Syria after it moved troops closer to the Golan Heights, and then
to restore control after Palestinians rioted over the opening of a
tunnel in Old Jerusalem.
<p>
   Mordechai acknowledged that his plunge into politics was abrupt.
<p>
   ``But now I look forward to moving with our government and the
prime minister into the future,'' he said. ``It will be a lot of
problem in the future, but if all of us are strong enough to
understand what is the end, where we are going, we can achieve the
main goal.''

<p>
   ELCHE, Spain  &MD;  Once in a while, something happens that offends
the strong sense of honor of someone in Spain and the displeased
party will not rest until the grievance is redressed. One such
affront explains why a delegation from the city of Elche, led by
the mayor, recently marched into a Madrid museum, surrounded a
statue and sang an angry song.
<p>
   The statue was the Lady of Elche, Spain's most famous ancient
icon. As every Spanish schoolchild learns, this finely chiseled
face, framed with an elaborate headdress and necklaces, represents
an Iberian priestess or princess and is believed to be some 2,500
years old.
<p>
   And as everyone in Elche knows, she was found at a rich
archeological site just outside this city 100 years ago. Therein
lies the problem.
<p>
   Elche, a sunny place of palm groves, shoe factories and some
200,000 people in the Valencia region, has asked to borrow the Lady
this summer to commemorate her discovery.
<p>
   Because Elche will then also celebrate the 2,000th anniversary
of its foundation as a city, the mayor wants the Lady to be the
centerpiece of a special exhibit to be held in a 15th-century
castle downtown.
<p>
   But to Elche's shock, a government commission has said no. It
argued that the precious sandstone bust is too fragile to make the
250-mile journey from its home in the National Museum of
Archeology, in Madrid, to Elche, in southeastern Spain. Some museum
officials said the government had refused for political reasons.
<p>
   Elche's request and Madrid's rebuff are a slice of what is
called the ``autonomy question,'' the growing demand for status and
power by the regions of Spain as they reassert their historical and
cultural identity. Whenever Basques, Catalans or Valencians want to
expand their rights, it is usually at the expense of the power of
Madrid, which for centuries has exercised tight control over the
nation.
<p>
   Since democracy returned two decades ago, Madrid has gradually
loosened its leash, giving the 17 regions, each with its own
government, more say in issues like taxes, education and the use of
local languages. Some conservatives fear that decentralization may
go too far, pulling Spain apart.
<p>
   That fear also includes the fate of the country's artistic
treasures. ``If they'd get away with it, the regions would empty
out Madrid's museums and take home their cultural properties,''
said a curator in Madrid.
<p>
   Calls for loans or restitution of cultural goods already exist.
Barcelona is asking for the transfer of the historic archives of
Catalonia, which are kept outside the region, in Salamanca. The
Basque city of Bilbao has asked Madrid to send it Picasso's
``Guernica,'' which depicts an air raid on the city near Bilbao.
<p>
   ``It's preposterous to say that it's unsafe to transport the
statue,'' said Rafael Ramos, director of Elche's archeology museum.
``Far more delicate works of art travel around the world all the
time,'' he said, noting that the Lady has already been to Elche
once, about 30 years ago.
<p>
   ``I think Madrid is afraid that we'll have a popular movement to
keep her and people will not want to give her back,'' he said.
<p>
   Ivan Aranda, a coordinator of the festivities at the town hall,
insisted that Elche ``is definitely not planning to keep the
statue,'' adding: ``We have asked to borrow it just for two months.
It's really important to us.''
<p>
   The snub from Madrid has now swollen into an issue of not just
local but also regional pride. The town councils of Alicante,
Benidorm, Santa Pola and other nearby cities have passed motions
supporting Elche's request. Several political and civic groups sent
out Christmas cards bearing the statue's picture. A local musician
has composed a ballad about the affair, which the Mayor and other
citizens sang the other day in the archeology museum in Madrid.
<p>
   Adding to this, Elche feels newly vilified by the recent Spanish
edition of an American book asserting that the statue is a
19th-century fake.
<p>
   John F. Moffitt, an art historian at the New Mexico State
University, says in his book, ``Art Forgery: The Case of the Lady
of Elche,'' that the shape of her nose and eyes are too delicate to
have been carved in pre-Christian Spain. He argues that spots where
the statue is chipped reveal a whiteness inside the stone that does
not match the grayish exterior and could not have remained so
pristine.
<p>
   Many scholars have dismissed Moffitt's thesis. To most experts,
the bust, which is about two feet high, represents the finest
example of early Iberian civilization and dates from the late fifth
century B.C. Specialists at the Louvre Museum in Paris, which owned
the statue until 1941, said there was no doubt about its
authenticity.
<p>
   The American's claim infuriates Ramos, the director of
archeology of Elche. Strolling across a high plateau, about a mile
or so from Elche, he points at excavations that expose the rich
history of the site known as La Alcudia.
<p>
   He stops first at remains of a Roman villa and an early
Christian church, then heads for the temple devoted to an Iberian
moon goddess. Near there, among the palm trees, a young farm boy
digging an irrigation ditch came upon the Lady in 1897.
<p>
   Now in the laboratory of Alcudia, Ramos points to a statue
recently dug up that was also chipped, and like the Lady shows that
the inside of the stone is snow-white. ``People claiming that the
Lady is a fake are just seeking publicity,'' he said.
<p>
   This dispute and the battle to bring the Lady to Elche continue.
``We will not give up,'' said Noelia Gutierrez, a student at La
Alcudia. ``The whole town will go crazy when she comes.''
<p>
   Oddly, despite the government's ban on travel, the Lady is
expected in the Grand Palais in Paris in September. There she is
billed as one of the leading pieces of the show ``The Iberians.''

   Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Houston Oilers named former
San Diego Chargers assistant Greg Brown their new secondary coach,
the team said.
<p>
   Brown, 39, joins the Oilers after spending two seasons in San
Diego, where he helped the Chargers' secondary improve from 22nd in
the NFL in 1994 to 12th in 1995.
<p>
   Before joining the Chargers, Brown served one season as the
secondary coach for the Atlanta Falcons in 1994, when the team tied
for second in the NFL with 23 interceptions.
<p>
   Brown also spent three seasons (1991-93) as the secondary coach
at the University of Colorado. During his time with the Buffaloes,
he helped tutor two players, Deon Figures and Chris Hudson, who
both went on to win Jim Thorpe Awards as the U.S.'s top collegiate
defensive back.
<p>
   In his first NFL coaching stint, Brown worked three seasons with
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1984-86. He was the defensive
assistant to the Buccaneers' secondary in 1984, the team's quality
control and assistant quarterbacks coach in 1985 and tight ends
coach in 1986.
<p>
   In addition, the Oilers said that assistant coaches Alan Lowry,
Mike Munchak and Russ Purnell will all return for the 1997 season.
<p>
   Lowry will serve as wide receivers coach, Munchak will work one
of the two coaching positions with the offensive line and Purnell
will stay on as the Oilers' special teams coach.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Most securities analysts were unhappy with Pharmacia
&AMP; Upjohn even before the surprise resignation this week of John L.
Zabriskie, the American chief executive of the multinational drug
maker. But a few contrarians saw a brighter side.
<p>
   The share price was already one of the cheapest in the
pharmaceutical sector and after Zabriskie quit it got even cheaper,
dropping $2.75, or 7 percent, on Monday and staying flat through
Wednesday, when it closed at $37.375, down $1.125 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
<p>
   ``It's a good value, great for bottom fishers,'' said Mariola
Haggar, an analyst in New York with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Ms.
Haggar said that based on projected 1997 profits, the price to
earnings ratio of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's stock was 6 percent below
the ratio of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, while drug stocks as a
group were trading at a 20 percent premium to the index.
<p>
   Analysts said the departure of the chief executive would make
little immediate difference to company operations, which are
decentralized and led by strong executives in Kalamazoo, Mich.,
Milan, Italy, and Stockholm.
<p>
   Critics said Zabriskie and his team of senior executives at
company headquarters in London did not push fast enough in knitting
together Upjohn and Pharmacia AB of Sweden in the 14 months since
they merged in November 1995 in a deal valued at $6.9 billion.
<p>
   But Hakan Astrom, a senior vice president, said the company had
cut about $200 million in annual operating costs last year and was
on track to squeeze out $225 million more in 1997, toward its 1998
goal of trimming $500 million.
<p>
   Admittedly looking for a ``silver lining,'' Viren Mehta, a
partner with Mehta &AMP; Isaly, a health care investing firm, projected
three years of annual earnings growth of 17 to 18 percent, from ``a
low base of earnings numbers after a disappointing 1996.''
<p>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn dismayed analysts by twice revising its
profit projections downward last year, most recently in October,
when the company said it had underestimated the adverse effects of
international currency rates. That produced ``a management
credibility issue and concern that management may not be on top of
all parts of the businesses,'' said Robert H. Uhl, an analyst with
Salomon Brothers.
<p>
   He said the stock price would ``remain stuck in the high 30s''
at least for the next three to six months, until problems resulting
from the merger and currency rates were resolved and a new chief
executive named.
<p>
   Sales have been flat but new drug approvals may help. The
company obtained Food and Drug Administration approvals last year
for Xalatan, a treatment for glaucoma, and Camptosar for colon and
rectal cancer, and it introduced Detrusitol, for urinary
incontinence, in Europe. The FDA also recently approved a
nonprescription version of Rogaine, Upjohn's treatment for
baldness. ``The research and development pipeline is beginning to
produce,'' Ms. Haggar said.
<p>
   Scott Shevick, analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., classified the
company as ``the ultimate bomb shelter  &MD;  a stock that does not have
a lot of downside.''
<p>
   It will have lower risks than most other drug stocks if the
market sells off, but it will lag in an up market.'' He added:
``Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn has investor sentiment going against it. The
stock is probably going to be dead money for a while, although
there's a possibility that lightning could strike'' in the form of
outsiders attracted by the low price.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Treasury prices fell Wednesday, as market
participants wrestled with the first of two note auctions this
week, remarks by Federal Reserve officials and fresh economic data,
f The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32 to 95 29/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price rose to 6.82 percent from 6.78 percent on Tuesday.
<p>
   Bond prices were briefly bolstered by a report that showed that
housing starts plunged 12.2 percent in December, a much sharper
than expected decline.
<p>
   ``Housing does appear to be slowing, but at a much more gradual
pace than indicated in today's numbers,'' said Donald Fine, chief
market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
<p>
   Still, he added, ``it may be some time before the current trend
in residential housing can be ascertained because of the continued
impact of the Western floods on the January data, to say nothing of
the subnormal temperatures throughout much of the nation.''
<p>
   The gains in bonds was short-lived, however, as remarks by a Fed
official showed how vulnerable and sensitive the market remains.
<p>
   In an interview Wednesday with the Market News service, Susan
Philips, a Federal Reserve governor, said she might not be willing
to wait for a rise in the ``core'' Consumer Price Index  &MD;  the index
excluding the volatile categories of food and energy  &MD;  before
calling for an increase in interest rates. Some analysts said her
remarks contradicted somewhat the tone of Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, when he spoke before the Senate Budget Committee on
Tuesday.
<p>
   Another report Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's survey of
regional business conditions, known as the Beige book, had little
impact on the Treasury market. The report lacked the numbers to
warrant any inflation concern though it continued to show that wage
pressures are evident for specific skilled workers. Fine of Chase
Asset Management said it did not contain anything more than what
the Fed chairman has already said and merely summerized the last
four weeks of economic data.
<p>
   The Beige book report, however, did have one significant
surprise: it was released inadvertently over the Internet before
its scheduled 2 p.m. release. Traders said the early release might
have influenced the bidding for the new two-year issue, which
caused dealers to pay a higher premium than was expected.
<p>
   The notes were awarded at auction Wednesday at a high yield of
5.984 percent, up from 5.874 percent last month. Analysts said the
bidding was a bit above average and gave the market a brief boost.
<p>
   While the yield on the two's was lower than expected, traders
said it did not necessarily mean the auction was a complete
success, since the higher premium paid by dealers makes it that
more difficult to sell them at an even higher premium. And that
puts a lot of the pressure on the sale of Thursday's five-year note
auction. Some dealers have suggested that the five-year issue may
need a bit more of a concession before the auction takes place.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Securities firms said they had an easier time selling the $2
billion of 20-year global bonds by Argentina Wednesday, as
investors eager for higher yields jumped at the issue.
<p>
   The bonds were sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch
and J.P. Morgan at a price to yield 11.45 percent, or about 426.5
basis points more than the 6.75 percent Treasury note due on Aug.
15, 2026. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
<p>
   In when-issued trading Wednesday, the new five-year note was
being offered at a price to yield 6.31 percent, up 3 basis points
from the previous day. The Treasury's new inflation indexed
securities being sold next Wednesday were offered at a price to
yield 3.37 percent, up 5 basis points.

<p>
   Account activity has been accelerating in the last week across
many consumer product categories. The agency changes and reviews
involve assignments, both domestic and international, with billings
estimated at more than $250 million.
<p>
   One big change was unexpected and came without a review. McNeil
Consumer Product Co., a division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, moved the
account of its Nicotrol anti-smoking patch, with billings estimated
at $41 million, to the Health Care Connection unit of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi Advertising in New York from DDB Needham New York.
<p>
   ``This is a complex marketplace, and we are doing some
consolidation of agencies worldwide,'' said Ronald Schmid, a
spokesman for McNeil in Fort Washington, Pa., who confirmed a
report of the change this week in Advertising Age.
<p>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, owned by Cordiant PLC, handles other McNeil
brands like Tylenol. DDB Needham New York, a unit of Omnicom Group,
had handled Nicotrol patches since 1995. A sibling brand, Nicotrol
nasal spray, remains at DDB Needham Toronto.
<p>
   Several offices of Grey Advertising benefited from decisions
made by advertisers in separate reviews.
<p>
   Grey's Los Angeles office was awarded a four-year contract, with
an optional one-year renewal, for the California Lottery. That
account, with billings estimated at $30 million annually, had been
handled by J. Walter Thompson San Francisco.
<p>
   Jeff Alperin, chief executive of Grey's Western division in Los
Angeles, said that decision came after a three-month review that
had been narrowed to Grey; Thompson San Francisco, part of the WPP
Group, and three other finalists: Asher/Gould in Los Angeles; Rogge
Effler &AMP; Partners in Los Angeles, and Young &AMP; Rubicam San
Francisco.
<p>
   And Globalstar LP, a mobile satellite telephone system in New
York that is managed by Loral Space and Communications Ltd., named
Grey's New York office and its sibling shops there as the first
agencies to handle its integrated account. Billings were estimated
at more than $10 million.
<p>
   Jeanette Clonan, a spokeswoman for Loral in New York, said that
Grey and siblings like the GCI Group public relations agency were
awarded the account after a two-month review. She declined to
identify the three other finalists.
<p>
   Offices of two large agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of
Companies and Cordiant were awarded sizable accounts abroad.
<p>
   Boots Healthcare International in Nottingham, England, has
further expanded its relationship with McCann-Erickson Worldwide,
part of Interpublic, by naming that agency to handle its Strepsils
brand of cough and throat lozenges worldwide. The account, with
billings estimated at $30 million, had been handled primarily by
BMP DDB Needham in London, owned by Omnicom.
<p>
   The McCann London office, which handles Nurofen ibuprofen for
Boots, will coordinate the Strepsils account. McCann London was
also named to handle Optrex eyewash for Boots in Britain and other
markets; that account, with billings that were not disclosed, had
also been handled by BMP DDB.
<p>
   And two offices of Nazca S&AMP;S, the Latin American network of the
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising unit of Cordiant, were awarded two
accounts with combined billings estimated at $25 million.
<p>
   BanCrecer, the fifth-largest Mexican bank, which is part of the
BanCrecer Financial Group in Mexico City, named Nazca S&AMP;S Mexico in
Mexico City to handle its account, which had been at Arellano in
Mexico City.
<p>
   Also, Toyota do Brasil SA in Sao Paulo named F/Nazca S&AMP;S in Sao
Paulo to handle its account, which had been at Fisher Justus in Sao
Paulo. The Nazca network handles Toyota accounts in Argentina,
Puerto Rico and Trinidad.
<p>
   Back in this country, the Hillshire Farm and Kahn's unit of Sara
Lee Corp. named four shops to compete for its account, with
billings estimated at $15 million. Ammirati Puris Lintas in New
York, a unit of Interpublic, handled the account for six years
until the division and the agency agreed to part last week.
<p>
   Kathleen L. Horner, the division's vice president for marketing
in Cincinnati, identified the participants as: D'Arcy Masius Benton
&AMP; Bowles in New York, a unit of MacManus Group; QLM in Princeton,
N.J.; Sive/Young &AMP; Rubicam in Cincinnati, and Euro RSCG Tatham in
Chicago, which is owned by Havas Advertising. A decision is
expected in mid-February, she said.
<p>
   And Autodesk Inc. in San Rafael, Calif., which sells design
software for PC's, began a review for its account, with billings
estimated at $5 million to $10 million. The account had been at
Anderson &AMP; Lembke in San Francisco, a unit of Interpublic.
<p>
   Rick Hooker, managing partner at Pile &AMP; Co. in Boston, a
consulting company handling the review, said Wednesday that seven
agencies had been invited to participate: CKS Partners in San
Francisco, a unit of CKS Group; Euro RSCG Dahlin Smith White in
Salt Lake City, part of Havas Advertising; the FCB Technology Group
of True North Communications in San Francisco; Hodskins Simone &AMP;
Searls in San Francisco; Poppe Tyson in Mountain View, Calif.,
owned by Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &AMP; Eckhardt, and Winkler McManus in
San Francisco.

 &UR; PIZZERIA UNO TO WITHDRAW `LOW-FAT' CLAIMS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   One of the nation's leading restaurant chains, Pizzeria Uno, has
conceded that its previous advertisements for low-fat, thin-crust
pizzas were false and misleading, and has promised the Federal
Trade Commission not to make such claims again.
<p>
   Craig Miller, the president and chief executive officer of Uno
Restaurant Corp., said in a telephone interview that the company
had not thoroughly examined the federal definition of low fat as it
relates to its eight varieties of Thinzetta pizzas. ``This is not
something we intentionally did, and the FTC agreed,'' Miller said.
``Low-fat pizza is a pretty strong statement, and our Thinzettas
are not low fat. Only a few of them qualify.''
<p>
   The consent agreement with the FTC, which the company signed in
October, is not an admission of guilt; the company promises to stop
whatever it has been accused of doing.
<p>
   The company, which is based in Massachusetts and has 156 outlets
nationwide, ran a print advertising campaign in 1995 touting its
``low-fat thin-crust pizzas.'' A television commercial broadcast
during the same period referred to ``great tasting, low-fat,
thin-crust pizzas.''
<p>
   The commission said in a complaint filed last October that six
of the thin-crust pizzas, called Thinzettas, did not meet the
federal definition of low fat  &MD;  3 grams of fat per serving  &MD;  since
they contained 14 to 36 grams of fat per serving.
<p>
   ``The consumer needs to be able to rely on food and nutrition
claims,'' said Lee Peeler, the associate director for advertising
practices in the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
``Around 1990, we started giving priority to these claims.''
<p>
   During the 1980s, the commission's enforcement activity dropped
dramatically; states' attorneys general took over much of the work.
Between 1980 and 1990, the commission settled only two cases of
deceptive advertising. Since 1990 the commission has settled 24
cases.
<p>
   In two recent cases, three companies that sell the dietary
supplement chromium picolinate signed consent agreements
acknowledging unsubstantiated claims about the product's ability to
help people lose weight. And Ross Products, a division of Abbott
Laboratories, signed a consent agreement in which it agreed it
would no longer make false and unsubstantiated claims about
doctors' recommendations for Ensure, a nutritional supplement.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Amid a dormitory-building spree that has made it one
of the biggest developers in Greenwich Village, New York University
now finds itself in the position of trying to resurrect a ghost of
New York culture: Luchow's restaurant, the elegant German
restaurant and beer hall that became a cultural icon in the 1890s.
<p>
   NYU plans to build a dorm for 600 undergraduates at East 14th
Street and Irving Place, the site of Luchow's for 100 years,
starting in 1882. With that will be a street-level cafe, with Gay
'90s theme, one floor above a student cafeteria.
<p>
   ``The idea is to re-echo some of the past glory of 14th
Street,'' said Dr. L. Jay Oliva, the university's president. He
said NYU hopes to remind New York that 14th Street, now a cut-rate
shopping district, once was the epicentor of Manhattan cuisine and
clubbish culture, home not only to Luchow's but also to Delmonico's
and the Academy of Music.
<p>
   The cafe, to be called Luchow's if legal permission is obtained,
will include furniture and prints from the old restaurant, if they
can be found. Luchow's moved to midtown in 1982 and closed a few
years later.

 &UR; A TOP CANADIAN VISITS CUBA, NETTLING WASHINGTON &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   HAVANA  &MD;  In a brief visit that clearly signaled the sharp
divisions between the United States and Canada over how to deal
with Cuba, Canada's foreign minister dined with President Fidel
Castro and other Cuban officials on Tuesday before signing joint
declarations Wednesday on human rights and foreign investment.
<p>
   In Washington, meanwhile, the State Department criticized the
overnight visit by Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, the
highest-ranking Canadian to set foot in Cuba in more than 20 years.
<p>
   ``It doesn't make sense to reward a dictator in our hemisphere
who is completely behind the times,'' said the State Department
spokesman, Nicholas Burns, even before Axworthy had arrived in
Havana on Tuesday. ``You reward him by sending your foreign
minister down there, by having visits as usual, by trading. We
think that's wrong.''
<p>
   Wednesday, however, the State Department tempered its response,
with Burns expressing ``the highest personal respect for Minister
Axworthy.'' He reserved critical remarks for Cuba, voicing
skepticism that its government was prepared to take ``systematic
and meaningful steps that would lead to a transition to democratic
rule.''
<p>
   Axworthy, who has been a vocal critic of American policy toward
Cuba and the Clinton administration's attempt last year to toughen
its longstanding economic embargo by signing the Helms-Burton Act,
called the trip the culmination of a yearlong series of meetings
between senior Canadian and Cuban officials. He said it probably
signals even closer relations between the two countries, as Canada
tries to play a greater role in the hemisphere.
<p>
   ``Cuba comes up on our radar scope as a much higher priority
than before,'' Axworthy said in an interview Tuesday. ``Canadians
are discovering a whole new world south of our southern neighbor.''
<p>
   The substance of the visit consisted of a mildly worded joint
statement issued Wednesday before Axworthy's departure saying that
Canada would help Cuba do more to respect human rights, but
containing no mechanism to force the Cuban government to do so. The
countries agreed to cooperate on human rights by preparing seminars
and exchanging human rights experts. The statement also pledged
greater protection for foreign investments.
<p>
   But those declarations were secondary to the imagery of the
visit, which came just just hours after the end of festivities for
President Clinton's second inaugural.
<p>
   Axworthy spent much of the time meeting with Cuban Foreign
Minister Roberto Robaina. Robaina was clearly elated to be host to
the most senior Canadian official to be received in Havana since
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1976, a visit that was as much an
annoyance to the United States as this trip is now.
<p>
   ``Your country does not share the policy of isolation and
blockade,'' Robaina said to Axworthy at the start of the brief
working session that preceded the state dinner. ``And our country
is grateful for that.''
<p>
   Castro warmly welcomed Axworthy to the ornate Palace of the
Revolution for a formal dinner Tuesday evening of lobster cocktail
and baby lamb chops, topped off by expensive Cuban cigars.
<p>
   Castro also had lunch with the Canadian officials Wednesday
afternoon. Reporters were banned from both meetings, but as the
Cuban leader was leaving the Canadian ambassador's residence he
said that the visit had produced ``better understanding of each
other and lots of good conversation.''
<p>
   ``We talked of many thing, many things, but among friends,''
Castro said in pointed reference to the unwillingness of the United
States to deal directly with Cuba. ``Among friends you can talk
about everything.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Earlier in the day, Axworthy had been taken by Cuban officials
to an oil-drilling operation in the beach resort of Varadero that
had been taken over recently by a Canadian company, Sherritt
International. A huge American-made Caterpillar motor sat there,
along with several mud pumps that were clearly marked as having
been made in the United States, all in Cuba in violation of the
economic blockade.
<p>
   Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage seemed to best capsulize the
importance of the visit when he said that the presence of the
American equipment at a Canadian project in Cuba showed how
ineffective the U.S. blockade had been.
<p>
   ``Canada is showing that it is possible to be a friend of the
United States and of Cuba too,'' Lage said.
<p>
   Canada and the United States have been at odds over Cuba since
the first days of the Cuban revolution 38 years ago. Washington has
tried to isolate Cuba and Castro diplomatically, while imposing
increasingly restrictive economic blockades.
<p>
   Clinton had shown signs of being willing to negotiate more
directly with Cuba until two Cuban MiGs shot down a pair of unarmed
civilian planes flown by anti-Castro dissidents from Miami in
February 1996. Under pressure from Cuban-Americans, the president
then shifted direction and signed the Helms-Burton Act, which seeks
to punish foreign businessmen, including Canadians, who do business
with Cuba.
<p>
   For its part, Canada never severed its diplomatic and commercial
ties with the island, arguing that close contact, rather than
isolation, would help move Cuba toward democracy.
<p>
   Canada enjoys a substantial and growing trade with Cuba, with
Canadian businesses investing in hotels, restaurants and other
businesses that have been closed to companies from the United
States.
<p>
   Last year, two-way trade between Canada and Cuba exceeded $430
million and was growing by more than 10 percent a year. Canada
sends down machinery, wheat and other products and buys lobsters,
sugar and nickel from Cuba.
<p>
   Canadians are also among the largest groups of tourists to Cuba,
with 156,000 visiting last year, a 10 percent increase over 1995.
<p>
   In addition, Canada provides financial support to several
non-governmental organizations in Cuba, including the Centro Felix
Varela, which lobbies for sustainable development and homosexual
rights, among other issues, but not broader political change.
<p>
   ``If what the U.S. Congress wants is to see changes take place
in Cuba  &MD;  and we support those changes, but go about it in a
different way  &MD;  I can't see what they have to complain about,''
Axworthy said.
<p>
   ``The whole thing is a ruse,'' said Marc Thiessen, a spokesman
for Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and a sponsor of Helms-Burton. ``If Mr.
Axworthy thinks that coming away with a piece of paper signed by
Castro is going to make one bit of difference, then I have a bridge
I can sell him.``
<p>
   The Helms-Burton Act has created a rift between the United
States and its closest allies while prompting Cuban retaliation.
Earlier this month, Cuba passed tough new measures that would
punish any Americans who filed a suit under the Helms-Burton Act by
excluding them from any future compensation for expropriated
property.
<p>
   On Jan. 3, Clinton delayed for a second six-month period the
part of the act that would have allowed Cuban-Americans to file
such suits against foreign businessmen who have taken over property
once owned by American companies in Cuba.
<p>
   Canada has adopted measures to block the impact of the law. It
also has threatened to bring a complaint against the United States
because the Helms-Burton Act violates the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which guarantees free passage of businessmen in the
United States, Canada and Mexico, the three countries that signed
the agreement.
<p>
   Officials of Sherritt International have been denied entry to
the United States because the company runs a huge nickel-smelting
operation in Cuba that was owned by the American company
Freeport-McMoRan of New Orleans before the 1959 revolution.
<p>
   Axworthy said no decision had yet been made to go forward with
the complaint.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Senate confirmed William Cohen as defense
secretary by a 99-0 vote Wednesday after Cohen, the former
Republican senator, predicted at a good-natured confirmation
hearing that he would sometimes differ with President Clinton on
national security policy.
<p>
   Cohen, the only Republican in the new Cabinet, clung to
positions during the hearing that sometimes differed with Clinton's
over the last four years.
<p>
   Addressing the Armed Services Committee on which he served for
18 years, the former senator implicitly criticized the
administration for not establishing a definite ``exit strategy''
for U.S. forces in Bosnia. And he said he would resist any move to
trim the defense budget further.
<p>
   Still, he promised that he would work behind the scenes and be a
good team player. Trying to balance expressions of loyalty and
independence, Cohen said that he would not tinker with the
administration's most basic military doctrine of preparing to fight
for two major regional conflicts simultaneously but that he would
urge spending more for procurement of advanced weapons. He also
announced that he would travel to Europe in the next few weeks to
try to persuade allies of the United States to assume the full
burden of the Bosnia peacekeeping operation by the middle of next
year.
<p>
   ``Uniformity of opinion within an administration is not an
imperative nor even an ideal to be sought,'' he said in his
prepared remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``If I am
confirmed, I am certain that, on occasion, there will be
differences of views amongst us.''
<p>
   Cohen could hardly have faced a friendlier reception from a
panel he left after deciding not to seek re-election last year. His
Republican colleague from Maine, Sen. Olympia Snowe, noted that
``introducing Bill Cohen to the Armed Services Committee is a
little like introducing Cal Ripkin to the Baltimore Orioles.''
<p>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., teased Cohen about his
long-winded questioning as a senator and his taste for leather
bomber jackets when visiting military bases.
<p>
   Republican members repeatedly praised Clinton during the hearing
for selecting a Republican for what is commonly considered the
second-most-senior Cabinet post.
<p>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said it was ``an act of political
courage by the President to appoint a proven Republican warrior.''
<p>
   Sen. Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, predicted that Clinton and Cohen
would have their share of disputes. ``It will not be easy for
either of you,'' he said, ``but it will be good for the country.''
<p>
   As a senator, Cohen sharply riticized the Clinton
administration's interventions in Haiti and Bosnia, along with the
expansion of the U.S. military mission in Somalia, without gaining
prior approval from Congress. He is taking to the Pentagon four of
his top Senate aides to form a Republican inner circle.
<p>
   Just hours after the hearing, Cohen was confirmed by a unanimous
vote, with only Sen. John D. Rockefeller 4th, D-W.Va., not present
to vote.
<p>
   In his spoken and written responses to questions from the Armed
Services Committee, Cohen gave ample hints of his priorities. He
said he wanted to expand NATO over the next several years to
include several countries of the former Warsaw Pact, but not
without fully consulting with Russia.
<p>
   He urged more spending on developing and acquiring high-tech
weapons systems, even if that means some further reductions in
force size. He said the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction was the most serious threat the country faces.
<p>
   Cohen also expressed interest in combating international crime
and drug trafficking, two enemies the armed forces have not always
been eager to battle.
<p>
   He said the United States should not only maintain its troop
presence in Asia, but also expand ``our security engagement in the
region.''
<p>
   ``I intend to give new focus to our security relations in the
Asia-Pacific region,'' Cohen said. ``Beyond the near-term threat
from North Korea, our interests are potentially jeopardized by the
danger of instability and rivalry among major regional powers.''
<p>
   He pledged that U.S. servicemen would leave Bosnia in 18 months,
adding, ``we are not going to make an unlimited commitment to that
region.''
<p>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sought firm assurances that the
administration would not further extend the U.S. military presence
in Bosnia past next spring. ``I really am concerned about a
situation, 18 months from now, where we say `Oh, by the way, our
European friends will not agree to remain if we leave, and we're
going to have to stay longer.' Does that scenario concern you?''
<p>
   Cohen responded, ``It does concern me, Senator McCain.''

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds fell as the dollar
rose to a 47-month high versus the yen, dimming the allure of
yen-denominated assets.
<p>
   The dollar climbed to 119.32 yen this morning, pushed higher
after by U.S. economic strength and confidence other leading
industrial nations won't block its rise. The dollar last traded for
118.93 yen.
<p>
   ``The rapid pace of the yen's weakening is not positive for
domestic bonds,'' said Shinji Koyama, a manager at Toyo TB
Securities Co.
<p>
   The lead bond futures contract for March delivery was down 0.22
yen to 126 yen. The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year
government bond rose 2 basis points to 2.41 percent.
<p>
   Shunji Sakami, chief strategist at LTCB Securities Co., said the
impact of the dollar's gains against the yen could be mitigated as
stock prices stabilize.
<p>
   This morning, the Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index was up 53.50
yen, or 0.3 percent, to 18,067 as electronics shares rose on the
stronger dollar.
<p>
   ``If confidence sets in that stocks won't fall much further
through the end of the fiscal year, concern over the need to lock
in returns from bonds will ease,'' he said.
<p>
   Sakami said comments yesterday from Bank of Japan Gov. Yasuo
Matsushita will likely have little impact on bonds this morning.
Matsushita, who was speaking after a gathering this week of the
central bank's branch managers, said the central bank will keep
interest rates low to bolster the economic recovery will
<p>
   The governor also said the economic recovery, while still
moderate, is gaining momentum.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Now this was embarrassing.
<p>
   Patriots coach Bill Parcells and owner Bob Kraft, pretending to
like one another, Wednesday put on one of the lamest shows in the
history of Super Bowl week.
<p>
   It was dumb and dumber. A real head-scratcher. Remember Admiral
James Stockdale opening a 1992 vice presidential debate by saying,
``Who am I, why am I here?''? That's what this was like.
<p>
   Football fans no doubt are tired of the ``Parcells is leaving''
topic. Most of the international media was ready to let it die. But
for some reason Kraft thought he could do a little soft-shoe
routine with Bill to diffuse the controversy and convince us that
they're really pals.
<p>
   So they came out with a shtick, like George Steinbrenner and the
late Billy Martin, or Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson.
<p>
   It was awful, a real groaner.
<p>
   Parcells spoke first. This is what he said:
<p>
   ``Bob and I thought we would address you kind of jointly here
for a minute and I'll stay on to answer any football questions that
you might have. You know, there's been a little bit, kind of
swirling around here, so my final statement is the same as it has
been  &MD;  Bob and I agreed a long time ago that we would go through
this year and we would discuss the situation about the future when
the season's over. And we're gonna do that as expeditiously as
possible and I also can assure you that it's going to be done in a
very civil and friendly manner. That was our agreement and that's
what we're gonna do as soon as this season's over. OK? Bob has a
little something to say to you.''
<p>
   Kraft moved to the microphone as Parcells stepped back. The
owner said:
<p>
   ``Thank you very much, Bill. I'm glad he set me up this way
because we negotiated all night and I'm happy to announce that Bill
Parcells will be the new manager, he signed a 10-year contract to
be the new manager of our paper and packaging group, Rand-Whitney
and International Forest Products. And because you know he manages
money so well, he also will be the chief executive of our Chestnut
Hill Management.
<p>
   ``It's meant a great deal to me that he's done that and I asked
for his input on our new sideline coach and his recommendation is
that it would be Mickey Corcoran as soon as he gets his knees done.
So it's really great to know that we have that kind of commitment.
<p>
   ``Also, I thanked him for one thing. With everything that has
been stirred up over the last week, three years ago and one day, we
bought the team, and here we are in the Super Bowl. There's a
pretty special karma going on and we're excited about it. And I
thank you for this opportunity.''
<p>
   We kept waiting. Where was the laugh track? Is this how Pat
Whitley and Marjorie Clapprood got started? Did Kraft actually
think this was funny or in any way a display of the close
owner-coach relationship?
<p>
   Kraft walked off the stage. Then Parcells went back to the mike
and actually tried to keep it going. Listen to this knee-slapper
from the Tuna:
<p>
   ``That's the last I'm saying about it. And I also say as the new
manager of  &MD;  what is the that name of that, Bob?  &MD;  my first
managerial decision will be to shut down the most productive plant
in Connecticut because of the high fringe benefit expenses that we
have down there, so we're just going to take the biggest production
plant right out ot play.
<p>
   ``Any football questions?''
<p>
   Whoa. That was it. What we all needed at this point was a
Patriot official to hand out paper bags to put over our heads. No
such luck.
<p>
   ``Which one was the dog and which one was the pony?'' a reporter
wondered aloud.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a Japanese TV crew asked, ``Who is this new coach,
Mickey Corcoran?'' (William ``Mickey'' Corcoran was Parcells' high
school basketball coach.)
<p>
   As Parcells fielded football questions, Kraft walked into the
wings and answered queries from TV crews.
<p>
   ``What was this all about?'' was the theme of the session.
<p>
   ``People have sort of intimated that we don't have a good
personal relationship,'' said Kraft. ``I just don't think that's
true. We've had a lot of fun together. We've had good times
together. Wednesday when we were chatting, and it seemed to get a
little intense, so people thought we didn't have a good time
together, he said, `Come on, why don't you join me at my press
conference tomorrow?' We said we'd do that. We've had fun together.
I don't think I've ever had a real serious argument with him in all
the time he's been here. It's basically an agent- and/or
media-induced topic.''
<p>
   Parcells' version, naturally, is different. He has told friends
that the joint session was Kraft's idea. It's hard to imagine that
the Tuna could have created this scene. But why allow himself to be
part of it?
<p>
   The coach and the owner might as well have been Larry Flynt and
Rev. Jerry Falwell. They could have been JFK and Lyndon Johnson.
<p>
   Frozen smiles and unfunny jokes won't help the situation. Kraft
has to start looking for a new coach. And he might want to hire a
joke writer before he tries another stunt like Wednesday's.

 &UR; SENATE CONFIRMS ALBRIGHT AS SECRETARY OF STATE &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Madeleine Albright, who was confirmed on Wednesday
by the Senate as secretary of state by a vote of 99-0, has chosen
two highly experienced government hands for top jobs in the State
Department.
<p>
   Thomas Pickering, 65, the senior professional diplomat in the
Foreign Service, will return after a short retirement to become
under secretary for political affairs, the third-ranking job in the
State Department, Clinton administration officials said. He will
replace Peter Tarnoff.
<p>
   Stuart Eizenstat, 54, a Georgian who ran domestic policy for
President Carter and serves as under secretary of commerce for
international affairs, will become under secretary for economic
affairs in the State Department. He succeeds Joan Spero.
<p>
   Albright, 59, is expected to be sworn in by President Clinton on
Thursday, the first woman to be secretary of state. By choosing
people of such stature for the two appointments, she is understood
to be sending a signal to other government departments that she
intends that the State Department play the leading foreign-policy
role on issues like Mexico, China and Japan, which have had strong
economic components.
<p>
   The Senate vote ``signals a new era of bipartisan foreign
policy, and I can't wait to get started,'' Albright told reporters
at the American Mission to the United Nations in New York, where
she has been serving as American delegate.
<p>
   With Pickering, who had perhaps the most successful career of
any professional diplomat of his generation, Albright is sending an
encouraging message to the Foreign Service officers who are the
backbone of the State Department.
<p>
   Albright's predecessor, Warren Christopher, was sometimes
criticized for letting the Treasury and Commerce Departments, in
particular, take the dominant position in policy formulation toward
Asia and Latin America.
<p>
   Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, a close friend of
Clinton's and a prime architect of the administration's policy
toward the former Soviet Union and NATO, will remain in his post
for the present. Talbott, who has been managing the parallel task
of NATO expansion and negotiating a document governing NATO's
strategic relationship with Russia, is expected to stay at least
through July, when the alliance will announce its new members at a
Madrid summit conference.
<p>
   Pickering stepped down in November as ambassador to Russia after
more than 30 years with the State Department. He was first named an
ambassador in 1974, when he served in Jordan, and has also been
ambassador to Nigeria, El Salvador, Israel and the United Nations.
<p>
   Pickering returned to Washington to become director of the
Eurasia Foundation, a small, nonprofit organization that works with
the post-Soviet states. He is said to have agonized over leaving
the foundation so quickly, but both Albright and Clinton asked him
to take the new job, which he had sought before his retirement.
<p>
   Eizenstat, who has also served as American envoy to the European
Union, has recently been managing a difficult task: trying to
persuade the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other crucial
American allies to join Washington in isolating Fidel Castro's
Cuba, as called for in the Helms-Burton law, which the president
signed last year.
<p>
   While the European Union still objects to Washington's effort to
place sanctions on European companies and business executives for
otherwise legal trading ties to Cuba, Eizenstat has succeeded in
getting the Europeans to take a more vocal public stance against
Cuban human-rights abuses, enabling Clinton to renew a waiver of
the most contentious part of the law. That section would allow
American citizens to bring suit in American courts against foreign
companies that operate in property expropriated from Americans,
without compensation, when Castro took power nearly 40 years ago.
<p>
   In other important positions, Stanley Roth, who had served as
the Asia director in Clinton's National Security Council before
joining the U.S. Institute of Peace, a federally financed research
institute, is expected to be named assistant secretary for East
Asia, replacing Winston Lord.
<p>
   Albright's chief of staff will be Elaine Shocas, a former
federal prosecutor and counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
who served her in the same job at the United Nations. Her spokesman
there, James Rubin, 36, a former aide to Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,
D-Del., will become assistant secretary for public affairs.

 &UR; SIMPSON'S LAWYER ACCUSES PLAINTIFFS OF SEEKING MONEY, NOT JUSTICE &LR;  &QL; 
(sw) &QL; 
 &UR; By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR. &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif.  &MD;  O.J. Simpson's lawyer asserted on
Wednesday that the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend
Ronald Goldman were seeking money, not justice, when they filed
their wrongful-death suit against the former sports and
entertainment personality.
<p>
   ``This isn't a fight for justice but a fight about Mr. Simpson
transferring dollars,'' the lawyer, Robert Baker, said in winding
up his defense of Simpson in the four-month-long civil trial.
<p>
   In any case, Baker went on, the plaintiffs failed to make their
case, especially their promise to demonstrate that Simpson killed
the two in June 1994 in a rage over failure to reconcile with his
former wife.
<p>
   The case is set to go to the jury on Thursday.
<p>
   His final presentation sometimes laconically rambling, sometimes
tightly focused and tinged with emotion, Baker said that in their
effort to wring money from Simpson, the plaintiffs' lawyers had
``twisted'' just about every fact and and every piece of testimony
presented at the trial.
<p>
   ``If you find him not responsible,'' Baker told the jury, ``the
gravy train is over.''
<p>
   In their suit, the plaintiffs left it up to jurors to fix the
amount of money Simpson should pay in recompense should they
conclude that he committed the killings.
<p>
   Baker argued that there was an ``enormous gaping hole'' in the
case as presented by the plaintiffs' legal team, which wound up its
arguments earlier on Wednesday except for brief rebuttal on
Thursday.
<p>
   ``You can't put sympathy, passion and prejudice in your
verdict,'' Baker told the jury soon after the plaintiffs' lawyers
closed their arguments with poetic readings and saddening film and
sound bites of the murder victims.
<p>
   ``You have just been subjected to a ploy for your sympathy,''
Baker warned. ``We have witnessed character assassination. Give me
a break!''
<p>
   The plaintiffs, he said, may have argued emotionally but, he
insisted, had failed to make their case on a motive.
<p>
   ``There was no obsession,'' Baker insisted. ``That's a stretch,
a quantum leap. It's part of an effort by the plaintiffs to
demonize and manufacture a motive.''
<p>
   Then, arguing that Simpson could not have been at the crime
scene at the hour the plaintiffs had placed him, the lawyer offered
a bit of courtroom rhyme of his own.
<p>
   ``I'm no poet,'' he said, ``but obviously if you don't have time
you most certainly can't commit the crime.''
<p>
   Baker also argued that the plaintiffs had chosen to ignore
evidence offered by the defense team that the Los Angeles police
had bungled the Simpson investigation.
<p>
   ``They talk about the results of blood testing,'' he said,
sarcasm rising in his voice. ``We talk about contamination. What
did they do with that blood?''
<p>
   The earlier criminal trial, which ended in Simpson's acquittal
in October 1995, was tried along much the same lines as the civil
case and included occasional offerings of rhyme.
<p>
   Baker argued that police bungling, some of it perhaps
deliberate, had been a critical factor in the criminal case and
should also be a critical factor in the civil trial.
<p>
   ``I didn't hear one word about it from the plaintiffs,'' he
said, ``but it has been in this case from Day One. Police witnesses
have contradicted each other. They have lied from the witness
stand. There is an immense amount wrong with the evidence and
that's not going to go away because they don't want to talk about
it.''
<p>
   Earlier in the day, as the plaintiffs' lawyers ended their
closing arguments  &MD;  except for final, brief rebuttal on Thursday  &MD; 
the lead member of the team, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that
Simpson's guilt could be proved very easily.
<p>
   ``One drop of blood,'' he said, referring to analysis of blood
found at the slaying scene that indicated it had come from Simpson.
<p>
   ``You don't need any more than that,'' Petrocelli went on. ``He
is guilty. He is the killer. And he's got nowhere to run anymore.''
<p>
   Still, he presented more, including a list of some 60 witnesses
and documents that he argued would all have to be found to be
either liars or fakes in order for Simpson to be cleared. ``For him
to be believed,'' he said of Simpson, ``you have to disbelieve all
of it.''
<p>
   Noting that the jury, should it find Simpson guilty, would then
determine how much money he should pay the families of the victims
in recompense, he said:
<p>
   ``There is no amount of money that is ever going to repay for
what has been lost. True justice would be to see Ron Goldman walk
through the doors of this courtroom and to see Nicole Simpson
playing again with her children.''
<p>
   He paused, then turned from the jury and fixed a hard eye on
Simpson.
<p>
   ``But that's not going to happen, not going to happen,''
Petrocelli said, pointing an accusatory finger at Simpson.
<p>
   Simpson stared back, his face an impassive mask.

<p>
   Astronaut John Blaha, who Wednesday returned to Earth weakened
from a four-month voyage aboard Russia's Mir space station, got
what he longed for most  &MD;  a speedy reunion with his wife, Brenda.
<p>
   The couple was reunited at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida shortly after the shuttle Atlantis, with the 54-year-old
veteran astronaut aboard, touched down.
<p>
   ``It was great,'' Brenda Blaha said in a telephone interview
that followed the couple's first face-to-face meeting since his
Sept. 16 liftoff. ``The first thing he did was have me give him a
big smack (kiss).''
<p>
   A former Air Force combat pilot and a veteran of four previous
space missions, Blaha said he was startled by the draining effects
of his stay on Mir. He was too weak to walk or stand without
assistance.
<p>
   ``I'm absolutely stunned by the condition I'm in right now. I
can't believe it,'' Blaha said. ``When (Atlantis) stopped, I
couldn't even raise my leg. It wouldn't even move.''
<p>
   Blaha has admitted in recent days that he suffered a mild period
of depression during the mission and missed his wife terribly.
<p>
   ``I don't even have any plans other than private time with
Brenda,'' Blaha said. ``Cause I missed her. I really missed her.''
<p>
   Blaha's unusually candid assessment of the less glamorous side
of spaceflight was made several hours after Atlantis touched down
at 9:23 a.m. EST. He spoke Wednesday while seated in a recliner as
his wife and daughter, Carolyn, stood nearby. At one point, he
stood briefly with their assistance.
<p>
   Blaha said he would never consider such a long voyage again.
``After one month, I kept longing for things that I loved here (on
Earth). I finally decided I had to forget them. When I did, then I
loved being on the station,'' he said. ``I had to work at
forgetting them, and I had to work at forgetting Brenda. That
shocked me. I didn't expect that kind of thing.''
<p>
   In spite of his travails, Blaha said he felt great physically
while in weightlessness. He formed a strong friendship with Mir
cosmonauts Valeri Korzun and Alexander Kaleri, whom he barely knew
before the mission. The pair replaced the two cosmonauts with whom
Blaha had trained extensively in Russia, after one developed a
heart ailment.
<p>
   Blaha was carried from the shuttle by National Aeronautics and
Space Administration medical personnel. His predecessors on Mir,
Shannon Lucid and Norm Thagard, walked from the shuttle under their
own power.
<p>
   Blaha's crew mates characterized the assistance as something the
veteran astronaut chose rather than required. ``That was totally
John's decision,'' said Atlantis flight engineer John Grunsfeld.
``He wanted the docs to get the best possible data they could. He's
a real trouper. I'm sure he wanted to get up and walk off.''
<p>
   The flight surgeons and scientists who study the range of
changes that occur to space marathoners have urged the fliers to
recline after their return to Earth, until a range of medical tests
can be completed. The cardiovascular, neuro-vestibular, muscle,
skeletal, endocrine and immune systems of astronauts are all
weakened or altered by weightlessness.
<p>
   Space agency researchers, however, say the changes are reversed
as the body slowly readapts to gravity.
<p>
   Atlantis commander Mike Baker, pilot Brent Jett, mission
specialists Marsha Ivins and Jeff Wisoff, Blaha and Grunsfeld spent
their first day back on Earth resting and undergoing routine
medical exams. They were scheduled to return to Houston, where the
space agency planned a brief welcoming ceremony, on Thursday.
<p>
   Brenda Blaha said her husband is strong enough to return to his
Houston-area home during rehabilitation. He can stay at medical
facilities at Johnson Space Center, if he and his flight surgeons
believe he requires closer supervision.
<p>
   After he has regained his strength, Blaha said he and his wife
will be ready for a vacation.
<p>
   ``I know that I definitely want one, but it could be at my
house,'' he joked. ``It doesn't matter where I take it.``

<p>
   AT&AMP;T is finally holding on to its customers. Now, if it can just
get more of them to pay their phone bills.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter income from
continuing operations rose 14.2 percent, to $1.24 billion, helped
by a new flat rate-calling plan that has stanched the flow of
customers to other long-distance carriers. But earnings still fell
short of Wall Street analysts' expectations because of higher costs
from unpaid bills.
<p>
   Excluding special items, the company said its earnings rose to
76 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with 68 cents a
share a year earlier. Those results were 3 to 4 cents below the
average forecast of analysts. AT&AMP;T's revenue increased 2.7 percent,
to $13.2 billion.
<p>
   After months of eroding market share and management turmoil, the
stable results were a relief to many analysts who follow AT&AMP;T. But
they noted that the company, the nation's largest long-distance
carrier, still faced a treacherous future, as deregulation opens
its market to competition from the seven regional Bell telephone
companies and GTE.
<p>
   ``Even if they stop the drop in market share of customers, it
doesn't solve their problems in the future,'' said Frank Governali
of CS First Boston.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's shares declined 50 cents Wednesday, to $38.875, in brisk
New York Stock Exchange trading.
<p>
   The company said it had to budget an extra $200 million in the
fourth quarter to cover unpaid bills, primarily from business
customers. Simon Flannery, a telecommunications analyst at J.P.
Morgan, said the cost of covering these bad debts could total $400
million for all of 1997.
<p>
   AT&AMP;T's chief financial officer, Richard Miller, said the
collection problems stemmed from glitches in the company's billing
systems and from a rise in bankruptcies among its corporate
clients. The onset of competition also makes its harder to collect
bills, he said, because customers could now easily jilt AT&AMP;T for a
rival carrier.
<p>
   ``It used to be the case that if you didn't pay your bill, your
service was canceled and you couldn't live with that,'' Miller
said, ``That threat doesn't work as well anymore.''
<p>
   Like other carriers, AT&AMP;T recently began mailing bills directly
to residential customers in some markets, rather than relying on
the Bell companies and GTE to include AT&AMP;T charges as separate
items on their bills. Other long-distance carriers are also
grappling with collection problems, analysts said, as they take on
direct billing responsibility.
<p>
   An executive at AT&AMP;T said Wednesday that the company's billing
systems were coming under sharp scrutiny from the new president,
John Walter, and from Gail McGovern, whom Walter named in December
to take over the company's giant consumer long-distance business.
<p>
   In addition to the billing problem, a 32.3 percent decline in
revenue at the financial services unit, which consists largely of
the AT&AMP;T Universal Card, hurt the company's quarterly earnings.
Though customer accounts increased to 18.3 million in 1996 from
17.6 million in 1995, AT&AMP;T was hurt by declining use and higher
promotional costs.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   AT&AMP;T recently named a former banking executive from Citicorp,
Richard Srednicki, to head the credit card division. Miller said he
expected Srednicki to use his marketing skills to attract more card
holders and to stimulate use by current card holders.
<p>
   Miller pointed out that Wednesday's results were restated to
reflect AT&AMP;T's divestiture of its equipment-manufacturing arm, now
Lucent Technologies, and its computer business, NCR. Including
income from discontinued operations and charges related to the
split-up, AT&AMP;T's fourth-quarter net income was $1.62 billion,
compared with a loss of $2.68 billion a year earlier.
<p>
   Analysts, however, spent most of Wednesday scrutinizing the
figures for AT&AMP;T's core long-distance business. And there, the news
was good: Revenue in the so-called wire line business rose 2.9
percent in the fourth quarter, to $11.5 billion. Part of the gain
came from a 5.9 percent rate increase for basic service, which AT&AMP;T
announced the day before Thanksgiving to howls of protest from
consumer advocates.
<p>
   But the volume of long-distance calls also jumped 6 percent  &MD;  a
sign that AT&AMP;T had slowed the exodus of customers to discount
carriers like LCI International and Excel Communications. The
company said it had signed up nearly three million customers for
its One Rate plan, which offers a flat rate of 15 cents a minute
for long-distance calls anywhere in the United States. A majority
of those people were already on other AT&AMP;T calling plans.
<p>
   In a conference call with analysts, Miller sounded a cautious
note about the future. He said AT&AMP;T would keep a tight rein on
expenses for new ventures like its Internet access service,
Worldnet, and would be selective about plunging into new
businesses. ``Some opportunities will have to be deferred,'' he
said, ``Some we will not pursue.''
<p>
   His restrained tone was characteristic of the approach taken by
Walter, who became president of AT&AMP;T in November after a
well-publicized search led by the company's chairman, Robert Allen.
<p>
   Walter has already indicated that AT&AMP;T would throttle back its
expansion into local telephone service. The company is offering
local service to a handful of customers in Sacramento, Calif., and
intends to introduce service in Connecticut, Illinois and Michigan
in the first half of this year. But it no longer plans to roll out
service in all 50 states in 1997.
<p>
   Still, the newly competitive marketplace may make it hard for
AT&AMP;T to hold back too much. Miller noted that AT&AMP;T still planned to
introduce the new type of wireless phone service called personal
communications services this year.
<p>
   And Governali of First Boston noted, ``They don't have the
luxury of saying they're not going to be competitive.''

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Senate Banking Committee opened hearings
Wednesday on the nomination of Andrew Cuomo as federal housing
secretary, offering a chorus of bipartisan praise for Cuomo and a
round of criticism against the troubled agency that he has been
picked to lead.
<p>
   ``I am privileged to preside over the confirmation of a native
son of New York,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who heads the
committee, ``and I am pleased to support his nomination. The
position of housing and urban development secretary is one of the
toughest positions in government. The new secretary will inherit
serious problems.''
<p>
   For his part, Cuomo said that if confirmed, one of his first
moves would be to reorganize the management and the direction of
the huge agency.
<p>
   ``We must remain committed to our worthwhile goals, but not to
failed means,'' Cuomo said. ``We must be willing to admit that some
programs don't work. We must recognize the roles of government and
the private sector and the partnerships that can be forged.''
<p>
   President Clinton nominated Cuomo, 39, in December to succeed
Henry Cisneros. For the last four years Cuomo has served under
Cisneros as assistant secretary for community planning and
development. Before joining the Clinton administration, Cuomo
headed the New York City Commission on the Homeless and helped
establish and run one of the nation's largest private providers for
transitional housing for the homeless.
<p>
   Cuomo is the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose
defeat in 1994 by George Pataki was largely orchestrated by
D'Amato. But there was not a trace of political rancor Wednesday as
D'Amato presided over a hearing that made clear Cuomo would have
little trouble winning approval from the committee when it votes
Tuesday.
<p>
   Even some of HUD's harshest critics, who are members of the
Banking Committee, refrained from any direct attack on Cuomo.
<p>
   ``HUD has become a massive government bureaucracy,'' said one
critic, Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who sponsored legislation in
the 104th Congress to abolish the department. ``In my opinion and
the opinion of many others, HUD has failed; it has lost sight of
its mission.''
<p>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said, ``HUD has been woefully
mismanaged for too many years,'' and he demanded to know how Cuomo
intended to fix it.
<p>
   Cuomo said: ``HUD's mission cannot be carried out in the future
unless HUD's own house is in good order. I have heard the
committee's concern, and I agree there must be effective management
and financial accountability at HUD.''

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Dan Henning has landed on his feet. We think. He's
employed again, anyway.
<p>
   The former Boston College head coach was introduced in Buffalo
Wednesday as the new offensive coordinator of the Bills. It's a
familiar role for Henning. He also was an NFL offensive coordinator
in Washington and Detroit and has head coaching experience with
Atlanta and San Diego. He also was an assistant at Miami under Don
Shula and with the Jets.
<p>
   During a news conference in Buffalo, Henning said he wasn't
certain what he would do when he left BC. He resigned after three
years at The Heights in the wake of a subpar season and a betting
scandal involving some of his players.
<p>
   ``I went down to visit my daughter in Jekyll Island, Ga., and
asked myself some questions,'' said Henning. ``What did I want to
do? Where did I want to go? Is it a good fit? I've been to a lot of
places and there are places I wouldn't go and couldn't go. When
you've been around like that, you make a lot of friends and you
make some enemies.''
<p>
   Henning, who compiled a 16-19-1 record at BC, made no reference
to the tumult of last season. He resigned Nov. 25 on the heels of a
5-7 campaign and the suspension of 13 of his players for gambling.
<p>
   ``I thought that we handled the situation the way it ought to be
handled,'' he said. ``You hit it head on, you show people you won't
put up with it and you deal with the people involved.
<p>
   ``I think Boston College and the general area of Chestnut Hill
and Newton will be better off because we didn't sweep it under the
table. They're ahead of the curve because there isn't a college
campus where there isn't gambling and bookies.''
<p>
   As for the Eagles' football team, Henning said, ``The first year
I was there, I got there in the middle of March, put a staff
together and had spring practice in 45 days. We went on and won the
Aloha Bowl. Then, I lost some defensive coaches and some good
defensive players and, to boil it down, I did not get it back
together defensively. We went from giving up 14 points to 32.''
<p>
   Henning, who returned to Boston Wednesday night, said he has not
had a chance to meet with Bills players. He added that he would be
the one calling the plays and may get away from the no-huddle
offense.
<p>
   ``I've been around and about the NFL and it's very difficult to
find a place where you feel the kind of comfort I feel in
Buffalo,'' Henning said. ``You look at a lot of things: ownership,
location, the head coach, the organization and professional
comfort. I'm excited to be here.''
<p>
   This season, the Bills went 10-6 and made the playoffs as a wild
card but were bounced out in the first round by the Jacksonville
Jaguars. The previous offensive coordinator, Tom Bresnahan, will
now coach the offensive line.

<p>
   BANGKOK, Thailand  &MD;  Just a few years after they ended their
nuclear arms race, the United States and Russia are locked in a
fierce competition for arms sales to Southeast Asia, with both
countries offering potential purchasers some of the world's most
sophisticated missiles as incentives.
<p>
   From Thailand to Malayasia, countries shopping for advanced
fighter aircraft are demanding  &MD;  and receiving  &MD;  the chance to buy
deadly accurate, air-to-air missiles that allow a jet pilot to
shoot down an enemy plane he can not even see  &MD;  indeed, one that
might be as far as 30 miles away.
<p>
   When Thailand first asked for the missiles, known as AMRAAMS  &MD; 
an acronym for their formal name of advanced medium range
air-to-air missile  &MD;  Clinton administration officials rejected the
request. The officials feared that the sale could cause regional
instability and trigger an arms race.
<p>
   Bangkok immediately said that if the United States blocked the
sale of the missiles, it would not buy American-made F-18 jets, a
pending deal worth nearly $600 million. The Thais made it clear
they were considering the Russian MiG-29, which can carry a similar
missile.
<p>
   Washington eventually capitulated, even though American and Thai
officials say Bangkok did not really want to buy a plane from
Russia.
<p>
   The AMRAAM's journey from a weapon that Washington zealously
protected to one that is now available to a range of countries
illustrates what happens once arms restrictions are relaxed even a
little, American officials and arms control advocates said in
interviews.
<p>
   ``Once we've said `yes' to one, it is hard to say `no' to the
next,'' said an official in Washington.
<p>
   The AMRAAM was one of the most effective weapons for the
American-led alliance that routed Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
<p>
   American officials said this week that the decision to provide
the missile to the Thai Air Force opens the door for other
countries in the Association of South East Asian nations to make
similar requests, although each would still face a case-by-case
review.
<p>
   The sale of AMRAAMS to Thailand is also a telling illustration
of the workings of the global arms bazaar. These days, American
officials say, it is business, not ideology, that is driving sales.
<p>
   During the Cold War, the Pentagon advocated restrictive policies
on arms sales, particularly of sophisticated weapons that might
fall into enemy hands. Now, the military services push the arms
trade as a way of helping defense contractors suffering from
cutbacks.
<p>
   The aim, American officials said, is to drum up sufficient
business to keep the defense manufacturers profitable and ready to
serve the American military.
<p>
   Navy admirals, whose pilots fly the F-18, were among the
earliest advocates of clinching the sale to the Thai Air Force by
including AMRAAMS in the deal.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Just a few years ago, the United States would permit the sale of
AMRAAMS only to NATO allies.
<p>
   Then, in 1995, the United Arab Emirates went shopping for 80
combat jets, a deal worth between $6 billion and $8 billion, which
the oil-rich country could afford, though there were questions
about whether it had enough qualified pilots.
<p>
   The Emirates demanded various types of sophisticated gear for
their planes, and at the top of the list was the AMRAAM, American
officials said.
<p>
   After an intense debate, and over opposition from the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, the Clinton administration agreed.
With that, Lockheed's F-16 has now emerged as the likely winner of
the contract, edging out the French Mirage.
<p>
   After the sale to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand demanded
the same missiles. ``We caved to them as well,'' said a State
Department official in Washington. ``It shows how the threshold
gets passed.''
<p>
   Now, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which have been turned down in the
past on requests for AMRAAMs, are expected to come knocking again.
And this time it will be hard to say no, American officials said
this week.
<p>
   Because of AMRAAM's ``extremely good'' potential to hit aircraft
out of visual range, any air force that has it enjoys a clear
advantage over the enemy, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, a
publication that assesses military weapons systems.
<p>
   In seeking to buy AMRAAMs, the Thais are not preparing for an
imminent war, Western military analysts said. Rather, they are
modernizing their air force in line with Bangkok's status as a
growing economic and political power.
<p>
   ``Even in the absence of a specific threat, the Thais are
correct in their strategic thinking,'' a senior Western military
officer said about Bangkok's purchase of Amraams.
<p>
   The F-18, the French-built Mirage and Russia's MiG-29 all would
have fulfilled Thailand's needs, he and other military analysts
said.
<p>
   The MiG-29 is an extremely good combat plane, and is less
expensive than either the French or American jets. But its
``Achilles heel,'' as one Western military officer put, is that
maintenance and service are not at the same level. And many
countries, including Thailand, are still reluctant to buy from
Russia.
<p>
   The Malaysians bought MiGs three years ago, in large part
because the Russians agreed to offset part of the price with the
purchase of Malaysian palm oil.
<p>
   Similarly, in Thailand, McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of the
F-18, agreed to buy some Thai products  &MD;  from rubber to frozen
chickens  &MD;  in order to sweeten the deal.
<p>
   ``It was a high stakes game,'' said a senior Western military
official in the region. ``Had we called their bluff, it's anyone's
guess what might have happened.''
<p>
   With so much money at stake, Washington was not willing to take
the risk. A senior American diplomat added, ``We couldn't tolerate
a treaty ally buying a Russian jet.''
<p>
   The Thais won't get the missile technology right away, not until
someone else in the neighborhood gets comparable technology. But
that is a question of when, not if, American officials said.
Malaysia already has MiG-29s, and it has promises from Russia for
eventual sale of the sophisticated missiles.

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
shrank 20.6 percent in December from the same month a year ago as
higher oil prices drove up imports, the Finance Ministry said.
<p>
   A senior ministry official said the government expects the
overall trade surplus to shrink more as oil prices rise. He also
said auto exports may continue to rise as the yen weakens against
the dollar.
<p>
   The yen's 8.5 percent decline against the dollar between August
and December led to the third straight monthly increase in Japan's
surplus with the United States. This trend will continue as long as
the yen weakens, economists said.
<p>
   ``The pace of exports to the U.S. will continue because America
has quite robust growth with low inflation,'' said Akio Yoshino,
senior economist at Credit Suisse Asset Management before the
release of the report.
<p>
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States in December rose
7.8 percent to 389.113 billion yen, the ministry said.
<p>
   The smaller-than-expected trade surplus totaled 881.475 billion
yen ($7.4 billion) and has declined for 25 straight months.
Economists said the surplus would be 1.055 trillion yen, according
to a survey compiled by Bloomberg Business News. Projections ranged
from 970 billion yen to 1.145 trillion yen.
<p>
   The trade surplus grew 0.2 percent in November compared to a
year earlier. That figure was later revised to a 0.4 percent
decline.
<p>
   Global imports to Japan rose 13.4 percent to 3.286 trillion yen,
while exports increased 4.0 percent to 4.168 trillion yen, the
ministry said.
<p>
   For all of 1996, Japan's trade surplus fell 32.4 percent to 6.7
trillion yen, the Finance Ministry said. That was fourth straight
yearly decline, and the largest decline in the surplus on record.
<p>
   In yen terms, it was the smallest trade surplus since 1983.
Still, exports and imports both reached record highs. Japan's
exports rose 7.7 percent to 44.734 trillion yen, while imports rose
20.4 percent to 37.990 trillion yen. That was the largest
percentage increase in imports since 1989.
<p>
   The country's full-year trade surplus with the U.S. fell 16.5
percent to 3.6 trillion yen, the second straight yearly decline.
Japan has increased ``reverse imports'' -- goods made at Japanese
factories overseas -- when the yen strengthened against the dollar
in 1994 and 1995. That led to a 21.9 percent increase in imports
from the United States.
<p>
   Japan's surplus with the European Union declined 26.5 percent,
the fourth consecutive decline. Imports of Japanese autos made in
Europe helped reduce the surplus, the government said.
<p>
   Japan's surplus with Asia fell 15.7 percent in 1996, the first
decline in nine years. Weak demand for semiconductors in the region
was the main reason for the decline, the ministry said.

 &UR; JUDGE VOIDS LAW ON MILITARY BASES' SALE OF SEX MATERIAL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (kd) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Wednesday that the
Defense Department could not enforce a law banning the sale of
sexually explicit magazines and videos on military bases because it
violated Constitutional protections for free speech.
<p>
   The law, the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996, forbade
stores and post exchanges on military bases to sell or rent sexual
material. Described in Congress as a measure to promote ``honor,
commitment and courage'' among American troops, the law was
scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this year.
<p>
   The judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court, said
the government could not ban the sale of the material merely
because officials found it offensive.
<p>
   ``While the majority of Americans may wish to ban pornography,
in the final analysis, society is better served by protecting our
cherished right to free speech, even at the cost of tolerating
speech that is outrageous, offensive and demeaning,'' Scheindlin
wrote.
<p>
   ``There is no question that the result of permitting such speech
is often unfortunate and unpleasant,'' she wrote. But our
Constitution has effectively protected us for over two centuries
from living in a society where the government intrudes on our
individual rights by deciding what consenting adults can read or
view.''
<p>
   The ruling was in response to a challenge filed by General Media
International, the parent company of Penthouse magazine, and
publishing trade groups. Unless the government files an appeal,
Scheindlin's decision effectively bans the enforcement of the law.
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White declined to comment on
the decision other than to say that an appeal was under
consideration. The government has 60 days to appeal.
<p>
   Although the decision was primarily based on the First
Amendment, which forbids Congress to make any law abridging freedom
of speech, Scheindlin also said the law was too vague and would
restrict the rights of military personnel. Courts have permitted
this in some areas, but they have required the government to show
that national security interests are served by doing so.
<p>
   ``Citizens do not jettison their constitutional rights simply by
enlisting in the armed forces,'' the judge wrote.
<p>
   Government lawyers had argued that the law would improve the
morale and atmosphere of the armed forces, but the judge's decision
noted that the law would not ban the possession of sexual material
on bases, only its sale.
<p>
   First Amendment experts said the judge's ruling was more an
upholding of traditional court rulings rather than an expansion of
the free speech protections. The courts have long held that the
government has the right to restrict obscene material when it
violates community standards, describes patently offensive sexual
conduct and lacks literary, artistic, political or scientific
value. Yet the plaintiffs and the government lawyers agreed that
the material proposed for banning was not legally obscene.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  They are two old campaigners who were born in
Miami, but they came here from remarkably different rookie
beginnings. And now they stand side by side to try to stem the best
defense in football.
<p>
   Bruce Armstrong, 32, the left tackle, and William Roberts, 34,
the left guard, find it odd that they are anchoring the Patriots'
line at this stage of their careers. Odder still, they are in a
Super Bowl, and all they have to do is help defeat Green Bay on
Sunday to wind up with a Patriots' championship ring neither
believed possible.
<p>
   They will have to help create an offense that can run as well as
pass to unsettle a veteran Green Bay defense that keeps it simple
and is hard to disrupt. Luckily for Armstrong and Roberts, each has
been around so long that he will not become rattled.
<p>
   The other three members of the offensive line  &MD;  center Dave
Wohlabaugh, right guard Todd Rucci and right tackle Max Lane  &MD; 
total less starting experience than Armstrong's 10 seasons.
<p>
   Armstrong is the senior tenured member of the underdog Patriots.
Incredibly, he has played for as many different owners as coaches  &MD; 
four.
<p>
   ``Every time a new owner changed, you hoped it would be
better,'' said Armstrong on Wednesday, reflecting on the
decade-long optimism that finally paid off.
<p>
   ``Some years it felt very transitory. You had the feeling that
football wasn't primary. But when Bob Kraft came you knew what
happened on the field was most important.''
<p>
   And now comes the Packers' Sean Jones. An intelligent,
two-dimensional defensive right end, Jones will be lined up
opposite Armstrong, who is quarterback Drew Bledsoe's primary
protector.
<p>
   ``Green Bay won't change anything on defense,'' Armstrong said.
``They've got the No. 1 defense in the league. We watched every
game they played because we have the extra week. And what I see is
that it'll be their front seven against our front five. They line
them up the same. Their guys want to beat your guys.''
<p>
   Fred Hoaglin, the Patriots' offensive line coach, tutored
Roberts when both were with the Giants and has overseen Armstrong
here. This is a different operation from Giants' teams, though  &MD; 
especially compared to the one that captured Super Bowl XXV six
years ago. Those Giants had an offense based on ball possession,
with running back Otis Anderson wearing down the opposition on
repeated rushes.
<p>
   Roberts worked hand in glove with Coach Bill Parcells on the
Giants. Of his 13 seasons in the National Football League, Roberts
spent the first 11 with the Giants. He was a key player in their
two Super Bowl victories (1987 and 1991) and became increasingly
frustrated by their decline.
<p>
   ``The core of players that we had, I felt we could have repeated
and three-peated,'' he said.
<p>
   He remembered Giants teams that wore you down, and he remembered
offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt ``getting into a rhythm with the
team and just making the same call after call after call  &MD;  run.''
<p>
   Now, this New England team is in strange territory  &MD;  for both
Roberts and Parcells. There is a quarterback in Bledsoe who has
reached 14,000 yards faster than anyone in NFL history. The Pats
also have a running back, Curtis Martin, who has scored in 15
straight games.
<p>
   ``We have to work harder to keep a drive alive on the
Patriots,'' Roberts said. ``If you pass on first down, then pass on
second down, you have to pass on third down. We have the talent to
be one-dimensional, but you want to be two-dimensional against
Green Bay. They get good pressure from their strong safety, and
then they force you to pass. But when we're two-dimensional, we're
very successful. One-dimensional, we're successful  &MD;  to a point.''
<p>
   Now Roberts, to help create that two-dimensional offense, must
help handle the 325-pound defensive tackle Gilbert Brown, the
biggest player on Super Bowl Sunday. ``Brown will be the biggest,
strongest guy we'll have to face,'' said Hoaglin.
<p>
   The Patriots' offensive coordinator, Ray Perkins, said: ``The
main thing I want our line to know on Sunday is to know what to
do.''
<p>
   He knows there are two players he can count on.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  If you are a wide receiver and your career needs a
pick-me-up, pack those bags and go to Green Bay.
<p>
   Take Andre Rison. He became known as the bad boy who dated
rappers when he was with the Atlanta Falcons and had his house
burned down by a member of the group TLC. On his passing routes he
would zig when he was supposed to zag. Dateline Cleveland: He had
made the Pro Bowl four times as a Falcon, but he was
unceremoniously dumped after one season by the Browns. Dateline
Jacksonville: Rison and Coach Tom Coughlin? That was like Madonna
and Tipper Gore being pals.
<p>
   So he was cut by the Jaguars last November and was claimed off
waivers by the Packers. Offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said
Rison has been a model citizen and good player.
<p>
   ``I think what got everybody mad at me was that the Browns gave
me such a big contract,'' said Rison, referring to his troubles,
which began in 1995. ``My productivity went down, but they weren't
throwing me the ball. The media didn't have the guts to say that I
wasn't getting the ball.''
<p>
   Then there's Don Beebe. He played in three Super Bowls with the
Buffalo Bills and is probably best known for coming from behind
Leon Lett and knocking the ball out of his hands, a move that
threatened to knock Lett into Super Bowl infamy. But Beebe's career
otherwise was fairly nondescript. Then came the Oct. 14 game
against San Francisco in which he had 11 catches for 220 yards, the
third most receiving yards for a single game in Packers' history.
<p>
   What has been his secret? ``He can take a hit, and he's
extremely fast,'' said Lewis. ``And you know what? I think
defensive backs look at him and say, `Who's this little white guy?
He can't run.' Then by the time they realize how fast he is, it's
too late.''
<p>
   And there is one more piece in this weird Packers receiving
puzzle: Desmond Howard, Mr. Heisman Trophy himself. He was drafted
by the Washington Redskins in 1992, then became known as someone
who couldn't escape off the line, was soft, didn't work hard and
fell asleep in meetings. Now, he is known as a great punt returner
and solid receiver.
<p>
   And no, Howard is not holding back his feelings about the
Redskins. ``Of course, they won't admit they made a mistake in
releasing me,'' said Howard. ``It was a learning experience. It was
politics.''
<p>
   The whispers that followed him after he left Washington amounted
to ``scapegoating. It's covering your back.''
<p>
   So these are the Packers receivers. Combine Rison, Beebe and
Howard with outstanding talent like Antonio Freeman and the injured
Robert Brooks, and you have one of the more interesting  &MD;  and
possibly deep  &MD;  receiving corps in the National Football League.
<p>
   What is interesting about this group is that when one person
goes down with an injury, another seems to step step in. When
Brooks tore the anterior cruciate ligament and patellar tendon in
his right knee against the 49ers, in came Beebe looking like James
Lofton. Freeman joked Wednesday about the plate holding together
his broken forearm, an injury that caused him to miss four games in
the middle of the season. No problem. He was replaced by Terry
Mickens, who finished the year with 18 catches and two touchdowns.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Lewis said the Packers did change some things when their lead
receivers started getting hurt. ``It was nothing drastic,'' he
said. ``We dinked and dunked a little more. We went to short passes
and went to the running backs more than normal. We weren't the same
team when those guys got hurt. But let me say this: A lot of guys
stepped up.''
<p>
   Still, the Packers say no one outside Green Bay appreciates what
the receivers have done. ``We still don't get any respect,'' said
Freeman. ``I think we have some terrific receivers, but all we hear
about is Terry Glenn and Ben Coates.'' He was referring to the
Patriots' receivers. ``But that's all right. We just want to win
the game.''
<p>
   Although they do have talent, the main reason why so many of the
Packers' receivers look so good has to do with a guy named Favre.
When the Packers are in the red zone and the team has a quarterback
who can squeeze a football into a tightly compressed area or throw
60 yards on a dime the way Brett Favre can, any receiver will end
up looking good.
<p>
   ``No. 4 is the reason why our receivers always seem to be
stepping it up,'' Freeman said, alluding to the uniform number of
the league's most valuable player. ``He is just awesome at
times.''

   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Green Bay strong safety LeRoy Butler has covered
some of the best tight ends in football  &MD;  Shannon Sharpe, Wesley
Walls, Brent Jones. He must see wide bodies catching passes in his
sleep. Now here comes another tight end who will try to post him
up: the New England Patriots' Ben Coates.
<p>
   ``It's a tough job,'' Butler joked, ``but somebody has to do
it.''
<p>
   In addition to Coates, who is arguably the second-best tight end
in the National Football League behind Sharpe of the Denver
Broncos, the Patriots have the powerful rookie Terry Glenn and the
veteran Shawn Jefferson.
<p>
   The three receivers have combined for 202 catches for 2,585
yards and 19 touchdowns this season.
<p>
   ``They are as good a group of receivers as we've seen all
season,'' said the Packers' defensive coordinator, Fritz Shurmur.
``That bunch knows how to light up the scoreboard.''
<p>
   So how do the Packers keep the Patriots from lighting them up?
Or, at the very least, slowing them down?
<p>
   The Patriots often run what the Packers call an outside flood.
Basically, New England floods about one-third of the field with
three receivers, a scheme that makes it tough for a defense to
cover.
<p>
   Although there are many different variations of the outside
flood, basically Glenn will run a deep straight pattern (a 9
route), Coates will run downfield about 15 yards and then cut
toward the sideline (a 7 route) and one of the running backs will
run a flair route, or short pattern in front of the linebackers.
<p>
   ``They can run a lot of different things out the outside
flood,'' Packers safety Mike Prior said. ``But the main thing is
that from the film we've watched, they confuse a lot of people with
what they do.''
<p>
   If the Packers guess wrong in their coverage, they will be
outnumbered on that side of the field and get burned.
<p>
   ``Our strategy is to keep Drew Bledsoe guessing,'' free safety
Eugene Robinson said. ``We have to keep him moving in the pocket
and wondering what we're doing. If he can just set up in the pocket
and hit all of those receivers, we're dead.''
<p>
   In addition to their downfield game, the Patriots have a strong
running game with Curtis Martin and they use a variety of screen
passes and have been able to get by without using maximum
protection  &MD;  keeping the standard five linemen in to block.
<p>
   Interestingly, though, the Packers say Bledsoe doesn't often
take short drop backs. Most quarterbacks in the league drop back an
average of 3 to 5 yards but Bledsoe drops back an average of 7 to 9
yards.
<p>
   Now comes the Packers and their outstanding defensive line that
is anchored by the defensive ends Reggie White, a future Hall of
Famer, and Sean Jones, a Pro Bowler. There is no way the Patriots
will be able to single pass block them. And how can one person
consistently block the massive 350-pound tackle Gilbert Brown?
<p>
   And the Packers aren't shy about saying they can't be single
blocked.
<p>
   ``I don't think we can be,'' said Green Bay defensive tackle
Santana Dotson. ``I don't recall one game this year where that
happened. If they try to single block us, our job is to take
advantage of that. I hope they don't change what they've been doing
because we'll take advantage of it.''
<p>
   Bold words but the Packers have been able to back up their talk
all season. They only hope that continues on Sunday.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  An uneasy Don Mattingly said his wife had told him to
speak from the heart, but the retiring New York Yankee, not one to
wear emotions on his pinstriped sleeves, played it diplomatically
safe, never wandering very far off first base.
<p>
   Yes, Mattingly said, the World Series had been a time of great
reflection, some pain, but also of joy for former teammates. He
mentioned Bernie Williams. Derek Jeter. He nodded at the owner,
George Steinbrenner.
<p>
   His partner in life, whose relationship with the former Yankee
first baseman traces its genesis to a bus ride to an American
Legion game in Madisonville, Ky., was unburdened, however, by the
glare of the lights or by a reputation for avoiding controversy
that was sculptured long ago.
<p>
   Kim Mattingly, the daughter of that American Legion team's
coach, didn't mind admitting the anger she felt for her husband
when she would find him in the barn of their Evansville, Ind.,
home, excusing himself from another workout in the weeks following
the World Series that Don Mattingly somehow missed. She had hoped
he would play baseball again.
<p>
   ``Was it internal anger, or did you let him know?'' Kim
Mattingly was asked.
<p>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' she said. ``I've never been one to not express
myself.''
<p>
   It was easier, then, for her to dwell on what everyone knew but
didn't have the heart to acknowledge with anything more than a
brief line of questioning that Don Mattingly would carefully
deflect. Kim Mattingly called the conclusion to her husband's
baseball career, a wrenching October 1995 night in a hideous
Seattle dome, a lousy ending. He was a great player once, and
always was one of the good guys. She would never stop believing
that her man deserved better.
<p>
   ``It seemed like baseball just ended in Seattle for us,'' she
said. ``There just didn't seem to be any closure.''
<p>
   Her bright blue eyes never so much as blinked as she added, ``I
wanted a storybook ending.''
<p>
   That it all happened for the Yankees one year after the
Mattinglys left New York made it difficult to take, she said, and
worse to watch. The long silences at their home as Game 6
progressed, with the Atlanta Braves slip-sliding to what seemed
like their predestined fate, ultimately gave way to waves of
emotion, of sadness, of too many disappointments across 13 years.
<p>
   Kim Mattingly said she walked out of the room in the eighth
inning. Don and their three young sons stayed behind, but she
specifically recalled that the television was turned off soon after
Charlie Hayes had squeezed the final out.
<p>
   ``Before all the commotion on the field,'' she said.
<p>
   So, Kim Mattingly was asked, Don never actually saw the Yankees
celebrate?
<p>
   ``No,'' she said, her eyes again holding their gaze.
<p>
   This was not about blaming anyone, certainly not Steinbrenner
for signing Tino Martinez. But surely there is in this unkind tale
a moral about the loss or lack of continuity that has overwhelmed
pro sports. We always hear much hankering for the days when we
could identify with the players, when they were ``our'' guys, but
the plain truth in the Mattingly case was that history, family and
loyalty were quickly forgotten the season before last in the city's
summer-long outcry for someone, anyone, to drive in 100 runs.
<p>
   Mattingly took that repudiation hard, with good reason, and
probably retreated emotionally when he might have sat down with Joe
Torre, swallowed some pride and worked out a role. Where could he
have played last season? He had played outfield. One year, he
dragged his southpaw glove out to third base for a spell. All I
know is that Yankees seemed to come and go last season as if Yankee
Stadium were a Marriott, and the World Series produced more than a
few heroes with lesser credentials than Mattingly, and less right
to have been there.
<p>
   Kim Mattingly, who married Don in 1979, the year he signed with
the Yankees and reported to Oneonta, N.Y., said she was left with
the feeling of being ``cheated.'' She added that she could only
speak for herself but that probably was the only time all afternoon
she didn't tell the truth.
<p>
   Baseball wives often speak of their husbands' careers as joint
efforts, so on the subject of Don's decision to quit, Kim Mattingly
said, ``Once they had gone to the Series without us, there was no
coming back.''
<p>
   The sad realization had set in. The storybook was closed,
forever.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Organizations everywhere seem to be in a mood for
presenting awards, announcing them or making plans for ceremonies.
The New York Academy of Medicine will pay tribute Thursday night to
Dr. David Hamburg, who in July will step down as the president of
the Carnegie Corp., in New York, and Evelyn Lauder, senior
corporate vice president of Estee Lauder, at its 150th anniversary
celebration at the Museum of Natural History.
<p>
   Hamburg is being honored for bringing critical issues to public
attention, especially those involving the needs of children, and
Mrs. Lauder for her work raising awareness of breast cancer.
<p>
   For Hamburg, the evening will be a family affair. His wife, Dr.
Beatrix Hamburg, president of the W.T. Grant Foundation, is a
member of the academy board. His daughter, Dr. Margaret Hamburg,
the city's health commissioner, was instrumental in helping the
academy establish a center for urban epidemiology. ``It turns out
that the mayor has asked her to represent him at the dinner, so she
will have a formal role in saying a few words for him,'' Hamburg
said.
<p>
   And might she talk about her father? ``I hope so,'' he said. 
<p>

<p>
   The Chinese Democracy Education Foundation, a 12-year-old
California organization, announced this week that it would honor
A.M. Rosenthal, a columnist for The New York Times and its former
executive editor. Rosenthal will be given an award for his columns
advocating human rights in China.
<p>
   Also being honored as ``Distinguished Persons for the
Advancement of Democracy in China'' are Chen Ziming, an educator in
China, and Hu Chu-jen, an editor in Hong Kong. The awards will be
presented in May in San Francisco.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Michael Sovern, former president of Columbia
University and former dean of its law school, will receive
Columbia's highest award, its Medal of Excellence, on Friday along
with one of his students of 40 years ago, Marie Garibaldi, class of
'59 and now a New Jersey Supreme Court justice. The awards will be
presented at the law school's winter luncheon in the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan.
<p>
   ``The personal pleasure I feel at receiving it is amplified by a
teacher's special joy in seeing a student whom I remember clearly
and for whom I had high hopes realize those hopes,'' said Sovern,
who taught Justice Garibaldi in his evidence class.

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The dollar rose to a 47-month high
of 119.32 yen on expectations investors will keep buying dollars to
invest in the U.S., traders said.
<p>
   ``I think this is rather `the U.S. buying,''' said Shinichi
Yamashita, manager for foreign exchange at Sanwa Bank Ltd. The U.S.
economy and its financial markets are much stronger than Japan's,
he said.
<p>
   The government's announcement that Japan's trade surplus fell
more than expected in December also boosted the dollar, said a
trader at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Japan said its merchandise
trade surplus in December fell 20.6 percent from a year earlier to
881.475 billion yen ($7.4 billion).
<p>
   Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected the
trade surplus to fall 5.0 percent. A larger-than-expected decline
in Japan's surplus often helps boost the dollar because it means
fewer dollars in the hands of Japanese exporters to sell for yen to
bring profits home.
<p>
   The dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since Feb.
19, 1993, when it traded for 119.50 yen. It was quoted at 1.6395
marks, compared with 1.6402 marks in New York.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  In a joint show of political force, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, each affirmed
support for abortion rights at a luncheon here Wednesday marking
the 24th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion.
<p>
   Both Gore and Mrs. Clinton also urged the group to work with
opponents of abortion to reduce the need for the procedure. ``I
hope that we will be able to find ways of increasing dialogue and
working together with people of good faith who do not share
extremism as their rallying cry,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
<p>
   It was the first time that Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore had
addressed the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which held the luncheon, and Mrs. Clinton had not been
expected to attend.
<p>
   It was also the second time in four days the first lady had made
late arrangements to appear at a political event, suggesting she
may be taking a more public role.
<p>
   As Congress prepares for battles over financing family planning
abroad, Mrs. Clinton made clear that efforts supporting abortion
rights were a priority for the administration. She quoted a
conversation with the Brazilian minister of health, who she said
told her during a visit there, `We want to give poor women the same
information and access to family planning that well-to-do women
have always had in this country.''
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton added: ``That should be our goal, not only here but
also in our foreign policy.''
<p>
   Kate Michelman, the president of the abortion rights group, said
the appearance of ``three members of the presidential team'' was an
``extraordinary demonstration of the commitment on the part of the
administration to a woman's right to choose.''
<p>
   But in their own display of political determination across town
Wednesday, thousands of abortion opponents gathered on the Mall at
noon to listen to speeches and then march down Constitution Avenue
to the Supreme Court.
<p>
   Several in the crowd said that they were particularly upset
about Clinton's veto of a bill banning abortions conducted late in
pregnancy in a procedure called ``partial-birth abortion'' by its
foes.
<p>
   ``This march has a special emphasis on partial-birth abortions,
because banning those is a short-term goal that we can
accomplish,'' said Frank Nava, 28, a customer-service
representative for a Virginia home inspection company.
<p>
   Last year's veto was not mentioned during the speeches at the
luncheon, which was held at the Mayflower Hotel.
<p>
   Instead, Gore condemned the violence of some who oppose
abortion, vowing that the government would find those responsible
for bombings in the last week at abortion clinics in Atlanta, and
Tulsa, Okla.
<p>
   ``The American people will not tolerate your cowardly crusade,''
he said. He accused groups that invoke religion to justify violence
of ``an appalling act of hypocrisy.''
<p>
   Gore's commitment to abortion rights was at one point in doubt,
as some in his audience acknowledged. When he was a member of the
House from 1977 to 1984, the National Right to Life Committee, an
anti-abortion group, said he voted 84 percent of the time for
measures of which it approved.
<p>
   But Gore was emphatic in his support for abortion rights
Wednesday. ``How can we say that the government of the United
States of America,'' he said, ``with all of its power, with all of
its resources, with all of its distance and insensitivity to these
fragile and complex circumstances pressing in on that individual
woman  &MD;  how can we say that the government must come in and order
her to do what it has decided is the right thing?''
<p>
   Ms. Michelman, said Gore had ``evolved'' and might serve as a
model for other legislators. ``To his absolute credit, as he is
known to do, he really studied the issue, talked to people,
understood it, became more sensitive to the complex questions,''
she said.
<p>
   Opponents of abortion were not impressed with Wednesday's talk
of making abortion rare, a longstanding pledge of Clinton's.
``That's the sort of rhetoric we've heard from the Clintons,'' said
Douglas Johnson, the legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee. ``But of course their policies have been to remove
all obstacles to abortion and to expand its use as a method of
birth control, both domestically and overseas.''
<p>
   Hours before the lunch, a tiny explosion occurred about a block
away, near a downtown abortion clinic. Police said they were still
trying to determine who had left the device, which had the force of
a firecracker and scratched the hand of a passerby who picked it
up.
<p>
   They said they had no evidence that it was related to the
commemoration of the Supreme Court decision.

<p>
   HARTFORD, Conn.  &MD;  A panel established by Gov. John G. Rowland to
address segregation in Connecticut's schools said Wednesday that
the state should require school districts to accept students from
anywhere in Connecticut and should pay more for school construction
projects that bring black and Hispanic students into mostly white
districts.
<p>
   In an unusual step, the panel recommended that state assistance
for school construction, typically half the cost of a project, be
linked to the project's effect on racial balance. A project that
improves racial diversity  &MD;  for example, by creating space in a
mostly white district for minority children from neighboring
districts  &MD;  would receive more money. A project that does not help
integrate a school could be penalized.
<p>
   While the report, by the Education Improvement Panel, said such
a test would be applied to every application for state aid for
school construction, it was quiet about what portion of the aid for
any one project should be tied to the estimated effect on racial
balance. Construction could play a major role in making the school
choice provision work, since the panel's recommendations would
allow districts that do not have space to turn away outside
students.
<p>
   Education experts said that they knew of no other state with a
program tying school construction money to desegregation. The issue
had been a difficult one for the panel, with several members saying
that they were wary of going into such uncharted territory.
<p>
   Panel members said they expected the construction-aid and
school-choice recommendations to be hotly debated in the next few
months, as the legislature takes them up.
<p>
   Those provisions were 2 of 15 in the report, which was greeted
by many as the first step toward desegregating the state's schools
and turning around the quality of its urban schools.
<p>
   Rowland praised the panel Wednesday for giving ``us a standard
to follow in the legislature.'' In a 10-minute speech to the panel
this morning, Rowland said, ``I don't want to see any distance
between me and the recommendations at all,'' though he did not
specifically discuss or single out any of the measures.
<p>
   The 22-member panel, which included top legislators, civil
rights leaders and local officials, was created by Rowland in July
after the State Supreme Court ruled that the racial isolation in
the Hartford school system violated the state Constitution.
<p>
   About 95 percent of the students in the Hartford schools are
either black or Hispanic, while almost all of the school districts
in the surrounding 21 towns have a majority of white students.
<p>
   It was the first time that a state high court, using a state
constitution, had ordered a state to develop a desegregation plan
that crossed district lines, encompassing both cities and suburbs.
The decision ran counter to a trend in federal courts, which had
been moving away from ordering desegregation plans across these
district lines.
<p>
   Indeed, Connecticut is considering how to achieve integration as
a host of other states and municipalities have been ordered to
dismantle desegregation plans set in motion by the federal courts
more than a decade ago.
<p>
   Owen M. Fiss, a Yale Law School professor and expert in school
desegregation, said, ``We're basically at a point where school
desegregation efforts have collapsed, and Brown has been emptied of
all its practical meaning, becoming just a symbol.'' Brown vs.
Board of Education was the 1954 case in which the U.S. Supreme
Court found segregated schools unconstitutional.
<p>
   ``These proposals in the panel's report  &MD;  however limited they
may be from the combatants' point of view  &MD;  represent a movement in
a totally different direction than the rest of the nation has
taken,'' Fiss added. ``Connecticut represents a break with the
tradition of following the federal lead on these issues.''

<p>
   Many panel members Wednesday played down the choice and school
construction proposals as only 2 measures in a package of 15, and
the panel tried to send a symbolic message about their significance
by voting to move them to the back of the report, instead of at the
beginning.
<p>
   Among the other proposals in the report were recommendations to
increase the numbers of charter and magnet schools; to achieve
universal access to preschool programs for all poor 3- and
4-year-old children by 2000, and to provide additional state aid to
urban school districts for after-school and summer instructional
programs as well as for reading instruction to young students.
<p>
   The report also called for making school districts more
accountable to the state, setting up a system by which the state
could take over school systems that had failed to achieve certain
academic standards that would be determined by the state Education
Department.
<p>
   But the issue that clearly had taken up the most time and that
even Wednesday was debated until the final hour was the provision
that would give students around the state a choice of school
districts.
<p>
   Wednesday, as in previous weeks, that measure was attacked by
critics from across the political spectrum, who disliked it for
very different reasons.
<p>
   ``Many will choose, and few will be called,'' remarked Jerome P.
Brown, a panel member who has been an outspoken proponent for even
more sweeping steps to achieve desegregation, like creating larger
regionwide districts. Under the panel's proposal, school districts
can turn away students if there is no room available, and Brown and
others predicted that there would not be space for out-of-district
students.
<p>
   In turn, some argued that any success of the program would spell
the downfall of urban school systems and divert much-needed
resources away from those schools.
<p>
   The report states that every student leaving a school district
would be accompanied by some of the state funds that would have
otherwise gone to his home district. The state also would put up
additional money for transportation.
<p>
   ``What happens to the children who are left behind?'' asked
State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a panel member and the Senate's
top officer, who opposed the school choice plank.
<p>
   Still others argued that parents of black and Hispanic children
did not want to send their children into the suburbs and that most
would not even take that option.
<p>
   ``Choosing suburban schools is not necessarily the choice they
want,'' said Ben F. Andrews Jr., a panel member who is head of the
state NAACP chapter and vice chairman of the national organization.
<p>
   Andrews and four other panel members released their own report
Wednesday that said local school districts should no longer be
financed by municipal property taxes, but rather by the state, a
provision that would equalize funding but likely meet strong
opposition in the legislature.
<p>
   The plaintiffs who brought the case against the state  &MD;  parents
of 17 Hartford and suburban students  &MD;  also weighed in Wednesday,
saying that the panel's report paid insufficient attention to urban
education. They added that it neither sets specific goals for
achieving racial diversity, nor established strong enough
enforcement mechanisms.
<p>
   Still, many of the panel members clearly believed that by tying
the school choice program to state funds for school construction
and increasing the number of magnet and charter schools, they had
come up with a solution that could move the state toward
desegregation.
<p>
   While admitting that it could take a number of years, they said
that it had the potential for positive change, if the legislature
properly financed it.
<p>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
<p>
   A panel of legislators, civil rights leaders, parents and
teachers made a series of recommendations Wednesday to address a
decision last July by the Connecticut Supreme Court that the racial
isolation in the Hartford school system violated the state
Constitution. These are among the recommendations:
<p>
    &MD;  Set up a school choice program that allows students to attend
schools outside their home district and requires districts to
receive outside students if space permits.
<p>
    &MD;  Increase state spending on magnet schools that would attract
students from both city and suburban schools, and encourage them to
open more rapidly.
<p>
    &MD;  Increase the number of Connecticut charter schools and give
preference to charter proposals that reduce racial and economic
segregation.
<p>
    &MD;  Increase state spending for school construction projects that
reduce racial segregation and cut back state spending on projects
that fail to reduce segregation.
<p>
    &MD;  Provide state aid to expand access to preschool programs for
3- and 4-year-olds, starting with the state's largest cities.
<p>
    &MD;  Set up a system that would allow the state to place troubled
school districts on probation and ultimately take them over if no
improvement occurs.
<p>
    &MD;  Increase state aid to city schools for after-school and summer
instructional programs, and for reading instruction for young
students.
<p>
    &MD;  Provide after-school and summer programs for bilingual
students who are not becoming proficient in English. Also, by the
year 2000, provide foreign language instruction in the early
grades.
<p>
    &MD;  Increase state spending for family resource centers, which
provide programs like parent training and preschool child care.
<p>
    &MD;  Expand adult education programs.

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Saturday morning, Jan. 18: I rise, ready for
history. I do not feel jaded. I am perfectly prepared to feel
corny. This is a weekend for unblushing patriotism. Barbra
Streisand is not in the Lincoln Bedroom. Dick Morris is not in the
Jefferson bedroom. The United States is the only superpower on
earth. All's right with the world. I can even bear that Michael
Bolton's in town.
<p>
   Bill's and Hillary's first four years were exhausting. The
country's all rolfed out. There were some tawdry moments. But most
Americans seem satisfied that the Clintons have been punished for
cutting all those corners. There was a pounding in the press, and
all those hearings. Perhaps people now look to the presidency for
lurid entertainment as much as moral inspiration. And, as I watch
Al Gore craning from the wings, I can give the Clintons this: They
aren't boring.
<p>
   The inaugural, unfortunately, builds on the themes of the
campaign: bridges, villages, Internet access. But even weighed down
with earnest lectures by family experts and glitzed up with Whoopi
Goldberg (who makes Liza Minnelli look sincere), democracy is
lovely to behold.
<p>
   Saturday night: I go to John McLaughlin's party at the Willard
Hotel. Up or down? Way down. McLaughlin has managed to find the
only white soul band in D.C. Tall Media Analyst William Schneider
looms over Tiny Cabinet Member Donna Shalala to discuss Tarnished
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``Three hundred thousand dollars is a
meaningful concept,'' Schneider says.
<p>
   Soignee Conservative Arianna Huffington asks Soigne Conservative
Tony Blankley to film a bit for her Comedy Central gig: ``Let's
find a way to make the Republican Party more compassionate,'' she
says, pointing at me. ``Tony, help her put on her coat. Get her a
drink.''
<p>
   At the Corcoran Gallery's MTV party, as trays of blue martinis
float by, Hillary has an Evita moment at the top of the grand
staircase.
<p>
   I see my personal trainer, and scurry away from the guacamole.
<p>
   Sunday, Jan. 19: Emily's List, the feminist fund-raising group,
has a news conference featuring new Democratic women in Congress. A
reporter asks whether feminists have ignored Paula Jones.
<p>
   The Emily's List spokeswoman cuts off questioning, saying time
has run out.
<p>
   Monday, Jan. 20: I go to the Inaugural Address. Despite the
president's best efforts, it is exciting. Why is he so deadly? Is
it because he speaks in cliches or because he fails to act on his
cliches? He wins the election by trafficking in what Dick Morris
called ``bite-size'' issues. And now he says that ``Nothing big
ever came from being small.''
<p>
   Monday night: After I get tickets to the Arkansas ball, I
realize I have made a fatal mistake. This is a town where you can
never start jockeying for position too early. Everyone is elbowing
into Tennessee.
<p>
   Arkansas has its compensations. A circle of guys in black tie
try to teach me the Arkansas Cheer, which goes, ``Pig  &MD;  soo-eeee!''
<p>
   The Clintons appear on stage at 10:30 p.m., serenaded by Sheryl
Crow singing ``All I wanna do is have some fun.'' But their remarks
sound oddly peevish. Bill harkens back to the dark scandal days of
New Hampshire '92. Hillary tells a story about a woman who called
C-Span to ask if the president was really a Kennedy. ``The woman,''
the first lady says, smiling coolly, ``was spinning out these
extraordinary conspiracy theories that capture the hearts and minds
of too many with too little to do.''
<p>
   ``Nightline'' does a day in the life of Al Gore  &MD;  ``The Vice
President, a Bridge to the Future.'' Ted Koppel asks Gore if he's
running. The tension is unbearable as Koppel waits for a reply. The
reply is even more unbearable. ``My so-called campaign for
president,'' Gore says, ``is a lot like my macarena  &MD;  there's no
visible movement.'' OK, OK, we get it. You're stiff. Stop being so
vain about it.
<p>
   Tuesday, Jan. 21: During the House debate on punishing Newt
Gingrich, Tom DeLay of Texas cries: ``Let's stop this madness.
Let's stop the cannibalism.''
<p>
   Wednesday, Jan. 22: Back to business. Let the madness and
cannibalism begin.

<p>
   A Cornell University alumnus who amassed a fortune in the
development of computer software is giving his alma mater $20
million toward the construction of laboratories and classrooms to
train the next generation of scientists and engineers.
<p>
   The gift from the alumnus, David A. Duffield, 56, is one of the
largest in the 132-year history of Cornell and is the latest
example of a growing trend in philanthropy, of software and
computer entrepreneurs giving large amounts to education.
<p>
   ``I think we're all maturing,'' said Duffield, the president,
chief executive and chairman of Peoplesoft Inc., of Pleasanton,
Calif., which he founded 10 years ago. ``You get to a point in life
where you sort of wake up to the world and look outside your little
box.''
<p>
   In December, Charles B. Wang, the founder of Computer Associates
International, based in Islandia, N.Y., pledged $20 million to $25
million to create an Asian-American cultural center at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook.
<p>
   In October, Bill Gates, who founded Microsoft Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., with his childhood friend Paul G. Allen, announced his fifth
multimillion dollar gift to a university, $15 million to Harvard
for computer science and engineering programs.
<p>
   Last week, Gates, Allen, Craig McCaw and three brothers from the
family that founded McCaw Cellular Communications gave $30 million
in a challenge grant for education and construction to the Lakeside
School in Seattle, the private school that is their alma mater.
<p>
   Duffield, whose company is a developer of software for
manufacturing, distribution, financial and human resource
management and for higher education, gave $2 million in 1995 to
Cornell for promoting the use of information technology in its
engineering and business schools.
<p>
   He received a bachelor's degree in electric engineering from
Cornell in 1963 and a master's degree in business administration
there in 1964.
<p>
   ``I've made a ton, and you can't take it all with you,'' said
Duffield, whose six children range in age from 4 months to 30
years. ``I don't want to give it all to my kids because they get
all screwed up.''
<p>
   Cornell's president Hunter Rawlings announced Duffield's gift at
the annual Cornell President's Circle Dinner on Wednesday night at
the Rainbow Room in Manhattan. ``We are grateful for his vision and
confidence in Cornell,'' he said in a statement. ``Our students and
faculty will benefit from Dave's generosity for generations to
come.''
<p>
   In an interview, Duffield expressed gratitude toward Cornell.
``I was not one of their better students,'' he said. ``They just
gave me opportunities that maybe I shouldn't have gotten. They
admitted me, for one, whereas other Ivy League universities didn't,
and then offered me a chance to get a business degree when I was
not a fabulous student during my engineering days.''
<p>
   The donation is the lead gift in support of a new center on the
university's campus in Ithaca, N.Y. Initially called the
Engineering Research and Instructional Facility, it will now be
named Duffield Hall. It will house flexible laboratory space and
multimedia classrooms to be used for training at the nanostructure
frontier, involving the understanding of materials at the atomic
and molecular level.
<p>
   Plans for the $40 million center call for construction to begin
in June 1999 and for completion by the end of 2001.

 &UR; DYNAMITE WAS USED IN BOMB ATTACK AT ATLANTA CLINIC, OFFICIALS SAY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (bl) &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The federal authorities investigating the bombing
at an abortion clinic near Atlanta last week have concluded that
each of the two bombs were built with 10 to 20 sticks of dynamite,
a high explosive that experts say is unusual in homemade terrorist
devices.
<p>
   Amateur bomb-makers, law-enforcement officials said Wednesday,
are more likely to use more readily available black or smokeless
powder in pipe bombs instead of commercial dynamite or
nitroglycerin, which are regulated by the government and require
purchasers to obtain a federal permit to transport it between
states.
<p>
   In the attack at the clinic Jan. 16, officials said the design
of the second bomb, which detonated about an hour after
law-enforcement officers and news reporters were drawn to the first
blast, differed from the first bomb and might have been built to
harm emergency workers.
<p>
   The second device, packed in a metal military-style container
that also held 3-inch concrete nails, appeared to have been
designed to spew metal fragments over a wide area.
<p>
   In contrast, the bomb that exploded at the Olympics in Atlanta
in July, consisted of three lengths of pipe packed with smokeless
powder.
<p>
   The officials said the presence of dynamite, which is
manufactured by a single company in Utah but sold under a variety
of commercial labels, offered some investigative leads to sellers
in the Atlanta area but did not necessarily point to any suspect or
motive for the attack.
<p>
   So far, no one has taken responsibility for the clinic bombing
and, although the abortion clinic was a presumed target,
investigators are pursuing other theories, including the
possibility that the attack was aimed at law enforcement.
<p>
   Investigators have also said both clinic bombs were powerful
devices that could have caused far more serious harm than the six
minor injuries reported. One tore through reinforced concrete and
both left craters several feet deep.
<p>
   The first blast, about 9:30 a.m., caused no injuries but
shattered concrete and blew away pieces of wall and ceiling at the
building housing the clinic. Then as emergency teams converged at
the scene, the second bomb exploded in an adjoining parking lot,
knocking several people to the ground.
<p>
   Officials said more serious injuries were avoided because the
authorities had moved several cars after the first blast to a point
near where the second device exploded. When it detonated, the
vehicles absorbed much of the explosion.
<p>
   Dynamite is seldom used in improvised explosives, said
Christopher Ronay, the president of the Institute of Makers of
Explosives and former chief of the explosives unit at the FBI.
<p>
   Dynamite, Ronay said, is difficult to handle, not easy to buy
and regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Legitimate users of dynamite are turning to less unwieldy
alternatives to replace a product that was once widely used in
construction, agriculture, mining and quarrying.
<p>
   Less than 1 percent of domestic bombers use dynamite in their
devices, Ronay said, adding: ``It seldom falls into criminal hands
It is seldom is used in bombs. Most bombs are improvised with
smokeless powder or black powder.''
<p>
   As details of the clinic bombs emerged, a small explosion here
in Washington sent law-enforcement officials racing to an abortion
clinic Wednesday as proponents and opponents of abortion rights
demonstrated on the 24th anniversary of the Supreme Court's
decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The
authorities later concluded that the device, a small
military-training fuse, was not directed at the clinic.
<p>
   Officials said Wednesday that they had no evidence that the Jan.
16 bombing near Atlanta was connected to a firebombing at an
abortion clinic in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan. 19. That blast hurt no one
and caused minor damage.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Don Mattingly's eyes were moist and misty as he stood
behind a podium Wednesday and thanked everyone, from George
Steinbrenner, to his wife and three sons, to the clubhouse security
guards and the groundskeepers at Yankee Stadium. He still looked as
if he could play baseball, but the former Yankee captain said he
did not want to sacrifice for the game anymore.
<p>
   Mattingly explained that during three straight days of batting
practice in November, he convinced himself that he could still
wield a bat with precision. But he decided in early December that
his wrist, elbow and knees ached too much, not to mention his back,
with which he has had chronic problems. He retired his batting
gloves on that day in Evansville, Ind., and he officially retired
from baseball Wednesday.
<p>
   ``I wasn't willing to pay the price it was going to take to be
able to succeed,'' said Mattingly, who revealed Wednesday that he
turned down an offer to join the Baltimore Orioles last July. ``At
that point, I knew it was time to step away.''
<p>
   Steinbrenner presented Mattingly with his No. 23 jersey in a
news conference before 120 reporters at the Stadium Club and
announced that no other Yankee would ever don it. Mattingly's
number will become the 14th retired by the Yankees during a
ceremony at a date to be determined this season.
<p>
   ``I don't believe any player on the New York Yankees was ever as
great as Don Mattingly in every way during my years as an owner,''
said Steinbrenner. ``He was a great athlete and a great player.
Some great athletes are not great human beings and vice versa. This
man combined all of that.''
<p>
   Mattingly, who will be 36 on April 20, retired as a legendary
Yankee, a player who was respected and revered during his 13-year
career.
<p>
   He won a plethora of individual honors, including the American
League Most Valuable Player Award one year and the batting
championship another, but never made it to a World Series. He
laughed about his timing; he was drafted by the Yankees in the 19th
round in 1979, the year after they won the World Series, and he
last played in 1995, the year before they won another championship.
<p>
   ``I wasn't cheated because I chose the road,'' he said. ``Very
honestly, I would do it again. Even if I knew they were going to
win. I know I did the right thing.''
<p>
   There was a possibility Mattingly could have been competing
against the Yankees during their magical sprint to the championship
last season because Jim Krivacs, his agent, confirmed that
Baltimore inquired about Mattingly during the All-Star Game break.
Krivacs said the Orioles ``knew they had a problem in the
clubhouse'' and wanted Mattingly as a designated hitter and a
positive influence. Rebuffed, the Orioles then obtained Eddie
Murray from the Cleveland Indians, who had pursued Mattingly last
spring.
<p>
   ``No, not during midseason,'' said Mattingly, when asked why he
did not seize the opportunity with Baltimore. ``It opened my eyes.
It got me thinking about clubs being interested. But I had made a
commitment to sitting out the season.''
<p>
   After last season, Mattingly set up the parameters of wanting to
play only regularly for a contender close to his Indiana home if he
played at all in 1997. Krivacs said there have been no serious
discussions with any teams during this off-season, and Mattingly
conceded, ``Every time Jim called me, I would tell him I didn't
want to go there.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Steinbrenner has already implored Mattingly to join the Yankees
as a spring training coach, and he told Krivacs and Ray Schulte,
Mattingly's representatives, that he would love to have Mattingly
as his manager someday. Mattingly said he would not coach or manage
until his sons, who are 5, 9 and 11, are grown.
<p>
   But he added: ``It's something I'd hate to rule out. I want to
stay involved.''
<p>
   With a .307 career batting average and nine Gold Glove Awards,
Mattingly will receive some support for a bust in Cooperstown, N.Y.
But there will be long arguments about his candidacy for the Hall
of Fame.
<p>
   ``It's all been stated,'' Mattingly said. ``It's all out there.
The final arguments have been made. As a player, I am what I am. I
did what I did. I don't know if that puts me in the category or
not.''
<p>
   Steinbrenner said, ``They should close the building if he isn't
in it.''
<p>
   On the flight from Evansville to New York Tuesday night,
Mattingly and his wife, Kim, reminisced about their flight from
Evansville to Oneonta, N.Y. almost 18 years ago. It was Mattingly's
first minor-league assignment with the Yankees.
<p>
   ``To come from where I came from to this point is a long road
for the guy who couldn't run, who couldn't throw and who didn't hit
for power,'' said Mattingly. ``It's a long ride. It's been a great
ride.''
<p>
   INSIDE PITCH:
<p>
   The checkered Yankee career of Scott Kamieniecki also ended
Wednesday when the 32-year-old right-hander agreed to a
minor-league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. Kamieniecki, who
was a free agent after the Yankees did not tender him an offer for
1997, was invited to the Orioles' training camp and will get a
$760,000, one-year salary if he makes the pitching staff. He is
guaranteed $380,000. Kamieniecki, who reached the majors in 1991,
underwent surgery on his right elbow in 1995 and started the 1996
season on the disabled list. He was activated last April and had
five starts before the Yankees optioned him.
<p>
   ``We talked to him about a minor-league contract with the chance
to make the club and make incentives to get him back to a
respectable salary,'' said General Manager Bob Watson of the
Yankees. ``It's my understanding he had assurances he can make
their rotation. But we wouldn't make that guarantee.''

<p>
   LOS ANGELES  &MD;  In the later years of George Raveling's coaching
career, this was his week. This was his night.
<p>
   Even now, happily employed by Nike, CBS and Fox, and utterly
sickened by some of the maneuvering within his former athletic
department, Raveling can't help but feel the tug of USC versus
UCLA.
<p>
   ``It made any pain that came with coaching at USC worth it,''
Raveling said. ``I kind of lived for the UCLA games.
<p>
   ``And as time moved on, I became more obsessed with beating
UCLA.''
<p>
   On Monday of UCLA week he'd sit at the head of a long table of
reporters at Julie's, lapping soup laced with Tabasco. The
one-liners would start about the God-almighty Bruins and the
pitiful little Trojans, and basketball fans from all over town
would lean in so they could laugh with him.
<p>
   Everyone knew the routine and everyone knew Raveling thought
he'd win again.
<p>
   It did take him some time to figure it out. At USC he lost his
first seven games against the boys in light blue and then won six
of his last nine and five of his last seven, before that
early-morning car wreck talked him out of the profession.
<p>
   Raveling didn't go invited to any Final Fours while at USC and
ended only one season in eight in the national top 10. But he did
find a way to beat UCLA, something of a lost art at Figueroa and
Jefferson.
<p>
   ``It was important to me,'' Raveling said this week. ``Deep down
inside maybe there was some hurt from the losses we took at
Washington State (to John Wooden's UCLA teams). We took some
big-time hind whippings.
<p>
   ``One thing I'll always remember, when we lost to them (former
UCLA athletic director) J.D. Morgan would always come into our
locker room and say, `George, your boys really played well.'''
<p>
   Raveling chuckled and continued with a Jack Nicholson voice that
was supposed to be Morgan's, ``Just once I wanted to go up to him
and say, `J.D., your boys really played well.' Unfortunately, he
retired and died before we beat them.''
<p>
   Damn the luck.
<p>
   Strategically, Raveling said, ``I always felt we were physically
tougher than they were,'' though athletically inferior, so he
trotted out his zone defenses, especially for the Bruins.
<p>
   ``You had to make them play a half-court game,'' he said. ``They
hate to play half-court basketball. You have to make them play long
stretches on defense. You're taking great athletes and making them
stand still and pass the ball. They never had any player movement
against the zone.''
<p>
   His last team, in 1994, defeated UCLA in among the final games
Raveling coached. No big deal.
<p>
   ``There wasn't a (UCLA) game my last four years there I thought
we'd lose,'' he said.
<p>
   Ultimately, the pain from battles with USC athletic director
Mike Garrett and a two-car collision near campus became too severe
to continue. He became a consultant for Nike, primarily in its
grassroots basketball programs. And rather than doing those jumping
jacks on USC's sideline tonight, he'll do the color commentary on
Stanford's, against Washington.
<p>
   Raveling said he won't ever coach again under any circumstance.
He said he holds no bitterness toward USC or about the public
nature of his feud with Garrett.
<p>
   Asked about his relationship with Garrett and how it
deteriorated so, Raveling said, ``Let me just say this, and I don't
want to get particular: There's nothing more dangerous in life than
a person who doesn't know and who doesn't realize he doesn't
know.''
<p>
   His self-evaluation is nearly as cutting.
<p>
   ``I thought I was an average coach,'' he said. ``I probably got
more credit for being a big-time recruiter than I deserved. The
thing I feel best about is I really understood what the real
responsibilities of a coach are. I didn't get myself blinded into
winning at all costs.''
<p>
   That could be a highly rationalized analysis by a coach who lost
more often than he won at USC. Then again, just the other day,
Yamen Sanders, a forward on two of Raveling's USC teams, called for
marital advice. Fact is, former players call all the time.
<p>
   ``I miss him,'' said Stais Boseman, one of three players left
from the Raveling era. ``This is just basketball. Life is a whole
different issue. I wish he was still here. It's sort of like having
a father as a coach. Now, sometimes that's bad and sometimes it's
good.
<p>
   ``He's just a good person to know and a great friend. There are
a lot of false people in the world and he's not one of them.'' &UR;

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  James C. Wood Jr., who heads the organization that
represents the United States in Taiwan and is at the center of a
Justice Department inquiry into whether he solicited donations for
the Clinton campaign, has resigned his post, the State Department
said Wednesday.
<p>
   Wood had served as the chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan since December 1995. The institute was created in 1979 to
carry on unofficial United States relations with Taiwan after the
diplomatic recognition of China.
<p>
   In the fall, the inspector general's office at the State
Department forwarded to the Justice Department allegations that
Wood had urged Taiwanese business executives  &MD;  many of whom carry
dual passports and hold U.S. citizenship  &MD;  to contribute to
President Clinton's re-election effort. That investigation is still
under way.
<p>
   Wood's appointment in 1995 had surprised many in the State
Department, as he had relatively little experience dealing with
China or Taiwan. The post that Wood held is usually filled with
career diplomats with extensive background in the delicate politics
between China and Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade
province. Wood had held several other diplomatic posts, however,
chiefly as a legal adviser.

 &UR; A Glowing Future &QL;  &LR;

 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
The University of California, which makes more money off its
inventions than any other U.S. educational institution, has a new
royalty generator  &MD;  the stuff that makes fireflies glow. &HT;    Cloned by UC San Diego biochemists and molecular biologists,
luciferase may not have the commercial punch of some other
university discoveries such as vaccines or genetic engineering
techniques. But the enzyme has a surprisingly bright future beyond
its God-given original purpose  &MD;  giving a charge to beetles' sex
lives.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Recombinant luciferase  &MD;  for which the university last month won
a patent  &MD;  can be used to screen water, food and cosmetics for
contamination; for drug discovery and diagnostic tests; and in
molecular biology research.
<p>
    ``Luciferase revenues could be in the six figures,'' said
David Aston, associate director of UC's Office of Technology
Transfer.
<p>
   The UC system, including nine campuses and three national
laboratories, has spawned more than 400 inventions. For the year
ending last June 30, these brought in royalty and fee income of
$63.2 million. That is more than invention revenues at any other
university and excludes another $7.1 million in expense
reimbursements from licensees.
<p>
   Luciferase  &MD;  also called living light  &MD;  is stored in a variety
of organisms, including some jellyfish, marine plankton, bacteria
and mushrooms as well as insects. In addition to fireflies,
glowworms (larvae of  &LR; Phengodes  &LR; beetles) and a class of click
beetles also sport internal lightbulbs.
<p>
   UC's patent, which had been pending for 11 years, deals
specifically with using genetic engineering techniques to create
beetle luciferase.
<p>
   ``We cloned the gene that makes fireflies glow,'' said Keith
Wood of his Ph.D. work with the laboratories of professors Marlene
DeLuca and Donald Helinski at UC San Diego. Wood is now group
manager of bioluminescence at Promega Corp. in Madison, Wis. The
privately owned company is a leader in harnessing the
glow-in-the-dark radiant reactions produced by living cells.
<p>
   Fireflies  &MD;  also known as lightning bugs  &MD;  might be shocked to
find there are multiple uses for their chemical conversion kits.
(Male and female fireflies only live for a week or two and only
care about using their built-in flash attachments to quickly meet
and mate.)
<p>
   Luciferase creates light in combination with oxygen, a molecule
called luciferin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a substance
found in all living cells.
<p>
   The ingredients may not sound like a recipe for commercial
success. But researchers have found that they can use luciferin and
luciferase together to look for ATP as an indication of life.
<p>
   A luciferase probe was aboard an American lander that checked
for life on Mars (none was found). Major food manufacturers and
European cosmetics companies are having better luck using
luciferase to spot ``bio-contamination.'' If there's a glow, it
indicates the presence of bacteria.
<p>
   Pharmaceutical companies are using luciferase as a marker to
identify potentially useful chemical compounds. Similarly, it is
being used clinically to test the efficacy of drugs on certain
cancer cells and other diseases.
<p>
   Albert Einstein College of Medicine has used luciferase to test
antibiotics on new resistant strains of tuberculosis. Test results
are available in days  &MD;  a vast improvement over bacteria cultures,
which take months.
<p>
   The enzyme also has potential for determining what makes plants
grow and their resistance to diseases.
<p>
   Luciferase fans don't have to depend on the genetically
engineered version. Sigma Chemical Co. of St. Louis, the largest
biomedical chemical supplier, pays a penny apiece for fireflies
(mainly to kids during the summer) and hires disabled persons to
cut off the tails and extract luciferase and luciferin.
<p>
   ``Nature supplies a very limited product that works great for
fireflies flashing for mates,'' scoffs Wood. ``But it is not very
stable and not optimal for commercial uses.''

 &UR; JURY AWARDS $5.5 MILLION IN ABC CASE &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   A federal jury in Greensboro, N.C., on Wednesday awarded a
supermarket chain more than $5.5 million in punitive damages from
ABC and two of its employees in a closely watched media case that
focused on the propriety of widely used television news techniques
like hidden cameras and undercover reporters.
<p>
   Last month, the same panel ordered ABC to pay $1,400 in actual
damages to the chain, Food Lion, after finding that network
producers had trespassed and committed fraud when researching a
``Primetime Live'' segment in 1992 that accused the company of
selling spoiled meat.
<p>
   The case has attracted broad attention in media and legal
circles because it is a leading example of a new trend in lawsuits
against networks and television news magazines. Although Food Lion
officials disputed the accuracy of the ABC report, they did not sue
for libel. Rather, they accused ABC of fraud because it used
techniques like having producers submit fake resumes to get jobs in
the meat department of company stores, and then used hidden cameras
to film there.
<p>
   Roone Arledge, the president of ABC News, defended the methods
used to report the segment and said ABC would appeal the verdict.
<p>
   ``They could never contest the truth'' of the broadcast, Arledge
said. ``These people were doing awful things in these stores.''
<p>
   Wednesday's verdict was only the second time punitive damages
had been meted out by a jury in a hidden-camera case. It was the
first time punitive damages had been awarded against producers of
such a segment, said Neville L. Johnson, a lawyer in Los Angeles
who has filed numerous hidden-camera cases against the major
networks.
<p>
   Many journalists argue that hidden cameras and other undercover
reporting techniques have long been necessary tools for exposing
vital issues of public policy and health. But many media experts
say television producers have overused them in recent years in a
push to create splashy shows and bolster ratings. The jurors, those
experts added, may have been lashing out at what they perceived as
undisciplined and overly aggressive news organizations.
<p>
   ``The irony of the Food Lion case is that those pursuing a noble
journalistic goal are being punished for the excessive and trivial
use of hidden cameras,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the
Project for Excellence in Journalism, a media ethics initiative in
Washington supported by the Pew Charitable Trust.
<p>
   Officials of all major television networks said in recent
interviews that they had tightened guidelines for when producers
can use hidden cameras and deception to report a program. But
Rosenstiel and other experts said they believed that further checks
may appear, particularly at stations lacking the financial
resources of a network to fight a costly legal battle.
<p>
   ``This verdict has the potential to chill important
investigative reporting and to prompt news organizations to back
off,'' said Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the
Poynter Institute, a program for journalists in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
<p>
   The 12-member jury never viewed the ``Primetime Live'' segment
at issue but was told by Judge N. Carlton Tilley Jr., who presided
over the case, to treat it as accurate. The panel, which
deliberated for six days, deadlocked twice before agreeing on
Wednesday's award. Punitive damages reflect a jury's decision that
a defendant should be punished for its conduct, and are intended to
deter such behavior in the future.
<p>
   In its decision, the jury ordered Capital Cities/ABC Inc. to pay
$4 million and ABC Inc. to pay $1.5 million to Food Lion, a
subsidiary of Etablissements Delhaize Freres et Cie ``Le Lion'' SA
of Belgium, which operates 1,100 stores in 14 states. Richard
Kaplan, ``Primetime Live'' executive producer at the time of the
broadcast, was ordered to pay $35,000 in punitive damages, and Ira
Rosen, the senior producer of the program, was told to pay $10,750.
<p>
   Several members of the jury said in interviews Wednesday that
although they supported investigative reporting, they took issue
with ABC's methods. In particular, they pointed to the use by
network producers of false resumes to gain jobs in Food Lion stores
in South Carolina and North Carolina.
<p>
   ``I don't have anything against undercover investigations,''
said Carla Jackson, a receptionist from Winston-Salem, N.C. ``I
like them. But if you are going to do them, just do them legal.''

<p>
   Several jurors also blamed ABC's legal department for failing to
oversee the activities of the segment's producers properly and said
they did not see the $5.5 million award against the network as
onerous.
<p>
   ``In my opinion, this was a slap on the wrist,'' said Tony
Kinton, a brewery worker from Reidsville, N.C. ``I had problems
even giving punitive damages, but I think that somebody needs to
call it to their attention. You know, that they have to go about
gathering the news in a different way.''
<p>
   In their deliberations, the jurors considered punitive damages
against the network ranging from $1 to $1 billion, one juror said.
<p>
   Tom Smith, president and chief executive of Food Lion, said the
company was pleased with all of the jury's verdicts in the case.
``This case is not about money,'' Smith said. ``We believe that
this jury has said that ABC must be held accountable when it breaks
laws that everyone else is expected to obey.''
<p>
   Arledge, the ABC executive, said that the network never approved
the use of undercover reporting lightly and that those connected
with the Food Lion segment had believed their actions were lawful.
He called the panel's decision ``ridiculous'' and said Food Lion's
lawyers had diverted jurors' attention.
<p>
   ``Their lawyers managed to fight a battle that really had
nothing to do with the essence of the story,'' he said.
<p>
   In the 1992 ``Primetime Live'' segment, the network accused Food
Lion of selling spoiled meat, tainted fish and rotten produce. The
company started litigation against the network even before the
segment was broadcast, and its stock plummeted once the segment
appeared.
<p>
   Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of NBC ``Dateline,'' a news
magazine that also uses concealed cameras, said he was disturbed by
Wednesday's verdict but added that his program would not change its
policies because of it.
<p>
   The verdict, however, may well bring more plaintiffs into the
courtroom. Johnson, the lawyer in Los Angeles, said recently that
he had eight active hidden-camera cases against ABC, NBC and CBS.
But now, he said, there could be more.
<p>
   ``I think this is going to open the floodgates to the extent
that networks still have the guts to produce hidden-camera stories
where impersonation is used,'' he said.

<p>
   In an action described as ``outrageously unfair'' by an ABC
executive, the Fox News Channel Wednesday included unused material
or ``outtakes'' from ABC's Food Lion report in its coverage of the
jury decision against ABC.
<p>
   Fox received the outtakes from Food Lion, the supermarket chain
that won $5.5 million in punitive damages from ABC Wednesday.
Presenting several minutes from them in news reports all day,
announcers said that they showed that Food Lion may have had an
even stronger case against the network because the tapes seemed to
show ABC had engaged in unethical practices, like staging evidence
of spoiled meat.
<p>
   Representatives from CBS, NBC and CNN said that their network
had not been offered the material by Food Lion and that, in any
case, it was unlikely they would have chosen to broadcast it,
unless it was presented in full context.
<p>
   Teri Everett, the spokeswoman for ABC News, said the network had
not been informed in advance by Fox that it intended to use the
material supplied by Food Lion.
<p>
   John Moody, the vice president of news for Fox, said he had
asked ABC to have an executive available for comment about an hour
after the first report appeared.
<p>
   David Westin, the president of ABC, said: ``I find it
outrageously unfair that a news organization would proceed that
way. The tape that Food Lion presented is a gross distortion of
what actually occurred.''
<p>
   Moody said that Fox did include an official statement from the
president of ABC News, Roone Arledge. That addressed the jury
award, not the outtakes from Food Lion. But he added that Fox did
bring on the ABC lawyer in the case to present his side on a
program Wednesday evening.
<p>
   Moody said Fox chose to use the outtakes provided by Food Lion
because they illuminated ``a very important aspect of this story.''

 &UR; What's the Real Story Behind Netscape's Perilous Slide? &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Herb Greenberg &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
A month or two ago, when I asked a number of prominent investment
pros which Internet stocks would be worth owning for the long-haul,
the one name that kept coming up was Netscape. They said the real
story was in the business of providing browsers and other software
to businesses, for use on intranets, and that the threat from
Microsoft was overblown. &HT;    Since then, the stock has lost around one-third of its value,
falling another 75 cents yesterday to close at $41.50. The slide
started after several analysts, including one or two big bulls,
began questioning the company's fourth quarter.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   That's noteworthy because in its short life, Netscape has always
beaten analyst estimates by a longshot.
<p>
   Suddenly, it appears, by all accounts, the Mountain View
Internet software maker had to scramble to drum up last-minute
sales just to meet analyst estimates. That's not usually a problem
software companies have in the early years of their lives.
<p>
   How could a company that was supposedly so hot get so cold so
quickly?
<p>
   Or is it really still hot, and are the events of the past few
weeks merely a series of rumors feeding on themselves?
<p>
   I've picked up two stories, both from credible sources. The
first is that midway through December, Netscape realized its sales
were about a quarter below internal expectations, resulting in a
mad dash.
<p>
   The second is that by the middle of December the company thought
it had more than met its goals, so the jubilant sales force took
off for the holidays. A week later they realized that somebody
counted wrong, and some sales had been double-counted and the
company was still well short of its goals.
<p>
   There are even rumors, fairly widespread, that Netscape has lost
a big customer (the name Chrysler has been mentioned) and that it
relied on one or two big transactions to make its sales quota. A
spokeswoman, however, categorically denies that a big customer  &MD; 
she specifically named Chrysler  &MD;  was lost. She adds that ``there
was no deal that was material to the company's results in the
quarter.''
<p>
   Furthermore, regarding what might have gone wrong with the
quarter, she says, ``I don't think people would have gotten that
cocky that they wouldn't try to close business'' by the end of the
quarter  &MD;  even if the company had already met its sales
projections.
<p>
   What does appear to be certain, however, is that the composition
of Netscape's business is changing. Now, instead of just selling
Internet browsers and servers, it's also trying to create broader
software solutions for businesses, adding such features as e-mail
and other tools that allow employees to talk with one another.
Those are markets already dominated by Lotus and Microsoft, and
``Netscape has to displace an incumbent to win,'' says longtime
Netscape bear Bill Smith of Merrill Lynch.
<p>
   Furthermore, last week Smith told his clients that by struggling
to make the fourth quarter, the company may have been forced to
steal business from the first quarter, which traditionally has been
weak for software companies.
<p>
   More details are likely to come out Tuesday, when Netscape
releases earnings. Never has an earnings release, or the subsequent
conference call with analysts, been so important for the company:
Any convincing arguments by execs that everything is hunky-dory
could give investors a reason to think Netscape's stock, at these
prices, is a bargain.
<p>
   Anything else, and, well, Netscape could join the ranks of those
companies whose stocks become damaged goods.

   An item here yesterday, elaborating on an item from the day
before, mentioned that Data Broadcasting's earnings two years ago
had been inflated because of a one-time ``charge.'' Obviously, that
should have been ``gain.'' Yet another case of my brain and
fingers, up against a tight deadline, disagreeing with one another.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Dragged down by a steep decline in the price of IBM
shares, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.87 points
Wednesday to close at 6,850.03, ending a run of four consecutive
sessions that set new closing highs.
<p>
   While the blue chips slumped, the Nasdaq composite index surged,
reaching its fourth consecutive closing high on the strength of two
of IBM's technology rivals: Microsoft and Intel. The Nasdaq
composite index of all the market's stocks rose 11.09 points, to
1,388.06.
<p>
   IBM, Intel and Microsoft have all reported strong fourth-quarter
earnings in the last eight days, and all three have warned
investors that their rates of growth may slow in the coming year.
<p>
   But shares of Intel and Microsoft have rallied on the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index since their reports, while IBM's
stock price sputtered Wednesday after it reported its earnings
after the market's close on Tuesday.
<p>
   Analysts said that while Microsoft and Intel warned of slowing
growth in the coming quarters, both companies have strong prospects
for the future. By contrast, IBM's warning means that the company
is forecasting what some analysts consider just average corporate
growth this year.
<p>
   ``IBM is saying their rate of growth is slowing to corporate
averages,'' said James M. Meyer, an analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott in Philadelphia. ``Microsoft and Intel are slowing to rates
that are well beyond corporate averages. What IBM is saying is a
little less appetizing.''
<p>
   Though IBM's earnings rose 18 percent last quarter from the
corresponding period a year earlier, revenue was up only 6 percent;
some analysts had been looking for a double-digit increase.
<p>
   ``If IBM is going to be characterized as a growth company, I
think it's imperative that you have above-average revenue growth,''
Meyer said. ``Analysts are generally looking for growth of about 15
percent.''
<p>
   Wednesday, IBM's stock suffered all day. The stock fell as many
as 13 points in early trading, before recovering some of its loss
to close down 10 a share, to 158. The drop of roughly 6 percent
accounted for most of the Dow's loss.
<p>
   Meanwhile, shares of Microsoft and Intel have made impressive
gains. Those two companies, along with other big technology stocks
 &MD;  like Dell Computer and Compaq Computer  &MD;  continue to lift broader
market indexes. On the strength of Microsoft and Intel, the Nasdaq
100, an index of Nasdaq's 100 largest stocks, gained 11.79 points,
to 925.52. This year, the Nasdaq 100 is up nearly 12 percent, far
outpacing the Dow's gain of 6.2 percent.
<p>
   Indeed, nearly half the gain of the Nasdaq 100 this year is
attributable to Microsoft and Intel, the index's two largest
stocks. Shares of Microsoft rose 2], to 97], a new high, and Intel
gained 4 1/16, to 152[, also a record high. IBM, Intel and
Microsoft were also three of the four most actively traded stocks
Wednesday, accounting for more than $5 billion worth of shares.
<p>
   Rising stock prices lifted the Dow Jones average close to 6,900
points Tuesday in what has thus far been a roaring January bull
run, but Wednesday the blue-chip index got a lesson in what can
happen when one stock begins to deflate.
<p>
   ``That tells you a little bit about this market,'' said Richard
E. Cripps, an analyst at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ``IBM is a
bellwether stock, and traditionally a stock like that has been able
to affect the whole market. But this market was able to isolate
IBM.''
<p>
   In other words, while IBM's stock sank Wednesday, dozens of
other technology stocks gained. Compaq was up 4~ a share, to 83],
and Dell rose 2|, to 66}.
<p>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks also bucked the Dow
decline, rising 3.51 points, to 786.23, a closing high of its own.
The New York Stock Exchange composite also rose 1.23 points, to
412.80, in a volatile session of trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was 587.3 million shares; declining issues outpaced
advancers, 1,328 to 1,222.
<p>
   Other issues doing well Wednesday include banking stocks. Shares
of Wells Fargo rose sharply again Wednesday, gaining 8], to 297[.
Shares of the bank holding company rose 9 points Tuesday, after it
said that while its net income slipped last quarter, its operating
profits rose.

   With Oscar De La Hoya waiting in the wings for a big payday in
April, Pernell Whitaker might be expected to take Diobelis Hurtado
lightly for their World Boxing Council welterweight title fight at
the Atlantic City (N.J.) Convention Center Friday night.
<p>
   But Whitaker, who started out as a lightweight, concedes that he
learned a valuable lesson in the first of his two, and only, fights
last year against Wilfredo Rivera. Admittedly unmotivated and
unprepared for that bout last April in the Netherlands Antilles,
Whitaker was lucky to emerge with a split-decision victory.
<p>
   Forewarned and prepared  &MD;  and determined to dispel suspicions
that he might have begun to slip  &MD;  Whitaker clearly outpointed
Rivera in their 12-round rematch five months later.
<p>
   ``I'm not looking ahead to De La Hoya,'' the 33-year-old WBC
champion insisted before his final workout Wednesday at a health
club in Atlantic City. ``This has been one of my best training
camps, and I feel that I'm at the best I've been since 1993. I know
I have to be focused for this one.''
<p>
   Whitaker, 39-1-1 since turning professional in 1994, spent as
much time during and after a news conference talking about De la
Hoya as he did about Hurtado.

 &UR; $59 Buys Internet for a Lifetime &QL;  &LR;

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
Move over, America Online. &HT;    A San Jose startup,  &LR; bigger.net, is taking on AOL and other
Internet providers by offering unlimited Internet access without
monthly fees.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Beginning today,  &LR; bigger.net says it will charge consumers $59
for unlimited, lifetime use of the Net. It will ask for a $10
annual deposit to maintain users' e-mail addresses.
<p>
   Customers will receive a CD-ROM program of Netscape Navigator
browser software to set up an account, although the service also
works with Microsoft's browser.
<p>
   Unlike AOL's popular service  &MD;  which has mushroomed to 8 million
users  &MD;  the new site does not provide content and will depend
entirely on banner ads for revenue.
<p>
   The ads will appear in a boxed area on users' computer screens,
while they cruise the Net.
<p>
   ``We want to make the Internet available to people who can't
afford subscription fees of $240 to $360 a year,'' said company
chief executive Jeff Fortin. The service will initially be
available in most of San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda
and Contra Costa counties. Fortin said the 1-year-old company plans
to launch operations in Los Angeles and San Diego by mid-March and
nationwide throughout 1997.
<p>
   The latest Internet service provider, which employs 18, says it
is the first to eschew the monthly charges that AOL, Microsoft,
AT&AMP;T WorldNet and others have adopted to win customers.
<p>
   While that business model has resulted in millions of consumers
jumping onto the Internet bandwagon, it has created unprecedented
congestion on the Net.
<p>
   AOL, in particular, has been besieged by online traffic. Since
it went to a flat-rate pricing scheme of $19.95 per month on
December 1, its system has buckled under the weight of 1 million
new users.
<p>
   The spike in online use last week prompted AOL chief executive,
Steve Case, to plead with users to cut back their time online
during peak hours.
<p>
   To avoid the same gridlock problems that have bedeviled AOL,
 &LR; bigger.net said it is limiting its capacity to 200,000 people over
the next three months.
<p>
   In addition to Netscape,  &LR; bigger.net says it has enlisted the
help of MFS Worldcom, Bay Networks and Acclaim Technology for
equipment and services.
<p>
   Even with that kind of backing,  &LR; bigger.net faces a ``tremendous
challenge'' of adding customers while building a national network,
according to analysts.
<p>
   ``AOL so far has failed because they're laying the tracks while
the train is running,'' said Allen Weiner, an analyst at Dataquest,
a San Jose market research company.
<p>
   Consumers can order the  &LR; bigger.net service after noon today at
(800) 228-1992.

    &UR; COMMENTARY: PATRIOTS' TERRY GLENN, A SURVIVOR, A WINNER
<p>
    &UR; By KIRK BOHLS &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  You notice the eyes first. Terry Glenn stares at
you with his big, brown eyes, and they seem to be sad eyes. Sad but
proud, very proud. Eyes that have seen a life of welfare, a paltry
existence shared with a single- parent mother and a younger
half-sister, a life shattered by the senseless murder of his mother
when he was but 13.
<p>
   Terry Glenn is a survivor. You can see it in his eyes.
<p>
   With his dark mustache and short goatee, this handsome man is as
neatly groomed as his early life was chaotic and ragged. The voice
of the New England Patriots wide receiver never falters as he
traces a life that seemed headed for an end that was more tragic
than magic.
<p>
   He grew up destitute. At times Glenn and his mother, Donetta,
and half- sister, Dorothy, had no electricity or gas in their
Columbus, Ohio, apartment. Through welfare checks, they made ends
meet or at least come close. Glenn never knew his father, has never
heard from him and doesn't want to.
<p>
   One afternoon when he and Dorothy were at an aunt's house, the
police called, saying they had discovered a body in an abandoned
building and were seeking identification. Glenn all but expected
the next call telling him his mother had been beaten to death by an
acquaintance, a man who stalked her for weeks and who now is
serving a sentence of 13 to 40 years.
<p>
   ``I just cried,'' he says softly. ``I started thinking about the
consequences and asking if she was really gone. I was wondering
what would I do. It intensified the hurt I had.''
<p>
   For the next year, Glenn lived in four different homes of
relatives. The relatives who passed him around talked of placing
him in a children's services home. Dorothy moved in with her father
in Akron.
<p>
   ``It was like there was nothing to live for,'' he says. ``It was
so devastating I didn't want to go on. It hurt.''
<p>
   Glenn became friends with June Henley, who also played football,
most recently as a star running back for the Kansas Jayhawks. He
readily accepted the Henley family's offer to put him up one night.
He stayed for eight years. They became his legal guardians.
<p>
   Football remained his other salvation.
<p>
   In all likelihood, his Patriots wouldn't be readying to meet the
Green Bay Packers in Sunday's Super Bowl without Glenn  &MD;  his
quarterback, Drew Bledsoe, said as much  &MD;  and Glenn certainly
wouldn't be a 22-year-old celebrity but for football. He might not
even be alive.
<p>
   Football kept him on the outskirts of trouble in his rough
neighborhood in Columbus when his best friends were immersing
themselves in it.
<p>
   Football got him into Ohio State, where he walked on and became
the nation's most explosive receiver. He played in the same
90,000-seat Ohio Stadium where he used to hawk soda water in the
stands for $30 a tray. At least, that's what he could have made,
except for the fact he never sold more than half that because he
was too occupied watching the games.
<p>
   The game made the 5-foot-11-inch, 184-pound rookie the
first-round pick of the Patriots even though Coach Bill Parcells
was bent on selecting a defensive player.
<p>
   Parcells says Glenn wasn't forced on him by his team's scouting
department, which rated the receiver the highest player on its
draft board. The department spends about $2 million a year making
such evaluations. ``I'm not stupid,'' the coach says. ``I've used
him the best I can.''
<p>
   He also mentally abused him with some denigrating putdowns.
<p>
   ``Bill likes good players,'' Patriots defensive coordinator Al
Groh said. ``In my pre-draft work, I saw a lot of Big Ten
linebackers and a lot of Ohio State games. Every game I'd see one
of those Terry Glenn plays. What are Terry Glenn plays? Bigs ones.
Long ones.''
<p>
   Those plays didn't come as quickly in New England. A pulled
hamstring and Parcells' own impatience prompted the head coach to
refer to Glenn as ``she.'' On Tuesday, Parcells defended the
much-publicized incident and said, ``People in Boston know it was a
joke. I still call him that.''
<p>
   If Parcells was questioning Glenn's toughness and mental makeup,
he was testing the wrong guy. Glenn never blinked, never broke.
Some wonder if his reservoir of tears hadn't been depleted.
Parcells never apologized.
<p>
   ``It didn't bother me at all,'' Glenn says. ``I was more
concerned about getting on the field and not being a bust.''
<p>
   Instead, he busted out in a big way. He caught 90 passes, an NFL
record for rookie wide receivers, for 1,132 yards and six
touchdowns. In two playoff games, Glenn led the Patriots with six
receptions for 102 yards and should be a critical a factor in New
England's chances Sunday night.
<p>
   True to the rest of his life, Glenn did it the hard way and said
he won his coach over with an eight-catch performance against the
New York Giants. That was the regular-season finale.
<p>
   Glenn will soon return to Columbus to spend time with his
8-month-old son, Terry Jr., and also to speak to kids in school who
might be unfocused or unwanted.
<p>
   ``I want other kids to know my story,'' Glenn says. ``Something
good can come out of something bad.''

 &UR; AGE NOT STOPPING SHURMUR IN HIS SUPER BOWL RUN &QL;  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE SCHOENFELD &QL;  &LR;  &QC;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Green Bay Packers assistant coach Johnny Holland
was telling a story earlier this week about going to New Orleans
International Airport to pick up his son's baby-sitter.
<p>
   ``He is talking about making sure everything goes smoothly, how
his baby-sitter is old, how she's 65,' '' said Packers defensive
coordinator Fritz Shurmur.
<p>
   ``I said, `Timeout, this is a 64-year-old you're talking to.'
<p>
   ``He said, `Yeah, but you're in a 45-year-old body.' ''
<p>
   The subject of age comes up frequently with Shurmur. Nearly
every time he has interviewed for a head coaching job in the past
decade, it's been a contributing factor in not getting the job.
<p>
   Twice the Cardinals interviewed him, once when Joe Bugel got the
job, and again two years ago when Vince Tobin was hired. In
between, he was the team's defensive coordinator from 1991-93.
<p>
   On Tuesday, the St. Louis Rams hired 60-year-old Dick Vermeil, a
move that perplexed Packers offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis,
who also has been passed over for head coaching jobs. ``I threw my
hands in the air,'' Lewis said. ``I couldn't understand the
logic.''
<p>
   Shurmur didn't get upset. He's just happy to be in the Super
Bowl for the first time in his 21 years coaching in the NFL.
<p>
   ``When I got out of (college), I thought I'd coach high school
10 to 12 years and then be a principal,'' Shurmur said. ``I wasn't
on the fast track. I'm a survivor. I've been fortunate. I have
really good health. I still have a lot of energy. I've been blessed
with all that, and I have a wife who has been able to tolerate all
this nonsense.''
<p>
   Shurmur said he won't be upset if he leaves pro football without
getting a head coaching opportunity because ``I'm not motivated by
that.''
<p>
   But he has been motivated to get to the Super Bowl. Four
previous times, he has coached in NFC title games but lost: Twice
with the Los Angeles Rams (1985 and '89) and once with the Packers
('95).
<p>
   ``It became apparent to me in my fourth NFC championship game
that the success was tied to the home field,'' Shurmur said. ``This
is the first time I had the home field. It is important to fight
during the season so you can play that last game on your field.''
<p>
   Shurmur began his NFL coaching career with the Detroit Lions in
1975. In '79, he went to the Patriots, and he became their
defensive coordinator the next year.
<p>
   In 1980, he hired a defensive line coach, Bill Parcells, now
head coach of the Patriots.
<p>
   Parcells said Tuesday he credits Shurmur for ``breaking me into
the league.''
<p>
   ``He was out of football when we hired him,'' Shurmur said.
``The first time I met him, I could tell he was really a bright
guy. He was a quick-minded guy who had a great command of the
game.''
<p>
   Shurmur also is considered a real student of the game. He has
written three books: Coaching Team Defense, The Five Linebacker
Eagle Defense and Coaching Team Defense, second edition.
<p>
   The Packers finished with the NFL's best defense this season,
but he refuses to take the credit.
<p>
   ``I'm coaching in the best place in the world for doing what I
do,'' he said. ``We've got a good chance to win. Ron Wolf (general
manager), Mike Holmgren (head coach) and Bob Harlan (president and
chief executive officer) create a great environment. Everyone in
the state is interested in what we do. It's a small town, and I
have a house on a lake that I can fish. So, there aren't many more
things in life I need.''
<p>
   Shurmur, who also has a houseboat at Lake Havasu, would like one
more thing  &MD;  a victory in Sunday's Super Bowl.
<p>
   ``I'm glad to be here, but if I hadn't gotten to the Super Bowl,
the game wouldn't have owed me anything,'' he said. ``I know a lot
of guys who tried but didn't make it to the Super Bowl. I'm
grateful for the opportunity, and it's hard for me to describe my
feeling after the (NFC title) game, when it hit me we were coming
here to the Super Bowl.''
<p>
   Even if the Packers win Sunday, he knows many still will think
he's too old to become a head coach in the NFL. There have been 10
openings this year, and he hasn't been interviewed for any job.
<p>
   ``People ask my why I'm not higher on the list,'' he said. ``I
say, `Go see the people who make those lists.' ''

 &UR; Levi's Will Dump Its Britannia Sportswear &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is seeking a buyer for its Brittania line of
apparel, a brand that has never regained the luster it achieved
among jeans-wearing teen-age girls during the 1970s. &HT;    Citing a decision to concentrate on its core business of more
upscale clothing, San Francisco-based Levi's said it has asked
Morgan Stanley to peddle Brittania Sportswear Ltd., which it
acquired a decade ago.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``When (Levi's) bought it, it was a terminal case, and they've
never been able to get it off the ground,'' said Alan Millstein,
president of Fashion Network Report in New York.
<p>
   ``It's not a designer name, it has no sex appeal, and probably
they don't want to put big advertising dollars behind it, which
would be the only way they could sustain it,'' he added.
<p>
   Brittania once was a leading department store brand but now is
sold by mass merchants such as Kmart.
<p>
   Millstein said the brand has faced growing competition in recent
years from low-priced, in-house casual labels such as J.C. Penney's
Arizona and Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Canyon River Blues.
<p>
   Levi's spokesman Vada Manager said Brittania has been ``a
success'' for the company, though he declined to comment on
Brittania's earnings or profitability.
<p>
   Manager said Levi's decided to sell Brittania so that the
company could focus on its three core brands: Levi's, Dockers and
Slate, a dress pant introduced last year.
<p>
   ``We believe Britannia could be viable as a stand-alone business
and has a future in the mass-market area,'' Manager said. However,
Target stores, one of Brittania's major retailers, has been phasing
out sales of the brand for several months.
<p>
   Another big outlet, Kmart, said it's uncertain whether it will
continue to carry Britannia, its second-largest line of denim
clothing after Wrangler (for men) and Chic (for women).
<p>
   Brittania produces jeans for men and women. It also makes men's
and boys' casual pants and tops, leather accessories, socks, shoes,
underwear, outerwear, watches and fleece.
<p>
   The clothes are sold under the label ``Brittania by Levi's,''
indicating that Levi's attempted to capitalize on the cachet of its
name without selling its core products in discount stores.
<p>
   Brittania was purchased by Levi's in 1987 from Asian Pacific
Industries, which at the time was in chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings.

    &UR; COST OF ENDING EARLY-RELEASE PROGRAM DISPUTED
<p>
    &UR; By MIKE WARD &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  A proposal to abolish a controversial
early-release program for Texas convicts ran into money trouble
Wednesday, as a House leader predicted it could cost a whopping $2
billion over five years.
<p>
   The previous price tag, according to the proposal's Senate
sponsors, was $400 million.
<p>
   ``There goes the governor's property tax relief, right there,''
House Corrections Committee Chairman Rep. Allen Hightower said.
<p>
   ``We'll fill all the (extra prison) beds we have now. We'll have
inmates backing up in the county jails again,'' said Hightower, a
Huntsville Democrat whose committee oversees prison programs.
``We'll need to build lots and lots of additional beds in the next
five years, another prison construction program like the one we
just finished.''
<p>
   But Sens. John Whitmire and Jerry Patterson, the Senate sponsors
of the proposal, challenged the $2 billion estimate, which
Hightower said he calculated on his own.
<p>
   ``That's horse manure,'' Patterson, R-Pasadena, said of the $2
billion estimate. ``The real issue here is the state budget ... how
any surplus is going to be spent, whether doing away with mandatory
supervision is worth whatever cost there is.''
<p>
   Whitmire, D-Houston and chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice
Committee, system, agreed. ``The bottom line is if we want to do
this, we can make it work,'' he said.
<p>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who has campaigned to abolish the mandatory
supervision program and urged the Legislature last week to
fast-track the change into law, also thinks the cost will be much
less than Hightower estimated, said his press secretary, Karen
Hughes.
<p>
   In fact, Hughes said, Bush plans to include the $42.9 million
cost of abolishing the program for violent- and sex-crime offenders
in his upcoming budget proposal. Because that group of convicts
totals only about 2,714 felons during the next two years, that
could be far less costly than including the 80,745 who otherwise
would be eligible.
<p>
   Under the Whitmire-Patterson bill, automatic release from prison
on so- called mandatory release would abolished for violent- and
sex-crime offenders. They could not be freed early unless parole
officials approved.
<p>
   All other felons who are freed on mandatory supervision could be
subject to that same review, according to Patterson.
<p>
   While mandatory supervision was outlawed for violent offenders
in 1987, and automatic mandatory release was done away with for all
other offenders two years ago, felons who were convicted before
then could still be released automatically.
<p>
   That is what the Whitmire-Patterson bill wants to stop. The
measure is slated for a Senate hearing Feb. 4.
<p>
   When a similar bill was debated two years ago, it faced
opposition over its cost and questions over whether it was
constitutional to change the rules for convicts already sitting in
prison.
<p>
   In the end, the Legislature opted to abolish mandatory release
only for future convicts.
<p>
   Patterson and Whitmire insist they have resolved the legal
questions: The change will alter no one's sentence, they said. It
will require only that before they can be released from prison they
will have to be approved by the parole board.
<p>
   Convicts' sentences will not change, Patterson said. They will
just serve their time inside a prison rather than outside one, on
mandatory release supervised by a parole officer.
<p>
   The cost of abolishing mandatory supervision promises to figure
heavily in the debate on the bill. With limited money available,
and the list of budget demands growing by the day, the Legislature
will have to decide whether to approve it as proposed and cut other
state programs, or scale it back.
<p>
   And for many lawmakers, the last choice may prove the least
acceptable  &MD;  with Bush and crime victims' groups with lots of
political clout pushing for the entire program to be abolished.
<p>
   ``This is an important issue for a lot of people,'' said Rep.
Peggy Hamric, R-Houston, author of a House bill that is similar to
the Whitmire-Patterson measure.
<p>
   Hightower said he intends to closely examine the cost of the
proposals. ``We don't have unlimited money to spend down here,'' he
said.
<p>
   According to a new estimate forwarded Wednesday to Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, the Whitmire-Patterson bill could cost $134 million during
the next two years  &MD;  and a total of $412 million in five  &MD;  in
prison operating expenses alone, not including the cost of building
any new prisons.
<p>
   The estimate also shows that abolishing mandatory supervision
for all convicts would create a backlog of 3,642 felons in county
jails by next fall  &MD;  and as many as 14,489 felons by 2001. If
mandatory supervision were abolished only for violent and sex-crime
offenders, there would be no backlog this year but it could reach
4,054 by 1999.
<p>
   Whitmire said he sees no reason there should be any backlog. He
said Texas has enough beds in empty prisons and county jails to
house all those felons in the next few years, and could even send
home the 5,000 out-of-state convicts housed in jails if it needs
that space.
<p>
   ``You have to weigh the costs against what is in the public
good,'' he said. ``And in this case, I think it's for the public
good that these inmates stay inside prison  &MD;  even if it costs us
some money.''

<p>
   LOWELL, Mass.  &MD;  To most people beyond this city, Paul Tsongas
was the man with the odd voice who made a quixotic run for the
presidency in 1992. No one really believed that Tsongas was going
to be president.
<p>
   To Lowell, he was the favorite first son whose extraordinary
relationship with this once dying mill town transformed it, and the
people who live here. The local newspaper, The Sun, made Tsongas'
legacy clear in Sunday's front-page obituary: ``He leaves his
family and the city he resurrected.''
<p>
   Because of Tsongas' vision, Lowell, an industrial city of
103,000 people about 25 miles northwest of Boston, has a national
historic park that draws thousands of tourists each year, a minor
league baseball team, a new stadium on the way, a Sheraton hotel,
14 new schools, thousands of jobs and, as important as all the
bricks and dollars, renewed civic pride.
<p>
   ``He made it cool to be from Lowell,'' said James Cook, one of
the former senator's legions of hometown friends and director of
the Lowell Plan and the Lowell Development Finance Corp., a
nonprofit economic development group started by Tsongas.
``Twenty-two years ago, you used to say you lived north of Boston.
Now you say you're from Lowell, and proud of it.''
<p>
   Tsongas, a Democrat who died of pneumonia on Saturday at the age
of 55 after a long battle with cancer, went to Washington as a U.S.
representative in 1975, and was elected to the Senate in 1978. He
stunned nearly everybody in 1984 when he decided to retire after
one term because of his cancer. But he never left Lowell or, in a
way, his first job in politics as a Lowell city councilor.
<p>
   Two weeks before his death, from his hospital bed in Boston, so
weak that nurses had to dial the phone for him, he was calling
around town to make sure there were enough City Council votes to
keep the planned baseball stadium downtown, Cook said. (The council
voted 9-0 in favor of the downtown site.)
<p>
   Tsongas never passed up an opportunity to promote his hometown,
not even in death. In an extraordinary public relations stroke, he
arranged for a public wake to be held at his Victorian house, in
the stately neighborhood where the mill owners once lived, so the
mourners would have a chance to see Lowell.
<p>
   Thousands of people  &MD;  from the waitresses who served him coffee
to Mayor Edward Caulfield and to people from all over the state who
never met him but wanted to pay their respects  &MD;  have filed past
his coffin and through his beloved city this week.
<p>
   ``He was the pillar of the Lowell community,'' said 71-year-old
Arthur Anton, the owner of Anton's Cleaners and a friend of
Tsongas' father, who also owned a dry cleaning business, as he left
the Tsongas house on Tuesday evening. ``He had an ability to get
people to respond to his vision, his dreams. We're so proud of him
for what he has done for us, and what he left us.''
<p>
   With his back bent against the biting cold, Anton stood on the
sidewalk, talking about the Lowell National Historical Park, which
was signed into federal law in 1978, thanks to Tsongas' efforts.
<p>
   ``We would never have the park if it weren't for Paul,'' Anton
said. ``You know how many tourists we get now because of it? They
all come to see how the mills began, the quilt museum, the mill
girls.''
<p>
   Tsongas' funeral, to be held Thursday, is another opportunity to
show off a revitalized Lowell. The funeral cortege is scheduled to
go from the Transfiguration Church past Cawley Stadium, where the
baseball team, the Spinners, will play until the promised new
stadium is built; past the Paul E. Tsongas Arena now under
construction, and the newly renovated Lowell High School, and onto
the Lowell Cemetery, high on a ridge overlooking the Merrimack
River, where Tsongas will be buried near his Greek immigrant
parents, Efthemios George and Katina Tsongas.
<p>
   It is also in deference to Tsongas' wishes that all week his
friends and colleagues have been talking up the city even as they
have been grieving for the man.
<p>
   ``He'd be kicking us right now if we weren't doing our jobs
promoting the city,'' Cook said. ``He had arranged that we would
all talk to the media when and if it happened. It was the same
thing when he was running for president. He joked that it was his
marketing campaign for the city of Lowell.''
<p>
   Tsongas' obsession with Lowell could be exasperating to those
who wanted him to be president.
<p>
   ``There we were on the presidential campaign plane, and he would
be talking to somebody about some zoning regulation in Lowell,''
said Edward Jesser, a Boston political consultant, who was Tsongas'
media adviser during the former senator's campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination five years ago.
<p>
   From the campaign trail, from Washington, from his hospital bed,
Tsongas stayed in touch with Richard Howe, the elder statesman of
the Lowell City Council. ``He was always a Lowellian,'' said Howe,
who has served on the council since 1965.
<p>
   When Tsongas was elected to the council in 1969, Lowell, an
industrial city of Greek, Portuguese and French Canadian
immigrants, had double-digit unemployment. Nearly half a century
after the mills had moved South, the city's downtown business
district was blighted by abandoned and dilapidated buildings.
<p>
   ``Between 1950 and 1970, Lowell just hit rock bottom,'' Howe
said. ``For youngsters graduating from high school, the only goal
was to get out of Lowell. Our goal was to change the mood and the
atmosphere and the direction government was going.''
<p>
   Over time, Howe and a group of others, led by Tsongas, made
Lowell a place where people wanted to stay. As a congressman,
Tsongas was able to secure millions of dollars in state and federal
funds for improvement projects for Lowell.
<p>
   He did menial labor, too. One of the rituals of life in Lowell
was seeing Tsongas at work in Kittredge Park, the green space that
he had helped restore.
<p>
   ``I would drive down the street, and there would be this former
presidential candidate sweeping the leaves out of the gutter,''
said the Rev. David Malone, the pastor at the Eliot Church, whose
hundreds of Cambodian parishioners reflect the changing
demographics of Lowell. ``It's one of the most powerful images in
my 55 years as an American citizen. He'd be there with his broom
and a dustpan.''
<p>
   Three weeks ago, Cook said, Tsongas called him from the hospital
to ask him to bring him three photographs  &MD;  one of the arena under
construction, another of the new supermarket being built in the
Acre neighborhood, and one of Kittredge Park.
<p>
   Cook had the pictures taken, and brought them to the hospital.
``We set them up on his windowsill,'' he said.
<p>
   ``He loved this city as much as anyone I ever met,'' Cook added.
``Every team needs a coach or a cheerleader. He was both for
Lowell.''

 &UR; Clothier Says He's Not Too Small For Levi's Britches &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Steve Rubenstein &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
A barrage of complaints helped persuade Levi Strauss to keep
selling blue jeans to an old-fashioned Illinois store with
crumbling plaster walls that the San Francisco company had found to
be too funky for its britches. &HT;    The store, Rathert Clothing, won its reprieve after Illinois Lt.
Gov. Bub Kustra fired off an impassioned letter to company
headquarters on Battery Street, saying its decision to drop the
store in the town of Red Bud was ``greatly troubling.'' A local
congressman weighed in with a letter, too.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Last month, after sending a crew to videotape conditions at
Rathert Clothing, the 144-year-old company said it would no longer
do business with the 110-year-old store because the company was
seeking more ``high-image retail customers.''
<p>
   The store said it would have to shut down because about 90
percent of its trade is in Levis.
<p>
   Carl Zschiegner, an assistant manager at the store, acknowledged
that Rathert Clothing is in an old building with crumbling plaster,
exposed wiring, leaning shelves and a furnace in the changing room.
<p>
   ``We're not real modern, but we always paid our bills,'' he
said.
<p>
   The store was among two dozen that Levi Strauss and Co., which
got its start in 1853 peddling tough pants to California gold
miners, planned to drop as part of a new program to spiff up its
image. The company said those stores include dry cleaning and
pornography establishments.
<p>
   In its letter to store owner Don Rathert, the company said his
store ``does not provide the type of retail environment that is
consistent with the Levi brands' product positioning.''
<p>
   After a flood of angry calls, faxes and letters, the company
relented.
<p>
   ``We made the decision to work with him and take a look at his
situation,'' said Levi's spokesman Gavin Power. ``We want to talk
with him about his business and the fact that he's so dependent on
our products.''
<p>
   News of the pants cutoff led to big business over the weekend.
The southwestern Illinois store, which usually sells two dozen
pairs of pants a day, sold about 200.
<p>
   Rathert said he has been selling pants so long that ne not only
knows his customers' names but their waist and inseam measurements,
too. The extra business over the weekend was a mixed blessing, he
added.
<p>
   ``There's too many people coming in,'' he said. ``I don't want
that much business. It's hard on the legs, hard on the neck, hard
on the back, hard on the feet.''
<p>
   Rathert Clothing occupies a 140-year-old German colonial style
building on Main Street. There is one aisle, lined on both sides
with wooden tables piled high with jeans.
<p>
   ``We're not fancy; we just sell jeans,'' Rathert said.

    &UR; WATER BILL DEEMED A TOP PRIORITY FOR LAWMAKERS
<p>
    &UR; EDs: With WATER-BOX; WATER-BROWN.
<p>
    &UR; By RALPH K.M. HAURWITZ &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  A comprehensive water bill filed Wednesday in
the Texas Senate would require statewide drought planning and
stepped-up conservation but would preserve the traditions of local
control and landowner access to ground water.
<p>
   The measure  &MD;  a moderate reform of state water law rather than
radical surgery  &MD;  would, if enacted, stand as the most important
advance in water policy in 40 years, said Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, an
architect of the bill and the lead-off speaker at a news conference
to unveil it in the Senate chamber.
<p>
   ``This is an opportunity for everyone ... to participate in the
deliberations of what I consider to be the most important bill that
Texas will face this session,'' Bullock said. ``Our very survival
depends on it: water.''
<p>
   Gov. George W. Bush, whose top legislative priority is
property-tax reform, issued a statement applauding Bullock and the
measure's sponsor, Sen. Buster Brown, R-Lake Jackson, for bringing
the issue to the forefront.
<p>
   ``The drought of 1996 highlighted the need for Texas to conserve
water and plan for the future, and I look forward to working with
the Legislature to do so,'' the governor said.
<p>
   The 166-page measure, which was given the symbolically important
designation of Senate Bill 1, emerged from months of closed-door
discussions involving state officials and legislative leaders. No
House version has been filed.
<p>
   The bill would require drought planning at the local, regional
and statewide levels; adoption of conservation measures by cities,
water districts and other suppliers; environmental and economic
studies before water could be transferred from one river basin to
another; and protection of fish, wildlife, bays, estuaries and
in-stream flows when new water rights are granted. In addition,
fines for unsafe dams and levees and for unauthorized water
diversions would be raised sharply.
<p>
   The Legislature last rewrote significant portions of the water
code in 1985. Bullock expressed hope that the issue would not be
shelved as it has been many times since he first joined the
Legislature as a member of the House in 1957.
<p>
   Brown, chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee,
pledged that the bill would not die. Citing serious ground water
shortages in parts of Central Texas and critically low surface
supplies in the Rio Grande Valley, Brown said the state is
ill-prepared under current law to manage water properly.
<p>
   ``It is obvious that we must begin to act now to establish a
sound, comprehensive water policy for Texas,'' Brown said. Bullock
said he asked the bill's drafters to be ``bold'' and
``controversial,'' asserting that nothing less than the gross state
product  &MD;  the value of all goods and services  &MD;  depends on an
adequate water supply.
<p>
   However, the measure stops short of revising what could have
been the most contentious issue, the rule of capture. The rule is a
legal principle established by the Texas Supreme Court in 1904 that
allows landowners to pump virtually unlimited quantities of ground
water from beneath their property. The bill also does not establish
a sweeping system of centralized control of water resources, as
recommended in a 1993 report by the state auditor's office.
<p>
   Still, the bill would narrow the scope of the capture rule, by
making it easier to establish ground-water districts and granting
such districts broader powers to regulate spacing of wells and
pumping. The rule of capture would prevail outside such districts.
The omission of the capture rule from the provisions addressed by
the bill reflects the lawmakers' and the governor's strong support
for private property rights.
<p>
   Officials of the state's three main water agencies  &MD;  the Water
Development Board, the Natural Resource Conservation Commission and
the Parks and Wildlife Department  &MD;  said the measure offers
long-overdue relief from antiquated policies.
<p>
   Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Parks and Wildlife
Department, said state water planning historically has glossed over
environmental issues. For example, the reservoir-construction boom
following the record drought of the 1950s reduced natural river
flows for fish and wildlife. Bays and estuaries, which provide
multimillion-dollar fishing industries, depend on adequate flows to
maintain the delicate balance between salt water and fresh water.
<p>
   ``It is time for healthy rivers, lakes and estuaries to be
counted among our highest water-use priorities,'' Sansom said.
<p>
   Other reaction to the bill was somewhat muted, mainly because
few people had read it.
<p>
   ``I'm excited about the issue being put on the front burner,''
said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra
Club, an environmental group. ``The fact that it rates Senate Bill
1, an introduction by Lt. Gov. Bullock and sponsorship by the
chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee is a pretty good
sign that something is going to happen this session.''
<p>
   Bill Couch, executive director of the Barton Springs/Edwards
Aquifer Conservation District, a ground-water district in southern
Travis and northern Hays counties, said he was pleased by the
additional authority the bill would provide. For example, smaller
wells currently exempt from regulation would come under his
agency's scrutiny, he said.
<p>
   Bob Stallman, president of the Texas Farm Bureau, the state's
largest agricultural organization, said it was too early to offer
an assessment. The bureau supports local underground water
districts but also supports private property rights, he said.

   PELOSI (Washington) - Just hours after completing a six-year
term on the House ethics committee, San Francisco Congresswoman
Nancy Pelosi provides an inside look at the investigation into
House Speaker Newt Gingrich  &MD;  an inquiry so secret she once had to
ask her husband to leave the bedroom at 3 a.m. as she conducted
business on the phone. In a lengthy interview with the Chronicle,
Pelosi accused GOP leaders of obstructing the ethics process in

``coward,'' deserving of harsher penalties and ethically unfit to
serve as speaker. By Marc Sandalow (Story will move in washington

    &UR; EDs: With WATER-TEXAS.
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
    &MD;  Preserves the rule of capture, a legal principle dating to
1904 that allows landowners to pump essentially unlimited
quantities of ground water regardless of the effect on stream flow,
spring flow and neighbors' wells.
<p>
    &MD;  At the same time, modifies the scope of the capture rule by
making it easier to establish new ground-water conservation
districts, which can regulate pumping to varying degrees. Also
grants new powers to such districts. The rule of capture would
prevail outside districts.
<p>
    &MD;  Requires the Water Development Board to prepare a
comprehensive state drought plan. Creates a committee with
representatives from various state agencies to oversee drought
response.
<p>
    &MD;  Requires water-management planning by cities, water districts
and other water suppliers and water-rights holders. Such planning
would include conservation to ensure efficient day-to-day use as
well as drought-contingency measures to curb lawn watering and
other nonessential uses during dry spells.
<p>
    &MD;  Mandates regional drought planning. For example, the Lower
Colorado River Authority, the City of Austin and other units of
government in Central Texas would prepare a regional plan in
addition to individual plans.
<p>
    &MD;  Requires the Natural Resource Conservation Commission to hold
public meetings and to conduct a detailed financial and
environmental analysis before approving transfers of water from one
river basin to another.
<p>
    &MD;  Grants the conservation commission authority to issue
citations for unauthorized use of surface water. Also increases the
civil penalty to $10,000 from $1,000 and grants administrative
penalty authority as well to the agency.
<p>
    &MD;  Provides legal recognition of the link between surface water
and ground water. Users of each type and regulatory agencies would
have to consider how ground water use affects surface water, and
vice versa.
<p>
    &MD;  Eases legal roadblocks to reuse of treated waste water for
irrigation and other purposes. Also promotes such reuse.
<p>
    &MD;  Raises to $25,000 a day from $1,000 the civil penalty for
failure to repair or remove an unsafe dam. The penalty for unsafe
levees would rise to $25,000 from $100.
<p>
    &MD;  Expands the consideration given to fish, wildlife and bays.
For example, ground-water districts would have to consider spring
flow and related habitat when authorizing new wells.

<p>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - With apologies to Ernie Els, the two best
young players in the world are camped out this week at the $1.5
million Phoenix Open, which gets under way Thursday and runs
through Sunday at the TPC of Scottsdale.
<p>
   There's no question that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are the
people's choice to hook up in Sunday's final round. Whether that
dream match-up can materialize is anybody's guess, but considering
the past two Opens have ended in a playoff, you never know.
<p>
   For those who have forgotten, Mickelson was the ``next Jack
Nicklaus'' before Woods grabbed the hype last fall when he turned
pro.
<p>
   Since that time, Woods has three victories and has knocked down
some pretty solid foes in playoffs  &MD;  Davis Love III in Las Vegas,
and Tom Lehman, in a one-hole, quick-draw contest at the
season-opening Mercedes Championship.
<p>
   Mickelson hasn't had to work overtime since a year ago, when he
went head to head with Justin Leonard in this tournament,
prevailing on the third playoff hole. It was intense stuff, as
Mickelson 1-putted the last seven greens. Bizarre, too, as the
playoff was held in a circus-like atmosphere with several drunks
serving as ringmasters.
<p>
   Mickelson vs. Woods would be even greater theater. Not
surprisingly, the dynamic duo don't quite see it that way. Neither
do their peers.
<p>
   ``You know, I've been asked that question, and I've thought
about it a lot, and to be honest with you, I don't ever see
rivalries developing as prominent as they used to be with, say,
Arnold (Palmer) and Jack (Nicklaus), or Jack and Tom (Watson), or
now even Greg (Norman) and Nick (Faldo),'' Woods said of the
possibility that he and Mickelson would face off many times in the
future.
<p>
   ``I don't ever see it developing quite like that because there
are so many good (young) players now  &MD;  Ernie Els, Phil, David
Duval, Steve Stricker, Justin Leonard. I mean, it goes on and on.
It's very hard for just two to be singled out.''
<p>
   Mickelson also doesn't know what lies ahead. But you get the
feeling that he's honing his flop shot for a chance at Woods.
<p>
   ``We've never even played in the same group,'' Mickelson said.
``But I think it would be cool to go head to head with him coming
down the stretch on Sunday, because he's such a great competitor.
That would be fun.''
<p>
   Both players' games seem capable of it. Woods was a little wild
during Wednesday's Xerox Siler Pro-Am, perhaps the result of an
evening of playing pool at Stixx &AMP; Jetz.
<p>
   Woods, however, is better than most even on a bad day, and his
tremendous power off the tee is tailor-made for the TPC. The long
hitters have even more of an advantage this week, as the fairways
are soft from recent rains.
<p>
   Mickelson said he's ``a little hesitant to get too high'' about
his game. But he likes the condition of the course, with the rough
up and the greens firm.
<p>
   Still, there's no getting away from the fact that Mickelson and
Woods are the favorites in the 72-hole chase.
<p>
   Mark Brooks, the PGA champ, would agree with that. He even went
as far as to say that Woods and Mickelson are the best two young
players in the game, and he made no apologies to Els.
<p>
   ``There's no question about that,'' Brooks said. ``But the odds
are against them ever developing a rivalry. First of all, they'll
only play in about 12 to 14 events together. Then, you've got 100
guys who can win any week. About the only place you might see (a
rivalry) develop is in the majors.''
<p>
   Mark Calcavecchia, the all-time leading money-winner of Phoenix
Open, and the only two-time champ at the TPC, added this qualifier
about a Mickelson-Woods rivalry.
<p>
   ``I don't think so, unless they get in four sudden-death
playoffs together ,'' said Calcavecchia, who will be paired with
Woods during the first two rounds.
<p>
   Could Mickelson handle Woods, who at this point seems to be a
real tiger in playoffs?
<p>
   ``Oh, sure. Timing is everything, and even though Tiger is
obviously very good, he's got a lot of good breaks,'' Calcavecchia
said. ``Or, looking at it from the other end, nothing has gone
against him (in a playoff).''
<p>
   That certainly was the case in the Mercedes, where Woods watched
Lehman hit a 6-iron into the water on the playoff hole, then, with
the pressure slightly off, stuck a 6-iron to within 8 inches of the
cup.
<p>
   Lehman gets another shot at Woods this week, but he's not
thinking about another head-to-head playoff.
<p>
   ``Well, I'm aching for another shot at playing well,'' said the
Scottsdale pro, who admitted he's struggling a bit. ``But I don't
feel I'm playing against Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson or Nick
Price or Paul Azinger. You just want to beat up on the golf
course.''
<p>
   Like his peers, Lehman doesn't foresee the Woods-Mickelson
rivalry dominating the future golf scene. It's not the same as when
Nicklaus ruled the world, he added.
<p>
   ``Phil and Tiger both have the potential to have a long time at
the top, where guys are shooting at them. Both have the capability
of being dominant, really dominant players,'' he said. ``Whether
they get into a rivalry or not, that's just chance.''
<p>
   One that many fans are hoping begins with a playoff on Sunday.

    &UR; STUDENTS AT SPEAKER'S FORMER COLLEGE HOLD MOCK ETHICS VOTE
<p>
    &UR; By MARLON MANUEL &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   MARIETTA, Ga.  &MD;  ``Newt Gingrich''  &MD;  actually a 48-year-old
bespectacled piano teacher playing the role of House speaker  &MD;  was
cleared of three ethics charges Wednesday, once the judge
deciphered what the charges were.
<p>
   The mock verdicts were rendered by an introductory American
government class at Kennesaw State University.
<p>
   Eight ``prosecutors'' and eight ``defenders'' shuffled through
evidence  &MD;  newspaper clippings and Internet documents highlighted
in Day-Glo Yellow  &MD;  in a presentation more like ``The People's
Court'' than Court TV.
<p>
   ``We're not law students,'' said Dale Hartsfield, 39, one of the
Gingrich defenders. Asked if he watched the genuine ethics hearings
on TV, Hartsfield said, ``Who has time? We're college students.''
<p>
   Joe Camillo of Marietta, the faux Gingrich acquitted by the
class, was urged by students to take the role of the Republican
leader. A bulky music major, Camillo dressed in a black suit and
carried a black briefcase.
<p>
   His chief qualification: ``He was the only one with gray hair,''
said political science teacher Kerwin Swint, whose class conducted
the project.
<p>
   Seventy-three students considered whether Gingrich broke tax
laws, lied to Congress and received improper gifts from GOPAC, his
political action committee. (Ethics committee special counsel James
Cole alleged Gingrich violated the tax-exempt status of the
Kennesaw State foundation and interviewed school officials during
the actual investigation of Gingrich.)
<p>
   The class cleared Gingrich on all three counts. The closest vote
was 38-35 on the question of whether he lied to Congress.
<p>
   ``That indicates they paid attention and really thought about
it,'' said Swint, who called the project a ``lesson in democracy.''
<p>
   In a defense that would have made Dick Armey proud, 18-year-old
Nicole Burgess of Acworth labeled the charges a ``political smear
against Gingrich and the Republican Party.''
<p>
   Characterizing herself as a political moderate, Burgess viewed
the project ``as more of a challenge to defend Newt, given all the
press against him.''
<p>
   Camillo said wading through research material was daunting. ``It
shows that it's important to stay plugged in with what's going
on,'' Camillo said. ``You should keep trying to get the facts out.
It's easy to get complacent.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  President Clinton's nominee for commerce secretary,
William M. Daley, said on Wednesday that if confirmed he would take
steps to depoliticize the department, which Republicans say has
become an outpost of Democratic Party fundraising.
<p>
   In a clear attempt to defuse any complications for his own
nomination and to suggest that he has a reform-minded agenda as
Republicans prepare for congressional hearings on campaign finance,
Daley said he would eliminate 100 of the 260 politically appointed
jobs within the Commerce Department by the end of the year. He also
said he would suspend all the department's international trade
missions for 30 days while he develops guidelines for choosing
participants to insure that no special consideration goes to big
political donors.
<p>
   ``Let me say without hesitation, as someone who has spent many
years in and around the political process, that there is a place
for politics in public life,'' said Daley, a son of one Chicago
mayor and the brother of another. ``But there is no place for
politics in the Department of Commerce.''
<p>
   Daley's pledge to depoliticize the department came one day after
President Clinton announced new restrictions on Democratic
fundraising, including a ban on donations from non-citizens living
in the United States and from American subsidiaries of foreign
companies.
<p>
   Testifying at the opening of his confirmation hearings before
the Senate Commerce Committee, Daley never mentioned John Huang,
who served for a year and a half in a politically appointed trade
job at the department and then went on to become a senior
Democratic fundraiser. Huang's fund-raising activities are at the
heart of questions about whether the Clinton administration traded
access or influence for political donations.
<p>
   Similarly, Daley did not directly address longstanding
complaints by Republicans and nonpartisan campaign-finance watchdog
groups that Ronald Brown, who served as commerce secretary from
1993 until his death in a plane crash last year, had sometimes
favored Democratic supporters in assembling trade missions to
foreign capitals. Brown's trips often gave those American business
executives who accompanied him access to foreign leaders and
provided them opportunities for new deals.
<p>
   Daley's promise to make the department less partisan won
cautious praise from Republicans on the committee, and he
encountered almost no tough questions on the subject.
<p>
   ``Clearly, Mr. Daley, you have an additional responsibility to
make sure that any taint of politicization or illegal behavior is
eradicated as quickly as possible within your department,'' said
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee's chairman. ``You
have shared your commitment to me to do that, and I certainly take
you at your word and have every confidence that you will do so.''
<p>
   Indeed, Daley was confronted with little of the partisan rancor
that has surrounded the Commerce Department in recent years, going
back to Republican efforts after the 1994 elections to eliminate
the department.
<p>
   The hearing had gone on for more than two hours before Daley
faced a direct question about whether it would be more efficient to
slim down or to eliminate the department, although he had
repeatedly argued without prompting that it played a critical role
in insuring the competitiveness of American industry.
<p>
   Much of the questioning, in fact, suggested why the department
has proven difficult to shrink, much less eliminate. One after
another, senators of both parties asked about specific programs of
concern to their constituents, from Sen. John Kerrey, D-Mass., who
urged continued efforts to help the fishing industry, to Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, who urged him to look into a program that
affects some of his state's most remote islands.
<p>
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said the department had helped finance
successful education and training programs in his state, and he
said Daley should limit his efforts to scale back.
<p>
   ``You can eliminate 100, but don't go too far,'' Ford said.
<p>
   While there are no trade missions scheduled to be led by the
commerce secretary over the next month  &MD;  in fact, there have been
only a handful of secretary-led missions since Brown's death  &MD;  the
30-day ban would affect a host of smaller missions. These are
usually led by political appointees or career officials at the
Commerce Department.
<p>
   Over the next month, according to Commerce Department officials,
such missions were scheduled to Hong Kong, France, Eastern Europe,
Canada, Australia, Argentina, India and Indonesia. They will be
rescheduled, officials say, after Daley completes his review of how
the missions are organized.
<p>
   Suspending the missions was Daley's idea, and it is bound to
ruffle some feathers within the department. Some officials there
view the missions themselves as the embodiment of Brown's legacy at
the department, and the suspension as an implicit criticism of how
they were handled under his tenure.
<p>
   Brown and other Commerce officials from his era always denied
any political favoritism.
<p>
   Mickey Kantor, who succeeded Brown, reduced the overall
employment level at the Commerce Department by about 5 percent,
chiefly through attrition. But he made no overt step to overhaul
the trade mission program.
<p>
   The cut in the number of political appointees at Commerce would
bring the figure more in line with the Treasury Department and
other large Cabinet departments.

   INDIANAPOLIS  &MD;  Yes, he had been serious about entertaining
offers from the New York Knicks. And, yes, he believes the rivalry
still lives.
<p>
   ``The Hatfields and McCoys, all over again,'' Reggie Miller said
Wednesday after the Indiana Pacers prepared for Thursday night's
game at Market Square Arena. ``Both teams don't like one another.
They don't pretend like they like one another, and that's fine with
us.''
<p>
   Miller, who was one of the players New York considered courting
in the off-season, said he understood why the Knicks chose Allan
Houston instead. ``He's a lot younger, and you can understand what
they were going for,'' he said. ``They got two players for the
price of one. My price tag was a little higher than Allan's, where
they couldn't have gone out and got Chris Childs if they got me.''
<p>
   Of the differences between Starks and Houston, he added:
``They're two different players. I think Allan is a better
offensive threat than John, but I think John plays much better
defense than Allan.''

    &UR; HAND-MADE TOOLS THOUGHT TO BE OLDEST FOUND IN ETHIOPIA
<p>
    &UR; By MIKE TONER &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  Among humans' earliest ancestors, ``tool time'' began
more than 2.5 million years ago.
<p>
   Crude stone tools found in an Ethiopian stream bed were
identified Wednesday as the oldest hand-made implements in the
world  &MD;  a discovery that pushes the advent of tool-making, and the
intelligence it required, at least 200,000 years further back in
time.
<p>
   Thousands of stone implements unearthed from ancient sediments
in Ethiopia's Gona River Valley show that early hominids had a
``surprisingly sophisticated'' knowledge of toolmaking, researchers
said Wednesday. They found a wide variety of stone flakes and
larger implements fashioned into a form that could be use for
cutting and chopping.
<p>
   ``These objects have been securely dated between 2.5 and 2.6
million years ago, which makes them the oldest known artifacts from
anywhere in the world,'' said Rutgers University anthropologist
Sileshi Semaw.
<p>
   In a report in the current issue of the journal Nature, Semaw
and J.K.W. Harris, chairman of the Rutgers anthropology department,
say the artifacts are so abundant in the area that subsequent
investigations at the site are likely to unearth even older tools.
<p>
   ``Some researchers think the beginnings of technology go along
with a hominid with an expanded brain,'' Harris said. ``In my 25
years experience in Africa, Gona is the richest site for addressing
questions related to human evolution in the time gap between 3
million and 2 million years ago.''
<p>
   Although the region, which includes Ethiopia's Afar badlands, is
best known as the home of Lucy, the fossil remains of a
small-brained, big-jawed, upright-walking species called
Australopithecus afrarensis, researchers have never found any sign
that Lucy's kin, which roamed the area more than 3 million years
ago, ever evolved tool-making skills.
<p>
   The Rutgers discovery, however, comes on the heels of the
Institute of Human Origins report in November that stone tools  &MD; 
similar in size, shape and function to those reported Wednesday  &MD; 
had been found alongside the remains of the jawbone of one of the
earliest known species of genus Homo. Those tools were dated to 2.3
million years ago.
<p>
   ``Modern human technology had humble beginnings,'' says British
anthropologist Bernard Wood. ``But there is no doubt that these
genuine and remarkably sophisticated artifacts push the onset of
tool manufacture back to at least 2.5 million years.''
<p>
   Before the two most recent discoveries, the earliest evidence of
toolmaking came from excavations in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania,
where anthropologist Mary Leakey documented similar stone artifacts
that were about 1.8 million years old.
<p>
   The most recent discoveries, however, make it clear that human
ancestors had tools  &MD;  and the intelligence to make them  &MD;  almost a
million years earlier.
<p>
   ``The Gona stone tools are very similar to those from Olduvai
Gorge,'' Semaw said. ``It is amazing to realize that the earliest
human technology went more than a million years with almost no
change at all.''

   NEW ORLEANS - Brett Favre was talking about his place in
football history when several members of the national press looked
up from their notepads and exchanged sidelong glances.
<p>
   ``If I had done (sniff) what Bart Starr has done,'' Favre was
saying, `I'd be bigger than Elvis now.''
<p>
   Favre sniffed again.
<p>
   Everyone heard it.
<p>
   It was impossible not to. Favre was speaking into a live
microphone. Each time the Green Bay Packers quarterback paused
between sentences or words and inhaled sharply, like a bloodhound
tracking a fresh scent, the amplified snuffling boomed over the
loud speakers, filling the ornate grand ballroom of the Fairmont
Hotel.
<p>
   Favre's remarks at Wednesday's Super Bowl news conference were
translated into 36 languages and piped to our Armed Forces
overseas. But the longer Favre went on about the Packers' balanced
offense and the importance of staying ``focused''  &MD;  the sports
cliche of the 1990s  &MD;  what the quarterback said seemed to take on
less importance than the tell-tale sniffs, which he used like
commas and periods.
<p>
   Occasionally, Favre lightly touched the back of his hand to his
nostrils. The New York Times looked at USA Today. A Milwaukee
Journal reporter wore a look of growing alarm.
Finally, someone raised a hand and asked the question of the day.
Brett, do you have a cold? &HT;    ``I do have a cold,'' Favre confirmed, sniffing again. The NFL's
Most Valuable Player blamed his condition on the weather change,
the Packers having been transported from 51-below-zero windchill in
Green Bay to 70 degrees in New Orleans.
<p>
   Favre said several teammates also are afflicted. ``We're all
(sniff) on Amoxicillin.'' Amoxicillin is an NFL-approved
antibiotic.
<p>
   It remains to be seen whether ``FAVRE ILL'' headlines will alter
the point spread for Super Bowl XXXI. The Packers probably will
remain 14-point favorites unless their star player develops other
symptom or complications, in which event Favre might show up on
Sunday sporting one of those dilator bandages across his nose.
<p>
   An athlete's ability to perform is influenced in large part on
his or her ability to breath  &MD;  the lone exception being
synchronized swimmers who can hold their breath for weeks.
<p>
   The importance of a healthy intake of oxygen has given rise to a
product fad that appeared at the Super Bowl two years ago. In
Miami, Jerry Rice wore what looked like an elongated butterfly
bandage across the bridge of his schnoz. Teammate Ricky Watters
wore one, too. So did William Floyd. The manufacturer points out
that in Super Bowl XXIX, those three players scored all seven of
the San Francisco 49ers' touchdowns.
<p>
   The bandages are called Breathe Right Nasal Strips. As mentioned
in a previous column, the patches are not to be confused with other
products, such as Breath Assure.
<p>
   Breath Assure is a vial of non-prescription pills that actor
George Kennedy claims cures bad breath. Most Americans had no idea
George suffered from the embarrassment of halitosis, but apparently
he does, or did, until the life-changing day he discovered the
amazing tablets he wholeheartedly endorses on late-night TV.
<p>
   Placed across the sniffer, the Breathe Right bandage pulls up
the outside of one's nose holes, and spreads them. It allows the
nose to draw in more air. Sort of a nasal turbocharger.
According to a press release, seven Packers and five Patriots use
them during games. And get this  &MD;  in the past two Super Bowls, 11
of the 15 touchdowns scored were by players wearing the strips. &HT;    It saddens me to think what a running back like Jim Brown might
have accomplished had this product been available in his day.
<p>
   If Favre is congested on Sunday, he would be crazy not to dilate
the old nasal passages. Maybe he would play better, maybe not. But
like Lombardi said, breathing isn't everything. It's the only
thing.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  With the now familiar sea of microphones and
platform full of cameras before them Bob Kraft, the owner of the
New England Patriots, and Bill Parcells, his head coach, Wednesday
appeared before the media to give the serfs and knaves another
day's morsel.
<p>
   For the last two months, these two have waged an intense, public
and amusing feudal war over title and fiefdom. Wednesday, Kraft
stressed once again that he wants Parcells back as coach next
season. But the fundamental issue is ego.
<p>
   Parcells wants full control over the football operation.
Parcells is unhappy with the title ``coach.'' This lowly
description no longer fits his lofty accomplishments: two Super
Bowl championships, possibly a third.
<p>
   At one level, he has a point. If a mediocre neophyte like Steve
Mariucci, hired as the 49ers' head coach after going 6-6 his first
and only season as a head coach at California  &MD;  if he is ``coach,''
then what does that make Parcells? Surely there must be a another,
higher designation.
<p>
   On Tuesday, Dan Reeves, a mere coach with the Giants, was made
head coach and head of football operations for the Atlanta Falcons.
<p>
   Dick Vermeil, who quit the business 14 years ago because of
``burnout,'' was introduced as the St. Louis Rams' new coach and
president of football operations. Jimmy Johnson is the head coach
and general manager of the Dolphins.
<p>
   Bill Walsh, the former San Francisco head coach, is the
modern-day model for the ``Imperial Coach,'' the man who heads up
every phase of the operation. Before that, legendary coaches like
Vince Lombardi and George Halas did everything.
<p>
   Back then, things were simpler,  &MD;  no players played both ways,
didn't wear facemasks and were tied to the team for life. Football
is a more complex place to play these days, and Vermeil should know
that the pressures that forced him to quit 14 years ago have
intensified. Now there are salary caps, free agency, players whose
salaries demand respect from the coach.
<p>
   The conflict for Kraft represents a choice between short-term
gain and constructing a foundation.
<p>
   ``It's hard to be dependent on any one person in any one area,''
Kraft said. Recalling the pitfalls of investing too much in one
person, Kraft recalled Parcells's health problems. ``Each of the
first two years I owned the team, he had a health problem,'' Kraft
said last week. His point was that he will not mortgage the
Patriots' future on one individual.
<p>
   ``If one person is the reason that everything's happening,'' he
said ``then you haven't built anything.''
<p>
   Kraft is fond of telling how, as a season-ticket holder since
1972, he sat on New England's cold aluminum seats as a mere fan. He
has taken an enormous leap  &MD;  from passionate fan on cold seats to
throne as King and owner.
<p>
   Now Parcells wants to be King. Next season he well may King of
the Jets. This could be like being appointed captain of the
Titanic.
<p>
   Think of Reeves in Atlanta and Vermeil in St. Louis, where the
owners were all too happy to relinquish control. Now they can win
either way: If the captain saves the ship the owner takes credit.
If the ship sinks, blame the coach.
<p>
   Thus, this demand to be the Imperial Coach could be seen as
protective layering in a brutal business. In New England, ``coach''
is no longer a fitting distinction for Parcells. Kraft should
declare himself Emperor and make Parcells a King: William of
Foxboro, King of the Patriots.
<p>
   Kraft's problem is simple. Bill Parcells is a genius as a coach.
But he is also like the talented pianist who one day tells the
conductor that he wants to play the clarinet and take over the
Palace orchestra as well.
<p>
   If everything is falling apart as it is in St. Louis and Atlanta
 &MD;  or in ruin as it is for the Jets  &MD;  you let Parcells play whatever
he likes.
<p>
   But organizations like the Giants, the Packers, the 49ers, are
not in ruin. Kraft is confident that the Patriots are not a sinking
ship.
<p>
   For New England fans, the pity is that with Parcells at the
helm, the young Patriots actually have an opportunity to be great
for years to come.
<p>
   But the coach wants to be King; the owner wants to be Emperor.
<p>
   Neither realizes that in the long run the Kingdom and the Empire
are about to be ruined.

<p>
   PHOENIX - They still tell stories about the ``Original Sun,''
Dick Van Arsdale.
<p>
   Snatched from the New York Knicks in the 1968 NBA expansion
draft, he scored the team's first basket on a driving layup, was
the Suns' first All-Star, played on their first NBA Finals team,
did TV-radio color commentary for 15 years, was their interim coach
in 1987 and is currently their vice president/director of player
personnel.
<p>
   Michele Timms can only hope for a ride as long and prosperous.
<p>
   She is the ``Original Mercury,'' expected to be the name of the
Phoenix Women's NBA franchise. The league allocation of its first
16 signees Wednesday had few surprises, with most of the eight
teams receiving a small and tall combination.
<p>
   Timms, a 5-foot-7 point guard from Australia, and Jennifer
Gillom, a 6-3 center, are the foundation for Phoenix Coach Cheryl
Miller, whose hiring is a done deal but has not been formally
announced.
<p>
   The next two players will come via an elite draft in about a
month, followed by local and national tryouts/combines and a second
draft of four more players. The final two of 10 roster spots will
be filled by free-agent signings, perhaps with local flavor such as
former Arizona State point guard Ryneldi Becenti.
<p>
   Ticket deposits (252-WNBA) already are being accepted for the
inaugural 28-game season (14 at America West Arena), which begins
June 21.
<p>
   Timms learned of her WNBA assignment while in Slovenia with her
current team, BTV Wuppertal, which last year became the first
German European champion. She will return to Australia in mid-April
and be in Phoenix before the start of training camp May 28.
<p>
   ``It's a relief. Now I can focus on Arizona,'' said Timms, who
admits her knowledge of the state doesn't go much beyond Lute
Olson, the occasional Skins Game, the Suns and the desert.
<p>
   ``This is an unbelievably exciting time and kind of scary in a
way, to think how big women's basketball can become worldwide. You
talk about Steffi Graf and tennis, but there are not enough female
role models.''
<p>
   Phoenix officials expect Timms to be that and the kind of floor
leader who lifted Australia to its first Olympic basketball medal,
male or female.
<p>
   ``She's a spark plug,'' said Bryan Colangelo, Suns general
manager. ``Between her, Jason Kidd, Kevin Johnson and Steve Nash,
we've got a corner on the point-guard market.''
<p>
   Timms' pro career averages (14.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, 3.8
assists, 2.2 steals) reflect her worth. She will turn 32 a week
into the season but said her health has improved since she reached
30.
<p>
   ``I'm the fastest I've ever been,'' said Timms, who scored 27
points in an Olympic semifinal loss to the gold- medal-winning
United States. ``I enjoy the transition style, and my defense is
one of my strengths.''
<p>
   Timms recently played against her new teammate, soon to be
33-year-old Gillom, a 1988 U.S. Olympic gold medalist who is with
the Sporting Flash in Greece.
<p>
   ``She goes to the boards strong, runs well and can put the ball
in the hole,'' Timms said. ``She doesn't stop for one minute.''
<p>
   The overall level of elite talent in the WNBA is extraordinary,
Timms said, even without the seven U.S. Olympians who signed
exclusive contracts with the American Basketball League.
<p>
   The consensus allocation winner is Los Angeles, expected to be
named Stars. It came away with not only 6-5 Lisa Leslie, the
leading U.S. Olympic scorer and second-leading rebounder, but point
guard Penny Toler, currently averaging 28 points and seven assists
in Israel.
<p>
   Sheryl Swoopes, another U.S. Olympic star, was assigned to
Houston but will not be available until August. She is scheduled to
deliver her first child in mid-June. The Houston team, expected to
be named Comets, could be considered for priority in the February
draft because of Swoopes' pregnancy.

<p>
   PHOENIX - Tonight, the Coyotes get a second chance to start the
second half of the NHL season, which is a lucky thing considering
the way they began it before the All-Star break.
<p>
   After going 18-19-4 through their first 41 games, they proceeded
to lose four of their next five, including three that were either
decided in the first minute of overtime or the final minute of
regulation.
<p>
   ``I agree this is a sort of second chance for us,'' right wing
Mike Gartner said. ``All the team in some respect get a fresh start
coming off the All-Star break. Some teams try to continue what they
had going, other teams try to get something going and you could say
we're in the latter category, obviously.''
<p>
   So with a 19-23-4 record and hanging onto a fourth-place tie
with Chicago in the Central Division entering Wednesday's games,
how important is tonight's match-up against the visiting Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and Saturday's game here against the Vancouver
Canucks?
<p>
   Extremely. Especially with a three-game trip right around the
corner at NHL powers Philadelphia, Detroit and Pittsburgh.
<p>
   ``I would say these next two games are as close to being
must-win games, if not must-win games, as you're going to get
during the course of a season,'' Gartner said. ``That's how I
certainly view it. I think we have to win these next two.''
<p>
   Both games are winnable. The Mighty Ducks and Canucks were each
struggling to play .500 hockey in the 10 games leading up to the
break. The Coyotes have lost three straight, but had their third
straight spirited practice Wednesday after not playing for a week,
a good sign entering two games on home ice.
<p>
   But that's been the problem. The Coyotes started the season with
plenty of good signs, from key free-agent additions and trades to a
very friendly home schedule, and the only signs they followed were
ones marked ``dead end.''
<p>
   ``The biggest disappointment in my book is our overall record,''
defenseman Brad McCrimmon said. ``We're a better team than our
record indicates. As for my thoughts involved right now, I'll just
keep to myself.
<p>
   ``We've got to start crossing some roads here in a hurry.''
<p>
   Ditto, said center Jeremy Roenick, who should significantly
increase his point output of 12 goals and 21 assists through 36
games.
<p>
   ``We need as much confidence as possible going into those three
games next week against three of the top teams in the league,''
Roenick said.
<p>
   The continued solid play of captain Keith Tkachuk (29 goals, 52
points) will be imperative. Just as critical will be starting
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, whose 20 losses are the second-most in
the league behind Toronto's Felix Potvin.
<p>
   ``Nik's going to be crucial,'' Roenick said. ``Anybody will tell
you, in order to go anywhere, you need a goaltender playing good.
If he gets on a streak, we're going to win a lot of games.''
<p>
   Coyotes Coach Don Hay said mental mistakes have been the club's
biggest downfall. They have been most noticeable at the end of
games, when the Coyotes have blown leads and ties, allowing teams
to skate away with an easy two points.
<p>
   ``We need to have pride in the way we're executing, have pride
in the way we're playing the game,'' Hay said. ``The guys have
stuck together and there's good leadership in the dressing room.
<p>
   ``Nobody's pointing fingers and everybody's working hard
together to become a better team.''
<p>
   The players know how important the rest of the season now has
become, Gartner said.
<p>
   ``The next three weeks in particular will in many ways set the
tone for whether we're going to make a good strong run at the tough
teams in our conference,'' Gartner said, ``or whether we'll be
swimming right until the very end.''

<p>
   LONDON  &MD;  Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of
the Titanic in 1912, died Monday night at a nursing home in
Southampton, England. She was 100.
<p>
   Titanic Historical Society vice president Karen Kamuda said in a
telephone interview Wednesday from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs.
Haisman's death left seven of the 705 survivors still living  &MD; 
three in the United States and two each in Britain and France.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the
sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The
ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old
at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.
<p>
   She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to
the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on
its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of April 14-15,
1912.
<p>
   In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the
National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite
monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in
public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her
father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it
from the wreckage.
<p>
   She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket
of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from
Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his
wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he
intended to open a new hotel.
<p>
   In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and
1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.
<p>
   In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography,
``A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave
a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details
have been called into question.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in
an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his
cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the
listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down
into a lifeboat.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night
and the loss of her father, and that even in her later years she
suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the
drowning victims in the Atlantic.
<p>
   It was 11:40 p.m. when she recalled being jolted in her
three-berth stateroom. ``Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she
recalled. ``He told us: `You'd better put on your life jackets and
something warm; it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've
struck an iceberg  &MD;  it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor
says it's nothing to worry about.'''
<p>
   They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their
haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of
bank notes on top of a bunk. ``We waited for ages on the boat deck
for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing
ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of
them. Everybody kept saying: `She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'
<p>
   ``Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people
got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into
the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we
could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She
watched the mighty liner go down.
<p>
   ``We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time
we had no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father
had got off the ship  &MD;  that's all I could think of.''
<p>
   She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia
and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle
to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and
had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to
South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a
shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.
<p>
   Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa,
Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the
boatyard. They had 10 children.
<p>
   Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman
had ``elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about
what her father was wearing, for example.
<p>
   ``This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said.
``On the contrary, it is only to point out how our memories fail us
as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and
many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from
the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat
pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a
purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.
<p>
   RMS Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits
artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting
the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to
a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ``What better use
for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his
child.''
<p>
   The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to
Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.
<p>
   By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father
in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.
<p>
   Mrs. Haisman was born Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four
sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

 &UR; BC-PELOSI-ETHICS-425&AMP;ADD-SFCHRON &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; REP. PELOSI ACCUSES REPUBLICANS OF `SANDBAGGING'' GINGRICH PROBE &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By MARC SANDALOW &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.1997 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Only hours after Rep. Nancy Pelosi's six-year
assignment to the House ethics committee came to an end, the San
Francisco Democrat accused Republicans of obstructing the
investigation into Speaker Newt Gingrich and called him ethically
unfit for the job.
<p>
   Pelosi, a Democrat, said that GOP leaders had ``sandbagged'' the
bipartisan inquiry in an effort to conceal evidence that proved
Gingrich had violated tax laws and lied to his colleagues.
<p>
   ``It's clear the Republicans will do anything  &MD;  anything  &MD;  to
protect Newt Gingrich,'' she said.
<p>
   In a lengthy interview with The Chronicle, Pelosi provided an
inside look at the controversial investigation into Gingrich  &MD;  an
inquiry so secret that she once had to ask her husband to leave the
bedroom at 3 a.m. so she could privately conduct business on the
phone.
<p>
   Free to talk now that her committee assignment has ended, Pelosi
said she believes that Gingrich should have been censured, which
would have cost him his job as speaker. She said she went along
with the lighter punishment out of concern that an extended battle
would have torn apart the House.
<p>
   ``He is such a hypocrite,'' Pelosi said. ``I think if a person
loved the House of Representatives, if he loved his party, he would
step aside.''
<p>
   The blunt words from the usually restrained sixth-term Democrat
underscore the partisan rancor that has marked the Gingrich debate
and reveal just how hard it will be for Gingrich to overcome the
ethical misconduct for which he received a reprimand and a $300,000
penalty Tuesday.
<p>
   Gingrich further revealed his ``disdain'' for the ethics
process, Pelosi said, by remaining in his private office as the
House debated his punishment, and then claimed through a
spokeswoman not to have even watched the proceedings on TV.
<p>
   ``You would have thought Newt Gingrich would have been present
at least at some point during the debate,'' she said. ``I think it
was a cowardly act.''
<p>
   Pelosi said the GOP, ``by stall tactics, by sandbagging, they
thwarted the ethics process.''
<p>
   Republicans were so intent on protecting their speaker, Pelosi
said, that they researched family trees and campaign documents of
ethics committee members, hoping to dig up dirt that might weaken
their position.
<p>
   ``They chipped away at their souls'' to save Gingrich, she said.
``Their attitude was they take no prisoners on this.''
<p>
   Pelosi maintained that some Republicans on their committee,
taking their orders from top GOP officials, ``flat-out sandbagged''
the investigation  &MD;  stalling the appointment of a special counsel
to look into the tax violations for which he was ultimately
punished, and refusing to investigate allegations that Gingrich
improperly received $250,000 from his political action committee
known as GOPAC.
<p>
   And they canceled a week's worth of public hearings on the
matter because they were afraid that special James Cole's testimony
would make it clear that Gingrich had intentionally misled the
committee, she said.
<p>
   ``What happened to the soul of the (Republican) party?'' Pelosi
said. ``Don't they know they shouldn't give their highest honor to
a person who has by his own admission brought discredit to the
House of Representatives?''
<p>
   Republicans denied Pelosi's accusation that their leaders
intervened in the ethics investigation.
<p>
   ``There is a very distinct wall between what the committee does
and what the leadership does,'' said Michelle Davis, a spokeswoman
for House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``It was a
bipartisan process and it worked. Clearly there was a group of
Democrats that wanted a harsher punishment, and a group of
Republicans who wanted a lighter one.''
<p>
    
 &UR; STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &LR; 
  Pelosi revealed that Gingrich knew of the punishment that was in
store for him as far back as December and was aware that if fellow
Republicans learned of the $300,000 fine, it might doom his chances
to be re-elected as speaker.
<p>
   Despite a commitment to keep all aspects of the punishment
secret, Pelosi said, she was stunned to pick up the paper New
Year's Day and learn that two GOP members of the committee had sent
out a letter to Republicans informing them there was no punishment
being considered that would endanger Gingrich's ability to become
speaker.
<p>
   Because GOP rules prevent a member who has been censured from
being named speaker, it in essence tipped members that a lesser
penalty was being considered.
<p>
   Pelosi said she was furious and briefly considered going public
with the $300,000 penalty. Ultimately she decided that such a
battle would ``explode the process,'' and perhaps allow Gingrich to
get off completely.
<p>
   ``We had to keep getting slapped all over the place in order to
get this endgame,'' she said.
<p>
   Gingrich's hold on the GOP was so strong, Pelosi said, that
Democrats were not certain that the House would go along with the
$300,000 penalty until the eve of the Tuesday's vote.
<p>
   ``This can never be a model for future investigations,'' she
said. ``It succeeded despite the actions of the full committee.
It's a shame. It's a disgrace to the House of Representatives.''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Comparing the embattled House of Representatives
with Bosnia, Rep. Jim McDermott said Wednesday that silence may be
the best solution to the ethics battles that embroiled House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and McDermott as one of Gingrich's chief
investigators.
<p>
   ``We can have a choice. This place is terribly dysfunctional. I
don't want to make it worse. ... And the tenor around here is one
of being tired of war,'' McDermott said in his first in-depth
interview after leaving the Ethics Committee amid a storm of
controversy.
<p>
   McDermott, D-Wash., talked about Congress's flawed ethics
process, ways of fixing it and his own past efforts to leave the
Ethics Committee. But he would not utter a word about the speaker.
Nor would he discuss the firestorm surrounding the tape of an
intercepted Gingrich phone conversation that was turned over to
him.
<p>
   The tape, recorded by Florida couple off an ordinary police
scanner, was leaked to the New York Times and the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, allegedly in violation of federal law.
<p>
   Silence may be golden for McDermott under the circumstances,
because the FBI is probing how the tape was made and how it got
leaked to the newspapers two weeks ago.
<p>
   Republican leaders quickly accused McDermott, who was the senior
Democrat on the Ethics Committee, as the one who leaked the tape.
McDermott has neither confirmed nor denied the charge, but
announced Jan. 14 that he was removing himself from the Gingrich
case.
<p>
   Three days later, the committee voted 7-1 to reprimand Gingrich
and for him to pay $300,000 for misleading the panel and bringing
disfavor upon the House in the probe of how he used tax-exempt
organizations to advance his partisan agenda. The full House
overwhelmingly endorsed this unprecedented penalty on Tuesday.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the McDermott controversy disappeared from the
headlines, but he has not been forgotten by his bitter foes.
<p>
   ``I can assure you a lot of people want to do that, to get a
pound of flesh from Jim,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
who is close to the House leadership.
<p>
   But Nethercutt indicated that a cease-fire is in the offing and
that Republicans will let the Justice Department investigate the
tape.
<p>
   ``I doubt this will be a public Ethics violation (charge),'' he
said, though about the FBI investigation, he added, ``I am
concerned that Jim is facing some tough problems.''
<p>
   ``I think people are tired of the scandal of the day,'' said
Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash.
<p>
   McDermott, a fifth-termer from Seattle, has been upbeat and out
and about in the Capitol and finds himself much talked about.
<p>
   He maintained in the interview that he can be just as effective
now as he was before the flap erupted over the tapes. He is one of
the few medical doctors in the House, and suggested that his
background is needed in Medicare reform and efforts to make health
care available to poor children.
<p>
   ``This House operates on the basis of what you know. At least it
used to operate like that. ... Members know what I have to
contribute,'' he said.
<p>
   Despite the professed hopes for political peace, the question
remains: can the House stop being a political killing field and
resume productive legislation?
<p>
   ``Hope springs eternal in the human breast,'' McDermott
responded with a laugh, which he then stifled, adding: ``I'm really
serious. This place is so dysfunctional there must be an end to it.
We must do something about Medicare, for instance, and lobbing
grenades is not the way to get it done.''
<p>
   McDermott said that upon taking power two years ago, the
Republicans tried to run the House like a British-style parliament
in which the majority rams its programs through, with little or no
consultation with the opposition. He likened the modern House to a
battlefield across which the parties had been firing cannon shells.
<p>
   ``We lose the ability to go to the center of the field and talk
about what to do,'' he said.
<p>
   McDermott has known little but war during the eight years he has
served in the House. The Democrats, when they were in the majority,
paid little heed to the desires of the Republicans, and Gingrich
led a Republican insurgency, attacking the Democratic leadership as
corrupt and plotting a Republican takeover.
<p>
   McDermott arrived just in time to see an ethics investigation,
inspired by Gingrich, bring down Democratic House Speaker Jim
Wright.
<p>
   This was followed by the furor over overdrafts in the House
bank, which fell on McDermott's watch as Ethics chairman. And there
was a scandal over misuse of office funds that sent Ways and Means
chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., to federal prison.
<p>
   ``In the eight years I have been here, beginning with Wright,
this place has been like the Balkans. And there is a real desire
for peace on the part of a significant majority,'' McDermott said.
<p>
   ``We want peace and to go back to some kind of thoughtful
process,'' he declared.
<p>
   McDermott acknowledged Wednesday that if he fired off a fresh
barrage at Gingrich it would ``disrupt what is a very delicate
balance.''
<p>
   ``Personally, it was not any good for me,'' he said of his
contentious six-year tenure on the Ethics Committee.
<p>
   He estimated that he had spent 270 hours in the committee room,
some of the time staring at a TV screen in which the House was
debating Medicare  &MD;  the issue that he had come to Congress to
tackle.
<p>
   ``I think there are 207 members in the Democrat Caucus. There
are 202 of them glad they are not on the Ethics Committee,'' he
said.
<p>
   McDermott went twice to House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt
during 1995 and asked to be relieved of his Ethics duties. Gephardt
handed the first letter back. He tore up the second and threw it in
the waste basket, McDermott recalled.
<p>
   The Gingrich investigation had been under way since August 1994.
Gephardt was wary of letting McDermott off the committee because it
would encourage an exodus of Republican members, allowing Gingrich
to hand-pick the Republican half of his own jury.
<p>
   But although he was unable to do that, Gingrich did enjoy close
relationships with the Republican members who were judging him. For
instance, he worked with Ethics chairwoman Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
Her support helped Gingrich climb the leadership ladder. She, in
turn, had ties to GOPAC, the political action committee that
Gingrich set up to win Republican control of the House.
<p>
   On the Democratic side, McDermott has made no bones about his
antipathy for Gingrich and his agenda.
<p>
   ``If you're looking for somebody pure, there ain't anybody,''
McDermott acknowledged, noting the partisan parity on the panel  &MD; 
five Republicans and five Democrats  &MD;  often makes it difficult to
reach consensus and resolve complaints.
<p>
   One possible reform, he said, would be to provide for a special
counsel to take over cases when the committee drags its feet. If
the panel does not act in 90 days, the counsel would come in.
<p>
   Republican leaders also are toying with a reform of the ethics
process, in which friends will not be forced to judge friends.
<p>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a member of the Republican
leadership, cited a proposal last year by the bipartisan team of
GOP Rep. David Dreier of California and respected senior Democrat
Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a former chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
<p>
   ``They suggested that the Ethics Committee be made less partisan
by putting judges and former (House) members on the committee,''
Dunn said. McDermott also voiced interest in that proposal.
<p>
   Dunn, who herself filed an ethics complaint against Gephardt
last fall, said there had been ``too much partisanship for a lot of
reasons'' in the investigation of Gingrich.
<p>
   She politely declined to talk about McDermott's difficulties.
<p>
   ``It just doesn't serve any purpose to get into negative
discussions of anybody in the (Washington state) delegation,'' she
said.

 &UR; JAMIESON READY TO RUN CARDS' OFFENSE &QL;  &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - During his introductory news conference Wednesday
at the Cardinals complex, Dick Jamieson was handed an old team
publicity photo of himself in which his hair was more abundant and
considerably darker.
<p>
   ``You see what two years with Ricky Watters does to you?'' said
Jamieson, 59, jokingly.
<p>
   For the past two season, Jamieson, new offensive coordinator of
the Cardinals, coached Watters and the Philadelphia Eagles' running
backs in an offense that is rooted in the same West Coast system as
that of the Cardinals.
<p>
   Jamieson might not be the last coach with ties to Coach Vince
Tobin and the Cardinals to rejoin the organization.
<p>
   With New York Giants new Coach Jim Fassel set to hire Cardinals
running backs coach Jim Skipper as Giants offensive coordinator
today, speculatation turned to Johnny Roland as a successor to
Skipper.
<p>
   Roland and Tobin were college teammates at Missouri in the
1960s, and Roland went on to become 1966 NFL offensive rookie of
the year and an all-pro for the Cardinals. For the past two
seasons, Roland was assistant head coach and running backs coach on
Rich Brooks' staff with the St. Louis Rams. Brooks was fired after
the season.
<p>
   Tobin refused to comment on the running backs coach situation
until the Giants make a formal announcement.
<p>
   Jamieson coached with Tobin at Missouri in the early 1970s and
was a Cardinals assistant for six seasons in the 1980s before they
moved to Arizona. In naming Jamieson offensive coordinator, Tobin
said the basic offense and terminology implemented by Fassel, who
held the job last season, will remain the same.
<p>
   Jamieson recalled warmly his first stint with the Cardinals,
when Ottis Anderson carried the ball, Neil Lomax threw it and Roy
Green caught it.
<p>
   ``We had some pretty good players,'' Jamieson said. ``We had as
good a running back as there was in the league at that time, an
all-pro quarterback who was just coming into his prime, and maybe
as good a wide receiver as there was in the league. And we played
pretty good defense on top of it. So my memories are pretty fond.''
<p>
   The Eagles' rushing game, led by the volatile Wattters, has been
among the NFL leaders the past two seasons. Rushing, and offense in
general, have not not been the Cardinals' strong suits, although
they made strides this past season under Fassel's direction.
<p>
   ``Statistics don't really tell the whole story,'' Jamieson said.
``Their average per rush (3.7 yards) was almost as good as ours
(3.8), yet everybody thought we ran the ball extremely well. So
it's all in how you look at it.
<p>
   ``(Cardinals free-agent fullback Larry) Centers is more known
for his receiving ability, but he does good things with the ball
when he carries it. (Leeland) McElroy has got a bright future in
the league. (LeShon) Johnson is like a human bowling ball when he
runs. So those things are in place.''
<p>
   Actually, Centers is not in place. He has been negotiating with
the Cardinals for a new contract since November. He grew close to
Fassel and Skipper. Their exodus might influence whether he stays
or goes. Centers did not return telephone calls on Wednesday.

<p>
   TUCSON, ARIZ. - Welcome to the Pac-10 Conference, where the home
floor is a fortress and everybody else is road kill.
<p>
   That, at least, appears to be the early trend in a basketball
season that leaves little, if any, margin for error for home teams
with any chance at the conference title.
<p>
   ``Any loss at home is devastating,'' Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said.
<p>
   After successive defeats at Southern California and UCLA,
fourth-place Arizona returns to McKale Center tonight with a sense
of urgency against an unlikely opponent. Oregon State (5-9, 1-4
Pac-10) shouldn't be a threat to the Wildcats (10-4, 3-2). After
all, 14 years and a couple of presidents have come and gone since
the Beavers' last victory at Tucson  &MD;  Jan. 29, 1983.
<p>
   But Olson isn't thinking about history these days. No, only the
current state of a very unpredictable conference worries him. He
believes a single loss at home will prove fatal to chances at a
conference championship.
<p>
   ``If you protect your home court and win five out of nine on the
road, you will probably have a share of the title,'' said Olson,
whose No. 11 Wildcats are 7-0 (2-0 in the Pac-10) at home this
season. ``I don't think you can afford to lose at home.
<p>
   ``Anybody who tries to predict the league right now is kidding
themselves. If you drop a couple here or there, it is not like you
are dead and buried. There are others who are going to have to face
the same things.''
<p>
   Proof of Olson's point is Oregon State. Last Saturday, the
Beavers upset Stanford, considered a conference contender, in
Corvallis, Ore. Stanford whipped Pac-10 leader UCLA at home a
couple of weeks ago.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a return home also dictates a return to fundamentals,
Olson said of the Wildcats, whose starting lineup is questionable
because junior guard Miles Simon has the flu.
<p>
   Simon, a starter against UCLA after regaining his academic
eligibility on Jan. 10, was unable to practice Monday and Tuesday.
He did run through some drills on Wednesday, however.
<p>
   ``It's basic things that we need to work on,'' Olson said. ``My
biggest single concern is finishing. We had unbelievable looks to
the basket against UCLA.
<p>
   ``I'm not sure we have played a game where we had more good
looks, open looks than what we had there. The guys have to
finish.''
Briefly
<p>
   The Wildcats have lost two successive games 11 times since the
1983-84 season, Olson's first at Arziona. During that span, Olson
teams have come back to win by an average margin of 19 points after
each time.
<p>
   In Arizona's four losses this season, junior forward Michael
Dickerson is averaging just 12 points. In Arizona's 10 victories,
his scoring average is 25.4 points.

<p>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - It's an old axiom of basketball that if you live
by the jump shot, you die by the jump shot.
<p>
   Lately, Arizona State has been fatally attracted to its outside
shooting.
<p>
   Even with the December addition of 6-foot-8 forward Mike
Batiste, the undersized Sun Devils need to shoot well from outside
to survive. The primary gunners are a trio of guards, junior Jeremy
Veal, sophomore Gee Gervin and freshman Eddie House.
<p>
   Since beating Jackson State on Dec. 20 and pushing its record to
6-2, ASU has lost six of eight games against Division I
competition. During that span:
<p>
   Veal is shooting 43 for 105 (41 percent).
<p>
   Gervin is 18 for 62 (29 percent).
<p>
   House is 32 for 88 (36.3 percent).
<p>
   Veal actually is shooting well from three-point range in those
eight games, 15 for 30, but Gervin and House are a combined 24 for
85 (29.7 percent).
<p>
   And let's not forget Batiste, who isn't shy about hoisting a
few. In the Sun Devils' two defeats in Los Angeles last week,
Batiste made only 8 of 24 shots, many coming from long distance.
<p>
   ``I don't think we're playing as I hoped we would,'' ASU Coach
Bill Frieder said. ``And that's primarily because of our perimeter
shooting. I thought by now we would have a team that could knock
down some threes.''
<p>
   Even Veal has not been consistent in that regard. He made 6 of 8
three-point attempts in the losses to UCLA and Southern California,
but before that was in a slump that prompted Frieder to take him
out of the starting lineup for a game.
<p>
   Veal, a junior, responded. But Gervin and House are different.
Although he is a sophomore, Gervin sat out last season because of
academics and is in his first season of college competition. House
is a freshman.
<p>
   Frieder has stuck with House throughout his difficulties, and he
finally showed some shooting life by making 3 of 6 three-pointers
against USC. But Gervin played only five minutes against the
Trojans.
<p>
   ``You feel like Eddie House is going to be a consistent
shooter,'' Frieder said. ``Whether it's going to be next game, next
week, next month or next season remains to be seen.''
<p>
   Frieder said he limited Gervin against USC because of practice
performance and because ``Southern Cal is very, very athletic, and
I thought Gervin would have problems with their pressure. . . . But
Gervin will be back.''
<p>
   Gervin, the son of NBA Hall of Famer George Gervin, said he
first had a ball in his hand (albeit a tennis ball) at the age of 1
and is prepared to deal with the inevitable slumps.
<p>
   ``I'll get out of it eventually,'' he said.
<p>
   House appears to be getting out of his slump.
<p>
   ``I'm getting open looks,'' he said. ``They're just rimming out.
It's not like I'm missing real bad. Everybody goes through that.
I'll keep working on it and eventually it will keep working itself
out.''
<p>
   As with other problems, Frieder cites lack of manpower as a
primary cause of the shooting woes. ASU has only nine healthy
scholarship players. Batiste's addition was offset by injuries to
Quincy Brewer and Okeme Oziwo, who likely are out for the season.
<p>
   ``We are not getting out of practice situations what you need to
get, just because of a lack of bodies,'' Frieder said.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  During his swing through the corridors of America's
business world this week, Alexander Lebed, the retired general who
aspires to be the next president of Russia, hobnobbed with
executives at Du Pont in Delaware and sipped tea with Wall Street
investors at the Harvard Club in Manhattan.
<p>
   And then he dropped in on the man who aspires to be the king of
New York capitalism.
<p>
   Lebed, meet Donald Trump.
<p>
   For almost an hour Wednesday, the two men conferred at Trump
Tower in a meeting that was declared off-limits to the press. What
could be in the works? A five-star hotel and casino smack-dab in
Red Square?
<p>
   Trump said he did indeed discuss his intentions to build
``something major'' in Moscow, maybe a hotel, maybe an apartment
building. And Lebed said he was all for it, with one caveat.
<p>
   ``The highest skyscraper in the world cannot be built next to
the Kremlin,'' Lebed joked. ``We cannot allow anyone spitting from
the roof of the skyscraper on the Kremlin.''
<p>
   But for all his jokes and witticisms, Lebed, 46, described his
mission as a very serious one. For while the ailing Boris Yeltsin
remains president of Russia, the campaign to replace him is already
under way, at home and abroad.
<p>
   And Lebed's visit to the United States has been widely viewed as
an attempt to win the support of American businessmen and to
portray himself as the one man who can lead Russia and pave the way
for investment and democratic reform there.
<p>
   ``He has come around to the idea that in an attempt to run for
the presidency, it's better to have the West in your corner,'' said
Steven Solnick, coordinator of Russian Studies at the Harriman
Institute at Columbia University.
<p>
   ``He may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support
from the Americans in the last campaign,'' Solnick said. ``Bill
Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the
International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the
government to make credible promises to pay wages.''
<p>
   Lebed received none of that support during his bid for the
presidency last year. The retired general, who won the hearts of
many ordinary Russians with his critique of the country's hasty
embrace of the free market, worried many American politicians and
investors with his sometimes autocratic demeanor and crude populist
outbursts.
<p>
   And while his popularity gave him a strong, third-place showing
at the polls and, briefly, a job as national security chief in the
Yeltsin administration, it did not automatically translate into
trust from the West.
<p>
   Lebed, who was dismissed from his post as security chief in
October, took the opportunity provided by an invitation to
President Clinton's inauguration Monday to visit the United States
for the second time in a little more than a month.
<p>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., offered the invitation at the behest
of an unnamed businessman from his state. And Lebed used the trip,
from Washington to Delaware and on to New York before heading back
to Russia on Wednesday evening, to reassure American businessmen
that as president he would welcome foreign investment and continue
the democratic process.
<p>
   ``I want to build a free, democratic Russia,'' said Lebed on
Tuesday afternoon in his remarks to the United Nations
Correspondents Association in New York.
<p>
   ``The only thing I kill now are wars,'' he added, describing his
role in brokering peace accords in Chechnya and Moldova.
<p>
   He repeatedly stressed similar themes, saying that the Russian
army should not interfere in politics, that obstacles to foreign
investment should be removed, and that he would not interfere with
NATO expansion into Eastern Europe. ``Russia should take it
calmly,'' he said. ``There should be no hysteria.''

<p>
   But Lebed also insisted that Russia's brand of democracy would
not be transplanted whole from Western soil. Press freedom, he
said, would not extend to the publishing of personal affronts to
national leaders. And free enterprise would not necessarily include
the privatization of the energy, telecommunications and
transportation industries.
<p>
   He left a strong impression on his audience. A bear of a man,
with a craggy face and piercing blue eyes, he sat in a wood-paneled
dining room at the Harvard Club on Wednesday in a charcoal-gray
suit, his big, restless hands alternately tapping the table and
pounding it for emphasis.
<p>
   But even for those who met him, he remained something of an
enigma, especially since he was careful to avoid offering specific
details about how he might manage economic and political change.
<p>
   In one meeting, he declared that he would appoint a panel of
experts aged 30 to 45 to redesign Russia's economic policies,
suggesting that anyone older had been psychologically ruined by the
Soviet experience.
<p>
   ``While he seems to be aware of the difficulties that investors
face,'' said Jack Wirts, the executive vice president of the
Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization in New
York, ``I don't think he enunciated any different directions that
his government might take.''
<p>
   Still, many of the business people seemed encouraged. A
spokeswoman for John A. Krol, president and chief executive officer
of Du Pont, and Jerry A. Blumberg, Du Pont's executive vice
president, said their hour-long conference with Lebed in Delaware
on Tuesday morning offered a valuable window into the investment
climate in Russia.
<p>
   ``Russia is a key growth market for Du Pont,'' said Kathy Forte,
a spokeswoman for the company.
<p>
   And Trump, who gave the retired general a crystal apple as a
parting gift, said Lebed had ``a lot of wonderful ideas,'' though
he declined to discuss them.
<p>
   ``He invited me to Russia and I accepted,'' Trump said. ``I
thought he was terrific.''
<p>
   For his part, Lebed seemed slightly overwhelmed by New York
City's technology and architecture. During his visit to Trump
Tower, Trump's steel-and-glass palace on Fifth Avenue, he marveled
at the computers on the desks and the automatic lock on the doors.
``Very impressive,'' he said.
<p>
   And he found the city's skyscrapers a bit unnerving.
<p>
   ``It's hard to get used to the huge towering structures,'' he
said.
<p>
   Still, Lebed said the visit had served its purpose.
<p>
   ``I extended the circle of my friends,'' he said, describing the
objectives achieved during his trip. ``We made clearer the routes
and framework for future cooperation. I've received new guarantees
that if I meet certain conditions as president, investments will go
to Russia. If the conditions are civilized, the investments will be
civilized.''
<p>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The Quotable Lebed
<p>
   Alexander Lebed's reputation for blunt speaking comes in part
from his taste for the folksy aphorisms to illustrate a point, put
down an opponent or tout his own achievements. A few examples from
his visit to New York:
<p>
   On his heroes  &MD;  ``I don't have any heroes. Even the sun has
spots.''
<p>
   On Russia's new rich  &MD;  ``I apply a simple test. When I greet a
group of entrepreneurs, I hail them, `Hello, crooks!' If they take
it OK, then they are not hopeless. If they beat their breasts and
deny it, then they are incorrigible.''
<p>
   On his standing with Chechen rebels after negotiating Russia's
withdrawal  &MD;  ``The Chechens put Allah in first place. In second,
they put me.''
<p>
   On Russia's reaction to NATO's expansion  &MD;  ``If the rape is
unavoidable, relax and try to enjoy it.''
<p>
   On investment in Russia  &MD;  ``He who doesn't take risks, doesn't
drink champagne.''
<p>
   On the Russian government ``They're like a dog guarding a
haystack. They can't eat the hay themselves, but they won't let
anyone else eat it either.''
<p>
   On Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin  &MD;  ``He's so inarticulate
he needs a translator from Russian into Russian.''
<p>
   On answering questions from a roomful of journalists  &MD;  ``The
paratroopers' principle is: fall from the sky, hit the ground and
start fighting.''
<p>
   On Russia's lurch from one government to another  &MD;  ``There's got
to be a time when you stop stepping on the same rake.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  In a wide-ranging indictment, federal authorities
charged Wednesday that top officials of the union that represented
the transit police took kickbacks and engaged in several other
schemes before the force merged with the New York City Police
Department in 1995.
<p>
   The racketeering and bribery indictments were immediately seized
on by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who noted that among those indicted
were the chief negotiator for the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, the union representing the city's 38,000 police
officers.
<p>
   Tuesday, that union rejected the city's last contract offer, a
decision Giuliani said was inextricably linked to legal problems
involving PBA officials and negotiators.
<p>
   While the charges do not implicate PBA officials, they do focus
on a union that merged with the PBA in May 1995, the Transit Police
Benevolent Association, which shared its lawyers with the city
officers' union.
<p>
   Federal prosecutors charged that before the merger, the lawyers
paid bribes to Transit PBA officials to keep the union's work. One
of the lawyers, James J. Lysaght, has been a top strategist for the
PBA in the current contract talks.
<p>
   ``There's no question that today's indictments have had a very
difficult effect on the ability of the city to communicate its
message to the police officers of New York City,'' Giuliani said in
commenting on the indictments.
<p>
   Union officials declined to respond to the mayor's assertion,
but Giuliani's comments underscored the deep rift that has grown
between many police officers and the mayor, who plans to make the
city's record-setting drop in crime a central theme of his
re-election campaign.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   This year, the mayor will be in the uncomfortable position of
running on his record as a crime fighter while having frayed
relations with the police union and its restive members, who
strongly supported his mayoral bid in 1993.
<p>
   In announcing the indictments of 10 people Wednesday, U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White said more charges might follow against some
current and former city PBA board members for their part in a
money-laundering scheme.
<p>
   In that scheme, as outlined in Wednesday's indictment, officials
of several police unions essentially lent money to the campaign of
a former Transit PBA president, Ron Reale, so that he could
fraudulently qualify for city matching funds during his
unsuccessful campaign for public advocate in 1993. Reale was among
those indicted Wednesday.
<p>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lachow said more than 15
questionable donations to Reale's campaign were made by city,
transit and housing PBA officials, their spouses and their friends,
but it is unclear whether they will face criminal charges.
<p>
   But other investigators, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the city PBA was now likely to become the focus of
the inquiry because Lysaght and two other lawyers charged
Wednesday, Peter L. Kramer and Richard Hartman, have also had
multimillion-dollar contracts with the city police union for years.
<p>
   Ms. White would not discuss the possibility of indictments
against current PBA officials, saying only, ``We're going to pursue
this case as far as the evidence will take us.''
<p>
   A spokesman for the law firm of Lysaght &AMP; Kramer, which is paid
more than $5 million in public and union money each year to defend
city police officers, said that the lawyers expected to be cleared.
<p>
   ``We at our law firms have acted tirelessly and aggressively on
behalf of police officers for many years,'' the spokesman, Todd
Shapiro, said, ``and given our aggressive efforts, it's not
surprising that we have made certain enemies, nor that these
enemies would target us for this type of attack.''
<p>
   The investigation began two years ago, when top officials of the
transit police union were accused of looting $265,000 from the
union's coffers in the months before the May 1995 merger with the
city PBA.
<p>
   In November two financial officials of the Transit PBA, union
vice president Thomas Zichettello and treasurer Raymond Montero
were charged with using union funds to buy luxury cars for
themselves and their spouses. Montero began cooperating with
federal agents, said law enforcement officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
<p>
   They added that Montero described how union officials demanded
cash bribes of more than $300,000 from their lawyers and other
vendors.
<p>
   According to the indictment, which was filed by Michele
Hirschman, head of the Federal Attorney's Public Corruption Unit,
Transit PBA officials paid Lysaght &AMP; Kramer inflated fees for
administering the union's health and welfare benefits fund, annuity
fund and civil legal fund, and then demanded cash kickbacks of more
than $300,000.
<p>
   Zichettello and Montero have both been indicted, and they
pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy and racketeering, Ms. White
said.
<p>
   Transit PBA officials are also charged with demanding similar
kickbacks from the law firm of Barry Agulnick and William Gogel,
two other lawyers who represented transit officers. The two were
also indicted on racketeering charges and Wednesday pleaded guilty.
<p>
   Agulnick and Gogel have also signed co-operation agreements with
federal investigators, according to law enforcement officials who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The most tantalizing aspects of Wednesday's indictment were the
charges filed against Richard Hartman, a former PBA lawyer who is
one of the most storied figures in local labor politics.
<p>
   Hartman was forced to resign as the lead PBA lawyer in 1988 and
forfeit his law license after he was caught taking $817,000 from
union escrow accounts to support his compulsive gambling habit.

<p>
   During a grand jury proceeding by the Manhattan district
attorney's office in 1988, prosecutors also presented evidence that
Hartman was involved in a kickback scheme and associated with
organized crime figures, according to a letter Armstrong later
filed in court.
<p>
   When Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau agreed to
drop the charges against Hartman in exchange for his forfeiting his
law license, city PBA officials quickly granted him a $2 million
contract as a labor consultant and allowed him to act as the agent
for the members' life insurance plan  &MD;  which generated an
additional $2 million in commissions.
<p>
   Hartman's current lawyer, Stuart London, said his client denied
any wrongdoing. But federal agents charged him Wednesday with
paying a series of bribes to transit police union officials, who
allowed him to act as the life insurance agent for that union's
members.
<p>
   The PBA board met Wednesday, but it was unclear whether the
members made any decision about the law firm's status as the
union's firm. Joseph Mancini, a union spokesman, said that none of
the criminal charges against the lawyers involved its dealings with
the city PBA. ``They have always been professional in their
relations with us,'' he said.
<p>
   The city PBA is a lobbying powerhouse in Albany and has
succeeded in passing several bills through the Legislature despite
Giuliani's determined opposition. Last year, it helped win passage
of a bill that would give a state arbitrator greater powers to
settle the union's grievances and pay disputes with the city.
<p>
   The bill was struck down in court.

 &UR; 1988 IS STILL A FINE YEAR FOR LYLE &QL;  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN DAVIS &QL;  &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 The Arizona Republic &LR;  &QC;

<p>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - When it comes to choosing a bottle of wine,
Sandy Lyle always starts with the year. The selection is an easy
one.
<p>
   First, last and always he picks 1988.
<p>
   ``If I look at the wine list and see '88, I say, `Yes, I'm
familiar with that one,' '' Lyle said Wednesday before his practice
round at the Phoenix Open.
<p>
   To the wine expert, 1988 may not be a prime year. But to the
golf expert, it was vintage Sandy Lyle.
<p>
   That was the year he burst onto the U.S. golf scene, first by
winning the Phoenix Open, then the Greater Greensboro Open,
followed by his only major championship, in The Masters.
<p>
   What even the experts may not realize, however, is that Lyle
hasn't won a PGA event or a major European event since that banner
year. In fact, Lyle hasn't won a tournament anywhere since 1992.
<p>
   ``Just to win again would be nice,'' Lyle said. ``It wouldn't
matter to me if it was a Pro-Am. It would just be nice to be up
there again making a winning speech.''
<p>
   The Scottish golfer wound up seventh on the 1988 PGA money list
with career-high earnings of $726,934. He also won the British
Masters and World Match Play championship.
<p>
   But he played only two more full seasons on the PGA Tour,
instead turning his attention to European events. Disappointed with
the results, and with only two years left on his U.S. exemption,
Lyle now has turned his focus back to the PGA Tour.
<p>
   ``There are two reasons really,'' Lyle said. ``One was to
simplify the travel for my family. The other is to try to get back
to where I was, to get my world ranking back up.''
<p>
   Lyle has fallen to 180th in the Sony World Rankings and hasn't
played in a Ryder Cup or World Cup since 1987.
<p>
   His biggest disappointment has been at the site of his greatest
triumph, The Masters. After winning, he celebrated by adding a
Scottish dish called ``haggis'' to the Champions Dinner menu. For
the unfamiliar, it's a mixture of lungs and heart, mixed with suet,
seasoning and oatmeal and boiled in the stomach of a sheep or cow.
<p>
   But returning to Augusta National has left Lyle with a bad case
of indigestion. He has missed the cut in five of his eight visits
since his victory, with his best finish being a tie for 21st in
1993.
<p>
   ``It's been agonizing ever since I won there,'' he said. ``The
course sets up so well for me, and I feel so comfortable on it. One
thing I'd really like to do, besides winning a tournament, is go
back there and play well.''
<p>
   Lyle, who played in 15 U.S. events last year, said about 90
percent of this golf season will be spent in the United States,
with a handful of majors, such as the British Open and British
Masters, overseas.
<p>
   His 1996 season fell short of his hopes. He finished 168th on
the money list with $94,490, but Lyle saw some reason for optimism.
<p>
   ``I put some new ideas and thought patterns into my game around
the middle of the year and started to feel more comfortable,'' he
said.
<p>
   The biggest change was that he went back to playing a soft
left-to-right fade shot that was so successful in the mid-1980s.
<p>
   Whether that translates into more victories remains to be seen,
but the Phoenix Open may be a good place to start.
<p>
   After all, it launched that banner 1988 season when he went into
the final round at the TPC of Scottsdale trailing Davis Love III by
7 shots. Lyle shot 65 to finish in a tie with Fred Couples and won
on the third playoff hole.
<p>
   Out of his 15 U.S. events last year, his best finish came in the
Phoenix Open, when he tied for 10th, shooting 67 and 66 the last
two days.
<p>
   ``I wouldn't mind that at all, to start out the year by winning
again here,'' Lyle said. ``It would certainly pick my up my
confidence.''
<p>
   It also would call for a plate of haggis. Maybe with a new
vintage of wine .

   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - Security surrounding Tiger Woods was stepped
up significantly for Wednesday's Xerox Silver Pro-Am, and it will
stay tight throughout the rest of Phoenix Open week, according to
the Thunderbirds.
<p>
   The move was necessitated after Tuesday's breakdown, when a
large group of fans seeking autographs nearly attacked Woods on his
way from the 18th green to the clubhouse. One fan poked Woods, 21,
beneath his eye with a program. At the time, only one Scottsdale
police officer was protecting the phenom.
<p>
   On Wednesday, four or five Scottsdale police officers and
several Thunderbirds escorted Woods around the course. In addition,
volunteers were used to cordon off a 6-foot walkway for Woods
between each hole.
<p>
   Greg Mast, the tournament chairman for the Thunderbirds,
downplayed the move, adding that security measures were being taken
for three or four other high-profile groups this week. None,
however, got the restraining-rope treatment that Woods received
Wednesday.
<p>
   ``We're just trying to help him out,'' Mast said. ``The fans
mean well. They want to touch him and tell him, `Way to go, Tiger.'
But sometimes, it gets a little zealous, and he's definitely had
some trouble getting from the clubhouse to the course and back
again.
<p>
   ``We certainly don't want Tiger to get bogged down, and the fans
need to realize that he's not going to able to accommodate all the
requests he's getting for autographs.''
<p>
   The PGA Tour's autograph policy kicks in today, meaning fans can
expect to get a player's autograph only after he completes his
round.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  It may be a political truism here that money buys
influence and votes on Capitol Hill. But a research group sought to
prove the point on Wednesday in a study of votes and campaign
contributions in the last Congress: in analyzing 14 heavily lobbied
issues, the group found that corporations that poured money into
Congress typically got the votes they wanted.
<p>
   ``It might be an obvious fact that there's a connection between
money and votes,'' said Nancy Watzman, a project director at the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group that
issued the study. ``But until we began to analyze votes, we began
to see how this relationship works out. This money is going for
very practical business reasons, not because of lofty grand ideals.
You need money to play and be heard.''
<p>
   For instance, the sugar industry poured money into the campaigns
of 61 senators and 217 House members who voted to maintain a
sugar-price subsidy that consumer groups say adds an extra 50 cents
to a five-pound bag of sugar.
<p>
   The study found that the 61 senators who voted with the industry
received an average of $13,473 in sugar industry political action
committee donations from 1991 to 1996, while the 35 senators who
voted against the industry received an average of $1,461.
<p>
   The study found that the 217 House members who voted with the
sugar industry from 1991 to 1996 received an average contribution
of $5,994; the 208 who voted against the industry got an average of
$853 in contributions over the same period.
<p>
   ``The sugar lobby proved invincible, surviving numerous attempts
to eliminate the federal subsidy program,'' the report said.
``Sugar clout was also strong enough to defeat proposals to charge
the industry to clean up the Everglades.''
<p>
   The same held true for a group as diverse as peanut growers,
Glaxo Wellcome pharmaceuticals, the Northrop Grumman Corp. and
other military contractors, oil and gas companies, cattlemen,
miners, doctors, the timber industry, the tobacco industry and
assault weapons manufacturers.
<p>
   The timber industry was able to persuade the 104th Congress to
allow logging of dead and dying trees on public lands through the
year, over the objections of environmental groups, and were
successful in getting several measures passed that made it more
difficult for environmental groups to attack the timber industry.
<p>
   The 54 senators who supported the timber industry received an
average of $19,503 in contributions; the 42 who opposed them
received an average of $2,675 from timber companies. In the House,
the 211 members who supported the industry on a major vote received
average contributions of $2,415; the 209 members who voted against
got an average of $542.
<p>
   In the 104th Congress, the mining industry was successful in
retaining the ability to extract minerals on federal lands, while
paying the government what consumer groups say is the bargain price
of $5 an acre or less.
<p>
   Senators voting with the industry received an average of
$17,962; those who voted against got average contributions of
$4,269.
<p>
   The military industry also wrote big checks to members of
Congress. For instance, the 213 members of Congress who voted to
spend an additional $493 million on Northrop Grumman's B-2 stealth
bombers received an average of $2,100 from the contractor; the 210
who voted against, got an average of $100 each.
<p>
   ``What we are saying is that people should look at these
numbers,'' Ms. Watzman said. ``The B-2 bomber is a perfect example.
It's not a Democratic or a Republican issue, yet there is a pretty
obvious pattern on where all the money comes from and who gets
it.''
<p>
   Glaxo Wellcome, a British pharmaceutical company, fought off
efforts in the 104th Congress to close a loophole that allowed the
company to sell its Zantac anti-ulcer medication in the United
States for an additional 19 months before any competitor could make
a generic version.
<p>
   Glaxo gave the 53 senators who voted with it an average of
$5,470 in contributions; those 45 voting against it received
$1,447.
<p>
   By contrast, Ciba-Geigy, a U.S. pharmaceutical company that had
been seeking to offer a generic version of Zantac, spent far less
and lost. Moreover Ciba-Geigy spent more money on Congressmen who
voted against it than on those who supported it: It gave $902 to
the 53 senators who voted against Ciba-Geigy and in favor of Glaxo;
it gave an average of $578 to the 45 Senators who voted in
Ciba-Geigy's favor.

    &UR; BUSH TO PROPOSE SWEEPING BUSINESS TAX
<p>
    &UR; By MICHELE KAY &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   AUSTIN, Texas  &MD;  Gov. George W. Bush's sweeping business tax
proposal in his state-of-the-state address Tuesday will target a
new class of Texas taxpayers  &MD;  among them, thousands of lawyers,
accountants, doctors and even lobbyists.
<p>
   ``It's going to be one of the biggest, most interesting fights
we have had in the Legislature since 1950,'' said Austin lobbyist
George Christian.
<p>
   The business-activity tax  &MD;  expected to be at the core of Bush's
proposal to cut the state's reliance on property taxes to pay for
public schools  &MD;  would replace Texas' franchise tax that only
corporations now pay.
<p>
   Bush wants to expand that base to include any business in Texas
that earns more than $500,000.
<p>
   ``It's going to be the first time legislators hear a sitting
governor say the tax base should be expanded to include all
businesses,'' said Bill Allaway, president of the Texas Taxpayers
and Research Association.
<p>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, said the governor
believes the tax burden should be shared more evenly.
<p>
   ``We don't believe the current system is fair,'' Hughes said.
``We tax some businesses too much and others not at all.''
<p>
   In order to protect small enterprises, Bush's budget writers
have proposed the $500,000 deduction. As a result, the number of
businesses that pay tax would drop  &MD;  from about 150,000 to 111,000.
But those that pay would have to dig deeper for Bush's proposal to
raise $1.5 billion a year more than Texas now collects with its
franchise tax.
<p>
   The so-called business-activity tax would newly tax professional
firms, some retailers and fast-food franchisees, oil and gas and
real estate partnerships, among others.
<p>
   ``When you suggest bringing in new taxpayers, you're asking for
trouble,'' Christian said. ``The last time that idea came up was in
1991 and it didn't happen. The Senate opposed it and it was
obliterated in the House.''
<p>
   Among businesses now exempt from the franchise tax that would
pay a business activity tax are sports teams, including the Texas
Rangers. Bush is a part-owner of the team.
<p>
   Lobbyists say Bush would not exclude partnerships such as the
Rangers so no one would be able to accuse him of orchestrating a
better deal for himself and his business partners.
<p>
   Bush has said repeatedly since last summer that he wants to
reduce the school taxes paid by residential and commercial property
owners and increase the money the state contributes to public
schools. Bush campaigned two years ago on promises to raise the
state's share of financing schools to 60 percent from 47 percent.
<p>
   The governor has said he hopes his tax plan would bring the
state close to that goal.
<p>
   But he has not been specific. In addition to revealing his tax
plan Tuesday, Bush will submit a budget the next day with
additional details.
<p>
   ``He wants to have his own budget to show there is money in
there for the first $1 billion of the property tax break,'' said
state Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, House Ways and Means Committee
chairman. ``If people say there is no money, he can point to it and
show where he found it.''
<p>
   Bush is expected to suggest cutting school taxes by $3 billion a
year. Property owners now pay close to $10 billion a year.
<p>
   His plan includes raising the homestead exemption to $25,000
from $5,000. Bush's budget writers also have proposed expanding and
increasing the sales tax to collect $900 million more a year. Bush
has said he wants to cut state spending by $1 billion over the next
two years.
<p>
   Lobbyists predict legislators will try to avoid voting on a tax
bill. More likely, they say, legislators would send to voters a
constitutional amendment that would change the tax system.
<p>
   ``The tax plan is going to have to be a dialogue between the
voters of Texas and the governor of Texas,'' said Bill Messer, an
Austin lobbyist. ``It's not going to be driven by lobbyists or
legislators here in Austin.''
<p>
   Legislators and lobbyists believe the verdict on Bush's plan
will be swift.
<p>
   ``It is all going to hinge on people's initial reactions,''
Messer said. ``The issue is either going to be declared dead on
arrival or it's going to move so fast, no one can stop it.''
<p>
   If it survives, Craddick said, Bush may have to call a special
session because the complicated tax issue promises to be too
time-consuming for the regular session.
<p>
   ``Several members have said the question is important enough for
a special session,'' Craddick said.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Whenever Craig Newsome drives by someone doing
masonry work, he can't help but smile and remember the time when he
felt like his life had hit a block wall.
<p>
   He wasn't much interested in football coming out of high school
in Rialto, Calif., and as a new father, he needed a job. So Newsome
worked as a mason for two years, building block walls.
<p>
   Sunday, he will be the starting left cornerback for the Green
Packers in Super Bowl XXXI. It is a magical story straight out of
some corny sports book for kids, and every time Newsome sees
someone putting mortar to brick, he is reminded of how far he's
come.
<p>
   ``I'm like, `Oh, man, I used to do that,' '' Newsome said. ``I
would hope I would never have to do that again.''
<p>
   That wish is what drives Newsome, who played two seasons at
Arizona State and was a first-round pick by the Packers in 1995.
Ask anyone connected with the Packers about Newsome, and all their
answers invariably contain some reference to his work ethic.
<p>
   ``He learned on the run,'' said Packers defensive coordinator
Fritz Shurmur, who made Newsome a starter from the first day of his
first training camp. ``It wasn't easy for him. People picked on
him. People made some plays over the top of him. But . . . he
practices as hard as anybody I've ever been around. He competes on
every down, and every day he comes off the field a better player
because of it.''
<p>
   That's what Newsome learned laying bricks. You show up on time
every day. Turn in a solid day's work and then you go home. ``I
learned that nothing is free,'' Newsome said.
<p>
   But the biggest thing he learned from building walls is that he
didn't want to spend his life doing it. So he walked on at San
Bernardino (Calif.) Valley Community College, and by the end of his
second year he was one of the most highly recruited junior-college
players in the country.
<p>
   When he entered college, Newsome wanted nothing more out of it
than to find a way to improve life for his family. But when several
major colleges started recruiting him during his sophomore season,
he began to think professional football was a possibility.
<p>
   He signed with ASU, where despite injuries and academic problems
over two seasons, he played well enough to impress pro scouts.
<p>
   ``We really liked his toughness and overall awareness,'' said
Ron Wolf, the Packers general manager. ``Those things have helped
him immeasurably. He's an incredibly tough human being.''
<p>
   Newsome had to be tough to survive his rookie season. He was
penalized several times for holding and interference, and he played
a part in 13 of the 27 passing touchdowns the Packers allowed in
1995.
<p>
   He has made great strides this season. He hasn't been called for
pass interference yet and has given up just three touchdowns.
<p>
   Packers coaches attribute his improvement to having an
additional year of maturity. Newsome, already with the reputation
as one of the most physical corners in the league, has learned what
he can get away with.
<p>
   ``Craig is in your face,'' said safety Eugene Robinson. ``He's
not afraid to challenge you. He will bust you in the mouth,
legally. He gets up in your face and chokes you.''
<p>
   Newsome usually leaves it up to his teammates to speak for him.
He is a shy, private person who goes to great extremes to avoid the
media. He is notorious for showering quickly after practice and
games, leaving before the media enters the locker room. He has been
known to walk out of the shower just as Coach Mike Holmgren begins
his post-game speech. ``A couple of times I've been in there and I
come out with soap in my hair and he (Holmgren) is like, `Craig,
what are you doing?' '' Newsome said. ``I just like to go out there
and play, and when it's over with, I go home and spend time with my
kids.''

    &UR; NEW VISION FOR CITADEL
<p>
    &UR; By LYN RIDDLE &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   CHARLESTON, S.C.  &MD;  Despite the charges of hazing and abuse
leveled at The Citadel by two of the four women who broke the
gender barrier there, John Grinalds believes establishing a
coeducation program will not be his greatest challenge when he
takes over as president this summer.
<p>
   ``The greatest challenge is to articulate the mission of The
Citadel in terms that make sense to young people and their parents;
to show this is a wonderful laboratory to develop leadership
skills,'' he said in a recent interview. ``Coeducation is going to
go well.''
<p>
   Grinalds, 59, is the headmaster at Woodberry Forest School in
Woodberry Forest, Va. He passed up a promotion to three-star
general in the Marine Corps six years ago to lead the private
preparatory school, which has an enrollment of 368 boys, ages 14 to
18. Two of his sons attended the school near Charlottesville.
<p>
   He said he was asked to apply for the president's job at The
Citadel last May, but did not agree to be considered until
December. He was chosen from a pool of more than 100 applicants.
<p>
   As a boy, Grinalds lived in New York, Alabama and Macon, Ga.,
where he met his wife of nearly 25 years, Norwood. The couple met
when they were 13.
<p>
   ``John likes to say he told me immediately after we met he was
going to marry me, but it took nine years to get around my
mother,'' Mrs. Grinalds said, chuckling. They have four children,
including a daughter, Kate Grinalds, who works for the Alliance
Theater in Atlanta. Mrs. Grinalds' brother, Brown Dennis, is an
Atlanta doctor.
<p>
   Grinalds graduated from West Point in 1959, the first-year
graduates were allowed to become commissioned officers in a service
other than the Army. He chose the Marines and spent a 32-year
career commanding troops in Vietnam and at Marine bases around the
world. In addition, he served as an adviser to the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and was a Rhodes Scholar.
<p>
   When he left the service, he was the commanding general of the
Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, where 23,000 Marines are
trained each year. It may seem a huge leap from Marine Corps
general to headmaster of a school that sends 15 percent of its
graduates to an Ivy League school, but to Grinalds it seemed a
natural progression.
<p>
   ``Much of what I had done was leading young men, and that is
where I had always found my greatest satisfaction,'' he said.
<p>
   Woodberry students describe him as approachable, yet firm.
Before the young men arrive each fall, he learns each one's name
and makes a special point of praising accomplishments. He does not
tolerate dishonesty or discrimination, students said.
<p>
   ``He is an extraordinary leader,'' said Trish Zetterberg, a
longtime friend in Augusta whose two sons graduated from The
Citadel. ``What he requires of everyone else, he requires of
himself.''
<p>
   Zetterberg said she believes Grinalds will bring harmony to the
college.
<p>
   The Citadel has been embroiled in conflict ever since Shannon
Faulkner was admitted under a federal court order three years ago.
<p>
   The school changed its policy last summer after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that the all-male admissions policy at the publicly
supported Virginia Military Institute was unconstitutional. Four
women enrolled in August, and a week ago two of them decided not to
return for a second semester, saying they had been abused and
sexually harassed. Kim Messer and Jeanie Mentavlos have reported to
authorities that they were kissed and groped and that male cadets
set their clothes on fire.
<p>
   Eleven cadets have been charged by school officials in the
reported incidents.
<p>
   Grinalds said one of the requests he made when he came to
Charleston for an interview was to meet with the female cadets. He
met with Petra Lovetinska and Nancy Mace, the two women who are not
involved in the dispute. He said he found them ``upbeat and
enthusiastic.''
<p>
   ``I wanted to get the feel of the school and find out what the
situation was,'' he said. ``I expected to find a siege mentality,
but I didn't find that at all.''
<p>
   He also said the cadet leadership was respectful of Lovetinska
and Mace but ``didn't have much to say about the others.''
<p>
   ``The women said don't move too quickly, don't just take
anybody, to look for people who know what they're getting into and
who are coming for the right reasons,'' Grinalds said.
<p>
   He said he is leaving Woodberry, situated on a pristine 1,500-
acre tract in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to find new
challenges.
<p>
   He plans to arrive on campus in midsummer and, like the military
man he is, make a reconnaissance. Then he will develop an agenda
for action, moving the tradition-rich institution into the 21st
century.

<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Rookie linebacker Tedy Bruschi has followed the
instructions New England Patriots Coach Bill Parcells gave him on
surviving Super Bowl week in New Orleans.
<p>
   Rule No. 1 was to keep his hands on his wallet.
<p>
   Parcells also told him where to go and not to go as the team
prepares for Sunday's game against the NFC-champion Green Bay
Packers in Super Bowl XXXI.
<p>
   ``He gave us do's and don'ts about the town,'' Bruschi said.
``He said to stay away from certain places  &MD;  the casinos, public
parks, cemeteries. I don't know why I would want to go to a
cemetery.
<p>
   ``He said it's a town where a lot of bad things happen. I
believe him. I believe whatever he says. I'd run through two brick
walls for him.''
<p>
   Bruschi, the third-round draft pick from Arizona, is Parcells'
kind of guy. It doesn't matter that he's barely 6 feet. It didn't
keep him from tying an NCAA Division I-A career sack record of 52,
and that was as a defensive lineman. Parcells drafted him as a
middle linebacker, a position Bruschi never had played.
<p>
   But after three days at that spot, Parcells moved Bruschi to
outside linebacker, and he has been there ever since, except in
certain nickel situations.
<p>
   In the AFC title game 11 days ago, Bruschi intercepted
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell once, broke up another pass
and shadowed him the entire game.
<p>
   ``I don't have very good hearing,'' Bruschi said. ``So I didn't
care what people (doubters) said about me. I don't look to prove
people wrong. But there always have been some questions about me. I
heard the same thing about whether I could play defensive end in
college. Look at me.''
<p>
   Bruschi, 6-0, 245 pounds, said many NFL scouts wondered, ``Can
the guy go backwards? All through college, he was going forward.''
<p>
   That's because he was an attacking defensive end at UA. He never
was used in pass coverage.
<p>
   His role with New England is more diversified. And he has picked
it up quickly.
<p>
   ``He's so fast and aggressive,'' said Patriots defensive end
Mike Jones, formerly with the Cardinals. ``He gives (offensive
linemen) so much trouble with his speed. He's so versatile. He's a
headhunter on special teams. He just makes plays.''
<p>
   Through it all, Bruschi has been able to escape Parcells' wrath.
The coach can be brutal in practice on young players.
<p>
   ``Coach Parcells wants things done right,'' Bruschi said. ``It
took me awhile to realize what exactly he wants. There was a lot
of, `Bruschi, what the heck are you doing?' You have to realize he
wants to win. Coach Parcells' way is the winning way.''
<p>
   Bruschi, pronounced Brew-ski, also has become a fan favorite in
Green Bay because of his last name. The Cheeseheads like their
brews and bratwurst. Bruschi appreciates their support.
<p>
   ``Hey, Green Bay, thanks a lot,'' he said. ``Have a drink on
me.''

to the University of Texas law school file suit against UT,
alleging reverse discrimination.
<p>
   April 1993  &MD;  UT changes its law school admission policy,

    &UR; PATS' BLEDSOE FACES JUDGMENT DAY
<p>
    &UR; By LEN PASQUARELLI &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  At least three times a week for four months during
the off season, he practiced the tedious exercise designed to prove
that a quarterback's arm will carry him only as far as his feet
will allow.
<p>
   New England assistant coach Chris Palmer carefully positioned
the big red dots on the grass. And quarterback Drew Bledsoe
simulated his drop-back by trying to step on the dots, like someone
at an Arthur Murray dance studio hoping to transform from awkward
to Astaire.
<p>
   ``After doing it a couple thousand times,'' Palmer recalled
Wednesday, ``he became a great dancer.''
<p>
   Should Bledsoe waltz through Super Bowl XXXI on Sunday evening,
he might even be hailed as a great quarterback. But doubts about
the Patriots passer, a four-year NFL veteran at the tender age of
24, are beginning to overshadow the week's biggest story, an
ongoing spitting match between New England owner Bob Kraft and
coach Bill Parcells.
<p>
   Even in the New England camp, and reportedly as high up in the
organization as Parcells, the suspicion is that the quarterback
with the league's biggest contract isn't ready for the biggest
game. Privately, teammates fear Bledsoe could single-handedly
negate Parcells' meticulous game plan.
<p>
   ``There are a lot of reasons (the Patriots) are underdogs
here,'' said Fox analyst Terry Bradshaw, alluding to a 14 1/2-point
spread that makes New
<p>
   England the third-biggest underdog in Super Bowl history. ``And
one of them is the perception that Drew comes into this game
struggling.''
<p>
   The statistics bolster the perceptions: Over the last four
games, including a pair of playoff victories, Bledsoe has thrown
three touchdown passes and eight interceptions. His passer rating
in that stretch is a puny 58.6.
<p>
   Even in the 28-3 rout of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Pats'
opening playoff game, Bledsoe was scatter-shot. He followed up a
red-hot start, when he hit his first seven passes for 123 yards, by
completing only seven of 17 attempts for 41 yards over the final
three quarters. In the AFC championship game against Jacksonville,
he never appeared comfortable and several times threw off his back
foot when the Jaguars brought pressure up the middle.
<p>
   Conversely, the first overall selection in the 1993 draft threw
for 25 touchdowns and suffered only 10 interceptions in the first
14 games of the season.
<p>
   Bledsoe, who had a a stellar college career at Washington State,
isn't buying into the theory that the bigger the game the larger
the lump in his throat, but he is aware his detractors feel that's
the case.
<p>
   ``The last month or so, everything has been under the magnifying
glass, . . . and this week it goes under the microscope, so the
pressure is intensified,'' Bledsoe said Wednesday. ``In the big
picture, this isn't a make-or-break game for my career, but it
certainly would dispel some notions if I play well. Or, should I
say, when I play well.''
<p>
   Just when Bledsoe will play well again has become an intriguing
subplot to the Parcells saga. In one of his most frequently used
allegories, Parcells refers to a trapper only being as good as the
number of pelts he brings back from the hunt. ``And Drew is
starting to get some skins,'' Parcells said.
<p>
   In truth, however, Bledsoe and Parcells get under each other's
skins. The quarterback, who conceded earlier in the week that he
``really has no personal (relationship)'' with Parcells, won't shed
many tears if his coach heads off to the New York Jets after
Sunday's game.
<p>
   Said Bledsoe: ``Whatever happens, happens. That's how I feel.''
<p>
   Whatever happens Sunday evening, though, against a Green Bay
defense primed to come after Bledsoe often and early, could
catapult him into the elite grouping of NFL quarterbacks or leave
him stalled in the second tier.
<p>
   During the long off-season tutorials, Palmer, upset that the
6-foot-5 Bledsoe had a league-high 31 attempts knocked down at the
line of scrimmage in '95, set up stepladders as mock pass-rushers.
Reminded of that drill, the quarterbacks coach agreed it has new
symbolism.
<p>
   ``This game,'' Palmer said, ``is the time for Drew to take the
next step up.''

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  An emotionally disturbed man sped past the security
checkpoints at the CIA headquarters last month in a pickup truck
that came to rest on the building's front steps, the agency said
Wednesday.
<p>
   The driver, David Crump, 37, was arrested by CIA guards
immediately after the incident, which occurred about 8 p.m. Dec. 23
at the agency's complex in McLean, Va., said Mark Mansfield, a CIA
spokesman.
<p>
   ``It was a breach of physical security,'' Mansfield said of the
episode, which was first reported by CNN Radio. ``It points to the
importance of remaining vigilant.''
<p>
   Mansfield said Crump, who is from McLean, had no criminal record
and no known affiliation with terrorist groups. The CIA spokesman
would give only the barest details of the case, but a federal court
complaint filed in the Eastern District of Virginia accuses Crump
of threatening the life of President Clinton.
<p>
   When asked how an intruder made it to the front steps of an
organization that does not put out a welcome mat, Mansfield said
the truck was traveling at ``extremely high speed,'' so fast that
guards could not activate pop-up metal barriers. He said the CIA
had taken ``significant additional measures'' to prevent a
recurrence.
<p>
   Crump was sent to a federal prison in North Carolina for
psychiatric tests to determine his fitness to stand trial.

    &UR; THIS TIME, NO MEDIA CIRCUS FOR MCMAHON
<p>
    &UR; By JEFF SCHULTZ &QC; 
<p>
    &UR; c.1997 Cox News Service &LR;  &QC; 
<p>
   NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Eleven years ago this morning, the phone rang in
Jim McMahon's hotel room. It was a death threat. McMahon didn't
think much of it. He got up, showered, dressed and went downstairs
for breakfast.
<p>
   ``I'm sitting there eating breakfast and (former Chicago general
manager) Jerry Vainisi comes up to me and says, `You really did it
this time, didn't you?' '' McMahon recalled Wednesday. ``I said,
`Did what?' Then (coach Mike) Ditka comes up to me and says, `What
did you say that for?' I said, `What are you talking about?' ''
<p>
   Sunday's Super Bowl will be McMahon's second. The first came in
January of 1986, when he was the starting quarterback for Chicago
in a 46-10 flattening of New England. This time, McMahon mainly
will be watching Brett Favre as the Green Bay Packers face the
Patriots.
<p>
   A lot is different about this week for McMahon. He is near the
end of his career instead of at the peak. Also, no one has
threatened to shoot him.
<p>
   ``The week's not over, yet,'' he said.
<p>
   The Bears' last title is remembered as much for McMahon's antics
(and inaccurately reported antics) as Buddy Ryan's 46 defense and
William Perry's touchdown run. In chronological order, McMahon:
<p>
   EmLeader Wore headbands with anti-NFL messages written on them.
Pete Rozelle, the late commissioner had fined him $5,000 for
wearing an Adidas product, which was in conflict with the league's
marketing deals.
<p>
   EmLeader Mooned a television station's helicopter as it flew
over the Bears' practice field. ``They wanted to see my sore
(rear), so I showed it to them,'' said McMahon, who had been
injected with pain-killers for a sore hip.
<p>
   EmLeader Didn't say anything. A sportscaster on an NBC affiliate
in New Orleans reported a rumor on its 10 p.m. newscast that
McMahon had called the women in New Orleans ``sluts'' and the men
``stupid'' during an interview with a Chicago radio station that
morning.
<p>
   There were only two problems with the report: McMahon didn't do
the interview and he never said it to anybody else, either. The
sportscaster, Buddy Diliberto, who quoted ``a source,'' was
admonished and sent out of town for the rest of the week.
<p>
   ``Big deal,'' McMahon said. ``He got his job back after the
Super Bowl.''
<p>
   The damage had been done. McMahon's history of being slightly
off-center doused his vehement denials of the report. The death
threats continued. A mob of women carrying picket signs chanted in
front of the Bears' hotel. So much for the NFL's proudest moment.
<p>
   ``I was having a nice time here for about three days,'' McMahon
said. ``Then the (stuff) hit the fan.''
<p>
   The circus didn't affect McMahon or the Bears that Sunday. He
threw for 256 yards and ran for two touchdowns, and Chicago posted
what was the most lopsided Super Bowl win in history.
<p>
   It has been a lower-profile McMahon in recent years. The Packers
are his sixth employer in the last eight seasons, after seven years
in Chicago. He hates mop-up duty but has enjoyed his time in Green
Bay.
<p>
   Packers coach Mike Holmgren said, ``He's been a welcome addition
to this team. He does a lot of things to keep me calm during the
game. I tell him, `This really is ironic, you keeping me calm.' But
he's a very bright guy. It's like having the good angel and the bad
angel on your shoulders. I've got McMahon on one side and (receiver
Don) Beebe on the other.''
<p>
   McMahon being the bad angel  &MD;  only not as bad as some thought.

   ST. ANTHONY, Idaho  &MD;  For some people, tying flies might seem a
bit moronic, about as much fun as getting glued to a toilet seat.
<p>
   Could sitting on a stool all winter inspire anything creative?
Could winding feathers around a barbed piece of steel be considered
normal? At least if you were glued to a toilet seat, you could have
a selection of good reading material.
<p>
   For Rene Harrop, one of Idaho's top fly-tiers, however, it's not
only a sentimental winter hobby. Nothing inspires him more than the
hope that he will create a killer fly  &MD;  one that no trout could
refuse. Besides, a well-crafted fly is not only a pile of feathers
and yarn. To the aficionado, it's a work of art. For Harrop and
other professional fly-tiers, that art is also a satisfying way to
make a living.
<p>
   Harrop made the jump from a curious boy chasing barnyard
critters for hackle and fur to a fly-tying professional 27 years
ago. He considers a well-tied fly to be a beautiful creation worth
collecting.
<p>
   Of course, Harrop's best flies won't find their way into any
fancy display cases. You would be more likely to find one stuck in
the bankside brush somewhere. He ties exceptional flies for
fishermen around the country, but his best work is set aside for
special occasions.
<p>
   For personal use that is.
<p>
   ``All of the flies we tie are done right,'' Harrop said. ``When
we started tying professionally in 1967, we set a course for
quality. It's either done right or it's done over  &MD;  there's no
other way to survive. But the flies we save are the very best ones
we produce. Those are the ones we keep for ourselves and fish
with.''
<p>
   Dating back at least 300 years, anglers have attempted to
replicate trout food with feathers. And, with tiny hooks, minuscule
feathers, thread, yarn and glue, the crafty fly-tier can create a
striking imitation of an actual insect. A little work of art  &MD; 
often no larger than your smallest fingernail  &MD;  can turn a
skeptical trout into a taker.
<p>
   When fly-tiers fool that first trout with one of their own
creations, they pass a crucial threshold in an intriguingly
complicated sport.
<p>
   ``Without a doubt, catching that first trout on a fly you tied
is a big event in the evolution of a fly-fisherman,'' Harrop said.
``I haven't talked to anyone who hasn't got a rush out of it.''
<p>
   ``To me, the total package of flyfishing involves fly-tying,''
he said. ``I think that the combination of good angling skills and
the insect observations of a fly-tier will produce a much more
effective fisherman on the stream.''
<p>
   ``You have to understand the living creatures that attach you to
trout,'' he said, warming to his subject. ``If you don't try to
understand them, there's no room for growth. There's always
something new to learn. And that is the appeal.''
<p>
   Although it may not have been a concern two centuries ago,
fly-tying also has an economic incentive.
<p>
   With most flies retailing at $2.50 each, tying your own can save
a creel full of money, especially when you lose one fly after
another on a brushy stream during the height of, say, a brown drake
hatch. Once fledgling professionals make that jump, they realize
that selling flies for profit requires all the attributes of any
successful business.
<p>
   ``First of all, you can't make a lot of money at this craft,''
Harrop said, ``but you can make a living. Based on the simple fact
that there is a shortage of flies right now, an individual who
wants to enter the field could make a business out of it.
<p>
   ``It's the basic human-nature limitations that are the obstacle.
You have to have the discipline to get up in the morning, sit at a
vise and enter a zone that allows you to get through hundreds of
flies at a time. Then you have to get up and do it again the next
day.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Hundreds of flies? In Harrop's case, it's thousands and
thousands of flies and a good portion of a life spent behind a
vise, tying an imitation of an insect that most of us would simply
flick off our arms and be thankful it didn't bite. But to the
fly-fisherman, there may be nothing prettier in the world than a
tiny mayfly  &MD;  with perfect wings, translucent colors and an evenly
forked tail.
<p>
   Harrop is one of the mayfly's admirers. He realizes the strange
power of an insect that shaped a man's career, his art and his
life-long passion for the rivers of Idaho.
<p>
   ``I think about mayflies a lot, and they have my gratitude,''
said Harrop, who ties at home with his family. ``We've tied a
variety of patterns for people, but it was the mayfly in size 20 or
smaller that established our niche in the industry. There were
never really enough small patterns, and the delicate mayfly
imitations were our way in.''
<p>
   For anyone who has tried to wrap a mass of material around a
size 20 hook, there's no doubt why a hole existed in the market.
Tiny mayfly patterns are a big problem to tie. Consider how tough
it might be to paint a picture on your fingernail and you will
appreciate the difficulties that Harrop and his family face each
day.
<p>
   ``We work in a small room, close together,'' Harrop said. ``We
listen to music and have good conversation. We don't grind our
brains too hard. It's as satisfying as it's ever been to watch a
little box of flies accumulate and see our hearts in them.''
<p>
   For Rene Harrop and other accomplished fly-tiers, their hobby
and their passion will never be a monotonous winter diversion.
Realizing that their creations might one day draw another living
creature from the depths to the surface, in unequivocal deception,
is the apex of their sport.

 &UR; NYC SEEKS MORE CONTROL IN CONTRACT TO RUN 2 HOSPITALS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  In an effort to wrest more control from the private
medical centers that staff its public hospitals, New York City
officials said Wednesday that they would seek a new partner for the
city's largest medical-care contract  &MD;  a $100 million deal to run
the Queens and Elmhurst Hospital Centers.
<p>
   City officials have been adamant that they would no longer
accept what they described as decades of paying hundreds of
millions of dollars a year to private institutions to run its
hospitals, with little say over who worked there and how well care
was provided.
<p>
   Since October, the city had been negotiating with Mount Sinai
Medical Center, which has long supplied doctors to Queens and
Elmhurst. But that deal fell through early Wednesday, city
officials said, after they failed to persuade the Mount Sinai
center to give the city more control over running the hospital and
to link productivity and quality of care to what the center would
be paid.
<p>
   ``Historically, affiliation contracts have been monopolized by a
few institutions who have routinely received hundreds of millions
of dollars from us with very little oversight,'' said Dr. Luis R.
Marcos, president of Health and Hospitals Corp., the agency that
runs the city's 11 public hospitals. ``Today, we seek partners that
are accountable, productive and loyal to our public hospitals.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Marcos said that while the city had ``a good track record with
Mount Sinai and would have preferred not to break this
relationship,'' he believed that ``for HHC to face the future we
have to have drastic changes in our relationship with our
affiliates, and perhaps Mount Sinai was not ready for such
change.''
<p>
   Dr. John Rowe, president of Mount Sinai, said that he understood
the colliding needs of the city and his hospital but that he was
not prepared to cede control over staff and faculty decisions to
the city. For example, the city wanted the right to remove the
medical director and other doctors if they failed to meet the
hospital's needs.
<p>
   But he said he would carefully study the city's request for a
new partner and might consider submitting a bid. The contract
between the hospitals agency and Mount Sinai expires at the end of
June, but officials on both sides said it might be extended if the
city cannot complete a new deal by then.
<p>
   The failure of the deal for the Elmhurst and Queens Hospital
Centers has serious implications for both the hospitals corporation
and for Mount Sinai, one of the city's pre-eminent medical
institutions.
<p>
   After 30 years of working with Mount Sinai at its Queens
hospitals, the city must now find a new partner to provide care in
a community that is anxious about the city's commitment to
maintaining hospitals there.
<p>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said he would like to turn the two
hospitals and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn over to private
hands, but that plan has been mired in lawsuits and community
opposition.
<p>
   And Mount Sinai, which has used the city's hospitals as its base
in Queens, must find a new location in that borough because, as
inpatient stays decline, hospitals increasingly rely on referrals
for specialty care from far-flung networks of affiliates.
<p>
   In addition, with the growing importance of managed health care,
hospitals need to be able to demonstrate that they have contacts
throughout the city and region to provide care to their members.
<p>
   ``This has a serious impact on our health system,'' Rowe said.
``Queens is a borough of two million people. We need a home there.
And if we don't make a presence via our affiliation contract with
HHC, we will do it with somebody else. It means a reorientation of
Mount Sinai's activities from Elmhurst to another community base,
but that is something we are prepared to do.''
<p>
   He added that the two Queens hospitals had also been important
training sites for Mount Sinai medical students. But he said a deal
that Mount Sinai has to merge its hospital and medical school with
New York University would provide alternative outlets for training.
<p>
   Beyond wanting to control which doctors would work in its
hospitals, the city's public hospital system wanted more control
over patient transfers and referrals so it could keep more
business. Now, affiliates like Mount Sinai often transfer patients
requiring specialty care to its own hospital, regardless of whether
another public hospital could provide adequate care.
<p>
   Community leaders in Queens said that though they felt Mount
Sinai provided excellent care, they supported the hospitals
agency's efforts to make affiliates more accountable.
<p>
   ``We're nervous, we're anxious, we're unsettled,'' said Rory
Lancman, chairman of the Queens Hospital Center Community Advisory
Board. ``But we feel HHC is taking a stand, and we support them.''
<p>
   Last year, the hospitals corporation spent around $505 million
in contracts with private institutions to provide medical care at
its hospitals. HHC officials have had mixed success in persuading
their longtime partners to agree to the new terms they are
demanding in the current round of contract negotiations.
<p>
   This month, Columbia University's College of Physicians and
Surgeons agreed to a new contract with the city to run Harlem
Hospital Center, a deal that linked how much the school was paid
with how well doctors met specific health care goals and that gave
the city more control over who worked in the hospital.
<p>
   That agreement marked the first time that one of the major
academic medical centers had agreed to such productivity and
accountability terms in its contract to run a city hospital. City
officials said then that they hoped the deal would set a precedent
for a string of affiliation contracts that were up for renewal.
<p>
   Before concluding the deal with Columbia, the hospitals
corporation had been unsuccessful in getting the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine to agree to similar terms in a contract to run
the Jacobi Medical Center.
<p>
   The Montefiore Medical Center took over that contract and faces
renewal of its $55 million deal next month. New York University
Medical Center also faces negotiations in its $47.3 million
agreement to run the Bellevue Hospital Center, as well as its $6.4
million contract to run the Gouverneur Skilled Nursing Facility,
Diagnostic and Treatment Center.

   MONTCLAIR, N.J.  &MD;  Firefighters rushing to put out a smoky blaze
Wednesday morning forced open a first-floor bedroom door and found
the bodies of a mother and her three young daughters, all shot to
death, the authorities said.
<p>
   The firefighters, responding to a 911 emergency call shortly
after 7 a.m., had broken through a first-floor window to get inside
the home, at 127 North Fullerton Ave., and then forced open the
door to the bedroom, Police Chief Thomas Russo said.
<p>
   The firefighters saw the three children lying on a mattress on
the floor and assumed they were suffering from smoke inhalation,
Russo said. But as the firefighters approached, they realized the
problem was much worse: two of the children had been tied up, he
said, and all three had been shot in the head.
<p>
   The girls' mother, who had also suffered gunshot wounds to the
head, was found lying near the mattress with a gun on her chest,
Russo said. He said that police had not ruled out the possibility
that Ms. Bennett had killed her children and then herself but that
they were considering the crime to be a quadruple homicide pending
autopsy reports and further investigation. As of last night, the
police said they had no suspects in the case.
<p>
   The victims were identified as Delfrances Bennett, 38, and her
children, Adrienne Cheeks, 9, Kristen Cheeks, 7, and Brittney
Bennett, 5.
<p>
   ``We have no suspects,'' Russo said, adding that the authorities
had not determined the cause of the fire, which had been confined
to a hallway just outside the bedroom where the bodies were found.
<p>
   But another law-enforcement official involved in the case, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the initial evidence pointed
to a murder-suicide. The official said that the bedroom had been
barricaded from the inside, possibly with an old Christmas tree.
<p>
   The official also said that the father of Ms. Bennett's youngest
daughter, who he said lived in Orange, had fallen behind on child
support payments and that investigators had evidence that Ms.
Bennett may have been distressed about that. Investigators had not
uncovered any evidence of domestic violence in the family, the
official said.
<p>
   Russo said that earlier this week, police went to Ms. Bennett's
house in a response to a call. But he would not disclose the nature
of that call.
<p>
   Ms. Bennett had worked as a laboratory technician at Novartis
Pharmaceutical Corp. in East Hanover since October 1995, according
to Harry Rohme, a spokesman for the company. Rohme said her duties
included setting up microscopes and entering data into computers.
<p>
   From 1992 until late last year, Ms. Bennett was also a full-time
student at Montclair State University, said Bob Quarteroni, a
spokesman for the university. He would not say what she had
studied, but several neighbors said she had taken science classes.
<p>
   The three children were all students at Northeast Elementary
School here  &MD;  Adrienne in third grade, Kristen in first grade and
Brittney in kindergarten, the police said. As news of the killings
spread Wednesday morning, the school principal, Terry Trigg-Scales,
went from one classroom to the next, telling all 350 students that
three of their classmates would not be back.
<p>
   Later in the day, school psychologists and nurses also spent
time with the Northeast students, encouraging them to speak about
their memories of the three sisters. One student made a card
inscribed with the words, ``I love you, Adrienne,'' said Andrew
Evangelista, a school counselor. Some asked questions, he said.
Others wept.
<p>
   ``We are all in overdrive, stunned and numb,'' said Dr. William
Librera, the town's superintendent of schools.
<p>
   It was not the first time that children at Northeast Elementary
School had collectively mourned a death, Librera said. Several
years ago, a former principal was killed when a tree fell on her in
the school parking lot, he said.
<p>
   As television crews swarmed to North Fullerton Avenue on
Wednesday morning, residents said the scene was sadly familiar. Two
years ago, a teen-ager who lived in the house next to the Bennetts'
was charged in the shooting of a West Caldwell woman during a
carjacking.
<p>
   Neighbors on Wednesday afternoon described Mrs. Bennett as
soft-spoken and serious, but said that her daughters often played
with other children on the street and were always laughing.
<p>
   ``They were friendly, smiling kids,'' said Maxine Cleare, who
said that she and her son had watched the authorities bring the
children's bodies out of the house. ``I don't know what I'm going
to tell my son.''

 &UR; NYC MAYOR GAINS IN LONG BATTLE ON AIRPORT RENTS &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani won a victory Wednesday in his
long-running battle with the Port Authority over back rent at the
city's two airports when the Federal Aviation Administration partly
reversed an adverse decision it made last fall.
<p>
   In November, the FAA ruled that the mayor had no ground for
seeking at least $220 million of the $500 million that he contends
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owes the city in rent
for Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports, which the
authority operates on land it leases from the city.
<p>
   Private arbitrators are trying to settle the dispute between the
mayor and the authority. And with last fall's ruling, the FAA's
chief counsel, Nicholas G. Garaufis, said the decision was binding
on the arbitrators.
<p>
   Giuliani disagreed. His corporation counsel finally sued the FAA
over the matter last week. Wednesday, Garaufis backtracked.
<p>
   In a letter to the city, Garaufis said the ruling was advisory
and not binding on arbitrators. But he said he was not changing the
content of the decision. And agency officials said that although
arbitrators could now legally ignore the ruling, the FAA would be
entitled to sue if its officials believed that the arbitrators'
final judgment violated federal law.
<p>
   The mayor's corporation counsel, Paul Crotty, said the letter
was a concession, giving a new push to the city's claim against the
authority. But Jeffrey S. Green, the authority's general counsel,
played down the letter, saying the aviation agency had not altered
the thrust of its decision.
<p>
   The FAA's original ruling focused on the link between revenue at
the airports and the annual rent. The authority is supposed to pay
the city a percentage of revenues, so the rent varies with the
airports' fortunes.
<p>
   The mayor asserts that when the authority calculates its
revenues, it should include money that it receives from a $3
surcharge that is levied on all airline tickets.
<p>
   But Garaufis countered in his November opinion that the
surcharge should be excluded from the rent formula because
Congress, which authorized it, intended it to be separate from the
airports' general revenue stream.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Saul B. Marantz, a pioneer in the development of high-fidelity
audio components, died Jan. 16 at Somerset Medical Center in
Somerville, N.J. He was 85 and lived in Bridgewater, N.J.
<p>
   A man of many parts  &MD;  photographer, classical guitarist,
graphics designer, collector of Chinese and Japanese art  &MD;  Marantz
was fascinated by electronics from his boyhood days in Brooklyn,
N.Y. His passion for music led to his first attempts at building
audio components.
<p>
   In the 1950s and '60s, the Marantz name became synonymous with
audio products that were pleasing to look at, easy to use, durable
and sonically first rate.
<p>
   Working with audio engineers like Sidney Smith and Richard
Sequerra, Marantz created a series of vacuum-tube components that
became touchstones for the fledgling hi-fi industry. Several of
those products, like the Model 9 amplifier and the Model 10B tuner,
have become still-working classics that today command as much as
$20,000.
<p>
   With the advent of transistor technology in the early 1960s,
Marantz and his colleagues soon brought forth another benchmark
product, the Model 18 receiver. It was an early, high-quality
example of what a receiver, which combines the preamplifier, power
amplifier and tuner in one box, could be.
<p>
   To younger audio designers, the Marantz name symbolized clarity
of vision and integrity of purpose. When a modern-day audio expert,
Mark Levinson, had completed the design of one of his first
now-famous components, in 1974, he took it to Marantz for an
appraisal.
<p>
   ``What impressed me about Marantz design was its elegant
simplicity, its economy and symmetry,'' recalled Levinson, now the
president of Cello Music and Film Systems, a high-end electronics
company. ``In a sense, Marantz was building classics. The equipment
was so thoroughly engineered that, once a product was finished, few
changes ever were necessary.''
<p>
   After service in the Army during World War II, Marantz and his
wife, Jean Dickey Marantz, settled in Kew Gardens, Queens. One day
in 1945, he decided to rip the radio out of his 1940 Mercury, where
he rarely listened to it, and put it to more practical use in his
house. But that transplant required building additional electronics
to make the radio work indoors. Such was the hook that snared
Marantz for life.
<p>
   Further efforts to refine sound reproduction in his living room
led Marantz to a breakthrough. Piecing together parts and tips he
picked up on his frequent visits to the Harvey Radio store, he
built a high-quality preamplifier he called the ``Consolette.''
<p>
   Word of this musical-sounding new device began to spread across
the emerging hi-fi scene, and Marantz suddenly found himself an
entrepreneur, though on a back-room scale. Then into his business
walked Smith, an engineer captivated by Marantz's sense of the
possibilities of sound reproduction. Their creative partnership
took Marantz Co. to world prominence.
<p>
   The two men's shared perfectionism proved to be the original
company's downfall. In a recent interview, Marantz acknowledged
that the cost of developing perhaps the most celebrated of all
Marantz products, the Model 10B tuner, in which both Smith and
Sequerra played significant roles, fatally overextended the
company's resources.
<p>
   In 1964, Marantz was sold to Superscope Inc. and has since
passed through several hands. The present owner, Philips
Electronics NV, last year reintroduced nearly exact likenesses of
the original products under the name of Marantz Classics.
<p>
   After the sale to Superscope, Marantz stayed as president until
1968 and then retired  &MD;  briefly. In 1972, he co-founded the
Dahlquist Company, a maker of high-quality loudspeakers, serving as
president until his second retirement in 1978. Last year, he helped
to form two new audio businesses, New Lineage Corp. and Eye Q
loudspeakers.
<p>
   Marantz was a member of several professional organizations,
including the Audio Engineering Society. He served as vice
president and member of the board of the Institute of High
Fidelity.
<p>
   He is survived by a daughter, June M. Chamberlain of Bound
Brook, N.J.; a brother, Charles E. Marantz of Costa Mesa, Calif.; a
sister, Edith M. Marksohn of Oyster Bay Cove, N.Y., and three
grandchildren.

<p>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif.  &MD;  O.J. Simpson's attorney, retaliating
after the plaintiffs delivered an emotionally wrenching finale to
their case, Wednesday accused his adversaries of manipulating
evidence to ``sandbag'' the defendant.
<p>
   In an often-combative, sometimes-rambling closing argument,
defense counsel Robert Baker took sharp aim at the tactics and
motives of the plaintiffs' lawyers. At the same time, he alleged
that some witnesses had lied or tailored their stories to gain fame
or to harm Simpson.
<p>
   ``We will demonstrate to you that there's an immense amount
wrong with the evidence,'' said Baker, whose client is being sued
for the ``wrongful deaths'' of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman. Asserting that the victims' families are going after
Simpson for financial gain, Baker added: ``This isn't a fight for
justice, this is a fight for money.''
<p>
   Baker began the defense team's final arguments, which are
expected to conclude today, after a heart-tugging morning
presentation by the plaintiffs' chief counsel, Daniel Petrocelli.
Petrocelli's performance left Goldman's father, Fred, and other
members of the victims' families sobbing; two jurors looking on the
verge of tears; Simpson's sister, Shirley Baker, rubbing her eyes;
and other spectators and reporters crying or trying not to.
<p>
   Petrocelli evoked that outpouring by passionately describing the
loss Fred Goldman had endured, and discussing the relationship
between fathers and sons in general. He pointedly noted that
attorney Baker frequently demonstrates pride in his own son,
Phillip, who is a defense co-counsel in this case.
<p>
   To dramatize his argument, Petrocelli showed a video of Goldman
and his father at a 1993 bat mitzvah party, at which they were
dancing, joking and, finally, laughingly pretending to play guitars
together.
<p>
   With that last scene frozen on an oversized television screen,
the plaintiff's lawyer solemnly read a 16th Century poem:
<p>
   ``My lovely, living boy, my hope, my happiness, my love, my
life, my joy.'' Then he concluded: ``Fred Goldman's lovely, living
boy is no more.''
<p>
   In his response, Baker accused Petrocelli of having
``subjected'' jurors ``to a ploy for your sympathy.'' He asked the
jury to keep in mind one question about the plaintiffs' attorneys:
``Are they attempting to sandbag the defendant?''
<p>
   Baker took hard swings at his courtroom opponents and many of
their witnesses, including personal attacks against some. He
derided a former Playboy model  &MD;  who testified she'd seen Simpson
hit his ex-wife  &MD;  as a publicity hound, and added: ``For me, it
doesn't pay to advertise, so I keep my clothes on.''
<p>
   Baker also criticized the press, which he portrayed as wanting
Simpson to be found liable to keep sensational stories going. ``If
in fact you find him not responsible, ladies and gentlemen, the
gravy train is over,'' he said.
<p>
   Jurors seemed to pay closer attention to Petrocelli than to
Baker, whose style was more more plodding and less concise. One
juror, an elderly black woman, nooded off for a couple of minutes
as the defense attorney spoke.
<p>
   Baker repeatedly charged that his adversaries intentionally
mangled reality in order to harm Simpson and win a monetary
settlement for their clients. Moreover, he mocked the use of poetry
by the plaintiffs' side.
<p>
   Evoking a famous line by Johnnie Cochran, who was Simpson's lead
criminal lawyer  &MD;  ``If the gloves don't fit, you must acquit''  &MD; 
Baker said the plaintiffs had misrepresented Simpson's opportunity
to kill anyone.
<p>
   ``I'm no poet,'' Baker said, ``but obviously if you don't have
time, you most certainly can't commit the crime.''
<p>
   The plaintiffs' closing arguments lasted longer than expected,
so the defense summation didn't begin until Wednesday afternoon. It
should conclude sometime today, followed by a short rebuttal from
Petrocelli, jury instructions and then deliberations beginning late
in the day or early tomorrow.
<p>
   Petrocelli, who began his closing statement Tuesday, Wednesday
continued to pursue a major theme: that Simpson has lied about the
murders so much, so often that his version of events cannot be
trusted on almost any count.
<p>
   While his arguments were framed largely by his final, poignant
display, Petrocelli also employed other techniques to appeal to the
jurors.
<p>
   For instance, Petrocelli presented two displays he said would
clearly demonstrate that Simpson lied consistently.
<p>
   The first huge board was labeled ``Either: Simpson is Lying. Or:
All of These Witnesses and Documents are Lying, Mistaken, or
Faked.'' Below the headline was a list of nearly five dozen
witnesses, documents, writings and other evidence that the
defendant has contradicted or accused of being mistaken.
<p>
   The second display contained 31 photographs of Simpson at a
Sept. 26, 1993, football game wearing Bruno Magli shoes. He has
repeatedly denied ever having owned that type of shoe, which left
prints at the murder scene.
<p>
   Petrocelli drew laughs at one point by likening Simpson's
explanations to a line he said was delivered by Groucho Marx when
the comedian's wife caught him in bed with another woman: ``Who you
gonna believe, me or your lying eyes?''
<p>
   After the closing argument by Petrocelli, who was hired by the
Goldman family, the jury heard briefly from John Kelly, the
attorney for the Brown estate; and from Michael Brewer, who
represents Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo.
<p>
   Simpson, who was found not guilty of murder last year, is being
sued for unspecified monetary damages by the Brown and Goldman
families. They allege that the former football star is responsible
for the victims' ``wrongful deaths.''
<p>
   Only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict to find him
liable for the killings. If that happens, a second phase of the
civil jury ensues in which Simpson's finances are presented and the
jury deliberates again about how much they want to award each
plaintiff in financial damages.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Herbert Allen Sr., the financier who with his brother
Charles engineered some of the earliest corporate takeovers by Wall
Street firms, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
<p>
   Allen, who dropped out of high school to become a stock trader,
soon joined the investment firm his brother founded, Allen &AMP; Co.,
where he was a partner for more than 55 years.
<p>
   He also served for a year as chairman of another concern known
as Allen &AMP; Co., an investment banking firm that has been run by his
son, Herbert A. Allen, since 1965.
<p>
   In recent years, Allen &AMP; Co. has helped put together some of the
biggest deals in the media and entertainment industry, including
Seagram's purchase of MCA Inc. and Sony's purchase of Columbia
Pictures.
<p>
   Long before the 1980s, when the technique became famous, the
Allen brothers specialized in corporate buyouts, in which investors
take over troubled or low-priced companies and try to turn them
around. But the Allens did not have to sell junk bonds to pay for
their purchases, as later ``buyout artists'' did, relying instead
on their own money and that of their partners.
<p>
   Though Allen generally kept a low public profile, in 1956 he
became chairman of Benguet Consolidated, which mined gold and
chrome in the Philippines. Although he had acquired control of
Benguet ``almost by accident'' when he was trading the company's
stock, his son said, Allen fought off a takeover effort by
dissident shareholders in 1962.
<p>
   His other major investments included the diversified Ogden
Corp., of which the Allen brothers' firm owned 80 percent in 1953;
the Syntex Corp., a pharmaceutical company that was at one time
owned by Ogden, and the Irvine Ranch in California, which became
the Irvine Co., the huge real estate and development concern.
<p>
   Allen owned several successful race horses and was also known
for his donations, with his relatives, of millions of dollars to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, which named a community
hospital after the family.
<p>
   In addition to his son, Allen's survivors include his wife,
Ethel; two sisters, Evelyn Henry of Arcadia, Calif., and Marjorie
Bisgood of Manhattan; a brother, Harold, of Great Neck; a daughter,
Susan, of Mamaroneck, and eight grandchildren.

<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  Tufts Health Plan is expanding its horizons. The
Waltham-based health maintenance organization Wednesday announced
plans to start selling life insurance and other employee benefits
through a partnership with Reliastar Life Insurance Co.
<p>
   The joint marketing agreement also gives Tufts the opportunity
to sell health insurance to about 160,000 Reliastar customers in
New England. About 30,000 of these customers have health insurance
with Reliastar, which plans to gradually transfer them to Tufts.
<p>
   The idea is to offer companies a one-stop-shopping service for a
spectrum of employee benefits, including retirement benefits
administration and health, life and disability insurance. Though
the two companies will jointly market their products, the
businesses will remain separate; each company will receive
commissions for selling the other's products.
<p>
   ``We want to knit together existing products rather than create
our own,'' said Jon Kingsdale, senior vice president of Tufts. ``It
allows us to meet the demands of our customers without losing our
focus on managed medical care.''
<p>
   The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Tufts to
become a major regional player in the health insurance market. Two
weeks ago, Tufts said it would acquire Prudential's Massachusetts
health insurance business, adding 51,000 members to Tufts' current
625,000 subscribers.
<p>
   Even after the acquisition, Tufts will remain the state's
third-largest HMO after Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Massachusetts. Blue Cross and Harvard do not
currently offer life insurance or other employee benefits services.
<p>
   While HMOs throughout the country merged and consolidated, Tufts
announced two years ago that it planned to remain independent.
Since then, it has grown rapidly. Between 1994 and 1996, premium
revenues jumped 58 percent to $855 million while membership soared
67 percent.
<p>
   Some of its growth has come from efforts to do business outside
of Massachusetts. Tufts has 14,000 members in New Hampshire and
5,000 in Maine. It plans to enter Rhode Island in April.
<p>
   Reliastar, formerly Northwestern National Life, is based in
Minneapolis and operates nationally, making most of its money from
selling life insurance and administering employee benefits for
other companies. Its parent company, Relia-star Financial Corp.,
also manages mutual funds and has about $2 billion in annual
revenues.

<p>
   Dr. Joseph J. Loferski, a physicist and pioneer in the
development of modern solar cells, died on Monday in Miriam
Hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 71 and lived in Providence.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for Brown University, where Loferski was an
emeritus professor of engineering, said the cause of death was
cancer.
<p>
   In a four-decade career, Loferski published more than 150
technical papers and contributed chapters to five books. Although
much of his work focused on photovoltaic cells, which convert the
energy in light to electricity, he also wrote and spoke extensively
on the physics of semiconductor materials like silicon.
<p>
   The observation that light could generate an electric current in
an electrolyte solution, known as the photovoltaic effect, was
first reported in 1839.
<p>
   What Loferski and other early researchers into solar cells
demonstrated was that semiconductor devices might one day produce
commercially competitive, pollution-free electricity. Today, solar
cells provide electricity for a variety of items, from portable
calculators to commercial satellites.
<p>
   Joseph J. Loferski was born on Aug. 7, 1925, in Hudson, Pa. In
1948, he earned a bachelor's degree from Scranton University. He
received his master's degree in 1949 and doctorate in 1953 from the
University of Pennsylvania.
<p>
   Upon graduation, he joined RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J.,
and, with Dr. Paul Rappaport, now deceased, began researching solar
energy and photovoltaic cells.
<p>
   In 1961, Loferski joined the Brown faculty as an associate
professor of engineering. He served as chairman of the school's
division of engineering from 1968 to 1974, and was associate dean
of the graduate school from 1980 to 1983.
<p>
   He was a consultant for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the Departments of Defense and the Navy, as well as
private companies, including RCA and Honeywell. He was also the
co-recipient of six patents in the semiconductor field.
<p>
   Loferski was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers, which gave him the William R. Cherry Award in
1981.
<p>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Sylvia D.
Sweeda; his mother, Mary of Hudson, Pa.; two sisters, Helen
Christman of Selinsgrove, Pa., and Marie Kunec of Falls Church,
Va.; a brother, S. James, of Kitty Hawk, N.C.; four daughters,
Patricia J., of Herndon, Va., Dr. Barbara L., of Providence,
Marianne L. Fleury of Chevy Chase, Md., and Sharon L. Engler of
Philadelphia; two sons, Joseph R. of Blacksburg, Va., and Michael
A. of Monkton, Md., and 10 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<p>
   DALLAS  &MD;  Abortion-rights supporters marked the 24th anniversary
of the landmark ``Roe vs. Wade'' decision legalizing abortion with
a Wednesday morning ``celebration of rights'' breakfast.
<p>
   At Dallas City Hall, their opponents applauded ``Jane Roe,''
Dallas resident Norma McCorvey, who defected to the anti-abortion
movement in 1995. A replica of the Liberty Bell was repeatedly rung
to memorialize the millions of fetuses aborted since 1973.
<p>
   For McCorvey, the plaintiff who in 1970 started the legal battle
that led to the Supreme Court decision, ``something just kind of
came over me and I started getting really sad'' shortly before 7
a.m. Wednesday.
<p>
   ``Give her some love,'' said Operation Rescue leader Flip Benham
and the crowd of about 100 erupted in loud applause.
<p>
   The cheers for McCorvey, who never obtained an abortion, were
enthusiastic. So were the hugs that the activists gave her before
and after she read ``Empty Playgrounds,'' a poem she wrote
condemning abortion.
<p>
   ``I sit across from a playground that I visited this eve with a
small child,'' read McCorvey, whose voice faltered at several
points. ``I know of such places where children play. I know that I
am the cause of them not being here today. These playgrounds for
innocent children now dead because of sins I helped do.''
<p>
   McCorvey was the subject of the decision that legalized U.S.
abortions, but she has become the anti-abortion movement's
highest-profile asset since joining two years ago.
<p>
   Earlier, more than 200 abortion-rights activists attended the
seventh annual Greater Dallas Coalition for Reproductive Freedom
breakfast. The coalition is composed of 40 North Texas groups that
support abortion rights.
<p>
   The breakfast at the Grand Kempinski Hotel featured the parents
of Becky Bell, an Indianapolis teen-ager who died in 1988 after
contracting an infection from an illegal abortion.
<p>
   Bell, 17, did not want to upset her parents, so she quietly
sought an illegal abortion to skirt Indiana's notification
requirements, said Judy Shure, the coalition's co-chair.
<p>
   ``Yeah, (abortion) is legal, but if access continues to be
restricted, legality is somewhat irrelevant, isn't it?'' she said.
<p>
   This year, the coalition is renewing its focus on organization,
which pales in comparison to the efforts by anti-abortion groups,
Shure said.
<p>
   ``My perception is that the `antis' have a platform; they've had
25 years to organize; they've got fundraising and networking
capabilities and so forth,'' Shure said.
<p>
   McCorvey, a former abortion clinic worker who is now a full-time
volunteer at Operation Rescue's Dallas headquarters, plans to
publish a memoir this autumn about her change of views.
<p>
   Before she joined the anti-abortion movement, Jan. 22 was not a
particularly eventful date, she said.
<p>
   ``Sometimes I would just mark it as another day,'' McCorvey said
after the rally. ``I normally spent the entire month of January
stoned and drunk ... and trying to see how many Valium I could get
out of people.''
<p>
   Benham said that while abortion remains legal, the fewest women
since 1976 are seeking them.
<p>
   ``We're winning on the streets already,'' said Benham, rattling
off a string of statistics that bolstered his case: 555 fewer
abortion clinics than in 1986, teen pregnancy rates down 2 percent
each year from 1992 through 1995, only 11 percent of medical
schools teaching abortion procedures.
<p>
   ``So you see,'' Benham said, ``everything is going downhill for
them. That's why they want to get us off the street, just to shut
up.''

   VRCIN, Yugoslavia  &MD;  A lock hangs on the door of the lone
supermarket. Middle-aged men loiter on street corners and drink
slivovic plum vodka in Vrcin's bare, shabby eateries. Local
unemployment is over 50 percent, and many of those who do work have
not seen a paycheck in months.
<p>
   If there were ever a place where Serbs should be discontented
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's authoritarian 10-year
rule, it would be this run-down working-class town in the hills 12
miles east of Belgrade.
<p>
   But Vrcin has not only avoided the kind of street protests
against Milosevic that have paralyzed the Serbian capital for nine
weeks. Here, people have rallied around their embattled president.
<p>
   ``All those people should go back to their factories, their
jobs,'' said Radovije Nenadovic, a retired truck driver. ``There
should be respect for the law and discipline. Milosevic is the only
one who can give U.S. that. Everyone else would destroy everything.
What is happening in Belgrade is a disaster.''
<p>
   Nenadovic's friend and fellow pensioner, Dobrica Teofilovic,
agreed, saying: ``Our problem is that we have too much democracy
and too much freedom.''
<p>
   The voices of these two men on the street in Vrcin provide a
clue to the mystery of Serbia's political drama: How Milosevic has
been able to largely ignore 65 straight days of high-decibel
protests in Belgrade, and pressure from the international
community, to recognize election victories by his opponents.
<p>
   The answer is that, for better or worse, most Serbs have never
bought into the image of Milosevic as the vampire of the Balkans.
Peasant farmers, pensioners and workers in small towns like Vrcin
still form the majority of Serbia's population and the backbone of
Milosevic's support. There is no sign that they are about to join
the protests by tens of thousands of students and middle-class
intellectuals that broke out in the capital after Milosevic
annulled opposition victories in local elections in Serbia's 14
largest cities.
<p>
   According to a recent poll by the Institute for Social Sciences
in Belgrade, considered a reliable source of sociological data, 51
percent of Serbia's adults disapprove of the protests while only 9
percent approve. The remaining 40 percent refused to give an
opinion or said they were unaware of the protests.
<p>
   Opposition leaders acknowledge that they lack the nationwide
support they need if their quest to topple Europe's last
Communist-era dictator is to succeed.
<p>
   ``What is happening in the streets of Belgrade has created the
impression that we are winning,'' said Zoran Djindjic, a leader of
the opposition coalition, Zajedno. ``The reality is that Milosevic
still has the support of over half the population. It would be a
mistake if this visual image makes U.S. think we have the
majority.''
<p>
   Lost in the commotion over the colorful and witty daily protests
in Belgrade is that Milosevic's Socialist party won a decisive
victory in local elections Nov. 17 in 134 of 189 municipalities
across Serbia. The Socialists also won a landslide in elections to
Yugoslavia's federal parliament, winning over 60 percent of seats.
<p>
   Milosevic's Socialists swept to an easy victory in Vrcin, an
electoral success that belied the economic misery felt by his
supporters.
<p>
   Once a prosperous agricultural center famous for its big houses
and a well-fed population of 10,000, Vrcin  &UR; today &LR;  harvests the
bitter fruit of four years of sanctions imposed on Serbia to punish
Milosevic for instigating the Balkans war, and what economists say
is an even longer record of mismanagement and corruption by the
Serbian leader's Socialist government.
<p>
   But no one interviewed last week in Vrcin saw it that way.
<p>
   ``For the average Serb, Milosevic has been good. He is the best
one to protect U.S. from foreign influences,'' said Zivadin Mitric,
principal of the local elementary school.
<p>
   Such words, heard repeatedly on the streets of Vrcin, in part
reflect the success of the government's information blockade
outside the capital. There is no way for anyone without a shortwave
radio in Vrcin to learn about what is going on in Belgrade.
State-run television, the only readily available source of
information, paints the protesters as a fifth column of
destructive, foreign agents of influence in the rare times it
mentions the rallies at all. When 500,000 people demonstrated in
Belgrade on the Orthodox New Year's eve, it did not make the front
page of leading state-controlled Serbian newspapers.
<p>
   But the mood in Vrcin is more than just a creation of
Milosevic's propaganda machine. Most people in Serbia support the
regime because, as badly as they live, they believe any changes in
the country's socialist system will only make their lives worse.
<p>
   ``The real reason is that people are afraid,'' said Mihajlo
Markovic, a former senior adviser to Milosevic who was purged from
the ruling party in 1994 after a protracted ideological
disagreement with the president's powerful wife, the leader of a
neo-Marxist faction in the government.
<p>
   Markovic said calls by some of Zajedno's leaders for rapid
privatization, loosening of trade restrictions and economic
integration with the rest of Europe are seen as a threat by workers
and collective farmers.
<p>
   ``The reason peasants and workers do not join is that they are
afraid of rapid privatization, they are afraid they will lose their
jobs and pensions,'' he said. ``They look at how people live much
worse in places that have started reforms, like Bulgaria and
Russia, and they figure, `We don't want any part of that.'''
<p>
   Compared with other parts of Eastern Europe, Serbia is a
relatively rich country, where average monthly salaries  &MD;  at $150 a
month  &MD;  are five times the average in Bulgaria. Although annual
inflation is hovering at 100 percent, that is bearable for
Serbians, who remember the height of sanctions in 1993, when it was
common to see prices double several times in a day.
<p>
   Still, with national unemployment at 52 percent and nearly half
of those who do work on forced unpaid leave, it is hard to
understand what keeps voters loyal to the regime. According to
economist Alexandra Posarac, a consultant to the World Bank in
Belgrade, few of the 800,000 Serb workers eligible for unemployment
benefits actually collect the money they are entitled to.
<p>
   Posarac suggests that a different kind of fear keeps Serbs from
joining protests. Small towns are usually built around one or two
large enterprises, whose directors are inevitably members of the
ruling Socialist party, and often members of the government. This
makes it easier for Milosevic's ruling party to control small towns
than urban centers like Belgrade. Factories provide a state-owned
apartment, health care, and medicine and education. Even if
salaries and pensions are late or nonexistent, factories provide
occasional ``food stipends.''
<p>
   ``The state's social safety net is full of holes, but anyone who
wants to have some sense of social security has to stay out of the
streets,'' Posarac said.
<p>
   The pressure to support the regime, or at least keep quiet,
affects many small private traders whose business depends on the
support of state-run firms.
<p>
   ``Local bosses have levers to prevent you from conducting
business,'' said Zoran Obradovic, a butcher who sells meat to
state-owned factories in Vrcin and other localities.
<p>
   Local politicians also have to show loyalty to the directors  &MD; 
which means that even if Zajedno had been allowed its election
victories, the coalition's ability to change things would have
probably been tempered by this dependence.
<p>
   Milosevic's grip on the economy and public opinion seems to have
ensured his survival in the short run. But there is no denying that
the Serbian leader inflicted serious damage on himself by denying
the Zajedno coalition its relatively harmless election successes.
He turned a weak, quarrelsome opposition into a freedom movement
that has humiliated and outwitted his heavy-handed attempts to
muzzle its daily demonstrations.
<p>
   Milosevic could have instead won points as a democrat, by
letting the opposition take control of Belgrade and other
municipalities  &MD;  and their share of the blame for Serbia's economic
ills. Even now, most analysts believe Milosevic could cut his
losses by allowing Zajedno its victories, which would probably end
the daily protests.
<p>
   ``The main reason this is not happening is that Milosevic, like
his predecessors, is bent on absolute power,'' said Ranko Petkovic,
a Belgrade political analyst and former dissident who spent eight
years in prison under Yugoslavia's Communist dictator, Josef Tito,
who ruled until his death in 1980.
<p>
   But unlike Tito, who opened Yugoslavia to foreign investment
despite his iron grip at home, Milosevic's present course is
leading Serbia quickly back down the road of international
isolation from which it only recently emerged with the Dayton
agreements and the lifting of sanctions.
<p>
   Western governments have stated that Serbia will continue to be
denied membership in international financial institutions like the
World Bank until the government implements democratic reform and
recognizes the results of the Nov. 17 poll.
<p>
   ``The basic strategic goal for Yugoslavia, to reintegrate in the
international community, is now on hold,'' Petkovic said. ``There
is no money coming in from abroad. Foreign capital avoids
instability. We were about to begin to live better. Now, that is
not going to happen.''
<p>
   The trouble for Milosevic is where to find the money to keep
paying for the social benefits that preserve his support in the
countryside. Barring that, Milosevic could go looking for an
outside enemy to blame for Serbia's troubles. Whether that means a
crackdown in Belgrade similar to the one in 1991 when Milosevic
sent tanks to crush street demonstrations, or a campaign against
ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern Serbia province of
Kosovo  &MD;  the approach that helped kick off the war in Bosnia and
Croatia  &MD;  many observers fear that is when Serbia's real problems
would begin.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Over the last 15 years, a self-made businessman from
New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to hospitals,
universities and other beneficiaries  &MD;  but has done it in such
absolute secrecy that most recipients never learned who their
benefactor was.
<p>
   The donor, Charles Feeney, who made his fortune with a string of
duty-free airport shops, covered his tracks so well that business
magazines for years have estimated his net worth in the billions,
not realizing that he had transferred most of his assets to his two
charitable foundations and is actually worth less than $5 million.
<p>
   After years of secrecy, Feeney agreed this week to discuss his
gifts because the duty-free empire was sold this month to the
company that makes Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne, and a lawsuit over the
sale would have revealed his anonymous donations.
<p>
   Feeney  &MD;  who has strong ties to Ireland and has made many gifts
there, including personal donations to Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing  &MD;  was matter-of-fact in describing why he had given
away his fortune. ``I simply decided I had enough money,'' he said.
``It doesn't drive my life. I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind
of guy.''
<p>
   While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of,
the scope and style of Feeney's giving, and his passion for total
secrecy, are rare, according to independent experts on
philanthropy. ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' said
Thomas Troyer, a senior partner in the law firm of Caplin &AMP;
Drysdale in Washington, who specializes in philanthropic law.
<p>
   Harvey Dale, a New York University tax law professor and
president of Feeney's Atlantic Foundation, who has helped Feeney
orchestrate his gifts since 1982, said: ``He doesn't own a house.
He doesn't own a car. He flies economy. And I think his watch cost
about $15.''
<p>
   It was Dale who helped Feeney set up his foundations, which like
his Duty Free Shoppes chain are based in Bermuda, thus avoiding the
disclosure requirements of private foundations in the United
States.
<p>
   From the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to Portland
State University in Oregon, none of the American recipients of
Feeney's largesse knew who their benefactor was. Grants were paid
by cashier's check to conceal the source. In fact, the
beneficiaries never realized that they owed their thanks to a
single giver  &MD;  they were told that the money came from several
generous ``clients'' who wished to remain anonymous.
<p>
   Few of the recipients had ever even met Dale or Joel Fleishman,
the president of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which actually
gave away the money on behalf of Feeney's two foundations, the
Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust.
<p>
   Dr. Robert Butler of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine said he
met Feeney in 1990 while making a proposal for funding to an
advisory board that reviewed grant proposals.
<p>
   ``I had no idea that he was the main supporter of what I call
the Anonymous Foundation,'' Butler said, adding that the grant was
made, starting the International Longevity Center at the New York
Academy of Medicine. ``Anonymous giving, giving that is not
dependent on ego, is just really rare.''
<p>
   Feeney said that by giving anonymously, he could go about his
life unhampered by pitches for donations. ``There are people who
want, and rightly deserve, recognition for giving, but in our case
it wasn't important,'' he said.
<p>
   In 1984, when Feeney gave his 38.75 percent interest in the Duty
Free Shoppes chain to the two foundations, even his partner, Robert
Miller, was not told. Now, proceeds from the sale of the chain
earlier this month, along with his other business assets, a total
of $3.5 billion, are owned by the foundations.
<p>
   Feeney's charitable enterprise would rank as the nation's
fourth-largest grant-making foundation if it were based in the
United States, yet the two groups operate with tiny staffs, just 20
professionals in the United States and overseas.
<p>
   Duty-Free Shoppes has sales of more than $3 billion annually,
mostly in liquors and luxury goods, more than the combined sales of
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman-Marcus.
<p>
   The foundation's largest single grant was $30 million, according
to Dale, who refused to identify the recipient on grounds that the
information might discourage other donors from supporting it. ``One
reason for keeping gifts anonymous is to avoid what we call this
`crowding out' effect,'' Dale said.
<p>
   Recipients were effusive in their praise for their anonymous
donor's style of giving and what it had enabled them to do. ``This
is operational support, the most valuable kind of assistance,''
said William Nelsen, president of the Citizens' Scholarship
Foundation of America, in St. Peter, Minnesota, which has received
support since 1984, one of the oldest recipients.
<p>
   Nelson said that the group, which mobilizes community groups to
raise money for college student aid, was able to significantly
expand its ``Dollars for Scholars'' program to reach 770 chapters
throughout the country, thanks in large part to Atlantic money,
which he said was more than a million dollars.

<p>
   ``As an organization, we've more than quadrupled in size since
getting support from this anonymous donor,'' Nelsen said.
<p>
   At the College Board, which administers scholastic assessment
tests for college-bound high school seniors, the mystery donor was
always referred to by the name ``anonymous,'' said Dr. Donald
Stewart, president of the College Board.
<p>
   ``Anonymous was most interested in results,'' Stewart said. The
anonymous donor supported ``long-term research to establish whether
we are right, which is crucial for the project's credibility and in
assessing whether schools should adopt the same approach,'' he
said.
<p>
   Several recipients said that once they were invited to apply for
funds their plans were closely examined. ``Ed McMahon did not knock
on my door,'' said Chuck Supple, president of Public Allies, which
places young people in internships with nonprofit organizations.
``These guys really kick the tires.''
<p>
   Judith Ramaley, president of Portland State University called
her first foundation grant last year her ``catalyst,'' financing of
less than one million dollars that enabled the school to publicize
its innovative new curriculum and links to the community, which
have now drawn national attention and the support of other
foundations. ``We were out of cash when they came along,'' she
said. ``They were the trail mix at that key moment on our very
steep hiking path,'' she said.
<p>
   Feeney's contributions in Ireland account for more than half of
Atlantic's international giving and about one-quarter of overall
giving. In addition to Ireland, the foundation supports projects in
South Africa, the former Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, Israel and
Jordan.
<p>
   There was less secrecy surrounding Feeney's activities in
Ireland. Several Irish university presidents and other
beneficiaries said they had met Feeney several times; they also
knew, they added, that he had a connection to the Atlantic
foundations.
<p>
   Feeney also said he had given substantial personal donations  &MD; 
not from the Atlantic foundations  &MD;  to the Washington office of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which
in 1994 entered into a cease fire with the British that broke down
last February. Public records show that Feeney has contributed some
$280,000  &MD;  making him the group's single largest American donor.
<p>
   Feeney said that his gifts to Sinn Fein had been carefully
monitored to insure that they supported only nonviolent activities,
and that he had continued supporting the Washington office despite
the cease-fire's collapse last February, ``because I'm hopeful that
it will be renewed.''
<p>
   The Atlantic Foundation's board of directors includes several
prominent personalities in the philanthropic and educational
establishment  &MD;  among them, Elizabeth McCormack, a senior adviser
on charitable giving to members of the Rockefeller family and vice
chairman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation;
Frank Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University, Michael
Sovern, president of the Shubert Foundation and president emeritus
of Columbia University, and Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., an attorney
and chairman of the Natural Resources Defense Council. None of them
had disclosed their connection with the Atlantic groups publicly,
nor did they ever discuss Feeney's giving with peers or even their
families, they said in interviews this week.
<p>
   ``This organization has operated on a need-to-know basis,''
Fleishman said.
<p>
   Most recipients  &MD;  a partial list of which was provided by APS  &MD; 
said their only contact was with program officers of the APS, the
for-profit group that selects the grantees, gives out the money,
and evaluates the outcome of what has been given away.
<p>
   Rhodes, the foundation board member and former president of
Cornell, said that the foundation was careful not to use money to
tell recipients what to do or how to do it. ``The danger with
foundations is that sometimes the staff and board come to feel that
they own the money,'' Rhodes said, ``and they micromanage. We have
a motto: noses in, fingers out.''
<p>
   Dale said of the relationship to grant recipients: ``We are
voyeurs. We let good people do good things. We oversee, but we
don't interfere.''
<p>
   And despite his decision finally to disclose his donations,
Feeney is still trying to keep a low profile. He declined this week
to be photographed.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Maria Haley, a longtime aide to President Clinton
who is now an appointee of his at the Export-Import Bank, tried
last year to push through an unusual $6.5 million financing deal
sought by a woman whose large donations to the Democratic Party are
under investigation, interviews and government records show.
<p>
   The proposed deal called for the government bank to help a
company controlled by one of Thailand's wealthiest families finance
a Blockbuster video store franchise in Bangkok.
<p>
   Officials of the bank say the proposal initially ran into stiff
resistance because it seemed to fall outside the mandate of the
institution, whose chief mission is to provide low-cost government
financing to encourage exports and thereby support jobs in America.
<p>
   But Ms. Haley, a former White House official who by then had
become one of the bank's directors, prodded its staff to support
the project, and the deal won approval from one group of bank
officials before collapsing amid unresolved questions about the
franchise's operations.
<p>
   The project was put together in large part by Pauline
Kanchanalak, a Thai businesswoman who attended an important meeting
of Export-Import Bank officials at Ms. Haley's office last summer.
Last year, Mrs. Kanchanalak has said, she and her relatives donated
more than $200,000 to the Democratic Party, most of which was later
returned because of questions about its origins.
<p>
   It is not known whether Ms. Haley was aware of Mrs.
Kanchanalak's donations, and a White House spokesman said the
president was not aware of the Blockbuster deal, which would have
been a small one for the bank.
<p>
   Still, Ms. Haley's effort to push the deal forward is one of the
first signs that some Democratic donors with foreign ties were
seeking more specific help from the government than coffee meetings
and photos with the president. It also illustrates how some donors,
in their efforts to get federal assistance, tapped into a close
network of friends and associates from Clinton's Arkansas days and
zeroed in on agencies involved in promoting international trade.
<p>
   Mrs. Kanchanalak's donations were solicited by John Huang, the
Democratic fund-raiser now at the center of federal inquiries into
questionable donations from Asian and Asian-American business
interests. Huang also arranged for Mrs. Kanchanalak to attend a
White House coffee meeting with Clinton last June 18, a day when
she made $85,000 of the contributions to the party.
<p>
   Records at the Export-Import Bank show that Huang also called
Ms. Haley on June 18. And he called her twice during a crucial week
in August when the fate of the Blockbuster deal was being decided.
Huang and Ms. Haley are friends dating from the mid-1980s in Little
Rock, where they both knew Clinton, who was then governor of
Arkansas.
<p>
   Neither Ms. Haley nor Mrs. Kanchanalak would comment on the
Blockbuster deal, and Huang and his lawyer have declined, since he
came under investigation last fall, to talk about any aspect of his
fund-raising.
<p>
   Asked about the Blockbuster project, David Carter, the
Export-Import Bank's vice president for communications, said that
in order to protect confidential business information of its
applicants, he could not discuss any specific deal.
<p>
   But he did say that the bank had recently undertaken a study of
whether it should get more involved in financing overseas
franchises that might benefit American business, and that ``I am
confident that the bank and Director Haley have acted appropriately
at every turn.''
<p>
   Ms. Haley's telephone and appointment records, obtained by
congressional investigators, show that she was a prime contact for
a small circle of Clinton's former aides, golf buddies and
associates from Little Rock who have tried to use their connections
to make big business deals in Asia. One of them, Mark Grobmyer, an
Arkansas lawyer, met with Ex-Im officials considering the
Blockbuster financing, officials of the bank said.
<p>
   THE LONG ROAD FROM LITTLE ROCK
<p>
   Ms. Haley was one of the first staff members whom Clinton hired
after he became governor of Arkansas in 1979. She later accompanied
him on trade missions to Asia, heading the state's efforts to
attract foreign investment. After Clinton became president in 1993,
she served as a deputy White House personnel director under Bruce
Lindsey. The president nominated her to the Ex-Im Bank's board in
1994.
<p>
   Ms. Haley, 53, a native Filipino, grew up in a prominent
diplomatic family; her brother, Felipe Mabilangan, is the
Philippines' chief delegate to the United Nations.
<p>
   In an interview last fall, she said that as a White House aide
she had tried to help fellow Asian-Americans win federal
appointments. She said she was an old friend of Huang, whom she met
when he worked for a bank in Little Rock, and had helped get him a
job at the Commerce Department, where he was involved in promoting
trade before he joined the Democratic Party's fund-raising staff in
late 1995.
<p>
   Ms. Haley said she also kept in touch with ``old friends from
Arkansas,'' like Grobmyer, after becoming one of the Ex-Im Bank's
five directors. She said she had given them and their clients basic
information on the bank's lending programs.
<p>
   James T. Riady, a wealthy Indonesian businessman who was friends
with Clinton and Ms. Haley in Arkansas, visited her twice at the
bank, once with Huang. She also had contacts with Mark Middleton
and C. Joseph Giroir Jr., both Little Rock lawyers.
<p>
   According to Ms. Haley's appointment records, Giroir visited her
with an Indonesian media executive, Peter Gontha, to discuss
satellite exports last May. She also had dinner in 1995 with
Grobmyer and Steve Bova, an executive of Alltel, a Little Rock
information processing company. Bova said in an interview that
Alltel had hired Grobmyer to help the company ``navigate around how
do we get things like Ex-Im guarantees.''
<p>
   In the interview last fall, Ms. Haley said Grobmyer was
``interested in the Ex-Im Bank'' as a vehicle for developing
business opportunities for possible clients.
<p>
   Grobmyer's office issued a statement Wednesday saying that he
had been aware of the Blockbuster proposal but that he had never
had any financial interest in it. Instead, the statement said, his
attendance at any meetings about the Blockbuster deal ``related to
his interest in the Export-Import Bank's ability to engage in
franchise finance activities.''

<p>
   THE EMERGENCE OF THE THAI COUNCIL
<p>
   Ms. Haley has said it was Grobmyer who introduced her to the
U.S.-Thai Business Council, a private trade-promotion group.
<p>
   The business council was created in 1994 by a group including
Mrs. Kanchanalak, a Thai citizen who lives in Virginia, with the
help of Grobmyer, who is a member. Huang also helped, writing a
memorandum at the Commerce Department noting that ``there are quite
a few members in this proposed council from Arkansas.''
<p>
   In 1994, at the time that Mrs. Kanchanalak was seeking a
government endorsement to give the new council more prestige than
similar rival groups, she donated $32,000 to the Democratic Party.
As a legal resident of the United States, she was entitled to make
political donations.
<p>
   But after the questions about Huang's fund-raising activities
surfaced last fall, the Democratic National Committee returned most
of an additional $200,000 that Mrs. Kanchanalak gave or raised last
year, saying the origin of some of the money was not clearly
documented.
<p>
   One goal of the business council was to familiarize Thai
businessmen, including the group seeking the Blockbuster franchise,
with American trade programs. The Export-Import Bank, an
independent agency, has played an important role in the Clinton
administration's strategy to create high-paying American jobs
through the promotion of trade.
<p>
   According to people familiar with the Blockbuster deal, a Thai
conglomerate, the Sun Tech Group, controlled by one of Thailand's
wealthiest businessmen, Sawasdi Horrungruang, first approached the
Ex-Im Bank in late 1995 or early 1996.
<p>
   Businessmen said the Thais had sought help from the American
bank because financing for American-style franchise rights was hard
to come by in Thailand, and a repayment guarantee from the Ex-Im
Bank would lower the interest rates that the Thais had to pay.
<p>
   One of Sun Tech's subsidiaries had agreed to pay $7.7 million to
the Blockbuster Entertainment Group, a Florida-based division of
Viacom Inc., for the rights to operate more than 100 video rental
stores in Thailand. The deal was to be financed by SunTrust Credit,
a Little Rock unit of a large Florida bank chain.
<p>
   Although business associates estimate that Horrungruang is worth
hundreds of millions of dollars, SunTrust asked the Ex-Im Bank to
insure repayment of 85 percent of the loan, or $6.5 million.
<p>
   The Thai company, with Mrs. Kanchanalak as its agent, argued to
the Ex-Im Bank that this was a valid if novel use of bank
resources, because over time millions of dollars in franchise
royalties would flow back to Blockbuster's American headquarters.
<p>
   But staff officials at the bank, which is best known for
financing huge export sales of Boeing aircraft or Caterpillar
tractors, were highly skeptical, government officials said.
<p>
   While the bank has expanded into a broader array of deals in
recent years, it is required to focus on export sales that do not
qualify for private financing or in which American companies are
competing against financing subsidized by foreign governments.
<p>
   As a result, the video proposal languished for several months at
the bank, while staff officials sought more information about the
Thai investors and how the loan would be repaid, according to
records and officials.
<p>
   Then Ms. Haley, who has generally prodded bank officials to be
more imaginative and who within the bank has been a champion for
small businesses, got involved, bank officials said. And by last
summer the proposal had gained new life.
<p>
   A bank official met with Sun Tech executives in Thailand on July
1 while in Asia on a business trip and later filed a report noting
that the Blockbuster deal could help promote the franchising of
American businesses throughout Asia.
<p>
   Bank officials said Ms. Haley had often inquired about the
status of the video franchise deal, and one official recalled that
at some point she said, ``Let's do it.''
<p>
   Although the bank's directors formally approve all transactions
of more than $10 million, this deal needed the approval of only one
group of senior officials and the bank's loan committee, also made
up of senior officers. But the directors can also meet with
potential bank customers and involve themselves in any issue.
<p>
   Bank officials said Ms. Haley had also been host at a crucial
meeting in her office attended by bank officials and Mrs.
Kanchanalak.
<p>
   As a result of the meeting, the bank took steps to reduce any
risk it would face if it reached any arrangement with the Thais.
One plan was to require Horrungruang to pledge that he would be
personally liable for the loan's repayment before any demands could
be made by the lender against the bank's own guarantee.
<p>
   Records show that last Aug. 13, only a few days after the
meeting in Ms. Haley's office, the first group of senior officials
recommended that the Ex-Im Bank's loan committee approve the deal.
<p>
   Bank records also show that Mrs. Kanchanalak and Huang
frequently made contact with Ms. Haley during the time when Ms.
Haley was giving critical support to the deal.
<p>
   While the records do not reveal what was discussed, they do show
that Mrs. Kanchanalak called Ms. Haley on June 25, met with her on
July 16 and called her on Aug. 13 and Aug. 14.
<p>
   In addition to calling Ms. Haley on June 18, the day of Mrs.
Kanchanalak's meeting with Clinton, Huang also called Ms. Haley on
Aug. 8 and Aug. 12, the records show.
<p>
   The bank loan committee considered giving final approval to the
video deal last August, with Ms. Haley in attendance, according to
bank officials. The committee withheld approval pending further
financial information about the Thai group, but the group decided
that month to drop the effort to get the bank's financing, bank
officials said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, in Bangkok, the Blockbuster deal has gone forward,
without Ex-Im help, and the Thai group has already opened six
stores. Horrungruang said Sun Tech would still be delighted to get
the ``cheap loan'' through Ex-Im. But even though the project's
supporters had argued that financing to buy franchise rights was
unavailable in Thailand, Horrungruang said the company had found
the money it needed there.

 &UR; THINGS TURN WACKY ON PLANET PARCELLS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   They got off the elevator together. They shared a podium and
even tried cracking jokes. But the Bill Parcells-Bob Kraft act most
likely played to one of its final audiences.
<p>
   Two people familiar with the plans of both the New England
Patriots' coach and the team's owner indicated Wednesday that the
split between them is irrevocable, and that it is merely a question
of ironing out disputes in the contract before Parcells leaves to
coach elsewhere  &MD;  presumably the Jets.
<p>
   Yet, they made a show of unity Wednesday to diffuse a
controversy that each fears could affect the team only days before
the Super Bowl.
<p>
   Parcells introduced Kraft by saying: ``We will discuss the
situation about the future as expeditiously as possible and I can
also assure you that it's going to be done in a very civil and a
very friendly manner.''
<p>
   Kraft then said, jokingly: ``Bill Parcells will be the new
manager of our paper and packaging group.'' Kraft also made an
obscure reference to Mickey Corcoran, Parcells' old high school
coach and long-time mentor, quipping that he would be the new
Patriots' coach.
<p>
   Joking aside, Kraft, according to one of the people familiar
with the situation, is said to believe that he is due monetary
compensation for releasing Parcells from the fifth and final year
of his contract  &MD;  even though Kraft maintained publicly he did it
in deference to Parcells' concerns about his health.
<p>
   And Parcells is believed to be unable to continue operating in a
system where he will not be given the last word on football
matters. He was hired with those powers in 1993, but that agreement
was with the owner at the time, James Busch Orthwein, who sold the
team a year later to Kraft.
<p>
   Since then, Bobby Grier has been elevated to head of player
personnel and runs the draft.
<p>
   If in fact Parcells leaves New England, a likely successor would
be the team's quarterback coach, Chris Palmer.
<p>
   Eyes and Spies Everywhere
<p>
   This is the price of playing in a small market.
<p>
   Green Bay safety LeRoy Butler says that while he loves the fans
of the city, sometimes they talk a little too much. Butler says
that when he and teammates go out on the town, fans who see them
will call Packers Coach Mike Holmgren and tell him what the players
were doing.
<p>
   Some of the cheeseheads, apparently, double as spies.
<p>
   ``Coach Holmgren is always telling us about certain
situations,'' Butler said. ``He brings up things that I know
someone called him about. But the fans will call him and say, `They
were doing this at this bar.' Then we'll be in meetings, and coach
will say, `Why were you guys doing this?' He knows everything we
do.''
<p>
   Giants Pick Coaches
<p>
   The Giants named John Fox, formerly Oakland's defensive
coordinator, to the same position with them. It is also expected
that the team will soon name Jim Skipper, the former Arizona
running backs coach, as the offensive coordinator.
<p>
   Coach Jim Fassel has also interviewed Larry Mac Duff, the former
University of Arizona defensive coordinator, for the defensive line
coach job. He also interviewed John Dunn, the former San Diego
strength and conditioning coach, to do the same for the Giants. On
Wednesday, Fassel interviewed both Skipper and John Matsko, the
former New Orleans offensive line coach.
<p>
   The Giants also announced that former Nebraska defensive lineman
Christian Peter has signed with the team.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is never so warm and generous
with his praise as when he is boasting of the achievements of his
Police Department and the dramatic drop in crime it has helped
produce. But for most of his term, the city employees with whom he
has had the coldest relationship has been the 38,000 police
officers who do the crime fighting.
<p>
   Almost all of the other major city unions  &MD;  teachers, teamsters,
municipal workers  &MD;  have swallowed their earlier skepticism of the
Republican mayor and accepted the five-year contracts that fiscal
watchdogs criticized as too generous.
<p>
   The one union that seemed the most enthusiastic about Giuliani's
candidacy was the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, whose members
saw him as far more sympathetic than the rival they despised,
former Mayor David Dinkins.
<p>
   Now, in what may be the singular paradox of the Giuliani era,
this administration's relationship with the PBA may be even more
bitter than was Dinkins', despite the leading role of law
enforcement on Giuliani's agenda.
<p>
   After nearly three years of recriminations, the union's
leadership Tuesday rejected a contract offer from the mayor more
generous than the ones accepted by the other major unions.
<p>
   Thursday, union officials say, police officers at every station
house in the city will begin picketing the best-known law
enforcement mayor the city has had in decades.
<p>
   As contract negotiations head to a binding arbitration process
that seems stacked against the union, the protests are likely to
continue for months, a bizarre backdrop to an election campaign in
which the mayor will run primarily on the city's drop in crime.
<p>
   In part, the breakdown in relations between the mayor and his
police force stems precisely from the high expectations that police
officers had of his administration.
<p>
   Thousands of city police officers live in the suburbs and deeply
resent that their suburban colleagues make 30 to 40 percent more
than they do. Surely a mayor with a law-enforcement background
would finally right that imbalance, many officers believed.
<p>
   ``He asked us to do a job,'' said Officer John Flynn, a union
delegate at the 13th Precinct on East 21st Street in Manhattan,
describing the sense of betrayal expressed by many officers
Wednesday. ``We did the job. They wanted us to go out and make
arrests. We did it. For the first time since the '60s, we blew a
thousand homicides. He always says that we're doing a great job.
But where's the money in our pockets?''
<p>
   But Giuliani was just as interested in cutting spending as he
was in cutting crime, and in 1994, he forced the PBA to accept
essentially the same raise as every other city employee, despite
the union's protests that it should receive special treatment
because the lives of officers were on the line.
<p>
   Almost immediately, the PBA began a strategy to bypass the city
by getting the state Legislature to shift its contract negotiations
to a more generous state arbitration board.
<p>
   The Legislature has a far closer relationship to the union after
years of taking its generous campaign contributions and went along
with the plan, only to see the effort overturned by the state's
highest court last month.
<p>
   It was that strategy that the mayor angrily assailed Wednesday
in lamenting the union's rejection of his contract offer, which
would give the union a raise of almost 16 percent over five years.
<p>
   The architect of that strategy and the union's chief negotiator,
James Lysaght, was indicted Wednesday on federal corruption
charges, a fact that Giuliani took pains to note in a clear sign of
contempt toward the union's leadership.
<p>
   ``The whole thing in Albany never made any sense,'' he said at a
news conference. ``It never made any sense that any mayor, no
matter how supportive you are of the police, no matter how you love
the police and care about the police, is going to let labor
relations slip away from the city and go to Albany.''
<p>
   It also set up the expectation that police officers could
legitimately compare their salaries to those of the suburbs,
because the state board is explicitly allowed to make such a
comparison in arbitrating police salary disputes.
<p>
   By contrast, the city's Board of Collective Bargaining, which
will now decide the contract's fate, can only compare the contract
to other city unions.
<p>
   The mayor argued that New York police salaries could only be
compared with those of other major cities  &MD;  not suburbs  &MD;  and said
his offer would put local salaries above those of other East Coast
cities.
<p>
   Joseph Mancini, a spokesman for the PBA, said the union believed
New York ranks seventh out of the top 10 cities in the country for
police salaries. ``It is meaningless for him to say that in five
years it will give us salaries as good or better than other major
cities when he has no idea where those cities will be in five
years,'' Mancini said.
<p>
   Police officers said they were most upset by having to take two
years of no raises  &MD;  1995 and 1996  &MD;  before the new raise offer
would begin this April. There was also resentment expressed that
newly hired officers would lose 20 minutes a day of ``wash-up
time'' and would have to work an extra 10 days a year.
<p>
   The proposal is the same one made in 1994 by the Citizens Budget
Commission, a fiscal monitoring group, which said the 20 minutes
was wasted every day. By putting officers on the street an extra 10
days a year, the group said, the city could save $50 million
annually. The union hated the idea when it was first proposed, and
the Giuliani administration also dismissed it. But now, the
administration has thrown the proposal back at the union as a means
of paying for a raise 2.5 percent larger than that of other unions.
<p>
   Top union officials were not talking Wednesday, and thus could
not explain their thinking in rejecting the contract. But
administration officials, shaking their heads at the move, think
the union leaders were simply playing to the anger of their
members.
<p>
   When the panel issues its ruling in three to five months, the
union leadership can blame the new contract on the arbitrators, and
step up its oratory against the mayor.
<p>
   When that happens, in the middle of an election campaign,
today's rancor may seem mild by comparison.

<p>
   NEW OORLEANS  &MD;  They call Packers defensive end Reggie White the
minister of defense. It's a clever play on the fact that White is
an ordained minister and an associate pastor at the Inner City
Church in Knoxville, Tenn., and one of the most menacing
pass-rushers in the National Football League.
<p>
   White is a reverent man. He believes that God paved the way for
the Packers to get into the Super Bowl so that he could have a
platform to advance his ministry.
<p>
   But that platform might not extend beyond the final whistle of
the game against the Patriots on Sunday.
<p>
   If the Packers win the Super Bowl, White may want to use the
post-game moments to say a prayer in front of the stadium crowd
and, possibly, on live television. Some people in the NFL, however,
are concerned about this and have discussed it in meetings,
according to a person familiar with the situation.
<p>
   To the league, the post-game platform at the Super Bowl is
reserved for presentation ceremonies and live televised interviews
of players and coaches.
<p>
   Players often kneel in prayer on the field during and after a
game. But should White be able to express his religious views to a
worldwide audience simply because his team was victorious in a
football game? Does religion have a place in the NFL, sharing space
on stage with the league's signature event?
<p>
   Greg Aiello, a league spokesman, said the NFL had not discussed
the situation in any staff meetings and that no request had been
made for any formal post-game prayer ceremony.
<p>
   This is not an issue with any real villains, but it is a
delicate situation. If White could espouse religious views, why not
someone else with a political agenda? The league can't take away
White's First Amendment rights to free speech, but it can deny him
a free microphone.
<p>
   Christianity and spirituality are pervasive in society and in
the NFL, and they have had a strong presence around the Packers
during this Super Bowl week. White's spirituality is a strong
influence in the Packers' locker room. He often prays with
teammates like receiver Don Beebe and tight end Keith Jackson and
has many other believers on the team.
<p>
   This belief is strong, too. Desmond Howard, the Packers' ace
punt-return specialist, said he was troubled by a severe hip injury
in training camp. Being a free agent who had bounced around with a
couple of teams before joining the Packers, Howard was worried that
he would not heal fast enough to make an impact before the final
cuts. A former first-round pick by the Redskins, Howard was running
out of chances.
<p>
   ``I consulted with Reggie,'' Howard said. ``We prayed together.
He prayed for my hip to heal. It got better. I was able to play in
the first preseason game and I returned a punt 77 yards.''
<p>
   Jackson said players believe so strongly in White's ministry,
which Jackson described as ``teaching a man to fish,'' that several
players donated money from an NFL Players Association dues rebate
to White's ministry. It totaled about $170,000.
<p>
   Jackson said the players have a greater awareness of their
responsibilities to the outside world.
<p>
   ``It starts with Reggie and guys like me and Don Beebe,''
Jackson said. ``We're willing to take a role-model stance, reach
out to kids and say, `Hey, this is not what you're supposed to be
doing.' We're an unselfish team and we echo that message to little
league and high school football teams. We accept the role of a role
model.''
<p>
   Quarterback Brett Favre, one of the Packers' most irreverent
players, doesn't feel he has to reign himself in when he is around
White. They do, however, have a very good relationship.
<p>
   ``Whether or not you believe what Reggie believes or not, you
have to respect him,'' Favre said. ``He doesn't do anything for
himself. Everything he does is for other people. He's a good person
and he means well.''
<p>
   White is trying to rebuild his Knoxville church, which was
destroyed by arson a year ago.
<p>
   White has said that through his ministry, he offers low-interest
business loans. He said he had been trying to contact Magic Johnson
about an idea to build 24-hour basketball gymnasiums next to the
movie theaters Johnson is building in inner-city neighborhoods
around the country. White said they have a proposal from the city
of Indianapolis to build a 24-hour gym.
<p>
   ``To me, when you help people out of their situations you don't
have to preach much to them,'' White said. ``In order to meet
people's spiritual needs, we have to meet some of their economic
needs. That's what we've been working on.''
<p>
   White believes the country will be a better place if people
become more spiritually enlightened.
<p>
   For White, who has said that God has made the football field his
pulpit, religion and football are as natural as a three-point
stance.
<p>
   ``A lot of people ask me questions about football and
religion,'' he said. ``But the thing is that there are people's
lives at stake. I don't see the problem. Most of you guys, when we
get down in the end zone and pray or get together and pray on the
field, you have a real problem when it comes to that.
<p>
   ``But there are people who write me letters, whose lives have
changed, who have read my book, who are better fathers, better
husbands, better men and women for it. That's what it's all about.
That's why I don't understand when you guys have a problem with it
when people's lives are being changed.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Marva L. Hammons, the head of the sprawling agency
that distributes welfare benefits to nearly a million people in New
York City, is resigning to become head of social services in
Michigan.
<p>
   The departure of Ms. Hammons, one of the few high-ranking black
officials in the Giuliani administration, was not unexpected
because she had been consistently shut out of most important
decisions involving social services and her agency, the Human
Resources Administration.
<p>
   Ms. Hammons was rarely seen at major announcements at City Hall
and was not at Wednesday's news conference when Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani announced her departure and named her replacement, Lilliam
Barrios-Paoli.
<p>
   Ms. Barrios-Paoli is a trusted Giuliani aide who now heads the
Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Ms.
Barrios-Paoli has a reputation as an able administrator who held a
number of management positions in the administrations of Giuliani
and Mayor Edward I. Koch, including a seven-year stint at HRA.
<p>
   Advocates for welfare recipients have sharply criticized Ms.
Hammons, saying she did little to lead an agency that has long been
considered the city's most unmanageable and cumbersome bureaucracy.
<p>
   But in reality, Giuliani and his top aides have directly
overseen many of the agency's new initiatives themselves, including
the city's workfare program, which has put more than 122,000 people
to work cleaning streets and parks in return for their benefits,
and the fingerprint-imaging program to weed out welfare fraud.
<p>
   The mayor congratulated Ms. Hammons on her new appointment
Wednesday and said, ``I want to thank her for the significant
contributions she made to restructuring HRA.''
<p>
   He reserved higher praise for Ms. Barrios-Paoli, saying, ``Her
proven capabilities as a leader, manager and an administrator and
her commitment to city government will be a tremendous asset to the
Human Resources Administration.''
<p>
   Ms. Hammons declined to comment Wednesday but issued a statement
saying she looked forward to her new job and adding, ``I have very
much enjoyed working at HRA and have benefited greatly from the
support I received from Mayor Giuliani and the staff of the
agency.''
<p>
   While Ms. Hammons had receded into the shadows in the Giuliani
administration, John Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan Gov. John
Engler, said, ``She'll have a very high profile in Michigan because
she has the full backing of the governor.''
<p>
   Engler has been in the forefront of welfare reform at a national
level, and has cut the welfare rolls in his own state by more than
140,000, a 46 percent decrease.
<p>
   In her new job, Ms. Hammons will run an agency that administers
cash assistance to about 167,000 people, only a fraction of those
handled by New York's Human Resources Administration. She also will
be taking a pay cut, from $133,000 to $100,000 a year.
<p>
   Ms. Hammons took over HRA in 1994, after managing services for
Denver's 15,000 welfare recipients.
<p>
   During her tenure in New York, the city's social service agency
lost more than 7,500 employees. Much of the staff reduction
occurred when the mayor stripped away the department's
responsibility over child welfare last year and created a new
agency to manage the city's foster-care and child-protection
programs after the highly publicized beating death of 6-year-old
Elisa Izquierdo.
<p>
   The caseload also declined significantly in her tenure. Giuliani
said Wednesday that welfare rolls had been reduced by 220,000 in
the last three years, leaving a caseload of about 940,000.
<p>
   Advocates for the poor said that while some of that decline
could be attributed to an improved economy, the mayor's harsh
policies accounted for the rest of the drop.
<p>
   ``Really bad things happened under her watch, but it's not clear
that she had much to do with any of it,'' said Liz Krueger, of the
Community Food Resource Center, an agency that works with welfare
recipients.
<p>
   Ms. Krueger noted that the new administrator of HRA will have to
deal with enormous upheaval in the next year because of anticipated
federal and state welfare cuts. ``We're coming into a difficult and
extremely volatile period for social services,'' she said. ``We
still have almost two million people living in poverty, and we have
fewer and fewer resources to draw on to meet their basic needs.''
<p>
   Nonprofit organizations that have worked with Ms. Barrios-Paoli
in the 10 months she has run the housing preservation agency
praised her willingness to work with them, but said the department
needed someone with more housing expertise. The mayor has not yet
appointed a successor at the housing agency.

   SECAUCUS, N.J.  &MD;  Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes
sat patiently as they were questioned, photographed and videotaped
by dozens of New York area reporters Wednesday. Welcome to life as
a professional athlete.
<p>
   All three are members of the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, and now all
three  &MD;  the biggest names in women's basketball  &MD;  are members of
the Women's National Basketball Association, which will begin play
in June.
<p>
   The WNBA, which is owned and operated by the National Basketball
League, Wednesday assigned Lobo, Leslie, Swoopes and 13 other
big-name players to the league's eight charter teams.
<p>
   Among them, the 16 players own 11 gold medals, nine National
Collegiate Athletic Association championships and 16 NCAA
all-America awards.
<p>
   The eight teams, which will play in NBA arenas, were assigned
two players each. The allotments were made according to the
individual player's regional ties and with the aim of ensuring an
even distribution of talent and appeal. Lobo played her collegiate
basketball for Connecticut. Leslie, who played for Southern
California, was assigned to Los Angeles. Swoopes, who played for
Texas Tech, was assigned to Houston.
<p>
   The eight teams, which will be operated by the NBA team in that
city, are divided into two conferences. Charlotte, Cleveland,
Houston and New York make up the Eastern Conference, and Los
Angeles, Phoenix, Sacramento and Utah are in the the Western
Conference.
<p>
   ``I'm just looking forward to that first game, to be in front of
fans again and to play,'' Lobo said. ``I'm excited to be playing in
Madison Square Garden; it's one of the most storied arenas in
sports.''
<p>
   The league expects to announce the allotment of another 16
players as early as next month and will hold a draft for college
seniors on April 20.
<p>
   Although New York is without a coach and without a name, the
team already has a good core of players. In addition to the
6-foot-4-inch Lobo, who led UConn to a perfect record and the NCAA
championship in the 1994-95 season, New York was given Teresa
Weatherspoon, a 5-8 guard who has played professionally overseas.
<p>
   ``Rebecca has done more for women's basketball in the region and
in the nation than anybody,'' said Carol Blazejowski, the league
vice president and general manager of the New York club. ``She is a
great young player with tons of potential, and as for Teresa, if I
were still playing she would be my first pick in the backcourt.''
<p>
   Ackerman said the WNBA does not intend to compete with the
American Basketball League, the women's professional league
currently in season. The main reason is that the ABL plays during
the winter and the WNBA will play for two months in the summer.
That the two leagues will have to compete for the same players also
does not concern Ackerman.
<p>
   ``The ABL players are not available to us contractually, but we
are not bothered by that,'' Ackerman said. ``The good thing about
women's basketball is that the talent pool is very deep.''
<p>
   The one major advantage for the new league is the deep pockets
of the NBA.
<p>
   ``We know it will take more than one or two years,'' Ackerman
said. ``This is a long-term investment. We are very focused on the
quality of the product. From the front office to the coaches to the
player, we want to make this first-class.''

 &UR; U.S. SAYS NEW YORK CITY OUTDID SUBURBS IN '96 JOB GROWTH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (bl) &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  One of the tenets of economics in America is that
suburbs create more jobs than cities. Last year, New York City
broke that pattern. For the first time since 1980, the city
outshone its entire suburban encirclement of office parks and edge
cities in making new jobs.
<p>
   Of the 70,000 net new private jobs added in the 27-county region
tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 37,000 were in the
five boroughs of New York City  &MD;  a slim majority, but a majority
nonetheless. Over most of the last 17 years, the city has never
come even close to that. Through the boom years for job creation
from 1979 to 1988, for example, New York accounted for only about
one quarter of the one million new jobs created in the region.
<p>
   The changing balance between the growth rates of city and
suburbs is partly because suburban job creation has slowed. ``The
city is driving the growth,'' said John L. Wieting, the New York
regional commissioner for the statistics bureau. ``That's a break
in the historic pattern.''
<p>
   Wieting and other economists said that one year's worth of
numbers, while providing a mirror to the growth that New Yorkers
have already witnessed in places like Times Square and downtown
Brooklyn, do not necessarily suggest the arrival of a long-term
trend. Nor do they point to a dazzling economic boom.
<p>
   New York City's private job base rose only 1.3 percent in the 12
months ending Nov. 30, better than in 1995 but less than in 1994 or
1993, which were both strong years of economic recovery from the
recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Growth in the suburban
job base in 1996 slowed even more, rising only 0.8 percent. Both
lagged far behind the national growth rate of 2.4 percent in the
period, according to federal figures.
<p>
   What the New York numbers do suggest  &MD;  especially in some major
areas like retailing and manufacturing, where the city has long
been the weakest link in the regional economic chain  &MD;  is a shift,
at least for now, in the local balance of power.
<p>
   More people were working in New York in October in the retail
trade category, for example  &MD;  nearly 571,000 jobs, up 3,000 in 1996
 &MD;  than in any comparable October since 1990, according to figures
from the New York State Department of Labor.
<p>
   Equally profound is that the city did better, or at least less
badly, than the surrounding counties in holding onto manufacturing
jobs. The city lost manufacturing jobs, as it has nearly every year
since the early 1970s.
<p>
   But in the suburbs, where corporate downsizing and restructuring
continued to be a major force at places like AT&AMP;T, New Jersey's
largest private employer, the hemorrhage was worse. Of the 19,000
manufacturing jobs that disappeared, only 5,000 were in the city.
<p>
   Job growth in areas like motion picture production, on the other
hand, which contributed 6,600 new jobs, indicate larger national
and international changes in which the city stands to benefit
uniquely.
<p>
   An increasing number of internationally produced film projects,
in particular, have found New York to be a convenient halfway point
between Hollywood and Europe for both financing and production,
according to Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at
Cowan &AMP; Co. A strengthened Canadian dollar also helped, he said, by
making Toronto  &MD;  one of New York's main competitors for urban movie
sets  &MD;  more expensive.
<p>
   There were also indications of internal changes in the city's
economy.
<p>
   The securities industry, buoyed by the bull market for stocks,
fueled much of the city's job creation. But that growth was mostly
in the businesses that serve the needs of Wall Street, like
printers, legal services and accountants, which added 12,500 jobs  &MD; 
making up the single largest component of the job creation.
<p>
   In what may be a portent of a restructuring industry, job growth
in traditional high-paying jobs like brokers increased less than in
previous booming stock years, partly because of labor-saving
technology, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
<p>
   Another major wrinkle in the city's trajectory is that it
continues to be the center of shrinking public employment, as
state, federal and local governments  &MD;  especially New York City's
government  &MD;  reduce their work forces. The city lost more than
9,000 public jobs in the city in 1996, according to state and
Federal figures.
<p>
   If that public employment deficit is subtracted from the net
growth in private jobs, the city's total growth shrinks to 28,000
jobs, while the rest of the region  &MD;  less affected by government
job cuts  &MD;  still has a growth of 30,000 jobs.
<p>
   Another regional wrinkle indicated in the job creation numbers
is that some parts of the region outside New York are doing better
than others. Long Island, in particular, emerged in 1996 as a
center of suburban job growth, according to Rae D. Rosen, a senior
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
<p>
   Ms. Rosen said that Long Island shares some of the same
strengths as New York, with fewer of the city's weaknesses.
<p>
   ``Long Island doesn't have the drag of government layoffs, and
it's adding more retail employment,'' she said.

<p>
   FORT WORTH, Texas  &MD;  Protesting dairy farmers dumped one day's
worth of milk production in neighboring Johnson County and other
areas Wednesday to end, they said, unfair pricing practices.
<p>
   A final estimate on how much milk was dumped in Texas won't be
available for several weeks. But one preliminary estimate put the
volume at well over 250,000 gallons, or more than 10 percent of
daily production in the Southwest region.
<p>
   ``Support was greater than we expected,'' said Sulphur Springs
dairy farmer Clint Van Vleet, president of the 250-member Texas
Milk Producers Association.
<p>
   The group was one of the protest sponsors, which also included
some dairy farmers in Wisconsin, New Mexico and Louisiana,
according to Texas dairy farmers.
<p>
   Godley dairy farmers in Johnson County, about 25 miles south of
Fort Worth, said they believe that 39 of the 54 milk producers in
the county dumped one day's production.
<p>
   Van Vleet and the protesters have accused the federal government
and cheese makers of engaging in unfair market manipulation.
<p>
   ``We're not asking for something for nothing,'' said Gary Roden,
who is the partner of his father, Larry Roden, in a Godley dairy
farm. ``We want to just be able to pay our bills and make a
living.''
<p>
   The protesting farmers in Johnson County dumped their milk on
their own farms, mostly into waste water lagoons, Gary Roden said.
<p>
   ``We believe our voice was heard,'' said Roden, remarking on
media interest in the dumping.
<p>
   Many dairy farmers are citing a tight cost-price squeeze from
high feed and other production costs and widely fluctuating milk
prices that they say have fallen below their operating costs.
<p>
   They're blaming the wide price variations since the summer on
unfair trading practices, lack of competition among processors,
rising imports and other government and industry practices.
<p>
   Van Vleet said protesters want the federal government to scrap
the current pricing system, based on cheese prices on the National
Cheese Exchange and tied to a formula administered under the
Federal Milk Marketing Order System.
<p>
   He said the government should initiate a pricing system based on
the national average cost of milk production and require that all
milk move from farms to processors under specific volume contracts.
<p>
   Mid-America Dairymen, based in Springfield, Mo., said the volume
that it lost in the protest was insignificant and created no
shortages for processing customers.
<p>
   Texas was the only state where Mid-America members were
confirmed to have dumped milk, said John Wilson, a cooperative
spokesman.
<p>
   ``Yet we certainly empathize with the dairy farmers and their
tough times on the farm,'' Wilson said.
<p>
   Van Vleet said, ``It shows that dairy farmers know they will
have to take strong measures to change this industry.'' 
<p>
   STORY CAN END HERE
<p>
   North Texas' two dominant milk marketing cooperatives reported
modest protest participation among member farmers in the region.
<p>
   Associated Milk Producers, based in Arlington, lost about 20,000
gallons of milk, or four tanker truckloads, said Sonny Pride, a
cooperative spokesman.
<p>
   About half that volume apparently was dumped in Johnson County,
and the other half in Hopkins County near Sulphur Springs, he said.
<p>
   Pride said the amount dumped was not completely known but that
Associated Milk encountered no supply problems Wednesday. Because
member producers announced dumping plans in advance, the
cooperative made adjustments to deliver sufficient milk to fill
orders, he said.
<p>
   ``Of course, we hate to lose the four loads,'' Pride said.
<p>
   That amounted to an estimated $24,000 net loss to producers, he
said.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Trying to hide from a dean who was looking for her
and nine other students who had cut class, a 13-year-old girl fell
two floors down an air shaft at an intermediate school in Jackson
Heights, Queens, Wednesday morning, police officers and school
officials said.
<p>
   The girl, Jennifer Cubillos, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital
Center with multiple cuts to her face and head. She remained in
critical but stable condition Wednesday night in the hospital's
intensive care unit.
<p>
   David Golub, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, said
he did not know how Jennifer fell or why she and the others were in
a room that is off-limits to students and protected by two locked
doors. But students who gathered outside the school, IS 145 after
class Wednesday said the small room behind the auditorium is a
favorite hideout for students who skip class. They also said it is
seldom locked.
<p>
   Police and school officials are investigating the case, which so
far has been described as an accident. Golub said there is no
record that a similar accident has ever happened at any school in
the city.
<p>
   ``It was an unfortunate accident,'' Golub said. ``A very, very
rare type of incident.''
<p>
   The incident happened just before 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, when
teachers noticed that some students were missing from third-period
classes. A dean was notified, and she searched for the students,
who were not all in the same class.
<p>
   The dean went to the small room behind the auditorium.
<p>
   ``She had reasons to believe the students might be there,''
Golub said. ``They had done it in the past.''
<p>
   As she unlocked the door, the dean called out the names of the
students and asked them to come out, Golub said. Startled, the
students panicked and scattered, and Jennifer apparently went into
an adjoining room and fell down the shaft.
<p>
   Nobody saw the girl fall, Golub said. When all the students had
come out and they realized she was missing, they looked down the
shaft and saw her body two floors below, sprawled behind the
boiler.
<p>
   The room that Jennifer fled to is used to hold speakers for the
auditorium, and the door inside it leads to the air shaft, which is
protected by an iron rail that, at its highest point, is two and a
half feet high.
<p>
   Patricia Zedalis, chief executive in the school system's
Division of School Facilities, said both the door that leads to the
utility room and the door for the air shaft are locked at all
times, and students know that they are not supposed to be there.
<p>
   However, students told reporters after school that the doors are
usually open. They also said students often use the room to smoke,
cut classes and hang out after school.
<p>
   They also gave a slightly different interpretation of the events
that conflicted with the account of school officials. Jason Wynter,
14, said that a friend who was in the room had told him that
Jennifer fell because she panicked. When the dean approached her
and asked her to come out, Jennifer, who was holding onto a pole in
the rail, let go.
<p>
   The teen-ager also said that even if the doors are locked,
students find ways to get in.
<p>
   Golub said the investigation has not yet revealed how the
students got into the room. He said that doors were checked two
hours before the accident Wednesday morning and they were locked.
In addition, he said, the dean had to use her key to enter the
room.
<p>
   Another way to get in, Golub said, is to use a crawl space that
leads up to the room. The crawl space can be reached from the floor
below, but to reach it one would need to climb 15 feet.
<p>
   Parents gathered outside the school Wednesday said they trusted
the school and despite the incident, were not concerned for the
safety of the children. ``I think this is a good school,'' said
Mailbia Patino, 40. ``I get a lot of academic support.''
<p>
   The school, also known as Joseph Pulitzer Intermediate School,
has a magnet program for communications and technology and is
located at 33-34 80th Street in Jackson Heights. It was built in
1953, and is one of the most overcrowded schools in District 30,
which is the most crowded district in the city.
<p>
   Teachers who spoke on condition of anonymity said part of the
problem is that there are too many children in school and not
enough supervision. The school has a capacity for 1,055 students,
but this year 1,790 registered for classes.

 &UR; WELD OFFERS HIGHER SPENDING IN BUDGET PLAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL GRUNWALD &QC; 
c.1997 The Boston Globe &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  Buoyed by the economic and fiscal recovery of
Massachusetts, Gov. William F. Weld Wednesday unveiled a
politician's dream budget, featuring deep tax cuts, big spending
hikes and a credibly balanced bottom line.
<p>
   The record-high $18.224 billion budget proposal  &MD;  including
major boosts for education, local aid and human services plus seven
tax cuts  &MD;  completes a remarkable evolution for Weld, who stormed
Beacon Hill as a cost-cutter in 1991. He said Wednesday that, with
unemployment low, revenues high, welfare caseloads down, bond
ratings up and budget-busters in control, the state can now afford
to do more for its residents while taking a smaller bite out of
their incomes.
<p>
   Every year, Weld's budgets have been greeted with criticism and
disdain by Democratic legislators and liberal activists. But this
year, his unusually generous plan won praise from liberals,
conservatives and deficit hawks. Even the Legislature's leaders had
relatively nice things to say about it, although they warned that
Weld's was just the first word in a long process.
<p>
   ``At first blush, this is his best effort yet,'' said House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. ``There have been some pretty dismal
ones in the past ... but it sounds like we may be getting on the
same page.''
<p>
   Of course, not all of Weld's 314-page plan was popular. It did
not add much money for higher education or the troubled state park
system. Housing programs were cut. As the Globe reported Wednesday,
Weld's much-hyped bid to downsize state government was mostly
scrapped. Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham said he was
``baffled'' by a lack of money for local school construction, just
a week after Weld made education the centerpiece of his State of
the State address.
<p>
   In general, though, the budget seemed to have something for
everyone, the kind of please-em-all grab bag Weld could have used
in his ill-fated race against Sen. John F. Kerry. Weld said that
after six years of digging out from fiscal disaster, the state is
finally sound enough to look to the 21st century. His budget boosts
overall spending by only 2.9 percent, less than projected
inflation, but its hikes for education, local aid and human
services are higher.
<p>
   ``Six years ago it would have been impossible to fund these new
initiatives, but we've put our house in order,'' Weld said. ``Now
we're going to be able to do an enormous amount to meet these
social needs, and I think we can still afford all these tax cuts
without breaking a sweat.''
<p>
   The Weld recommendations fully fund K-12 education reform,
boosting state spending by $278 million. They hike spending on
early childhood education by 50 percent. They continue to return
Lottery revenues to cities and towns, sending back $55 million
more. They also include more money for water and sewer rate relief,
community policing and domestic violence prevention. There is even
a proposal to make prisoners help pay the costs of their
incarceration.
<p>
   The big departure for Weld was an extra $384 million for human
services, a 5.5 percent increase first reported in Monday's Globe.
That money will help legal immigrants who will lose benefits under
the federal welfare overhaul, frail elders who want to live at
home, mentally retarded adults who have waited years for services,
and thousands of other vulnerable citizens.
<p>
   ``Generally, there are a lot of good-news stories in this
budget. It's certainly a different budget for Weld,'' Birmingham
said.
<p>
   However, Birmingham (D-Chelsea) said Weld shortchanged higher
education, a charge that dogged the governor throughout his Senate
campaign. And human services advocates, while generally delighted
with the budget, were shocked to hear Weld declare that with this
budget he had addressed every unmet social need in the
commonwealth.
<p>
   ``That is staggering,'' said Betsy Wright of the Massachusetts
Human Services Coalition. ``I guess his defeat in the Senate race
put the poor on his radar screen. But now we need to get homeless
families on his radar screen. Now he needs to know 15,000 people
are waiting for adult education.''
<p>
   As usual, tax cuts are likely to be the most controversial part
of Weld's budget. Finneran (D-Mattapan) and Birmingham were
enthusiastic about raising the income tax deduction for dependent
children from $600 to $1,600. But they were cautious about tax
breaks on telecommunications, life insurers, and unearned income.
They said that after cutting deals for Raytheon and mutual funds,
the state's top priority should be working families, not
corporations or rich individuals.
<p>
   The two leaders scoffed at Weld's suggestion that Democratic
legislators are eager to raise taxes, noting that they approved all
15 of Weld's proposed tax cuts, but they said the price tag for
further cuts could be a problem. When fully phased in, Weld's seven
tax cuts could cost $660 million a year.
<p>
   Weld may also face a struggle over policy recommendations. He
wants the Legislature to lift the cap on charter schools. He wants
to abolish county government. He wants state employees to pay more
of their health costs. He wants to speed up a controversial plan to
replace the state's existing job placement and training system and
with ``one-stop career centers.'' And he wants businesses to pay
less to the unemployment insurance trust fund.
<p>
   But the real struggle may lurk years down the road. Right now,
the economy is humming; prosperity is filling state coffers to
overflowing. But the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation
warns that times are not quite as good as they seem; a recession
could turn the state's black ink red again.
<p>
   ``This budget is fine, but I'm worried about this sentiment I
hear that the good old days have returned,'' said Michael Widmer,
director of the foundation. ``It's not really backed up by the
numbers. We can definitely afford this now, but the question is
what will happen down the road.''
<p>
   In his budget, Weld proposed at least three new state programs:
one bolstering food pantries, one subsidizing health care for legal
immigrants, and one to bail out school districts facing unexpected
increases in student population. The Legislature is expected to
propose at least one more, a home visiting program for at-risk
parents.

<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  Technology-based industries are responsible for
one-third of all jobs in Washington state and now form a larger
sector than natural resource industries such as agriculture and
forest products, according to a new study by two University of
Washington geographers.
<p>
   Prepared for the Technology Alliance, a non-profit group of
technology business leaders and heads of research institutions, the
study is the first broad-based look at the economic importance of
technology-intensive businesses in Washington.
<p>
   It could become an important point of reference in debates over
state policies regarding education, business regulation and taxes,
research done at state institutions, even roads and bridges.
<p>
   ``It clarifies a phenomenon that's important for us who live in
Washington state to be aware of  &MD;  that we've got an important and
growing sector which needs to be nurtured,'' said attorney William
Gates, chairman of the alliance and father of Microsoft co-founder
Bill Gates.
<p>
   Geography professor Bill Beyers, the study's lead author, called
it ``another piece of evidence'' about the broad changes occurring
in the state's economy.
<p>
   ``We've evolved from a state where natural resource industries
were our economic heart into a more diversified economy,'' Beyers
said. ``Today these parts of our economy are growing fast, and
these are good-paying jobs  &MD;  they're the kind of jobs we talk about
wanting to create.''
<p>
   In the study, Beyers and co-author David Lindahl defined
technology-based industries as those in which at least 10 percent
of employment is related to research and development.
<p>
   They based their categories on Standard Industrial
Classification Codes and National Science Foundation occupation
definitions, to make them comparable across the country and easier
to update in the future.
<p>
   So defined, the technology-based category includes not just the
well-known high-tech categories such as engineering services,
computer services and software but less-obvious fields such as
management and public relations, agricultural chemicals, motor
vehicles and petroleum refining that also have a large research and
development component.
<p>
   It also includes the aerospace industry, which for all its
reliance on steel and aluminum is also technology intensive. More
than 30 percent of its employees are involved in research and
development.
<p>
   Direct employment in technology-based industries in Washington
totals 230,947, the study found. But each of those jobs generates
an average of 2.37 more jobs in services, trade and other
industries, for a total of 778,300 jobs that result directly and
indirectly from technology-based industries.
<p>
   Washington ranks sixth in its relative concentration of those
industries, after the District of Columbia, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, California and Michigan, the study found.
<p>
   Technology-based industries generate $41.8 billion in direct
sales revenue and $74.2 billion when indirect sales are counted.
Direct labor income totals $12 billion, while indirect labor income
adds $13.8 billion more.
<p>
   They contribute disproportionately to the state's economy, the
study found, since 76 percent of their sales are made out of state,
compared to an average of 40 percent for the economy as a whole.
<p>
   And they have grown dramatically over the last two decades, from
93,000 private-sector jobs in 1974 to 220,000 in 1995, plus another
11,000 in the public sector.
<p>
   To a great extent, Gates said, such growth occurs ``inertially''
as businesses develop sophistication and know-how that spins off
into separate ventures  &MD;  a process demonstrated time and again at
the company founded by his son's Redmond-based Microsoft.
<p>
   ``But you need more than that,'' the elder Gates said. ``You
need the external influences  &MD;  things like a first-class
university, first-class research institutions. You need to be sure
you've got the kind of place where professional people want to come
and live.''
<p>
   The University of Washington has been responsible for dozens of
new businesses over the years, many of which have been started
``essentially by accident,'' he said. Now it is becoming more
organized and direct in its efforts to turn laboratory work into
commercial ventures.
<p>
   ``I think that has enormous promise,'' he said. ``When you look
at what's happened by accident, it can be pretty exciting thinking
what might happen if somebody begins to focus deliberate effort on
those kinds of developments.''
<p>
   Several other technology-industry spokesmen echoed Gates' views,
saying the study points up the critical role of the state's
education system in providing both qualified workers and research
advances with commercial potential.
<p>
   ``The biggest issue is really education,'' said Tom Ranken,
executive director of the Washington Biotechnology and Biomedical
Association.
<p>
   ``It was just a few years ago when very few people thought of a
research university as having any impact on pushing the economy
forward . . . they thought of the university as a place to get
qualified workers.
<p>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in the last few years in
recognizing how important research and development, and
university-based resarch, are in developing the economy,'' Ranken
said. ``If we continue (on that track), we'll keep making
progress.''
<p>
   According to Kathy Wilcox, president of the Washington Software
and Digital Media Alliance, the study also is of great value in
promoting Washington state elsewhere in the country.
<p>
   ``When we want to attract businesses . . . we have to get the
rest of the world to know what we have here,'' Wilcox said. The
study allows an ``apples and apples comparison'' that shows ``how
strong we are vis-a-vis other areas of the country.''
<p>
   It also provides ammunition in efforts to make sure legislators
understand the importance of technology-based industries to the
economy, she said.
<p>
   That, in turn, will aid efforts to make sure the state's
research institutions receive the support they need and that the
state's tax and regulatory environment is consistent and fair, she
said.
<p>
   ``It takes everyone,'' she said, ``to embrace that vision and
work cooperatively to make sure the stage is set to continue this
phenomenal growth.
<p>
   ``Absolutely everybody will benefit,'' not just those directly
employed, she said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Over the last 15 years, a self-made businessman from
New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to hospitals,
universities and other beneficiaries  &MD;  but has done it in such
absolute secrecy that most recipients never learned who their
benefactor was.
<p>
   The donor, Charles Feeney, who made his fortune with a string of
duty-free airport shops, covered his tracks so well that business
magazines for years have estimated his net worth in the billions,
not realizing that he had transferred most of his assets to his two
charitable foundations and is actually worth less than $5 million.
<p>
   After years of secrecy, Feeney agreed this week to discuss his
gifts because the duty-free empire was sold this month to the
company that makes Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne, and a lawsuit over the
sale would have revealed his anonymous donations.
<p>
   Feeney  &MD;  who has strong ties to Ireland and has made many gifts
there, including personal donations to Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing  &MD;  was matter-of-fact in describing why he had given
away his fortune. ``I simply decided I had enough money,'' he said.
``It doesn't drive my life. I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind
of guy.''
<p>
   While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of,
the scope and style of Feeney's giving, and his passion for total
secrecy, are rare, according to independent experts on
philanthropy. ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' said
Thomas Troyer, a senior partner in the law firm of Caplin &AMP;
Drysdale in Washington, who specializes in philanthropic law.
<p>
   Harvey Dale, a New York University tax law professor and
president of Feeney's Atlantic Foundation, who has helped Feeney
orchestrate his gifts since 1982, said: ``He doesn't own a house.
He doesn't own a car. He flies economy. And I think his watch cost
about $15.''
<p>
   It was Dale who helped Feeney set up his foundations, which like
his Duty Free Shoppes chain are based in Bermuda, thus avoiding the
disclosure requirements of private foundations in the United
States.
<p>
   From the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to Portland
State University in Oregon, none of the American recipients of
Feeney's largesse knew who their benefactor was. Grants were paid
by cashier's check to conceal the source. In fact, the
beneficiaries never realized that they owed their thanks to a
single giver  &MD;  they were told that the money came from several
generous ``clients'' who wished to remain anonymous.
<p>
   Few of the recipients had ever even met Dale or Joel Fleishman,
the president of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which actually
gave away the money on behalf of Feeney's two foundations, the
Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust.
<p>
   Dr. Robert Butler of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine said he
met Feeney in 1990 while making a proposal for funding to an
advisory board that reviewed grant proposals.
<p>
   ``I had no idea that he was the main supporter of what I call
the Anonymous Foundation,'' Butler said, adding that the grant was
made, starting the International Longevity Center at the New York
Academy of Medicine. ``Anonymous giving, giving that is not
dependent on ego, is just really rare.''
<p>
   Feeney said that by giving anonymously, he could go about his
life unhampered by pitches for donations. ``There are people who
want, and rightly deserve, recognition for giving, but in our case
it wasn't important,'' he said.
<p>
   In 1984, when Feeney gave his 38.75 percent interest in the Duty
Free Shoppes chain to the two foundations, even his partner, Robert
Miller, was not told. Now, proceeds from the sale of the chain
earlier this month, along with his other business assets, a total
of $3.5 billion, are owned by the foundations.
<p>
   Feeney's charitable enterprise would rank as the nation's
fourth-largest grant-making foundation if it were based in the
United States, yet the two groups operate with tiny staffs, just 20
professionals in the United States and overseas.
<p>
   Duty-Free Shoppes has sales of more than $3 billion annually,
mostly in liquors and luxury goods, more than the combined sales of
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman-Marcus.
<p>
   The foundation's largest single grant was $30 million, according
to Dale, who refused to identify the recipient on grounds that the
information might discourage other donors from supporting it. ``One
reason for keeping gifts anonymous is to avoid what we call this
`crowding out' effect,'' Dale said.
<p>
   Recipients were effusive in their praise for their anonymous
donor's style of giving and what it had enabled them to do. ``This
is operational support, the most valuable kind of assistance,''
said William Nelsen, president of the Citizens' Scholarship
Foundation of America, in St. Peter, Minnesota, which has received
support since 1984, one of the oldest recipients.
<p>
   Nelson said that the group, which mobilizes community groups to
raise money for college student aid, was able to significantly
expand its ``Dollars for Scholars'' program to reach 770 chapters
throughout the country, thanks in large part to Atlantic money,
which he said was more than a million dollars.

<p>
   ``As an organization, we've more than quadrupled in size since
getting support from this anonymous donor,'' Nelsen said.
<p>
   At the College Board, which administers scholastic assessment
tests for college-bound high school seniors, the mystery donor was
always referred to by the name ``anonymous,'' said Dr. Donald
Stewart, president of the College Board.
<p>
   ``Anonymous was most interested in results,'' Stewart said. The
anonymous donor supported ``long-term research to establish whether
we are right, which is crucial for the project's credibility and in
assessing whether schools should adopt the same approach,'' he
said.
<p>
   Several recipients said that once they were invited to apply for
funds their plans were closely examined. ``Ed McMahon did not knock
on my door,'' said Chuck Supple, president of Public Allies, which
places young people in internships with nonprofit organizations.
``These guys really kick the tires.''
<p>
   Judith Ramaley, president of Portland State University called
her first foundation grant last year her ``catalyst,'' financing of
less than one million dollars that enabled the school to publicize
its innovative new curriculum and links to the community, which
have now drawn national attention and the support of other
foundations. ``We were out of cash when they came along,'' she
said. ``They were the trail mix at that key moment on our very
steep hiking path,'' she said.
<p>
   Feeney's contributions in Ireland account for more than half of
Atlantic's international giving and about one-quarter of overall
giving. In addition to Ireland, the foundation supports projects in
South Africa, the former Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, Israel and
Jordan.
<p>
   There was less secrecy surrounding Feeney's activities in
Ireland. Several Irish university presidents and other
beneficiaries said they had met Feeney several times; they also
knew, they added, that he had a connection to the Atlantic
foundations.
<p>
   Feeney also said he had given substantial personal donations  &MD; 
not from the Atlantic foundations  &MD;  to the Washington office of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which
in 1994 entered into a cease fire with the British that broke down
last February. Public records show that Feeney has contributed some
$280,000  &MD;  making him the group's single largest American donor.
<p>
   Feeney said that his gifts to Sinn Fein had been carefully
monitored to insure that they supported only nonviolent activities,
and that he had continued supporting the Washington office despite
the cease-fire's collapse last February, ``because I'm hopeful that
it will be renewed.''
<p>
   The Atlantic Foundation's board of directors includes several
prominent personalities in the philanthropic and educational
establishment  &MD;  among them, Elizabeth McCormack, a senior adviser
on charitable giving to members of the Rockefeller family and vice
chairman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation;
Frank Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University, Michael
Sovern, president of the Shubert Foundation and president emeritus
of Columbia University, and Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., an attorney
and chairman of the Natural Resources Defense Council. None of them
had disclosed their connection with the Atlantic groups publicly,
nor did they ever discuss Feeney's giving with peers or even their
families, they said in interviews this week.
<p>
   ``This organization has operated on a need-to-know basis,''
Fleishman said.
<p>
   Most recipients  &MD;  a partial list of which was provided by APS  &MD; 
said their only contact was with program officers of the APS, the
for-profit group that selects the grantees, gives out the money,
and evaluates the outcome of what has been given away.
<p>
   Rhodes, the foundation board member and former president of
Cornell, said that the foundation was careful not to use money to
tell recipients what to do or how to do it. ``The danger with
foundations is that sometimes the staff and board come to feel that
they own the money,'' Rhodes said, ``and they micromanage. We have
a motto: noses in, fingers out.''
<p>
   Dale said of the relationship to grant recipients: ``We are
voyeurs. We let good people do good things. We oversee, but we
don't interfere.''
<p>
   And despite his decision finally to disclose his donations,
Feeney is still trying to keep a low profile. He declined this week
to be photographed.

 &UR; VERMEIL TARGETS THREE ON CHIEFS STAFF &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By KENT PULLIAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC;  KANSAS CITY, Mo.  &MD;  New St. Louis Rams
coach Dick Vermeil targeted three Chiefs staff members Wednesday as
potential additions to his staff.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   During a telephone news conference with reporters at the Super
Bowl, Vermeil said he would like to hire Lynn Stiles, the Chiefs'
vice president of player personnel, and talk with linebackers coach
John Bunting and former defensive-line coach Carl Hairston.
<p>
   Vermeil, who was officially hired Tuesday, indicated that Stiles
would be his top aide. He was less clear about the positions he
would talk to the two others about  &MD;  though Bunting could be a
candidate as the Rams' defensive coordinator.
<p>
   ``I have talked about bringing Lynn with me as an assistant to
me in my responsibilities,'' Vermeil said. ``I think he will be
coming. I think he is coming.''
<p>
   Carl Peterson, Chiefs president//general manager, said Vermeil
asked permission to talk with Stiles. Hairston was not going to be
retained on the Chiefs' staff. Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer is
interested in retaining Bunting, but his contract expires in
February.
<p>
   ``He (Vermeil) is resurrecting the Philadelphia connection,''
Peterson said, laughing. ``He's moving fast.''
<p>
   Peterson said he would not like to lose Stiles because ``the guy
has the draft in his head right now.'' But if Vermeil offers Stiles
a position that entails more responsibilities than he currently
holds, the league would consider that an advancement, and even
though he is under contract for one more year, he could move.
<p>
   ``All that he (Vermeil) has done is ask for permission to talk
to the guy,'' Peterson said. ``Without any question losing him
before the draft would be difficult. But the other side of it is if
it is something more than a lateral move, you have to look at the
opportunity for career advancement potential for him.''
<p>
   Stiles, reached Wednesday at the Chiefs' offices, said he had
talked with Vermeil twice since Vermeil took the Rams' job. He said
both conversations were brief and more congratulatory in nature.
<p>
   ``My first and foremost obligation is to the Chiefs,'' Stiles
said. ``Unless Carl feels comfortable in me making a move, that's
where I am, and that's what I am.''
<p>
   Stiles was assistant head coach and defensive coordinator for
Vermeil at UCLA in 1974-75. After a two-year stint as head coach at
San Jose State, Stiles rejoined Vermeil with the Eagles as
administrative assistant with coaching responsibilities for the
tight ends and special teams in 1979.
<p>
   In 1982 Stiles became the Eagles' director of player personnel,
replacing Peterson.
<p>
   Like Stiles, Bunting and Hairston both have histories with
Vermeil with the Eagles. Bunting was a starting linebacker for the
Eagles when Vermeil arrived in 1976. Hairston was in Vermeil's
first Eagles draft class in 1976.
<p>
   Bunting is among the candidates Vermeil is considering as a
possible defensive coordinator. Some in the NFL believe Bunting has
head coaching potential.
<p>
   Former Saints coach Jim Mora declined an offer earlier this week
to be the Rams' defensive coordinator//assistant head coach. Mora
was a Rams head coaching candidate.
<p>
   Vermeil, who was in Philadelphia for the conference call, said
he would return to St. Louis today. He planned to interview several
members of the Rams' previous staff. He said he hoped to have his
whole staff in place by today or Friday.
<p>
   Vermeil already has hired Jerry Rhome as his offensive
coordinator, Dick Coury as his receivers coach and Frank Gansz, a
former Chiefs head coach, as his special-teams coach.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  The newest 99-cent World store had been in business
only half an hour. But already the line of customers in the eastern
Bronx shop snaked back 75 feet from the cash register, past the
hair extensions, the vanilla wafers and the witch hazel, all
selling for less than a dollar.
<p>
   The store was immaculate, smelling of peach candles and fabric
softener and stuffed with orderly displays of merchandise  &MD;  3,000
square feet of cheap goods. But there were a few glitches: A clerk
could not seem to attach the vinyl ``Grand Opening'' sign to the
awning outside and one of the two cash registers was broken.
<p>
   And then the telephone began to ring. ``Hello, 99!'' the store
manager, Shoaib Rangoonwala, shouted frantically into the phone, as
he rang up a sale of aluminum foil, two boxes for 99 cents. He
relaxed when he spotted his cousin, from the 99-cent World in
Harlem, arriving with a replacement cash register.
<p>
   Rangoonwala, a Pakistani immigrant, recently gave up taxi
driving to manage 99-cent World's seventh store, which opened two
weeks ago at 1611 Westchester Ave., and to join his friends and
relatives in their growing enterprise. As the newest 99-cent World
opened, another extended Pakistani family was plotting the
expansion of 99-cent Dream, with a 10th store in the city scheduled
to open in a few weeks.
<p>
   But move over Dream, move over World: 99-cent ity, another
Pakistani-owned discount chain, is about to open its 19th and 20th
stores.
<p>
   Seizing on the ``one price'' mania that burst onto the retailing
scene in the early 1990s, the three extended families have opened
34 stores, most in the city, a few in New Jersey, in the last five
years, adding six to their network in the last two months.
<p>
   ``I looked around and I saw that everybody was doing the grocery
store,'' said Mohammed Aslam, one of about 10 owners of 99-cent
Dream, who also drove a cab before opening the first store five
years ago. ``I said, `Let's go for something else.' ''
<p>
   Buoyed by a surge of immigration to the city in the 1990s,
newcomers are going into business at a furious pace, city officials
and urban researchers say, creating new employment niches for
themselves by bringing friends and relatives with them. Although no
exact figures are available, the emergence of new concentrations in
the immigrant work force is perhaps most striking in small
retailing, which has long served as a catalyst for ethnic mobility.
<p>
   ``New York still has an older type of retail structure because,
for the most part, it has been less dominated by large chains than
other cities,'' said Roger Waldinger, a professor of sociology at
the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied
employment patterns of New York's ethnic groups. ``The competitive
environment is pretty favorable for the small entrepreneur, and one
of the effects of immigration is to kind of break up the market.''
<p>
   As the Italians and Jews who once dominated small retailing in
New York have moved into larger-scale endeavors, Greeks, Koreans,
Chinese, Arabs, Israelis, Dominicans, Russians and, increasingly,
Pakistanis and other south Asians have taken their places. Like
their predecessors, clusters of those immigrants embarked on new
enterprises as they became established in the city, carving up the
retail market and creating ethnic enclaves.
<p>
   That is happening now for the Pakistani immigrants, who number
about 25,000 in the city, although the estimate is considered low
because it does not account for illegal immigration or migration
from other parts of the country.
<p>
   It might be too early to conclude that the Pakistani proprietors
have cornered the New York City market on 99-cent stores, but they
control what appears to be the city's only multistore network of
99-cent discounters, which sell everything from air fresheners to
zwiebacks.
<p>
   Statistics on the number of 99-cent stores, still a sliver of
the city's retail market, are not available. But city officials and
retail analysts say one-price stores, including those selling all
items for less than $10, have spread through New York in the last
decade. They are particularly prevalent in low-income
neighborhoods, where the turnover of small businesses is high,
rents are relatively low and storefront vacancies abound.
<p>
   ``The stores are filling a huge gap in the inner city,'' said
Mitchell Moss, director of the urban research center at New York
University.
<p>
   Moss said the disappearance in the last two decades of hardware
stores and low-end department store chains like Alexander's and
E.J. Korvette's from many neighborhoods had created a demand for
the eclectic discount stores. And he suggested that the stores may
be particularly attractive to New Yorkers.
<p>
   ``The 99-cent people rely on New Yorkers' willingness to buy
anything at a bargain,'' Moss said. Using the Yiddish term for
junk, he added, ``New York is built on chozzerai.''

   The one-price stores buy surplus merchandise from overstocked or
bankrupt manufacturers and wholesale retailers, and resell the
goods for what typically amounts to a profit of pennies on the
dollar.
<p>
   Large regional one-price chains like Dollar Tree Stores expanded
rapidly in the early 1990s, although they never moved into the New
York City market. But the larger regional and national chains have
generally not done well, retail analysts said. Because of
overexpansion, competition from individual stores and an inability
to pay high rents at suburban malls, one of the six largest chains,
Everything's A Dollar, has gone out of business, and another, All
For A Dollar, has sought bankruptcy protection in the last two
years, according to Discount Store News, an industry trade
publication.
<p>
   In New York, the three Pakistani-owned chains, which have
targeted working-class neighborhoods in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn
and the Bronx, are not franchised. Typically, groups of friends and
relatives contribute their savings to open a store, several owners
said.
<p>
   The top occupations for Pakistani immigrants listed in the 1990
census were taxi driver, truck driver and construction worker.
While there is anecdotal evidence that an increasing number of
Pakistani immigrants are moving into retailing, the trend is too
recent to show up in officials statistics.
<p>
   Marine Midland Bank, which three years ago started a loan
program to attract Pakistani, Indian and Sri Lankan borrowers,
reported that in the last six months, loan applications made by
small retailers had increased significantly in that group. And
Pakistanis themselves say they have observed that many of their
fellow immigrants, who have now worked in the city long enough to
amass some capital, are leaving cab driving and construction for
other pursuits.
<p>
   Describing a path typical of many immigrant entrepreneurs,
Asghar Choudhri, an accountant who lives in the Midwood section of
Brooklyn, which has largest concentration of Pakistani immigrants,
and is chairman the Pakistani-American Merchants Association of
Coney Island Avenue said: ``Usually two or three brothers or
cousins live together, work separately and save their money to open
a store together.''
<p>
   Then, as the businesses grow, the ethnic grapevine transmits
word of opportunity, immigrants recruit their friends and relatives
and a niche begins to form.
<p>
   Aslam, the owner of 99-cent Dream, who now lives in New Jersey,
came to New York from the Pakistani city of Karachi in 1985, he
said. Initially taking a job as a gas station attendant, he heard
from his friends that there was work in the taxi business. He met
other Pakistanis interested in breaking into retail and contributed
his earnings  &MD;  and money from the sale of his house in Karachi  &MD;  to
an investment pool.
<p>
   He said that 10 to 15 friends and relatives, most of them
originally from Karachi, each contributed $1,500 to $2,000 to the
discount store pool. The initial investment required to open a
store, he said, is $50,000 to $60,000.
<p>
   Pakistani proprietors from all three 99-cent chains said they
planned to expand in the coming months. But some owners said they
were worried that the New York City retail market, which is
undergoing a radical change as superstores like Kmart, Price CostCo
and Home Depot move in, would not support many more 99-cent stores.
<p>
   ``We prefer to work for ourselves,'' Aslam, of 99-cent Dream,
said. ``But I am a little tired. There is a lot of competition, a
lot of expenses.''
<p>
   He paused for a few minutes to think, and then added:
``Ninety-nine is OK for now. But there may be something else for us
out there.''

   JERSEY CITY, N.J.  &MD;  Let the record show that in the middle of
New York's tax-free shopping week, even as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
was urging all good citizens of the metropolis to ``send a message
to Albany'' and shop like they've never shopped before, Myra O.
Sugarman and Dot Singer, Manhattanites both, were deep in the racks
of Anne Klein separates at Filene's Basement in the Newport Center
Mall, which is to say, in New Jersey.
<p>
   ``Oh, so what?'' Ms. Sugarman said. She was nearly embedded in a
crush of blue knit jackets as she struggled vainly to find a size
10 petite.
<p>
   ``Yeah, whaddatheygonnado?'' Ms. Singer said. ``Arrest us?''
<p>
   You never know, considering that the city has added the crime of
taking up more than one seat on the subway to its list of
quality-of-life offenses. (By law, New Yorkers who shop out of
state and bring the goods back home are supposed to pay New York
the difference in sales tax.) And the police would meet their
entire month's quota for quality-of-life tickets if they fined
people for skewing the state's experiment in tax-free clothes
shopping.
<p>
   For here at Newport Center, a Garden State-variety mall by the
Holland Tunnel, Ms. Sugarman and Ms. Singer were far from the only
New Yorkers shopping this crucial week when New York City wants to
show Albany that dropping the sales tax would keep shoppers from
straying across the border. At least the women had an excuse: They
were visiting a friend in the Jersey City Financial Center and had
stopped at the mall on the way home.
<p>
   Doug T. Walker, who lives in New York City's East Village, was
discovered looking at one-pocket T-shirts at the mall Gap. Yes, he
said, sheepishly, there is a Gap around the corner from his
apartment. ``I was just looking,'' he said, gingerly fingering a
black leather belt. He had popped in as he waited to meet his
brother, who lives in Jersey City, he said.
<p>
   ``I came to help buy a 40th-anniversary present for my
parents,'' he said. ``How's that for an excuse?''
<p>
   Better than others. Newport Center, about a 15-minute ride from
Manhattan on the PATH train, counts 25 percent of its customers
from New York City at any given time. (Except Christmas, when cars
pouring in from the Holland Tunnel jam the mall parking garages for
hours.) The lack of a sales tax on clothes and shoes, and only a 3
percent sales tax on other items is the major reason New Yorkers
say they come here. But getting relief from that 8.25 percent tax
hasn't kept these New Yorkers home. The percentage of New Yorkers
at Newport Center remained steady over the weekend, when the mall
had a ``sidewalk sale.''
<p>
   Some stores posted double-digit gains in sales over the same
week last year, said Sarah Liddle, the Newport Center marketing
director. ``It seems the tax-free week hasn't affected us,'' she
said. ``Some of the stores reporting great weekends are apparel
related.''
<p>
   What this says about New York's tax-free shopping experiment is
anyone's guess, especially since Giuliani is crowing over a
shopping frenzy he says has far exceeded expectations.
<p>
   But perhaps for those New Yorkers who have gotten into the mall
habit, the lack of a tax on clothing just can't compete with the
lulling comfort of a climate-controlled Main Street where no one
bumps into you. Especially when Stern's has a sale.
<p>
   ``I find it easy to come here,'' said Sylvia Barash, who lives
in New York City's Greenwich Village. She has taken the PATH to
Newport about half a dozen times, and as an older person she
considers the trip a risk-free adventure in no-pressure shopping.
``It's safe, I think, and pleasant.''
<p>
   Newport Center is an Everymall. It is neither fancy nor
downscale. (The anchors are Stern's, Sears and JC Penney.) It is
neither small nor enormous. (You can walk from one end to the other
in a few minutes, if you don't stop.) It is, in other words, easy
to handle. Which makes it precisely the kind of place New York
business owners worry about.
<p>
   ``There's an advantage to shopping like this, or else why would
so many people do it?'' said Ms. Sugarman, who grew up in Manhattan
(``a long time ago'') and has never lived anywhere else for very
long. ``I like malls. I used to shop Herald Square. Now it's for
the birds. Too crowded.''
<p>
   By the way, she added: ``Put this down: If the tax gets cut,
what are we going to have to do to make up the difference?''
<p>
   ``You got to pay the piper somehow.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  Of all the politicians involved in arranging the
agreement last week to pass legislation providing women longer
hospital stays after mastectomies, the lawmaker most responsible is
a man who has no official role in the state government and in fact
rarely ventures this far north: U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
<p>
   By all accounts, New York's junior U.S. senator persuaded
legislative leaders from both parties to work out a deal, providing
yet another example of how D'Amato uses his influence over the
state's political leaders to push issues important to him through
the Legislature.
<p>
   D'Amato's attention to this back-home legislation came as
surveys suggested that his popularity is sagging, particularly
among women. A recent poll found that his approval rating was 41
percent among men and 25 percent among women.
<p>
   Here in Albany, lawmakers in both parties said they thought they
would have passed a mastectomy bill this year, even if D'Amato had
not got involved. But by prodding them along early this month, he
made sure that he would get some of the credit for brokering a deal
on an issue that is of great importance to women, particularly on
Long Island, his political base.
<p>
   The rate of breast cancer on Long Island is among the highest in
the country. That has spawned an emotional debate over whether the
cause of the disease there could be traced to some problem in the
soil, water or air. The high incidence of breast cancer has also
led survivors to organize powerful groups intended to force elected
officials to take action.
<p>
   D'Amato and his aides wasted little time arranging a news
conference last Thursday at which he appeared with Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and Senate majority leader Joseph
Bruno, a Republican, to announce that the state's leaders had
agreed on a mastectomy bill.
<p>
   The D'Amato camp handled virtually all the details for the
event. They chose the the date and the site. They drew up a guest
list that included a host of women's groups, several from Long
Island. They issued the press releases announcing the agreement on
D'Amato's Senate letterhead.
<p>
   ``They handled the whole bit,'' said Patricia Lynch, a
spokeswoman for Silver, who is usually in charge of arranging the
speaker's public appearances. ``I think that it was very unique.
But the speaker felt the issue was very important, and that it was
time to put aside partisan differences.''
<p>
   This is not the first time that D'Amato has seized on an issue
in Albany to promote his own political fortunes or those of the
state Republican Party.
<p>
   Last year, the Legislature unanimously approved a bill to set up
a registry to track the use of pesticides, acting only after
D'Amato used his influence to persuade Republican state senators to
support the measure.
<p>
   The registry is intended to help scientists establish links
between pesticides and disease, a major issue on Long Island.
Women's groups like the Huntington Breast Cancer Action Coalition
and 1 in 9 have speculated that extensive spraying of agricultural
chemicals might be a factor in the high rates of breast cancer.
<p>
   But until D'Amato intervened, the Republicans who control the
Senate opposed the registry. They faced pressure from agricultural
lobbyists, who feared that people with cancer and other diseases
would use the information to sue farmers.
<p>
   ``I think he's trying to address not only a low approval rating
but also a wide gender gap,'' said Lee Miringoff, the director of
the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie. ``And he's
using his old formula of being a go-to guy who gets things
accomplished. He's getting back to his role as Senator Pothole,
which he has been drifting away from.''
<p>
   But D'Amato's attempts to latch onto popular state issues have
sometimes backfired. Last year, he upset environmentalists and
aides to Gov. George Pataki, his political protege, last year when
he began running television ads featuring himself as a spokesman
for a $1.7 billion bond act to clean up the environment, which the
governor proposed.
<p>
   Many of the bond act's supporters complained that D'Amato's
unpopularity among voters would end up hurting the measure's
chances of approval. In the end, though, voters approved it
overwhelmingly.
<p>
   D'Amato's latest foray into Albany politics started nearly two
weeks ago, when by his own account he phoned Silver and Bruno to
propose a bill that would allow mastectomy patients to stay in the
hospital as long as they and their doctors felt was necessary.
<p>
   D'Amato said he decided to approach legislative leaders here
because he believed that a similar bill he proposed in Washington
would take months to pass. As he recalled it, it didn't take much
persuading to get Bruno and Silver on board. ``They said,
`terrific,' '' he recalled.
<p>
   Then, a D'Amato aide came to Albany to help leaders hammer out
the details of the legislation. The agreement was worked out in
about 10 days, giving potential opponents little time to mobilize a
lobbying campaign.
<p>
   With that done, D'Amato's public relations operation went to
work, issuing a press release on the day of the news conference. In
it, Silver and Bruno thanked the senator for his role. ``I salute
Senator D'Amato for his leadership on this issue,'' Bruno said.
<p>
   Silver provided a slight variation, saying: ``I want to thank
Senator D'Amato for his leadership on this important issue.''

<p>
   Los Angeles, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. judge approved a
settlement in a class-action lawsuit against Connecticut General
Life Insurance, a unit of the Philadelphia-based insurer Cigna
Corp., lawyers for policyholders said.
<p>
   Federal District Court Judge Harry L. Hupp in Los Angeles
approved the settlement on Jan. 13. Plaintiffs claimed the insurer
overcharged and misled them in sales of insurance policies. Cigna
didn't admit wrongdoing in the settlement. A lawyer for the
plaintiffs and a representative of the company disagreed on how
much the settlement could cost. Cigna said it expects to pay out a
maximum of $35 million.
<p>
   Mark Rifkin, an Ardmore, Pennsylvania, attorney representing
plaintiffs, said Cigna could be forced to pay $200 million or more.
``There is absolutely no upward limit to what this could cost the
company,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Any settlement amount at this point is purely speculative,''
because plaintiffs are only now beginning to file for claims under
a dispute-resolution process set up by the settlement, said Cigna
spokesman Ken Ferraro.
<p>
   ``This will not have a material effect on earnings of Cigna or
the earnings of Connecticut General,'' Ferraro said. Cigna stock
closed up 1 5/8 at an a record 151 5/8 in trading of 243,000
shares.
<p>
   Policyholders, beneficiaries and those who paid for coverage
will have until July 12 to submit claims. Most won't receive a cash
settlement, Ferraro said. ``For the vast majority of the people,
we're making a slight adjustment over the lifetime of the policy,''
he said.
<p>
   The case is the result of two lawsuits, one charging that
Connecticut General agents misled customers by promising premiums
would vanish after a certain term and accusing the company of
trying to pass on to policyholders the effects of a 1990 U.S. tax
increase.
<p>
   The settlement on charges of misleading customers will likely
cost the company more per claim than the tax part of the case,
albeit for far fewer claims, Ferraro said.
<p>
   Claims involving the tax, known as the deferred acquisition tax,
will probably account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of
the potential claims in the combined class action lawsuit, Ferraro
said. Costs of compensating such customers will be lower, Ferraro
added.
<p>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs estimated there could be as many as
128,000 individual claims.

   The seven-inch, thin-crust pizzas range from relatively lean
vegetarian versions to pepperoni-and-cheese extravaganzas, but most
of them, said the government, had far more fat than the law allows
in a food calling itself low-fat.
<p>
   The FTC concluded the Boston-based chain of 155 restaurants
misled customers two years ago when it ran a two-week print and
television advertising campaign in which the Thinzettas were called
``low-fat.''
<p>
   The settlement doesn't mean that you can't enjoy pizza  &MD;  just
that it's hard to make pizzas that meet the very strict federal
definition of low-fat, with less than 3 grams of fat in a 100-gram
serving (about 3 1/2 ounces).
<p>
   David Schardt, an associate nutritionist with the Center for
Science in the Public Interest in Washington, said most pizzas with
real cheese would flunk the test. But he said that doesn't mean one
or two slices of pizza can't be a healthful meal.
<p>
   Most Americans, though, boost the fat content by piling on meat
toppings and extra cheese, as well as eating too many slices,
Schardt said.
<p>
   The FTC said Wednesday's settlement, which involved no fines or
other disciplinary actions, was its first enforcement action
involving false nutrient claims by a restaurant chain.
<p>
   ``Whether selecting low-fat foods at the grocery store or
restaurants, consumers expect nutrient content claims for products
to be true,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of
consumer protection.
<p>
   Uno Restaurant Corp. president and chief executive officer Craig
Miller said the ads ran for only a two-week period and did not mean
to imply that all eight Thinzettas pizzas were low fat.
Nevertheless, Miller said, the wording was not as precise as it
should have been.
<p>
   ``We don't fully agree with them, but we weren't going to fight
the FTC,'' Miller said. ``I didn't want to end up in court with
them.''
<p>
   To be labeled low-fat, a food must contain 3 grams or less of
fat per serving or, in the case of a meal-size serving like a
personal pizza, 3 grams of fat or less per 100 grams of food.
<p>
   John T. Dugan, an FTC staff attorney in Boston, said six of the
eight Thinzettas personal pizzas marketed as ``low-fat'' by
Pizzeria Uno contained well in excess of the meal-size standard.
<p>
   Dugan said the terms of the FTC settlement with Pizzeria Uno
prohibited him from discussing the actual fat content or the
ingredients of the Thinzetta pizzas.
<p>
   Miller said Uno's vegetarian-style and barbecue chicken
Thinzettas pizza did qualify as low fat under the federal
definition, but other thin-crust pies with pepperoni, sausage and
cheese did not meet the standard.
<p>
   Miller declined to release information on the fat content of the
Thinzettas pizzas or the chain's more popular deep-dish
Chicago-style pizza, although the fat content of the deep-dish
pizzas sold in supermarkets is listed on the package.
<p>
   Federal dietary guidelines recommend a daily intake of less than
65 grams of fat for someone on a 2,000-calorie diet. The Uno
deep-dish pizza sold in supermarkets contains 15 grams of fat per
4.6-ounce serving, and a single pizza contains five servings.
<p>
   The deep-dish pizza has a buttery crust and uses part-skim
low-moisture mozzarella cheese. By contrast, the thin-crust pizza
uses a fat-free dough and a cheese topping that is 25 percent
part-skim mozzarella and 75 percent mozzarella that is 99 percent
fat free, Miller said.
<p>
   Miller said the Thinzettas pizzas were originally developed to
cater to customers concerned about fat levels. After the FTC raised
questions about the low-fat claims, Miller said all the low-fat
references in the restaurant chain's menu were deleted and no new
ads were run.
<p>
   Starting in May, regulations issued by the US Food and Drug
Administration will require restaurants to disclose nutrient
information in their menus.
<p>
   The FTC settlement agreement with Uno will not take effect until
a 60-day comment period expires.

<p>
   One of the nation's leading restaurant chains, Pizzeria Uno, has
conceded that its previous advertisements for low-fat, thin-crust
pizzas were false and misleading, and has promised the Federal
Trade Commission not to make such claims again.
<p>
   Craig Miller, the president and chief executive officer of Uno
Restaurant Corp., said in a telephone interview that the company
had not thoroughly examined the federal definition of low fat as it
relates to its eight varieties of Thinzetta pizzas. ``This is not
something we intentionally did, and the FTC agreed,'' Miller said.
``Low-fat pizza is a pretty strong statement, and our Thinzettas
are not low fat. Only a few of them qualify.''
<p>
   The consent agreement with the FTC, which the company signed in
October, is not an admission of guilt; the company promises to stop
whatever it has been accused of doing.
<p>
   The company, which is based in Massachusetts and has 156 outlets
nationwide, ran a print advertising campaign in 1995 touting its
``low-fat thin-crust pizzas.'' A television commercial broadcast
during the same period referred to ``great tasting, low-fat,
thin-crust pizzas.''
<p>
   The commission said in a complaint filed last October that six
of the thin-crust pizzas, called Thinzettas, did not meet the
federal definition of low fat  &MD;  3 grams of fat per serving  &MD;  since
they contained 14 to 36 grams of fat per serving.
<p>
   ``The consumer needs to be able to rely on food and nutrition
claims,'' said Lee Peeler, the associate director for advertising
practices in the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
``Around 1990, we started giving priority to these claims.''
<p>
   During the 1980s, the commission's enforcement activity dropped
dramatically; states' attorneys general took over much of the work.
Between 1980 and 1990, the commission settled only two cases of
deceptive advertising. Since 1990 the commission has settled 24
cases.
<p>
   In two recent cases, three companies that sell the dietary
supplement chromium picolinate signed consent agreements
acknowledging unsubstantiated claims about the product's ability to
help people lose weight. And Ross Products, a division of Abbott
Laboratories, signed a consent agreement in which it agreed it
would no longer make false and unsubstantiated claims about
doctors' recommendations for Ensure, a nutritional supplement.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Amid a dormitory-building spree that has made it one
of the biggest developers in Greenwich Village, New York University
now finds itself in the position of trying to resurrect a ghost of
New York culture: Luchow's restaurant, the elegant German
restaurant and beer hall that became a cultural icon in the 1890s.
<p>
   NYU plans to build a dorm for 600 undergraduates at East 14th
Street and Irving Place, the site of Luchow's for 100 years,
starting in 1882. With that will be a street-level cafe, with Gay
'90s theme, one floor above a student cafeteria.
<p>
   ``The idea is to re-echo some of the past glory of 14th
Street,'' said Dr. L. Jay Oliva, the university's president. He
said NYU hopes to remind New York that 14th Street, now a cut-rate
shopping district, once was the epicentor of Manhattan cuisine and
clubbish culture, home not only to Luchow's but also to Delmonico's
and the Academy of Music.
<p>
   The cafe, to be called Luchow's if legal permission is obtained,
will include furniture and prints from the old restaurant, if they
can be found. Luchow's moved to midtown in 1982 and closed a few
years later.

 &UR; NORBORNE, MO., IS SUPER PROUD OF PATRIOTS' MAX LANE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL CORO &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC;  NORBORNE, Mo.  &MD;  Head down this town's
main drag, a two-block stretch of bricks called the Business
District, at 85 mph in a neon-pink school bus, and maybe nobody
would notice.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   On a Wednesday morning in Norborne, leafless branches and dead
blades of grass are stirring more than the natives. City Hall and
the public library, housed together in a building smaller than a
QuikTrip, are closed. The lights are off.
<p>
   Only inside Norborne's walls can an outsider discover what a
proud week this is for the 856 people who call this patch of flood
plain home. Their favorite son, Max Lane, will play in Super Bowl
XXXI on Sunday.
<p>
   Most people in the town are more tickled that Lane, New
England's starting right tackle, will play in the Super Bowl than
if the Chiefs had made it. Even Mrs. Whitaker's first-grade class
can rattle off who Lane is, what team he plays for and what number
he wears. And most of the youngsters were not born when Lane donned
the Norborne Pirates' black and gold.
<p>
   Felicia Woods, 8, included a brazen Super Bowl prediction with a
good-luck letter for Lane: ``Max 10, Green Bay 1.''
<p>
   Super Bowl Sunday will be this town's biggest day since the
Soybean Festival in August but probably not bigger. After all, this
is the self-proclaimed ``soybean capital of the world.''
<p>
   ``I'm coming to that Soybean Festival,'' Patriots running back
Dave Meggett said to Lane's parents, Ezell and Lucille, at a game
this year.
<p>
   If Lane, a 1989 graduate of Norborne, had not pulled off a rare
Missouri 1A to Division I football transition and got drafted out
of Navy in the sixth round by New England in 1994, he could have
joined a couple of former Norborne linemen over at Norborne's only
grain elevator.
<p>
   ``He had more initiative and go than anybody I've ever known,''
said Wade Martensmayer, who had just been having a conversation
with Ray Carroll Co. Grain Growers co-workers about how the Navy
must have taken the clumsy out of Lane.
<p>
   Few thought Lane could play college football someday, let alone
start in the NFL. He did well to walk.
<p>
   ``I mean this in a nice way, but he was kind of like a little
puppy that has big feet and hasn't grown into them yet,'' said Ruth
Johnson, the elementary-school secretary. ``He took a lot of
teasing.''
<p>
   He was a head taller than his classmates in junior high and
ever-expanding from that 11-pound, 6-ounce birth weight. Now he's 6
feet 6 and 295 pounds.
<p>
   ``He was our human disposal,'' school cook Marian Kimbrough
said. ``He'd eat all the food the other kids wouldn't.''
<p>
   But dorky size turned into football size, and Lane became the
star of fall Friday nights. In a senior class of 22, Lane was voted
most popular, most likely to succeed, most athletic, hardest
worker, most outgoing, most talented, best personality, best
leader, friendliest and most enthusiastic. Perhaps most daring,
too, for that water-skiing stunt behind a car down the roadside
water pits of Missouri 10.
<p>
   And nothing has changed. Lane is still all that to his hometown
folk, who flock to him for autographs and memories when he comes
home three times a year. He's the same aw-shucks good ol' boy the
Patriots call ``Big Country.''
<p>
   A member of the church choir, he was so tender-hearted that he
was afraid to play football out of fear he would hurt somebody. Yet
when he fell on the stairs in grade school and cut his chin, he
told a teacher, ``I'm OK, it just makes me tougher,'' with tears
rolling down his cheeks.
<p>
   Many residents are planning parties, like the one at the Pine
Street Pub and Laundry, but Norborne's proudest couple is New
Orleans-bound with three of Lane's four siblings. Sister Beth has
to stay home in Augusta, Ga., because she may have a baby just as
Lane is pancaking Reggie White.
<p>
   ``It's pretty exciting to go,'' said Ezell, a retired oil
distributor in a Patriots sweatshirt. ``It's something you don't
expect coming from a small town. You don't have these kinds of
aspirations. There's a small-town syndrome to get over, but he's
pretty determined when it comes to football.
<p>
   ``It hasn't changed him. This is a community where you grow up
and nobody is better than the next person.''
<p>
   Straight across Fifth Street from the Lanes is Kenneth Weymeyer
Field, where Lane was a two-time all-state player. Lucille, whose
family stretches four generations in Norborne, never saw beyond
that humble environment.
<p>
   Now every Sunday, the Lanes fire up the satellite and hustle out
of church clothes to watch the Patriots. They watch it again on
tape to focus on Max, giving them banter for when he calls four
times a week.
<p>
   ``We just thought it was wonderful to see him on TV playing the
Army-Navy game,'' Lucille said. ``I never thought it would go any
farther.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Jan. 23:
<p>
   Vice President Al Gore, whose Buddhist-temple fund-raiser has
become a national joke, is reported to fear that former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey could win the Democratic presidential
nomination next time by running on a pledge to clean up campaign
finance. That raises the question why Gore does not talk President
Clinton into protecting him by building a strong record on this
issue. Yet Clinton just cannot bring himself to step forward as a
bold leader determined to drive dirty money out of campaigns and to
give up unconditionally the soft money that corporations and
wealthy favor-seekers pump into the national committees of the two
major parties.
<p>
   In place of comprehensive, unilateral reform, Clinton and
officials of the Democratic National Committee have announced some
modest curbs on fund-raising. In a teary voice, the retiring
committee chairman, Don Fowler, said that ``we made mistakes'' in
lapping up millions from foreign contributors. Clinton then said
the committee would not take any more money from citizens of other
nations, a prudent step considering that his campaign fund-raising
is currently under Justice Department investigation.
<p>
   But the president made even this bit of housekeeping seem
grudging by complaining that Democrats take ``all the heat'' for
unseemly fund-raising while Republicans, who ``raise more money in
big contributions,'' get ``a free ride.''
<p>
   Republicans, of course, have not escaped criticism. But it was
not they who were marching Asian contributors through the Oval
Office or who pioneered the artful bending of campaign law to
finance attack ads with soft-money contributions.
<p>
   Clinton announced that the Democrats were going to cut their
soft-money dosage to $100,000 a year from one source. But loopholes
in the self-imposed restriction may mean little real financial loss
for the party. Why not do the right thing and voluntarily forswear
all soft-money donations to the committee? Clinton said he was
ready to give up soft money if the Republicans would do the same.
That is an embarrassing definition of presidential leadership to
come only one day after an inaugural address.
<p>
   Clinton also asked the Republicans to help pass campaign-reform
legislation before the opportunity created by public disgust with
both parties fades away. ``Delay will mean the death of reform one
more time,'' he said, and on that point at least he spoke with real
authority. In the spring of 1993, he and House Speaker Tom Foley
delayed campaign finance legislation, and sure enough, it died.

 &UR; BACKS TAKE BACK SEAT ON SUPER BOWL TEAMS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN RAND &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC;  NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Only six running backs
have been voted most valuable player of a Super Bowl. Chances are
there won't be a seventh come Sunday.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   For just the second time in seven years, likely Hall of Fame
backs Emmitt Smith or Thurman Thomas won't be in the Super Bowl.
New England's Curtis Martin and Green Bay's Dorsey Levens and Edgar
Bennett will.
<p>
   These backs are secrets almost as well kept as their teams' game
plans, though in the playoffs they've all made a good case for more
work.
<p>
   The Packers' de-emphasis of their backs would make Vince
Lombardi turn over in his grave. You'd think the Patriots'
commitment to the passing game would appall Bill Parcells, except
that he coaches them.
<p>
   The Packers threw 83 times more than they ran in the regular
season and would have run less except they usually had leads to
protect. The Patriots threw 201 more times than they passed and
couldn't have run much less.
<p>
   Parcells once upon a time took the air out of the ball. His New
York Giants ran 39 times and helped control the ball 40 minutes, 33
seconds in a 20-19 Super Bowl victory over the Buffalo Bills six
years ago. Now Parcells puts helium in the ball.
<p>
   ``I wouldn't say neither team can run,'' Parcells said.
<p>
   ``I just think the weapons available have convinced both
coaching staffs that the expedient thing to do sometimes is throw.
I think both will try to use some patterns that in some respects
are similar to a first-down run  &MD;  a short, quick type of thing.''
<p>
   The Packers' commitment to passing is understandable. Coach Mike
Holmgren is a disciple of former 49ers coach Bill Walsh's
ball-control passing, and none of his runners appears to be a
franchise back. But Parcells won two Super Bowls preaching power
football, and Curtis Martin as a rookie gained 1,487 yards in 1995.
He dropped to 1,152 in '96.
<p>
   ``Last year we ran the ball so much, and we were 6-10,'' Martin
pointed out.
<p>
   ``You figure it out right there. I would rather be in this
position than gain 1,500 yards and lose.''
<p>
   This sounds all backwards for the NFL. It's more typical that
high-powered passing teams  &MD;  except, of course, the 49ers  &MD;  can't
become Super Bowl contenders until they learn to run. The
Jacksonville Jaguars, for instance, didn't mount a playoff drive
until Natrone Means' power running began to take some pressure off
Mark Brunell's throwing.
<p>
   But neither Super Bowl team wants to take much pressure off its
quarterback. Green Bay's Brett Favre and New England's Drew Bledsoe
barely take a deep breath to reload.
<p>
   ``Curtis has had a couple of great seasons, and I wouldn't
compare our running game to theirs,'' Levens said. ``But he's in
the same situation as we are because of Bledsoe.''
<p>
   Martin has two 1,000-yard seasons to prove he really can run
when necessary, but Levens and Bennett have mainly a stack of
newspaper clippings claiming what mediocre backs they are.
Actually, Bennett gained 899 regular-season yards and Levens 566,
and each caught 31 passes.
<p>
   ``At the beginning of the year, they said the weak link of the
Packers was the running backs  &MD;  that's why they're not going to the
Super Bowl,'' said Bennett, the starting halfback.
<p>
   ``That was motivation for us the entire season. We wanted to go
out and prove something, and I think we did.''
<p>
   Levens, a fullback who is also used in single-back sets, said:
``I've heard the reason Brett got the MVP (in 1995) was because we
didn't have a running game and he had to do it all by himself. So I
think we tried to prove to everybody that our running backs can
produce.''
<p>
   Packer backs became so desperate for recognition that William
Henderson, the blocking fullback, tried to find a nickname for him,
Levens, Bennett and halfback Travis Jervey.
<p>
   ``William came up with `The Four Horsemen,' '' Levens said,
grinning.
<p>
   ``I don't know if that's going to take off. I think he needs a
marketing assistant.''
<p>
   The best possible marketing for Packers backs has been their
playoff performances. Bennett has rushed for 179 yards and three
touchdowns. Levens has rushed for 134 yards and been the team's top
receiver with seven catches for 133 yards and a touchdown.
<p>
   ``Contrary to what people may believe, I'm not this crazy mad
bomber passing,'' Holmgren said.
<p>
   ``I would like to have a balanced attack and think we have
gotten better the last six weeks at running the ball. Part of that
was the elements. We played a couple of (playoff) games in Green
Bay where it was difficult to throw, and it forced me to call more
runs than maybe I normally would. I would like that to come into
play Sunday, no doubt about that.''
<p>
   Martin, too, has been hot in the playoffs, rushing for 225 yards
and four touchdowns. So could this Super Bowl, though played at
room temperature and on a carpet, showcase the running backs after
all?
<p>
   ``I doubt it,'' Levens said, grinning.
<p>
   ``If Brett's hot and we run the ball 20 times, it would be a
miracle.''

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese bonds fell as the dollar
rose to a 47-month high versus the yen, further dimming the allure
of yen-denominated assets.
<p>
   The dollar reached as high as 119.32 yen this morning, pushed
higher by U.S. economic strength and confidence other leading
industrial nations won't attempt to block its rise. The dollar last
traded for 119.12 yen.
<p>
   Although the strengthening dollar and rebounding Tokyo stocks
are preventing domestic bonds from rising above recent highs, the
basic trend for bond prices is still up, said Peter Morgan, senior
portfolio manager at Banque Nationale de Paris.
<p>
   ``The bond market is in good shape,'' he said. ``I think that
most domestic market participants are quite constructive'' amid
confidence domestic interest rates will remain low until the
economy's back on track.
<p>
   The lead bond futures contract for March delivery fell 0.22 yen
to 126 yen. The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year government
bond rose 1.5 basis points to 2.405 percent.
<p>
   The lead futures contract rose as high as 126.34 yen this
morning. Highs for the previous three days were 126.35 yen, 126.38
yen and 126.32 yen, respectively.
<p>
   Prices could fall further by week's end if the contract's
inability to rise through those levels persuades traders to sell
the contract short, Morgan said.
<p>
   The record high for the March contract is 126.55 yen, set on
Dec. 3. For a lead contract, the record high is 126.58 yen, set by
the December contract.
<p>
   Traders and analysts had mixed opinions of how Tokyo share
movements were affecting bonds.
<p>
   This morning, the Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index ended up 6.28
yen, or 0.03 percent, to 18,020.16 as electronics shares rose on
the stronger dollar.
<p>
   Shunji Sakami, chief strategist at LTCB Securities Co., said the
impact of the dollar's gains against the yen could be mitigated as
stocks stabilize.
<p>
   ``If confidence sets in that stocks won't fall much further
through the end of the fiscal year, concern over the need to lock
in returns from bonds will ease,'' he said. Japan's fiscal year
ends March 31.
<p>
   Takeshi Naito, assistant general manager of bond analysis at
Daiwa Securities Co., said that while concern remains that
investors could sell bonds to offset losses in equities, many
financial institutions had probably done so earlier this month,
when the Nikkei 225 sank toward 17,000 yen.

<p>
   Grossman's Inc., which has been losing ground to the home
improvement chains for years, Wednesday said it might seek Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection.
<p>
   The Canton, Mass. company said it was experiencing a ``severe
liquidity shortage'' in its Contractors' Warehouse operations, a
group of stores it owns in the Midwest and Far West. A group of
stores that operates in the Northeast, called Mr. 2nd's Bargain
Outlet, is doing somewhat better, according to the company.
<p>
   ``We will make a quick decision on this matter,'' said Steven
Shapiro, a vice president at Grossman's. With the threat of
bankruptcy hanging over the company, vendors could refuse to ship
goods to the stores, say retail analysts.
<p>
   Grossman's operates 10 Mr. 2nd's Bargain Outlet stores in
Massachusetts. The company estimates it has about 150 employees in
the state.
<p>
   Wednesday's news did not come as a great surprise to Wall
Street, which has all but abandoned hope for Grossman's. The
company's stock fell 1/64 to close at 17/64. The stock has been
falling steadily for several days, apparently in anticipation of
bad news.
<p>
   Founded in Quincy, Mass. as a junk business by Louis Grossman
more than 100 years ago, the company reached its peak in 1983 when
it operated 345 stores across the country and its orange delivery
trucks were a familiar part of the landscape.
<p>
   But Grossman's was unprepared to compete with budding national
chains such as Home Depot, which supplied many of the same products
at lower prices.
<p>
   Last March, the company bit the bullet and closed its remaining
60 retail lumber outlets, a move that eliminated 1,600 jobs,
including 500 in Massachusetts. But the parent company continued to
operate the Contractors' Warehouse and Mr. 2nd's chains. As
recently as October, chief executive Robert Swanson sounded upbeat
about the company's chances. ``I am confident that with the
experienced professionals we have, we will keep the company on the
right track,'' he said.
<p>
   That forecast proved too optimistic. Sales have been falling at
Contractors' Warehouse stores. Those stores are responsible for the
bulk of Grossman's sales. More importantly, they were supposed to
be the company's future. ``We expected most of our future growth to
come from them,'' said Shapiro.
<p>
   Grossman's Wednesday said its December comparable store sales
were 4 percent below the levels achieved in December 1995.
Comparable store sales were up 4.7 percent at the 26 stores it
operates in the Northeast.
<p>
   In the 1996's third quarter, Grossman's earned a profit of $1.4
million on sales of $96 million.

   NEW YORK  &MD;  Two days after a 2-year-old Brooklyn boy died with a
blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit defining drunkenness,
city medical examiners began a series of toxicological tests
Wednesday to see if the toddler was killed by alcohol poisoning.
<p>
   The boy, Melquen Blue, was brought to Long Island College
Hospital early Monday morning by his mother, Tarkisha Blue, who
told doctors there that he had fallen out of bed, police said.
Melquen was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m.

<p>
   Melbourne, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- National Australia Bank Ltd.
said its net profit rose 13.5 percent to A$582 million (US$451
million) in its first quarter ended Dec. 31.
<p>
   The bank, Australia's most profitable, said revenue rose 8.8
percent to A$3.98 billion.
<p>
   Earnings per share rose 9.7 percent to 39.4 Australian cents.
<p>
   ``Earnings growth was achieved by a combination of cost
containment, strong credit management'' and marketing, said
Managing Director Don Argus.
<p>
   ``The group benefited from continued strength in the performance
of its banking operations in New Zealand, the U.S., the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.''
<p>
   Apart from its Australian operations, National Australia Bank
owns Bank of New Zealand and controls Scotland's Clydesdale and
Yorkshire banks in England and National Irish Bank in Ireland. It
also owns U.S. regional bank Michigan National Corp.
<p>
   Chairman Bill Irvine said the bank's international spread of
assets puts it in a strong position to ``weather to slow-down'' in
Australian economic activity.
<p>
   ``The Republic of Ireland continues to experience very rapid
growth,'' Chairman Bill Irvine said.
<p>
   ``It now appears that a significant economic upturn is also
under way in the United Kingdom.''
<p>
   Irvine said the economy in Michigan is experiencing ``very
buoyant economic conditions, with record industrial production and
low levels of unemployment.''
<p>
   ``Against that, the New Zealand and Australian economies
continue to experience more difficult and patchy conditions.''
<p>
   National Australia reported a 6.8 percent rise in net profit to
A$2.1 billion in the year ended Sept. 30, 1996. The growth was
driven by the bank's offshore operations.
<p>
   Earning from the Australian operations in the year rose 0.1
percent.
<p>
   Irvine said the bank is seeking additional growth through
``prudent'' acquisitions.
<p>
   ``In the case of the National, our choice is clear,'' Irvine
said. ``We believe it is important to have a spread of assets in
terms of business and geographic locations.''
<p>
   Argus said National Australia bank is seeking alliances with
banks, insurers or other financial institutions in Asia.
<p>
   He said, though, the bank doesn't expect to seek an acquisition
in the U.S. as current bank prices are ``too hot to buy anything.''
<p>
   In the quarter, the bank said non-interest income rose 19.2
percent to A$813 million, group assets rose 11.6 percent to A$184
billion, the bad-debt charge fell 32.8 percent to A$39 million,
while group deposits rose 11.2 percent to A$119.4 billion and its
cost-to-income ratio fell to 53.3 percent from 54.9 percent in the
year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   Argus said the bank intends to reduce the cost ratio further in
the next few years. It is targeting close to 40 percent by 2000, he
said.
<p>
   The National Australia Bank said, though, its interest rate
margins remain under pressure.
<p>
   ``Margins are going to continue to be under pressure,'' Argus
said. ``We are in a competitive game -- I would expect that they
will contract a little bit more yet,'' he said.
<p>
   The company's shares were recently 9 cents higher at A$15.10.

 &UR; IN ALBANY, APPROVAL BUT NO ACTION ON ENDING TAX ON CLOTHING &LR;  &QL; 
(lh) &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ALBANY, N.Y.  &MD;  State lawmakers and their aides cautioned
Wednesday against drawing strong conclusions from a sudden apparent
consensus between Gov. George Pataki and the leaders of the
Legislature that the sales tax on most clothing should be
eliminated.
<p>
   Officials noted that the governor and Republican legislators
have made property-tax relief their first priority this year. They
questioned whether the state could take on that expense and absorb
the loss of sales-tax revenue as well.
<p>
   Change in the sales tax has not been a subject of discussion
among Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and Pataki and
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, both Republicans. All three
did speak well of the idea on Tuesday when talking to reporters.
Pataki and Bruno offered vaguely supportive statements. But Silver
has long backed eliminating the tax on clothing.
<p>
   The sudden focus on the issue results from the state's
experiment this week with suspending the tax. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani went to Albany on Tuesday to address legislators about
what the city wants from the state, a closely watched annual event,
and his first request was that the sales tax be ended permanently
before the year is out.
<p>
   Later in the day, reporters asked first Bruno, R-Rensselaer
County, then Pataki, each with Giuliani standing by his side, to
comment on the mayor's request.
<p>
   ``As I've said to the mayor, there isn't a tax cut that I don't
like, so we want to continue to talk about that,'' Bruno said.
<p>
   Pataki said he would ``look over time, as the state's fiscal
condition improves, to getting rid of it,'' but that any reduction
would have to be phased in over a period of years.
<p>
   ``I've got to give it to the mayor,'' said a Democratic Assembly
member, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He came up here, used
his bully pulpit and forced the issue.''
<p>
   The mayor's comments could not have been better timed, in the
middle of what is, by all reports, a hugely successful experiment
with dropping the sales tax on shoes and items of clothing costing
less than $500.
<p>
   Silver introduced a bill on Tuesday to eliminate the tax, and
said he thought the success of the week-long experiment would
persuade Pataki and Bruno to go along.
<p>
   Eliminating the sales tax on most clothes would erase $600
million a year in state revenues, and even supporters acknowledge
that it would take years for that loss to be recovered.
<p>
   ``The problem with getting rid of the sales tax is it's very
expensive,'' said John McArdle, spokesman for Bruno. ``We have no
problem getting into a bidding war on tax cuts, but from our
standpoint and the governor's standpoint, the priority this year is
the property-tax cuts.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 23:
<p>
   Riding the magic carpet of Wednesday's unanimous Senate
confirmation vote, Madeleine Albright becomes secretary of state
Thursday. She can be an eloquent champion of freedom around the
world. How skillfully she blends that calling with the pragmatic
politics of U.S. diplomacy will define her stewardship at the State
Department.
<p>
   Restoring America's traditional interest in democracy and the
rule of law to the heart of Washington's foreign-policy agenda
would be a service to the nation and the world.
<p>
   As America's chief diplomat and principal voice on international
issues, Albright must carry out President Clinton's decisions. But
she also has an extraordinary opportunity to shape the debate. She
should use it to restore a better balance to policies that have
become excessively driven by commercial considerations.
<p>
   America's national interests sometimes call for putting
commercial or security concerns ahead of human rights issues. It
makes sense, for example, to negotiate with Stalinist North Korea
on nuclear weapons issues, to expand trade with a less than fully
democratic Mexico and to maintain economic exchanges and diplomatic
dialogue with a China that torments democrats and dissidents and
bullies its smaller neighbors.
<p>
   But such diplomatic realism does not require Washington to mute
its distaste for provocative and repressive policies, as it has
most conspicuously done in the case of China. Overlooking such
behavior weakens U.S. credibility abroad and feeds cynicism at
home. The American people expect their foreign policy to reflect
American ideals.
<p>
   Madeleine Albright is ideally equipped to speak out forcefully
on freedom's behalf. Her background as a refugee from both Nazism
and communism has taught her the differences between democracy and
dictatorship and made her sensitive to the need to reinforce market
and electoral reforms with independent civic institutions. Her
strong scholarly grasp of foreign policy has now been seasoned by
four years of experience at the United Nations.
<p>
   She takes office at a propitious moment for new initiatives on
democracy and human rights. Clinton has grown more comfortable and
experienced with foreign policy. The notable successes already
achieved on trade, Bosnia, relations with Russia, Middle East peace
and choosing a new United Nations secretary general will free
Albright from some of the burdens of crisis management that
preoccupied Warren Christopher.
<p>
   It can be a remarkable match of personal qualities and political
opportunity. Albright should make the most of it.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 23:
<p>
   The National Academy of Sciences reports that federal spending
on basic research and new technologies in 1997 will barely rise
above 1996 levels, despite years of steady decline. Even worse, the
five-year deficit reduction plan, as embraced by Congress and
President Clinton, will knock 35 percent out of the country's
science programs by the year 2002.
<p>
   The trend is ominous because research pays big dividends,
accounting for perhaps half the growth in living standards and
raising output by 30 cents or more on each invested dollar.
<p>
   The National Academy estimates that Washington spends about $40
billion on activities that add to scientific knowledge. Biomedical
research, primarily at the National Institutes of Health, gets
about 30 percent of the science budget. The National Science
Foundation, which funnels money into university research, accounts
for only about 5 percent. Programs outside the Institutes of Health
have fallen by about 10 percent since 1994.
<p>
   If Congress and the president insist on balancing the budget by
2002 while giving away $100 billion in tax cuts, they may have to
trim the total spending on all discretionary programs by 30 to 40
percent. But some programs, like border patrols and public health,
will be left alone. That will force Congress to take even more from
programs like science, where there is no short-term payoff.
<p>
   Clinton promised in 1992 that he would promote economic growth
through public investments. The budget plan for 1998 that he will
deliver to Congress early next month may propose only small
reductions. But after 2000, he and Congress will find themselves on
a destructive course.

   Columbus Avenue Base for Soros Institute
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Financier and philanthropist George Soros has leased
two floors of office space, extending the full block along the west
side of Columbus Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, as a new
base for the Open Society Institute, an organization he founded in
1993.
<p>
   The two floors, totaling 76,250 square feet, are the commercial
base of a 50-story, twin-tower rental apartment complex that is
nearing completion by Manhattan developer Daniel Brodsky.
<p>
   According to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the brokerage that represents
Brodsky, the Open Space Institute signed a 15-year lease on the
space for $30 million, and is expected to move into the building
sometime in the spring.
<p>
   Now based at 888 Seventh Ave., the institute is expected to move
all of its 160 New York City employees to the new building.
<p>
   The institute, part of a huge international philanthropic
organization financed by Soros, is engaged in a variety of research
projects and other programs in the United States, Eastern Europe
and Asia, focusing on such areas as criminal justice reform, mental
illness and domestic violence.  &MD;  TOM LUECK

   Morgan Stanley Rebuts A Racial Bias Lawsuit
<p>
   Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. chairman Richard B. Fisher and president
John J. Mack have personally sought out senior black executives to
allay concerns following the filing of a racial discrimination
lawsuit against the investment banking company.
<p>
   In addition to sending a memo to the company's 10,000 employees,
``Dick and John made a special effort to speak to the senior people
here and reinforce that we will fight the charges vigorously,''
said Jean Marie McFadden, a company spokeswoman.
<p>
   The lawsuit causing angst inside the 62-year-old firm, at 1585
Broadway, was filed in December by two employees who had earlier
complained about racist jokes being sent around the office via
electronic mail.
<p>
   In their lawsuit, the two employees, Yolanda Owens and Edward
Hutton, said that after they complained about the jokes the company
retaliated by refusing to promote them.
<p>
   Ms. Owens works in the company's computer systems department and
Owens works in facilities maintenance. Both are on voluntary leave,
with full pay and benefits.
<p>
   Morgan Stanley officials do not deny that the e-mail was
circulated, but they have insisted that they disciplined the
employees involved. Ms. McFadden also denied that Ms. Owens and
Hutton were passed over for promotions because they complained
about the incident.  &MD;  BRETT PULLEY

   A Boom in Tourism
<p>
   Tourism is booming in New York City. According to the latest
estimates, 30.3 billion people visited the city last year, pouring
$13 billion into the local economy.
<p>
   So why is the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau rolling
out a major campaign to lure tourists with discounts at 250 hotels,
restaurants, stores and cultural institutions? Two words: The cold.
<p>
   ``We have now entered the slowest time of the year for the
25,000 tourism-related businesses and their 130,000 employees,''
said Stephen J. Morello, the bureau's president. ``It's not because
we have less to offer but because the weather makes us less
competitive. We can't sit back and let the city sell itself.''
<p>
   Indeed, after the New Year, the hotel occupancy rate dips to
somewhere between 65 percent and 70 percent, compared with last
year's average occupancy rate of 81 percent.
<p>
   Fifteen hotels, from the Days to the Ritz-Carlton New York, are
participating in the campaign called ``New York for a Song,'' by
offering discounts of up to 40 percent.
<p>
   Hotel guests will receive a ``fun pass''  &MD;  a subway Metrocard
with one free fare and a discount at participating restaurants,
stores, theaters and museums. The campaign is scheduled to run
through the end of March.  &MD;  LISA FODERARO

 &UR; JAPANESE STOCKS MIXED; MAJOR ELECTRONICS GAIN ON STRONG DOLLAR &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Todd Zaun &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks traded mixed, holding
on to gains yesterday, as a stronger dollar pushed shares of
electronics exporters higher while sending retail and utility
shares lower.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Canon Inc. and Aiwa Corp. led gainers. Tokyo Electric Power Co.
and retailer Ito-Yokado Co. led decliners amid concern the stronger
U.S. currency will raise the cost of imported goods.
<p>
   The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose 6.28, or 0.03
percent, to 18,020.16. The broader Topix index of all first section
shares fell 1.82, or 0.13 percent, to 1,376.80.
<p>
   Investors and analysts' held out hope that deregulation, such as
the possible scrapping of taxes on securities sales, will revive
financial markets.
<p>
   ``We are seeing signs the government is really pushing for
reforms and deregulation,'' said Haruyoshi Mabuchi, chief
strategist at Nikko Research Center, Ltd. ``There's real reason to
be bullish.''
<p>
   The dollar jumped to a 47-month high against the yen. That's
good news for Japanese exporters because a strong dollar makes
their products more competitive overseas and boosts earnings when
converted to yen. In early Asian trading, the dollar rose as high
as 119.32.
<p>
   Canon gained 60 yen to 2,510, Hitachi Ltd. rose 10 yen to 1,040.
Sanyo Electric Co. rose 25 yen to 475 after Nomura Research
Institute raised its rating on the company from ``neutral'' to
``buy,'' citing the company's strategy of focusing on making
electronics components instead of consumer products.
<p>
   Advantest Corp., a maker of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, rose as much as 120 yen to 6,270.
<p>
   ``The strength of the computer companies in the U.S. will lend
strength to computer-related stocks here,'' said Eiji Azumu,
general manager of the equity trading department at Daiwa
Securities Co.
<p>
   Aiwa's shares rose as much as 180 yen to 2,050. Audio maker Aiwa
Co. earnings for the year are likely to exceed the company's own
forecasts, according to a report by Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.
<p>
   Mazda Motor Corp. rose 16 yen to 377 after the Nihon Keizai
newspaper said the company and Ford Motor Co. agreed to share
engines to cut production costs. Mazda, which is owned 33.4 percent
by Ford, will make engines for small vehicles while Ford will make
all other engines. Mazda will start making its first such ``world
engines'' by 1999.
<p>
   Elsewhere, shares of Sony Music Entertainment Inc. got a boost
from a report the company's earnings will beat expectations due to
strong sales of the PlayStation video game machines of subsidiary
Sony Computer Entertainment. The stock rose 100 yen to 4,300.
<p>
   ``A continuous higher trending dollar and strength in overseas
computer and high-tech related stocks will continue to give
strength to Japan's high-tech companies and exporters,'' said Dhia
Amir, who sells equity to institutions at Nomura Securities Co.
<p>
   Stocks soared yesterday after Sohei Miyashita, deputy chairman
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax research committee,
called for repealing the tax levied when investors sell stocks and
bonds
<p>
   Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka sounded cautious about the
proposal, saying at a press conference after the stock market
closed the ministry could only consider eliminating the tax ``in
the whole context of taxation on financial trading.''
<p>
   ``I have heard some members of the LDP's tax council are
proposing the repeal of the tax, but that's the party's idea,'' he
said. The ministry needs to carry out its own study on the plan, he
said.
<p>
   The ministry's cautious stance didn't hurt stocks because
traders and investors are confident the government will have to
eliminate the tax as part of promised deregulation measures,
analysts said.
<p>
   To be sure, some said the weak yen bad news for companies tied
to the domestic economy.
<p>
   A report that car importers will raise prices on some luxury
models shows that the strong dollar is already pushing prices
higher in some areas.
<p>
   Tokyo Electric Power and other utility shares slipped on concern
the yen's weakness would raise the cost of importing fuel. At the
same time, a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official
yesterday called on Japan's power companies to lower rates. Tokyo
Electric stock fell 30 yen to 2,430. Tohoku Electric Power shares
fell 40 yen to 2,190.
<p>
   Retail stocks such as supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co.
slipped amid lingering concern that a planned consumption tax hike
will weigh on sales, traders said. Ito-Yokado stock fell 230 yen to
5,510. Discount department store operator Jusco Ltd. fell 110 yen
to 3,440. Tokyu Department Store fell 30 yen to 450.

 &UR; EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF AIDS CAN BE CURED IS DELAYED A YEAR &LR;  &QL; 
(th) &QL;

 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &QC;  &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Dr. David Ho, a leading AIDS scientist, said
Wednesday that he had pushed back by up to a year his plans to do
crucial tests to determine whether infection with the AIDS virus
can be cured in some people.
<p>
   The tests would involve deliberately stopping combination drug
therapy in an infected patient in whom HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, had not been detected through careful monitoring for at least
two to two and one-half years.
<p>
   Then Ho's team at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in
Manhattan would test the individual repeatedly to determine if HIV
could be detected again.
<p>
   The theory that the virus can be eliminated from the body is
based on the fact that the cells infected by the virus die after
varying lengths of time. If no HIV is left in the body, then the
cells that replace the old ones should be uninfected.
<p>
   Ho's discussion in Washington seemed much more subdued in tone
than when he and his team spoke at the international AIDS meeting
in Vancouver last July about the possibility of doing the crucial
tests sometime this past fall.
<p>
   Wednesday, Ho said that ``we have never popped the question with
our patients'' to stop therapy to test the theory that AIDS might
be curable. He spoke at a news conference before opening an AIDS
meeting Wednesday night with a talk titled: ``Can HIV Be Eradicated
From an Infected Person?''
<p>
   The answer, Ho said, is ``clearly we don't know.''
<p>
   He also said that ``unequivocally,'' HIV had not been eradicated
from any of the patients in his studies.
<p>
   ``We need to know what happens in the next six months, next
year,'' he said.
<p>
   Ho said his team's first scientific blueprint for the studies
called for addressing the question of stopping therapy a year after
it started.
<p>
   ``However, in the meantime we have learned a great deal and we
need to treat longer,'' he said.
<p>
   He also said his team was reconsidering its original plan to
stop all drugs at the same time. He said the revised timing of
delaying stopping therapy for up to another year particularly
reflected findings obtained since the meeting in Vancouver.
<p>
   Part of the research is intended to define the amount of HIV
replication in the body, how it varies in different organs and
tissues, and how fast HIV and infected cells die.
<p>
   In another part of the research, Ho's team has been treating for
about a 18 months 20 individuals within three months of the date
they were believed to have become infected with HIV.
<p>
   Treatment with a combination of anti-HIV drugs is an initial
step in testing the theory of curability of AIDS.
<p>
   In research conducted in parallel, Ho said his team was ``seeing
very comparable results'' in individuals who had been infected for
much longer periods and who had never taken any anti-HIV drug until
they participated in his study.
<p>
   As part of the research, Ho's team repeatedly uses blood tests
and cultures to try to detect HIV in semen, lymph nodes and lymph
tissue taken in biopsies of the rectum. So far there has been no
evidence of on-going viral replication in the participants' semen
or other tissues, Ho said.
<p>
   He said that the findings should not alter public health
recommendations to practice safe sex.
<p>
   He also said that ``we do find some residual viral particles
trapped in the tissues and we think that that is consistent with
our understanding'' of what happens to HIV in the body.
<p>
   Information based on tests from the participants indicates that
HIV could remain for up to two and one-half years in the areas of
the body that can be tested. But the inability to detect HIV does
not necessarily mean that the virus is absent from the body.
<p>
   It is not known whether HIV can hide in the brain or some other
sanctuary, protected from the combination of drugs, and then
re-infect the body after drug therapy is stopped.
<p>
   The intent of the experiment to see if AIDS can be cured is more
a scientific one than a therapeutic one, Ho said, and it is to
prove the concept that under optimal conditions the virus can be
eradicated from an infected individual.
<p>
   ``You have to take your hat off as a physician and put the hat
of a scientist on,'' said Ho, who is both a medical doctor and a
scientist.
<p>
   He said that the success of combination therapy was something
that virtually all experts considered ``outrageous'' before it was
undertaken. In testing the concept of curing AIDS, he said, ``we
are doing what we are supposed to do as basic researchers.''
<p>
   But Ho said, ``The glare of the media spotlight makes its
difficult for us to do this work.''

 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE POSNANSKI &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC;  KILN, Miss.  &MD;  This little town of Kiln
must have been a tough place for Brett Favre to grow up, you know,
with all the reporters hanging around. Heck, half the town wears a
media badge. There are reporters interviewing librarians,
gardeners, shrubs, wood paneling. Mostly, reporters interview
reporters. A young Brett Favre must have had to sidestep ESPN every
time he wanted to eat a sandwich.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``We've had 50 people over to the house,'' Dad, Irvin Favre,
tells 12 cameras, seven microphones, 23 notepads, six producers and
a tray of bagels. ``I can't get anything done.''
<p>
   Yes sir, this is the ``Explore the Beginnings of Brett Favre Day
Trip,'' a media bus journey through the rustic life and times of
Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre, lunch included. The tour
guarantees insight into Favre, who leads the Packers against the
New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. The package also includes
a Super Bowl pronunciation guide for newcomers to Mississippi.
<p>
   Kiln: pronounced Kill.
<p>
   Favre: pronounced Favre.
<p>
   New Orleans: pronounced N'awlins.
<p>
   New England Patriots: pronounced dead.
<p>
   Then, local knowledge in hand, we headed out to find the real
Brett Favre, who, as you probably know, grew up in Kiln, swam in
swamps, ate live crawdads, killed bears with his bare hands and so
on. We are promised a peek at his rustic American life, complete
with alligators and moonshine and fast cars and dirt roads, a Dukes
of Hazzard reunion tour.
<p>
   They also give out free Brett Favre hats.
<p>
   ``Hey, are you kidding?'' says Mike from the radio show ``Mike
and the Mad Dog.'' ``This bus is going to Hattiesburg, Mississippi?
I don't want to go to Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Hey. Let me out.
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT! HEY!''
<p>
   The bus driver drops off Mike in a nice, rustic field somewhere,
and we are off again, looking for rustic things, like the Kiln Oil
Change and Arcade and also The Rooster, the most popular restaurant
in Kiln, meaning the only restaurant in Kiln, or at least the only
one anyone can find.
<p>
   ``Oh, we're used to crowds,'' explains Lee Lott, owner and
proprietor. ``On Fridays and Saturdays we have entertainment. We
have a piano bar, and we have a singer. Oh, our singer, her name is
Gigi Hines, she's so wonderful and talented. She's black.''
<p>
   Oh, yes, it's quite rustic here in Kiln, among other things, and
Irvin Favre tells the tape recorders, ``So I said, `Well, I'm going
to make my boys quarterbacks,' '' and Bonita Favre tells about the
time the family St. Bernard was munched up by an alligator, and a
family friend tells some story that is supposed to be quite funny
and rustic, only it goes on too long, and he blows the punch line,
and then it's time to leave.
<p>
   We go to the Kiln Public Library, which is significantly larger
than many elevators, and there is a miniature replica of a still.
``Wanted to bring in some local history,'' the librarian says. The
one copy of the Brett Favre biography  &MD;  /{Huck Finn Grows Up/}  &MD;  is
on a shelf. They won't lend it out until after the Super Bowl.
Seven people are on the waiting list.
<p>
   We go to Hattiesburg, home of Southern Mississippi, Brett
Favre's old college. We get a police escort, presumably so we won't
try to escape. We get a nice tour of Hattiesburg, including a
closeup look at the zoo. We get to meet Brett Favre's old coach and
his old assistant coach and the school president and some
fund-raising guy and a bunch of fans and the groundskeeper and the
policemen who provided the escort and a public-relations man from
the hospital that operated on Favre after a car accident and
Favre's old roommate, Chris Ryals.
<p>
   ``Chris, according to Reggie White,'' a television reporter
begins, ``Brett offers many unusual smells and sounds. Can you
explain?''
<p>
   Also, they trot out Lee Roberts, the current Southern Miss
quarterback.
<p>
   ``I've never met Brett Favre,'' he explains. ``I've seen his
face on TV.''
<p>
   Somehow, none of this seems to capture Favre's rustic life or
anything else. Except for a few alligator stories and some good
swamp photo opportunities, Brett Favre remains a mystery. Lunch is
good, though.
<p>
   Then, one old teammate, Greg Reed, sits in a corner. He wears a
UPS jacket. He is on break from work. He also grew up on the Gulf
Coast in Mississippi, and he was a receiver at Southern Miss, a
pretty good one, and he did not know then that Brett Favre would
get that life and he would get this one. Life's that way, though.
There's no time to be bitter.
<p>
   ``I remember the first pass,'' Reed says. ``It was cold, and I
ran about 12 yards, and he threw it. And I turned around and the
ball was coming at me, and I could hear it.''
<p>
   What did it sound like?
<p>
   ``A whistle, maybe,'' he says. ``No, that's not it. I can't
really describe it. I've never heard anything like it. It just sort
of whined, you know? And when I heard that ball, I knew that the
guy was special. You just know.''
<p>
   He laughs a little and looks around at the Brett Favre circus,
and he shakes his head. ``Guess you guys can't get enough of Brett,
huh?'' he asks, and he laughs again and he says that Sunday he will
watch the game in N'awlins. He will keep his ears close to the
television. He will listen for the football.

<p>
   Manila, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Ayala Corp. won one of two
contracts to run Manila's state-owned water utility, ending a
string of losses at big-ticket asset sales for the Philippines'
oldest holding company.
<p>
   Ayala, whose bidding partners are U.S. construction company
Bechtel Group Inc. and Britain's United Utilities Plc., gave the
lowest bid to run half of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage
System's service area where 11 million Filipinos live.
<p>
   The government said a second group, led by Benpres Holdings
Corp. and France's Lyonnaise des Eaux, won the other contract. The
two beat Metro Pacific Corp. and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. in
what the government dubbed as one of the world's biggest water
utility sales.
<p>
   The winners will have to invest a combined $7 billion over the
life of the contract to rehabilitate and expand the water utility's
12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) of pipes. MWSS, because of leaks
and pilferage, loses more than half the water it pumps.
<p>
   With the win, Ayala will add a new business to its already
formidable portfolio. It controls Ayala Land Inc., the nation's
largest property developer and the most valuable company on the
stock exchange, and Bank of the Philippine Islands, its third
largest bank. It also has telecommunications, electronics, and food
processing units.

   Chief Strategy Officer Quits McCann-Erickson
<p>
   McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York said Wednesday that Peter
Kim, vice chairman and chief strategic officer, had left the
agency, effective immediately.
<p>
   Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman for McCann, a unit of the Interpublic
Group of Cos., described the surprise resignation of Kim, 37, as
``amicable,'' adding that he had ``decided to pursue other
activities.'' Callers to McCann Wednesday were told by an operator
that Kim ``was no longer with us.''
<p>
   Eric Einhorn, 45, was named to assume Kim's duties, which had
been refocused to concentrate on a McCann brand consulting unit
named the 14th Floor. Einhorn had been executive vice president and
director for the McCann New York strategic review board.
<p>
   Kim joined McCann in 1993 from J. Walter Thompson New York, part
of WPP Group, where he had been executive vice president and U.S.
strategic planning director. He was the second top executive in two
days to abruptly leave a big agency, coming after J. Steve Davis
left as president and chief executive of the New York office of
Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising.

   TBWA UK to Merge With Simons Palmer
<p>
   TBWA UK, the British operation of TBWA International, and Simons
Palmer Clemmow Johnson, a creatively focused agency in London, said
Wednesday that they would merge by the end of March to form
TBWA/Simons Palmer. Terms were not disclosed.
<p>
   The merged agency, described as the 10th largest in Britain,
will have combined billings estimated at $350 million. TBWA UK is
contributing accounts with billings of $230 million from clients
like Absolut vodka, Nissan and Wonderbra. Simons Palmer brings in
billings of $120 million from clients like Fuji, Nike and Sony.
<p>
   Paul Simons, chairman at Simons Palmer, becomes chief executive
of TBWA/Simons Palmer. And Jonathan Hoare, chairman at TBWA UK,
becomes group chairman of the merged agency. TBWA/Simons Palmer
will be situated in the TBWA UK office in London. TBWA is owned by
Omnicom Group.

 &UR; THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT PACKERS' BROWN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By JASON WHITLOCK &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c. 1997 Kansas City Star &LR;  &QC;  NEW ORLEANS  &MD;  Doug Evans says Green Bay
nose tackle Gilbert Brown ``fluctuates'' between 355 and 400
pounds. ``Depending upon whether he's eaten a Gilbert burger or
not,'' adds Evans, a Packer cornerback.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Santana Dotson says he'll never forget the day Brown fell on him
in practice. ``I didn't know if I'd ever see my family again,''
says Dotson, a Packers defensive lineman.
<p>
   Fritz Shurmur says Brown is regarded as the sexiest man over 350
pounds in all of Green Bay. ``He's an acquired taste,'' explains
Shurmur, the Packers defensive coordinator.
<p>
   Fortunately or unfortunately  &MD;  you be the judge  &MD;  Gilbert Brown
is defined by his size. At 6 feet 2 and 350-plus pounds, it's a
rather lengthy definition, but nonetheless it's a rather limiting
one.
<p>
   Brown's size is all that seems to matter here in the Big Easy,
site of Super Bowl XXXI on Sunday. Brown, a former Kansas Jayhawk,
has been here for four days, and all anyone talks to him about is
his weight.
<p>
   No one seems to care that Brown is the heart of the Packers run
defense, that this season, his fourth in the NFL, he established
himself as one of the league's most feared interior tackles, that
the Patriots are probably more concerned with handling Brown than
all-time great Reggie White.
<p>
   Nope. All that matters is Brown's weight.
<p>
   What do you like to eat Gilbert?
<p>
   ``I love my mama's peppered steak and fried chicken. Really,
anything my mama cooks, I love.''
<p>
   How much do you weigh, Gilbert?
<p>
   ``If I told ya, I'd have to kill ya. Let's just say I was 310
pounds in high school, and I don't know when I've seen the 250s  &MD; 
maybe never.''
<p>
   Gilbert, do you mind the questions about your weight?
<p>
   ``It doesn't really bother me. People are amazed at my size, but
it's no big deal to me. My whole family is big.''
<p>
   The questions dragged on and on, until finally those of us who
didn't want to talk or write about Brown's size could see Brown
only in terms of girth.
<p>
   It's difficult to tell where Brown's shoulders end and his neck
begins. His neck is 23 inches round-trip. That's probably bigger
than your thigh. His waist measures 48 inches. He doesn't know his
chest measurement, but a 62 coat fits snugly. He can bench-press
500 pounds.
<p>
   One of his former coaches predicts he'll eat his way out of the
NFL, that Brown will fade quicker than Brown's idol, William ``The
Refrigerator'' Perry, faded from the NFL spotlight.
<p>
   ``Yeah, that's what Coach (John) Teerlinck says,'' Brown said.
``He's still bad-mouthing me, saying I'm going to blow up, eat my
way out of football.''
<p>
   Teerlinck briefly coached Brown in Minnesota, the team that
drafted Brown in the third round of the 1993 draft. The Vikings cut
Brown in training camp. Teerlinck, the Vikings defensive-line
coach, thought Brown was too fat and too slow to play Minnesota's
scheme. The Packers immediately claimed Brown off waivers.
<p>
   ``They never gave me a chance in Minnesota,'' Brown said.
``You've got to give a guy a chance. But that's all right. I'm
happy in Green Bay.''
<p>
   In Wisconsin, Brown is loved. Wisconsin Burger Kings sell the
``Gilbert Meal,'' a hamburger, fries and drink along with a poster
of Brown.
<p>
   ``It's a double Whopper with extra everything and no pickles,''
Brown said. ``It's got about four slices of cheese, extra lettuce,
mayo, mustard and everything. It takes more than two hands to
handle it. You gotta cut it in half to eat it.''
<p>
   It will be interesting to see whether the Patriots can handle
the ``Gilbert Meal'' they'll be forced to swallow Sunday.

<TEXT>
<p>
   PHOENIX  &MD;  The influence of health-maintenance organizations over
the state's insurance industry will be challenged in the state
Legislature by an unusual group: conservative Republicans.
<p>
   So intent are some GOP lawmakers on changing the habits of
insurers that they have introduced a half-dozen regulatory bills,
including one that would require employers to offer alternative
health plans, such as chiropractic, to their employees.
<p>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Ann Day, R-Tucson, introduced what many
believe will be the most popular and comprehensive of the bills,
one that would require HMOs to establish clearly understandable
guidelines for their coverage and create an appeals process for
people who are turned down for coverage.
<p>
   ``Health-care plans promise to deliver services, and this bill
is designed to keep them honest,'' Day said.
<p>
   Although Day's bill will likely headline the legislative agenda
on HMOs, a handful of related bills have begun to wend through the
process:
<p>
    &MD; House Bills 2051 and 2441 would require employers with HMOs to
give their employees the option of enrolling in alternative health
plans not available from the HMOs' enrolled physicians.
<p>
    &MD; House Bill 2064 would allow physicians who work for HMOs to
tell patients about any medical treatment they feel is appropriate.
<p>
    &MD;  House Bill 2245 would mandate that insurers provide coverage
for mental illnesses. This measure is being sponsored by Democratic
lawmakers.
<p>
   ``There is a concern out there,'' Day said, because ``health
insurance is a commodity  &MD;  the companies answer to stock markets,
they answer to Wall Street. And anytime you cut costs, it's going
to affect the quality of health care.
<p>
   ``This is the most important protection that consumers can
have.''
<p>
   Rep. Jim Weiers, R-west Phoenix, who sponsored one of the bills
that would give patients more options for treatment, said the rise
of HMOs in the insurance industry has squeezed the number of
choices offered to employees.
<p>
   ``HMOs, rather than the exception, have become the rule in terms
of coverage,'' Weiers said. ``In doing that, there's been a lot of
restrictions placed on personal choice.
<p>
   ``I don't see this as more regulation, it's just opening the
process to personal choice.''
<p>
   HMOs have a strong influence in the insurance industry in
Arizona, with 35 percent of the state's health-insurance business,
or 1.5 million patients.
<p>
   ``We're way ahead of the nation, and it's highly competitive
here,'' said Cathy Eden, executive director of the Arizona
Association of HMOs. ``It's the center of where most of the
innovative ideas are coming from.''
<p>
   During a hearing Tuesday on one of the regulatory bills, Eden
urged lawmakers to remain true to the GOP tradition of limited
government when contemplating the new regulations.
<p>
   ``When you are mandating the point-of-service (optional
treatment) plans, it's similar to mandating the automobile industry
to make a certain kind of car,'' she said.
<p>
   The rash of bills aimed at regulating HMOs has surprised even
some moderate Republicans.
<p>
   Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north-central Phoenix, although a co-sponsor
of the HMO grievance bill with Day, is fighting most of the other
bills.
<p>
   ``I find it fascinating that conservatives are pushing all these
mandates,'' Gerard said. ``I thought we all loved the marketplace
to do things.''
<p>
   Gerard said that the attempts at regulating HMO services are
ironic, given the state's unwillingness to mandate the provision of
insurance to all workers.
<p>
   ``We don't mandate that employers provide insurance to people,
so I can't understand how we can tell companies what they have to
have in the policies they're not required to provide in the first
place,'' Gerard said. ``That doesn't make any sense to me.''
<p>
   The unusual battle between the business community and the
Republican lawmakers that they normally court was visible Tuesday,
when freshman Rep. Debra Brimhall, R-Snowflake, peppered HMO
lobbyist Kevin DeMenna with questions.
<p>
   With some of the state's most powerful industry lobbyists
looking on, Brimhall needled DeMenna on his opposition to the bill
requiring employers to offer optional treatments.
<p>
   ``We're trying to address this problem,'' Brimhall said, ``and
while I understand your concerns, to me, if someone's in the water
drowning, telling them how to swim doesn't help.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Over the last 15 years, a self-made businessman from
New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to hospitals,
universities and other beneficiaries  &MD;  but has done it in such
absolute secrecy that most recipients never learned who their
benefactor was.
<p>
   The donor, Charles Feeney, 65, who made his fortune with a
string of duty-free airport shops, covered his tracks so well that
business magazines for years have estimated his net worth in the
billions, not realizing that he had transferred most of his assets
to his two charitable foundations and is actually worth less than
$5 million.
<p>
   After years of secrecy, Feeney agreed this week to discuss his
gifts because the duty-free empire was sold this month to the
company that makes Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne, and a lawsuit over the
sale would have revealed his anonymous donations.
<p>
   Feeney  &MD;  who has strong ties to Ireland and has made many gifts
there, including personal donations to Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing  &MD;  was matter-of-fact in describing why he had given
away his fortune. ``I simply decided I had enough money,'' he said.
``It doesn't drive my life. I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind
of guy.''
<p>
   While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of,
the scope and style of Feeney's giving, and his passion for total
secrecy, are rare, according to independent experts on
philanthropy. ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' said
Thomas Troyer, a senior partner in the law firm of Caplin &AMP;
Drysdale in Washington, who specializes in philanthropic law.
<p>
   Harvey Dale, a New York University tax law professor and
president of Feeney's Atlantic Foundation, who has helped Feeney
orchestrate his gifts since 1982, said: ``He doesn't own a house.
He doesn't own a car. He flies economy. And I think his watch cost
about $15.''
<p>
   It was Dale who helped Feeney set up his foundations, which like
his Duty Free Shoppes chain are based in Bermuda, thus avoiding the
disclosure requirements of private foundations in the United
States.
<p>
   From the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to Portland
State University in Oregon, none of the American recipients of
Feeney's largesse knew who their benefactor was. Grants were paid
by cashier's check to conceal the source. In fact, the
beneficiaries never realized that they owed their thanks to a
single giver  &MD;  they were told that the money came from several
generous ``clients'' who wished to remain anonymous.
<p>
   Few of the recipients had ever even met Dale or Joel Fleishman,
the president of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which actually
gave away the money on behalf of Feeney's two foundations, the
Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust.
<p>
   Dr. Robert Butler of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine said he
met Feeney in 1990 while making a proposal for funding to an
advisory board that reviewed grant proposals.
<p>
   ``I had no idea that he was the main supporter of what I call
the Anonymous Foundation,'' Butler said, adding that the grant was
made, starting the International Longevity Center at the New York
Academy of Medicine. ``Anonymous giving, giving that is not
dependent on ego, is just really rare.''
<p>
   Feeney said that by giving anonymously, he could go about his
life unhampered by pitches for donations. ``There are people who
want, and rightly deserve, recognition for giving, but in our case
it wasn't important,'' he said.
<p>
   In 1984, when Feeney gave his 38.75 percent interest in the Duty
Free Shoppes chain to the two foundations, even his partner, Robert
Miller, was not told. Now, proceeds from the sale of the chain
earlier this month, along with his other business assets, a total
of $3.5 billion, are owned by the foundations.
<p>
   Feeney's charitable enterprise would rank as the nation's
fourth-largest grant-making foundation if it were based in the
United States, yet the two groups operate with tiny staffs, just 20
professionals in the United States and overseas.
<p>
   Duty-Free Shoppes has sales of more than $3 billion annually,
mostly in liquors and luxury goods, more than the combined sales of
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman-Marcus.
<p>
   The foundation's largest single grant was $30 million, according
to Dale, who refused to identify the recipient on grounds that the
information might discourage other donors from supporting it. ``One
reason for keeping gifts anonymous is to avoid what we call this
`crowding out' effect,'' Dale said.
<p>
   Recipients were effusive in their praise for their anonymous
donor's style of giving and what it had enabled them to do. ``This
is operational support, the most valuable kind of assistance,''
said William Nelsen, president of the Citizens' Scholarship
Foundation of America, in St. Peter, Minnesota, which has received
support since 1984, one of the oldest recipients.
<p>
   Nelson said that the group, which mobilizes community groups to
raise money for college student aid, was able to significantly
expand its ``Dollars for Scholars'' program to reach 770 chapters
throughout the country, thanks in large part to Atlantic money,
which he said was more than a million dollars.

<p>
   ``As an organization, we've more than quadrupled in size since
getting support from this anonymous donor,'' Nelsen said.
<p>
   At the College Board, which administers scholastic assessment
tests for college-bound high school seniors, the mystery donor was
always referred to by the name ``anonymous,'' said Dr. Donald
Stewart, president of the College Board.
<p>
   ``Anonymous was most interested in results,'' Stewart said. The
anonymous donor supported ``long-term research to establish whether
we are right, which is crucial for the project's credibility and in
assessing whether schools should adopt the same approach,'' he
said.
<p>
   Several recipients said that once they were invited to apply for
funds their plans were closely examined. ``Ed McMahon did not knock
on my door,'' said Chuck Supple, president of Public Allies, which
places young people in internships with nonprofit organizations.
``These guys really kick the tires.''
<p>
   Judith Ramaley, president of Portland State University called
her first foundation grant last year her ``catalyst,'' financing of
less than one million dollars that enabled the school to publicize
its innovative new curriculum and links to the community, which
have now drawn national attention and the support of other
foundations. ``We were out of cash when they came along,'' she
said. ``They were the trail mix at that key moment on our very
steep hiking path,'' she said.
<p>
   Feeney's contributions in Ireland account for more than half of
Atlantic's international giving and about one-quarter of overall
giving. In addition to Ireland, the foundation supports projects in
South Africa, the former Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, Israel and
Jordan.
<p>
   There was less secrecy surrounding Feeney's activities in
Ireland. Several Irish university presidents and other
beneficiaries said they had met Feeney several times; they also
knew, they added, that he had a connection to the Atlantic
foundations.
<p>
   Feeney also said he had given substantial personal donations  &MD; 
not from the Atlantic foundations  &MD;  to the Washington office of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which
in 1994 entered into a cease fire with the British that broke down
last February. Public records show that Feeney has contributed some
$280,000  &MD;  making him the group's single largest American donor.
<p>
   Feeney said that his gifts to Sinn Fein had been carefully
monitored to insure that they supported only nonviolent activities,
and that he had continued supporting the Washington office despite
the cease-fire's collapse last February, ``because I'm hopeful that
it will be renewed.''
<p>
   The Atlantic Foundation's board of directors includes several
prominent personalities in the philanthropic and educational
establishment  &MD;  among them, Elizabeth McCormack, a senior adviser
on charitable giving to members of the Rockefeller family and vice
chairman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation;
Frank Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University, Michael
Sovern, president of the Shubert Foundation and president emeritus
of Columbia University, and Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., an attorney
and chairman of the Natural Resources Defense Council. None of them
had disclosed their connection with the Atlantic groups publicly,
nor did they ever discuss Feeney's giving with peers or even their
families, they said in interviews this week.
<p>
   ``This organization has operated on a need-to-know basis,''
Fleishman said.
<p>
   Most recipients  &MD;  a partial list of which was provided by APS  &MD; 
said their only contact was with program officers of the APS, the
for-profit group that selects the grantees, gives out the money,
and evaluates the outcome of what has been given away.
<p>
   Rhodes, the foundation board member and former president of
Cornell, said that the foundation was careful not to use money to
tell recipients what to do or how to do it. ``The danger with
foundations is that sometimes the staff and board come to feel that
they own the money,'' Rhodes said, ``and they micromanage. We have
a motto: noses in, fingers out.''
<p>
   Dale said of the relationship to grant recipients: ``We are
voyeurs. We let good people do good things. We oversee, but we
don't interfere.''
<p>
   And despite his decision finally to disclose his donations,
Feeney is still trying to keep a low profile. He declined this week
to be photographed.

<p>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 23:
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  New York state voters will be relieved to hear that
the Legislature has settled its lulu crisis. ``Lulu'' is an ancient
New York term that once meant payment in lieu of expenses, but now
refers to prized extra payments that the vast majority of
legislators get for leadership duties.
<p>
   Although the state Legislature is famous for concentrating
authority in a few hands, the monthly payroll boasts more leaders
than the Continental Congress.
<p>
   Gov. George Pataki sent Assembly Democrats into a fury last
month when he refused to reauthorize seven of these stipends, six
of which were supposed to go to Democrats. Rancor over the
reduction in lulus was so intense at the opening of the 1997
session that the governor skipped his traditional-but-futile calls
for bipartisan cooperation and on-time budgets.
<p>
   The Assembly Democrats are very sensitive about lulus because
virtually every other member of the entire Legislature gets a
leadership stipend. Every single member of the state Senate has a
leadership post, from the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno
($30,000), to the most humble member of the Democratic minority.
<p>
   The recently defeated Sen. Pedro Espada, a Bronx Democrat, for
instance, might have appeared to outsiders as a relatively
unsuccessful and anonymous junior member of the powerless
Democratic caucus. But in the land of the lulus, Espada bore the
proud title of assistant minority whip ($9,500).
<p>
   The Republican Assembly members have little or no impact on what
goes on in a body that is controlled by a Democrat, Speaker Sheldon
Silver. Nevertheless, all but three of them began the year with
leadership posts. Now that the governor has agreed to approve the
seven lapsed stipends, there will be one more job for a Republican
as ranking minority member of the Commission on Food, Farm and
Nutrition ($6,500), and the Assembly Republicans will have 52
chiefs and 2 followers.
<p>
   The plethora of leaders is one of those little ironies of Albany
life, like the fact that the nonpartisan Bill Drafting Commission
includes one commissioner and 100 workers controlled by each
political party. But the humor was lost on Silver when Pataki left
him with 96 members and only 62 leadership stipends to dole out.
<p>
   Democrats believe the governor's resistance to continuing the
lulus was a petty attempt to cause Silver to lose face. Republicans
say it was just an attempt to force the Democrats to act on other
pending bills.
<p>
   Either way, the crisis is over. The Legislature re-approved the
lulus this week, along with some other relatively non-controversial
bills Silver had been sitting on. Pataki has agreed to drop his

   That means the Assembly will once again have its $11,000 slot

   (NYT22) UNDATED -- Jan. 22, 1997 -- EXCLUSIVE-SECRET-BENEFACTOR,
1-22 -- Charles Feeney says his money does not drive his life. Over
the last 15 years, the self-made businessman from New Jersey has
given away more than $600 million to hospitals, universities and
other beneficiaries - but has done it in such absolute secrecy that
most recipients never learned who their benefactor was. (Paul

1-22 -- Amid a flurry of deals involving its rivals, Enterprise
Rent-a-Car remains in the hands of its founding family. Andrew
Taylor, the chief executive, says he is ``watching the frenzy with
fascination.'' Sticking close to the niche it developed - providing
rentals for customers whose cars are being repaired or who need an
extra car - Enterprise is No. 1 in fleet size and locations. (Peter

city of Elche wants to borrow the Lady of Elche, above, an ancient
stone bust, for an exhibit in this 15th-century castle, below, but
has been rebuffed by Madrid. Elche's request and Madrid's rebuff
are a slice of what is called the ``autonomy question,'' the
growing demand for status and power by the regions of Spain as they
reassert their historical and cultural identity. (Robert Royal/New

Aviv. Mordechai, 52, has emerged from the tumult of the last seven

culminated in a deal last week, to wrap up the security and civil
agreements. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York Times Photo)

win the support of American businessmen and to portray himself as
the one man who can lead Russia and pave the way for investment and
democratic reform there. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

<p>
   Charles F. Feeney, who secretly gave away a business enterprise
worth billions of dollars, said he never set out to build a
fortune, just to make a good living for his family. But as his
fortune grew, he said, he never forgot that the reason a poor boy
from Elizabeth, N.J., could make it through Cornell University was
the GI Bill and a scholarship in his senior year.
<p>
   In a rare interview this week, he did not mention that to make
ends meet in college he sold sandwiches late at night at fraternity
houses, a touch of the entrepreneurial spirit that later helped him
and a classmate found Duty Free Shoppers Group in 1960 and build it
into the world's largest chain of airport luxury goods stores.
<p>
   Feeney's partner, Robert W. Miller, responded to his wealth in
more conventional ways, adopting a life style famed in global
society circles for its multimillion-dollar, multiday parties.
<p>
   Feeney, meanwhile, started contemplating how to handle his
riches. ``The concept started in the '70s,'' he said in a telephone
interview, ``when I realized that I had made a substantial amount
of money and that the company was generating profits and it
certainly looked as though they would continue to be surplus to my
needs.''
<p>
   Feeney, 65, who favors casual clothes and calls himself a
``shabby dresser,'' said ``money has an attraction for some people,
but nobody can wear two pairs of shoes at one time.''
<p>
   The size of his fortune, he said, revealed only that ``we caught
a wave. We were lucky. We had more luck than we deserved.''
<p>
   As his fortune continued to balloon, he started talking with his
friend Harvey P. Dale, a lawyer, about how to make the best use of
his good fortune and keep his life simple.
<p>
   ``Chuck didn't want his money to crush him,'' Dale said.
<p>
   Feeney started making gifts. One of the first big ones was in
1981 for the 25th reunion of the class of 1956. Cornell University
expected the entire class to donate $250,000; Feeney gave $700,000.
<p>
   ``His gift completely changed fund-raising at Cornell, and so
whatever he has given he has really brought Cornell many times that
amount,'' a classmate said.
<p>
   Soon Feeney retreated from open donations, which invariably
attract requests for more, and three years later Dale created the
structures that allowed Feeney to remain anonymous. All he had to
do was make an irrevocable gift of his assets, now worth $3.5
billion, to his foundations, and do it in Bermuda to avoid
disclosure laws in the United States. So far, the foundations have
given away $610 million, including more than $50 million to
Cornell.
<p>
   One of his biggest gifts to Cornell helps students of modest
means pay down their student loans if they earn good grades, work
and volunteer.
<p>
   Feeney said that he retained enough money to take care of
himself, a sum he said was less than $5 million. He has set up
trusts for his five grown children, he said, ``with enough money
for what they should, and will, need in life.''
<p>
   ``My children are very kind and caring people who have genuine
friends,'' he said. ``People are not close to them because they
have a nicer summer home than someone else but because of who they
are.''
<p>
   Friends say that Feeney has a wicked sense of humor and loves
practical jokes. Soon after the foundations were created, the
trustees gathered in Bermuda, where Dale delivered a stern lecture
about the need for confidentiality. Dale was then summoned from the
room, he said, and when he returned, ``Chuck and the rest of the
trustees were all sitting there wearing those glasses with big
noses and moustaches, showing that they knew about being
anonymous.''
<p>
   Niall O'Dowd, a friend of Feeney who is publisher of The Irish
Voice and Irish America in New York City, said Feeney had told him
he was appalled by ``the competition that the Forbes 400 list
creates by people to get more and more.''
<p>
   ``Chuck thinks that is all wrong that people are looked up to
for how much money they accumulate,'' he said.
<p>
   At Feeney's foundations, the money all comes from him, but he
does not treat it as his own. ``He has one vote, just like every
other director,'' a fellow trustee said.

1-22 -- Charles Feeney says his money does not drive his life. Over
the last 15 years, the self-made businessman from New Jersey has
given away more than $600 million to hospitals, universities and
other beneficiaries - but has done it in such absolute secrecy that
most recipients never learned who their benefactor was. (Paul

1-22 -- Amid a flurry of deals involving its rivals, Enterprise
Rent-a-Car remains in the hands of its founding family. Andrew
Taylor, the chief executive, says he is ``watching the frenzy with
fascination.'' Sticking close to the niche it developed - providing
rentals for customers whose cars are being repaired or who need an

city of Elche wants to borrow the Lady of Elche, above, an ancient
stone bust, for an exhibit in this 15th-century castle, below, but
has been rebuffed by Madrid. Elche's request and Madrid's rebuff
are a slice of what is called the ``autonomy question,'' the
growing demand for status and power by the regions of Spain as they
reassert their historical and cultural identity. (Robert Royal/New

Aviv. Mordechai, 52, has emerged from the tumult of the last seven

culminated in a deal last week, to wrap up the security and civil
agreements. (Rina Castelnuovo/New York Times Photo)

-- Alexander Lebed, right, is greeted by Donald Trump at his Fifth
Avenue office. Lebed is in New York to court investors, but his

win the support of American businessmen and to portray himself as
the one man who can lead Russia and pave the way for investment and
democratic reform there. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

1-22 -- A new four-bedroom twin-gabled house in Mount Kisco is
solidly built but marred by some low-grade materials and mediocre
assembly that critics say is all too common in new construction. If
people with unlimited budgets cannot count on quality construction,
who can? (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

HENRY-GRUNWALD-PROFILE-2-CLR, 1-22 -- Henry Grunwald finds time for
Harry. Grunwald, one of Time magazine's most influential editors,
has written a very different book, interweaving descriptions of
public events with personal impressions, pushing himself through an

says. ``There are a great many people to whom conversation is
confession. To me, it isn't really.'' (Suzanne DeChillo/New York

<p>
    &LR; LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Facing competition from delivery pizza chains and
mom-and-pop pizzerias, the parent of Numero Uno bought a sandwich
fast food chain in Oregon to boost lunch hour business.
<p>
   N.U. Pizza Corp. finalized the purchase of Oregon's Original
Sandwich Express and Bakery chain, an upscale eatery with 10
franchisees. For $200,000, the pizza and pasta restaurateur got the
rights to the sandwich chain's name, franchise fees and a
manufacturing plant in Salem, Ore.
<p>
   N.U. Pizza will merge both restaurant concepts together in a new
eatery to be called Formaggi/Sandwich Express  &MD;  serving mainly
sandwiches for lunch and pizza and pasta for dinner. The company
will open them in Oregon.
<p>
   ``This the beginning of a very aggressive expansion program by
Numero Uno,'' said Ron Gelet, N.U. Pizza president Tuesday.
<p>
   The company plans to open 10 of the new style restaurants
initially in the Portland and Eugene area within 12 months. There
are no current plans to open one in California.
<p>
   ``By merging one concept into another and maybe taking the best
from both concepts, it's a lot less risky,'' said Janet Lowder,
president of Restaurant Management Service, a restaurant consulting
firm in Rancho Plos Verdes. ``If they implement it successfully,
they should do well.''
<p>
   Deborah Hill, the former president of Sandwich Express, will
head operations for a new subsidiary that will handle the Formaggi
restaurants.
<p>
   Sandwich Express contacted N.U. Pizza for the possibility of
being purchased after seeing an ad placed by the Valley firm
announcing its interest in making acquisitions, Gelet said.
<p>
   ``We were looking to develop a new dual concept,'' he said.
``When we saw that Sandwich Express was available, we realized that
it fit what we wanted to do almost to a T.''
<p>
   Eighty percent of Numero Uno's business came from its dinner
crowd, so the chain searched for a ``sandwich concept'' to increase
its lunch business. Gelet said Sandwich Express fit the bill since
it derives 80 percent of sales from its lunch patrons.
<p>
   Gelet said Numero Uno decided not to develop a sandwich shop
itself because it was more economical to buy an existing company.
<p>
   ``These are established stores, with cash flow and
profitability,'' he added.

 &UR; BEFORE SHOWBIZ BECAME JUST BIZ, THERE WAS COL. PARKER &QL;  &LR;

<TEXT>
<p>
   He was never a colonel and his name wasn't really Parker, but
Col. Tom Parker reigned supreme as rock 'n' roll's first great
impresario, a larger-than-life figure who lived up to his role as
manager of Elvis Presley.
<p>
   Parker, who died Tuesday at age 87 in his Las Vegas home, was an
old-fashioned show business wheeler-dealer capable of pulling out a
pair of dice during complex negotiations with film studio
executives and announcing, ``I'll roll you double or nothing.''
<p>
   He never really outgrew his early career as a carnival barker.
Even when he was managing the most popular artist in show business,
he still enjoyed fleecing suckers.
<p>
   When his client played Lake Tahoe showrooms in the early '70s
and women would snatch scarves off Elvis' neck as he leaned over
the front rows, Parker could be found outside after the show,
hawking identical-looking scarves for five bucks apiece.
<p>
   It wasn't the money  &MD;  he would lose tens of thousands of dollars
the same night at the roulette tables. Parker lived for the chisel.
<p>
   It was said he would make entire deals dependent on the other
party's giving up some personal token, say a prized ashtray, just
to make sure both men knew who got the better of whom.
<p>
   He was the sort of character people told outrageous stories
about, and some were even true. Parker never confirmed or denied
the story that circulated about his carnival attraction, Col.
Parker's Dancing Chickens  &MD;  reputedly nothing more than a cage full
of chickens on hot plates covered with sawdust  &MD;  but he clearly
loved the mystique such tales represented.
<p>
   He understood an antiquated world of show business. He knew tent
shows. He knew exposure. He knew promotion. He made Elvis' record
label, RCA Victor, print up a million pocket-size Elvis calendars
every year, then charged them royalties on the photo.
<p>
   He also masterminded one of the greatest publicity coups in the
history of the music business when he broadcast a 1973 Elvis
Presley concert from Hawaii around the world, for free in every
country of the world except one. In the United States, he let the
networks bid against one another to underwrite the vast venture.
<p>
   He also probably cost Presley millions of dollars in income with
his shortsighted, penny-wise dealings. But when a lawsuit between
the Presley estate and Parker revealed that his management
commissions ran as high as 50 percent, the consensus among industry
insiders was that Parker had earned it. Without his
often-dictatorial, certainly high-handed manipulations of his
client's career, Presley could have disappeared faster than Pat
Boone.
<p>
   In a 1988 book, ``Elvis and the Colonel,'' author Dirk Vellenga
alleged that Parker was actually an undocumented Dutch immigrant
born Andreas van Kuijk and that the reason Presley never accepted
any of the many lucrative offers to tour overseas was that Parker
couldn't obtain a passport.
<p>
   Right after Presley's death in 1977, Parker stayed busy,
continuing to promote and merchandise his client's career. He
remained very close to Presley's father, Vernon, although his
relations with Presley's ex-wife, Priscilla, who came to control
the estate after her former father-in-law's death, were not as
cordial.
<p>
   Soon Parker lost his power with both the estate and Presley's
record label, prowling the halls after hours, his rumpled clothes
and shuffling walk causing people often to mistake him for a
janitor. He split his time between his Palm Springs home and a
hotel suite in Las Vegas.
<p>
   Parker was a controversial man. Hank Snow, the country star
Parker managed before Presley, considered him an unscrupulous fake.
<p>
   But as the show business world changed radically around him, a
revolution he had no small part in creating, Parker remained an
intransigent, old-time hustler, a decidedly different sort of
person from the sharks in suits and ties who understand leveraged
buy-outs and making a fortune in turnaround. He was the anti-Mike
Ovitz.

 &UR; SIMPSON'S LAWYER ACCUSES PLAINTIFFS OF SEEKING MONEY, NOT JUSTICE &LR;  &QL; 
(sw) &QL; 
 &UR; By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR. &LR;  &QC;  &QL; 
 &UR; c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif.  &MD;  O.J. Simpson's lawyer asserted on
Wednesday that the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend
Ronald Goldman were seeking money, not justice, when they filed
their wrongful-death suit against the former sports and
entertainment personality.
<p>
   ``This isn't a fight for justice but a fight about Mr. Simpson
transferring dollars,'' the lawyer, Robert Baker, said in winding
up his defense of Simpson in the four-month-long civil trial.
<p>
   In any case, Baker said, the plaintiffs failed to make their
case, especially their promise to prove that Simpson killed Ms.
Simpson and Goldman in June 1994 in a rage after failing to
reconcile with his former wife.
<p>
   The case is set to go to the jury on Thursday.
<p>
   His final presentation sometimes rambling, sometimes tightly
focused and tinged with emotion, Baker said that in their effort to
wring money from Simpson, the plaintiffs' lawyers had ``twisted''
just about every fact and and every piece of testimony presented at
the trial.
<p>
   ``If you find him not responsible,'' Baker told the jury, ``the
gravy train is over.''
<p>
   In their suit, the plaintiffs left it up to jurors to fix the
amount of money Simpson should pay in recompense should they
conclude that he committed the killings.
<p>
   Baker argued that there was an ``enormous, gaping hole'' in the
case as presented by the plaintiffs' legal team, which wound up its
arguments earlier on Wednesday except for brief rebuttal on
Thursday.
<p>
   ``You can't put sympathy, passion and prejudice in your
verdict,'' Baker told the jury soon after the plaintiffs' lawyers
closed their arguments with poetic readings and saddening film and
sound bites of the murder victims.
<p>
   ``You have just been subjected to a ploy for your sympathy,''
Baker warned. ``We have witnessed character assassination. Give me
a break!''
<p>
   The plaintiffs' emotional arguments, he insisted, have failed to
make their case on a motive.
<p>
   ``There was no obsession,'' Baker insisted. ``That's a stretch,
a quantum leap. It's part of an effort by the plaintiffs to
demonize and manufacture a motive.''
<p>
   Then, arguing that Simpson could not have been at the crime
scene at the hour the plaintiffs had placed him, the lawyer offered
a bit of rhyme of his own.
<p>
   ``I'm no poet,'' he said, ``but obviously if you don't have time
you most certainly can't commit the crime.''
<p>
   Baker also argued that the plaintiffs had chosen to ignore
evidence offered by the defense team that the Los Angeles police
had bungled the Simpson investigation.
<p>
   ``They talk about the results of blood testing,'' he said,
sarcasm rising in his voice. ``We talk about contamination. What
did they do with that blood?''
<p>
   The earlier criminal trial, which ended in Simpson's acquittal
in October 1995, was tried along much the same lines as the civil
case and included occasional offerings of rhyme.
<p>
   Baker argued that police bungling, some of it perhaps
deliberate, had been a critical factor in the criminal case and
should also be a critical factor in the civil trial.
<p>
   ``I didn't hear one word about it from the plaintiffs,'' he
said, ``but it has been in this case from Day One. Police witnesses
have contradicted each other. They have lied from the witness
stand. There is an immense amount wrong with the evidence, and
that's not going to go away because they don't want to talk about
it.''
<p>
   Earlier in the day, as the plaintiffs' lawyers ended their
closing arguments  &MD;  except for final, brief rebuttal on Thursday  &MD; 
the lead member of the team, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that
Simpson's guilt could be proved very easily.
<p>
   ``One drop of blood,'' he said, referring to analysis of blood
found at the slaying scene that indicated it had come from Simpson.
<p>
   ``You don't need any more than that,'' Petrocelli went on. ``He
is guilty. He is the killer. And he's got nowhere to run anymore.''
<p>
   Still, he presented more, including a list of some 60 witnesses
and documents that he argued would all have to be found to be
either liars or fakes in order for Simpson to be cleared. ``For him
to be believed,'' he said of Simpson, ``you have to disbelieve all
of it.''
<p>
   Noting that the jury, should it find Simpson guilty, would then
determine how much money he should pay the families of the victims
in recompense, he said:
<p>
   ``There is no amount of money that is ever going to repay for
what has been lost. True justice would be to see Ron Goldman walk
through the doors of this courtroom and to see Nicole Simpson
playing again with her children.''
<p>
   He paused, then turned from the jury and stared at Simpson.
<p>
   ``But that's not going to happen, not going to happen,''
Petrocelli said, pointing an accusatory finger.
<p>
   Simpson stared back, his face an impassive mask.
<p>
   Petrocelli was not through. The oversized television screen next
to the bench came alive with a Goldman family video of a festive
gathering some months before Ronald Goldman was slain.
<p>
   Petrocelli began to recite from a 16th-century poem by Guillame
DuBartas. ``My lovely, living boy,'' he said, ``my home, my
happiness, my love, my life, my joy.''
<p>
   As a final image of Ronald and Fred Goldman froze on the screen,
the father hung his head, tears rolling down his cheeks. ``Fred
Goldman's lovely, living boy is no more,'' Petrocelli said, and sat
down.

 &UR; LICENSING DIVISION OFFICER IS SUSPENDED &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  The commanding officer of the police department's
licensing division, which is responsible for issuing pistol permits
and gun licenses, was suspended without pay Wednesday after he was
accused of doing favors for friends, police said.
<p>
   Deputy Inspector Henry M. Krantz was charged with violating
police department rules against giving people preferential
treatment, rendering services for private interests and ordering
subordinates to provide preferential treatment, said Deputy
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman.
<p>
   At this point, Krantz only faces internal police department
charges, and the most severe punishment he could face is the loss
of his job. He has not been arrested on any criminal charges,
police said.
<p>
   ``We would have to arrest him if he did it for personal gain,''
Collins said.
<p>
   Krantz, a 30-year veteran of the force, did not respond to calls
to his Westchester County home for comment on the case. Police said
he was suspended as a result of an ongoing investigation into the
licensing division that resulted in seven departmental charges
being filed against him. They did not say what kind of favors he
was accused of doing.
<p>
   The licensing division has been the subject of a federal inquiry
since November, when the bigamy case of a gun dealer raised
allegations of improprieties in the issuance of licenses.
<p>
   The police department's licensing division weighs applications
from New Yorkers who want to own handguns. Under state law, people
must apply to their counties for handgun licenses, and the New York
City Police Department is in charge of issuing pistol permits in
the city's five counties.
<p>
   A high-ranking police official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity speculated that Krantz may have helped ``move friends to
the front of the line'' so they could get quick approval.
<p>
   In addition to being charged with giving preferential treatment
and ordering his subordinates to give preferential treatment, he
was accused of failing to adequately supervise the officers under
his command.

 &UR; WEST POINT RAPE TRIAL FOCUSES ON FEMALE CADET'S DRINKING &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (bl) &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BRUNI &LR;  &QC;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   WEST POINT, N.Y.  &MD;  Testimony in the court-martial here of a male
cadet charged with raping a female classmate focused Wednesday on
the questions of precisely how drunk the 20-year-old woman was and,
by implication, whether she had the ability to consent to a sexual
act.
<p>
   Prosecutors sought to prove that at a party the two cadets
attended last Memorial Day weekend at a vacation cottage in
Stockholm, N.J., the young woman was virtually incoherent, flopping
against people and bumping into furniture.
<p>
   But the attorneys defending the accused cadet, James P.
Engelbrecht, a 22-year-old senior at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, elicited confirmation from witnesses that Engelbrecht,
having retreated to a bunk bed in a back room of the cottage early
that night, did not see the signs that the woman was severely
intoxicated.
<p>
   Defense attorneys also elicited observations from witnesses that
the young woman was acting flirtatiously with various people at the
party, testimony clearly meant to bolster Engelbrecht's contention
that the woman came to his bed and initiated a sexual encounter.
<p>
   And it became clear that the decision of the all-male jury of
seven senior Army officers could boil down a delicate question of
law: If a woman is too drunk to know what she is doing, but a man
is not aware of that, can he be guilty of rape? Military
regulations suggest that he can, but the military judge's
instructions to the jury on the point will be crucial.
<p>
   Witnesses said the young woman drank steadily through the
evening of May 24 and into the early hours of May 25, which was her
birthday.
<p>
   ``At one point, it looked like she was going to walk into a
wall,'' said Jenny A. Ligon, a college student in Lubbock, Texas,
who attended the party. At another point, Ms. Ligon testified, ``I
was concerned because it looked like she was going to throw up.''
<p>
   But Daniel D. Cox said he saw Engelbrecht and the woman together
in the top of a bunk bed at about 1:30 a.m., and that the woman
seemed fully conscious.
<p>
   Cox and other witnesses also affirmed that there was somebody in
the bottom bunk of the bedroom all night long, and that people
wandered into the room, details relevant to a second charge against
Engelbrecht for committing an indecent act.
<p>
   Under military law, having sex with someone in a place where
others might be present constitutes an indecent act.
<p>
   Other witnesses vouched for the the fact that the woman was a
virgin before that night.
<p>
   The woman's sister recounted getting a call from her less than
12 hours after the incident and wishing her a happy birthday. ``I
said, `How does it feel to be the only 20-year-old virgin on the
face of the earth?' '' the sister recalled. The cadet immediately
burst into tears, she said.

   TRENTON, N.J.  &MD;  It was a routine morning in Gov. Christie
Whitman's office Tuesday until an excited secretary Mrs. Whitman's
chief spokeswoman, Becky Taylor, that actress Whoopi Goldberg was
on the line.
<p>
   Goldberg was calling to make sure the governor's office knew
that she had not asked for a State Police escort along the New
Jersey Turnpike on Sunday. Goldberg was being driven from New York
City to Washington to participate in pre-inaugural activities that
evening.
<p>
   Fearing she would be late, a member of the inaugural committee
asked the State Police in New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland for
escorts to expedite her trip. The Delaware and Maryland police
obliged. But the New Jersey State Police did not, saying it was not
a public safety matter.
<p>
   ``I called the governor's office to make sure that they stop
saying that I made the request,'' Ms. Goldberg said.

DUNCAN WAITING TO BE TOP PICK &QL;

<p>
   It's the halfway mark of the college basketball season, which
means the nation's top players have taken a focused and
single-minded approach to the remainder of the season.
<p>
   Are they thinking of winning their conference championship?
Nope.
<p>
   Projecting how many victories are necessary to obtain a coveted
bid to the NCAA Tournament? Wrong.
<p>
   What are they pondering?
<p>
   Um, well, it's a simple question really.
<p>
   ``Where will I be drafted?''
<p>
   Most players have only 14 games or so to prove themselves before
the NBA firms up its opinions.
<p>
   If you're Wake Forest's Tim Duncan, none of this matters. He is
the franchise and just marking time until he is the No.1 pick.
<p>
   But others, like USC's Rodrick Rhodes, have seen their stock
drop because of injuries.
<p>
   The rest are jockeying for position. According to NBA scouts and
college basketball analysts, here are the top 10 picks, if the
draft were held today (players with an asterisk are underclassmen):
<p>
   1. &UR; !off! &LR;  Tim Duncan, 6-11 center, Wake Forest.
<p>
   2. &UR; !off! &LR;  Keith Van Horn, 6-9 forward, Utah.
<p>
   3. &UR; !off! &LR;  Ron Mercer, 6-7 forward, Kentucky.
<p>
   4. &UR; !off! &LR;  Paul Pierce, 6-6 forward, Kansas.
<p>
   5. &UR; !off! &LR;  Danny Fortson, 6-7 forward, Cincinnati.
<p>
   6. &UR; !off! &LR;  Alexander Koul, 7-1 center, George Washington.
<p>
   7. &UR; !off! &LR;  Jacque Vaughn, 6-1 guard, Kansas.
<p>
   8. &UR; !off! &LR;  Chauncey Billups, 6-3 guard, Colorado.
<p>
   9. &UR; !off! &LR;  Cory Carr, 6-4 guard, Texas Tech.
<p>
   10. &UR; !off! &LR;  Danya Abrams, 6-7 forward, Boston College.
<p>
   Of course, a January list can undergo wholesale changes by June.
We'd put the Collins twins on this list, but then it would really
be a mock draft.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Kerplunk: How did Oregon collapse so fast in barely three
weeks? The Ducks were flying high at 10-0, ranked in the top 25 and
primed to challenge for the Pac-10 title. Here's one reason:
<p>
   The Ducks played only three games that required stepping onto an
airplane in their first 10.
<p>
   They also played way too many state teams. They defeated Boise
State, Cleveland State, Portland State and San Diego State.
Portland State is in the first year of resurrecting its program and
has won only three games.
<p>
   This helps explain how Oregon got swept in Washington, then lost
both home games to Stanford and Cal.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Good but not great: Kentucky coach Rick Pitino has bemoaned
the lack of elite teams this season and no one could present a
compelling argument otherwise.
<p>
   ``I don't think there are too many great teams,'' Pitino said.
``Kansas is great. I don't know about Cincinnati. They could be.
Wake Forest is great. Outside of that ...
<p>
   ``Kansas has all the answers. With Wake Forest, if they can slow
down the game, they've got all the answers. With the others, can we
have the answers come March? Who's going to improve the most?''
<p>
   Pitino needs to find an answer for losing point guard Derek
Anderson, the Southeastern Conference's leading scorer. He
completely tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee against
Auburn last Saturday.
<p>
   A fifth-year senior, Anderson's college career is over.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Bartow Arena: Former UCLA coach Gene Bartow will have the
on-campus facility at Alabama-Birmingham named after him in a
ceremony Saturday. Bartow, who retired after last season after
building the Blazers' program, was chiefly responsible for the
arena, after his teams played downtown for years.
<p>
   Now all that's left is some sort of tribute from UCLA. Just
kidding.
<p>
   !arrow!Local watch:!off! Former Cleveland star Shawn Bankhead is
No.14 Iowa State's second-leading scorer, averaging 11.3 points per
game.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Marquee matchup: While the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday
Challenge received most of the publicity, Monday's best individual
prep matchup took place at UC Irvine.
<p>
   Woodbridge's 6-foot-11 forward Chris Burgess outdueled Villa
Park's 7-1 center Eric Chenowith. Burgess, who is going to Duke,
had 30 points and four 3-pointers. Chenowith, who will attend
Kansas, had 18 points and six rebounds.
<p>
   Woodbridge defeated Villa Park 71-56.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Pipe dream: Those few die-hard USC basketball fans who exist
have a plan for the Trojans to become a top-25 program, and not
surprisingly, it involves the football team.
<p>
   The theory starts with USC getting a commitment from 6-7 forward
Ryan Humphrey of Oklahoma, considered one of the top tight ends in
the country. Humphrey has narrowed his choices to Kansas, USC and
Michigan.
<p>
   The Trojans would then follow that up with a commitment next
year from Dominguez's 6-4 quarterback, Jason Thomas, who scored 33
points in the Dons' victory over Crenshaw on Monday. Thomas wants
to play both sports in college and is considered exceptional in
football and basketball.
<p>
   Then comes the real coup. Thomas' teammate and close friend
Tayshaun Prince, considered the best junior in the state, joins him
at Troy.
<p>
   Again, it's only a theory.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Here he comes: Oregon State freshman Corey Benjamin of
Fontana is finally living up to his potential after becoming
eligible last month. Benjamin averaged 28.5 points and 5.0 rebounds
in the Beavers' split with the Bay Area schools.
<p>
   The Beavers are relying on freshmen. In their upset of Stanford,
Benjamin had 26 points and fellow freshmen Ron Grady and Carson
Cunningham had 24 and 18.

Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is seeking a buyer for its Brittania line of
apparel, a brand that has never regained the luster it achieved
among jeans-wearing teen-age girls during the 1970s. &HT;    Citing a decision to concentrate on its core business of more
upscale clothing, San Francisco-based Levi's said it has asked
Morgan Stanley to peddle Brittania Sportswear Ltd., which it
acquired a decade ago.

<p>
   ``When (Levi's) bought it, it was a terminal case, and they've
never been able to get it off the ground,'' said Alan Millstein,
president of Fashion Network Report in New York.
<p>
   ``It's not a designer name, it has no sex appeal, and probably
they don't want to put big advertising dollars behind it, which
would be the only way they could sustain it,'' he added.
<p>
   Brittania once was a leading department store brand but now is
sold by mass merchants such as Kmart.
<p>
   Millstein said the brand has faced growing competition in recent
years from low-priced, in-house casual labels such as J.C. Penney's
Arizona and Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Canyon River Blues.
<p>
   Levi's spokesman Vada Manager said Brittania has been ``a
success'' for the company, though he declined to comment on
Brittania's earnings or profitability.
<p>
   Manager said Levi's decided to sell Brittania so that the
company could focus on its three core brands: Levi's, Dockers and
Slate, a dress pant introduced last year.
<p>
   ``We believe Brittania could be viable as a stand-alone business
and has a future in the mass-market area,'' Manager said. However,
Target stores, one of Brittania's major retailers, has been phasing
out sales of the brand for several months.
<p>
   Another big outlet, Kmart, said it's uncertain whether it will
continue to carry Brittania, its second-largest line of denim
clothing after Wrangler (for men) and Chic (for women).
<p>
   Brittania produces jeans for men and women. It also makes men's
and boys' casual pants and tops, leather accessories, socks, shoes,
underwear, outerwear, watches and fleece.
<p>
   The clothes are sold under the label ``Brittania by Levi's,''
indicating that Levi's attempted to capitalize on the cachet of its
name without selling its core products in discount stores.
<p>
   Brittania was purchased by Levi's in 1987 from Asian Pacific
Industries, which at the time was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings.
<p>
   Today, Brittania employs 120 people.

   Manila, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Petron Corp., the
Philippines largest oil refiner, rose as much as 8.2 percent to
10.50 pesos after President Ramos yesterday ordered full
deregulation of the oil industry by Feb. 8.
<p>
   ``This is news to the market,'' said Gina Dipaling, analyst for
Philippine Asia Equity Securities Inc. ``Full deregulation has been
advanced by a month.''
<p>
   The oil deregulation law stipulates that the government has to
lift all price controls on petroleum products by March this year.
The government advanced the deadline to prevent another deficit in
a state fund used to stabilize consumer fuel prices.
<p>
   With full deregulation, Petron and its rivals - Pilipinas Shell
Petroleum Corp. and Caltex Philippines Inc. - will be free to price
their products.
<p>
   The oil refiners had complained that they were unable to fully
recover costs and maintain profit margins under the present system,
wherein prices are dictated by a formula linked to Singapore
postings.

OAKMONT IS LIKE HOME TO KLEIN &QL; 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &QL;

<p>
   Mother Nature took her shot at Oakmont Country Club two weeks
ago. Next month, the LPGA Tour will have a go at it.
<p>
   Look for Oakmont to survive again.
<p>
   A violent early-January windstorm knocked out 52 trees,
including some nearly 150 years old. But the 68-year-old Glendale,
Calif., course is expected to play as tough as ever when the
$650,000 Los Angeles Women's Championship is held there Feb. 14-16.
<p>
   ``I don't think you'll see very low scores,'' said Emilee Klein,
the former Notre Dame High School star who won back-to-back LPGA
events last year and who grew up playing at Oakmont.
<p>
   ``You'll probably have a couple of girls shoot under par but not
much under par.''
<p>
   Jan Stephenson, who will join Klein in the 144-player field at
the L.A. Women's Championship, can attest to Oakmont's difficulty.
Stephenson called the Glendale course the toughest the LPGA played
in 1985, when her winning total of 2-over par there was highest on
tour that year.
<p>
   During the three years the LPGA played at Oakmont from 1985-87,
only !ital!three!off! players completed a tournament under par
there.
<p>
   ``If you don't really think and use your head, it will eat you
up,'' Klein said. ``I consider it a U.S. Open-type of golf
course.''
<p>
   She said many of the tour players are looking forward to playing
on the 6,413-yard, par-72 hillside layout, where narrow, tree-lined
fairways and fast, difficult greens make any score near par an
accomplishment.
<p>
   ``Everyone is excited to come here,'' Klein said, ``because it
is such a fabulous course. We don't get to play courses like
Oakmont as often as we'd like to.''
<p>
   Klein, who went from Notre Dame to earn NCAA Player of the Year
honors as a sophomore at Arizona State in 1995, said her early
experiences at Oakmont played a large role in her success.
<p>
   ``The greens are tricky, the rough is tough and anyone who plays
the course regularly has to be a better golfer when you get on an
easier course,'' said Klein, who now lives in Florida.
<p>
   ``Oakmont was the main reason I play so well.''
<p>
   Klein's memories of the Glendale course include playing there
every day after school with her father, learning to compete and
visualize.
<p>
   ``When I'd stand on the range there, I'd think I was making the
last shot on 18 or the putt to win the U.S. Open or one of the
majors,'' she said.
<p>
   She got a taste of fulfilling her dream last summer, when she
won the women's British Open one week after shooting a
personal-best 65 in the final round to win the Ping Welch
Championship.
<p>
   ``The first was a great win and I felt really excited,'' Klein
said. ``But the second one meant more because it proved I was here
for real.''
<p>
   She added more proof in the final 1996 tournament, battling
Rookie of the Year Karrie Webb into the last round of the inaugural
LPGA Tour Championship before losing by four strokes.
<p>
   Klein finished the year No.9 on the money list with $463,793 and
could earn more next month at Oakmont, where her local knowledge
should be a big advantage.
<p>
   No matter what, she's going to enjoy the homecoming.
<p>
   ``I've had a lot of really great times at Oakmont,'' she said.
``It was a great place to golf. It's one of the fabulous courses  &MD; 
you really have to think about your game.''
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Sorenstam at Oakmont: Two-time defending women's U.S. Open
champion Annika Sorenstam, who started this season by winning the
LPGA Tournament of Champions, will compete in the L.A. Women's
Championship at Oakmont.
<p>
   She is one of several top-20 players who have committed,
including Liselotte Neumann, Val Skinner, Pat Bradley, Rosie Jones,
Patty Sheehan, Meg Mallon and local favorite Klein. Past champions
Stephenson, Chris Johnson ('86) and Jane Geddes ('87) also are
entered.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  More wind: The Scholl Canyon driving range, located on a
hilltop in east Glendale, is open for business again after being
knocked out of action for a second straight year by a January
windstorm.
<p>
   Last year, Scholl lost its entire near-60-foot-high, right-side
protective fence when telephone pole-wide supports were snapped
like toothpicks at about four feet high by winds estimated near 100
miles per hour. This year, the course had much of its left-side
fence knocked out during the windstorm that uprooted trees at
nearby Oakmont.
<p>
    &MD;  &MD;  Looking ahead: Stewart Cink and David Berganio, both up from
last year's Nike Tour, made the cut in last week's tour-opening Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic.
<p>
   Cink, winner of last year's Nike Tour championship, tied for
ninth at 21 under par. Berganio, the Alemany High School alumnus
who won two U.S. Public Links titles and placed 16th in last year's
U.S. Open, shot 9-under to finish 66th at the Hope. Both players
have full exemptions for this year's tour.

   UNIONDALE, N.Y.  &MD;  Maybe it was Monday afternoon's after-game
practice. Whatever it was, New York Islanders coach and general
manager Mike Milbury ought to bottle it.
<p>
   Two days after the Islanders played what Milbury called their
worst game of the season, prompting him to punish them with a
44-minute ``conditioning'' skate, the Islanders played one of their
best games Wednesday night, routing the Edmonton Oilers by 8-1
before 10,438 delighted fans at Nassau Coliseum.
<p>
   The victory was just the Islanders' third in their last 15 games
(3-11-1). The eight goals tied the highest total the Islanders have
scored in a game this season, and the margin of victory was their
biggest this year.
<p>
   Derek King scored two goals, and Bryan McCabe, Zigmund Palffy,
Marty McInnis, Derek Armstrong, Paul Kruse and Steve Webb (the
first of Webb's National Hockey League career) had the rest as the
Islanders scored seven unanswered goals in the final 30 minutes 50
seconds of the game.
<p>
   It was a rare outburst, especially for the goaltender Eric
Fichaud, who entered the game with the Islanders averaging just
2.17 goals when he starts (the lowest amount of support for any
goaltender in the NHL.)

 &UR; BILL GIVES BALLOT VOICE FOR `NONE OF THE ABOVE' &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; c.1997 The Arizona Republic &LR;  &QC; 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   When Election Day approaches, lots of voters talk of holding
their noses and voting for the candidate who least offends them.
<p>
   The voters write to the newspapers, call the radio stations and
tell their friends, ``They're all crooks anyway. Why vote?''
<p>
   State Sen. Randall Gnant wants to give those disaffected folks a
voice.
<p>
   He wants a new line on the ballot in Arizona elections that
would permit voters to check off ``None of the above.''
<p>
   And if ``None of the above'' wins, another election would be
held. The candidates who ran the first time and were shunned by the
public would be barred from running in the new election.
<p>
   ``You could tell the political parties, `We don't like your
candidates. Try again,' '' Gnant said.
<p>
   Other lawmakers are calling his idea silly and cynical, but
Gnant, a second-term Republican from north Scottsdale, breaks into
a mirthful grin whenever he thinks about it.
<p>
   ``I'm dead serious.''
<p>
   By Gnant's reasoning, the change would prove that the public was
not as disenchanted as pundits seem to think.
<p>
   ``I believe `None of the above' would only win in a minuscule
number of elections,'' Gnant said. ``I think people are less
disenchanted with the process than some of the heated voices would
have us believe.''
<p>
   Voters in Nevada can mark ``None of the above'' on ballots, but
the results are non-binding, said Steve Lilienthal, state policy
director of the Washington, D.C.-based Free Congress Foundation,
which supports ideas that give voters a more direct voice in
decision-making.
<p>
   ``It is sort of a free-market approach to improving campaigns,''
Lilienthal said. ``If people start voting for `None of the above,'
politicians might start taking notice. Just the threat of it might
be incentive enough to change the way campaigns are run, make them
cleaner and more directed to issues.''
<p>
   Of course, there are some who don't see the humor.
<p>
   Sen. Tom Freestone, R-Mesa, said he thinks it would become
another tool for bashing government.
<p>
   ``It cheapens the process,'' Freestone said. ``You put anything
out that is anti-government, and people will vote for it. Then,
they complain that the government isn't there for them.''
<p>
   Lisa Daniel, the state elections director, said she thinks the
embarrassment of losing to ``None of the above'' would discourage
people from running.
<p>
   ``To think that you would work your heart out, raise money, get
a plurality of votes, and then not be able to take office, it seems
like that would be heartbreaking. I don't know who would run for
office.''
<p>
   Then, there would be the cost of holding additional elections. A
statewide election could cost more than $1 million, Daniel said.
<p>
   Also, legislation approved last year allows elections to be held
on only four dates during the year, one day each in March, May,
September and November, so second elections would be difficult to
schedule.
<p>
   None of this discourages Gnant. In fact, he's got more
mischief-making dancing around in his head.
<p>
   He has introduced another bill that would invalidate all
election results in school districts and special taxing districts,
such as irrigation districts, unless the turnout was at least 20
percent.
<p>
   ``That would force them to actually advertise their elections,''
Gnant said. ``There are companies that are paid to consult on how
to keep turnouts low. That is a corruption of the process.''
<p>
   And there is another idea: Gnant would like to set up ballots so
they would list the candidates' names, then have a ``yes'' or
``no'' next to each candidate. The voter would be allowed to mark
only one box.
<p>
   Under this plan, the voter would have to say whether he or she
was voting affirmatively for one candidate or against the candidate
they disliked.
<p>
   ``In theory, someone could be elected with negative votes,''
Gnant said. ``Now wouldn't that send a message? Wouldn't that be
fun?''

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  It took 42 rewrites, but Sens. Jon Kyl and Dianne
Feinstein say the victims-rights bill they introduced Tuesday has a
strong chance of becoming an amendment to the Constitution.
<p>
   It's the second time around for the bill. The original,
introduced last April, got as far as a hearing but then expired
without a vote at the end of Congress' session.
<p>
   ``I don't think there was major criticism of the original
bill,'' Kyl, R-Ariz., said at a news conference Wednesday at the
Capitol. ``But when you amend the Constitution, you want to make
sure you have it right.''
<p>
   Only minor changes in wording were made in the many drafts, but
the alterations were designed to stave off criticism from lawmakers
who oppose any change to the Constitution.
<p>
   House sponsorship from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the respected
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is likely to enhance its
chances. President Clinton and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, also support the measure. It would take
affirmative votes from both houses of Congress and ratification by
38 states to be adopted as an amendment.
<p>
   Arizona and 27 other states already have similar constitutional
amendments. Feinstein, a California Democrat, said that although
those laws are individually beneficial, collectively they have
created a patchwork quilt that can be solved only with a
constitutional amendment.
<p>
   ``Victims should have certain rights guaranteed to them under
the Constitution of the United States. What could be wrong with
that?'' Feinstein said. ``The scales of justice today are weighted
too heavily to the rights of the accused.''
<p>
   The bill would guarantee that crime victims be informed of their
rights, of any proceedings in their case and of any escape by the
suspect. They would be assured a right to speak in the case,
granted restitution and guaranteed speedy results.
<p>
   Although the legal language guaranteeing victims' rights may
sound dry, the issue can be an emotional one.
<p>
   In a quiet voice and in tears, Marsha Kight, the mother of
Frankie Merrell, who was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing, told
of the anguish that families faced when a judge ruled that they
could either attend the suspects' trial or testify at sentencing,
but not both. It was a decision they all were forced to make on a
lunch break, she said.
<p>
   ``It would seem that the defendants are the preferred ones, with
all the rights, while the victims are constantly re-victimized by
the judicial system,'' she said. ``There are lessons to be learned
here if we are listening. If not from Oklahoma City, than what?
Who's next? Your child?''

<p>
   Manila, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Philippine stocks rose for the
first time in four days, led by oil refiner Petron Corp., after the
government said it would advance the deregulation of the oil
industry by one month.
<p>
   President Fidel Ramos signed an order freeing the industry from
more than two decades of price controls that often prevented oil
companies from recovering higher costs. The order takes effect Feb.
8.
<p>
   ``We're betting that deregulation will be a major boost for
Petron,'' said Alvin Ang, an analyst at All AsiaCapital and Trust
Corp. ``It's the largest in the market and so far there are no new
companies coming in'' to the deregulated industry.
<p>
   Petron, with a market share of 41 percent, rose as much as 8.25
percent to 10.50 pesos. It has a 5.4 percent weighting in the
benchmark index and was the second most active stock.
<p>
   Ang said Petron's shares could rise to 12 pesos by around March
because the company can start charging more.
<p>
   Petron's advance helped drive the 30-company Philippine Stock
Exchange composite index to as high as 3333.92, up 58.09 points or
1.77 percent from yesterday's close. The all-shares index
comprising 255 issues rose 10.18 points to 1061.69.
<p>
   Ayala Land Inc., the largest property developer, rose as much as
05.0 peso to 31.50. Ayala Land's parent, Ayala Corp., won one of
two concessions to run the country's largest water utility.
<p>
   Ayala's clinching of a 25-year contract to operate the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System ends a string of
defeats in bidding for high-profile government asset sales.
<p>
   Bank of the Philippine Islands, the Ayala group's bank, rose as
much as 5 pesos to 175 after announcing that profit in 1996 doubled
to 3.99 billion pesos.
<p>
   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. rose as much as 25 pesos
to 1,580 after its U.S.-traded shares rose $1.75 to 59. Some
investors believe that the phone company will be granted increases
in local rates that will offset declining international calling
rates.
<p>
   Philippine Asia Equity Securities Inc. estimates that if PLDT
gets the rate increase, forecasted earnings per share will go up
about 4 percent.

<p>
   The Gila River and Ak-Chin Indian communities filed a federal
suit Wednesday against state gaming Director Gary Husk, claiming
the state is overcounting video-gaming machines in their casinos
south of Phoenix.
<p>
   The state's motives, Gila River Gov. Mary Thomas says, are more
sinister than just counting machines.
<p>
   ``It is now obvious that the Arizona Department of Gaming is
determined to try to take over, or worse, end Indian gaming in
Arizona,'' Thomas said.
<p>
   Husk denies that.
<p>
   Central to the dispute are multiplayer gaming devices in which
five machines are joined in one circular pod. In past gaming
compacts with the state, the tribes say, each pod was counted as
one gaming device, but now Husk is counting each machine
individually.
<p>
   By the state's count, Husk said, the Gila River Casino is 36
machines over its maximum of 500 and Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino is
slightly over its ceiling of 475, as agreed to in their compacts
with the state. The Gila River Community also has another, smaller
casino and is allowed a total of 900 gaming devices under its
compact.
<p>
   ``We feel that we are in compliance because the state signed off
on counting each multiplayer device as one,'' said Carol Jackson,
spokeswoman for the Gila River community. ``Why can't the state
admit that it made a mistake?''
<p>
   Jacob Coin, executive director of the Arizona Indian Gaming
Association, agrees.
<p>
   ``When is an agreement with the state an agreement?'' Coin
asked. ``Not only is this a slap in the tribes' face but it once
again says the state cannot be trusted when it comes to its
agreements with tribes.''
<p>
   Husk said he welcomes the lawsuit because ``it's very important
that this fundamental issue of what constitutes a gaming device be
clarified.'' Husk said three other tribes with casinos  &MD;  Fort
McDowell, White Mountain Apache and Quechan  &MD;  had agreed
voluntarily to count each machine as one, regardless of how they
were placed in their gaming buildings.
<p>
   ``Every other state that has gaming counts machines based on the
number of stations. Las Vegas does it for taxing purposes,'' Husk
said.

    &LR; LOS ANGELES  &MD;  Entertainment production activity in Los Angeles
County jumped 29.4 percent last year due to an across-the-board
surge in the industry and aided by a streamlined permitting
process, an industry tracker reported Wednesday.
<p>
   Last year's activity was spurred partly by five big-budget
features, laden with special effects, being shot in the county for
release in 1997: Warner's ``Batman and Robin,'' Universal's
``Dante's Peak,'' Paramount's ``The Flood,'' 20th Century Fox's
``Volcano'' and Sony's ``Starship Troopers.''
<p>
   ``We have been seeing days when all 250 production crews
available in the county are being used,'' said Cody Cluff,
president of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. ``It's
not uncommon for crews to be shooting within sight of each other.''
<p>
   The gain follows a 27 percent increase from 1994 to 1995 in
production days, which include film, commercials, television, music
and still photography.
<p>
   In response to the release of the figures, Noelia Rodriguez,
spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan, said ``Two thumbs up.''
<p>
   ``This is the return on the investment the mayor made a couple
of years ago when he advocated combining the county and city film
offices,'' she said. ``We should also congratulate the EIDC for its
hard work and making sure there are not only lights and cameras,
but action on the streets of Los Angeles.''
<p>
   The Entertainment Industry Development Corp. was formed in 1995
as a merged entity of the county and city film permit offices to
help promote increased local production and convince producers to
shoot in the region rather than locales that have been wooing the
industry, such as Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Seattle and the
Carolinas. The agency, which has a staff of 25 and receives an
average of 1,800 calls per day, bills its ``one-stop'' permitting
as a key factor in retaining production.
<p>
   Cluff said the time it takes to issue a permit has fallen
sharply in recent years from two days in 1993 to less than four
hours in 80 percent of current productions.
<p>
   Michael Walbrecht, director of studio and production affairs for
Warner Bros., said the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. has
been particularly effective in playing a ``mediator'' role between
the industry and communities where filming takes place, thus saving
time and money for studios.
<p>
   ``I hope the office is able to get more coordinators to handle
the volume of calls coming in,'' Walbrecht said, adding that
Warner's recently signed a three-year lease on the Spruce Goose
Dome in Long Beach in order to add to its inventory of production
space.
<p>
   ``We have 32 sound stages in Burbank and they're fully booked,
so we've been forced to make use of spaces like warehouses and
hangars,'' he added.
<p>
   The number of production days in the county rose by exactly
10,000 last year to 43,982. The biggest gains occurred in March,
when production rose by 57.5 percent to 4,526 days, and in
November, when it surged 66 percent to 4,402.
<p>
   Demand for production space has led to studios building new
facilities in the Los Angeles area, including Disney in Burbank,
DreamWorks SKG in Glendale and Universal's Studios pushing its
25-year expansion plan for Universal City, along with expansions by
Warner and NBC in Burbank, and CBS in Studio City.
<p>
   Cluff also said he expects a similar increase in production
during 1997 in the county with major gains coming in TV and
commercial filming.
<p>
   Additionally, the California Film Commission has reported a 21
percent gain in production days on state-owned property last year
to 1,662, including Sony's ``Jerry Maguire'' and Universal's
``Metro.''
<p>
   CFC Director Patti Stolkin Archuletta said the gain is due
partly to aggressive efforts by state officials to retain film work
and by legislation enacted last year to standardize safety codes
for studios, encourage the use of closed military bases and
streamline construction permitting for sets.

 &UR; ADMINISTRATION TO ASK 12 PERCENT CUT IN FOREIGN SPENDING &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  President Clinton and his new secretary of state,
Madeleine K. Albright, plan to ask Congress to increase spending on
foreign affairs by about 12 percent, aides said Wednesday. That
would be a dramatic change from the 10 percent cut imposed by
Congress last year.
<p>
   Half of the extra $2.2 billion would be used to pay off the US
debt to the United Nations, an expense that probably will irk
conservatives in Congress. The rest would buy new computers, hire
more diplomats with expertise in trade and other specialities,
repair embassies and expand peacekeeping missions, according to
officials.
<p>
   The decision followed weeks of haggling between the State
Department, where officials have been reeling from cutbacks, and
the president's Office of Management and Budget, which wants to
balance the budget and emphasize spending at home.
<p>
   Clinton wants to take advantage of Congress' bipartisan support
for Albright, who was confirmed Wednesday, and for Bill Richardson,
the former congressman who is expected to be confirmed as
Albright's replacement as UN secretary next week.
<p>
   ``We have to strike while it's hot,'' a State Department
official said. ``We've been cutting back on conducting foreign
affairs at the same time we have become the only superpower in the
world.''
<p>
   The proposed increase in spending on foreign affairs is a
relatively tiny amount for the the federal budget, about the same
amount as the cost of a single Air Force B-2 Stealth bomber. Still,
the administration's determination to expand the foreign budget is
a symbolic victory for internationalists who say the United States
should take a more active role overseas.
<p>
   Last year, a task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign
Relations and the Brookings Institution urged the government to
spend about $3 billion more on foreign affairs. The task force
included prominent Republicans, such as the former national
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz.
<p>
   The campaign to persuade a reluctant Congress will start today,
when the newly elected UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, meets
informally with Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. Annan, a diplomat from Ghana who has
called for UN reform, will later meet other members of the
committee.
<p>
   Tomorrow Annan meets the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott,
whose support the Clinton administration needs as budgets are drawn
up in the next few months.
<p>
   The administration is planning to ask for at least $1 billion
more for foreign affairs and another $1.2 billion to repay the UN
debt, aides to Clinton and former Secretary of State Warren M.
Christopher said.
<p>
   Last year, Congress shot down Clinton's plan to repay the UN
over as many as five years. This time, Clinton will suggest a
relatively small $100 million payment up front. If the UN
reorganizes, trims its bureacracy and disbands several overlapping
agencies, a year later the United States will pay the remainder of
its debt, the aides said.
<p>
   The United States will also seek a change in the formula that
determines how much each country pays to run the UN. The United
States will offer to pay about 23 percent of the total UN budget,
down from the current 25 percent.
<p>
   To please Helms and other critics of foreign affairs programs,
Albright will offer to streamline the State Department and phase
out several agencies, the State Department official said. But while
her predecessor, Christopher, demanded early retirements and
shuttered embassies to save money, Albright will press her
supporters in Congress to spend more, not less.
<p>
   The proposal will probably cause a division in Congress between
hard-liners who dislike the UN and foreign aid and others who want
the United States to be more active. The administration will enlist
moderates such as Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who
serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, aides said.
<p>
   Albright won over doubters in Washington with her blunt talk at
the UN and her successful effort to block another term for Boutros
Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, the former secretary general who opposed
radical reform. After singing her praises Wednesday, the Senate
voted 99-0 to confirm Albright. William S. Cohen, the Maine
Republican who was confirmed Wednesday as secretary of defense,
also wants more money for diplomacy, officials said.
<p>
   ``It is extraordinary that we have cut back so severely in
foreign affairs and the Congress is talking about increasing
spending on the military by more than what we cut out from foreign
affairs,'' said Joseph S. Nye Jr., dean of the Kennedy School of
Government and a former assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs.
<p>
   ``It's like cutting away your first line of defense,'' he said.
``Crises avoided are crises that don't cost you.''
<p>
   An administration official added: ``The American people are more
connected to the rest of the world than they used to be, whether
they like it or not.''
<p>
   In many ways, Albright prepared the way for this campaign at her
confirmation hearing on Jan. 8, when she told the Senate that
first-class diplomacy doesn't come ``on the cheap.'' She noted that
the $18.2 billion the United States spends on foreign affairs in
the current fiscal year is only about 1 percent of the federal
budget, but ``That 1 percent may well determine 50 percent of the
history that is written about the era.''
<p>
   Since the Cold War ended, the United States has steadily pruned
its foreign affairs budget. Thirty embassies and consulates have
been shut. The State Department's technology is so bad, Albright
said, that sometimes she could not call Washington from her UN
office. Instead, she had step outside and use a pay phone.
<p>
   Wednesday, a State Department official discussing the budget
proposal pointed to the clunky black-and-white computer monitor on
his desk and sneered, ``Look at this computer!'' Then he flipped
open a staff directory that showed just two people in the State
Department coordinate policy for seven African countries, including
South Africa.
<p>
   But Albright's Congressional hearing offered a glimpse of the
problems that await her as she makes pitches for multilateral
actions abroad. She sat near a large poster of the UN bureacracy
put up by the Foreign Affairs Committee. ``The UN: One Big Mess,''
it said.
<p>
   The proposal to pay off the UN debt will get a very cool
reception from those in Congress who watch budgets, said Charles M.
Lichenstein, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
<p>
   ``They are going to say, `What's in it for us?''' said
Lichenstein, who served in the US UN office under President Reagan.
``It's all so nebulous that I scarcely know what it means to clear
up the debt and start afresh. Start afresh to do what?''

<p>
   In what may be a breakthrough in the costly three-month-long
battle for Conrail, CSX Corp. and Conrail agreed Wednesday to a
meeting with the Norfolk Southern Corp. to discuss reshaping the
rail freight industry in the East.
<p>
   In a letter to Norfolk Southern, the chairmen of the two
railroads, who had signed a friendly $9.3 billion merger agreement,
said they would hold ``meaningful and candid discussions,'' without
any preconditions. Although the prospect of a meeting represents a
softening in the companies' hard-line stance, analysts were
cautious as to whether a meeting would lead to a negotiated
settlement.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern, which has offered $10.5 billion in a hostile
bid to take over Conrail, had stymied the friendly merger between
CSX and Conrail, at least temporarily, at a special meeting of
Conrail shareholders Friday. Dangling a sweeter offer before
investors, Norfolk persuaded shareholders to reject a measure that
would have allowed CSX to proceed with its merger. But Norfolk,
which plans to purchase 10 percent of Conrail stock, could not go
forward with its own plan for a combination with Conrail.
<p>
   The prize is Conrail's virtual monopoly over rail freight in the
Northeast, which would make either railroad the dominant force east
of the Mississippi River.
<p>
   ``This is a logical progression from the financial contest,
which is not over yet,'' said Scott Flower, a transportation
analyst with Paine Webber. ``There is reason to believe that all
sides would want to negotiate an equitable solution. An
all-or-nothing victory for one side might lead to unintended
consequences before the regulatory bodies.''
<p>
   Any railroad merger would have to be approved by the federal
Surface Transportation Board.
<p>
   News of the letter emerged after the stock market closed.
Earlier, however, investors, who appeared to believe that Norfolk
Southern's higher offer could win out, drove Conrail shares up
$3.50 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $107.50.
<p>
   Conrail's share price has climbed more than 50 percent since the
bidding war began last October. Shares of CSX, which had been
losing ground, jumped $1.625 to close at $49.125. Norfolk Southern
closed at $88.125, up $1.
<p>
   The sudden agreement to a three-way meeting represents a shift
in posture for all three railroads, but especially for Conrail and
CSX, which have rebuffed all entreaties from Norfolk Southern. Yet
all three companies also remain committed, at least for now, to
positions that would seem to rule out a possible compromise.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern has pledged to complete a deal for Conrail that
would provide shareholders $115 cash a share, while CSX has stated
publicly that it will not raise its offer again.
<p>
   Conrail, in turn, has fought to remain intact, rather than be
split up between the CSX and Norfolk in some sort of equitable
division. It would appear that one side or another must beat a
public and humiliating retreat for these meetings to have a
meaningful outcome, some analysts said.
<p>
   ``It appears that there is a crack in the hard positions taken
by CSX and Conrail and perhaps a change in attitude,'' Anthony
Hatch, an analyst with NatWest Securities, said. ``But we can't be
sure because it's been a game of feints and deception up until now.
Given the positions they have taken it's hard to see how an
equitable solution can be found without somebody eating crow.''
<p>
   The apparent thaw in relations between the railroad companies
was prompted by comments from Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the
Surface Transportation Board, in an interview in The Washington
Post Tuesday.
<p>
   Ms. Morgan appeared to urge the railroads to devise a solution
that would provide a competitive balance in the East before any
merger proposal comes before her agency.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   In a big merger last year, between the Union Pacific and
Southern Pacific railroads, the board laid down a number of
conditions intended to minimize the loss of competition before it
approved the $5.4 billion merger. The transportation board absorbed
some of the regulatory functions of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which was eliminated by Congress in 1995.
<p>
   Indeed, in the interview with The Washington Post, Ms. Morgan
pointed to the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger.
<p>
   ``I think the STB signaled that it prefers a private market
solution to the problem rather than an unpredictable battle before
the regulatory agency,'' Flower of Paine Webber said. ``They want
something worked out so they can adjust at the margin rather than
making wholesale changes and being the solution.''
<p>
   The letter sent to Norfolk Southern's chairman, David R. Goode,
was in response to a letter from Goode on Tuesday calling for
talks.
<p>
   Norfolk Southern has said that a combined CSX-Conrail company
would control 70 percent of the market in the East, while a Norfolk
combination would ensure a more equitable 60-40 split.
<p>
   CSX and Conrail have repeatedly said they would meet with
Norfolk Southern to discuss track rights and other concessions. But
Norfolk rejected that option as too modest to make a difference.
<p>
   In the past, CSX and Norfolk have held secret negotiations
concerning a more far-reaching solution: buying Conrail and
splitting the railroad between them. But neither company could
figure out how to overcome the strict anti-takeover laws that
protect Conrail in Pennsylvania.
<p>
   A merger of Conrail with either CSX or Norfolk Southern would
create the nation's third-largest freight rail line, behind Union
Pacific and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
<p>
   Conrail, meanwhile, Wednesday reported a profit for the fourth
quarter, reversing a loss from a year earlier.
<p>
   The company earned $147 million, or $1.70 a share, compared with
a loss of $30 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter a year
earlier. Revenues fell slightly, to $943 million from $951 million.
<p>
   In the quarter a year ago, the company incurred costs of $176
million from disposing of some rail lines. In the most recent
quarter, Conrail reported costs of $10 million stemming from the
proposed merger with CSX.

<p>
   NEW YORK  &MD;  Over the last 15 years, a self-made entrepreneur from
New Jersey has given away more than $600 million to universities,
medical centers and other beneficiaries  &MD;  but has done it in such
secrecy that most recipients never learned who their benefactor
was.
<p>
   The donor, Charles F. Feeney, 65, who made his fortune with a
string of duty-free airport shops, covered his tracks so well that
business magazines for years have estimated his net worth in the
billions, not realizing that he had transferred most of his assets
to his two charitable foundations and is actually worth less than
$5 million.
<p>
   After years of secrecy, Feeney, who is 65, agreed this week to
discuss his gifts because the duty-free stores were sold this month
to the company that makes Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne, and a lawsuit
over the sale would have revealed his anonymous donations.
<p>
   Feeney  &MD;  who has strong ties to Ireland and has also made many
gifts there, including personal donations to Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing  &MD;  was matter-of-fact in describing why he had given
away his fortune. ``I simply decided I had enough money,'' he said.
``It doesn't drive my life. I'm a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind
of guy.''
<p>
   Harvey P. Dale, a New York University tax law professor and
president of Feeney's Atlantic Foundation, who has helped Feeney
orchestrate his gifts since 1982, said: ``He doesn't own a house.
He doesn't own a car. He flies economy. And I think his watch cost
about $15.''
<p>
   While large anonymous donations to charity are not unheard of,
the scope and style of Feeney's giving, and his passion for
secrecy, appeared to be unique, according to independent experts on
philanthropy. ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' said
Thomas A. Troyer, a senior partner in the law firm of Caplin &AMP;
Drysdale in Washington, who specializes in philanthropic law.
<p>
   From the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to Portland State
University, none of the American recipients of Feeney's largesse
knew who their benefactor was. Grants were paid by cashier's check
to conceal the source. In fact, the beneficiaries never realized
that they owed their thanks to a single giver  &MD;  they were told that
the money came from several generous ``clients'' who wished to
remain anonymous.
<p>
   Few of the recipients had ever even met Dale or Joel L.
Fleishman, the president of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which
actually gave away the money on behalf of Feeney's foundations, the
Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust.
<p>
   Dr. Robert Butler of Mount Sinai School of Medicine said he met
Feeney in 1990 while making a proposal for financing to an advisory
board that reviewed grant proposals.
<p>
   ``I had no idea that he was the main supporter of what I call
the Anonymous Foundation,'' Butler said, adding that the grant was
made, starting the International Longevity Center at the New York
Academy of Medicine. ``Anonymous giving, giving that is not
dependent on ego, is just really rare.''
<p>
   Feeney said that by giving anonymously, he could go about his
life unhampered by pitches for donations. ``There are people who
want, and rightly deserve, recognition for giving, but in our case
it wasn't important,'' he said.
<p>
   It was Dale who helped Feeney set up his foundations, which like
his Duty-Free Shoppes chain are based in Bermuda, avoiding the
disclosure requirements of private foundations in the United
States. Feeney also declined to take a deduction on his personal
income taxes for the money he gave to the foundations, in order to
preserve the secrecy.
<p>
   And Atlantic Philanthropic Services, the New York-based entity
that screens applicants and writes the checks, is set up as a
for-profit company, also to avoid disclosure rules.
<p>
   Feeney gave his entire 38.75 percent interest in the duty-free
chain, known as DFS Group, to the two foundations in 1984 (even his
partner, Robert W. Miller, was not told). Now, the foundations have
received the proceeds from the sale of the controlling interest in
the chain to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France.
<p>
   The chain has sales of more than $3 billion annually, mostly in
liquors and luxury goods, more than the combined sales of Saks
Fifth Avenue and Neiman-Marcus.
<p>
   The sale proceeds, along with other business assets Feeney has
turned over to the foundations, have left the charity with a total
of $3.5 billion, even after the $610 million that has already been
distributed to charities. It would rank as the nation's
fourth-largest grant-making foundation if it were based in the
United States, yet the two groups operate with tiny staffs, just 20
professionals in the United States and overseas.
<p>
   The foundation's largest single grant was $30 million, according
to Dale, who refused to identify the recipient on grounds that the
information might discourage other donors from supporting it. ``One
reason for keeping gifts anonymous is to avoid what we call this
`crowding out' effect,'' Dale said.
<p>
   Recipients were effusive in their praise for their anonymous
donor's style of giving and what it had enabled them to do. ``This
is operational support, the most valuable kind of assistance,''
said William Nelsen, president of the Citizens' Scholarship
Foundation of America, in St. Peter, Minn., which has received
support since 1984.

 &UR; CALENERGY MAY SELL POWER TO HOMES (UPDATE1): BLOOMBERG FORUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Kerry Dooley &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; c.1997 Bloomberg News &LR;  &QC; 
   (Adds details about deregulation and CalEnergy in last nine

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- CalEnergy Inc. said it will
sell electricity directly to consumers in the U.S. and Asia in a
few years, challenging local utilities for sales of power to homes
and businesses.
<p>
   CalEnergy isn't the only U.S. power company with plans to find
new customers as deregulation ends monopolies. Atlanta-based
Southern Co. and Western Resources Inc. of Topeka, Kansas, also
intend to expand to new markets.
<p>
   Unlike those utilities, CalEnergy's only business is to build
and run power plants. Until recently, the company has let others
deliver electricity generated at CalEnergy plants.
<p>
   That's changing.
<p>
   ``We want to be able to provide our customers with more
services,'' CalEnergy Chairman and Chief Executive David Sokol told
the Bloomberg Forum.
<p>
   To get experience running a transmission system, CalEnergy made
a successful $1.54 billion hostile bid for Northern Electric Plc.
The U.K. utility's marketing savvy made it attractive to CalEnergy,
which wants to bundle electric power sales with other products,
Sokol said.
<p>
   The Northern acquisition, expected to be completed this year,
will help increase CalEnergy's earnings, analysts said. The Omaha,
Nebraska-based operator of power plants is expected to earn $1.87 a
share in 1997 and $2.47 in 1998, according to three analysts polled
by Zacks Investment Research.
<p>
   CalEnergy yesterday said 1996 net income rose to $92.5 million,
or $1.60 a share, a 48 percent increase from the previous year.
<p>
   CalEnergy intends to keep growing by expanding its holdings and
buying new ones, he said. ``I would expect continued acquisitions
in the future,'' Sokol said.
<p>
   CalEnergy's one of the few companies that can run power plants
as a pure business, seeking to lower operating costs where
possible, Sokol said.
<p>
   Much of the world's electricity comes from government-owned
utilities and publicly traded ones run as highly regulated
monopolies. In the U.S., utilities have made their profits by
negotiating with regulators and getting a guaranteed return on
their investment in power plants and other expenses.
<p>
   ``The more money they spend, the more money they make,'' Sokol
said. ``We're just the opposite.''
<p>
   For that reason, CalEnergy's expects to do well as governments
around the world ease out of the electric industry, Sokol said.
<p>
   Next year, the U.K. will let all consumers choose their own
power suppliers. Some of the largest companies there have seen
their electric bills fall 30 percent already by switching to a less
expensive company, he said.
<p>
   The U.K.'s experience is likely to prompt U.S. regulators to end
monopolies in the U.S., Sokol said. Congress is expected to
consider deregulation this year. Consumers are likely to be able to
choose a power supplier as they now do long-distance telephone
service.
<p>
   If the U.S ends monopolies, Omaha, Nebraska-based CalEnergy
expects to make more sales at home, Sokol said.
<p>
   Although CalEnergy's anxious to see governments get out of the
power industry, its first power plant was built in California's
Mojave Desert for the U.S. Navy. That plant taps into underground
water, heated by the earth's crust, to bring up jets of steam. The
steam spins turbines that create electric power.
<p>
   Today, CalEnergy is one of the world's largest producers of this
geothermal energy with plants in the Philippines and Indonesia. It
also has plants that use new technology to lower air pollution from
coal, Sokol said.

   Nelson said that the group, which mobilizes community groups to
raise money for college student aid, was able to significantly
expand its ``Dollars for Scholars'' program to reach 770 chapters
throughout the country, thanks in large part to Atlantic money,
which he said was more than a million dollars.
<p>
   ``As an organization, we've more than quadrupled in size since
getting support from this anonymous donor,'' Nelsen said.
<p>
   At the College Board, which administers scholastic assessment
tests for college-bound high school seniors, the mystery donor was
always referred to by the name ``anonymous,'' said Dr. Donald
Stewart, president of the College Board.
<p>
   ``Anonymous was most interested in results,'' Stewart said. The
anonymous donor supported ``long-term research to establish whether
we are right, which is crucial for the project's credibility and in
assessing whether all schools should adopt the same approach,'' he
said.
<p>
   Several recipients said that once they were invited to apply for
funds their plans were closely examined. ``Ed McMahon did not knock
on my door,'' said Chuck Supple, president of Public Allies, which
places young people in internships with nonprofit organizations.
``These guys really kick the tires.''
<p>
   Judith Ramaley, president of Portland State University, in
Oregon, called her first foundation grant last year her
``catalyst,'' financing of less than one million dollars that
enabled the school to publicize its innovative new curriculum and
links to the community, which have now drawn national attention and
the support of other foundations. ``We were out of cash when they
came along,'' she said. ``They were the trail mix at that key
moment on our very steep hiking path,'' she said.
<p>
   One-fourth of Feeney's contributions have been made abroad, half
of that in Ireland. The foundation also supports projects in South
Africa, the former Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, Israel and Jordan.
<p>
   There was less secrecy surrounding Feeney's activities in
Ireland. Several Irish university presidents and other
beneficiaries said they had met Feeney several times.
<p>
   Feeney also said he had given substantial personal donations  &MD; 
not from the Atlantic foundations  &MD;  in the last two years to the
Washington office of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, which in 1994 entered into a cease-fire with the
British that was broken last February. Public records show that
Feeney has contributed some $280,000  &MD;  making him the group's
single largest American donor.
<p>
   While Feeney acknowledged that some would criticize his support
for a group linked to the IRA he said his gifts to Sinn Fein had
been monitored to insure that they supported only nonviolent
activities. He continued supporting the Washington office despite
the cease-fire's collapse last February, he said, ``because I'm
hopeful that it will be renewed.''
<p>
   The Atlantic Foundation's board of directors includes several
prominent personalities in the philanthropic and educational
establishment  &MD;  among them, Elizabeth McCormack, a senior adviser
on charitable giving to members of the Rockefeller family and vice
chairman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation;
Frank H.T. Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University,
Michael I. Sovern, president of the Shubert Foundation and
president emeritus of Columbia University, and Frederick A.O.
Schwarz Jr., an attorney and chairman of the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
<p>
   None of them had previously disclosed their connection with the
Atlantic groups publicly, nor did they discuss Feeney's giving with
peers or even their families, they said in interviews this week.
``This organization has operated on a need-to-know basis,''
Fleishman said.
<p>
   Most recipients said their only contact was with program
officers of Atlantic Philanthropic Services, which selects the
grantees, gives out the money, and evaluates the outcome of the
gifts.
<p>
   Rhodes, the foundation board member and former president of
Cornell, said that the foundation was careful not to use money to
tell recipients what to do or how to do it. ``The danger with
foundations is that sometimes the staff and board come to feel that
they own the money,'' Rhodes said, ``and they micromanage. We have
a motto: noses in, fingers out.''
<p>
   Dale said of the relationship to grant recipients: ``We are
voyeurs. We let good people do good things. We oversee, but we
don't interfere.''
<p>
   And despite his decision finally to disclose his donations,
Feeney is still trying to keep a low profile. He declined this week
to be photographed.

 &UR; PIERCE CRUISES INTO AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL &LR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<p>
   MELBOURNE, Australia  &MD;  She did a nervous little jig Thursday as
she awaited serve, heaved a mighty sigh each time she stepped to
the service line, flashed a dazzling smile of self-mockery after
she failed to serve for the first set at 5-1, and sent an aggrieved
stare toward her coach after her 5-1 lead dwindled to a 5-5
deadlock.
<p>
   Mary Pierce doesn't just play tennis, she performs it, and
Thursday's 7-5, 6-1 performance against 12th-seeded Amanda Coetzer
vaulted the unseeded Pierce into the final of the Australian Open,
the slam where made her breakthrough by winning the title in 1995.
Pierce had won just a single Corel Tour title, and had not been to
a slam final, since she prevailed here two years ago.
<p>
   ``I don't think about when was the last time for this or that,''
said Pierce, ``but the experience helps.''
<p>
   In the women's final Saturday, the 22nd-ranked Pierce hopes to
ferret out some inexperience in Switzerland's 4th-seeded Martina
Hingis, the teenaged phenomenon who became the favorite to capture
her first slam title once the three seeded stars ahead of her here
bowed out.
<p>
   The 16-year-old Hingis launched herself into her first Grand
Slam final with a convincing 6-1, 6-3 demolition of 14th-seeded
Mary Joe Fernandez, a two-time finalist on the cusp of curtailing
her 10-year singles career.
<p>
   ``It was so easy today; I played practically perfect tennis,''
said Hingis, whose control and pace put Fernandez on the defensive
from start to finish.
<p>
   Hingis was realistic about her 0-3 record against Pierce, who in
the past has been able to overpower the teenager from the baseline
with sufficient authority to produce a trio of 6-0 sets.
<p>
   ``It's not going to be easy, I've lost to her every time we've
played: but I'm a better player now,'' said Hingis, whose main
improvement is a less breakable serve.
<p>
   If Hingis, already the Australian Open's youngest semifinalist,
survives another round and pockets this title, she will become the
youngest Grand Slam champion since 15-year-old Lottie Dodd
monopolized Wimbledon in 1887. If Pierce goes full circle and
reclaims the title she earned in 1995, she'll become the first
unseeded woman to claim a Grand Slam since Chris O'Neill won this
tournament in 1978.
<p>
   The last unseeded slam champion was the absent Andre Agassi,
like Pierce an excommunicated disciple of Nick Bollettieri and like
Pierce a champion here in 1995; the Las Vegan zipped through to the
U.S. Open title in 1994, and Pierce has said she wouldn't mind
imitating his act.
<p>
   ``I feel like a different player, a different person,'' said the
22-year-old Pierce, who failed to cope with the attendant pressures
and expectations that followed her victory here and watched her
ranking dip from a career-best of third in the world to 22nd.
<p>
   Last year Pierce played just 32 matches and ended the year on
the sidelines, nursing a wounded shoulder and unable to swing a
racquet for two months.
<p>
   Hingis, by contrast, concluded her 1996 campaign by reaching the
U.S. Open semifinals, winning Oakland, and taking top-ranked Steffi
Graf to five sets at the Chase Championships. Since the Olympics,
only Graf and Jana Novotna have beaten her.
<p>
   But Pierce came into this year's Australian Open, where she was
dethroned in the second round last year by Elena Likhovtseva, with
vindication on her mind and with Sven Groeneveld, the same coach
who shepherded her to her first and only slam crown in 1995, back
on her support squad. She went through a venomous split with her
other mentor from 1995, Bollettieri, after he called her fondness
for sweets a character flaw.
<p>
   Pierce's first order of business was getting revenge on the
13th-seeded Likhovsetva in the opening round, and she ousted two
more seeded contenders before Thursday's bravura handling of
Coetzer, the South African who upset Graf in the Round of 16.
<p>
   After bullying Coetzer off the court in the first six games,
Pierce unraveled as she served for the first set at 5-1, was broken
again on her second try at 5-3, and allowed Coetzer to level things
at 5-5. But after Pierce held for 6-5 with an ace and broke Coetzer
with crosscourt forehand pass, she didn't relinquish control.
<p>
   ``I started off perfectly, then I felt a little bit strange, a
little bit weak,'' said the theatrical Pierce, ``but I just tried
to push myself and gradually I felt better.''

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
shrank a larger-than-expected 20.6 percent in December from the
same month a year ago as higher oil prices drove up imports, the
Finance Ministry said.
<p>
   At the same time, Japan's surplus with the United States grew
for the third straight month as the yen declined 8.5 percent
against the dollar between August and December. This trend will
likely continue since U.S. demand is strong.
<p>
   ``The pace of exports to the U.S. will continue because America
has quite robust growth with low inflation,'' said Akio Yoshino,
senior economist at Credit Suisse Asset Management before the
release of the report.
<p>
   Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. in December rose 7.8 percent
to 389.113 billion yen ($3.26 billion), the ministry said. Vehicle
exports rose 8.4 percent in December as Japanese automakers boost
production to meet demand for new models introduced in September. A
senior Finance Ministry official said auto exports may continue to
rise as the yen weakens against the dollar.
<p>
   U.S. officials continue to support a strong dollar even as
Japan's surplus increases.
<p>
   ``A strong dollar is in our national economic self-interest,''
U.S. treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Tuesday. He added that
the dollar's climb against other major currencies isn't detrimental
to the U.S. trade position. ``The key to (reducing the U.S.) trade
deficit is our competitiveness, not the dollar.''
<p>
   The declines in Japan's trade surplus will end by April as the
yen depreciates further and the price of oil stabilizes, economists
said.
<p>
   ``The declines in Japan's trade surplus will continue through
March as the price of oil continues to increase,'' said Kazutaka
Kirishima, an economist at Sumitomo Mutual Life Research Center.
<p>
   The price of a barrel of Saudi Arabian light oil averaged $22.06
in December, an increase of 33 percent compared to the same time a
year earlier.
<p>
   Market reaction was limited because the trade surplus, which
totaled 881.475 billion yen ($7.4 billion), has declined for 25
straight months.
<p>
   Economists said the surplus would be 1.055 trillion yen,
according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg Business News.
Projections ranged from 970 billion yen to 1.145 trillion yen.
<p>
   Global imports to Japan rose 13.4 percent to 3.286 trillion yen,
while exports increased 4.0 percent to 4.168 trillion yen, the
ministry said.
<p>
   For all 1996, Japan's trade surplus fell 32.4 percent to 6.7
trillion yen, the Finance Ministry said. That was the fourth
straight yearly decline, and the largest decline in the surplus on
record.
<p>
   In yen terms, it was the smallest trade surplus since 1983.
Still, exports and imports both reached record highs. Japan's
exports rose 7.7 percent to 44.734 trillion yen, while imports rose
20.4 percent to 37.990 trillion yen. That was the largest
percentage increase in imports since 1989.
<p>
   The country's full-year trade surplus with the U.S. fell 16.5
percent to 3.6 trillion yen, the second straight yearly decline.
Japan has increased ``reverse imports'' -- goods made at Japanese
factories overseas -- when the yen strengthened against the dollar
in 1994 and 1995. That led to a 21.9 percent increase in imports
from the United States.
<p>
   Japan's surplus with the European Union declined 26.5 percent,
the fourth consecutive decline. Imports of Japanese autos made in
Europe helped reduce the surplus, the government said.
<p>
   Japan's surplus with Asia fell 15.7 percent in 1996, the first
decline in nine years. Weak demand for semiconductors in the region
was the main reason for the decline, the ministry said.
<p>
   At the same time, many Japanese companies are building factories
in Asia to take advantage of lower labor and transportation costs.
That has led to a fall in exports from Japan and an increase in
``reverse imports,'' analysts said.
<p>
   ``A lot of production is done offshore now and that's keeping
the surplus in decline,'' said Dennis Tachiki, a researcher at
Sakura Institute of Research. The surplus has also declined as
Asian manufacturers produce cheaper electronics components.
<p>
   In December, Japan's trade surplus with Asia fell 5.6 percent
compared to a year earlier to 703.1 billion yen. Increasing oil
prices led to the decline as imports of refined oil grew 63.7
percent while natural gas imports grew 56.6 percent.

   Los Angeles, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. judge approved a
settlement in a class-action lawsuit against Connecticut General
Life Insurance, a unit of the Philadelphia-based insurer Cigna
Corp., lawyers for policyholders said.
<p>
   Federal District Court Judge Harry L. Hupp in Los Angeles
approved the settlement on Jan. 13. Plaintiffs claimed the insurer
overcharged and misled them in sales of insurance policies. Cigna
didn't admit wrongdoing in the settlement. A lawyer for the
plaintiffs and a representative of the company disagreed on how
much the settlement could cost. Cigna said it expects to pay out a
maximum of $35 million.
<p>
   Mark Rifkin, an Ardmore, Pennsylvania, attorney representing
plaintiffs, said Cigna could be forced to pay $200 million or more.
``There is absolutely no upward limit to what this could cost the
company,'' he said.
<p>
   Cigna spokesman Ken Ferraro said ``any settlement amount at this
point is purely speculative,'' because plaintiffs are only now
beginning to file for claims under a dispute-resolution process set
up by the settlement. Still, most plaintiffs in the case won't
receive cash settlements, Ferraro said. ``For the vast majority of
the people, we're making a slight adjustment over the lifetime of
the policy,'' he said.
<p>
   ``This will not have a material effect on earnings of Cigna or
the earnings of Connecticut General,'' Ferraro said. Cigna stock
closed up 1 5/8 at an a record 151 5/8.
<p>
   Policyholders, beneficiaries and those who paid for coverage
will have until July 12 to submit claims.
<p>
   The case is the result of two lawsuits, one charging that
Connecticut General agents misled customers by promising premiums
would vanish after a certain term and accusing the company of
trying to pass on to policyholders the effects of a 1990 U.S. tax
increase.
<p>
   The settlement on charges of misleading customers will likely
cost the company more per claim than the tax part of the case,
albeit for far fewer claims, Ferraro said.
<p>
   Claims involving the tax, known as the deferred acquisition tax,
will probably account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of
the potential claims in the combined class action lawsuit, Ferraro
said. Costs of compensating such customers will be lower, Ferraro
added.
<p>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs estimated there could be as many as
128,000 individual claims.

<p>
   LANDOVER, Md.  &MD;  So here is the New York Ranger winning goal,
exactly the way they might have drawn it up on the chalkboard.
<p>
   With the game tied at 3-3 in the final minute Wednesday night,
Wayne Gretzky skates to the New York bench on a line change. At the
doorway, he gets tangled up with Jason Allison of Washington.
<p>
   They grab each other's sticks. Words are exchanged. More players
gather. The scene looks like the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel at
rush hour. A linesman enters the fray, in the role of traffic cop.
<p>
   While everyone's attention is diverted, the Rangers skate down
the ice, pass the puck around and score  &MD;  Mark Messier to Niklas
Sundstrom to Brian Leetch.
<p>
   The goal, Leetch's second of the night, his fourth in two games
and his 15th of the season, proved to be the winner in a 5-3
victory over the Capitals. Everybody had a hand in it.
<p>
   ``Took my man,'' Gretzky said.
<p>
   Leetch said he wasn't aware of the fracas but he smiled when he
said he was glad it didn't escalate into something that would cause
a whistle to stop play.
<p>
   They could afford to be happy, despite being outplayed most of
the way and losing a three-goal lead.
<p>
   This was the first time this season the Rangers have defeated
the Capitals, after three consecutive defeats. It also was the
first victory for goalie Glenn Healy since Dec. 7. And it raised
the Rangers' record in their Atlantic division to 5-12-4.
<p>
   Because Florida lost to Hartford, the victory put the Rangers
technically into second place in the Atlantic Division, a point
ahead of the Panthers.
<p>
   Leetch, with the hot stick, was asked if he is ``in the zone,''
the way basketball players get.
<p>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I'm just shooting it at the net. I'm as
surprised as anybody. The goalies have seen each and every goal.
<p>
   ``I haven't really picked a spot out. I've kind of throwing it
at the net. They're kind of hitting the goalie and going in or
going in under his glove. It's more good luck than anything.''
<p>
   Leetch also assisted on a goal by Luc Robitaille. The rookie
Vladimir Vorobiev scored the other first-period goal and Adam
Graves scored into the empty net in the dying seconds when
Washington pulled its goalie for an extra attacker. Peter Bondra
scored twice for the Capitals, the second to tie the game at 3-3 at
13 minutes 15 seconds of the third period.
<p>
   The Ranger penalty killing, which allowed 15 goals in the
previous nine games, was perfect in five tries Wednesday night,
including two that overlapped by 50 seconds.
<p>
   Rangers coach Colin Campbell, who sometimes sees the dark lining
in silver clouds, was rather upbeat, about this results and the 4-4
tie with Edmonton on the previous night.
<p>
   ``Three good points in two nights when we were in danger,'' he
said. ``This team sure challenges you in the grit department.''
<p>
   The Rangers played for the second consecutive game without
goalie Mike Richter and right wing Patrick Flatley. And the team's
medical sheet lengthened in the first period when Jeff Beukeboom,
the big, durable defenseman, left with a severe bruise on the
pointing finger of his left hand.
<p>
   The Rangers announced that X-rays of the finger had proven
negative. Campbell said afterward that Beukeboom would probably be
ready for the next game, Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh.
<p>
   Fortunately, Campbell dressed seven defensemen instead of the
usual six. Richter, with a mild shoulder separation, also could
return Saturday. Flatley has a groin strain and his return is
uncertain.
<p>
   At the opening face-off, the Rangers were the beneficiaries of
two things beyond their control. The first was the absence of
defenseman Mark Tinordi, who usually plays well against them. He is
out for at least a month with a broken ankle bone.
<p>
   The second was the decision of Washington coach Jim Schoenfeld
to start Jim Carey in goal instead of Olaf Kolzig. In their last
visit here, on Jan. 9, Kolzig shut out the Rangers. Cary gave up
two goals on his first three shots and was pulled after the Rangers
took a 3-0 lead in the first 12 minutes.
<p>
   Leetch opened the scoring at 3:53 when his weak shot from high
in the zone found its way behind Carey, who got a piece of it as it
went by.
<p>
   The second, on a two-man power play, was scored by Robitaille,
his 20th. of the season, on a setup from Messier at 10:23. The
Capitals were down a second man because Joe Juneau accidentally
nicked Gretzky's face with a high stick while the Rangers were on
the power play.
<p>
   The Rangers went up by 3-0 at 11:57, on a one-man power play,
when Vorobiev scored his second in two nights on a one-time slap
shot set up by Gretzky.

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Saturday morning, Jan. 18: I rise, ready for
history. I do not feel jaded. I am perfectly prepared to feel
corny. This is a weekend for unblushing patriotism. Barbra
Streisand is not in the Lincoln Bedroom. Dick Morris is not in the
Jefferson bedroom. The United States is the only superpower on
earth. All's right with the world. I can even bear that Michael
Bolton's in town.
<p>
   Bill's and Hillary's first four years were exhausting. The
country's all rolfed out. There were some tawdry moments. But most
Americans seem satisfied that the Clintons have been punished for
cutting all those corners. There was a pounding in the press, and
all those hearings. Perhaps people now look to the presidency for
lurid entertainment as much as moral inspiration. And, as I watch
Al Gore craning from the wings, I can give the Clintons this: They
aren't boring.
<p>
   The inaugural, unfortunately, builds on the themes of the
campaign: bridges, villages, Internet access. But even weighed down
with earnest lectures by family experts and glitzed up with Whoopi
Goldberg (who makes Liza Minnelli look sincere), democracy is
lovely to behold.
<p>
   Saturday night: I go to John McLaughlin's party at the Willard
Hotel. Up or down? Way down. McLaughlin has managed to find the
only white soul band in D.C. Tall Media Analyst William Schneider
looms over Tiny Cabinet Member Donna Shalala to discuss Tarnished
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``Three hundred thousand dollars is a
meaningful concept,'' Schneider says.
<p>
   Soignee Conservative Arianna Huffington asks Soigne Conservative
Tony Blankley to film a bit for her Comedy Central gig: ``Let's
find a way to make the Republican Party more compassionate.''
Pointing at me, she says: ``Tony, help her put on her coat. Or get
her a drink.''
<p>
   At the Corcoran Gallery's MTV party, as trays of blue martinis
float by, Hillary has an Evita moment at the top of the grand
staircase.
<p>
   I see my personal trainer, and scurry away from the guacamole.
<p>
   Sunday, Jan. 19: Emily's List, the feminist fund-raising group,
has a news conference featuring new Democratic women in Congress. A
reporter asks whether feminists have ignored Paula Jones.
<p>
   The Emily's List spokeswoman cuts off questioning, saying time
has run out.
<p>
   Monday, Jan. 20: I go to the Inaugural Address. Despite the
president's best efforts, it is exciting. Why is he so deadly? Is
it because he speaks in cliches or because he fails to act on his
cliches? He wins the election by trafficking in what Dick Morris
called ``bite-size'' issues. And now he says that ``Nothing big
ever came from being small.''
<p>
   Monday night: After I get tickets to the Arkansas ball, I
realize I have made a fatal mistake. This is a town where you can
never start jockeying for position too early. Everyone is elbowing
into Tennessee.
<p>
   Arkansas has its compensations. A circle of guys in black tie
try to teach me the Arkansas Cheer, which goes, ``Pig  &MD;  soo-eeee!''
<p>
   The Clintons appear on stage at 10:30 p.m., serenaded by Sheryl
Crow singing ``All I wanna do is have some fun.'' But their remarks
sound oddly peevish. Bill harkens back to the dark scandal days of
New Hampshire '92. Hillary tells a story about a woman who called
C-Span to ask if the president was really a Kennedy. ``The woman,''
the first lady says, smiling coolly, ``was spinning out these
extraordinary conspiracy theories that capture the hearts and minds
of too many with too little to do.''
<p>
   ``Nightline'' does a day in the life of Al Gore  &MD;  ``The Vice
President, a Bridge to the Future.'' Ted Koppel asks Gore if he's
running. The tension is unbearable as Koppel waits for a reply. The
reply is even more unbearable. ``My so-called campaign for
president,'' Gore says, ``is a lot like my macarena  &MD;  there's no
visible movement.'' OK, OK, we get it. You're stiff. Stop being so
vain about it.
<p>
   Tuesday, Jan. 21: During the House debate on punishing Newt
Gingrich, Tom DeLay of Texas cries: ``Let's stop this madness.
Let's stop the cannibalism.''
<p>
   Wednesday, Jan. 22: Back to business. Let the madness and
cannibalism resume.

<p>
   In a wide-ranging indictment that implicates major associates of
New York City's politically powerful police union, federal
authorities charged Wednesday that top officials of a sister union
representing the transit police took kickbacks and engaged in
several other schemes before the two unions merged in 1995.
<p>
   The racketeering and bribery indictments were immediately seized
on by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a primary reason for his
administration's failure to negotiate a new contract with the
38,000-member police union. On Tuesday, that union, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, rejected the city's last contract offer,
leaving the talks with the influential union at an impasse as the
mayor prepares to run for re-election.
<p>
   PBA officials declined to respond to the mayor's assertion that
their legal troubles had undermined the talks. But Giuliani's
comments underscored the deep rift that has grown between many
police officers and the mayor, who plans to make the city's
record-setting drop in crime a central theme of his re-election
campaign.
<p>
   This year, the mayor will be in the uncomfortable position of
running on his record as a crime fighter while having frayed
relations with the police union and its restive members, who
strongly supported his mayoral bid in 1993.
<p>
   While the charges announced Wednesday do not implicate PBA
officials, they do focus on the union that merged with the PBA in
May 1995, the Transit Police Benevolent Association, which shared
its lawyers with the city officers' union. Federal prosecutors
charged that before the merger, the lawyers paid bribes to Transit
PBA officials to keep the union's work. One of the lawyers, James
Lysaght, has been called the architect of the PBA's strategy in the
current contract talks.
<p>
   Further, federal investigators say that because of the links
between the two unions, their inquiry will focus on the PBA, which
has been one of the most effective lobbying forces in Albany and
City Hall for years. The round of inquiries is likely to further
complicate the union's efforts to get raises for members, who have
gone without a pay increase for two years.
<p>
   ``There's no question that today's indictments have had a very
difficult effect on the ability of the city to communicate its
message to the police officers of New York City,'' Giuliani said.
<p>
   In announcing the indictments of five people and guilty pleas of
six others Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said more charges
might follow against some current and former city PBA board members
for their part in a money-laundering scheme.
<p>
   In that scheme, as outlined in Wednesday's indictment, officials
of several police unions essentially lent money to the campaign of
a former Transit PBA president, Ron Reale, so that he could
fraudulently qualify for city matching funds during his
unsuccessful campaign for Public Advocate in 1993. Reale was among
those indicted Wednesday.
<p>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lachow, said more than 15
questionable donations to Reale's campaign were made by city,
transit and housing PBA officials, their spouses and their friends,
but it is unclear whether they will face criminal charges.
<p>
   But other investigators, who insisted on anonymity, said the
city PBA was now likely to become the focus of the inquiry because
Lysaght and two other lawyers charged Wednesday, Peter L. Kramer
and Richard Hartman, have had multimillion-dollar contracts with
the city police union for years.
<p>
   Ms. White would not discuss the possibility of indictments
against current PBA officials, saying only, ``We're going to pursue
this case as far as the evidence will take us.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   A spokesman for the law firm of Lysaght &AMP; Kramer, which is paid
more than $5 million in taxpayer money and union dues each year to
defend city police officers, said that the lawyers expected to be
cleared of any charges.
<p>
   ``We at our law firms have acted tirelessly and aggressively on
behalf of police officers for many years,'' the spokesman, Todd
Shapiro, said, ``and given our aggressive efforts, it's not
surprising that we have made certain enemies, nor that these
enemies would target us for this type of attack.''
<p>
   The investigation began two years ago, when top officials of the
transit police union were accused of looting $265,000 from the
union's coffers in the months before the May 1995 merger with the
city PBA.
<p>
   In November, two financial officials of the Transit PBA, the
union's vice president, Thomas Zichettello, and its treasurer,
Raymond Montero, were charged with using union funds to buy luxury
cars for themselves and their spouses.
<p>
   Montero began cooperating with federal agents, said
law-enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. They
added that Montero described how union officials demanded cash
bribes of more than $300,000 from their lawyers and other vendors.
<p>
   According to the indictment, which was filed by Michele
Hirschman, head of the federal attorney's Public Corruption Unit,
Transit PBA officials paid Lysaght &AMP; Kramer inflated fees for
administering the union's health and welfare benefits fund, annuity
fund and civil legal fund, then demanded cash kickbacks of more
than $300,000.
<p>
   Zichettello and Montero have both been indicted, and pleaded
guilty Wednesday to conspiracy and racketeering, Ms. White said.
<p>
   Transit PBA officials are also charged with demanding similar
kickbacks from the law firm of Barry Agulnick and William Gogel,
two other lawyers who represented transit police officers. The two
were also indicted on racketeering charges and pleaded guilty
Wednesday. Agulnick and Gogel also have signed cooperation
agreements with federal investigators, according to law-enforcement
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The most tantalizing aspect of Wednesday's indictment was the
charges filed against Richard Hartman, a former PBA lawyer who is
one of the most storied figures in local labor politics. Hartman
was forced to resign as the lead PBA lawyer in 1988 and forfeit his
law license after he was caught taking $817,000 from union accounts
to support his gambling habit.
<p>
   During a grand jury proceeding by the Manhattan district
attorney's office in 1988, prosecutors also presented evidence that
Hartman was involved in a kickback scheme and associated with
organized crime figures, according to a letter his lawyer at the
time, Michael Armstrong, later filed in court.
<p>
   When Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau agreed to
drop the charges against Hartman in exchange for his forfeiting his
law license, city PBA officials quickly granted him a $2 million
contract as a labor consultant and allowed him to act as the agent
for the members' life insurance plan  &MD;  which generated an
additional $2 million in commissions.
<p>
   Hartman's current lawyer, Stuart London, said his client denied
any wrongdoing. But federal agents charged him Wednesday with
paying a series of bribes to transit police union officials, who
allowed him to act as the life insurance agent for that union's
members.
<p>
   Joseph Mancini, a union spokesman, said that none of the
criminal charges against the lawyers involved its dealings with the
city PBA.
<p>
   ``They have always been professional in their relations with
us,'' he said.

   SAN ANTONIO  &MD;  Khalid Reeves needed a massage and he needed it
now. But it wasn't a good time. Didn't he know that?
<p>
   Reeves was grimacing and wincing with 1 minute, 35 seconds left
as he brought the ball up the court. He pulled up in pain. But a
timeout was all it took as trainer Ted Arzonico managed to rub out
the cramp that bit Reeves' foot.
<p>
   Reeves was up with a bounce, springing onto the floor to finish
a game against the Spurs that he had started, playing at point
guard in place of the injured Robert Pack. That seemed a scary
proposition. After all, Reeves was so turnover prone. But
amazingly, did not have a single turnover, coming up with 7 assists
and 17 points as the New Jersey Nets beat the San Antonio Spurs,
103-95, at the Alamodome.
<p>
   If only they could play San Antonio every day. The Nets' victory
meant a season sweep of the Spurs, sans David Robinson, for the
first time in team history. It took Kendall Gill (32 points) to
bang away at a bigger Sean Elliott, landing a driving layup that
put the Nets ahead, 99-93, with 32 seconds left.
<p>
   And it took a confident Kerry Kittles (23 points) to assert
himself, scoring 10 points in the final five minutes.
<p>
   But none of it would have happened if Reeves had flubbed his
start like he did the last time he started following a Pack injury.
That was a miserable, seven-turnover performance against the
Knicks, Dec. 30.
<p>
   ``No turnovers? That was an accomplishment,'' an understated
Reeves said. ``The last time, I had seven. I was just trying to get
the team going and get everyone into it.''
<p>
   He was into it so much that he came up with a foot cramp. ``I'm
thinking, Oh, no, not now,'' Reeves said. ``But then I knew it
would be OK. It just took a few seconds and I was ready again.''
<p>
   The Nets looked ready from the start, but they let a 10-point
lead early in the second quarter get away from them as Vernon
Maxwell took advantage of the warehouse space that Lloyd Daniels
allowed him. He scored 10 second-quarter points to pull the Spurs
to within one point at the half, the Nets leading, 49-48.
<p>
   They seemed surprised to be ahead, especially after the Spurs
shot 51.4 percent to their 44.7 percent, especially after Dominique
Wilkins had made his return to the team after missing 10 games with
a bruised knee. There was still no Robinson, but the Spurs seemed
healthy enough.
<p>
   They seemed fit to prey on the injury-depleted Nets. But just
the opposite occurred. Reeves played within the offense for the
most part, resisting his urge to shoot as if he were suppressing a
sneeze.
<p>
   It was not easy  &MD;  he clutched to shoot several times and
released on occasion &MD;  but he managed to get the ball to his
teammates without a turnover in the first half, finding Kittles
coming off screens on two nice catch-and-shoot plays.
<p>
   Kittles also made himself available, playing much more
aggressive since a quick benching against Denver for his passive
play. He hit 7 of 10 shots after that. The trend continued against
San Antonio, leading the Nets with 13 first-half points to match
the 13 Maxwell put up.
<p>
   Everything about the game seemed even though the third quarter,
with the two teams going back and forth on the scoreboard. It took
Gill to make the difference. He coolly weaved around a larger
Elliott to come up with 15 points in the third, including a 17-foot
jumper at the buzzer, a shot he grabbed and hurried off a rebound.
<p>
   That play gave the Nets a 76-72 lead to start the fourth, a team
that had committed just three turnovers so far in the game. And
Reeves did not have one of them.
<p>
   REBOUNDS
<p>
   Shawn Bradley, who has been out two weeks with pneumonia, was
cleared to practice by team doctors Wednesday night. He is expected
to join the Nets before they return from their current road trip,
which goes through Houston on Thursday and ends in Dallas on
Saturday. Bradley may need a week of workouts before he is in
playing condition.

<p>
   Manila, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Ayala Corp. won one of two
contracts to run Manila's state-owned water utility, ending a
string of failures to win at big-ticket government auctions. Ayala
and partners -- U.S. construction company Bechtel Group Inc. and
Britain's United Utilities Plc. -- won the right to run the eastern
half of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System's service area
where 11 million Filipinos live.
<p>
   The government said a second group, led by Benpres Holdings
Corp. and France's Lyonnaise des Eaux, clinched the contract to
operate the western zone.
<p>
   The winners must invest a combined $7 billion over the life of
the contract to rehabilitate and expand the water utility's 12,000
kilometers (7,500 miles) of pipes. MWSS, because of leaks and
pilferage, loses more than half the water it pumps.
<p>
   The winners beat two other groups, led by holding companies
Metro Pacific Corp. and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., in what the
government dubbed as one of the biggest water utility sales.
Generale des Eaux SA, the world's largest water utility, and
Anglian Water Plc. of the U.K. were members of the losing teams.
<p>
   Bids were submitted as a percentage of the current water tariff
of 8.78 pesos (33 cents) per cubic meter, guaranteeing that Manila
residents will see lower water bills.
<p>
   Surprisingly, Ayala's bid of 26.4 percent for the east zone was
less than half of the next closest bid.
<p>
   ``We have to admit that we are quite surprised,'' said Martin
Negre, head of Asian operations for Lyonnaise des Eaux. ``There is
a discrepancy in the order of magnitudes of the bids which will be
interesting to analyze.''
<p>
   Ayala executives said they can turn around the operations of
MWSS faster than the other groups.
<p>
   ``Our bid was based on assumptions we made as to how fast we can
bring down the non-revenue water,'' said Antonio Aquino, vice
president of Ayala Land Inc., the group's property arm. ``I don't
think it should be a reason to worry. We ran our numbers and
checked them again and again.''
<p>
   With the win, Ayala will add a new business to its extensive
portfolio. It controls Ayala Land Inc., the nation's largest
property developer and the most valuable company on the stock
exchange, and Bank of the Philippine Islands, its third largest
bank. It also has telecommunications, electronics, and food
processing units.
<p>
   Ayala owns 60 percent of Manila Water Co. Inc., its vehicle for
undertaking the project. Bechtel owns 20 percent and United
Utilities the balance.

 &UR; U.S. BONDS LITTLE CHANGED IN ASIA AS DOLLAR CLIMBS VERSUS YEN &LR;  &QL;

<p>
   Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasuries were little
changed in Asia as the dollar climbed to a 47-month high versus the
yen amid optimism investors will continue to channel money into
U.S. bonds and stocks.
<p>
   The dollar rose as high as 119.40 yen, its highest since Feb.
19, 1993, up from 118.80 yen this morning. The dollar last traded
for 119.19 yen.
<p>
   ``The dollar's strength isn't having a big impact now, but we'll
have to see what happens in New York-time,'' said Hiroshi Kawakami,
a trader at Hyakujushi Bank, Ltd.
<p>
   A rising dollar can boost the allure of dollar-based assets for
investors who must convert their proceeds into weaker currencies.
<p>
   With Japan's stock market sputtering, and domestic bond yields
not far above record lows, domestic investors will have no choice
but to look overseas for better returns, analysts said.
<p>
   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note last yielded 6.55 percent,
about 410 basis points more than the benchmark 10-year Japanese
government bond. The spread between the two has averaged roughly
380 basis points over the last three months.
<p>
   The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond was up 2/32 from New York,
or about 63 cents per $1,000 bond, to yield 6.82 percent. The
two-year note was yielding 6 percent.
<p>
   Yesterday in New York, bonds fell as Wall Street firms struggled
to sell the $17.5 billion of two-year notes they bought from the
Treasury, and prepared for today's sale of $12.5 billion in 5-year
notes.
<p>
   The Treasury sold its notes at a yield of 5.984 percent, less
than the 6 percent yield traders anticipated just before the sale.
<p>
   Wall Street ``paid too much'' for the notes, said Rob McCool, a
trader at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.
<p>
   The lower-than-expected yield at the sale ``doesn't mean the
auction went well,'' because securities firms can't sell the bonds
for as much as they paid the government for them, said Mark
Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities Inc.
<p>
   In New York, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which was
little changed prior to the 1 p.m. Eastern time sale, slumped 5/8
point, or $6.25 per $1,000 bond, pushing its yield up 5 basis
points to 6.83 percent, the highest in nine days.
<p>
   Traders said comments from Fed Governor Susan Phillips in a
Market News interview hurt bonds earlier in the day. Phillips
suggested the Fed might not wait for a rise in the core consumer
price index before boosting rates.
<p>
   The Fed hasn't changed bank lending rates since January 1996,
when it cut the so-called federal funds target by a quarter of a
percentage point to 5.25 percent. The Fed's policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee next meets on Feb. 4-5.
